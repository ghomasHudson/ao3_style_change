But Cas doesn’t answer, so he repeats again, saying his name. But when Cas still doesn’t respond, and Dean’s sure he’s made quite the cacophony on the tapestry of this door holding him back, he starts panicking. He checks to see if the door is locked, and it isn’t, and he goes in, and realises Cas isn’t there.
He’s so much slower this time, but he never moves to take your clothes off in the light.
, he can barely hold it together. He wonders if it’s okay if he stays the night. Cas only has a twin sized bed, but the option of sleeping next to him like this isn’t
He wakes slowly, and when he does, you let yourself stroke your hands through his hair, admiring how he leans into the touch, before he opens his eyes, looks at you, and pulls away so fast it almost seems violent.
,” he says.
You have to find your father to make
“You didn’t kill me either,” Dean says.
He couldn’t believe in you, in God, in what is the only certainty you could ever expect from what this world means, simply because he could not then make sense of the tragedy he’s seen. “ ...
“We should tell Sam about this immediately,” you say. That makes Dean’s expression shoot right at you, sharp, pointed. You use some of your grace to ensure your hands don’t shake.
either, so like, fair warning, or whatever,” he says, and you’re unsure what he means, too entranced by the way his hands fumble at your pants. But once he gets you pants down, pulls at your boxers, he slips his mouth down around the head of your erect cock, and suddenly the pleasure is so intense you can’t even remember what species you are.
“Cas, you really don’t have to do that...” he says, but you can tell now, you see his tells, the look in his eyes. Maybe this is going to make him easier to read because you can read him now, and he
it never happened,” you say, feeling extremely numb. Dean nods. You realise now, what he’s asking you. It makes you feel extremely sick. He wants you to erase his memory. You feel hot, nauseous, dizzy all over. It’s become very hard to not flash your distress so obviously on your face. There’s a desperate part of you that just wants to deny him, to leave him with these last memories of you, to tell him you no longer have those particular powers as you’re cut off from Heaven so he’s forced to remember. But he shouldn’t have to. And the thought of him remembering and feeling sick, feeling regret or disgust at being with you? It’s overpowering.
“Yes… Yes, of course. I’m sorry I couldn’t make it today but I’m sure you were in good hands with Benny.” He pauses, looking down as he rubs his hands together. “So, uh, if you’ll excuse me. I’ve gotta go. Have a good day,” he says and rushes past them.
“Who is?” Dean asks, pulling the shirt over his head.
“Do you think they would react as positively as you did?”
They stilled after rowing for some time and leaned back with their hands dangling in the water. Dean looked up into the cloudless sky and closed his eyes. Cas was sitting next to him, staring out into the lake. He felt the heat radiating from his friend’s body. He faintly smelled of sweat—not pungent, just a whiff, ensuring Dean of his presence.
“You know what I think? You’re either a homophobic asshole or you’re in deep, deep denial over how attracted you are to me!”
Dean can hear Blossom on the other side of the door long before Sam finally opens.
When his work is done, Cas washes the cloth as good as possible, wrings it out again, carefully places it over the edge of the sink and dries his hands with the towel hanging from the hook next to it.
“Precisely!”
He pulls back, wiping the back of his hand over his eyes, under his nose. "Cas, I..."
“Dude, yes!” Benny high-fived him a little too hard before finally taking off.
Dean is sulking when everyone is seated and Athena proceeds to steer the jeep out of the parking lot. He can’t remember the last time he had to sit in the back of a car. And if that’s not enough, he has to share the bench with Cas Novak.
"Good," Dean says, nodding to himself, "that's...good."
“Good night, Dean.”
“Come on, let’s start,” Dean interjects before Cas can voice more of his concerns.
“Whatever you want, Cas,” Dean says and gives him another kiss. “I think we should stay close to the house, though. I ran into one of those British dudes again last night.”
“Yeah? I don’t see any mermen around here,” Dean says. He feels cold sweat pouring out of every pore on his body.
“They came to my fucking house and put some weird spell on my property so we couldn’t escape. And they did something to my phone and the internet so I couldn’t call for help. They even did something to the river, probably the ocean as well, to make sure Cas can’t swim away. He looked like straight out of a Bible movie when he fell into the river….or, onto, I guess.”
Dean lets out a quivering breath. For a moment he’s certain he’s going to faint. He actually blacks out for a second but when he comes to, he is still standing on his feet. Cas is still there, sitting on a rock with a fish tail where his legs should be, watching. “Don’t be afraid,” he says.
She sticks her hands in the backpockets of her jeans. “Ghost chasers come around here every now and then, sometimes claiming they’ve found definitive proof and then show my dad photos of the ‘ghost’ they encountered.”
“Dude,” Dean exhales, “what does that even mean?”
“Seven? I’ll pick you up at your place if that’s okay?”
Cas’s hands are shaking. “I’ll never be able to step out of my father’s shadow,” he says.
“Alright, fine,” Dean sighed, got hold of the baby again and moved onto his feet.
“And Kaia is a cool kid,” he says when he lets go of her again.
Dean turns around. “Yes?”
“No, I did not. I was thinking about being the bigger person and bringing an end to our…disagreement. Whatever, it’s none of your business.”
“Please, tell me they’re for sale,” the man says.
Dean hesitated for a second. “Boyfriend,” he replied briefly.
against his check and Cas angled his head to kiss him.
Cas says, with earnest this time.
At their table, Cas receives another round of hugs and compliments. Balt asks how he’s feeling and Cas says he’s relieved to have the crucial part behind him. They talk for a while—Dean isn’t even listening properly, only has eyes for Cas—until Rowena is greeted by Linda and the conversation slowly fades out.
“No, Dean, I don’t think it’s strange. And besides, I’m glad you finally got your head out of your ass and I can live my live in peace again.”
“No, we’re good,” Cas said.
Bewilderment was obvious on his face when he opened the door after they’d knocked. Probably surprised to see the both of them still around, Dean reckoned.
is already more involved than Cas ever will be. He thought Anna would come as well but apparently she has to take care of her kid who’s stuck in bed with chickenpox. So it comes that Cas is sitting at his table, alone, sipping on his bubbly drink, and trying to look unbothered by his situation. Every now and then he glances at his phone and pretends to be texting, like he’s too busy mingling because of his non-work friends. When he looks up once again, he catches a glimpse of a carmine sweater. Cas has been avoiding it’s wearer, Dean, all evening. Dean from HR. He’s got on a gray shirt and black tie underneath. The outfit is smart and cozy all at once and Cas can’t help but wonder whether the knitwear is as soft to the touch as it appears to be. He’ll never know.
The first thing Dean did was lie to Castiel, and frankly Cas thinks it’s one of the cruellest things he’s ever done. He knows it’s supposed to be for him, but it’s just a mockery and it teases the shattering hope and overwhelming pain in his chest like nothing else.
He stalks out to the care, and the light hits you bright, but it doesn’t harm you, and you’re now just a hair shy of 100% certain you’re not a vampire, and you want to reassure Dean, but he just gets into the truck, roughly opening the door then slamming it behind him. You always pay close attention to the soundwaves Dean emits when interacting with objects. It’s a good indicator of how angry he is. This time, it makes you flinch.
And you really miss Sam.
, even if it does seem a little ridiculous given how fucking tiny the bed is and their respective sizes. But he’d rather sleep on the floor beside Cas over leave this room.
You let him rest, and you patch up the wall, certain that he won’t hear. You might not be able to save his brother from being possessed by the devil in any certainty, but you can try to fix the holes it leaves.
“Cas, you could sleep on top of me, and I’d be fine with it.”
“Are you going to invite me in?” Dean says, in a fit of gambling.
him, which seems so much worse for some reason, when the pain has overtaken his ability to process. He blinks through the sharp pain and feels horribly sick. That is, before another strike and burst of pain whites everything out, and it hurts so much Cas doesn’t know what to do.
“Okay,” you concede, and you feel empty. If he decides he still wants to ditch you after this, you’re certain you will die. It’s going to fry you out, and there’s no help in sight.
“What,” Dean says, pulling away from you, and he’s immediately on offence. It sends chills through you, and your brain isn’t working fast enough to react right. “Cas, if someone’s too drunk to remember, you probably shouldn’t--”
He feels the emptiness in the space loudly. He starts feeling a hopelessness that Dean has left him like this for eternity. That Dean will forget about him, like he usually does when Cas isn’t in his line of vision, forced into this hell of remorse and anguish while forgotten to Dean.
“You’re dead,” Sam says. Fair point. You cannot examine this too carefully. But Sam turns into a big grin. “But why wouldn’t he tell us? It’s the same shoulder right, like I’m remembering right?”
“Know what? Is this your way of telling me you did in fact sleep with someone else? I’m not going to throw some tantrum, good for you,” Dean says. He’s angry right now, defences up.
Eventually, the painful waves turn shallower, and you can focus on where you are and what’s going on now. Time has definitely passed: it’s getting closer to dusk, and Dean is here, and he smiles when your eyes meet his.
It makes Heaven make sense. You think you could spend an eternity reliving this moment. Which you guess marks you significantly human.
“You died yesterday,” Sam says, and you hear the sorrow undertones.
You’re 98.74% you can’t be turned into a vampire anyways, but the image of Dean killing you so gruesomely stays strong in your mind as he unties the ropes.
“You sure got old,” she replies. Sam looks at her perplexed.
“Well, I have some beef jerky. And pie..” Cas says.
“I would be immensely agreeable.”
He thinks about the sandwich and the fact Dean made it with care, and he thinks about the unknown weather outside, and he ignores a deep fear threatening inside whiting out his ability to comprehend how spectacularly bad his decision making must have become, because all he sees is a single choice answer. It makes him feel a little blank.
“I told you I want to,” Cas says. Dean shrugs, and he grabs the handcuffs off the chair, sits down to the left of Cas, and holds out the handcuff, open, in his right hand.
“Of course,” Cas says, and Dean lets out an audible sigh at that. “You’re always welcome with me.” Cas turns away then and pulls out a key on a chain with a number (4), and unlocks a compartment on the wall next to the garage door. He then presses a button and the garage door goes up, revealing an unmade twin-sized bed in a large room with several windows at the back as well as several cabinets with haphazard snacks on the counters below them, such as an opened bag of cheetos. Cas walks in, kicking the pair of pants he had been wearing last night under the bed, and throwing his jacket and keys on the mattress.
“You’re hard,” Dean notes, and it’s so disconnected from anything else. It sends thrills up and down his body, and yeah, he’s also sporting a semi, but the fact Cas desires him, that Cas has gotten off many times because of him, is so much he doesn’t give a fuck about anything else.
“That’s, that’s what happens when you’re alive,” Sam says.
“You can call me whatever you want, but
He remembers watching Dean die again and again, and he immediately tries to fumble on the concrete floor, dark and cold, for the tablet, his assurance he will not hurt Dean again.
Castiel thought then, pushing his face harder into Dean’s ribs, and the man himself heaved his body from the bed with a groan and a grin.
too deep.
He isn’t
The edges blur, faces lose their depth, and voices become monotone with time. The most far gone, the ones from the very beginning, are the hardest to watch. Castiel once sat with a woman from ancient Mesopotamia for some time, nearly immeasurable in heaven, and studied her lifeless face until it too began to blur, her very identity losing itself to the sands of time. The loneliest, most miserable often go first. The details lose their meaning, then the bigger picture, then anything from their time on earth at all until their heaven is a meaningless swirl of color.
He loves deeply.
In the beginning, Castiel had Dean in his bed and at his little rickety table for meals, kissing his cheek in the mornings before work and kissing him soundly on the mouth before bed.
Castiel draws himself to his feet, turns himself to face his visitor, and he’s close enough to touch. Close enough to count his lashes and study the colors of his eyes. Close enough to see the details he had forgotten. Dean takes his hand.
He laughed bitterly in Castiel’s ear, or at least it seemed like he did, and the room went quiet once again. The Dean in his bed snored, the arm around his shoulders tightened, and Castiel closed his eyes against the burn of tears.
Others that left you chained to the earth, under the weight of the world like a feeble imitation of Atlas.
You know this because of the
With Castiel’s head filled with noise and Dean’s entire presence empty of anything resembling life, they didn’t talk much. Well, they did, but their conversations were empty and repetitive, holding none of the fire Castiel yearned for in the sleep he caught on good nights.
Castiel did not sleep most nights. He was caught between the past and the present, remembering smooth black leather seats while also knowing that their truck just outside had vinyl. Remembering the feeling of pressing a cassette tape into an often unreliable tape deck while also knowing that Dean hoarded records and CDs. Remembering a long-haired man with a kind smile that called Dean
There is no other like
he muses absently,
When the bird, cradled inside a towel-stuffed box, dies for what seems like the hundredth time, Castiel looks at the calendar on the fridge proclaiming JULY and wishes for an end to this endless summer. Dean stands over him, straightening from giving Castiel a gentle kiss on the forehead, and Castiel turns his attention to the man sharing his own personal hell.
“Cas, it’s fine,” Charlie said.
“So, Cas,” Dean interrupts his thoughts. “Do you really not want to tell us what you saw?”
“It’s been an exciting day,” Cas says in a low voice, pulling his hands away from the keyboard.
“I’m starving, man. Can’t you be a little less picky?” Dean whines when Sam has dismissed yet another restaurant.
Dean retrieved his phone from his pocket and handed it to Cas. “Your number, please.” Cas took it from him with a smile and quickly created a new contact with his name and phone number.
“Castiel has told me very much about you,” Father Jim said.
“Goodbye,” Cas said after a while and withdrew himself from the embrace.
“Yes, and I thought I’d see if you might want to meet up today. I mean, only if you don’t have any other plans already”
Cas didn’t answer.
“And did you?”
“This is good, isn’t it?” Dean gasps.
“I hope you’re right,” Cas replied sadly. “Maybe let them talk to Father Jim. He knows and I’m sure he can change their minds.”
This time, the man manages to open the passenger side door by himself. It’s only a short drive up to his house. After they’ve left the car, the man walks by Dean’s sculptures with interest but he doesn’t feel like starting a conversation about them now, although he normally seizes every small opportunity he gets to talk about his artworks. Now, he can’t wait to get out of his damp clothes and finally take a hot shower. It’s been less than two hours since he almost drowned in the freezing ocean. The coffee at the sheriff’s station made it bearable, though he gets why the officers usually buy their coffee at the diner. It warmed him up from the inside, yes, but it didn’t taste much better than the sea water he swallowed.
“Oh,” Cas sighs.
Amelia sighs. “You know, I’m not exactly thrilled. But I’ll get there.”
An elderly woman walked by, eyeing him with caution.
Only a moment later he returns to the kitchen, holding two pizza boxes and then shouts, “Claire, pizza!”
“Okay,” Dean says then, “your turn.” Dean gestures him where he’s supposed to go. “Body wash, shampoo, is all in there, you can use it. There’s also a towel for you.”
When the morning they left for Indianapolis had come, Cas took the first turn behind the wheel. Cas was glad to have something to occupy him with to lessen his anxiousness but when they arrived in St. Louis where they were supposed to switch places, he started to feel really miserable.
“A while,” he says.
“Fine,” Cas says.
Cas may still have his difficulties with social cues and human emotions but he is not stupid. He’s very well aware that there’s something simmering inside both of them, something strong and beautiful, only waiting for the barriers keeping it locked inside to burst and to finally become…
“Will you be allowed to go somewhere…let’s say, for example, Kansas?” Dean interrogated.
Cas takes off the shirt and brings his hands back to framing Dean's face. "You're nervous," he says.
“Oh, hello, what a good boy. What a good boy,” Cas says, kneeling down and scratching both sides of the dog’s head.
When both their pants and socks and Cas’s shirt are off, Dean urges him to lie back on the bed and crawls on top of him.
Cas winces at the cruel brightness of the bathroom lamp stinging in his eyeballs. He realizes he’s walked in here barefoot and the cold tiles are assaulting his feet while he reliefs himself. He’s sure he can feel the temperature drop with every second he’s in here and when he washes his hands afterwards he could swear he’s seeing his breath form tiny clouds as it’s leaving his mouth. Then the lights begin to flicker and Cas regrets ever signing the lease to this house. The fluorescent lamp over the mirror makes one last weak attempt to stay on before it dies for good, leaving Cas surrounded by darkness.
(See the end of the chapter for
“She has a fucking boyfriend!” Dean yelled into the speaker, sounding alarmingly disturbed.
“Would’ve taught you a lesson,” he says.
“But what about Dean? You guys aren’t talking either, am I right?” She looked upset.
Cas throws up his hands. “
“It’s about your house, isn’t it?”
“Now tell me to fuck off or whatever. I get it.”
“Guys!” It was Charlie who interrupted him, Dorothy tucked under her arm. “Benny told us you’re here. We’ve been looking for you for ages!”
When he’s done, Jody shows up by his side. “Hey,” she says, “mind if I take the lounger next to you?”
“You seen a lotta Indy races?”
“Hey, I just learned mermen exist. I’m still questioning my sanity. Don’t need any of my superiors to do the same.”
“Dean,” Cas says after a while, “I’m cold.”
“No,” Dean replied without looking up from where was curled up on her couch, clutching a pillow in front of his chest.
Dean groans and gets off the couch as well. “I hope you’re not coming after him,” he says and strokes Blossom behind her ear.
“I’m gonna be an engineer, yes, but that doesn’t mean I know what kind of job I’m gonna have. Also, you can’t compare liberal arts to engineering. And who says you have to know already? You’ve still got two years of college ahead of you.”
Cas is breathing heavily.
“Yes, I have a workshop on Darwin Road. I mostly build custom furnishings but I work on all kinds of stuff.”
“Good night,” Cas says, “and tell me tomorrow if you’ll be on the trip.”
“Yes… I mean, you know, as a married couple. The dancing and, uh, everything.”
“A long time ago. I’ve learned from my mistakes. That’s why I keep my distance when I have legs.”
“No, it’s alright. Ben and his mother moved to another state. We only talk on the phone every once in a while. But whatever, it’s been years. I’m over it.” Both of them know that’s not true.
“For example?”
Cas inhaled deeply through his nose. “I wouldn’t do that to him, Charlie. Not again. My decision is final, I won’t be going back.” About the other thing he wasn’t so sure. He hadn’t really thought about it, actually. They had been reunited for only a week and Cas was still mentally stuck in the certainty of never being able to have a romantic partner that came along with joining the clergy. Even if Dean would have liked to be with him like this—and Cas was almost certain he wouldn’t—he was not ready to even think about being in a relationship. He had made his peace with being on his own forever…at least that’s what he’d used to tell himself.
The boy became a man, his brother as well, and their father only ever mentioned his late wife when he had drunken himself senseless again, and since Sam had long left the state to go to college and start anew, it was Dean who had to pick him up from the bar and drive him home.
“And I’ve struggled with the thought of it although I’m curious. But then, what’s more manly than taking another guy’s dick, right?” he says and lets out a nervous laugh.
“Let go of her!” she screams. “What did you do to her? Get out!”
However, his reunion with Dean had certainly awoken something that he’d thought had been gone for good. Cas knew such a thing would happen sooner or later. At the seminary fellow priests and clergyman had shared their experiences with unwanted attraction or even feelings that were inappropriate and how they had gotten over it without betraying the role God had entrusted them with. Cas had also heard stories of those who had given into their desire and, if he could trust his sources, this hardly ever resulted in a pleasant outcome. He didn’t want to end like this.
Cas is running, as far as their off-trail route allows it. “Wait,” Dean calls after him, trying to catch up, “don’t hurt yourself. We’ve got plenty of time.”
- meet the parents part 1
“What? To whom? When?”
He wasn’t like this when he was at home. Why couldn’t he just mingle like a normal person? Sometimes he was still puzzled why Charlie or Dean even wanted to be friends with him. Maybe this was the reason Meg had left him. Michael evoked authority, unlike Cas.
Dean moves slightly on his knees until he’s in the right position to sink down onto swollen head and breathes out, trying to relax but Cas has done a thorough job with his fingers and his cock glides in easily.
Sam’s response gets stuck halfway in his throat when the meaning of Dean’s words sinks in. He’s staring at Dean’s finger pointing at him, cross-eyed, the view of it almost comedic.
Meg groans and throws hear head back. “You have to say goodbye if you don’t want something following you home. Don’t you buffoons know anything?”
Dean probably didn’t even want to see him, judging by the way he had acted towards him earlier that day. He had his own life with his job and his fiancée and there was certainly not a place for Cas in it. He, who had ruined their friendship by trying to become a priest.
“How was it for you? How are you feeling?” Cas asks when he hops back into bed again.
“You got to be kidding, bro,” Gabriel says, carrying the tiniest of Castiel’s boxes up to the house. “Do you feel the weird vibe this house gives off, too? People have probably died in there.”
“I suppose Missouri was right,” he says.
They’ve made a lot of progress with his car already and Cas can finally see everything coming back together.
“You said we could hang out today.”
“What about you? You don’t seem to be in the best mood.”
“A week later, yes. I wanted to bring some clarity into this. So I met Lydia for the first time after that night almost sixteen years ago. I still remembered her. She told me how Emma had been bugging her about her biological father for years and she finally gave in and gave her a name. She only knew my first name but with a few more details, Emma was able to find me. Lydia said there weren’t any other men who could’ve possibly been Emma’s father and she always knew it was me but of course I insisted on a paternity test, just to be sure. And the result was that, without a doubt, I am Emma’s biological father.”
When it’s time, Dean drives them down to the beach. They agreed to do this here. The far end, so he thought, would be hidden enough from curious eyes, behind a few tall rocks. Hardly anyone ever goes here and certainly not this time of day. They are on their own, just the two of them.
“What a nice lady,” Cas said ironically after Dean had freed himself from her grabby hands and joined him at the bar. A shiver ran through his body when he looked behind his shoulder to the dance floor where Mrs Bradbury had already found her next victim.
“You’re only taking some of my stuff with you, not all of it. I will have to fit Cas’s things too in my car, remember.”
“Hey, Cas,” she greeted him. “We were just talking about how it would be best if we started with the article you mentioned the other day. You know, the one dealing with Molinism.”
“Ah.” She waved her hand sheepishly. “I just unfroze something. Anyway, you should let them cool a bit before you eat them. Your father will be home soon but Sam’s outside if you want to greet him in the meantime.”
“Petty… Excuse me? I wouldn’t consider running for Sheriff’s office a ‘petty thing.’ I’m a very responsible person and a good leader. I would have made a brilliant sheriff.”
“What? You’d prefer if she’d be smooching a guy right now?” Cas noticed Dean’s passive-aggressive tone.
One of the guys had clearly just made a joke as the others broke into boisterous laughter. A girl noticed him, becoming aware that he had been observing them. She opened her mouth like she wanted to speak but Cas quickly turned on his heels and almost fell into a running pace as he fled from the group. Why did he do that? They were living in the same building and it was likely he was going to run into them some time in the near future and he supposed that another meeting would be really awkward now after this situation where he had been acting like a complete fool. Again he heard them laughing, convinced they were making fun of him this time.
“Really?”
“I’m telling you now,” Dean says. “I didn’t want to distract you before your big day or make you feel like this was more important than your comeback.”
“Having a good time?” Gunnar asked, seemingly entertained by Dean’s childlike joyousness.
“Good,” Cas says, “I can’t wait for everyone to hear us. I can’t wait to perform in front of an audience again.”
There’s no hurry in what Cas does or the negligence that comes along with his usual, intoxicated hook-ups.
Last chapter, aaahhh!!!
“Have you thought this through since we last talked?”
he’s totally gone on him.
“You previously lived in Lebanon, Kansas, is that correct?”
Later, Dean packs his backpack—a bottle of water, sandwiches, rain poncho and a flashlight just in case, though they won’t be out very long. Cas has a curfew after all.
“I’m sorry, what was that?”
Cas thinks, and asks, “Dean, do you have some change left?”
“I’m planning a recording,” Linda says then. “If it all goes well, it might be the beginning of a series. I told the studio manager to recommend a pianist and since Rowena and I’ve been talking and she mentioned your fallout with Metatron Management & Records…”
you can torture something for someone, just so you can feel
Cas does move at that, and rather aggressively, but instead, he reaches towards the bed and grabs his keys, pressing a button that closes the garage door behind Dean. Dean watches it, enamoured by the mechanism for some reason, even as it leaves them in a semi-darkness. And when Cas does come at him, he thinks Cas might actually be about to hit him.
Suddenly, vibrant, stinging pain writhes across Cas’s entire body, and he can’t stop it, can't stop twisting away trying to escape it. It’s pulsating, painful, gets in his eyes and they’re watering. He can’t see, but closing his eyes hurts, but he can’t dare open them. It’s the worst in his cuts, all the wounds open and reacting. He faintly hears the resonance from the clanking handcuffs and his body against the metal, but he can’t stop. He wants to escape.
“He’s dead,” you say.
He wants to chase salvation so badly he’s sick with it. He wonders what it’d be like if Dean would just stop hurting him, just for a moment, and sit close to him, hold him. Sometimes, he fantasises about this so loudly in his head that it chases away some of the pain until he realises again that Dean is looking down at him in disgust.
“The bunker is your home,” he says, quiet to Cas, fighting the urge to just kiss him more, but savouring the way Cas doesn’t seem to have respite now.
“You still want me Cas? Really?”
“Simple,” Dean says. “As easy as shishkabob.” Dean puts a hand on Cas’s shoulder. “You’re going to stay on your knees and think of the face of someone you murdered. Then you’re going to whip your back, do it now to practise,” Dean says, and Cas does, the biting pain more intense than he expected. Dean smiles, probably at his reaction. “Five times consecutively,” Dean says, and Cas does then, the out of control nature of the action making it faster than he can keep up with, pain too much, too unaccounted for; he’s heaving. “I didn’t mean now but okay. Then think of another person you murdered, go again, not now, when I leave. Obviously, we don’t need to worry about permanent damage, and it’s not like you will run out of people to think of. Got it?”
But he’s still growing colder. Like he’s not sure how to cope without his brother, like he never learnt how to. Or maybe it’s the news he listens to for hours on the radio, before you try to convince him to show you another one of his favourite classic rock albums instead of listening to more tragedy.
“Well, I assume you’re not planning to tie me up, torture me, then stab me in the morning,” Castiel says, mostly as a joke, to lighten the mood, but then it hits him that that is
“You want me in your bed to have sex with me,” Castiel says, a little in awe. He’s spent the last several years wishing for that, dreaming superflously about Dean wanting him,

You want to
“Dean... I just, I just burnt... Bela?” Sam says, pulling away. Bela’s just sort of standing there; she shrugs in her bunny pajamas.
Castiel wakes on cold, hard metal, lying on his back, his hands trapped above his head. When he goes to pull at them, sharp pangs hit him from his right wrist. He tries to blink his eyes open in panic, and he succeeds through crusty discomfort. Despite feeling his grace still stifled, he still desperately reaches for it to alleviate the pain to no avail.
Dean laughs at that. And pulls out a knife, saying, “You can’t be serious.”
But time keeps dragging.
“Cas, shut up,” Dean says, and you do, abruptly. Here is the anger you were expecting. “So, you ingested the bitch’s blood, right?” he says. You bite the inside of your lip. You realise how human of you that is. You taste blood.
at Castiel. Things have to be okay in the end. They can fix this.
He tries again and although he definitely didn’t miss a key, it still doesn’t sound like it’s supposed to. He takes a few deep breaths and starts from the top.
“Yeah, I get that,” Cas said, laughing along with her. He was certainly going to like it here.
They are quiet for a while, sipping their coffees.
“Yes. Athena Lopez. How nice of you to finally show up,” she says, a little bit annoyed but Dean can’t blame her.
The giggle was followed by a long sigh and Dean snorted a laugh. “Seems like the girls are already wide awake.”
“What’s wrong that?”
“Bye,” she said and pressed a quick kiss on his lips, before picking up her phone and disappearing through the front door of his house.
is on.”
“Yeah, but I think he dislikes me in particular.”
Dean lets out a laugh and the sound of it makes Cas smile.
As he wasn’t familiar with the neighborhood, he only ran around the block at first, then expanded his route to two blocks, then three. Tomorrow he would already know where to go without getting lost.
“Gabe said you’re leaving.” Dean’s nose and cheeks are all rosy from the cold. He hasn’t even zipped up his coat yet.
His next try is more successful. Dean’s been silent long enough. He hasn’t spoken in almost a year. There was nothing to say. But now that anger has taken over the grief, he wants to let everything out. No counselor achieved what rage can do now.
“I know, Dean. I’m sorry I can’t help you with this.”
“It’s alright, Castiel. So, what do you say?”
It’s a miracle he survived this afternoon!
Sam laughs and shakes his head. “Seriously, though,” he says, “I’m happy for you. Cas seems like a good catch. I mean, a famous pianist, come on—who would’ve thought that?”
“What something?” Charlie asks.
He’s not sure if her words are comforting or unsettling.
“About four months,” Cas replied, still tightly clasping Dean’s hand. Both his palms were sweaty.
“Here you go,” Alicia says when she sets a steaming cup in front of Cas. “It’s my special blend. I collected and dried the herbs myself.”
Michael shrugs. “We will see.”
“Hey, buddy,” he says to Quentin who is sniffing around on Castiel’s porch when Dean gets there and, after knocking, Dean is about to tell him he’s not exactly welcome here but loud stomping from inside that seems to shake the entire house gives the cat a jolt and off he is.
if you say it.”
“He’s nice, I guess.” He wasn’t sure what else to say. It was already too late to stop her anyway.
“Because Benny would’ve knocked you out if you hadn’t been good today. Cas has far more self-control.”
The word ghosted around in his head.
“Are you happy now with your new life?”
“Long day?” Dean asks when Cas takes a sip.
“Hey guys, how’re you doing?” Athena says, catching up with them.
Cas showed his brother a questioning face when Meg had left. “Everything’s gonna be fine,” Michael reassured him and Cas believed him.
Dean doesn’t see Cas again the following days. Maybe he’s scared him off with his over-sharing. He just wanted to convince the guy that it gets better. That things will settle and he can start a new, post-marriage life. It did take a while for Dean, too, after his relationship with Lisa ended and she announced they’d move away to live closer to her mom. By doing so she basically took his son away from Dean—which he is, even though they aren’t related by blood—and there was nothing he could have done about it.
“Dean,” Cas says, walking closer towards the door, “I’m sorry for that.”
“I don’t wanna go back,” he says, wrapping his arms around Cas again. “Can’t we just stay here and hope no-one notices?”
(See the end of the chapter for
suggest that bringing Sam on the loop with this is some smart plan,” Dean says. “If you don’t remember, he’s the one who released Satan in the first place. I couldn’t trust him if I was dangling off a cliff, and he had the rope.” You pause, try to absorb that.
“No! No, Cas, I was just worried, you know, you’re my best friend, and I don’t want to screw shit up,” he says. You feel your anxiety melt into warmth. The next thing he says is quieter, more vulnerable, his hand motions still, and he’s looking at you intensely. “Didn’t want to screw up our first time together or whatever.”
“No,” Cas says, and doesn’t elaborate. Dean takes his hand, smart of him to sit to the left of Cas, he supposes, and licks it, before sticking his hand down Cas’s pants. He always thought it’d be somewhat gross to touch another man’s cock, despite how compelling it always seemed, but it is far from it. It turns him on so much, and he loves the heat of it and most of all he loves the way Cas can’t help but moan. He thinks about how he was just ready to give up earlier, and he can’t find a single reason in the world why that would be smart now.
?” you say.
“How could you not save me? After everything I did for you?” the demon in the shape of Castiel says. You know it’s not him though. Besides the fact you actually are certain he’d never knowingly hurt you, they used to do this with Sam a lot, when you were in Hell before. “Aren’t you so smart, Dean. I’ve been waiting for you. I couldn’t believe it when they said you’d somehow escaped.”
“Just chill, alright. I know this is a lot, but it’s a good thing,” you try to comfort her. She doesn’t seem pleased at it.
,” you try to say in warning, lost in it, but you start coming, ejaculating into his mouth, and he pulls off, coughing a bit, some come landing on your leg as well. Coming down from the bliss, sated, you’re suddenly overwhelmed by a certainty you did something wrong. It’s all so much, to filter in where you are again, who you’re with, what’s happening. Dean’s wiping your leg and his mouth off with his dark shirt he picked up off the ground, and the touch is soothing, calming.
“What?”
“Well, I’d stab you again in a minute, but I’d never...” she trails off, after starting rather brightly. “Anyways, I’ll leave you to contact your... friend or whatever. I’d like to meet him, if he’s willing.”
It is not exactly the last person you’d expect to see, either.
When Cas does go to get out pie, which they have to eat from the tin with plastic forks because he doesn’t have any silverware or plates, Dean also notices Cas has barely any food in there, yet for some reason still has Dean’s favourite snacks. Dean doesn’t know if Cas was hoping he’d show up or if Cas just happens to like the foods Dean does, but it makes something warm glow inside of Dean. He does also notice, there’s no alcohol in any of the cabinets, which is worrisome because as serious as he was about cutting back, he knows he’s upped his usual amount a bit the last few weeks, and he's not going to cut it out completely.
“I think I’m human,” Bela says. “Is guilt a torture you’ve seen used in hell?” she asks, and there’s something earnest about it, about the way she’s looking at you almost apologetically, that knocks you a bit off guard. It’s been many years since you’ve seen her, but all your memories of her before she was a torturer in hell were not of someone very capable of feeling much guilt.
“I could fly us back to your motel room, or drive us I suppose,” you offer.
It feels too intimate for your brother to see, for some reason, and you immediately let your t-shirt sleeve down, even though he’s seen the exact same replica many times before. But there’s a sudden edge of hope that makes you feel like you’re going to fucking choke.
any type of distress? Maybe it was just some weird reaction Cas was having to being human? Like he was so upset about that asshole Latin author Dean so helpfully reminded him of?
is something you feel for him in a way that doesn’t translate right. You don’t want to tell him you love him because what you want to tell him is you’re in love with him.
“You mean breakup etiquette?” Dean asks, because he needs to hear the words from Cas’s mouth. It doesn’t matter that they didn’t sit around defining what it was. Cas died telling Dean how much he loved him. Cas told him a few hours ago that he loves him. It has to count for something. It has to matter in some way.
“You want to forget it,” you finally say, and it feels like anaesthetic. You’re biting the inside of your lip to feel something and focus. Dean just shrugs, but he also gives you a guilty smile, and it grows wider when you nod at him in assent.
“I already told you,” Cas says. Dean smirks, and he has completely lost control of the conversation because the intent that Cas is looking at him with, like he’s fucking
“I do. I have for years. I s’pose I’ve been shit at showing it, but that doesn't change anything.”
many times. You know me. Short term memory,” Dean jokes. It seems to infuriate Cas.
“Lie to you?”
He brushes his thumb against the back of Cas’s hand, daring to, barely able to breathe at it, and tries to focus on the plot, only aided by how many times he’s seen it. Eventually, he dares to glance at Cas, but Cas isn’t looking at the screen at all, just staring at their joined hands in something Dean wants to dare to call amazement.
“So we’re thinking Cas saved you then?” Sam says. You want to punch him for saying that. For making the hope threaten to bloom in your chest and take out all signs of light with its thick canopy.
The words stun her, and she looks at you with unadulterated horror.
Your hands are laced in his hair, and you’ve always wanted to run your hands through his hair, touch it like it’s priceless, but now they’re more there to stabilise you more than anything, if that’s even possible. Some way of caressing him as he takes you apart. Like a symphony, it grows, chorus, so much going on at once. You’re overwhelmed, somehow embarrassed by the sheer amount you would do anything for him right now, impossibly alight with pleasure at even that thought at all, and it’s just so
“Get out. Now, Cas,” he says, rather tersely, grabbing a flannel from the front seat and putting it on. You do as he says, fumbling at the car door. When you stumble outside, you notice your pants are still undone, and so are all of the buttons on your shirt. Dean groans and throws your trench coat after you, and you wrap it around yourself, disoriented in the morning light and the concrete parking lot ground. It’s a very deserted area, and no one is up yet. Everything feels eerie and quiet, like a storm coming. And for some reason, it’s not Raphael and your soon demise that has your chest beating bright with panic.
“Well, great, Cas,” Dean says, trying to find words as they’re clawing up around his throat and mouth. “That’s just. Really fucking great, Cas.”
“No shit, Cas, I’m fucking livid at you.” Cas feels fear infiltrate his system. He feels himself get confused again. Is this where the empty switches things? Before anything happens, right now, and make it punishment for Cas? Cas realises he might actually appreciate that.
“You wanna elaborate a bit on that, Cas?” Dean asks. He’s surprised his voice can remain so steady. He guesses he has to be. What other choice is there? If he screams at Cas, demands him to tell him what sort of bullshit lies hidden in his select words, then all it will do is hurt and end everything in soot. He needs to do better. He thought he was doing better. He can’t really feel his legs. It’s almost like he’s floating. He remembers that this is what it used to feel like a lot, back when he was around his dad, and for some reason that just makes him feel more blurry.
He wonders if Dean wants him to do something with the handcuffs he left on the stool or just wait. He’s scared to move and do something wrong, but he’s also scared he’s failing some sort of test on the way to his own redemption. He stares at the cuffs morbidly and ends up not making any decision in his debate by the time Dean comes back carrying a box with several white towels on top. He drops it all onto the concrete, and it echoes loudly. The small lamp with a bare bulb casts shadows on his face.
“Should we go to a store and get some then?” you suggest.
He feels Dean’s hand go, hears the clunk of the cell door close, but the sensations don’t become any less caustic for an indeterminable amount of time. For some reason, it’s the loneliness that makes him feel empty, pushing him into despair. He feels like he’s choking on it. Eventually, he slips into semi-consciousness, drifting in and out of nightmarish sleep by sharp pains that shape both realities.
you’re here,” Cas says. “What I don’t understand is
“Cas, I’m trying here! Stop acting like nothing happened.”
He still can’t move, apparently the second-order not redacting the first, so he can’t even try to push his weight off his injuries. He finds he can’t even speak to apologise, to try to explain why he did what he did. Dean does get up and in his terrifying silence and their heavy breath, abruptly kicks Cas in the chest. His body recoils at impact, but Cas can’t even flinch away, stuck immobile with his shuddering breath and his coruscating agony. They stay still for a moment, and Cas feels drenched in the thick atmosphere of terror in the room.
You push yourself farther this time, trying to extrapolate what he did seem to enjoy next time, throwing yourself into it and trying to get past the primal need to breathe that feels so much more real. You realise that your fear of messing up again has made the experience nowhere near as enjoyable, and you hope it doesn’t show, even if you utilise small amounts of grace to dampen the impact of your human gag reflex.
of it again. Know that this grand plan must have some grand ending none of the archangels understand. There has to be a way for everything to matter again. But the more you see his eyes, his pain, his smile, the way he laughs at you? The more you realise that no, this is all wrong. It all matters. It all just fucking matters.
“Oh,” is all Cas says. He’s wringing his own hands, looking somewhat perplexed.
“I want to make you feel good, too, Dean,” you say, and something in Dean’s expression melts. He gives a small, sincere nod, and the emptiness is replaced by new hunger. He undoes his jeans for you, clearly way more eager than his assurances let on. You try to manoeuvre yourself into a position that’s comfortable, and up guiding him back before lowering your head in such a way you can get your mouth comfortably around his cock. You intellectually knew what to expect, but the combination of taste and personal endorphins almost knock you off track. It is extremely surprising, you think, how much it turns you on.
“What a
He wonders if this will have meaning to Dean. If it will bring him peace, control, acceptance. Cas feels so utterly twisted between the conflicting desires of actually wanting to die for Dean and have it mean something, like it could have, if he had just
“Aren’t you pissed at me?”
“I’m just afraid it will be the end,” Cas says.
Castiel understands that sex is transactional. But he also never wanted anything like that with Dean. He saw something else, something encompassing and pure and made from unadulterated intimacy and affection. He wanted Dean to desire him, want him, be devoted to him. He wants to be consumed by Dean, touched by Dean, worshipped by Dean. He wants Dean to want him in every possible way, to be everything he could be to Dean. He wants ridiculous fantasies, ridiculous impossible disgusting concepts that have nothing to do with reality. He does want Dean to fuck him. But mostly, he wants Dean to love him.
Dean’s furious, furious at Cas for leaving, furious at himself for doing everything in his power to do things right to watch it fall apart and then have things fall back into place just to crumble it into dust. And there’s no apocalypse on the rise. The world is at some sort of equilibrium, but Dean’s brain isn’t taking any of it.
“I’m.... this hasn’t happened before,” she says. She’s laying on a patch of grass not too far from you, wearing what appears to be a pair of fluffy pajamas with bunnies on them. She also looks like she did when you lost saw her, over a decade ago, young, and rather stunning. If you don’t count the scowl on her face.
“Dean, I’m--” Cas says, the first thing he’s dared to speak since Dean decided he was going to cut into him, before Dean interrupts.
Your powers are failing, though. More and more by the day. Dean doesn’t mind you not flying anymore to retain grace because he seems to like you in the passenger seat anyways, but when you start needing to sleep it freaks him out. It seems to take him hours to notice, but he shakes you awake terrified in the impala, repeating your name, and you reacquaint yourself to the world. The worry in his eyes and the echo of pressure from his hands lingers, and you almost let yourself think he’s concerned about you, and not the fact you’re growing less and less useful to him.
. “You could penetrate my... anus.” You try, and he’s squinting at you.
Dean’s vision swims, and he scours for any sign of Cas, his laptop, checks all the drawers for clothes, and yeah, maybe that’s an invasion of privacy, but it doesn’t matter because they’re all empty. He trips over his feet and almost falls, trying to race towards the garage, and there it is: that empty space.
He doesn’t know what’s on Cas’s mind now, which is mildly thrilling, but after a few minutes Cas does pull away, hair even more of a mess and eyes wide. Dean has to catch his breath, sensation lingering. It’s a little frustrating, though, because he’s a little lost for words.
Eventually he braves sliding his leg up against Cas, even moving the laptop in the process, but Cas pulls away from it, which is fair, but it leaves something sticky dancing in the dark black floor in his collarbone. After a moment, though, Cas moves his hand towards Dean’s, brushes it, sets it right beside, and the momentary touch feels electric. Dean can’t even pay attention to anything else. He reaches out to hold Cas’s hand to which Cas seems to shudder a bit. He pushes his leg back against Dean’s, and Dean’s whole body is alit.
“Come on, Cas, I’m sorry! Stop acting like a freaking child!”
), and he isn’t the one breaking Cas’s heart right now. So Cas can stop looking like he is.
“You really couldn’t fly a foot away so she wouldn’t have you tied up like that, Cas? It’s that bad?” he says, finally, and his tone is more sad than angry. He’s losing you, that part he cares about, and it still matters to him, what he’s losing. You feel emptied out.
“No. I meant it.”
It’s too much. Cas can’t compensate anymore. His breath hitches, and he doesn’t want Dean to see this. He’s supposed to be giving Dean something, pleasure, what he wants. Cas’s mind is fuzzy. He wants Dean. This isn’t Dean. He’s doing something wrong. He’s never going to see Dean again. Dean is in front of him, and he’s disappointing him. Cas is sick. Cas is shaking. He feels Dean’s hand on his shoulders, and the anchor is good, makes the world slower, the sensation not riddled with immobilisation.
Eventually, Dean goes to the box, puts some gloves on, and pours some powder onto his gloved hand from a red container. He then slides back over to Castiel, and he blows it at him.
“That doesn’t explain anything,” Cas says. It’s not until now that Dean looks at Cas and sees him for what he is: vulnerable. This isn’t going to go anywhere if Dean doesn’t pick apart his own fucking carcass.
“I didn’t, I don’t do that,” Cas says. “I see you for what you are. I don’t expect anything from you. You don’t owe me anything.”
“It doesn’t matter,” Cas says, immediately backtracking.
“Come at me,” you say. He pulls some holy water from his jacket, and you hold out your hand. It doesn’t burn, which you suppose is a good sign.
And it splinters open his chest more than Dean’s honesty ever could. He’s lost in it momentarily, but pulls away from Dean, hurriedly, once he can process what’s happening beyond the rush of endorphins and his own absent grace incapable of clearing away the fog of pleasure.
Dean says a short incantation, and Cas’s arms fall dramatically backwards, the handcuffs still on his wrists, but the chain between them broken, like Cas was when he first woke up in this room. He falls and lands on his back, grunting out in pain at the fresh wounds from the nails, many new and old cuts bleeding elsewhere.
him. He’s also spent years terrified of Dean finding out, of being disgusted by the way Castiel feels. So he doesn’t know why it makes him feel so empty that Dean expects Castiel to have sex with him. He feels trapped in a tunnel. But isn’t the light at the end what he wanted? He doesn’t get it. Shouldn’t he be glad Dean returns at least part of what he feels for him?
want to know.”
“What, uhm... what exactly do you want?” Dean says, and it’s endearing to watch the different polarities of his assuredness and his flustered states.
Dean falls into a routine of spending a few hours a day with Castiel, then leaving him, often in the complete dark, for the remainder of the time, usually in states of pain that elongate the hours. Castiel doesn’t understand how he can keep it up, and he’s embarrassed by the amount of pleading and thrashing away he does. He wants to be good for Dean. He wants to be purified. He wants this to end.
“I know Cas, shit,” Dean says. “It was jarring, alright? I just. I need my four hours? I didn’t expect the angelic back-to-the-future bullcrap.”
“I’m more worried about the priceless antiques that could save lives, but sure, yeah I’ll check on her,” Sam says. Bless him for that. The second your bedroom door, you fall to your knees, but before you can say anything, someone walks into the room.
Cas didn’t just break up with him or end whatever stupid excuse of a relationship they had. Cas really just left him. Cas is
“You think it’s okay to just,” Dean starts, and he sounds more exhausted than angry now. “Look, just stay alright? Stay alive, stay here. We can figure out the rest. I just,” Dean takes a huge breath. “I love you, okay?” Castiel feels it like a blow, sharper, maybe he is being stabbed. It needles Cas too much. Some final straw. It’s just too much. He can’t take it.
Leaving the store without it makes him feel like he’s failed Cas once again, and he’s fucking ashamed because he knows it’s ridiculous, but then he tries to figure if Cas really wants lube, he
You can’t stay awake long after that. When you do wake up again, Dean tells you that you were asleep for over three days.
“Dean, I would be very happy to pretend like what happened didn’t happen,” Castiel says.
“Oh, you think I’m the angel,” he says. “I’m not Castiel.”
“I remember,” he says. And when he goes to hold your hand regardless, you let that be a sign he’s not going to abandon you here.
And watching how Cas falls apart, already frustrated and desperate from all the ways Dean’s touched him today, his fucking cosmic desire on the edge of a razor wire, Dean thinks this might be the way to spend the rest of his life. Even as they make a complete mess of themselves, Dean’s brain is only half aware of himself to pay attention to the sheets. He feels like all his muscles are made of gelatin, but Cas seems to come back to himself and grab some towels to wipe up. He also passes Dean a new pair of pants (sweatpants, it seems Cas has a favourite type) since Dean was too stupid to think to remove his past his legs.
“I died in 2020,” you say. “Time passes differently in hell. Each month is like a decade. Since I was only there, what? Less than a day? I’m guessing it’s mid-November, and Sammy’s going to be pretty shocked to see me again so soon. You want to come? You can crash with us for a while as long as you don’t try to stab me in the heart or anything,” you offer. You think about the bunker, though, and all the things Bela could steal. You guess that’s the least of your concerns given the comparison to the amount of time she’s been damned.
“I thought you would, too,” Dean says. “So here we are.” He smiles.
But he doesn’t want to be bad at this. He knows he is inexperienced, but he’s researched it quite a lot. He wants to come off self-assured. He reaches his hands down Dean’s body, tries to undo his jeans, until Dean’s pulls away, his hands over Cas’s, and Cas feels deranged and desperate. He wants to give Dean what he wants. He’s terrified this isn’t Dean. He’s confused.
You are right. You’re very close to the bunker, and it doesn’t take much time at all for you to get to the door and knock on it. You think it’s perhaps better for Sam to let you in than for you to just enter unannounced. Bela stands beside you, obviously nervous.
The last words he said to you are still in your head, and you’re angry, you’re so fucking angry, but you have no right to be, but then again, don’t you, if he left you, like that? If he died to save your life? You wonder if you made him human enough to die and come here instead. The idea is actually a comfort. You run to him immediately, wrapping your arms around him before even thinking he might not want it because you know he doesn’t want you the way you want him. But he’s hugged you of his volition before, and fuck, you thought you’d never see him again. So what the hell?
“I think... it’s for the best,” Cas says.
He stares at the ceiling while trying to catch his breath, surprisingly terrified for reasons he cannot understand, while Dean rummages through the box for whatever the hell he’s going to use to hurt him.
You’re not entirely sure if Dean cares, though. He seems a lot more focused on the fact you’ve never had sex. You guess that’s intrinsic to life too: reproduction, replication. Otherwise there would be none of this at all. The more you doubt the great design, the more overwhelming it becomes to understand the concept of life itself. But what
“I thought you forgave me for that shit a while ago,” he says.
“You try being in hell as long as I was. Your secret’s safe with me.” She pauses. “I thought he was dead though? Is he what saved us?”
“I suppose so,” Cas says, and that’s about when the world starts spinning. Or shifting, Dean supposes. Disorientating.
time, and also the desperate desire for Dean, all wrapped up in his own mind, to want Castiel alive, to
“Yeah. Exactly.”
“You look like shit, by the way,” Dean says. Castiel stares at him blankly.
“Oh, am I?” Cas finally retorts, and it’s bitter and terse, but Dean’s so fucking grateful for it, it bursts like morning sunlight in his chest.
“Of course not! Dean,
want you, Dean,” Cas says, terrified of the words coming out of his mouth, but soldiering on anyway. “Physical intimacy is just more complicated than it seems from a distance,” he says. “I can’t be what you want.”
“Hello Dean.”
“Fuck, we’re going to need lube,” he says. He opens up the glove compartment, checks under the car seats as if he’s remembered it as some necessity. “Just found a condom, but I’m guessing we both know each other’s history already for that,” he says.
“Cas, you okay there buddy? Was that... okay?” he asks, timid.
“Uhm, yeah, Cas. About her. Sam killed her.” This is certainly new information. It jars you more into awareness.
“Suck,” Dean says faintly, looking at you like he’s dazzled by your reaction to this. You’re not entirely sure what he means, but instantly you find yourself sucking on his two fingers in your mouth. It also tastes faintly of blood. He pushes the fingers experimentally in more, and you run the back of your tongue over them, and he shudders, utterly spellbound looking at you now. You move your mouth over his fingers then, reminiscent of when you were sucking his cock, and his eyes are wide. For a moment, it seems like you responded right despite the way your brain feels hazy, but then he seems to come back to his sense, pulls his hand away from you, and you give out a breath, reeling from the sudden movement and the sudden absence.
“Of course, I did,” Cas says. “I love you, Dean,” he says, and he says it so effortlessly, like there isn’t going to be black goo and grief that consumes him.
“What?” Cas says, alarmed. “You’re giving up?”
“Yeah, I’ve been through that before. But I died being impaled from behind,” you say. Bela rolls her eyes. She doesn’t respond to that, then after a second, a facade of hers slips.
“You know we... we don’t have to do this? Right?” Cas asks, and he looks imploringly, looks with that intensity that right now Dean’s terrified of. The gaze he can’t even meet when his hand is on Cas’s dick. His fist shakes. He presses it against the mattress he’s sitting on, stands up to face Cas, and feels weak in his legs.
from me,” Dean demands, and Castiel wrenches his entire body around gaining him another foot of distance from Dean, panting in the exertion and agony.
“Alright, ignore previous orders,” Dean says, annoyed, and Castiel lets his body relax. “They’re literal, I guess.”
Dean leaves the room saying he needs to grab some equipment, so Castiel says sitting on the metal bed with his grace intact in his bloodless shirt, shredded by Dean’s work. Cas isn’t sure when Dean’s coming back.
“Or you could trust me,” you say, unsure why it matters at all, but feeling something bright burn in your chest. It’s now a challenge, and you don’t want to back down.
“That looks like...”
He realises then, that this is all fool’s gold. He feels bizarrely numb.
Dean frequently enjoys stabbing Castiel in the chest just to remark how much more
“You mean when I told you to leave my bedroom when you, uh when you decided you were done with me?”
“Yeah, pretty sure that matters Cas. That’s the lojack in the enemy’s car, we gotta hone in on it.”
Dean often also says things to him, usually just mocking him, but often also how
, distracted him from whatever point or apologies he was trying to wring out of this.
“Alright,” you say. Dean looks at you like he always does, like you’re the funniest riddle he’s ever seen. Gives you a bit of a smile, and you melt. You wonder how long it’s been like that. How many millions of years have people found cosmic significance in another creature with an expiration date of time that seems like a blink of an eye to you.
“I got some Melatonin and antihistamines,” Dean says. “They might help with sleep. Melatonin does jack shit for me, but antihistamines sometimes knock me out when I have a bad cold. They might help you get used to it before adjusting?”
him, which somehow gives him solace, but living with the ex angel that just broke your fucking heart? Dean drinks more. Tries to forget what Cas sounds like when he’s coming.
The world morphs, suddenly, ghastly greens and dark colours, and you hear screaming and screaming, but the most notable sensation is the sudden stabbing sensation through your arms and your feet. It’s terrifying; you forgot, you forgot how bad it is. You’re so stupid. You shouldn’t have been so reckless with your life. You shouldn’t have knowingly let yourself die just because you couldn’t stand it anymore.
“Oh, okay,” Cas says, and he’s smiling something beautiful. Small and so so sincere.
“Were you serious,” he eventually says, his hands still under your shirt, feeling your body (or Jimmy’s, you suppose, but he’s gone and your true body is in shambles). “About wanting to...” He gestured towards his crotch.
“I thought you were going to kill me,” Dean says again, and he sounds haunted this time, and it makes the bite of the cut suddenly too painful to handle. Dean’s been hurt by him, Dean wants to
just buy it himself. But Dean also feels like it
Castiel reacts fast, kicks the stool out, causing Dean to stumble and Castiel’s whole body to slip. The pain is sharper than ever, his arms spasming, his wounds bleeding fresh, the board behind him sounding on the platform. But he’s always been good at ignoring pain when he’s in a fight rather lost in his own mind and monotony, so he trips Dean fast, trying to get him down and close to Cas so he can get the key. Dean seems frazzled, shoving Cas, who’s any difference in balance causes him to cry out in pain. It takes a second before Dean seems to remember himself, to which he finally just stops moving at all.
“I don’t know how all this works, Dean,” you say, feeling overwhelmed, suddenly wanting out of this situation entirely, despite how much your body is reacting to him.
“So are we, are we good? Because I got to admit, I don’t know what the hell I’m doing here,” Dean says.
He keeps having memories hit him, knock him off guard, split open his psyche with pain, and he sobs, he’s fucking sobbing, and it doesn’t fucking matter. He needs to go to a bar, where he’s not alone, but not surrounded by people who know, so he won’t be this expressive and simply get piss drunk. But he doesn’t have the energy for it. Not when he’s remembering what Cas looked like the night before they went to trap Raphael. The light in his eyes. The affection.
“Better?”
“You barely tortured me for five minutes, I’ve had worse, Bela, it’s okay,” you say, taking pity on her.
The first thing Dean does when Castiel gets back from the empty is lie to him. The second thing he does is kiss him. The second thing is what cements in that this isn’t actually Dean, but a concoction of the empty. But he throws that thought aside because it’s not something he can prove or disprove, and it’s really hard to focus on anything but the Dean in front of him. It feels real. It feels too real to be real. He lets himself fall into it being real.
And Dean doesn’t really even know how to look him in the eye.
“I just really don’t want this to end,” Cas says again, and Dean’s a little unsure where that’s coming from.
He definitely doesn’t expect Dean to just be sitting there, at the kitchen table, at 5:34 am, with a hollow look on his face.
him. He has to have something wrong. He can’t think because of the way Dean’s lips on his make everything focused solely on them, on the way they feel, the sound in the room of them together, but his thoughts still race somewhere underneath, fears about the vague concept of the weather outside, the room Dean’s offering him, the sandwich, the fact Dean would never want him as himself, the fact Cas has to have this twisted, and it turns the sensations into something overwhelming in a way that makes him feel sick.
“Bela?
“I, uh, got your room set up for you, redid your bedding,” Dean says. Castiel’s hand shakes as he goes to grab a cup.
“Well what’s stopping you?” Dean asks. Cas stalls, eyes widening from their glare. “I mean I’m sorry, for being an ass, alright? Want to take a shot?” He pauses, wondering if Cas will. “Is that what you want?”
Though he does decide to leave the room because Cas has basically no food, and he thinks he should pick up some melatonin and some over-the-counter sleep aid. It’s gotten dark out, and he doesn’t mention it, but he also wants to grab some beer as well, even if he doesn’t plan on getting very drunk. He is concerned he’ll fail at his tenuous promise at hand the second shit goes south because what else would he do? But he never promised sobriety, and he used to drink all the time and blackouts weren’t super common.
You almost feel safe then, like the two of you
“That’s what someone who is lying would say.” You’re taken aback by it, but then Dean actually smirks at you. Rolls his eyes. “Okay, Cas just, open your mouth.”
mission. I told you, I’m not letting you die a virgin, it’s not right,” he says. “Like, that’s. That’s not happening, buddy.”
“Maybe later,” he says. You nod, a little uncertain on his plan, but then he’s kissing you again, and you honestly do not care.
It’s funny, how much worse you’ve been. How much more of a wreck. You’ve lost Cas before. Maybe that’s why. Maybe your whole being is just on pause for him. Waiting. Shouldn’t he show up any minute? And why isn’t Jack saying “hello”? Did you really fuck everything up that much?
So you are.
You know this.
Their first night together, Castiel clutched onto him in their bed still panting and numb with pleasure, listened to Dean hum Kashmir with his head on his shoulder, and cursed himself for his weakness. The tattoo on the left side of Dean’s chest was missing, but Castiel still traced where it would have been with his fingertips. Dean flinched away from his feather-light touch, laughed sweetly into his bedmate’s sweaty hair, and Castiel closed his eyes against the rush of emotion.
There’s a noise, a whisper of air across the back of Castiel’s neck, and he sits up straighter. The presence hovering over him seems to dissipate and is replaced with eyes on the back of his neck. Castiel feels watched for the first time in a very long time. He feels seen.
It wasn’t enough.
, he drifted off quicker than he had in days; weeks, months, years?
But he knows the truth, has known for a long time, and even the feeling of cold lips against his forehead doesn’t pull him from his spiral.
But Dean stood at the kitchen sink, watering the plants in the windowsill above the basin, lips curled into an easy smile but not moving. Castiel blinked, focused on the rasp of air slowly filling his lungs, and blinked again to find the kitchen bathed in shadow. The stove light shone a faint glow across the tiled floor and, to Castiel, the shadows cast across the countertops almost seemed darker.
he decides.
Castiel thought Dean wasn’t a morning person, pushed hard at his foggy memories to pull a morning spent in bed from his head, but there was nothing there.
He tells you things that make you angry.
you once held in the depths of your home.
He is a blur, a vague outline of a man. His skin is a blank canvas, freckles or scars nonexistent, and his face is blank, wiped of emotion or identifiable features. He looks like a mannequin, with limp plain clothes draped over his body. Even his eyes, something Castiel once held so close, are reduced to black pits. The thing that stands over him seems to attempt a smile, its blank face twisting unpleasantly.
You clutch them close and whisper his name into the darkness that still feels
He blinks and three white boxes sit on that brown patch of grass like they’d always been there. He begins to wonder if he’s mistaken.
Much, much later but not quite as late as now, Castiel wondered if he had been forgetting since the beginning, losing the details that made Dean
Others that were less broken, less loving.
Castiel is forgetting.
He is soft.
There are many like you.
“Dean,” Cas whispers, and Dean finally takes him home. In this sandbox of Castiel's own mind, a goldfinch chirps.
Like the strong man that lays across your bed and doesn’t find sleep. The man who, instead, finds peace in the touch of your lips and the caress of your calloused hands.
He thought you were beautiful.
He thought you were
He thought you were kind.
cycle, but it raises its tiny head and seems to peer up at him with one eye. Castiel shivers in his chair, hands curling into loose fists on the tabletop. It’s unsettling to be watched so intensely by something without a soul, a being that is little more than a husk of an animal, but the eye contact holds until he turns his attention to the window and the yard that lays beyond.
The house was quiet, not even the sound of wood settling reaching Castiel’s ears, and he decided that Dean must have been out for the night. When he fell asleep curled up between sheets that smelled of smoke, worn leather, and
There’s something wrong, something off about he’s seeing, and he squints and leans forward until his nose nearly touches the glass. The sun is still bright like it always is, and his eyes strain against the light but he doesn’t stop searching; the green grass, the tall trees, and the little patch of brown where his hives usually sit-
“I’m just saying, buddy, you’ve done a lot of shit,” Dean says, and Cas can’t tell if he sounds sweet or patronising. It feels like punishment regardless. “You think you can really take making up for that?” The world feels very dark with that, like sharp red slashes against the centre of it. Castiel swallows.
He’s desperately trying to catch his breath when he flinches from a soft hand in his hair before he lets himself lean into it.
“It’s clearly not nothing,” Dean says. “You’re thinking about what that bitch April did, right?”
Dean and Cas sit really close together while watching the movie (Die Hard), and Dean is so close to Cas and it reminds him of all the times they’ve watched movies together (yes, they had already watched Die Hard, but Cas offered to watch it, and Dean wasn’t going to say no). Dean doesn’t know how to move closer to Cas though. He wants to touch him, but there’s a blaring in his head that says he can’t, still, as if they’re still stuck in time.
It's a bleary night, and Dean’s pulled over to the side of the road in some part of rural America. The moon dimly hits his face.
