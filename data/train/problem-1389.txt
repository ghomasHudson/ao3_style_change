“There’s a quick and pleasant way to handle your nerves.”
John cut off with a howl when Sherlock slid two more fingers in.
He ate it in three big bites, core and all.
“The shower is more than big enough to accommodate us both, John. Surely you’ve showered with lovers before.”
Sherlock dragged himself in, took the phone, and flopped miserably on his bed.
“It doesn’t have to be something you use with me,” Sherlock said soothingly. “It can be a souvenir you take home. Have you ever tried one?”
intelligence than you could ever hope to have in this lifetime or the next.”
“That would be the dissonance, no doubt. Clearly not a song meant to ease one’s troubles.”
“And you won’t want to live here, I can tell, you have to be in London. So I have to go back to London. But when I get there...Mor—
“Yes?”
“Absolutely not. I was flying under the radar as an illegal sex worker; once I--AH--
“Just fucking drink it.”
“Quite understandable. And under no circumstances can he return.”
When he got to the street, John stopped, breathing hard. Sherlock watched from just inside the hotel, through the glass door. John looked around, then stared down at the pavement. After a moment, he seemed to come to a decision, and he walked out of the alley, turned left on 3
And then he felt John’s hand at his cock, and the horrible strap was unsnapped, and he let out a yell as what seemed like hours of want and agony spilled out of his cock in surge after surge of hot jets of liquid, and John was pumping into him, saying “Yes, yes, come for me darling, yes…”
He stared at the door in the wall that led to the adjoining room.
John felt something touch his lips and he automatically opened his jaws. He felt blood pounding in his cock as something smooth and fat was pressed slowly into his mouth, above his tongue. When he closed his lips around it, he realized it felt like a spongy cock. At first it tasted vaguely silicone-ish, but soon it had no flavor at all. He sucked on it, and it was deeply satisfying.
--AH!”
He felt the barest flick inside and his whole body arched in time with his cock leaping away from his abdomen.
“No ma’am, we’re fine, thanks,” John answered. She was busy enough that she nodded and moved on. No police officers bothered to ask them any questions. John was glad. He wouldn’t have had the first idea what to say.
“John, Molly taught me to meditate. She taught me to value myself when I had given up. She was—” Sherlock hesitated for a fraction of a second. “She was the only one who saw me as a person instead of a dirty drug-addicted whore. Including myself. I owe my life to her.”
Johnny took a big swallow of milk.
They both looked startled at the endearment.
“—press deep into you, over and over, letting you feel how we are joined together in a way that no one can ever understand or tear apart?”
“‘Oh, we had fun, I got my rocks off, but now I need to go fuck some other girls, bye,’” John interpreted.
The little car jumped into motion. Sherlock whipped onto New Montgomery Street and began a series of deft maneuvers in and out of Friday night traffic, zipping down alleys and twisting in various directions so that it was not obvious where they were headed.
“There we go, much better.” He gave the bound cock a few little pats; Sherlock growled. John saw that Sherlock seemed to be emerging from the state he’d entered as John had restrained him. John wanted to keep him off balance; a diabolical plan bloomed in his mind.
Johnny was always drawn to the woods, and after losing his way that fateful night, his dad taught him serious woodscraft--how to find edible plants, how to build a structure from downed branches, how to navigate, with or without a compass. Johnny and his dad began camping every weekend, sometimes just a few meters from the house, sometimes driving to the coast, just to be outdoors and in the quiet of nature.
“Do you want to discuss it now?”
“I don’t even really know what it’s supposed to feel like,” Sherlock reflected. “I prepare myself for clients. I have to be loose enough not to be damaged, but tight enough so they feel like they’re taking me for the first time. I learned that if I loosen myself with three fingers and then squeeze, I can usually simulate the experience they want without tearing. There was only one time I had to be taken off rotation for two days.”
Sherlock grinned and went to retrieve the toy bag from where it had ended up in the corner. After some rummaging, he came back with two lengths of purple rope and a left-handed pair of safety scissors. He gave the scissors to John; then he circled the rope around the top of one of John’s thighs. As he did so, his hand brushed underneath, against John’s very stiff erection, and he smiled to himself.
“Surely they will have planned for this?”
“This was his Berlin phase. He was doing some serious soul-searching, with Brian Eno’s help, actually. Eno did the ambient piece earlier, with Harold Budd.”
“I was, until you interfered.”
“That was stupid.”
John wasn’t getting much sleep. He had classes during the day: Algebra, Intro to Computer Programming, Chemistry, and, inexplicably, English. He wasn’t sure what reading Louisa May Alcott had to do with medicine, but it was a mandatory class, so he suffered it with as much good grace as he could muster. Each of those classes had homework, and there was physical training to complete in the afternoons, and he had volunteered to work a six-hour shift five nights a week. His hospital shifts were intensely physical; as an orderly he mopped and scrubbed, lifted patients, moved boxes of supplies and heavy machinery for the nurses, and basically did any scut work anyone else didn’t want to do.
The child ignored the nameplate, which read “G. Lestrade”.
John was a puzzle. And it made Sherlock’s heart sing. It had been

“I’m using a simple reef knot here, John, and I’ll use the same under the bed. But you’re welcome to just cut the rope if you want out; it’s inexpensive and we can always buy more.” He finished tying the first knot and slipped two fingers under the rope to make sure it wasn’t too tight.
Sherlock sulked.
“It’s simple; let me teach you.” Sherlock opened John’s chopsticks for him and shifted his chair closer to John’s.
“What…what did it feel like?” she asked quietly, and she had to clear her throat a little.
“Yes.”

“You must not have been paying attention.”
“I’ve
“Would you like tea?” A young woman started pouring Oolong into their handleless cups before they could respond. “Ready to order?”
John let out a deep sigh. “No, I don’t, really. She’s not my favorite person. She’s a mean drunk, just like Daddy. And she took it out on me, and she took it out on Clara, and then she took it out on little Raina, and that’s when I stopped talking to her. I know it’s the cycle, and I know she’s trying to break it, but you just don’t...you don’t…” John took in a shaky breath.
“Play with your feet?! Sherlock--”
around his cock, the bastard, and slung a forearm over his hips, pinning him to the bed.
I’m so sorry to say this, but we won’t be able to come up to parents day. Your Da has to work on Saturday, he’s taking extra shifts to try to make ends meet. We didn’t get the loan. I’m afraid I don’t have the money for the petrol to make the trip myself. But we’ll be thinking of you that day and every day, you can bet on that, love.
Johnny’s army training:
“Naw, Fi, have you?”
“I know,” came a muffled voice from the pillow. “I’ll try.”
“You had a lot of tension built up. Now, slide under the covers and get some rest.”
“Yes, John, don’t all prostitutes do drugs? That’s what you think I am, don’t you? A common prostitute?”
“Well who was it then?”
John rolled his shoulders and rubbed at his face. “This is all very interesting, but a benefactor spent quite a lot of money to send me to this conference, and the NHS is paying my salary for this week expecting me to come back informed of the latest drug discoveries and general practice techniques, so regardless of how
“I can’t imagine that they are thinking of anyone but themselves in those final moments. Quick, John, the second tower.”
“FUR IS MURDER!”
“John, give me the gag and tell me how you are doing.”
“Some people think he was Pan, a woodland demigod. Pan is a mythical creature that plays pipes. You remember those pipes they played at the festival last month?”
“Tomorrow, John,
“What happened, Sherlock? What set this off?” He knew this might trigger Sherlock again, but he and Molly were there to watch over him, and he needed to know.
“Johnny Watson? Isn’t he a little...I dunno…” Brandi waved her hands above the covers in an altogether vague manner.
They continued to bicker as they paid the bill and wandered outside. They were headed back towards the hotel when the hairs on the back of John’s neck stood up. A split-second later he pushed Sherlock down behind a concrete barrier next to the road and fell behind him; a half-second after that, there was a
“This has been a bit much of a day. Do you think we could go to bed early?”
Sherlock reached down into his bag and pulled out a strap of leather embedded with a metal snap.
“Don’t lie down; you need to hydrate.”
“No, wait, I need to show this to you. She just said ‘Biology is a science that any child can study,’ right? Now, what if you want to hear it again? You push this button and it rewinds, and you can hear it again.” The book man made the box whirr again, then pushed the voice button.
Sherlock moaned in relief at the stimulation, which felt vibrant after minutes of being so still. He could feel his cock jerking between them, in John’s grip, in response to the pinching on his tender nipple. The tongue fucking was incredibly erotic, even though John was only moving in and out a few centimetres. Sherlock stayed motionless, afraid to do anything that would stop John’s actions, and this made him feel helpless—entirely at John’s mercy. When John pinched at the nipple with his fingernails, the pain was startling, magnified far beyond what it would have warranted outside this strange interlude, and Sherlock felt his cock leak pre-cum onto his stomach.
“Here we are.” Sherlock pulled off at an exit in Novato. A few turns, and he was in the car park of a McDonald’s.
Mycroft held back a sigh.
John took a deep breath. “I’m serious. I’m going to give it a try.
Sherlock closed his eyes and bit his lower lip.
John blinked.

Their agent was shouting at the mob to get out of the way and let them through. Her voice carried and would have been instantly obeyed in a more orderly, quieter situation. She was also using her elbows and knees effectively.
“Psychosomatic, Doctor. A pain of the mind responds well to the placebo effect. I was confident with the massage and made you believe that it would work.”
“Thank you.” John took the glass and sat down on the couch, completely overwhelmed. He gulped at the water.
“Sherlock? What’s wrong?”
Sherlock snuck a slippery finger under John and pushed the tip right up against his pucker.
Thanks for the all the care packages! I always share the cookies with all the boys, but the ginger beer is just for me.

injured Sherlock, but almost immediately his doctor ethics kicked in and he realized he should have checked on the young man, made sure that he was okay before he left the hotel.
“Where is he now?”
, regardless of the branch they will be going into later.
Sherlock steered John towards the small collection of anal plugs against one wall.
“Mm-hm?”
“Okay then. Right. Well.” Lestrade absorbed all this for some moments. Fawnlock watched him calmly.
“Hm.”
, god, I’m so dirty, I’m filthy, please please please let me feel it—” and then it really devolved into a lot of not-very-understandable mutterings. Sherlock decided there had been plenty of build-up and laid the flat of his tongue directly against John’s pink furl.
Write us when you can, love. We miss you so much.
John nodded again and let Sherlock undress them both down to pants and then help him into bed. Sherlock moved the forgotten carryall to the floor, lay down by John’s side, and pulled him into a hug, stroking John’s hair. Sherlock looked out the windows, where lights were just starting to come on in the nearby skyscrapers, shining fuzzily through the fog. He thought about how far out of his depth he was. For the first time in over a year, he thought of Mycroft and wished he could ask his brother what to do. Mycroft had always understood emotional issues so much better than he.
“Now now, I want to make things easier for you; don’t want you to have to struggle not to ruin our fun.” John bent to wrap the strap around the base of Sherlock’s penis, but he was deliberately inefficient, stroking the shaft, fondling the testicles, and generally making Sherlock’s state more critical before he finally snapped the leather tight around the straining flesh.
“We should probably talk about what happened tonight, but maybe that can wait until tomorrow. It’s been a pretty tiring day for both of us.”
John hummed in agreement, which made Sherlock pedal his legs against the bed. John concentrated on the heavy feeling of Sherlock against his tongue, filling his mouth. It had been so long. His own cock throbbed at the feeling of sucking on something warm and throbbing. He felt alive; he felt aroused. He felt connected to another human being. It was fantastic.
“Oh, hi, you must be, uh, Fawnlock? Is that what Greg said? You’re here to practice chemistry?” A human woman wearing a white overcoat appeared in front of him; he hadn’t noticed her in his ecstatic scan of this wonderful room of possibilities. Her long, glossy brown hair distracted him for a moment, but he quickly lost interest in that and began to open cabinets, noting the contents and nodding to himself happily.
“I’m going to give you a full-body massage, John. Non-sexual, of course.”
Greg sighed and with a last, lingering look at Molly, turned to ascend the stairs. Fawnlock also sighed, albeit internally. For all his bluster, he had been quite worried that the humans would not allow him access to this palace of science. There was a tiny smile on his face as he started up the Bunsen burner, just the way the textbook said to.
“I want you in me.”
“I dunno. It feels…”
“Do you want to go out or order room service,” he asked flatly.
John looked at him accusingly.
thought Mycroft. Oh well, Joaquin didn’t usually have very inspired ideas anyway. He was sure Joaquin would back up whatever they decided the next night.
Sherlock pulled all the way off and John wanted to cry.
“You’ve decided to use all my services except the sexual. A mistake, if you ask me; I’m quite good. Well, that’s an understatement. Your decision is a bit of a disappointment; but, as promised, you have not hurt my feelings, and I want you to be comfortable. What would you like to do next? A shower, perhaps, or maybe a luxury bath with salts and aromatherapy? Some television with a beer? Perhaps you feel tired from the flight; maybe a foot rub? I could work on that psychosomatic pain in your leg.”
“Well, far be it from me to tell a grown man that he cannot move to London, I suppose.” John smiled at Sherlock, and Sherlock gave him a warm smile back.

“Sensation play?”
Sherlock glanced up from where he was making John’s balls very, very wet.
John felt unexpectedly proud at that.

“Come come John, we haven’t got all night.” As John fumbled for his wallet, Sherlock scoffed and pulled out a thick roll of cash. He paid the bill and handed the cashier a $100 bill.
“It was completely a strop and I did not need stitches.”
“No sir, Dr Watson. You just hold tight and we’ll get you that tea.”
“I think I would like to talk a bit, if that’s okay,” he said under the heavy beat of some techno music.
“Oh...oh...oh…” Sherlock kept making little moans as he collapsed, limp, against the bed, staring up at the ceiling, unseeing.
“And then something bad happened...all of a sudden I felt really sad, and empty. And then Sherlock left the bed and I thought I was going to die. I know it sounds melodramatic but that’s how it felt.”
“You still haven’t come,” muttered John.
John was panting, hard. Sherlock watched him for a full minute and a half.
“Trust me, once we’re past this bit, it’s much easier to find an easy-off, easy-on exit.”
This file was created using Audacity.
“No.”
“HEY! That was
“Thank you, though I do not guess. May I work on your leg?” Sherlock helped John turn so that he was leaning back against the arm of the couch, his bare legs stretched onto Sherlock’s lap. Sherlock rubbed some scent-free oil from a small bottle onto his hands and began stroking softly over the skin of the recalcitrant leg. He ran his fingertips up and down the calf and knee, over and over, and then began the massage proper, using just the right pressure—firm, but not painfully so. John watched as skilled fingers carefully probed between the muscles, stimulating the blood flow and releasing the phantom ache.
John dropped his head back onto the “cradle”. He had a stunning view of the room’s thick pewter-coloured carpet. It made him uncomfortable not to see what was going on.
“That’s good.” Sherlock’s voice was low and soothing, complementary to the slow, gentle press of his hands around John’s body. They were quiet for a while, as John felt every inch of exposed skin being caressed gently and deliberately.
When John’s breathing eased a bit, he continued.
“Oi, Sherlock. Let’s go out instead.”
Sherlock groaned and arched his back.
The whole thing took just over a minute.

John marched straight to the coffee machine and started pouring fresh water in.
“It’s okay, you drifted off,” Sherlock said quietly, having to clear his throat first.
“You play the violin?”

Johnny stood up.
“That you’ll let me care for you until you are back on your feet.”
“I’m afraid I was left rather…wanting…from the experience," Sherlock murmured. "Care to help me resolve my problem?”
Sherlock smiled down at him, not realizing there was a touch of sadness in his eyes. The moment was already gone.
He was very suddenly un-bored.
Now Sherlock turned all the way around to confront Molly.
“Yeah, I’d like a Moons Over My Hammy, please?”
“There’s nothing to keep you here. The young human let you down, as I knew he would. Come home, and I will provide you with things to keep your mind busy.”
“I told you: I observe, Doctor. You do an excellent job of compensating for it, but your gait is slightly off—most people wouldn’t notice—and you hold the opposite shoulder a bit higher in compensation. You also hold it higher due to the real injury you retained in that shoulder when you were in service, most likely in Afghanistan or Iraq. You look annoyed when your leg twinges, as it did in the elevator; you look pained when your shoulder hurts, as it did when you removed your satchel. The leg pain is a psychological response to a real, traumatic injury to the shoulder.”
“A far-away place where we should be able to hide while we try to figure out what

Joaquin’s whiskers twitched as he gave Mycroft one of his large, optimistic smiles.
“Of course I do!”
Sherlock opened his eyes and looked up into John’s. His pupils were wide and dark. “No...no, it was delicious, it just tipped over the edge. I’ll tell you if it gets to be too much again.”
Sherlock gave John a glower, which made him snicker. John began pressing the scan button on the radio again. The scanner found an angry man ranting about “homaseck-shals”, a sprightly Mexican song, a commercial for donating a car to a questionable charity, and an absolute torment of a pop song.
John pushed the heels of his hands against his closed eyes.
Fawnlock looked so upset that Lestrade reached out and patted his arm, tentatively.
for Phase 2 RAMC-oriented training. When it comes to what would happen during Phase 2 training, I am, unfortunately, totally guessing. If anyone has more accurate knowledge, let me know and I’ll update the story!
Johnny was fascinated.
Sherlock called a delivery joint and ordered curries and a masala, naans and papadums, samosas and pakoras. Within ten minutes, there was a knock at the door.
…like the orgasms you give me when you edge me for hours…it was decadent, incredibly naughty yet shameless; I felt completely fulfilled in my entire body, down to my stick-like toes and my hair-thin antennae. It was like being one giant fuzzy stimulated nerve. And then I just knew it was time to lift off, and I was flying again…
Sherlock tucked his shoulder under John’s good arm and pulled him to his feet. They stumbled to the room and into the bathroom, where Sherlock placed John on the closed toilet lid.
air drying.” He grabbed Sherlock’s hands and dragged him off the bed and tried to dance him around.
“None of your objectives were met.”
Fog was drifting over the hill when John finally took a deep breath and nuzzled against Sherlock.
“No. Just, uh, too much thinking.”
“Oh you will, will you?”
A few minutes later they were sat on the couch, tea cups in hand. Sherlock had pulled John’s feet into his lap.
“So I has to come out and say it, right? So I’m like ‘Yeah, well, Johnny, I wantcha to do it with me, Alice says you’re real good with first-timers.’ And he kinda smiles, like kinda almost sad, and he says ‘Yeah, we can do that if you’re sure, but it’s just th’ one time, see? It’s not gonna lead t'anything. I’ll show you how but then you gotta go find someone else to fall in love with.’ But, like, Alice warned me beforehand, that’s what Johnny does; he shows girls how to do it and then talks ‘em through findin’ a proper boyfriend, right? So I was ready for that.”
“Did he grind him?”
Instead, he began rapping lightly on Sherlock’s fruit-covered nipple with the bowl of the spoon while he dug into the navel with his tongue. Sherlock moaned softly. He hit the nipple harder and began rubbing the other, already abused nipple with the pad of his free thumb.
Sherlock put his hand over John’s right hand, and John let go to tangle his fingers with Sherlock’s.

A new song began playing. It was sparse and haunting; Sherlock found himself impressed by the band’s willingness to incorporate elements of silence and space into the music.

This had led him to stalking many other human campsites. He begged Moosecroft to teach him human-speak, but Moosecroft refused, saying that humans were far too dangerous and that he didn’t want Fawnlock studying them or, indeed, going anywhere near them.
John nodded vigorously, his mouth full.
“Is it?”
"Not too many people break into libraries. Not a high demand for old paper."

“Oh god, Sherlock, I don’t think I’m going to last…”

John rolled over to face the window. He didn’t want Sherlock to see the flare of anger he felt at his new friend having been so used. Of course it wasn’t his place to judge, or even have an opinion on Sherlock’s vocation. He took a few deep breaths and schooled his features before rolling over again.
. I forgot you people have those bloody things out here.”
John found himself naked in bed, engulfed in Sherlock. They were rubbing against each other frantically, pawing and pulling and grabbing and then rolling and moaning until there was a yelp when Sherlock’s hair got caught—“Sorry, sorry!”—and as they shifted to fix that, one of John’s bollocks was a little pinched—“Aaaah!” “Oh gods, are you hurt?” “Yeah, a bit…” “Here, let me kiss it better”—and then Sherlock’s head was between John’s legs, arms wrapped around his thighs, licking the skin of each of John’s testicles so gently and carefully that John let his knees fall open and whined at how quickly his cock lifted to full hardness.
Sherlock drew off slowly, squeezing with his tongue as he went, pulling two more aftershocks out of John before he finally lifted his head, grinning. He rubbed his thumbs gently over John’s hard nipples.
The woman from the Zen Center came running over to him and grabbed his arm. Tonight she was dressed in jeans and a rather tight black t-shirt. Her shining brown hair was loose around her shoulders, and she wore a necklace with a small double-headed axe on it.
Sherlock beamed at him.
Fawnlock did not deign to reply, but he watched the rest of the heart dissection with rapt attention. Molly smiled to herself. It was always magical to be present when someone learned something, especially something that changed their worldview.
“Oh God, so good, John. Amazing. Yes. Keep doing that, keep reacting, keep vocalizing. You are a natural; you are so, so good.”
“Your ejaculate, this time. In case you were worried.”
“This is a common area for tension to build,” he said conversationally. “But I’ve never felt anyone so tight here as you are. A lot of your emotion is being carried up in here. Your laptop screen is too low on your desk; you bend your head to look at it. Do you get migraines? Yes, that’s unsurprising. As you know, that can come from neck tension, carrying up through the sheath of muscle that wraps over your skull. It wouldn’t hurt to have someone do this for you on a regular basis. And you should move your laptop up so that the top of the screen is level with your forehead when you are sitting up.”
; he had a
“Come on, let’s initiate you into the open expression of sexuality in San Francisco.” Sherlock tugged him up to the counter and bought the thing, chatting easily with a middle-aged woman who looked like a classic librarian—glasses and somewhat frumpy hair, bright arm tattoos notwithstanding—who handed Sherlock a bag (after charging him twenty-five cents extra) and a complimentary packet of lube.
“You too, John…”
Thanks as always to my beta,
“Well then.” Sherlock smiled, and John took a deep breath, and then he grasped Sherlock’s hand. He awkwardly march-stepped out of his pants as he moved to the bed. Once they were settled back on the fitted sheet, Sherlock kicked the comforter and top sheet out of the way.
John’s face was pale. Clearly Sherlock had skimmed over quite a lot when he said, casually, “six months later, I had to leave London.”
Sherlock buckled the cuff around it and checked the tightness with his finger, slipping it between the cuff and John’s wrist. Then he rotated the cuff around John, letting him feel the soft fur-like material slipping against his skin. John closed his eyes and concentrated. It was a little alarming, feeling the cuff there. Any moment, Sherlock could attach it to something, lock him down, imprison him.
“I’m going to wash my hands,” Sherlock said quietly. “Take a few minutes just to rest.”
“All right! Fine!”
John laughed, and Sherlock smiled, and things felt normal again.
He saw Halifa sigh because her sigh was so heavy it was audible, but he ignored it; he was using the somewhat self-aggrandizing language deliberately. In an unprecedented event such as this, the fact that he held the seat of the Power was important to emphasize.
Sherlock began to move his fingers in and out of John, slowly. More incoherent howling happened. Sherlock couldn’t wait any longer; he crawled up until his groin was flush with his wrist and started humping in time with his thrusts. He needed to get inside John so badly that he felt like he could taste it; it tasted like copper and coconuts. Some part of him realized this was not logical; the rest of him was focused on the plight of his cock.
“God knows Mycroft isn’t going to do it.”
Shostakovich "Prelude No. 24 in D Minor"
The most interesting case had come from the most annoying source: Moosecroft.
He opened his eyes to see Sherlock watching him carefully. After a moment, Sherlock nodded, as if to himself, and pulled another cuff from the bag. John held up his other arm, and the new cuff was attached to his other wrist. He held his two wrists together, looking at them. If Sherlock wanted—if John was a different person—perhaps Sherlock would lock these cuffs together, in front of him, or maybe behind him, where it would be harder to get out of them. What would that feel like? John had been shot in Afghanistan, but never captured...he had had plenty of nightmares about that, but he knew that he was quite lucky never to have actually undergone that particular ordeal. He felt a little guilty at wondering about the feeling of being handcuffed, and he pulled his arms back to his sides.
me. I want your cock
John looked up at him. “I don’t know.”
“That is definitely okay. Just don’t break the skin.”
“Seen you around. Wanna be a medic?”
. Why didn’t you fucking tell me, you goddamn berk?” John was furious, but he pulled Sherlock’s other foot to his lap with doctor-gentle hands and began treating it.
“It won’t happen.”
“You should be held every night, dear John,” he whispered.
The deer boy looked interested but didn’t respond.
Things became hazy, and it seemed they sat there for hours, though the sun was still high in the sky when Johnny’s vision cleared for a moment. He felt the deer boy’s arms tighten around him.
“On the contrary, Lestrade. With items that matter, I am exceedingly deft,” Fawnlock pronounced, his back to the two as he peered into the chemicals cabinet. Greg rolled his eyes.
“Nonsense.”
“For the documents, John! And also to shake any tails we may have.”
“Hay,” the boy repeated absently, turning the wet pages.
“‘Don’t Look Back,’ indeed,” Sherlock muttered.
“I want to forego condoms.”
“Okay, try again. Now you’ll see why oriental rice is sticky.”
Sherlock ran his fingertips delicately over the skin of John’s face and moved on to full-hand smoothing over his arms, his chest and belly, and then skipped down to his legs and feet.
Sherlock couldn’t hold back a smile at how delighted John was with this checklist of choices.
Mycroft's agent's car was parking a slight distance away. John wondered if the woman would stop them from committing a felony or just let them do what they would do.
“Well, it was pretty weird, I’ll say that. Though it didn’t feel weird at all at the time.”
John sighed. “Sherlock. C’mon. Up up. Drink.”
“John. John. Please forgive me. I didn’t think. I knew he would do it, but then I forgot. All I was thinking about was you. Mycroft won’t—he won’t show it to anyone; he won’t share it. He won’t ever mention it. He’s not like that. He...he just wants to know that his security is working.
“Got one thing wrong, though.”
“Not true!”
And then he was engulfed in warmth, in wet, a tongue stroking him—
“Quiet, John, I’m navigating!”
But that was nothing compared to being handed power by someone he really cared for—
Sherlock held John steady by his hips.
John started to protest—this whole tea service thing wasn’t his idea—but Maureen was already on her walkie talkie, and she’d been through enough; it seemed impolite to decline.
Wiggins and Angela were hurrying towards them when the crowd seemed to melt away, leaving just a man and a woman, both wearing a black suit and dark sunglasses. There was a prominent gun bulge under each their jackets and communications equipment in their ears.
“Much better, thank you. How were you able to massage out an imaginary ache?”
“No. Group. No.” He began to back away.
“Oh, where she falls into the water?”
He rose and knocked at Sherlock’s door. It opened immediately. Sherlock stepped back into his room and gazed at him for a moment.
“What? Is another car following us?”
Now with art from the fabulous
Sherlock started kissing John’s neck, and John realized that Sherlock was chanting “John, John, John,” almost sub-audibly, in-between kisses. Daringly, he bent his head and mouthed at Sherlock’s left trapezius muscle, then bit down lightly.

They stared at each other, at an impasse.
"What? What is it?"
Fawnlock stared at the path through the trees where Johnny had walked away, and he kept staring for hours after he was gone.
“‘But what do the words mean?’ asked the wondering Mole.
,” Fawnlock said urgently.
“What pun?”
“Is that what my brother paid for?” Sherlock sneered as soon as they were inside. Wiggins and Angela were gaping at the newcomers.
“All right.” Sherlock sat on the sofa and looked up expectantly. “Yes?”
human had left him. Johnny was the entire reason he wanted to know anything about the humans in the first place. When he vanished, Fawnlock saw no reason to continue his study.
“Yeah, those were pretty.”
The Flying Fox Person chuckled and her image moved until her orientation matched Mycroft’s.
“Hay,” the boy said happily. He began pawing at the rest of the bag’s contents.
John watched Sherlock literally stomp a foot and had to turn his head to smother a smile.
“Emotion is a barrier to clear thought. Caring is not an advantage.”
“Johnny? Who’s Johnny?”

“I’ll call for—”
Eventually, he managed to settle John in the tub with hot water filling it. He stepped into the tub in front of John, heedless of his Farragamos, and bent down to hold John’s face firmly in both hands.
“Neuro-typical brains do indeed respond to cocaine as a stimulant. I find that it quiets my racing thoughts and allows me to focus and become more effective. It’s similar to the reverse calming effect of Ritalin on ADD sufferers’ brains.”
John shifted to licking the webbing between Sherlock’s toes, which made Sherlock twitch and snicker. John held Sherlock’s ankle steady so there wouldn’t be any accidental kicking.
“Wait, John! I don’t know your room number!”
“Tell me more about this escape plan, and about how Maureen knew about it.”
“Would you like to go out for dinner, or would you like to have it brought to your room tonight?”
“Oh! That gives me vertigo! Oh, ha ha...I wonder if that’s what gave Hitchcock the idea…”
Johnny realized he was shivering uncontrollably.
Fawnlock looked at Moosecroft sharply.
“I don’t know,” John wailed in the midst of unhappy giggles. “It’s ticklish, and it’s embarrassing, and I really want it, but I don’t know how people do it. I mean, for god’s sake, Sherlock, it’s where
When John had done his best to try to eat up Sherlock’s stomach, sides, and armpits, he slid over to Sherlock’s chest, and they both stopped laughing as his lips connected with one of Sherlock’s nipples. Sherlock gasped and John stilled, his teeth holding the nub firmly but gently in their grasp.
“Almost certainly.”
[postmarked AFC Harrogate, 26 September 1991]
There's a playlist to go along with this chapter:
John was horrified to find his eyes tearing up, and he swiped at them with his knuckles in frustration.
“Are you saying you didn’t enjoy it?”
“Quite. And you must find me a lab where I can practice chemistry. I am certain I will be proficient at the work.”
Sherlock slid a keycard into the reader and opened the door to a suite that looked to be larger than John’s entire flat back home. He wandered around the room, admiring the modern design and the pretty view of skyscrapers wrapped in fog, with glimpses of the bay beyond.
“Ecstasy!”
“You’re clearly touch-starved. I’ve been trying to alleviate that.”
“Precisely. Zip yourself up and let’s get moving.”
‘spoon’ the operative word, darling. It’s been about 18 hours, I’d say? Don’t worry, my delectable waif. Daddy Jim will take care of you.” Moriarty had run a possessive hand slowly up Sherlock’s inner thigh from knee to crotch and then had boldly caressed his cock through his jeans under the table, stroking firmly until it came to life.
“It would be my pleasure.”
. I started solving crimes again. Did I tell you I did that when I was younger? I would read the newspaper and solve the crimes described therein. I wrote to the police. Well, I started out by telling them, but they wouldn’t listen to a seven-year-old. So I switched to writing them. They thought I was some old coot, a hermit who had a weird hobby. But once in a while they couldn’t ignore me, when I had enough details, and I’d see a few weeks later in the paper that they’d solved their latest unsolvable case, and I’d know it was because of me. I became really adept at sneaking around, finding the clues I needed at crime scenes, at suspects’ homes and offices, putting together the pieces. And I’d write them up and send them in.”
“SHOO! Stay! No, bad deer! Stop following me!” Johnny sniffled and wiped his nose on his wrist, knowing it was anger making him cry a little and not anything stupid like being a baby. He turned and charged towards the other boy a bit, and the deer boy backed up a few steps but never stopped staring at Johnny.
“Of course I have. I just didn't recognize this. It's...striking, anyway.”
Sherlock shifted so that he was sitting beside John, his leg pressed warmly against John’s, and took John’s hand in his.
“How could you know all that?”
“My, don’t I feel special.” But John gave Sherlock a cocky grin and began climbing the steep stairs of the narrow entrance.
Sherlock gave one last thrust, squeezing the last of his come into John, and slowly pulled out.
“Did you like it?”
(“Fuck off, Moosecroft. I don’t need you here.”)
“Sherlock, oh god, I’m so sorry. I...shit.”
Joaquin pondered this for a moment.
“She up and went, Johnny,” his mother confirmed. “Took the car, the telly, the computer, Da’s wallet.”
“You took an anatomy course?”
“FUCK ME, SHERLOCK, fucking fuck me right fucking now or I swear to god I’ll do something we’ll both regret.”
“We leave tomorrow morning, just before dawn. The staff will cause a distraction so that we can escape down the stairs. We’ll just go a couple of flights, in deference to your leg; we can take the freight elevator the rest of the way. Karl will have the car ready for us at the staff entrance. When we leave, we will of course be followed. I am going to take you to Ocean Beach, because you need to see the Pacific from San Francisco before we go.”
John gave up and drank the contents of the cup quickly, coughing afterwards. Sherlock poured him another cup, making it just plain tea this time. He set it on the table in front of John and went back to holding him.

“‘John’, please. If we are going to spend this week together you can’t keep calling me ‘Doctor’.”
“Yeah, I think that’s what he called them. And I’m not really sure what happened after that.”
John giggled nervously, blushing.
“Mycroft won’t have been tapping into the system until this afternoon. He will have tried to access previous footage, but there isn’t any. When security destroys tapes for me, the recordings are irretrievable. I trained them well. So all he’s seen…”
“I’m really not pleased with this response. However, I’m equally sure that Mycroft is not pleased either and that heads are rolling. In fact, if we opened the door, we would see two completely different agents outside.”
“We need to talk about this London thing.”
Fawnlock twitched his ears. He was sitting on the ground, in the dark, with his back against the side of Johnny’s house, tucked up below Johnny’s bedroom window. It was a bit risky—if anyone came into the back garden, they’d see him—but he’d been watching the house for years, and no one ever set foot outside after dark until Johnny made his nightly trek to his tent.
Thanks for listening; more chapters to come soon!
“John, you’re okay, you’re safe. We’re in the hotel.”
“What I don’t understand—”
Mycroft sounded harried, angry, and terribly contrite. John was kind of thrown. Mycroft couldn’t have predicted the sniper; since then, he and Sherlock had been irritated by nosy agents, had a lovely shower, teased said agents, had mind-blowing, life-altering sex, and watched those agents terrorize a staff member whilst ruining their tea service. All in all, not really something that the so-called British government needed to be prostrating himself over in abject mortification.
“All humans have this?”
“You slept well.”
“I can get through this.”
John smiled beatifically and began fucking Sherlock again, leisurely, with one finger.
“John. I am more than capable of taking care of myself.
“JOHN!”
He glanced at what he’d grabbed—watermelon—and looked down at Sherlock’s straining member, foreskin completely retracted, precum drizzling out the tip to make a sticky string. For a moment he mentally flipped through the statistics on acquiring STDs via blow jobs while making a quick visual examination of the penis in front of him, lifting it and viewing the underside, and felt a heady recklessness overcome him. Just as he was about to pour the cold liquid over Sherlock, he was startled to see an unwrapped condom held in front of him.
John plopped down on the couch with a sigh as Sherlock took off his bespoke suit jacket and laid it over the desk.
Mika said stolidly.
“How can I? You pulled me away before I could see anything interesting happen.”
John simply squeezed Sherlock’s hand again.

“Thank you for speaking with me, Mycroft. I will take it under advisement, and I will be in touch,” John said briskly and hung up.
John held him tighter.
“Good morning, John.”
“Okay, let’s get started!” John said cheerily and arranged himself so his cock was in Sherlock’s mouth. This took some doing, actually, as he didn’t want to smother Sherlock with his arse, and he ended up on all fours over Sherlock, his face very close to the drip zone. Which turned out to be convenient for the reward section of the game. Also, it meant that Sherlock could not see the drips and would have to concentrate on feel alone.
“This is fucking incredible,” he said, once he’d swallowed.
“Be that as it may. I’m not going to go running around trying to lose them. In fact, I think it’s high time you explain exactly what we’re trying to accomplish here. We seem to have left the snipers behind; why don’t we just stop for the night here, in--” John checked the road sign he was driving past. “--Santa Rosa.”
“Oh god…” John called brokenly.
“Doesn’t mean I don’t know that he can be a bastard sometimes.”
“John. John,” Sherlock murmured into John’s neck. “John.”
“John. What’s going on? It was red paint, John. You’re going to be okay.”
“Regardless, it
“You keep your nails clipped shorter than a pianist.”
Fawnlock looked down at the ground. “Not friend.”
“Yes, John, yes. These are the layers we were talking about. I’m going to keep going; you’re going to keep feeling. Just keep floating and let me do my work; keep listening to my voice.”
“John went to The Stud,” Molly said rather loudly.
“C’mon, Sherlock. Show me some more of this city. I want to be a tourist.”
“No, is that some kind of astronomy thing?”
Johnny was breathing hard. He was out of the rain. The creature was watching him, still holding tight to his wrist. It dropped his backpack down on the floor of the cave, and then it moved until it was but a few inches in front of him, gazing at him with huge green eyes.
Sherlock was astonished. John smiled a bit, and wiped under his eyes with his knuckles.
. Constant companionship was not a natural state for him. Perhaps he was off his game. And he hadn’t gone this long without daily meditation for...well, at least 11 months, 6.5 days.
“I had been, once, to the local Zen Center. I knew of meditation, of course, but never had thought it would be achievable with my neurological makeup. I was lucky; the day I happened to return to the Center, for unrelated reasons, the greeter was a deceptively mousey-seeming practitioner who has the perseverance of a grandmaster chess instructor combined with the discipline of a Dominatrix whip wielder. Molly managed to teach me how to meditate the way a river creates a canyon: through incessant, unrelenting pressure. Of course, she would be appalled to hear it described that way; she would say that she helped me get out of my own way.”
“This reminds me of basic training. Sometimes we’d earn leave on the weekend and go into Harrogate for a pint. Or twelve.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. You’re absolutely right. It’s been a while, and I confess that I’ve never been quite as...assiduous...as you are (and rightly so) about being careful.”
“So it appears!” John said cheerfully, popping his palm against the other arsecheek.
“Sherlock. You aren’t my Companion. I formally release you of all Companion duties. I don’t want you as a Companion. I never did. You are...you are extraordinary, you are amazing, I am so incredibly grateful that I met you, and I don’t know why you are hanging around me, and I don’t want you to leave. But I do not want you to be my Companion, or my concierge, or my call-boy, or whatever it is. I just want you to be my friend. Okay? You don’t owe me anything. You don’t have to stay. I just...I really like you. Please stay...just as Sherlock.”
“Oh, I haven’t seen one of those in ages! My Da used to take me to a pub that had these.” He immediately began flipping through the song selections.

“There we go!” John pulled Sherlock into his damp arms and began a demented waltz around the room.
“Have you.” Sherlock moved his foot out of John’s tongue’s reach and repurposed it to use his big toe to stroke up and down the silky skin of John’s shaft.
“What do you usually tell people?”
“And the college fund?” He felt awful asking about his own welfare when his family had exploded around him, but he had to know.
“I’m bi, actually. That’s a real thing.”
“How are you going to stop him?” the Addler asked, lounging against a rock in the moonlight, examining her nails.
“Ah. Well. As I said, it became a matter of necessity, once I decided to become a Companion. I never used it for the high; I only used it to quiet my mind.”
John nodded vigorously.
“So this is something you do regularly, then?”
John gently ground his cock into the sensitive tissue tunnel he’d found.
“John, I need you to be honest with me about the pain. I cannot do this properly if you will not tell me what you are feeling. It is especially critical for someone with injuries such as yours.”
He hadn’t ever actually done anything like this. He’d never had an actual lover; a few clients had requested joint showers, but those had usually just consisted of him blowing them or getting fucked by them in the spray. He had been aware of the sensual possibilities of the St Regis’ incredible surround shower, but no clients had been interested. Just as well; doing this sort of thing with any of them would have been a sick mockery of what he was feeling now.
“Hey!” John protested.
“You do want to try it, right? You know that you’re quite clean; we were very careful about that in the shower, and you know that I am very,

“Really.”

“Different how?”

“Both…?”
John listened.
“Okay, let’s see what shite we’re supposed to learn today,” Johnny said cheerfully.
“Yes, you do, because you are human, and all you’ve had today is tea; don’t think I wasn’t watching. And all I’ve had is a pastry and believe me, that is not enough.”
“No, I’m sure he hasn’t.”
—focus on his arse, any pragmatic moves were ignored. A moan of appreciation verified that this was no different than any other time he’d done a strip-tease. He straightened up as he kicked the trousers off his feet and caressed his arsecheeks, through the silk, as much for his own pleasure as for the visual effect. He purred a little and heard a gratifying choking sound come from behind him on the bed.
“Now. In the immediate vicinity, we have…” Sherlock pulled out the larger-than-customary bedside drawer. “Condoms; several kinds of lube—all latex-friendly; gloves; and dental dams. If you’ll give me a minute, I can pop into the next room and get the deluxe toy bag.”
Fawnlock glanced up and saw where Lestrade was staring. He put his hand up, felt what had gone wrong, turned and bolted.
“Okay, look. We’re going to
Sherlock smirked. “Yes, that is indeed our ‘gay place.’”
“Well don’t keep me waiting! I wanna hear it all.”
John pulled Sherlock over to the sofa. He arranged Sherlock half over the cushions, half on his lap, Sherlock’s head against his chest. “What happened, darling? What did the bad man say to you?”

Lestrade won that argument, but only after he checked out several advanced texts on the effect of hygiene on modern life expectancy, along a medical book with really graphic pictures of such things as the result of an

It wasn’t that she had that much else to do. In fact, before he had started invading the lab on a daily basis, she had been bored, reading medical journals and running little experiments of her own. She liked to investigate nature, collecting pond water and cataloguing the creatures that swam in the microscopic view, or putting autumn leaves through the spectrometer.
Mycroft sat back from the Pool. He had a flash of the familiar irritation at the necessity of waiting a month between conversations, but the work of the Council had always moved slowly and deliberately, so he took a deep breath and banished the irritation from his mind. It served no purpose; there was no other way to contact Council members. This was the way things were done.
“I shall need you to identify it if it survives this fire.”
Great! The compass needle was on the N.
“Cluster earthquakes?”
“How do you know all this?”
Sherlock wrapped his hand fully around John’s cock and began to stroke, making use of the slip-slide of foreskin that was still loose. John clutched Sherlock’s shoulders and cried out wordlessly, small sharp cries that increased in volume as his cock hardened completely. And suddenly he was coming, too soon, too hard, letting out a sob as he shot hot fluid on Sherlock’s hand and his own belly.
“What?” John asked.
We’ve applied for a loan to help us pay some of the bills. Mrs. Hudson’s been so nice, letting us go late on our rent, but it’s not enough to make ends meet. Maybe the bank can help.
“Yeah, uh…” The policeman looked up. “Yeah. I guess you can go. But--no more, uh, fucking in public, okay?”
Finally, the last of the dragon was winding away down the stairs as their soup was served. Sherlock became aware of firecrackers going off outside along with a large and noisy parade; he watched John surreptitiously, but John didn’t twitch once at any of the loud bangs.
“Now can I please tell you what I learned?”
“So then he scooted down so his face was at my crotch, see, and I didn’t know what he was gonna do. And he rolled me over onto my back, like, and then he kinda put his nose down in my, well, y’know,

“NO.”
For a couple of weeks, girls would still show up at the tent at night, but that tapered off quickly as word got around.
“You’ve got to stop breathing like that. Follow me. Four counts in, eight counts out.” He began counting out loud for John, who finally looked him in the eyes and appeared to be making an effort to slow down his panting.
“The guards are out there. And Mycroft’s in here.” Sherlock gestured vaguely to a camera. “And the security is so bloody obvious, and we’re hemmed in, we’re
“Okay, I’ll see you here tomorrow. Have a good evening, Fawnlock.” Lestrade turned away reluctantly and started back into the village. There was so much he wanted to ask the boy! But he felt he had pushed him as far as he could for the day. It must have been so alarming for him, to be revealed. In fact, Lestrade felt pretty privileged to have been allowed to touch Fawnlock at all. He grinned to himself as he walked back through the town to the library. This extra-curricular tutoring was getting interesting.

He pushed the finger slowly in, breaching and then just holding, letting his other fingers tickle lightly around the perimeter.

The contractions of John’s passage around Sherlock handily led to his own crisis, and he groaned long and loud as he felt his own cum shooting deep inside his lover. He marvelled at the satisfaction of knowing that instead of being stoppered into a latex balloon, he was painting John’s insides with his own DNA; marking him as his own, indeed, with shot after long, hot shot of thick fluid.

Fawnlock coughed and choked on the water and shook his head violently. Rain flew from his growing antlers and spattered Moosecroft in the face.
John sighed deeply. “Pour me some whiskey first.”
Johnny pulled back and looked at her, sure she was having him on. She seemed quite earnest.
“Sherlock. You think you could, maybe, pull off at this stop?”

“I’m not sure.”
“Yeah, that sounds right. And then he started pinching, um…”
“We were, but you took too long.”
John groaned prettily and complied. Sherlock found himself with a warm, lazily limp John laid upon him and realized this might not be the optimum position for shampooing, but he decided he would make it work. Slowly, he began to ease the liquid into John’s short blond-gray hair, letting his fingertips rub the skin of John’s scalp. He alternated with a very light scratching of his nails, making John moan, and then went back to rubbing. He did this for a very long time while the shower stayed pleasantly hot, spraying both of them from three directions, pounding out their tensions. Sherlock had to use his strength to keep both of them upright, but it wasn’t much of a burden, especially with the constant pleasure his nerves were singing of from the snuggling of John against him.
“Well—it seemed like—I mean—”
“You’re awfully cranky for someone on an exciting road trip abroad.”

willing to do it, right?”
When John didn’t say anything else, Sherlock asked: “Are we significant others?”
“That, you can certainly do.” John made his way into the bathroom, limping a bit more noticeably since he obviously didn’t need to hide it from his new Companion (the capital “C” was all too obvious in the way the man pronounced it).
A sharp wind blew through the green oak leaves surrounding the Contact Pool, startling sleeping birds in the still summer night.
“Hand to God.”
"Now we break in."
Sherlock nodded.
“Well, that’s good, then. Okay. So we’ll get tested when we get back. Good. Right.” He kissed Sherlock clumsily and forcefully, and Sherlock grinned into it, which ruined it more, and it was an utterly perfect kiss.
Did the deer boy just poison him? Pan was supposed to be nice, gentle, helpful! Why would he poison Johnny?
Sherlock smirked. “It is a truly unique San Francisco experience. Why don’t we go there next?”
John and Sherlock were lying in bed, head-to-toe. John was busy lightly gnawing on one of Sherlock’s ankles, and Sherlock was half-heartedly telling him to stop.
“This is fantastic,” he murmured.
“Sherlock. Stop. What’s going on?” John took the coffee pot out of Sherlock’s hands, set it down, and gripped his forearms. “What did I say? I thought we were past that.”
Boston "Don't Look Back"
As they walked down the hall, Sherlock snagged a passing staff member and quietly ordered an expensive Russian vodka and a full tea service to be sent to their room. He opened the door and led John to the couch, then sat next to him, holding him as he shook. A few minutes passed before a quiet knock came; Sherlock rolled the service tray in himself, poured a half-cup of tea for John, and filled the rest with the liquor.
Sherlock watched John for a while.
“Does that bother you?”
my scar, you loon, when you massaged me.”
A few minutes later, there was a curse, and then Sherlock hopped up and somehow gracefully pulled himself back over the transom.
John shifted to sit closer to Sherlock, so that he was pressed against him, on the sidewalk. Eventually an EMT noticed them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re right, that is rather alarming. Glad you warned me.” John looked up and caught a brief smile on Sherlock’s lips.
“Okay,” John agreed vaguely.
“How did you know.”
John felt, rather than heard, Sherlock choke back a sob. He pulled his hand from Sherlock’s hair and wrapped his arms around Sherlock again, holding as tightly as he could. Sherlock grabbed onto John’s forearms.
The sand and the fires were also reminding him of another place and time, much less pleasant, but the damp was keeping those memories from overwhelming him. The Helmand was never damp.
Now John was sitting half-cross-legged (with his psychosomatically bad leg stretched out) on the center of the bed, staring at Sherlock.
Summer was almost fully upon the forest the day that Fawnlock heard noises from where he was lying listlessly in the tent. He sat up quickly and his nose confirmed that Johnny was approaching. His enhanced senses gave him time to bolt for the trees before Johnny was in sight of the tent, and he stood behind some pines, trembling. Hoping.
I have no idea if John would be able to tell that easily that Sherlock was not having a heart attack. Let’s just go with it for the story. :)
thought Sherlock in the hotel room,
“Sure, most of us in San Francisco and the Bay Area are pretty aware of BDSM, if not actual participants in it. I take it this was new to you?”
“Wiggins! Angela! Clear a path!” Sherlock shouted as he shoved an elbow into the assailant’s throat. Almost immediately, a large Filipino man in a uniform suit and a short woman in a matching suit were at John’s side, using physical force to get Sherlock and his charge through the glass doors and into the lobby. The sound of the protest was immediately muted, and Sherlock was now able to hear John panting with a sort of pained vocalization. The door guards helped them to the elevator.

“Yes,
“I don’t even know what that means.” Sherlock pulled smoothly onto the next exit, which led to a road abutted by fields. “Do you think you can drive on the wrong side of the road?”
Most of all he hated the way she invaded his otherwise beautiful, magical existence. Every night when he went to bed, he made a secret prayer that he could be an only child--without hurting Harry, of course, more like just nullifying her out of existence so that he and his parents could be a happy, calm family unit.
“Porn?” he repeated, gobsmacked.

“OH GOD!!!”
at the same time and John felt all control rush out of his limbs and out his cock into Sherlock’s mouth, pulsing, pulsing. He realized he was shouting and scrabbling at the sheets with one hand, clutching Sherlock’s hair with the other.
John felt two sucks on his cock and struggled not to plunge into Sherlock’s mouth. Gasping, he counted out loud, “One, two.” He looked up and watched as a droplet slowly collected at the bottom of the towel bundle.
John looked steadily into Molly’s eyes for longer than was socially comfortable and said, “Thank you.” She gave him a surprised smile.

“Stop thinking!” Sherlock literally stomped his foot. “Trust me! Have I steered you wrong yet?”
John grinned and began moving again, this time pushing gradually but inexorably all the way until he was buried up to the last knuckle. Sherlock sighed in relief.
John did so, and Sherlock saw him visibly sigh as he was engulfed in streams of water just this side of too hot. Sherlock had made sure that none of the shower nozzles that were positioned above the level of John’s shoulders—that would have splashed him in the face—were turned on. Sherlock moved in behind him and closed the glass door; then he wrapped his arms around John, pressing against him. John turned to nuzzle into his chest and wrap warm arms around his back. Sherlock rubbed his flaccid cock against John’s tummy and felt John’s skin along the length of his body. It was an incredibly comforting feeling.
Sherlock looked away from John but pushed his head into John’s hands. “He said...he implied that everything that’s gone on since I’ve been here has been...overseen...orchestrated, by him.”
Sherlock was watching when John shifted from the last of his REM sleep into the relative peace of a theta wave stage. He saw John’s brain slide slowly into consciousness, easing back into awareness of the world. Sherlock was thrilled; he had never gotten to observe this happening in another human. Eventually, John’s eyes opened, leisurely, and immediately found Sherlock’s.
John pulled back. “That okay?”

“Fine for you, I bet berries is all you know. Yuck.” Just then Johnny’s tummy gave a rumble. “Look, Pan, you gotta help me get home. My mum ‘n da’s gonna be worried about me by now.”
“Of course I did, otherwise I never would have done it.” Sherlock moved closer and put his hand on John’s cheek, looking at him tenderly. “John. I would never risk what we have. Never.”
"Is this your doing?"
Sherlock was breathing deeply, slowly, using a meditation rhythm even though he hadn’t intended to head for that mental space yet. The breathing stopped the shaking, which was simply adrenaline at having to care for someone in a panic attack, a new and unrehearsed Companion requirement.
“I haven’t had sex or inappropriate needle sticks in fourteen months,” John said. “Well, I hadn’t, anyway, before I had sex with you. I’ve been tested at least three times in that fourteen month period.”
After they had eaten all the food Johnny had packed, Johnny tried to read the comic book to his new friend, but the dark of the storm was turning into the true dark of night, and soon the only illumination they had was that of the lightning. The cave was pitch black, so Johnny sat on the ground facing the entrance so he wouldn’t have to think about what might be lurking in the cavernous depths. The storm, the absent sun, and the dank cave conspired to create a temperature that was altogether unhealthy when one was stuck in wet clothes.
“Don’t worry about that, Molly. I’ve found my Polymnia and I’m following him. Isn’t that what you’ve always told me to do? Isn’t that what you’ve been training me to do for the past year?”
“Now for the best part. Again, I need you to stay relaxed and remember that as I’m working, I’m not looking at your face as ‘John’s face’ but instead as a collection of muscles and skin, so don’t think about how you must look to me.”
“Oh, I like this song!” John exclaimed. He began to sing along to the chorus and turned up the volume.
Just as he thought this, he tripped over a great big branch and he screamed. His leg was on fire! What had happened? He looked down from where he was sprawled on the ground and his leg looked funny; his shin was bent at an angle. It looked frightful. He tried to stand up and fell down immediately, and he began to cry harder than he’d ever cried before, even harder than that time he’d got lost from his mum in a supermarket.
“You’ve never been frightened a day in your life, and you certainly don’t care about me. You just want to look good before the other
“Sorry, didn’t mean to fall asleep on you.”
“What in the hell just happened,” Johnny murmured to himself.
The deer boy looked down as Johnny wiggled his wrists, and slowly he unclasped one but kept a firm grip on the other. Johnny sighed.
“That’s amazing.”
“Come on, John. I think it’s time we both got a shower, don’t you?”
Sherlock threw the phone across the room, where it hit the wall but did not break. John could see that tears were streaming down Sherlock’s face. He hopped out of the bed and picked up the phone. When he heard Mycroft’s frantic voice, he held it to his ear.
“Obviously.” John went back to nibbling his way up Sherlock’s neck, ending with sucking on Sherlock’s earlobe and letting him feel a bit of tooth.
“Book. Help. Fawnlock?”
“Noon?” Fawnlock pointed straight up in the sky to check his understanding.
“I think I want to play a little game with you. If you play it with me, and you’re very good, I’ll let you come later. If you refuse, or you try to cheat, well, I’ll just jack off in front of you and make you watch for the rest of the night.”
“Why are you doing all this for me?” John countered.
John looked a bit shocked.
of your needs while you are with us. I have a room—Room B—that is adjacent to yours, if you prefer that I stay there.” This was clearly a description he had recited many times before.
to succumb to such things, nonetheless began to squeak. Sherlock’s timing was ruthless and metronomic; he pounded into John with the perfection of a drumbeat.

“It’s not possible to fall in love after seeing someone for 30 seconds from afar.”
“What is customary?”
“Oh god, cannot stand the stuff. Why?”
“Put some butter into your grits before they cool off.” Sherlock stirred some butter in for John since both of his hands were occupied. “And turn this other sandwich half over, otherwise the bottom piece of bread gets soggy.”
yes, shit, I’m going to come, it’s too soon, it feels too good…”
The book man held up a thing that Fawnlock recognized. Johnny used to put part of it on his head while he sat at his wooden table-thing, and sometimes he danced around a bit wearing it.
“Sure there isn’t some avoidance going on there?”
He rearranged himself so that he was sitting propped against the bed, too, and wrapped his arm around Sherlock, who immediately curled in against John without letting go of Molly. They sat that way in the quiet for a while.
“You get any leave?”
Sherlock stroked John’s hair with his free hand.
“None. Though not for lack of bribery attempts on the clients’ parts.”
“It would be my pleasure,” Sherlock said as he stood to phone room service to come retrieve the dishes.
“Tests that I myself administered. There are ways to get around drug tests.”
“Denny’s? Is that it? Yeah, Denny’s!”
As he humped more rigorously, he panted and felt himself waking up. Which led to his opening his eyes to the back of a head covered in loose, silky black curls. Who…? He looked down and saw that he was grinding while wearing his briefs, up against a back clad in black cotton.
“Orange, please!”
He forced himself to do the slow breathing he had just been practicing in his meditation. It was incredibly difficult; his body was urging him to
“Uh…” This was a wrinkle John hadn’t anticipated. “Sherlock! Your brother thinks I’ve kidnapped you or something. Get in here.”
“Darling, what’s going on?”
“But—”
“Now Martha, let’s not get into that.”
“You were sleeping peacefully, and I decided to let you rest.”

“Eleven twenty.”
“Let me go!
John looked at Sherlock, stricken.
“Mmmm.”
“Uh...I don’t know what you just said, but I don’t think we should go back out there. It’s pretty scary out there.”
“It’s okay. I’m sorry, Sherlock. I’m so sorry. I know enough now.”
, and
Fifteen minutes later, John was happily dragging his spoon around by the handle of his knife on a laminated table while Sherlock groaned into his hands.
“Oh thank fucking god.”
“I can run my own shower.”
John stared at Sherlock.
“No one knew. After the first rebuff as a child, the police came to my parents, told them to keep me in check. Mummy and Father chastised me in their offhand way, told me to stay out of trouble, that sort of thing. So I told no one of my continued efforts. Well, Mycroft knew, of course. He was the only one who came into my room; the cleaning staff refused, due to my experiments. So he saw all my case walls, where I pinned up the evidence to piece it together. But he never spoke of it and never interfered.”
“Of course, but I don’t need them now.”
“Oh, no, he didn’t, I mean, not like
(Fawnlock was the only one who still called Moosecroft by the mangled name he’d given his brother as a child. “Your ears are huge! They look like those of a moose!” he’d exclaimed as soon as he could speak in full sentences.)

He was going to find out once and for all what it was that fascinated Johnny about those things.
“Look at you. You’ll take whatever I give you, won’t you. So docile, so biddable. You’ll let me feed you, water you, pet you. You’re so very, very good, John. Slip deeper under for me. Let me control you.”
“Me. Home. You take.” Johnny gestured broadly. The other boy watched his hands and then turned his head back to stare into Johnny’s eyes. It was kind of annoying, how this kid could stare, seemingly without blinking.
“We haven’t been properly introduced. I’m Greg. What’s your name?” He held out his hand, and when the kid just stared at it, he pulled it back as nonchalantly as he could.

“This is fantastic! I’ve never been any place like it!” John breathed in wonder.
“Where--”
John smiled and nuzzled against Sherlock’s sweaty chest. Sherlock reached to drag the sullied duvet over them and squeezed John closer as sleep took them both.
John ended up relaying most of the story of his and Sherlock’s time together that week, hinting at but not detailing his erectile issues and the reasons for his PTSD, but expounding upon the rest. He already knew that she was aware of Sherlock’s occupation, so he wasn’t worried about outing him.
“Nonsense. You would deny me my pleasure, would you?”
And then John pulled away. Sherlock saw him wipe his mouth with the back of his hand—his lower face was covered in drool—and he was panting, which made Sherlock feel better; he wasn’t the only one affected.
“Thuh…”
“Oh, do you want to go first?”
“Too much?”
“Not exactly. Arousal does not equal consent. You know that a rape victim can be physically aroused, right?”
“That’s amazing!”
John was silent for a bit.
Thanks as always to
“When were you at a Denny’s?” Predictably, John skipped over the interesting parts and zeroed in on the embarrassing bit.
“I want you to fuck me,” Sherlock murmured into John’s ear.
“John, will you just stop being boring for a moment and make me this promise?”
“And he leans in close, we’re sittin’ in front of each other, yeah, and he holds my hand and leans over and says, real quiet-like, ‘If you want it, Fiona, you’re gonna hafta say it out loud; I’m not a mind-reader.’
“Do I get to control the music?”
The bed began to shake, and a soft rumble filled the room. John heard a banging sound and glanced over to see the metal slats of the draw-curtain hitting the windows.
“Shaaairrr.”
“Yes, Sherlock, that really bothered me.” He turned around to see Sherlock staring at him with narrowed eyes, as though he was studying an unusual lab animal. He turned back to the coffee maker, pulled a clean mug from the cabinet, and placed it with a decided
He doesn’t just help, he has to—
Once John was in bed, hair washed free of paint, dry and warm and curled tightly around Sherlock, breathing softly in a light sleep, it was Sherlock’s turn to shake.
“Do you have any, I dunno, sleep trousers? Pyjamas, maybe?”
“The…”
“Ya never said.”
“He says, for security reasons—”
“No nightmares.”
Their food was delivered. John looked down at his deluxe hamburger. He was quiet so long that Sherlock took a bite of salad just to have something to do.
I would’ve made jam-filled biscuits, I know they’re your favorite, but I was worried the jam would get all over in the post so I’m sending spice instead. Let me know if there’s anything else you need and we’ll try to send it along.
The stag shifted to walk a few steps towards them. His antlers were magnificent and enormous. Moments stretched as they regarded each other through a pane of crack-resistant glass.
Fawnlock jumped in his chair and got his legs tangled under the table as he tried to stand up. He was clearly panicking.
“No. I shan’t. I don’t know why I did this time. You’re absolutely right.”
John climbed over Sherlock and sat next to him. He took Sherlock’s hand.
“Don’t you EVER do that to me again.”
“Would you like to join one of our reading groups? We have two; one meets during the day, one on weekends.”
"A screwdriver?"
“Come on, let’s get you back in bed. If you want me to leave you alone, I will. But if you’ll let me, I’d like to hold you for a while.”
“Yes, of course, we won’t do it again,” John agreed as Sherlock scowled.
“Ah, the Pygmalion question. Well, I needed money for cocaine, and I was already sucking off dealers, and I’d gotten quite good at it. I found out about Companions when one john took me to the Saint Regis, and I learned that Companions make quite a lot of money. However, I wasn’t aware that there was a strict policy on drug use. It seemed like a better situation, though, and a close friend agreed, so I cleaned up my act, came back and applied, and I was accepted.”
“Pahn,” the boy repeated.
John held back a sigh. “Yes, you may look at my scar,

doing, do you?”
“Ack, too sensitive!”
Sherlock smoothed a large hand over John’s hair; John hummed in pleasure.
"Don't say it like that, Sherlock. I think I'm pretty glad he's watching out for us just about now."
As soon as Fawnlock was old enough, he left the house as often as possible. Exploring the forest had led to his meeting Johnny Watson as a child and to subsequently finding and observing other humans. He quickly learned to keep his human observations clandestine, as otherwise, he would have to endure long lectures from Moosecroft.
John stared at the young woman who poured forth an astonishing stream of bubbly, bumbling speech in a wonderfully stereotypical Northern California accent.
“I’m not proposing a scene. But I think some very light bondage, just to help you stay still, might be in order. Let me wrap some soft rope around your upper thighs. If you prefer, I don’t even have to attach them to the bed. If I do attach them to the bed, you can easily undo them with your hands, which will be perfectly free. I can even give you scissors. What do you think?”
“Yeah, you, Pan, the horriblest host of the forest! I bet you’re not even nice to lost baby otters any more!” Johnny’s breath hitched on a bit of a sob. It was time to take matters into his own hands (if for no other reason than that he wasn’t going to give this boy the satisfaction of seeing him cry).
“Show me.” Sherlock turned around and stared out the back window.

“Quite all right. Always a compliment to a masseur, you know.” Sherlock looked up from where he was reading on a tablet. “How does the leg feel?”

wherever. Technically we will fly back to SFO and then, anywhere we like.”

Sure enough, hard flicks were being given to his other nipple almost immediately. Sparks of pain that flashed into euphoria piled one upon another, showing themselves to John’s inner vision as layers of bright red flowers that morphed almost immediately into rich peach-coloured petals. John whined into his gag and suckled. He felt drool running down his chin, and he pulled at his immobilized wrists in his ecstasy.
“John, we’ve been through this. I am no longer working as a Companion; you are no longer a client. We cancelled that relationship several days back. Thank you for being sensitive, but that is not an issue. Besides, you can’t afford to try to bribe me.” Sherlock smiled broadly. It was John’s turn to huff.
“Is that where we are?”
“I’ve never met anyone like you, John. I need some time to understand you. I do not think I can do it within the confines of this week.”
“John!”
“Glad to hear it.”
Molly gave him a big, artificial smile. “Sure! I’m sure we’ll get along just fine. It’s okay.”
“Oh, God, John...fuck...I think I’m going to come...fuck fuck fuck…”
“Nothing serious, John. It was just a nightmare.”

“Yes, and if you’ll look up ahead…”
“Sherlock, I’m

Johnny visibly flinched to hear his mother curse.
‘Well, let’s have it then,’ said the Mole, after he had waited patiently for a few minutes, half dozing in the hot sun.
“Jawwwwwwn,” he whined.
John thought back.
Sherlock moved towards the bathroom, but John stopped him.
And then the ice really started melting.
The deer boy discovered the leaves of pages and began turning them, exclaiming as each page showed a different set of drawings.
“Which part?”
John was wrapped around a warm, soft body. He felt his hard cock pressed against the warmth and hummed in appreciation. It had been so long...he began to grind up against his lover slowly at first, speeding up quickly as delicious sensations radiated from the friction on his cock to the rest of his body.
“Ah-dee-oh book.”
John sipped properly at the second shot and thought quietly.
They continued to wind their way alongside the sinuous Eel River.

Johnny was speechless. Harry gave another short laugh at the expression on his face, then turned and left the room, closing the door with a loud
: I have been unable to find out, just from web searching, if this newspaper was around in the 1980s. If I get an answer from a local Hampshire library, I’ll update this with a proper newspaper name.
Sherlock allowed himself a grin.
“Is that who this is?”
“But?”
“I’m sorry that was so fast.”
With an audible breath, Sherlock moved back to the left side of the table.
“Don’t be absurd. I’m sure it was beer. It didn’t smell strong enough for urine.”
“If you won’t come home, what will you do with yourself?”
Sherlock turned around, sighed, and leaned up against the counter, clutching at it. He couldn’t look at John directly, so he scrutinized a variegated pothos sitting on a side table.
“Would you like to inspect my ankles, as well?”
“Pahn,” he said mournfully.
The deer boy shifted to a crossed-legs position, laid his hands on his own knees, and closed his eyes, breathing deeply.
“Yes indeed,” Sherlock answered, tucking his cloth napkin into his lap.
Happy Christmas, love! I’ve sent enough Christmas cookies for your whole barracks and a cake as well. Not much money this year for presents, but I’ve knitted you a scarf that you can wear on cold days.
“Yes, that’s our oversized declaration of aggressive sexual freedom.”
Sherlock turned back around. The relief in his eyes made John want to hold him tight with one arm, never letting him go again, and with the other arm kill anyone who ever made Sherlock feel as though he wasn’t worth getting past a tiny misunderstanding for. Instead, he hid his reaction, afraid it would be interpreted as pity, and made an impatient “drink up!” gesture, to which Sherlock responded by groaning and drinking a few drops more.
“So we’ll go on up to Humboldt. I know a lovely little café in Arcata, I think you’ll really enjoy it—”
So glad to hear you’ve made a friend. I made a double-batch of ginger biscuits so you can share them. Are you getting enough sleep? I hope your drill instructor isn’t being too hard on you.

Remember what we read together in “Desiderata”: “Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.” Do your best to avoid anyone unpleasant.
with, okay? Just fucking get your hand off me.” John was shaking. Sherlock didn’t dare let go. He hadn’t seen this look on John’s face before; he imagined this was what John must have looked like in the face of the enemy. He looked utterly calm, completely determined. Fierce. If Sherlock had any sense, he would have been frightened, but he had never had any sense in his life.

A dark look crossed over Molly’s face, and she visibly struggled to control it. Then she sighed, closed her eyes, and seemed to go inside herself for a minute or two. When she opened her eyes again, she just looked sad.
“Mm, g’morning, Sherlock. What time is it?”
“Yes. You’re familiar with him?”
Sherlock eyed the big bottle of yellow liquid in John’s hand.

, who has more
When Sherlock left London, in the dead of night on a chartered plane surrounded by Mycroft’s security, he was skin and bones. His eyes were sunken into a bruised face. Under his clothing were more bruises upon bruises, some of his bones in casts. On the plane he was fitted for artificial teeth. He was in involuntary withdrawal simply because they could not find enough of the cocktail of illegal drugs, which Moriarty had been feeding him for months, to keep him stable for the flight. He was nonverbal and was not really aware of what was happening. But when he arrived in San Francisco, he refused treatment.
And then there was some really shrill yelling:; from the other end of the hall, if he wasn’t mistaken.
And everlasting thanks to

“Well? Go ahead,” John said, a bit tremulously.
“I could hold this position for hours.”

But in one flash of headlights, John saw his lower lip quiver, for just a moment.
All of this was delivered at so rapid a pace that John could barely differentiate the words, and it was uttered in an urgent, quiet tone that caught his attention far better than yelling would have. He blinked a few times, and Sherlock released his wrist, which immediately felt a bit chilled at the departure of those warm, long fingers.
“Thank you, Tom,” Sherlock said silkily.

“No nightmares.”
John looked down at himself: he was covered with smears of dried sorbet and damp sweat. He looked at Sherlock, who looked a bit like he had been through the Sorbet Wars. He shucked out of his boxers and headed for the bathroom. Sherlock hurried to join him.
John rocked Sherlock a little on the sofa as they clung together. The sunlight snuck fingers in-between the slats over the windows when the fog left gaps, making the light in the room as uncertain as their future.
“I’m not going to work this leg as hard because of your pain.” John was grateful that he left off the “psychosomatic” descriptor. “Be sure to inform me right away if anything feels wrong.”
John became aware of a sort of soft music playing in the room.

“There. Now no one will have it. Satisfied?”
Sherlock heaved a sigh worthy of being asked to carry all the belongings of all the tourists in the hotel to the airport by himself using only a hand-cart.
“Both please!”
Eventually John got the hang of it, though he grumbled that a fork would have been loads easier.
“You’ll have it by morning.”
Sherlock allowed himself a small smile at the fact that John didn’t ask questions, didn’t argue--just trusted him implicitly. He wondered why he was holding back on telling John about the actual danger just outside.
“I’ll buy you a new phone. This was your sister’s; you don’t have much personal data on it. We have to get rid of any way they can track us. Luckily the car is too old to have On-Star or any built-in GPS devices.”
“Twenty-six?! I thought you were about seventeen years old!”
“You thought it might have killed you to stop,” John said with a growing realization. “You saw something out the window, in your room. What did you see?”
“You think I’m some kind of religious saint, don’t you, John? I’m a practitioner and employee at the Zen Center. That’s not really a religion, though many of us are also Buddhists. It’s a
At the top of the stairs, John stopped and gaped at the Buddhist temple located up another short staircase. The sweet smell of incense and the soft ring of ritual chimes drifted towards them on tendrils of sensation from the quiet service being held in the dark room. Sherlock put his hand on John’s back and guided him to the right, to the entrance to the dining room. The hostess seated them at a small table near the entrance.
.” Sherlock deftly flipped them over, laying his full weight upon John, who laughed delightedly. “I’ll show you who’s the boss here,” Sherlock growled.
“I love when extras come in their own little dishes. It’s so civilized.”
He spent his days wandering aimlessly in the forest, noting this year’s patterns of disease in trees, watching the social behavior of the animals and the birds, and avoiding Moosecroft. Nothing held his attention; everything in nature was immediately understandable, no mystery, no puzzles. There was a dark time where he huddled inside a hollowed log during an extended storm, not eating for three days. He forgot to drink, too, which led to delirium, which in turn led to a humiliating experience with Moosecroft dragging him out of the log and forcing water into him from a nearby stream.

“Be assured, we’ve got the real thing now. There are two operatives in the hall that are quite difficult to see, and I suspect we are being guarded by some that even I cannot spot, though I certainly can guess where they are.”
Sherlock felt John’s muscle contract and hoped that was an arousal thing and not a worry thing. He reached around inside with his fingertips, and there—that nub, that must be—
John ground again, inelegantly, feeling Sherlock’s hardness pressed awkwardly to the side in his jeans. He let the nipple go only to take the other in a full-mouthed suction of the entire area. Sherlock’s head jerked up sharply.
John saw that Sherlock was grinning around his mouthful of penis and closed his eyes, unable to think of much of anything beyond the warmth engulfing him. Then Sherlock began to use his tongue, and John groaned. John glanced down and saw that Sherlock was using his fingers to hold something against him below his balls; must be a dental dam, he thought.
“She did what now?” Johnny put down his fork carefully.
“And what are you? A...deer person, maybe?”
“Ah, you’ve heard of him! Then you know he’s just the sort we need with us from now on. Immense power. The three of us caused a nice little disruption.”
Sherlock snorted but didn’t argue. He took John’s hands in his.
Johnny cracked open an eye, and he did not see a pillow under his head but instead a furry tummy that was starting to shift about. He took a deep breath, opened his other eye, and looked around to see trees towering above him in slanted afternoon light.
“Take care of yourself and my brother, Dr Watson.” The line went dead.
“No, I want to try that American place some soldiers told me about. What was it called...Lenny’s...Benny’s…”
John blinked back tears.
“I’m not sure I like it.”
Darling readers! We are now caught up with what was prepared. Now we venture, together, into the unknown. Two chapters left. What will happen to our intrepid boys? I have some idea, but they do tend to have minds of their own. I have high hopes of finishing up this week; we'll see if real life lets me.
Fawnlock nodded again, turned away abruptly, and walked back down the road.
But was John open enough?
“Clearly you were enjoying the duck; I didn’t want you to worry about trying to split your entrée loyalty.”
“It was...exhilarating. Cocaine has a soothing effect on my brain. Calms down the racing thoughts. I was sharper; more focused than I had been in years. I could

The onset of adolescent hormones threw Johnny into a spin. The world was abruptly confusing. Social interactions at school became bizarre. He felt bursts of unattributable joy or anger at random times during the day.

“But no sex.”
Once they were in the car, John tried to insist that he patch up Sherlock’s feet right away.
“Don’t worry, hon. Many men have come to this very bar to unburden their hearts about a man who done them wrong.”
“That’s one!” John said happily.

“I think you are approaching this from a very all-or-nothing standpoint, Sherlock, and I have to tell you, if we are going to live together, you are going to have to learn to become more flexible than that.”
He just held it there for a moment, taking in the softness, the roundness. Then she pressed her chest into his hand, and he moved it a bit, stroking with his fingertips, and she moaned, so he tried a little squeeze.
Sherlock pulled John into his arms. John didn’t make a sound, but Sherlock could feel his shirt becoming soaked. He held John tightly. John shook, pressed against him, but did not put his arms around Sherlock. It seemed he didn’t have the energy.
“You’re right, Sherlock. You’re right that I have been focussed on the sexual aspect of your job. It’s not for the reason you think, though. I’m not a prude. And I’m not disgusted, well, not by that, anyway. I am very sorry to hear that you were involved in cocaine, however. Are you still?”
“Feel free to borrow an otoscope at the conference and examine my nostrils.”
“Yeah, I know. It’s the only thing you want to do, right? Feel a calling, want to help, be a service, blah blah blah.” She sighed. “Study hard, and pay attention on shift. Pay
Using his room key, Sherlock took them in the back entrance and guided John into an elevator. John leaned against the wall, panting, shaking, and not looking at Sherlock.
They stared at each other for long moments, the intensity of their connection almost unbearable.
The book man chuckled. “Have you really never used a tape player before? Okay, look. When you press this button, it stops.” He pressed his finger to the black box and the voice went away.
“Not good enough. You will never let me be; you are not capable of not interfering.”
Sherlock grinned.
John sighed.
“Wait, you forgot your new book!” Lestrade grabbed the book and the tape player and ran after him.
“Mycroft—”
Sherlock looked to the side, blinking. “No. Not really, no. It’s never been about that.”
“There. We got that one to release. Can you feel the difference?”
“That’s awful. Why would someone do that? Why kill yourself in a way that causes trouble for others?”
Sherlock was astonished to find the sun high in the sky when he woke. In fact, he was astonished to be

Sherlock glanced over. Once again, he saw sadness in John’s eyes, but no pity. He wasn’t sure how John managed that, but he was grateful. He leaned his head on John’s shoulder, and John stroked fingers through his hair.
“We, uh. We have a kind of...unique connection, my brother and I.”
“Then what do you propose?”
“Do not keep anything else from me, Sherlock. Not pertaining to our safety. Do you understand?” John’s voice was steady and quiet, but he looked up at Sherlock with a stare that had sent fear into the hearts of his soldiers and Taliban fighters alike.
“Say it.”
The door opened.
“Oh, no, I’ll just do a quick wash and we’ll get out.”
Finally he knocked on John’s door.
“Well then! This will definitely be a unique experience.”
“Where are your

—in the bag. He shed his artificial fur as fast as he could, tossed the restrictive articles aside carelessly, and lay down on his back in the grass, sighing with relief and stretching all of his limbs. Then he rolled onto his stomach and reached back, ruefully rubbing at his bruised tail. The lower garment was particularly distressing. He rolled back over and stared up at the sky between the trees, lightly stroking his

“It’s been three minutes.”

Johnny shares his tent.
“Oh Sherlock...I can’t help but take a taste.” And John dipped in to do exactly that. Sherlock felt his wet tongue brush directly against his anus. It was somewhat different than he had imagined; knowing how many nerve endings were there did not prepare him for the sheer eroticism of being licked at the most vulnerable place on his body.
“Oh! Oh, I was a bit, actually. Was thinking it’s time for a prostate check. Well, it still is, but I guess it was just a factor of not having come in so long.”
John looked at Sherlock thoughtfully.
Sherlock took a deep breath.
“Invalided out, now doing locum work as we’ve discussed. You miss combat; you’re happiest when you’re facing danger, but your nerves are shot, so it’s a dilemma. You think there’s nothing left in life for you, but you believe suicide is a coward’s way out; another dilemma. You’ve never been in love. You believed in a god fervently as a child until the first time your father hit your mother. You hate violence but you won’t hesitate to use it when it is called for. You are instantly and fiercely loyal to those whom you deem worthy. You have achieved much in life in spite of rotten circumstances and have almost no self-esteem; you are devastatingly handsome in an unusual way and while you are not modest, you are also unaware of your attractiveness. You seem mild-mannered, ordinary, an idiot like the rest of the world, and yet I cannot predict a single thing that you have done since the moment I met you.”

with me?”
“What’s going on, John?” he asked, fully prepared to not discuss this at the slightest hint of resistance.
John looked up at him, shocked. Sherlock held his eyes, somewhat defiantly.
“Where are you from, love? You must have quite a story to tell,” he murmured quietly. “Let’s take a look at this book, shall we?”
Dreadful Boy.
Dearest Johnny:
Mellow dub music filled the car, along with the soporific hum of tyres on the road.

John craned his neck to watch it go by. Sherlock could see that the top was swathed in fog, the lights just barely visible in the swiftly moving clouds.

-agreeing. This has gone too far. I need some air.” John left the room and slammed the door.
The boy sniffed it, then stuffed the entire thing into his mouth.
“I should have said something earlier, John. At first, there was no need, because you were a client. And then, there was never a good time.”

“You could say that.” She reached a hand over the table. “Captain McIntyre. My dad was American, mum was Korean.”
“Who.”
The deer boy completely ignored Johnny and sat down, pulling Johnny down with him by the imprisoned wrist, and began to fumble at the backpack one-handed. Johnny marvelled that his hands seemed to be just the same as Johnny’s hands...four fingers and a thumb, no fur. Just normal hands.
“Is this some kind of morality play?”
“Mycroft—I, I don’t know what to say.”
“What’s it like?”
Sherlock just strode into the brightly lit Walgreens, leaving little blood prints in his wake where a bit of jagged glass at the sea wall had broken the tender skin of his soles. John followed behind, growling some more and making the clerk at the cash register look at them sharply.
anyway. The strongest of the Bear People, a fine fellow named Moran.”
“Sweet dreams, lad,” his dad said as he always did.
“Hey! My compass! I thought I lost that!”
Just past the muscle at the entrance, John was loose and hot and mysterious. Sherlock was prepared to taste, well, excrement, but the channel was still tasteless. Interesting. Sherlock slowly dragged his tongue almost all the way out and then pressed back in, thrilling to hear John sob in response.
“That’s the first time you’ve grieved them,” Sherlock said softly.
“You wanna really see some stuff, soldier?”
The deer boy grabbed at the wet book, letting Johnny’s wrist loose in his excitement. Some of the paper ripped. The deer boy said more excited nonsense words.
Mycroft peered into the pool as an image came into focus. A beautiful woman’s face appeared with big black eyes, tiny black ears, and sharp features—
John was nicely laid out on the bed, stretched out on his stomach: a pillow under his hips to make his arse that much more accessible; his head comfortably pillowed as well; his arms at his sides. The room temperature was ideal for nudity, and lube and a bottle of water were lying next to his thigh, ready for Sherlock’s use.
“It’s no trouble, John. Would you like me to lie behind you?” Sherlock positioned himself on the bed on his side, curled towards John’s back, not touching.
“Oh yes, that’s absolutely where we were.” John rolled his eyes. He sipped his tea, thinking. “Okay, you do have one point.”
“Maureen, is it?” John had pulled on some jeans and a t-shirt before he sat down next to Maureen, who had been watching all these goings-on as best she could, from the sofa, with some interest.
He put his hands on the curls in front of him, barely able to make out Sherlock’s face in the shadows. Sherlock was using every trick in the book: suction, tiny flicks of the tip of his tongue on the frenulum, and then deep throating. He
“You know?” Johnny whispered, his eyes filling with tears.
Sherlock fastened that rope and the second one to the bed frame. John tested the bondage by trying to do a pushup on the bed. He couldn’t get his knees underneath himself. This resulted in a lot of groaning and writhing and grinding against the pillow under his hips.
it’s going to be hot. But you can’t really imagine it until you have to stay in that heat for months on end. The air is hot, the sand is hot, the fucking water is hot.
“I’ll get it back to you, one way or another,” Sherlock promised.
“My brother, and he was correct. It’s the cornerstone of my approach to life. And you are muddying it, John.”
“Listen to me. You had a panic attack. Do you remember? A protester threw red paint on you. I brought you in here and cleaned you off, and I

He stared down at his feet for a long time. Fawnlock watched from a few yards away, unseen in the shadows.
“Oh, your wrap there, it’s coming loose—” Lestrade stopped talking as a large, fuzzy ear popped out from under the cloth. “What is
“Got any advice for an orderly who wants to become a doctor?”
“But Mum? Why did they have to forget?”
Fawnlock knew the word “kiss” from Johnny’s tent activities. He’d seen Johnny “kiss” several girls. But there was something about Johnny kissing Dreadful Boy that hurt Fawnlock’s heart in a new and sharper way.
Sherlock was a little baffled by John’s insistence on edging. His sudden need to take the lead, to prove himself in charge, especially of their sexual activities, seemed a direct reaction to finding out about the cameras. But why all this edging business? Perhaps it was part of an overall asserting of control: forcing Sherlock to lie under him, to stay still and quiet; shackling his cock, controlling when he could (and mostly could not) come; trying to control when and how he would perform and receive sex acts. It was all very primal, and Sherlock looked forward to experimenting with these themes a lot more with John.
“Well, the criminals, obviously.”
The obnoxious song playing chose that moment to go to the chorus:
Sherlock held up a hand as they neared the other end of the hall. The two agents there were involved in a fierce physical battle with several people whom John assumed were there for Sherlock.
“Okay! You be that way! A little kid wanders into your woods and you don’t have the good manners to help him get home. That’s just fine. When I get home you better believe I’ll be telling them how
Moosecroft sighed. “I will cease monitoring your activities as you watch the creatures.”
“Exactly. But...you don’t have to tell me; I’m pretty much ready for anything, really, so it’s all--”
. We are
Johnny has a study partner, and Fawnlock sees more than he bargained for.
“Then how the fuck did he know we were talking about it?”
“Is this the Sherlock Appreciation Hour?”
“I think I’d prefer to hear how it’s done, myself.” John gave Sherlock a smile, the first since he’d encountered the man, and Sherlock looked a bit smug for a moment before he schooled his features back into a pleasant concierge-style expression.
“Just barely. Where did you learn to do this?”
“Step in, John.”
“That is not helpful, Sherlock.”
“Fuck you, Moosecroft. I’m not that desperate.”
“Cold!”
“Sherlock?”
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock asked sharply.
“You did cocaine?”
“Yeah, that’s my--”
“That was entirely consensual, and a long time coming, I think.”
“Please, Sherlock, now, I need you, look how still I am, I’m holding still, I want you, I want to feel you, uh,
only open up to a stranger.” John was gazing out the window and missed the way Sherlock’s eye twitched when he said the word “stranger”. “I certainly can’t open up to my therapist, and there’s no one that I’m close to in London. Or anywhere, for that matter.”
“We are, now get bare-chested and get over here.”
. It was everything I hoped. I was able to retain my own consciousness whilst completely understanding the bee brain. I don’t know if I was injected into an existing bee body, or if one sort of spontaneously erupted into existence when the machine completed its cycle, but the bee was fully mature and understood everything it needed to about the hive, its tasks, and the locations of likely pollen sources. I could read the dances of returning bees and I followed the directions.
“I don’t—”
Sherlock was maybe more violent than he needed to be in crushing the tiny spy cams as he found them. He used the base of a very heavy (and very expensive) lamp to smash them to plastic dust. He found seven in John’s room and loo, including one that was a new model of which he hadn’t been aware—so tiny that he almost missed it. When he had destroyed that one, he got a text from Mycroft:
John moved a finger up to stroke at the slit at the head of Sherlock’s cock, and the feeling was so sharp that Sherlock wailed around John’s slowly pumping tongue. John responded by stilling both hands, and Sherlock’s eyes snapped open to see John staring down at him, an inch away, with a stern expression. He felt tears leak out of his eyes.
“John and I are having survival sex and will be for the rest of the day and night. Keep your goddamn minions away from the door. I don’t give a fuck what they hear, but John has delicate sensibilities. The curtains will remain closed. No one will be getting in or out; your idiots will see to that. There is no need for them to see or hear what is going on inside this room.”
“It’s lidocaine, idiot. It will numb the area slightly and shouldn’t add to the infection risk.” He dabbed cream on the deep cut and let it sit for a minute.
“John—what—”
I don’t have a map of Lyndhurst from 1991, so I don’t know if a tea house would have been across a green from the community center that houses the library, but I’m pretending there would have been one like this: Lyndhurst Tea House (
Johnny nodded and started eating methodically.
Johnny nodded, speechless.
“You need some time to take this in. I shall retire to my adjoining room, just through this door; knock if you need anything or if you feel like having company again.” Sherlock graced him with one more dazzling smile and disappeared through a door between some cabinets and the wall of windows.
“Uh, how would you know? You didn’t talk to him!”
Fawnlock immediately moved from where he was sniffing the toes back to stand opposite Molly, across the table, and he leaned in as far as he could without impeding her instruments.
Fawnlock finally allowed the book man to perch the fuzzy black things against the side of his head. Then he did something to the other piece and suddenly someone else was talking to Fawnlock, very close. He turned around quickly, but no one was there!
I’ve taken a job serving at the New Forest Inn. It’s quite interesting, getting to meet all different sorts who come to stay here! Mostly they come to see the forest or to see where Arthur Conan Doyle stayed when he was writing his book. Your Da is still working extra shifts. The money you’ve been sending has been quite a help, ta, but make sure you keep enough for your own needs, love.
“All the more reason to study them, then.” Fawnlock stood up slowly until his legs were steady under him, and then he turned and walked away from Moosecroft. Slowly, but with dignity.

“Try this.” Sherlock opened a can and poured the contents into a tall glass. He handed it to John, who sipped it.
Short chapter is short. A much longer one in the works.
"You do that," came a muffled reply from inside.
“Honestly, John. I prefer the more obscure ‘Zep’ offerings, such as ‘In the Light.’ The EMS VCS3 synthesizer lends an exotic, almost spiritual quality to the song. It was so difficult to play that they never did a live version.”
had anything to do with—I will not listen to this! You did not—I worked that out by myself! You had no hand in—Mycroft, you insufferable bastard, you know you do not give two fucks about me, stop pretending you do, I won’t listen to any more of this!”
“Look, I can’t have this...conversation, or whatever this is, like this.” John got out of bed and pulled some clean pants from a drawer in the credenza. “There. Now, I think we need some tea. Then we can continue discussing this.”
“We were never here,” he said to the young man, and winked.
Don’t think I’ve seen an artbus yet. Sherlock’s colleagues’ bus might have looked like this:
He remembered something Harry had said about moss growing on trees, so he walked up to a tree and circled it, looking for moss. He found none. Then he realized he didn’t know what it would mean even if he found it.
, homework. How the fuck am I supposed to concentrate?” he muttered. He scrubbed his hands through his hair, making it stand in odd tufts, and sighed deeply, pulling out a notebook.
“I’m not saying you were a victim of rape, or that you were a victim at all. I’m saying that just because you were getting into it does not mean that he was right to be initiating a scene so soon after your first experience, and doing it so clumsily. It was a major mistake and clearly it hurt you, emotionally, or else you wouldn’t be here.”
boy. A mythical creature…
“Right. Well, we’re not going to listen to my music, because it’s sitting in a cup of pee about 50 miles south of here.”
He was alarmed to find that it came back out with a sob. Quietly, John began to weep.
. And I didn’t know nobody did that, right? I never read no books or nothin’ before that. Like, sexy books. And then he moved my legs apart, and he started lickin’ me,

is insisting that I need to feel you inside me, around me, skin to skin, nothing in the way; just you, and me, and the essence of our passion for each other. I want to share fluids with you, Sherlock. I want to get messy and not worry about it. I want to join our fates with cum and spit and blood.”
“Sounds like he’s a pretty good Dom.”
“I’ve heard,” John said with some mumbling, his mouth being full of toes, “that this is an erogenous zone. It is, isn’t it? You liked it in the shower, right?”
“No.”
He was vaguely aware of his leg being lowered. John’s fingers were removed, and he whined, but then they were gloriously replaced by a hot thickness—oh God, it was John himself, beautiful wise and wonderful John, his perfect cock, pushing into him and filling him and making everything
“I think Pan is more of a feeling than a real person. You know how we talked about Father Christmas being the embodiment of love? I think Pan is a bit like that...maybe not so much an actual being but still real whenever anyone takes care of someone else, or when you feel the breeze on your face in early Spring and you can almost smell the flowers growing.”
—as you say, swoop in and take over everything.
The night Harry “moved out,” Johnny stopped sleeping in his tent. He was intensely worried about his parents and felt like he needed to stay as close to them as possible.
. Regardless, the point is that I believe that you would benefit extensively from subspace, which is a term for the altered state that can be achieved through the physical and emotional side effects of allowing a controlled power exchange through various traditional submissive methods.”
“A cheque.” Sherlock refused to be prodded into saying more. Years later, John found out it was an anonymous money order for $100,000; “Susan” was Susan O’Connell, then-President of the board of the Zen Center.
He realized his eyes were closed when he felt Sherlock’s hand travelling slowly up his leg, past his hip, to rest on his chest.

Sherlock looked at John before checking his mirror as he pulled back onto Highway 101. John looked very relaxed. Sherlock grinned before wincing when his foot pressed on the gas pedal, hard, to account for the very short entrance ramp.

“What? Boring? Ordinary?” Fiona snorted. “Not hardly.”
“Quite.” Sherlock smiled a little.
“This is the young man I was telling you about. Is Ms. Hooper here?”
“Tell me what you miss most about London,” he said conversationally.
“Come here, John.” He pulled John, who had been standing listening to this monologue with some wonder, down onto his lap and into his arms and began to kiss him thoroughly. At first the kiss was aggressive, possessive; Sherlock was staking his claim, daring John to contradict his demand that they stay together. As John put up no resistance and instead molded himself against Sherlock, the kiss slid into something silkier, their lips skimming against each other as their tongues dipped inside the other’s mouth: tasting, flickering.
“Not a happy shift, was it?”
Sherlock sighed and began to undress himself. This, he would make seductive. He might not be a Companion any longer, but there was no reason to waste his talent. He licked his lips and was pleased to see John’s eyes snap to his tongue. He caught John’s gaze with his laser-like focus and began to unbutton his outrageous shirt, revealing his chest one tantalizing inch after another. John’s eyes were locked on Sherlock’s fingers. Slowly, smoothly, he pulled the shirt tails out of his trousers; then he slid the shirt off his shoulders, twirling a little in an exaggeratedly feminine move that made John laugh. Grinning, Sherlock flung the shirt over to John’s wardrobe chair.
“You’re going back to London? But what about—”
“Could you please watch out for him? He’s so smart, but sometimes, he’s a bit...clueless. I worry constantly. He won’t hear of it, but I love him more than anything in this world. I would be very grateful if you could continue to try to keep him safe. Could you do that for me?”
“Oh, I do.” John poured bath gel into his hands with a look of glee. He proceeded to run slippery fingers

John waited a full ten minutes after the last shot. No one noticed them in the chaos. He rolled off Sherlock, and they both moved to sitting positions, their backs against the sturdy (and lifesaving) planters.
“What was white?”
“I’ll get the door, shall I,” Sherlock muttered sarcastically. “Perhaps you’ll want to cover that up.” He gestured vaguely to John’s poor purple cock rising proudly out of his pants.
“We’re certain,” Fawnlock interrupted. “Where is the door?”
John leaned on the concrete wall at Ocean Beach, Sherlock strong and warm behind him with his hands propped next to John’s.

and concrete dust rained down on them.
“Wai-uhld…”
“One will be your base. Hold it against your finger like this, and don’t move it. Now this one will be your manipulator; grasp it between your forefinger and thumb and use it to pinch.”
“Turn schmurn,” John said, rinsing his hand. “Who gives a fuck about turns.”
“Fine! I don’t care! Do what you want!” Johnny turned his back on the deer boy and stomped forwards a few more meters. Then he stopped and looked around. The sun was almost directly overhead by now. Unfortunately, that was of no navigational help to him whatsoever. Taking a deep breath, he picked a direction and ran. He began to yell while he ran, venting all the fear and frustration of the past day and night. Yes, he’d done what he set out to do; he found Pan! But Pan was just a stupid kid; it was all just a fairy tale after all, and now he might never make it home. He might have to stay in the forest for the rest of his life, eating nothing but sour berries.
“John! Stop that! You’re going to make me swerve!” And swerve Sherlock did, though John was fairly certain it was on purpose. He plopped back into his own seat.
“Oh Johnny, you’ve scared us so.” She began to pull him into the house.
“You’re a slob, you know that?” Johnny said, taking a single bite from his own sandwich. The deer boy chewed with his mouth wide open, grinning in delight at the sweet taste.
“Let me into your mind.”
“Deer Person. Yes, close to what we say in our language.”
Harry in any way, but her complete lack of shock soothed something in his subconscious, and he began to accept that he had sexual needs and that they didn’t make him a bad person. He realized that his urgent sex drive didn’t have to define who he was in the other areas of his life. When the new school year began, he came out of the shell of misery he’d curled up in, and he tried out for drama and the rugby club and found that he made friends easily with both boys and girls.
gag.” He leaned back to see if she was shocked. She was not; she was watching him quietly, with raised, encouraging “Go on?” eyebrows.
Sherlock was amazed by the experience. Yes, John had been very slightly musky at first, but mostly he had tasted faintly of soap, and now he tasted like nothing. But the skin at his entrance was so very, very silky and smooth; it was an intensely interesting sensory event when combined with the irrational taboo of licking the arse.
Sherlock sighed.
“Well? You just gonna sit there, or you gonna have a feel?” Christine’s words would have been intimidating if not coupled with her gentle tone. She reached out, took Johnny’s hand, and placed it firmly on her breast.
male.”
“Quite,” Sherlock said, grinning.
He’d never had one who had been shot through by a bullet.
“You get a sense for these things,” John said tiredly.
“What was that all about?”
Finally, Sherlock broke it off to murmur, “We’re actually waiting for something. Should be starting right about...now.”
When he found John’s entrance—now no longer a tight pucker but a loose, welcoming hollow—he pressed into it, and as his flared cockhead breached the ring of muscle, both of them groaned.
John almost ran back outside; he could feel how hot his face was. Sherlock joined him on the sidewalk with a rather smug expression.
Sherlock delicately pulled apart the lightly fuzzed buttocks in front of him and leaned down; he let his long, warm tongue start at the base of John’s testicles and started to lick up—
Fawnlock looked across the green at the white building.
Johnny and Christine were snogging under the terrace by the rugby field. He was absolutely covered in sweat and grime from the game, but Christine claimed to like him that way.
Sherlock was almost doubled over, laughing.
“Yeah, you think you’ve ‘seen some stuff’. Get on the front lines, then tell me you’ve ‘seen some stuff.’ Good to hear you’re not squeamish, though.” She regarded him thoughtfully as he proceeded to make his way methodically through one tray and moved on to the next.
Molly gave an embarrassed titter. “Right! Okay! So I suppose you want me to give him a tour then?”
“Yes, the first night you were here, you were awakened by a nightmare. You were quite loud before you woke up; it was very easy to understand what you were saying.” Sherlock looked up from the map, his face relaxed and open. He began to frown when he saw that John’s jaw was clenched and his hands were in fists. He set down the tablet.
Sherlock had been toying with a sugar packet, but now he looked back up at John.
“How about you come to clinic hours with me. I do some volunteering at a place in town, they’re a little short-staffed at the moment. Be at the base welcome sign, 0600. That too early for you?”
“Pull over
Over a large and varied breakfast, John gave Sherlock a very abbreviated summary of the conversation.
it all.” But Fiona was grinning and had rolled to face Bianca; it was clear she wanted to spill.
“Shh, shh…” John soothed, running his hands over Sherlock’s back.
He felt his immoveable sense of duty pushing against the irresistibility of Sherlock’s logic. What this odd, attractive stranger—who appeared in his life unexpectedly, in the role of what was essentially “prostitute”—had said, was rational. He took a deep breath, felt the ache in his shoulder, and told his sense of duty to shove it.
There was the noise dictator, right on cue.
“Never.”
“Guess not.”
“I don’t think I’m ready for that.”
John retaliated by taking Sherlock’s arse in his hands and grinding up against him, and Sherlock melted into a deep, tongue-caressing kiss. John moved his hands up into Sherlock’s curls and they rolled a bit, rutting against each other, humming into each other’s mouths. Sherlock moved a sock-covered foot to stroke up the inside of one of John’s legs, and John spread his thighs in response, which made Sherlock reach down to feel John through his boxers. He was delighted to find that John was mostly
“It was white, by the way.”
“John, you’re having a panic attack. I’m going to get you out of these clothes and get the paint off you. You need to focus on me. You’re here in a hotel room in San Francisco and you’re completely safe.” Sherlock felt as though he was babbling; it was clear that John wasn’t really hearing what he was saying, and he realized he was saying it as much to keep himself calm as to impart any information to John. Swiftly, he pulled John’s t-shirt over his head and dropped it to the tile floor. He had to lift John bodily to stand him up and remove his jeans and pants, then clumsily sit him back on the toilet and crouch to pull off the trainers and socks.
“What are you doing to me Sherlock, Sherlock—SHERLOCK oh GOD—”
John was rummaging in the glove box.
“No, we’re not.”

“What, here?”
Sherlock felt an uncharacteristic pulse of fondness in his heart for his older brother.

John craned his head around and kissed Sherlock’s face, wherever he could reach, and Sherlock angled his head so that they were kissing, messily, their lips soft from emotion, John’s mouth salty from tears.

Johnny watched his mother. She was furious; her face was red and her hand crumpled the paper as she held it.
Fawnlock pressed his fingertips to his neck.

John coughed roughly. “But you’re Sherlock’s friend.”
“I don’t have a fuckin’ urethra,” said Dreadful Boy sullenly.
Sherlock leapt out of bed as John came at him with the Gatorade. “I will call for tea, as any
“Oh, no, my comic book! It's ruined!”
John was watching Sherlock avidly. His eyes were almost completely black with pupil. He reached down to adjust himself, palming a thick erection which twitched in his jeans. Sherlock noticed all this and smiled slowly, knowingly.
"My stash was gone, John! It's gone."
The book Fawnlock borrows next is this:
“I’m sorry about this…”
“John,” Sherlock said quietly. “You are in San Francisco, at the Saint Regis hotel. You are with me, Sherlock. You are safe. You are tangled in the sheets. Take a few breaths and let me help you get untangled.”
I know nothing, nor did I do any research, about how often a “healthy male under the age of 60” ejaculates, either on purpose or in sleep, though I do remember reading that Gandhi, who tried very hard to force his body not to ejaculate, was furious at himself for a few wet dreams (over which, if you ask me, he had no control and therefore should not have held himself accountable). I also know nothing, nor did I do any research, about what it means if someone’s ejaculate is clear, although I did ask my boyfriend who speculated along with me that that probably indicates little to no sperm. I do not know if that indicates a prostate exam should be done—probably unrelated, actually—and I do not know the age at which regular prostate exams usually start, though I would imagine it’s around middle age, and I also imagine that John, as a doctor, would start them earlier.
As he counted, he dipped a flannel in the water and gently began to wipe the paint from John’s skin. It was on his face, his neck, his collarbone...it was in his hair, but Sherlock decided to save that for last. Now John’s eyes didn’t leave his; John was staring at him as though to even blink would spell disaster.
“No, John, I have no problem either giving or receiving.”
anyway?”
It was an eerie song, beautiful and clear and strange, and it seemed to reach out through the forest as though the sound waves were alive. Johnny’s crying quietened as he tried to listen. What was this boy doing? Johnny’s leg was beginning to throb, and each throb elicited a moan, and he began to breathe faster. He hadn’t realized there was this much pain in the whole world. He began to shiver as he moaned, but he kept watching the forest creature, who continued to sing a song of longing and need and sadness.
“She’s caught up to us,” Sherlock said, eyeing the side mirror.
“What, because he’s too lazy to get off his fat ass and do anything about it? Or just because he doesn’t want to see me, and this is a convenient way to keep me far away?”
The server took their menus and moved away.

“He won’t get away with this,” Moriarty muttered, followed by a high, laughing cry of frustration.

“Well, throughout human history, food has been closely linked with sexuality. Humans have intertwined feeding with sexuality in many practices, explaining of course why nipples are so sexualized. In fact, I’d say you had some practice yourself with sorbet. If you like, I could show you some of the deeper psychological implications of figs.”
“I am thirty-two years. Deer Person live longer than human.”
“Let’s see, I was wounded thirteen months ago...hadn’t gotten any for a few weeks before that, so, probably fourteen months?”
Mycroft sighed. It was true, retribution had been visited upon the people of Iraq for setting the terrible, atmosphere-damaging oil fires in Kuwait. But he was extremely disturbed to hear that Moriarty had broken one of the Sacred Directives. In 500 years, the Council had never let anyone outside know their business. That Moriarty could casually bring in someone who was decidedly
“I didn’t even talk about it with my therapist.”
Mycroft sighed. “I suppose that’s something you should ask him. He...well. It’s a long-standing problem, and it’s really not mine to tell. Just…”
“Good boy, good John. You’re being so, so good for me. Here’s a little more sensation.”
“Yes, hello,” he said a bit breathlessly. Sherlock was in danger of winning the handset with his ridiculously long arms, so John went flat on the floor and crawled into the corner between the underside of the bed and the edge of the bedside table. “We’ll start with the oysters, then have the steak—medium, please—and the duck, and finish with the trio of sorbets and some coffee. As soon as possible, thanks.” He pressed the disconnect button, slid the phone further under the bed, and sat up, smiling innocently. “Problem?”
“It is indeed.”
“I don’t know how this deteriorated so quickly,” John said quietly.
“That’s no reason not to go slow.” And go slow John did, easing his fingertip in and out once, pushing in just a little further the next time, using such tiny increments that Sherlock snarled in frustration.
“Oh, yeah, that’s very nice.”
. But...I can’t, I can’t

person would do.” He grabbed at the phone and did just that. John shrugged and worked on consuming the rest of the sports drink.
*(Warning for this footnote for animal cruelty triggers)
. Please, please don’t leave me, John.”
The deer boy scooted around and made as if to touch the broken limb. Johnny screamed and cried “No, no, no, no, no…” and the other boy pulled back his hands and looked upset. He said something very firmly to Johnny, but Johnny was beyond reason, even from incomprehensible forest-dweller words. He gazed at the deer boy through his tears, breath hitching, keening sounds spilling from his mouth without conscious thought.
“I’m perfectly capable of discussing it tonight.”
John sighed. “I’d say he needed to face reality, to take steps to treat his condition as legitimately as any physical disability.”
“Whatever gender you are, you’re going to have to show me some ID.
“Uh, sure, that sounds great.” John followed the elegant stranger towards the elevators, bemused.
The tutorial had been torture, too. Not only was it boringly obvious, once he understood the pattern of repeating what the book-human said, but it was also terrifyingly filled with the constant opportunity for failure. He’d better pick up on this al-fa-beht thing pretty quickly if he didn’t want to die of the tedium.
She grimaced slightly at his utterly happy expression. “Yeah, you may regret that. I’ll see you then, soldier. Till then,
John nodded and took a bite of his reconstituted potato mash.

“Surely you know that term, as a Doctor. It means that you and I are tested and are STD-free and safe to share fluids, and that we shan’t share fluids with anyone else, that we will use strict safer sex procedures with anyone else we might have sexual—or, for that matter, non-sexual—fluid interactions with.”
All our love,
By now, Sherlock’s eyes were wide. He was staring at John as though he’d never seen him before, as though he’d never seen anything
John visibly shook himself. "Nothing. Just some of the people were jerks. But most of them were good blokes. And women. Women can be blokes, right? Anyway, we patched people up as best we could and got through the days."
“Hoping for doctor, actually.” John squinted at the insignia on the captain’s collar. “...which you are, aren’t you?”
“Bugger fucking buggering father-boning ass-beavering shit-hole satanic pope in a wall. You and your bloody food.”
“Sh’lock. Wake up. Drink. Dehydrated.”
“I have never seen anyone order that repulsive pun of a breakfast item without irony or shame.”
John poured some cream into his coffee from the delicate china creamer.
“But he’s someone who inspired you to read?”
“Mycroft made it clear that there was no way that he could protect you from Moriarty.”
“Mycroft,” he said in a very dark tone. John thought he would be hard-pressed not to flinch if that tone was used on him.
know who orders it? I thought you’d never been to a Denny’s!”
“Sherlock!” she said in a way that seemed like it would have been very soft anywhere else. “It’s so very good to see you! Sit, sit!” She sat on his other side and took his hand. “How have you been?”
. It had been weeks since he’d fallen asleep properly. He glared at John’s back where he was puttering—doing something abysmal with the coffee maker and “tea”, it seemed. Obviously, the sleep was John’s doing. Bringer of bad habits! Eating, drinking blue potions, and now
“Only that we were causing mischief, not the whys and wherefores thereof. You worry too much, Mycroft. You’ll start stunting those pretty horns of yours.” Moriarty licked his lips subtly, but the lechery was obvious to Mycroft.
“To what purpose?”
“No,” he said softly. “I haven’t changed my mind.”
“Is this a problem?”
says that men up to the age of 21 can be vaccinated against HPV; let’s just assume that a San Francisco with legal Companions would provide vaccinations for such workers at any age. (I’m fairly pissed off that I’m not allowed to get one at 50.)
John cleared his throat. “What makes you think I’m talking about childhood?”
“Yes, I have the fucking panic button on the phone. Yes, I will use it if there is an emergency. Mycroft, I am no longer four years old.”
“I won’t be separated from you,” John said flatly.
Molly smiled, blinking back tears. “I am, of course. I am. And I am also acknowledging that I will be sad to know that you won’t be dropping by once in a while. Watching your journey has been so enriching for me, Sherlock. You are a beautiful soul.”
“Here, drink this. Slowly. Sip it.” He helped Sherlock to a sitting position, propped against the bed.
He pulled out the compass and studied it. He needed to make the needle point to the N, right? He turned around, holding the compass out in front of him, until the needle wobbled around near the big, fancy N. It was hard to get it to stay on the N, but eventually he found just the right position and held his breath and the needle settled.
“You might want to select your meal first,” Sherlock chided, handing him a menu.
Fawnlock is learning.
“No cuts. Don’t worry, I was fully cognizant of what I was doing. You did not take advantage of me.” Sherlock grinned, rolled over, and hopped out of bed, striding into the loo. John heard the water running. He flopped onto his back and sighed, rubbing his face. What was he thinking?
John, I understand.”

“He used to be way in the back on the third floor, but they recently moved him here to the entrance under pressure from city leaders. A committee was formed to decorate the niche. It’s freshened every week. But let me take you upstairs, to the 80s wing...it’s heartbreaking, you can’t imagine, so many young men…” Sherlock turned to see John walking out the front entrance.
, John!”
, he reminded himself.
“How do you know all of this?”
“Please.”
“John. John! I need you to listen to me. You’re in subdrop. It happens sometimes, it’s perfectly natural, and it makes sense since this was your first time doing a scene. I’m going to take care of it; I’m going to make it better. But first I need you to drink and eat, and to do that, you’re going to have to let me get up. You do not have a choice about this.”
.” He went to fetch a damp towel from the loo; then he gathered a piece of the rope from the carpet, a sixties-style floor lamp that loomed in a draping arc, and two trays of ice. John dragged the lamp so that it was hanging over the bed; he nestled the pile of ice in the towel, tied it into a bundle, and hung it with the rope so that it was suspended over Sherlock’s crotch. Sherlock watched all these preparations with keen attention.
on my explaining every step of what I plan to do first, so that you could agree to it or veto it beforehand; during the session, you would have complete verbal freedom to tell me to stop the session at any time, as well as complete physical freedom to enforce that wish to any level of violence necessary. We both know you could immobilize me in a heartbeat if you had to, probably without doing any permanent damage. So will you listen?”
. Maybe it’s your ear that needs to be trained.”
, then pushed that depressing image out of his head. Fawnlock was what, thirty-two? Clearly he was quite intelligent and had been fluent in his own language; he simply needed a bit of ramp-up to become conversant in English. It seemed as though his brain was absorbing new ideas like a sponge.
“I have the feeling that your reactions are involuntary, at least now, before you’ve experienced this a first time. I would like to try something.” Sherlock was pleased to see John’s pupils instantly expand from their already wide state when he said “I would like to try something”; clearly he had John’s trust, even after the feeding mishap.
“Sorry for the delay, Mr Holmes, Dr Watson,” said the woman in a polite, upper-class British accent. The two agents ushered the four of them into the lobby.
“Says it’s ‘Ghosts’ or ‘Japan’ or something. That’s a nice pick-me-up for a dark and dangerous night.”
Fawnlock had memorized the book. He could sing the alphabet song backwards and forwards. The whimsical pictures in the book helped him understand the story, and he was utterly bored by its childishness. But he was too angry to have anything to do with the humans.
NOW. He got up and walked as unhurriedly as he could around the room, clenching and unclenching his fists. Periodically he growled, trying to release some of the tension.
Sherlock’s eyes flew open.
John’s “yes” was a whisper. Sherlock closed the distance and pressed close to John, enfolding him within the curve of his long body. He wrapped an arm around John’s stomach.
“Yes, John, and a confounding one at that.”
He tried the doorknob; it was unlocked. As slowly as he could make himself, he opened the door and peered in. No John.
“No one cares.”
“Mr. Holmes?” came a voice from the corridor.
"You fired at people."
“See? You’re like
“Wild…”
“What about your sister?”
John dared to reach his hand out; he touched the back of Sherlock’s, clenched in a fist on the seat, with gentle fingertips.
“I lost one tonight. And I shouldn’t have.
“I think I need to go check in…”
“I’m not getting rid of my phone! Can’t we just, I don’t know, turn it off?”
Sherlock took a deep breath.
“If you’d let me explain, this might go more quickly. My idea involves absolutely nothing that would activate any of your triggers. In fact, it
Sherlock sighed.
“John.” Sherlock touched John’s face to recapture his gaze. “John, I’m falling for you. I’m not thinking about anyone but you. I am completely high on what they call ‘New Relationship Energy.’ You have my complete focus. I’m saying that I can imagine wanting to play with others in the future, wanting to go
“John?”
“Oh John,” he sighed. “Oh, John.”
“Does that position hurt?”
It just happened to have stopped in front of the rather obvious spy car that had parked a few yards away from them.
They drove at least five miles before Sherlock said “That one was your fault.”
“I know, I know! I’ve always wanted to try this! Just...the anticipation’s giving me cold feet…”
Then the cuff went around his ankle, and he pulled in a startled breath.
John handed her the water. “Aren’t you going to ask why we have all these...uh...bodyguards up here?”
The moment when Moosecroft knows he is ready to communicate through the Contact Pool is when he feels his
“His parents wanted an autopsy. They said he was very good at riding and don’t understand how he ended up in the ditch. I don’t think there’s anything to find—it was raining and I think he just took a spill the wrong way—but I’m still having a look ‘round for them.
“We’ve been texting. And he spoke to me before he talked to you.”
Molly smiled at John softly. “Honey, that’s a pretty standard reaction to a good scene. Don’t feel bad about it. You two connected. It’s very, very intense. It can be much more intimate than ‘vanilla’ sex. That surprises a lot of people who are new to it.”
Several people clambered out of the bus, yelling loudly in dismay. One opened the hood; two others brandished what looked like lightsabers and began enthusiastically fighting. Several people were milling about aimlessly. A woman in a nightdress lit a smoke; John smelled more pot wafting their way.
“Just come along for the ride, John. Now. Close your eyes.”
“What! This is
“With the sunrise?”
“Oh, hi, Fawnlock. You can’t come over here, this is an autopsy.”
Johnny groaned.
Sherlock sighed. “Mel’s is a local chain; the one on Van Ness was used in some of the filming, though most of the movie was filmed on location in Petaluma, where George Lucas misspent his youth cruising up and down a single street in uselessly modified cars.”
Maybe he should take his track suit bottoms off, make things a little easier. He kicked off his trainers and wriggled out of the trousers. No, ew, that looked too eager! He hastily pulled them back on.
Dearest Johnny:
“Yes, that will do nicely.” He then poured a full glass for John and a half-glass for himself.

“I wouldn’t have the foggiest idea what to call this.”
to me. You don’t get to try to turn it into something ugly. I am honored that you let me help you, both times.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm not breaking into a library."
“Hey!”
“I have no idea who that is. Talk to me; tell me what’s wrong.”
“Here, I’ll show you how it works,” Johnny conceded when he had a firm grasp on it again. “You make the needle point to the N, like this.” He pivoted the compass around, keeping it more or less horizontal to the ground. The deer boy peered at it with interest.
Sherlock began to drive again, but it took him a while to get back up to speed, almost as though he was reluctant to leave the scene.
“You need no help, brother mine. You are a kingdom unto yourself.”
John pulled back a little and choked out a tiny laugh.
“Bollocks!” Sherlock threw on his jeans and a t-shirt, grabbed his room key, and sprinted down the hall to the service elevator. It opened immediately, and he made it downstairs in time to see John come out of the main elevator lobby. John didn’t spot him; first he looked toward the front doors, where the protest was in full swing; then he turned and headed for the back of the hotel. Sherlock followed at a distance.
“Well, that’s great, but I don’t think
“With or without rope bondage?”
“I don’t know what Sherlock has told you about me, Dr Watson, but I really am just a minor government official, not some magician. I cannot change what has happened, and I cannot simply make Moriarty go away.”
“Who is this, John?”
Still learning audio editing...bear with me dear listeners.
John stared at her with wide eyes. She looked back at him, startled, and they both burst out laughing at the same time.
“Before you fell asleep,” Sherlock prompted patiently.
“Huh.” John rolled around in Sherlock’s embrace and met his eyes. “No nightmares?”
He tried not masturbating for a few days, calling a moratorium on the kind of indecent activity that would lead him to think of his own parents’ body parts whilst abusing himself. That lasted until the day they were required to strip down in the shower after gym; the physical education teacher had decided that the boys were far too smelly after footie practice and could no longer get by with a quick wipe-down.
The Sundays "Wild Horses"
“John,” she said, laying her hand gently on his arm again, “what happened next?”
“I’m not averse to sex, per se. I’ve had quite a lot of it, actually. They used to call me ‘Three Continents Watson’ in the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.”
“You let him dance with
“Okay,” Sherlock said easily. “May I unpack for you?”
“You know earth movements don’t always go exactly as intended. The faults were...not quite where we thought they were. But we got the job done.”
“No exceptions, John.”
A screech happened loudly to his left and he jumped, belatedly recognizing it as a hawk, similar to ones his dad had pointed out on camping trips. As his heart hammered, he felt a bit foolish, but just to be sure, he turned around to look behind him and reassure himself with a glimpse of his house.
“Fight, freeze, flee, or fuck. You’re so ready for danger that you can’t sit still.”
“What do you recommend for the True American Breakfast Experience?”
“Five, maybe six? I wasn’t sure about the young woman with the backpack in the lobby.”
“Fuck, fuck, fuck…”
“The video feeds are off; he had no audio.”
