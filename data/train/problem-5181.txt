“Don't forget to take pictures,” Tony mumbled, and Steve's eyes snapped open, looking down at Tony before he nodded determinedly, grabbing the external shutter that Pepper had mounted to the camera. “Make sure you get my good side,” Tony said with a wink, and Steve gave a strangled laugh that abruptly cut off when Tony finally put him in his mouth.
It did have the positive side effect of finally allowing Tony to have a decent conversation with the guy, unburdened by the blatant compatibility between them. He was honestly surprised by how well they got along when they weren't shouting at each other, and soon enough he was willingly spending time with Steve, taking him to all of his favorite places around the city. Steve went along with it, and while Tony didn’t know why he would, he could tell that Steve was honestly having a good time with him. That Steve might even possibly like him.
And Tony yelped when he came suddenly, explosively, fucking Steve's fist as he rode through it, his eyes squeezed tightly shut. Steve was making soothing noises under his breath, and Tony realized all at once that he was shaking, his breathing so uneven that it seemed to stutter in his chest.
Steve stretched out on top of him, keeping most of his weight off Tony by planting his elbows on the pillows, but Tony immediately shut that down with a well-placed push that lead to Steve dropping on top of him with an 'oomph', his entire body weight pushing Tony into the nest. Which – yeah. Felt even better than Tony had imagined.
He yelped when he was suddenly flung over Steve's shoulder, laughter bubbling out of him when Steve pressed a hand firmly to his ass and marched toward the elevator. "Alright, Captain Caveman. If you think I won't rub myself off against your shoulder you are sorely mistaken."
So, first of all, thanks to you all for being so patient with the irregular updates these past few weeks. I'm glad you guys are enjoying the fic and I hope I'll have more time to finish this soon.
“Ah – yes. Yeah.” The officer gave him one last bewildered look before he walked back over to the door. “You finish up in here. Don't linger.”
“Thank you,” Steve slurred, and Tony fucked into him just as hard as before, the sound of his thighs slapping against Steve's ass almost drowned out by Steve's deep-chested moan.
His orgasm blindsided him, building too quickly to even brace for it beyond a yelped warning before he came like a freight train. Steve didn’t let up, every movement pulling another groan from his lips until it was finally over and he slumped down on the bed, his thighs twitching when Steve pulled off him slowly enough to be right on the edge of uncomfortable.
SHIELD contracts were messy. Tony would know, he'd signed a tangential one himself and therefore made JARVIS scrounge up all the dirty details he could find on multiple of their more disagreeable clauses. Which there were a lot of, no surprises there. But one of them had especially stood out to him as he was skimming the results.
He hid it well, underneath that veneer of 'yes, ma'am', 'thank you, ma'am', but Toni could see right through him. That butter-wouldn't-melt smile was about as real as her tits in the nineties.
Tony almost lost his balance when Steve suddenly thrust up, shoving his cock inside Tony with such force that it made stars dance in front of his eyes. Before Tony could recover Steve did it again, his cock reaching so deep that he couldn't have missed Tony's prostate if he tried, drawing a surprised moan out of him.
“Yes, I can see that.” There was definite amusement in her eyes now as she turned away with a wave. “I’ll leave you to it. Welcome home, Steve!”
- Tony actually manages to find Bucky later, but doesn't tell Steve about it because Bucky asks him not to. He tries to break Bucky's conditioning with BARF therapy but is fairly unsuccessful, to the point where he needs to bring Bucky to the Compound to get help. Which means Steve finds out what Tony has been hiding. There is angsty angst, but in the end they reconcile. Tony moves back to the Compound and rejoins the team, along with Clint and Bruce (who is not off-world but remains on earth after his Hulk-out).
“So good,” Tony agreed, throwing his head back when Steve suddenly twisted his hand, jerking his cock with deliberate strokes. “
“Because if not, how can you guarantee that he is safe for public duty? Are there measures in place in case he goes rogue again?”
“Don't need to,” Tony called after him, grinning when Clint threw a “TMI” over his shoulder. “JARVIS, when is Steve's next rut coming up?”
Toni sighed, pointing at him with her glass. “You're lucky you're cute or I'd put you over my knee for that.”
So I've been gone for a while and to be honest I'm still not fully back. Real life has sucked for a couple of weeks now and the situation still isn't resolved. I'm sorry but this fic's updates might be irregular for a while longer until I sort out my life. But I'll be back as soon as real life allows it.
Tony's cock pulsed with every push of Steve's dick down his throat, fit to pop without ever touching himself, and Steve seemed to enjoy it just as much if his bitten-off moans were anything to go by. He could hear the camera shutter going off in increasing intervals, and each time the flash lit up his face was like a spike of pleasure lancing through him. The thought that Steve was watching him for the right moment to take a picture, eternalizing the sight of Tony's mouth on his cock –
“Tony,” Steve said again, urgently, and Tony turned to find Steve staring right at him, his hands clenched at his sides like he was trying very hard not to reach out and touch. “I'm so sorry, you fell asleep and I tried to stay awake but I must've dozed off and – oh, god –“
“I'm not trying to undermine what happened to Mr Barnes. What I know of his history is gruesome and I would not wish it on any man.” T'Challa looked at Tony. “But if you were one of those directly affected by the harm he caused. Wouldn't you want him brought to justice?”
. He didn't know how he could possibly stop, god, how would he ever stop wanting to feel like this? And how would he stand it if it
Steve didn't mess around. He took Tony all the way down from the get go, his beard just barely brushing the root of Tony's balls. Every now and then he would pull off, run his mouth down the side of Tony's cock so Tony could feel his beard leave a burning trail of friction down his sensitive flesh and make his whole body prickle with goosebumps. It was overwhelmingly good, and the sight of Steve's face like that, surrounding Tony's cock with that wash of blond hair, was like a gut-punch every time Steve sucked him down.
“Let me –“ He sucked in a breath when Steve did it again, fumbling between them to get his pants open. “Fucking –
And then he slumped, feeling like he'd just run a marathon as his body just – gave out, dropping him heavily onto the table as he tried to shift his hips off the sphere, the stimulation suddenly way too much –
“Okay.” She didn't look outwardly nervous but Tony could recognize the subtle signs. And to be fair, he could relate. This press conference could make or break the public perception of this trial. And Tony recognized a battlefield for what it was.
Tony winked at the camera before he crawled back to the middle of the carpet he used for playtime, pulling his bright red chest of toys into the frame. “Alright. Who wants to choose something to stuff my mouth with? Fifty coins and up get to make demands.”
“Oh fuck,” Tony gasped, and Steve recognized the rough undertone for what it was, watching Tony's thighs start to shake as he tried to thrust up into the plant's grip and failed. “Oh my
“You built it for him because you’re buddies.” The general gave him a jovial smile. It didn’t reach his eyes. “Let’s not kid ourselves here. Nepotism isn’t viewed very favorably in a lot of circles.”
. Stop asking and just –“ Tony grunted, throwing his head back against the pillows when Steve pushed in. “Oh fuck, it’s – wow, feels like the real deal, holy shit!”
Steve bent down to kiss him, and Tony met him eagerly as Steve slid his hand down to trace the muscles on Tony's stomach, then going further until he could wrap his hand around his –
Steve's hands clenched in the fabric of his trousers before he let them drop to the ground, straightening up from his slight crouch. Was he really going to do this? Apparently yes, if the way he couldn't stop staring at Tony's body was any indication. He could just imagine holding on to those shoulders as Tony bent him backwards over the rock next to him and –
So. It’s been over a month and some of you have probably wondered what the fuck happened that made me drop off the face of the earth. Well.
“Couldn’t well ask them for a trip to Radio Shack, could I?” Tony asked with a slightly sharper grin, a subtle warning that the general didn’t seem to pick up on, or maybe he ignored it as he snorted and slapped Tony on the shoulder. Hard.
Tony wanted to. He wanted to just spit it out and get it over with, but something deep inside him wouldn't let him, his tongue tied in knots because if he said it – if he did –
been going down, and it wasn't like Tony didn't know why. He'd finally found the inspiration to start a new project again, so these last two months he'd spent more time building things and making schematics than he had encouraging his fanbase of thirsty perverts. He'd never wanted shaking his ass on camera to end up becoming his main source of income anyway.
“Right? Nothing like fucking a woman, but it's good.” Steve raised an eyebrow at him, and Tony waved him off. “Movie reference. Not important.”
“Why my bedroom?” he asked faintly, but Bucky was already hauling the package down the hallway. He probably didn’t want to know.
“Okay.” Tony snuggled up to Steve, using his bicep as a pillow. “Cause I'd like it if you did that again. Obviously.”
“No, thank you,” Pepper called out from the back, and Tony nodded, shrugging his jacket on before he walked to the front door and opened it with a flourish. “After you.”
, went unsaid but Tony could read between the lines. He nodded. “I do understand. And I know that asking you to reconsider is futile, but I do hope you'll change your mind after the hearing. Sergeant Barnes is innocent.”
“No, I liked that,” he heard himself saying, and Tony stilled for a second before he hummed against his mouth, lips pulling up in a grin.
“I'm sorry,” he choked out. “I know it's disgusting, I know what it – that it looks horrible, but I swear, I wanted to tell you so many times and I'm sorry that I wasted so much of your time –“
Steve nodded, his arms squeezing Tony as he rolled them over just the tiniest bit, slotting their legs together and – oh.
“Well, hello there. I've been waiting for you,” he said with just a hint of a teasing undertone, leaning against the doorframe with one arm – and found himself staring at the small blond man who was looking up at him with an expression caught somewhere between surprise and a stoic frown.
“I'm the king of the fucking world!” Tony screamed, jumping and spinning with his arms flung out, and Steve just kept laughing, so hard it seemed to scrape his throat raw, before he raised his arms up to the ceiling and let out a loud whoop, the kind of noise he'd never made anywhere off the battlefield.
“Let's do a giveaway!” Tony shouted, feeling almost giddy with excitement as he bounced on the couch. “Next stream. Raffle draw. Let's say every ten bucks gets you another piece of paper in the box and at the end we draw lots and whoever wins gets their cock sucked by me. And then we get a picture with a good story that'll probably get tons of exposure! Giveaways always do!”
He swore he heard Pepper facepalm in the other room, but Steve didn't look too perturbed by Tony's lack of eloquence, thank god. “I'm not sure there's much to tell. I draw pretty much all day. Hang out with friends. The usual stuff.”
“No, no, I understood you just fine.” Pepper steepled her hands under her chin, looking at him from across the desk. “So, let me get this straight. You enjoy spending time with Steve, a
Steve didn't need to be told twice. He laid down on top of him, thrilled at the novelty of doing this lying down, in a bed no less, when all of his previous experiences had been –
“Sleep,” he whined under his breath, and Steve nuzzled him one last time before he sighed and tucked Tony's head under his chin.
“Good, right?” Tony asked hoarsely, and Steve looked up at him, catching his lower lip between his teeth as he nodded.
“I didn't think I could still do that,” Tony mumbled, and Steve made a quiet noise of assent before he pressed a kiss to Tony's shoulder.
“No.” Steve reached for Tony's arm, then changed course and put a hand on his cheek instead. Tony melted into the touch immediately, and Steve's stomach swooped with that familiar feeling of fondness. “Stay a little longer. Please.”
Steve wanted to keep arguing. This was beyond stupid, not to mention dangerous, what with them not even knowing what the plant was capable of.
Steve nodded quickly, feeling around for the lube with one hand as he leaned up to kiss Tony again, his whole body trembling when Tony raked his nails down his back.
The individuals Samuel Thomas Wilson, Wanda Maximoff and Clinton Francis Barton will be placed under house arrest at the Avengers Compound and suspended from Avengers business indefinitely. Each of them will be outfitted with an ankle monitor and a UN issued chaperone. The UN decreed that these members of the team are to be placed under strict supervision, both internal and external, until their compliance with the Accords can be ensured.
Well, that was bullshit. “I meant it when I said I always want your opinion,” he said and Steve's eyes snapped up to his before they went impossibly soft.
“I want to see you too,” she said quietly, and he immediately reached for his undershirt, pulling it carelessly over his head. Toni had seen him naked before, during an unfortunate biohazard incident, but nothing could've prepared her for how it would feel to be this close to him, having him bare himself to her solely for the sake of pleasure.
Tony rolled over until he could fling an arm over Rhodey’s legs, burying his face in his hip. “You don’t get it. You have boring alpha nips.”
Tony’s thighs flexed as he shuffled down the bed until he was lying flat on his back. “Don’t feel it that much. It’s really bendy.”
“I'm gonna –“ he said, and Steve silenced him with a deep kiss as he sped up, thrusting against Tony with just enough force to make him throw his head back and come, his mouth open and lax as he let the waves roll through him. Steve wasn't far behind, his hips jerking irregularly until his head dropped low between his shoulders as he shuddered through his own orgasm, his arms giving out as soon as he was done.
Tony snorted, the tension breaking as Steve joined in his laughter on the other end of the line. “Jesus Christ. Don't scare me like that.”
He turned around at a tap on his shoulder, coming face to face with Bruce who was giving him a sheepish smile.
Tony swallowed around the lump in his throat. He'd never get to hear Peggy laugh at one of his ideas again. Never feel her hand on his shoulder, so different from Howard's or Obie's. He'd never even told her how much her support had meant to him all these years.
Steve nodded, twisting his hand on the upstroke in a way that made Tony's toes curl. Fuck, if Steve kept that up he could probably come in a matter of minutes –
“Have crafted a well thought out defense, I am sure,” T'Challa said. “What I am wondering is why a man such as you would protect a man like him?”
“Just trust me.” Clint took his phone back before patting him on the shoulder as he left. “And I never say this, but don't use protection!”
Mr. Stark smirked, like he knew exactly what Steve had been thinking, but didn't call him out on it. "I asked if you'd be willing to give us an additional interview later on. Your use case is unusual, but I think it has potential. I'm going to need all the personal accounts I can get from your focus group. Maybe you could suggest some people in similar situations who might be interested to join another round of testing."
“First of all, it's incredibly rude to approach someone when they're naked. Second of all, could you put that –
“Nah, just give me the juicy details,” Tony said distractedly, elbow deep in Iron Man's chest piece. He always loved when he got to blowtorch stuff.
“I know what it feels like to lose control,” Bucky said and Tony was about to cut him off when Bucky suddenly grabbed his arm under the table, an unspoken warning. “I've felt it time and time again. When you've spent seventy years under somebody else's control you learn to recognize the signs of your mind slipping.”
When it finally came he was prepared for it, his stomach swooping a second before a bolt of molten heat raced up his cock and spilled out between them, his entire body shaking with the pleasure. He was vaguely aware that he was making noise, but he couldn't hear it over the thumping in his ears, his vision swimming for a few precious seconds.
I see. I greatly appreciate the work you've put into this proposal. The safety of our nation is our highest priority and having the Avengers as a reliable defense will be crucial in the event of another tragedy like New York or Sokovia.
Tony couldn't help it. He snorted a laugh, covering his mouth when something in Steve's eyes shuttered as he turned his face away. “Sorry! No, sorry, it's just – holy shit, we're going to fuck a
“I'm all yours,” she said, her voice coming out in a rasp, and Steve shuddered so hard that she could see it, his pupils blown so wide they looked almost black as he looked back down at where she was already throbbing for his touch.
A phone rang. Ms. Potts discretely checked her phone under the table, grimacing for a split second before she gave Steve an apologetic smile. “I'm so sorry, I have to take this. Do you mind...?”
"Why do I feel like you built me something?" Steve asked with a laugh on his lips, bumping Tony's hips with his own, and Tony grinned as he pulled him into the workshop.
Steve stepped up to the armor, running his hand over the plating on its shoulder with silent reverence. Tony bit his lip, almost a little nervous as he watched Steve inspect his work.
“That's it,” Steve confirmed, and Tony felt a tiny bit of the tension leak out of his shoulders. No brain zapping then, fantastic. “You might feel a bit of tingling from the electrical stimulus, but it's not harmful in any way, I promise.”
Tony grinned, throwing his arms wide and smirking at the look of surprise that quickly turned into awe on Steve’s face as FRIDAY came in with the dramatic reveal.
“I'm not betting against you, Tony. I've learned my lesson.” He could hear typing as Pepper was no doubt already busy setting everything up. “If we're doing this we're not calling it a giveaway though, that cheapens the experience. It'll be an exclusive meet-and-greet with a chance at a happy ending. Should give us enough legal leeway to get you out of the blowjob thing if the guy ends up being a total scumbag.”
“How do I look?” Tony asked as he stepped out of the bathroom, giving a little twirl to show off his custom-fitted jacket.
“Yeah,” Tony breathed, his eyes widening when Steve pushed in with his middle finger. “Holy shit, yeah, I feel it.”
Steve's hips jerked when Tony clenched down on him, trying to find the leverage to fuck himself on Steve's cock, get him even
“You know I can't resist you, Cap,” Tony whispered right next to him, and Steve flinched away, clapping a hand over his ear. Fury sighed.
He rubbed his palm over his chest, grimacing as he turned back over onto his back, the fabric of his shirt clinging to his pecs, as if –
“Glass?” Tony asked, affronted. “Who do you think I am? This shit is stronger than iron, it won't break.”
Steve grabbed the lube from out of his bedside table, setting it down on the bed for when he recovered enough to get hard again. Then he grabbed the doll's ass, marveling at how plump it was in his hands as he squeezed it, his heart pounding with anticipation. He couldn't believe he was going to do this, but what was the harm, really? After all this was what the doll was made for.
“Happy to be here,” Steve croaked, and Ms. Potts gave him another smile as she slid a piece of paper across the table.
“Let's get to two thousand gift coins for ten spanks,” Tony said, going back to his knees and reaching for the paddle he still had lying around from his warm up earlier. “And remember, every ten is a ticket in the machine, boys. Don't be gentle with me.”
“I just don't want to hurt you,” Steve said quietly, and Tony sighed, pressing a kiss to Steve's neck.
He wasn't really thinking of anything anymore, just enjoying his own touch as his hips slowly started canting up into his fist, pushing his cock through the circle of his fingers. It felt really good, and Steve's thoughts started to drift to his usual fantasies, imagining a pretty face looking up at him from between his legs, with long, dark hair that framed the soft lips rubbing over his cock.
The raffle drum was already at least a quarter full, mostly from that one guy who'd dropped a whopping four hundred dollars right at the beginning of the stream, AssMaster69. For some reason Tony saw a distinct lack of ass mastery in his future.
Steve patted Tony’s thigh. “Because I’ll think about what you looked like just now and I’ll come in thirty seconds.”
"I don't think I have the right scissors for this," Bucky said even as he sat on the bed, letting Tony grab one of his towels and drape it over his shoulders.
“Killed it, as always. As in I can't believe we're not dead yet,” he deadpanned, and she laughed, slinging an arm around his shoulders.
Also, this is the last chapter where we'll see the flip phone formatting. I'm almost a little sad, but also excited to get back to their normal texting :) Thank you so much for reading and I'll see you tomorrow! <3
Steve nodded, sinking a little deeper into their embrace even though the tension in his body remained. Even from this vantage point Tony could feel all the knots in Steve's back and shoulders, so he set to rubbing them out as well as he could, pressing his fingers into all the spots that he knew would make Steve feel good. Steve groaned under his breath as Tony worked his way down the sides of his neck, traveling back up to scratch at Steve's scalp until he started to relax, slowly but surely turning into putty under Tony's hands, his head resting heavily on Tony's shoulder.
Steve averted his eyes, a dark look crossing his face. “I don't trust Ross not to mess with the verdict somehow. And if he does something during the trial I can't be under his command. Not yet.”
Steve sighed as he sat up on his heels, both of them grimacing when he slipped out of Tony in the process. He didn't really know how to put his feelings into words, but he would certainly try. Tony deserved that much.
“Still have somewhere you need to be today?” Steve mumbled against his mouth, and Tony shook his head gently, letting their noses bump together.
“I can see that,” Steve said, his heart sinking for more reasons than one, and Tony gave him a suspicious look.
Please proceed with caution and follow the response protocol detailed in the Sokovia Accords, section 4, article 14, §1-6. Regular updates on the progress of this mission must be forwarded to both me and the UN General Assembly.
When he was finally done he sat back on his haunches, looking at Steve's heaving chest. “Okay, I'm done. That should hold you.”
“That's for leaving me high and dry,” Tony grumbled, still wiping his hand on Steve's shirt. “Live with the stains tomorrow, asshole.”
“Well,” Tony said, propping himself up on a pillow as he gestured at his ass. “Have at it, soldier.”
“You're a pig,” Natasha said flatly as Steve's brow furrowed in a thoughtful frown. He almost seemed a little tense, his hands clutching his beer bottle in a tight grip. Not that Toni was staring at him or anything. “At least Toni keeps it classy.”
"You have a right to your opinion. But also, you're wrong." Tony grabbed the mirror and held it up, smirking when Bucky went very still as soon as he caught sight of his reflection. "Yeah, that's you. Not too shabby, huh?"
“Never,” Steve said, voice hitching on a gasp when Tony got a hand around his cock. It twitched in his grip and Tony hid a smile in Steve’s shoulder at the way Steve immediately started thrusting into his fist.
“My main problem with the Accords is that I don't think we should have to wait for a go ahead from someone else when we see a situation go south. We should be able to choose whether or not we jump in to help.”
“Well, my first thought was the armor, but the ridges don't feel all that good. Trust me, I've tried.”
see. His own reflection was staring back at him from the opposite side of the elevator, his cheeks flushing the more he thought about what this meant –
“In my defense I thought we were.” Steve grimaced and Tony grinned, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck. “So. Where were we?”
It wasn’t until they were in their remote cabin, putting down their bags and getting ready for bed, that Tony realized that he was actually nervous as he looked at the bottle of pills that he wouldn’t be taking in the foreseeable future. He knew that a lot of couples did this, hell, Rhodey had raved about it to him more than once, but Tony had never gone the natural route with anyone. It was a little intimidating even when he thought he knew what to expect.
“Shit.” Tony looked down at Steve whose face was a study in desperation, his hands digging grooves into Tony’s hips where he seemed to be holding on for dear life. “
Steve reached for the glass so slowly that Toni noticed the delay. Their fingers brushed, and Toni almost flinched when Steve's thumb slid ever so slightly over her knuckles, deliberately, before he took the glass from her, his tongue darting out to wet his lips.
Pepper obligingly picked up the phone, raising an eyebrow as she scanned the screen. “The Iron Cougar? Toni, what –“
“Sorry,” Tony mumbled, soothing that spot on Steve's lip with his tongue, and Steve willed himself not to be too disappointed.
They kept kissing as Steve started rocking them together, slow but with purpose, getting the most out of the friction of the fabric between them. Tony had been half-hard since Steve entered the room, so it wasn't long before he felt that familiar tension building in his gut, his fingers clenching in the back of Steve's shirt.
Tony closed his eyes when he felt a pressure in his gut, right before Steve's cock started pulsing deep inside him, and Steve's whole body tensed up before he seemed to melt into the mattress with a drawn-out groan, his face smoothing out into pure pleasure as he came again. Tony smirked.
But he hadn't done it on his own in a while, always spending the nights with Steve, which – yeah, it was probably fair to say that he'd had Steve's dick in his hand a lot more often than he'd had his own. Not that he was complaining.
Tony studied him for a moment, trying to catch up with Steve's train of thought. “Is that upsetting to you?”
Steve gasped when their cocks slid against each other, suddenly aware of how hard he was, heat coalescing at the base of his spine. Tony's tongue slid sinfully against his own as Tony lifted Steve's hips with one hand, the other traveling down until it was cupping Steve's ass, slowly sliding closer to where he was already spread open due to their position.
“Yes, you do, Stevie. You’re cranky as shit all the time now and as long as you insist on being a recluse I’m going to make you have company any way I can.”
“Thank you,” Steve sighed, and Tony hid a smile against his throat as Steve pressed a kiss into his hair.
“Fuck,” Steve gasped and Tony hummed in agreement, still too fucked out to even move. “I didn't know you liked that.”
Steve was quiet for a long moment before he seemed to give in, air rushing out of him in a sigh as he settled down on top of Tony. “Am I crushing you?” he asked a little cautiously, and Tony shook his head, rubbing his hands up and down Steve's tense shoulders.
It was nothing like normal sex felt like. Steve was hollowed out, his stomach achingly empty every time Tony's cock left him, only to be full to bursting when he fucked back in. It felt like he was shaking apart with every thrust, like he was in shambles and Tony was putting him back together, like up was down and down was up, and Steve could barely hang on to what little composure he had as Tony fucked him into oblivion.
“A cougar is an older woman who goes for younger men. And our dear friend Toni over here –“ He gestured at her with his bottle. “- used to be a grade-A sugar mommy. Lots of hot, young guys who'll go for a woman with experience, let me tell you that.”
“No, it’s fine,” Steve said quickly, averting his eyes so Bucky couldn’t read him like a book. “It was… thoughtful. In a very backwards, inappropriate sort of way.”
he didn’t want to remember. And the fear remained that he was still that person, that he hadn't really held himself accountable and nothing had changed.
“Right?” Tony shook Steve in excitement before he patted his chest with careful fingers, not wanting to disturb whatever had set this off. “Look at them! It's like I'm thirty-two aga–
Tony looked at the products listed on the screen, from something that looked like deodorant rollers and sprays all the way to implants. “J?”
Tony looked at him dubiously before he stepped closer, glancing down at the book. Steve saw the moment it sank in when Tony did a double take, leaning over the desk to get a better look, and Steve watched his expression change as he took in the drawing.
Tony kneeled up on the stool with one leg, making the faux leather squeak when his bare shin slid over it. “Hand me that pillow over there?”
Toni shook her head, burying her face in her pillow with a sigh. It didn't matter that Steve kept asking her to go out with him and the team. It didn't matter that his eyes seemed to stray to her lips almost every time she talked. It didn't matter that he held the door open for her after their sparring sessions, always unerringly polite even though she caught him adjusting his pants after she put him on the mat more than once.
“Guess that answers the question of what it wants,” Tony said, his voice a little strained, and Steve felt his nails dig painfully into his palms.
Thank you for your weekly report. The UN is overjoyed to hear that the Avengers are looking to expand not only their resources but also the active team roster. We have forwarded the required documents to Mr. Lang as well as the Avengers legal team. Please don't hesitate to contact us for additional information.
, Tony didn't say, choosing instead to walk over and give Steve a quick kiss that turned much less innocent in about two seconds flat. He pulled away to see Steve looking a little dazed, and grabbed his hand with a smile, dragging him out of the room.
Steve blinked before a smile tugged at the corners of his lips. “Well. There's more where that came from. If you want it.”
“Hi?” A laugh bubbled out of Tony's throat as he tugged at a strand of Steve's hair. “You make me come in my pants like a teenager and all you can say is 'Hi'?”
Steve's face felt hot with shame and – something else that he wasn't going to acknowledge as he straightened his shoulders and glared down at the creature.
“Yeah, they're getting a little impatient.” Tony twirled the blowtorch in his hand. “Then again, when you're immortal I guess time loses a bit of its meaning.”
“Keep going,” Steve gasped, his hips twitching forward of their own accord, and his eyes slammed shut at the pressure on his sensitive –
Tony felt warm with fondness and something else that he only realized was relief when Steve was already kissing him again. He'd never planned on Steve finding out about this, but knowing that Steve not only didn't care, but
Tony kept squirming underneath him, his hips hitching up against Steve's as his fingers tangled in his hair, and
The waved at the waitress as they left, shielding their eyes from the morning sun. For a moment Steve looked out at the city drenched in beautiful reds and yellows and felt a longing so fierce it almost stole his breath away. Bucky stepped up at his side and Steve leaned into him without a second thought, immeasurably grateful when Bucky wrapped an arm around his shoulders and gave him a little shake.
"We should probably -" Steve hissed when Tony sank down another few inches so he could grind directly against Steve's cock. "Fuck. Bedroom."
When he finally came it was slow, starting down in his balls and rising to a crescendo that made his cock throb so hard he could feel it in his teeth as it pulsed his release all over Steve's hand. Steve followed him with a tiny groan that Tony licked straight out of his mouth as Steve trembled against him, thrusting a few more times before he slumped down in Tony's arms, pulling him closer for a tight hug.
Tony turned slowly, his eyes locked on Steve's bare feet before they slowly traveled up his body with such obvious appreciation that it made heat flare low in Steve's gut, his face suddenly hot. When Tony's gaze landed on Steve's crotch a tiny smirk crossed his face that quickly grew as he dragged his eyes up to meet Steve's.
ecstatic!" Tony laughed. Steve could hear the sound of typing over the phone. "You should turn on the news tomorrow around four. Or hit up Twitter, whichever comes first."
“I don't know, Tony, the pictures came out pretty well, all things considered.” He could hear her rustling over the line, probably sorting through important manager business. “You haven't posted a blowjob in over a week. They're not going to care what the dick looks like as long as it's in your mouth.”
He flinched when the doorbell rang, a full ten minutes before his client was supposed to show. Tony frowned, but then cleared his throat and straightened out his jacket, putting on his best welcoming smile as he opened the door.
Tony shattered. He thought he was screaming, his throat raw as his body convulsed in the sweetest kind of agony he'd ever experienced. His eyes filled with tears as he coasted, floating somewhere above his body, but at the same time so viscerally
When he got to the common rooms Steve was already there, his back turned to the door as he put down his travel bag, and when Tony walked in Steve looked up to give him a smile -
“Tony,” Steve said, and Tony looked up right before Steve captured his lips again with an urgency that Tony immediately recognized. He reached down to add his own hand to the mix, grabbing some of the pie debris to push it into the space below Steve's hand, and they both groaned at the added heat of the filling, the gooey slide of it along their sensitive flesh.
Tony's head snapped sideways so fast he felt a crick in his neck as he stared at Steve in astonishment. “What?”
,” Steve groaned, and Tony cursed, one arm wrapping around Steve's waist before there was a blunt pressure at his hole and Tony slipped inside, drawing a moan from both of them.
“Okay,” Steve said gently, and Tony startled when Steve's fingers slid into his hair before he practically melted into Steve's touch although the buzzing in his brain only got louder because he didn't deserve this, not yet – “I can do that. Thank you for telling me, sweetheart.”
“We don't have to go all the way tonight,” she said quietly, and his breathing hitched. “We can stop any time if you're uncomfortable. But I think we're both ready for a little more than just kissing. What do you say?”
the friction felt like nothing he'd ever felt before, sucking at his cock like it was trying to keep him inside. Steve didn't even manage to pull out halfway before he thrust back in on instinct, groaning at the tight heat all around him. His cock was throbbing already, begging for release, and Steve could barely turn his head when Tony made a choked noise. Their eyes met, and Steve's stomach clenched with the same need he could see on Tony's face, his eyes dipping down to look at Tony's cock that was so hard it was standing straight up from his stomach.
“Look at me.” Steve blinked his eyes open, his head turning sluggishly, and Tony gave him a warm smile. “I want you to fuck me, Steve.” Steve's whole body jerked as he choked out a desperate whine, shaking his head again. “I can take it. Come on, Steve –“
Steve had to take a moment to just stare because, shit, Tony with his legs spread like that, just for him – He shook his head, sliding two fingers inside in one go, and Tony huffed out a surprised gasp.
want you to?” Tony asked teasingly and Steve shook his head with a rueful smile, plucking the lube from their bedside drawer.
“Perfect,” he ground out, and Steve moaned, pushing up just enough to get his elbows under him before he started fucking Tony in earnest, forceful little thrusts that rocked Tony's cock against the mattress just right.
Steve stumbled out of bed, grabbing a wad of tissues and wiping his cock and stomach before he kneeled back on the bed to clean up the doll –
Steve laughed quietly, his hands rubbing firm circles into Tony's back. It felt so good that Tony couldn't help the way he melted in his arms. Steve smelled like soap and the bread he'd baked earlier that day, but when Tony buried his nose in his neck there was just warm skin and
“Relaxing your uterus. Getting it settled back into its proper place will alleviate your symptoms, you'll see.”
Wow, straight to the point, huh? “More like his landlord currently. But yes, I've been overseeing his recovery process.”
Tony's frown deepened as he tried to – oh. Wait, no, that couldn't be – “Did you think I didn't want your opinion on this?” he asked incredulously and Steve's eyes dimmed for a split second before he looked away.
“You're not wrong.” She stroked a hand through his hair, and he shivered, dropping his head to prolong the touch and – huh. Toni filed that away for later. “You're still okay with this, right? It's fine if you're –“
“Yeah, I'm out of here,” Steve said decisively, getting up from his seat just as the door banged open and Clint stormed in, Tony hot on his heels.
“Fuck,” Tony said heartily, grabbing Steve's shoulders to pull him closer, need ratcheting up inside him like a tidal wave. “Oh my
“I'm sorry,” Steve whimpered like he hadn't even heard him, his face twisting into a pained grimace as tears ran down his cheeks. “Oh god –“
“Um. Excuse me?” Steve and Fury both turned to see Bruce at the door, his hand half-raised to knock and a sheepish smile on his face. “Sorry to interrupt, but we've had an emergency.”
“I didn't know,” Steve said so quickly that he was almost stumbling over his words. “I love you so much, Tony, but – it just didn't – you smelled all wrong. I'm sorry.”
“Fuck breakfast,” Steve said immediately, grabbing Tony by the hand to lead him into the bedroom. “When you bring me a magic fleshlight food can wait.”
“Oh yes,” Tony purred. “You're going to stand there like a good boy and I'll make sure you have a good time, alright?”
“Come here.” Tony had barely finished saying it before Steve was pushing him onto his back so he could curl his body around Tony's, faintly trembling all over. “Hey, it's okay. Just let it out.”
She came with a shout, gasping through tiny moans as she rode it out against Steve's mouth, fucking herself on his tongue and his fingers. Steve groaned, grinding his face into her, or maybe she was still dragging him by the hair, his free hand coming up to grip her thigh almost desperately, pulling her close like he was trying to keep her there.
He stalled only for a minute before he took the plunge and walked back to his bedroom, eying the package from the doorway. The carton had fallen shut again, and Steve took a deep breath before he went over and tugged the rest of the packaging off the doll.
Tony paused for a second. His clients usually didn't ask questions about his personal interests. He didn't quite know how to handle this.
“It's not weird if it feels good for you.” Tony smiled at him. “Look, I'm limited by my own perception here. But if you say you like the feeling of getting your dick punched, who am I to say that's not valid? I believe you when you say it feels good.”
Tony snorted, smoothing down the lapels of his shirt. He hated to admit it, but being here where he could already smell the traces of dozens of vampires on the premises was making him twitchy with nerves. He felt like an intruder, and knowing that he had Steve with him, without knowing what he was bringing him for, wasn't helping at all. “Yeah, well. They have a flair for ugly architectural design.”
"It's cute that you say that like you have a choice." Tony leaned down to press a kiss to Steve's neck, smiling when he pulled back and saw that Steve had his eyes closed. "Tired?"
“Yeah, yeah, round three later. Come on, get your ass out of bed.” He twitched at a light slap on the back of his thigh, glaring at Steve’s innocent face. “You missed.”
“Thank you,” Steve rasped, his throat suddenly dry, and Tony gave him one last smile before he waved and started to walk away.
, his mind supplied. He groaned as Steve worried his nipple with tiny motions that stung in that specific way that didn't quite translate to pain inside Tony's body. Instead it made his blood sing, his cock throbbing with every minuscule movement from Steve. It felt as if he was the string on a bow, pulled back until it was about to snap, and Steve was plucking at the edges, sending vibrations all the way to the center where they coalesced in a tiny knot of heat that sent waves of pure sensation to the rest of his body.
“Cheer up, Steve. You should always be smiling. It's like the sun rises every time.” Bruce blinked. “A part of me can't believe I just said that.”
Steve's face felt unbearably hot when he realized that it was true. Like this Tony could be touching him anytime,
Steve did, mirroring Tony's posture as he put one knee up on the stool, grabbing the pie tray with one hand and his cock in the other.
you, Pep, it's fine,” Tony said as he opened the fridge with more force than necessary, pulling out a can of cheap cheese. “I have it under control.”
Steve's eyes snapped open as Tony's hands unwound from around his waist, grabbing hold of the back of his shirt instead.
Clint gaped at him, mouth hanging open before he came back to himself with a cry of outrage. “You take that back, you fucking bastard!”
Steve nodded, trying to relax as Tony started pushing inside, but he could already feel that it was going to hurt –
over the years. Responses from other members of the parliament range from surprise to condemnation, with many already predicting the termination of Ross' office. Public outrage was massive, with #FreeTheHeroes and #RotInRaftRoss trending only minutes after the pictures were leaked. Thus far Secretary Ross has refused to issue a statement and continues to give no comment on the authenticity of these photos. We are told that the United Nations General Assembly is planning to hold a meeting to discuss this recent discovery, and can only hope that Secretary Ross will be held accountable for authorizing the construction of this hellhole.
It took Tony a few seconds to regain his bearings when Steve flipped him onto his stomach, pulling his hips up until his knees were propped up on the mattress.
“It’s okay,” Steve said again, but it didn’t ease the knot of guilt in Tony’s throat that was still threatening to choke him. “Just let it out. I’ll be here when you’re ready.”
“If you let me fuck you,” Tony whispered, and Steve jolted as a spike of heat lanced through his gut. God, the fact that Tony could just
He couldn't really describe it, but the air smelled – off. Like something was curdling, turning the morning air into something sour, and the source became immediately obvious as he tried to turn onto his back but couldn't.
“No, I am. That's – that's not the problem.” Steve looked up at Tony, and the open trust and understanding in his eyes finally cemented his resolve. “
Steve hung his head, letting go of his cock with a defeated nod. He could feel tears prickling behind his eyes.
Steve pulled back just enough to see his face, the hint of nervousness underneath Tony's serene smile. They hadn't put a name to what they were yet, and Steve hadn't really thought about it, but –
“Thank you,” Tony blurted out suddenly, grabbing Steve's arm before the doctor could lead him out into the corridor. “This was – just, thank you.”
“Hey, it's alright.” Tony shrugged, and Steve's heart sank at the nonchalance on his face, like he thought Steve couldn't see that he'd hurt him if he just put on a brave facade. “I know I'm a lot. You're not the first one to say so.”
The chat blew up with comments voting for either side when AssMaster69 suddenly dropped another hundred with a message saying,
Obie grumbled under his breath but followed the doctor's directions, giving Tony a warning look on his way out. “Don't you go and omit the details, young man. You tell him what you did.”
Instead of voicing his thoughts he lifted Tony into his arms, ignoring his protests as he carried him out of the workshop, grabbing a blanket for modesty on the way.
Tony leaned up to press a kiss just under Steve's jaw before he settled down on the pillow, feeling Steve's heart beat under their joined hands, just as fast and uneven as Tony's.
“Yeah,” Steve said, leaning down for another quick kiss before he sat back on his haunches and grabbed the fleshlight. “Is it good for you too?”
Bucky held perfectly still as Tony slowly but surely made his way across his head, shaping his hair into a semblance of what he'd seen on old war reels in his childhood, so concentrated on getting the sides even that he startled when Bucky spoke.
Steve made a small noise of protest, trying to pull Tony back into his arms, but Tony leaned back, sliding off the bed.
“Even when I tell you to eat and sleep?” Tony pulled a face, and Steve laughed, dragging their blanket over both of them before he turned off the light. “Come on. You have an early day tomorrow.”
“I could've sworn –“ The officer shook his head, scratching his neck as he looked back at Steve who raised an eyebrow at him.
“I don't! I don't know, okay,” Tony exclaimed, throwing his hands up – or down, seeing as the plant was still holding him up by his feet. “I've never dealt with anything like this.”
“Come on, sweetheart, I can't help if you won't tell me what's wrong.” A sudden thought made dread sink into his stomach. “Did I do something? Are you –”
Steve paused for a second, his heart beating double time, before he smiled brightly. “Yeah, I'd like that.”
. It would almost be comical if the rest of his body didn't match it in that sense, bigger and broader than Tony on pretty much all sides. Tony's hand barely closed around it whenever he jerked him off, and his jaw ached for hours after giving him head. Tony absolutely
“He'll turn visible again in a couple of hours. But until then someone should probably keep an eye on him.”
Steve didn't show any sign of agreement, but at least he didn't protest either as he finally settled down to watch whatever crappy soap opera JARVIS had pulled up for them. Tony closed his eyes for a second and breathed him in, trying to find any trace of a rut underneath Steve's usual scent. He didn't smell anything. Then again, Steve hadn't rutted in all the time Tony had known him, so how could be know for sure?
So yeah, trying to get Steve to relax and enjoy things was an uphill battle in and of itself. But it just so happened that whenever they were lying in Tony's nest, sharing the afterglow... That was when Tony had his best chance to get Steve to let loose and indulge in a bit of tenderness.
He shook his head, sitting up on the bed with a groan as he looked at the clock. Forty minutes until he had to get up for work. Going back to sleep now would only make him more tired later, so he swung his legs out of bed and trudged into the shower, pulling his blanket back over the doll on the way.
“I hurt you,” Steve said, so pitifully that Tony had to just hug him tight for a second, rocking them together.
“Which is why we're here today, isn't it?” Tony said a little testily and T'Challa didn't react beyond a small incline of his head. “And Mr Barnes is still an American citizen. We have our own way of serving justice. So, no offense, but there's very little you can do or say about it. You don't have jurisdiction.”
need a shower,” Steve corrected him, standing up from the couch and holding out his hand. Tony raised an eyebrow.
,” he shouted shrilly before lowering his voice with a glance at the thin walls around him. “What the hell were you
This time Steve followed when Tony gently pushed him towards where he wanted him, fitting his mouth around the base of Tony's cock before he licked a broad stripe up its entire length. The way he tilted his head made the hair on his chin scrape along the sensitive underside, and Tony gasped, his hips jerking up into the feeling.
may expect more than one lawsuit, the most prominent of which would be filed against Tony Stark for perjury.
Tony frowned. “When you smelled –“ He broke off, thinking back to Steve's reaction the previous night. “That's why you knotted me again? You smelled that I wasn't pregnant?”
“I said I don't do that anymore,” she said, her lips feeling strangely numb, and Steve's stance faltered a little before he seemed to catch himself, straightening his shoulders.
“Maybe. Or maybe this helps you more than beating a punching bag does. Just try it out, okay? If it doesn’t work you can just throw it out, no harm done.”
. You think you’re compatible in the physical sense. And judging by what you told me Steve seems to return the sentiment.”
They'd had a lovely evening out at Tony's favorite restaurant, a classic choice as far as third dates went, but Steve would be lying if he said he hadn't been looking forward to this all night. He knew Tony had too, judging by the heated looks and fleeting touches he'd been teased with all evening, but now Steve could finally do something about it. And boy, would he ever.
“It does.” Tony shuffled his feet, feeling like his clothes had become a size too small for his body. “If you don't want me to, I won't.”
He'd never thought of how limiting it had been to try and fuck someone without making any noise, but now that he was free to let his thighs slap against Tony's ass as loudly as he wanted he started to realize that he'd always held back before. And oh shit, this was so much better.
Regarding the arrest of Steve Rogers and James Barnes we have taken note of your intentions. Should the UN or affiliated parties provide us with definite proof of a sighting of either of these individuals, along with a confirmation by the responsible government facilities that the Accords grant jurisdiction to the UN in said location, the Avengers will be happy to cooperate. Until then we have designated what we deem an appropriate amount of resources towards the search for Mr. Rogers and Mr. Barnes.
But until then – HALLELUJAH IT IS DONE. I’m honestly so proud that I pulled through despite all of this bullshit and I’m really sorry for the long delay. Hopefully you enjoyed this chapter and I’ll see you tomorrow for the last one. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you have a fantastic day!
“Good to know you're still alive.” Tony tilted his head, glaring at someone past Steve. “Thanks for telling me where you were going, asshole.”
When Steve finally grabbed his hips with a murmur of his name Tony didn't hesitate to turn around and plant himself in Steve's lap, hearing JARVIS switch the TV off in favor of some soft jazz music. Sometimes Tony could kiss his AI.
Pepper groaned. “Tony, I'll only be able to vet them after the draw, and I can't deny someone their prize if they've already
A particularly good slide of Steve's tongue across his made him moan, and Steve echoed the sound, gripping Tony around the waist as he leaned back against the couch, pulling Tony down with him. Tony took that as his cue to switch it up, cupping Steve's face in both hands as he pushed back, coaxing Steve's mouth further and further open with every swipe of his tongue. It was a bit of a power rush when Steve just
“Tony,” he croaked, and Tony shushed him, sinking down until the head of Steve's cock was pressed against his hole –
“I want us to fuck a pie together.” Steve's face resembled a red stop light by now, but Tony still needed a moment to catch up to what was going on. Steve wanted to –
Tony's brow furrowed as he pondered that. “You're saying that your main problem isn't being under someone else's thumb?”
Tony panted, his voice rife with tension and something a little desperate that only fanned the heat in Steve's gut. “Fuck, Steve, do you even know – God, baby, you feel so good –“
Steve nodded, his eyes rolling shut when Toni did it again, pulling on his hair with a little more force now. She could see his whole body shift as he rolled his hips, reaching down to grab himself –
New format, yay! I'm always really self-conscious when I write this kind of official government-y language so I hope I did okay here xD If you spot any mistakes in phrasing or something, don't hesitate to tell me, I'd love some feedback. Thank you so much for reading!
He watched with wide eyes as invisible fingers undid his zipper and pulled out his cock and then couldn't
Tony hollowed his cheeks, keeping up a nice bit of suction as he pulled off Steve's cock, and he could feel his own cock throb in his pants when Steve's hands found his hair and held on for dear life, pulling it deliciously taut.
Someone was rumbling in his ear, a sound almost as deep as thunder that sent pleasant little shivers all the way down to his toes. Tony felt warm and snug as he sank deeper into whatever headspace this was, somewhere between awake and asleep. He was distantly aware of a smell that lingered in the air, something
“At least it wasn't CuntNCockDestroyer,” Pepper said, and Tony laughed, burying his face in her hair.
“Tony.” Steve was sitting up so straight that Tony's back hurt in sympathy. “If not being in the Council makes you a target, then why –“
“Yeah.” Tony gasped for air as he grabbed his sore neck, trying to catch his breath. “Holy shit, that scared me.”
“I'm close,” he gasped, and Steve's grip on him tightened as he sped up, burying his face in Tony's neck to bring them even closer.
“This whole thing is such a mess.” Tony sighed, rubbing at his eyes. “I don't even know where to start.”
“I'll do it,” he said, his voice raspy, and Tony looked concerned for a split second before he laid back on the bed, shoving a pillow under his hips.
“Yes, mother,” Tony grumbled, but didn't protest when Steve pulled him down into his arms to snuggle him to sleep.
First prose chapter of the fic! It's the missing scene of the last chapter, Tony and Steve dealing with everything. I hope you enjoy it!
“Oh, you know,” Steve said evasively, his bouncing leg giving away his nervous energy. Tony could guess why that was. “Same old, same old. Signed some forms, did some paperwork...”
“We're going alone. Just you, me and Bucky. The rest of the team flies back to the Compound and signs the accords.” Steve opened his mouth to protest but Tony raised a hand. “No, I'm not negotiating this. This is our last chance to avoid Ross' lawsuit and keep everyone out of prison. We have eighteen hours left to bring you in before Ross issues an arrest warrant.” Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve. “You want me to trust you? Then trust me with this.”
Steve sighed in the way he always did when he knew there was no arguing with Tony, wrapping him up in his arms as they settled in. “If you're sure –“
Steve shook his head as he walked further into the room, intent on just cutting the stupid thing down when his boyfriend suddenly let out a choked scream. “Tony!”
“I can tell. You –” He trailed off when Steve gasped, his back bowing right before Tony felt the evidence against his fingers, smearing with every thrust into their joined hands. Tony squeezed him through it, smiling at the choked off grunt when he finally let go and wiped his hand on Steve’s stomach. He didn’t bother dodging the half-hearted retaliating swipe against his shoulder.
“Are they – Tony, what do they do with rogue vampires?” Steve asked with a hint of tension in his voice, and Tony wrinkled his nose.
Steve rarely ever got any letters that weren’t notices or bills, so he was a little confused when he checked the name of the sender. He was pretty sure that he hadn’t recently purchased anything from Stark Industries. Or ever really, considering how damn expensive Stark products were.
The doll wasn't looking at him, but Steve felt seen anyway, uncomfortably exposed as he stared right at the doll's lifeless eyes. After a moment's hesitation Steve moved to the side and turned the doll over onto its stomach. There, that was better. Also –
“You're incredible,” Steve said sincerely, and for a second Tony looked almost uncomfortable before he shook his head and pressed another kiss to Steve's lips.
"I never thought about it like that. I mean, sure, there's the sexual gratification, but maybe there's some possible application in crisis centers or as a tool for trauma patients -" He kept muttering to himself, and Steve sat as still as he could so he wouldn't interrupt him. It was hard to tear his eyes away from Mr. Stark's face though, so expressive and –
“Okay.” Steve grabbed the tray in both hands, leaning a little closer until he and Tony were almost breathing the same air as they looked down at the already messed-up looking pie. “So do we just...”
“I can't wait to have that in my mouth,” he said instead, more honest than he'd meant to let slip, and Steve snorted out a laugh that thankfully sounded more relieved than nervous.
"What else can I do?" Bucky shouted, his calm facade giving way to frustrated anger. "It's over! If they find me they'll lock me in a box and throw away the key and there's nothing you or anyone else can -"
“Your body knows what to do.” Even Steve's voice sounded unaffected, but Tony's brain could not compute the possibility that Steve was this calm when Tony was a complete
“You're gonna split your lips one of these days,” Natasha said drily, and Tony snorted, checking the flavor – coconut, of course – before pocketing it. “Seriously. I know you're insatiable and he's probably making up for lost time, but it feels like we're going to have to surgically remove you from his face if you're not careful.”
Steve shook his head even though Tony couldn't see it and after a moment of silence Tony sighed over the line.
“No buts.” Tony pressed a kiss to Steve’s shoulder, not bothering to hide his grin. “I worked it out with the UN. You can stay here.”
It took a little longer than usual before Steve's knot deflated enough for him to pull free, and to Tony's surprise Steve didn't wait so much as a second before fucking him again, his cock apparently still hard and ready. Not that Tony was complaining, his own cock slowly starting to beg for release as Steve kept stroking him without pause, keeping just the right pressure to be a blatant tease.
“Who cares, he’s here now, let’s get this rolling!” Clint squeezed through the gap between them, dragging them along by the arms to where Steve could already see a mountain of snacks on the couch table. “Jason Bourne, here we come.”
“I’m close,” Steve gritted out and Tony pressed a kiss against his neck, worrying the skin with his teeth until Steve started trembling.
“Make it hurt,” he gritted out, clenching his hands into fists when he could feel a tremor run through them. “I want – I need to feel –“
“Yes, you're absolutely right. I apologize,” Tony said with a twinkle in his eyes as he turned around, his hands clasped over his crotch. “Please, feel free to get dressed. I won't peek.”
“Yeah,” Steve said hoarsely, his heart suddenly pounding at the triumphant look in Tony's eyes. “I can feel that.”
“It's not about your experience,” Steve said hotly, his hands clenching into fists. “It's about how you look at me and don't just see the stars and stripes. It's about how you don't cut me any slack when other people do. You push me to be better and I – I
Steve wiped a tear from under his eye as his laughter slowly died down, shaking his head with a massive grin. “Liberty Man's fine. But he's Nomad in private.”
Tony looked down at himself before he gave Steve an incredulous look. Then he laughed, loudly enough that it echoed throughout the clearing. Steve ignored how the sound made his stomach swoop.
Steve raised an eyebrow along with the book in his hand. Right, stupid question. “So what's the Council?”
“It was a cake, Steve,” Tony sighed, closing his eyes as he dropped his head back to Steve's chest. “I fucked a cake.”
was still in the top fifty on his streaming website of choice, but it had been steadily dropping in ranks over these past few weeks since Tony had been busy with other projects. Right now the real money was in Tony's side hustle on OnlyFans where he provided private pictures and personalized messages written on his body. And, well, posted pictures of random guys' dicks in his mouth.
Then again, how were you supposed to react when you found your boyfriend dangling upside down from a plant in the middle of his workshop?
Tony pushed him up just far enough that he could struggle out of his jacket, taking his shirt right along with it. Steve tugged off his own clothes with military efficiency, and before long they were both naked, staring at each other with obvious admiration.
He drummed his fingers on his thigh, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips. No matter how many outings Obie hosted, he knew now that his unwillingness was his own, not something born out of a mental disorder. But if Obie wanted to keep treating it like it was –
The BAIL for the release of the aforementioned accused is fixed at USD60,000.00 which may be furnished by the accused either by depositing the amount thereof with the nearest internal revenue or provincial, city or municipal treasurer who should transmit the same to this Court, or by furnishing a personal bail subscribed by two or more solvent sureties. The peace officer making this arrest is hereby authorized to discharge from custody the accused after furnishing the bail in the manner herein above indicated which must be stated in the return thereof.
Tony wasn't too proud to admit that it soothed his hurt pride to hear that after what happened last time. “I know.” He brought one hand down just enough to swipe through the mess that was already dripping down his thighs, holding it up to Steve's nose. “Even better here, hm?”
Bucky looked up, quirking an eyebrow when Steve sat down in the chair across from him. “Back so soon?”
Tony paused, blinking himself awake as he moved his arm away from his chest, rubbing at the cold spot on his wrist. What the hell?
Steve grunted, but obediently shuffled up onto his knees so Tony could reach him and pull him into a kiss, his stomach thrumming with arousal when he felt the wetness that got caught in Steve's beard brush against his skin. He reached down to find Steve's hand already on his cock, jerking himself off furiously, and Tony batted it away to replace it with his own. Steve made a choked noise when Tony squeezed him and immediately set a downright brutal pace, grinning when Steve grabbed his shoulders in a vice grip, fucking up into his fist.
And then Steve got it all at once, what Tony was doing, and his heart swelled with such affection that he found himself getting out of bed just to hug him, holding him tight against his chest.
Steve took a deep breath, closing his eyes for a second. By the time he opened them again Tony had lost his shirt and was halfway through struggling out of his pants.
supposed to coerce him into sleeping with him? Not that Steve would seriously consider it. Ever. But still –
“It's that awful b.o,” Sam stage-whispered to Natasha, and Clint flipped him the bird as they started to file out of the room. Bruce caught Steve's eye on the way out, giving him a grateful smile that Steve returned. The Hulk had really saved Steve's ass out there, and Steve had returned the favor by insulting Bruce as soon as he'd turned back. Luckily he'd only needed the one to break Bruce's spell, much to both of their relief.
They were silent after that, both lost in their own thoughts as Tony finished cutting Bucky's hair, cleaning up the edges with his electric razor. When he was finally satisfied he stepped back and nodded appreciatively.
Tony was the one who recovered first, stretching his arms out behind Steve's back before he gently pushed him back so he could rest his head on his chest without jostling the knot still holding them together.
Natasha shared a pointed look with Clint, almost too quick to notice, before clearing her throat and adjusting the paper.
Or they were willing to be killed or arrested for their cause. That level of devotion would be dangerous for him and Tony because it meant these men had nothing to lose.
Steve just smiled and moved his arm from underneath him so he could lay a gentle hand against Tony’s jaw. He stroked his thumb over Tony’s chin and lightly over his lower lip to get Tony to stop biting it nervously.
Clint dropped down next to Tony, from where Steve could not determine, and whistled. “Brutal. We had your suit on the jet, Cap, but there wasn’t really time to...”
“I won’t say that it’s always been easy, Tony,” Steve started. He’d never actually spoken about this out loud with anyone. “I definitely was confused for a long time, thinking there was something wrong with me or that there was no one feeling the way I felt- like I didn’t belong. I thought I was in love with Peggy, I really did. But I think I was just so grateful to have a woman interested in me for once. And she was so beautiful and confident and sure of herself.” All of Tony’s attention was on Steve, with focused intensity.
“Had enough yet?” Kray asked. His cocky gaze on Tony prompted Steve to get his first look at him in hours. Tony was breathing heavily too, his shoulders rising and falling rapidly as he tried to hold onto his control. “No?” Kray asked.
Steve was finishing up the steaks when he heard the elevator doors slide open. He checked the time on the stove- 7:01 pm. He smiled and wiped his hands off, turning in time to see Tony round the corner.
“Tony, I haven’t come to terms with it either, not really. I’ve become quite good at compartmentalizing, which helps me continue to function but isn’t actually healthy,” Steve said. “When I let myself think about it, it drives me crazy the way they used me against you. And I feel like I never should’ve asked you to refuse their demands at the cost of watching them...” Steve trailed off as Tony shut his eyes. He spent a moment simply rubbing Tony’s side, until he was able to meet Steve’s gaze again.
Steve laughed at that. “Yeah, I have a suspicion that she might already know, or at least suspect something.” When Tony raised an eyebrow, Steve told him, “I ran into her and Clint in the kitchen right after I left your lab this morning.” Tony smirked and Steve both hated and loved how cocky it made him look.
“I just don’t know if-” Tony cut himself off, taking a deep breath like he was preparing for a battle.
Steve felt heat curl through his stomach and make his neck hot. Yeah, he needed to do something about this. But he didn’t know how to even begin. He looked down at Tony’s hands on the desk, the solder burn from days ago still slightly visible.
“Well, so have I,” Steve said. “Tell him to meet me in my apartment.” Hill raised an eyebrow, but gave Steve a single nod.
The boss barely spared Steve a glance, eyes remaining fixed on Tony as he sauntered further into the cell. “Tony Stark. An honor to meet you, really.”
With that, Fury saw himself out, his leather coat rippling behind him. When the elevator doors had slid shut, Steve thought that he could really use a shower now. And then an enormous meal. And then, at least, one good night’s sleep.
“I’m just...tired, Steve. And I’d much rather be spending my time with you- preferably in bed,” Steve bit back a smile. “But I can’t because I let you down.” Steve started to respond, but Tony cut him off. “It’s my job to make sure no one wishing us harm can get in and out of this tower, but it happened and you were hurt because of it. I can’t make up for it, but I can ensure it never happens again.”
Steve gave Tony a fond smile. “That’s right. Absolutely nothing.” Tony couldn’t completely tell if Steve was being sarcastic or not, but he decided to let it go and just enjoy the moment. He didn’t know how much longer he had of Steve.
That didn’t leave a lot of options for what might’ve happened, and Steve didn’t have any explanation.  All the doctor had said on the phone was that Tony had been in an accident hours ago with minor injuries, and that no one else had been hurt.
“I don’t get it. Why won’t you just be honest with me?” Steve asked. He didn’t sound angry, just confused. “What is it you think will happen?”
“Tony,” Steve began softly. “I know my own feelings. And I won’t let someone else tell me how I feel.” Tony looked up at him, chastened, and Steve took a deep breath. “I can’t tell you that nothing will go wrong because I don’t know that. What I can say is that what I feel for you is...it’s intense. If you don’t think this- whatever’s going on between us- is worth exploring, I’ll respect that...”
Steve nodded reluctantly- even though he wanted to argue with Tony- because he knew it was what Tony needed in that moment. Tony knew how Steve felt on the matter, but he couldn’t expect Tony to change his mind just like that. Steve could certainly be just as stubborn when it came to his own irrational anxieties.
“It’s not about ‘deserve,’ Tony. Plenty of people that ‘deserve’ second chances don’t get them. But you got one, whether you wanted it or not, and you didn’t waste it,” Steve said.
They’d been underneath SHIELD headquarters in New York, barely fifty miles from Stark Tower. Steve’s grip tightened around the gun in his hands. He needed an explanation, and he needed one fast. But first, they needed to get out of immediate danger.
The bars screeched as they took new shape, and Steve grunted with the effort. He was superhuman, but he wasn’t Iron Man. The thought made him smile to himself, despite the circumstances.
“Uh, no,” Steve said, rubbing the back of his neck. He looked extremely soft and sleep-warm, and Tony wanted desperately to drag him back to bed. But it had been established that he didn’t like what came with sleep. “Did- did you sleep any more after...?”
Steve reached for it, and this time, didn’t stop his fingers from softly grazing the back of Tony’s hand around the healing burn. His fingertips lingered there, and he didn’t pull away. Neither did Tony.
Steve had no idea what the full scale of the damage had been, but he couldn’t imagine that it had been easy for Pepper to see. That was probably the other reason why she’d wanted it fixed as soon as possible.
“But I want to,” Steve insisted, making Tony sigh. “You listed all those things about yourself like they should scare me away, but you do realize that I deal with those parts of you already just being your friend, right?” Tony kind of scowled at him, but Steve could tell he wanted to smile. “And there’s no need to get a ‘complex about your age.’ Technically, I’m ninety-four years old.”
“As well as I could’ve hoped, I guess,” Tony said. Steve raised his eyebrows, hoping to get more than that. “I can’t tell you exactly,” Tony said carefully, “but just trust me. I’m gonna fix this, Steve.”
He didn’t care that his teammates were probably laughing at him right now. And he still hadn’t eaten breakfast, but his mind was focused on a different meal. He had a dinner to plan.
Steve looked back at him. “You did,” Steve said, earnestly. Tony blinked at that, but eventually nodded. Neither of them said anything for a minute but Steve could see how exhausted Tony was. “Try to get some sleep,” Steve said.
“I’ll head up and make us something. Join me in half an hour?” Steve asked. Tony nodded hesitantly. He felt like he’d missed something. But Steve just smiled at him and kissed Tony on the cheek, before striding from the lab.
His split lip twinged a bit at the pull of Steve’s lips against his, but he didn’t let that stop him. It did of course draw Steve’s attention once they’d pulled away. Steve’s smile had turned down at the corners slightly as he traced his thumb over the cut.
What Tony hadn’t taken into account when he’d agreed to this was the fact that a glistening, sun-warmed Steve was very hard to keep his hands off of. Not to mention the trunks he’d given him to borrow were definitely too small for Steve, unless he was going for a European look. In which case, they fit him perfectly.
He watched Steve march out of the lab, his hair still sticking up on one side, probably permanently until he eventually showered. God, Tony was so lucky.
“Hungry there, Cap?” Bruce asked, with a quirk to his mouth. Steve gave him a sheepish look, but could only nod with his mouth full.
“Steve,” Tony said, hesitating briefly before hopping down off his desk and facing him. “Please tell me that coffee’s for me.” Steve held the mug out for Tony, who took it and immediately gulped half of it. “God, I totally forgot about coffee yesterday,” Tony said with disbelief. “I didn’t even think that was possible.”
Tony was mostly thrilled that Steve was here, but he was also dreading the inevitable questions. So in an attempt to avoid that conversation for as long as possible, Tony was bent over his workbench, tinkering with the Mark 42 when Steve entered the lab behind him.
“Yes, well. I’m glad that you’re glad,” Steve motioned at one of the armchairs. “Please sit down, sir.”
“I don’t want you to be...disappointed,” Tony continued, and Steve felt his stomach drop unpleasantly at the admission. “It might take me a long time to come to terms with everything that happened. I might never...” Tony trailed off. Steve turned fully on his side so he could face Tony head-on and wrap his arm around his waist.
“I haven’t told him that yet,” Steve admitted. It had felt good to say out loud, but it would feel even better to tell Tony.
“Yeah, well,” Steve sat up a little in his chair, scooting closer toward Tony and grabbing his hand.
Tony nodded with a small smile. “I’m attracted to men and women, yes,” Tony bit his lower lip. “I guess I'm just surprised with how sure you are about me- about what you feel for me.” Tony was looking anxious, like he was testing his luck by bringing up any doubts about them.
It made him realize how acquainted to this century he’d really become. He remembered a time when nothing felt familiar here. Everyone he’d known before the war had died, except Peggy, of course, who Steve only visited when he was feeling particularly selfish or masochistic. But it didn’t hurt like it did before. Not now that he had a family and a purpose.
He followed Tony through several doorways that seemed like they would usually be locked, especially with the alarm that likely signalled a security breach. When Steve gave Tony a look, Tony shrugged. “I might’ve installed a virus in the security system. Just to make things a little easier.”
“So.” Tony's fingers traced over the paper for a moment longer before he shut the book and slid it across the table. Steve took it back with a lump in his throat, knowing that whatever Tony said next would determine the future of their relationship – “You didn't draw any nudes.”
Tony yelped as his arms were grabbed by more vines, pulling him up so instead of hanging upside down his hands were now pulled over his head in a tight grip, stray leafs wrapping around his arms to make them completely immobile. “Oh my God, it's – fucking
So instead he turned to the table, studying it with a critical eye. There was a hole cut out in the middle, leaving space for an attachment that Tony didn't recognize, shaped like a large sphere with cables running along the inside of it. But other than that the apparatus it stood on looked just like a regular power source, nothing out of the ordinary. Or at least nothing that suggested electro shock therapy to the brain or anything of the sort. Which was a relief. A small one, but still.
Tony rolled his eyes as he walked past, taking in the entrance hall. It looked just as boring as the outside, which he supposed was the point. A single concierge was seated behind a big, grey desk, standing up as soon as they entered the room.
“You still love me, right? Even though I'm a weirdo?” Tony asked, and Steve gave him the most beautiful smile, cupping Tony's cheek in his hand.
The remaining signatures of the Avengers team have been verified by our legal team. With regards to the fact that the established deadline was not met, plus the recent attempt to escape the country, the UN has come to the following verdict:
“Oh, don't get me wrong, I'm excited,” Pepper said, her tone distinctly lacking any kind of excitement. “Let me finish this and I'll give you a hug.”
Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s for a better angle when Steve started rocking them together, pulling not even halfway out before he came right back, his cock dragging lazily against Tony’s inner walls. It felt a little like being caught up in the ocean tide, a seamless back and forth, and Tony turned his head to kiss Steve just as slowly and gently as Steve was fucking him. Steve’s hand came up to touch his face, so lightly that it made goosebumps ripple across Tony’s skin, his lips tingling with every brush against Steve’s.
“You're not going to hurt me, Jesus Christ,” Tony said, blowing out air through his nose as he propped his hands up on his hips. “If anything you'll hurt yourself. Fury told me about the risks.”
Tony asked and Steve could see the effort it took him to process that. “Wait. Fuck, so that therapist – the HYDRA killings –“
Tony hissed out a savage curse as he picked up the pace, fucking Steve so hard that he could actually
“I am,” he said desperately, holding on to Tony's hips as tightly as he dared, but Tony's mouth twisted with something so close to pain that it physically hurt Steve.
Thankfully Steve got the gist without Tony needing to say anything, never breaking the kiss as he pushed Tony's thighs up against his chest and started fucking him with sure strokes, licking firmly into Tony's mouth. Tony shivered, using his grip on Steve's hair to push him downwards, a moan trapped behind his teeth when Steve went straight to where he needed him, licking a tight circle around Tony's neglected nipple.
“You're a fucking cheater,” he murmured, and Steve chuckled roughly, nosing at Tony's chin before he pressed a kiss to it.
Steve looked at him for a long moment before he cleared his throat, obviously caught off guard. “Right. Okay.”
“I don't care what you say, no more vodka for you, young lady,” Toni said with a wag of her finger that Natasha only laughed at as the group walked off. She turned towards Steve who gave her a shy smile that absolutely didn't make her stomach swoop. No Sir. “Okay. Follow me, I know a place.”
“You're in luck. One of his patients cancelled, so he should have an open slot in about half an hour. He'll fill you in on the whole procedure then.”
Steve only let him pop out of his mouth when he was completely spent, and Tony opened his eyes when he felt the bed rocking, creaking with every thrust as Steve fucked the mattress, breathing heavily.
“Oh god, Tony, I can't –“ His whole body was shaking, trying desperately to hold on. “I'm so close, Tony,
At this point I cannot say for sure. It depends on whether or not the UN agrees that the implementation of these accords is necessary. But after what happened in Sokovia I am fairly certain that they will.
He felt around for a bit, trying out different angles as she directed him, but eventually his movements got smoother as he got used to the motion, keeping up the angle that made her squirm on his hand. Toni couldn't hold in a moan at a particularly good stroke, and saw Steve's face light up with a proud grin.
Tony laughed, and his smile made Steve’s stomach flip. “Yes, I can confidently say that I know that about you.” Steve smiled back. “Steve, I feel like I’m falling in really deep, really fast with this- with us. But I think I’m ready to just...let myself have this, you know?”
Steve turned an unbelieving gaze to Tony. “Sixteen hours?” Tony released his hold on Steve’s hips and tried to turn away, but Steve held onto his waist stubbornly. “Tony this is...I hadn’t realized it had gotten this bad. How are you standing? Let alone working?”
“And so I do what I know. I fight. I’m a soldier, and I can’t stand bullies. So I fight,” Steve bit his lip, his expression overflowing with memories that he could never fully share with Tony. “And even doing what I knew, I was a little lost. I kept...trying to convince myself that I would come to terms with what I left behind, and feel at home in this time, but the truth is that I might never fully feel at home here. There’s always gonna be a part of me that wishes I could go back.” Tony’s chest constricted at that thought, but Steve wouldn’t let him hurt for long. “But with you, Tony...you feel like you could be my new home, you know?”
Steve’s skin was cold from the water and the sand had clung to him wherever he was wet so that Tony was similarly now covered in salty water and sand. He didn’t mind in the least.
Nat pursed her lips and looked down at the counter, before meeting Steve’s eyes head-on. “I’m not at all surprised, no, seeing as you just went through something pretty traumatising and life-bonding with each other. Not to mention the looks you’ve been giving each other for months, and how pleased you were yesterday.”
Steve took a deep breath and nodded at Tony, before they both straightened from their crouch and started running toward their teammates. Hawkeye was the first to spot them, obvious by the arrows that started picking off any people aiming guns at them.
When the only sounds in the silence were both Tony and Steve’s breaths, Kray pulled a gun from his hip and shot without warning at Steve’s right leg. Steve was unable to stop from crying out in his surprise, and Tony immediately struggled against the hold the two men had on him.
Steve smirked and looked down sheepishly. “Well, you have work to do,” Steve said. “And I have work to do.”
Tony couldn’t help the pleased sigh that escaped his lips at the feeling of Steve’s arms around him after weeks without. Steve nosed along Tony’s neck and behind his ear, the action reminding Tony of the bizarre fact that Steve seemed to like how he smelled.
Steve hated it, but he didn’t know what had brought it on. “Tony, you’re not seriously suggesting this is your fault,” Steve said.
He felt Tony breathe against his cheek and a hand came to rest around the wrist that clutched Tony’s neck. But he wasn’t pulling Steve away. He was holding onto him. And he was kissing him back.
He’d only just dislocated Steve’s knee and almost definitely broken his left shin bone, when Kray reappeared. The last strike to his leg had pulled out a strangled shout from Steve, but it was by no means the worst pain he’d been in. He was definitely aching though, and breathing quite heavily from both the pain and the exertion of keeping his reactions in check.
“Couldn’t make you too comfortable or you wouldn’t have any motivation to get the job done. Speaking of which,” at that, the boss did look over at Steve. Steve sneered back at him, but the boss only smiled again. He didn’t have to say anything for Tony to get the idea.
But they were also grown men, and they had jobs to do. Even if there was no love really for SHIELD, Tony was pretty sure Steve’s willingness to help had something to do with his lingering devotion to Peggy Carter, who’d helped form SHIELD in the beginning. Anyway, Natasha had gone with him, Barton had disappeared god knows where, Thor had returned to Asgard, and all of a sudden it was only Tony and Bruce in the Tower.
Thor went off, probably to surprise hug Tony, but his words confirmed what Steve had already guessed. Whatever Tony had been doing in Kray’s lab, he’d somehow sent a signal to the team so they were able to find them.
The test would’ve gone great- should’ve. But after receiving a headache and a split lip for his efforts, JARVIS was probably onto something with the whole ‘seventy-two hours without sleep’ thing. Or he could start looking into Mark 43...
“Just a suit? Come on, Cap. Put any one of these guys in that suit and it becomes hostile. The suit is only as moral as its pilot.”
Steve sat up carefully, his breathing shallow to prevent jostling his ribs too much. He glanced down at his right thigh, where the bullet wound had stopped bleeding. Steve didn’t let himself think twice before digging out the bullet, breathing through the pain and the instinct telling him to stop.
“Steve?” Tony’s voice was soft and unsure. Steve didn’t know if he’d ever heard him sound quite like it. He wanted to hear more sounds he’d never heard, if Tony would let him.
“Tony,” Steve breathed a sigh of relief. He shuffled closer on his knees to the bars that separated them. “Don’t panic. How do you feel?”
“Tony.” Tony lowered his head slightly to catch Steve’s eyes, but didn’t speak. “Talk to me,” Steve said. It took another beat, but eventually Tony spoke.
He also wanted to get closer to Tony to make sure he wasn’t banged up at all. He looked alright from the outside, but Steve had no idea what kind of twisted things Kray might’ve been saying to him all day.
“Just tell me this,” Fury continued. “Is there anything I should know right now? Anything that could be a threat to national security?”
“Well, I thought maybe we’d...” Steve trailed off, inexplicably shy when it came to this sort of talk. But Tony knew exactly what Steve meant. “Yes. That. Let’s- do that,” Tony nodded enthusiastically and Steve grinned, hitching Tony higher on his hips before heading briskly for his bedroom, while Tony worked valiantly at sucking on Steve’s jaw until it bruised.
“I-I’m interested, Steve. God, I’m more- I’m...” Steve slid his other hand around Tony’s back, feeling the muscles flex under his hand and pulling Tony closer until their chests touched. Tony grabbed onto Steve’s hip, and his breath came faster between them. They stood there, almost kissing, but Steve was waiting for Tony to close the gap. He’d been brave already. Now, it was Tony’s turn.
Steve chewed it over for a moment. “Just that a man named Kray was behind this. They were after Tony, and I was an unintentional addition,” Steve said. “They wanted Tony to build a device- a large-scale sonic taser- but he refused.”
“I’m sorry, Tony. But please don’t worry about me,” Tony scoffed, but Steve talked over him. “I’m serious. The serum will heal me. There’s almost nothing they could do that would cause permanent damage.”
“Nat, the more time I have to convince Tony that we’re better together, the less likely that anything will be able to break us apart,” Steve said, earnestly. “Tony’s already self-conscious enough as it is about all of this. He’s reluctant to let himself have something good, afraid he’ll mess it up somehow and drive me away.” Nat didn’t react, but Steve could see it was a reflection of some of her own thoughts.
Eventually, Steve followed Tony into sleep, soothed by his serene breathing and thoughts of a long future ahead of just this.
“Technically, it’s probably the same amount of water as if we’d taken two separate showers, since we’ve probably been in here the length of two showers,” Tony argued. “So we’re not saving any water, but we’re not totally wasting it. Plus, this is giving me ideas about creating an independent filtration system for the place. That way we could be in here as long as we wanted and all of the water would be recycled. Then, you wouldn’t have anything to complain about.”
He’d moved his face closer while he’d been talking, or maybe Tony had moved closer. But now their foreheads were nearly touching, and Steve could feel Tony’s shaky inhale. And it was easy for Steve to close the remaining distance.
Steve chanced a visit down to Tony’s lab and surveyed the damage. It wasn’t as bad as Steve thought, although it was clear that the major debris had been carted away. When he asked Natasha about it, she told him that Pepper had hired a team right away to begin rebuilding. ‘It was about the only thing she could do to distract herself,’ Natasha had said.
Steve smiled and pulled a stool over to Tony’s workstation. If he ignored the gaping hole in the ceiling, he could almost pretend that the last week had never happened. He watched Tony for a moment as he sipped his coffee and messed around with his holograms in ways Steve might never fully comprehend. He was wearing a soft-looking black t-shirt with a logo on the front that was probably some band Steve had never heard of.
Tony had refused Kray outright and Steve had nodded to him in reassurance. But Kray had simply said ‘We’ll see,’ and disappeared with his men without another word. There hadn’t been a glimpse of them since, and Steve guessed that they were probably planning on starving them out for at least a day before trying again. No harm in trying to break them down when they felt hungry and weak.
Tony’s voice gave out, and he stared down at his hands on the workbench, trying to collect his thoughts. He didn’t think he could look at Steve and see pity in his eyes. But Steve always surprised him.
“No, Steve,” Tony protested, looking a bit desperate. “Please just- let me explain.” Steve didn’t know if he wanted to hear more, but he nodded reluctantly. “I know you think you want to...be with me-” Steve bristled at how condescending that sounded. “-but you don’t realize what it would actually be like. I’m a very difficult person to get along with, I’ll be the first to admit. I’m better in small doses.”
“Maybe not,” Tony relents, but he isn’t done. “I just-- in that cave, I realized I had nothing and no one, at least where it counted. Ten years later and nothing has changed.”
If Tony was up this early, it likely meant he had never gone to sleep in the first place.  Staying up all night working on new tech was hardly a strange occurrence for Tony, at least from what Steve had observed since the team had moved into the tower.
As he plated the food, he stole glances at Tony, mostly because he couldn’t help himself. He really wanted to kiss him, but he wasn’t quite sure where they stood with each other. Tony had definitely enjoyed their earlier meeting. But they also hadn’t talked about it at all. Steve thought they needed to have that conversation before they went any further. And it seemed like Tony needed to get something off his chest too.
Hey, just wanted to text you good night :) You might be sleeping already, but some business at SHIELD ran long, so I’m only just getting back to the apartment. Call me in the morning
“What do they want?” Tony asked. Steve hesitated, but they would tell Tony soon enough. “No, let me guess,” Tony interrupted. “A weapon.” Steve frowned over at him, and Tony just nodded his head in resignation. “The bomb was in my lab, so they were targeting me,” Tony continued. “You were probably a bonus in the whole thing-- incentive for me to cooperate, no doubt.”
“Music off, please, JARVIS,” Steve said. Tony dragged his hands down his face and looked up at Steve, smiling wearily. Steve leaned his hip against the desk next to Tony’s stool and looked down at him. “What’s goin’ on?”
“I wasn’t driving one of my cars.  I mean...” Tony faltered.  “It is mine, technically.  It’s just...”
“Bruce!” Tony said. “Missed you yesterday, buddy. I need your opinion on something I’ve been working on.”
It had been fun for a while- science bros doing sciencey things all hours of the day without interruption. But eventually, Tony realized he should maybe start acting like the owner of a multi-billion dollar tech conglomerate, and get on a plane to LA. Even if tinkering with toys in his lab was what led to said ‘conglomerate,’ there was boring paperwork and meetings that needed his attention. And without Steve in New York or more than half of the other Avengers, Tony felt like he was in a state of limbo.
Steve felt a jolt in the pit of his stomach.  He knew Tony hadn’t been getting much sleep, a more obvious fact since they’d started sleeping in the same bed years ago.  But it had never affected Tony this way during the day.  Steve remembered when it had been an issue at the beginning of their relationship, how he’d had to trick Tony into sleep in any way he could think up.  It had slowly stopped being a problem over the years, and Steve had almost forgotten about it.  But Tony had begun staying up late hours in the past couple weeks, with seemingly no explanation.  Steve felt a little ashamed that he hadn’t thought to really confront Tony about it.  He needed to work harder to force Tony to rest.  But it still didn’t make sense.
Tony just looked up at Steve with resigned eyes, like he’d made up his mind about this. Before Tony could respond, the footsteps were returning quickly.
“Why does there always have to be something wrong with me, Cap? Why do I always have to be the one breaking down?” God, he hated when this version of him came out. But Steve was starting to piss him off. “Kinda seems like you want to fix me or something. Well guess what, Cap? Many have tried and all of them failed.”
With one last glance at Tony’s lips, Steve reluctantly stood up from the stool and walked toward the lab door. He could feel Tony’s gaze on him as he left, making him smile to himself.
“Those are weapons, Tony. But the suit itself...ammo is not what makes Iron Man. You are Iron Man. Without you, the suit’s just...a suit,” Steve said.
Blade had discovered after the first hour that having more knives meant he could in fact leave some of them in Steve, and that this would obviously prevent the serum from healing the wound. What he didn’t fully realize- and what Steve was dreading- was that the wounds were trying to heal internally around the blades, and that when they were eventually removed, Blade would tear the wound open again. It would be painful.
He had changed into a gray henley, the buttons undone at the top to reveal his collarbone, but wore the same ripped jeans he always wore in the lab. Steve wondered if he’d ever stop feeling that heat in the pit of his stomach when he saw Tony. He hoped not.
He reached room 708 and grabbed the clipboard hanging on the door, taking the time to look over it before facing Tony.  Broken wrist, minor scraping and bruising, collision induced CAD, which Steve knew were just fancy words for whiplash.  Steve had been informed it was minor, but it was good to have all the injuries laid out in front of him.  He always made sure to know the extent of every team member’s injury after a big fight.  His chest ached momentarily at the reminder that this hadn’t been a fight, at least not with other players involved.  He needed to talk to Tony.  The thought pushed him to replace the clipboard on the door and turn the doorknob to enter the room.
“Was that our first fight?” Tony mumbled into Steve’s chest, a teasing note in his voice. “As a couple, I mean.” Tony could feel Steve’s huff of laughter like a breeze against his neck.
“It could be...try ‘Elm’,” Tony hardly seemed like he was paying attention, but Steve had learned that Tony could focus on multiple things at once.
Steve gave a small laugh and rubbed his hand against Tony’s smooth back. “Sorry, I was just enjoying the view. I like this one, too,” Steve let his eyes wander lower, before returning to Tony’s face. Tony was grinning and shaking his head at Steve.
Tony nodded and took a deep breath, closing his eyes for a second.  When he opened them again, he looked a lot more relaxed.
“Yes, dinner,” Steve said. “And maybe we could talk. About stuff.” Tony nodded and fidgeted with his hands, not knowing where to look. Steve could practically feel him vibrating with nervous energy.
“Sir has slept approximately five hours in the last three days, Captain, and sixteen hours in the last two weeks.”
When Tony was returned hours later, his hands were cuffed and each arm was held by a guard. They deposited him back in his cell, at which point they removed the cuffs. Tony waited until the guards were out of sight and hearing distance, before coming over to the bars between their cells. Steve closed the distance between them so they could talk quietly.
“I’m gonna go on a quick run and then we can eat,” Steve uttered against his lips. Tony nodded, appreciating one last moment of running his hands across Steve’s back, before releasing him.
“To think I caused you any pain, even incidentally. And to imagine if our situations had been reversed...I’m not okay,” Steve said. “But we will help each other.” Tony nodded and leaned in to kiss Steve softly.
The words caused Steve’s chest to ache as he remembered he’d said something not so different when he’d first met Tony. But he knew now that Tony’s greatest weapon was his mind. Let these men think differently. They’d figure it out soon enough.
“No, please don’t look like that,” Tony shut his eyes momentarily, rubbing the crease between his brows. “I- Steve, the last thing I want is to hurt you.”
Tony began to stir, so Steve ended his examination of his scars, letting his hand rest again on Tony’s stomach. Tony shifted his own hand on top of Steve’s, lightly tracing the tendons with his fingertips.
Steve grimaced as he felt one of his broken ribs shift. The rest of his body would heal in time without a trace of the trauma done to him, but he needed to get the bullet out of his leg before it fully healed. If he didn’t, he’d have to reopen the wound and dig it out.
When they came upon the next set of guards, Steve raised his gun but Tony threw something and grabbed onto Steve, tugging him behind the corner as it exploded. Steve looked at Tony with raised eyebrows. “Any other surprises?” Steve asked.
When Steve woke up a few hours later, he was a little sticky and a lot warm, but nothing outside of an Avengers call to assemble was gonna make him move from this bed. Steve was curled around Tony’s back, his arm slung over his waist. He could feel Tony’s heart beating steadily through his back, and it made a deep ache of longing flood through Steve’s body. No one else had made him feel like this, and he couldn’t understand how he’d ever thought he was in love before now.
He couldn’t really comprehend how big the news of Iron Man and Captain America dating would be to the world. It was so much bigger than just him and Steve, even if Tony wished it wasn’t. They were just two men, after all. But that’s not what it would be for a lot of people. For some, it would be news that would give them hope, maybe even save their life. But for some, it would be unthinkable, disgusting, wrong. Tony was afraid the public reaction might even ruin him and Steve if they let it.
Steve watched him go, wondering how he could even find Tony’s walk attractive. He glanced at Bruce when Tony had disappeared around the corner. He probably would’ve kissed Tony if Bruce hadn’t been here. Part of him wanted to be able to do those things in front of the team, but he also wanted to keep certain things private. Maybe over time, Steve wouldn’t have to overthink everything so much. He would just do what came naturally.
Steve’s eyes returned to his face, as his fingers settled into the dip of his spine. “Yeah?” His hushed tone matched Tony’s, although there was no reason they should be quiet, except that it made them seem more alone somehow- more intimately isolated.
Steve nodded and penciled the letters into the crossword. That meant thirty-nine down could maybe be ‘Scour.’ Steve tried it out and skipped fifty across (clue: ‘Guy,’ which at the conclusion of the crossword would read ‘Dude,’ a word he’d never used nor ever would’ve guessed) when Bruce strolled into the kitchen.
Tony furrowed his brows, but didn’t feel sorry for himself for too long. There were more pressing matters in the world that needed to be dealt with-- matters that didn’t care if Tony didn’t get to wrap his arms around Steve every day, even if it severely bummed him out.
He finally opened his eyes and took in what he could of his surroundings. He was lying face down on top of Tony, who was still unconscious. There was a cut on his forehead that was bleeding slightly, which pointed to something hitting him in the head to knock him out. Steve moved his head slightly to check that there wasn’t blood coming from Tony’s ears, which there wasn’t, thank God.
And the way he said it made Steve’s heart drop and his chest ache. He was suddenly having a hard time breathing.
Steve sighed again, this time annoyed. “You know, I’m trying to be really sappy and say something sweet to you, but you’re ruining the moment.”
Steve cautiously pulled himself closer to Tony. He leaned against the bars so that he was facing him. If he focused, he could feel the bone in his shin shifting slowly back into place, and he shut his eyes with a groan. When he opened them, Tony was looking at him with worry.
But Tony just grinned at him, and rested his hands on Steve’s hips, his thumbs tracing the waistline of the swim trunks. “Are you kidding?” Steve laughed and shook his wet hair in Tony’s face, causing him to sputter.
And this was all only after a few hours of being with the man. He hadn’t even really talked to Tony, like he’d planned, about where this was going. All he knew was that Tony was willing to take a chance with Steve, and Steve loved him for that display of trust.
“Well, you're far past having made up for them, Tony,” Steve finished. “The only person who hasn't forgiven you is yourself."
“Tony,” Steve breathed into his ear, his name infused with so much else that Tony had to clutch one of Steve’s hands around his waist.
Tony nodded and winked at Steve. His expression wasn’t anything like it had been yesterday. He looked like the Tony that Steve had grown to know- charming and confident and whip-smart.
At the sound of his name, Blade stopped playing around and dug the tip of the knife into Steve’s shoulder, dragging it across his chest. The suddenness of the cut made Steve breathe in sharply, but he recovered quickly enough, steeling his features into a hard mask. As they watched, the bleeding stopped and the cut began to heal, slowly but still faster than average.
Steve looked at Tony’s earnest expression and felt his heart pounding. He nodded carefully. “I’m ready too, Tony.”
Steve gave him a teasing smile. “I was having a lot of fun about ten minutes ago,” he winked at Tony, causing him to laugh. He looked at Steve with an affection that Steve hoped he deserved.
He used the hours alone to examine his and Tony’s cells. He thought he’d figured out where the cameras were, almost entirely camouflaged within the wall yet still detectable to his eyes, but he had no idea whether they were recording sound or not. They would just need to assume that they were, and not talk about anything Tony was likely planning. Steve knew that there was no way Tony was building that sonic taser. He didn’t know how, but Tony always found a way to use technology to his advantage.
Steve was proven right when three figures came to a stop in front of Tony’s cell. The one in front seemed to be in charge of the other two, but didn’t really seem like the boss, if Steve had to guess.
Tony huffed, and raised his eyes to look at Steve across from him. “Other than a splitting headache and a sore back from my little nap on this stone mattress, I’m great,” Tony said, grimacing as he sat up fully. “What happened?”
At some point, after they’d been lying in an exhausted but comfortable quiet, drifting in and out of consciousness, a phone started vibrating somewhere. Neither of them could be bothered to move (Tony didn’t know if he could, even if he wanted to). But JARVIS interrupted the peace of the moment.
“Tony,” Steve spoke from across the room, his hands now down at his sides. “I must be the one person that understands what you’re talking about better than anyone.” Tony looked up at him uncertainly. “I come from a time when half of the inventions and technologies of today were unimaginable, and pretty much considered impossible. Yet I wake up and I’m surrounded by the impossible. Every day, I’m learning something I didn’t know before and it’s...exhausting. And on top of that, there’s almost nowhere that feels familiar anymore-  not like when I was a kid.”
They wanted Tony to build some type of large-scale sonic taser that would incapacitate anyone within a 5-mile radius. Apparently, it was based off of a design that Stark Industries had never approved for mass production many years ago. It had clearly affected Tony when Kray had told him, so Steve guessed he had some sort of history with the device.
“I like being here with you,” Steve continued, taking another bite of his apple that drew Tony’s attention to his jaw and throat. There was no way Steve wasn’t doing that on purpose, and the smirk on his face was a good indication of that fact. Tony shook his head around a fond smile, and leaned his forehead against Steve’s warm shoulder briefly before straightening back up. “The ocean is beautiful. Could we-- I’d like to go to the beach, maybe. If you’re not too busy. I know you can’t just drop everything because I’m here.”
And they would find Kray together too, and settle this whole terrible business. They would move on and meet new villains and experience new injuries. The team would break more things that Tony had to fix. Steve would finally draw Tony like he’d craved, many times in fact. And even if SHIELD was compromised and forced to shut down, the Avengers would carry on somehow. Because that was what they did- what they’d always do.
The next several hours weren’t Steve’s favorite, but they might’ve been Blade’s. He’d never seen someone take such perverted delight from torturing others. He could tell that this part of the process was a means to an end for Kray, but his henchman took real pleasure in the undertaking.
“Can I expect a response from you on that by Monday?” Steve asked. Fury raised an eyebrow and there was a beat of tension, before he actually laughed.
Steve hummed against his neck, and Tony could feel the reverberation from Steve’s chest against his back. “Thought I’d surprise you.” Steve’s hands slowly caressed Tony’s abdomen, and Tony longed to feel those palms against his bare skin. “Missed you.”
Steve smiled and patted Thor on the back. “I’m fine, Thor,” Steve said. “And Tony, too. Although medical should check him for concussion symptoms. He hit his head during the explosion when we were kidnapped.”
Tony looked at him, this man who had been through so much. Who was born in 1918, yet was somehow here with him as a twenty-eight year old. A man he might never have met if the universe or whatever hadn’t decided to bring them together. A man who he was pretty sure he was in love with, if not intensely infatuated with.
So here he was in Malibu, trying to work with Pepper on his company and assure board members that he was as invested as ever, even if he was also an Avenger on the side. The rub was that Tony was in fact a little distracted from the company (see the above seventy-two hours without sleep because of tinkering with Iron Man suits).
“But he’s wrong, Nat. If we all went our whole lives denying ourselves happiness because we were scared, no one would ever be happy. And we could be missing out on something great, that might never have gone wrong if we’d given it a chance.” Nat looked down at the counter again. “It may be selfish, but I won’t deny myself or Tony this, Nat. I can’t. Not even if it ends in flames. Which I don’t think it will.”
Steve laughed and held Tony’s hand to his chest, rubbing his thumb over Tony’s knuckles. It was harder to kiss while smiling, but they tried valiantly.
“Please come to bed,” Steve said, biting his lip because he could tell Tony got distracted when he did so. “All of this will be here in the morning, and it sounds like you won’t get any further with it tonight.” Tony was indeed distracted by Steve’s lower lip. “I’m also being selfish because I’d really like a repeat of last night...and maybe we could try your room this time.”
Tony tasted like coffee and he smelled like his cologne, and Steve hadn’t realized how much he craved the combination until that moment. His facial hair scratched against Steve’s chin, and Steve might’ve groaned a little bit at the sensation.
The words made a frown appear on Tony’s face, one that probably meant Kray had given something important away.
“I just worry about if something happens one day that you fundamentally can’t agree on- the kind of effect that would have on the Avengers would be...” Nat trailed off, looking sad, but convinced of her opinion. Steve thought about what she was saying, and he couldn’t imagine what kind of situation would warrant Nat’s worry, but he thought he had a pretty good argument.
Tony didn’t ask him why or act disbelieving. He just tugged Steve closer and nipped his ear, before murmuring, “Well then, I am very impressed. And honored.” Steve gave an amused huff and let Tony glide his fingernails up and down his back, using his place on top of Tony to grab behind his knee and hike up his thigh around Steve’s waist. Their position made it very obvious how Steve was being affected.
“I know what you meant, Steve,” Tony interrupted. “And I’ll do my best, but I’m going to break eventually. I’m not...strong enough.” Tony’s voice sounded defeated, already.
“Sure thing, Captain,” Fury shook his head. “I’ll try to put it down on paper, if I can.” Steve nodded and shook the hand that Fury held out to him. “Get some rest, Rogers. You might be back to work sooner than you think.”
When there was a big enough gap, he braced his back against one side and used his legs to push the gap apart wider for him to fit through. Tony watched as he did the same thing for his cell.
Steve had set two places at the dining table, but when they sat down to eat, it felt a little awkward being so formal with Tony. He also felt strangely far away from him, with it only being the two of them across from one another.
When Tony emerged from the lab half an hour later, it was to the smell of cooking tomato sauce. He walked into the kitchen and was greeted with Steve plating spaghetti and meatballs. Tony was pretty sure he couldn’t even muster up toast with the ingredients in this kitchen, let alone spaghetti, so he assumed Steve had bought groceries.
“Steve? What-” Steve shushed him. He held up a finger at Tony’s curious expression. The beeping was getting quicker and Steve had a terrible feeling in his stomach.
“Wow,” Bruce said, almost to himself. He cleared his throat. “I mean, that’s- good, right? Are you two...” Bruce seemed not to know how to finish the question, but Steve got the idea.
Steve pondered what Tony had said moments ago, and wondered if he should say the words that were on the tip of his tongue. He thought it would come out sooner or later, so now was as good a time as any. “You’re my first, you know.” Tony’s eyes snapped to his, but they weren’t judging him, only considering. “I mean, I’d never...had sex with anyone else before,” Steve finished.
Steve made a vague sound of acceptance, but didn’t let himself relax.  He still had a lot of questions.
“Morning,” Tony mumbled. Steve lifted his head to look at him, and couldn’t help but give him a small, soft kiss which quickly turned into a languid, unhurried make out session. Steve thought he could do this all day, but his stomach gave a sudden growl, causing him and Tony to break apart with a laugh. “I think I might’ve interrupted your dinner last night, Mr. Rogers.”
Steve smiled and shook his head.  Tony had always insisted on being the last one to say ‘I love you’ ever since they’d started saying it.  No matter how many times they battled it out, Steve always let him win.  For some reason, it was something Tony needed.  He let his gaze linger on Tony’s peaceful expression one more time, before relaxing into his chair and getting some shut-eye of his own.
“Well, I’m not,” Tony said in a hoarse whisper. “I can’t do this, Steve. I can’t watch them-- You don’t know what it’s like...”
Tony blinked up at him in thought, but eventually shook his head. “Can we talk in the morning? I just don’t want to think about it right now.” Steve nodded in understanding and gave Tony a soft kiss, before laying his head down and pulling Tony against him.
Before he could even react, he felt a sharp pain in his neck, followed quickly by darkness flooding his vision. As he felt his body start to fall forward, he used his last bit of strength to aim for the ground next to Tony. Steve felt unconsciousness gripping him, but he tried to fight it to hear something from these captors that could help them.
“I know you don’t want to see me in pain,” Steve continued. “But I don’t want to be responsible for innocent people getting hurt or killed either. If you think you’re about to break, just remember that giving in will hurt me more than any form of torture would.”
He stroked Steve’s side until his breaths were long and deep, signaling he was asleep. Tony knew he wouldn’t get any more rest tonight, so he slipped out of bed as carefully as he could, threw on some jeans and headed down to the lab. Maybe one day, his method of distraction would mean he could sleep easier at night. But not tonight.
