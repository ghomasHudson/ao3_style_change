With one hand splayed out over Sherlock’s belly and the other lining himself up, John pushed forward. Lava seemed to consume his cock as the burning tight heat enveloped him. A low possessive growl came from John throat as he lowered his hand to start stroking Sherlock. There were little twitches around his cock with every jerk of Sherlock’s.
This chapter has some dub-con verging on non-con oral sex, so please check the tags and know what you are about to read is dark and disturbing. If you've made it this far though, it is not as upsetting as the last two chapters.
“Yeah, it’s me. Are you okay? Greg told me you were, but I had to come and make sure,” the boy rambled on while John rubbed the sleep away from his eyes. It still had to be nighttime, but John smiled inwardly as it brought back memories of Jim waking him up when there was a strange sound around their camp. The boy was a good friend, maybe a little intense, but a good friend, nonetheless.
With one last pat to the boy’s bare chest, Sherlock began preparing his work station. He laid flannels and towels on the other side of the bed, rolling John over to lie on top so plaster wouldn’t spill on the bed. Next, he brought over a tray with the rolls of plaster soaked gauze, a bowl of water to trigger the chemical reaction, scissors, and some soft cotton cloth to protect his boy’s delicate skin from the gypsum.
“Sh-Sherlock,” his whole body shivered from the contact that one piece of skin was receiving. The boy was amazed at how different it felt form when he wanked himself, though he had no idea why it should be any different, but it most definitely was. If he had a choice he would never go back to doing it solo again. When the slippery warm hand stopped, John involuntarily bucked his hips, searching in vain for more friction.
“Ha! No, it was delicious, I was just…never mind, I’m fine let’s get back to the applications, yeah?” John tried to brush it off, refocusing on the papers.
With that, John jumped out of bed and made sure his gown was tied in the back, because the last thing a spy needed was to have his bum exposed for everyone to see. He made his way to the door and poked his head out to find the hallway empty save for a few nurses running from room to room.
“Wh-What happened? Sherlock, why are…” he could see more awareness come back into the boy’s eyes and knew their next exchange was critical in keeping John calm.
“Great,” John said with a mouthful of pillow. “Thanks for that.”
“What?!” all three Subs asked at once.
“Put. The. Bagel. Down,” Mycroft told him, standing up from his seat.
“Well then why did you tell me it was an emergency?” Greg asked, exasperated. The man looked tired, Sherlock noticed. There were bags under his eyes and by the grey dust on the cuff of his sleeve, it was obvious the hunter had freed a vampire today.
Although he said ‘thank you,’ John didn’t reach out for the glass, so Sherlock used it as an excuse to get closer to the immortal beast. Slowly, Sherlock made his was around and onto the bed, sitting cross-legged next to John.
“There he is!” a man yelled, and the next thing John knew two men lifted him up, one on his feet and the other on his torso.
“Sherlock,” John smiled at the man who felt so deeply for him. “I’m okay, I’m okay,” he laughed, when Sherlock continued to inspect his entire body.
He took off his trousers and jumper, then pulled on a yellow Adidas shirt that was made out of a material called ‘slim fit,’ and then replaced his boring white y-fronts with blue boxer briefs. John frowned at the mirror when he saw how the shirt clung tightly to his frame, because all though he had a flat stomach, he still hadn’t achieved any definition in his abs like most of the football players did. However, he did like the briefs much better than the pants his mum bought him. As soon as he started to get flustered and unsure, a ‘ding’ came from his mobile, which was in his trousers hanging on a hook.
“You can’t take Sherlock out into the sun,” he said, a tad breathless. Mycroft leaned against the bed post, his face a tad more pale than normal. “He’ll…he’ll…” before the words escaped his lips, his lover collapsed to the floor.
“To make a phone call,” Sherlock said, “I want you to meet someone.”
Mycroft takes care of the wounded. John has an unexpected moment with Sherlock.
If you have never been to WestQuay, then my description is spot on and you can ignore the sentences above this one. LOL.
“No, I want to get this over with so I can see Sherlock again. When can I see him?”
"Time to go, kiddo. We’ll pick up some food on the way,” Greg promised. “Alright, up you go,” he reached out and plucked the girl from Sherlock’s lap as if she weighed nothing. Instinctually, she wrapped her arms around his neck and her legs around his hips, though his hand on her back and under her bum would have kept her from falling. Her eyes closed again, drifting back into a sleep only children could manage.
“Alright, fine, but no asking the kid questions about what happened until we get him back to the station.”
Greg threw his phone on top of his jacket in the passenger seat. His hands grew clammy as 221B neared, but he steeled himself. This was the only way he knew how to help, and if he called 999, he was sure Mycroft would be informed. “Bloody bastard,” he growled, thinking back to how he let Mycroft manipulate him for the sake of his family’s wellbeing. Once all of his family died, though, Anthea sent flowers and a notice that his services were no longer required. Now that he was a man with nothing to lose, Mycroft couldn’t lay a hand on him.
“You can’t-“
“Sure, well, have a good night,” Greg said and left the room with Molly in his arms.
The hunter didn’t hesitate. He grabbed a bag of blood out of the box and tossed it to John. “Here you go,” John practically cooed to him, which oddly enough made him feel better. Sherlock’s hands shot out like a cobra and grabbed the bag. Within seconds, he had his teeth latched onto the plastic and was draining the contents.
He had made love to John so many times that he would have lost count if every single one of them wasn’t in his mind palace, and still, the small hole enveloping him remained tight. John grunted, lost in the friction of Sherlock sliding in and out, pushing and pulling with every thrust of his hips.
“Sh sh sh,” Sherlock hushed him as he placed the head of his cock between John’s cheeks. “It will all be over…well, I won’t lie to you john, this isn’t going to be over soon.” With that, Sherlock began to press forward, his hands holding John’s hips so he wouldn’t swing forward. Sherlock smacked one cheek hard, then squeezed it as his cock finally popped inside. He gave a loud sigh, as if he had finally arrived home from a long day’s work.
Another deep shout from Sherlock, and then Mycroft was done. “Good job, Sherlock,” he said, pulling out the gauze wrap. John was surprised at the lack of condescension in the older Dom’s voice.
“Mycroft, must you be so intolerable?” Sherlock shouted from the kitchen, making John’s mind click the name into place.
“Oh Sherlock, don’t play coy with me,” he said, laughing and pushing his way into the living room, dropping his bag next to the couch and plopping down with the same force. “I’m not one of those oblivious detectives like that Lestrade character you insist on playing with. We have the same connections, Sherlock, now tell me all about him before I go up there and find out for myself,” Jim smiled and crossed one leg over the other, looking towards the stairs.
“Sorry, here let me clean you up, yeah. Then we can go snuggle before bed.” John nodded slowly, exhausted from having two orgasms, and let Sherlock move him around like a rag doll. “I promise it won’t hurt next time, love, you know I would never intentionally put you through pain. That’s just how it always feels the first time, understand?”
“Sherlock,” the monster grunted, “how nice of you to join us,” he spoke in a sickly high pitch, digging his knees into Sherlock’s groin and elbows into his chest. He growled and when he was able to get on top again, the figure below him changed…
“Push for me,” Sherlock said, pinching a bit of tender flesh on the inside of John’s thigh. “Come on, show me what I put in you.”
“That’s bullshit and you know it.” Of course Mycroft knew. He had planned the whole damn thing. Greg knew what happened, but how was a different question all together. Did he see John and him at the mart? Was John’s phone tapped? Was his? Greg’s head began pounding again with the different scenarios running rampant through it. He squinted his eyes together until Mycroft finally took pity on him.
“Did you just-?“John looked down at the brown curls with both horror and arousal pooling in his stomach but broadcasting through his blue eyes.
“John! John, stop it!” Sherlock shouted at him, bringing John out of his bliss. “Why did you do that?” he asked, and before John could answer, Sherlock continued. “If you want bliss you need to ask me. You can’t do it on your own, do you understand me?” Sherlock was furious, his grip on John proving it.
I hope you all enjoy!
“Put him in the hospital wing, the containment chamber. I want him in the same building as Sherlock until we know what’s really going on.”
“Won’t hurt us? He’s a bloody vampire, Sherlock! Of course he’ll hurt us! That’s what they do!”
“It is obvious Subs cannot control themselves. Half of the Rebels have already died from the overdose of bliss in their system. All because this Irene woman told them it was okay to create their own bliss! It is not right and there is no way in hell anyone is going to agree to that, especially Doms.”
Sherlock ran his hand over the parchment, knowing that this was John’s true life, not the simple existence he lived in Southampton. No, John was just wondering around waiting for his lover to come along and save him. And save him, was what Sherlock was doing while his boy slept peacefully in his new home, his real home.
“I don’t know, John but you’ll be okay, I promise.”
Without thinking, and overwhelmed as the rage turned to consuming guilt, John smashed his body into the window, shoulder and head taking the brunt. “Stop!” Sherlock commanded, but in the height of his emotions, John was invincible and continued to slam into the glass.
Perhaps it was the fact that he had his arm twisted behind his back by a naked man in a bathroom or that it was just in his nature but John’s snark got the better of him, once again. “I don’t know, ‘sir,’ do you feel the need to let your brother fuck you all the time or just when he Doms you?”
Chapter 15 – Something’s Not Right Here
“Well, you’ve seen it now and you can’t tell anyone,” Sherlock said, releasing the man’s arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
“They don’t have RDD,” John heard himself say, though he had no idea why he was talking. “I’m the only fucked up one. Me,” he hit his chest hard in case his Doms didn’t know who he was talking about. “They’ll get good homes?” he asked hopefully, because if what Greg was saying was the truth, then turning his friends in would be the best thing.
“That’s not what I meant,” John growled, anger starting to build in his gut.
John was even more confused than before.
“That will be fine Detective Inspector,” Mycroft replied, nodding his head once and then fixing his stare towards John.
page to see if I've updated early. So, here it is, folks! Let's get back into the swing of things, shall we?
Jumping in the BMW he rented for the weekend,
Within another minute, John could hear shouting from around the house, panicked voices filled the front yard as the neighbors realized someone’s house was on fire.
“Yes, I would imagine so but he is a strong lad and I have the best psychiatrist working with him. She’s trying to help him realize what happened to his mind, I believe.”
“None of your business,” Sherlock stood up and pushed his way past his brother to get inside and out of the heat. “Why did you have to send me to this hell hole anyways, whoever says they like this much sun is either eighty years old or lying or both. At least in jail I wouldn’t be subjected to deducing seniors who haven’t realized their spouse is cheating on them with someone else in the same ‘active’ community.” Sherlock spat, thumping himself dramatically back onto the sofa, which was an odd shade of sea foam green. “Oh yes, I picked up a few brochures for you. This one looks rather nice, they have crochet and water aerobics every Wednesday,” he pointed to the pamphlets on the table.
He took a deep breath, then smiled at the sound of harsh breaths coming from the other end of the phone. “Okay?”
When their breathing slowed, Sherlock stayed inside of John and laid them down together so they spooned on the living room floor. His length grew soft inside his boy and finally slipped out, making small wads of thick come drip down John’s arse cheek.
Sherlock placed different smelling ointments and disinfectants on the raw burn, making John hiss in pain. Then, he would stop and stroke down John’s back lovingly, playing with his bullocks or his hole a bit until the pain died down to just a constant ache and start tending to the wound again. Finally, Sherlock had patched him up, peppering kisses around the gauze before he lay back down on the bed, placing a long arm and leg over the boy’s body. “Go back to sleep, we can do the front tomorrow,” Sherlock said, his breath warm on John’s ear.
“You outbursts are going tiresome,” Mycroft pinched the bridge of his nose. “I would like to remind you that the doctor gave the go ahead to use the shocking mechanism in your collar, two hours ago.”
It took him all but three minutes to grab his suture kit and a few other supplies. He ran back downstairs and thankfully found the man still waiting for him. “Good man,” John said, as he kneeled down in front of him. “What’s your name?” he asked, trying to get the kid’s attention away from the wound on his hand.
A tooth filled grin creeped across the man’s face when he saw the boy had used his entire name. Sherlock had already known his full name, date of birth, and home address, but John didn’t know that; and now he trusted the man on the other side of the phone with this valuable information.
“I’m fine,” John said, his voice sounding raspier than normal. “I just-” he rubbed his head slightly, feeling a large lump just at his hair line above his left eye. “My head does hurt a bit. What happened?”
Sherlock pulled out his mobile to see where John’s mother was. The little green blip was at the WestQuay Centre, so Sherlock grabbed one last cab and got off a half a mile down the road from John’s old house. As he walked up, the neighborhood was still as empty as it was the last time he broke in, as if they were all helping him get John away because they too knew this wasn’t the place for him. He slipped the note, without touching it, gently into the post box and made his way, one last time, into the Watson home.
John took a moment, picturing Sherlock holding him in bed, rubbing his hand over his belly, calming him. With his body filled with bliss and absolutely zero fear, John jumped through the flames, not feeling as they touched his skin. Sherlock was lying passed out on the floor, his face black with smoke. “I’ve got you, it’s alright,” John repeated what Sherlock always told him.
“Yeah, just a bit distracted I guess.”
“What?” John asked, flabbergasted and a little offended that Sherlock thought he would let someone drown.
“Huh?” the man said, turning around to face Sherlock. Before the man could even scream, Sherlock was on him. It wasn’t graceful or clean, but when Sherlock finally latched on to the man’s neck, he felt unimaginable warmth flood his body. It was of someone finally turned on a radiator after a month in the freezing snow. It filled Sherlock up and there was no way he was going to stop. Until…
Sherlock felt his cock twitch, when his boy didn’t even question how he tripped or if the casts were even necessary. All his little John was worried about was if he had accidentally hurt the man and if his lover was worried about him falling.
“Deal. Now, do you want to see what I’ve found out?”
“My feet just-just started moving and then I got scared and…and I wasn’t really going to hu-hurt that lady, Sherlock, I really wasn’t!”
John scowled at the man’s words, placing his hand back on the door.  He watched for a moment as the trees and cars flew by in the opposite window, the colors melding together like water colors. “You’re taking me back?” he asked, already knowing the answer and already knowing his solution.
“But he doesn’t need you, Sherlock,” Mycroft told him but it was obvious in every aspect of the other man’s features, his posture, that John had cracked during the month they’d been separated.
“Yes, yes, please,” Jim said, remembering what Greg told him about manners, and that it was easier to catch more flies with honey than vinegar.
“John…he…is he okay? I mean, he texted me he needed help, but-“
“You guys know I can hear you, right?” John scoffed, limping into the house.
Hey everyone,
“But John, what if they get you? You said they can dom you, right?” Harry asked, worry in her voice at the thought of her little brother getting caught.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said, pulling John into a tight hug, making sure to press his hardness against the boy’s hip, “I’m sure you are exhausted. I shouldn’t have kept you out so long, John. Let me talk to one of the officers and get you a ride back home while I finish up here, yeah?”
Until I can figure out how to put a permanent link for a translations of this work, I'm just going to copy and paste the links here.
Greg smiled and reached up to run a hand through John’s hair. “It was my pleasure. Now go back to sleep.”
“Mycroft,” Greg started, his words stuck in his mouth.
“You cheated, Mycroft, it was closer to him than the paper weight and the breakfast does not count either. Look at him, the boy’s half starved.” Sherlock made a dramatic gesture, waving his hand up and down towards John. “A ten year old could have commanded him to eat. I will not let you skew the statistics with one-time circumstantial evidence. It’s obvious he would have thrown the fork at your head if he wasn’t using it to shovel food into his mouth.”
Just as Greg turned to go, John spoke up, his voice cracking from the screaming he had done when they put the collar back on. “Umm, Greg,” he called, causing the Dom to turn back around, though he still didn’t wake the sleeping girl in his arms. “Thanks for bringing Molly by. I really…erm, I really appreciate it.”
“John?” he took a step towards his boy, “I think I might actually need a shower, do you…um, well you don’t have to, but I’m sure you feel pretty gooey too. If you wanted I could wash you, you know like give you a massage. I’m sure your back is soar from lying on the couch. Like I said you don’t have to, but…” It amazed the detective how quickly John responded to him when the teen thought Sherlock was having second thoughts or nervous. If that was the case, he could provide a whole vat of honey for his little fly to feast on.
“No! Don’t take me away from him! Please! It’ll kill him!” John’s screams died down as the drugs worked their way into his system. Mycroft narrowed his eyes at the beast, considering his words carefully. There was little known about the shift, and Mycroft wasn’t taking any chances when it came to his brother.
“What do you think?” John snapped, but knew better than to jerk his head away from Sherlock’s hand. The sight already hurt, and, he would never admit it, but was grateful that Sherlock helped him get dressed.
Once Sherlock had printed the new picture John had sent him, he lay on his bed, holding it to his chest. Finally he came all over his chest again but he didn’t care, for his mind was no longer a maelstrom of chaos, John had calmed the waters and now he could sleep.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock, John, how are you boys feeling?” Greg asked, taking off his coat and hanging it on a hook. The older Dom walked over to the armchair and plopped down in it, crossing one leg over the other.
“Without any drugs to knock you out?” Greg asked, shocked.
“Tedious. I’m going to start the shower, send him up when you’re done,” Sherlock waved his hand, then turned, his robe swishing dramatically behind him as he strode up the stairs.
Even though the temperature outside was chilly, John’s hands and feet were sweating profusely. He had agreed to go talk to the other Subs, but now that his collar was removed and he was on his own, John was utterly terrified. Scratching nervously at the fresh gauze on the back of his neck, John kicked at the pavement, waiting for Sherlock and Greg to give him the go ahead.
She sighed once, answering him as she turned her back like it was nothing, “he said he would wait,” it was everything.
‘No!” John whimpered, his eyes forcing themselves closed. His body was betraying him. But, vampires were selfish beings, John knew. His body needed to heal itself, whether Sherlock needed him or not.
The first order of business was to construct the suicide note of one John Hamish Watson, age fourteen. Ever since he was a boy in year two of primary school, Sherlock had become a master at handwriting forgery; stemming mainly from having to forge his mother or father’s signature or parent note when he got into trouble or didn’t want to participate in one of the school’s ridiculous field trips or projects. Now, he was able to copy any form of handwriting to the letter as long as there was a proper example for him to use. Luckily, there were at least a dozen forms with every character lying on their coffee table, all written by John.
Hello(: Thank you so much to everyone who has commented and left kudos, they really make my day and encourage me to keep writing.
“You and I both know that’s not your best option right now John. I’m not here to hurt you, I’m here to help you…unless, you are content with the lies you are being fed and being a traitor to your kind. Are you John? Are you okay living with two men who care only about the collar the forced around your neck? Are you okay with them lying to you until you don’t even know what the truth looks like anymore?” She fixed him with a steely gaze that rivaled even Mycroft’s.
“You know I’m gonna beat you right, you really want to challenge the varsity goalie?” John laughed but was soon knocked off balance from his board. Mike had shoved him, then cheered and started pushing to pick up speed towards their destination. “Bastard,” the boy laughed, throwing on his helmet and pushing off hard to catch up to his friend.
“No,” was all John could say. He had to keep reminding himself of those poor souls at the kennels.
Everyone murmured to their neighbor, making John feel uncomfortable. The woman nodded to him, and took a step back. A man took her place and smiled at John. “John, I think everyone was quite impressed with your fortitude. You aren’t the largest of sixteen year olds,” he said, making everyone laugh.
tugged on some of the boy’s wiry pubic hairs. John huffed a bit, pulling himself out of the twilight sleep he’d been in after Sherlock had marked him so completely.
He gave a quick thanks to whoever was watching out for him that Sherlock still hadn’t come back, and quickly turned on the tap and began stripping out of his soiled clothes. It was surprising how much calmer his mind was that he was able to take of his clothes and get into the shower without the man’s piercing eyes watching him like a hawk. He worked the knob to adjust the water to warm but not hot, when he heard the older man come in with the extra towels. “You okay?”
“Then, he drove all the way to the WestQuay to pick me up and then we went to one of the coffee shops, where he bought me a latte and went back to 221B.”
John looked at Mycroft, who gave away nothing, then placed his crutch against the wall. Slowly, he made his way over to Sherlock, situating himself on the bony lap. A deep sigh tried to roll off his tongue at the safe familiar position. Sherlock’s bad arm rested gently in John’s lap, while the other grabbed a piece of breaded chicken and dipped it in a red sauce. The pain in his leg seemed to melt away, but he was clear headed, unlike when Sherlock overloaded him with bliss.
John actually giggled at the thought of that pale face with dark brown waves covering his eyes. He pulled on his grey pants, jeans, and red shirt before he texted back.
“I’ve got you. I won’t let go, I promise,” Sherlock whispered into his hair, confusing John even more. The declaration made him feel terrified and comforted at the same time but still going off the nightmare he just had, John decided to go with terrified as the dominate emotion.
Sherlock smiled when he saw the riding crop, thinking how beautifully John would moan as the black leather hit his skin. However, he didn’t like the fact it might leave scars on that precious skin. No matter though, it would give him reason to hone his skill so it would only be painful but not permanent. That right there was what he loved about John or better yet, loved what John did to him. The teenager made Sherlock a better person, normally he would scowl at bumps or blockades in his plan but now, he looked at them as opportunities for improvement. Yes, they both needed each other and the detective knew how lucky he was to finally have his John.
“Yes, but I’m handling it, no need to worry about the big bad spider,” Sherlock grinned, trying his best to act confident even though he had to admit, Jim was unpredictable even for the ‘worlds only consulting detective,” and that terrified Sherlock, especially now that he had John to look after.
Sherlock sat up, placing the vial on his little table and then picking up a small torch. He crawled back over to John, straddling his hips again. John could feel Sherlock’s erection pressing into his belly, and it scratched at something deep inside him. But John was old and had self-control, so he simply ignored it.
“Oh John, why don’t you ever believe me when I tell you that you’re beautiful and I love more than I've ever loved anybody in the world.”
“Sleeping’s boring. Why sleep when I have a vampire chained to my bed?” Sherlock said quickly. He rolled in a side table with a blanket draped over the surface. There were quite a few bumps under the cover, but John couldn’t discern any items. That worried him.
Sherlock laughed, his tone light hearted. “But of course, my dear Doctor Watson. Would you like a fifteen minute start this time? And Vatican Cameos for stop, yes?”
“Please,” he said as he slowly grasped the laptop, making sure not to frighten the boy into doing something rash. John had always been a huge boulder sitting on the edge of a cliff just waiting to tumble down. However, over the past month Sherlock had done his best to build stilts and braces under the unsteady boy but when there are gusts of wind and monsters with saws out there trying desperately to cut away the supports, it was almost impossible to keep him safe.
“Hmm,” Sherlock said, still not looking at John. “Not until you bite me.”
“Sherlock, wait, I-I don’t think I want to do this yet.” John stuttered out and was completely thrown off by what the man behind him whispered next.
“Yeah, sorry, I’ll just be a minute,” he heard John’s shaky voice from inside his little sanctuary and knew that he was right in predicting the boy’s panic attack. A moment later, John stepped out of the room and Sherlock noticed how much he loomed over the boy. He could feel the gaze upon his chest, knowing how small John must be feeling and thought it best to move back over to a sitting position. He placed his hand on the small bony shoulder, leading him back over to start the next phase of their plan.

Greg couldn’t stifle the laugh as he helped his friend to stand. “Do shut up, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, getting his brother’s arm over his shoulder to support the man’s wobbly knees.
“No,” Sherlock matched his strokes to John’s on the video but soon became frustrated when the boy still had his hand under his clothes, forbidding his lover to see what was going on underneath.
“I’m sure you know where they are-“
“I wasn’t wailing!” Sherlock actually whined at his brother. John could tell his Dom was hurting by the way he reverted back to almost childlike interactions with his brother. John only smiled slightly and headed over to the armchair.
“Sh-Sherlock,” the teen’s cheeks were bright pink, as was his chest, from arousal, pain, and the hot water still beating down on them. He couldn’t imagine this ever feeling good, the uncomfortable fullness he felt on the inside and the burn at the entrance muscle was horrible.
Sherlock's POV directly after the events of chapter three. An unexpected visitor shows up at Baker Street.
John rubbed his eye with the palm of his hand, so he didn’t glare up at Sherlock. “Alright, guys,” Greg said, looking back from the driver’s seat, “I believe this is your stop.”
“No!” John twisted his hands in their expertly tied cocoon of knots. “I’ve had enough of this game, now bugger off and let me down.”
“John, is he going to stay at Baker Street?”
“I would take care of you.”
“You’re a madman! A bloody madman, I tell ya! I’m calling your brother,” he said, going back to dialing his phone.
“Holy crap,” John whispered when he saw a glass box the size of a living room sitting over to the side of the room.
“John, please don’t,” Jim cried, his face full of terror.
The eldest Holmes showed no sign that he had heard what happened, or even cared for that matter. He only took a bite of his eggs and continued reading. “Anthea will be here in a few minutes, John. Now, sit down and eat.”
“John,” Sherlock said, his eyes pleading, “come here and lie across my lap.”
“I’ve got you,” Sherlock said, lowering John slowly to the ground.
“I see you’ve made yourself at home here, Sherlock,” Mycroft ignored his brother’s ‘huff’ and sat down across from him, “that’s good.”
John finds out some very valuable information. Sherlock is a brilliant bastard. Even with one bad arm, Mycroft is still the boss.
“Alright, that’s enough, you bleedin’ idiots,” Greg shouted at the people spewing questions at them. “Can’t you see his Sub is sleeping?”
Shaking his head to clear his mind, John stepped out of the tub, pulling the plug to drain out the cursed water and then wrapped the largest towel he could find around his waist. When he made his way into the room, John froze at the sight of Sherlock sitting on the bed and Mycroft standing next to him with a thick leather collar in his hand. He hadn’t even realized he was backing up until Mycroft commanded him, “come in and kneel before me, John.”
He lifted the man over his shoulder, needed to add more bliss to handle the weight. Sherlock might be skinny, but he was still a good head taller and much more muscular than John gave him credit for. John grunted under the weight, but settled the man on his shoulder.
Sherlock gave John an angry glare, but decided it would be best to huddle up on his sire’s lap, pressing his face into John’s side. “And if you’re good,” John whispered, running his hand gently along Sherlock’s ear, “I’ll help distract you in between feedings. How does that sound?”
“I love you too,” Sherlock repeated, but knew his words fell on deaf ears, as the boy was already asleep. He loved John more than anything in the world, and now they would be together. Forever.
“Thank you,” Mycroft said, picking his fork back up and turned his attention to the paper.
“Sebastian, no, wait,” John tried to get the man’s attention.
John finally let himself cry. Tears welled in his eyes and ran down his face, leaving long wet streaks down his pink cheeks. He felt betrayed, yes, but the fact that he didn’t even know what was going on in his own mind…well, that was enough to make him go mad. What were his thoughts and what were thoughts Sherlock wanted him to think? Was Jim okay? Would Molly and the other Subs be okay? Was everything a lie? And why in the fuck did he still get a warm tingly feeling in his stomach every time Sherlock was around him?
“You hit your head on the rocks when you and Mycroft fell into the water. You went into hypothermic shock as soon as we pulled you out, so I’m sure your memory is a bit fuzzy.” Sherlock placed his hand on John’s arm, squeezing slightly as he looked into the boy’s eyes. “I want to ask you something, John. Do you feel up to it, or would you like to rest up for a while?”
Slowly, he reached out for the phone, looking back towards the bedroom door every other second to make sure no one was coming. Another knock from downstairs and the sound of Sherlock yelling “I’m coming,” forced John to snatch the phone up and cradle it in his hands. The first thing he noticed when he turned it on was there were no missed calls, which surprisingly didn’t hurt as much as he thought it would.  Then, he scrolled down to his mother’s number, staring at it for only a moment until the ninety-five percent of his brain told his finger to hit call. He held the phone to his ear, closing his eyes tightly and praying no one would pick up.
“John! Oh God, John!” Sherlock’s voice was panicked. “What have you done to yourself? Don’t worry, Sherlock’s got you. I’ve always got you, my love.” John felt himself being lifted in the air, his side seizing up, bringing a painful cry from his throat. Soft praises and hushing were being murmured in his ear as he felt a soft surface come up to meet him. The deep voice and tender hands of his
“Too much sanity may be madness — and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!”
“Oh, then, uhh…boyfriend? ‘Cause that’s fine, I mean, it’s all fine.” John said before a shoving a huge bite of beans in his mouth.
“That’s it,” Sherlock said in a long exhale as his hands met at the base of John’s spine. The teenager shivered slightly at the contact, still on edge, prepared for anything and unwilling to relax in case the man above him attempted to use his domination to question him about the other Subs.
“You’ve had your hour and now he’s mine,” John thought he head Sherlock say but it didn’t make any sense, so he assumed it was the disrupted neurons firing in his brain. The voices only halted when John felt the ground leave him and he was floating.
“Oh, I understand just fine. You found some secret way of domming people with RDD and now you expect me to be happy that I can go down into subdrop now and suck your dick for you! Tell me Sherlock, do I look happy?”
He worked his way south, building up his courage enough to kiss the ivory belly as it moved up and down slowly. A moan echoed from the head of the bed, instilling more nerve until he reached a trail of dark hairs leading down to a very hard, very large cock resting on a bed of wiry curls. He hadn’t realized how long he’d been staring at what was about to be in his mouth until a large warm hand settled on the back of his neck, causing him to jump slightly. “It’s alright, it’s not going to bite you,” Sherlock chuckled and that sweet sound brought him back again to the here and now.
However, after the Otolaryngologist told the couple if the infection went untreated it could possible spread and might result in permanent hearing loss, John decided he would be taking his husband’s health into his own hands. “I don’t want them John. Why can’t you just leave me alone? My body would be able to heal itself in no time if it wasn’t being distracted by your constant nagging.” John could tell Sherlock didn’t feel well by the way he was shivering slightly and trying to covertly hold his ear, so he didn’t have to admit out loud that he was hurting. Plus, the detective had always been fussy, as John liked to call it, but now he was downright agitated at the whole world, including his husband.
“He’s fine, hunter,” John said, admirably and frustratingly keeping his cool. Couldn’t John see that Greg wanted him dead? Sherlock couldn’t understand how his sire was so calm when both their lives depended on some stupid love sick human. “Keep an eye on Sherlock’s bonds. I’ll tend to Mycroft.” When Greg didn’t move, Sherlock thought John’s anger would show. Instead, the older vampire kept his voice level, even kind, when he spoke to the human. “Greg, Mycroft is fine…really fine actually. He’s high as a cloud right now from all the drugs Sherlock pumped into him. What I need you to do is make sure the ghost twine isn’t tearing or cutting into Sherlock’s skin too much. Please.”
I hope you enjoy and thanks for reading!
“I know you will,” John smiled up at him, meaning every word he said because he learned a long time ago there was no need to lie to Sherlock, to his lover, who always seemed to understand what he meant even when John himself didn’t know what he was trying to say. Slowly, he stepped down each step, his legs wobbling a bit but they stayed under him until he finally made it to the bottom and into Sherlock’s strong arms.
“A little bit, but…” Jim broke contact with John and lowered his head. He walked back over to the table and sat down, a look of shame on his face.
“No, of course not, well, not yet anyways,” Sherlock nodded, pointing to the filled tub. “But you, John, smell like a rubbish bin so ‘I’ will wash ‘you.’ Take your trousers off and get in to the tub.” It was a strong command, making the Sub’s fingers itch to take of his clothes and get into the tub.
“Are you alright? Was it the soup I made?” The detective laughed, once again successfully using sarcasm to bring John back out of his thoughts to only focus on his feelings.
Once he had his hit, the detective leapt up, pulled on some presentable clothes, and began texting a friend in his homeless network as he walked out of the flat with the note in a bag, John’s shoes, mobile, and longboard.
Mycroft was sitting at the head of the table with a cup of coffee in one hand, while his other stayed nestled in a sling. He was intently reading a newspaper splayed out to the side of his plate. There were three places set, filled with generous portions of sausage, eggs, beans, and a lovely ripe tomato. John’s stomach grumbled at just the sight, but the back of his mind told him something was off about this scene.
The scones were delicious and, to John’s relief, the milk tasted fine too. After five minutes, the plate was void of all crumbs and the milk was gone. John decided it was time to go home so he could think about what happened this weekend without those piercing eyes staring into his soul. Sometimes it seemed like Sherlock was forcing thoughts into his head, or at least making them muddled enough so it was hard to think. “If you can’t drive me home it’s no big deal. I can ride the tube if that would be easier.”
“That is wonderful Johnny! I’m so pleased with you, goodness I need to call Bethany and let her know. I wonder how her boy did, what is his name, Mike?”
“What do they normally say?”
When John started washing himself again, Sherlock could see himself in there with him; standing behind the boy, looming over him to wash the soft blonde hair, rubbing soap into his skin and working his slippery hands down to the small cock, rubbing him slowly to hardness. Instead of wanking his cock, Sherlock was pressing himself up against John’s back, rutting along the crease of his cheeks, making the boy beg for him to enter. “Not yet,” Sherlock whispered to the scene going on in his mind as he sped up his hand on what he saw as John’s hard member. He lowered his hips slightly so his cock pressed on the underside of his boy’s arse and rocked up, splitting the cheeks with his own hardness. John chanted ‘I love you’ over and over again as Sherlock came over the tan back and the boy shot himself on the tile shower wall.
John walked into a white room with a table and two chairs sitting opposite each other, in the center. There was a two way mirror, or at least John assumed it was two way, on one side of the room for the Doms to observe them. Jim was leaning against a back wall, playing with his fingernails. When he looked up to see John, his face lit up like he hadn’t seen the other boy for years.
Ummm yeah, so you remember at the very beginning I said this was going to have a dark ending and then I was all like 'no, no, I can't do that to poor John'...hehe...well, I changed my mind. Due to all the comments about adding a third part to the series and the amazing support I've received for this fic, I've come up with a darker ending, which will allow me to continue on with their story. So really, you guys are to blame for snatching away John's happy ending(:
“Yes?”
“It was the same with the money! John look,” Jim said, holding up a big wad of notes, “this was just sitting on the coffee table. There has to be at least £4,000 here and it was just sitting there, can you believe that!”
“Oh John, you know that only works on weak minds, and I,” he said, standing up straighter, “am brilliant.”
Anyways, thank you guys for waiting so I could get my shit together. I hope you enjoy the new chapter(:
“You’ll what, John? Stab me in the foot with a letter opener? Throw a paper weight at me before I can tell you to drop it and get down on your knees?” John wanted to cry. For the first time since he could remember, tears threatened to escape at this helpless situation.
“John, bloody hell, I love you so much,” the woman’s voice said. Sherlock couldn’t trust his ears and made his way in the shadows to peek through the bedroom door and what he saw caused a great wind to blow through his mind, causing the chandelier to crash to the floor in the great hall, the candles to go out, and the doors in the darkest chasm of his mind to open, letting the darkness stampede through his lobes like wild horses. John, his John, was on top of a blonde woman, sweat dripping down his broader back as his hips moved slowly back in forth. With every kiss he saw John place along the woman’s face, the fourteen year old blonde boy ran through the palace and turned of all the lights until there was nothing left but blackness.
Sherlock walked over to him, eyes assessing every inch of his body with those liquid silver eyes. “Can I trust you, John?” He said, wrapping his large hand around the boy’s nape, pulling him in close so John could feel their breathe passing from one another. “I want to, my sweet boy, but you still get those nasty thoughts in your head, don’t you?” John couldn’t help but look down as if he was a small child being accused of drawing on the walls. “I don’t know what I would do if I lost you again, John. I couldn’t bear it,” he pulled John flush against him, the man’s chest hard and unyielding as he pulled them into a deep demanding kiss.
Then, the most delightful noise came from the small boy sitting beside him. John giggled at the compliment he’d been given, then covered his face in embarrassment, which might have even be cuter than the giggle.
“Go to sleep for me,” the voice reverberated through his bones, caressing his muscles, and wrapping his mind in warm calm water.
Unbeta'd so please forgive any typos :)
“Maybe-maybe later. I’m still a bit tired and sore from this morning,” John said, squeezing his eyes together and telling his cock to back off.
Too weak and tired to put up any more of a fight, John walked over the chair and slumped down to his knees.
“Come, you’ll see, everything will be fine.” Sherlock grabbed his arm and lead him to the front door where Mycroft was waiting, umbrella in hand.
The nurse looked horrified by the Sub’s outburst and went to press the emergency button next to Mycroft’s bed. “That won’t be necessary,” Mycroft said, reaching out with his good arm to catch her hand. “I’ll need my paperwork if I’m to leave today,” he told her, keeping his eyes on John. The deadly glare was just as potent even though the man was obviously not at his best.
“If my brother is spotted by any trackers or hunters, I will not be able to keep him off the League’s list.”
The vampire had rubbed a hole in the sheet from frantically picking at the fibers with his thumb. “You said you’d unchain me,” he said, looking up to glare at Sherlock.
She smiled, taking another bite of her apple as she wrapped a skinny arm around the Dom’s leg.
Hope you enjoy!
John hadn’t even realized he’d said it, to be honest; it was just old hat by now because Baker Street was his home, so why wouldn’t he call it ‘their’ flat. “Yes, well, I guess it wasn’t at the time but now…”
.oOo.
“Then, I will change his mind,” Sherlock said, already knowing what his brother was going to say, “without harming him or Mary. You have my word, for whatever it’s worth. Now, if you don’t mind, I have some catching up to do. Good night, brother.”
“That is what I am about to find out. I’ll keep you on the line,” Mycroft put the phone on mute and ran up the stairs. Though he would never admit it later, his jaw dropped at the sight of Jim Moriarty on the floor, blood pooling below him, and Sherlock cradling a small boy who was in shock.
“Whatever,” John mumbled and rolled over so his back was facing Sherlock.
Greg's POV directly after chapter five.
“John-” Harry said, shaking her head in disbelief.
John could stop his hands from shaking as he took the tray of food, knowing it would not quench his thirst. The constant thumping of Sherlock’s heart was driving the vampire crazy. He could hear Sherlock, smell Sherlock, even feel Sherlock, and now he wanted to taste. He had to taste that rich sweet blood again, he had to.
“They were zombies, John,” Sherlock chimed in behind him.
“Yeah, coming, give me a tick,” John yelled, typing frantically on his mobile.
“Stop talking about me like I’m not here,” John whined, finally able to roll over so he was facing the roof instead of Mycroft’s stomach.
“Hmm, yes, it appears my brother has found a permanent, shall we say, drug to smooth his rougher edges.”
John didn’t say anything. He knew that less was more and if he talked, he might end up saying something he regretted. For some reason though, his mouth opened and words started to come out. “Because of the Subs who stole from the estates,” he said quickly. John’s eye grew wide at his sudden outburst, and then he looked at Sherlock, narrowing his eyes. The man couldn’t have Dommed him without John at least being aware of it…
Hello everyone(: As always I really appreciate all the lovely comments and kudos, you don't know how happy it makes me that so many people are enjoying the story.
“William Sherlock Holmes!” the angry voice shouted. In the blink of an eye, the thin finger was pulled out of him, leaving the small opening cold and empty. Sherlock jumped off and rolled John back over to rest on his back with his cock still hard and a dizziness pooling in his mind.
, that when he was in the shower with Sherlock for the first time he was scared beyond belief. Now, however, now he was still a tad intimidated but also intrigued by the pale body before him. He had felt, tasted, and now was allowed to look, which seemed wrong but
“No,” Sherlock said, standing up and walking over to the other side of the bed. Without another word, the older man lowered the bar on the bed and scooted in, gently lifting John’s good side and slipping underneath him.
“Sherlock, I won’t…I won’t do anything stupid,” John tried to focus but he could feel the heat gathering his belly and his muscles tighten in anticipation of the inevitable. “I just…I just want-“
“Don’t you dare say his name!” Sebastian shouted, gripping John’s chin and holding the gun to his head.
“Ah, Mr. Holmes!” the lady at the front desk called to them, “I didn’t know you bought a Sub. He’s quite the handsome little thing, though he looks a bit feisty, yes?” she asked, nodding her head towards the restraints.
“John,” Sherlock gasped, reaching down for John’s head. He slid his fingers through the vampire’s hair, pulling the strands a bit. John planted a few kisses along Sherlock’s inner thigh, relishing in the heat he could feel emanating from the human’s crotch. With one last kiss, John opened his mouth and took Sherlock’s cock all the way to the back of his throat.
“I’ve have a physical scheduled for John today. Then, if there is time, I’d like to check on a few cases. How’s Sebastian doing, any progress?”
“It’s nothing.”
“What was that all about?”
“When we get home, you are to go shower and then come down to my study for your punishment,” Mycroft said as he stepped out of the car. The man held his arm, which was supported by a sling, close to his chest. He looked exhausted, but his icy blue eyes continued to stare at John, making the Sub want to tuck his chin against his chest.
Following suit, he moved his hand over the panting chest below him, feeling his heart beating a million miles a minute. Still smiling, Sherlock began to lower himself to trap John below his body weight, rocking his hips slightly to give a blissful distraction. “Feels good doesn’t it?” the older man whispered, and if the look on the teens face was anything to go by, yes, yes it did feel good. His John nodded but still refused to make eye contact, which needed to be rectified immediately. “You can trust me, John, I won’t hurt you. Ever.”
Sherlock shifted his weight and passed his modified crossbow from one hand to the other, stretching his stiff fingers. By the time he had gone through every single scenario of how this was going to play out, twice, a noise emanated from the front of the house.
“You know I don’t like it when you hide yourself from me, John,” Sherlock slowly kissed up his good leg, causing his cock to shamefully jerk in an attempt to greet the man kneeling before him. All too soon, the warm lips left him and Sherlock turned off the tap with a satisfied grunt and then shed his clothes before John could even blink. For the second time he gazed upon the older man’s body, this time though it didn’t seem as scary. He would admit,
John wracked his brain until his head hurt, but finally he came up with a Watson approved half-baked plan.
He felt a little better, but the shock of seeing his shoulder in such a state made tears well just on the edge of spilling over. “I was…I was shot,” John finally said, his mind slowly comprehending what had actually happened to him. “Sherlock?!” He cried, looking at Mycroft with wide, pleading eyes. The last thing he remembered seeing was Sherlock reaching out to him and oh God, what if the second shot hit the only person who ever truly loved him.
“Who took you, lad?”
The fourteen year old was so caught up in stroking himself he hadn’t realized his phone buzzed with another text until a second one came.
“I wish I was too, John. Do you know what I’d do to you?”
“I’ll believe that when I see it. You both look like you’re about to collapse on the floor. Here,” Greg said standing up and grabbing Sherlock by the shoulders, “sit down before you hurt yourself.” Sherlock slapped his hand away much like the way John had slapped his when he was toweling off.
“I want to show you something,” the man said, pulling John back to sit next to him.
“Warm. Stay,” Sherlock murmured, still in a sleepy haze. John knew Sherlock had problems sleeping ever since he met him those many years ago. He needed John to be there in order for him to relax and fall off into a deep slumber made for those who hadn’t closed their eyes in three days. It was a burden at first, John remembered, but now he was starting to accept that he held someone’s sanity in his hands. After all, Sherlock held both his heart and sanity in his long pale hands.
Also, make sure to check the notes at the end for some information about my thoughts on what the hell is going on(:
Moving quickly to avoid any protest from his lover, John began licking slowly along the crack, only dipping his tongue in between the cheeks ever so slightly. Sherlock moaned again and, John happily noted, removed his hands from his ears in favor of clutching the sheets. “M-more,” the detective tried to demand but turned into more of a pleading whimper. John took pity on him and gripped the two cheeks, pulling them apart slightly and finally…finally swirled his wet tongue around the needy clenching hole of his husband.
“Unchain me, human,” John tried to sound disgusted when he said it, but Sherlock could hear the longing. Whether the longing was from the blood within a human’s neck or that he wanted to be one, Sherlock didn’t know.
John looked at the clock again, “fuck, almost midnight, sorry footballer I have school in the morning,” yawning he typed his goodbye.
“John, you’re so good,” to John’s relief, Sherlock sounded just as breathless as him when he braced his hands on the sides of the teenagers head and started moving forward and backward. “I want you to give me everything, John, everything,” his thrusts became faster, moving himself on the boy and gazing intently down at him. Every time the teenager tried to lift his hips up to meet his lover’s thrusts as an attempt to reach the man’s prostate, he received a harsh slap, which strangely egged him on even more; until finally, Sherlock placed both his hands over the tan stomach, letting out a harsh grunt and preventing John from moving at all. “No, John,” Sherlock leaned forward, resting his weight on the boy’s chest, wrapping his arms under him, and then stopped moving all together while John was still buried all the way inside.
John weighed his options carefully and quickly, finally deciding to throw the Doctor off and ignore Sherlock’s initial instructions. Slowly, he let his eyes go half-mast as he turned around, offering his back to the Dom in faux-submission. To John’s delight, the man gave a pleased hum and began unlocking the restraints around the boy’s arms and wrists first, then moving to the back of the muzzle. There was a slight tingle to his skin when the leather was removed, taking massive amounts of will power not to scratch or move the newly exposed limbs.
After he finished his homework, John made some canned soup and garlic bread then waited for his mom to get home from work. “Well I’ll be, what’s this for, Johnny?” She smiled as she walked in the door and set her stuff down on the chair.
After he decided John had had enough alone time, Sherlock got up and called him back to where he belonged. “John? John, are you okay in there?”
“You’re gonna be okay. You’re gonna be okay, John. You’re gonna be okay,” Sherlock chanted in his ear until finally, John’s body forced his eyes to close.
“You’re about to perform surgery on my neck, and you want me to create my own bliss?” John asked, wide eyed as he climbed onto the table.
“What’s so funny?!” John shouted at the laughing man. “Even if they did tell me to kill you, which they didn’t, because nobody is talking to me through these contacts, but if they were I could kill you and your stupid brother.”
Hey everyone! Thanks so much for all the support you've given me for this fic. I was actually really surprised by the amount of positive comments and kudos, but I'm very glad you all are enjoying the story.
“Sherlock, please!” John asked, trying to push the bigger hand away so he could speed up the friction and pull the cock ring off. But Sherlock knew just how much to push the teen and as soon as he gave three more hard thrusts, shaking the boy’s body, the detective pulled off the ring and stroked quickly over the engorged cock in his hand. It only took two jerks from his hand and two direct hits to John’s prostate and they both came with a shout. Once again, he filled John up with his seed, letting it soak into the boy’s being. Sherlock wondered briefly, as the warm cavern clenched rhythmically around him, if he could pump John full of enough come to change the boy’s DNA.
“Alright John, would you like to take a break?”
The old vampire, his sire, had a wicked look in his eyes that had turned almost completely black. Thin lines of blue betrayed the fact that John was aroused, not letting his vampire take over. Without preamble, John opened his mouth and took Sherlock’s entire length like it was nothing.
“Now, now,” Mycroft scolded, tugging the boy’s hair slightly, “I was going to command you and make the pain go away but with that kind of language…” John whimpered when something shifted and clicked at the back of his neck.
Jim was the young man’s weakness; it was what brought him to this brink and it was what would push him over the edge. The late psychopath was a cruel sadistic man, and Sherlock understood that, but when his boy was threatened in any way it meant it was time for action.
“But-“
When he finally stopped, his right ankle and the right side of his flank began shooting electricity through his entire body. “Ahhh,” John moaned, feeling warm hands grab his shoulders and rub down his back. He rolled over, not sure if he was trying to get away or get closer to the gentle touch. Black spots started feeling his vision, both from the pain and the dizziness caused from rolling head over heel for what seemed like a hundred times.
John groaned again, louder than before. “Please, hurry,” John continued his whimpers until the car finally pulled over and David opened the back door.
John narrowed his eyes, grinning up at Sherlock, who gave a smug smile in return as his plan fell into place and nodded towards the keyboard to continue the dialogue.
He had to convince the Sub that it was dangerous, to himself and others. Sherlock couldn’t live with himself if John ended up like those Subs they pulled out from the Resistance base.
“What do you mean you lost track of him? How is that even possible?” Sherlock yelled. He put his mobile on speaker and immediately pulled up the satellite screen to ping the tracker in John’s neck. He’d hoped he would never have to use it, but right now he was glad that one night, while John slept soundly, he placed the small device under the boy’s skin.
“We have all been diagnosed with what the Doms have named RDD, but it is so much more than that. It is our ticket to take back control of this one sided world one pompous Dom at a time. And you,” she placed her hand on John’s blanket covered calf, “are key in taking down one of the final trestles holding up the IBAD network.”
John and Sherlock devise a plan to rid themselves of Moriarty.
“Alright,” John said, walking into the bedroom and closing the door. He put his crutch by the bed stand and just as he was about to sit down he heard a slap from the bathroom, followed by someone cursing.
He filled his days with pulling on his restraints, trying to sleep, and waiting for Sherlock to come back and do God knows what to him; and Sherlock gallivanting around, presenting his neck all the time didn’t help either. John wasn’t sure how much longer he would stop himself from grabbing Sherlock and latching on to his neck. Especially when the man came in with some toast and jam and a cup of tea, his veins displayed for John to see every single one of them.
John was still half asleep when they woke him to take a bit of his blood. The nurse seemed nice enough, but it was obvious she was a Dom from all the ‘that’s it’ and ‘good boys’ she cooed to him during the process.
Hey everyone!
Out of the corner of his vision, Sherlock saw John’s eyes double take and then stare up at him in horror. For added effect, he ran his tongue over his lower lip, a gesture he’d made hundreds of times while hovering over John. If he played this right, Archie wouldn’t even know what was going on,
Sherlock took the opportunity to take a seat next to his lover again, pressing up against his body was like lying in front of a calm fire during a winter night. It took every ounce of self-control not to capture John’s lips and take what was his. “Well there are hundreds if not thousands of beers around the world for you to try. That’s what’s cool about trying new things and having as many experiences as you can, yeah? Well, I don’t…that’s what I think at least.” The detective knew there was a fine line between giving advice as an adult to a child and talking about things as friends, so he decided to add a bit of second guessing himself to appear as unsure as the boy sitting across from him.
“After a while I asked him if he wanted to stay with me and he said yes but was worried, just like you, about his parents. So we came up with a plan to make it look like a suicide, that way he could live with me but also offer his parents closure. But then…” Sherlock stopped, lowering his eyes as if the bad memories were almost too much for him to bear. Within seconds, his action was rewarded with the sweet boy entangled with him gripping his hand and squeezing, ensuring his lover it was okay to be sad.
John continued reading about the 15 year old boy named Victor Trevor who Sherlock claimed broke his heart. According to the article though, the police had found a suicide not from Victor…
Sherlock leapt down the stairs, a wide grin on his face, knowing he had timed everything perfectly. John was lying up in their bed on the very cusp of his orgasm, waiting for his lover to return and finish the job. He had already brought the boy so close but then denied him to make his brain need, to make his brain so lust filled he wouldn’t be able to think of anything other than the final pleasure Sherlock had promised. John was now in the perfect state of mind to talk to Mycroft without panicking, like his boy so often liked to do.
“I felt it, it wasn’t strong enough but…but I felt it for the first time. It was so intense, I could literally feel the drugs coursing down to my arms and legs. Honestly, I don’t know how I made it out of there when he told me to stop.” There was a long silence after his confession and John thought everyone had fallen asleep, which was probably the best thing so he could have peace and quiet to figure out how the hell he was going to get Molly back.
“Something like that,” Sherlock said. John could tell the man was looking at him, but the Sub still couldn’t find the courage within himself to look up and make eye contact.
“John…” Sherlock moaned weakly. His strength was leaving him quickly, each limb turning into jelly. “Wha’?” The words became tied around his limp tongue, infuriating Sherlock even more. His mind was his greatest asset and when he couldn’t convey his thoughts with speech…it was enough to drive a man mad. But John, his sire, his beautiful wonderful creator, seemed to understand his panic.
“Yes,” John was proud of himself for stifling any cheek his mind came up with.
In their bed was a completely naked Sherlock, lying on his stomach with his arm stretched out to the side draped over a small pale body that was in a similar position. It was Archie, naked and asleep under Sherlock, who was also asleep in their bed,
“Come on, let’s get some food in you before Lestrade picks us up.” With a heavy hand on his shoulder, John walked down to the kitchen to find Mycroft eating a bagel with butter.
John sat there for a long while, trying to figure out what the hell he was going to do. On one side, he wanted other Subs to be able to create their own bliss, because maybe, just maybe, it would lead to more rights and freedom for them. On the other hand though, John knew how angry Doms would be at finding out Subs didn’t need them anymore. Once again, John was faced with a decision that was much bigger than himself. And once again, he was scared to death.
“John!” someone called his name from the front room. Panicked, he ripped the piece of paper into little pieces and ran out into the foyer. He donned an innocent face when he saw the severity in Mycroft’s eyes. “Come here!”
When John felt his hand slowly squirming its way out of the man’s grasp, he prepared himself for a final attack to the pale jugular above him. He was in mid strike when another command came, “stop,” this time it was a bit louder, but nowhere near a shout, and the tone was more of a growl. John’s hand stopped in the air, only half a second away from piercing skin as dopamine exploded in his body, making his arm pliant and unwilling to harm the Dom above him.
“I know you can,” Sherlock said, his mouth right next to John’s ear, “but that won’t stop me.”
Sherlock opened his mouth, displaying his fangs, and then bit into Greg’s leg.
“I think so,” John giggled and, to Sherlock’s approval, scooted back further into the man’s embrace, even though his arse probably hurt as he was still impaled. Quickly, Sherlock reached over behind him and pulled out a small blue anal plug that would keep his come inside John for the rest of the day…or at least until he needed another hit. He slowly pulled out, eliciting a small pained whine from the boy, watching as a line of precious seed created a tether between him and his lover. The small pearly white come linked them together, ensuring Sherlock’s mark would always be inside his John. He parted the reddened cheeks and easily worked in the plug, which was much smaller than Sherlock’s cock.
The detective realized that John meant every word he said, there was no ulterior motive, no anger, no seductive tone, just John blaming himself for things that were too dark for him to even see.
For a moment, John thought about telling the two Doms about his nightmare.
“What?” John asked, preparing for the worst.
“What happened?” John asked, as Sherlock ran his hand through the boy’s hair gently.
“Sebastian, why don’t we skip all the ode to Moriarty games and-”
“He must be so lonely,” John mumbled to himself, quiet enough that the driver didn’t acknowledge him. He knew what that little boy was feeling, how alone, how scared, how desperate he must be to find any bit of light in a world void of sun. John had found his hope those many years ago; a light so bright it continued to consume him to this day. Was it worth it? Was the only question that really mattered now, or at least it was the only question that could give him peace.
Sherlock just waved him off, turning around to smile at John. The vampire was tired, his body obviously needing blood to rejuvenate its self.
“Yes, he’s untouched, as per your requirements.” John’s eyes grew wide at that, realizing he had made a huge mistake. Sherlock had hoped it would calm him a bit, but instead, John grew even more ferocious at that thought of being tricked. “Stop it,” Sherlock snapped at him.
“Piss off,” Sherlock deadpanned, bringing a laugh from John because yes, he could see the Dom getting punched in the face after displaying that kind of observation. As John laughed though, in the back of his mind was that one nagging piece of information that told him Sherlock knew where Harry was and he was going to tell Greg exactly where to find them.
Mycroft tugged the lead once more, motioning for John to stand up, but the Sub only turned his head slightly to look in the other direction. John knew it was a token rebellion, but when you’re sitting on the floor with a muzzle, arm restraints, and a lead, it was worth it to torment the Dom. “Up,” he said, his voice stern but not commanding. Five seconds later, John was shaking on the ground again, the pain hitting every muscle in his body before it stopped at his feet.
“John, he does love you, I’m not saying that because honestly, I’ve never seen act like the way he acts around you,” a small smile came to John’s face. “However, I am saying that he hurt you-“
“Alright, Sherlock, alright. Just relax for me. These doctors are going to take care of you while I step out, okay?”
The door flew open before John could even think of a good excuse. “What is going on in here?” Mycroft boomed, taking two large steps into the room and gaping at John, who in turn was gaping at his own hand. “John, kneel!” The elder Holmes ordered, pushing his dominance across the room, hitting John like a lead weight.
Chapter 3 – Sweat it Out
It was obvious by the look on the man’s face that he felt sorry for John. Even though Greg was trained to kill vampires, he couldn’t help but feel some compassion for the creature on the bed. Sherlock did too, of course, he wasn’t a monster. It was his curiosity though, that trumped all, and John was just too much of an anomaly to let go.
“I’m not scared! I just don’t like having things in my ears!”
Greg swallowed hard again. Usually, he could handle threats, he worked in security and law enforcement after all, but Mycroft Holmes…well, he knew how to threaten alright. “I understand,” Greg said, because he did understand, but that didn’t mean he was going to obey.
‘WAKE UP, JOHN’ the green writing read. ‘FOCUS.’ John didn’t know why they were telling him to get out of such an amazingly calm state. ‘I KNOW IT FEELS GOOD, BUT YOU NEED TO FOCUS. WAKE UP.’ John groaned and dug his face deeper into Sherlock’s chest when he felt the cold winter air hit him.
“I’ll protect Sherlock,” Greg said just as John was about to close the door to the bedroom. “I’ll…They won’t hurt him, not if I have anything to say about it.” The human’s words were true, naive, but true.
“I am very proud! Now take me to him, Mycroft, or so help me…wait, a flat mate?” There was something in his brother’s tone, something indicating not just a flat mate.
“John is different,” Sherlock sat down on the chair across from the other man, bracing his fingers under his chin, gazing into the dark eyes. The detective forced his mind to focus on the here and now, with John waiting for him upstairs and not the mistakes he’d made in his past. He was only a child then, now he knew what he wanted and he wanted John, all of John.
“How long have you known?” John asked, ashamed that he had failed,
“Does it hurt a lot?”
Without hesitation, John grabbed the laptop away from Sherlock and leaned back, setting it on his lap so they both could see what he was typing.
“It is the hormones from the ventilation system, Sherlock, you know that,” Mycroft said, readjusting the straps to secure them properly.
Hope you enjoy this chapter. It is un-betad, so please forgive any mistakes.
Chapter 3 – All You Ever Wanted
“You be quiet, vampire,” Greg said, pointing at the beast on the bed.
Sherlock had observed John for the past month, gauged his reactions, and watched how the intent behind his eyes had changed in order to calculate exactly when the final break took place. One large chunk had fallen off when they made love for the first time in the shower and little cracks appeared every time he entered the boy after that. Then, another when he tried to call his mother and of course there was no answer. Sherlock had been afraid this event had left a hole instead of only a crack but when John had pointed the gun at him, crying helplessly on the floor, he knew their love was the only glue that would be strong enough to put him back together.
“Compromised?” John asked, trying to sit up and glare at the man, but was held down by Sherlock. “I did perfectly fine saving your arses from a burning building, didn’t I?”
“I can make my own choices!” John shouted, his throat burning. “You shouldn’t get to decide what happens for me and the rest of the Subs.”
“Who are you people? Why did you do this?” John asked, knowing that there were at least two other people in the back of the van.
Sherlock stared at him, his brow knitting as if he was working out a math problem. He held a soapy flannel in his hand, but he remained a complete statue.
“Sherlock, stop,” John groaned out, undoubtedly still sore and tired from their midnight festivities.
Sherlock grinned, shoving his hands in his pockets and twirling around dramatically to face the stairs. “In our bedroom, come. Now be nice Mycroft and don’t startle him. John is still in a fragile state from our visitor earlier today,”
“I’m not a child, Sherlock,” John said, looking up at those two silver eyes and that pale skin that appeared to be flawless. His eyes began to wander down to Sherlock’s lips, watching how the man’s tongue darted out to wet them. When his mind was focused on nothing but Sherlock, he forgot about other parts of his body. John had to twist and turn, closing his eyes to make his sure his lower regions didn’t come up to greet Mycroft.
“That’s where you’re wrong. You have no idea what would happen if you decided to give in to your instinct. Don’t you want to know, John? Don’t you want to just try it? To just give in?”
“Feisty little thing, aren’t ya?” Moran said, giving John a wide grin. “In a nut shell, I’m going to save you and kill Sherlock.”
“Mycroft called. He wanted to discuss security for the conference,” Greg said, allowing Anthea to walk past him. With Molly in tow, Greg barged past Sherlock and smiled at John. “Feeling better, lad?”
“I think so…ohhhhh,” just like that, understanding dawned on the Doctor and he had to force himself not to laugh. “You mean the part where he puts those worms in their ears to make them talk?”
“Jim, no, I just want to help,” John shouted back to him, trying to take a step towards him, but was held back by a steel arm from Mycroft.
By the time they were ten minutes away from Baker Street, John was so excited to be in London it appeared he had completely forgotten who he was sitting in the car with. Sherlock knew he was good but John’s trusting nature surprised even him. He had worked three weeks for this moment and the look in his boy’s eyes, the trust, the love he felt beaming off of John was enough to make his frantic mind melt into jelly. Knowing that John did not get out of the car as soon as he saw the man who he’d come to know, was the closest thing to Heaven Sherlock could ever imagine.
As John walked down the hallway, he thought about how good it was to be a Sub sometimes. Nobody ever thought he was up to anything maniacal.
Molly nodded and held out the bar for John to take some. “He said it was for being such a brave girl when you hurt your neck. He came over ‘cause Greg was so worried, but it’s okay to be worried. That’s what My said.”
Sherlock put the computer on John’s lap, gave a quick kiss to the top of his head and then left for the kitchen. John turned it on, staring at the screen and trying to remember why he wanted to use the laptop so badly a couple of weeks ago. He shrugged, hoping the thought would come to him if he played a few card games and cruised the internet for a while. After about thirty minutes or so, he still didn’t remember and put it out of his mind because it couldn’t have been that important if the memory didn’t come.
“Thank you,” John lifted a hand up and waved it towards Greg to show his agreement.
John narrowed his eyes. He knew, or at least hoped, Sherlock didn’t have a controller for his collar, which meant there was no way he could be forced to do anything.
“If what I’ve been told is correct, then all the Subs are just children. Then if this is true, I can personally guarantee that they will all go to good homes with Doms who are pro research for Subs suffering from RDD. All-“
Sherlock’s voice rang in his head, recalling how proud he’d made the man and calming him slightly.
“I would love that John,” the deep voice sounded pleased.
‘The angel of Baker Street,’ that’s what Sherlock had called him,
Grabbing his crutch, John headed out of the room, opening the door slowly in case there was a problem outside. He sighed with relief when he heard the shout again and located where it was coming from.
“Mycroft’s men took him back to the hospital. He won’t remember a thing, not even those lovely sounds you made last night, John.” Sherlock’s smirk grew wider as he placed his hands under his head and stretched out completely naked on the floor. It was obvious how unashamed the detective was of his dried-come covered chest or his bit, which not so surprisingly, were half erect.
“Greg said we get to go on vacation after this, well, not a traveling vacation, but he said we can just sit, watch the telly, and eat ice cream all day if we want to.” The smile on Jim’s face lit up the room, making John’s heart ache a bit from being too happy.
Two men had barged into the room, only allowing John a small but deep cut in his inner thigh before they removed the knife from his hand and pinned him to the bed. Mycroft had waited with John as a private doctor patched him up, which only required one embarrassing plaster. The two brothers had a long conversation outside the door as John sat staring at the ceiling, picturing himself lying in a pool of blood and his eyes closing peacefully.
She assumed he was dead without question, abandoned her son to a fate unknown. The goodness he felt when he’d woken up was gone, replaced with cold emptiness, deeper and darker than any chasm known to man.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sherlock, wait, I-I don’t think I want to do this yet,” John cried out like Sherlock knew he would eventually, the realization of how completely owned he was, spilling over in a frightening mess. He was just a boy, though; he wouldn’t hold it against him for being afraid of the unknown. Soon, he would learn to trust in his lover, who would do what was best for him, but for now, Sherlock would just have to prove it to him.
“I rented the place at the other end of Baker Street, 221 I believe. It’s not as extravagant, but it will do until our estate is rebuilt. Here, I had Anthea buy you some more clothes, as all of yours are smoke stained.”
After the sigh, he made his move, adding slight pressure on the boys cheek so he couldn’t pull away from the man’s lips. Sherlock started slowly, coaxing the teen into the act with soft gently touches, until he heard another moan and began deepening the possession he had over John’s lips. Giving a few licks to the small puckered lips, as a request for entrance, Sherlock almost tackled the boy right then when he opened so beautifully without hesitation.
John thought to himself, grabbing a loaf of bread and throwing it into the basket. All Sherlock wanted was John…
“How?” Was all John could think to ask, confused and still hurting from the older brother’s sadistic tendencies.
Greg slowly walked closer, the smell becoming stronger and exciting Sherlock even more. The vampire hissed and strained his neck towards the human.
John had become quite skillful at giving head, but Sherlock’s cock was larger than average, making it difficult for him to take it all the way into his throat. This, however, did not stop Sherlock from trying every time. It started off slow, John using his hand to stroke as he sucked on the head. Until finally, Sherlock grabbed the short blonde hairs on John’s head and started to buck into his mouth harshly. “That’s it, John. Take me,” he growled down at him, his face flush as he neared completion.
“It was an old friend, not a very nice friend, but a friend nonetheless. What happened John, did something scare you?” Sherlock moved slowly as to not startle the panicked animal at his feet and placed the plate and glass on the floor.
John actually smiled, unable to fight the muscles at the corners of his mouth. He was going to be with Sherlock, and Sherlock was going to be with him, forever.
“What? Why not now?” John asked, defensive. He could handle what anyone could throw at him, his actions at Baker Street proved that.
John's tired and angry. Molly and Sherlock are just too damn cute together. Mycroft is still scheming.
Although the thought of John hurting himself sent out painful barbs in his heart and mind, Sherlock knew it was for the best. Plus, it was the teenager’s fault. “If you would have just listened to me like you were supposed to, then none of this would have happened, hmm?” He chided the sleeping boy, poking him playfully on his little button nose. The moment replayed in his mind over and over, running through the brand new scenario he had come up with in the ten seconds John tried to run away from their home. “If you won’t let me take care of you,” he whispered fondly into his stubborn boy’s ear, “then I’ll just have to make you.”
“I suppose that makes sense,” Sherlock replied, pulling out a roll of gauze to wrap around John’s hand. “You didn’t break anything, that’s good.”
After a few ghosting touches, Sherlock deepened the kiss, giving the smaller closed lips a few licks with his tongue. Only confused on what to do for a second, John realized he was supposed to open his mouth and do the same things the more experienced man was doing to him. He parted his lips and before he could reciprocate, Sherlock’s larger tongue eased into his mouth, grazing under his tongue and up to the roof of his mouth. It didn’t just feel nice, John decided, it felt wonderful to have the man kissing him so sweetly and the soft moans coming from the other mouth were gorgeous.
His words seemed to lack what the man needed to hear as Greg stepped around the bed and kneeled down beside John’s bed. He grabbed John’s good had and clasped it between his own. “John,” Greg said, his voice dangerously sincere, “I can’t possibly imagine what you’ve been through these past five years. What I do know is that you are a very, very good person, and you deserve to be treated with love, dignity, and-”
“Sherlock Holmes,” he bowed slightly, watching John’s every move. He could see when the light bulb went off in his head.
“Don’t lie to him! That’s all you people know how to do, isn’t it?” he leveled the gun back on Sherlock. “That’s your next question. Get it right, and I’ll untie one more knot from John. Get it wrong and your dead where you stand.”
Finally, after they would eat dinner and argue relentlessly over crap television they were watching, as John rested peacefully on Sherlock’s lap, the man would carry him upstairs for bed. Sherlock would remove the plug with the same pleased gasp every time and would gently make love to him, spooning the smaller boy. Unlike their morning sex, which was unpredictable, the evening love making was always slow and sweet as if Sherlock was sated and calmed by the day they’d spent together.
Now though, John didn’t know what to say in response. He stared up at the ceiling too, hoping he would find the words like Sherlock had done. “Erm…it’s okay.”
“You kidnapped me,” John began squirming lightly against the arms holding him.
His younger brother could be heard running down the stairs and then slowed suddenly as to not give away his excitement. It had always been and always would be like that between them; Sherlock viewing Mycroft as his arch nemesis, playing their conversations like a chess game, but in the end he knew he could always come to his big brother when he was in real trouble and that was all that mattered. Simply put, they weren’t the hugging type and Sherlock threw up countless amounts of walls every time Mycroft came around. Although, it usually didn’t help because to Mycroft, the boy he grew up with was an open book. Right now, Mycroft saw unimaginable content and serenity in his young brother’s features and eyes, even when Sherlock tried to hide it.
John hadn’t even realized he was trembling. Even when he tried to stop, his body seemed to shake even harder. His eyes darted around for an escape, only to find none. John had heard of miracles but in all his sixteen years had never experienced one until a knock at the door saved him from the approaching man. However, it appeared he would have to wait for another saving grace when the voice at the door shouted, “IBAD patrol.”
The next thing John knew, there were hand on his arms, forcing them to his side, and restraining them there by a giant bear hug. “Shhh, calm down,” Sherlock whispered into his ear. “You’re alright, you’re alright.” The Dom sat down in the chair and pulled John into sit sideways in his lap so the boy’s side was tucked against Sherlock’s chest and his feet hung over the man’s thighs.
Sherlock chuckled to himself, not really understanding his reaction until something clicked in his mind. His John was weak, weaker than he though at least, but it was just too much for his boy to be alone that long. Sherlock understood though, John didn’t really love this…this woman, it was only a hand to hold and perhaps a soft chaste kiss to the cheek that his love needed. That was okay, it was only proof of how lonely John was, to fall so much that he decided to live with the coffee girl. “I see, well, thank you for the ride,” Sherlock nodded to his brother and tried to step out of the car as it pulled in front of 221.
Greg held his hand up, shutting John up before he continued. “Even if you don’t, I’m sure you will be able to find them. After all, they are looking for you,” the DI held up the letter Jim had left, telling whoever read it to give John back. “So, Mycroft will take your collar off, the right way I might add, and then you will be released to rejoin your friends.”
“What does? I didn’t even touch your nipples last night and your cock seems to be enjoying itself.” Sherlock mumbled, moving his head lower, biting the soft sensitive skin over his ribs and belly.
John didn’t hear the last part when he saw a thin pair of gray cotton shorts and a black shirt lying on the bed.
This chapter is un-beta'd, so please forgive the mistakes. Enjoy!
“You should stay on the couch and rest, John. I have some experiments that need attending to,” Sherlock said, patting John on the head, then leaving the room.
“W-what are you doing?” Sherlock had peeked out from over the pillow he had tried to envelope his head in.
“Good for them,” Sherlock rolled his eyes and crossed his leg over the other.
“Good, now get some rest and we’ll talk some more tomorrow.” Mycroft squeezed John’s leg gently. “Thank you for trusting me,” he said as John’s eyes fluttered closed.
Mycroft set down the tray of food on John’s lap, then grabbed his brother’s good arm, hauling him up. “Come, I’ll take you back,” Mycroft said, holding onto his brother’s arm, as if the younger was about to run away.
The searing hand grabbed onto his neck and-BANG!
Sherlock laughed, deep and hearty at John’s statement. “Oh John,” he said as if he was talking to an adorable little kid. “What makes you think we are playing a game here?” Finally, there was a finger pressing at his entrance, just teasing the rim, but breaching every couple of passes. “I want you, and I’m going to have you whether you like it or not.”
“You don’t need that thing to help you feel, sweetie,” Irene told the panicking boy.
I wish you all well and I've read every single comment tonight. So thank you to everyone.
“Yes, one of us is going to feed you, John,” Mycroft said, sitting back down and scooting his chair closer to the table. “Make your decision now. Then, crawl over, kneel, and wait for one of your Masters to feed you. You have ten seconds to choose. Ten.”
He raised his glass to show his appreciation and then got down to business. “No, no it is nothing like that.”
“You keep saying that,” John laughed trying to disrupt the intense feelings boiling inside him.
John huffed, trying to be annoyed at another bloke telling him to go to bed but he was really just disappointed that he wouldn't get to talk to Sherlock anymore until tomorrow.
“I just…I need a break,” both men sighed, one in defeat while the other was content at a solid but unsatisfying victory.
“Be that as it may, I’m going to watch the telly and, if convenient, I would like you to join me.” With that, Sherlock turned on his heel and walked out of the room, calling over his shoulder, “if inconvenient, come anyway.”
Sherlock looked up from his phone, giving John an appraising look. It felt like he was opening John’s brain up and peering inside, finding all his deepest and darkest secrets. “Hmm,” was all he said, before going back to focusing on his phone.
John raised his eyebrow at the threat.
Chapter 5 – Liquid State
“You’re…um, you’re taking me away from Sherlock?” John asked, blinking rapidly to keep the tears at bay as the words left his mouth.
“Yum!” She licked her lips, because yes, macaroni and cheese did sound delicious. Molly ran up the stairs and into the bathroom. There was a stool set up just for her, so she could brush her teeth and wash her hands without Greg’s help. Not that he minded of course, as he always tucked the little girl in at night without fail.
Sherlock normally groaned when he woke up in the morning, taking at least an hour to get out of bed, but today was different, much different. The detective had put away all the pictures he kept of John, dressed in a button up striped shirt, leaving it untucked to appear younger, pulled on some dark faded jeans, combed his hair, and even brushed his teeth, all before John even got into the shower on the camera.
“It’s an emergency. I need your help,” Sherlock told him, making his voice sound panicked. He knew Greg would never be able to live with himself if he let a friend deal with an emergency alone. So, playing to the other hunter’s weakness, Sherlock played to his strengths, and lied.
“I will leave,” John’s eyes grew wide before he even finished his sentence, “John, it’s okay, I will leave because I’m sure he has eyes on Baker Street. Then, when I see him enter I will…take care of him before he even gets to you,” it was best for John to think he was going to turn Jim over to the police, even though he would do nothing of the sort. “He is not going to knock, John listen to me, focus,” he gripped the trembling boy by the shoulders. “I need you to be a strong boy for me, okay? I won’t let him take you, I promise. He is going to come in and I want you to wait for him up in our room. Whatever you hear downstairs you will not leave that room, do you understand me?”
“Fourteen,” he answered, scooting himself away to lean on the door.
“Why not?! You can’t stop me from creating my own bliss,” John snapped, his anger fueled by not only the resurfacing pain in his foot, but the fact that Sherlock would have the gall to tell him he couldn’t use bliss.
When the man bent down to pick up the wallet, John grabbed the open door and swung it, knocking the man in the head. It was dangerous, and a bit violent for John’s taste, but he had to save Sherlock. He made sure not to swing too hard, but the man lying on the ground told John he had hit him hard enough. “I can’t believe that worked,” John whispered as he leaned down to check the man’s pulse. The thumping in the man’s neck was strong and regular. “Thank God. Sorry, mate,” John said, patting the man’s head.
Suddenly, he was met with his frantic looking mother running towards him and John took a step back but ran into Greg, who held him by the shoulders so his mom could pick him up into a huge hug. “Oh John, I was so worried about you!” She put him down and held him by the shoulders, “do you have any idea what you put me through?”
Hey everyone, I had a bit of trouble with this chapter, so I'm sorry if it isn't as elaborate as it should be.
That was a strange answer that made the teenager take pause, but it was as if his mind wasn’t communicating to his body and he had no idea why Sherlock’s last sentence scared him so much. “Okay,” he whispered, keeping his head down and following the man down stairs into the kitchen.
“Because we were starving,” John countered, thinking that he had won their little argument. He cupped his hands again and started washing off the soap. “Keep your eyes closed,” he warned, watching the suds roll down Sherlock’s face.
“I know, but Sherlock will make it all better. I promise,” the man smiled as he finished washing off the boy, paying extra care over his arse, cock, and bullocks. “All done, let’s get you dried off, yeah?” Sherlock did as he said, holding John tight to his side, while the boy held onto his torso for dear life, until he dried him off and picked him up bridal style.
“Good, let’s go sit over by Greg, then.” John kept both hands on Sherlock the whole time as they made their way over to the couch. When Sherlock was sitting right next to the human, he thought he was going to lose it. The pull to drink from the bright red lines flowing through the man’s body was so strong; Sherlock didn’t know how John was so calm.
“What’s so funny?” John’s voice dropped an octave, clearly angry at being laughed at. He gave Sherlock a little shake, but still didn’t squeeze any harder to cut of his air supply completely.
“I love you too,” John whispered without hesitation, bringing Sherlock to hug him closer. However, the water was starting to turn colder and his fingers where becoming prunes, so the detective decided it was time for bed. He pulled out gently, resulting in an “Ah,” from John at the loss and empty feeling he was surely experiencing.
“Umm,” Greg said, his voice shaky as he watched Sherlock’s eyes turn black again and his fangs drop to shine in the soft glow of the florescent lights.
“I was hungry,” she said rubbing the sleep away from her eyes.
“Thanks,” John said, grabbing the clothes. Thankfully, Mycroft did not have his brother’s trait of being a nosy perv, and left the room for John to change. It was difficult, bouncing around on his good foot to be able to put on soft cotton pants and black trousers. He balanced himself on a crutch as he pulled on a long sleeve green shirt.
Hey everyone!
John watched as a familiar man and woman walked up behind the reporter. His heart stopped in his chest and his whole body went numb. Any safety that his Doms had provided was just an illusion, and now, with two words, John’s world crumbled. “Mom? Dad?”
John’s whole body ached when he finally stirred from his long sleep. It only took a moment for clarity to set in, when he realized the bed he was lying on was not his. Sherlock had kidnapped him and drugged him so John couldn’t go back home.
John dropped the sheet, letting it fall to the floor, then helped Sherlock with his. As soon as the young vampire was visible and his nose caught whiff of the two humans, who just so happened to have blood flowing through them, he growled. John not only saw, but sensed Sherlock’s teeth drop and his eyes darken.
This chapter is very dark and has some violence and creepy psychological manifestations...you'll see what I mean, but it is quite disturbing so prepare yourselves(:
“Oh Jesus, no, no I would never do that Sherlock, you can trust me.”
Sooo, you remember back in the very beginning when I said this wasn't going to have a happy ending? Well, I think my hopeless romantic is showing a bit because, although their are going to be a few more psychologically traumatic and dark moments, the ending is not going to be as dark as I originally planned. I think I've become a bit too invested and I just can't do that to poor John. So I do apologize to those of you who were hoping for a darker ending though because that really was my intention when I first started the series.
“And how are you going to do that, hmm? Blow up more buildings and kill more innocent people?” John had completely forgotten about his neck, causing an aching pain to linger around the spot where the doctors had removed his collar. The young Sub was furious, at Irene, and at himself for believing the Sub Resistance was able to save Subs.
Chapter 1 – Burden in My Hand
“You’re alright, you’re alright. We’re out of the sun,” John said, pulling off their sheets and settling Sherlock by his side. It was a large car with wide seats facing each other, and tinted windows. Mycroft and Greg sat on one side, while Sherlock and John sat huddled on the other. “Greg,” John demanded, holding out his hand.
“Alright, let’s get you dried off and put back on our bed and I’ll bring you up some more of those scones.”
Without thinking, John pulled his clothes down and stepped into the most delectable water he’d ever felt. He sank down, letting the curved porcelain support his body and the lip of the tub hold his head as the water soothed away all the aches and pains from sleeping in the pipes, which he had no other choice but to ignore at the time. A long exhale escaped from his lips and then he was lost in his own world until there was a soft but abrasive flannel rubbing along his shoulders. John jumped slightly, his nerves already fried, as was his brain from dealing with these two Doms. It wouldn’t hurt to let the man wash him, John decided, as long as he didn’t try any funny business.
“You mean how I almost bled out because a Doctor at your facility ripped a collar out of my spine?” John asked, his voice as spiteful as his tired body would allow. This actually earned a snort from Sherlock, though the other brother didn’t seem to think his little outburst was amusing.
Greg nodded from his position on the couch and Mycroft just continued to stare intently at his brother’s unconscious form. John could feel sympathy, of course he could; he wasn’t a monster after all. Harry would have been the same way if his sire hadn’t killed her and his parents while they slept. They did exactly what Mycroft was doing now, trying to look after his brother. It was confusing though, to John, he couldn’t decide if what his sire did was a mercy and what he was doing was cruel.
Standing awkwardly next to Sherlock’s lap, John bent over to press his stomach on the man’s lap. As if knowing exactly what to do, Sherlock grabbed the Sub’s hip and lifted him slightly to reposition him and make sure John’s bum was sticking in the air.
It took thirty minutes for Sherlock to finally retract his teeth and stop struggling against John’s hold. Greg looked exhausted and terrified, but finally relieved that he didn’t have a vampire lunging at his neck with the only thing protecting him being another vampire. John sighed, but still held on to his vampire.
The woman screamed when she saw Sherlock’s teeth had dropped and his eyes had turned black. She ran out of the room, knocking another tray over as she went. “John,” Sherlock gasped, clutching at his heart that no longer beat. He needed to find John, but first, he needed to eat before he collapsed.
“Just what?” Sherlock asked.
“Hmm,” the little girl pondered, staring at John just as Sherlock had done, though her gaze was much less scary. “He looks sad,” she finally said, looking back at Sherlock.
“Well, thanks but mum says I’m too young still. Like, kids make stupid decisions already and don’t need beer to help ‘em out, or something like that.” When the words escaped his lips, the boy felt a giant weight fall onto his shoulders. “I-I should probably-“
The boy shook his head quickly, still shaking from Irene’s earlier words. “Now take him home,” John said, sounding years older than he actually was.
“So you’ll let me keep him?” Sherlock asked, as if John were a stray puppy he’d found on the street.
“The collar?”
“At least unlock me during the day. Where am I going to go?”
I hope you all enjoy!!
“Sherlock, you’re scaring me,” John was really getting the hang of this honesty thing and was thankful for it as well. Hell, if he had to deal with a psychopath it was nice to not have to deal with it alone. “What does he want with you?”
“Have you been to the kennels?”
“Umm, yeah,” John nodded in agreement. His school work was the only connection to the outside world really, at least until Sherlock decided to trust him enough to take him outside. Hell, the Detective still checked over his homework, discreetly of course, to make sure he wasn’t sending secret messages. John had never tried though, was too scared of other people getting involved in this…whatever it was. If he reached out to anyone, he knew they would share Mary’s fate. “I’m almost done though.”
“Oh, you poor dear,” she said.
“I’m not going to wash you, if that’s what you want!” John said, raising his chin slightly in defiance. The teen readied himself to fight off any kind of command that would surly come. Instead, the man only smiled at him and John decided he really hated that fucking smug grin.
“Sorry,” he apologized when he saw chocolate milk had pooled on the floor.
“But you-“John started to say but was cut off when Sherlock went in for a deep kiss, biting slightly at the smaller bottom lip.
Sherlock had held John tightly to his chest, stoking over the freshly applied gauze as the boy slept. With his mind calm, Sherlock dove down into his palace and went over the information he’d retrieved about the three children.
“You will be the most magnificent doctor in the whole world John, I know it,” Sherlock encouraged, glaring at his brother to do the same.
The woman’s face hadn’t changed since she sat down in her chair. She simply smiled at John with condescension, but there was something much more dangerous in her eyes. Leaning forward, she placed her hands flat on the desk. “John, there is much you don’t understand-”
“Aww, it’s okay,” Sherlock ran a soothing hand over the shorter man’s back, “do you want me to hurry up and get to the main event?” Sherlock had only worked two fingers into John’s tight hole, but he pulled them out with a squelching pop and wiped them on a towel.
Drawing John out was easy because the teen was…well, a teenager who was already self-conscious about himself and sympathized with others who felt the same. He knew John would send a picture without Sherlock having to even ask.
When the realization hit him like a ton of bricks, John paled and hung up the phone with a loud bang. When the secretary looked at him curiously, he smiled and said, “wrong number. Actually, my mom texted me and said she just pulled up. Thanks for letting me use your phone.”
“Well, you are going to put a stop to it this time aren't you? I mean, look at what happened to Victor, the kid is still messed up.”
John's POV directly after chapter eight.
“I was able to create my own bliss, so I wasn’t scared or-” John was cut off again by the tense man.
“Well I do John. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I wish I could show you how much you are cherished, then you would know, then you would understand.”
John’s face scrunched up as tears started to prick his eyes. It all made since now; why Sherlock was so nice to him, why Mycroft disciplined him, why…why he felt such strong feelings about Sherlock. The past couple of days had not only been a whirlwind, they had also been one giant lie. “What…what now?”
“Really, oh do tell Sherlock, do tell, because quite honestly,” Jim put his palm to the side of his mouth, acting like he was telling the detective a secret he didn’t want the walls to hear, “on paper they both look identical.”
“You mean I can come with you?” John asked, cursing himself for sounding too eager. He had no idea what he would do if he was aloud outside, around other people, normal people, sane people.
As soon as he set foot in the bathroom and realized the next step was to take his clothes off, John began to panic.
John smiled to himself for a moment, thinking about how far Sherlock had gone to keep him at Baker Street. To have someone that cared that much about him was amazing…
“You are special John, you’re everything, my everything, you are nothing like Victor” he reassured the boy, sitting down next to him and tugging him closer with an arm around his shoulders.
“Greg?” Sherlock asked, shocked and a little confused as to why John had the man’s number in his phone.
“Just hear him out, John,” Sherlock told him, rubbing the teenager’s back up and down lightly. John nodded a few times for Greg to continue.
John took a deep breath, filling his lungs with Sherlock’s scent and easily pulling up his darkness. His teeth came out involuntarily, drool pooling at the side of his mouth. Blackness took over his eyes, causing Sherlock to gasp in awe. He placed the bright light in front of John’s new eyes and the vampire hissed loudly, pushing the torch away.
He took a deep breath, made sure the towel covered up his bits, and then walked out into the room with an air of nonchalance.
Sherlock felt the same way about the teenager. He loved him more than he’d ever loved anything in this world, which meant he was responsible for keeping that precious stubborn boy safe. It would be difficult, but Sherlock knew, with his brother’s help (even though he would never admit it) they could protect John from problems outside.
“Saved me?!” John asked without thinking, earning a deadly glare from Mycroft and a tightening hand on his lower neck.
“Sherlock!” Mycroft growled when they reached the top of the steps. The man was talking with two other Doms, both Doctors, as Sherlock and John approached.
“So show me,” Sherlock smiled lazily. It was obvious Sherlock was still high, but to John it was a positive, as it kept his prey lethargic and unable to get away. The scenario was perfect, and John was ready to take what was his.
“Here we are,” the man said, all too soon. With shaky legs, John exited the car and looked around to see the Thames on one side and buildings with Sub occupants on the roof on the other side of the street. Suddenly, John’s stomach grew heavy and his throat clenched tightly, bringing a bright red hue to his face. He ran over to a rubbish bin just by the edge of the water and threw up the eggs, bacon, and toast Sherlock had fed him just before he left. His stomach felt better, but his heart still felt like a pulsating rock in his chest.
He quickly threw his head back, avoiding the awkward bulky object and grabbed it in one hand and John’s wrist in the other. “John, you need to calm down,” Sherlock snapped but let the boy’s hand go when it was yanked back. Blue eyes stared up at him even as they became flooded with unshed tears. Anger was expected, obviously a result of being lied to, but there was no anger in those young eyes, only sorrow and betrayal…and fear.
John and the rest of the runaways go back to save Molly. All does not go as planned...for John at least.
“I said leave!” he growled, gripping a hold of Mycroft’s shirt and shaking him slightly.
“I, umm, I need to go to the bathroom,” John said nonchalantly, heading in that general direction. He thought he was scot-free when Sherlock had to ruin everything.
“Back off, back off!” one of the hunters shouted from outside. “Anderson, bring in the proxy.”
The rest of the day was a blur and to be completely honest it scared John half to death, he’d never felt this way before in his whole young life. He had heard his mother talk about something called infatuation and it was obviously different from real love when she described it, but now he couldn’t tell.
“When they interviewed and questioned the hostages, they realized the victims had become emotionally attached to their captors and even defended them after they were freed. This process is increased when the hostage is required to depend on their kidnapper for everyday things, such as being fed, bathed, comforted. Is that why Sherlock broke your ankle and wrist, John?”
“Well…I guess, but-”
Chapter 9 – Agitated
“Jim?”
“Are you going to tell the council?”
Mycroft had given his last warning to the vampire upstairs, and God help him if he had sucked Sherlock dry. Eternal life would be the vampire’s worst enemy if he killed Mycroft’s only family. But if his hunch was correct, Sherlock would be upstairs drugged out of his mind while John, the vampire who didn’t kill his victims, was sleeping with a full belly.
“Yes, Sir. Shall I alert security to watch Mr. Watson’s home?”
“Don’t touch me,” John snapped, unconsciously taking a step backwards, “and don’t tell me what I think, either. I don’t care what you think you know, you pompous, egotistical, twat!” John took another step back from the Dom who seemed quite unaffected by the names thrown at him. “If you ever touch me again, I will break your fucking fingers!” The teen growled, practically baring his teeth to ward of any predators while he was injured and in a vulnerable state.
Hello again! Thank you to everyone who has left kudos and comments. There is a lot of dialogue in this chapter but it is important because it pretty much lays out where Mycroft and Sherlock stand and what their plans are for John.
“And my blood,” Sherlock added, still not giving John his full attention. The best way to capture prey is to get the comfortable, which meant not staring at them like they’re a piece of meat.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mycroft actually smiled with triumph but then frowned at his new data. John was too kind, too brave, too loyal, too caring; it’s what drew Sherlock to him in the first place and why he was so affected by the boy’s presence
A page from the local newspaper in Wembley loaded and John couldn’t stop the gasp that came from his throat. The title read
“Umm,” Greg said, wide eyed as he pulled his throat away from Sherlock. “I guess calf. It’ll be easier to hide.”
A slow purr turned into a deep growl as Sherlock’s eyes shot open. The three men watched as black took over light blue like a plague, and Sherlock disappeared into the darkness John had put in him.
“As you wish, John,” she said, caressing his cheek. “But I believe it is your turn to have medical remove your collar.”
“You will obey me John,” Sherlock snapped and with the speed of a cobra, he grabbed the boy’s arm, yanked him down to the bed, and straddled him with all the weight of his body stemming through his hands onto John’s chest. “I know what kind of darkness is out there, John. You have no idea, no idea what this man is capable of…you have no idea what I am capable of!” He shouted down at the boy as the violent storms racked through his brain, flooding the avenues and demolishing the cities. “Why can’t you see I’m trying to protect you from him, from me. I will kill you before I let him touch you, John!”
There was a two minute hiatus between their texting, giving John enough time to throw his shirt in the basket and get a new one.
His face hardening, John stepped back out of the room, and quietly shut the door. He wiped away one stray tear as he pulled out his phone and the business card Greg had given him. If Sherlock thought he could throw John away that easily, he had another thing coming.
