"What?"
Sherlock swallows this thoughts down and lets them slip past the dryness of his throat. He can feel John's amused smile against the back of his neck, his content humming, and it almost breaks him. Because it isn't an illusion this time.
Eurus was laughing furiously, shooting the air in triumph. "Finally he falls!"
John could hear his own heart pumping with the intensity of two, even in a room full of noise. He wanted to say yes, more than anything, in fact. He would surely ridicule himself if he danced with him. He had seen how Sherlock had danced with Molly. He appeared to really be good at anything. But when he danced, he looked alive. He took John's breath away.
Sherlock took it and got up. Snakes were all around Moriarty's feet now. He tried shooting Eurus but she was too fast, everywhere and nowhere, every shot a miss. The snakes were trying to get to her, and she screamed as she stumbled over one of them and tripped. Moriarty took the chance to throw himself onto her.
John breaks the kiss with a sigh. A long, dreamy sigh Sherlock has trouble interpreting correctly. Is it regret? Relief? Pity? But as he closes his eyes in silence, he brings their foreheads together and leans against him. They stay like this for what seems like minutes over minutes, and it should be uncomfortable, should feel ridiculous - with one of them undressed and the two of them panting against each other - but it doesn’t. They breathe together in unison, and when John draws back to look at him, his eyes don’t show anger, aren’t predatory. They are warm, they are gentle.
"Yes."
He whimpers. John chuckles. “It’s alright, Sherlock, breathe,” he soothes in a rough voice. But Sherlock can feel John’s own rapid breathing against his hip. It’s sweet teasing and even more arousing because he knows John wants him just as much. Just that he is better at holding himself back. This is
"What is it that keeps me alive in this?" Sherlock pointed at himself, and John's eyes were instantly drawn to his lips, just where his finger was pointing, then quickly blinked up to lock eyes again.
The sarcasm was as plain as day, and even if it hadn't been, John made sure to role his eyes to make it so. But when the man's eyes locked with his again, the look of annoyance on John's face faded quickly.
“They’re unloaded,” Jared says, looking at the cupboard with his hands on his hips, “and we’ve only got rubber bullets, of course. The knives are decently sharp though.”
The strongroom is accessed through an office, a thick steel door hidden behind a shelving unit. With his body hiding the keypad, Amberley punches in the code while Sherlock eyes the papers on the desk, his long fingers flicking out to uncover what looks like a concert ticket.
For a moment, John considers disobeying. He can snap Amberley’s neck in a second and a regular bullet won’t kill him.
They pull up to a dark, neglected building ten minutes later, on the edge of an old industrial park. The sun, low in the sky, flashes orange off of broken windows and crumbling concrete. There are no visible security cameras or pedestrians, but a black sedan is parked down the street, the only vehicle in this corner of the park.
Head buried between Sherlock’s legs, John felt hot, blissful, transported by the haze of alcohol and the scent and taste of her lover. Her knees hurt but she couldn’t stop her hips from circling in the air, her damp knickers rubbing against her clit. She wanted to touch herself but couldn’t bear to let go of Sherlock, who was near writhing in her hands and under her mouth. Sucking that tender bead into her mouth, John groaned out her frustrated desire and Sherlock whined, back arching. She was close, the clenching around John’s finger stronger and more frequent, her breathing quick and ragged. John was just as desperate, panting just as hard.
Sherlock reaches his side the same moment John pulls open the freezer door, a trail of blood smearing in an arc across the floor. They’re too late, John can smell it. The woman is mutilated nearly beyond recognition, but he steps inside anyway, Sherlock on his heels.
“It didn’t need saving!” John explodes. “I can move faster than you – I could have dodged out of the way. A bullet wouldn’t even have hurt me long-term! Instead you decided to be the hero and could have gotten yourself killed!”
Sherlock purchased two drinks – a beer for John and a rum and coke for herself – and John raised an eyebrow, lifting on her tiptoes to place her lips near her girlfriend’s ear. “You could just get a coke you know,” John pointed out, accepting her sweating glass. Sherlock didn’t like to drink while on a case – alcohol compromised her focus.
“Fuck,” John whimpered. The metal walls rattled as someone in one of the other stalls stumbled. “I am not having sex with you in a public toilet,” she hissed, pushing Sherlock’s hips away with regret. She was drunk, but not
Sherlock thinks of his unsent emails to Ellen Frankland with their unanswered questions. The thought of having someone he could discuss with is appealing…but still. “That doesn’t seem wise.”
John must see something of the rejection Sherlock is trying to suppress, because he shakes his head. “No, you don’t,” he says fiercely, his warm fingers squeezing Sherlock’s wrist. “I want you, of course I do.”
“How do you know she had a purse?”
Bumping their shoulders together affectionately, John stands, pulling Sherlock up with him. “Come on, genius, you’ve successfully tamed the beast for one day. Let’s go home.”
Lestrade crosses his arms. “Okay, obviously you don’t want to actually tell me anything.”
“I feel well. Christ, though, John, how long’s it been? Two years?”
“Please. If she didn’t have a purse he would have checked her pockets, but she still has some cash in her coat pocket.”
“What! How can you possibly –”
“Oh, you’re going to love this,” he crows, and leads the way past joggers and weight lifters to a back room, which he accesses with a four-digit code that is painfully obvious by the wear pattern on the keys.
He continues the compressions, wishing he could reach into John’s chest and squeeze his heart himself, will it to beat. He wishes desperately that he hadn’t dropped his coat with his mobile in the pocket.
They start with the punching mitts, but even with the padding Sherlock grimaces with each of John’s punches, which are powerful enough to send him staggering backwards. It’s intimidating, having all of the wolf’s aggression targeted on him. They try grab break-out maneuvers for about five minutes before John loses patience and Sherlock has new bruises on his forearms.
He slams the door closed between them at the top of the stairs, sagging to the floor. He can hardly breathe, he struggles against the urge to vomit. For the first time in nearly twenty years, Sherlock has a panic attack.
“Since now. Do you have workout clothes?”
It is such a ridiculous story that Sherlock has to bite his tongue against saying something rude. Then he glances at John, who is watching Mr. Wilson with a bemused expression, and decides to do a little experiment at Mr. Wilson’s expense.
“Fuck, that’s gorgeous,” John groans and Sherlock feels himself flush with pleasure at the praise, his back arching and hips twisting to exaggerate the motion, feeling John’s lustful eyes on him. The burn of his stiches forces him to slow his hips and John takes over again, lavishing kisses to Sherlock’s shoulders and neck as he thrusts into him, a steadying hand on Sherlock’s hip. Sherlock twists his head and meets John’s lips in a messy kiss, moaning at the slide and drag of John inside him, filling him, rubbing against his prostate. He can’t hold back any longer – he begins stroking himself smoothly, eyes rolling back as John nips at his neck. The still-gentle motion of his hips is belied by the nails digging into Sherlock’s hip and the teeth at his nape.
“Figured it out yet?” John teases as he laces his trainers, gazing up at Sherlock, who is pulling on a nondescript white t-shirt.
They get a client two days later, and Sherlock could not be more glad. Work is the best antidote to sorrow, he’s always thought, and he has no other ideas for getting John out of this period of moroseness. Half of the problem is that he’s not sure what John is ruminating on, and the other half is that he’s certain it somehow has to do with Sherlock. In the back of his mind palace is a straining door with water trickling out the bottom, barely holding back a flood of guilt and anxiety that John will come to his senses and realize Sherlock is the reason his life is in shambles.
“But the wolf doesn’t,” Sherlock finishes.
John nods, twists his arm to check the damage. The cut felt deep initially, but is already nearly closed. “Just a scratch, doesn’t even need stitches.”
,” Sherlock corrects, getting to his feet as Lestrade snaps his handcuffs on the crying Amberley. “No need to be dramatic.”
Jared claps his hands together in delight. “Let’s get to it, then.”
“Put that on,” he orders. “We’re going out.”
. “It’s unbelievable in every sense of the word,” he says, answering John’s words rather than his true question.
John springs and tackles his prey, listening to the satisfying
“Sorry,” Greg cuts in. “None of my business, I suppose. Thanks for giving us a hand with this one.”
John accepts the excuse gratefully and Sherlock follows suit, shaking hands with the trainer again before retreating to the change room. John is silent and distracted as they leave, and climbs into the cab Sherlock hails without protest.
Sherlock shoves his hands deeper in his pockets. “I think John’s hiding something.”
thought I was. The wolf made me realize that.”
Shaking her head, John met Sherlock’s gaze helplessly, rubbing quicker, harder.
“Dead,” Lestrade says flatly. “Father of the second victim saw him driving home by chance, followed him in his car and crashed into him at eighty kilometers an hour – confessed to everything after being taken to hospital.”
“What time is it?” John yawns, utterly content in their little pocket of intimacy.
With a final sniffle, John lifts his head for a kiss that is heartbreaking for its relief. God, Sherlock loves this man. He’s been too blind by his own guilt and insecurities to clearly see John’s.
“Sherlock?”
John peeked over and froze, coming eye-to-eye with a woman, jaw slack and eyebrows high in shock, obviously having deduced what they were doing. The eye contact lasted less than a second and the woman was gone. John felt all her blood rush to her face, still grinding subtly against Sherlock’s hands in her pants.
“It is so weird that this was in my chest last night,” he mutters. He jogs back to the cottage to rinse off the blood then returns it to Sherlock. “I’d say this is rightfully yours now. It’ll make me feel better knowing you have it.”
“You texted Greg, didn’t you?”
“About our relationship.” Yes, that is the least embarrassing phrasing.
“Disappointing, but fine,” Sherlock says. “See you in an hour.” He hangs up.
“If he’d panicked, he wouldn’t have taken anything. If he were smarter, he would have stripped the body of valuables, maybe roughed up her face a bit. The killer knew this woman and wanted to make her more difficult to identify.”
“How close was what?” Sherlock asks lightly, tucking his arms behind his back. “How close was John to killing himself thanks to your poison pill and silver bullets? How close was I to losing my partner?”
“This was the most ridiculous thing we have ever done. I need to start a list,” John decided, still giggling, and Sherlock kissed the laughter from her lungs, tongue chasing the taste of herself in John’s mouth.
“Why are you here? No one died so it’s not your division.” Lestrade opens his mouth but Sherlock cuts him off, practically bouncing on the balls of his feet. “Actually, I don’t care. Know what I realized? After John’s…attack, my brother sent us a package of things to help me, but nothing to help John.”
Eyes narrowed, Sherlock gets up and disappears into their room and emerges moments later with a dingy black bag. “I use it for my homeless disguise,” Sherlock mutters in response to John’s questioning look.
Wilson pauses in surprise, considering. “Well, four and a half I suppose.”
“Why, yes. I’m a retired art dealer and we’ve been building a new room to display some of our favourite paintings. Why is that important?”
“Sherlock!” John barks at the same time that Mrs. Hudson’s palm makes sharp contact with his cheek. Without another word, she turns and leaves the flat, throwing John a sympathetic glance as she does.
“You’re angry with yourself.”
“Shit!” John scrambles up and out of Sherlock’s arms. “My shift is in an hour,” he exclaims and heads straight for the shower.
Sherlock blinks and shakes his head, reaching out for him. John nearly stumbles back to get away. He doesn’t know what the wolf will do if Sherlock touches him.
John’s nostrils flare the moment he steps into the flat. “Were you smoking?” he asks, obviously already aware of the answer. Sherlock doesn’t respond, filling a glass of water to rinse the taste from his mouth. “What’s wrong?”
With a hiss, John turns his head sharply and Sherlock leans back, heart dropping. Jaw clenched, eyes squeezed shut, a growl rumbles in John’s chest and Sherlock retreats, apologies on his lips.
Finger still snug inside Sherlock, John looked up and delivered a last, delicate lick to Sherlock’s tender, puffy clit, watching Sherlock’s eyelids flutter as an aftershock rippled through her. When she gazed down at John she looked drugged, lips red and parted, face blushing, hair damp with sweat. Sherlock was looking at her like John was the best mystery she had ever seen, like a locked-room murder and a serial killer combined, like she broke her crime rating scale. Biting her lip, John closed her eyes as the heat spiked between her legs, suddenly wondering if it were possible to come untouched.
“Pardon me? I really don’t think…”
“Wait, wait!” John exclaims at last. “I am not having sex with this coat on. It was far too expensive to risk staining it with questionable bodily fluids.”
Greg ducks his head, makes a show of placing the bloody knife in an evidence bag. When he looks back up, the seriousness of his face is belied by the twitching of his lips. “So, it’s official now, you two?”
When Sherlock’s trousers lowered to the floor, John did too.
“I don’t see why you’re mad at me,” he complains. “It’s not like I just saved your life or anything.”
“Of course! I won’t be a moment,” Amberley says, leaving the room.
John makes several cuts of varying lengths and depths, grimacing a bit at the last one. The deeper the wound, the more time it takes to heal, but the location does not seem to matter. “Let’s try the silver now.”
Immediately, Sherlock abandons his experiment – it’s not time sensitive, while John is – and stands, walking to the desk to grab his wallet and keys. “Good, you’re home,” he greets his fuming werewolf. “Let’s go for a walk.”
The hand on her stomach disappeared and reappeared on her bum, gliding down and in until there were two fingers nudging at her cunt. John swore and clenched a hand in her hair, back arching to invite those long, clever fingers inside.
“No. Neither of us wanted them,” he says easily. “The strongroom is this way if you’d like to see it.”
Once the mystified Mr. Wilson has vacated the premises, Sherlock stares at his cracked mobile screen (he really should get that fixed) and the most flagrantly fraudulent job posting he has ever seen. He wasn’t kidding when he called Mr. Wilson gullible.
“Don’t move,” Sherlock ordered, squeezing her hips once before pulling away.
“I am committed! I just –”
“Don’t go, then!”
The case is not without points of interest, but is ultimately disappointing – a crime of passion disguised as a satanic ritual. They find the culprit hiding out at a friend’s house and the arrest is conducted without resistance.
They get two hours of sleep before they’re woken by a call from Greg. John is tempted to finish the job on Sherlock’s partially destroyed mobile. It’s a case, of course, and it takes them, drowsy and quickly showered, to the crime scene of a young woman’s body.
The door falls shut. The silence that follows is almost shocking. For a few moments, only the quiet clattering of Sherlock’s shoes is heard in the room until he lets himself fall into his chair opposite John. "Well, that was…" John starts but doesn’t quite know how to finish. He goes for, "Wild, even for you."
He was provoking him, he realised. It wasn't obvious at all, for he was a very controlled man, but he saw it. A little twitch of his eye, a tiny twist at the corner of his mouth. He was not as cold as he played it here.
"Is this the right way?"
"For I could never print it."
"Yes." John paused. Finally, he was alone with Sherlock. Ironic it was now that he couldn't think of a single thing to ask. There were just so many thoughts at once.
Mycroft seemed unimpressed. "It is already done. Ah, Inspector Lestrade. One last thing. Every officer of yours, everyone capable of holding a gun ... Ready them. They are needed."
. But Mike did not appear offended in the slightest.
. And still not at all why there had come here. But another voice filled the room to interrupt their moment of … well, whatever one might call it.
"Should I stop?" John asks and his eyes find his face.
"So?" John waited.
"Oh, but my emotions, Mr Holmes? Believe it or not, my emotions are the only thing right now saving you from actually getting your head kicked into the Thames. Those people died because of you. Because of you alone. Don't think a cyborg army would not have you killed for a mistake such as this. It'd be
"I mean, it was always irritating. You and all your weekly girlfriends back then. But now that I can finally have this, have
Irene was the first to lose her composure. "No. Sherlock, no-"
Her eyes spoke of surprise, and she looked like she was going to say something but decided to let it go at the last second.
A long pause.
"Oh, he was... he
He was watching John with keen eyes, his hands travelling down to where the shirt was half tucked into dark brown trousers, half not, to pull it out completely, and he smoothed it down in vain.
. John realised it with a sweat-draining hint of panic.
It all seems to have started so innocently.
They ended up standing in front of a painting this time. It was dark and the colour red came creeping over this darkness, as if the sky was burning in the distance. The focus of the work was a man in pain, being kneed in the back and pulled backwards by another. The one who fought him was bending over him and biting his neck with fury in his eyes. Behind them, arms crossed and a broad grin stretched across its face, could only be one creature. The devil. The caption of the painting read in golden letters:
"Holmes, there you are!" Lestrade greeted them, looking a bit impatient but genuinely glad to see them.
John waited till they were alone before turning towards him.
Sherlock holds himself back before that sentence can come to an end. He is still careful sometimes because he doesn’t want to sound too harsh or too arrogant towards John. Even though he knows John will like him anyway, has, in fact, started to like him when he was far worse, but when he sometimes tends to be more careful around him it feels more like an old habit saying hello. A habit from times where John wouldn’t even speak to him and he would very, very careful to not upset him in any way.
time."
. Into his mind, mind you.
"Yes, you madman!"
John needed a second to take a breath. Sure, he was used to the challenge that some called darkness, some mystery, others hell. He couldn't be sure where he would get himself into, mentally, and where he would land when exposed to it for too long. The enemy always lingered behind the veil of the dark, and it was known to be relentless.
. Sherlock had not bothered with telling him the name of the place where they would meet. He entered without a second thought.
Seconds later Sherlock and the others approached him. He heard Lestrade's voice first.
"Irene can heal the wounded while there is still time. No one else can do that like she can.
"New case?" he asks, apparently paying no attention to his mostly empty and weirdly constructed casewall at all, or otherwise he would have said something about it. This doesn't look like any of the cases he has ever worked on, because this isn't about a case. It's about the man standing behind him without the smallest breadth of distance, and the soldiness of him is currently the only thing that keeps Sherlock's legs from giving in. About now his brain also has the decency to remind him of the little
After that, Sherlock's face turned into a self-pleased grin. "Excellent."
. At this point, it is no concern of mine who it is that floats behind that glass tank. That isn't the person I put my trust in. It isn't the person I fought for, the person I fell-" his mouth swallowed the last bit before his head could stop it from being uttered. "The person I'd die for."
"Shh!"
He pushed him into a wall while John struggled with being strangled to death. God, why was he so bloody strong?
"Hi." Sherlock wonders where this breathy voice comes from.
A dove fell through the sky and fluttered her wings. Gracefully, she landed on an oak tree. John stepped on a feather and out of the shadow the tree cast on the ground. Sherlock was just behind him, politely keeping his distance to give him space. There was no one else around but they looked just on the verge of overdressed. Sherlock's top hat pushed down his curls and his tight suit trousers, dress shirt, bowtie, velvet waistcoat and obligatory coat were all respectfully black for the occasion. John did not look much different.
He cleared his throat and turned back to Sherlock. "So, just to have this clear: you want me to go find that Lestrade inspector and demand he let me sniff around his case files, and you think he will simply agree to this because I am an acquaintance of yours?"
No, no, he stiffens, he thinks too much.
"Exactly!"
Mary interrupted him with a sudden laugh to which John, to his own surprise, quietly joined in, "-sort of stuck with this," he finished.
beautiful."
“But to see it, one has to let it speak for itself. With all of its different shades and colours. It can be an easy thing to marvel. Or to dismiss if one isn't looking close enough.”
How could it be that, of all the utensils he had with him, the only one he needed to treat Irene's wound with was missing? Someone, or something, did not want him to get this job, he thought. He needed this job. He had never believed in fate, destiny. But he also knew that treating the flu for the rest of his life was not what he was meant to do. He craved, yearned for so much more than that. This job was an opportunity, and something told him not taking it would be his biggest mistake. And that meant curing Irene Adler.
from him, he began to run too. He was distantly aware that now the others were running after them as well, but he had only one thing in mind: catching that guy! Maybe he could lead them to the headquarters of James Moriarty.
The article pretty much gave this bit away already. John might indeed be one of the few people to have not heard of him, but he had not been in London for years and years now. So he didn't really know why he could not just let this go.
The two men on the other side gave each other a quick glance before John was being addressed again.
"Alright, enough of this now," Sherlock announced while everyone was still more or less staring. "There are more serious matters at hand, we mustn't dwell on such trivia now."
I cannot believe that after aaaall this time and the struggles I had with this fic, we've come to an end now. This is officially the last chapter before the final epilogue. Thank you to everyone who bore with me. I know WIPs can be hard to follow, I know updates have taken their time. I'm just glad I kicked my ass enough to actually go through with this, bring my ideas to empty document pages and let them grow. That's the biggest challenge and best advice for becoming better at writing. Kick your own ass and do it even when it's hard! But don't be too hard on yourself when you can't bring yourself to do it one day either. See, that's some advice I should take more often!
“Me?” John asked, taking a step back. He was still wearing his heavy boots, his uniform. Why was he still wearing his uniform?
"Who is she?" Anderson whispered.
"Where is Mycroft?" Sherlock asked. It was obvious he thought his brother was somehow behind this, and John could not say he didn't have the same thought.
"Sherlock? Oh, this sounds a bit forward, don't you think? I wouldn't want him to worry too much right now."
to make a wish. He would want a thousand wishes, slowly changing everything that has ever gone wrong. A thousand wishes from a thousand stars, because if there aren't a million up there, then he wants a thousand at least.
Sholto still tried to smile, so oblivious to anything that wasn't John. John shook his head.
, and the whole world becomes the man he loves before everything turns into white noise. He continues to come longer and harder as John takes hold of his cock and strokes him through it, but he starts squirming, cries out once more, because it's too much, he's shivering all over. When he has finally stopped coming, he feels like he is never going to be able to move again. Not that he minded.
"Oi, calm down, Kitty. She is doing the best she can, as are we all." The third woman had to be Jane, then. She was the tallest of them, her dark hair openly falling down her back.
"Go on," Irene encouraged him. "I'm right behind you."
"Told ya they were gonna be bit pissed, boss."
The sound of the bottle of lube being uncapped reappears, and also the sound of someone (probably) pouring a very enthusiastic amount of it on his hands, then making breathy little noises as he strokes himself to get his own cock lubricated.
John's smile was as sweet as it was cruel, but he could tell that he needed it, too. Damn, since when has he, really? Since when has he needed him almost as much as he needed John? Was this just another lucky twist of this unbelievable parallel world, just like the non-existent engagement and presence of Mary Morstan in their lives? Has he actually never wanted him at all, but here where the
She leant towards him as she whispered, "He is making preparations."
"It was fairly enlightening."
"So after you- after you
"Oh, John.” He sounds so lost already, his arse rubbing slow circles against John’s lower stomach from behind. John’s fingers dig into the skin below sharp hipbones, still in his pockets, his breath going faster as he presses their bodies closer together. Closer still.
John joined him wordlessly. He let his arms hang over the railing and tried to see what he saw. At the same time, John saw for himself the horror of a war he could not possibly witness from so far up. But he saw them still, just in his mind's eye. Saw lives ending in brutality, the innocent people who weren't here with them killed or sucked dry in their sleep. Saw James bleeding out in his arms.
John didn't even want to think about what it must have felt like to him. What his Knight Commander (Major,
"On the contrary, Lestrade. I believe John Watson has come to us at exactly the right time."
He does. Sherlock looks at him, reacts when John calls his name, and there is this pure seriousness in John's gaze that is like steel, but only if steel can be liquid and warm. Warm, hot, liquid steel, and he means it. And he wants it. And that is just too much for Sherlock. So he has to kiss him right now.
John poured another splash of milk into his new cup of tea. His old one had gone quite cold. They had exchanged their places on the sofa for two chairs around the kitchen table.
He cleared his throat once while she prepared his drink. Distrust was his companion at all times. It felt a little strange, being here. Not quite like a vacation, but not quite like having arrived somewhere. He found himself between this laughing, drinking, celebrating folk, being so close to the citizens that he had sworn to keep from harm a long, long time ago, and yet it was the foreignness that filled him up the most. He didn't belong here. He was meant to be out there, in the dark. Fighting. Dying for each and everyone of them. For their sakes, just like the literal equivalent of the knight in shining armour ought to.
The joined cries of horses was heard from the behind the smoke.
In that moment the noise of a crow echoed through the high ceilings of the museum. With a flutter of black wings the bird landed on the arm of the stone sculpture of Athena.
This is all he needs to hear to take him in again, just the tip this time, and out again. He adds a little bit of suction every time he bobs his head up, uses his tongue to twirl around the glans when he bobs down. John has been reduced to loud huffs of breath and a long string of, "Yeah, yeah, this is so good, just like that, honey, yeah," and the petname doesn't confuse him anymore as much as it encourages him to suck harder.
"I cannot believe she could do a thing like that," Lestrade said. Apparently, everyone was already well aware of the newly arranged pieces on the chessboard.
"He got away."
"But he hasn't killed you yet," John continued. "If he keeps you down here, you must know a lot about this place, isn't that so? Thus, you can help me to get out of here!"
John was sweating and shivering hard. The ache in his shoulder had returned. Not that this would be something he was not used to. Nightmares were haunting him since the day he got bit by the undead with a bullet implanted to the back of its head. In the end, that bullet had made him see another day. It had saved him, and he knew that, had he been faced with the decision to lose a comrade and create yet another monster or take the risk to shoot them both and kill this beast with it, he would have done the same. There was just one little difference: had he been the one to shoot, another man would sit on this train this very moment, scarred but alive and about to go back to his family. While he, former captain of his unit, only remained a crippled knight with no one there to wait for him in the beautiful capital.
Sherlock himself was about to put on a mask that looked like a wolf's face.
There was a moment of silence, and Sherlock actually fears he has completely ruined it now. Not only the mood, but John's apparent, or at least imagined, feelings for him. He has always been too rude, too insensitive, too himself to be anyone's first or second or twenty-ninth choice of a potential partner, so why should the bravest and kindest and wisest human being in the world want to be in any sort of relationship with him in the first place?
Being addressed by this title again felt like slipping back into an old pair of shoes. You remember wearing them so very often they were defining you in more ways that you would like to admit. Now they represent that part of you and you are forced to wonder: Do they still fit? Or have I outgrown them?
"Pardon me?" The policeman knitted his brows and looked at him in confusion before his mouth then opened in sudden comprehension.
"Baker Street, of course."
Lestrade watched him in fascination, almost like he was studying him, having his fist closed in front of his mouth. In his next breath, he huffed a laugh. "My, my, Sherlock Holmes. I have known you to be a great man. But when have you become a good one?"
"Up, up, up!" she commanded, and there was no hesitation following that order. They climbed up the rungs one after the other like there was no tomorrow. Maybe there wasn't.
He said his name a few more times, voice growing deeper and heavier with desperation. He needed him. Just as John needed James. And he didn’t want to need him, but oh, he did. He was all alone, stuck in a war behind the trigger and in front of men he had never seen before and was yet meant to shoot down. Yes. He had killed people.
"But you- you can find her, Mr Holmes?" The shoved-out client, Alex, tries to look over Sherlock’s shoulder a few times, his face searching John’s for reassurance, but Sherlock positions himself between them now, blocking Alex’s view."Yes, yes, of course, we’ll inform you when we’ve solved it. Good day." He tries to shut the door in front of his face, and Alex raises his voice for John to hear him, "Bye, John, was very nice to meet you," but John only sees his hand awkwardly waving over Sherlock’s head.
A round of applause was followed by a moment of awe when the woman entered from behind the curtain. She wore a long black dress with little white butterflies on it. The hem of the dress was like a black river flowing over the stage with every step she took. Close enough to the edge, she took the stander of the microphone between her milky fingers. Her eyes were closed, her lids cast in dark eyeshadow. Under long lashes her eyes snapped open and the music set in.
The sweet tease makes him tremble and sigh vocally over the noise the stream of water is bundling him up in. He can feel his pulse quicken, his hips twitching as he feels the growing urge to touch, to give in. A wave of lust is rushing over him, melting him until he feels like he himself is becoming one with the stream, but at the same time being massaged by drops and drops of water that are just not enough to truly satisfy.
Sherlock’s groan is so full of overdramatic impatience (like the ones he usually spares for slow-minded idiots) that it makes John laugh again.
"Music has always been a little treat I couldn't resist."
“When did you notice she went missing?” John prompts, getting the conversation back on track.
“It’s a scratch.”
“No!” Sherlock exclaimed, genuinely shocked. “No, of course not.” She bit her lips as John pressed her hip between Sherlock’s legs. “God, let’s go home, I can’t – I want you –”
Their third full moon, Lestrade texts Sherlock just after midnight. The werewolf is making an unholy racket in the cell, putting Sherlock’s strained nerves on edge. He barely hesitates after reading Lestrade’s text – he’s stalking out of the cottage and through the trees before he can change his mind.
“Alright, boys!” Lestrade yells as more officers arrive on scene. “Donovan, can you get a medic up here, please?”
“Faster,” Sherlock demands, and John complies, speeding his hand, their erections hot and slick with their excitement.
Their client blinks and straightens. “Excuse me?”
“John.” Sherlock uses his free hand to urge John’s chin up, ducking his head to meet his partner’s damp gaze. “They’re just thoughts. Everyone has thoughts. I’ve imagined, on numerous occasions, killing each of my family and friends, just as an intellectual exercise. That doesn’t mean I plan on ever doing it.” John’s lip quirks but he still looks miserable, so Sherlock adds, “I’ve been blind to your needs for too long now. I am honoured to see the full you, the good and the not so good. As much as I hate to say it, we’re both only human.”
“Kiss me?”
Sherlock nods and stands, holding a hand out to pull John up after him.
“Don’t forget my initials.”
“Let’s try out the weapons room,” Sherlock offers and John grunts his agreement. He doubts John has the focus at the moment for shooting, but they manage it for a good quarter of an hour, the both of them emptying rounds of rubber bullets into red and blue targets. Sherlock never misses the target, but John never hits outside the centre ring and Sherlock can’t help but watch and admire him, eyes running along the strong line of him from the gun, up his arm, across his shoulders, down his back, and to his steadily planted feet.
His route takes twice as long as usual, a circuitous path that avoids the CCTV cameras. Something of his mental state must show on his face, because people dodge out of his way as he strides along the pavement. He doesn’t know with whom he is angrier: himself, for missing the signs; Mycroft (
John hesitates and Sherlock hates that there is an invisible force separating them, the moon pulling John away from him. At last, John nods and Sherlock glues himself to John’s back, handing him a fresh clip. He copies John’s position, left hand at his side and right raised, fingertips tickling the back of John’s gun-wielding hand, covering John like a cloak. John’s hair tickles his lips and the muscles of his back flex against Sherlock’s chest. It’s imperfect, and Sherlock wishes he could step into John’s skin, but the moment John squeezes the trigger is glorious. The recoil shudders up John’s arm and is absorbed by his shoulder and core, the tension and give of muscle echoing into Sherlock’s body. The force pushes John back a touch, just enough that his arse comes in contact with Sherlock’s pelvis.
Outraged, Mr. Wilson jumps to his feet. “Well, if that’s how you see it Mr. Holmes, I can see I’ve wasted my time asking for help from an utter –”
Maintaining eye contact, John reaches into his pocket to pull out his wallet. Sherlock can’t believe he’s seeing this. In that moment, he would swear he hates John Watson. He isn’t even smug when John looks down and, increasingly frantic, doesn’t find what he’s looking for. Dropping his wallet, John looks at Sherlock in horrified realization.
John is leaning against the countertop and Sherlock steps up behind him, feeling the heat of him soak into his skin. John doesn’t jump in surprise, only presses back against him, and Sherlock relaxes, lets his cheek rest against the top of John’s head, breathing in his scent. John smells like himself, but
Heart pounding with her own daring, John ducked to press a line of kisses down Sherlock’s throat, over her collarbone, down her heaving sternum. Maybe she was drunk enough after all. She couldn’t deny the thrill that accompanied the thought of what she was about to do.
With the last of his strength, Sherlock shoves it off of him with the hilt of the dagger, pushing the blade deeper into its chest. With a low, wheezing whine, the wolf collapses onto its side.
“Should I be worried?” Sherlock asks, employing sarcasm to cover the sincerity of the question.
Sherlock steps back into the room five minutes later, stopping Amberley mid-word. His eyes are fierce and incredibly blue. “Where is this display room you keep mentioning?”
“Mr. Amberley,” John says, “why haven’t you gone to the police?”
What scares him most isn’t the wolf, but rather the certainty that he is feeding the wolf’s anger as much as it is devouring him from the inside out.
John backs off. “I just want to know you can defend yourself.”
Amberley stands as well. “So you’ll help find my Jillian then?”
Sherlock strains his ears, but he can’t hear what John is doing. “I brought the tea here. May I open your door?”
The beast tires of chasing him just as the safehouse comes into view. The low warning snarl nearly drops Sherlock’s legs from under him. He throws himself to the side just as it leaps at him, then twists to face glinting fangs and calculating, glowing eyes, too close for comfort.
Sherlock looks at his hunched shoulders and clenched jaw, reading a confusing mishmash of defiance and guilt. Since the moment Sherlock met John, he knew there was a dark edge to the ex-military man’s personality, an edge that he appreciated. It meshed well with Sherlock’s work, angled perfectly to sharpen the knife of his focus and wedge into the cracks of his defences. That edge had never been a problem before. “You might not blame me, but the wolf certainly does,” Sherlock mutters, arms hanging awkwardly at his sides.
Turning her head, John spoke over the music. “Will we need to chase down a suspect later?”
Alarm shoots through John and he snags back his wallet before Sherlock can open it. “What the hell, Sherlock!”
Greg grimaces and John rolls his eyes. Stepping away, he scans the alley and lets them play out their little drama.
When he steps back into the bedroom, John is sitting on his side of the bed, elbows on his knees and head in his hands. Sherlock feels himself go pale.
“I didn’t use the silver knife,” Sherlock murmurs, listening to the beat of the resilient muscle in John’s chest. “I used your army knife, the dagger you gave me. When the wolf lunged at me, I used its momentum to drive the blade in. It – it killed you, you were dead.” To his annoyance, his voice catches and he’s forced to stop, exhaling shakily. “I removed the blade at sunrise, to let the wolf heal itself, but you changed back and you still didn’t have a pulse…”
Sherlock ruffles an impatient hand through his hair, eyes red with lack of sleep. “You used to always correct me when I blundered socially. You would…ease the way, so to speak. Why have you stopped? Until I insulted Mrs. Hudson that is.”
“Yes, may we come to your house now? I need to gather data.”
For the next eternity, Sherlock’s entire being is consumed by John’s pain. The chains shift against skin that stretches and bursts with thick fur. The manacles strain against bones that lengthen and muscle that swells obscenely. John curls into himself, pressing his forehead to the floor as a snout protrudes from his face, his groans sliding into a canine whine as his vocal cords reshape themselves.
Sherlock picks up the silver knife. “Let me know if it’s too painful.” His cool fingers steady John’s arm as he presses the flat of the blade against John’s skin.
Their stall door rattled violently. The lock wriggled.
A final, whimpering, “
Greg shrugs, unruffled. “Seemed like an odd one, figured you wouldn’t mind giving us a hand.”
Cheeks flushed and eyes dark, Sherlock crowded her up against the wall and bent her head for a kiss. Lightheaded and tipsy, John leaned gratefully against the wall and buried a hand in Sherlock’s thick, sweat-damp curls, licking the taste of rum from Sherlock’s lips. A long thigh nudged between her legs and she gasped, knees straightening automatically as she arched into the pressure. Moaning into her mouth, Sherlock slipped her hand under John’s dress again, fingers grazing the fabric of her thong as she squeezed her bare arse.
“What are we looking for exactly?” John asked, nearly shouting to be heard over the music, some catchy pop song that sounded vaguely familiar. Sherlock hadn’t deigned to explain much at home. She had ambushed John after a late shift catching up on paperwork, shoving some black fabric into John’s arms and pushing her towards the loo.
“Ah. You okay?”
This is John. This is a part of him they’ve both tried to ignore, but it’s time to stop running. It’s time to face the beast head-on.
“John,” Sherlock snaps, an edge of panic to the order.
John tenses, thinks quickly of how he can deter the man, when Sherlock moves in front of him, blocking his arm from Greg’s view.
John bristles, though it’s a fair question. The scent of his partner – if Sherlock will still allow John to call him that – should be comforting, but this close to John’s territory the wolf finds it unnerving. His patience is wire-thin and his separation from the wolf even thinner. But he is not about to let Sherlock ambush a serial killer on his own.
Clasping his hands in his lap, Sherlock looks down. “Is it…okay for him to be alone? Should I be doing something different?”
A few songs later, Sherlock pulled away, and John watched her turn to accept two drinks from someone behind her, passing one to John and clinking their glasses together. With a quirk of the eyebrow and a tug of the lips, Sherlock took several deep pulls from her drink. John copied her, the taste of rum strong in the back of her throat.
“It’s fine,” he retorts, halfway out the door. “It’s perfectly fine.”
“The killer’s car,” Sherlock confirms, and they both get out of the rental. Sherlock brings his mobile to his ear as they approach the sedan, frowning as they peer through the dark tinted glass. He hangs up with a huff. “Call won’t go through,” he mutters.
The realization rips through him sickeningly. He wants to kill the nightmare in front of him. His fingertips actually twitch towards the gun.
As he’s heading for the door, John stops him. “Mycroft, look,” he says. “I know you’re worried, but don’t be. Sherlock proved himself last night. He can defend himself.”
“You,” Sherlock said, eyes wide, guileless. “I want you forever, and it was only from missing you that I realized what I had to lose.”
Launching himself from his chair, Sherlock grabs his coat. “Come on, John, the case is practically solved but I’d like to take a look at his flat to confirm my suspicions.”
“We were
Greg retrieves the knife from the ground. It’s covered in both dried and fresh blood and Greg is not unobservant, despite what Sherlock says. The amount of fresh blood is not insignificant, and Greg notices. “You sure?” he asks, taking a step closer.
Now that John is alive and well in his arms, he remembers his earlier anger and grips John’s shoulders, shoving him back far enough that their eyes can meet. “Don’t you ever do something so inexcusably stupid again,” he says fiercely, soaking in every play of emotion on John’s face, the surprise, the understanding, the obstinacy. Sherlock pushes him back so he can sit up, still gripping him hard. “You
John flashes a smile that’s more menace than pleasure and Sherlock swallows hard. He wants to step up behind his partner and press himself to John’s back, wants to feel every quiver of muscle as John takes his shot.
Sherlock’s steps stumble to a halt behind them. “John,” he gasps.
John felt hyperaware, despite the buzz of alcohol in her system. She could feel Sherlock’s breasts pressing against the bare skin of her back. She could hear the woman relieving herself in the next stall. She could smell their sex over the stench of the loo. She could feel Sherlock’s breaths tickling the hairs on her neck and the heat of her fingers hovering over her aching clit.
Greg gives an amused snort while Sherlock glances between the two of them with narrowed eyes.
And then:
Their walk home has amplified Sherlock’s scent, too, and John greedily inhales the aroma of Sherlock’s lust and hair product and fresh sweat under the slight chemical tang of his ‘odourless’ anti-perspirant. They’re both getting hard, and when John squeezes Sherlock’s bum, Sherlock gasps against his throat and presses their hips together, wrenching groans from both of them. John has completely forgotten what he was meant to say as they quickly descend into inelegant grinding.
Sherlock hums and grazes past John’s lips to press a kiss to his jaw instead, leaving John’s lips tingling in denied anticipation. “You know how meticulous I am,” he murmurs into John’s ear, the hand on his shoulder sliding down to his chest. “Do you really think I’d be so careless as to ruin this delectable coat?”
Breath catching, John felt her eyes roll back as the pleasure spiked, an embarrassing noise getting caught in her throat.
“Where are the rest of the paintings?” Sherlock demands, eyes flicking around the room. “Surely you have more.”
His mobile slips from his numb fingers. They both jerk as it clatters to the floor. The monster throws back its head and Sherlock flees the cellar, a splitting howl chasing after him.
Still sprawled in the dirt, Sherlock shakes his head mutely, stuffing the gun in his pocket. Cold dread fills his stomach as he rummages his other pocket. The car key is missing.
The stairs to John’s room creak under his weight, but any efforts at stealth would be useless against John’s werewolf hearing. When he reaches John’s door, he holds both mugs in one hand and knocks. “John?”
The smile fades and John looks down at their clasped hands.
Clasping his hands together, Sherlock begins chest compressions. He seals his lips to John’s but can’t get enough air for a proper exhale.
“I’ve been horrendously rude to several people over the last two months and you’ve done nothing,” Sherlock snaps. “Why?”
“I know the timing sucks,” John had said, stuffing socks into the corner of her suitcase, “but it’s not like I can reschedule.”
Sherlock hummed. A cool hand sneaked into her own, their fingers intertwining.
“No, it’s not! Don’t you get it?” John snaps, heart trying to beat through his ribs. “The wolf
“That we found the fourth body. Abandoned slaughterhouse on Whitecrest. Killer escaped in black sedan. Lestrade knows the plates.”
“When have you ever known me to partake in recreational exercise?”
“Christ, John, you took off like a bat outta hell,” Greg pants, pulling out a pair of handcuffs.
The photos are quickly placed back in their box and John stands, coming to Sherlock with the knife.
“It’s seen use.” Sherlock meets his eyes.
“One of our best, I’d say,” Sherlock pants and turns his head to peek at John, whose eyelids are low and lips soft with bliss. He looks gorgeous in the morning light, sunlight turning his hair and skin gold, his eyes shining vibrant hazel and blue. His pupils are wide because John is attracted to him and they’ve just had phenomenal sex.
“I know basic self-defence,” Sherlock points out, but John snorts.
“It’s good enough,” John mutters, wriggling and wrenching at the door handle that won’t give. “Move.” When Sherlock steps back, John rears up and slams his shoulder into the door, putting his entire weight behind it. He hisses in pain, but the door barely budges.
“John, I’ve got it, I know where he’s keeping her.” He can’t get the words out fast enough. “If I go now I can be back in time to drive us. I just need to make sure I’m right and I’ll call in Lestrade.”
“Incredible,” Sherlock breathes, brushing at the thin line of blood with his thumb. Despite himself, Sherlock’s eyes are bright with interest, and John smiles.
“My hero,” John whispered with a laugh.
“I understand.”
A chill runs down Sherlock’s spine. He burrows deeper into his chair. “Well, of course. We’ve always enjoyed the thrill of the chase, John.”
“You don’t need to hide,” Sherlock whispers.
“I doubt it’ll see any more action,” John mutters. “You might as well keep it. Maybe it’ll come in handy with a case some day.”
“Anyway,” John says with a sniff. “My father’s dead and I’m not in the army, so, like I said, you might as well keep it.” He brushes past Sherlock and down the stairs.
get to kill yourself to protect me.”
Falling silent, Sherlock submits to John’s care without further protest, removing his shirt and biting his lip at the sting of antiseptic.
John doesn’t move until the DI has clicked the handcuffs into place, then lets Sherlock ease him up and away. Reinforcements arrive and the suspect goes without protest, a sullen look on his scratched and bleeding face. Greg notes the bloody knife on the ground and John’s torn coat sleeve.
They step into the flat and Sherlock removes his coat, listening as John moves into the kitchen to put on the kettle. They have a certain routine, the two of them, grown from over a year of living together, solving cases together. They’ll come home, John will make tea, they’ll eat leftover takeaway. They’ll separate and continue on with their day, John writing up notes and Sherlock organizing his mind palace, or they’ll sleep if it has been a particularly long case. These little habits, if somewhat dull and predictable, are comforting, and yet they also make it difficult to break out of the routine.
As always, comments are appreciated! Come say hi to me on
Worrying his bottom lip, John nods, still looking down. “I don’t…like what I think sometimes. I’m not the man you thought I was. I’m not the man
They strain against each other for another moment before Sherlock’s muscles give out and he collapses onto the bed, John slipping out of him as he slumps half on top of him. “Goddamn,” he breathes, and Sherlock nods, swallowing with difficulty around his dry throat.
Wriggling in his seat guiltily, John looks out his window. He glances back, opens his mouth, seems to change his mind, then turns away again.
“Because John recommended I…” Sherlock hesitates, forces himself not to shift with his discomfort, “…have someone to talk to.”
There’s a man in the back of the crowd with hunched shoulders and a hat pulled low over his face.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow. “Mr. Amberley didn’t strike me as very distraught that his wife has left him. He was lying when he said he wanted to make sure she’s okay.” He considers his coat, but leaves it. It’s a beautiful day with summer just around the corner.
, that feels good,” Sherlock encourages, wanting more, wanting all of him. He grips himself loosely, stroking occasionally to enhance the sensation of John sweetly splitting him open.
, did you?” It’s more of an accusation than a question.
Light blooms into existence and John turns, shielding his eyes from the torch on Sherlock’s mobile. “I’ve been an idiot,” Sherlock snarls, pushing himself to his feet and stepping over the corpse, coming over to observe the freezer door. “We knew he was still here.”
John is waiting in this charged air of silence, maybe having realised what he just said, maybe not. Sherlock tips his chin up and obeys.
, that he can only lean into him further and put a kiss to the underside of his jaw to encourage him to go on.
"There's a back door," he quietly told him, with that rumble that happened to make appearances when he spoke.
“What? No. I’m just. Forget it.”
"The Woman," he said then, proclaiming that title like the headline of a newspaper's front page. He paused again to let out a sigh. Bringing the conversation back on the track of serious topics.
"Yes, alright, alright." There is a moment of simply dead and awkward silence, the room temperature cooling down just for the maximum of one-half second.
Running after him, he suddenly jumped backwards as Magnussen's body froze. Stopped right in his very movements, he looked like he was frozen in time. John wondered for a second if it was him who had lost his mind, but then he noticed a purple aura around the man, zipping like electric sparks through a lilac lens. His face looked horrified. The eyes were bulging out of their sockets and he made a strangled noise as if someone was trying to gag him. Then he collapsed to the floor. The clunking sound of metal echoed from the walls as the iron bar met the floor. John bent down to take the weapon back and be armed with at least something. Little pearls of sweat were tickling his temples. The warm air went straight to his head. When he straightened his back again, a silhouette was emerging from the shadows.
He flinched when a small glass was put down in front of him.
"No!"
like the sound of gunfire. It was maddening. What had once been a sign of enjoyment and praise was now the sound of submission. It finally ended when the man stood by Moriarty's side.
Entering the main hall, he was honestly glad that his status of invisibility had apparently returned to him. Moriarty could have exposed him, but he was not paying attention to the unimportant doctor sneaking past the gathered crowd of staff in front of the stage making his way to Mrs Hudson. He figured Irene had not told him about him and Sherlock. Which didn't quite make sense, did it?
Donovan raised her brow and crossed her arms. "And how the hell are we supposed to do that?"
"I need-" Sherlock swallows. His words are still muffled by the pillow, but he is convinced John will hear every word. He trusts him. He will know. He isn't even sure he speaks in sentences anymore. "See you?"
, this pool of arousal creates a giant wave that crashes down on him, runs over and inside him, and he is right. Fucking. There.
"Sad to say?"
“Do it, John,” he whispers. It’s sweet but it’s a challenge. He doesn’t break eye contact. His tongue sticks out to lick away another drop of pre-cum, and John gasps. “Fuck my mouth.”
"So you see, Dr Watson, why I am a bit troubled these days. Although you probably don't, because you barely know me... Pardon me, I'm jabbering." She seemed a little embarrassed now, covering her eyes for a moment.
"Put your hands under your head and pillow, will you?" John asks sweetly, kissing the back of his neck again.
As they come out of the locker, John knows this promises to be the funniest post-case scenario he might ever get to witness. And still, nothing makes him happier than the thought of a
“John,
"I kept Milverton alive," Irene said as soon as John had caught up with her.
John looked over to Sherlock. "Ready?"
Moriarty stopped and spun around to stand by the man who had opened the door for John and only now he finally acknowledged everyone else's presence.
knew what they looked like.
"To what point?"
Sherlock shushed him in the midst of his rant, a worried look on his face at the thought of who might be listening, not of who was speaking to him.
"Not like I could have foreseen this. But she is a strong woman. She can handle surprises."
By now, he has stepped out of the shower and he's looking at his own reflection in the mirror. He hears John doing something in the kitchen. (Washing the dishes, maybe? He's too good for this world.) So John still being here must mean that he hasn't just imagined all of this, right? He hasn't gone crazy and his mind hasn't been poisoned due to an excessive drug abuse. And, although the last option is not as easy to dismiss as he'd like it to be, as he looks at himself, the only thing he can see there is the evidence of a very relaxing sleep within the last twelve hours and a pair of well-kissed lips. His skin flushes lightly at this thought.
"Yes." Mycroft's eyes softened in silent pain, and hence lost some of their judgement. He finally sat down on the chair next to Sherlock, placing his umbrella on the table like a weapon he needed easy access to. "I am sorry."
His brain shuts down as they both moan loudly – it's so much already.
"What is there left for me to lie for?"
There was something in her eyes. He knew she had seen it. And she knew that he knew she had seen it. Did she not want trouble or did keeping quiet about this still count as
"And you all help out with that?" John asked while twirling up some of the pasta with his fork.
From there on everything seemed easier. By now he had gotten to know most of the people that were swarming in and out or all around him each day at The Prof and he was very happy to discover that even the worst of them weren't that bad. The only difficulty was that he couldn't look 'Jane' in the eye anymore without biting the insides of his mouth. Otherwise, he enjoyed his work. He could not claim to ever be bored, and luckily Mrs Hudson was the perfect source to gain back some sanity, if lost.
"This is a trick," John murmurs, but doesn't really mean it. His brain is just wonderfully empty. "You're just trying to get me to say something nice."
) Sherlock to go to the bathroom for him look after his injuries. They have already healed a bit, the marks where John's fist struck his pretty face, but Sherlock must've scratched them open again in his sleep.
And now? Even if he wanted to, he had no one to share with what he dreamed about.
"You okay?"
he looks at him. The man probably has no idea himself that in this very moment even the most untrained observant could read everything out of his face. Sherlock seems as if in pain, eyebrows slightly drawn together, eyes not piercing, not even curious, lips parted slightly, as though this smart mouth of his would so like to say something clever. Oh, and would John also see that said mouth has absolutely nothing clever to say this time?
“John?”
Sherlock clapped his hands to finish off this scene and begin a new one in which he was in control of the room and everybody listened to him. "Well then. Now that that's settled, shall we begin?"
Before he could say anything about that, she changed the topic. "What do you think of them?"
After Moriarty's mask ball of disaster, John wakes up in a dark and unknown place. He meets a few new and familiar faces, but there is only one important thought on his mind: Finding Sherlock Holmes.
The sweet nothings John whispers into his ear already have Sherlock rutting against his hand. He knows he has the ability to make Sherlock come on the spot with dirty talk and teasing only. Luckily, this time is not one of those occasions.
He cannot seem to look away and doesn't plan to as he finally wraps his long fingers around his thickness, almost startled when it is so much hotter than expected. He closes his fist around the shaft, hears John gasp as he pulls upwards slowly, increasing the pressure just a little below the head.
John looked over at Sherlock and their eyes locked. That settled it then.
John could feel a warm flame flickering in his chest.
does. John's smooth voice is talking to him, soothing him, and at the same time it lets lust grow into longing. He
If dying was possible for me, it would be of boredom!" He made another series of dramatic hand gestures while he was waiting for him by the chair John had sat in last night. Then he suddenly told him, "Here!" and whipped off his goggles to toss them in his direction. "Put that to the rest of my equipment."
"Or do you mean how do I know about you?"
Once again John was left gaping, and Sherlock started smiling broadly. Then he looked him over and held up the mug for him. "Tea?"
He actually shivers when John's lips caress the skin below his jaw oh-so-lightly, whispering into his very lungs, filling and emptying them with oxygen and making him take shallower breaths. "Yeah? Because it looks like you're even more tired than I am."
He fell backwards into the dirt. The sudden attack had caught him off guard. He could only watch with wide eyes as the yellow cat hurried out of the bush and into the open in a sort of sulky manner, jumped over the next wall and disappeared. He let his head fall back and stayed on the dirty ground for a while, letting out a frustrated grunt. All this trouble just to be given a scare by a pissed-off cat. Great.
She did neither of those things. Did nothing but sweetly whisper,
The General nodded with repressed frustration.
"John, did you see that?"
John laughed. He hopped off his own chair and walked around the table to face him.
It might not be the moment yet, but now John knows how to look for it. He knows he will have his eyes wide open when it comes, and he will embrace it and never ever let it go. He will take his chance, for it may be the last he'll ever get.
“I didn’t mean it like that. It’s just… what you said. There’s no wife and there is no house in the suburbs for me, Sherlock. I just can’t see it. But I see this.” He means Baker Street, means 221B, means … Sherlock. “This life. With you.”
"You asked about my Stradivarius before you fell asleep," Sherlock offered as an explanation.
"So close, Sherlock, I'm-
"His original name. You cannot make a name in the undergrounds if you don't fake your death at least once and return."
, all he can do now is groan and incoherently mumble nonsense into his pillow. John grabs him by his hipbones and it throws him completely off balance, out of control, tongue pushing in further.
And somehow, perhaps without him even noticing, it seemed that something had finally happened to him.
"So, as you know," he started, looking at him with a straight face, "I am, at the moment present, not a part of the human kind with which you are familiar. I am being kept alive inside of this body consisting of mechanics and technology too complicated for the common minds of the dull."
John presses himself tighter against Sherlock, lets his hands grab as many dark curls as he can, and their tongues are rubbing against each other, together in a slow rhythem. There is only silence around them, the flat is filled with the quiet, filthy noises of their wet mouths and the rustling of clothes, and soft, constant sighs of pleasure. Again Sherlock's naked chest rubs against John's clothed one, and he shouldn't like it. Shouldn't like the exposure, and being inferior, smaller and beneath. But damn, if it doesn't make him feel wanton and lightheaded, urges him to do things he has never thought himself capable of.
"Of course," Sherlock said, lightening John's mood a little.
"Wait, you knew about that? What she is?"
John felt blinded by the sight of him. The legs of his chair scraped the floor as he stood up hastily and held his hand out to greet him. "Good evening, Mr Holmes!"
“Posh?”
Suddenly, they heard a high squeak coming from the front door.
"What is it he wants this time? I've been in the middle of a bloody autopsy and now I'm just expected to drop everything on command whenever that freak-"
Sherlock smiled and shook his head. God, he really was dying. "We still need that. It cuts through bone if you want it to."
John sighs. “No.”
Well, that was a surprise.
John watched him.
Not that it mattered now. Still, John found this question already passing by the tip of his tongue, and now he could not back away. Before Mrs Hudson had formed her answer and opened her mouth to speak, two people were appearing behind them. Mary Morstan, next to someone unfamiliar.
Suddenly, he felt a need to ask her again to take his coat, as he was getting very warm at her words. Was she sensing something? Could she see how he was really feeling towards Sherlock?
"Yes," said Sherlock. He did not even know what he was going to say before Sherlock did. Did it seem what? Cruel? Wrong? Dehumanising?
"Moriarty!" John shouted, gun pointed at his head.
John looked at him in disbelief. "How the hell is Wiggins working for someone like you?"
"Sherlock," he ordered and he was always there with him, "Back on back."
His eyes widened, and he looked up from where he was just about to rub the substance into her damaged skin. It was so startling to hear her using his first name so suddenly and uninvited. She would not stop smiling.
"Oh, it wasn't that hard. A little skilled make-up, a bit of-"
Sherlock took his time to respond. "Don't worry. It will not happen again."
. "Now show us, will you? There is a murderer on the loose, I presume?"
"I observed that you haven't eaten for several hours, not, in fact, since our breakfast this morning, otherwise it would show on your-"
"Elizabeth Midnight? Like ... Lieutenant Elizabeth Smallwood?"
That made him turn around abruptly. "What about her?"
Sherlock took a look around. "Where is Wiggins?"
"But when I'm finished with you, it will definitely be cold."
They instantly jumped away from each other and turned around to find Lestrade and his officers strolling into the room. John cleared his throat a little too loudly, not knowing how much they had seen. But to answer Lestrade's question in his own head: Oh yes. He felt like he had found everything.
"Inevitable," John finished for him. His heart was in his throat and it was aching. Made it hard to breathe. "James." He allowed himself that name. He allowed himself to come closer to the man who had once meant the world to him. Suffering the loss of everyone you love … Oh, it can make you crave the truth. The truth in your mouth and in their eyes. "You and I-"
The dark haired, bearded man looked at Lestrade and a sudden and much more primal annoyance (and maybe even vulnerability) changed his tone of voice. "Did you know?"
exactly
"Obviously. Why wouldn't I like him?" He didn't look at her. But he knew what she was talking about. Because he thought of him, too.
He couldn't answer.
"Simple."
The last one is more than a bit ridiculous, that much is obvious, but he has nothing that would provide enough evidence to eliminate this option. There just aren't enough facts to put together to even come to some kind of a satisfying conclusion.
Sherlock responded with a huff. They both knew. They had shared this moment and it couldn't be taken back anymore. John's stomach felt funny. It wasn't because of the food. That, if you must know, was disappointingly excellent. Which meant the food for ordinary people would never taste as good again.
They stayed like this for only seconds too long. But long enough for John to look away and gulp down his insecurities. Then something clicked. "Wait. If you could simply walk out of that basement, why have you not done so before?"
"Oh, hello John," Mrs Hudson said, cheerfully, but her smile faded a little as he noticed the expression on his face. He wished he never had come back.
Sherlock jumped onto the stage where the man, intensely emerged in his text, had finally stopped reading and just stared at him. Instead, the executioner, a big man, was behind him. He pulled out his sword and looked fully committed to making it at least two executions for the day. The big man drew his big sword and swang it all the way but John was already behind him. He gave him a shove and caught the sword as it flew out of the man's hands and the man from the stage. John had the sword pointed at Sherlock, daring him to defend himself. Sherlock, with a full pirouette, pulled another sword from the holster of the guard still holding the paper with the list on it. Steel hit steel in mid-air as they began fencing each other, blocking every blow in their improvised performance.
"What?" He turned his head in Lestrade's direction. "Oh, you thought that I had told him, didn't you?"
In the span of a second his mouth is on him again, and John knows at this point that there couldn’t be much more that it would take to bring him over the edge. He was so close already, and now his hips are rolling on their own, and Sherlock’s hand has found his own crotch, so they are moaning in unison, and
"Except it wasn't! Where were you, Mycroft? Where were you when our parents died? Where were you when I dropped out of university? When I almost killed myself? When I
Sherlock held John's gaze to the clinking of the cup being taken out of its saucer.
Sherlock’s eyes have gotten wide and very blue. He looks genuinely hurt by this. Scared even. Scared of what John would say next, what this would mean for them. John feels and shares his pain, and he hates himself for every word he has ever said that would make Sherlock look like this. He is vulnerable and human, after all. Even if he tries to convince everyone around him that he isn’t, John has to stop falling for Sherlock’s own defence mechanism.
"ATTENTION, I SAID!"
"On this very special night of nights-"
The wheels rattled and the horses' hooves carried him through the broad and stone-paved streets of the city. He was surprised to find most of his surroundings familiar. Huge buildings embroidered where architecture met the heart of an artist. They never left the main roads. When the cab suddenly stopped, John looked up with a frown. The world outside of the window didn't seem any different from every other place, any other day in the centre of a busy city. There was nothing unusual to be seen, no reason for Sherlock to be asking for him, urging him to come, in fact. There was no sign of him either. The car had come to a halt, and now the snorting of the horses was the only sound that kept the cab alive.
, he thinks.
"Good afternoon to you too …
"No, I figured
with his whole world turning into sparks and fireworks of endless sensation until it drops over the edge of
"When?" Lestrade asked.
Eyyy, long time no see!
"And how did you get that cab?!"
"I died."
John felt his jaw drop and his eyes watering from not allowing himself to blink again.
"Doctor, do you trust me?"
"Meeting with the team."
Sherlock led them through narrow alleys and over stone and buildings where people would call after them and swing their fists in fury. It was like being a young boy again, and forgotten was the real danger behind the chase. John could pretend it was the foolish game of running for his life without actually having anything real to fear. Nothing but to lose a race. Not once did Sherlock let go of his hand this time, as if they were chained to each other, but John found that he didn't mind. It felt like something solid. Something to rely on. Because Sherlock Holmes, as it turned out, knew London like a map was pinned to the back of his head. How the inside of the man's head might look like ...
Sherlock's eyes widen like that of a helpless child. Rather disturbing a lot. "Mary? Mary, your ..."
"You are right. We're-"
"Are you sure about that?" He took a deep breath. "How can you be sure that I'm not the one behind all this? That I know exactly what is in that chamber because I was the one putting it there in the first place?"
"No, you said you
. He doesn’t even know what it is about that one in particular, but he finds that to be the worst. For his sexual frustration, that is. Every time it comes up in his head, which is more and more often, it fuels his imagination vividly. So much that it has even made it to his bedroom and he has dreams, half-asleep, half-awake, about teaching posh boy a lesson, getting posh boy a little dirty, treating posh boy a little rough. These are all terrible thoughts. Because they will stay just as imaginary and sexually frustrating. Posh boy won’t love him back, after all.
"Oho, alive at last! Why am I almost not surprised? Holmes and his need for dramatic entrances."
"What did you examine?" he asked.
"Black magic can't help but bite back sooner or later," she went on. "The reason for his success and your failure, Sherlock? He read the books that were forbidden to him. Books that took you way too long to believe in. One of the few mistakes you made, darling."
This is how he last remembers it.
Sherlock doesn't quite dare to drop his gaze yet a little lower now, it's way too much data already and he can't remember ever having been so confused by something so simple. And he hasn't even asked the important questions yet. What is John doing in his bedroom? Why is he naked and wet? (Shower. Shower!) Why is
John looked at him with skepticism written over all his features and screaming to be heard, but the detective was too lost in his own words. John felt a sicker sort of bulge growing inside his stomach. He didn't understand how one could think about life like this. Calling it something that was to be advanced, that was
"Yes," Sherlock said without a second thought.
John's face changed to adjust to the softness of his smile, the skin crinkled around his blue eyes. (Sherlock loves those wrinkles. It feels like he always has. Just noticed it too late.) He could read the story of someone else's whole life within a few seconds, and yet he couldn't even read himself, or what is going on in his heart. Has been going on for so long, probably. But now he could see. Could see it so clearly and literally in front of him that, for only a moment, he was feeling like this epiphany had given him the ability to fly. The moment was over too soon for him to try it out, but if anything it had made him bolder.
Tedious. Sherlock sighs. “Never mind, send it to me after. Go on.”
His fingers do feel a bit numb, John realizes, his arm hanging oddly. “I got it.” With a grunt, he uses his good arm to bend the other at a ninety-degree angle, rotating it out and in slowly until the joint gives a quiet pop. He lets out a quiet hiss that Sherlock echoes. “How long do we have?”
“Sherlock, did I do this?” John breathes into his hair, fingers butterfly-light against the claw marks in his skin. “How bad is it?”
“Where’s the body, I need to see it.”
The body twitches. Eyes wide, Sherlock watches as the silent wolf shudders and jerks, limbs contorting and creaking as it returns to human form. Sherlock doesn’t wait for the transformation to complete before he’s on his knees at John’s side, hands on his face as the last of the fur melts away. His skin is cool to the touch, his eyes closed, his chest still.
“Quiet, John,” Sherlock murmured into her ear, removing her fingers from John’s clit in punishment. John inhaled sharply in dismay, then exhaled in gratitude as both fingers pushed in, splitting her sweetly open. “Oh, that’s it, let me in.”
Sherlock shoves away from the table. “I’m not having this conversation.”
“Oh, my God, it is?”
Sherlock strips out of his clothes, puts on his dressing gown.
dinner?
Amberley’s house is painfully tasteful and practically smells like money, with marble countertops, barely used furniture, and expensive looking décor. It would feel cold except for the family photos that dot the walls, showing Mr. and Mrs. Amberley in various vacation destinations.
“Fine,” John grunts, painstakingly typing out the message.
At last, John collapses to the floor.
There’s the sound of quiet footsteps outside and John springs up in alarm. He rushes for the door at the same moment it slams shut, clanging as the lock mechanism falls into place. “No!” he shouts into the sudden darkness, voice echoing against the metal walls. John slams his palms against the door, listening to the sound of retreating footsteps as the killer runs from the building. “Goddammit!”
“Easy, John,” Sherlock says lowly, and John forces himself to relax his grip on the man’s wrists.
“What kind of work were you to do?”
The sidewalks are busy and John stays close to Sherlock’s side. He’s feeling happy and loved, his doubts of the last couple days seemingly far away, and he lets their shoulders bump as they walk, hands stuffed in his pockets against the crisp spring air. He has a half-day at the clinic today, but his shift doesn’t start for hours yet.
“Christ,” Lestrade yawns, shading his eyes from the early-morning sun. “Haven’t pulled an all-nighter like this in ages.”
Then, that night, a fourth woman is kidnapped.
The place was dark and modern looking, the sleek black and chrome décor juxtaposing attractively with the old building. Letting go of John’s hand, Sherlock led the way to the bar, using her long, bony limbs to her advantage as she slithered through the crowd. John pressed close to her back so they wouldn’t be separated, wondering why they weren’t immediately staking out the place.
“Fine.”
“Yes, and…?” John prompts.
Jared blinks at him and lets out a booming laugh, his shoulders shaking with mirth. “I like this one, John!” he exclaims, and the beginnings of mortification slip away from John’s face. “Where did you find him?”
“What for?”
“Alright,” Sherlock says slowly, then adds, “Thank you.”
John snorts. Sherlock only tacked on that second point to sound pretty. Regardless, John can see that Sherlock’s mind is made up. The only thing John can do is stop him from getting himself killed. “I’m coming with you.”
Turning on the spot, Sherlock watches John dress through the cell bars. “It’s my fault you’re like this.”
“Fingerprints,” she muttered, then gasped as Sherlock pressed up behind her, pressing her lips to the side of her neck.
He barely hesitates after reading Lestrade’s text – he’s stalking out of the cottage and through the trees before he can change his mind. He jumps into the car and reaches the crime scene in just over an hour.
,” Sherlock whimpered, hips twitching.
They’re both knackered by the time they get home. They take the time to scarf down a couple of Mrs. Hudson’s muffins while Sherlock convinces John to sleep in his bed.
that jumper and had been sad to see it ruined. He looked up to find Sherlock leaning in their bedroom doorway, watching him with a disarmingly fond expression.
Sherlock smiled, face flushed. “Good deduction.” She pulled John closer again, her hair tickling John’s cheek. “Except mine’s a double.” She swiftly finished her drink and handed off her empty glass to someone’s waiting hand. Considering her two beers, John opted to pace herself. She wasn’t as much of a lightweight as Sherlock, but they were both going to be feeling that soon enough.
“Did you really think I was about to break the suspect’s arm?”
The air is crushed from his lungs as Sherlock hits the ground hard, the massive weight of the beast landing half on top of him. There is hot, humid breath on Sherlock’s ear. The wolf shifts and Sherlock’s heart stops.
“Oh, save it. You’ve recently moved into a new building, don’t bother asking how I know, I just do. It’s horrid isn’t it, was standing empty for ages, likely because of the mould problem. You move in, and what used to be an abandoned flat is now occupied twenty-four-seven by an ineffective writer. I imagine someone wanted you out so they could continue the business they had been conducting.”
“I believe you, but you’ll have to do it without me. Think you can manage?”
John’s head peaks through the neck hole and he winks. “Or the right one.”
A small, wary, insistent thought had John pulling back slightly. She was well aware how manipulative Sherlock could be. “You’re not just saying that to convince me…”
“Other than me. You should have someone to rant at when I annoy you. Someone to give you a second opinion.”
“John,” he gasps, rough tree bark biting into his back. “Please.”
Gently removing her finger, her hand soaked, John stumbled to her feet, blood rushing from her head and alcohol to it. Sherlock caught her as she swayed, realizing her knees hurt quite badly, and kissed her, which did nothing to help her recover her balance. Leaning away briefly, Sherlock pulled up her trousers haphazardly. She twisted John and pushed until her hands slapped against cool metal, the world at last righting itself as she leaned against the stall wall, Sherlock’s slick smearing under her hand.
John freezes and looks to Sherlock, only to find his partner looking back at him, equally unsure. Sherlock, unsure?
Sherlock nods. John’s gun is in his pocket and the silver knife in a sheath at his ankle.
,” he hisses, tiptoeing closer.
“I was just showing Sherlock some self-defence, but we could use some pointers,” John agrees.
Sherlock removed her hands from John’s bits and snorted into her neck in amusement, gripping her wetly by the hips. Laughter bursting out of her, John collapsed against the wall and Sherlock collapsed against her, both of them shuddering with mirth. Sherlock snickered into her hair while John hiccupped into her own arm, squirming as Sherlock attempted to put her soaked knickers to rights.
“Not much further,” Sherlock promises, but he accelerates anyway. “An hour from the cabin.”
“Cause of death’s fairly obvious,” he mutters, breathing shallowly. “She hit her head when she fell, likely knocked herself unconscious. Doubt she woke again before the blood loss took her.”
There’s nothing.
,” he babbles, collapsing to his elbows and bowing his head. He’s stretched wide, ribs stinging and nerves singing, prostate screaming in pleasure and his cock hard and dripping between his legs. It’s been ages since it’s been this mind-stoppingly good.
“Don’t stop,” Sherlock snarls, striding back and grabbing John’s arm. “We don’t have time for this.”
It’s as if he’s partners with two separate individuals: John – human John – who is stubborn and brave and everything Sherlock loves; and the wolf, the monster who would sink its teeth into Sherlock’s throat without hesitation.
Sherlock washes his hands and sits next to him, a mixture of uncertainty and curiosity on his face. “I never thought you were delicate.”
“It’s for science,” John teases and picks up a scalpel. “Look.” He makes a small cut in his right forearm, just deep enough to bleed and with barely a sting of pain. As they watch, the skin knits itself back together, the wound completely closed in seconds.
Now, at her side, Sherlock took a dainty sip of her drink, eyes lazily scanning the room. “I’ll know it when I see it.”
“Oh, my God,” she muttered, chest shaking.
“You suppose?”
“Tell him the truth. Killer tried to lock us in, but we got out. He’ll assume the door was already like that.”
Sherlock places the bag on the coffee table and sits next to him. “I’m not terrified of you.”
There’s an explosion of movement. John’s back arches and his eyes fly open, lungs sucking in a huge, wrenching breath. Sherlock tumbles off him, pulling John into the recovery position as he gasps and coughs and breathes and breathes and breathes.
“Every day is exciting with you, you beautiful dolt,” John promised, watching Sherlock’s cheeks heat in pleasure. “But I suppose now you’ve proven your little theory about me.”
They tidy up without another word.
“How close was it?” he asks, quietly furious.
With a snort, John skirts around him and out of the cell, bare feet slapping against concrete. “Great. You hate what I am. Not like I can help it.”
“Is that…?” John wonders.
“Very well. They hired me on the spot and wanted me to start the next day.”
With a moan, John thrusted her hips into her hand, jostling the laptop on the mattress. “The door…it’s not –”
The damp alley they are in reeks of blood, rot, and waste, but John can still smell the traces of stress and fear lingering on her skin. He watches Sherlock inspect the body, then crouches to complete his own brief analysis. The body is lying in a pool of blood, a smattering of stab wounds in her abdomen.
The coat stinks of plastic and carboard under the scent of new leather, with hints of the various people who touched and tried it on before John did. John doubts Sherlock can smell all that, but he gets his point.
“How did you…? Oh.” Jared smiles and approaches the drawing that caught Sherlock’s eye. “This is from my oldest, Natalie. She figures herself a ninja, but the missus won’t let her start training until she’s six,” Jared says with a wink. His smile fades as he considers the drawing. “I struggled with a lot of anger when I was sent home. I was furious that I’d lost my leg, angry that I’d lost my career, I was even angry with my family for being so accepting of me when I felt like I didn’t deserve it. I tried to bottle it up, but then I’d just explode over the smallest things. It got to the point where Natalie would shy away from me if I so much as raised my voice – that’s when I knew I needed help.”
Sherlock keeps his eyes forward, frame stiff. “Ah, so Greg is my colleague and your friend, whom you are ashamed to tell about us. Sounds a bit cowardly.”
“Tighter,” John orders, flexing against the chains.
“Oh, honestly. He took her purse but left the jewelry, so what did he want? What’s missing from the body? You said it yourself – her I.D.”
it was Mycroft), for planting the idea in John’s head; or John, for going along with it.
Pressing a final kiss to John’s scarred shoulder, Sherlock gets up and heads for the small shower. “Come on, we’d best go save Scotland Yard from their own ineptitude.”
“Yes, we are. Our lives are dangerous, now more so than ever. If the wolf ever hurt you –”
“Through a mutual acquaintance,” John says, a smile tugging at his lips in response to Jared’s infectious laughter. Such aggressive positivity would be grating were it not for the man's genuine aura of warmth.
John snorts in disbelief. He flicks on the telly and starts pulling out the food containers, a clear dismissal.
Sherlock nods and presses a kiss to John’s scarred shoulder. As he’s locking the cell between them, John growls, “I love you,” but there is only violence in his voice.
Sherlock continued to frown, looking troubled, but then she got a text and flew off the bed and out of the bedroom, making a racket as she searched through the mess of papers in the sitting room.
“It’s more than a scratch and you know it.” John’s eyes burn into his. “Let me fix this.”
The next second the weight is off him, John crouched on the ground several feet away, fingernails digging into dirt. Sherlock scrambles for the gun and John’s eyes burn hellishly as he stares at Sherlock. “Shoot me,” he begs, voice shredded.
Lestrade is silent for a long moment, but when Sherlock glances at him he appears to be thinking, so Sherlock waits. It can be a slow process, he’s learned. “You should talk to John about it, but…sometimes when people are anxious or stressed they need some alone time. People cope in different ways.”
The tension in John’s back does not dissipate. “It can’t be easy, sleeping next to a monster.”
Lestrade recently divorced his wife, but he still has more experience than Sherlock with the whole relationship thing. And unlike Lestrade’s ex-wife, John isn’t an idiot.
There’s sweat prickling along John’s back and underarms, so he wrestles with Sherlock until the coat is off and lying beneath them, John on his back and holding Sherlock hard against him. Pupils blown wide and face flushed, Sherlock grips John’s biceps and circles his hips, thrusting into John’s hand encircling the both of them. He’s panting, eyelids half lowered with pleasure, and John feels a satisfied growl in the back of his throat at the sight, his free hand greedily roaming over all the skin he can reach. His palm sweeps up Sherlock’s tensing thigh, over his undulating hip, up his powerful waist and ribs, then grasps his shoulder to pull him down, closer.
“I haven’t felt like this since uni,” John croaks, taking the water bottle eagerly and draining it as Sherlock sets to work freeing him of the chains. They held dutifully, despite the wolf’s tireless efforts, leaving marks on John’s skin instead.
“What gave me away?” Jared asks jovially. “I came back with three-quarters of my limbs!”
A week later, Sherlock is in a bored sulk from a lack of cases when John decides a distraction is in order. He slips on his well broken-in coat and chucks Sherlock’s to land on the man’s face, where he is lying despondently on the couch.
John grabs his pants and trousers from the settee, peering around Sherlock’s shoulder as he does so. “How’d that happen?”
Sherlock huffs. “You look more than ‘good’. For God’s sake, don’t just see,
“Sherlock?”
John takes in the damage with a shrug. “I suppose. They’re already fading though.”
At this point, with the client spluttering and turning red, John should step in, settle ruffled feathers, tell Sherlock off. Any moment now… John is silent, staring stonily at his notebook. Why?
“Sherlock,” John laughed breathlessly, “I’m f–”
Shaking him off, Sherlock bursts into a rapid-fire explanation, barely pausing for breath as he lists his observations. “He knows how to use a rifle. Only half the strongroom was cleaned and the rest of the items recently moved. He has chemical burns on his fingers from the bleach, his wife didn’t clean it. These three walls have been completed for weeks while this one,” Sherlock points at the wall with the hammer, “was redone in the last two days, and poorly at that. His tickets for the orchestra were never used. Those paint cans are sitting directly on the wood floor – the protective tarp is missing. What conclusion might we come to, hm?”
Silently, John hands him his mug and retreats to the sitting room with his own, taking a seat in his chair. Sherlock follows and sits across from him, heart pounding. Is he having regrets already? He wasn’t lying when he said he wasn’t ashamed, but perhaps he is embarrassed nonetheless?
“Her suitcase and clothes are gone and she took our emergency cash,” he says plaintively, and John feels a pang of sympathy for the man. “She’s run off with Ray, I’m sure of it, but I just want to know she’s okay.”
With a sharp nod, he continues his efforts with increased vigour, encouraging the wolf to the front of his mind, using its strength against the slowly failing door. Light is peaking in through the warped edges, the loose hinges jangling as the door shudders. Fresh air drifting in makes the permeating, iron scent of the victim’s blood all the more obvious.
“Take this, it’s hot,” Sherlock complains, holding out John’s mug, and they make a trade, the tea for the dagger.
The toast is placed in front of Sherlock. “Eat that and I’ll tell you.”
“See, that’s the odd thing, Mr. Holmes. It wasn’t modeling at all. All they wanted me to do was coding.”
“Why can’t you just tell Lestrade where she is?”
“Does your wife know the code?” John asks as the heavy door swings open, the stinging scent of bleach wafting out.
When Sherlock’s pallor reaches anaemic levels and his pacing borders on manic, John calls in the reinforcements.
By the time they arrive, John is hunched in his seat, head bowed and hands gripping his hair. Sherlock slams to a stop at the edge of the trees, yanks out the key, and they launch themselves from the car, John practically falling out.
(See the end of the chapter for
In the aftermath of John’s departure, Sherlock experiences of wave of dizziness so intense he’s forced to sit on the coffee table and place his head between his knees. He can’t remember when he’s last consumed anything other than coffee. He may have been throwing himself into this investigation with more vigour than is strictly healthy.
They throw themselves into their loaner car and John sends a private thought of thanks to Mycroft. They really ought to send the man a gift with all the money they’ve saved in cab fares.
The longer they drive the more concerned John becomes, eyeing the clock and the lowering sun.
Normally John would draw this part out, peppering kisses up and down Sherlock’s thighs, licking along the crease of her groin, and teasing through her knickers until Sherlock was whimpering and begging for more. She didn’t have the patience for that now. They were both worked up from dancing and Sherlock was already wet through her pants – John could taste her through the cotton as she licked a line up Sherlock’s centre.
There’s silence for a moment before John stomps away.
Sherlock glances at his mobile. “An hour.”
John’s eyes overflow and he sniffles, a crooked smile struggling to take shape. “And you think you’re not romantic,” he says thickly. He laughs wetly and presses his face to Sherlock’s shoulder, his tears pooling hot on Sherlock’s skin.
Mr. Wilson nods. “There were lines of code written on paper and all I was meant to do was type them up into some fancy coding program. I told them I’d never coded before in my life, but they said it didn’t matter.”
John crosses his arms. “Sweatpants, then? An old t-shirt?”
The beat of the music was quick, intoxicating, pulling them tighter against each other. “Do you remember the second night of your conference?” Sherlock’s voice was satin in her ear. “You were naked on the hotel bed, I was masturbating while watching you do the same, when you realized you’d forgotten to lock the door.”
The nightmare is particularly bad tonight. By the time Sherlock shudders awake, all he can remember is darkness, red eyes, glistening fangs, and a sense of terror so intense he’s panting, the sheets damp with his sweat. He covers his mouth with his hand, fighting to silence his gasps, but the mattress shifts behind him.
“I’m hungry,” John had complained, turning to face Sherlock standing in the doorway, and her breath caught at the sight of her. She was wearing one of her perfectly tailored suits, black trousers hugging her long legs and a deep burgundy top complimenting the creamy undertones of her skin.
He can use the time to think, anyway.
“Come on,” Sherlock barks, leading the way towards the trees. He’s walking so quickly John has to nearly jog to keep up, the last rays of sunlight now gone from the sky. The night has always been a delight to Sherlock, a haven of mystery and quiet, yet now he dreads it, would give anything for another hour of sunlight. Around them, the trees cast forbidding shadows.
“Call in sick,” Sherlock retorts, grabbing John’s new coat from its hook. “Bit ironic, but I suppose you can write your own sick note.”
“Our neighbour,” Amberley sighs. “There were hints before, but now I know they were having an affair.”
The first time it happens, Sherlock doesn’t even realize it right away. The case is solved, the kidnapper in police custody, the kidnapped child returned safely to his family. Everything ought to be perfect, and yet Sherlock can’t quite settle into that post-case bliss, when everything is dazzlingly clear and the world makes sense.
John smothers his body with his own and Sherlock presses his face to John’s scarred shoulder, trying to silence the hitching breaths leaking out through his clenched teeth. Strong arms wrap around him, John’s lips pressing into his hair with his heart beating against Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock wraps his arms around John’s strong back, squeezing hard enough to feel John’s bones against his.
“Your shoulder,” Sherlock protests.
The kid gives him the total and Sherlock opens the wallet and freezes, eyes landing on the small pill case tucked in with the coins. He pulls it out and opens it, feeling his heart pound in his chest as he takes in the single, innocuous-looking pill.
With a whimper, Sherlock gripped John’s hips, bringing them closer together.
With his free hand, John slips his fingers between Sherlock’s clenching buttocks and presses a finger against his anus, pulsing gently against that clenching ring of muscle.
Taking another sip to steady her voice, John asked, “And what theory did you need to test?”
“Thank you,” John murmurs when the last cuff locks closed.
John grunts again, this time in annoyance. “You have the gun? Your knife?”
John sucks in a breath and looks away, taking a moment to beat down the sudden flare of anger at Sherlock’s acidic tone. The wolf rumbles in the back of his head, jaws snapping. John knows Sherlock. Sherlock lashes out when he’s uncertain or insecure. Even John can make this leap. When he turns back, Sherlock is watching him warily.
With a laugh, John removes the clip and safeties the gun. “Go grab a plastic knife, I’m going to show you how to stab someone in the heart.”
John’s fingers slip free and Sherlock nearly whines. “Hold on, love,” John murmurs, getting up. “I’m just going behind you.” The bed shifts as he rearranges himself so he can lie along Sherlock’s back without Sherlock putting pressure on his stitches, then immediately wraps an arm around his waist to tuck them together. There’s a click from the lube bottle and Sherlock arches his back in preparation.
“I’m not any good,” John warned as Sherlock slipped around her to press up against her back again, freeing her to work on her second beer which was in danger of being spilled with all the jostling.
“I’m not,” John insists, thumb sweeping over Sherlock’s knuckles. “You know I don’t blame you.”
“Disgusting,” he mutters, but doesn’t shove John off.
“Out in the hall. The display room is almost ready for them.”
“Christ.” John laughs, rolling onto his back and throwing an arm over his eyes. “Greg is going to be royally pissed.”
“So, you didn’t do this?” Sherlock pushes. “I need to see your laundry.”
“You’ll see.” Sherlock huffs in annoyance but sits up, and John slings his own gym bag over his shoulder. “Go on, then.”
The creature growls, a low menacing sound as it pulls against the chains holding it, and Sherlock’s heart restarts, throwing itself painfully against his sternum. After seeing this in Baskerville, Sherlock thought he would be better prepared this time. He was wrong.
This is why he avoids sentiment! This is why he was reluctant to enter into this relationship with John in the first place – there’s a case and he can hardly think. His stomach hurts, his chest is tight. He should eat something but he has no appetite.
Sherlock shrugged. “You liked it, though.”
They emerge onto the street and Sherlock hails a cab. “I asked first.”
“I used to tell you off for hoping for a murder just so you’d have a case – now I find myself hoping for the same thing, hoping that one of us might even get into a dangerous situation, just so that I’ll have an excuse to hunt down and hurt the criminal.”
Bending to pick up his abandoned phone, Sherlock turns the abused device in his hands. “Obviously.”  There’s a crack on the screen, of course. At least it still turns on.
If Sherlock weren’t feeling so off-kilter, he would smile. Clever John, who already knows what the transformation looks like thanks to Mycroft’s recording from Baskerville. He’s asking how Sherlock is feeling without actually saying the words. John’s never been particularly skilled at subterfuge, but Sherlock can appreciate the effort.
, John thought. There were plenty of people standing along the edges of the dance floor, chatting and drinking and watching the dancers. But she didn’t argue, just swayed happily in Sherlock’s arms, the beer relaxing her joints. She had got back from a week-long medical conference the other day, and was happy just to be pressed to Sherlock.
Scrambling up the last of the stairs, Sherlock closes the cellar door to block out the howling and, like a child, climbs into the bed with his clothes still on, pulling the sheets over his head.
,” John gasped, head thumping against the wall. The loo was loud with the chatter and laughter of drunk women, the music pounding through the walls, toilets flushing and sinks running. It was the least romantic place John could think of, the scent of urine and alcohol and perfume permeating the air, but she felt herself throb at the feel of Sherlock’s fingers inching towards her centre. There were small gaps between the stall door and the wall, through which she could see women moving about. “God, I want you. Let’s go home.”
There is some terrible darkness in the back of John’s mind, the thing he’s come to call the wolf, a separate entity from himself that rears its head when John is stressed or anxious or angry. It’s an easy scapegoat, the wolf, but John is starting to think he’s kidding himself with the idea that the connection between the two parts of himself is one way. The darkness did not spring into existence after he became a werewolf – it was always there. It was there when he was never good enough for his father, it was there when his mother took up drinking, it was there when Harry dropped out of college, it was there when he enlisted, and there when he was invalided. At some points in his life it was easy to ignore, a mere shadow, while at other times it was a fucking black hole, seemingly impossible to escape.
“Observer effect,” Sherlock murmurs into John’s hair, glad that the place is nearly empty in the middle of a weekday.
hand out any more of your special pills like the sweets you eat by the bag.”
John turns, exhaustion on his face, but too antsy to sit down. “Mycroft said before that the wolf is made of the darkest parts of me.” He licks his lips in discomfort and crosses his arms, looking away. “There’s a lot of dark shit in my head.”
For all of humans’ evolutionary advantages, Sherlock has never felt more like prey, frozen under the glow of those unfeeling eyes. The timer is still running in his hand, forgotten, and his heart has stopped in his chest. It feels like a century, yet can’t have been more than seconds or surely he’d be dead of fright.
“We’re not on a case, are we?” John took another sip, mirrored by Sherlock. “You’d never have two drinks if we were.”
It’s the little things, like the way John is very careful never to lose his temper, even when the frozen pig liver in the fridge leaks onto the leftovers. He spends more time in his room and they increase their trips to the training centre, where John will spend fifteen minutes with a punching bag rather than sparring with Sherlock. They both have nightmares and neither mentions it.
Sherlock manages an amused hum and stands, then presses a kiss to John’s mangled shoulder, feeling the uneven skin with his lips. John stiffens and Sherlock pulls away quickly, searching John’s eyes for traces of the wolf.
For a moment he lies frozen, breathless, waiting for the dark heap of muscle and fur beside him to twitch to life and rip into him. He counts to ten in his head and pushes himself up onto trembling arms, twisting to take in the wolf. It lies motionless, its eyes open and black – the red light has been extinguished. Protruding from its chest is Sherlock’s knife, silver moonlight glinting off the hilt.
He sits on a park bench and smokes a third a pack of cigarettes before John texts him, asking where he is and why he didn’t put the food in the fridge. Typical, mundane. His tongue feels numb and nicotine has his blood buzzing in his veins. There’s no chance that he can hide his smoking from John, so he doesn’t bother. He leaves the rest of the cigarettes on the bench and walks home.
Sherlock tackles him to the ground. John is stronger, but Sherlock has surprise on his side. He has John pinned for a brief moment before he is roughly flipped onto his back. John grabs for his wrists and Sherlock fights back instinctively, adrenaline spiking as John’s body forces him into the dirt. He can’t allow John to get a hand free.
Noticing his expression, Lestrade sighs. “What, have you got a question you want to ask
“Don’t take my stuff without asking, for fuck’s sake,” John snaps, knowing he’s overreacting. He holds back the rest of the tirade that wants to come out, knowing it’ll only make Sherlock curious. As he pays the cabbie, he can already see that Sherlock is eyeing him, surprised by his outburst. “Come on,” he mutters and climbs out of the cab.
“Good riddance,” Sherlock agrees. “I applaud the father’s spontaneity and gumption.”
Yes, John would definitely complain more, only this morning he found a jumper, identical to the one that was bloodstained and beyond repair, folded neatly on his chair. Eyebrows raised, he tried it on, finding it to fit perfectly, and a genuine smile split his lips. He
“Just feel me, and do what I do.”
of you.”
Sherlock nods, watching an older couple walking past. “Good idea in theory, but you’re a bit prone to repressing things. Sitting in your room ruminating probably isn’t the best option for you.”
“Don’t care,” he insists, a whine slipping out of him as John’s thick cock slides out and back it. “Oh, God.”
Their third full moon, Lestrade texts Sherlock just after midnight. The werewolf is making an unholy racket in the cell, putting Sherlock’s strained nerves on edge. His brain is twisting around itself, his skin buzzing unpleasantly, his teeth aching with each vibration of his tympanic membrane. When he feels like this, the best cure is John’s fingers in his hair or John’s cock in his arse. God, he wants John back.
“There’s no I.D. on the body,” Greg points out.
“Don’t worry, he’ll understand,” John mutters and hits send.
Mr. Wilson stands, stupefied, halfway to the door, caught in the tirade of deductions. Somehow it doesn’t make Sherlock feel better.
“I never wanted you to see that side of me,” John mumbles. “It’s why I spent so much time in my room, didn’t know how else to hide how much I was struggling.”
“Who had ‘bad days’.”
This direction of conversation comes as a complete shock to John, who didn’t think Sherlock even noticed that John has stopped rebuking him for being rude. “I thought you hated – it’s not my place to tell you what to do,” he says, baffled.
Bewildered, Amberley nods. “Yes. Some of the paintings are very valuable. They’re stored in the strongroom.”
Perhaps Sherlock is not to blame for what has happened to John, but he can’t absolve himself of all responsibility. If only he hadn’t brought John on the case. If only he had looked more into Henry’s father’s past. If only he had caught Frankland sooner. If only he had been a better shot when the werewolf was tearing John to pieces. The ‘ifs’ circle his brain like the sun around the earth – or was it the earth around the sun? – a relentless procession of useless alternate scenarios. If only John had died from his wounds, he wouldn’t be suffering this now. Maybe John would have preferred that.
It’s horrific, the way Sherlock pales, the way his eyes glass over and his mouth drops open. He doesn’t reach for John again.
And, coming from this man, it could only mean John would probably need it.
Holmes," John said, biting the insides of his mouth to keep himself from laughing, "I'm not so sure everyone got the memo about the strict concealment."
A parallel world? It sounds about as ridiculous to him than every other possibility he has not been able to rule out by now. Amnesia? Dreamlike, hyper realistic drug fantasy? John has lost his mind? Sherlock has lost his mind?
John had never wanted to be like him. But he had still gone to the army. Just like his father. A noble occupation, he thought. He had studied medicine first, chosen to heal people with his own hands, and then later chosen to take death in his hands as well. That was what he was, and he had soon learned to accept his contradictions.
,” and hopes that he’ll understand.
Lestrade jumped from his chair as soon as he was addressed, surprised at suddenly being of some importance again.
!" His voice rose as well as his eyes, which began to jump from one point in the room to another like there was a horse race going on right behind John. The enthusiasm was obvious as he continued. "Imagine, for instance, what would happen if we all possessed the ability to create this for ourselves. This, something so much more, so much greater, being able to simply replace what we don't need and keep advancing and- what a day for the human race!"
Everything sounded like a threat coming from that mouth. Moriarty still stood next to –
John interrupts him. He is standing upright again, looking at Sherlock. "No, I could've-"
, alright?"
John rubbed his closed eyes with the balls of his hands. This mystery named Sherlock Holmes and James Moriarty and Irene Adler and who else might be hanging onto this chain of strange and sudden circumstances. So he had been mistaken all this time? Evil would always be a part of this city, and no knighthood, no organisation, however strong, could prevent invaders from invading.
Within seconds John had jumped to his feet, run out of his prison, taken Magnussen's crowbar with both hands and pushed him into the wall behind him, iron pressed against his throat. He had to look up to the tall man from the underside of Magnussen's jaw, but John had no problem demonstrating which one of them called the shots.
"Why? You hardly even know me."
"...cared about someone?"
"Would you stop lingering at the door and come in?" On the last two words he tore the door open, and behind it stood one mildly startled Mycroft Holmes.
“Solved it?” John asks in a quiet murmur.
“Me too. I see this, too. Us. This life we share.”
." Sally and Sherlock spoke at the same time, and finally Lestrade acknowledged that there were others in the room as well. He turned his head in Sally's direction.
"Colts?"
in Russian, Li Bai's works in Chinese, and that bit of Arabic he could understand had certainly sounded like poetry to him when he had heard Victor speak it. And yes, if you must know, he may have enjoyed some of that literature.
"Are you a friend of his?" He was a bit taller than John himself, and maybe a bit older, too.
So John doesn't mind touching him now. He has never touched him like this before, and suddenly he walks into his room covered in nothing but a towel and kisses him awake? This can't be what it looks like.
"How could this happen?" John wondered out loud. "With everything we sacrificed."
"If you must know, yes, it did not occur to me you may not... not trust him enough to tell him."
He has to think. He cannot remember what he did yesterday. Damn, he can't even remember going to bed at all. Yet, there has been clear evidence of a naked John coming out of this very shower and kissing him awake. And the evidence has not only been under his blanket but under John's thin towel, too.
"Well, I know it's quite hard to believe, but I really only met him yesterday. Before you told me about him, I had never heard of him. So he didn't really...
"Of course."
“Wait for me?”
Sherlock has no idea how to respond to this. He can't remember when he should have done this in the past few months, but damn, he cannot remember anything now and he doesn't know, he doesn't know,
"But you are so, so much better than him. You hear me?"
, he thought,
Lestrade's head turned sharply from John to Sherlock, surprised that John would have to ask about Tom's tragic fate, that Sherlock would not tell him what happened. It had gone very quiet as none of them dared to raise their heads or voices, afraid to disrespect those who had passed away.
"Why did you come here?" Sherlock snapped. "No one invited you!"
"I can hear you thinking, Doctor."
"Say no more. We both know..." His eyes were glued to his own hand on John's shoulder travelling to the side of his neck. "We saw the world burn, you and I. But through two pairs of eyes I must admit the flames never seemed to rise as high as they do now."
"Well, I'm certainly not an expert," he started, hearing his own voice lowering.
Sherlock's eyes dropped as his lips formed a sad smile. He watched those full lips for far too long before Sherlock bit his bottom lip, and before he knew it, the intensity of his eyes struck him again.
John, or the part of him that still had something of a common sense and
Just before he opens to door to disappear behind it, he turns around once more, a slightly wicked grin around his lips. "You could have a nice little shower 'til I'm back, don't you think, love?"
John's panting is the only noise to perceive in those first moments of adrenaline and blood pumping. They don't do this anymore, he is a bit out of practice. What has surprised him a little is Sherlock's hard breathing, which the man tries to hide. Although he has the advantage of his height, he could never catch up with him this time. (And the long legs certainly are an unfair advantage, he had tried to argue with him about that once, the fact that Sherlock could always point out his friend's shortness but didn't bother to take a bit of a slower pace from time to time.
"Is it?" Sherlock stepped into the room as if he had all the time in the world. (Well, as a presumably dead man he might have.)
"Er, hello. My name is John Watson. I have a rather pressing case on my hands, and I'd very much like to talk to Inspector, uh, Lestrade." He kept his chin up to underline the importance of his concern, but after he had nearly gotten the inspector's name wrong, he felt the need to add a quiet, "If possible."
She was certainly taken aback by this, but she overplayed it well. A real professional. "Thank you, Dr Watson. I'm going to send the patient in now."
"And now, people of London, give it up for our jewel in the crown: The lovely and talented Irene Adler!"
Called you in the night time, and gave you all my pieces? Handed you all my trouble, showed you all my demons? Would you have closed your eyes to all my struggles, or washed my blood away? Would you have listened if I had asked you to stay?
"John,
"Oh, so it's still a secret?" The inspector asked with a snort.
"I thought we were a team here! But no, instead you keep on running off on your own, keeping us in the dark-"
“I- I don’t. Why- why should I even tell you? You read my mind all the time, can I not be allowed to keep this one thing to myself for once?!”
He doesn't know what it is that makes him feel so afraid of showing exhaustion and maybe a slight disappointment due to the former course of tonight's events. Perhaps it's just his own commitment to being human once more that scares him. Being vulnerable, instead of indestructible, and much worse: with John here to witness it all. Of course, he knows that he is an emotional human being, the occurrences of the last months have made this more than clear to him. He only wishes to at least be spared the humiliation of revealing to anyone else exactly
"Wait, what?! How-" Lestrade stammered.
Maybe he should really brush his teeth.
don't believe
"Don't worry. Mycroft Holmes already told me."
He led them into another section of the chambers, far more modern and technologically advanced than where they had put John. Behind a large wall made of glass he could see a single man, round and with a face that was not quite right, maybe one eye too crooked or his head too round. Perhaps it was his grin that made John's blood turn colder in his veins.
"Did you just kiss my eyebrow?" John sounded surprised.
"It surely is the work of a genius. But then again, it's very easy to hide behind a big name, isn't it?”
But Sherlock only said, "I must be an angel, mustn't I?" Then they ran.
," he trailed off in a sing-sang voice, and it was confusing to follow, "If you want this job, my good doctor, you will go and see how the lovely Ms Adler is doing. Should she accept your treatment and come back as cured, you can consider myself in your debt, and I will owe you something … And I can be a very generous man if I owe you, Dr Watson..."
"You are going to help me to get out of here," Sherlock whispered, his eyes liquid and lively, seemingly eager to unlock the door John was hiding his soul behind. It made him shiver.
With a neigh, the snout of a horse broke the fog and General Midnight swung her cleaver with an air of vengeance. More knights riding on horses followed her lead and cleared the scene. Heads fell and the dark blood painted the fur of the horses. She raised her heavy steel and slaughtered a creature before it could jump on Sherlock's back and her horse lunged out to kick another in the guts.
John shot Sherlock a look. The detective looked back at him with an interest in his eyes he had yet to understand. He was not used to being the one who walks after someone else's command, was that it? Or maybe he could acknowledge that old pair of shoes on a new man and found they still fitted him fairly well.
"What would life be without nights like this? Hmh? Without a little challenge, a little threat? What if we all stayed the same every day? I will tell you. Staying. Standing in the way of change. We would all be booored to death!"
"Mr Holmes?" Bemusement sparkled in his sky blue eyes.
"You stay here!" Molly warned him.
John Watson, doctor and former knight captain in a war hidden from the ones he had been fighting for, killing off blood sucking, vicious monsters and overcoming death as it had called him, was blushing. Actually blushing from the words of a robot wrapped up in warm, skin-like texture, talking about the beat of his heart when he was himself heartless.
He doesn’t hit send.
“Occupied!” Sherlock called breathlessly and thrust her fingers in hard.
“I just…” John turns to him. “You could tell him you know.”
He is being hunted. He is the sheep in the Baskerville lab.
“Shut up. You’re more human now than ever. When I say I love you and I want you, I mean
John stands and opens the door for the man with a sympathetic smile. “Try not to worry. We’ll be there soon.” Once he’s gone, John turns to Sherlock with a questioning frown. “Doesn’t seem like a complex case – the wife ran off with her lover. Why’d you take it?”
Rather than insult John’s praise by arguing, Sherlock kisses him again. “You know,” he says, removing the heavy emotional weight on their shoulders before they can be crushed by it again, “we still have a serial killer to catch.”
Leaning against the kitchen table, John watches Sherlock spare her a single disdainful glance. “No time.”
“Oxymoron,” Sherlock grumbles, and takes a sip, which turns into several pulls as he realizes how parched he is. He passes the rest of the water to John to finish and lets his eyes drift closed. “I wasn’t sure it would work.”
Lips twisting, Sherlock concedes with a nod. “Fine, what have you got?”
Before they can leave, they have to search the forest for their things, John wearing a spare outfit and old trainers he stored at the cabin months ago. The bloody dagger still lies in the grass and when Sherlock hesitates, John picks it up, looking at the blood with interest.
Sherlock crashes through the trees, an icy vise squeezing his chest. Twigs scratch at his face and roots grasp at his feet, the wary silence of the forest muffling his ears. His coat is weighing him down so he sheds it. The night is cool but he is damp with sweat. Already he can hear the cracking of branches behind him, the pounding of paws on dirt just audible above the frantic pounding of his heart. He is the sheep in the Baskerville lab.
They glare at each other, then something in Mycroft’s face seems to break, there and gone too quickly to identify but obvious enough for Sherlock to feel a grain of doubt. “I could simply take John away,” he points out calmly, but Sherlock cannot detect any true intent.
“I forgot my wallet at home,” Sherlock complains, frowning defensively in a way that makes John’s blood boil.
“Yeah, fine.”
“Oh, yes,” Sherlock hisses, losing his concentration as he adjusts and relaxes, inviting John into him. The angle’s a bit awkward, so Sherlock inches closer, hitching his leg onto John’s hip and bumping their erections together. The finger sinks deeper and Sherlock moans, pressing his lips to John’s forehead. A second and then a third finger gradually join the first, their thrusting, circling, and spreading driving Sherlock mad. He has John pulled tight against him, writhing as John fingers him and gasps encouragements, eyes dark and skin flushed with arousal. There’s a particularly exquisite twist inside him and Sherlock grips John’s upper arm, aching for more. “Oh God, now, John,”
John breathes hard but allows Sherlock to set him free. When he’s done, Sherlock steps back and looks away, staring at the claw marks on the wall over John’s shoulder.
Sherlock leans forward, pressing his lips to the unblemished skin of John’s chest. “I stabbed the wolf – you, in the heart.” A warm hand settles on the back of his head. John’s voice vibrates against Sherlock’s skin.
Sherlock stares at him, brow furrowed in confusion – a rare sight, that. “You’re the best man I’ve ever known,” he states, like it’s the most obvious thing in the world.
He stumbles to the bed at dawn, suffering through the tingling of blood returning to his legs and the sounds of the monster being reluctantly forced under its human guise. His feet are still stinging when John calls out.
“I…” John’s hands have somehow found their way to Sherlock’s buttocks without his brain’s permission. “I mean…”
Shaking his head, John stands panting, staring a the heavily-dented door. He’s nearly got it. “What?”
Sherlock takes the time to unlock and pull open the mangled door. They’re leaving bloody footprints on the floor.
Sherlock cured his limp – that seemed like enough to be going on with. It has never occurred to Sherlock that John might need emotional support and guidance as well. If it weren’t for the wolf, he doesn’t know if it
“Dramatic!” John shouts. He can barely look at him, he’s so livid. There’s a bleeding gash on his arm, similar to the knife wound that ruined John’s coat a few weeks ago. “You fucking idiot!”
John is repulsed, but the wolf is intrigued, perking its ears curiously. They split up, searching the place, checking every nook and cranny for evidence of the kidnapped woman. As time ticks forward, John becomes more anxious, the moon rising in his blood. He’s about to recommend they give up the search when, near the back of the building, John’s nostrils flare, pulling him towards an inactive industrial freezer.
“And tell him what?” John demands incredulously, taking the phone.
Sherlock crawls onto the bed and tugs on John’s stiff shoulder, pulling him down to lie against Sherlock’s chest. “Don’t be an idiot.”
“Hush, John, the door. You didn’t close it properly. If you’re too loud, someone might come in to investigate.”
Even with the therapy, Sherlock is careful to watch for hints of the wolf in John’s behaviour. He spots it late one evening after John comes home from a long shift, arguing with his sister on the phone as he walks through the door. He throws his mobile on the kitchen table after he hangs up, his hands quivering, and Sherlock can tell a departure to his upstairs bedroom is imminent.
“I don’t care,” Sherlock snaps, out of patience for his interfering, overbearing brother. “If you ever wish for me to reach out to you for help in the future, you will do as we’ve requested.”
John lowers the firearm and turns with a lopsided smile, glancing at Sherlock’s sweatpants. “Enjoy that did you?”
“I have, but because it looks like she left of her own free will, they told me to wait a couple days and to try contacting her by mobile for now.”
Tilting John’s head up, Sherlock swooped down for another kiss, hands delicate but sure on her jaw, tongue cool and sweet against her own, the burn of rum in the back of their throats. Their bodies undulated together in a mimicry of sex, surrounded by an anonymous sea of dancers. The lights, the music, the people – it all washed over John, numbing her inhibitions, freeing her recklessness. Her limbs felt like liquid. Her hands did not hesitate now as they rove over Sherlock’s body, skimming down her throat, dipping into her suprasternal notch, slipping down into the collar of her shirt. The fingers of one hand traced the smooth skin along her sternum while the other hand cupped a modest breast, thumb swiping over a peaking nipple. Sherlock wasn’t wearing bra, John realized, and she groaned deep in her throat, feeling out that lush handful.
John smiles. “What if you’re not around?”
“I missed you, too.” She looked down at their clasped hands, a sweet pang in her chest. “Every time I was bored, I’d imagine you there, deducing everyone and berating the speakers.” She laughed.
“I hate repeating myself,” Sherlock says bitingly. “Only an idiot would fall for such an obvious ruse.”
“What the hell is wrong with you!” John demands, planting himself in front of Sherlock, who rubs angrily at his reddening cheek.
“I love you,” Sherlock blurts. It should be awkward or embarrassing, but it’s not; it’s as easy as breathing, and not at all boring. He can’t remember if he has ever actually said the words aloud.
They’ve been practicing and doing some light sparring for about fifteen minutes when there’s a knock on the door. It opens to reveal a large, muscular man, mid-thirties, a good half-head taller than Sherlock, with a broad smile and the eyes of a man beyond his years. He steps into the room and Sherlock takes in the lower leg prosthetic, a hundred connections snapping into place in his head.
“Shouldn’t John get a say?” Mycroft gives an oily smile.
,” and at last the pleasure faded to something less intense, little shivers running through her as Sherlock held her and placed kisses to her neck.
Sherlock nods with a frown, unsure if he feels reassured or not.
“That’s the wolf talking –”
“I don’t agree.”
The moment he’s out of sight, Sherlock picks up a hammer.
“Oh, God,” John whined, in fear, in excitement. She felt herself throb at the thought and her eyelids fluttered shut, suddenly much closer to coming.
After his odd behaviour earlier, Sherlock seems back to his usual obsessive, ruthless, consulting detective self. He’s equal parts dazzling and terrifying, and John can do nothing but follow in his turbulent wake, giving his input when he can. Sherlock is gorgeous like this, almost untouchably so, except for the way his eyes seek out John’s when he makes a deduction, and the way his hands seek out John’s body when they stand close.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock says, lips twitching. He reaches over to rest a hand on John’s knee, and smiles when John uncrosses his arms to link their fingers together. The hand-holding is new, but it’s growing on Sherlock. He can read John through his hands almost as well as through his facial expressions. “As much as I hate the tedious small talk that couples tend to engage in after work – the whole ‘how was your day’ nonsense – perhaps, when you’re feeling like this, you could rant to me to air your frustrations. I will likely tune you out, but the effect should still be cathartic. Or if you’re not in a particularly talkative mood, a boxing match could always be arranged. Or sex.”
“I know I’m not the most handsome of men, Mr. Holmes, but I did some acting as a child and I figured, no harm in trying, right? So I sent in my photo and application –”
“At work.”
“Mr. Amberley,” Sherlock interrupts, voice clipped with some emotion John suspects is excitement. John feels his heart rate pick up in sympathy. “Would you be so good as to make some tea for John? He’s quite sensitive to scents and I believe the fumes are bothering him.”
Sherlock is up in an instant, pressing against the bars between them. “John.”
Nodding, Sherlock looks at his mobile screen and goes still, his face carefully blank.
“I mean, this is all still pretty new right? It’s been what, six months? He’s probably still adjusting, maybe things will get easier with time. And, hell, get him some flowers or chocolates or ibuprofen or something – that’s what I always used to get my wife when she was on her period. Worked wonders, I swear.”
The humanoid wolf watches him, saliva dripping from its gaping maw, a shadowy nightmare that blocks out the moonlight. There are no signs of recognition in its snarling face. It bends its knees in preparation to strike.
“Would you prefer if I slept upstairs?” John asks, not facing him.
He spends the night sitting on the floor, listening to the wolf’s howls.
“We’re still a mile out,” John argues, voice rough. His eyes are sad but his jaw is determined and it turns Sherlock’s stomach.
“You’ve dislocated your shoulder,” Sherlock says lowly. “Just let me set it.”
She’d felt some insecurity when she’d put the dress on earlier, all clinging black fabric and expensive tailoring. It wasn’t the type of thing she would normally wear. Now, with Sherlock gripping her hips and pulling her closer, she forgot to worry about the muscle tone she had lost since being invalided, her slightly stocky build, the shoulder scarring barely hidden by the dress’s strap. It was a significant boost to the ego, being desired by someone as beautiful and intelligent as Sherlock Holmes. She felt like the sexiest woman in the room.
Sherlock comes to a standstill, looming over her.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “With my not inconsiderable powers of deduction I have come to the conclusion that you wish for me to take part in combat training.” His words are snooty but he looks interested, so John simply smiles.
“Of course I’m not bloody alright,” John mutters, shivering with adrenaline and the wolf’s rage. “You have your silver knife and my gun?”
John’s eyes widen and then crinkle with his smile. They rearrange so they can face each other and John grasps Sherlock’s hand between their chests. “I love you, too.”
“Stroke of luck for us, I suppose,” John comments, having overheard the conversation. “Might have been hard to explain the freezer door if he tried to insist it wasn’t damaged when he locked us in.”
Alarmed, John pushes off the table. There’s something he doesn’t like in Sherlock’s expression. Sherlock’s eyes dart to him before jerking back to Mrs. Hudson. When he opens his mouth, his voice flows like honey and slices like a knife.
Sherlock swallows. “No, of course not.”
It takes another hour to get back to the cottage, and Sherlock is sweating from the jog through the woods by the time he unlocks the door. He pauses in front of the door to the cellar, trying to calm himself and listening – he hears nothing. With a sigh, he unlocks the door and makes his way down the steps, grimacing as John, naked and chained, comes into view. He’s leaning against the wall, unable to cross his arms due to the shackles, with a stony expression on his face. It does little to hide the fury and hurt in his eyes.
John blows on his tea and takes a sip, humming in approval. “It’s not exactly standard issue,” he admits.
John lowers the knife and considers the photographs scattered around him. “I guess seeing Jared made a bit nostalgic.”
“Yeah, don’t really wanna hear it,” John says, breathing hard. “It’s pretty clear what happened.”
She tilted her head back against Sherlock’s shoulder and turned to bring her lips to Sherlock’s cheek. “The way I look? You’re the one who looks like sex tonight.”
Their client doesn’t fidget in his chair, nor does he seem in any particular rush. He’s frustrated, not worried, and that in itself is enough to intrigue Sherlock. Once John is seated with a pen and notebook, Sherlock beckons Mr. Wilson to state his problem.
“Alright?” Sherlock asks, as the final chain is locked into place.
“You don’t need to make excuses, Greg,” John teases, trying to shake off the nerves. “We missed you, too.”
“You don’t have children?” John asks, trailing along behind Sherlock as Amberley gives them a tour of the living room.
“Hm?” John’s eyebrows twitch in genuine surprise. “No, not really.”
“But…a silver knife to the heart – not even the wolf can survive that.”
“What happened last night was caused by my own carelessness, not John’s,” Sherlock says, exasperated. “I don’t care for your idea of protection. You will cease tracking us via our mobiles, you will cease trying to remove John from my life, and you will
Sherlock orders takeout one day, a few days before the full moon, when John has been ensconced in his room for hours, hoping to coax him down with the smell of food. When the delivery boy knocks on the door, Sherlock grabs the first wallet he sees – John’s, sitting on the desk – without a second thought. He opens the front door and gives the teen a disinterested glance. “How much?”
John strides after him. “Why didn’t you?”
He gets a miserable groan in response and his stomach drops. Fumbling with his mobile, he brings up the timer. He told John he wanted to see how long the transformation process is, whether it would differ from the first time, but he knows that was an excuse, and a flimsy one at that. He’s here because he cannot fathom being away from John’s side while John is in pain. How could he possibly let John go through this alone? Yet at the first crack of bone and the first scream of agony, he wishes he could be anywhere else. How is he meant to witness this? How can he be expected to survive watching his partner go through such torture?
“John!” Sherlock shouts, voice strained, and John releases his grip, letting Amberly collapse to the floor as he steps back and raises his hands.
Frowning, Sherlock collapsed onto their bed. “I’ve almost solved it. Another day, maybe two tops and we’ll have him.”
“He takes them somewhere abandoned, the location doesn’t matter, but the time does,” Sherlock is muttering, hands flicking the air by his head. “He’s meticulous, savours each cut, thought goes into each one. But his
drunk.
He has never felt this combination of emotions before – doesn’t know how to process it, his mind a numb blankness of horror. With careful movements, he cleans and puts away his beakers and chemicals. He flushes the remnants of the pill. He puts John’s wallet back exactly where he found it. He finds his own wallet in the bedroom and leaves the flat.
With fingers slightly clumsy with drink, she undid Sherlock’s trousers, slowly pulling down the zip and leaning back to watch as Sherlock’s pupils bloomed and heat suffused her cheeks. She nuzzled at the swell of Sherlock’s breast, working her trousers over her hips. A trembling hand settled in her hair.
“I’ll text you,” John agrees and turns to Sherlock as Greg retreats. “You okay?”
“May I?” Sherlock asks, holding out a hand for the dagger. Something about the way John is sitting makes him want the weapon out of John’s hands.
“Noon.”
John glances at the cabby and lowers his voice. “You could tell Greg about me.”
On the dance floor, bodies writhed and grinded, a sea of oblivious, transported dancers. A young couple in front of them was pressed flush together, the girl with her back to the boy’s front and her mouth open in bliss as he sucked on her neck. One hand was buried in his hair and the other covered his hand on the bare skin of her stomach, their joined fingers tucking under the edge of her shirt. They were an image of glorious, youthful intoxication, and John felt a pang of nostalgia and envy. During her early days at uni, she used to love going to the club with a group of people, friends who would watch out for each other and made her feel secure enough to lose herself a little. After months of studying and exams, dancing with a stranger until she was sweaty and dazed felt like the best stress relief.
“Not really,” John sighs, shoving his hands in his pockets. They find an empty park bench and take a seat, watching the people walking by, each absorbed by their own world and worries. “It’s nothing really, just…some days, all the little irritants keep piling up on each other, each one like poking the wolf with a stick until it’s impossible to control, and all I hear in the back of my head is this snarling din.” He scrubs a hand through his hair, his tongue darting out as if to expel something rancid from his mouth. “I’m so afraid I’ll just snap so I…”
When the cab pulls up in front of Amberley’s house, Sherlock pats his trousers with a frown then reaches for John’s pocket, pulling out his wallet.
“No,” Sherlock begs, pulling him even closer. “Not yet.”
John chucks the empty water bottle onto the floor. “But it did.” He pulls Sherlock against him again. “You saved my life.”
It had been late, John had had a few drinks with dinner, and they’d decided to do a video call over their laptops. Sherlock had just solved the case John had abandoned and was especially pleased with herself. John had been enamoured of her self-satisfied preening and had decided to reward her with a bit of a strip show. She’d half meant it as a joke until she realized Sherlock was quite seriously interested.
With an eyeroll, Sherlock downed the rest of her drink in three swallows. John watched her throat work. “Let’s dance.”
“Your touch of exhibitionism?” Sherlock murmured into her ear, just loud enough that someone nearby might be able to hear if they listened intently. “Oh, John, I have
“The…transformation. The change.”
“All you had to do was text Mycroft or Mina. You could have hidden the keys somewhere – either one of them could have come and let me out.” He pushes off the wall, stalking towards him. He’s stopped short by the chains pinning him to the wall, like a dog caught by its leash. “I respected your neurotic need for control and secrecy, I didn’t give anyone else a key, didn’t tell your brother about this place, though I’m sure he knows about it.” He jerks against the chains, teeth bared. The keys rattle in Sherlock’s shaking hand. “I put myself in your hands and you can’t even commit to me for one night!”
“Christ, I knew he cracked his skull open that one time,” he mutters, elbows on his knees. “Why are you telling me all this?”
“You know, it’s probably unhealthy to project your emotions onto your bed,” John grumbles, but acquiesces nonetheless. They strip, Sherlock tucking his silver knife in his pants drawer, and they tumble into bed. John smacks a wet kiss on Sherlock’s cheek and dodges his swatting hands. “Goodnight,” he mumbles against Sherlock’s nape. “Or good morning, I guess.”
