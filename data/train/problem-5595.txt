"This one's yours, kid," Coulson told him. "You got your keys?"
"I can't." Tony gritted out.
"You wouldn't stay awake long enough for a movie," Clint shot back as he sat down on the ground, legs crossed.
"Well, hows about we get up off this floor an' fix ya dog, wouldn't you say?" Bucky said, hoping it'd help the man out with his anxiety of the situation. The man nodded in appreciation, awkwardly moving out of his hold. He froze when he realized Steve was still holding onto his hand, and the blond retracted it with a shocked "oh".
To Peter's surprise, Steve smirked. For some reason, Tony chuckled too. Cap raised his hands in surrender.
"Are you gonna tell him?" Clint asked, joining the conversation.
"What?" He squeaked. He closed his eyes, giving himself a mental face-palm and cursing his voice in the foulest language he could conjure up in his pure mind. "I didn't call anyone, what-"
Ana gave a soft whine, laying down flat on the floor, her brown eyes looking up at him.
Steve sighed, not knowing what to say to that. Clint cleared his throat, standing up from the couch and laying a hand on Peter's shoulder to guide him out. Peter didn't protest, shooting one last worried glance towards his mentor before walking away with Clint, leaving the room in silence once more. Steve felt like punching a wall because he knew what happened when Tony spoke like that. He became impassive, hiding behind his masks. Steve didn't like it when Tony did that, he liked him when he was his happy, energetic self. Tony had said that thinking took ten times as long, but saying 'I've had worse' had come out immediately- indicating he was used to saying it. Breaking the silence, Nat spoke up.
him. And, a little embarrassed, he told her how he'd said that he didn't love Tony, not in that way. When he was done, he refused to meet her eyes.
Turns out, the day wasn't that long. Tony spent some more time talking to the three people he'd met this afternoon but had known for years, pleased to see the boy, Peter, relax as time went by (and stubbornly ignoring that weird feeling he felt when looking at Steve, they were just
"You have curls, now that the gel's out," he noticed. Tony shot him a playful look.
you need. Just let someone take care of
Steve had gotten the call roughly ten minutes ago, stating simply that Tony Stark was in the hospital, and he needed to come quickly. Apparently, Tony had been assaulted when leaving a press conference. Someone had broken through the fences and had managed to land a critical hit on Tony's head, immediately knocking the man unconscious. There had been several attempts to wake him up, but he'd remained unresponsive. Later on, Steve would be angry at the doctors for calling him hours after the fact, but now he just felt worried.
"It is good, I think. I meet nice people," he told her. Peggy smiled.
She let the young boy out of the elevator, kindly bidding him goodbye even though she was all around him at all times.
"Another foreign exchange student, that's so cool! Nat, Thor, and Loki were, too. Have you lived here long? Do you even speak English? Can you understand what I'm saying at all right now?"
"I'm doing good. How are you?"
"Wait," Steve said, finally speaking up. "Tony... Please sit down." Tony hesitantly did as he was told, although he sat down a good distance away from Steve. Both of them missed the contact immediately. "Tony..." Steve tried again. "I- I don't know what to say..."
"Spanish, Francese, Ungherese--"
"Not funny, I think I'm really going to die in here," Tony warned, his voice stern but his face soft. "What's the point of hospitals if they leave you in there until you still die of boredom,"
"He's a lil' savage, this one."
Steve nodded, satisfied.
"Oh, Tony, we can't choose who we love," Steve sighed. "A boy can indeed like another boy, so can girls, but it's less common."
Lots of love to all of you, make sure to comment what you think of this chapter. It didn't quite turn out the way I planned, but oh well.
"You cryin'?" He croaked out. Steve laughed, more out of relief than anything else as tears still made their way down his dirty cheeks. Tony sighed, closing his eyes as a single tear slipped from the corner of his eye.
, quickly racing after him. When he reached the top it took everything in him not to fall back down again. On the ground was the armor. Or, rather what was left of it. It was torn to shreds, the helmet was completely gone and the suit was barely wrapping around the arms and legs. The back seemed to still hold, but the front was merely a few strings of armor.
Steve put away his work, pulling Tony into his side like he was used to doing now. He thought about it for a long time.
"Stay," he ordered. Clint obliged. "What do you want, Steve?"
"Don't say that, Tony. You have nothing to be sorry for."
"'tis true, my friend." Thor boomed, although he boomed it softer this time. "Do you wish to join us in our game?"
Let me know what you thought of this chapter and what you want to see moving forward. If you want, you can find me on
"I'm sorry," he said with much less enthusiasm than before. "I just- you sound weird."
This chapter is a little heavier, so trigger warning for mentions of abuse...
Steve didn't know what to say. He didn't like how Tony sounded. It's like he was a whole different person. It made Steve's stomach churn, a heavy feeling settling in like stone.
"His chest needs to be checked out, too," he told the doctor. "His... Aunt told me he has pains there."
, he told himself.
"Steve?"
"This is not what I want, Tony. It's what's best and safest for this city and its people-"
"Well, I really should go back inside. I hope we won't keep you awake much longer." Steve nodded, concern and protectiveness pooling in his gut as he heard Tiberius' voice from inside the apartment, yelling for Tony to hurry it up. Tony shot Steve an apologetic look before saying goodbye.
"What is?" Steve asked. Of course he knew what the super spy meant, he just wasn't sure he could fully admit it to himself yet. He didn't want to get his hopes up, because he was too afraid of being let down.
When they were seemingly done, Peter put it back on his wrist with a smooth motion as Tony put the target, which was a simple cup, back on the table. He gave Peter a thumbs up and went to stand behind him. Peter again took a deep breath, again followed by a similar motion and a string shooting from his wrist. Only this time, the cup didn't fall on the ground. This time, it was stuck against the wall by what seemed like a spider web. Steve thought it had looked a lot like a web-grenade, as it wasn't attached to a long string it usually had.
"Don't worry about it, I just want to make sure you're alright. I'm Steve, by the way," he said, extending his hand for Tony to shake. Tony looked at him with big, confused eyes, caught slightly off-guard at the sudden topic change. "We didn't get to introduce ourselves last time," he shrugged in explanation. Tony shook his hand.
"Bruce, Tony?" He called. "Is everything okay?"
"How so?" He asked, his voice higher than he had intended, the sick feeling in his stomach increasing.
With that, he was out the door.
After what felt like hours and possibly
Happy New Year's eve everyone. I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas as well, and I wish you all the best for 2021. Enjoy this last little chapter before the year's over <3
"Now, now. No need to be so hard on yourself." He ran his hands soothingly through the billionaire's brown curls. "You know, you scared the shit out of all of us today. Although Steve acted out just now, I can see his reasons behind it. He's scared, Tones. Scared of losing you. We all are."
"It's okay," he whispered in Tony's ear, repeating it softly until Tony had recollected himself. He sat up a bit, slowly, and moved to lean into Steve's side instead. He relaxed with a sigh, eyes sliding closed. He knew he'd probably be out cold 30 minutes into the 'movie night'. But honestly, he was too tired to even be sorry for that.
"SHUT UP!" Tony yelled, his head pounding and his heart aching. He just wanted it to stop, he just wanted it to stop-
"Can I sit here?" He asked politely. Loki looked a bit shocked but nodded nonetheless, and Tony sat down with a happy smile. A look of hurt flashed over Steve's face, but it was quickly wiped away as he took his seat. Dinner was as noisy as always, but Steve couldn't help looking at Tony all throughout. Tony didn't even notice, too busy talking animatedly to Loki, his hands flailing about as he talked. Loki seemed happy to listen, although when he said something, Tony laughed. Steve clenched his fists. It should be
He turned around and walked out, not sparing his boyfriend another glance.
"Very well. I have some bullies to talk to, make sure Fury doesn't go easy on them," Peggy agreed. Steve winced at the last part, knowing Fury
"Okay Tony, we won't get angry. Right, doctor?" Steve gave the doctor a stern look, or as stern as an 18-year-old could manage against a grown man, but the doctor complied.
"Not-not the point," he said quickly, trying to change the subject. It only caused Tony to shoot him a smirk.
the team." Steve said, voice cold.
the genius repeated, his voice barely a whisper.
Steve was kneeling beside it, his hands hovering above Tony's lifeless form as if not sure if he could touch him or not. Peter carefully approached, praying to no one in particular as he kneeled down and put a finger against his mentor's neck. He closed his eyes and held his breath as his fingers softly touched Tony's neck. He breathed out a sigh of relief when he felt a gentle thudding against his fingers. He did realize it was too slow.
"Excuse me?" He asked, unable to keep the grin out of his voice. "Did America's golden boy do something illegal?"
He did.
Mio padre: my father
"Hi, Happy!" He grinned over-excitedly. Happy just grumbled something in return and started the car. During the ride, there wasn't a single silent moment as Peter chatted the driver's ears off. Happy pretended to be, well...
I've had a rough few months, lemme tell you. I graduated (with a separate cambridge diploma which is totally my biggest achievement to date), had an identity crisis, figured out I was non-binary which, yay, I guess, changed my name (yes I got to pick my own name, hello, I'm Robin nice to meet u), went to a new school, and suddenly I have 0 time left with this 'discover yourself' study.
"On the off-chance Steve will let me stay, I guess it couldn't hurt to stick around. Someone needs to keep
"Broke," he stated simply.
"What stuff?"
Tony reeled back as if the words physically burned him. It sure felt like it.
"Sì. E Russian, e Italiano, of course. Un po English."
"So... that a sì?" He asked. Bruce laughed and nodded.
"What do you propose we do?"
"I think English say Hunger?" He said hesitantly.
. She didn't want him to end up like her, closed off from the people around him, never letting others know how he was feeling. She didn't want to crush that innocence and in doing so, she realized hers hadn't been crushed yet, either. So as she held her young friend close, she let her maternal instincts kick in, and didn't hold them back. Tony didn't deserve that and frankly, neither did she.
Steve took a deep breath and slowly let it out again before rapping his knuckles on Tony's door.
"' M good," he said. "Arm's itchy."
The car ride to the hospital was spent in a slightly pressing silence neither Steve nor Tony knew how to break. Luckily the ride wasn't long, and soon enough they were standing in front of the local hospital and Tony was even paler than before.
"Negotiation," Tony said, shrugging as he leaned back again.
Tony interrupted.
"Never Have I Ever is actually quite self-explanatory. Someone names a situation, for example: 'never have I ever driven drunk', or something like that. The rest of the participants say if they have or haven't. That's it, really. Not that hard,"
"Italy," Tony confirmed.
Steve smiled down at his sleeping beauty in his arms, a warm feeling in his chest. He placed a tender kiss in the engineer's curls, inhaling his sweet scent.
"Ey man, I'm not losing. I'm just... Saving my cards." The dirty blond, Clint, apparently, defended himself.
"Really?" He said, gesturing with his hands. "How many times do I have to tell you, Dum-E, I don't drink oil," Dum-E made a beeping noise, somehow causing Tony to sigh again.
When he came up he saw Steve dragging Tony behind him, out of the elevator.
"Ey, kid?" He called. "Can ya hear me?"
Peter thought.
"You asked me to alert you, sir. I am alerting you, sir," FRIDAY simply replied with her most emotionless voice, causing Tony to come to a halt, making a face.
"Come on, Mr. Stark. I could eat a whole horse!" His voice was heard from up the stairs. Tony chuckled quietly, turning towards Steve and giving him his rare, warm smile.
"You speak Spanish?" He asked, genuinely curious.
not dumb, not
No, he had to be. He'd repeated the words over and over again, trying to get his vowels to sound the same as the American voice had. He even changed up his rolling r to the one Americans used. He wondered, would his father be proud of how far he's come?
"Um, what?" Tony asked, not really understanding what was going on.
Steve sighed. School hadn't even started yet and he was already longing for the next summer vacation.
Steve is stupid and Nat's a queen.
way. Remember what I explained earlier?"
, as Bucky so elegantly put it.
"I-I not dumb," he protested weakly, tears threatening to fall.
"Brother, you must calm down," he tried. Loki's gaze shot up to meet his brother's.
"If I remember correctly, you were never
"What's wrong?" Tony asked softly, petting his dog behind her ears, a spot he knew she liked. Ana gave another whine in response. "Are you sick,
"Hi," Steve managed to say back. Tony's face fell a bit.
"If that is love, then... I love
"Oh," Tony said, looking down in thought. There was nothing judgmental in his tone, just thoughtfulness.
Steve snapped himself from his raging thoughts by Tony's voice and met his concerned eyes. His sweater was back on and only his cast and black eye stood out. For the rest, he looked as normal as ever.
Tony didn't really know what he meant but nodded anyway, hoping that was good enough. Fury held out the key for him to take and Tony hesitated. Fury raised an eyebrow.
"Lean on Me" by Bill Withers played loudly in his apartment, the speakers aimed up at Tony's floor, hoping Tony would hear the lyrics and know that he could lean on Steve if necessary. The song had started over again for the third time, the neighbors getting slightly pissed, when Tony showed up at his door, looking disheveled and shocked, his brown orbs blown wide.
Antonio carefully took a seat, curled into himself slightly to make himself appear even smaller than he already was. Ms. Hill started talking at the front of the class but Steve was focused on the conversation between his childhood friend and the new kid.
"Hello, friend Rogers!" Thor boomed happily. Tony flinched slightly at the sound but didn't seem too scared. "Who is the little friend you have brought with?"
The door to the classroom finally opened to reveal their teacher, Ms. Hill. Behind her was a young boy with messy brown hair and an oversized, red sweater with 'Venice' on it, clutching the strap of his backpack so hard his knuckles turned white and his eyes trained on the ground. He was short and seemed too young to be a junior.
"I promise."
Prepotente: Bully
Tony laughed, which quickly escalated into a coughing fit.
did school suck. Besides, this was a boarding school. Which meant he wasn't going to be allowed to go back home until next break. Oh, and dorms. That too.
Hypothetically, of course," he interrupted, already planning an alibi and fully intending to feign ignorance about where the arrows had come from.
Everyone was being pretty fucking dramatic. He was enjoying it more than he should.
"Pegs," Steve said immediately, a smile tugging at his lips despite everything. "She's gonna want ta punch me for not visitin' before now."
"Tony. Sweetheart." Steve sounded just a little upset, and it was music to his ears. He was also still there, which never happened when Tony was so awake. Tiny Adorable Steve's ghost never stayed long enough to argue with him. "I got a version of ya ta work with a Trickster God in order ta bend the fabric of space and time ta get me here. It'd be real nice if ya'd open your eyes and maybe gimme a kiss good morning. Quite a few people went ta an awful lot of trouble so we could kiss again."
But now? Now he was almost dizzy with all the extra oxygen he was getting. He couldn't believe how much of a difference it made, or that most people felt this way most of the time. He was never going to take it for granted again, that was for damn sure. Steve had laughed when he brought it up, a little bit of pain in his his eyes. 'One of the first things I said ta Buck after I got the serum', he'd admitted quietly, hesitantly. That had hurt for a few seconds, because any talk of Bucky Barnes was always bound to. Once he'd pushed past that he'd given his

Which he was supposed to be doing. Any second.
team. The Avengers trained together multiple times a week and participated in 'bonding sessions' that had been first ordered by Fury but quickly became second nature.
Both 'bots beeped in interest while STAR jumped down on top of U, giving him a brief pat. She was far more careful when she dropped down onto the bed and then came to curl against his neck.
, not arrested, not locked away where they couldn't fight for their world. STAR had leashed her bloodthirsty instincts because she'd known it would make him unhappy to see any of them dead.
It helped, there in the almost-dark as he wrestled with his mind. Having Laney and Peter there with him, snoring quietly as they snuggled safely under the covers, kept his thoughts from turning too dark. He loved them as much as they loved him, something that he knew anchored him and kept him centered. And even though he'd made mistakes, even though he could have been
"I'm breathing," he defended, still unable to look away from the squabbling happening in front of him. Rogers was positioned in front of Wanda like she needed his protection, while Clint was standing nearby with his bow already drawn. At least Sam didn't look eager to join the fight, and Natasha was still trying to get Jess to look at her long enough to start a stare-down. "I am breathing very well, thanks."
Steve's heart stopped in his chest, and not only because Loki had his murder face on. He loved Shellhead like... well. Like a brother. That Tony wasn't his lover but was still so, so important to him. He'd never meant to hurt the other man. He should have known that his disappearing act would cut like a knife. When he had gone away it was with the intent and expectation of continued communication and he'd dropped the ball. He'd hurt his best friend, and that was unacceptable.
"I don't know. Fri would probably know if you're real or not, but I don't... I'm not ready for you to go yet. Besides, maybe I've slipped so far that I'd imagine her seeing you too. I'm not allowed to be that kind of delusional,
FRIDAY
doin' it to defend his honor," he said before he stuck his tongue out at the archer. "He'd do just fine on his own."
"Oh, so you just assumed I'd fold like a cheap suit? Is that it?"
Maybe he also wanted to know if he was giving Rogers a few good punches or if he was going to need to break some bones to get his point across. He might have been worried about that desire for violence, might have wondered if the serum really did go bad the way Bucky'd thought it might... but it was all for Tony. His fella had been hurt, nearly died, and he was looking to pay back some of that damage.
You said there were two reasons Earth hasn't faced more hostile invasions. We've only talked about one, so what was the other?
Lunch was a pretty big affair - Viz brought Rhodey down every day and Pepper joined them whenever she could. Laney and Harley's mother - Alicia - were usually there as well. Sometimes the afternoon saw them all parting, sometimes they watched movies together, and occasionally he browsed college courses with Alicia. They were both thinking about doing some classes online now that they had the luxury of time.
If either of them touched his ass, he was calling in a gauntlet to get them away. Then he was going to kick
Or maybe taking Rhodey's advice wouldn't be the huge mistake he had thought it was.
in a way he just couldn't be, for years. Over and over he'd given Rogers his way, let the man's intentions make up for the way his actions were so often lacking. He'd swallowed the disregard, the casual, maybe unintentional cruelty and mistrust because it was Steve Rogers - Captain America for Christ's sake. Tony had been so sure that he was the one lacking that he hadn't been able to see what was going so horribly wrong on the team. He'd forgotten where the best of intentions led, and he'd done it because of that fucking voice coupled with that earnest look on the man's face.
“Why would you-- shut up and help me!”
occasionally be both tactful and restrained when giving out presents.
That was sweet enough that it helped get his laughter down to giggles. When he felt Harley's sharp eyes on him though he sobered right up, meeting that gaze head-on. Tony had been talking about him to people, even this teenager who maybe wasn't blood but was still important to him. He wanted to make the best impression he possibly could on all of Tony's kids.
"Well I would. Now open that trap-a yours and start talkin'."

Sooooo... lately I've had like, a super ambivalent feeling towards MCU and kind of Marvel in general? Or maybe not ambivalent, probably more like vaguely angry and drained? Which makes it very hard to write in the fandom, as one might guess. Having that feeling during this particular chapter where I was feeling lots of pressure to get it

Thanks so much for reading, comments make me all happy and giggly inside so maybe leave some if you like it? <3
Honestly, he still couldn't look
Steve hadn’t left his side for longer than an hour since he’d been brought in. Tony strongly suspected he was using his old SHIELD quarters to shower and take the brief Nat-mandated breaks from his vigil. He had woken up in the night to see the blond sleeping in the uncomfortable hospital chair and more than once opened his eyes to find the man clutching his hand with a pensive look on his face. It was sweet, but also guilt-inducing to the extreme.
The last thing he saw before the elevator doors closed was Captain America looking down at the floor, hands clenched into fists at his side. His jaw was tight with something that looked a lot like disappointment. He didn't even have a sketchbook, Tony realized suddenly. The guy definitely hadn't come up to the common floor to draw - he had wanted company. Before he could call out a second invitation, try to convince him to come along, the door slid shut.
"You arrogant asshole! This has
“He loves you more. A lot more.”
"I love you too." The smile he got for that could have blinded the damn sun. There were also more kisses that made the 'bots break out into their version of a cheer. This time they didn't stop making out until Dum-E grabbed his fire extinguisher and Butterfingers had a welder with U frantically trying to decide which of them to try and stop first. While maybe he was actually a little concerned with the mayhem that was possibly just around the corner mostly Steve was laughing too hard to keep his lips anywhere near Tony's.
It was a different war in a different world, but they were still facing it together. That counted for a hell of a lot. Steve chose to take it as a sign that they would prevail in this conflict too. He just hoped the price wouldn't be as high.
"I don't really need Ms. Potts rescuing me. Even if JARVIS didn't open those doors in an hour, you still wouldn't get nothin' outta me." The twinkle in those blue eyes was just... ugh. Fuck, the guy was smiling, and... and... and
"I can live with that."
A sudden, fierce hug cut off his words. He didn't hesitate before hugging back, pulling Harley in close. Since they were both people who pretended they weren't huggers it didn't last long, but it had probably done them both good. The kid maybe looked a little teary when he pulled away, but he ignored it the same way Harley ignored the way that his own eyes felt a little wet. God, he saw so much of himself in the kid... and even if Alicia would kill him, maybe he'd found someone who could carry on his legacy as Iron Man once he was gone.
Steve knew who belonged to the arm that draped suddenly over his shoulders without needing to look. Winter had gotten better about allowing his combat boots to make a soft 'thud' to accompany his murder strut. Lately he'd been experimenting with beard oils and pomades - because of that he was always surrounded by smells that honestly had Steve wanting to try a few of them out himself. So he didn't crane his neck to look up at his friend, didn't startle or pull away. He leaned into the touch and sighed, face still tipped up towards the stars.
"Thank fuck for that."
He growled and rolled them over, pinning Tony to the bed. His ridiculous, unrepentant lover just grinned up at him. After a moment of the kind of eye contact that made his face flame even hotter, the other man arched his back and pressed up into his body. He couldn't help but shiver, unable to stop his hips from jerking forward. The smirk on Tony's face was begging to be bitten away, so he leaned down and did just that. It wasn't a night for slow, lazy lovemaking. Tony would need something different... and he was very invested in giving his lover
"The next... right. The next dog is going be named Nova, thank you very much. But for her... I like Primrose." Tony bit his lower lip, eyes meeting his fleetingly before going back to Primrose. His shoulders were suddenly hunched up defensively again, and Steve ached to go and wrap him up in a hug. "One of the meanings is 'I can't live without you'."
"I know I am."
He had been losing things since before he was born, and he'd always managed to weather the storm. Most things he could still lose and eventually be okay.
"They oughta be together." Harley's voice was gravel-rough, and his eyes red-rimmed and puffy. Kid had been a rock, but every day that his dads didn't wake up got a little harder on him. He'd been spending most of his time with Winter, who was looking equally ragged at the seams despite his general stoicism. Shellhead and Pepper were among the most visibly inconsolable, while everyone else was just... getting on as best they could, sharing shifts in the infirmary. "We didn't put 'em in the same bed since they were hurt, but if... if they're okay then we... we should..."
"Just leave, Rogers. Take
This is very late, and the only excuse I have is that I'm not used to working full time and having so many other things I have to do in addition to that. It's been a struggle to adjust and it's drained a lot of my will to write. Working to find a better balance, so... fingers crossed!
Memory came back all at once, making him tense and then go boneless on the bed. The Black Order had been defeated, the day and the Infinity Stones saved. Worrying about Thanos could wait just a little longer - just long enough to kick the Defenders back to their own world. What the fuck they'd been thinking was anyone's guess. They'd left their world, well,
(See the end of the chapter for
"No, ya bloodthirsty thing. Gotta see if they'll listen ta sense and clear out on their own. Might still happen. What about it Rogers? Ya gonna walk away with your goons, or are me'n Starlight here gonna escort ya out?"
"No, not as such Captain. But... well. You may wish to... clean up a bit."
The hallway outside was far more tasteful, unfortunately. Tasteful enough that it felt like the home of someone truly wealthy. The rooms that were opened on the way were the same, and it was almost enough to send him on an unpleasant flashback to his childhood home. Maybe Shellhead had struggled with that too, because there was the perfect amount of personality to keep that from happening. Little hints of Iron Man, Lokes and the other Defenders were everywhere, reminding him of

little thread, but there's another one where you decided not to show up and another one where FRIDAY didn't even ask you to meet me and one where I didn't mess everything
Our planet is hardly more than an infant compared to many others out there in the universe. Our weapons have been vastly inferior, we fight amongst ourselves incessantly, our space programs are often disjointed and underfunded. We have almost no real defense against invasion, Mr. Poppleton. Before now Asgard's protection kept us safe from those who would have taken advantage of our weakness to exploit our resources. That is no longer an option. We need to be ready to stand up for ourselves, and that is precisely what Mr. Stark and the others have been working towards. For you to insinuate he is attempting to recreate Ultron is offensive in the extreme.
"He only allows her to call him that, by the way," Loki interjected in a bored tone. To pretend he wasn't involved in the conversation he had involved himself in a game of fetch with the boys, but Steve knew better. "And only when he's trying to flirt his way out of the playroom."
) and Bruce had finally started accepting Tony's stupid nicknames and casual touches. Watching Bruce relax - blossom, even - had given Tony an idea.
about this. You aren't allowed to have sex until you're thirty! At least. For
The compound was never really dark, not when parts of the facility ran 24/7 in an effort to support the New Avengers Initiative. In the aftermath of the battle with the Black Order that was doubly true. Even though it was well into the night, the grounds were still a hive of activity, enough light and noise going on in the courtyard that both trickled through the curtains that were supposed to cancel them out.
"And you should make it all official and shit. So the Avengers stop pesterin' ya to come back and fight. I know ya don't want to and you shouldn't have to. Aunt Pep has got a great handle on SI, and I'm pretty sure she's gonna have Peter working there soon. He'd be a good person to leave SI to when she's ready ta step down."
At first Tony thought that J had opened up the elevator for them so they could get in as soon as they reached the bank. Instead Captain America - perfect, manly, unfairly attractive Captain America - stepped out onto the common floor. His face lit up just a little when he saw them, which Tony was pretty sure was all because of Clint. Clint got along with everyone, and no, Tony wasn't bitter about that
He didn’t wait for an answer and deftly evaded Probably-Nathan’s arm when it shot out to try and stop them. His arm stayed around Tony while he led them away to the bar, hand wrapped around Tony’s hip in a tighter hold than usual. They’d walked like that often, but he had never felt any real intent behind the gesture. Now it felt like Steve was claiming him in front of everyone, and wow did he need to calm the fuck down.
"Like Margaret I am thrilled that you are so happy."
“Not again. No way. Come on - I wanna watch a movie.” Just like that, Nat and Clint were glaring at each other again, because nothing about dinner time could come easily. He guessed that made it even more telling that they all chose to do it anyway.
He was supposed to be the Man With a Plan; it was time to stop mooning and get to work. There wasn't any reason he couldn't try his hand at wooing Tony. It would take a while maybe, because he couldn't do this wrong. If he lost what they had now, if he drove Tony away and they went back to barely speaking... God, that would just kill him. He didn't mind going slow if it meant he got it
Everything she did was beautiful, but he was probably biased since he was her dad and all.
Our insignificance.
Magneto was a son of a bitch and as soon as Tony was released from medical he was going to design a suit that could actually handle the bastard.
"Not for me, Captain." He was sure that JARVIS sounded warmly pleased - he always seemed that way when any Avenger treated him like a person instead of a program. "But Sir does wish to see you in his workshop. Ah..." The AI trailed off, which was not something that happened very often. He always had a ready quip or sarcastic comment to make, had comforting words at the ready. So to have him sound unsure was... kind of worrying.
interrupted gently. "I ain't worried about ya stealin' him if that's what ya think." He shot Steve a thankful look, only to get a smile and a wink in return.
We will not allow it to be enough,
"I mean..." Tony started while J gave an 'of course'. "Prisoner is a harsh term, but I'm afraid I can't let you leave. Not yet anyway."
"Mjolnir," he managed to croak, eyes drifting briefly to Tony's hand before jerking back up. If he drew too much attention to the touching that was going on he was afraid it would stop. "I know ya know it's Mjolnir."
There was no way in hell he was going to explain it either, not when it meant all the touching might stop. He was a glutton for punishment, after all.
"Sounds like you've got it all figured out," he murmured as he watched a drop of condensation roll down the side of the glass. "Didn't need me at all so I don't know why you're suddenly checking in." He was being an ass and he
"My Anthony has been very nearly desolate. You two were so close, and then you were suddenly gone. He may understand the reasoning for it, but it doesn't change the way he feels. And he very much feels abandoned. Your prolonged and completely unnecessary silence did not help matters."
The Titan had brought hordes against them, even more than the Black Order had. The demon dogs were back, along with what chitauri were't laying siege to the rest of Earth. Joining the returning cast was a race that looked like oversized sea cucumbers with terrifying mouths full of teeth that could spit acid several feet. Luckily they were few in number, and mostly being handled by the Iron Legion - the flesh and blood heroes had more pressing matters to handle.
Dum-E and U swung between desperate concern and easy acceptance of the new normal. STAR and Fri had found a way to explain it so it made sense to their brothers. Steve suspected the boys were waiting for someone to come and do either maintenance or an upgrade on their glitching parents. Both of their girls were a Godsend, and he appreciated everything they were doing to help.
"How 'bout I promise that I only get a baby when we both go pick one out?"
"Nah. Just meant to be yours all along even with worlds separatin' us." The sweet words and kiss he got to go along with them didn't fully compute with the way Steve's hands were already working at his clothes. His
"This is going to turn into a circular argument, so how about we don't? How about you just take me at face value?"
In the end maybe it was a little anticlimactic, the way Steve ended up straddling Rogers and delivered punch after vicious punch to the asshole's face... but it still inspired just the smallest bit of enjoyment. Actually, guilt could fuck right off and he would admit that the sight was making him downright giddy with glee.
"This is your home, Steve. You don't have to ask if you can get a pet. Hawkass does, but that's only because he'd try to come home with a tiger or something just to piss me off. The rest of you are allowed all the furry or scaly companions you want." Tony edged a little further into the room, though he stayed with his back against the wall and a gulf between him and the dog. "The vet says she wasn't hurt as badly as she looked."
"You're weird."
"He broke Clint's arm when he called him that. Right now he'll grudgingly answer to Winter, sometimes to James--"
debauchery," Tony muttered, eyes flicking to and away from Captain America's face. "This happened maybe fifteen years ago."
It was nice that her siblings were so protective of her.
There was so much history and love in that well-worn exchange, more than he would ever be able to explain to anyone. From the soft smile on Steve's face and the sweet look in his eyes, he didn't even need to try. His
It still wasn't nice of Clint to laugh and mess up Tony's hair. "Uh-huh. Sure. That's why I'm spanking you so hard. Whatever you say man. Also, if this is you trying to aim repulsers, I've gotta talk to Fury and get you in for some remedial target practice."
"I thought I was years away from needing the Cradle to be Iron Man. Now I need it just to breathe without feeling like I'm drowning. It's not... fuck." He'd known his
As he was savoring the thought of that, he allowed his
"Ha! Not my fault I have a knight in shining armor." Tony turned towards Clint and gave him a light shove - probably because if Clint knocked too hard into Nat she would enter instant kill mode. "It's also not my fault that you don't. It's because he's rude," he added in an aside to Steve.
"Teeth in! I was gonna say teeth in! Jesus fuck." Steve didn't have time to yell at Harley for emulating the way he spoke, so the tiny terror just shot a glare over his shoulder. As soon as he had, Tiny Adorable Steve had braced himself again, an immovable force set in front of them as Natasha headed their way. Not that she got far - Jessica stepped into her path suddenly enough that the assassin hit her and bounced off. Jess just sighed and looked off into the distance, pretending she didn't give a fuck about what was going on.
To the point, if you please.
Steve was reluctant to answer the knock to his door - he had been on the edge of falling asleep in his own bed for the first time in a week. Even at SHIELD medical he had only slept for a handful of minutes at a time, too worried about Tony to find any kind of peace. Now that he was safe and (hopefully) sleeping up in the penthouse, Steve had finally been ready to fall into the sweet embrace of unconsciousness.
Also scary and confusing because he didn't know what it meant. It felt like more than a friend thing, more than even just an Avengers family thing. But was it?
"Fuck. We talked about your idea of 'drastic action' and I thought we agreed that we were gonna put the kibosh on that until you were old enough to be held liable for your own messes?"
"We were agreeing to be bound by the decision. I know, you said. But--"
"Yes ma'am." His Tiny Adorable Steve sounded... strange. Echoey somehow? But also closer than anyone else, and something... something was happening...
"Sweetheart. I love ya more'n anythin' and I've got your back no matter what ya decide, but..." A crooked little smile and tense shrug of one shoulder didn't offset the quiet fury clear in those blue eyes. "I'm sorta with Pep here."
Rhodey was just going to be disappointed and upset that Tony himself didn't worthy enough to be leading the team, not with the job itself.
you don't even have one for MIT? You'd be a legacy, kid, and I know Peter's there too but it isn't like you guys are still fighting all the time. ... actually, I don't recognize any of these schools. Harley. Why aren't you angling for any of the big names?"
It was over. They were still standing, all the Infinity Stones on Earth were safe, and they had
"Bets on if it's Shellhead or Peggy through the portal first."
they would show up now. Of course. Rogers and Natasha especially seemed to have a sixth sense about when he was at his most vulnerable so they could come and rip at those squishy parts of him. Since they were coming to 'save' him he figured he'd be lucky not to end up dead.
“J? Why was he in my vents?” The finger that smooshed against his lips made the last word come out all funny. He snickered only to have Clint herd him toward the couch and push him down onto it. It was… weird and kind of… great? Yeah. Weird and great to have someone worried about him. He should go ahead and tell the archer that he was mostly just still trying to switch gears, not enveloped in a ‘been awake and sciencing for way too long’ fog.
"Morning Steve. Do you want some tea?"
life being so split in two.
"I will turn this car around."
This chapter might be a little under-edited, but I wanted to get it up and I'm working a lot this next week.
"I'm not going to waste my time arguing with some clone created by magic, one that's taking advantage of him like this. Tony--" When Rogers tried to step forward, probably looking to pin him down behind the bar where he couldn't escape, Steve reached up and put a hand on his chest. Maybe he'd seen the way Tony had flinched or maybe he just knew that the thought of being any closer to Rogers made panic rise in his chest and set his newly strengthened heart to racing. "You don't wanna do this son. Let me through before I get to figuring out just how much punishment one of Loki's clones can take."
“Sounds like a plan.” Steve let him go, but he only had a second to mourn the loss before a large hand settled on his lower back. Again with the couple-y stuff, and again with the impression that maybe - just maybe - he was the one being wooed.
~.~.~
This is... very late, and I am very sorry for that!! Hope it's at least good enough that you won't be super salty over the wait.
"Your brain didn't concoct anythin', ya idiot. Why won't ya--"
He paused and gave that question the thought it deserved. Part of him wanted nothing more than to put on his Iron Man suit and wade into things. He'd love to pound Rogers into the pavement, wanted to rip apart Falcon's wings and remind the Widow why she never should have crossed him. It would feel so fucking good to tear into them, show them just how much he'd been holding back in Siberia out of that nagging, relentless, misplaced sense of loyalty and friendship... but the world was going to need them.
"We're here to save you Tony. Why didn't you... I know we had our disagreements, but why didn't you tell me you were in trouble? I sent you that phone for a reason."
He couldn't hear what they were saying, but it looked like there was a short, passionate argument that glaive guy won. Spear chick nodded, looking up at glaive guy like he was her world, and it was almost enough to make him feel bad. Then he looked over to where Rescue was slowly climbing to her feet and that bit of empathy was lost.
His lips twitched in relief and amusement as he stalked towards spear chick. Captain Marvel had the shoulder that hadn't been burned to a crisp in one hand, other fist hammering at the chick repeatedly. Glaive guy was almost free, and fuck he hoped this gamble had worked... especially after seeing Black Panther, Okoye and the rest of the Dora Milaje in a tight ring around a downed Rescue. Pep wasn't hurt too badly or he would have been told, but he still wanted to kill anything that tried to take advantage of her moment of weakness.
like Doreen was living in a group home or foster situation. If they could talk to the woman who'd been charged with taking care of her, they could get a better idea of just what had caused Doreen to be there in the first place. It would also keep them from being charged with kidnapping if they did it all as close to the legal way as possible, so he was all for it.
"Did you... did you move yourself and your family into my tower?" Tony looked like he was completely torn between pride and outrage, and it hit Steve's funny bone just the right way. He started to laugh, and at first he could hide the quiet chuckles in his fella's hair. The longer he thought about it though, about how it was just the sort of thing the man himself would do, the louder he got. Soon he had to pull away so he didn't jostle Tony too much. It was the kind of laugh that started deep inside and just sort of rolled outward until he was clutching his stomach and fighting to breathe.
Christ, he wished he could have brought STAR to lighten the mood.
"Not if we're gonna talk about it first."
Thanks so much for sticking with me to the end! I've appreciated all the comments and kudos more than you can know.
This chapter was hard because I'm mostly laying the foundations for what's coming, so I feel like nothing really happened. XD I promise more plot and such in the next chapters to come!
"I don't need it either. B'sides, everythin' in there is--"
Again, imagine the most amazing Brooklyn accent saying those words.
"And you started with me?" he demanded, though it didn't come out as forcefully as he would have liked. "Fucking Christ, kid. I don't know if I'm about to have a heart attack or a panic attack. Fuck."
be enough... but maybe they had the chance to be more too. Either was fine, because Tony was finally calling him
"I guess not. This is still--"
I was made to believe I had little choice in the matter, Mr. Poppleton. Please sit down.
"Hey," the Captain greeted softly, awkward and handsome in a way only he seemed to be able to manage. "JARVIS said you guys were up here."
"Dunno how much more I can help ya shut that brain-a yours up without gettin' ya undressed," his lover teased, a glint in his eyes and a blush on his cheeks. God, part of him couldn't believe the man still blushed and he couldn't help but be delighted every time he saw it. "Could prob'ly get your pants off quick enough ta make ya blue screen before Dr. Cho comes in though."
"Steve is--"
"Sweetheart?"
By wordless agreement they bypassed the living room and kitchen entirely to head right to the bedroom. He even shut the door behind them which almost never happened unless they were planning on being intimate. It was just that he didn't want the boys to interrupt this conversation no matter how much he loved them, and now STAR and Fri would respect that privacy too unless there was an emergency.
. Mostly they have given me old sniper rifles so far." From the look on his face, Winter found that fact deeply unsatisfactory. Steve didn't blame him, not with the advanced weaponry the other Defenders were carting around.
"You can take the boys with you, when you go." That threw him for such a loop that he couldn't even
Thanks for sticking with it! Comments are appreciated and loved even when I don't have the social energy to reply to them. <3
"Huh. So are there like, parallel worlds or something? Because it's not really my area but Ned - he's my best friend even if I didn't tell him about, you know, the... uh..." Blushing again, the kid, mimed shooting the webs Steve had seen in footage of him, keeping the gesture more subtle than he would have given the teen credit for. "He doesn't know. No one does."
The question is why you believe they won't.
"The 'flowery herbal crap' is more relaxing, you know."
like he knew Tony would have seen that and found it hot.
It would run like a dream and be perfectly suited to the way he drove, Steve knew that much. If Tony had started and stopped several times he couldn't imagine how long he'd been working on the thing. So much work, sweat and probably even blood had gone into it, and he had started it even before he'd known how dizzy Steve was over him. He worked so hard, cared so deeply... and God he loved the man so much.
"They have souls, your creations. I have seen nothing like it before, not even on Nidavellir or Alfheim. Perhaps if their peoples worked together they could come close, but I doubt it. Your little robots are unique in all the Realms, I think, in this Universe or mine."
Sooooooo. Not as plotty as I had intended, but I wanted to get Peter in there and then end with a kind of cliff hanger, so. :'D
"He's... overbearin', that's for sure. Does seem ta care about Bucky, just doesn't seem ta understand that what he's doin' ain't workin'. Puttin' Bucky in the same team as him was probably a mistake, but I think Carol and Rhodey just didn't know what else ta do. Bucky asked for it'n nobody else really wanted him. It's sad."
"Pettiness?"
Time would return to its own Stonekeeper, while Space would wander where it willed. Power and Reality were less predictable. Soul was unsure of where they would choose to rest now that the choice was theirs again. Mind would, no doubt, stay with the Stonekeeper it had helped breathe life into. It was hard to leave a being once a Stone had claimed it; Soul managed to separate from the little Mechanic only because he would be miserable if forced to leave his world and his family forever. No doubt he would find a way to build himself an escape route, and while Soul would enjoy seeing him try, there was no need to put him through that.
"You're still grounded if'n ya say that again. I'll talk ta your ma about it, ya see if I don't. Shouldn't be usin' such language durin' official Avengers business."
The noise cut as soon as he rapped his knuckles against the door. When it was flung open by a frazzled Harley, he knew his guess had been correct. "Next time put 'Carry on My Wayward Son' on," he advised while ruffling the teen's hair. "Sounds enough like his stuff in spots that it's a good compromise."
Tony didn't let JARVIS interrupt his concentration, just kept right on working. His AI was probably just going to tell him something he already knew - like how it had been two days since he'd slept in a bed or that he was an hour overdue for a smoothie fix. None of it mattered as much as the numbers coming together in beautiful symmetry under his fingers. Math taking physical shape was probably the sexiest thing in existence. Why more young people weren't interested in engineering - which also included a gorgeous infusion of science - he didn't know. Probably their education was lacking. He should look into making more donations to STEM programs…
and that
But... Ms. Potts-- [pause] I suppose I can understand why you believe my intentions weren't very noble. I can also see the merit in your suggestion. I'll have my office call and set up another appointment. Will next week work for you?
"Nah. It's... it's fine. I'm just bein'... I dunno. But it's fine. I'm fine."
The Avengers were still in trouble - the demon-dogs were a pain in the fucking ass even if the seemed more mindless than anything. Maybe they weren't going after the Infinity Stones but they
A huge reason for that had shifted to stand in front of him, Tiny But Fierce like so many Avengers and Defenders were. Steve was resolute in his mission to keep any of them from so much as looking at him funny. He had a feeling there would be broken bones if any of them actually tried to approach him.
"The other Avengers wish you to know that they are... ah. Deliriously happy that the pair of you have gotten your heads out of your asses is how it was put to me by Master Clint. Mr. Rhodes wanted me to inform you that he will be stopping by in two weeks to help you both celebrate properly. Miss Potts--"
He hated the parties even more than Tony did. They turned him back into the stiff, awkward man who had first come out of the ice. People were always crowding too close or asking questions that were way too personal. Tony always tried to make sure there were a few World War Two vets floating around in the crowd. Steve would latch on to them in between fetching Tony his drinks and food, and it would keep some of the more offensive party goers off his back.
"Why not? Also, butt out Winghead. Anyway. I'm thinking that instead of giving it to lame-o here who can't even get a dick punch right... I think I'll give it to you." With a flourish, Shellhead began to pull something out of that small pouch; whatever it was it got bigger the farther he pulled it out. When it was finally all the way out, Steve realized that he was looking at the back of his shield and felt his breath catch in his throat. Tony didn't recognize it as quickly, but once Shellhead turned it around his lover went pale and recoiled back in his seat.
Throw baseless accusations while hiding behind the concerns of others?
"I know. But you get the cutest little crinkle around your eyes when you don't know if you're irritated or amused by me."
Also will be getting back to the schedule that I promised. So there'll be a chapter every week on Sunday until I finally wrap this up.
No matter what one Miss Pepper Potts thought.
"I love
Harley started laughing a beat after he did, probably at the mortified look on Tony's face. Soon enough even the genius succumbed however, until they were one laughing, hugging, crying mess. Of course his fella only laughed for as long as his broken-up body would let him. Then he descended into coughs and moans of pain, sending up enough red flags that Dum-E, U and STAR burst through the door in their usual dramatic fashion to check on him.
“I have a craving.”
So I sat down and plotted out the rest of the story in an outline, and I think I have a complete handle on how the rest of the chapters need to go. Yay! So the end is in sight, and it looooooks like there'll be 11 chapters in total, possibly twelve. So we're halfway done, and I should be able to take us there soon!
"Tony…" the first hint of frustration crept into Tiny Adorable Steve's voice, and fuck but he missed that. "What can I do ta help ya believe I'm real?"
The way Tony Stark seemed to just... just
"If you're not really here, I reserve the right to get very, very drunk later. Concerningly drunk."
“... a two Sir.”
Their bodies had been giving off the kind of heat that killed men instantly, and even Carol found it impossible to come within more than a foot of either of them. It had been an agonizing hour waiting for the heat to fade, watching their chests barely move up and down. Both of them were bleeding from the nose and ears, sluggish trails of accusing red that he couldn't do a damn thing to stop. He'd held a weeping Pepper and Peter, taking in the patches of burned and blistered skin as both Lokis and Strange had thrown spell after spell at the pair, trying to cool them down, or break through it enough to heal them, or do
For a long moment there was only silence between them. Tony had known Steve was upset, but he hadn't realized… fuck. He'd lost so much - everything, actually - so it was no wonder he was shaken. He just wish he'd realized it before he'd gone and put his foot in his mouth. Steve deserved good things. All the good things, which included friends who knew when to stop joking and just be normal. Jesus fuck, he was the worst.
a tight hug and let a comforting silence fall between them.
"Steve? I'm serious. We aren't turning into a home for peculiar children."
"Why don't ya have any-a those fancy private nurses?"
His Tiny Adorable Steve was busy with Natalia and Peggy fighting the enraged glaive guy; spear girl was nowhere to be seen, which, well. Was probably fueling his rage. Though he tried not to get too distracted by that smaller-scale skirmish, it was
"He isn't a
“You can’t kill Rogers,” was what finally made it out of his mouth. “I know something is coming, something big, and Earth will nee-"
Steve took a deep breath, trying to ground himself before telling the others. They deserved to know, even if Steve would rather do anything other than talk about what he'd just discovered.
"But school?" Tony questioned. Nat waved away his worry.
Peter felt a bit of guilt building up inside. He had a hunch what it was about.
"What?"
Natasha was the first to notice him, smiling as she met his eyes. Her eyes darted towards the three on the couch, her smile soft. She softly cleared her throat and Steve's head shot up from his hand, relaxing when he saw Nat. He gave a small smile back, greeting Peter with a nod. Tony stirred slightly, brow furrowing as the movement of Steve's hand in his hair stopped. Steve quickly continued, smiling as the body on the couch went limp again.
"Whatever it takes to make amends, Tony." Tony blinked back up at him through his long lashes, nodding softly. Clint clapped in his hands, breaking the intimate atmosphere.
"...and this is the communal area," Peter finished, finally done with his tour. None of it struck Tony as familiar, but he wasn't too worried. Especially when Steve was holding him protectively by his side like that.
After homeroom ended, Steve spotted the new kid standing by the wall, staring at his schedule with a frown, clearly confused. No one seemed to be willing to help him, and when the boy looked around with slightly panicked eyes, it didn't seem like he could ask for help, either. Quickly, Steve approached him.
Tony snorted.
"Yes, Tony. We're really good friends."
"Ciao, Zia Peggy," Tony greeted back. Peggy tutted and held up her hand.
"Not for long. Hey, Betty," Bruce called. The girl finally looked up. When she saw Bruce, she quickly straightened her hair and clothes.
"It's nothing," he said, slightly embarrassed. Languages had never been very hard for him, no one had really praised him for it, except for the Jarvis couple.
"So you say you feel happy, and butterflies?" Tony asked after a little silence.
Steve smiled back, glad to hear his friend was okay.
"Yeah, kid. That's a sì."
"Hi," Steve greeted back hastily. "Look, I'm very sorry to intrude like this, but I'm getting a bit concerned. I'm hearing a lot of noise from my apartment and I'm just wondering if everything's okay here?" He ended it like a question, hoping Tony got the message he was trying to convey.
Tony nodded, looking back down at his hands. Steve pulled him in for a hug, relaxing when he felt Tony lean into him.
"-just saying, if you keep this up..."
"Sì." Tony nodded. "Lot of
"Molto impressionante," Nat, who spoke a couple of languages herself, translated for him. Tony blushed and ducked his head down.
"So does Clint."
"Luf you, Steve."
The only thing that had been able to calm her down enough to think straight again, were his abilities. His amazing reflexes, his so-called 'spidey sense', his fast healing- it kept him safe from the worst. Of course, she had been
To Steve's concern, that barely got a smile out of Tony. Steve then decided that it had been enough.
"I'll be in the living room if you want to talk," he said softly through the closed door. He waited a few more minutes before turning around and walking away.
"Oh," Tony said intelligently. He yawned, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes with his one good hand.
"Well, well, well." One of the boys spoke. "Look who it is. It's the Italian freak." The boys behind him laughed, but Tony didn't get the joke. He didn't dare ask, knowing better than to talk back. But even though he listened to his survival instincts and kept his eyes downcast, he still received a punch in the face, hard enough to knock him down. His world spun and he groaned softly, quickly getting back up because he knew to lie down was a fatal position.
"Right. Now, kiss, you idiots," he exclaimed, hauling him and Tony off the floor and pushing the smaller man into Steve, who caught him easily. Tony smirked and kissed the tip of Steve's nose before lowering down to his lips. Steve happily kissed him back, his hands on Tony's waist.
"Mr. Parker, if you don't mind I would like to start, now." Their Spanish teacher called from the front of the class. Peter's mouth clicked shut and the teacher started class. He explained what Peter had told Tony before; their class was a mix of different years to create one big group instead of several small ones. Then he explained their assignment.
"True."
"It's alright, I've got him. He'll be okay now," he assured them. Hesitantly, the two left, leaving them alone in the room. Steve turned back to Tony with a gentle expression, trying not to show how much Tony's screams had scared him. "Let's get you back to bed, alright?" He told him softly. Tony nodded dazedly, allowing Steve to pull him up and lead him back to the bed. Much to Tony's relief, Steve climbed in beside him, holding him close.
"Tony..." he croaked, his voice breaking on the name. "Tony, please. Please, look at me. You're scaring me, baby. Please, Tony,
"H-hi," he said softly.
Tony whined, hiding his face in his knees as he fisted his hair. It hurt his casted hand, but he didn't pay it any mind. He just wanted the voices to stop.
Suddenly, he felt two hesitant arms wrap around him, a warm weight leaning against his front. Peter wasn't tall by any means, but Tony was just slightly smaller than him, causing his brown curls to tickle his nose from where Tony's head rested lightly on his shoulder. Peter automatically brought his arms up to hug the younger boy back, feeling his heart cease its attempt to beat itself out of his chest.
Peter burst through the doors that kept his mentor's workshop hidden, rambling happily.
Tony didn't forget about it. When he woke up the next morning, sunlight streaming from behind his curtains and feeling relatively well-rested, all things considered, he recalled the events from last night. He smiled softly when he remembered his friends' support, how they didn't do any of the horrible things Tony had believed they would. They stayed with him, even promised to protect him...
"I see," was all he said, the lack of judgment in his voice momentarily shocking Tony, who was deeply disappointed in himself for not only letting himself be pushed around but also
"Yeah. Must've been the wind."
"Excuse me?" JARVIS said, sounding as confused as an AI could be.
sorry?" Peter huffed indignantly. "
to pick on him. Why couldn't the world just leave him alone? Did he really deserve to be treated like this?
He watched as Tony walked out, posture tense and chin up. But once he entered his own room, his shoulders slumped, his entire composure collapsing and showing a tired, vulnerable man who'd just had his biggest insecurity thrown in his face by someone he trusted more than anyone else. Clint felt the sympathy rise in his chest at the poor sight the billionaire made, curled into himself with this back against the bed, staring at the framed photograph of him and Steve, gazing in each other's eyes and looking completely in love.
"I can drive him," Steve offered immediately. He still felt guilty for not noticing Tony's absence earlier. Tony was always so on time for their shared classes, he should've checked it out sooner. He wanted to do what he could to help.
What had he
new year's update :)
Peter's mouth fell open, Clint laughed, and Nat just seemed to approve.
"Are you a first-year? Cuz I am. It's kinda weird because I'm in a class with, like sophomores and juniors because the Spanish class was so small in each year they actually had to blend it together-- which, of course, you knew already because you're in this class, too. I'm sorry, I'm rambling. I do that sometimes. Aunt May calls it a word-vomit, but I think that sounds gross so I don't call it that. I'm Peter, by the way. What's your name?"
Tony nodded and jumped up from his space between Steve and Bucky to help Bruce prepare for dinner. He seemed happy to help, but when Bruce held out a plate for him to take, he froze.
"I'm pathetic," Tony murmured, and Steve almost flinched at the hate and defeat in Tony's voice. "A little flu and suddenly my hands are shaking, my head hurt too much to think, my breathing is heavy, and I can't stay upright for more than a few minutes before my knees buckle."
in the ceiling, by the way) alerts you of a dangerous villain that's attacking the city? Well, that's exactly what happened to Peter.
"Um, I not have... I not have dorm," Tony said softly. Bruce smiled kindly.
"Steve, what really happened?" Nat asked, perceptive as always.
Several people stood outside Tony's room, mostly doctors and medical people. He spotted May Parker with a tear-stricken Peter waiting outside the closed door. May spotted him, waving him over with a sad smile.
Basically Tony and Steve being cute and Peter being an oblivious, overprotective son
The weird feeling usually came whenever he was around Tony. So, in order to make it go away, Steve stayed away from Tony.
"Jeez, you alright, Tones?" Steve laughed, helpfully patting the coughing genius on the back.
"Leave it," Tony's voice shouted from the halls. Peter made a 'sorry' motion towards the spilled coffee before speeding off after his mentor.
He slowly moved over to his friend, exaggerating his movements so Tony wouldn't get startled, speaking softly to him.
"Sorry," Steve apologized softly to Peter, who had just been staring at them. "He's on meds, doctor's orders, so he's a bit less active than usual." Peter shook his head.
idea how
@MarvelBishes has a Stony one-shot collection (Marvellous One Shots) and a side-fic that I am writing (Avengers High)
. He breathed deeply through his nose, trying to keep his emotions in check.
"Can I help?" He tried again, knowing the answer before it came.
And it was nice how people made an effort to have him be remembered. But it wouldn't bring him back. Tony Stark was dead. He would remain dead, no matter how much people wanted that to change. No matter how much
"Good?" he asked, his voice small.
"Thanks, learned from the best," Peter shrugged. For some reason, that only made Tony's shoulders slump more. "I'm sorry, did I say something wrong?" He asked, immediately worried.
"Alright, um," he thought for a second. He seemed to have thought of something as the tips of his ears turned pink and he scratched his neck (which Tony didn't find attractive. At all). "I guess my most embarrassing moment must have been when I told my crush I liked him,"
Steve sighed but caved.
"Hello," the woman behind the desk smiled kindly. "What can I do for you?"
Tony felt the telltale burn of tears in his eyes. He balled his fists, refusing to let the tears fall.
"Why is it always so complicated??" He whined.
"I hate you," Tony mumbled. The soldier chuckled, walking up to the genius again.
"Okay, if that's how it is," he said, hating the way his voice cracked. Steve didn't look the slightest bit remorseful, his entire posture radiating fury. "Guess you'll no longer have to worry about me."
He looked well, giving them all a smile as he walked in one morning during breakfast.
Steve waited, biting his lip against the overwhelming feeling of despair flooding through him.
"Hey, has anyone seen Tony yet?" Bruce asked the next morning when he walked into the living room. Everyone shook their heads and Bruce frowned. "Is he not coming to school today?"
Cap drew a card, sports, for Clint. Clint drew one for Tony about animals ("Never have I ever kicked an animal" "Clint, no.") and Tony had one for Nat, who, on her turn had one for Peter.
Have a great day and a happy new year!!
The rest of the day was spent looking at pictures. Tony was proud to say he recognized some, reveling in the way Steve seemed so proud of him. Tony met his robots (he'd made robots. Actual. Robots.) and his workshop, which had left him weak in the knees. He didn't remember loving science but
"Well, important... Stuff..." Tony replied, groaning at how stupid that sounded. "Just let go, please,"
Troppo forte: too loud
"Hey, Steve!"
Tony's thoughts were cut short when his shoulder made harsh contact with the wall. He blinked dazedly, trying to figure out what happened. He heard laughing on his left and looked over to see a few boys walking towards him, grinning evilly. Tony's heart sank at the looks in their eyes. He knew that look. He'd grown used to it in the past few months while living with his father. He curled into himself
"FRIDAY, where's Mr. Stark?" he asked the AI, his voice sounding loud in the unusually empty room.
"Promise," Steve assured him. Tony nodded, deeming it good enough before moving to clumsily remove his sweater. Once he'd pulled it over his head, Steve froze.
"Hey," a boy, seemingly a few years older than him, said. "I saw you with Steve and Nat earlier today. You're Tony, right?"
"No, no!" Steve interrupted before the genius could continue. "It really wasn't that bad..."
"I'm going to touch you now, okay?" Steve let him know, not wanting him to be scared as he gently reached out and took Tony's shaking hand. He gently put it on his own chest, just over his heart. "Just copy my breathing, okay? Just focus on that."
"Is that all you have?" Steve asked as he peeked in as well. Tony nodded, walking into his room and beginning to unpack. There were only a few bags, one with a few clothes, one with a bedspread and a pillow, and a small one with his personal belongings. He took out a picture frame of him with a man and a woman, smiling happily. Tony smiled at it before putting it on the small bedside table. He took out a couple more; one of him with Peggy Carter, one of his mother sitting behind a piano and giving a rare, genuine smile. Tony carefully and delicately placed them where he wanted them, smiling softly at his work. Steve watched him with a soft smile and quietly exited the room to leave the boy to it.
bad but I woke up this morning and she wasn't there and then she started acting out and I'm just-"
"Well, I gotta be honest with you. When you walked in, I genuinely thought you were my son." He deadpanned. Peter almost choked on his next breath, his eyes widening in shock.
"Don't lose those. Good luck." And with that, Coulson left and Tony was left alone in the hall. With slightly shaking hands he put the keys in the lock and twisted.
"FRIDAY, are they still in the lab?" Steve asked, looking up at the ceiling, no matter how many times Tony had told him:
"Hello, Tonio. My name is Phil Coulson, I'm going to show you your dorm."
"I care about this work as much as you do,
The pure determination and honesty in Steve's voice had Tony relax against him, tears running silently down his face. They stayed like that for a while, both not really sure what to say. Tony had already lost so many people, and he'd ended up in a worse place for it. He was silently glad they'd found each other. Tony was safe here, safe from his father, from the bad memories haunting him, safe with people who genuinely cared about him.
"I talked to someone about it," Bruce continued. "And they helped me to keep it under control."
"Mr. Stark?" The young Spiderling asked softly, tears soaking his mask. Tony slowly blinked his eyes open, staring up into the sky with wet, brown eyes. Steve gently shook his shoulder, softly talking to him to gain his attention. It worked as the genius turned his head ever so slightly, his glassy eyes staring up at him.
And two, Tony Stark had been in surgery.
"Don't fall asleep, please Tony, stay awake. Spider-Man, please guide the paramedics here?"
file. Clint, as much as he feared his friend, had sat down with her once he'd found out about that. Tony was more than qualified for this job. Besides, he and Iron Man were the same, he'd made that clear.
"Those stupid fanboys all the time," he mumbled, before yelling out the window; "Yo Parker, ya left ya bag!"
ass out of trouble."
"Call in reinforcements." She met Steve's gaze head-on. "It's time to call in James Rhodes."
Their first period was homeroom, and Steve didn't really know what he was supposed to do. He settled for doodling in his notebook. As usual, he and his friends were early but soon enough the rest of their class started streaming in.
"But people think I'm dumb!" Tony yelled, fresh tears streaming down his face. "I am not dumb. I am
"He didn't sit with you because he thinks you hate
Peter comes back the next morning to have an awesome day with his favorite genius superhero in the lab
"Oh, Tony," he mumbled as he walked over to his friend, giving him no chance to walk away as he put his arm on Tony's back, the other hand cupping the back of the genius's head. Tony could do nothing but let his head drop against Steve's chest, sighing in defeat.
"'s that the lil' squirt?" Another familiar voice called. Tony reluctantly let go of Steve to see Bucky smirking at him. He gave a shy wave, relieved to see him too.
'spaventoso: scary
"Very cool, Peter," FRIDAY said fondly. FRIDAY might have been an AI, but she was not emotionless. And she too had grown fond of the excited teenager. At first, it was mostly because he seemed to make her creator happy, pulling him from his workshop binges and spiraling thoughts. But she quickly realized that he simply made everyone's hearts warm, even her own, mechanical one.
A soft knock on his door pulled him out of his musings. He sighed.
"You'd be surprised," a groggy voice entered the conversation. "I feel even
If you're still sticking with this story so far, feel free to say hi! If you have anything, literally
"A dorm is where you live when you're not in school. You have your own room, and you share your kitchen and living room with four other kids in your dorm. Don't worry, everyone has switched dorms since last year so you're not the only one who has to adjust."
It's a little short but I slept in and basically half of my day was gone so it's a little one for now. Enjoy!
"What is it?" Tony asked excitedly. An excited mood always seemed to rub off on him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You don't know Never Have I Ever? Dude, you missed out!" Clint broke the silence. His words earned him a slap up the head from Natasha, who had somehow reached him.
As they went further into the cafeteria, Tony got more and more tense under the hand Steve held on his back. Kids were yelling and running around and Tony's gaze kept shooting towards the loudest noise. At a particularly loud yell, Tony flinched so hard he would've fallen on the ground if Steve hadn't caught him.
"Ana, sweetie, where are you?" He called again, trying not to let panic overtake him. But the longer he searched with no results, the more pressing his anxiety seemed to get. "Ana, please," he pleaded, supporting himself on the couch as his legs suddenly felt weak. His breathing picked up into an erratic rhythm. He knew he was overthinking this, but it was early, he wasn't really awake yet and the fear of that came with losing the one steady presence in his life chased away all sensible thoughts as panic overtook him. He slid down the back of the couch, trying to focus on his breathing. But the room was spinning and the air seemed too big to fit in his lungs as he gasped like a fish on land.
With that she got up and slipped out of the room, leaving Steve alone with his thoughts once again. Steve just stared at his hands for a while, mulling over Natasha's words. She was right, as always. He should talk to Tony, tell him he wasn't mad, nothing would change between them, comfort him-
"Oh, I don't know if that was here. I mean, I didn't hear anything. It's probably some other neighbors, or just your ears playing tricks on you," he joked, chuckling slightly. "Thanks for caring, though. That's... that's very nice of you to do. I mean, you didn't have to come all the way up here-"
Hola, mi nombre es Peter Parker. ¿Quién eres tú?: Hello, my name is Peter Parker. Who are you? (Spanish)
, his head resting on the blond's shoulder. His fingers didn't stop as he relaxed in Steve's hold. He seemed to do it with such ease, Steve couldn't resist a chuckle. Tony smiled too, turning his head into Steve's shoulder but not stopping his motion on the keys.
(See the end of the chapter for
"The boy has no idea, does he?" She asked the super soldier, who shook his head.
"Tony, does your dad hit you?"
It was only when he realized Tony was hyperventilating that he got in action.
"Let's leave him to rest, now," he told them, and soon it was just Steve and Tony again. They kept watching various Disney movies, although Steve wasn't sure how much attention Tony was paying to them. He didn't seem eager to talk, content to just lay against Steve's side. After what felt like way too long, Tony finally drifted off to the sound of Elsa singing in the background. Steve smiled softly at his sleeping form before shooting Bruce a text to meet him in fifteen minutes with the others. He carefully lifted Tony into his arms, feeling an oddly warm feeling in his stomach when Tony curled up against him.
"Well, what did you expect?" Now it was Peter's turn to sound confused.
"I'm here, Tony," Steve continued to talk to him to help him stay awake. "I'm right here and I'm not going to leave, alright? I'll stay with you the whole time, I promise. You're getting out of this alive. We all are, got that? All of us,"
"That's good!" Tony smiled. Bruce chuckled.
With that, she marched out.
Instead of letting go, Steve tightened his grip around the small man's frame, making Tony yelp again.
"Right, I forgot you're not English. I meant, can I sit next to you?" He tried again, slower this time. Tony looked at the occupied seat next to him and back to Bruce.
"I don't know what to do, Nat," he confessed.
Steve kept walking, ignoring Tony's cheerful voice behind him.
"Me too, honey," he sighed contently. "Me too."
"We understand you just fine. We're so proud that you made so much progress, but we don't want you to turn into someone you're not, okay? We like you the way you are."
"Is good," he praised once he'd finished his first pancake.
After a few minutes, the man sniffed, sitting back up and stroking his dog's head in thanks.
"Oh," Tony said softly. "I-I did not know. Sorry."
May didn't even know how he had come up with that but left the teenager to freak out in peace, walking down the stairs to make them some food before he would be picked up. She was happy with the way things had turned out, she just wished Ben had been here to see it. She wasn't a big fan of Stark at first, interrupting their little lives. It had been hard for her to get around well enough to feed all of them, especially when Ben died. So when Tony Stark had come barging in with all his flair wasn't really what she had been looking for. The only reason she didn't ask him politely to leave, was because he seemed to make Peter happy. And a happy Peter was a happy May.
"Who told you?" Tony cut it, looking up again, his strict face back on. Peter began to get nervous under the heavy gaze of his mentor. He knew he'd said too much, but he couldn't take it back now.
"Perfect, thanks," Tony answered with a smile. "Steve, we're downstairs. Don't break another extinguisher if you can, alright?" He told the blonde man who was seated on another couch, dropping the newspaper on his head as he walked past.
"Ah, got some fire in you, eh?" The tall, skinny boy at the front spoke again, irritation sparking in his eyes. He made a movement with his hand that Tony's spinning vision couldn't identify, and before he knew it his feet were off the ground.
"Steve, let me down," he said, attempting to break free but failing miserably. Steve brought his face to Tony's neck with a big grin.
Without waiting for a response the teenager was out the door again, heading off to who-knows-where. Tony mumbled a quick 'finally' towards the ceiling and threw the covers back to sit up straight. Steve was next to him in no time to support him.
"Friends and family of Tony Stark?" He asked softly, eyeing the three with sympathy. Steve practically leaped off his chair. "You can come see him now. Although, before you do," he stopped them. "I have to warn you. The blow Mr. Stark received has resulted in PTA, post-traumatic amnesia. It'll be temporary, I expect him to regain most of his memories in the next month or two, but be careful with it. He currently doesn't know much."
"Let's try this again, shall we?" He smiled. "Now, if I remember correctly, we were working on those new web shooters of yours,"
(See the end of the chapter for
"You need some help with that?" Steve asked gently, trying to let him know he wasn't going to do anything bad. The boy gave him a confused look, so Steve patiently pointed at the paper. "Help?"
Steve blew some air out of his cheeks as he stared up at the ceiling from his position on the floor. He could feel the cold concrete digging in his back uncomfortably, but he didn't move. He could hear some noises from upstairs, more glass shattering and raised voices. Steve's gaze intensified, looking at the ceiling as if he could see right through it.
"Okay, that's quite enough of that," Clint said after only a few seconds, pulling the two apart. "I'm still mad at you, Rogers. You have to earn Tony Time."
"You wouldn't happen to give me his name, by any chance?" She questioned. As far as she knew, Tony didn't have any friends besides them in America. Tony clicked Hulk's leash on his collar, petting his head as he made towards the door.
The shocked silence that followed was deafening.
Natasha grinned, a plan already forming in her head.
"Nope," he said, popping the p. "No can do. You see, I have a kid coming over-" he paused for a moment, then pointed to where Peter was glancing around the corner. "I have a kid waiting there and I promised him we'd go in the main lab for once. And when I promise something, I, for one, actually do it. Suck it, Howard."
A single tear slipped from his eye, but Nat was quick to wipe it away.
"Tony, that's way too much," he said softly, running his hands soothingly through Tony's hair in the way he knew the billionaire liked. "I think the stress is getting a bit too much for you, Tony. Your body can't take it all."
I don't know how to express how grateful I am for the support on this silly little story. You all made me so incredibly happy this year reading all your comments, they really meant so much to me. Stay safe, and I'll see you all next year ;) <3000
Ungherese: Hungarian
"Do you have food with you?"
"Whatcha making?" Sam asked, gesturing to Steve's paper. Steve removed his hand so that his friend could see what he'd made. "Okay, I still don't really know what that is."
Tony looked down at his fidgeting hands and didn't answer.
"Hola," Peter said. "Mi nombre es Peter Parker. ¿Quién eres tú?"
"Ana?" Tony called softly, his voice dry from his earlier episode. "Are you okay, girl?"
Tony hesitantly pushed the door open to reveal a living area, small enough to be cozy but spacious enough to fit all occupants and some friends. He could see a hallway leading to a kitchen and five doors, four of which were opened. Tony could hear people talking and laughing. He swallowed hard, anxiety weighing heavily in his stomach. He knew not everyone was going to be as kind as the people he'd met earlier today, especially since he was technically too young to be a junior.
Happy just shook this head, mumbled something under his breath and drove the car around. He had already forgotten about the boy before he had even disappeared out of sight.
Steve was an idiot and has to make it up to our boi. Sometime soon, preferably.
Yeah, that was probably it. There was definitely no other reason for his stomach to flip like that whenever Tony smiled. Just bad food.
He didn't know what to do. Tony had told him he loved him, but Steve was sure he didn't feel the same way. But now Tony probably hated him, even though Steve had told him nothing would change. But Steve didn't want to lose him. He was his friend, even if he didn't reciprocate Tony's love. But he couldn't do anything about that. And now he was going to lose one of his best friends...
"Hey, Mr. Stark," he gave a small wave. "How are you feeling?"
Bucky nodded, writing some things down before sticking the note in his pocket. The (also old-fashioned) bell jingled, signaling the entrance of their first customer of the day.
Steve chuckled, turning around to see his friend and colleague, Clint, look at him in distaste over the rim of his coffee mug.
“For the last time, I don’t care if it’s ‘only’ a standard room. We do
. You, she occasionally finds useful.”
It turns out to be a surprise-treachery-and-trying-to-shoot-Tony-in-the-face-type meeting. Tony is really getting tired of those.
Steve chuckles. “She might stab
“Hey. Shhh.” Steve kisses him gently and slides one big hand around his waist to settle at the small of his back. “It’s OK. It’s not your fault. It’s a small hotel. They ran out of rooms. We’re gonna be fine. I’m just glad we have a safe place to sleep.” He kisses Tony’s nose, a gesture that should be embarrassing but somehow manages to be adorable, because it’s Steve.
adorable, which, how is that even fair? “And, uh, I know I said I wanted to take it slow, and I do, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t looking forward to spending the night with you.”
“When I thought about sharing a horizontal surface with you, this was not exactly what I had in mind,” Tony murmurs, but there’s no heat in it.
OK, it’s technically at least a double, maybe even a queen, but … Tony blinks and looks again just to make sure, and yeah, there’s only the one.
Whatever Steve was about to say will just have to go unstated, because Tony can’t waste another second before shutting him up with a kiss.
They stand there in silence for a long moment, staring at the bed.
Tony could stand here and make out with Steve forever, but they’re supposed to meet their contact in half an hour and that definitely won’t give them enough time to take this where Tony would like it to go, so eventually he has to force himself to pull away. “We’re gonna be late if we keep this up,” he murmurs. “Not that I mind, but if we screw up this meeting, Natasha will stab us both.”
“We’ll just have to make up for it next time. Now shhh.” Steve’s breathing has already gone slow and deep. He presses his lips gently to Tony’s neck, heedless of the grime. “Might as well get some rest while we wait.”
, and that was Rogers' blood flecking those slender knuckles, and it was all for
Most everything else is plotted out a lot better, so I should be able to get on a regular(ish) for me schedule moving forward.
During the war he had lost men - not any of the Howlies, but they didn't always work alone. Soldiers had been lost on his watch and he had taken each death harder than he probably should have. Then he'd won the battle against Hydra only to lose everything else. Sometimes he still heard Peggy's voice his ear, choked with emotion, as they pretended he would show up for their dance. Of all the things he had missed, of all the chances he'd lost because he'd gone into the ice, that one would always cut the deepest. He'd lost a life with her, one where they could have been happy together, had children and a house - all the things that little Stevie Rogers had always known he would never get. Losing Peggy had cost him all of that, and sometimes he thought that maybe he mourned that lost life more than he did her.
The plan had been Steve’s with just a few flourishes from him. If he told them that though it would turn their attention back to the blond. It was exactly what he was trying to avoid, so he shrugged and tried to keep his discomfort hidden.
"Don't ya get nasty with me, Tony. Now start jawin' at each other instead-a me."
Despite fears that the falling out - dubbed the 'Civil War' by some - between the old Avengers team would leave Earth defenseless, the new team is ready and willing to take up the mantle. The Accords Committee members that have given statements are pleased with the way the members are coming together. "We are in good hands," said one member on the condition of anonymity. "Colonel Rhodes and Captain Danvers both have steady hands and a refreshing willingness to work with the Accords instead of against them. I firmly believe that the mistakes of the past can be avoided, and that the accountability and oversight we provide is a key element of that."
"Tiny Adorable Steve... I love you."
Then I will give you what you need before returning you to your body.
where Strange and the rest were fighting evil Jedi when they took down the last active death petal. He couldn't help them out, not with the magical dome encasing them, and when he saw the streaks of red in the sky above Vision's location he wanted to throw up. His Iron Kid was still over there too, so he almost went anyway... but Harley's voice was still steady whenever it came over the comms. Harley didn't need him, so he didn't have to feel too bad about choosing to help fight the demon-dogs instead of watching Wanda fight.
"I think not."
because a red mist was rising over the place where he'd last seen Vision. The witch was on their side, allegedly, but her methods still gave him the heebie jeebies and threatened to throw him into a flashback. He held on to the sound of Rhodey's bitching to prevent that, and focused the rest of his attention on the death petals.
"Sweetheart?" Steve's voice broke into his thoughts at the same time as a pointed chin hooked on his shoulder and dug in. He met his lover's eyes through the mirror and offered the best smile he could muster through his anxiety. The other man's expression went soft and understanding - again, goddammit - and then arms wrapped tightly around him and squeezed. "If you don't wanna go--"
Lokes to get him to give up the goods.
"You guys don't have the 'how dare' thing?"
"I keep thinkin' maybe it'll get easier," Steve murmured back, head on his shoulder. "Never does. But this time it's not forever."
It is over! A bittersweet thing to say, as I've loved spending time in this universe even if I was often slow on updating. <3
Little Stevie Rogers was still probably going to die alone.
"No. I threw the remote at the TV. Antosha yelled." Winter's heavy frown showed how much that upset him. Maybe Shellhead still mostly ignored him, but he and Tony had formed a bond that nobody had expected. The two of them seemed constantly surprised by it, and he'd talked his lover through more than one existential crisis because of it. "If he doesn't want his things to break he shouldn't show people such trash."
“You shouldn’t be so modest, Tony.” The guy - Nathan? Probably-Nathan took his chance to press a little closer, fingers running up Tony’s bicep. “You’re quite the… asset to the team.” He squeezed down on Tony’s arm suggestively while peering over his shoulder. He was lucky he hadn’t gotten goosed, and fuck why wasn’t Steve walking away? Every other time this had happened Steve had turned tail - or rather, made a tactical retreat. Tony could then shake the admirers loose instead of having people in his personal bubble with fingers stroking him. Thank fucking God those fingers were staying in mostly appropriate places.
Two is that, in this story, Tony and Pepper never actually dated. They are super close, but not romantically interested in each other. They are very much 'ride or die' tho, along with Rhodey. XD
