Pete huffs, it’s not like the mask is uncomfortable, he was just looking forward to hanging out face to face. Like a real member of the team.
The memory of his dream is crashing back over him like a wave. He's done it. Let go, given everything he has to Tony, and god if it didn’t feel harder than fighting him.
away from declaring war on anyone stronger than a professional athlete, Jarvis is dead and my tower is empty. Speaking of empty, Pepper left by the way." Tony motions to the spartan, empty penthouse.
“I’m going to place your feet in the stirrups, keep scooting down until your posterior is at the very edge of the table.” says Steve as he slides his fingers out of Tony and moves the pillow out of Tony's way.
Steve pulls out and quickly wipes himself off with some disposable towels from a dispenser on the wall.
Steve’s tempted, but he’s ready to move on. He moves off of Tony entirely, emptying the remainder of the small tube into his palm and throwing it to the side. Steve straddles him again, facing him once more. He bends to kiss him languidly for a moment until Tony nips at his lip, a silent protest for not getting his way.
Steve breaths hot against Tony’s chest, pausing to look up at him. “I’m going to take care of you, Tony.”
Steve knows that things with Becky never really got back to where they were before Hawaii. After he told her about his conversation with Tony, she said it wouldn’t change anything… but it did.
Tony and Strange bring Nat, Wanda, Scott and T’Challa through the portal with just enough time to go over the game plan one more time.
Steve sobers. “I… honestly with everything I haven’t given that a lot of thought.” Steve is silent for several moments. “I think getting everyone back together, soothing the tensions our conflict has sewn; that will be step one. I’d like to keep us, just for
Finally Tony pulls away, his mouth shiny and tender-looking. He sinks down the small distance from where he's clinging to Steve's neck and shoulders to rest on his knees, mirroring Steve's position. He lays his head against Steve's broad chest and brings his arms loosely around his lower back.
Steve gets back to the compound in record time. He considers going to his room to shower, but he really wants to surprise Tony. He’s only a couple minutes out now, and decides to head straight for the master suite. Tony provided him blanket access to everywhere on the compound. He cranks his music up in his wireless ear buds for the last sprint, a wide smile plastered to his face.
Steve knows he can’t actually just use his own juices to open Tony up, but he got the idea as Tony was stroking him in the shower. He’s slick. Really slick. With enough prep he probably could fuck Tony on that alone… but for now he thinks this probably helps get at Tony’s desire to be owned.
Tony’s head snaps up from where it was angled down at Steve’s perfect chest. So different from his own; not one scar.
“Can we go take a shower, maybe eat something, and then curl up in bed? Leave figuring out The Fate of the Avengers until the morning?”
Tony loses his grip a little saying “Yes Steve, yes,” head still on the table like he can't bear to keep watching.
“Right, so, obviously I didn’t mean to say that.” Tony starts. And the pain on Steve’s face makes him
He’ll make it up to him. Tony has a private three-bedroom bungalow on a private beach on Oahu, which is where they are headed now (he also has a place in Maui, but there are always people on the beach there from the surrounding resorts).
“What? You’re going away? For how long?” Tony feels slightly panicked and he doesn’t know why. Realistically he knows Steve won’t actually leave him. This is just part of what he’s devised for the scene… it’s kind of a brilliant move, since getting left waiting by doctors seems to be about half their job. But Tony is feeling more exposed than he thought he would, and he doesn't want Steve to go.
Tony leans back against Steve’s strong arms, grasping himself tight. He throws his head back and let’s go.
After several moments the door doesn’t open. He didn’t think it would, but he thought maybe it would trip some alarm, trigger some notification. He waits but nothing happens.
At first Tony isn’t even aware he’s said it. He was thinking of saying it. Of course he was, he’s imagined saying that very thing to Steve ten times a day. But in the rush to get his suit on and get his hair to flop just right, he’s just… said it.
Instead of answering Steve lunges at his mouth. It feels almost like he’s mimicking Tony’s final efforts, Steve’s tongue franticly trying to reach every bit of Tony’s mouth it can. Digging at him, searching. Tony returns as good as Steve gives him, stroking his tongue over Steve’s sharing the lingering mild taste of the lube and Steve’s essence.
He feels hot tears prick in his eyes as another massive wave of embarrassment comes on, almost too much to take...
Steve opens his eyes, still looking a little dazed and moves to the center of the bench. Now that there’s room Tony lifts one leg up on one side of him, then swings the other up to straddle Steve’s lap. The bench is deep enough that Tony has room to slide down comfortably onto Steve’s lap and wrap his arms around his neck.
Steve puts his hands out on Tony’s shoulders like he needs a physical support to keep from keeling over. It’s unlikely with the serum he’s actually light-headed. But it means Tony’s words have mentally worked him up so much that his brain
Tony murmurs hoarsely; the words reverberate against the glass of the shower and make their way out of the bathroom to Steve’s ears.
"I just saw you kiss, thought ‘wow look at that, that’s hot,’ and left.” Scott makes a straight-line movement with his hands. “Totally professional.”
He rubs at Steve’s hip to reassure him. “You’re doing so well Steve. I’m getting the lube now. You don’t want to use soap on yourself there, even my tasty ones.” Steve nods and gasps, breath shuttering, grip tightening on the handholds. Tony is glad he went all-out with the quality of materials for the shower, the handrails are titanium alloy and should hold up to Steve’s super strength… at least for a while.
I love the idea of Rocket slowly coming around to Tony. And Thor has become such a fun character in the MCU, he is absolutely fucking with Steve here 😂
He tells himself he hates it, but if he’s being honest with himself he’s come to anticipate, even yearn for the dreams. Day after day it gets harder to run on less sleep, but every night he lays there as the anticipation builds like an unstoppable wave to its crescendo. At first he could get an hour of rest, then 45 minutes, then 30 before his dreams would jolt him awake, aching, harder than steel and gasping, visions of Tony burned behind his eyelids. Each night he wakes up suddenly and climaxes at the barest touch to the most intense orgasm he’s
There is of course, a niggling thought at the back of his mind that never quite goes away, no matter how beautiful the bird of paradise are, or how fun surfing looks.
So yeah, if you’d asked Steve before tonight what the chances were that Tony Stark was interested in him sexually, he would have thrown out a pretty low number. Not zero, because it’s on record that Tony is bi, and over the years he’s definitely made more comments about Steve’s ass than all the other Avengers combined… but no, Steve wouldn’t have ever had the stones to proposition him.
“Jesus Steve, do have any idea how hard I had to hold it together in there? Hearing about how good your cum is for me? How it’s making me better?”
He tenses all over, which reminds him there’s a huge butt plug in his ass. He closes his eyes to focus, willing himself to say the right thing. He opens them and looks Pepper in the eye.
like experience, which takes away the jitters of this being his first time with Tony (or with any man for that matter), but… he can’t help but feel that Tony should be telling him what to do.
For all of Steve’s hopes/fears that Tony will try to move things along once in bed, Tony is totally pliant, letting Steve set the pace. Steve kisses him deeper, settling a little heavier on top of him, but careful to keep their lower halves out of alignment. Tony continues to respond beautifully, pressing up from underneath him, running his hands over Steve’s arms and back. Finally Steve pulls back, running his hand up from Tony’s chest to his jawline tracing his facial hair.
The phone is dead, so he sets it on Tony’s wireless charging pad. They’ve spent the last day alternating between intense physical release, and calm periods where they eat, talk, and just generally enjoy each other’s company. Steve knows they’ve covered all the ground they can with the accords and strategizing to bring the team back home. He really should be heading out to see Buck, and then return to the others...
Steve reaches behind himself to guide Tony in. Fuck, he’s already tight. He flushes realizing the serum probably means he can’t really wait too long after prepping himself. Lesson learned for next time, he’s loose enough, and there’s plenty of lube. He lowers himself quickly over the head and down a few inches, knowing with every second he waits he’s just tightening back up.
Namely, that Tony has become incredibly touchy-feely. Which is saying something since he was already physically affectionate. Steve notices that Tony is touching him in front of the team the same way he would if they were alone in the master suite of the compound. Nothing obscene, but if Steve is within arms-reach of Tony, Tony is touching him.
Fear grips Tony at the base of his spine. He’s been with Steve in the field a ton of times since they got together. There have been times before where Steve took a hit that looked bad, but it all worked out. It’s going to work out.
Steve sits there for a moment. He’s in the future, and a robotic dog has just told him that Tony Stark loves him. He turns to Tony, who looks both horrified and proud.
. She does go offline and there are no recordings… but… she’s an AI Steve, even if she isn’t peeping, she can’t
Soon he has Tony laid out on the bed, his exposed skin a stark contrast to the deep red comforter. Steve hasn't painted much in the last year, but Tony's lightly tanned skin against the crimson material suddenly makes him miss it. A deep ache he hasn't noticed, burried under the more pressing drama of the Accords and all the rest. He resolves to go buy some new supplies and set up a small studio area in his room.
Next up we see the impact of the reunification on the events of Infinity War/Endgame and beyond (hint, Thanos gets his ass handed to him, and ~almost~ everyone gets a happy ending).
He once again feels pleasure overload, where he can’t seem to contain the feeling within his body. He’s floating, on another plane outside himself, it’s too much. Seeing Tony throw himself back, confident Steve will support him, touching himself, moaning Steve's name.
Seriously though, if you haven’t read 1796 Broadway, go! And ‘choose your own adventure’ over this way at chapter 110 if you want!
Steve rubs his cheek against Tony's palm and moves to pull at the too-soft pants, anxious to make Tony’s plan a reality.
His hand continues to sting as Bruce brushes it with some kind of clear liquid. Natasha et. al. wanted some SHIELD medical prick to look at it, but it’s his hand, and his suit (now removed thanks to J’s soft touch) and his fucking arc reactor, so if they want more than cool water and a rag anywhere
Tony pauses. His mouth has run away from him again, but this time he’s done something even more terrifying than suggest Steve give him a blowjob… he’s basically told him he fucking loves him. He hadn’t even really thought through his own feelings to that conclusion yet, but he can see it’s true. Fuck.
“Four months to go, right?” he asks, like he doesn’t have a little count-down clock in his head. He is going to have to talk to Pepper about planning the surprise party soon. It’s sad to say but Tony has absolutely no idea how any of the events he’s involved in (or supposedly is in charge of) get done. Pepper and her teams do it all. He should get her something… something showing appreciation but not romantic. Maybe a new vacation home.
Steve pumps himself a few more times and then slides his hand down to the base and holds tightly. “Yes, we are going to get started Tony, just try to relax. Once the procedure begins you’ll need to hold still. You may be tempted to push back, but I’m going to hold you firmly so that doesn’t happen, okay?”
Tony smiles, relief flooding through him “Then I think that gets us 90% of the way there. Steve, we need a leader, and we need a single point of direction in the field. When it comes to bigger stuff, we’ll all work together to figure it out.”
There are no traditional lights, but much like the side-entrance to Avengers Tower, there are faint lines of airplane-like emergency lighting on each step indicating where they start and end. In less than a minute Steve gets to the bottom, and he can hear the groan of some type of machinery pulling the stairs at the top back into place.
The police are called when the makeshift motor Tony and Rocket have cobbled together catches fire and explodes.
Tony makes a strangled noise and removes his arm to look at Steve, who has his pants open and is stalking around the bed toward Tony like some kind of jungle cat. He makes a pit stop at the bedside table to grab some tissues.
Before, well with the few ladies he dated casually and then with Sharron he’d always been able to calm down. Sure, he
Peter >> <image attached> omg you guys are SO getting married! You can’t be like an inch apart, it’s adorable
Or maybe it was Steve that changed? All he knows is that once he talked with Tony, being with Becky just wasn’t the same. Two weeks after he and Tony get back from Hawaii, they break up. Steve feels guilty, but he also knows it was for the best. Becky deserves more than to be with someone who has feelings for someone else.
Steve keeps up a gentle rhythm as he explores Tony’s mouth, licking at his lips, biting them. Eventually slipping his tongue in as much as the angle allows. After several long minutes Tony starts to continuously moan into his mouth. Like he is in so much pleasure there’s nothing he can do but groan, spread out against Steve’s front, arms locked on his own handrails.
“So the platform is mainly for access. At this height, I can easily wash your hair. Stream 2, increase angle 30%”
“I think maybe Hawaii wasn’t such a great idea after all, what do you say we grab some chocolate Macadamia nuts and catch a plane back home?”
After marking something on the clipboard with his pen, Steve comes over and begins touching Tony’s neck, feeling his lymph nodes. Then takes his wrist and measures his pulse. Tony feels his face get hot. The touches aren’t sexual at all, but that’s what seems to be setting him off. The taboo of getting aroused in a medical environment, the fact that he can, and it’s Steve here with him. Tony shifts on the table and the paper crinkles loudly.
Tony whips his head around to see the back of Steve’s naked ass crossing the living area and entering the bathroom. Tony can now faintly hear the music coming from Steve’s earbuds all the way over where he is in the living room. He was just out of Steve’s sight in the curved portion of the living room that is separated from the entryway, but the angle of the view-screen gave Pepper a view of the entire room.
Tony for his part seems… confused. Which is better than enraged. Steve breaths deep and draws up the courage to look at Tony. Steve places his palms loosely on his thighs and sits back on his heels, beginning again.
“This method has largely gone out of style, but I have always felt it made more sense to expand the cavity manually. This way I can really feel your body, and know how much to give you. If we used the silicon expanders, I wouldn’t be able to have as much control.”
Steve bottoms out and seems to lose track of his mouth as he blurts “So good, you feel so good in me Tony. Everything. Everything you do is good. Perfect, you’re so perfect to me. For me. In me.”
Tony feels an electric shot go through him. Of course he figured Steve thought about them doing this once or twice before just falling to his knees before him. But well, they haven’t had the smoothest time of things the last few months… or really ever, so to hear "you" so immediately, with so much honesty. So much longing.
Steve lets out a small noise and focuses on staying completely still. One of Tony’s hands moves to cup the back of his head, while he moves to wrap the other gauntlet around his own length. Steve wishes briefly he could let go of the hammer and be the one to take Tony in hand, but is quickly distracted when Tony gives himself a gentle pump, stopping before his hand makes contact with Steve’s lips.
Tony nuzzles Steve’s neck as he smooths his hands in little circles on Steve's sides and hips. “Hmm? Oh, yeah, the original Jarvis… He was our family driver/butler/you name it. He pretty much raised me.”
Wong eyes the slumped form of Thanos. "We may also have something to restrain him in the archives. You must be getting tried, no?"
“Mmm-” is all Tony manages to respond as Steve moves down, placing gentle kisses along his nose, then his eye-brows and finally on his ‘thing’ under his mouth. Steve continues to kiss Tony, bracing himself over him on one arm, resting the other on Tony’s torso, playing with the edge of the collar of his undershirt.
Steve’s tongue feels like it’s glued to the roof of his mouth. He just shakes his head about the drink and takes a single step into the room.
He considers Tony before adding, “Jarvis cared for you very deeply; as deeply as was possible given his constraints.”
And how he flew to Japan to support Tony when every other person on the planet thought Tony was being an irresponsible ass (himself included).
“Okay, so, what were you thinking when you chose these settings?” Steve asks as he eyes the mini platform and
“The reason is, Steve… that I want to share myself with you, give myself to you. And not, not in the literal sense, although I want that
Tony clears his throat and speaks in his usual rushed, cavalier tone: “Hey, long-time-no-see, drink? I’ve got water, Fanta.” He’s holding a bottle of water up, his posture relaxed and confident.
Wanda turns and smiles at them. “We’ve been working on paprikash since last night, it’s almost done and there’s plenty.” Things between Wanda and Tony have been good, if not overly-friendly. He’s not sure he’ll ever get over the image she put in his head when they were at odds during Ultron. Steve dead, broken shield on his chest. The end of the world.
“Steve, Steve, yes, please, take it out of me, I need you in its place. Please, it’s been so long, been fucking myself silly with dildos, need you.”
Steve looks bemused. He tells the team to shower/go relax and they’ll meet back up later to debrief, then pulls Tony in for a quick kiss.
“Dr. Strange, can you sling-ring back to Earth from here? Is it possible to gather more of the team onto this planet?”
?” Tony’s voice pitches up and suddenly he looks even more wrecked than when he thought Steve’s feet were burned. “Steve – look, I just… I don’t care about hula girls.” He looks up to the sky and shakes his head slightly like he does when he’s about to do something reckless, then looks Steve in the eye and says:
Steve nods, determined. Tony can only describe his facial expression as his “Captain America face.” He abruptly stands, taking Tony with him. Hands cupped under his ass. Just picking him up like he’s a sack of potatoes. No, more like a sack of feathers, fuck. He moves Tony away from the bench and over to the raised platform where he pauses. He kisses Tony deeply, then slowly lowers him to the platform like he’s made of glass.
Tony slides two fingers through the soap down into the  space between Steve’s ass cheeks. Stroking slowly up and down several times, just barely grazing his hole on the upstroke. Steve shifts on his feet and squats subtly, just the slightest bend of his knees, pushing his ass out an inch or so closer toward Tony.
And it’s not like he’s asking Steve to pretend to be Johnny Storm or something, more like… a doctor version of himself. Maybe instead of joining the army, Steve decided to help people with his mind and went to medical school. Something like that. He’d still be
He adds more soap to the cloth and drags it along Steve’s perineum and then carefully over his balls.
“You can’t just refuse medical care Tony!” Steve starts before he’s even made it to their make-shift healing station.
Steve adds a third finger and more lube. “Apologies if that was unclear, we will need to insert the expander for a short while. It’s part of the process that can’t be skipped, here we go.” Steve removes his fingers and Tony turns in time to see him pick up the largest “expander,” aka, dildo, and slather lube over it with his gloved hand.
It's... Yeah they are still in the shower. I swear there's more character development and discussion of the deep issues coming... Idk what to tell you, it's a really nice shower. 😅
But he’s rooted to the spot. His throat is closing. He can’t move. It’s like he’s drowning in that icy water all over again and Tony is walking by him, not looking at him. He wants to call out to him. Reach out.
“Good, great, okay well enjoy having all this space to yourself, feel free to, you know, make yourself at home.”
“Nrrg, uh, wha?” Steve can’t help but exclaim at the sensation, but also can’t really fathom that Tony enjoys eating soap…
“You’re going to tell me more about this fantasy of yours, and while you do I’m going to suck you off. I’m already close, so I’m going to come while you’re in my mouth, maybe twice if I can. Otherwise I’ll take care of myself while you drive… as it is I’m pretty sure that even if I come three times I’ll have to sit through the performance with an erection tucked up against my stomach.”
Steve moves up the table to stand up by Tony’s head so he can look him in the eye. “It’s true that the,” Steve pauses for about half a second, “the apparatus, is quite large. We will need to take our time inserting it to ensure we don’t hurt you.” He touches Tony’s shoulder “Don’t worry, I’ve done this hundreds of times, and no one has ever gotten hurt.”
“You look so beautiful like this Tony, stretched out for me, taking it so well. Look at you, blissed out from just my fingers.” Steve twists and spreads them as he speaks. “How does it feel to be fucked open by me, totally spent, unable to do anything but take it? Do you still want my cock even though you’re not hard, can’t come? Can’t do anything but exist just for me?”
Tony struggles against Steve’s hold, and wow yeah for a second he literally can’t move. He might as well be held in place by vibranium chains. It’s hard sometimes to keep in mind exactly how crazy-strong Steve is… Steve notices quickly that Tony is at least trying to move though and releases him immediately, face pulled into an apologetic grimace.
Steve stands to join him, wrapping his arms around him from behind. “I don’t want to sleep away from you. Or have to think about if I’m sitting next to you too often at meals. I want to hold your hand when we watch TV. I want everyone to know what you mean to me…”
Tony leans into his touch, and Steve almost expects him to purr. And he thinks again about that old grey cat, and wonders if it was the right thing to say.
“I woke up from the ice and they didn’t remember or care to remember what people are capable of. I thought SHIELD did, I thought there was a way for us to move forward... But then it turned out SHIELD was a lie too... I've read about the last 70 years I missed in black and white, and it‘s there over and over again. When you give an inch, when you lay down at the beginning because it’s easier, we all lose. I couldn’t do it. It’s not some terrible alien threat I’m worried about. Its people. Regular people, governments, our own team members standing by and doing nothing.”
Just as they gain the advantage however, a building begins to collapse, and Steve and Tony are tied up getting people out of the way and reinforcing the structural integrity so it doesn’t cause massive loss of life.
Tony interrupts again “Yeah, that should work Scott. Honestly, with a young kid like that you’re probably gonna want to be more available to her though, right? School plays and emergencies will pop up. I’ll download the app you need to your new Stark Phone so you can call one of my planes whenever. It can get you to San Fran in like 3 hours, door to door.”
“You don’t have to, I mean we don’t have to… you’ve already, and I can, um, that is… sometimes it can take more than once, or even more than twice… sorry…”
Tony plunges on, “But we are communicating now. And it's good Pep, it's really good. I promise you we have thought this through. We’re in this thing, together, whatever it takes.”
Steve thinks that if Tony did all that, there was no reason for him to keep the actual phone out, on his bedside table this whole time… it's probably the first thing he sees when he wakes up.
“Let’s get you back up on the table Mr. Stark” he says, and Tony takes his cue and climbs back up. As he does he feels some of Steve’s come slide out of him. Steve notices too and helps Tony onto his back, lifting his legs so they are bent and his ass is angled a bit to prevent more from dripping out.
Of course he understands the basic mechanics of gay sex, and that men go down on women, so it would make sense that you could do that with a man too, but he just never… He’s so hard that he can’t really stand to compare the two choices for more than a few seconds.
Tony takes over now, thrusting into Steve’s mouth and holding his leg fast against Steve’s erection. It’s a little more awkward than when Steve had full range of movement, more desperate, their bodies pressed tightly together as Tony thrusts, thrusts thrusts into Steve’s mouth, which is no more than a desperate “o” while he ruts feverishly against Tony’s leg. Steve loses himself totally, grasping the leg he’s humping with one hand to find better purchase and Tony’s ass with the other to force him harder, deeper into his mouth.
“Because! My dick could sense what a perfect opportunity this is! Are you seriously going to run for another hour?”
When Morgan turns three, Steve invites Pepper over and asks if she has any interest in Morgan having a sibling. Tony is beside himself at the prospect of a child with Steve and Pepper’s combined genetics. He thought nobody could be as perfect as Morgan, but he knows any hypothetical child that has the best of Steve Rogers and Pepper Potts is destined for greatness.
Tony rubs small irregular patterns up Steve’s back. Finally saying, “You’re really happy? With me? I was noticing you seemed a little down earlier, before Rhodey’s call.”
“So I can’t really get the idea out of my head, and I thought I’d just ask. No pressure to say yes, it’s probably really stupid…” Tony takes a breath and presses on. “Was role-play even a thing in the 30s? I don’t want you to be like, some other person. Just like, wear a lab coat and put me up on a table and fuck me while talking about how big of a dose I need, that kind of a thing... You’d be Steve, but just like, Dr. Rogers? Oh fuck I’m getting hard…”
“I know it’s not that simple” says Bruce. Steve quirks a smile and wonders if maybe mind-reading is a side effect of being a super genius. “but being honest doesn’t mean you have to have the answers. Tell them how you feel, even if what you feel is confused. Give them time to be honest in turn with you. You’re a good guy, Steve, and no one who really knows you will just walk away because things have become… complicated.”
He clicks a few things on his pad and briskly exits, leaving Steve there next to Tony holding the small cup.
He wants Tony to do it again. Harder. He wants to know how hard he can possibly hit him. He wishes he could drag this out, but there’s no way. If Tony hits him again like that, he's not going to last. And if he doesn’t get up against Tony’s leg soon he’s definitely going to drip on to the rug… that possibility fuels genuine panic within him, causing him to blurt:
Steve is adventurous and creative in bed and has been open to anything and everything they’ve tried… but this involves role play, which they haven’t done. And Tony’s not sure Steve would be comfortable with it. Steve is so earnest, and Tony doesn’t want him to think he needs him to be someone he’s not.
one… but he knows how to read people, and he definitely knows how to read Tony. He’s also pretty good at coming up with plans of action.
Rocket bristles, his fur puffing out slightly. “First of all, everyone knows Shuri did all the work on the infinity gauntlet-“
Steve’s blush deepens and spreads as he finds himself prone on his stomach on the sand, wearing only what is essentially an undergarment (why are Tony’s swim trunks more like shorts?!), while Tony kneels on his knees behind him holding Steve’s left foot up to inspect it.
Steve answers, “The first few times were nine months ago. Then we were apart for a month while we settled the Accords. We’ve been, um, with each other regularly since then.” Steve gives up and just embraces how red he is getting. Maybe if he turns purple he’ll pass out and be saved this indignity.
It’s almost two weeks later when he tells Steve casually after one of their team training sessions (wherein a Friday-manned giant lizard monster that looks like Godzilla almost took out Sam) that their
Tony feels the hot liquid spill inside him and almost forgets to touch himself, just enjoying the feeling of Steve letting go, picturing what his face looks like when he comes. He slides a hand down to grasp his cock. It’s rough and a little dry, but he’s leaked enough that he can thrust into his own hand easily enough and he’s coming in seconds. Tony comes all over the side of the exam table and goes boneless, thankful for the table itself and Steve who is still holding his hips.
“So good Steve, I’m close… when I tell you, I want you to suck as hard as you can. Can you do that for me?”
bit like you’re offering to blow me? And I know you said “whatever it takes” but yeah, that’s probably not… what you meant... Oh my god please get up or I will keep rambling and it will only get dirtier…”
Steve slowly pushes forward, advancing at a snail’s pace. By the time he’s seated fully inside Tony he knows he needs to do something to slow himself down, something more than mindless thrusting.
God Steve doesn’t know how to say the right thing. He paws kind of pathetically at Tony’s chest in apology. Tony’s chest, which is covered in scar tissue, which Steve is just noticing for the first time... God, has he even paid any attention to Tony this whole time, or was he too focused on himself, on having Tony meet
Everything. Becky. How confused he has been by Tony’s, well, flirting. How confused he is by his own flirting…
If anyone has preferences or something else they want to see, let me know. Thank you again for reading!
“I don’t mean to send mixed messages…” Steve sighs, leaning down to brush a kiss of his own onto Tony’s forehead.
“I think we just need to talk to people, and bring it up one on one or in small groups. Organically. When people are relaxed. That way we can field any questions that they have as friends and house-mates. Once everyone knows, you can add it to the agenda of the next Avengers meeting under “Interpersonal Relationships” to give people a forum to bring up how it might affect the team. Honestly, we will probably want to use that opportunity to check in with Wanda and Vision too. They obviously are all over each other, and we need to get them on the same page about how that might impact their actions in the field."
They shower briefly and collapse on the bed, awakening  once it’s dark outside. They go out to dinner in the city and then take a paddle boat ride in central park.
“Has anyone ever done this for you before Steve?” He slides the finger out and back in up to the knuckle.
Tony notices and moves his hand along his length to spread the wetness around. “Mmm, yeah that’s right Steve, you're so hard again already, look at you. No matter what you chose, I'll make it so good for you.”
“Shh,” Steve says as he traces the perimeter of Tony’s hole with his cockhead, rubing it around and around. “That’s right Tony, it’s just me and you... I’m opening you up with my precum... because you are mine. Marking you... This part of you is mine, no one else’s.”
But he doesn’t answer. He appears to be having some sort of fit, his head is moving so fast Steve can't fully track his movements.
“Steve, relax man, we all know you and Tony are together.” He shakes his head, like he can’t believe Steve is this slow on the up-take.
Whirlwind’s defeat is a footnote in the news cycle the next day. Instead the headlines that dominate every media outlet, social media site and conversation are:
Bruce turns to a small cabinet and opens it, pulling out a small plastic cup with a lid. He hands it silently to Steve.
“Yeah, cheer up Steve,” says Tony, “Now that they officially know, I can say things like ‘lets go back to the suite and have sex!’”
“What? Brucie-bear, no! I swear, I left all that behind me with extremis. I haven’t been doing any sort of bioresearch at all. I can show you my work logs.”
Bruce begins to delicately apply the goo with a gauze swab clamped into forceps before saying: “I’ve actually probably seen as many burns as most medics Cap, and I’ve developed a super concentrated aloe-based tincture that should speed his healing time.”
Scott shrinks down to Ant Man size, grabs a tiny handful of cake and runs away. Natasha hands the corner piece to Tony with a level “Please talk to him, it’s just going to get more awkward.”
Another hologram of the iconic tourist “I heart New York” t-shirt appears over the countdown clock. “Umm, yeah, what’s that?” asks Peter.
LASS-E quickly becomes a fixture around the tower. Tony is still consistently amazed at his own awesomeness when she instinctively follows Bruce around for a week after he has what everyone can only assume was a not-so-great call from a former associate named Betty.
He nods and they are quiet all the way back to the master suite. They shower with utilitarian speed; for once Tony has something more enticing than his custom shower settings.
He wakes up with a single unrelenting thought: that he needs to get to Tony. Then he comes all over himself while sucking on a corner of his pillow.
Steve pulls up enough to kiss Tony. "I’m the happiest I’ve ever been.” he says with conviction, looking into Tony’s eyes.
Tony’s been in a modified crunch during the exchange so he can see Steve, but he relaxes fully onto his back, letting his head fall to the mattress to get comfortable. He can’t see Steve anymore, and jolts in surprise when he feels Steve lift him up to meet his tongue.
Tony wants to keep ahold of his hand on their way to the kitchen. God he is gone for Steve. Who holds hands walking around in their own house? He smiles a little with the knowledge that soon they can if they want. He feels like he’s a kid again with his first crush.
He’s an independently wealthy biochemist who is working on a cure for cancer. Honestly, he reminds Steve a little of Tony (though way more subdued and somewhat less attractive, in Steve’s opinion).
“I promise. So… if I’m not catching that flight, we probably have a little more time in the shower?”
After the debrief, Steve and Tony are relaxing in the suite’s living room when Tony gets a text. It’s a screenshot of Peter’s text conversation with Ned.
Tony almost snorts at that, but Steve continues on, “In fact, it’s perfectly normal for the procedure to feel pleasurable. There’s no need to feel embarrassed if you get aroused, that’s to be expected.”
Bruce has stopped typing and cuts Tony off. “Steve’s right Tony, let’s stick to my questions. That will make this as painless as possible.”
He pushes it down. He’s been pushing it down since well before the end with Pepper. Right now Steve is the only person he has that he even remotely wants to be around. Tony isn’t going to mess that up by pursuing something that is so far from possible that even
Steve is leaking enough now that Tony has lubrication to work with. He begins running both of his hands over Steve in random, erratic patterns, like he can’t even focus on a single technique to pull him off.
Tony lays himself out on the sofa and gestures to Steve to lean back up against him so they can spread out comfortably.
Thor has asked Tony to install a new holographic overlay option for his arm, one that looks like the arm has sustained a major injury to help him mislead enemies.
He feels like he’s in a dream. While they were apart he no longer had his haunting sex dreams, but he did think about Tony. A lot. He found excuses to get some privacy multiple times a day.
Bucky’s arm is a standard chrome design, because Tony figures at this point Bucky must hate change. For Thor Tony creates an agile, adaptive design that can change color and texture. He knows the Godking secretly likes pomp and circumstance. Thor spends a pleasant afternoon changing his arm’s look on a whim from a realistic flesh-color holographic overlay, to a brilliant gold color, to a shimmering rainbow sheen which according to Thor “indeed could have been mistaken for a dim imitation of the Bifrost.”
Okay so, I think this may be the last of this series for a while. There is still more I want to write (including "Tony and Steve go camping and Tony fucks Steve up against a tree," and a more angsty "Steve is nervous to hold/care for Morgan" story).
Tony pulls on the hair back harder toward the floor, causing Steve’s chin to tilt up. Tony catches his eye with a look so intense that Steve questions for a moment if any of this has been real because it feels like a dream come to life.
Steve leans back more into Tony’s chest. “Think about it. Or, maybe we can formulate some kind of consensus system, a democracy?” He brings his hands to rub over his eyes. “I don’t ever want to do “my way or the highway” again. Look where that got us...”
His question is aimed at Wanda who is still restraining Thanos with her magic. She shrugs "I don't often get tired."
“Yeah no, that’s still totally inappropriate” says Sam. Nat nods in agreement, hands busy in the sink washing up. Wanda blushes and Vision looks exactly the same as he always does.
The team gathers together, and Sam rolls his eyes, “So are they all based on a different nerdy theme like Star Wars?”
Tony shrugs and slides his hands up to the base of Steve’s neck. He cups the strong muscle there, grounding himself.
“You know,” says Tony, “it’s too bad we’ll probably have to bury any of your findings Bruce, this would make a killer research publication:
Steve follows Tony and shakes his head, and trying to stop his skin from heating. He mutters, “I don’t know what that means.”
Bruce takes another vile of blood from Tony with practiced movements. He then turns to Steve. “I’m really sorry Steve, but I’d also like to get a sample from you.”
Steve gives him another encouraging smile and says, “Lay back and I’ll check to make sure you’re not having any pain before we begin. I won’t proceed with the treatment without telling you what I’m doing and what to expect, alright?”
, get me wet. Fuck your precum into me, onto me, make me take your arousal. Open me up with nothing but your wet dick…”
Instead of responding to Steve’s confession Bruce asks another question. “Do you know the thing Tony talks about the most when we’re working in the labs, apart from actual science?”
This part is set post Chapter 110: Time away from the world, from “1796 Broadway.” Tony and Steve have just reunited in Japan, where Tony is still recovering from a post-Pepper-break-up-binge/car accident. Tony has asked Steve to go to Hawaii with him for some R & R and hula girl fun (*cough*). Steve has a girlfriend he has not told Tony about.
Tony strokes himself half a dozen more times, the anticipation building with each stroke, then says:
He’d always figured it was his body trying to desperately conserve the little energy he had, but it was the one thing he liked about his pre-serum body. When he was out, he was out.
His shoulders tense at their old dynamic (which is somehow happening after ten words between him and the air around the elevator). This thing has always existed between them, where Tony seems to assume Steve is a self-righteous relic, and Steve jumps to Tony being too impulsive and self-interested. And they’re not wrong. But they’re not right, either. And getting stuck in those expectations is what got them here in the first place.
Tony takes a breath and explains. “So, here’s the thing. Sex can cause people to spread and catch all sorts of things, right?”
Tony lets go of the base of Steve’s cock and grabs his hips firmly, redoubling his efforts on Steve’s hole. Saliva and the lube he deposited there with his fingers make the way smooth and easy.
Pepper hasn’t said anything, but there’s this air of… confused respect whenever they interact. Like she can’t believe he’s being so mature about it, or she can’t believe he isn’t asking her to come back.
He’s hard again, and he feels almost frustrated about it. Except, Tony looks so… adorable. It’s an odd thing to call Iron Man, but here he is on Steve’s lap, grinning like an idiot, or like… like some sort of sex imp. Steve is sure Tony would prefer the moniker of Sex God, or Patron Saint of Sex or something… and well, in Steve’s opinion those fit too. Steve isn’t sure if he can even come again. He feels wrung out, like he must have released every ounce of semen in his body. He’s glad the shower automatically washed away the evidence of his last orgasm sprayed against the shower wall. It was obscene.
Wanda and Vision occasionally babysit and Tony sees a little gleam in Wanda’s eye. Tony wonders if that’s even possible for them. He may have a talk with Vision, he feels too young to be a grandfather…
Steve pulls back, running a hand through Tony’s hair and firmly grasping a handful of it to angle his head to be sure Tony is looking him right in the eye. Then he sets a serious look on his face and says in his best Captain America voice:
what gives me pleasure. Making you feel good is ultimately pretty selfish because it’s what I want more than anything.”
Steve realizes that with the way the platform is positioning them, it’s easy for him to lean forward a bit and capture Tony’s mouth where it’s waiting for him, Tony’s head lolled back against his shoulder.
The conclusion of this What If? for Chapter 110: Time away from the world from '1796 Broadway,' complete with epilogue because I can't wait to see Steve and Tony actually get together in that story!
Steve holds Tony's gaze, fierce and sincere. "You have to know that I’m here now, with you. Whatever it takes.”
Tony sucks the side of his cheek into his mouth, the look on his face inscrutable. “Yep, out with the old, in with the new. The tower’s for sale, fresh on the market. Got a sweet little place in the works upstate.”
Note – I have a soft spot for Avengers Tower, so in this version of things I have delayed the change over to the new Avengers facility/compound. Let’s hand-wave and agree that at the time of the accords/civil war, the transition to the upstate facility hadn’t happened yet (and thus the tower is Steve’s first option looking for Tony).
“Alright,” says Steve, “Wanda, move it up well away from everyone. Tony, Vision, destroy it from afar while we hold off the rest.”
Steve is still inside him, holding absolutely still. Tony isn’t sure if their doctor-patient relationship is done for now that they’ve both come, or if it's on pause, or still in full effect. He’s feeling too loopy and good from coming to make any decisions and decides to leave it up to Steve.
“You shouldn't hide behind sunglasses for this” he said, tucking one arm of the glasses into Tony’s collar so they rested against his chest. And Steve’s hand rested there on his chest for half a moment, and he was smiling and he was happy, and Jesus it was all Tony could do to not yell in his face “You are boyfriend material! You are the boyfriendiest!”
No, Tony doesn’t do things half-way. He wants realism. He wants medical equipment. He wants terrible fluorescent lighting and the smell of antiseptic. Well, maybe not the terrible lighting. Even with Steve’s magic DNA flowing through him, nobody looks good under that shit.
This guy “Whirlwind” uses two hardened steel sawblades to create small tornados by spinning them at  subsonic speeds. Nothing they can’t take care of, but Steve, the idiot, decides to throw himself into said tornado to dislodge a little girl that got caught in it, leaving Tony to catch her. Which means he can’t catch Steve.
Maybe they will just turn out the light and then… Steve sees that he’s screwed as soon as Tony approaches the bed smirking.
Steve kisses him again sweetly saying “I trust you, too” before moving back to his previous position. He grabs another gold tube and empties it over Tony and his fingers before adding the third finger. Tony groans, raising his arms above his head and holding them there. Steve takes him in, imagining that something is holding his arms there, maybe his shield… Fuck.
“If at any time I do something you don’t like, or if you have a question we’ll stop okay? Just say ‘Stop’.”
He grabs the lube and thinks to tell Steve “My lube is always in the gold tubes. Gold means go, easy to remember.” He knows Steve probably won’t be in the tower long enough to make use of that little tip, but he’s put the same shower with the same general layout and supplies in the master suite at the compound… if all goes well he’ll be able to start working through all thirty of the shower's settings with Steve in the not-too-distant future.
When Steve starts breathing harshly through his mouth Tony rinses him thoroughly with an adjacent spray stream, letting the water jet linger for a moment directly on Steve’s tight exposed opening.
He slides forward to rest his forehead on Tony’s lower abdomen, his nose brushing the top edge of his drawstring pants. He huffs a breath of relief before sliding his hands, still on Tony’s hips, back and down a bit to firmly grasp the swell of his ass.
That does it, seeing Tony’s cum on skin sets him off. He still manages to be careful. He doesn't squeeze or bend Tony’s less-resilient body, just holds him, pressed fully inside, filling him. God he can tell he’s somehow coming just as much as he did in the shower. He feels like he's coming and coming and will never stop. When it's over Steve stays still, just enjoying the last moments he'll be inside Tony before he has to remove himself. His cum feels sloppy around him, like it's about to slide out at the angle he's still holding Tony.
Tony squawks at that. “I do not use botox! I’m just aging like a fine wine, nothing wrong with that!”
That making sure Steve was getting what he needs, keeping the lines of communication open, would be exhausting. It turns out he truly just wants to do the work it comes to Steve. He wants to know what’s bothering him, and he wants to help him with it. And if he can’t help, he wants to be there to just listen.
“Scott, can you shrink down and take a look at what’s going on inside it? Wanda, keep it immobilized. Everyone else, fall back and provide cover from these other orbs.” As they’ve been talking more orbs have launched and continue to fire on them.
After the snap Quill left for a number of weeks to reconnect with his uncle and the family members he left behind on Earth as a kid. Drax and Mantis have been wrapped up most days eating earth snacks and watching a variety of Terran movies and TV shows (Drax – “I do not believe those “
Tony presses on. “I need you to hear me now. Me having an erection when we have sex is  meaningless. If my dick fell off tomorrow I would still spend every day giving you pleasure in any way I could, because
regret. And that’s that I didn’t trust you. Not people. Not the world’s governments. I thought I trusted you, but when it mattered I let you down. I should have trusted you with the truth. I should have trusted that you would never really let anyone take away our ability to protect people.”
At that Steve comes, and it’s only his super-soldier reflexes that allow him to get the cup up in time to catch the ejaculate. He comes and comes, almost worried that the cup will overflow. Eventually he stops, the liquid just a centimeter below the edge. He quickly adds the lid and sets the container on the edge of the sink, desperate to get at Tony in return.
“Does this look like refusing? Bruce, am I refusing?” Tony looks at Bruce, and only at Bruce. Bruce quickly glances up from his work on Tony’s hand to meet his eyes before reaching for a jar of green goo that he got earlier, along with more gauze pads.
Tony practically jumps off the table, ripping the paper on top. He turns and bends over, leaning on the table as instructed and presenting his ass. He looks back at Steve who has moved to roll the circular doctor’s chair over. It doesn’t have a back, just a round leather cushion on a rolling metal base. Fuck, Tony did not think this through, going to the doctor is going to be really fucking arousing for the foreseeable future.
They languidly trade blowjobs and settle in to go to sleep. Tomorrow Nebula and Bucky are coming over to test out a new shield/force field Tony has been working on.
“Steve, Steve I think there’s been a misunderstanding. Can you tell me, can you tell me why you wanted to have sex with me?”
He pulls off of Tony’s mouth slightly to say against his lips, “Want you to come Tony. Want to watch you paint the shower wall.” He strokes him and gently applies the slightest pressure to his sack, then leans back in to kiss him with the same careful rhythm he’s applying with his hands.
They had been so close, so close to… well, if he had any doubt about Tony’s self-control, he had no doubts now. Steve isn’t sure what Tony meant by “make yourself at home,” but he can’t bring himself to masturbate in Tony’s bed. Steve’s no stranger to taking care of business quickly; war isn’t exactly a take-your-time kind of environment… but Tony’s bed isn’t a barracks or a pitch tent in the field. As silly or romantic as it may seem, he doesn’t just want to get off here in Tony’s bed alone. He wants Tony to be here, he wants it to mean something…
Steve’s heart pumps harder at the words “exam room.” The instructions are simple enough; he doesn’t really want to talk to Friday right now.
Thor comes back from Asgard and seems delighted by her, before quickly moving on to being delighted by Clint’s ancient Game Boy, and then moving on to delighting in Flamin’ Hot Cheetos.
“I – that is, this dinner with Tony and I, Thor, it’s actually a… date? Sorry I think in the commotion of Thanos we didn’t get a chance to tell you. We’re dating, or um together, you know.” Steve’s cheeks are pink.
Steve>> Tony has a plan, its good. Great even. I’ll have a full debrief for the team in a few days. I…
“Please, please, please Tony I’m begging you! If you don’t let me suck you and come on your leg I’m going to drip, I know it. I’m so close. Please even one more slap and I’ll come untouched, it's too good, please I don’t want to ruin the rug, please please
He closes his eyes at the confession and takes Steve’s hands that are still resting tentatively on his chest and brings them up to his mouth, brushing his lips to Steve’s knuckles.
“What do you want, Tony?” he asks, slowly undoing the string, hoping to prompt him. Steve has so many dream-memories in his head, they almost feel like past experiences.
Tony finds this hilarious and laughs and laughs until he can finally from words again. “Come on, let’s go shower, I have cleaning bots and a service to take care of that.”
“Tony. You have had a crush on Captain America practically your whole life. You had Captain America bed sheets in college! You've been mooning over him for
Tony isolates the screen titled “Exoneration Timeline”  and says “Er so, I wasn’t planning on bringing this to you until it was more solid, and also I was pissed and kind of thought it was a pipe-dream? But maybe if you guys get on board early that will actually help build our case…”
He settles on leaving a note for Sam where he knows he won’t see it until the next day. This is too important, Tony… the team is too important, and Steve can’t wait any longer.
phone and put your number in under a cryptographic lock code. I wasn’t going to drag that old-ass Nokia around with me everywhere!”
"I could finally rest. And watch the sun rise on a greatful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills."
Steve is flushed and his pupils are dilatated in that way he gets before he does something crazy and brave.
Tony’s brow relaxes. “Okay, not the greatest odds, but I’d still bet on us. Is there a best course of action? One that has the best outcome?”
The Avengers branch of the SI PR team do what they do, releasing a statement approved by Steve and Tony. The two of them do a couple of joint interviews with The Advocate and with one of Steve’s favorite independent bloggers (run by a gay metal of honor recipient who mainly blogs about fixing up old bikes).
Even thinking it feels insane. There's no way he can turn it down, but he also doesn’t get where this leaves him with Cassie, or the security business he's been brainstorming with Luis since they served time together (X-Con Security Consultants). Maggie technically has sole custody, but Scott knows she and Jim want him in Cassie’s life. Steve (he can call Captain America "Steve" now!) assured him they want him on the team, but that they will do whatever it takes for him to see his daughter and keep a life outside of The Avengers.
Steve looks at the screens in awe. “Tony… I can’t believe… well, no I can, because you’re you, but... just... thank you.”
He bends down to grasp the handle anyway. A normal hammer would slide easily in the loose mud, but of course it doesn’t budge. He can’t give up, and focuses everything on lifting it, bracing himself on his knees and pulling upward with all his might.
What they wrote about in Japan, well… He looks down at his hand, a soothing cooling sensation dulling the underlying throb of pain.
The beams don’t hurt, much, but as time goes on their shots increase in intensity from a static shock to a mild taser. They also become more agile and faster.
“It’s not the spore, or I don’t think it is. No one else on the team has an irregular blood sample, and it would be strange that only you were affected since you have the most protection. The armor has a filtration system, right?”
Tony speeds up, imagining Steve watching him, knowing that Steve’s the reason he’s so fucking hard he could die. Even in his fantasy he doesn’t want to rush Steve. He wants Steve to come to him. Steve would walk into the shower, not sure what he was doing until he was pressed up behind Tony, water slowly soaking into his t-shirt and boxers. He’d rest his hands on Tony’s hips as Tony continued to work himself. Slowly, carefully fitting their bodies together.
Tony runs his hands through Steve’s hair, slowly massaging the scalp. They stay like that for several minutes before Steve stands and they tuck each other back in (Tony’s pants are a lost cause, but he pulls them up enough that they cover the essentials. He’ll change as soon as they get upstairs).
Tony usually only calls him pet names when Steve is anxious. It’s reassuring to know that Tony can read him so well, but he doesn't want to let Tony down.
“What do you recommend?” Tony asks, breathless, cock twitching. He put the dildos out to see what Steve would do with them, to give him options.
Tony leans back fully as instructed, and he realizes it’s like he’s in a sex swing, but the swing is
But as they waved goodbye he didn't put them back on. He’s not really sure what he should be hiding from Steve at this point, and what he should show.
Claw71 requested more bottom Steve, so here we are. It turned into possibly the toppiest bottom ever, but oh well haha.
Tony grimaces, pulling away suddenly regretful. “Shit Steve, I didn’t really think about that. Has this, I don’t know, brought up bad memories? I should have remembered that medical stuff probably isn’t your thing.”
“I don’t know Tony, I look at what we have, what we’ve built. And any reality like the ones you've described are pretty hard to imagine.”
Oh god Pepper, he’s been sleeping with Tony in his dreams for months and never gave her a second thought. He flushes with embarrassment, eyes darting around to see if there’s any trace of her in the open floorplan.
Unfortunately, Steve seems to have interpreted his throat-clearing a bit differently. Before Tony can launch his sexy shower plan, Steve starts talking:
Steve sits up and allows Tony’s hands to tilt his face up, so they’re making eye contact. Tony smiles a small smile, like he knows a secret, and brings the tip of his erection to Steve’s plaint mouth.
Once Steve is settled, his back to Tony’s chest, Tony starts: “I wanted to ask where you’re at, check-in. We did a lot in the last 24 hours and I know we had that blip in the shower. What did we do that you liked, what didn’t you like? Do you have questions?”
“Fuck. Friday, make a note, we need to outfit everyone with traditional comms units on missions, to act as a backup. I thought to test them in space, but space doesn’t have fucking wind. Also, see if you can find a way to amplify the signal, we need to get back online.”
After his long, cramped flight, and the tension of confronting Tony the shower is absolute heaven. Tony begins to slide the soapy cloth down his neck and shoulders, down to his pecks. He circles each nipple several times, alternating first one, then the other. Steve gasps and some of the loose, relaxed feeling is replaced by a delicious tension. Tony tilts down a bit a sucks at one of the soapy nubs, biting lightly.
She’s been incredible. She actually understands the whole “man out of time” thing, but doesn’t focus on it. She also understood when he said that they should take things slow. That he wasn’t… well he basically confessed to only ever having kissed one girl before, and that it wasn’t much. He really has no idea how to be in a relationship, and she’s made him feel like that’s okay.
They portal to Wakanda to take stock, only to find that Thanos' army is assembling and beginning to test the massive forcefield that protects it.
He can’t… how has Tony done this? Just… changed his life as casually as suggesting what to eat for lunch...
“Ab-bup-bup!” Tony interrupts whatever JARVIS is about to say. He can’t handle hearing his AI’s opinion on mutual unfulfilled erections. “Mute, JARVIS… also, yes to the jets.”
Tony's not an “everything happens for a reason” type person, but he can’t deny that where he’s ended up is pretty fucking great. And Wanda is trying. And she cares about Vision, who is like a son-friend-creation to Tony. So he guesses they’re something like family.
And Tony has no problem with that, far from it, but he also doesn’t want to create a one-sided dynamic. He’s already older, and definitely way more experienced than Steve. If this is more than a one-night thing for Steve (and Tony is guessing it is, because it’s Steve), there’s a lot to navigate. And they already have a shit-ton of baggage to work through totally separate from sex.
Tony steps forward, “Okay so first of all, her name is Wanda, and she’s probably not keen on being called a witch? But yeah she should be at the compound with Vision and Black Widow. Scott, aka Ant Man, aka the Shrinking Man, is probably at home sitting down to breakfast with his kid. I can easily pull up satellite images for both locations for you to get a visual.”
Steve helps him pack for Hawaii (though he notices he leaves his silk boxers in the drawer for Tony to pack himself). He’s still sore, but the thought of a few days in paradise with Steve is making things a lot better.
Steve rubs the back of his neck to do something with his hands. “I don’t know what to say. I know that’s stupid… I’ve been thinking about what I want to say to you for months. I’ve wanted to see you, talk to you.”
Tony is completely blissed out and speaks without thinking “Fucking Christ, I love you, this is why I want to marry you…”
It’s cute and a little heart-breaking the look of soft surprise Steve gets whenever anyone readily accepts their relationship. Tony isn’t naive, he knows there will be some negative reactions if and when they go public, but for now he relishes every positive one that helps pull Steve further and further from the time he grew up in.
Bruce must have a deer in the headlights expression, because Steve continues: “Not that I expect you to have any answers or anything… I mean I haven’t even really explained yet… I just. I really need some advice here. I have no idea what I’m doing and I’ve handled this whole thing so terribly.”
Tony gasps as Steve scrapes the sensitive area lightly with a thumbnail, and he can feel himself getting hard. He wonders if Steve will acknowledge it.
Steve takes the lube and uses it to open himself in now well-practiced movements. Two months ago he’d never had more than a single fingertip inside himself, but after the tower he invested in some decent lube and became intimately familiar with this part of his anatomy.
“Huh, okay keep me posted Fri.” Tony turns to the kid. “Here’s the thing, Steve and I aren’t ready for prime time yet, so sure, tell Ned and get your $20, but keep it need-to-know alright?”
But, I have been drawn over to the Knives Out fandom and am going to be writing for that over the next however long (Chris Evans you sexy minx!). So if that's your thing check it out! If not, I'll return to Steve/Tony likely later this year or in 2021. Thanks for all the comments and support 🙂
“Don’t worry, it’s still soap and perfectly hygienic. All my soaps are edible, it helps to keep thigs lick-able in the shower I find.”
“Fucking, fuck! Damn it Steve!” Steve glances over to see what is clearly Tony’s erection straining against the heavy covers. He can’t help but laugh, even though he isn’t really in any better shape, grinding down a little into the somehow soft yet firm million dollar mattress.
They have the largest pieces of a unification plan settled; the rest will need to develop once Steve returns to his half of the team and Tony has worked more on the amendments. Tony makes a note to provide Steve with an untraceable Stark phone. According to their plan they will probably be separated for at least a month, maybe longer. Tony wonders where Steve stands on phone sex…
Wanda shushes him and their happy chatter fades away as Tony and Steve head back to the suite, hand in hand.
Flashes of every sex act imaginable flit in and out of his brain as he starts to feel the beginnings of that final rush of heat. But that’s not what would happen yet. No, they’re taking things slow. Who would have thought that would be so fucking hot? Imaginary Steve continues to stroke him, slowly rubbing his thigh and the side of his torso with his other hand, still pressed so close. He’s pressing as close as possible now, crowding Tony toward the glass. He slides his free hand down from Tony’s side over his ass, squeezing slightly.
“Okay I can agree to that, good call about Wanda and Viz.” says Steve. “So… who should we talk to first? It will probably spread pretty quickly once we start…”
He’s probably not going to convince Tony to hold off on telling Rhodey. And what would be the point now that Scott knows anyway? Can’t put the genie back in the bottle as they say… and Tony is about as crazy as that blue genie from the Arabian cartoon movie. And he sort of has the facial hair for it already...
Steve turns his head away from the wall to look behind him and see Tony kneeling again. Steve can't remember Tony ever kneeling in his dreams but it is quite the sight...
It’s painfully adorable to see Tony all awkward like this. Tony is never awkward. Rushed. Rude. Pushy. Sarcastic. These are his usual go-tos when he’s feeling a bit out of his element. He knows Tony is just nervous about saying or doing the wrong thing and pushing him away (he just told him, in between kisses…), so he decides to take the lead.
He starts at the bottom, picking up Steve’s foot, lovingly scrubbing between the toes, around the ankle and up, and up until he’s at that delicious juncture between Steve’s torso and leg. A harsh V of muscle points like a fucking beacon to Steve’s aching cock. Tony bites that juncture, teasing, before moving on and away down to the other foot.
Steve presses on, sensing that he’s in a losing battle. “Well, I mean of course we are happy to spend time with you Thor but-“
The pleasure from the silken pressure against his cock combined with the feeling of Tony heavy in his mouth and throat again sweeps away everything else. Why was he upset? His body acts of its own accord, gyrating in a fluid pattern, bending forward to take Tony into his mouth, then moving his mouth off and rolling his body down to press his groin roughly against Tony’s leg, then pulling his lower body away again to take Tony down to the root, again and again. Steve is reminded of an exotic belly dancer he saw once in a blue film Bucky dragged him along to. Fuck he’s about to come.
Finally he leans back away from Steve enough to peel the soiled pants off his legs and carefully ball them up before tossing them toward the area of the bar. He goes back to Steve who is still kneeling and wraps his arms around his neck, sliding down to align their bodies until he can capture his mouth.
Tony’s eye glaze over and he lets out a strangled, surprised moan, arching up, pressing his upper body into Steve and his lower body into the empty covers above him.
“I’m more of a consultant really! Luis is handling the day to day, but it’s something we’ve talked about for years and I didn’t want to just abandon him you know? Luis is like, my number one home slice.” Oh god, he just said home slice, get it together, Lang.
Bruce interrupts this time. “Okay Tony, that’s good. I’m going to have you fill out a more detailed questionnaire on your own time.
He rubs his hands up and down Tony's back in a silent apology. Tony hums and presses back against Steve. It's not sexual, just a comforting return of Steve's physical affection, like a cat pressing into the hand of its owner.
Tony snorts. “God as much as I think I would enjoy you fucking me in the shower, the bed is probably a better bet for your first time… It is, it’s your first time with a man, isn’t it?”
This calls for a shower. Tony loves shower sex. In fact, he loves showers in general. When he can afford the time he takes long ones, like epically long. Back in his party-boy 20s, he’d actually gotten a bit of a reputation for his shower orgies. Tony never cared for that term, is 4-5 people an orgy, really? It’s not like his shower is the size of a racquetball court or anything, 6 is really the maximum capacity. That’s just… an intimate group of people having a good time.
Bruce looks troubled, and pulls up another couple of screens. “Here is my blood sample, and Steve’s.”
Steve doesn’t understand. “How is this possible? Are you saying Tony has somehow been injected with the serum? Or injected with small amounts over time?”
“That’s good” says Tony soothingly as he slides the finger out and then in again, in and out. In and out.
Bruce can handle dealing with damaged people. He’s worked with lepers for god’s sake… but he really isn’t -- he just doesn’t really know what to say here.
“And here is the blood sample we have on file from Tony from last year.” The second screen comes up.
It all starts when Steve has the audacity to imply that a robot dog would be, quote: “terrifying.” A robot dog that Tony would create. Ridiculous. This is offensive to Tony on so many levels. Steve
Tony can’t do anything but just relax into Steve’s arms and get kissed for all he’s worth. He can’t believe this, he really should have just called Steve. He could have had this months ago, what an idiot.
Once his breathing calms down he says “I think that’s the fasted I’ve ever come. Even like, counting my teenage years, when I was on a hair trigger. Fuck.”
It’s like Steve is waking from one of his dreams. Everything is harsh and cold compared to the surreal heat of the last two days.
Bruce continues. “Just a few more questions. What is the longest you two have gone without having sex?
Steve kisses Tony to stop his rambling. He’s been dying to kiss him since they started. Playing doctor has been great, but doctors don’t kiss their patients. He’s missed it.
Pepper continues, “As you know I’ve been easing up on my duties as SI CEO for a while. In fact Erin and Jamal are now handling the day-to-day for all our major divisions. And well, when I turned thirty I had some eggs frozen. I wasn’t dating anyone at the time, I was working 90-hour weeks as an assistant for a crazy person…” here she winks at Tony, “and I just figured it would be a while before kids would be something I’d get to.”
He has no idea what Tony has pushed in his schedule to have this time with Steve uninterrupted. Earlier that day he caught the end of Tony on a call that sounded like it was with Pepper. Tony said something about rescheduling things for next week, and Steve hadn’t wanted to break the spell by asking what he was causing Tony to miss.
“Okay, I’m going to apply the lubricant now, it will be a little cold.” Steve takes the large tube and slathers a generous amount onto two fingers. “Tell me if you feel any discomfort, this shouldn’t be painful, but some people do report burning or tightness.”
He walks into the compound to find Tony and Steve having coffee at the communal area bar. Steve looks flushed, like he just got done exercising.
He’s not sure what will make Steve feel uncomfortable or pressured, or what will make him feel wanted and happy… he just knows that being around Steve makes everything so immeasurably better.
“It’s alright, because even though things will be awkward with Pepper for a while, I’m glad she knows. And I know you’re embarrassed, but honestly, Pepper was my assistant for a lot of years, and she saw things that were waaaay worse than that.”
But then Tony is pressing against him, sliding the silky soft material of his pant leg against Steve’s length.
“Huh, I guess so…” says Tony, “Wait, ‘In the middle’? Are we only at the mid-way point of this thing?” Tony's eyebrows climb.
Steve and the others are officially pardoned through the approval of the “Sokovia Accords II,” about one month after Steve’s surprise visit to (what was formerly) Stark Tower. Tony
Steve clears his throat, “I’m, I’m so glad you feel that way. I hope you know how sorry I am that everything went the way it did in Germany. That I take full responsibility for not handling the Accords or the situation with Bucky the way I should have.”
“As deep as you can now, but don’t rush. Work up to it slowly, be sure to relax your throat and breathe. Take your time Steve."
Tony motions to the various parts of the shower that changed/moved with his command. “So, the shelves are obviously everything we need to get clean. The baskets on the bottom are usually for when I want to do a little ah, self-care. I haven’t used anything in them with anyone else. In fact, this shower has pretty much seen only solo missions, like, for years. Not sure if that puts you at ease, I don’t want to get us off-course by talking about exes, but yeah, it’s not everyone’s thing and it’s
"We've gone over everything that went wrong before, and realized almost all of it was just because we’re both stubborn idiots that didn’t communicate well.”
“Keep your hands where they are, Steve,” he says and comes around to Steve’s side to slide a hand up to his face and cup his cheek. He guides Steve’s mouth down to his while sliding his other hand down to Steve’s ass. He kisses him just as he slides the tip of his finger down to caress Steve’s opening. Just a gentle touch, probing, testing how much he can slide in before he meets substantial resistance.
“I cannot wait for Gamora to try a Blow Pop!” says Quill. His voice fading into the distance as Tony and Dr. Strange prepare to depart through the portal he’s opened back to New York.
“Keep your hands on the hammer.” He says easily, conversationally like he’s asking Steve to pass a slice of pizza.
After two months, he thinks he understands why Hulk won’t come out, but he’s no closer to actually getting him to emerge. Bruce decides to go back to the New York compound and continue his research there. He might as well be with the team, and if Hulk does decide to show, he’s sure Tony and the rest will help him manage.
“One more thing, we cannot, under any circumstances, bring the one you call Vision here. He has the mind stone, and if Thanos gets ahold of that, our odds go down insurmountably.”
Tony asks him some more questions about his security company, and to Scott’s utter shock and terror, he says “I’d love to be your first customer. Take a week or two and send me your analysis of the compound. I’ll have SI be the official client and they’ll send you over some terms and a contract.” Tony has pulled a pad out of somewhere and has been typing while he talks.
The stones are gone, Thanos’ armies are turned to dust before their eyes, and Thor’s people are alive (though for whatever reason Asgard itself could not come back).
He’d made a point to wear the sunglasses all day, sneaking looks at Steve as they walked and ate. It was almost as good as having the helmet on, or his armor. But when it came time to take pictures with the newlyweds in the park, Steve came up to him and broke into the unspoken one-foot personal bubble he’d kept between them (except for the motorcycle ride), neatly taking them off his face.
Tony shakes himself and responds. “I feel good. I think seeing it like this... Seeing you prepare before we start helps.” Tony pauses, never taking his eyes off of Steve’s cock as it continues to pump through his hand. “I’ve heard... I’ve heard sometimes the procedure can be done orally. Am I candidate for that?”
Suddenly having a naked Steve here in front of him makes Tony relax and get things into perspective. “Hey, hey, come on Captain Beautiful, we’re alright.”
Most of the team is out and about anyway. He does find Black Widow reading in her room on her bed. She pauses and looks up at the vent when he lands there to take stock of the room. Her eyes narrow and stay on the vent for a few seconds. She goes back to readying but Scott can tell she’s on guard.
Tony smiles, leaning up to bump his nose against Steve’s. “I can follow rules, when I have the motivation.”
Although he’s never had any issues, he is slightly wary that he might not be able to get going, given the circumstances.
Steve takes Tony in his lubed palm and strokes a few times, spreading the rest of it around. Not having a towel and not wanting to ruin the comforter, he wipes the remainder off on his own stomach. Maybe it’s a hold-over from having to hide his late-night emissions while on the run, but Steve hates the idea of making a mess on Tony’s fancy bedding.
helping me out, but I don’t want it like that. I don’t want to feel like you’re, like you’re just going through the motions, or getting me off like some kind of…” Steve can’t finish.
Bruce dissolves into giggles and everyone else dog piles into the center of the room to wrestle with the best robotic dog ever.
“Yes, Steve, I’m almost there, you’re amazing, holding me like this.” Tony reaches down to where he and Steve are joined to swipe some of the copious lube and slick moisture that’s gathered there. Tony can tell this is going to be fast, even though he’s only been hard again for a short time.
Tony’s gasping, and flushed, and he is the most beautiful thing Steve has ever seen. He licks his lips and tilts his head to the side before saying “Steve – I didn’t… I didn’t say that so we would—“ he looks down at where their bodies are inches from connecting and sighs pressing against Steve with his hands to get Steve’s body off of him. “Fuck. We’re taking it slow, right?”
After a while he clears his throat. He’d like to stay here just like this, but his knees are already starting to complain (stupid fancy thin rug that isn’t even that soft). And although Steve has super-soldier knees, he’s been on them a lot longer and probably wouldn’t mind getting up.
Tony relaxes into it and let’s his mind drift. They do this sometimes, Steve fucking him while he’s soft. Steve gets hard and stays hard more than any normal person would or could. Sometimes he comes in Tony two or three times before Tony does once, but sometimes Tony doesn’t wait and lays back spent and saited while Steve continues to take him. As long as he isn’t sore or over-sensitive it’s nice, like he’s giving himself over to Steve completely.
- Tony teases Nebula more and finds out she has a crush (Captain Marvel? Bucky? Sam? ... Loki? They are both blue, hmm)
Bruce thinks back to the quarantine, and how Steve spent most of the time anxiously checking his Stark pad. And his grin when it would chime indicating he got a letter. And how he would draw Tony constantly, making a show of having Bruce see every drawing he did of something that was
“But yeah, I mean I’ve been working on a plan and if you’re serious about figuring things out together I think we can… figure it out, together." Tony continues to pace. "I’ve been working with my lawyers and some of the higher ups in Wakanda actually. They are masters of working around the red tape that world governments like to throw up, and they also have a lot of keen insights about wielding massive power in a world that isn’t really prepared for it. We’re drafting some really slick amendments to the accords and if we can get them to pass, it will basically be the best of both worlds. It will protect Wakanda from external interference and provide the Avengers and other select groups with autonomy. Real autonomy, but with a protective layer between us and anyone that wants to claim our super-powers gave them cancer or whatever bullshit arises next from our adoring public.” Tony throws up three screens to show the progress he’s made so far.
Next up, Scott joins the team at the compound... And accidentally becomes a peeping Tom. Both things are exciting and upsetting in different ways for him.
Tony comes back at him in retaliation with everything he has, his nanoparticles turning his entire lower half into a battering ram. “Hands off the merchandise, Frankenberry. He’s mine!”
It was the shirt that did it, Tony realizes in horror. It’s so clean, and makes Steve looks so fucking good. It was easy to imagine the shirt as a lab coat, and well, here they are.
Steve kisses his lips, almost chastely. “I said, thank you for today. And all the days since the tower. I hope you know how amazing you’ve been. How happy you make me.” He moves to straddle Tony’s hips fully, sitting lightly on his upper thighs, careful not to put his full weight down.
As they finally pull up to the main house Tony slips the driver a few hundreds and says they don’t need help with the bags. There are only five, and even though the car service is top of the line, he doesn’t want a stranger going inside.
He puts a hand on Tony’s armored shoulder. Needing to feel him there, to be sure they really made it through.
Nebula doesn’t hate him. After the loss of Gamora she is quite adrift, and is comforted by these strange, annoying, soft,
“I got some messages from Sam. On my phone... which I basically ignored for two days” Steve rubs the back of his neck, embarrassed. He and Tony have accomplished a lot in the past two days, but they’ve also been going at it like bunnies. It feels a bit like he’s been skipping school.
Bruce is wrapping the entire hand in gauze now, and with a final snip it’s covered. Tony gets up and breezes by Steve, who still hasn’t said anything. Tony hasn’t looked him in the eye and doesn’t plan to.
Tony is completely speechless. He can’t remember that ever happening before. Oh yeah, except like five minutes ago when Steve dropped to his knees in the middle of their fight…
was thinking about all those stupid tabloid stories about his “orgies.” So yeah the shower has been the source of a lot of fun for him, but this is the first time he’s gotten someone in here with him in years, and it’s
“Oh, isn't it Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? Is it a movie too? I have a list… but I’ve actually been reading a lot of children’s fiction… it’s nice, it keeps my mind occupied but there’s never anything in them that makes me think of the bad stuff, you know?”
Tony is blissed out, just leaning back against Steve with his eyes closed and his mouth agape in pleasure. Steve notices the shower doesn’t seem to be hitting them with water, more like the entire stall has filled with a warm, pleasant mist.
“If I were a sharing kind of guy, you’d be in-like-Flynn, Scott.” He squeezes his shoulder. “But I’m not, and neither is Steve.”
The Smoochvengers (this one is Tony’s favorite and he secretly has Friday order and save a hard copy)
He slides the gauntlet on and gasps. Sparking lines of power emanate from the stones, through the glove and up his arm. He drops to his knees.
As they pull up to the gate that marks the start of the private road only accessible by Vibranium-level Stark-card clearance, Steve’s eyes widen. Maybe he thought they were going to some five-star hotel like they were in Japan? Well, why have access to one of the most beautiful, modern, exclusive (Pepper is the only other Vibranium-level Stark-card holder) beach bungalows in the world if you can’t use it?
Wanda is able to remove it from the bridge with her magic and Falcon and Vision distract it while Tony stuns it with an electric shock. The port authority helps wrap the unconscious plant-creature in a net and it’s taken away to be held in a containment unit for further study.
Peter shoots webs, Quill shoots guns, Drax stabs, Mantis drops out of one of Strange's portals directly above to grab Thanos' head and make him groggy. Nebula shows up and attacks him with the pent-up rage stored from of a lifetime of abuse.
Sam snorts, and Steve playfully elbows Tony in the ribs, even though he’s already in the armor and can’t feel it.
He wouldn’t do this if he didn’t have anything to go on, but his strategic mind has pinged a few times throughout their conversation:
“Sex, when it’s with someone you care about like I care about you, isn’t about getting off. That’s a really fun part of it sometimes, but the
After he’s explored every inch of Tony’s chest, Steve takes Tony’s hips in his hands and slowly walks him back to the bed. Not using any force really, just moving into his space until Tony suddenly finds the backs of his legs hitting the bed. He uses the same gentle pressure to lay Tony out on his back. Tony is shocked to feel that his eyes are beginning to sting.
During the battle Clint reveals over the coms that Cap is dating Becky, which Tony didn’t know, and he burns his hand whilst distracted. T_T
check in. I’m pretty sure you would check in from the grave. But you suddenly disappear to see Tony and then go unresponsive for 48 hours? Of course, you were knocking boots.”
Hopefully the re-existance of Morgan is a pleasant surprise (with bonus Steves!baby, name TBD haha). I know this is a lot of fluff, but eh, that was sort of the point of this fic, total wish fulfillment. I really tried to fix as much as I possibly could, but no matter what there just wasn't a way to save Gamora... It's up to the reader if they believe if Thor's wish brought Loki back. I say yes, because Gamora's fate was tied to the soul stone but I'd like to think the infinity stones could bring back someone who just died. Also RIP Thor's arm. My thinking was that since Thor basically made three huge wishes at once, that's why it damaged him so badly. Poor Thor, a fake eye and a fake arm now haha.
Both Peter and Scott exclaim at the same moment “It’s just like the lightsaber training remotes in Star Wars!”
“Tony, you and Dr. Strange go get Wanda and Scott. If we’re lucky Sam has already worked with Wong to get them to the sanctum. Dr. Strange, while you’re there explain the plan to them in full. Tony, blast the plan to the rest of the team on all channels, make sure everyone knows Vision needs to be kept in containment. Maybe T'Challa would be willing to protect him in Wakanda? War machine and anyone else we can spare should stay with him in case Thanos' army makes a separate play for the mind stone.”
Ahhh! That's it! As I've said, I think there is more to come in this series ... There's more time to write what with the pandemic, so while there is still interest I'll keep this going.
Tony considers recording their encounter for just a moment, before telling Friday “Total blackout keyed to my codes. If a world-ending Avengers-assemble threat occurs patch it through.”
, and yes, even when you were with Pepper it was there lurking under the surface. So yes, I am not surprised. The way you and Steve fought… everything was always too personal. Too heated to just be animosity. Plus he’s pretty much all you’ve talked about for the last month. Like I know you care about the Accords, but every call has been ‘Steve said this…’ ‘Steve thinks that…’” He nods sagely.
A different kind of pleasure floods through Steve now, even the visual of Tony’s now damp leg doesn’t embarrass him the way it would have a few minutes ago. Because he’s perfect.
It’s a universal “what now?” gesture, and Steve still doesn’t know, but he can’t keep standing around like a mannequin.
Scott chuckles and Steve gives Sam a raised eyebrow. Tony checks his watch; Vision and Nat stare blankly.
Tony shrugs, as much as you can shrug with a naked, two-hundred-pound man on top of you. “He died about five years after my parents, natural causes. Peggy knew him actually; I learned a lot after he died by going through his things. They went on all kinds of adventures.”
He doesn’t. Steve continues to slowly press his hands down the length of Tony’s torso, eventually stopping at the vulnerable area around the base of his errection. Steve uses both hands to press gently against the exposed area, not touching his errection, but applying light pressure where Tony's stomach meets his groin.
in college, and those sheets were a gift from Jarvis when I was a kid. They meant a lot to me, and it wasn’t just because they had your shield on them. I basically used them until they disintegrated. Pretty gross actually…”
I am also curious for how this reads for people who haven't read '1796 Broadway' (and for those who have, I guess, haha!). I once again want to really thank the authors for being so open about allowing ancillary works; I love this Steve and Tony, and look forward to reading the "real" conclusion as it plays out :)
“Platform base up ten inches” says Tony. The area he is standing on in front of Steve’s platform raises him up the aforementioned amount.
It’s enough to make Steve pause. Dream-Tony was always commanding, very in control. The idea that Steve can do whatever he wants with Tony is a bit overwhelming. He moves off Tony a bit so he can look up at him, bringing his hands around to the silken strings that keep his insanely soft pants up.
As usual Tony hasn’t paid much attention to what he has said, and is about to ask why his foot is being held hostage.
Steve lays his palm on the side of the box to be scanned and clears his throat to utter the last known password he has.
His temple throbs as he considers that Steve probably hasn’t been half as tortured these past months as he has. Maybe he’s been sitting in his little hide-outs, surrounded by his like-minded cronies bemoaning how long it’s taking selfish Tony to come around to his point of view.
Tony clears his throat and speaks, aware that he can’t really expect Steve to do all the heavy lifting. “Will do, thanks doc, I can tell I’m in good hands.” He grins at Steve and wiggles his eyebrows a bit. Tony has no doubt that “patient Tony” would flirt with Dr. Steve.
It’s almost midnight by the time he makes it to the tower. He looks up to see the Avenger's  A is no longer positioned at the top… from what Clint told him he thought it might be gone, but he hoped it wouldn't be. It feels like the end, such a tangible symbol of the team they used to be, taken down like it was never there.
Tony’s breathing hitches at that. Steve slowly moves his hands over Tony’s body. It feels like such a luxury to have time. They’ve only been at the compound together for two weeks, but it feels like longer, having to constantly keep track of who is home, always ready to break apart at a moment’s notice so they wouldn’t get caught.
Tony isn’t 100% sure what the right thing is, but for right now, for Steve, he’ll take a step back, and take his sunglasses off, and just enjoy watching him drink from his lion cup.
He swallows, hoping to jar Tony out of his rage with his own abasement. He’s not thinking anymore, just acting on instinct.
Talking to Clint while they were on the run gave Scott a lot of perspective. Clint spent a lot of years balancing being a hero and a family man. Clint retiring is the right call for him, but he encouraged Scott to give The Avengers a chance (not that he needed any more encouragement). He thought about it long and hard, and decided Cassie would rather have a hero for a dad than a struggling ex-con. Plus, before Scott went on the run, he was seeing Cassie a few times a month, max. He's hoping he can be an Avenger and still see her often.
He rolls over and puts it out of his mind. He knows even they can’t solve the problems of the entire multiverse.
He gets to ride Steve’s motorcycle and go to the zoo and have the most perfect day he's had since everything blew apart with Pepper.
Instinct that has been informed by months of dreams where Tony fucks him within an inch of his life. So. Maybe not the most sane move.
Hooray, this story is closing in on 100 Kudos which was a little goal I made for myself (well actually my initial goal was 10 haha)! Thanks for reading everyone, I think there are two chapters to go and maybe an epilogue.
“Apologies Captain, you’re spacial awareness and observation skills are usually quite apt, I had assumed you would ascertain the situation on your own upon entering.”
Tony seems unaware he is doing anything differently; it’s Peter that calls attention to it one evening.
He remembers what he wrote when he first found out they were writing, that Steve should probably find someone a little more ‘age-appropriate’… someone who ‘hasn’t slept with half of Manhattan.’
Steve firmly grips Tony's ass and clears his throat. “If you’re comfortable, I’d like to try another technique. It’s a bit unorthodox…” Steve doesn’t wait for an answer before lowering his mouth to Tony’s eager hole. He swipes at it, laving it with saliva. He doesn’t move, speaking directly into the tender skin “This technique isn’t technically allowed, as it’s still experimental. They only do it in Europe.”
Once Steve calms down, Tony starts again: “This, the you and me thing… it may be complicated. I don’t want anyone on the team to doubt our ability to work together, or to feel like there are any conflicts of interest. And… I don’t know how you feel about everyone knowing. About us.”
Tony sobers and quickly pulls Steve into a hug. “I’m sorry. You’re right. We’ll figure it out, Bruce is on the case.”
Rocket has stuck close to Thor in Quill’s absence. They go in to the city with some regularity, where Thor is such a big celebrity that people don’t even glance at the talking racoon. After Thor he actually seems to get along with Rhodey best. Though Rhodey is suspicious that Rocket's interest seems centered around his leg braces, and if they are detachable, and if he wears them at night.
The bedding is smooth and silky, and looks very expensive. Steve knows better than to ask how much it costs, if he doesn’t want nightmares about how many people could be fed for what Tony spends on something like bed sheets.
“Like what, Steve? Like some kind of a whore?” Tony’s tone is sharper, and Steve feels stung. He didn’t mean to call Tony that! That’s the opposite of what he’s saying.
“Most impressive! Rocket, Tony is one of Earth’s mightiest heroes, and among their most intelligent beings as well, right up there with my ex, Jane, of course.”
If he makes love to Becky, that’s what it will be… and right now he just can’t be certain that’s really where his heart is at. Once he talks with Tony, he’ll at least know where they stand, and whether he can see himself taking that step.
about money. Is Avenging a paid gig? How can he ask without sounding like a total dick? All those flights out to San Francisco and back are going to add up…
Yep, he needs to get Steve up off the ground now before he gets an embarrassing erection which his incredibly thin and expensive lounge pants won’t do anything to hide.
Steve lowers Tony’s body back down to the bed and slides his hands up to the juncture where Tony’s hands have been gripping his own legs to keep himself open. He pulls Tony’s hands back and replaces them with his own, holding Tony's legs back a bit more. He just holds him open there, taking a moment to look at the result of his efforts on Tony’s entrance.
Steve wraps a firm hand around himself. “This is what’s going to be inserted inside you,” Steve narrates, as if his cock isn’t a cock at all but a piece of medical equipment. “First I need to apply the lube so that it won’t hurt you. Next, I need to ensure it’s in working order, replicating the procedure movements before moving on to inserting it into you.”
Tony nods, fuck, he isn’t the only one who has been thinking about this. Steve’s working from an obviously prepared, and highly realistic script. Tony can’t believe how in-character he is right from the start. He’s just a fucking natural. Look out Meryl Streep.
LASS-E makes a small yip of delight and puts one paw up on her bent knee, before tilting up to give three persistent licks to Natasha’s face.
Steve, still too embarrassed to try to understand Tony’s manic thought process, just snuggles deeper and asks “Why?”
They’ve sequestered themselves in the suite since the news broke, just laying around and blocking out everything else (the whole team seems to suddenly have a renewed interest in teasing them, though they’ve known about them since shortly after the reunification). When Tony tries to apologize all he can get out is “I know the timing sucks, but I thought you were dead, or dying, so… I regret nothing.”
Steve holds in a groan and settles back down onto the mattress. Tony’s right. He nods and huffs a breath, settling down again into his pillow. His arm is still thrown around Tony, but his mind is too busy to do much else.
He uses what Tony has dubbed his “Captain Voice,” they don’t have much time and that’s always guaranteed to set Tony off. “We have about five minutes to get going before we can’t make the curtain. So here’s what we’re going to do,” Tony his opening his own pants, nodding in agreement and anticipation.
