"That is why we mated" Jack said
“Alright, one quick coffee and then I come back to work” said Dean
They locked eyes and Castiel found himself accepting the offer. He moved the next day, gave notice on both his jobs and that same week Dean showed him the rope of his new possition. It all seemed too good to be true...
"She is right, we should let them rest" said Castiel letting Claire hold the baby "love you Claire, I am very proud of you"
When Castiel arrived to the bookstore, Dean was behind the counter finishing the last posts in social media announcing the event tomorrow. When he heard the door open he looked up from the computer to find Castiel staring with those magnetic blues.
"Almost ten years ago, cancer" Dean said "Working here turned out to be too much for me without her, my brother was finishing his degree and he took over the shop. He has updated it, has very active social media page, the business goes well" said Dean
Castiel stood up and went straight to hug his little baby
Dean and Cass went back home and ... well one thing let to another. Castiel had a sexy surprise for Dean, he had bought some fancy lingerie and lets say Dean was very enthusiastic while fucking him with the garther still on that had bitten Cass while knotting him. And that caused them to simultaneously go into a sudden heat and rut.
“Can you sit here with me? There is something we need to talk about” said Cass and Dean frowned
Castiel blushed hard  "Goodnight Dean"
" I guess I graduated from Sammy to uncle Sam?" He said mocking his brother.
"Never been more sure of anything my love" Castiel answered
“Ja! I can´t believe it, I am rushing to get the doctor. Dean, keep an eye on him so he doesn´t disconnect from the machines!” Meg rushed outside.
They did agree on two names: Jack or Claire.
He was sitting in the couch. Dean went to the kitchen "babe is there anything you want from here?"
They joke that once done they will open the Winchester & Winchester law firm.
“I don´t feel ok” another male voice said and both Dean and Meg bolted to look at Cass who was now looking at them both with his blue eyes and a confused look.
"Your what now?!" he asked
“Oliver Winchester, has a nice ring” said Cass “I like it”
It was the middle of the night when Case woke up to the feeling he was peeing himself but soon realized his water had just broken, he woke Dean up.
“Hope is the only thing there is left” she said.
"Castiel, can I ask you did the alpha leave you once you told him you were pregnant? Why did you decided to have Claire nonetheless taking into account what society would do to you both...?
"That is exactly the underlying theme of the books, Angels are warriors without a leader. They had gotten sick with the same sins as humankind" The writes explained
There was a man there but he was not the receptionist.
They went to bed together. Both naked except for their boxers they laid in bed in each other´s arms. Joyfully kissing and scenting each other. Dean licked over the mating mark and Cass closed his eyes enjoying the attention. He was home in Dean´s arms and they had built a big family together. Maybe with more babies to come ... who knew.
During the first three months of his recovery, when he felt with enough energy they had exchanged blow jobs and handjobs in the shower, a couple of mornings Dean had rutted against his ass while masturbating him… but he was now ready for the real deal. He roamed around the house making sure they had enough food and supplies, cooked a nice dinner and waited for Dean to come home. When he started to feel better and was able to handle life by himself, he had encouraged Dean to look for a job, Dean had reluctantly looked due to Cass´s encouragement and luckily he had found a great job on a big company putting his engineering degree at good use.
"Well i bought you diner and we are sitting by the fire sipping hot chocolate... I would say it is quite romantic right? I do know how to treat a guy" said Dean casually flirting back
"No" grouchy Castiel said
The following day, he went to the hospital as every morning, spend the morning telling Cass about the repairs that he was doing in their house, read a magazine and watch tv. He went out for lunch and returned to the hospital to tend to Cass´s needs, bath, shave, new pajamas... everything. Then it was time for him to meet his brother and Jessica at the Soho cafe down the street. Dean walked there and entered the hipster cafe that smelled like good coffee.
Oh fuck those green eyes.
"Whoa whoa, I am not letting my baby daughter here alone... she is coming home with me" said Castiel
"Will they be alright?" Asked Jack
" you already do" whispered Cass falling asleep in Dean's arms.
"I washed myself and walked home" Cass said "I told mom everything and she lost it. She locked me in my bedroom for weeks, not that I could or wanted to go anywhere. Then  once my face was back to normal she let me out like nothing has happened, she expected me to go back to school. I had a panick attack and I was taken to the hospital where it was discovered that I was pregnant. She went home and let me there like she didn't kne who I was" Cass said "i meant nothing to her"
"Claire, claire wake up" he shook her. His Alpha slept like the dead.
"Hey dad" said Claire from the couch
“Shuuuu listen to me, if you feel like you need more time, I can stop this heat, take the pills and we will do this another time” Cass said
And the stick showed two lines. Jack looked at it with panic. Claire was pale.
“When you saved me and mom we were very confused and we realized that maybe if you could see Cass… but when we realized he was pregnant we were not willing to risk them…” said Sam
"Oh Jack" Claire said kissing him softly.
"I love you Dean, forever" He kissed his mate and they cuddled in bed together.
Sam and Jess went to the hospital, floor 9 “Long-term care” area. They looked at each other. A nurse approach them “Who are you looking for?” she asked softly
“My silly alpha… for 5 years you have come here every day for hours on end… reading to me…” Cass said and Dean melted onto him, Sam slipped outside to give them some time… after so many years, they deserved to catch up.
“Am I at the hospital?... there was a bomb….” Cass said his voice sounded dry “Can I get some water”
“I am good, how is our angel doing? Hello Cass” she said checking on the machines. “Everything is good and about the tux, on Gardenia road there is a second hand shop and they get a loto f wedding stuff, my mate bought a nice tux there, only used once for almost no money, and it was perfect, very elegant” She smiled politely
"One minute and the receptionist will be with you which one is your car?" He asked
"Gabriel?" Castiel asked
Jack couldn´t say if it was the mating or the baby that him buzzing on the inside. They were heading to Claire´s home to break the news to her dad and later they would try his home. He should be afraid but Claire was holding his hand, his other hand over his flat belly he felt over the moon. The arrived home, nobody was there, they sat on the couch and barely ten minutes later Castiel Novak, Claire´s dad entered the house from his late shift at the coffee shop.
Thank you all for reading it, I know it is not beta-ed and will never be. So thanks for being so awesome despite its imperfections.
“I am so tired all the time? I wish we could make love…” Cass whines and his scent changed a little sour. Dean caressed his face softly
They both left the store and walked side by side to the Roadhouse diner where Dean had said he could find  the best burgers in the whole world. Castiel love burgers so there they went, ordered burgers and stayed until the owner kicked them out. They were so happy together, they fit perfectly. Castiel slipped his hand on Dean´s while walking back to the hotel. And Dean felt like his heart was skipping beats.
Once at the door of the hotel, Dean kissed Castiel softly in the lips and whispered "Goodnight angel"
Since the moment Dean had said yes he was planning to betray him. He was planning on using Dean to take over the world again, only this time better. But to be honest he was not ready to feel this way. Dean fucking Winchester has a great sense of loyalty, his word was to be trusted and he felt responsible for others and that filtered into Michael´s mind. He hated to feel that pang of guilt when he did things Dean would have never do.  Sometimes he felt Dean shame filter into his mind and internally he felt that he was disappointed that Dean felt that way towards him... somehow he wanted Dean to admire him and he was failing at that big time.
' what if I am never able of having sex with you?" Asked Cass
Dean meets the Angel of thrusday and he meets Castiel, his creator. Can he fall in love with both?
“Cas?” Dean said in wonder “Cass babe, do you…
"Is everything alright? Cass?' He asked
The drugs in their system made the sleep but it was unrested and uncomfortable, a little over midnight Dean walked to Cass's room and opened the door. Cass looked horrible all bruised and he was whimpering like having a nightmare. Sitting by his side he held his hand an felt immediately better. Cass also seemed to rest better. Dean was afraid he had been close to losing his omega again. He kissed Castiel's hand before realizing what he was doing.and he whispered "mate"
It starts describing the angel Misha learning to be human, Dean felt terribly for him, imagining how incomprehensible normal human things could feel for him. The ex angel, Misha started a journey back to Jensen, only to learn that his love was indeed dead. His brother Jared had buried his body so when Misha made it back home, hungry cold and afraid, there was only a simple tombstone to hug. No Jensen, no hope, just despair as he realized that his sacrifice had been for nothing and now he had a human life to live without his love.
“I need to talk to Dean” said the man
His scent of protective alpha filled the car and made Cass smile. He placed his hand over Dean´s leg while driving to give him strength and that calmed him down a little. Their little angels were sleeping soundly in their seats and the drive home from the hospital was peaceful. Once home, the mess started. Cries, naps, feedings, diapers, no sleep ... but they were happy and the first months passed very fast. Their babies were home and they were healthy and they had two! which had been quite a surprise but wow... they were a family of four and even after almost three months, he was still in awe.
“Hey handsome” said Dean rushing to his side
"I do dream about you, us, together too" he admitted
Gabriel was nervous, he had decided that he wanted to see in person, no more PI. He needed to know if Winchester's omega was his brother as his wife has suggested. Her description  was on point and she had only known Cassie from pictures but ... was it possible? He parked out front the Garage and went in the reception.
“The body is empty, the man died of a heart attack outside a bar. In here it is just me” he said and Dean looked at him with an intriguing light in his eyes and Michael felt a pang of hope. “I came to give you this” He tended a piece of paper towards Dean. There was a rune written on it. Dean hesitated but Castiel who was behind his husband looked at it “It is a protection sigil in Enochian, it is safe”
Sam and Jess looked at him, Sam remembered that name… in had been written at the back of a picture Dean had send him during the war.
(Just little teaser, it will have 10 chapters)
Finally, we should be thankful for each other. The friendships that we have made here will last a lifetime. In the same way we have supported each other and helped each other succeed in these years at Peterson, I hope we will continue to provide support and encouragement for each other in future endeavors. Here I found my mate, Claire. There isn't a more wonderful Alpha over the face of the earth, I am grateful for having her by my side.
"Not always" said Castiel making Dean remember.
“You got a good one there, you would have to ask him about the things he has done for you… he really loves you no matter what” Gabe said
Two weeks later, after intense physical therapy and a lot of care from his mate Castiel was allowed to go home with Dean, he will continue to attend to daily sessions of physical therapy and weekly doctor check-ups until they were sure things were alright. Dean was so happy, his scent smelled like recently baked pie, fresh cut grass and home. Cass wanted to go home to Dean so badly, he just wanted to start his life with his mate. He had lost 5 years of his life! How unfair!
“Oh come on Sam, he needs a date for the weeding and maybe something else would spark, I think I know exactly the right Omega for him” Jess beamed with excitement and Sam thought Why not, he would really like to see his brother happy.
Alma and Omega coupled immediately,  nothing like any dark memory from that first time. Cass felt the pleasure rip through his body as he came untouched for the first time when he felt Dean lick at his mating gland while thrusting deep in him, his knot beginning to inflate. Bigger and bigger.
"Where is Dean?" He asked
That night while Cass was rightfully resting, Dean was seated by the crib where Jack and Claire were sleeping. They were so perfect, both had black hair like Cass and their skin was very pale. He inhaled their scents. Finally he was whole again.
“Honey I don´t think this is a good idea” said Sam
"It belonged to my dad, I learned how to drive in there and when I got my license the first thing I did was to fulfill a promise. I drove my little brother to lake Melton" he said and saw how the other man had tensed and turned to look at the with wide eyes. Older, stronger and very pregnant, after 18 years his little brother Castiel was finally in front of him.
"OMG congratulations! I am calling Eileen right now!"
“I am proud of you guys” said Sam.
Dean got rid of his pajamas and stood there completely naked, his alpha cock standing proud. Castiel sliked some more.
"Will you be able to fix it?" Asked Gabe to Dean
"Hey papa, is everything alright? Benny asked hugging him back
Dean was sitting in a chair by a bed. He was holding a man´s hand and was speaking softly to him while leaning into his touch “I love you so much sweetheart, I would like to see those electric blue eyes again, your gummy smile and hear your horrible sense of humor... I miss you babe, I miss you every minute of every day. I had a bad moment with Sammy today, he tried to set me up with an omega” Cass´s scent turned sour immediately, Dean smiled feeling that his mate was still there with him “Don´t worry baby, no Omega can hold a candle to you, I told him I didn´t need anybody and I ended up showing him my mating bite. I think I will bring him over soon, so he can meet you. Would you be ok with that?” Dean asked and kissed him softly on the lips “Good night Cass, I will be back first thing tomorrow” Dean stood and got out of the room to find his brother and girlfriend there.
"If has been five months since you crossed that door and I have been slowly falling in love with you" said Dean making Cass blush
"No dad, I just worry about this. Not so long ago it was just the two of us, not we are mated, babies on the way? ... Dean if your him, my kid will not have a grandpa to play with because I would kill you! Capice?
“Hi Dean!, wow you are way more handsome that Jess had told me!” Lisa beamed and suddenly Dean realized what was happening here.
"So what now? "Asked Castiel
He got the book from a huge pile at his brother's shop, the title "The angel of thrusday" well ... people were excited about the reading and signing so... how bad can the book be?
"Hey Cassie. I can't believe it" Gabriel was about to hug Cass when Dean stopped him harshly.
"You may not get to term if something goes wrong Castiel" said the doc
"Now mate, I am going to make love to you all night long" said Dean making castiel slick with anticipation.
“Only five minutes more, please... I am not done today” begged Dean. Those were the worse days, the days when he felt he couldn´t leave, that he was failing Cass for leaving him alone there ...
Dean calmed him with his scent but he had to hear his husband cry for hours in his arms until he was dry.
"For what?" Cass asked confused
The doctor had asked him to wait outside. It had happened once while he had been there in the last 5 years, a long term patient waking up. He had seen the rush of doctors and nurses, tests and family…. He had wished for it to happen to them so hard… maybe someone had finally listened to all his payers. Dean tried to contain the tears and dialled Sam.
The many doctors Dean had contacted with along these years had come and go, some gave him hope, some told him to move on ... but Cass was there, he could feel Dean´s presence, when Dean was excite or sad, Cass´s scent changed too, his heartbeat responded but nothing else ever happened. Dean talked to him but he didn´t really know if Cass, his Cass was really there, listening and understanding. Nonetheless, he continued to talk to him.
“I couldn´t let you go, when I was sad or desperate you could sense my trouble and your scent would change either to comfort me or to share the distress… I knew you were still there, I had faith in us” said Dean proudly.
"He is beautiful guys" Dean said "Hey Bobby  we are your grandpas and we love you very much!" Castiel melted at his mate. They hugged their kids and call Sam and Eileen. Later the nurse interrupted their family meeting.
“Your brother seemed a little sad” said Jessica to Sam
"Eh ... I don´t have a mom. She... she died when I was three. My dad raised me by himself. He thinks i am at a Omega study group" Jack confessed.
“Dean?” asked Cass from the couch where he was resting under a blanket
Castiel showed Dean the manuscript of his second novel. And Dean sat down to read. Castiel watched him closely.
“And still you came everyday” said Cass looking at his Alpha and imagining how horrible it would have been to deal with all that.
“How long has he been like this?” Jess asked
"The fire will be lit for tomorrow, it gets quite cold around here in winter and we like our customers to feel welcomed. Like at home" said Dean "This was my mom´s book store, I used to work here alongside her when I was a teen" Castiel must have noted the sadness in his words
When Meg came around for the morning round he found Dean asleep on his back, Cass Was in his arms, his nose pasted to Dean´s mate gland. She smiled a little sad, She couldn´t understand how the destiny could be so dam cruel to keep these two mates apart like this. “Dean Buddy, wakey wakey” she said and Dean opened his eyes.
"You did? I never knew!" Gabriel said
“The doctor said my body is reactivating nicely … I wanted to run by you the possibility that my heat may come quite soon too” Cass looked at Dean in the eye while talking to him “I don´t want to take suppressants but I don´t think I am healthy enough to carry a pregnancy to term…” Cass confessed a little disappointed.
Castiel was over the moon with the news and he knew he could take the babies to term, he knew it. He just needed Dean to breath and enjoy the pregnancy.
"Hi, my name is Dean Winchester, I am Sam´s brother and I will be taking care of everything while you are here" he extended his hand and Castiel shook it.
“Goodbye” said Michael getting into his car and driving away.
Dean stood up and prepared two mugs of hot cocoa and stated talking about his feelings, about what Jensen and Misha had, how than made him feel, how he related to their solitude and how he felt like they had found a one in a lifetime type of love... only to be separated by death...  "I would have fallen for him too, no matter the risk"
“We want a small spring wedding, next month, just family and a couple of friends” said Jessica
"Well that is bullshit you are a great student and I am sure there will be one Univerity that sees over all this Alpha/Omega  discrimination" said Dean and that made Castiel look at him in awe.
"I won´t allow it babe, I promise. Let´s get to bed" she said.
“It is too early” he complained a little
"When you guys were born, Benny was the last one and he was so tiny and fragile. When they took him out they took him away, he was not crying or moving or breathing.... we were very worried." Said Dean placing a had over his mate's shoulder
"Babe, do you want to do this now? Or do you want to tell our parent first?" asked Jack
"Oliver is 1.8 kilograms and he is healthy" said the nurse while clasping the I'd bracelet to the super tiny arm.
“Of course not” said Dean and Cass smiled a little “This pregnancy is the best thing that had ever happened to us Cass, we are having a baby … oh god! I am going to be a dad!” said Dean touching Cass´s belly and feeling such happiness that could not be described with words.
He woke up in the middle of the night, hot and sweaty. He went downstairs to get a glass of water and take an ibuprofen. Two hours later he was still feeling bad, he was overheated and starting to cramp. This fel awfully like the starts of a...heat! Oh god he was going into heat? A gush if slick made it out of his hole and not a minute later Dean entered the room. He eyes were alpha red his nostrils were taking in the smell.
“Did you think about names for the baby?” asked Dean once wondering if in his absence Cass had name their son.
He nedded to male his Alpha trust him and his instinct.
“I didn´t know it will feel like this, I feel special” said Cass
"Nice to meet you Dean" he smiled genuinely
"Well he was the smallest toddler of you 4 but he had a gigantic will to get himself in trouble, he wanted to run as fast as his brothers,  jump as high... he terrified me" said Castiel
“Same Cas, same”
"Do you need me to go... I can try?" He offered
Jack and Claire has gone for their first  sonogram and the got to see their little baby, hear their heartbeat. They had come come happily hugging their picture and discussing names.
"Now why don´t you let Claire back into the crib now that she is asleep and we go to bed" suggested Castiel.
Castiel saw Dean cry when he reached that part of the novel and felt warm love for the mechanic who so freely enjoyed his book. Dean went back to the book after lunch.
"67, you like cars?" Dean asked
"Only a visit they have some vintage cars to restore but it is just a visit to see what we do I can manage. Rest. Doctors orders" said dean kissing him on the temple "love you".
"Really? Why me?" asked Dean
"Allright" Dean shook his hand "I need to go back home to my pregnant omega, he is having some rough days with the pregnancy, otherwise he would have been here"
"You smell like heaven Cass, like fresh baked bread and summer ... why haven't I noticed before?..." his voice was weak
Dean felt like the earth beneath his feet has shaken.
"Poor Jensen, he didn´t deserve hell" Castiel said
“None of your business” said Dean leaving the cafe rushing back to the hospital. He tried to calm himself but he was extremely distressed. So much so that Meg stopped him before entering the room
This is the final chapter, this story was written during a week with long series of hospital appointments. So it was written on my phone on waiting rooms, it gave me purpose and distracted me on a difficult time, It is full of typos and has long chapters and short chapters. ... but it was great to see that many were happy to read it and that was amazing.
“How can there be another baby…. In the sonogram there was only one…” Cass argued but soon a contraction made him clunk his teeth and push. “Fuuuck”
"I read the instructions Dean and basically you pee and wait, not much you can mess!"Cass sound annoyed
"Yeah he was very cocky when I arrived and he has been cockles ever since" he said. Castiel covered his mouth with his hands, he had been about to laugh out loud thinking about macho ketch without his cock.
Kali looked at the older omega, he was so familiar ...
"How long did she passed away?" he asked softly
Oliver was flying home from New York where he was studying ballet at the best academy of the country.
"Well, I was going to drop you at your hotel to give you some time to rest, take a relaxing shower or anything you need, the hotel in a block away from the store. I was thinking you might come down to the store once you are ready, see the place, check the stand and then i can take you to have diner, show you the town, what do you think? asked Dean
"Oh I want my present alright, you look heavenly" Dean kissed Cass passionately and they fell to bed together.  Twenty minutes later, Castiel was riding Dean, his moans were loud because they were alone and he could enjoy himself as he wanted. Dean loved to see his mate like this, all sexy and free. His life companion still desired him, despite their bodies growing old and his hair starting to turn silver at places. Dean realized that their intimacy was bound to change with time, but it didn´t have to disappear, knotting and even mounting was not all they enjoyed about sex together. He focused on pleasuring his mate and make him cum all over his chest.  Before Dean could cum inside his mate, Cass changed position surprising him and laid down between his legs to take his cock into his mouth and looked at his with a cocky smirk.
"She is my pride and joy. I inherited her from my dad" Dean said
"I am a mechanic, I had always been good with cars, so that is what I do. And Castiel, babysitting you is no task at all, I loved your book" said Dean getting closer to the fireplace and lighting the fire
Dean held Cass´s hand when they told Sam and Jess that they were expecting. Cass held Dean´s hand when they saw the baby for the first time and he was crying. Life was good, Dean had his mate back home with him, healthy and safe and all that hurt that he had gone through for five years was in the past. To love him and care for him was his mission in life, he had lost so much time…
“His scent is changing? Can he hear us?” asked Jess
"Wave bye to Sammy and let's go home" Dean waved bye and sammy waved bye back with a wide smile. She looked adorable with that little backpack that still looked a little too big.
They were sitting on the sofa watching tv when Cass cought Dean looking at him softly and he extended his hand to place it over Dean's.
"I hope so, for the good of our family, I hope so" said Claire.
Love to you all
"It hurts me to think about them" said Cass
“Forgiven” said Dean “Meg, could I stay the night? I cannot go, I can´t …can´t leave him tonight…” Dean looked at Cass with tears in his eyes again and Meg understood that today was one of those days where she looks the other way.
“Why isn´t she waking up?” asked Sam worried.
It was thanksgiving and Dean and Cass were hosting. They were happy to have the house full, all their babies under the same roof like old times.
In two hours all their shopping was finished and they were heading home when the red car came our of nowhere on the intersection and crushed into them.
"It should´t be like that, but Pregnant Omegas without a mate are being exposed to all kinds of horrible behaviors, they are disrespected, they get the lower jobs... you will never get into University Jack... it was your dream..." Dean said sadly
“Because our father was extremely bigoted, mating a male Omega… unthinkable” said Sam
"My dad is going to kill me, your dad is going to kill me" said Claire passing her hands over her hair and looking at Jack. Jack now was looking at his stomach
"Hello my name is Kali and I am your nurse. You need to leave the young family be, the need to rest bringing a baby into the world is not an easy affair"
“Would you be free for lunch tomorrow?” he asked
Dean was worried about Castiel and the pups all the time.
“Michael” Castiel called him “Please don´t go”
“Oh god… you are so big babe…. Move Dean” Cass asked him, he couldn´t see his mate right now so he couldn´t see how broken Dean was for a moment. For Cass it had been months but for him… it had been years. He composed himself when hearing Cass beg to be fucked and go it with the program, fucking wildly into his mate, the skin with skin slaps were only  in rivalry by the moans and groans of the couple and suddenly, Dean was knotting him and Cass was screaming his orgasm coating the bed with his release. Dean maneuvered him into his sides and kissed his mating mark. He was shaking
"Mom intercepted it all, after Claire was born I went home to introduced her to mom and she... threatened me, my daughter" Castiel said. Dean held his hand "I had to dissapear for Claire's sake. Missouri  who was a nurse took us in, I changed my surname to hers so mom couldn't find us and tried to move on" Castiel was the one that moved to hug Gabriel.
“Hi Sam, is everything alright?” Dean asked, he was in Cass´s room
"No spouse or partner, so it will be just the two of us" Dean said and he would swear that he saw Castiel smirk a little.
"No!" said Dean startling Castiel "How could you do this to them?" he asked
"Is it sentimental? Cause it is going to cost you a small fortune!" Said Dean. The other man kept writing the parts and their numbers
And suddendly in the middle of the night discomfort woke him up, he had minor pains like contractions. Probably Braxton Hicks... he walked around the room until his water broke.
"Love you mate, love you and Claire and this little bug here" Dean placed his hand over his mate's belly "I will protect you all from now on"
"They won't, even if they did, the job would still remain yours" said Dean "trust me?" He asked holding Castiel's hand
The book was about a fallen angel, the angel of thrusday. He had made a mistake and he has disappointed his brother and sisters in heaven so he was destined to earth where is is a little lost until he had met Jensen.
Suddenly his eyes felt watery and he had a little memory flash from Dean´s mind. Mary singing to little Dean a soft song while holding him in her arms making him feel loved and safe. He remembered the fire and John Winchester telling him that his mommy was not coming back ever again. He felt Dean´s pain while feeling alone and afraid at night, feeling overwhelmed when little Sammy cried in his crib. He remembered that Dean used to crawl into the crib with Sammy and sing to him that same song his mommy sang to him. The rage took over and Michael screamed “Fucking Monsters!”  His grace incinerating them all in the building. Sam and Mary covered their eyes and when they opened them, the monsters were dead and Michael was gone taking Dean with him.
"I am all yours" Castiel said.
"For caring for my baby like this" he said
“Alright?” said Dean “what are you planning on doing now Michael?” he asked
Oh man, this was just what Castiel needed. What both needed.
“Sam leave it alone...” Dean was tired
“Cass.. I don´t…” Dean started but Cass interrupted
"Are you serious?" Jack was in awe
“We lost 5 years! Life had stolen 5 years from us … I would have been a papa by now” Cass said sad
" well it was about time" he said kissing his baby daughter
End of the book
"So what do you do for a living Dean, when you are not tasked with babysitting a weird writer?" asked Castiel who was not sitting in the couch by the fireplace
"Is that so me mate?" Oh... he was in!
“Gabe! I am so happy to see you?” Cass looked over to the wheelchair and frowned. A wave of sadness filled the room.
"What? No!" Said Claire. Another scream of pleasure could be clearly heard in the silent house. "Noooo nooo nooo that is my dad? Shit i dont want to hear this! Can't believe they are being so loud!" She said angrily
It felt wrong to be appart.
They called her Samantha.
" Mr Novak I am sorry we meet like this but I do love your daughter very much..." Jack started to day but Castiel interrupted him
“Everything is going to be alright, push baby push” Dean encourage him and held his hand while holding jack until baby Claire was born, her cries were soft” The twin girl was smaller but healthy and bundled on a blanket was place on Cass´s arms.
Life was easy at the Winchester household. The house was nice and spacious and warm. Fridge always full, Dean turned out to be the less stereotypical Alpha ever. Not only he was soft and caring with Jack, Castiel liked the way he treated Claire. He was the most amazing cook and love to feel them all, he didn't  make himself scarce during cleaning. Castiel helped with everything as much as possible except food, he loved Dean's cooking!
"Well I have to go to the garage for a while, I have that important client I told you about coming today Mr. Klein and he apparently will be taking a business partner along, I dont remember the name" said dean kissing cass whose morning sickness was at its finest and was taking some time off
“I honestly thought that our mating night was all I was going to have with you… don´t get me wrong, I would have been by your side until my last breath, but lately I was beginning to lose hope to see you again, to talk to you again, to have you like this” Dean managed to say and suddenly Cass understood Dean´s tears.
“Dean Winchester” said Sam and she frowned “I am his brother”
"Sound great, will your spouse join us? asked Cass
Four babies
"What? Unbelievable if I remember correctly you were pretty loud mister" she said pointing her finger at his belly and making him laugh.
When he finished reading he gave Cass his bath and combed his unruly bedhair, changed his pajamas and softly tucked him back in his now clean and welcoming bed. Nurses did their part most of the time, but Dean liked to do this for Cass. All he could do was to keep him comfortable. After a little break for lunch Dean went back to the hospital room and sat there a little more, sometimes he watched tv with Cass commenting on everything that was happening on that Doctor Sexy M.D that Cass liked so much. When time came to return home he softly whispered his goodbyes to Cass with promises that he will be back tomorrow. And Dean drags himself back home to his empty house, empty bed and empty life.
“Silly alpha! I love you so fucking much that I don´t know how to make you understand” Cass said and Dean melted in his arms.
Looking for names, preparing the nursery, enjoying their time with little Bobby and resting took all his time. Cass had no other flashbacks but still he decided to start seeing a therapist and that made him stronger.
"Money is not an issue" said Gabriel
“Cass” Dean chastised him
“Sounds nice…. You didn´t chose and angelic name...” said Michael
The power of the orgasm woke him up. He was soaked in sweat and slick. It had been all a dream. Two months living with Dean and he was already lusting over him ... well it was more than lusting, he had a serious crush.
“Dean” Sam called him right away with Jess´s idea
"My dad used to drive an old car like that, it was just a rush of memories" said Cass "I am ok"
"Never been more serious about anything in my life" She said
“Oh no, we have discussed this plenty, you did what you had to do and I understand why you said yes. Now, you are back here and that is all that matters” Cass said “How about John?” he suggested
“Is my brother in 907?” asked Sam
"Hello" Dean said looking at the pretty dark-haired omega at his door and he saw Jack behind "Jack is everything alright?"
"Are you sure about this?" Asked Dean
Per indications of Sam he had to pick him up, drive him to the hotel, be nice and welcoming and prepare the store for a public event. Dean got a copy of his book because he thought it would be quite weird to spend time with the guys without having even had a look at his work.
"If you touch my mate, I will rip your head off" said Dean
They all sat at the table together and Dean and Cass looked at each other proud. This was the greatest adventure of their lives. Finding each other and creating this amazing family.
"Yes, she needs a spin. What do you think?"
“Hello Meg, how are you?” Dean asked
“Who are you possessing now?” asked Dean angrily
"Sorry Dean, I am not trying to hurt Castiel" Gabriel said and Dean released him.
They redid one of the guest bedrooms into the baby room, they painted it soft yellow and place a little crib and a rocking chair in the room, as well as a little bookcase with some books to read to the baby.
"You are pregnant, what shouldn't worry me otherwise. But as you can see here, there are multiple babies and Cass is no longer a 20 year old omega. This is risky
“You will have to kill us that kid is family, we will die protecting him even from you” Said Jack
“I can´t date anybody, I can´t put myself out there, not that I would want to” Dean said and after a moment he held the collar of his shirt and moved it to let his mating mark be visible. Sam gasped and looked at him with wide eyes. “I need to go”
Dean kissed Castiel lovingly and whispered I love yous  to his lips. They were happy.
"Get on the car" he said and both followed holding hands but without exchanging a word. The drive to the Winchester home was quite short. Castiel looked at the nice house and he knew he was in deep shit. His alpha daughter, has gotten a rich Omega pregnant... this was not going to end well.
"How were you so sure?" Asked Dean
."what happened?" He whispered
“Yes!” Sam hi fived Jessica. “We will text you the location later. Bye Dean”
"Dean, there is a fire"  castiel held onto his husband
“Work?” she asked confused
Castiel touched Dean, moving his hand down from his chest to his sex drawing moans from his alpha.
“I didn´t want to think about this things without you Dean” Cass said turning in bed to face his husband and smiled softly “But now that you are back … should we discuss it?” he said and kissed his husband´s frowned face.
"Is the baby ok?" She mumbled half awake. A scream ripped through the night making Claire sit and alert inmediately.
"But the, he grew up and grew up... like his body was tired of being the smallest of you 4 and look at him now. A firefighter " said Dean proud
“What Dean?” asked Cass knowing that his husband was considering something?
"Oh they are listing the needed parts right now if you want to come over to the back?" Gabriel followed the man and there it was Dean Winchester with another man, almost as tall and well built as him.
"Did you bet on us getting together?" Asked Dean
Dean was sad that he hadn´t been there for most of Cass´s pregnancy, but he tried to take care of him and pamper his pregnant husband as much as possible. He loved to sleep with his man in his arms and his hands protectively around his belly. The kid liked to kick a lot, he was getting close to term and Dean couldn´t wait to meet his baby.
“I agreed to meet you both for coffee not to be ambushed on a blind date Sam!” Dean was angry
"Your papa refused to say goodbye, he said that it was like not trusting him with the fight, He never gave up on him. We were there with you guys all the time we could,  holding you, changing your diapers,  as is everything was normal. Skin with skin contact from you papa helped you all grow and leave the hospital... with Benny it was different... he had a couple of complications, we feared for his health..." Dean reminded
"And second?" asked Castiel
Cass was on the stretcher all prepped and sedated from waist down. Dr. Bradbury told them that she was going to get the first one. A tiny crying pup was extracted from Cass's belly.
“It will protect the baby from being summoned by demons and angels against dark magic too” said Michael “It is my apology for taking you for those months when you should have been with your family” he said
What a day. Jack and Claire had became parents. Dean and Cass were now grandpas! Kali had called Gabriel to let her know that she had a lead for the PI.
"Let's check to make sure" said the doctor and asked Castiel to lay down on his stretcher for an sonogram. Cass knew something was wrong when he saw the doctor go pale. He felt afraid, he wanted Dean there.
“We have been together for 10 years, mated 5”  Dean said and Sam frowned.
“Yeah, the second worst thing that had happened to me that day, the first was seeing my little brother being rushed into the ER with a piece of metal in his skull. He died in the ambulance and they got him back, the doctors said he flatted twice on the OR table. It was a miracle he survived the surgery but … then he never came back to us” Gabriel was quite shaken by the news.
" sure, i will help you out" said Cass and they got out the house to see the beautiful muscle car he had "wow are you going to drive her?"
“5 years, he was injured in the embassy bombing, he was rushed to the hospital and when they allowed me to leave the scene and go see him, he was already in a coma. There were complications in the surgery, they were trying to extract a piece of shrapnel in his head and something went wrong. He never woke up from the surgery” Dean explained
"Dad this is Jack Winchester, my boyfriend" she said and she saw his dad face turned from curious to furious
"I looked for you everywhere. Mom and dad refused to tell me what had happened. I looked for you everywhere, asked your friends, finally somebody told me about what happened. I looked him up and lets say  he will never be able to abuse anybody else" Gabriel said
“What?” asked Sam “you just got here?”
“I  …. When the doctors told me that the surgery had complications and that you were not waking up… I was heartbroken. I brought you back here, your brother Gabe is on his way. He paid for the best doctors and the best everything Cass. But nobody gave us any hope” said Dean
"That is if I don't get betted out" Claire said
“What do you want with Dean?” asked Sam reluctant.
"Car accident, are you in pain? He asked
"Don you have to go back home?" asked Dean a little concerned
"That was amazing" said Castiel helping Dean clean himself.
“How about coffee in the afternoon, with me and Jessica? Please” Sam begged
“I am sorry for the café thing…” said Jess beating Sam to the punch.
"You are a dork" Dean said "But I am completely in love with you, I need you three like I need the air to breathe. I love you Cass" said Dean with plain honesty
“How long?” asked Sam, his eyes showed understanding.
"Hello?" Said a female voice. Castiel put it on speakerphone
“Only five Dean, you need to rest” she said really concerned. Dean smiled but only on the outside and looked back at Cass “You need to wake up Cass, you need to, please please Cass, I will see you awake in the morning alright?” Cass´s scent changed, he smelled like Happy Omega and Dean held his hand reassuringly. After 5 minutes, Cass was still in a coma and Dean left for the Day. As soon as he left the hospital he allowed himself to feel sad. He knew his scent was not disturbing Cass anymore, he allowed himself to suffer and cry, to get angry and outraged when he was outside that room. By the time he arrived home he was exhausted and empty. He ordered some food and went to bed.
"Dont worry your mate is fine. He lost some blood they took him to have x-rays of that leg in case something was broken, we will keep you updated" he said. Cass didn't correct them because he knew that if he said the truth they would let him see Dean.
" I am so sorry Cass, can't imagine what you felt while pregnant and alone" dean was holding Cass both arms and turning the Omega attention towards him " But you are very strong Cass, you survived, raised Claire to be a happy, respectful Alpha all by yourself... you did amazing" Cass was looking at him now a blushing a little "Together we will make sure that they have all the chances to finish their studies, raise that baby to be a happy pup that can feel safe no matter what" Dean concluded
"He knows what he is doing, he is a Winchester" said Dean
"Now. There is going to be a lot of yelling but once we are mated, there is nothing they can do to keep us apart" she said
Claire birth had been long, but this was different in less that two hours they were pushing. And their daughter was born  healthy and quite big. Rossy cheecks and fluffy hair.
"Does this mean we are pregnant?" Asked Dean
“Sam? Sam Winchester?” he asked, the man looked surprised “Sorry, I am Gabriel Novak, we never met in person, I am Castiel´s brother, Dean showed me pictures of you” He tended his hand towards Sam. Sam shake his hand and pointed out towards the wheelchair.
"Did you read it?" Castiel asked
Sam drove them home and told Dean about the extensive damage of the Impala, about the drunk man that was driving the red car that jumped the red light rushing through the intersection, he had died on spot cause he had no seatbelt on... soon the arrived home and each one taken to their room to rest.
"Well we hadn't for almost two years but, almost three months ago we had a synchronized heat and rut" Cass said making his doctor pay attention
Six hours later, Cass was pushing hard to deliver baby Jack, who cried loudly when coming into this world. Crying a little less loud Dean held his baby boy and place him on Cass´s arms but just for a second when the pain made Cass cry out. Dean scared took Jack into his arms while scared look at the doctor fuss.
"I dont know what the hell is happening but I can't say I am complaining Cass" said Dean while mounting his mate from behind over his desk office. Castiel was bitting his sleeve to mute himself so the employees didn't hear him scream in pleasure.
“Cass… hello love” said Dean softly he was weak and his eyes were blurry but he extended a hand towards his angel “Is this true? Are we having a baby?” while trying to stand up but failing due to exhaustion. Cass rushed towards him with his big belly and held him in his arms.
“Dean… what is going on?” he asked and Dean was crying silently by his side. He softly move close and kissed his lips. Cass smiled  and Dean cried harder.
Dean reciprocated until they were both out of air "Come home with me Cass?" he asked
“Hey Oliver” said Cass caressing his belly “do you like Oliver?” he asked and both felt a big kick “Oh!”
"We saw the fire on tv" he said " we waited for you to start"
"I am castiel Novak" he said with an attractive deep voice
“My emotions, my feelings about my family and my love for you… were so powerful that filtered through his control, he had never experienced human feelings … not like this” Dean said
degrading... he was going to kill him. Castiel reacted and fought back but ketch punched him to almost unconsciousness. Everything turned black and red. Cass heard all the filthy threats Ketch was making.
“Mom is bad… they stabbed her… please?” Sam´s eyes were pleading. Michael turned to see Mary Winchester unconscious by Sam´s side lying on a pool of blood. She was indeed dying and he rushed to heal her with his grace. Mary remained unconscious for a moment.
"Make love to me Dean" Castiel requested and Dean obeyed.
"Uncle Sam, come meet Samantha Winchester-Novak"  Dean said placing the newborn on the arms of his gigantic little brother
“Dean, you can come in now” Meg said smiling. Inside Cass was almost sitting on the bed, Meg had changed his pajamas and combed his hair…
"You are bleeding way too much Dean" said Castiel moving closer and using his flannel to  try stop the bleeding "stay with me"
Jared took the ex-angel under his wing, gave him a home and food and company. Two months later, another Angel had come to their door. I was the archangel Gabriel. Telling them that Jensen, who had always deserved to be in heaven he had been punished by the angels and casted down to hell. Misha had cried in despair. But Gabriel was coming to their help.
Castiel ensured him time and time again that everything was going to be fine but Dean knew what it was to loose a mate, he has lost his first omega long ago, he knew that sometime things don't work out. Sam arrived half an hour later to keep him company while there were prepping Cass. Whe they were ready  the let him in, dressed him with scrubs and entered the OR.
"The babies may not get to term?" Asked Castiel
They spent all night making love, and when the sun was coming out, Cass´s head was gone and they both knew that it meant they had conceived.
The first think Jack got once he came down from the stage was an emotional bear hug from Castiel. "I love you Jack"
"One thousand percent omega, I will take care of everything, just concentrate all your energy to remain healthy.  I love you" Dean kissed his mate.
“Cass??!” he called him but in an instant he was following the alluring smell towards their room “Cass?” He opened the door and oh God! Castiel was naked in bed he was touching himself, his dick hard in his hand, his fingers opening his wet hole. “Oh babe” Dean felt his knees weaken but he moved towards the bed, removed Cass´s hand from his hole and licked him open with enthusiasm while hearing Cass scream with pleasure.
"Like I know his thoughts and feelings, like I can feel the baby growing inside of him...?" Claire volunteered
"It was about time" said Claire making his dad groan
“Can we go in, see if they are awake?” asked Gabriel
Sammy and her mate Sarah, who was now pregnant with their 3rd baby were driving from Minessota from their new home, Sammy was the first tenured omega at the Molecular chemistry department in their University.  Sarah was an artist.
John and   Marcus were both driving from University, Stanford had given them a full ride to law school ..
When Sammy was conceived I felt it that it was different.  Now it is  even  a more powerful feeling, I am united to you  by a very deep and powerful connection, a profound bond that gives me strength. I know with every cell in my body that we 5 are going to be fine. I just need an alpha that supports my stubbornness and give me 4 times more care because this belly is inflating at a crazy rate. Are you with me?" He asked
"The baby is fine but out parents are having incredibly loud sex.. I think" said Jack
"Feeling better now?" asked Dean sitting by his side and places a mug of hot cocoa in his hands
“That is between Dean and me, can you call him so we can talk? ” he said. Sam asked Jack to go get Dean.
It took Dean a while to digest all Cass had told him. His mate was not only loving and wonderful, he was resillient, a survivor and he was damm proud of him.
"He was barely the size of a hand and weighted 1 kilogram 200 grams. You all were small and premature but he looked so terribly fragile. You  guys spent two weeks in the NICU,  Benny over a month and a half." Castiel told them
"My name is Castiel Novak and I drove your son Jack home. Can we come in for a second, there are some things you should know" he said and he saw the man´s face change to worry.
Yesterday it was Supernatural day, so I decided to finish it.
“Dean… who is paying all this?” asked Sam now concerned
"Papa is Benny arriving soon?" Asked Olivet
"Babe are you sure?" His eye were red and Castiel's  were omega gold.
Dean walked Castiel to the hotel and told him he would pick him up for a late lunch before the book signing in the afternoon. The author behind the book was a dream. His eyes were not of this world.
Dean had asked them to take a seat. He prepared coffee and tea so they could seat down and talk.
"yes" Dean said sure of it. He tended the cup to Castiel who smiled fondly
“Like my dad?” Dean was surprised… “That carries a heavy load Cass…. Something new with less baggage in this family” asked Dean “How about Oliver?” he asked
"Shit the baby is coming... Dean wake up! The baby is coming" he said and Dean stood up excitedly
At the same time
"You did what?" both Dean and Cass yelled
"Angels are corrupt dicks" said Dean and that made Castiel smile
“What are you talking about?” asked Jack looking confused
“Happened in the bombing?” Sam asked
When Castiel came out of the bathroom, Dean forgot how to breath for a moment. He was wearing the most sexy lingerie he had ever seen on him. His legs were covered in back tights, the red garther kept them in place. He had diminute red lace panties and a lace bralette with fluffy sleeves and fluff transparent side shirt that framed his hips. His mate looked gorgeous in that.
"Thanks papa, love you back" she kissed her dad "bye Dean"
"Well I am not excited about all this happening behind my back, I am sure Castiel thinks the same..." said Dean "but despite the lying, and the surprise pregnancy and the mating ..." Dean took a breath " I need to admit you two are cute together"
“I got a job as a beekeeper north from here in Tulcson and I need to get back” he said “I just wanted to stop by and give you both the congratulations” he said “Can I see him? I would really like to see him” he asked
"The biggest one  he has always been the biggest of us all" said Marcus
"Even in the possibility of loosing him is high and then you would be human alone?" asked Castiel
“please Dean let me hold jack too” Cass was exhausted but wasted to hold his babies. Dean place Jack on his arms as well and them quickly backed up a little to take a picture with his phone to send to Sam and Gabe
After several hours, castiel had enough control to text Sam to help them with Sammy.  Sex had turned to a one week sex marathon that had taken them by surprise as they were getting a little old for such endeavors. Once their rut and heat were over they were exhausted and in pain. It took the another two days to wake up from bed. Sam and Eileen had the time of their lives teasing them about the whole affair when they had returned a happy Sammy home.
"Well it is difficult not to like something so beautiful and well preserved" said Castiel and Dean smiled. Damm he was nice!
“Ok, just come inside, I have someone you need to meet. You too Jess, you are family in the end” Said Dean “Sweeheart, my brother Sammy just arrived and they wanted to meet you alright?” Dean held Cass´s hand. “This is Lieutenant Commander Castiel Novak, my best friend and my mate”
"We can do this, I will send one of my men with the tow truck to bring it over" said Dean
“You are special babe” Dean complimented him but Cass could see in Dean´s eyes that he meant it
“Of course I would, I would do anything for you” Dean explained and he looked honest
"I already have the second book, it is almost finished, maybe you would like to have a look at it" said Castiel
"Dean got carried away and bit me and that triggered the event that lasted over a week but after so many years I am not fertile any longer right?" Asked Cass
"I ofter dream of us making love slowly in my bed..." whispered Dean and kissing Castiel.
What is going to happen to Misha now that he is human?
"Dean..." Cass whispered
Sam and Eileen came frequently that week to check on them. The kids were also fussing over them until Dean told them to go to school and let them rest. They were healing slowly. Castiel's bruises were almost gone and he was glad.
"You smell like heaven ...I am going to close my eyes for a moment ok? Stay please" Dean begged
"Omega instincts, Cass has been helping me get more in touch with my omega side, is nice"Jack said carresing his baby bump.
"Jack and I have been going out together for over two years. I knew you were going to get mad with the dating thing so I kept it on the down low" she said
" Since we scented each other that day ... it can't be denied that we are mates, true mates I think. We are meant to be together but I am not a normal omega, not anymore" cass said
"Does this mean... we are pregnant?" she hesitated to say
“This is impossible!  What this baby is … how?” whispered Michael feeling like an earthquake running through his grace.
"Because it seems you understand them, you understand what i wanted to write..." Castiel sipped at his cocoa "I like it here"
Dean arrived to the hospital like every day. He left some chocolates for the nurses at the front because they were nice. He went all the way to the end of the corridor and said Hi to the doctors and few regular he crossed with. Stopped in front of door 907 and tried to collect himself. Five years and still each day was as difficult as the first one. He entered the room and was welcomed with the scent of Castiel, the Omega was lying on the bed, asleep... well he was in a coma but he looked like he was sleeping. Dean had cut his scruffy beard yesterday and he looks pretty.
And in the end, Cass was worried for nothing, his inner Omega knew better that to weaken his body with a heat, at he was almost completely recovered four months later when he felt the fist symptoms of his heat approaching. He was ready for Dean now, oh he was more than ready!
"We are happy for you" said  Jack and uncle Sam owes us 100 dollars
“Well he is unmated, when he came back from the war, he was different. He had never recovered from the things he suffered over there. He doesn´t date, I have never seen him even remotely interested in anyone. I think that our announcement was bittersweet. Dean loves pups, he would have been a wonderful dad” Sam said
“They were not bothering me, I just introduced them to Cass and that took me down memory lane. I guess I was not ready” Dean Said and Sam nodded in understanding. He had forced this on Dean. He felt horrible.
"Oh.. you do know to to treat a man" said Castiel...Dean looked at him, was Castiel flirting with him?
Two weeks later Cass catched a stomach bug for a couple of days, he ended up going to the doctor that was running all kinds of tests.
“Please Michael, please do not do this… my child is innocent” he begged his hands protectively around his belly.
"It is alright babe" said Dean "but if you ever want to tell me or talk to them, let me know I will be by your side" Dean kissed him
"You should both move here then" said Dean. "Listen Castiel, they need to ge together, they are going to try raise a baby by themselves while finishing their studies, they will need our help. The house is big enough for all of us"
"Oh yes angel, I would love to make you fat and round with my pups" said Dean kissing Castiel's neck " I would love to mate you and breed you... can you feel how much I want you?"  Asked dean grinding his fat cock on Castiel's ass.
"C'mon Benny, just hold on a little bit" said the doctor extracting the smallest baby Castiel and Dean had ever seen. He didn't cry or move. Dean held his breath, the all fussed around his youngest and rushed him away to the neonatal unit. Dean and Cass were holding hands.
“Hello guys, it is bed time” said Meg entering the room “You must be the big little brother, Meg Masters, Castiel´s night nurse” she introduced herself
"A girlfriend?...I think you are a little young for that Jack, we have talked about how to do this" Dean said
"Hi, the store is very cozy" said Castiel looking at the fireplace and the sofas.
“I would like you to be my best man Dean” Sam asked and Dean Beamed at him nodding enthusiastically
“Dean...” Sam said “what is happening here?”
When he was finally by himself Dean felt like he could breathe again, Damm he was magnetic, the deep voice his electric eyes... he was like... he was like he had imagined Misha to be.
I had a day for short a fluffy ending.
Dean took it and looked at it confused “What is this for?”
He stood up, went to the kitchen, got a clean rag and got it wet, he brushed it all over his mating gland to remove the bloquers and got it wet again for Dean. He followed suit and in a second the room was inundated with their scents.
When Dean arrived home the sweetest most wonderful smell in the world hit him like a train. In an instant his Alpha was growling and he was hard… that could only mean Cass was in heat.
"My leg feels trapped... I can't move it" he complained and Cass had a look at it. The leg was cought withing a bunch of metal and it was indeed trapped. Dean was bleeding profusely .
"Oh yeah, pants first" said Dean nervously
"You cared her Samantha? After me?" Sam asked
“What is wrong with that? You need someone in your life” Sam said and Dean sighted
"It is unfair I know but ... this is what I think needed to happen" said Castiel defending himself
"Dad, we have been together for years and the sex was consensual. The pregnancy was unexpected but this is on both of us, not Claire´s fault" said Jack
“Oh Dean… it is true. I missed you so much!” said Cass melting on a hug with his husband, feeling safe for the first time since Michael had taken Dean “Thanks Chuck I got you back, I can´t do this alone Dean…. I know nothing about babies… we need you”
"Claire does his family know about this? he asked
"We need to talk about this" requested Dean "but I have a petition first"
“O…k?” Dean sat on the little table to look Cass right in the eye.
“Oh darling you are a miracle … I will be by your side babe, I missed you so dam much” Dean said crying onto Cass´s shoulder “I love you, I love you”
"Yeah she is just like you when you were little." He said  and the baby started to cry "ok ok come with dad eh Sammy dont cry my love" Dean cooed at her
"I can already scent the baby mingling with your scent" said Dean"even more irresistible that before"
We need be thankful for our families. These past few years have presented us with a lot of ups and downs and it is good to know that we had our families in our corner, supporting us along the way. Thanks Dad and Papa. I would not be here today without you. And being Omega still poses more challenges but they always trusted me, supported me and that gives me the fuel to keep driving forward.
“ Listen, if we can and you feel like it I will breed you up all the time, I would keep you round and pregnant and growing my pups for the next ten years!” Cass huffed a laugh and Dean smirked “But babe, when you were on that bed I prayed, I know I am not a believer, but I prayed to whatever higher power existed if any… I prayed and I bargained, I bargained everything for you to wake up, even my own life… just to see you smile again…” Cass caressed his cheek
"So Claire and I should live together" said Jack "that would make me happy"
“What have you done!” he claimed enraged at the others who run away into the darkness of the basement.  The power of that feeling to save Sam was out of control, he was blinded by rage. Fucking monsters without soul!
“Honey…” Dean understood  this fuss was because yeah, they had lost 5 years, wonderful years where recently mated couples share the most beautiful bonding experiences, mating, marrying, moving in together, mated heats and ruts, pups… and they have been prevented from doing any of that
"Is everything alright?" Asked Cass
When Dean saw the man Jack had said claimed to be Michael he recognized the Archangel´s grace intermediately, in the end they had been one for a long time. “Michael…” said Dean “What do you want?”
The second time he was surprised was by another feeling, this was an unexpected one. Sam and Mary had interfered into one of his plans and had been captures by his people, He got called by one of his soldiers and once he got to the basement where they were being kept he realized his loyal monster soldiers had beaten them both badly, probably tortured them and they were seriously injured.
"Oh Dean, I am loosing my mind" moaned Castiel who turned around and kissed Dean with all he had. They had slowly stripped and laid on Dean's bed. With a swift move Dean had mounted him and he was so wet for him. Dean fucked him while keeping eye contact, his green amazing eyes locked on him making him feel so many things. Like that he felt Dean's knot inflating, his rithm falting, his knot catching and felt Dean's  teeth sinking on his mating gland. Castiel cummed so hard and explosively  that he screamed.
"Like what?" Asked Castiel
Dean smiled and that made Castiel smile too. Dean reach out to hold Castiel´s hand "I would love to go out with you Cass" and that made Castiel smile brighten up
“Hey you both! Hands off!” said Gabriel and Cass looked at him with wonder.
"Let's go to the hospital, I have it all ready, let's go! " dean said ready
“Well that was weird, very weird” Dean told Cass “They might want to ask me to be the best man” said Dean. “I wish you could come with me Cass, you would look great on a tux! And talking about that, I need to either go shopping for one or rent it... what do you think? Renting a tux for your brother´s wedding isn´t it a little cheap?” Dean asked Cass
"Knot me and mate me Dean" he asked
"Oh my god, you two are in so much trouble..." said Castiel "You two are jumping on my car right now, we are taking Jack home and You both are going to face the music" he said
“I am ready Dean , please babe please I need you Alpha” Cass begged and Dean couldn´t remember how wonderful this was… they had only had penetrative sex their mating night and that was almost 5 years and a half ago… he opened his trousers and let his hard monstrous alpha dick out and using Cass´s own juices he coated himself and got in.
"Yeah, what does it mean for them that they are true mates?" Asked Castiel
Castiel woke up screaming.
"Yeah I am not letting my dad all alone in that neighborhood " said Claire
"Unbelievable" said Claire forgetting for a second about their parents and focusing on his boyfriend. "Mate me" she said
Castiel was happy to on a tour for his book. Dean was taking over his brother book shop while he was on his honeymoon with Jess, he was in charge during two weeks and he needed to organize everything for a writer presenting his book.
" i was going to the store, Do you want to tag along?" Asked Dean
"Yeah" said Dean with ragged breathing "I love you Cass"
He had tempted and tempted his husband... that had gained him some amazing orgasms.
"Hey Dee, I am not going to pretend that I understand what you have been through while taking care of me. I can´t. But what I can do is tell you that I am always going to be here for you. I am not going to miss on a single second more. I refuse to let one minute go to waste. You and these amazing miracles are the most important thing in the world for me. And I promise you that I am not going anywhere until they are fully grown, mated, they have given us a bunch of grandbabies and we are so damm old that we can´t get it up anymore. Only then, I will be satisfied" Cass had ranted making Dean smile.
“Hey! We will get there, what is worrying you so much?” asked Dean
Dr Bradbury had beena alerted and she was already there waiting for them. Well the babies were coming out one way or another that night and she calmed the couple cause they were developed enough to be just fine, maybe spend some days in the NICU. What she was worries was about Castiel's bleeding. The placenta was detaching from the uterus, Cass had to go for an emergency C-section. Dean had never been more scared in his life.
"Yes!" Jack kissed her "I love you Claire and we are going to be parents and this baby need a family, with a mom and a papa"
"It is normal to feel like this babe, she will love school and we will have some time for ourselves" said Castiel with a flirty thone
“Thanks Castiel… what is the baby´s name?” asked Michael
"Yeah Dean I was worried about you" Cass got Dean's had on his and kissed it without even thinking
"This is going to be a long night" said Cass while smiling a little.
Sex was careful and soft because wanted to dote on his mate and make him feel loved not just desired, he love to hold Cass during their post-coital haze so he could feel his body melting in his arms. Feeling safe and content. Their scents mingling.
"Dad, I have a question ..."Jack said with his voice breaking " you told me that grandma and grandpa were true mates... I think Claire and I might be true mates"
“No Sam, you know I cannot do Lunch, my work at the vet´s hospital requires me to stay until mid-afternoon, sometimes later. Is everything alright?” Dean asked
“Would you be willing to wear heat condoms? I know Alphas say they are uncomfortable and honestly I personally don´t think I would like them at all … I would rather better feel you but…” Cass wondered
"There is a big fire" they all looked at the TV until the fireman put out the fire. No Injuries
careful, sex content! gifs gifs
Oh shit
"We are changing things Cass... this is not depending on me. Please don't see it that way. This is to ensure our kids get the best chance, our grandbaby can be raised happily. Move here, leave those jobs, come work for me. I need a receptionist slash accountant, if you can do it, the work is yours" said Dean
“I love you, the only thing key to my life and my happiness is you babe, I would like pups? Yes, but if we cannot have then, we will adopt. I want us to live a long life together, the rest can be figured it out” Dean hugged Cass for Dear life “I love you” he whispered and let his inner alpha purr with happiness, he had his mate back.
"Babe, talk to me please?" Beggued Dean sitting by his omega "please is there anything you need? Dean asked again and Castiel lost it
"i love you back" Cass kissed him softly
"I inherited a car from my dad, he was a horrible father full of prejudices towards Omegas... I didn't speak with him the last 15 years of his life. It was surprising he left me his Car, old golden oldsmobile.  I never payed attention to it but I think I would like to repair it and sell it" Gabriel said
“I am sorry I missed this all” Dean said sad
“We need to find him someone” said Jess
“No, I wanted to move everything into a storage but Dean insisted that you guys were mated therefore his house was now also your house so he moved everything there.” Said Gabe
It was pass midnight when Cass felt the most intense pain of his life.  It shocked his body from head to toe in such a way that it woke Dean too. When the Alpha turned on the light the first thing he saw was how scared Castiel was. He was bleeding. It was too early for the babies to come... they called 911 andan ambulance rushed them to the hospital.
"I wish I could have met her" Dean said "I owe her my happiness
Cass called Dean who rushed to the hospital. Forty minutes later Castiel and Deam were sitting at the doctors office. A new and different machine was being wheeled in.
“Yes Dean, they are perfect” Said Cass “Where have you been hiding little Claire? We love you very much
Jack was over the moon with the announcement because not only he was going to have a brother or sister, he also knew that mean his baby will had and uncle or aunt to play with. He was not alone in the journey. Jack hugged Cass with happiness and Dean melted when watching his kid happy for them. Claire remained silent.
"Dean.."started Castiel "not that I am not happy that you are taking it all so well, I was afraid you would turn violent and hurt my kid... so I am glad you are not the typical Alpha knothead but I can't just leave the independence that it was so hard for me to obtain and come live with an Alpha" said Castiel
"Oh Cass you can stay as long as you want" Dean said "Let go have diner"
“Michael please, you don´t understand…” said Sam “That baby is…different” he stopped without saying any more
Castiel invited Gabriel over with his wife for Dinner. It was great. After the flashback he had been thinking about the past in a different way. Somehow all that past pain was not vivid anymore, like was healing over the wound more and more as Dean's love made him stronger.
he had already a crush going on with the angel and had the hots for the writer... he was so crewed.
"How did you get home?" Dean asked when Cass calmed down.
“I am sorry I didn’t know....” Sam said “What happened to her?” he asked
"Cass would you consent that I touch you, get you naked and made love to you?" Dean asked and Cass realized that even at that moment Dean was concerned about his limits.
“His injuries were extensive, give her a minute” said Michael, she will be ok.
"according to the instructions. Yes" said Jack "We are in so much trouble"
SHORT Chapter... cause I am going through some stuff.
When you leave here today, celebrate what you have accomplished, but look forward with an eye toward how you, too, can be the inspiration for others. Change can be good.
“I cannot wait to take you home babe” said Dean
"yes" Jack said
"I am all yours to take" he said and he meant it.
“Ok, I will check it out” said Dean
Jensen was a good man living in a small town that had found Misha, that was the angel´s name, walking under the heavy rain by the road. He had stopped to help him. offer him a safe place to stay.
"Sorry to hear that, our society is fucked somwerimes" said Dean sensing a sad story behind Gabriel's words.
“A new Nephilim is coming to be… now that I am here I feel the power that unborn child already has… I will not allow him to be” said Michael and Sam´s eyes showed a surge of panic. He had an archangel blade, but will he kill his own brother to protect that thing? Michael didn´t think so, Sam was bluffing.
"Dad ... this is Claire Novak, my girlfriend" he said holding her hand again so his nerves were under control.
Two months later they found out that all was going well and the were having 4 boys. The decided to name them as Oliver, Marcus, John and Benny. All was going alright.
"Well maybe you should think about what we might be doing wrong that we dont scream that loud...!" Jack said with an evil smile
“I love you all three very much” said Dean closing his eyes and thanking the Universe for letting him live this experience.
He had insinuated to his alpha, he had tried to put on sexy lingerie remembering that this belly was due to some garther belt, silk panties and transparent bralette. He didn't fit in any of those things anymore... but what is sexier than wearing nothing?
They all agree silently, the front door opened and Benny entered the house in his uniform. " I hope you didn't eat all the food"
Dean was a damm pro at making him cum his his tongue... jeez
“Are you kidding?” Dean looked at him “I don´t want to ever spend a night without you, I don´t want to spend a heat apart from you. I have dreamed for 5 years of this moment. I love you and I don´t want my knot to set you free…” Dean kissed him and he started moving slowly getting his knot to tug on his rim and chasing a second orgasm while kissing and licking at Cass´s pulse point.
"The tiniest of pups is a firefighter "  said Castiel " still scares the shit out of me" he confessed
"holier-than-thou" said Dean "but in the end, they are just like us. You are a smart cookie you know?" Dean said "Making people reflect of theology by writing a book about a gay couple in love.
"tell me more, you said broken, why?" asked Castiel
Not even a month after their love declarations Nature  took over all concerns and worries.  Dean and Cass had gone on dates, kissed, made out and touched each other in a sexual way but always with clothes one. Cass was feeling ready for the next step, he wanted to see Dean naked.
"Hello Mr Winchester, Castiel is right, sex will not hurt anybody as long as you dont apply excessive force of the belly, you will be fine. Enjoy each other" said the doctor finishing the call
“I feel pressure, like I need to push agaiiiiiin” said Cass in pain
“We mated the night before we were discharged, finally we could stop hiding and I was coming back home with my husband and I was going to confront dad and come out…” Dean said “Then the next morning we were called to discharge early and we were going to celebrate with a date but before that Cass wanted to visit his brother Gabriel, he worked at the embassy and he wanted to say hi before flying back home. The armed militia attacked the consulate, the bomb killed 102 people, injured severely another 100 or so… I was called to emergency evacuation of the other government offices, I wasn´t allowed to check on him for hours, I was recalled to help evacuate those in danger and when I finally arrived to the consulate…they told me” Dean felt tears rushing down his face and Cass`s scent was reacting to his sadness “It is alright Cass, I am sorry I was not there with you darling” he said sitting again and holding his hand lovingly.
“Oliver” Cass said
He told Dean everything and that broke Dean a little on the inside.
“Shut up Sam, you can´t stop me!” said Michael and he pushed both Jack and Sam into the wall and let them fall unconscious on the floor. He entered the room they had been eagerly protecting. He could feel that Castiel was there. He was the last line of de defense for that woman. Feeling Castiel´s damaged grace made Dean stir.
Early that day the tow truck had dragged an old oldsmobile to the restoration Bay. Cass saw it coming and suddendly he felt like crying. The distress dragged his mate attention.
"Can we remove our bloquers first? " Dean asked
Dean felt like crying. He decided to read it all again.
"Dum Alpha" said Cass  pushing Dean with a finger to make him look at him "I love you Dean, I think you are a wonderful father for Jack, you will be too for this baby" cass hugges him making him feel better inmediately
"We have been together for two years and we have recently discovered that ...that I am pregnant" he said
"Claire honeybee, are you mad?" Castiel asked afraid
"Goldel oldsmobile" said Gabriel
But still Dean would not  mount him, not even discussing penetration or knotting. He could smell Dean's scent when he masturbated in the shower once they were done....
“How are you two love birds?” Dean asked
"Can't believe time has passed so fast, first Bobby and now my little girl" said Dean
"You are an Omega?" he asked
“I felt the baby being born, I have a present for you” he said. Dean looked at him reluctant “I had never felt anything like that before”
“Oh. Alright” said Michael a little deflated. He felt a pang of rejection and turned around leaving towards his car.
"Dean? Is Claire alright?" he asked "Are you alright?"
"Castiel please lay down and I will tell you both everything" the doctor said. A little bit fumbling with the machine. Some gel and the machine belt over Cass lower belly and the doctor showed them the screen.
By morning the heat and rut were gone and in the bed Cass and Dean were sound asleep on wet bedsheets with love bites all over their bodies. Mating bites on their necks a a baby growing inside the Omega.
There were sitting in the audience Sammy and Bobby on their laps. All nicely dressed and quite emocional. Their kids  were graduating. And for the first time an Omega was valedictorian.
So Dean´s loyalty and bright soul was not his only strong point. He also fiercely loved and protected his family. Michael had been on the verge of losing control to Dean in that basement but he had recovered on time to flee.  He knew that understanding Dean and what made him tick that strongly was key to remain in control, next time he would be ready for the surge of power. Or so he thought.
“I need to return to work” Said Dean standing abruptly
"Trust me , the pleasure is all mine. I was looking forward to meet the man behind the book" Dean said taking Castiel´s luggage and pointing towards the car "this is us" Dean said and put the luggage in the trunk before opening the door for the author
"I am going to have a baby, there is a baby Claire" said Jack. Claire knelled by him and placed her hand over his belly.
He had a baby shower that Eileen had organized for them. It was nice to have all his family together. Brother included. Cass felt happy. They were having a girl.
