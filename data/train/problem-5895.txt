“Oh, I don’t know,” Tony said faux-seriously, looking around with a considering look. “A creepy basement and a bunch of psychos upstairs? Not my weirdest Tuesday.”
“No, mom.” Tony sighed deeply and ran his fingers over the leaves of a fake plant sitting on a plinth next to the downstairs phone. He’d always hated the thing, but for some reason it was suddenly drawing him in.
“It’s not all cuteness and sleepy reading times,” Tony said. “It’s hard and exhausting and he moans and cries like you wouldn’t believe. Stinks, too. And he’s messy. Oh, God, is he messy.”
Honestly, Steve couldn’t have recited the plot if there had been money riding on it. “Yeah, Great. You should watch it – if you get the chance, you know? If Peter… I don’t think it was kid-friendly, but, you – yeah. Was good.” Why couldn’t Steve stop talking?
Steve snorted and elbowed Tony in the side. “You do realise you don’t get that until bedtime, anyway, right?”
Tony’s shoulders slumped and he dropped down onto the floor, back against the wall as he looked around the bleak entranceway that was bare of anything remotely homey, never mind Christmassy.
“Pete, babes, it’s freezing and it’s getting late. We can’t really stay and help out – we were only coming here for a tree. And we still have to decorate it!”
Even if Tony chose to go it alone, Sarah had not one single doubt that he would do the very best that he could for his child. It was her secret. If Tony chose not to tell it, then she would take it to the grave. It would kill her, but something told her that she didn’t need to worry about that.
Tony blinked again, once, twice. When his tongue poked out to wet his dry mouth, a spot of blood pooling right in the middle of his bottom lip as Tony reopened a wound, Steve wanted to punch something. “I know.”
“That!” Peter cried, reaching out to grab at Tony’s coat. “Did you hear it? Mr. Sam says it’s coming from the tree.”
“Yeah.” Peter nodded quickly and repeatedly until Steve reached out and placed his hand on his head to stop his nodding-dog impersonation. “‘S so cool here! And we have a big tree now! Could get an ever bigger one next year and Steve could help us decorate it again.”
Tony shivered in the cold morning air as he exited the taxi, shoving his wallet back into his pocket with icy hands. The sooner he had a hot shower and dived deep below his covers, the better. He walked up to his apartment almost by muscle memory alone. He was barely awake enough for coherent thoughts, never mind rational thinking, which is why he didn’t question why his front door was unlocked and the lights had been switched back on.
“About 3 hours,” Steve replied, face falling. He put his newspaper down and fixed Tony with a concerned look. “You really need to go back to bed.”
Before Steve could say anything, Peter nodded. “Yes,” he said solemnly. “The owl hasn’t got a mommy or a daddy, like me. So they need to take him away to find a Tony and a May.”
Tony couldn’t keep a straight face. He reached over quickly and deposited his mug onto his bedside table, wanting instead to shuffle down the bed and curl up against Steve’s side. “You’re a prick.”
“Captain. I do apologize I was not here to meet you. No one informed me you had arrived.” Justin shot Virginia an accusing glance and the housekeeper just stared back at him, as impenetrable as fortress.
“There’s no more room!” The man whose auto they’d accosted yelled, jerking the car forward and tearing off down the street before Artur had even managed to wriggle far enough to drag the door shut behind Steve. The strangers’ eyes were wide as dinner plates, the little hair he had falling into his face.
"What about the monks? Maybe the abbey - " Scott began, but he trailed off as the back door opened and a man in a long coat shuffled into the alley. There was nothing to identify him openly as a threat. His clothes were neat and plain, and it wasn't uncommon for a man to want to smoke in peace. But Steve suspected there was more to him than met the eye. His back was too straight.
When Tony was agitated, his eyes tended to get this sharp look about them, until they got almost as cutting as Steve knew that his tongue could. In a strange way, he enjoyed that about Tony. The constant pushback, the underlining challenge in almost every interaction that made Steve long for a moment of sure privacy because he'd like to know if Tony could keep pushing that smart mouth of his going with Steve's hands on him. He thought not.
“Maybe next time,” Péter told him with a regretful smile. He’d love to see England, but he needed to go home more. Ned seemed to understand, his smile dimming as he sighed.
Now they had Stark of course, and there was always Bucky who would keep a watchful eye on them when he could.
If you’re up there God, Tony prayed silently long after he’d lost any sign of the boy’s movements. Watch over him.
"I didn't say that," he went with in place of lying, because really there was enough of that going around already. "And while I'm happy to allow you to use my given name, I'm not sure your uncle would be as appreciative or that your father would approve."
“God knows we’re all worried. I can barely get my Gunter to slurp a soup these days in between his fretting.” The cook muttered before finally relenting.
Major Rogers flew by, barking how appalled he was at the men's formation. Becker huffed loudly, pulling his pack closer to his body and looking over his shoulder at the red-faced line of boys shuffling along behind him.
The resistance could ill afford to lose good men. But for the men gathered here, there was no sacrifice too great to repay that debt.
Sara immediately ran to Tony throwing herself into his arms and he held her tight, beginning to shake. And it might have been considered odd, that Tony began to shake now, the threat of tears pricking at his eyes now that the danger had passed. But that was just the thing wasn’t it? The danger hadn’t passed at all.
Péter wiggled in his seat, words all but battling their way past his closed lips as he tilted his head, eyes questioning.
The captain had not joined them for lunch (yet again). Upon learning from Pepper that he and Bakhuizen had departed before lunch that day to parts unknown, and that they were not expected for dinner, gone were the children’s hopes of seeing him at all.
He’d resolved to try and dig up some dirt on the man by going to the children (because they were the best source) starting with James because Péter while the eldest was too trusting in nature. Watching him and Stark together it was easy to see that Péter liked the monk and anything he had to say would follow along the lines of burgeoning hero worship.
Steve jumped, shock ripping through him. Natacha backed away from the chair with wide eyes, the hand he’d slapped away still hovering in the air.
Dvořák snorted, but he was curious despite himself. Who could Rogers be writing to that would take the time to read a penned letter from him? No one had time to decipher cave drawings.
Between administering the solution and keeping him clean, watered, and fed, Tony could easily have driven himself into an early grave of his own if not for Bucky and the others. Between him and Harold they managed to tear Tony away from Stefen’s bedside occasionally, and Péter and Natacha stepped up to help run the house with Virginia and Charlotte.
In his defense, the captain made for a beautiful sight, all quick powerful movements and grace. He was smiling in such pure unfettered enjoyment, feeling every moment, every raw grunt and breath. Tony had never seen anything so alive as Stefen was alive while sparring with his best friend.
"But the sun is still out, how can we sleep when-" James, undeterred, continued to protest but he fell silent when the captain pinched the bridge of his nose and snapped.
Lt. Stevens cleared his throat poignantly, glaring the man opposite him into silence and fought an effort to grit his teeth in annoyance.  He didn't like the way that Hammer spoke about Major Rogers. It had nothing to do with station and everything to do with service. Major Rogers had given his blood for this country and should be respected for his contributions. The allegations against him were serious - and the truth behind them no matter how damning, would not change that in Dieter's eyes.
“If we’re still here in ten hours, Frauline Boehringer is going to bring us fresh baked pie and a seasoned roast. No more of this goulash shit.” Bucky explained to the curious eyes that met him and Parodi lifted his cup in a mock salute, the slush inside slopping loudly. Steve licked his dry lips, his stomach rolling over itself in protest. Sweat trickled down his face and he wiped it away, agitated.
Stefen pulled him closer and Tony tensed, thinking he was about to be kissed and somehow terrified of that fact, but Stefen just tucked Tony tight to his chest, arms wrapping securely around his back and held him. Tony shuddered, eyes closing as he clutched the back of Stefen’s shirt.
“So, this was about vengeance?” the monk asked quietly, with an air of familiar disappointment. All of the other brothers at St. Péter’s had given up on straightening Tony out within his first year at the abbey. Only Bruce never seemed to give up hope. Though these days, he seemed more inclined to settle on just leading Tony to some semblance of genuine faith rather than good sense.
"I'll be as quick as I can. Sounds like we caught whatever it is early, yeah? Erskine can't have gone far with all this snow we're having. I'll be back before nightfall you'll see."
Though Tony combated him often, Tony could admit privately that he did not hate this part of Stefen. That unwavering commitment to duty and justice was as much a part of Stefen’s soul as it was his training. And Tony could never truly hate anything that kept Stefen alive. Time was all they needed, and pride was not too high a cost to pay. What was pride to either of them now? Tony could make his voice small and gentle; he could sit at Stefen’s feet with hands folded and telegraph the faithful obedience of a postulant if that would speak to the soul of the man.
They weren't hunting for food. The women were loud enough to scare away any bird with half a brain. Not to mention his aunt had a laugh that could be heard through the mountains. Not work. Not hunting. Play. It took him back to playing with smooth beads while his mother nursed him, fat baby fingers turning over silvery coins and rolling cool beads between them, again and again.
Sixth of February. Two days until... the 8th. Ian’s birthday. Four weeks after Maria’s. She would be six, Ian twelve. If they...
The police had answered the call to crack down on crime by arresting more and more of the cities displaced and desperate, whenever the whim took them.  The Italian government had always thought poorly of the Slavic nationals who had called these shores home through the changing of borders, and the prejudiced treatment dished out to ‘
“It’s about the fact that from the time we were small we were told this was something we should not want. You will have emotions about that, whether you’ve taken the time to consider them or not.” Tony insisted, knocking Stefen pointedly with his knee in place of knocking him over the head.
Bucky caught his eye, but Steve only really relaxed when the policeman’s boots had carried him down the street and away from the door of number three Hügel street. When the street was clear once more, the small side door at the base of the building opened, and a man who matched the description he’d been given for Ben Grimm – square jawed with sun roughened features and medium brown hair – stepped out.
“That you are.” Tony conceded with a placating nod, spotting Julia passing the stage with a loaded tray of drinks and leaning down to snag her attention as an idea leapt into mind.
Philips barked a dry laugh, the wrinkles deepening on his face.  He turned to amble his way back inside, but turned his head to call over his shoulder, “Get your skinny ass in here Rogers. You’re letting all my heat out.”
"They aren't criminals," Tony interjected. "Not any more than the brothers are criminal anyway. I know you organized their release -"
Steve had left with Magda and there was no telling where. They couldn’t actually have headed to the train station. Could they? Steve had to realize it was suicide to try and board a train. But a month sleeping in a barn eating goat feed wouldn’t have gone far enough to heal him from the injuries Bucky had seen. With a sinking feeling Bucky turned and jogged back toward the car. He knew Steve, and he knew exactly what kind of risks he’d take for the people he loved.
He had to stop thinking about them. Had to accept that they were gone – many dead – and that his hands weren’t any cleaner than those boys with their batons. Not when he’d
Teeth clenched, Tony repositioned the syringe and pushed the needle into the soft flesh apologizing silently all the while.
Frau Hogan had been picking up his shirt, grimy and ruined with blood, when she’d discovered the folded letter poking out of the lining of his jacket. She’d pulled it out and looked to him questioningly. Steve had held out his hand, feeling a flicker of pride when it did not shake.
Péter stared at the snow falling outside the window of the music room thinking hard. He wasn't really paying attention to the lesson Tony was giving Maria, and he'd long since tuned out the sound of Artur and James playing with the set of toy cars that James had gotten for Christmas on the rug.
Ian gave a tiny giggle at the ticklish touch, holding on to Steve’s forearm with one hand. His eyes still closed in a look of contentment.
"What is the meaning of this?" he heard Stefen bark in the hall and the cold reply of an anonymous officer.
“You alright Stevie?” Bucky asked, eyes fixed on him with concern. Steve nodded slowly even though he doubted it would fool his friend. He didn’t need to explain to Bucky about seeing nightmares, even when he was awake.
Switzerland. The nearest and most obvious refuge from the reach of the Third Reich. The most obvious direction for any man on the run to run in and exactly the direction he needed to head in to get to his children. The train would pass through a tunnel and cut across the alps. He’d get off at the station before and make his way to the cabin from there. A long journey even so, but by god, a chance now. A real chance.
His first year at the abbey he hadn’t slept a wink. In truth his night terrors had been so vivid (recalling the deaths of his parents and the loss of Yinsen in such lurid detail) he’d feared the moment he closed his eyes each night. He did not know who had given the Father Superior the idea to allow him to turn the old stable into a workshop (if indeed it hadn’t been Farkas’ idea all along) but he had no doubt it had saved his mind, if not his life. It was hard to remember that first year. He’d spent so much of it drunk that was hardly a surprise.
Ian should have stayed, at least to comfort Maria but, but he didn't want to. He didn’t know what that meant.
Steve shed his suit jacket, letting it drop to the floor in a puddle of cloth and resisted the urge to rub a hand over his face.
The beer tasted sour in his mouth, though supposedly it was some of the best local brew around. He'd have to be sure and lie to Willamina later, and say he'd enjoyed every last drop, but as it was Tony could barely taste the stuff as he swallowed. That didn't keep him from swallowing a great mouthful, drinking until he had to come up for air and praying for the drunkenness to come quick. It was a party after all. Why should he let a little thing like Stefen’s engagement ruin it for him?
Bucky scoffed and shrugged off the thanks, clapping a hand against Steve’s back in a familiar gesture of silent agreement to just let bygones be bygones.
“Stefen please.” Charlotte implored, drawing his attention to the hand she had on her chest and then to her softly pleading gaze. “This is not your fault. And I know how much you want to be out there, searching for him but you know you can’t be.”
The army had put Dvorak up at the Goathead, a small inn on the outskirts of town. The army had taken up all the available rooms in the inn. Other than the innkeeper’s staff, the only people Bucky observed coming and going on the grounds that day were military. It made his mission there that day all the harder. If Dvorak raised the alarm he’d be in a tight spot; but having no other choice, Bucky proceeded.
“Why’s it so cold?” Péter’s voice pulled his gaze back into the kitchen, where Péter now stood in the doorway still in his night clothes and eyes puffy from sleep.
"No. Not at all!" He was going about this all wrong. Beside him Charlotte sighed and Steve snapped his mouth shut with a click before he could continue making a mess of it.
As if pulled by the thought, Steve’s gaze landed on Tony - an unusually quiet presence standing in the middle of the hubbub, who was holding a silent teary-eyed Maria to his side and gently stroking her shoulder as they waited for the group to make its way indoors.
“No. It changes nothing!” Tony insisted, aggravated, rising slightly in his chair as he glared up at Steve.  “I’m still a Jew, whether I’m having dinner here or in Berlin. They’re still burning us out right here in Salzburg like we’re rats. I’m going, to stop them, because I must, and if you don’t want me in your house when I get back, that is fine I can -”
There was another boy with Herr Klein besides Cameron. He was introduced as Daniel, the eldest. Tony couldn’t help but be glad that at least Cameron’s older brother seemed to be made of sturdier stuff.
He spotted a trio of boys on patrol, their uniforms standing out in the grey weather, their batons catching the dying light as they swung them idly, in an unspoken threat at odds with their good cheer and boisterous laughter. To think, only a few nights before he’d watched those same batons beat the backs of the innocent, driving them out of their homes like cattle and pushing others into death. Tony’s stomach wound tight with tension but he forced himself to continue his walk at a steady pace.
"Alright, I yield. Christ in heaven you Rogers will be the death of me." Tony chuckled into his hands and Péter's face split into an elated grin.
“You’re coming too Father?” Artur seemed to catch on first, blue eyes going wide with tremulous hope and Tony’s heart tugged. Around the table the other six were clearly in agreement, a chorus of voices ringing out in variations of enticement.
The church was open to the public for prayer and confession during the daylight hours. A few minutes after they had arrived an attendant had come by to ask if any of them needed to see a priest. Tony had answered for all of them in his smooth, well-practiced French and the man had left them to their solitude without a second thought.  If he had any questions about the family who had arrived early and stayed past lunch hour, he did not come back and ask them. None of the others who came to pray or give confession seemed to pay them any mind either, too wrapped up in their individual worries.
Frau Hogan paused, her eyebrows raising as she took in his wadded jacket on the floor before sliding the envelope onto the desk, her brow furrowed. Steve lowered the pen. He could already feel he wasn't going to like what came next.
Werner appeared occupied by Hammer who grandly welcomed her. When he informed her of the captain’s regrets that he could not be there himself, her lips turned down in a disapproving frown and Tony swore Hammer broke out into a sweat.
“Yes. Yes, just-fuck.” Tony cursed - too loudly in the quiet but he didn’t care, couldn’t care - bucking his hips up into Stefen’s fist. He felt Stefen smile against his shoulder just before he sped up the motion of his thrusts.
When Stefen did not answer Tony wasn’t discouraged. Captain Rogers was not a verbose sort and Tony could do enough talking for six people.
“The prisoners release was organized through Commandant Lachmann.” He began to recite. “We have papers from him but there will be a discrepancy between their copy and ours. The head of the political department, Unterstumfuhrer Grabnder, will be overseeing the hand off; but if he keeps to pattern he will have passed the task off to his henchman, Warden Johaness. Chief lieutenant Wolfe is his underman and also our man on the inside...”
Steve grit his teeth. There was a tone to the way Hammer spoke his title now, a subtle jeer as if he were smirking behind his teeth.
Thankfully his younger siblings immediately latched on to the request. They were anxious over James’ condition and Tony’s looming departure in the morning. Everyone was. Tony told them a story about his childhood, in a city by the sea that sounded magical to Ian, and how his mother used to sing him to sleep when he was worried or sick like James.
“Yes, you do. And for what it’s worth, whatever you think anyone else might want or need from you, I am glad you have decided to be true to yourself.” Tony knew it was time to address the elephant in the room. “But if I could say something about the woman that I met this afternoon? I don’t know who that was or what she was doing, but I need
He stepped back quickly, as if she had transformed into a snake, knocking into Tony who had just come down the stairs.
He exhaled, wincing as his ribs throbbed and he gingerly rolled till he was sitting up, rubbing his face with one hand.
Stark." the man finally sniffed, his lip curling into a sneer as his gaze moved over Tony.  Despite how unhappy he looked the sour faced monk retrieved a key from the ring on his belt and slowly opened the locks.  He took his sweet time moving the heavy metal bar that held the door shut, but when it was free and he began to open the heavy door with a loud creaking, Tony impatiently pushed from the front, knocking the man aside who let out a shocked squawk. Péter scrambled after Tony as he slipped inside the abbey, not wishing to be left alone with the irate monk.
Steve didn’t say anything for an uncomfortably long time. He tilted his hand and let the string of beads dangle off the end of his fingers, the coins hanging from it clinking together as they swung ever so slightly. He watched them as if fascinated and Tony tried not to squirm, bit back the words that wanted to leap off of his tongue.
“Rogers, midterm is right around the corner. We need to pass this course! Only fifteen percent of Professor Zola’s second year students ever pass his class the first go around!” Ned reminded him for the umpteenth time, subdued awe mingling with horror in his tone as he hissed, “I don’t want to sit through another term with Zola, do you?”
She quickly slipped out of her room and darted out onto the balcony, crouching down on her knees until she could peer through the railing down into the hall below. Charlotte was standing under the chandelier; her fists clenched, a letter scrunched in her hand, her posture as stiff as a pole. There was a flush on the back of her neck and Natacha was sure that if she could have seen the baroness’s face it would have been bright red.
As he should! Tony thought with panic, eyes flying to where Natacha and James were huddled on the floor, both thankfully unharmed. He couldn’t say the same for the door to the cabin, which had several large holes in it. The gun fire had ripped through the ceiling and into the bottom and sides of the hull. Water was gushing in through at least four holes that Tony could see from his limited vantage.
Stefen smiled but it didn’t reach his eyes. He squeezed Tony tighter and Tony burrowed deeper into his embrace, suddenly feeling chilled wherever their bodies failed to touch.
face for that matter. He wanted to be above the feeling, but he wasn’t. He still found himself looking at his uncle Isiah and Grig at odd moments, sneaking glances at them out of the corner of his eye just to experience it again and again. Like a man addicted.
What had he expected was going to happen between him and Captain Rogers anyway? That they were going to run off to Switzerland and live happily ever after like a pair of old bachelor buddies?
“May we?” Steve asked for lack of anything better to say, gesturing to a nearby settee. Tony flipped his hand at him, indicating that they should sit, before his fingers returned to swishing over the keys.
“You look well enough. I will say that, but I would like to speak to you privately regarding how you’ve been treated since you’ve been stationed here.”  Tony announced as planned and Bruce, going right along with it gently nodded.
Natacha stared at him, watching the way he formed each word. He was direct because Father was always direct. Mother had said it was the soldier in him. She'd said he couldn’t always leave the captain at the door. Back then she’d said they could help him by not banging about and making loud or sudden noises and by giving him extra long hugs. She remembered liking that, believing with a little girl’s selfishness that she was actually helping her father with the simple act of wrapping her arms around him at any given opportunity.
Ian opened his mouth, maybe to yell, but he'd never know what would have come out because Natacha jabbed him sharply in the rib with her elbow under the guise of stepping toward Rita, whose eyes widened nervously as they met his sister's flinty stare.
The hall was silent as a tomb, so it echoed like a scream when he grasped the fabric in both hands and tore it savagely in two, leaving the pieces to pool at his feet.
“You didn't go out and work with him?” Tony had always pictured them inseparable. Like peas in a pod.
Shifting again he thought miserably that his collar was too tight. His dress uniform was stiff, and pressed to within an inch of its life. God, but he hated having to dress up and play these games. He wasn’t any good at them. He wouldn’t do it, he decided with a fit of ill temper. There was nothing he could do to change the past and his family’s future was all that mattered now. There was no way forward but to be honest with Charlotte.
“Tony made a glue.” Peter explained as if he’d read his mind. “It smells rotten but I don’t think you’ll care if it works.”
Tony opened his mouth to reply but paused when Natacha suddenly appeared out of the brush, moving far quieter than either of her siblings. Tony had to keep a closer eye on the youngest children when he ventured out with them, so Natacha was circling them at a distance looking out for danger. She had her hunting rifle tightly held between her hands in a white knuckled grip and there was a look in her eye that gave Tony nothing but alarm.
“And how is Jon?” Steve asked out of politeness as Susann tidied up. She made a rude sound under her breath as she gathered the magazines on the coffee table into a small stack.
“I’ve scheduled a shipment of ammunition to be delivered to Berlin on the 27th.  You and your men are assigned to that shipment, but if you should come under suspicion once you leave the factory, I’m afraid I can’t back you up.” Vis concluded, and Bucky stood, clapping a hand down on the taller man’s shoulder and squeezed it. “You’ve stuck your neck out far enough as it is,” he said with a small sigh, frowning in contemplation.
All her life she'd been taught the importance of obeying her authorities, and Father more so than most relied on their ability to follow command. He needed to know that they would behave because he couldn't always be there for them, not even when he was in the same room, and he didn't want them to get hurt.
This was directed at Péter and Natacha, who nodded in agreement (Natacha with far more eagerness than Péter and Tony was not the only one to notice). His eyes narrowing on Péter, Rogers laid a hand on the boy’s thin shoulders, spoke the child’s name quietly, prompting the adolescent boy to finally meet his gaze.
“They will still be pariahs. My parents would never agree to it. I’ve done all I can Frau Hogan.” She informed the housekeeper, turning back to the task of packing her trunks. She couldn’t help but add over her shoulder, “it is a pity their father did not help them while he could.”
“I happen to agree with you Bucky but I don’t think the police care.” Stefen drawled. “They’ve offered a reward for anyone with information about them and have placed restrictions on selling paint. They intend to catch them, and I have it on good authority that when they do they’ll be made examples of through torture and execution. I -”
James didn’t go with the others to wave goodbye because it was pointless, and the way that everyone kept looking at him as if they expected him to explode at any moment made him mad. It wasn’t like James had never been left before. Father had always left them behind. Only it hadn’t mattered as much at first because he had mama, but then his mother had gotten sick. She’d left too. Everybody left eventually.
“One nation, one empire one leader! But a man’s got to stop and have drink and enjoy himself now and again yes? You ought to bring the children next time, they’ll love-”
Ian was given the last command and he lifted his arm straight out, fingers uncurling to present the General with his father’s new insignia.
Tony’s mouth was close to Steve’s ear, and the timber of his voice low enough that he doubted anyone but himself could hear it but still Steve shivered, tension tightening his spine.
“Przepraszam,” Steve babbled the apology, cringing as the foreign words leaped off his tongue and the man’s brow wrinkled in confusion. Too much dwelling on the past. He had slipped.
Tony laughed. Winking at Stefen he opened his mouth and quietly added his voice to hers as he gently rubbed Artur’s back.
Wouldn't it just be the love story for the ages? Hortense the wallflower and Herr Stark, the monk who drank like a fish and slept with the father of his charges because he was a god damned fool.
Frauline Werner had been so pleased to learn that Father had been invited along with the Baroness. She had prepared Natacha in advance, urging her to memorize the heads of the four other families as well as their wives and children.
War was a bloody business, and businessmen didn’t let go of valuable assets because fair play said they should. Sure, Tony had spent the majority of his life in a monastery, but he was trained by the sharpest businessman in the world. Hughard Stark had nothing on Niklas Farkas, and Tony had a plan that didn’t even rely on him calling in the one-eyed bastard; but first they had to survive the mission and make it back to English shores, and before even that, they had to get out of Pola with Stanislov none the wiser.
Tony watched Natacha closely but her expression was guarded. He could not tell how his words had landed with her at all. Perhaps even now she intended to go to Pepper or Hammer to tell them about the things that Tony had said. So be it.
“Tony!” he called out in warning (in need) holding his breath in the moment of silence that followed. And then finally, from inside he heard Tony snap.
Steve knew thinking about the family he would build one day made Bucky happy, and he tried not to show Bucky how much the game bothered him – they both knew that even if Steve could save up enough to pay a bride price, there wasn’t any respectable roma girl who would have him.
“So, the boy did and they flew across mountains and valleys, until they reached a place where a large fire was visible on the horizon. The dragon shared with the boy that his parents could be found at the large fire. The boy was to go to them and tell them that he knew where their long lost son was. But whatever they did and however they threatened him, he must not tell them where to find their son until the father dragon relinquished the magic stone he kept under his tongue.”
Kroger said something about his prowess, but Steve had turned back to Bucky who was looking back at him now, watching Steve with expressionless eyes.
Nobody spoke but Tony could see Péter sitting up now, staring as intently at his father as he imagined everyone else was. Waiting.
His seat was perfectly positioned to be gawked at, every inch scrutinized, and to catch every word aimed like arrows from every direction. Questions shot so fast toward him at times, he couldn't keep up. Every probing glance, and shark toothed smile aimed him crawling over his skin like creeping insects until it was hard not to twitch and start swatting at his skin. He was at a disadvantage in this arena and they all knew it.
“I’ll have to.” Steve barked back but rather than cow her the woman just dug her heels in, as stubborn as her goat.
“Don't you ever say those words! Never again.”  He’d hissed, grabbing him by the shirt collar and the boy had looked up at him with the shine of terror in his eyes.
There was a clanging from somewhere in the front, and Steve looked on through the wired fence, watching the Krippo scurry like ants to prepare for new arrivals. More prisoners on trains to be unloaded and disbursed all over Dachau. The putt put putter, clang clang clang, of transport trucks, trains, and single vehicles. All shuffling more and more people through the gates of hell.
“Listen,” Harry began again, gentler this time. “I came to tell you that I’ve been selected for the school in Vienna.”
Though that was about as ominous as a thunder cloud Tony had little choice but to comply.  He wondered franticly for a moment as he walked toward Stefen if this wasn’t going to be the moment that the other shoe dropped, because really you couldn’t come on to your (very) male employer the way that Tony had and not get your ass kicked (right?). Maybe he really had only imagined that Stefen was attracted to him. Maybe he hadn’t been about to pull Tony into a kiss at all when Bakhuizen had interrupted them. Maybe he was about to find himself fired and kicked out in the cold, or worse reported to the authorities. Okay, that last was unlikely what with all signs pointing to Stefen being a secret anarchist but that didn’t mean he’d tolerate a homosexual in his household. Even if that accusation would only be half true the point still stood.
The concern there was enough to warm Steve from head to toe and banish all the doubts from a moment before. Somehow, even after seeing for himself what Steve was capable of, Tony didn’t fear him.
“What? No. It wasn’t… I don’t…” the boy fumbled. “It was Harry! He’s my friend, but Father doesn’t like him. Please Herr Stark he must’nt know!”
The people thought he was just putting on a show, calling them the nation’s greatest treasure, but there was no show about it. Steve and the children were all that Bucky had left of family and the familia besides his sister. But Rochel had her own family now, and Bucky never could stand to be in a room with her very long with her eyes still blaming him for breaking their mothers heart, even where her tongue would never.
Still, Tony could not help but look out upon the water and see those rows and rows of battleships moored side by side as little more than sitting ducks, enticing the enemy to make another strike.
The days that followed were miserable things. They didn’t eat. Food that could little afford to be wasted went cold, Tony and the children to a man losing their appetite for it. They didn’t sleep. Every night Tony would sit in the chair, the bed crammed tight again with as many children as it could hold, staring out the window while the children sniffled and stared at the ceiling, static from the radio buzzing in their ears. Every minute of every day the thing was on now, filling the silence, filling their ears, failing to provide distraction from their desperation as the days ticked down and no sudden news arrived of Stefen’s escape.
“We’ve even talked about having a party for your birthday. A chance for you to see all your friends again.”
Dr. Fischer said nothing for a moment, his clear blue eyes hard and assessing Dvorak with the laser focus of a crow eyeing the last breaths of the injured. Finally, he turned his head to stare ahead and said, “I go where I’m told.”
Tony, the Rogers, and their guide – a rather ordinary looking Jewish fellow named Luzzato who looked better suited for a desk than for this sort of work –  had left the Genoa office under the cover of night. Luzzato lead them to the coast, where a small sail boat was docked. Its captain had been waiting for them there, and seemed anxious to be off. They hadn’t traded introductions as Luzzato had urged them quickly to board, and it didn’t sit well with Tony that he would never know the name of the man who had helped them escape Italy that cold morning in early spring.
“Don’t I know it. Everyone’s slow out of bed this morning. Poor Cameron is going to catch it when he finally shows his face. Though Hammer’s not here yet either and that’s the oddest bit. Poor Harold’s down with the furnace now, though he looks ready to fall over dead. Poor man.”
“You ever heard of Stark Industries?” he asked slowly, staring into his drink as Kirk’s laughter died. The blond let loose an incredulous snort.
Tony followed Ian’s gaze. The captain was kneeling over the fire pit, setting stones about the rim, seemingly in deep conversation with Bakhuizen who was holding an armful of them, handing them off when Stefen gestured for them.
Or anyone, he thought as Péter grabbed his arm, his hand squeezing tight and pulling until he forced Steve to slow. On autopilot Steve brought his elbow up thinking, ‘
He immediately turned to glance at the man laying asleep in the bed beside him. The way that Stefen’s hair was mussed and falling boyishly across his brow made him look at peace. His skin, touched with gold from so much time in the sun, was smooth and supple with none of the days worries yet to carry. Tony needed to go, before someone spotted him slipping from the captain’s room in the early hours of the morning but Tony couldn’t resist taking just one moment more to look at him.
“Who are you thinking of?” He asked, curious, because Tony would not endanger his relatives, and knew better than to think it wouldn’t be easy for the Italian authorities to draw the dots between them and fugitive Antony Stark.
“He’s trying to give him morphine for the pain, even though I’ve explained to him that Major Rogers is deathly allergic to morphine.” The woman hurriedly explained, accusation and fury snapping through her tone despite the threat of being hauled bodily from the room.
Steve. We put him through a lot, and writing the scene where he's forced to deal with his attraction to Tony was weeks of back and forth and planning for us. lol writing the nuances behind sex is difficult (so please let us know what you thought)!
The captain and Bakhuizen had arrived for breakfast that morning and announced that they would be taking the children for the day, giving Tony the freedom to do as he pleased. Tony had been forced to ask him to repeat what he’d said twice before it had really sunk in that Stefen not only intended to spend the entire day with his children unaided… he also seemed
Who was going to look out for Ian and keep him from murdering James? Who was going to make sure that Artur didn’t try to go searching in the lake for alligators again? And what were Anamarie and the other X-Men going to do without him?
“It’s shameful how many people seem content to just leave the poor wretches to their lot. We’re damned lucky there is finally someone in power with the backbone to stick up for decent hard working Germans. It’s a new world out there, let France and Britain blow their horns all they want. The Führer’s armies will make them regret it. You’ll see” the man crowed. Tony wanted to smack him.
“You never told him you meant this exact month! That makes it a trick,” the boy insisted and Tony grit is teeth in irritation.
"Brother Simone says you're to follow me," the freckled face novice who had been sent to wake them said in a low urgent tone, obviously trying to avoid waking or drawing the attention of any of the other bodies lying scattered about the barn. Tony had sat up, meeting Bruce's eyes and taking in the grim expression on the other man’s face before he'd shoved aside the thick wool blankets that had protected them from the damp interior of the barn and gotten up stiffly from the floor, to follow his nameless guide out to the paddock where the sheep were kept. A lonely Brother with a cheerful round face was the only one set to watch them, and he looked thrilled enough at the idea of heading back indoors that he barely glanced at Tony when the novice relieved him of his duties for the morning per the Sub-Prior's orders.
Some old bitterness whispered through the back of his mind and Steve clenched his jaw, resolutely pushing the thought away. He was beginning to think too much like Bucky, who wanted the comforts of a gadje life but not to belong. In Bucky’s mind, exile or no exile, they would always be Rom and it would always be us against them. But it didn’t have to be that way. People were better than that. They could find a way to all live together. Besides, who said it was so great being Rom anyway? Steve wasn’t ashamed of it but there was no point in acting as if the Roma didn’t have their backwards ways or their faults. The way his mother’s people had shunned her just for falling in love with someone different for instance. It just wasn’t right, that even if Tony had been a girl the familia would have rejected them both because he wasn’t Rom.
But Tony was surprised by the man who showed up with Cameron the following morning. He had Cameron’s dark hair and eyes, and a long thin torso that seemed to go on for miles until his head was in danger of knocking on the doorframe. It forced him to duck just to enter the kitchen. Joshua Klein was skinner than a wild carrot, and at first sight of him Tony worried he wouldn’t have the strength for the work.
Stark’s invitation at breakfast had taken them both by surprise (the man’s audacity was as irritating as it was intriguing) but Bucky found himself agreeing with the monk in this one instance. Steve had missed the kids something terrible while they’d been in Vienna, but now that they were here he could barely look at them.
It was the sight of those doors wide open, the curtains pulled back so that bright afternoon sunshine spilled over every surface. It was like stepping back in time to three years ago when Steve would have come home and expected to find Peggy here, perhaps with James in her lap tinkling away at the piano while Natacha danced circles around Péter. Ian would be curled up in a chair, sounding through one of his books…
“Vienna is too dangerous. Kirk won’t put his men in danger by going back there. The closest he can meet us is their stop Budapest. We get them on the ship, he’ll take it from there.” Bucky answered the question with a grim expression and Tony’s stomach tightened with unease. The pieces were coming together and not putting together a very pretty picture. Thirty minutes, Steve and Bucky with three escaped prisoners in uncertain condition, and miles between them and safety.
“Don’t answer that!” he snapped, whipping his head back around only to be taken by the complete surprise of Stefen’s arm sliding around his waist and one hand firmly taking ahold of his jaw to position Tony’s mouth just where he wanted it.
"Good morning Children," he greeted them gently, rethinking his plans to go and visit the abbot that morning. He knew why he had to take the mission, but there was still time before they had to be in Dachau.  Maybe the children needed him more.  He doubted very much that their father was capable right now of paying much attention to the state they were in, or would know what to do about it even if he was.
“Not a first, not till I was seven or so. I was too sickly, and my lungs were a mess. I had to stay behind and do women's work with Rachol and Ma.” Steve replied with a rattling laugh, a little wet with phlegm. “Though I’m nearly certain ‘women’s work’ almost did me in. The women in my caravan took care of everything; and Ma was a healer, so her work was never done. Between following her and the Aunt’s I was almost glad when I was deemed well enough to go out with the men.”
"Because you know what's good for you," Tony murmured leaning over to press his mouth softly against Steve's, a whisper of a kiss.  “And because I’ve asked Bucky to take over your exercises and somehow, I doubt he’s as soft a touch as I am.”
Yes, yes, it was all part of a larger design to kill you, but ends must! James’ asthma was keeping him from breathing while his body tried to fight off an infection. He needed intervention and he needed it quickly.
She should have been on top of the world and yet Natacha behaved as if she were just going through the motions; as if none of it held real meaning for her any more.
But how would he even know if it had? Tony knew nothing of the resistance and its movements besides the limited role Stefen had allowed him to play. If something had gone wrong he would have sent word with Clint, Tony tried to reassure himself, but his mind was too quick to remind him that something terrible could just as easily have become of Clint (and Tony could think of numerous tragedies that could befall a young boy traveling alone no matter how clever he was).
He’d come so close to losing Tony, just like he’d lost Péter. The children could have been hurt or worse, but instead
"The uniform I wear used to mean something proud. I wear it now in order to do what I can to help others, but firstly to protect our family. You probably think you understand the Nazis, that standing up to them is as easy as deciding to act but you're not a father Péter. Your uniform isn't all that stands between your children and horrible death."
The pistol was in his suitcase, which Clint still had Tony thought wildly even as Bucky ordered him sharply to take the wheel. He didn’t give Tony any time to argue about it either, forcing the monk to lurch for it to keep them on the road as he wound his window down and twisted his torso to lean out it, heedless of the bullets whizzing past him to return fire.
“Yes, Father. I’ll watch over them,” Péter was assuring Rogers even as his brother Ian stepped forward with a march in his step, his shoulders braced and hands clasped tightly behind his back as if he were addressing a commanding officer.
She allowed herself to be manhandled into a chair as Lang set the alcohol and bandages down.  He batted away the shaking hands she was using to try and lift her shirt from her trousers, and rolled up the offending garment himself, eyes locking on the small wound on her left side. It was seeping blood only a little. Jann had done a fine job of stopping the blood flow by wrapping it tightly, but there was no telling whether or not the bullet had passed cleanly through or lodged inside her without undoing her careful work.
“In exchange for that commendable service, the Grant children -” Holmes expanded, looking meaningfully at Stefen, “– are to be granted asylum and excluded from policy present or future regarding enemy aliens.”
It was all too much. The moment the last course was served and Steve saw a chance to excuse himself he took it, leaving his chair and claiming a need to find a bathroom. He went promptly to where Charlotte and the children were seated, uncaring how it looked, and telling them plainly that it was time to say goodnight and to follow him to their rooms.
She’d known how to tell the children when it was okay to be loud and when they must be quiet without shattering their innocence and turning their home into a tomb.
“There is no discord between them and your father I hope? They were so very disappointed after Margrit married, but one must carry on and put a good face on things.”
But his own shortcomings aside Steve was grateful for the man, more grateful than he knew how to express. Maybe that was why his character had taken on Tony's likiness?
He put all his strength behind it and swung the broom, ducking when the glass gave way, a few of the raining shards nicking his bare skin despite raising his arm to shield himself. He righted himself quickly, gesturing for Tony and in an instant Tony was there beside him, looking up at the window with a dazed expression. Steve grabbed his shoulder and brown eyes met his.
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean I-we shouldn't fight each one.” He threw the napkin down on the table. “I’ll be damned if I make it easy for them.”
"I'm escorting Frauline Adler to her aunt’s house." Péter quickly explained. "She's just had her ninth child, what a saint, but isn't quite back on her feet. Poor old girl, it’s the dropsy we think. Her father's a friend of my father, Captain Rogers, and when Father learned she'd be coming in on the late train he sent me to make sure she didn't meet with any trouble. I know, lucky me."
Her dark coils and deep brown eyes could have been from her French mother's side, her step father obviously having no hand in her looks. Dvořák had never needed to wonder at some first father the family neither knew or spoke of. They were good Catholics and loyal Germans, but these days the uncertainty was as much damning as any evidence. All over the country people were discovering grandparents and spouses who had converted from Judaism, whom under the Führer’s new laws still counted as Jews.
“Well what would you have me do Tony, pull them from the HJ? They’d take them from me!” Stefen snapped, jerking away from Tony to pace with his hands fisted in frustration. The sudden loss of his touch stung but Tony ignored it as best he could.
Tony thrust the little brown bottle under her nose, and to her credit Pepper didn’t ask what it was, where he’d gotten it, or how he could be sure it had poisoned the captain. No, she took one moment to look at his face and really see the fear as well as the conviction etched there and stepped back – like a gate giving way to the horses on a racetrack.
"There was a mob! They tried to get us when we were at the music hall but Tony made us hide in the cellar." James was recounting rapidly for Bucky, his hands clinging to the man's coat. " I didn't cry though. Well only a little bit but Ian cried too!"
Was he blushing? Tony’s face felt hot, was he blushing? Was he, a fully grown adult flushing like a schoolgirl?  He blinked hard, trying to clear his thoughts.
he urged himself. His own heart was beating strongly in his chest like it was drumming along to the songs in his head.
More towels for one thing and a kettle would go a long way towards keeping water heated. Steam was important for keeping the lungs clear. And medicinal powder was common enough in most households.
Willamina turned with a horrified look on her face as she deposited a long wooden board and a few small jars of spices in his arms.
There were two thin men with gaunt faces sitting in chairs opposite the lonely desk. Despite their peckish looks they both sprang to their feet at first sight of Tony and Clint, crossing themselves and folding trembling hands as they greeted him with such profound reverence Tony almost took a step backward.
Steve watched him cross the room to the bar and pour himself a drink. He’d drank quite a bit during dinner and it showed in his loose posture.
Later when they were having dinner in the Swiss House he teased Tony about it and the monk threw his napkin at him.
Steve stood and left the room, dislodging himself from the company of what was possibly the most irritating man in all of Austria.
The attic space in the old church was ideal for storing men and weapons, as well as sneaking said men in and out, but the downside was there was only one way in and one way out. If it was the gestapo then they’d have to get the drop on them quickly and make a run for it, before they got cornered up here.
As far as nudges went it was gentle, but predictably Ian stiffened, his jaw working as he shifted his eyes away, expression gone mulish.
He wasn't even fooling himself anymore. He'd been celibate too long if something as simple as going for a swim with another man was getting him this worked up.
“He’s gone.” Bruce informed him, gently but forcefully prying his hands away from where they were still holding the dead priest, still pressing down in an effort to keep him still. Bruce was giving him a strange look, full of sadness and pity that Tony didn’t understand.
“No no, don’t bother. He looks busy and it’s not all that pressing. I’d never even heard of it before yesterday.”
“That’s NOT how it works!” Peter’s voice rang out. Maria cringed, covering her face and crumpled into tears.
“That’s because I wasn’t.” Steve reminded him with a small smile. “You’re the high class one remember? I was born on the side of the road.”
“I haven’t seen you since you were in shorts. You’re a man now.” Stanislov exclaimed as he pulled back, watchful eyes traveling up and down Tony’s form, taking him all in. “You look like Hugh. My god, it’s like looking back twenty years ago.”
One of the doctors moved to comply but the chief doctor slapped a hand against his chest to stop him and growled, "No. There are other injured. My staff does not have time to waste on a dying man. "
Bucky didn’t bother to deny it. Instead he slung an arm around Steve’s shoulder and plucked the cigarette from his mouth, tilting his head back to release a slow steady stream of smoke.
Father would still be standing beside the fireplace, taking a deep breath and swallowing it down. Ian couldn’t tell what it was this time that father was trying to suppress. Whether it was sadness or anger or all of it. Ian stared up at him from where he was crammed between James and Maria on the sofa. Though there was plenty of space for them to stretch about around the room, he and his siblings had collected together till they were practically on top of each other. They were all silent as gravestones, waiting to hear what father’s answer would be. Artur was sucking silently on his fingers, his eyes round and glassy with welling tears.
James ran into the room, all lingering traces of gloom instantly forgotten in the face of so many presents. Tony gaped at the disarray of discarded wrappings and boxes filling the room as gift after gift was passed around excited hands and caught Pepper’s eye in disbelief.
He’d been preparing himself to say goodbye all this time… But, what if he didn’t have to? What if whether the Führer was gone or not, Steve just left Europe to her fate. Would that be so wrong?
"I told you I'm not any good!" Da reached out and pushed his shoulder, teasing him gently. "Tell her you like her dress today or something. Tell Gisella, she's good at running.”
“Come on Nik, you and I both know the Führer is never going to bow to pressure from the Vatican. He's going to continue to give you table scraps until he feels he has enough power to tell you exactly where to shove all your pretense at piety. Haven't you heard? He's God's chosen leader. The new religion. He's only biding his time."
She blinked away the threat of tears, rallying herself once more. The staff would have to be sent home, but before then they must settle the children.
Tony began putting away the books that Pepper had provided ignoring the stupefied and lost expressions on the children’s faces (minus James who still looked sullen).
“I am a perfectly respectable size Stefen, and a paragon of masculine virtues I’ll have you know.” Tony huffed, clutching the ridiculous stuffed toy to his chest with one arm and snatching up Sara’s hand with the other. Though there was a smile tugging at Tony’s mouth she took her cue from him and turned up her nose at Steve as if she found the suggestion that Tony was anything but the tallest of men as offensive as he did. They looked like a matched set with their flowers and their teddy bears.
He cringed but didn't have too much time to dwell on how silly that sounded because to his great surprise, Natacha lunged across the room in a few quick strides and threw herself on him. He nearly fell to the floor as her weight settled against him, her arms winding around his neck and squeezing tight as she buried her face against his shoulder with a long violent shudder.
He understood. He nodded again. He understood. Maybe the little ones didn’t' but Ian would help them to understand. It was just like when he was little. Father would go away for months but he’d come back. Mama would smile and laugh and show him the new baby and the house would fill with music.
Before, Tony had lit a candle in the window for each of the children's birthdays whether they were absent or not, and sometimes Steve would catch him leaving bed at night and follow him down to the living room to guard his back while Tony exchanged the stubs for fresh sticks and stared out the window into the dark. It was more punishing somehow, bearing witness to his lover’s grief than feeling his own, but Steve had earned whatever pain he was in. His pain didn’t matter. That was why he had danced with Tony at Christmas. That was why he was here now, forcing himself to ignore the way his skin crawled and his nerves fired with pain in order to resemble something human as he sat with his children.
Tony groaned, squeezed his eyes shut and attempted to burrow deeper under the covers. He’d stayed up most the night before Stefen had woken in the wee hours to relieve him from his watch. He hadn’t thought that Steve would truly be angry if he fell asleep before then but couldn’t bring himself to do it when he remembered the haunted look in Stefen’s eyes. He’d given his word and that was that.
“At the last moment my nephew snatches little Hans up to safety.” Schmidt picked another piece of cheese off the platter turning it over, inspecting it as he murmured almost distractedly. “A little worse for wear but safe from certain death. But to think, little Hans tries so hard. Every time. It’s funny how the minds of rodents' work. Such hope, little Hans has of escaping the claws of fate even as they rake down his back.”
“The police have come?” She asked in a way that said she already knew the answer. Wanda gave a frightened gasp, one small hand flying to her mouth to choke off the sound as if she feared the police might be just around the corner. Tony tried not to think about how possible that was. With each passing moment that was becoming more and more likely.
Warnings in this chapter: reminder for period typical phobias, racism, derogatory speech, and sexism. And an additional warning for period typical uninformed drug use.
Better leave him to it, Tony thought with a smile. Whatever young miss had caught his eye, if she had a decent bone in her body she wouldn't refuse the birthday boy a dance. With Péter accounted for Tony searched the crowd of young people for Natacha, smile diming slightly when he found her standing near a table conversing with a young man whose name Tony couldn't place.
Fear, even when legitimate, had to be controlled or it would control you. Hughard used to tell him that. A weak man is ruled by what he is afraid of, and Tony was not a weak man.
He cradled his drink to his chest; the balmy coolness of the glass had long since faded. He’d regulated himself to just the one glass (no sense in Pepper figuring out who stole the schnapps).
He was a child again looking up past the long blue skirt to the kind oval face of his mother's mother, smiling down at him.
The fog had cleared somewhat from Stefen's features but there was still desire brightening his eyes, giving their blue a sharp edge. For a moment, Tony thought that he might charge across the room, and he couldn't decide if he had it in him to resist. But Stefen made a beeline to the desk instead to open a decanter of liquor and pour himself a drink. Tony watched, noting the almost violent way in which he tossed the liquor down, the muscles in his throat working as he swallowed.
Zimmerman shuffled aside to let the boy, who Steve recognized as the little French one that always seemed to be hanging around special agent Coulson, and a stout older woman who was followed by an equally stout younger woman who bore such a strong resemblance to her she couldn’t only be a daughter.
“You really need to get some rest,” he advised and then with a cheeky grin he added, “You look like you've been hit by a truck.”
Virginia looked toward Stefen with apology and question, unsure what to do in light of the twins discovery now that the staff and Steve's own children had seen them.
“Well he let you leave.” Pavlok pointed out, and then quoted from memory as he tapped the edge of the document, drawing Tony’s eyes to the relevant clause. “Should Antony Stark choose to end his pilgrimage at St. Péter’s Abbey after first reaching twenty-one years of age, a third of the funds are to be gifted to the Abbey and the rest given to Antony Stark.”
“It is clear that some deeper conspiracy is at work here. It must involve some very high-ranking officials in the German Army if the Abwehr are involved and able to move around so freely. It’s too organized not to come from those at the very top. So you’ll give me what I ask or this conversation is done.”
He’d hired a solicitor named Martin Pavlok to look into his affairs without alerting either Stanislov or Farkas to who was behind the inquires, and in addition the man was helping him to track down his mother’s family.
“It’s called a Dusky Blue,” Natacha corrected the younger boy with a click of her tongue as she peered at the pale blue butterfly fluttering within the jar. “And don’t address Herr Stark by his first name. It’s disrespectful.”
Well James was right about one thing. Tony really could hear someone’s stomach growling, though the culprit would just have to remain a mystery. Péter and Ian were both doing their best to look stoic. Tony knew Natacha would never have put up with her body betraying her to James that way, but knew she had to be feeling it too. They would need to find food. He glanced at Stefen out of the corner of his eye, mulling over their options.
Stefen looked toward the boy with alarm crawling all over his face and choked on a swallow of coffee. Tony did not feel at all bad for him, but at least he stifled his snicker. Unlike Bakhuizen.
"Oh, it's not that, though it does rattle to convince one otherwise. It's just that I'm meeting my fIancé in Berlin."
, all it would take was one person to look up – Tony left the engine running and ran to them, nearly slipping in his haste to reach them.
Maybe James wasn’t as silly as they all made him out to be, Peter thought glumly as he watched the streets of the city crawl past his window. Not long till they reached the station now. He still had time to tell Hogan to turn the car around.
When Tony reached the lake (Natacha and Ian running after him) his heart was pounding so fiercely within his chest he feared it would burst. The sight that met him was strange and terrifying. Artur – red face twisted up in rage – was wrestling with his younger sister, scratching at her and attempting to pull her by her hair as he screamed insults at her. Maria was wailing at the top of her lungs, curled into a protective ball as James attempted to pry the younger boy from off her back.
"No. It's not. This is not something I want to discuss right now." Stefen growled, barely sparing the child a glance as he continued to stare hard at Charlotte. She stared right back, jaw clenched stubbornly. Let him be angry if he must be. One of them must do what needed doing.
Tony had lost track of how many hours he’d spent obsessing over the engine and the boats design, losing himself in the project unlike he’d ever lost himself in anything before. He jolted like a spooked cat when he felt a tap on his shoulder – yanked out of the fog of creativity as he whirled around in shock to find Stefen standing behind him, previously locked door cracked open behind him.
He watched the words register on Péter's face, the realization dawning that their practice with the guns was not for the benefit of the HJ, but for whatever was to come. For their family’s survival. Péter's face had drained of color and he shuddered, despite the warmth of the afternoon and Steve put his arm around him.
I was very sorry to hear about the health of your aunt. I don't know much about healing that sort of affliction I'm afraid. Illnesses of the heart are often as delicate as they are deadly. Nevertheless, I will give you everything I have at my disposal to give.  Please send me a detailed list of her symptoms and her any description you can provide as to her usual color when she experiences these episodes of breathlessness. The more detail the better. And as a matter of course, I strongly urge you to consult with her physician before you take on your own methods for care.
Tony blinked at him. Anxious hope mixing with a wave of such fervent relief it felt a bit like crashing. He’d all but given up hope that he’d made any sort of lasting difference here, but those words… those words were everything.
When the food was served, and she and her daughter were escorted out (Steve refrained from jerking Bucky back by the collar when he wouldn’t stop his flirting, but it was only just) he made himself of use and brought rations to the squad on watch.
Tony had started packing the children's things with Pepper's help. They would only have room in the car for a few trunks with all of them packed in, and there was no telling how long they'd be holed up at the cabin until it was safe to move again.
“Yes.” Bucky nodded, not seeing a point in beating around the bush further. “Same as before. Live cargo.”
He seemed to be very deep in thought as he turned toward the window, eyes looking out over the glimmering lake and beyond, to the shadow of the mountains climbing into the sky and Tony waited.
Next to him Natacha took an unsteady breath and Péter glanced at her. Her hand shook as she turned the next page.
"Don't mind Rita. She's only trying to remind you of how important she is to impress your brother,” She explained, smirking at Ian in a way that made him uncomfortable.
After he’d been lined up and scrubbed with long handled brushes that tore at his skin, they’d tossed him and the other men clothes. The number they’d given him in holding had been printed on a steel bracelet and then shackled to his wrist.
Without warning he stepped toward Steve, and a moment later there was a sharp sting against his side followed by a numbing sensation. He was very familiar by know with the feeling of injection. He could only gape at Dvorak in horrified confusion as the other man grabbed him by the shirt collar and began to drag him toward the door.
"Cap, you're back!" Tony exclaimed, surprise quickly giving way to excitement. Wait, why was his voice so muffled? Oh - when Stefen arched his eyebrows, and stared pointedly at the machine Tony was feeding planks through, still throwing off giant sparks, Tony grinned sheepishly and held up one gloved hand in a signal for him to wait. He finished carving the edge of the plank and quickly reached to switch the machine off.  The silence in the workshop without the cutter going was so deep it hurt his throbbing ears.
Tony jolted, hitting his first sour note since he’d begun, surprised by the voice and Nik’s sudden appearance. The Father Superior’s approach had been silent and he was now all but towering over Tony in his black robes, like a crow waiting over some poor beast drawing its last breaths.
The funeral was small, at least in comparison to others Tony had attended. That was another thing that didn’t make sense to Tony’s dazed mind. Jarvis was one of the best people Tony had ever met. There had been more people at the funeral of some Great-Uncle from Italy that Tony hadn’t ever seen outside of his own, bachelor-style apartment in New York than there were at Jarvis’s funeral. Why weren’t there more people mourning? Didn’t everyone know what a brilliant and wonderful man Jarvis had been?
That was all Nurse Rogers said. There was no need for Tony to spill his guts, no need to keep the conversation going at all. He could have left it and gone home.
With cum-stained pants and hardly any energy, they’d stumbled into the living room and ordered pizza at 3 am. They’d shared sticky kisses over the greasy food until Steve had fallen asleep on the couch, one hand clutching a crust and the other stroking over Tony’s back.
, Tony thought bitterly. Bucky had left before Steve and Tony had started dancing together, never mind done anything more risqué, so at least that was one problem that he didn’t have to deal with. Tony lifted one shoulder in a causal shrug and shook his head.
Of course he hadn’t. Tony wet his lips, trying to muster up his usual bravado. “Nothing much to say,” he said, tone falling a little flat. “Sounds like it’s all been decided.”
Sarah nodded, though she knew it wasn’t convincing in the slightest. “That man, Pegs. That man is carrying my grandson.”
Steve jolted at that, his mind moving at a hundred miles an hour. Was it really true that Tony almost didn’t go? Tony had left so easily, coming to see Steve once to tell him that he was leaving and then just walking away without a pause in his step. Nothing had ever really seemed to bother Tony, and normally Steve admired that. That day, though, Steve could have done with some emotion.
Though his tone was light, Tony knew what he meant. It was no secret that Tony was physically weaker and a hell of a lot more human than Steve was and was therefore struggling more with the lack of regular nourishment that came with being held hostage.
Tony had no qualms about handing his book down to the next wave of Starks. His children had grown up in the kitchen working tirelessly next to him to feed their teammates and friends, their siblings and their partners. It was time.
Tony laughed, though it was a little forced. “Just trying to picture it. Never imagined having kids when I was younger, but now it’s time to think about it, I guess. Reckon it’ll be blonde or brunette? I can never remember if hair colours are dominant genes or not – biology sucked at school. I always wanted to blow things up instead.”
“Don’t be,” Tony said, digging his teeth in even harder. The way he was sitting was starting to get uncomfortable and his thighs were burning. He didn’t have experience to test against, of course, but he wasn’t sure that the feeling was entirely what he was meant to have.
The bed creaked as Tony rolled himself onto his stomach, holding his left hand up in front of his face.
The silence that followed that was quite worrying. Just as Steve was about to backtrack and bumble his way out of the situation, Tony cleared his throat. Though his eyes were still on his son, his words were very obviously meant for Steve.
There was a long quiet, nothing in the room but the two of them breathing heavily. They didn’t look away from each other.
“Incoming behind you.” He waited patiently and, once the threat had been eliminated, continued. “You can admit it now, alright? You have to know I don’t care.”
He finally had Steve right where he wanted him, he thought as he slid his hand up to curl over the back of Steve's neck, and he was never going to let him go.
Every replay of the battle sparked the emotion a little more, each repeat of Tony’s actions stoke the flames higher and higher.
“You’re a pest,” Steve said finally, his voice a little strained but his whole posture a lot more relaxed. “I don’t know why I keep you around.”
and had gotten lost in his own world. It was almost jarring to be pulled away from the screen of hot men and back into reality where the PA was screeching and there was noise everywhere.
Peter’s lower lip wobbled dangerously. “So he hasn’t got a mommy or a daddy? Where are they?” He sniffed, whole body bouncing with the movement. “Did they leave him?”
seeing Peter cry. Desperate to stop the tears before they could fall, he squeezed Peter’s hand a few times until the boy looked up at him.
There was a warmth beneath Tony’s lips that meant Steve must have been blushing. The thought of that alone made Tony beam and he ducked his head for just a moment, hiding his grin against Steve’s neck until he composed himself. “Maybe you’ll even be able to see me in them when we get home.”
It should have made Tony’s heart warm, but all it did was remind Tony that he was the reason Jarvis had stayed in a house full of alcohol and screaming and anger. Had put up with the long hours and the constant yelling and the whining, crying child that was just desperate for someone to
crazy stupid fine, turns out they’re both members of the Amateur Astronomers Association. So they’re down at The High Line taking in the celestial sights when she tells Miguel: ‘Yo, I know a guy who knows a guy that got footage of Cap here and this
Tony made a show of holding out his outstretched arm and welcoming Steve into the closet with a dramatic flourish. “Certainly! I’ll refrain from making any jokes about Captain America hiding in the closet as that would be unbecoming of me.”
Maggie Lang grinned when she instantly recognized her special guest. “Wow, you actually made it!” She eyed Steve’s outfit approvingly.
“Nothing that I can’t handle,” Steve replied before muttering under his breath. “Damn wedgies. I’ve always hated this suit.”
“Not officially, no. You’re like our mascot.” Bucky shot Steve an incredulous look, so he relented. “I’d really appreciate the company, alright? I have the feeling it’s gonna be a long day.”
“You need to play too, Captain,” Maggie reminded him gently, prising the paper dinner plate from his hand and shoving him in the direction of the house. “Get to it!”
“Right. Sorry. But anyway, anyway, it’s like this—Miguel, he tells me: ‘Yo, you know how your homie Scotty’s gone and trashed that airport with Captain America and the Tin Man?’”
Steve was tempted to be sarcastic and say no, and ask Thor if he could hand over the packet of dried spaghetti on the shelf above his head, but he managed to contain himself.
Steve stood by the buffet table and watched with mild amusement as utter pandemonium ensued. Children and adults alike ran in every direction to find a hiding spot, bumping into each other, squealing and giggling as Cassie stood in the center of the yard, counting.
Tony smiled like a Cheshire cat and leaned forward to claim his prize, pressing their lips together in a passionate kiss. Letting out a contented sigh, Steve cupped Tony’s face in his hands before running his fingers through his hair, silently chastising himself for running away from Tony in the first place. Well, he wouldn’t be making that same mistake twice. Heck no. This was too good to give up willingly.
Becoming increasingly desperate, Steve considered ripping up the floorboards to create a place to hide. Instead, he ran upstairs two steps at a time and pushed open the first door at the top of the landing. Entering the bathroom, he pulled back the shower curtain to find more guests already hiding in there. One of them even asked for his autograph, but running out of both time and patience, he drew the curtain back without answering and hurried back onto the landing.
Tony nodded in understanding. “I get it. God forbid the symbol of American freedom and liberty also happens to be gay. Or bi. Or are you pan? Whatever, I’m not a big believer in labels.”
Steve drew him a withering look. “If this is what you’re going to be like, I’d rather just get caught now.”
He scanned the back yard for a suitable hiding spot, but quickly realized that his options were limited: Happy was helping some of the shorter children to join him up one of the leafy maple trees while several other kids dashed for the nearby bushes and flowerbeds.
“It makes me glad that I don’t have any,” Steve quipped before adding, on a more serious note, “The world is full of dangers, the likes of which we couldn’t even imagine when I was a kid. Now, we’ve got a whole
“It’s true,” Steve confirmed. “When I was your age, I had asthma, scoliosis, heart palpitations, color blindness...I was even partially deaf. And that’s just for starters.”
Out of options in the backyard, Steve ran inside the house in the hopes of finding a suitable place to hide. Entering the kitchen, he saw a door to the far left and decided to check it out. Pulling it open, he came face-to-face with Thor and perhaps a dozen other children squeezed into a pantry.
“Stark I’d like- that is…” Stefen opened and closed his mouth again, swallowing visibly before he seemed to pluck up his courage. “Tony, I’d like it if you came with us tonight.”
“I’ll say one thing, he’s right bout Czechoslovakia.” Zimmerman commented suddenly and there was a collective groan accompanied by load protests from the others.
His grandad had been teaching him his trade. Steve had expected to earn money making trinkets and instruments and selling them to the gadjie the way that Ian had before the war had come. And there was always his art. After the war when he and Bucky had lived in Leopoldstat Steve had managed to bring in a little income working with a magazine. He and Bucky had made a little extra money here and there using their talents, breaking even between their rent and the money they sent back to their mothers. He could live like that again.
Days ago he’d have traded anything to see Stefen again. He’d been terrified the man was injured, or imprisoned somewhere or worse, and all he’d wanted in the world was the chance to hold him like he’d held him in Berlin.
Bucky could understand pride in one’s heritage, choosing not to hide your difference. He made that choice every day. But there was a huge difference between not hiding and shouting about it and you had to wonder about a guy who needed to shout that loud. Bucky’d been digging around but largely getting nowhere. He’d hoped that with Kirk being a Navy man and spending his youth at the base he might have something of use for him.
Péter recounted this portion of his misadventure with a sort of somber awe, as if he still didn't quite believe himself capable of something like running from policemen and jumping from a moving train. It made Tony shudder to think about.
By Tony’s math it had been 156 hours and 18,000 seconds since he and Bruce had arrived at Engelzell abbey with the rescued monks. Which meant it had been 204 hours and 10800 seconds since Tony had left Stefen and the children for Dachau. Nearly two and a half weeks had gone by since what the local papers had named Crystal Night, and in the aftermath the deportation of Jews in Austria-Germany had resumed in earnest.  In truth, the Germans could not deport them fast enough. Whole towns had rid themselves of their Jewish populations and the Jews who still remained in the larger cities were being transplanted to Ghettos, where they waited until more permanent arrangements could be made.
Ian was at the front, carrying the Wehrmacht's standard. It rested now against a shoulder, heavier then he thought it would be. The black and white Iron Cross emblem nearly dwarfed him as he shifted the heavy pole.
Péter shot his sister an irritated look and she smirked at him. Tony’s heart sank somewhere into his stomach.
It seemed to work because after another long moment and a hard swallow, to Tony’s surprise and the children’s delight Stefen took his seat next to the fire and cleared his throat, nervously beginning the tale.
“You’re very brave, you’re gonna have to be braver still and it's not fair.” Da’s voice scratched and he cleared it before going on. “But I know you can be. You hear me? Everything will be fine.”
The woman pulled on his shoulder, and he looked up at her through bleary eyes as she pushed and tugged at him, until she could reach the cords bound around his legs. She unwound them, and Steve watched within a daze as she wiped the raw skin around his wrists clean and rewrapped the frayed rope around it, apologizing softly every time that he flinched.
Péter looked shaken just the same and Tony released his death grip. He cupped Péter’s cheek with one hand, absurdly resentful of the new sharpness he found there. He couldn’t see it, but Péter Rogers was worth a hundred of Tony.
“I’ve got a boy too and I’m positive Nina got all the brains.” He paused his gaze floating away in memory. “She takes after her mother. Lisbet was smarter than anyone I know.”
Péter vehemently dipped his paint brush in the can at his feet and slashed a bold red X across the large photograph pinned to a post outside a women's dress shop. It depicted a smiling blond woman with her arm slung across a happy looking woman whose dark skin and laughing eyes reminded him painfully of Sam. The caption on the poster declared that the results of such friendships was a loss of racial pride. Péter smeared the words with another slash of his brush and felt a stab of vicious satisfaction as he covered the lie with a warning of his own: RESIST.
(twice over) was unimportant to him, but it didn't shake the feelings of foreboding or the fear surrounding the old teachings. At best Steve’s bewitchment with the monk was bad luck and frankly they needed all the luck they could get.
Stefen fell silent and Tony could see his gaze had gone somewhere distant, and Tony suspected it was back to cold mountain tops. And he knew suddenly, that he didn’t want Stefen to go there anymore, but if there was no preventing it (and Tony sadly thought there wasn’t) he didn’t want him to go it alone.
They were bright and glistening with moisture, wide with the kind of fear a man might feel on top of a wildly bucking horse or in a car that has spun out of control.
They could avert the war. Halt all of Hitler’s atrocious plans. Save thousands upon thousands of lives. He already knew he couldn’t walk away from this anymore than Stefen could and he hated it, so much. Tony snapped his eyes open and lowered his hand with a sigh.
Tony felt out of control, and perhaps it even looked that way with each desperate thrust of his hips, chasing bright burning pleasure as it grew and grew, but it took a herculean amount of control to measure his strength and not to drive too deeply or let his weight fall on Steve. And Steve never flinched. He lay there in trust, letting Tony take as fast or as slow as he wanted. “…
“Weapons, transports for men and information when we need them.” Bucky immediately answered. “Our contacts in London are doing what they can but the English government wants to avoid war at all costs.”
“Steve, if what you’ve got is so damn important did it ever occur to you that the brass isn’t going to wait to see you pass it off to somebody? They’d jump Weiss first chance they got just for the excuse to search his body.”
The captain lowered his hand and surveyed him quietly. Behind him the children rustled in silent anticipation.
He stilled however when he felt Steve's glare, his shoulders hunching. Péter had begun as of late to test Steve, speaking out of turn in ways he’d never been allowed, and sinking into moodiness at the drop of a hat. Even his younger brothers had noticed. Once, one stern look from either of his parents had been enough to make the child behave but now he refused to turn around without a verbal command from Steve.
"Steve, you can’t think it was anything more than a job. Stark seems a decent enough fellow, I'll give him that, and he's not done wrong by the kids. But I'd put money down that he’s long gone before you even make it home.”
His traveling companion, Herr Doctor Fischer, twisted to look at him with brows arched in question. Fischer was one of those men built like trees, legs that went on for years, thick rope like fingers, strong clear-cut features set in an eerily blank face, and blessed with an natural stillness that bordered on unsettling.
"They're gone Captain!" he shouted as he burst through the doors, meeting Captain Arnold and the rest of the men as they crossed the street to answer the sound of the raised alarm.
The sun was already beginning to dip below the horizon when the set off to return to the house. Tony was not very talkative, and so Steve began to think again about the conversation that morning in the garden and realizing that until this morning, he had not known the day of Tony’s birth. He hadn’t paid much attention to his own after Peggy died, and there had been no room to think of celebrating while on the run for their lives. Tony’s birthday had passed in April the same way Steve’s had in July, unremarked and unfussed over while they focused on the children and survival instead. Except, Bucky
It was because he was running from the stones, looking back over his shoulder in fear that Barton was going to pop out of some corner again with a fresh arsenal of stones, that he didn’t see the man coming down the corridor until he’d all but run him over.
She looked up as he entered, her focused frown melting away into a smile as she closed the oven door and wiped her hands on her apron.
And wasn’t that the god awful truth of it. Twelve years old and already she knew too much about the way the world worked. Bucky sighed, heart aching deep in his chest. He’d give just about everything if he could take the shadows from her eyes, remove the weight off of the children’s shoulders and give them the life they so deserved. Free of worry, free of shame.
Flopping back and forth between Tony and Péter in some approximation of swimming, she seemed just fine. Better even than he had ever seen her. All the children were, Tony thought with satisfaction as he cast his gaze around. Except…
"The room is sound proofed.” Tony reminded him, grinning as Stefen's hips bucked involuntarily as he squeezed his hand around his cock and began to stroke. Tony held him in place with one hand while the other continued to stroke. Pressed this close he could watch the way Stefen’s pupils swallowed the blue of his eye as shudder after shudder rolled through his body, pleasure mounting.  He was too beautiful like this, falling apart in Tony’s hands. All that strength held at bay by a single hand upon his hip, letting Tony set the pace however he liked.
“I could be drunker believe me. But you know the funniest thing about it is? It’s not that you’re a poof, it’s that you think I care.”
Bucky kept up a calm façade because there was nothing else to do at this stage. Whether Dvorak had told them the truth or sold them out, they’d be ready for whatever came their way. Bucky took another deep breath, letting the ice in the air fill his lungs and steady his resolve. A flash of movement in the white landscape caught his eye and he stiffened, raising his binoculars and peering through them down at the distant stretch of road peeking through the snow laden trees.
Steve leaned forward, pressing his fingers into his thighs. What did it matter anymore what Péter knew? Péter knew more than Steve had ever wanted him to. No matter how hard he had tried.
Stefen didn’t just want the boys to learn to shoot, he behaved as if he needed them to know. He’d been all ready to drag all seven children out here including little Sara until Tony had put his foot down. So why? What was it all for?
"On my way back. All the rails have been clogged since the riot," he snapped back in reply and Natacha nodded solemnly, as if conceding the point, but her reply was still barbed.
She had no doubt that at heart Captain Rogers was a very passionate man, but she would never apply that word to his regard for her. Their evening at the prince’s welcoming ball was a prime example if ever she’d needed one. He’d spent most of it either holding up the wall or talking about the military with Prince Thor, hardly paying any attention to her at all.
“That is precisely what we hope to do. You see how it is here.” Grig waved a hand out toward the red rooves, just visible over the garden wall. “The law can say what it likes, but the common folk are sympathetic to Jewish struggle. They will look the other way if it means more of our people get to safety.”
The trouble with genius was that it required exercise (a sentiment wholly unappreciated at the monastery he’d had the misfortune of calling home for the last two decades) and the trouble with metal was how blasted heavy it was- especially when one had to cart over fifty pounds of it in a rickety wheelbarrow.
Tony pressed back, hands sinking desperately into the soft strands of Stefen’s hair, unable to help the low helpless moan that shuddered from him, as the unbearable coil of anticipation that had only been coiling tighter and tighter with the wait finally snapped.
did it on purpose, and he always got away with it now because he was little and Tony thought exceptions should be made for the little ones; and father liked listening to Tony. Ian knew, cause he saw how father always watched Tony’s mouth when he was speaking. He’d listen to whatever Tony said no matter what he said.
For the first time in his life, Tony had to articulate to someone besides Stefen what it was like to walk between two worlds, belonging to neither, and he found it more difficult than he could ever have imagined. The Carboni’s were good, and they loved him, he knew that. But it felt like too little too late.
“You startled me.” He ground out, accusing, because she of all the children knew better than to startle him.
The foreboding thought sank any feelings of wonder or excitement Tony had previously felt at the presence of a national icon at the abbey. Captain Rogers for all of his nobility was still a soldier. He was sworn to serve king and country, even if said country had gone to the devil.
“Is Péter home yet?” Steve turned to Natacha who was sitting on Bucky’s other side, pretending to still be reading a book. She closed it gently, lowering it slowly in a way that made him think she was bracing herself.
“Frauline Van Dyne, it is always pleasure.” He kissed her hand with aplomb and smiled at her gratefully as Ursala slowly withdrew, a put-upon scowl darkening her features. “Though it’s a shame we’ve not properly been introduced before this.”
"Frauline Werner is not just here to question whether you are fit to become a group leader in the BDM, she is here to question the loyalty of this house and everyone in it. And where they find fault they will act." He asked slowly, "Do you understand?”
The door rattled again followed swiftly by the sound of it opening and the captain released him. Tony was thankful for the journal in his lap by the time that Bakhuizen appeared out of the entrance hall in last night’s clothing, the picture of a man who’d spent the night getting up to no good and not any better for it.
They left James there and began their patrol. Tony and Péter made a wide circle around the surrounding woods, going out about a mile and circling twice more. They didn’t see so much as another soul. The trail Bucky had driven on the night they’d arrived remained buried in snow, unmarred by anything but a few deer tracks.
Péter clenched his jaw and he might have been the picture of defiance if it weren't for the way his eyes darted back to the window and he squirmed in his seat.
Tony had that look he got, when his mind was already miles ahead and he was just waiting for everyone else to catch up.
“Some of us know how to swim,” Natacha volunteered from her boat and Tony glanced at her, curious. She elaborated with a small shrug. “We used to swim in the summer when our mother was alive.”
And as his eyes flickered to Ian sitting with wide eyes next to his tutor, his eyes round with an all too revealing level of distress, Bucky clenched his hand tightly upon his spoon, thinking that Stark was mistaken if he thought Bucky wouldn't bury another one.
“This is the major’s place. As far as you’re going.”  The dairy man grunted unnecessarily from the end of the truck bed. His lad was already scrambling up to help him begin unloading the heavy crates of fresh milk.
“Of course, Father.” She finally answered with a demure bow of her head, but her spine had gone straight, her shoulders braced as if for war. “It wouldn’t.”
dreaming about.” Tony, who apparently could not bite his damn tongue to save his life, found himself insisting with bite. “I know it’s a vain hope. So do
Their guests kept to themselves and didn't speak much unless prompted. When they did it was in a funny accent, though they spoke German well enough. Anya was weird. She had really big eyes and her thin face made them look even larger. She mostly let her brother do the talking but when she did talk it was to say strange things. The only time she seemed to really open up was during their music lessons, which made sense Péter guessed, if they were going to go on tour with Uncle Bucky.
“Prost” Bucky toasted the man and the barkeep seemed to relax further. Bucky tucked into his plate of warm bread rolls, nearly moaning at the delicious yeasty taste after days of dried meat. While it was true any moment could be his last, he wasn’t dead yet and he’d be damned if he didn’t enjoy his food when he could have it.
The man’s smile didn't reach his eyes as he tapped Steve’s arm with the cool edge of the glass. Steve could feel the coolness seeping through his uniform like a phantom touch.
“They’re perhaps a bit impractical, what with everything, but Willy and the rest of the girls should have something nice. Nice things can be so few and far between.” She fretted, her tone taking on a hint of melancholy that needed no explanation. They all knew that this would be the last good Christmas for a while.
Steve set down the file in his hands rising silently to join Bucky at the window. It was another moment before he spoke.
“It would be a shame, you know, to miss out on such a great meeting of minds. Maybe teach em’ a few things.”
Charlotte was under no impression that the experience would be a pleasant one. No. It was better all-around to slip from the country while her father's name might still be able to buy her way out, and let the public think what they'd like in her absence. The scandal would be horrible, and her parents would have to disavow her, but she liked to believe that even they would rather see her in exile than tortured and imprisoned.
An unspoken conversation seemed to pass between the two for a long moment before she shook her head and politely declined, reaching for the door.
, let go.” Uncle Bucky tried to move and James wailed. No! Don’t let go. Don’t let go. As long as he didn’t let go of Bucky things would be alright.
They were meant to take him away Steve realized. To flee the scene before his rescuers could get to him. Dvorak must have turned on them. They hadn’t been expecting it. Steve wouldn’t have believed it if the evidence wasn’t standing in front of him.
Steve had done a number on Stark in a very short amount of time. Bucky swallowed, pushing down the feeling of constriction rising in his lungs and the voice in his head berating him.
“I’ll shoot you Stefen if you force me to put that child on a boat without you.” Tony responded without a hint of humor, stepping in closer to Steve like he might not wait for Steve to do the claiming. “And that would be a terrible waste, when there are so many other things I’d rather do.”
Ian wriggled where he stood, waiting anxiously as his father began to repair the damage. He wanted to say something. It was on the tip of his tongue to do so, but the words wouldn't come out. They were all stuck like marbles in his mouth. He couldn’t even get past forming them in his head.
. Breathe a word to your pig brother and I’ll kill him, before I kill you.” He let go and the girl bolted, weeping and squealing like a frightened piglet. He spat after her, cursing silently.
Apprehension building, Steve folded his hands behind his back falling into parade, leveling Hasenkamp with a stare. “What more can I help you with Herr Mayor?”
He didn't really expect Stefen to answer. Stefen had that hollow look in his eye again and had sunk into a telling quietness that, while not quite stirring Tony’s worry, had them all glancing his ways more often than not. There seemed to be an unspoken agreement between Bakhuizen and the children that for now, Stefen was not to be engaged. He was like a giant stone that they rippled around without disturbing.
“I stopped Jurgen from ringing for the doctor,” Pepper informed the captain quietly, rising from the floor. Her worried eyes searched the captains as she asked. “Will the police come back?”
“Yes, Herr Stark?” He looked earnest as a beaver, all red hair and blue eyes, and suddenly Tony could see so much of the captain in him that it was curious how quickly he melted.
Tony made to move past him and exit, but it was exactly the wrong move to make. James Bakhuizen was many things but tame was not one of them.
“You must hear this a lot, but you remind me of Captain Adventure.” Bethany’s cheeks pinked with slight embarrassment as Tony inclined his head curiously. “My father is a subscriber. Are you familiar with the magazine?”
Steve was about to reply but at that moment Frau Neumann pushed past them, nearly tripping over Ian who had crouched to examine a stack of folded fabric. The boy immediately stood up, reaching to steady her, an apology leaping off his lips.
Thunder rattled the walls once and the girl shrieked, clamping her hands against the side of her head, and Tony startled; but he rushed to reach her when she flung herself over the side of the bed writhing and kicking like something possessed, screaming intelligibly now in that foreign tongue.
He was woken when the sun was doing its level best to penetrate the silk canopy surrounding the bed and a pair of little fingers decided to test his wakefulness by poking him repeatedly on the cheek.
“Right. You’re well on your way to being prepared for your maiden expedition. You just need to finish learning all the big words in that book of yours and grow at least this high.” Tony raised a hand about eye level.
"I know you don't feel about her the same way you did about Margrit, but she's a good woman. You need a wife Steve."
“I’m fifteen! Not a boy anymore.” Péter insisted, despite Tony’s attempt to derail the fight before it had a chance to begin.
He and Péter set out, pausing briefly to remind James that he could reenter the cabin whenever he chose to apologize to Artur, and to warn him not to try and leave the yard in the meanwhile. James pretended to ignore them, his arms crossed, shivering where he stood nearly ankle deep in snow.
“We’ve not executed or maimed any of the priests serving sentences here. Not since the orders came down.” The warden insisted, frustration lacing his tone.
"What is it?" Captain Arnold barked and the door opened, the police secretary sticking his head in a moment later.
She thought about her father; saw him holding Ian afloat in the water, lifting Artur up onto his shoulders. Saw him walking in the garden with Herr Stark.
Sara Rogers had worn them around her neck every day that Bucky had known her. His own mother had worn similar ones, though hers had been silver. It was tradition in their tribe, and for many Rom, that when a man was to take a bride he took his earthly wealth and flattened the coins to make jewelry, which once given to his bride would let the entire world know she was a married woman. Treasure beyond treasure.
The world had changed, and Charlotte was not a fool. It was no longer safe in Vienna for a woman unattached, especially one who had spent years active in community service and political fundraising as Charlotte had.
“No. Nothing like that. We don’t need to discuss this now. There’s plenty of time to think it over.” She chirped, as if everything were happy and gay between them and they’d merely had a disagreement over whether or not the weather would improve.
It was a shame, he thought, reaching for the washroom cloth and wiping away at the mess of sweat and cum on his skin.
She ignored the boys and girls clamoring for her attention in favor of keeping a close eye on Artur and James, who were always exuberant after spending time in the Little Fellows (or pimpfs as people liked to call them) where boys from ages six to ten got together to play athletic games, learn the principles of good character and sing songs in parade.
A thrill of anticipation went through Tony as he held the small scrap of cardstock in his hands, staring at the solicitors tight and neat little letters as the doors opened up inside his mind. Each one rife with new possibility.
He would stay here in the goat pen until he was strong enough for the journey back to prison, she told him like a stern schoolteacher. But as she continued her futile effort to wipe at the grime that covered him with a portion of her scarf she continued to talk. Nervously Steve slowly realized, breathing shallowly and sinking deeper and deeper into an exhausted stupor as her voice washed over him.
His tone was terse and did the job of cooling off the rest of Tony’s thoughts. Stefen seemed irritated now. Irritation that, Tony guessed, had less to do with his inability to shoot and more to do with his blatant refusal to try. Well, he could just get used to it. If Stefen wasn’t going to be honest than Tony wasn’t going to exert himself. Every action had an equal and opposite reaction.
But Natacha only had eyes for the stack of royal blue jumper’s he’d already completed, her brow burrowing deeply in displeasure as she grabbed the one on the top of the pile and examined it closely.
"We will be back before the evening broadcast, and we could all do to stretch our legs a little more," he said, turning back to the children. Ian slowly sat up, blinking his eyes slowly with new alertness. Natacha and Péter traded hesitant looks. "It will keep your minds off your stomachs.”
It was only because she'd stopped screaming that he heard the warning creak of floorboards before he turned, just in time to catch the handle of the old chimney brush before it could connect with the back of his skull.
love Charlotte the same way he’d loved Margrit. And as fine a woman as Charlotte was, Steve did not want to spend what was left of his life in what would amount to a pretense.
“Look if you can’t relax Stevie, try and take a breath.” Bucky sighed once more. “You’re white as a sheet. You’ll terrify the children. Dottie isn’t going to show up with a tank before we can get there.”
He had later learned that Hughard had intended for Yinsen to take Tony away during the demonstration. He had showed Tony the letter his father had written to an old friend of his at a monastery in Austria, practically begging for him to take in his wayward son and straighten him out. Yinsen had in turn begged Tony to agree to make the journey, to condemn himself for the unforeseeable future to live behind abbey walls if not for his own sake but then for his mother’s memory. Tony had agreed with his ears still ringing with his mother’s last scream.
Back then it had infuriated him, Bruce’s unwillingness to push the experiment further, to do something that could mean the end of countless suffering and pointless deaths. Tony might even have continued on without him if Bruce hadn’t known him so well. He’d locked all of the necessary materials away in his office and slept there to prevent Tony sneaking in- Bruce had Dr. Pym’s letters! Bruce kept all of the supplies for the abbey infirmary in his office and Bruce had Dr. Pym’s notes!
But then again Susann Richter had always been a bit too frank to care about social conventions when it came to friends. He’d always liked that about her.
“Skis have more control, but please, remind me to add sled making to our list of projects. Mark I could use metal rungs. We’ll have to repurpose some.”
“When you prepared your mother’s snack for me the other day.” Stefen easily replied, and he seemed a bit surprised at himself. “Though I might have been too hungry to be cross.”
It felt like he only succeeded in reminding them both of Tony’s glaring absence, cause Natacha just burrowed deeper in his embrace and the ache continued to throb in Steve’s chest. Tony used to declare things like that to make Willamina and the kitchen girls laugh. It felt like a lifetime ago since he’d last seen Tony in the kitchens, flirting outrageously and making a nuisance of himself while he insisted on making Steve’s cup as well as his own.
. Clinton seemed to agree because a moment later he was jerking his head in the direction of the doorway and warning him he’d be late to catch the trolleybus and that the abbot had given him permission to stone him again if he didn’t get a move on.
"Tony's back as well?" Harold asked, sounding like a weight had lifted off his chest. "Good, maybe now your uncle James will agree to get some sleep. He's not left your father’s side since he got back."
They looked happy enough, dressed for the day in warm casual clothes and bright eager smiles. The table was piled high with wrapped packages and piping hot trays of sausage and sweet rolls. The smell of spiced plums wafted from the trays of buchteln and the big pot of mulled wine heating on the stove added cinnamon and oranges to the mix, making the whole room smell heavily of Christmas. Everyone was talking at once as they drank and ate, formality completely dismissed.
“Oh no. Nice try. Not after all that work it took me to get you into bed. I’ll fetch it. Where is it?”
“Captain, we’ve heard many tales of your exploits.” Loki said, giving no hint that he was at all impressed by them. His eyes flickering to Thorson gave away the first hint of emotion that Steve had witnessed in the form of fond amusement. “Thor has subjected us to them almost daily since we left home.”
She hadn’t had time to think of a more dignified hiding spot. She’d heard the doorbell and she’d snuck over to the landing to watch as Herr Hammer invited two strangers inside – one in the same uniform her father wore. Same rank and insignia, but fewer honors.  She heard the other one say he was a doctor and she’d known she wouldn’t have much time to stay ahead of them. She’d dashed into her father’s room, pausing only momentarily to look at him – dwarfed in the large bed, racked with chills and coughing wetly after every painful breath – before slipping into the bathroom.
"You weren't supposed to know." Stefen grumbled and the rebuke was obvious.  As far as apologies went Tony's ignorance was a poor one, in light of the tragedy he could have brought down on all their heads, but Stefen had been the one to open this door, to hide a pair of fugitives in his attic, which only said that he'd already accepted the danger and the possible consequences.
Behind him Artur was shrieking for James to go faster and just like that it was a race with Péter rushing out in front of them followed closely by Ian and Natacha. James followed red faced but determined.
So, with the girls tidily distracted learning valuable life skills, and Pepper and Hammer occupied by the weekly delivery of from town, Tony made his way to Stefen's study his little silver key practically burning a hole in his pocket.
“What the devil is going on?” Tony sputtered, caught between how suddenly glad he felt to see Barton and his shock at seeing him there.
“I insist Captain Rogers. I know you worry but the children are ready for the responsibility. Aren’t you, children?”
Nonna used to kiss him and sigh as she stroked his cheek. She’d always looked so sad as she’d called him her little
The mission. Steve straightened his spine and dragged his head up to count the sleeping bodies within the room. Five. Tony, the only one who might have good reason to be up and wandering about this early was still sleeping to his right, his face a hands width from Steve’s thigh. Natacha was the one missing he realized after accounting for James alone in the bed.
She was standing straight, her expression stiller than water as Frau Zemo passed them in the hall, bidding them both a good evening, the curiosity in her gaze unbanked as her eyes lingered on them far longer than was polite.
“Because the caterpillars give off a scent that confuses the ants.” Péter answered and Tony nodded. He opened his mouth to add something to the boy’s answer but Natacha beat him to it.
It was painfully silent for a long moment before Stefen calmly said, in a low forceful tone that would be nothing but obeyed. "You are my son. And as long as you're that, you'll do as I say. Am I understood?"
When he’d been able to drag himself back indoors he decided that with the boys being occupied it was a good time to open the letter. A good idea. He was going to break something he was afraid, and the children did not need to witness that.
Natacha understood the warning for what it truly meant. Just because her father had been invited, didn’t mean he was liked, or that he was trusted. He was not as careful as he should be, and even so, Natacha did not imagine for a moment that anyone truly believed her father was anything but a true Austrian at heart. He was a son of the soil and a man of the people, and that was what they liked about him. It was also what made him a threat that time would inevitably see dealt with. The Führer already knew what he had in Major Stefen Rogers. More than just a show of his power, his invitation was a chance to observe. He would be looking to see what role Natacha and her siblings would play in his grand design.
He was cut off by Frau Boehringer who flipped a hand out impatiently and said, “She’ll be fine, Captain. We know what we’ve gotten ourselves into.”
"Stop it." Wanda muttered, drawing her knees up to her chin with a shudder. "You're being stupid Pietro. You said we could trust them because they are like us!"
“It’s one of the reasons I hesitated when the Captain asked me to marry him.” She confessed blithely, as if they were discussing an interesting story she’d read in the paper. “I’ve always been one of those jealous creatures at heart. And I’ve never been terribly forgiving.”
“No, when you fucking well tell Charlotte you’ve married a Jew. Yes now!” he bit out in reply, teeth clenching. Bucky waited through the look of dawning realization. Stefen’s jaw tightened but he didn't say a word and Bucky’s heart sank numbly into his stomach.
Still, Charlotte might not have been so decided on the captain as the ideal husband if not for one thing.
Ian was everything Péter wasn't and that Artur was expected to grow into. Healthy, strong, Aaryn looking, intelligent, and a natural born leader. He was what people said the Nazis were when they were painted as brave noble figures in the literature they read and genteel commanding husbands on television (instead of showing them beating old men and skinny boys into the ground just because they could).
Tony grasped ahold of both oars and began to paddle the little boat out into the open water, Bakhuizen following behind them. Stefen kept a close eye on Péter and Natacha in the single boats until he was satisfied they had a good handle on the oars and knew something of what they were about.
Tony froze, fear darting through him, but the woman’s polite smile was unreadable. He simply nodded in acknowledgment and followed the woman out to the front door, because he was polite like that.
She turned her head away, and Tony thought he might have heard her sniff. He knew better than to comment or even look too hard, looking up instead pretending to be riveted by watching the snow fall. She didn’t look back at him for half a block or so, but when she did her eyes were clear.
Tony stiffened at the unexpected insult, a jolt of fear slamming through him. It was hardly the first time in his life when someone had looked at him and thought Pretty Boy, but such associations could be dangerous and he had the feeling that Bakhuizen had chosen the insult very specifically. He couldn’t know anything, Tony reassured himself. He and Stefen had only shared the one kiss and he had to think that Stefen was not such a fool as to go admitting it to anyone. Not even his oldest friend.
“The boys love their boxing. You know how they are,” she replied stiffly. She looked toward the stairs and Tony knew she would try to make her escape even before she turned to make it, tossing dismissively over her shoulder as she hurried away, “I’m very tired. I hope they don’t do another late film for a while. Goodnight- ”
He did not answer her and for Natacha it was answer enough. He had not needed to ask her which grandmother. For some reason, that made Natacha furious again and it was easy to look at him even though she was ashamed of crying.
Steve didn’t know her name. Had she told him and he’d forgotten? Or had she already learned names meant nothing here. Only numbers.  Subject U-1610.
Natacha watched him sleep from the chair she'd picked up off the floor after Tony had knocked it over, her knees curled up close to her chest until she imagined she could feel her heart pounding against her knees. Her eyes burned with unshed tears; but she bit her lip and swallowed back the force she felt rising in her throat - because she had no right to cry.
Tony didn’t need to look at Natacha to feel her disapproval. He could see it reflected in the widening brown pools of Péter’s eyes. It was treason to speak against their fearless new leader and his regime. He couldn’t help a smirk of satisfaction, but it was ruined by the fact that a second later he had to dodge one of Sara’s swinging arms, the child still attempting to find her way back to the ground.
Oh god. Tony barely had time to brace himself before Bucky tossed the boy from the back of the train. He
“You said he hit you?” Steve asked quickly, hoping to distract. It seemed to work as the man began to nod and answered readily.
It was nowhere near as fine a job as he’d done on the door but it would have to do. Throwing open the drawer Tony eagerly leaned over it and began to rifle through its contents. It was clear from the first that Tony had found something of importance, but less clear just what exactly that was.
“Right. Then what did I just say?” Ned asked and Péter’s shoulders slumped. He shrugged, slightly sheepish and Ned heaved a sigh.
“Food should be here soon.” Steve announced, looking up from the message he was writing as the clock upon the otherwise bare white wall chimed the hour of seven. His stomach felt uncomfortably tight, a familiar tension that drove away his appetite despite the fact that it was going on twenty hours since he’d last eaten.
Bucky kind of wanted to box the kids ears but he did his best to stifle the urge. It helped remembering that Péter had been served up his fair share of Stefen’s particular brand of bullshit, and even if
“Péter?” Fire flicked at Steve's throat, but he pushed past the pain to ask again “Péter, ar- are you alright.”
He knew Tony loved the children. It couldn’t be the only reason that Tony was here in his music room arguing instead of saying his goodbyes. Tony hadn’t agreed to go to Berlin for the children! But he wouldn’t budge. He was in Steve’s face now, lashing him with a tired lecture.
That night however Tony fell asleep in Stefen's arms but was woken long before the sun rose. For a moment he could only bolt upright in fright, confused and unsure what had woken him. The room was still dark, but he could see well enough that Stefen had gotten up out of bed. Frowning, Tony reached over to turn on the lamp beside the bed and the amber light spilled over the room, revealing Stefen hovering by the window in his sleep pants. Something was wrong, Tony realized as the sound of raised voices – male, authoritative and unfamiliar - drifted up through the floor.
making them better singers. Cushioning around the larynx produces a more pleasing sound, and it’s nearly impossible to have cushion around the throat without a little padding elsewhere.”
Tony blinked, taken slightly back. From the little that Steve had told him about his childhood in the caravan, it wasn't hard for Tony to fill in the blanks. Steve would have been one of the first, but Bucky would never have let his
She shook her head with a look of gravity that Tony thought had no business on the face of a child and said before turning away, “for Father.”
Steve was a still as marble taking in the words. Bucky watched him take in a small breath before he replied.
“Tony.” That strangled voice in Steve’s ears must have belonged to him, but it was hard to hear over the violent pounding of his heart. Tony just kept kissing him and stroking his cock in rhythm with the movement of their hips and that pressure was building again inside of Steve. The one that begged for either death or release.
“I aint telling Stevie shit.” The taller man’s dark eyes glinted with an odd mix of challenge and mirth as he grinned at Tony, all teeth. “I’ve known that idiot since before he could walk. First word he ever said to me was no, when I stopped him crawling too close to the campfire.”
