And now that he’d returned the damn stones, all Steve could think of was all that he -  that they had lost. And wasn't that something? No matter how far Steve had thought he'd come, it always came back to those people that he had outlived, had left behind.
The silence had grown with every second left unanswered, and Tony felt himself continue to grow warmer under Steve’s gaze.
Steve picked Tony up then, turning around so that he could better lay him on top the bed. He climbed up, fitting himself in between Tony’s legs.
So many impossible things have happened in his life, but it seemed that no matter what, he was doomed to be forever mourning his past.
Despite the warning, Steve’s eyes went wide. The earlier words had him hoping, but to hear them so vividly in the moment for the first time was too novel for him to not be anything but completely stunned.
To say that Tony was shocked, was an understatement. He couldn't believe all of what would happen to him and the rest of the world.
This time it was Tony whose head fell back on the bed as he let out a moan at Steve’s filthy words. He’d forgotten, just how obscene Steve could get when he was really getting into things.
This time Steve wouldn't let so much time get wasted waiting. After everything, he finally truly knew himself and what it is he's fighting for. That there really was no other place he'd rather be than here in this time; the chance for a new beginning with the man who saved them all and gave him a home.
After that, Tony had eased up on actively searching and instead had a system in place to notify him if anyone was selling anything related to Captain America. Money was all he needed when all you had to do was be the highest bidder, but it was another story when the people wanted to keep what they had no matter the price. There were quite a few people that Tony had come across who had preferred to keep their items as memorabilia. Tony himself could understand the sort of sentiment, so he had to concede that he wouldn’t be able to get everything.
Tony was also shy to admit that his admiration of Steve didn’t end there. Tony had always had a crush on Captain America, but somewhere along the way of Tony’s research into Steve Rogers’ life had led the way to honest to god feelings for the man himself. Tony would deny it to his dying breath, but he had completely fallen in love with Steve Rogers; the soldier was everything Tony could ever hope to be, to want.
This reality had already changed, the whole mess with Loki escaping with the tesseract ensured that. So what was there to stop him from changing it a little for the better?
To create an AI peacekeeping program on a global scale required a powerful energy source and extensive amount of coding, capable of handling such high scale information processing. The intelligence matrices had to be as complex as the neurons of a brain. The program required state of the art artificial intelligence and Tony was determined to find a way to create it. Needless to say Tony still had a lot to work on.
"Essentially, yes." Steve said. Desperation and contempt fueled his next words. "Look, I was going over the battle and what I could have done differently so that none of this would have happened and -"
“Okay, wait. I can explain!” Tony started to clamour out. “There is totally a justifiable reason why I have a room filled with your things... I just need to find it.”
They had done it. They had rescued Nat and Tony! And it had all gone down without too much difficulty.
"Why can't we just take the stone from past you, when you come back to return it?" Clint clearly did not understand the need to involve Jane a second time, and Steve who still remembered his last encounter with Jane, found himself shuddering and feeling the same.
"You're not leaving yet are you?" Tony also got up in alarm. "We still haven't come up with a contingency for if or when this Thanos guy comes here."
It was his fault really, Tony hadn’t been to the room in a long while—what was the point when you had the real thing right in front of you? So, when Tony had brought Steve over to the mansion with the intention of showing him around, the collection had completely slipped his mind.
“Oh, well, you can have it all back if you’d like. It’s all your stuff to begin with,” Tony told Steve. He was still a bit mortified at being caught having a room filled with all of Steve’s things, but the man just seemed to be happy to see something familiar for once. Emboldened by the thought, Tony took a step further and added, “Besides, if you move in like I offered, you won’t even have to go through all the hassle of moving everything!”
It’s more than one date. It’s multiple. Their first date (and doesn’t that send a thrill up Tony’s spine), is at an Italian Pizzeria that Steve found when he was busy soul searching or whatever, during his trip across the country. Surprisingly, it’s only a few blocks down from the Tower. Apparently, Steve found it on his way back and now frequently visits it on their days off.
The next person sitting at the table was the person known as the WINTER Soldier. Tony wasn’t sure where he got the name from, but fans mostly just referred to him as WINTER. He was well known amongst the fans for his wicked metal arm. Tony found himself salivating at the thought of getting a chance to take a look at it and improve upon it. It was an intriguing piece of work, and something tony had never seen on any other amputee. WINTER himself was very secretive about both it as well as himself, so not much was known about either the arm or him. He was however, known for being the bass player and musical genius behind the band. He along with Black Widow, who was sitting at the far end of the table, were both the creative forces behind composing the music. Widow herself was also a popular DJ. But in the band she either played electric violin or electric guitar.
Bruce nodded in understanding, and gave a pat on the top of his head for good measure. Steve resisted the urge to check on his hair. He hadn’t really managed to get used to Hulk as Bruce over the years. "Well, there's someone else we'll have to talk to, to see if it's even possible, and they'll probably be able to explain it better than I can."
"Fury, I see that your still making sure that eye of yours sees everything. Oh and speaking of, how's Goose?"
Steve thought he had finally come to learn to accept the loss of the people he had left behind. And really for the most part he had: he now accepted Peggy and the Howling Commandos as a part of his past. The lives they had lived without him were good ones, he had come to realize that and find comfort in it. But, Tony and Nat? God, that was too new. Too fresh... Too much.
Steve was brought out of his inner thoughts, when the door to the meeting room he and the rest of the team were at was opened and in walked Nick Fury and Agent Hill.
"Uh, sometime last week, I think. There's not much information as to why, just a brief statement released about respecting privacy and that they're holding auditions this coming Wednesday.”
But he's back, and he's reported that the stones have been successfully returned, and now there's nothing left. No new world to go explore and get acquainted with, no new recruits to train, no Bucky to find and save now that he was back to his old self; well as much as he could be. But Bucky had Sam now, who for some reason had formed a grudging alliance with his best friend.  And to be honest, Sam was much better equipped to deal with the sort of trauma that Bucky would need help with.
“Shit. You- “ Tony tried to turn away then, clearly misunderstanding. But Steve quickly spoke before he could make any headway.
The last thing Tony remembered was placing his hand atop Pepper's heart as she told him to rest. His head fell to the side and he saw the blurry face of Steve looking at him from afar before his vision faded and he fell into a deep sleep.
So the next time Steve was at Tony’s place - watching some film that they had stopped to watch, after Steve made the mistake of not knowing a specific reference Tony had made - it had slipped out all too easily.
"Steve, I - what?" He spoke, confusion laced his voice. What had happened? Why was he here? Hadn't he died with his final act as Ironman?
It was a good thing that Steve had confronted him in Tony’s room, because he didn’t think he would have had it in him to not just fuck Steve wherever they had happened to be, location be damned.
Steve wasn’t too familiar with the man, but judging from they way he dressed and held himself, he could tell that he was quite the proud character.
"Uhh," had been all that Steve had gotten out. The whole thing had been so over the top that Steve could only think that it was some sort of an elaborate joke.
“God, Tony... I, It’s been so long. I thought...” Steve murmured into his neck, his hold on Tony tightening just a tad as he spoke.
“You were so much more than anything I could have ever imagined. Steve,” He continued as he wiped the tears from his face. “You’ve been through so much your whole life but you never gave up living, and just being in this room helped me remember that.” At those words, Tony finally got the courage to say what was left. He looked up into Steve’s eyes and said, “This room helped me get through so many tough times in my life because at the centre of it all was you. I—I love you Steve.”
“Um, Tony Stark? Can you please head up to the stage to begin your audition?”  said the manager, Phil.
Clint raised a brow and made a face of obvious disbelief, but relented. "Sounds sus but, whatever you say Jolly Green."
Looked like Steve was finally going to give Tony what he wanted. He put their earlier conversation behind him, he didn't want to think of Steve's betrayal right now. Right now he needed -
However, Rhodey finding out wasn’t nearly as bad as the moment when Steve himself walked into the room Tony had dedicated to him.
"He was a good man, and he cared about making sure everyone was safe. I can't speak for your other teammate, I'm sure she too did a lot of good for the world, but going back in time to prevent their deaths will only create further chaos."
"Ya, they aren't particularly looking for a female. Just anyone with a unique or distinctive sound. Apparently they are using this opportunity to reinvent and change up their music."
It was later that night, when they were ready to call it a day, that Steve finally asked the question that Tony was dreading all this while.
Steve grabbed the lube once again, and slathered it onto his dick before crawling over so that he was now lined up right against Tony’s hole.
It was easy tracking the man down, as he often hung out in the same places day in and out. Steve knew that it was the semblance of normalcy Bruce had craved for all these years that drove him to do so.
Steve looked at him completely scandalized. “Tony, this isn’t just any baseball, this is the baseball the Dodgers used when they scored their home run hit back in '41!”
“You sure you all right now Stark? It sounded pretty bad there for a while.” Steve said aloud to Stark where he sat on a stool nursing a scotch.
Steve, moved on to his other nipple then, and his erection which was now half hard, started to slowly grind into him.
Tony could not believe he was about to do this. He should have put up a better fight when Rhodey was trying to convince him.
“Listen here, Rogers, this is a one time thing only. You get to fuck me, and we’re gonna get this outta our system, but don’t you dare think, that this will change anything between us. Now do you want this or not. Only time I’m gonna ask.”
An Elton John song, but Tony had sung the song with such a raw emotion and desperation that Steve almost believed it had been written specifically for him. It was not easy to take an Elton John song and make it sound like your own, but Tony had managed to do it. Steve was impressed. If they had a voice like Tony’s to work with, Steve could almost imagine the new direction they could take their music and lyrics...
“I - what? Tony, I don't -” Steve confusedly let out, but the rest was cut off when Tony’s lips met his.
“I’m also hoping that you’ll also do me the honour of continuing to see you.” Steve ducks his head with the sames sheepish look that he had when he first asked him out.
They stayed like that for a couple minutes. Tony sitting on Steve erection, rocking it into a straining bulge, while Steve hugged him and buried his face in Tony's neck.
"These infinity stones, that's why you came here for the Tesseract and Sceptre." Nat stated, while shooting Future Steve a look for confirmation.
He kissed along it, his rough beard leaving red scrape marks along the sensitive part of Tony’s neck and collarbone.
Pepper was a godsend whom he had met just under a year ago, when he went from unofficial to official head of the R&D department. She was assigned as his Personal Assistant, and although he'd never met her in person, she'd been seeing over all his agendas with S.I. since then. From day one, Pepper never took any of his shit, she treated him the way Rhodey did while still managing to be professional all at the same time. He'd never known anyone quite like Pepper, and his fondness for her seemed to translate both ways. It didn't take long before Pepper had to get in touch with Rhodey due to Tony's bad habits and after, the two had hit it off and now had regular calls to discuss Tony's said habits.
To be honest, Steve had been too shocked and a tad guilty at receiving such an expensive gift to make any sort of conclusion as to why he had received it.
“Just, you know...” Tony shrugged, not really giving an answer. Steve let it go for now, instead he seemed to bring his attention back to the things in the room.
Clint got there first of course, hugging her tight as if to convince himself she was real. Steve could understand, he was barely believing it himself. It had worked! They really had managed to bring Natasha back. They would be able to bring Tony back too.
“Well, because you deserve it.” Tony said. So simply, like it was just a matter of fact that Steve deserved all that Tony had to offer. Like he somehow was worthy of receiving everything that Tony had given him. Like he was worth all that and so much more.
The collection had actually been started by Howard. After his death, there had been two major things that Howard had passed on to Tony. The first being his favour for the bottle, and the second his dedication to Captain America.
Some of the strands from Steve’s slicked back hair fell in his face, and Tony reached out, sliding them back into place. Steve watched him as did so, and Tony looked at him for a beat before turning his head to the side. He couldn’t handle the look Steve was giving him.
"So you don't really have much of a reason to not give it a try, Tony. You might as well audition, the worst that could happen is that you don't get it. Even just auditioning would be great for you. I know how much you miss singing. Besides, you really need to get out for a bit and have some interactions that aren't with machines. Pepper called you know, she's worried you're gonna spend the whole month holed up in your lab."
Tony grabbed Steve’s dick, giving it a few generous pumps - the wet sound obscene to the ears -  that had Steve groaning, before lining it up with his entrance while he gradually lowered himself back onto it. Rolling his hips, he started to build up a rhythm.
His team consisted of himself and Clint, where they had to go back and retrieve the reality Stone from Jane - again. On second thought, Steve did envy Bruce, he clearly had the easier task.
This time Tony sighed. "Ya, I know..." He pouted,  "I just... miss you." He mumbled out. Sometimes it sucked having a best friend that worked for the military. Especially since Rhodey was gifted enough that they wanted him even before his final year of his Master’s. He was happy for his friend's success, he just wished he could see him more—it got lonely without him there.
Howard wasn’t one to get excited easily, so whatever had caught his attention was going to be something to take note of.
“Okay, J.” Tony said with a little panic in his voice. He abruptly swept away the files he had been working on pertaining to Ultron. He wasn't ready to share the idea with anyone else other than Bruce until he was sure that he could get it to work.
“Ironman, 19, and uh... student? That counts as an occupation right?” Tony replied with minimal hesitation.
"Look, there isn't much I can do to help you out here. I've already given you the Sceptre. and you now know about the other infinity stones a lot sooner than we did. Maybe this time around you should all listen to Tony when he says we need to prepare for the threat up there and you might just win without any losses this time around."  Future Steve spoke with a set jaw and a fiercely protective look that made Tony swallow around something strange.
"Easy there fella, I think your crushing bits of me that would prefer remaining uncrushed.” Tony wheezed out. He still wasn’t feeling quite aware, and the crushing hug hadn’t helped matters. Still, the happy enthusiasm on his friends face, brought a sense of familiarity back to him and he felt a slight smile form on his lips.
"But bringing them back here would still affect that timeline and create a divergence." Bruce started with a contemplative look. "However, it may be possible for extraction if it seemed as if there was no extraction in the first place."
He had thought that they would have found something at least remotely unique enough to work with, but so far they had practically gone through the entire list of hopeful lead singers and had nothing to show for it.
“Can’t keep me under you forever Rogers, I’m not that easy.” Using the element of surprise, he flipped Steve over, all the while still staying connected.
Tony’s dick twitched in his pants, the feeling was incredible and the thought of Steve in his roughed up state being the one causing it, was sending all sorts of weird fucked up feelings straight to his dick.
The words struck Steve, he couldn't speak for the rest of the world like Bruce, but he could speak for himself, and he could say without a shadow of doubt, that he definitely was not ready for a world without Tony Stark.
It was hard. Seeing Nat there, Bruce had to look away. Clint just stared, stone faced. Steve could feel the burn of his eyes, and turned to look at Strange. Strange looked back, a flash of understanding appeared across his face.
"Okay first of all, I know for a fact that you're supposed to be handing in your tech designs today for S.I., because you've been complaining about it non-stop for a week now. And second of all, we both know that school's not really the issue here, you could do the course work in your sleep."
Steve shifted then, the angle changing just enough that Steve’s movements now caused a repeated onslaught against his prostate.
"That poor lady," Clint said, just as they had arrived at Vormir, "I am not looking forward to putting that Stone back into her."
Ever so slowly, his vision started to clear.  Once he blinked back the tears that had formed upon the onslaught of bright light, he was shocked to see that the figure had been Strange. Why would he be seeing the sorcerer now?
“I’m sorry, but I’ve had Loki in my mind for the better half of this whole damn thing, so I’m gonna need a little more than this guy being able to control some special hammer.”
Not a day went by where Steve didn’t think about their broken relationship. Maybe Tony would have still been around and not living in the middle of the woods, if he had gathered the courage to just go and talk to him.
Steve was ready to call the whole thing a bust, gather up his shredded dignity, and try approaching Sharon to give them another go-when Steve noticed that the final auditionee had yet to approach the stage despite his name being announced. He turned to take a look around the now sparsely occupied room, only to find dark amber eyes staring directly at him.
Tony looked down at Steve, taking in the long strands of his blond hair in complete disarray, and fuck, his thick beard which made him look like a wild man that Tony was taming.
It had been weeks since they had left. Apparently they had stayed a while to scout other solutions, but returned when they found that nothing could really be done. Without the stones, they had no way of bringing anyone back.
Steve sighed in relief, it was a long shot when the thought had initially occurred to him: he didn’t actually know if it was possible to bring them back. But if Bruce thought that it was then that opened a realm of possibilities.  "Well, since we can't change the past, why can't we just bring them here to our present?"
Tony was still furious at Steve. Which completely justified why he currently had him pushed up against the wall, while he desperately kissed him.
The fact wasn’t lost on him that they would be defeated by the very same army Tony had just seen, when he had done the sacrificial play by going through the wormhole. And wasn't that the kicker! Apparently he had developed a taste for being the one to make the sacrifice play.
Nat was someone who had been with Steve during his toughest times. She was right there with him after Ultron, even when everyone else had left. She was the one who knew him best when it came to the toughest calls; how he would never back down once he had made up his mind.
Bruce finally spoke up then, "Were a little in over our heads here Cap, so frankly a bit of help would be appreciated." His face betrayed the nerves he was clearly feeling at the thought of figuring it out themselves.
“Fuck, Steve, just fuck me already, I’m ready.” Tony finally said, having reached his limit ages ago. He needed to be fucked by this man already.
So it was quite surprising when he felt himself slowly come back to awareness, as if rousing from many nights of slumber.
"He must have suspended the reality around Vision at a singular point, and then altered the time only within Vision's body." Bruce had excitedly cut in, seeming to now grasp what Steve had only just begun to understand.
The extantant looks from everyone's faces, especially Thor's (the man could rival a golden retriever for god's sake) must have weighed him down, cause after a moment, he too agreed that Future Steve should stay a while. Or at least until they had more of a solid plan figured out.
He rubbed his cock along the path of Tony’s parted cheeks, his dick catching a few times at the hole, but never quite going in. “Maybe I should rub one off like this, covering your ass in my come until your nice and wet, and then sticking it in you as you get me hard again.”
“Y-yeah.” Tony croaked out, He tried to build up his nerve to break the news to Steve, but it was extremely difficult when you were being cuddled by the man you love. Especially when he had clearly just come out from the shower— probably to wash away the sweat from the workout he just did, and didn’t that give Tony a whole new set of images— smelling like a fresh breeze and something so distinctly Steve.
Steve couldn't fathom why he was still in 2012. He still had to return the Tesseract, and yet he was idling away his time here instead of doing his job.
Suddenly, he felt so overwhelmed by everything that was occurring. He felt a creeping sense of panic building up upon him. Please no, he didn't need this right now. He needed, he needed -
Once he was satisfied with his collection and done what he could, Tony had a whole room to house it. He still had J.A.R.V.I.S. notify him if anything new popped up, but for the most part he was pretty content with everything he had obtained.
The words however, snapped Tony back into the present, and reminded him, that this was still Steve... the man who had fucked off and left him alone for three years.
“Ooh, who’s Goose I gotta know if it can manage to make Mr. Eyepatch here thunderstruck.” Tony perked up.
The point was, that despite the battle they had just won, Tony was well aware they would still have to face a greater foe from up there. It was disappointing to learn that he had been unable to prepare for it regardless.
Steve had propped himself up on his elbows then, eyes straight on Tony, a look with unsaid emotions running between them.
Tony didn’t finish his statement, because he went right back to kissing Steve again, as if he couldn’t bare to spend too long without kissing the man. Fingers tangled themselves into Steve’s longer slicked back strands, and Tony moaned at the feeling of running his hands through them.
The answer, did nothing to stem away his confusion, and Steve must have realized this, as he hastily stepped forward, he rushed out another response. "Gosh, Tony, I - this must be all so confusing to you. I promise, I'll explain everything when we get back home."
As Steve and Tony began to hang out more often, Tony gradually began to spend a significant amount of time at Steve and Bucky’s place as well. And since he loved spending time there - “there’s so many things to fix Steve!” Tony would often say in explanation whenever Steve asked him why he liked his shitty apartment so much - Tony also spent a lot on making sure the place was properly stocked.
It was only when Steve had walked towards the room and started opening the door that Tony had realized.
“Uh did this guy just say his name is Ironman? Like that’s his actual name?” Clint exclaimed, up from his spot at the end.
Which is precisely why he'd been avoiding Pepper lately. He knew she more than Rhodey would be on his case about getting out and making friends, and he did not want to bother with any of it.
Clint was already sitting at the helm, getting the jet booted up and the others were dispersed throughout.
Steve looked up at him then, with sad eyes, and Tony gritted his teeth so that he didn’t fall for any of his old charms and give in. After a moments hesitation though, Steve seemed to come to a decision, and gave Tony a quick nod.
“Still going commando, huh.” Tony said more to himself then to Steve, but Steve still responded by saying, “Guess, old habits die hard.”
Clearly he needed to get his head checked, cause there was no way that Steven Rogers, Captain America himself, was asking him out on a-
Steve was bored. His day had started out well enough, what with his morning routine of an early jog and some quality time at his favourite cafe getting a couple of sketches completed. But it had all gone down hill when he had sat down at a long table with his fellow band members to listen to a series of dull and unoriginal auditions. The auditions themselves weren’t bad per se, just lacking that unique flavour of sound that he was looking for.
One of his hands gripped Steve’s cock, while the other made quick work of his pants, pushing them down once he had them opened. He grabbed the lube that he had gotten earlier, and hastily got his fingers slicked, reaching around to open himself up.
One of his fingers drew a lazy circle around his entrance, causing Tony to bite the lobe of his ear in impatience. “Anytime this century, old man.”
On the way back, they decide to take a short stroll through the park before calling it a night. Despite it being dark, they both enjoy the midnight stroll. It’s as they are walking, simply basking in each other’s company, that Tony feels Steve’s hand brush against his. He holds his breath and lets it out slowly when Steve slowly entwines’ their hands. They both don’t say anything for a while. Tony’s heart beating a mile a minute while Steve holds his hand as they walk through the parks path. Finally, Steve speaks.
"Hey Honey Bear, you miss me already?' Tony exclaimed with a false cheeriness to his voice. There was also a hint of betrayal unnoticeable to most, but Rhodey unfortunately was not most.
He blinked his eyes, and put a hand up to block the light. Through his fingers he saw a black figure standing before him.
“Wow okay, so you can control Thor’s Hammer, that’s pretty impressive there Houdini, but how does that prove we should trust you.” Stark walks up from behind them and Steve- Future Steve’s whole body visibly tensed before going slack.
"Well only the sceptre really, your Loki actually did escape with the Tesseract. So Tony and I-" And damn if the way Future Steve said his name didn't speak to level of closeness they had clearly managed to achieve. "-had to go back to the 1970s to get the Tesseract there."
It wasn't fair. That he was still here and those that had only just started to live their lives, wouldn't even be able to live them to their fullest.
“There’s been an attack at the Fantastic Four Compound by a small army of doom bots.” Natasha informed them. “The Four are holding out for now, but the bot numbers are increasing at an alarming rate so they’ve requested back up.”
I hope this is what people were looking for in the sequel. I'm think of continuing for a couple more chapters. Here is a sneak peak for Chapter 3. Also I'm open to requests. If anyone wants this fic to include something, mention it in the comments and I might be able to work it in (I'm pretty open to ideas or desires). As my first fic I'm using this whole thing as a learning process and I would love the challenge and engagement of the readers.
When the silence started to reach an unbearable length, Tony knew he had to say something. Gathering up courage he tried to speak, “Steve, I—I...” His throat felt dry, and he couldn’t seem to get the words out, but Steve deserved an answer, so he wet his lips, looked Steve in the eyes, and tried again. “It started off as just something to do, you know, another thing to pick up that my father abandoned—it didn’t hurt that I was a huge fan either. But, the thing is...the more I collected, the more I learned and... the more...invested I became. With every item I added, the more I learned about you, and it was just...You—” Tony felt his voice crack. He was mortified when he realized he was crying.
"Tony," Rhodey sighed. "I'm only going to be gone for a month. It's the standard amount of time served, plus you know I already turned them down on their early offer, so I'll be back for start of semester."
Tony avoided Natasha’s eyes, which got a lifted eyebrow. Steve chose to ignore the smart comments and instead asked about the situation at hand.
His first meeting with Tony hadn't gone at all how he had expected. For one thing, he hadn't at all expected someone so young. The cash alone was a significant amount and it might have been a little naive on Steve's part, but from where he came people that young didn't have cash like that. And they most certainly didn't use it to commission nude portraits of themselves.
"I, Nat - what? You're -" Was all that Tony managed to get out, as he focused on Nat. She was here and alive, and he just couldn't think straight.
So ya, dating, not something Tony excelled at, and frankly, not something most people wanted from him anyway. Which was fine, because if he had the option he wouldn’t want to date himself either. So you can see how it came as a huge shock when Captain America asked him out.
Strange however,  still seemed to need more convincing, so Bruce had tried a different approach. "Strange, I know you don't know us very well, but you did fight Thanos up there with Tony. Surely you must have seen the type of man he was. The world's not ready to be without Tony Stark."
"Is this one of those gotcha film things that have been going around the internet?" Steve had said. He had remembered Bucky talking about a recent online trend where people filmed ordinary folks walking into the most absurd orchestrated scenarios, for some kicks.
The assembled team before Steve had all turned to look at him then, giving him looks that varied from confusion and empathy to snarky amusement. The later had come from Clint, who Bruce had contacted earlier when they received confirmation of the plan. Clint, upon hearing that they had come across a chance to save Nat, had immediately dropped everything and showed up a half hour later at the compound insisting that he was to be going along with them.
“What? Are you sure?” Steve was suddenly filled with a strange emotion. He’d just gotten to know this amazing man. He couldn’t be leaving again so soon, could he?
“Can you believe they’re not together? It’s horrible!” Tony rubbed his beard, exaggerating a thinking pose. “But I hope they figure it out soon. You think we made things worse?”
“He said he was sorry for trying to hurt Bucky, said he knew it wasn’t his fault, but he couldn’t control himself in the moment. He asked Bucky for forgiveness, and it seems like they're okay now. He helped Shuri - the scientist from Wakanda - fix Bucky’s mind and his arm. He even invited us all to come live in the tower. Said it would be good for the team. But, still. Every time I try to talk to him alone, he finds an excuse to leave, or avoids me altogether. We were such good friends before all this.” Steve said.
"Giant dwarfs?" Clint scoffed. "Ooookay. I want to be the first one there, though. You gotta send me first. I've always wanted to use a bulldozer! Please tell me there's something to wreck!"
“Hey, don’t do that.” Steve patted him on the head. “If you get too tense, you’ll hurt your back. Come on.” He rubbed Tony’s neck right in the perfect spot, making Tony’s spine shiver.
“Heh. Yeah.” Tony chuckled. “So. Rogers. How do I...woo you?” He asked, twirling a finger in the air for dramatic effect. It made Steve laugh again, which was a win in his book.
"Yeah." Steve could definitely be that for Tony. He thought for a second, and grinned mischievously. "Guess what? I started a list."
Tony feels the last of his inhibitions fade away as he drifts into sleep, safe and secure in Steve’s arms.
Steve stares unseeing at the beverage in his hands, mulling over any hints he might've missed. Things his superiors have said or done to clue him in.
. He cups Steve’s face, kissing him fiercely, pushing into the kiss all his insurmountable feelings for him.
Steve chuckles. The common area has been renovated no less than six times. Once after the invasion, once after a particularly vicious prank war they all had part in, and the other four times due to a Hulk out incident. He chuckles again when he remembers the guacamole disaster of 2012, when arguably everyone had been a green monster.
"You live here by yourself?" Steve asks incredulously, and looks around at the bare decor. There's nothing personal, nothing
He has no idea what to make of it. The energy spike unnerves him, but someone needs to deal with it, and fast.
“I’m sitting on a legacy of blood and destruction - the public agrees, someone called us ‘merchants of death’ on twitter recently. Got a nice ring to it. Point is, Paul, you’re gonna have to do better than to try and guilt trip me.”
Every attempt there's something that screws it up. A pigeon craps on the handwritten letter James -- disguised as a waiter -- shoved under Steve's plate; the Avengers alarm goes off when they're at the movies where James changed the scifi action flick into a romcom.
It all feels awfully real, but pretending he could wake up from this gives James the ability to say out loud all the things he feels about the other two, and the smiles and blushes he gets in return are the best thing since mounted scopes.
“Uh, hey how about you guys talk about this later-” Sam tried to intervene, but Steve wanted an answer right now. He held up a hand to Sam and asked again.
Steve nodded, catching his breath as if he'd just run a marathon for fun in the time they were apart. He pulled himself together and stood up straight, his hands forming fists at his side, knuckles white with tension.
Tony momentarily forgot - he forgot why he was mad, forgot that he wasn’t good enough, forgot that he must’ve looked like hell right now. All he knew was Steve’s worried eyes looking right through him. He found himself inching closer. It looked like - maybe - Steve was leaning in too. Even through his tears, he could see those ocean blue orbs moving towards him, could feel the strong, sturdy arms engulfing him, could hear the increasingly annoying alarms overhead.
"T-thats great!" Shit. Steve was NOT ready for this. He held Tony by the waist and gingerly set him back down, he couldn't risk having Tony feel a hard-on from him right when he had gotten such wonderful news.
All too quickly, they were descending on the park field. When the cargo doors opened, he could see the cheering crowd outside, the stage overlooking the Potomac. He wondered who’d set this all up. Probably Tony’s people. He should have helped.
“Is there an emergency?” Steve tried to muster up some sense of composure. His eyes were finally coming into focus. He could see the dark haired man now, making himself comfortable in
side.” Tony said. “Natasha turned on me, Vision left to follow the little witch, and the rest decided that it would be better to take their chances with extradition than to trust me with the Accords.”
As he stepped off the elevator into a dimly lit but huge space, he realized he'd never been down here before. There was a huge glass separation right at the entrance, from floor to ceiling. It seemed Jarvis knew he was there, as the keypad on the door beeped from a red to a green light, so Steve was able to open it and walk right in. When he did, he was hit with a smell that reminded him vividly of Erskine's lab. It smelled of oil, metal and a hint of smoke. Tensing up, Steve thought for a moment that it might trigger him into a panic attack, but as he kept looking around and slowly breathed in the air, he was surprised to find that it actually...kind of relaxed him?
"Ha Ha!! Stop Tony!" His sadness washed over him. He would make the most of it, the time he had left with his friend. If he only had one night with Tony, he certainly didn't want to share it with anyone else. He'd had more than enough company of strangers over the last several weeks. "No dancers, no massages. Let's just hang out together tonight, if that's okay."
“Believe me, he’d rather know.” Tony smiled as he pulled Steve’s hands down. He gave Steve a sympathetic look, rubbing his arm with one hand, and placing the other on his chest - right over his heart. It grounded him, and brought Steve back from a near anxiety attack. He breathed, slowly, in and out, until he felt a little better. “That’s it. In and out, baby. There you go. Good job. Come on, you’ll feel better after I do some math.” Tony pulled him into the elevator and Steve let his shoulders relax as the man held on to him, continuing to provide some comfort. This Tony was a nice guy, at least.
“I want you too. I've wanted you longer than I can remember. But...I’m not like him, Steve. I don’t know what Other-Tony said when he was here to make you suddenly like me in that way, but-”
“Oh, right.” Tony got a worried look on his face. Steve was thankful that he had a better idea of Tony’s insecurities after their talk, and he was able to guess the problem right away.
Steve woke up late and feeling groggy. He still had a few loose ends to finish up at SHIELD so he started his day by going into the office. He forced on his best (fake) smile and chatted with the few SHIELD staff he ran into, and they all wished him safe travels on his way out. He stopped at a small bistro, grabbing a late lunch. Everyone inside seemed to be in a great mood, strangers chatting and laughing, and the food was fresh and probably delicious, though he wouldn't know, as he didn't really focus on the taste much while eating it. On his way back to the tower, he picked up a couple things for his trip, some toiletries and a small sketch pad and pencils. The employee at the store was kind and helpful, suggesting specific items and waving him off with a warm "have a great day!" as he left. It should have been a nice, leisurely day - one that usually would have left Steve feeling content, happy even. Instead, it felt like he was just moving on autopilot. He wasn't really registering what he was doing, mostly it felt like he was just waiting for the time when he would be tired enough to be able to go back to sleep.
He held the notebook up to the lab lights for a clearer view, pondering over what message Other-Tony was trying to convey to him, when he heard a voice behind him.
"Sorry, we probably should have talked about it first." He zipped himself up and stood, slapping away Tony's hand when he reached for help getting up, opting to pick up the man instead, bridal style. Tony squealed in delight, throwing his hands around Steve's neck.
Another pop and bang. He lost his thoughts and sunk down to the floor, shielding his face. He tried to take deep breaths, but they were ragged and he couldn't stop shaking long enough to really focus his eyes on anything. His heart was racing, and he was burning up. Why was this happening? Was he in danger? He didn't know, but his body felt like it was. He couldn't move. Where was his fight or flight instinct?
Steve showed up at Natasha and Clint's floor with two big to-go coffees from the downstairs cafe. The couch seemed to be missing several pillows, but he sat down anyways and waited for her to come out of her bedroom. After a few minutes, he heard shuffling footsteps.
They were apparently going to stay on an entire floor of this hotel. Steve's shock must have been clear on his face, as Tony grinned at him, clearly amused.
Shortly after he left, the road came to a complete standstill. He was getting more than a little frustrated, and it didn't help when Jarvis spoke up.
Tony turned back and walked through the portal. This universe was just too much for his weak heart to handle.
"No," Steve pulled up some swim trunks with a Captain America shield plastered on the crotch. "We'll pick each other's swim trunks to hang out in the room's hot tub until lunch!"
Now, it was seeping into his subconscious. This dream - God, that had never happened to him before. And he couldn't forget the feeling of waking up wrapped up in Tony's scent, his warmth, holding the smaller man, looking so precious tucked against his chest. How could he go on now, knowing how amazing that felt? Tony was so easy to lov- like! Like! God, Rogers, get a grip. How did you fall so hard, so fast?
with every breath. Steve really needed to get back in the game, so he raised his hand up and firmly slapped Tony’s ass.
This wasn't a battlefield. He was in a room. What was this room? Had he been here before? He heard another faraway pop and bang, and saw colorful lights scattered on the wall. Swinging around to the window, he caught the last of the lights fading in the sky through the blinds. Fuck. Fireworks.
Steve grabbed Tony's thigh with one hand to keep himself steady as he fumbled with his belt with the other hand. He alternated between focusing on trying to pull on his zipper, and taking Tony's leaking cock back down his throat over and over, pushing closer again every time he pulled back a little too far between undoing his own pants. Finally, his dick sprung free, and he rubbed himself, his throaty moan vibrating through Tony.
“I’ll get you back for that, Stark.” He growled out as Tony slid his cock deep down his throat. Tony just hummed in agreement, making Steve clutch his hair harder. He wasn’t pulling his punches now, he bobbed his head up and down, setting a brutal pace.
"Yeah." Tony sighed. "If they don't vote in favor of this...I don't know. I'll just have to find some other way. Pep and I worked too hard on this to just watch it fail."
You could hear a pin drop. Steve uncrossed his arms and stood at parade rest, puffing out his chest, the American flag pin on his lapel catching in the light.
"No way. We're staying put. I don't need a whole new wardrobe." Steve argued, "Tell Tony that if he wants to pay, he'll have to be okay with the stores at this mall." He thought about it for a second, "Or else....I'll wear the dark pants for a week straight at the tower." He crossed his arms and huffed triumphantly.
“Fine.” Tony yawned as he took the hand, and let Steve pull him up. “Help me calibrate the electron beam, then.”
Sam and Bucky looked at him expectantly. When no one said a word, Steve groaned and buried his face in his hands. He was going to have to recount this whole story, which was a lot harder than he thought it would be.
Tony nervously tapped his fingers against the elevator walls. Maybe if he went back over there, to the Mirror dimension, just for a quick visit, he could convince Other-Steve to tell him how it happened, how Other-Tony got Steve to admit to liking him so quickly. They were married there, right? So surely they talked about these kinds of things. If it was all a big misunderstanding, like Steve claimed it was, then he just needed to find that
"Only because YOU talked them into it. I owe you big time." Tony handed him a cup of hot coffee, and picked up a knife. He was using his blue paring knife! He was cutting up an orange, finishing up what looked like a fruit salad.
Steve laughed, and hopped on his bike, strapping on his helmet as he kicked his bike to life. "See you soon, Stark."
men. Steve realized he had no clue. After being with Other-Tony, he’d just assumed...but maybe he’d been wrong. Maybe he just couldn’t have Tony in this universe after all. He’d have to learn to live with that, even with the knowledge of how happy they were somewhere else, in another time and space. It would be painful, to live a life with someone you love, knowing they don't love you back, but it’s what he deserved. Tony should be with someone better than him, smarter, who wouldn’t lie, who wouldn’t make mistakes, who’d always put Tony first.
“I’m sorry I took up all your time, Tony.” Steve apologized. “I’m sure you would’ve rather spent the morning doing some experiments around here.”
“Ew, no.” Tony scrunched up his face. “I thought I said dark golds and blues only. Lets go talk to her. Who even uses wallpaper anymore?”
He turned to look at Tony, deciding to end this torment once and for all. He started marching right over to the other man. Tony must have noticed, because he handed Rhodes his bottle of water, resolutely matching Steve's stride towards him.
"What?" Tony made a face like he'd been slapped. "Y-yes. Of course. That's... I'm glad you...I mean- it's more than okay. Yeah-uh... That's good."
“Don’t worry, you’re doing great. I know you’re just tired, baby. Let me just…” Tony balanced one hand on Steve’s shoulder as he shifted his weight back to his knees, and then sunk down on Steve’s hand, moaning the whole way down.
"That sounds like a lot of money you'd be spending, when you could just have your friends help you." Steve cocked his head to one side.
With every bite they shared, Steve was coming closer and closer to a startling realization. Once they had sampled everything on the other's plates, he knew. They were flirting! This was flirting! Right? He wasn't completely sure, because Tony wasn't freaking out, the building wasn't on fire, and the world wasn't coming to an end like he thought would happen.
"Sir?" Jarvis spoke, "I just thought you'd like to know that all of Captain Roger's passwords have been updated and saved. He would like for me to relay a thank you once again for your assistance."
Steve took both of Tony’s hands, turning him so they were face to face, so he could look him in the eyes. “You’re right. We’re nothing like you Tony. And I mean that in the best way possible. We might look perfect from the outside, but that’s because we hide our flaws. We hide them to a fault. I get so nervous about hard truths, Tony - so scared that I hide them, I become a liar in the hopes of sparing myself and others the pain.
“I’m gonna…” He tugged on Tony’s head, asking him to come off, but Tony squeezed his hands under Steve’s thighs and clutched at his ass, pulling him deeper with his grip.
After they pulled apart, Tony was grateful that Steve didn't look back while he rode off. With moist eyes, Tony clutched the reactor in his chest tightly. Maybe Steve won't forget about him after all.
universe.” Tony explained, scooting a little further from Steve. “He’ll be back in a couple of hours. We can’t occupy the same universe at the same time, it would break the law of conservation of mass. So I switched us out for a bit while I gather some data.”
"What exactly happened? The day you moved in?" Tony asked frantically. Steve thought back, trying to remember anything of significance. It seemed like a normal day.
Or maybe the limbic cortex in his brain was fried and permanently dysfunctional from seeing Steve in those practically painted on, absolutely delicious looking pants. Tony had tried to keep his eyes to himself, but that ass was just screaming to be worshiped. He normally detested department stores, but decided right then that he'd buy out all the JCPenney's in the state if it meant Steve would wear
"Not if he were extremely heavy. That's why I don't know what kind of protein structure his muscles are made of." Bruce explained.
They kept that up for the rest of the movie, giggling to themselves, sharing cooking videos, then memes, eventually just ignoring the TV altogether in favor of their own separate conversation. Apparently, they lost track of time.
"I'm sorry I...I'm not upset with you. I promise. Look, I just came down here to tell you that my...my things are packed Tony. I’m leaving for the compound. I’m so sorry for hurting you. But I’m
"Can you blame him? He was your best friend for a while, there. How could he tell you something like that?"
Steve thought back, a week seemed like the blink of an eye now. After the battle, while they were eating shawarma, silently watching the shop owners casually sweep up broken glass, Steve had felt utterly hopeless. He thought, at the time, that it would take months, if not years to put Manhattan back together again. But helping the cleaning crews these past few days opened his eyes to just how much had changed in a good way.
They were in the common lounge, waiting on the rest of the team to arrive. Steve had texted them all, giving them the day off, insisting on a movie day. They quickly agreed - and who
"Perfect. You're going to just move as if you were fighting." Tony threw a big piece of scrap metal at him, which he caught. "That can be your makeshift shield for now. Doesn't need to be any specific moves, I just need to get a scan of your range of motion so I know where the fabric needs reinforcing."
“Are you just going to sit there and watch me?” He asked, irritated. It was uncomfortable having all of Steve’s undivided attention like this, especially when he couldn't do anything about it.
Thank you all so much for all your kind comments and kudos that kept me going! If there wasn't a whole pandemic going on, and if this wasn't the internet, I would find each and every one of you and ask for permission to accept a hug from me!
"Alright." Steve relented, "I suppose we're good then." He looked around, noticing how nicely decorated the room was, just like the rest of his apartment, with his own things blending in seamlessly with the new furniture. This bedroom alone seemed to be almost as big as the entire apartment where SHIELD had put him up. "Wow, it looks like all my stuff is already here."
It must've taken too long for Tony to do or say something, because soon enough Steve let out a whine, one heavy arm pulling Tony close to his side. Tony was pleasantly surprised, he didn’t think Steve would want cuddles after, but he took the opportunity to burrow himself into Steve’s arms. He looked up, and found Steve already staring back at him.
When they got back to the tower, Steve thanked them again, then made a bee-line straight for his room. He wanted to relax after spending all day in the hustle and bustle of crowds. When he got to his apartment, he found all his new clothes already hung up for him. Disappointed that he wouldn't have the mindless task of arranging his closet to preoccupy himself with, he walked back to his bed and laid back. It wasn't late enough for bed, but he didn't really have anything else to do that day. He asked Jarvis to let him know when Tony was back from work, so he could thank him for the clothes. Minutes passed. Sighing, Steve looked around the still unfamiliar room for something to do.
for advice about it.” She ruffled his hair. “Would you stop sulking for one minute and realize that he’s trying for you? He doesn’t want to start another fight. He wants to be your friend again.”
"J, pull up all Stark patents between 74' and now. May be something useful there. Search all key phrases and get back to me."
"N-no...not gentle..." Steve begged as he heard Tony getting ready, wanting to be manhandled, wanting to feel every inch of his man.
“No, thanks, J.” Tony answered as he looked around, taking in all the different projects this Other-Stark seemed to be working on. “I’m from a parallel universe. Just switched places with your Tony Stark for a while. He’s in my lab, and he’ll be back safe and sound in exactly 8 hours. I’ll just be running some tests around here to collect some data on inter-dimensional travel.”
But first, he had to get his thoughts in order. Once he was back in the penthouse, he took a long, hot shower, thinking back to his conversation with Pepper. She’d made it clear that Steve really liked him. It was still hard to believe, but he couldn’t ignore all the signs. Steve wouldn’t have done...
"Shhh...yeah. Feel that, baby? Good, isn't it? God, your hole is really opening up so nicely for me now. I think I can put another finger in right now. You want that, baby?" Tony was holding on to Steve's shoulder as he pushed his hand deeper. Steve was still reeling from the pressure on his sensitive spot, and couldn't answer, pushing his hips down to feel more, his eyes rolling back, mouth agape.
"Hey guys! Nat, are you joining us? We're watching the finale of Iron Chef today!" Steve walked in, oblivious to the tension in the room, and sat right next to Tony.
I'm not a doctor or expert in mental health. I am only writing based on my own personal experiences. If you feel anxious, depressed or panicked, please do not take any of my work as advice and seek professional guidance instead.
"Yeah, I don't think I've ever had Cuban food before. These banana things are so good." Steve took a big chunk of plantain and smothered it in sauce.
"Sure, go ahead and give him access to the lab too, I'm pulling up his biometrics now. Don't forget to tell him that he should absolutely avoid taco Tuesdays downstairs, no matter what birdbrain says." Tony was telling Jarvis as he opened the door to his car, Pepper waiting in the backseat for him.
Tony peeked inside, carefully opening the wooden box he found in the bag. Once he saw what was inside, he shut it and quickly tapped away at his phone.
Steve got up early, packed his things and started heading towards Los Angeles. He remembered the traffic from yesterday and wanted to get a head start, as Jarvis said it could take a couple hours to get there.
"Yeah. There was...a moment. We were talking about something, I don't really remember what. But he looked out at the sunset and all I could see was the sun shining in his eyes. They were gorgeous. Like specks of gold floating in the ocean." He looked up at Steve again and smiled. "You have the same eyes, you know."
Steve didn't know what 'posting a nude to Twitter' was, but it sounded like Jarvis would look after him. As nervous as he was about staying with all these people he just met, he was also relieved that he might be able to get some answers about day to day living now, more than he could at SHIELD anyways. Everyone there treated him like he had a 'fragile' sticker on his forehead, and were so secretive to boot.
"Sorry, Stevie. I just woke up. Looks like we missed the game." Tony apologized with another little peck to Steve's cheek.
A romantic movie? Steve wasn't a big fan of those, and apparently neither was Tony - he immediately opened up his phone and started scrolling through his social media. Steve decided to give it a chance though, so he grabbed a few slices of pizza and settled in.
"I apologize Captain Rogers." Jarvis responded, "Sir is working and has requested privacy at this time."
"Had a good night, Steve? I didn't hear you come in until past 2am." Natasha asked, not so quietly, behind Steve while steeping her tea.
"He's a moron! Always with the charity cases. What, he thinks this can get him out of hell? Well news flash, buddy, you're doomed anyways. Don't drag our portfolios down with you!" The ugly man bellowed, a scattered cheer following his hateful comment. Steve snapped his pencil in half with his thumb in an effort to not break the conference table under his other hand. Pepper, the angel, reached over and placed a hand on his. Her eyes locked with his,
"I can put on a shirt if you want," Tony looked down at his chest, covering up the reactor with one hand. Shit, Steve must've been staring. "I know it's gross."
They watched some highlight videos on Tony's phone on their way to the next destination. Tony sat close to Steve, his head resting on Steve's shoulder as he clicked through Youtube, watching home run compilations. Steve tried to pay attention to the videos, but this easy companionship with Tony was so warm and distracting. He sat perfectly still, not wanting to break the fragile atmosphere, and tried to keep his eyes on Tony's phone. The ride was over way too soon. When they stopped, they stepped out  next to a hill with stairs. At the top of the stairs, they got to a beautiful building decorated in white marble pillars, a garden surrounding a pool, and Roman statues scattered throughout.
Steve smiled wider at that and put his hands on his waist, guiding him through the workshop, against one of the tables. He raised his head and Tony mimicked his movement, bursting into laughter when he saw another mistletoe hanging off the ceiling. Steve stole a kiss from him before lowering to his knees in front of him. Tony had to grip the table with both hands, feeling his cock twitch.
Tony laughed between his teeth, placing the cup on the table and licking his lips, to erase any trace of coffee. Steve’s eyes followed the movement and he soon feel his cock twitching for a second. He cursed his endless libido and the talent Tony had to wake his body by just existing. Tony studied him closely, before smiling. Steve knew right away that he was up to something.
“Language, captain” Tony smiled, caressing up and down. Steve let out a laugh, both exasperated and embarrassed. “Do you want me to?”
“Hello, sweetheart, I missed you too” Tony ‘greeted’ him, while Steve pulled the corner of his lips up, without saying anything. Tony wiped a bit of grease on his arm and came closer to the table where Steve had put the sandwiches and the coffee. He took a sip from the comforting drink. He moaned, closing his eyes, tasting the coffee on his tongue. Steve raised an eyebrow and shook his head, looking away for a second. What he saw made him smile.
Tony’s explicit response to his doing make Steve incredible proud and even more excited. He promised himself silently to never stop making Tony happy, in and out of bed.
Christmas was one of favourite moments of the year for Steve, even though New York looked so different from the New York from his memories. Nowadays there were more lights, more music and more people, but something about Christmas was timeless, the smell of a hot chocolate with marshmallows or a warm smile across the table on Christmas morning.
“Yes. Yes, please” nodded, smiling and unbuckling the button, showing the line of his dick under the jeans’ fabric. Tony’s smile went wider and he kissed the warm skin just above the pants, feeling how the muscles below his lips quivered. He couldn’t help himself and he smiled against the skin, enjoying his warmth.
For year and a half Tony had been experiencing himself that Steve’s serum not only enhanced physical strength. It also made Steve’s stamina go beyond measure. He was capable of running without breaking a sweat and boxing for hours, but also he could be in bed without tiring himself, recovering just a few minutes after he’d spent himself. He and Tony had learned how to increase the time of their encounters to allow Steve to go fully satisfied, while they also prolonged Tony’s pleasure, who usually said that, despite having a handsome super soldier in his bed, he wasn’t able to go for round two right after coming. And yet, there were days where they spent all morning in bed, waiting for Tony to recover, just kissing and caressing each other.
Their relationship was growing strong, month after month, and Steve felt more at ease with the vocal part of their physical relationship. More frequently he found himself responding to Tony’s innuendos, whispering in his ear, even if it was just his name, moaning when Tony touched him. But only when they were in the comfort and safety of their own room.
“Brought you something to eat” Steve said, while Tony looked over his shoulder to see who it was, before turning again to his work.
It was Christmas and Tony and Steve had been dating for year and a half. A year and half where they’d been supporting each other, in the battlefield and outside. They came to learn to understand each other, something that had always been second nature, but was now a part of themselves. During those sixteen months, Tony had taught Steve to appreciate what the 21
“Sweetheart” said Steve, pointing over his head. Tony followed his movement and saw a bunch of mistletoe he had hang there, under Natasha’s menace. Tony rolled his eyes and had to take another sip to hide the smile that was threatening to give him away. Steve looked at him, eyes soft but pretending carelessness. “Aren’t you going to follow traditions?”.
Tony left a kissing trail over Steve’s skin until he reached the front of the fabric. He grabbed his jeans and pulled down, to liberate his dick. He didn’t lose time enjoying the view, Steve’s body as familiar to him as his own. He put a hand on his base and swallowed him whole. Steve’s entire body trembled feeling the wetness that enveloped him. He wasn’t small but Tony had many talents and he put all of them in practice with him. He sucked his dick all the way up until he had only the tip in his mouth and could lick his head with his tongue. His hand continued to caress the base, now slippery because of the saliva, going up slowly, until his fingers touched his lips.
The crunch of electronics and glass draws his gaze away from the flecks of green in those eyes to the ground where the blond asshole has his obliterated phone under his heel.
"The arm always hurts," James states, ignoring Steve for now. If Steve is with James, and James wants him to be with Tony, then James needs a reason to be around Tony a lot. It's elementary. Everyone knows Tony Stark gets a hard on from any tech, so James' arm should provide an adequate excuse to stay down here.
Tony nods silently, idly scratching James' scalp as he thinks. "Does it matter?" he asks after a minute, his smile a tentative and brittle thing.
After Tony pulled off his dick he couldn’t imagine ever enjoying something more than that. But here he is, with Tony panting against him, his gorgeous face flushed with exertion, his gorgeous cock rubbing against Steve’s.
"Great! Steve, why don't you introduce Buckaroo to the bots while I look at those. Dummy's been giving us a sad camera face ever since you arrived."
He is about to say as much, but then what comes out of his mouth is “yes.” And what? That is not what he wanted to say. At all. Stupid brain. He goes to correct his mistake, but Steve is now picking him up and spinning him around talking about how happy he is, and how it’ll be a date that Tony will never forget. So Tony feels himself cave, and gives a mental shrug thinking ‘Ah what the hell, it’s only one date, he’ll figure out I’m not worth it soon enough’. With that, he gives into his urge, and proceeds to wrap his arms around Steve’s neck, hugging him back.
“It’s obviously his stage name Clint, Phil just said it was Tony.” Nat said. Steve saw her roll her eyes at Clint in fondness, before directing her narrowed gaze towards Tony. “It seems the guy came prepared.”
He could feel the beginnings of Steve’s arousal too, as it was still inside of him, and he entwined his fingers into Steve’s hair to hold him there, as he sucked on Tony’s chest.
It had all started when Steve a little desperate for cash had agreed to paint a nude portrait for an acquaintance of Natasha's. Steve was an art student at the neighbouring community college, while Tony - the subject of the aforementioned painting - was a bright young PhD student at MIT.
“I’m close too, fuck, come for me, Tony.” And Tony felt himself convulse as his his orgasm rushed through him. He squeezed around Steve as he came, and Steve pounded once, twice, thrice more before he too, fell in the crook of Tony’s neck, his name on Steve’s lips as he pressed his release deep inside of Tony.
Tony felt himself wince. He'd been avoiding Pepper due to that reason for a while now. He knew that she had been trying to get him to engage in some 'healthy human relations" that didn't just consist of old men more than twice his age, that he had to meet with in order to appease Obie and the board. He had to suppress another wince at the thought. It was difficult to build relationships with people his general age. He was underage for one thing, and smarter than everyone else for the other. It didn't help matters that almost everyone knew who he was, so deciphering if people wanted to friend him for his fame, wealth, and intellect or were actually genuine was always an ordeal. He just thanked the stars that he had Rhodey and Pepper-who despite being his PA, cared just as much about him as Rhodey.
But as with all things that Howard possessed, he eventually abandoned both his search for Steve Rogers and the collection. And as with all things that Howard abandoned, Tony was quick on the uptake.
"When Thanos, used the time stone, to bring back Vision, time didn't go back for us, it only affected Vision. I don't know how just yet but -"
It isn't until after he's returned the infinity stones and is back to the present that Steve finally has the chance to deal with everything that has happened.
"So, we're supposed to go and suck this stone outta Thor's Ex, right after the past you leaves after inserting it back into her?" Clint reiterated, and seemed skeptical as he talked.
"Hey, we're family." He said to her. A look of warmth spread across her face then, and Steve finally felt like everything was going to be all right again. He was going home.
Tony placed his hands down onto Steve’s pecs, and lifted himself off Steve’s hard dick. Come dripped out of Tony’s hole and back onto Steve’s dick, coating it in a sleek shiny white layer.
“Stop these tricks Loki, change back at once or by Odin’s beard I shall make you!” Thor shouted, and Steve had to work quickly, holding on to Thor to prevent him from pulverizing Loki before they had had a chance to get the information they needed from him.
Bucky had whistled at the sight before saying, “Is that the latest gift from our resident Sugar Daddy?”
The room itself was pretty grand. It had two large grid windows on either side of the room with heavy ornate burgundy curtains alongside them. The floors were of hardwood with rich oak colours to give the room an elegant feel. The items themselves were placed in such a way that contrasted with the elegant architecture.
"Not the first time around." He tried to state plainly, but a little bit of resentment might have shone through, if Bruce's furrowed brow was to be believed.
Now, sitting so that Tony was straddling him once again, Steve grabbed both of Tony’s cheeks, spreading them so that Tony had greater access to his opening.
“Well, considering how he's capable of making anyone his personal flying monkey, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were still a couple of people under his control from the sceptre.” Clint piped up from his spot, casually upkeeping his bow with a concentrated focus. Steve could tell the thought of people being out there still under Loki’s control was not a comforting notion to the man.
Steve should have known better than to believe anything Loki had to say, but the comment had come out of nowhere and had completely thrown him for a loop. Loki had said Bucky and it was like Steve was that little kid from Brooklyn again.
Tony didn’t actually believe that there was any sort of life beyond death. There was their short little stint on earth and then nothing, nada, that was it, say goodbye bub. It was the reason why he was always so desperate to make his mark on earth a good one. He needed to make sure he left the earth better than it had been for the people he would leave behind.
Sharon had been amazing in their little group but she was gone now and they wanted, no he needed a sound that was different than what they had before.
Steve disregarded their conversation and stepped up onto the platform; looking around to the people in the room. He stated the plan.  "We go back, retrieve the stones, and then jump to the specified time at Volmir."
Everyone then sort of ended up looking towards Steve as the only one left who had yet to say anything and whom had had a very pinched look on his face.
“Huh. Little dude’s got a little bit of spunk to him. ” Bucky raised his pen towards Tony, “Gotta give him some points for that.”  he finished as he leaned back in his chair. It seemed Tony had piqued the interest of the rest of his band mates as well. That was why they worked so well together, Steve and his team had gone through a lot together and in terms of people they were often wary but when they weren’t, they always seemed to be drawn to similar people.
He sat at one of the tables dispersed around the room of a club the Avengers often played at. The auditions had started at noon and once everyone had registered, they'd all been ushered into the room. The room contained all the Avengers band members sitting at a long table facing the stage. Once everyone had been ushered in, their manager, a man named Phil Coulson, had given a brief introduction and explained the process.
The man-Tony, as Phil was announcing in the mike-seemed to all of a sudden come to an awareness that Steve had met his eyes and abashedly turned his head. His interest piqued, he watched in amusement as the flustered man flung himself up and all but dashed to the stage.
"It's the tools too," James continues, emboldened by how his confession seems to bring Steve and Tony closer.
Tony suspects it's completely non-alcoholic and prepared under the supervision of Nat and/or Steve, it’s a toss up between them.
The scene erupts in chaos and James briefly slumps down in defeat. On the other roof Steve tears off Tony's pants, not in the romantic way James had envisioned after tonight, but to check for burns, and proceeds to throw his soda over the already sodden genius.
The faceplate flips open to reveal Tony’s beautiful face, his eyes locking onto Steve’s without fail.
Before he gets more emotional and starts crying or something equally embarrassing, Tony pushes Steve back onto the mattress. He starts kissing down his chest slowly, showing without words just how
“I saw,” Tony smiles and gets up from his spot near the door to get a closer look. “Tell me about it?”
“Don’t you dare apologise for that, that was the hottest thing I’ve ever seen,” he whispers, and the moment is gone.
In the elevator, James tries to make sense of all the emotions warring within him. He's not here for himself. He's here to finally get Steven Grant Rogers and Anthony Edward Stark to kiss and be happy together forever. When they are, James can leave with a peaceful mind. There are always more Hydra bases to raze, Nazis to punch in the nose with his metal fist, and new flavours of KitKat to sample.
, shoulders. Jesus, when’s the last time he’s been hugged? Bucky had held him close but that had been during sex. Before that, Rhodey maybe? Sunset never wanted to hold him, and towards the end with Ty the touches were something Tony avoided.
James nods, because it seems that’s what Tony is waiting for. Tony’s answering smile is as pretty as the sun.
He takes care to clean Tony gently, methodically. He wipes Tony's sweaty brow first, cleans their joined come off his stomach, places a kiss on top of Tony's soft dick after cleaning it as well. With every touch he shows how much he loves this man, and it makes Steve feel centred and calm, almost like before a battle.
Tony pushes at Steve, and it makes the idiot giant jump into action and leap over onto James' roof to pull him into a bear hug.
James is sitting on a bench across the bakery where they'll meet in fifteen minutes. Or more accurately, where Steve will arrive in the next fifteen minutes and Tony anywhere between twenty minutes and two hours from now.
“Thor…” Nat says not quite warningly, and Thor winks at her, the old charmer. Not for the first time, Steve wonders what is true of all the myths about the Asgardians he has read.
Later, after the nurses and doctors have bustled around and done their tests, after Steve talked to Rhodey on the phone to give his team the good news, after Steve has had a shower and a shave, they sit together again. Tony is a little more upright in the bed - the horrid nasal tube gone and a little more colour on his cheeks.
. Tony in the meantime, looks like someone kicked his puppy, and his puppy's puppy too. When Steve turns back -- blush so fiery James is tempted to upend a bucket of water over him -- Tony transforms his face back into something that resembles a smile if you don't look closely as they resume their walk.
"You just…" Tony starts when he catches up with Steve and waves in Steve's general direction to convey the rest of the sentence. To be fair Tony seems to make an effort to school his features as far as they're not obscured by his sunglasses, but Steve
“Have you been drinking long? Sorry I got late, by the way. I know you wanted to do dinner too but. Work. You know how it is,” Tony says privately to Steve as he reaches forward to place his empty beer bottle near the leg of the table.
James had a stroke. It's the only explanation. The trigger words triggered an aneurysm and now he's hallucinating or in a coma.
Tony pouts, turning to look Bruce in the eyes, “Well, you could’ve just taken a glass for us to experiment on. Don’t
He could just take one from the table but he's particular about the temperature of his beer and after the day he's had he really wants to sit back and relax with a cold one.
It's easy to acquire suitable clothing without leaving a trace - humans are careless with their possessions - and when he's dressed he lopes off with long strides. Time to lead his captors away and devise a plan.
"Nah. Haven't been drunk since the night Bucky shipped out." Steve shakes his head, and to prove his point takes another big sip. It really tastes damn good. Heavy, but fruity and sweet at the same time. Unlike anything he's ever tasted on earth.
"I still don't know your name." The contractors had talked about a mister Stark, but he guesses that's the kid's father. The whole place is too grand, too barren for a teenager to live in.
Up close, watching Steve and Tony make happy moon eyes at each other certainly feels like daggers to his intestines, but it's better than
“I can… I can do that. I’m good at checkin’. Call me Captain Check… in’? Captain Check. Call me Captain Check,” he grins, which turns into a giggle.
"I meant twice for ev'rything," Steve adds, hoping for more of that wide eyed look where it seems Tony wants to devour Steve. Steve is good with being devoured. More than twice.
He likes the weight of Tony on top of him, now that the world is only slightly wobbling instead of outright spinning. It wouldn’t be a hardship to stay like this all night. Or year.
Tea had been a staple in Jarvis’ routine to bring Tony out of his head, to soothe the aches his father’s words or mother’s absences left, to communicate his support when Tony felt adrift and bowed down by the demands of his name and genius. As he grew up, after Ana was gone, after Jarvis retired to his cottage, after he passed away in his sleep with Ana’s locket in his hand, after his parents, Tony still from time to time put the kettle on and longed for simpler times.
He avoids looking at the scorch mark on the rug, the entry point of the demon who’d managed to not only rock Tony’s world in the bedroom department but also give him a glimpse of something more tender and precious before taking it all away with him as he turned tail and ran – literally in his case.
Steve is barely aware he sags to his knees, his legs simply unable to hold the weight of the knowledge. In the clip the demon,
It's an oddly tranquil way to spend the time. Steve is content to sit and wait in silence, but he doesn't want Tony to feel alone wherever his genius mind is floating, so he talks. He tells Tony about his mom, about growing up sick, about needing to prove he can do better than people think. He cries a little when he talks about Bucky, his brother who he lost in the war. He recounts war stories about the Howlies, talks about Howard and Peggy.
All he knew was that there was this hulking blond man who resembled the sickly fae from his cryo dreams, and because he desperately needed some kind of mission he had taken it upon himself to shadow the man.
Steve isn't surprised to find a gift basket the next morning at his door, containing three different shower gels, five bath bombs, and a heron shaped umbrella.
Tony takes hold of Steve’s wrist, pulling his hand away from his cock and leading it to his hair. “You can pull if you like, I’m into that,” he says, taking hold of Steve’s cock in his own hand, the other cupping his balls as he leads the head of Steve’s cock into his mouth.
He's most definitely not here to enjoy himself and quietly wish he could always stay. It doesn't matter what Bucky used to want
He downs the last of his drink - this time it was whatever was nearest, not wanting to get off of Steve’s lap which happened to be Nat’s vodka - as he bends down to examine the bottom of the tower.
“Everyone.” Nat pulls a bottle of vodka from under the couch to refill her glass, and at Clint’s puppy eyes she pours him a tiny bit as well. He keeps on pouting, until she leans into him to whisper something into his ear that makes him grin widely.
summon a creature from hell, for instance. The thought helps Steve to keep himself from going over and pull Tony in a hug, however much the kid might need the comfort.
,” Thor suddenly booms, sitting up straight to glare at Bruce. “If not for my respect for Anthony’s furniture, I would challenge you to a duel.”
Tony gives Steve a calculating look and there’s a few beats of silence between them before he responds. Not a kitten to try and handle bare handed, Steve reminds himself, however innocent Tony might look.
"I can't even begin to fathom what you're trying to goad me into, or what your ploy is, other than to distract me. So I'm asking you once: do you know where Bucky is?"
They sent Steve out to hunt Bucky and put him down like a mangy dog. To be his best friend's executioner, no judge required. Never did they discuss how Steve could capture Bucky and bring him back to the light. Not once.
Steve, the idiot, denies the flowers James has sent in his name to Tony during their afternoon walk are his, and pays the delivery guy to
It takes a few weeks -- and several raids of not so former Hydra bases (where he may or may not maim or kill everyone in his way) to obtain the equipment -- but then he has mics installed in all the usual places Steve and Tony visit.
he booms, slowly turning to take in everyone in the room, “is a barrel of the finest mead Asgardian brewers have ever created.” A dramatic pause to draw the listeners in. Steve never fails to be amazed by Thor’s penchant for theatrics.
Steve tries to pick up Tony bridal style, and while the weight isn’t any problem, it does throw him off balance, with the world already spinning like a merry go round. Just a little less merry. They lurch and wobble, until finally, Steve pulls Tony close to his chest to carry him like a koala.
A few pulls and Tony’s close to coming. He grips Steve’s wrist, stopping his movements as he explains, “No - I - together, want to come with you, Steve. Together.”
"They told me they needed me." Steve says and wipes a hand over his face. He can't bear anymore to stay alone with his thoughts, needs someone to distract him.
Tony looks at Steve in shock not having expected this. The blond’s eyes are clear and his smile is so soft and adoring and it is trained on
"Pink slime suits you better than green," Tony smirks, and is rewarded with renewed blushing, but then Steve leans forward a little.
Steve smiles and sits down between them to take up his vigil again. Bruce hands him a large coffee and Clint the last donut.
“He was here, you saw that, he’s - he’s okay. You didn’t - he wasn’t hurt when he was here. And he left of his own volition.” and yeah, that stings like the fresh wound it is as much as it did when he woke up this morning to an empty bed and god, was it only just this morning?
He almost has to take a moment to send a prayer of thanks to a god he doesn’t believe in when Steve’s cock- large, red, sticky with his seed from his first orgasm, and absolutely gorgeous- swings out of his briefs and slaps lightly against his stomach.
Tony barely stifles a very, very embarrassing squeak at the sudden shift in altitude and stabilises himself by wrapping an arm around Steve which puts their faces right next to each other. His heartbeat has quickened, both from surprise and the position he’s found himself in.
This is why being in a team is dangerous. He doesn't want any of his friends to get hurt. He's only now slowly recovering from Bucky's death, he'll break if Tony--
"Not until after at least seven showers," Tony grins and blows Steve a kiss, laughing loudly when he jumps away just in time to avoid being flicked in the face with droplets of shit.
The dumb fucks should not be hovering over an unstable assassin like this, and it's his annoyance at this blatant disregard for their own safety that makes him snap out of whatever came over him.
The door slides open to admit him, carrying a huge cask on his shoulder. Steve wonders if it's empty until Thor deposits it at their feet with a large thud.
He leans down on an impulse to press a soft kiss onto the centre of it. "Thank you for keeping Tony alive," he whispers softly, closing his eyes as he presses his ear against the casing to soak up the familiar hum of the machine.
“Fuck….” He breathes out, groping blindly at the side of the bed for his phone. It takes another full minute of squinting at the phone through bleary eyes to access the seldom used home-control app he’d developed as a pre-JARVIS, and get the blackout curtains to slide shut.
“Don’t worry, kiddo. I just wanted to tell you that the board meeting is taken care of. I gave them our usual spiel about you working on a new idea. And not a hint of your rager last night is going to be on the news, I’ll make sure of it.”
"I can explain…" Tony starts, though now that he surveys his surroundings he's not quite sure what made him think this was a good idea.
But he still has most of his impulse control, again debatable if he ever had that, and he decides to go with a less shocking answer.
There is only so much shock a person can endure before they stop reacting to it. Suppression is a powerful tool that Tony masters in. All of last night was an assault on his scientific world view and when the blinding light fades leaving behind an impression of giant wings still underneath his eyelids, Tony leaves his skepticism at the door and rolls with it.
In any case, there’s tea to be made because if Tony doesn’t keep moving, doesn’t keep running through these subroutines as a way to comfort himself and maybe, maybe provide some comfort to someone else, then he’s gonna fall apart.
“No, wait, I – Ix-nay, Jay. And you,” Tony points at the blond adonis, “how did you get in and more importantly, did you fuck with my surveillance inside?”
to scratch a century old itch. But why wouldn’t he, if he could? Tony was drunk and stupid and easy pickings.
They keep Tony in a coma for four days more. Somewhere an extra bed is moved into the room which all the staff politely ignores. Somehow there’s always leftover food just waiting to be warmed up when Steve emerges to use the restroom. That's the only time Steve leaves Tony's side, that and when they have to clean and dress the wounds.
Steve isn’t bothered at all and reaches out with his other hand to wipe batter from Tony’s other cheek. “Mmm, chilli chocolate.”
It's too much. Tony's smell and touch and the promise of future times they will have sex. Steve was close ever since they entered the penthouse, but he thought he could at least hold out until they were both naked.
"On Valnheim they play Stabøl," Thor says conversationally, filling Steve's mug and his own. "It's like this Jenga, but with trees."
Tony can sense the censure in JARVIS' robotic tone and he feels highly judged by his own creation. “I don’t know what I intend, J. I don’t even know how much of that
"I can, you know," he says in between pressing hot kisses to all the parts of Tony's neck that are within reach.
"At least you're clean again?" Tony tries, earning him the meanest look he has ever had the dishonour of receiving.
He leans his forehead against Tony's when the need to pump his hips dies down. "Sorry," he smiles, a little embarrassed. "It's another serum thing…"
James can't sneak away. As soon as they cross the threshold of the lab he has a panic attack so bad he completely blacks out and wakes up on his back on the shittiest couch a billionaire can own, with Steve and Tony hovering above him.
Tony grimaces at that, before he catches the sly look on Steve’s face. “Can’t you stop being a troll even now?” He asks with a snort of amusement, swatting Steve on his shoulder. “The
"Oh noooo," Steve smiles, gently placing his hands on Tony's thighs and rubbing them up and down. "Whatever shall I do?"
There he is. Captain America. Steven Grant Rogers. Also known as the biggest pain in James' butt since his first shrill cry on this God forsaken planet.
Purely platonic business meeting between co-workers. This sounds good and plausible if anyone should ask him where he's going. Not that he encounters anyone up the flight of stairs to the common floor, nor on his trek from the stairwell to Steve's quarters.
"Really, Tony? You're gonna make me your princess?" Steve asks, and tries to keep a straight face, but fails miserably because his mouth insists on staying in this goofy grin.
Tony’s eyes widen, his pupils are blown out with arousal as he looks at Steve. “That… I’m gonna ignore that that was more than two words if you promise to come in my mouth at least one of those two times.”
Tony’s surprised Steve hasn’t nagged her into taking it off the table, although it’s possible she’s just taking advantage of Steve’s preoccupation with his conversation with Thor.
Everyone is silent for a moment, before bursting out in laughter, with Thor clearly audible above everyone else.
“Penthouse, J,” Tony calls as he takes the first opportunity they get for relative privacy to grab Steve by the nape and pull him into a filthy kiss.
James watches over the good Captain as he recovers in the hospital, and notices the comings and goings of his team. He moves with them to New York, where they find residence in the most ostentatious tower (James secretly loves), and he cons his way into an apartment close by.
He barely has the realisation that Steve chose this moment to bear hug him from the back before he loses his footing and bumps his shoulder against the Jenga tower, causing it to come down in a rain of wooden blocks.
Steve… Steve croons. He actually croons and Tony is pretty sure he'll wake up from this dream/hallucination/death -
Anything to keep you from making that joke again,” Tony says with a dramatic air, and leans into Steve some more, his whole solid solidness enough to make Tony swoon like a damsel.
"You've got a little something there," Steve points and carefully scoops a little batter from Tony's cheek to put into his mouth.
“NOOOO,” Steve yells, but it’s no use. Almost in slow motion he sees the armour fly into reach of the sword arms just as Thor comes up from behind. Steve sees Thor lift his hammer to smash what could be the power source, but too late. The giant bot flings out one of its arms,
Tony can’t help but startle into a disbelieving chuckle at the hunk’s reaction. On one hand, it’s always hilarious to see people jump three feet in the air when they first meet J, and it’s kinda funny to especially see someone pull a sword on an incorporeal AI. On the other, did he just throw himself in front of Tony like some shield made out of muscle and sheer determination. And that second thing - that second thing causes Tony’s amusement to fade into incredulity and disbelief because who
Steve grits his teeth against the noise which sounds like nails over blackboard times twenty, even through the ear plugs their teammates warned them to wear.
“Now that’s a cheque I’d like to cash!” Tony giggles with him, squeezing Steve’s firm left pectoral.
"Just minding you is a day-to-day task," JARVIS chuckles, but Tony forgets to ground his wayward AI son when he rounds the corner to absolute mayhem.
“Don’t worry your pretty blond head about it, he didn’t do anything I didn’t want him to do,” Tony says, shrugging the shoulder with the bite mark on it. Yeah, that’s still hot as fuck. The memories of last night rush back in and Tony fights a smile. “There’s something to be said about demonic stamina. And before you bring out your sword again - no pun intended - I didn’t make him do anything he didn’t want to either. On the contrary, he was very,
"Bucky..?" Steve asks stupidly, and James feels aggravated enough to punch him if he was closer (a recurring emotion in just about all his memories that have resurfaced).
Tall, Blond, and Handsome suddenly is, the way those blue eyes are boring into his soul, the weight of his warm,
“I told you my name, but I still don’t know who you are,” he says softly, instead of answering. He has the feeling the kid wants to be good, Steve saw a sliver of that when the kid’s armour cracked just now. He wants to be good, but has been damaged so badly already the only option seems to fight and hurt others.
“Steve.” Tony smiles and Steve is helpless to do anything but smile back, as he hugs the armour tight against his chest, his gloves wet and sticky on Tony’s back.
"I don't cheat," Steve answers automatically. He's just very good at creative application of the rules.
He was certain that he’d done it, had sex with Bucky because he was attracted to him, because he was lonely, and he wanted to be desired.
The little word hurts. It’s everything James wants and might’ve pretended for a while to have, but he can’t anymore.
Steve is always early for appointments. James knows this is because he's used to leaving home early to make up for any number of asthma attacks along the way. James also knows Steve is terrible at waiting, and will change position and fiddle with stuff non stop.
"Mister Jarvis," Steve asks, voice tight as he forcibly denies his thoughts to take the path they did, "are there images of this
“You - they sent you for him but you don’t have to hunt him, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to. You say he’s your friend, so you can stop him from - whatever it is he wants to do
“Hey, it’s okay. Breathe. You know him, don’t you? You know Bucky... ” Tony trails off, uncertain what to say, if he
“There are power cords on its back, follow them down,” Iron Man tells Thor over the comms, and Steve’s heart all but stops when he sees what Tony’s plan is. He knows the man by now, knows he will do
Maybe someday he’ll push further until he can take all of him in, bury his nose in the well trimmed patch of dark blond pubic hair, but not tonight.
A slight chuckle escapes Tony’s lips as he pulls away enough to look Steve in the eye. Steve looks as if someone’s ran over his puppy and then backed up for good measure, and Tony parks the humour in the situation to tease Steve with later.
S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are maintaining a perimeter when they arrive, while Thor and Iron Man do their best to lure what appear to be giant cubes of green jell-o away from habitation.
At some point Steve looks up and not quite startles when he sees Tony. His face morphs from frowning in intense concentration into smiling widely, and it's like watching the clouds break open to reveal the sun - what is it about Steve that brings the poet out in Tony?
It's a drawing of a scene he remembers vividly. Dum-E had just finished an art work - spurred on by Steve often drawing in the workshop - and the quality and subject had taken Tony's breath away. In the drawing Tony is hugging his bot child around his metal strut; his eyes are closed and Dum-E leans his camera on Tony's shoulder. It looks like… like love, and the image makes him smile fondly. It’s rare for someone to recognize the bond Tony has with his bots, so far only his Platypus did, but Steve has adopted them like an uncle and it’s not a small part of why Tony is so fond of him.
four health and safety protocols.” Tony starts backing away with his hands raised but Steve advances with that unholy grin that shouldn’t be as attractive as it is and pulls Tony close enough to lick some more chocolate from his forehead.
Seeing Bucky's face after 288 years pulled open a valve and Steve is losing himself in the maelstrom.
James likes to be first. He has staked out the area, satisfied that there are no bad guys planning nefarious deeds, and whispered a suggestion to the baker to make sure there are enough double chocolate banoffi doughnuts (Steve's favourite) and white chocolate eclairs (Tony's favourite) on hand.
James doesn't understand what is taking them so long to proceed to the next stage of their relationship. It's very clear -- to James -- that Steve is sad about it. There's this slant to his shoulders that screams disappointed resignation, just before Just A Rather Very Intelligent System makes the windows opaque and James loses his view.
century could offer him. Always with him by his side, obviously. He had taken him to Greece to show him that, even though they are ruins today, they have always been a reminder of the glorious past. He had gone with him to all the military museums they had encountered, listening to Steve’s own stories about war. Tony’s workshop had witnessed long hours where you could only hear the sliding of pencil against paper and the tools against the metal. But after some time you could also hear footsteps, the squeak of cushions when two bodies collapsed on the couch and moans and heavy breathing.
Steve was carrying some sandwiches and a cup of coffee while descending to the workshop. He hadn’t seen Tony all day, when he woke up that freezing morning, early to go on a jog, FRIDAY had told him that Tony was already in his workshop, working on an update for Peter’s suit. He decided then to go downstairs at lunch time, knowing that otherwise Tony wouldn’t be eating until night. He introduced the code which granted him access, and the first thing he saw was Tony’s body reclined over a panel.
They had learned to understand each other, to concede and to listen, something that was surprisingly easy, but they also learned to find the best way to satisfy the other.
Tony pulled down a bit more of the jeans, exposing Steve’s thighs, hard as steel, to grab onto them. Steve moaned his name, his body tensed with anticipation. Tony’s fingers went up and down his thighs, softly caressing with the tips of his fingers, using just a bit of nail that sent shivers though Steve’ spine. He opened his mouth and he swallowed his entire length, until his nose touched the warm skin. He started bobbing his head, letting just a few inches go out of his mouth.
Tony didn’t answer. He dropped to his knees, without looking away from his eyes. Steve’s breath caught in his throat and he couldn’t help biting his lip for a second, under Tony’s gaze who followed the movement of his lips. They remained silent for a moment longer, letting the atmosphere become thicker and warmer, attractive.
“Are you okay?” Steve pushed and pulled Tony’s limbs around, patting down every inch of his body, furiously checking for any scratches or loose shrapnel that may have hit him.
"Fuck." He tried to grab something, anything, but there was nothing nearby. Tony, feeling Steve's balls pull up, grabbed both of Steve's hands with his and held on tight, pushing his face down and swallowing the soldier's hot spunk until there wasn't a drop left.
"Lucky kid." Tony commented. Steve looked at him, chest thumping, wondering if he was going to give himself away right now.
"You know..." He grinned smugly. "I happen to have access to the main stage. Security will let us through, we could go take a look if you want."
"You'll find out soon enough, nosy Nelly." Tony was still looking a little nervous, so Steve resolved to try to ease the conversation into the charity work, if it would make things easier on him.
"I had a great time." Steve stood up and motioned for Tony to follow. They walked back the couple of blocks to the hotel, Steve explaining something to Tony on the way. "You know I really enjoy that you talk to me so much, right? I don't want you to stop just because you feel that you're annoying me or anything. You aren't annoying at all. In fact, I don't know where I'd be without you." Tony slipped his hands in his pockets, but kept quiet to listen. "You gave me a place to stay, made sure I was safe on this trip, in more ways than one. You even offered to visit when I was feeling real' low. I couldn't ask for a better friend. So I want to hear
about a million times this weekend. He was just happy to have made a friend. Now he won't even want to be friends anymore." Tony was on the verge of tears.
. I’ll leave a note next time.” Tony pursed his lips, like he really wanted to blow up at Steve, but thought better of it. “Is that all?”
"And he took off my helmet, then he was just - I don't know. Running his fingers through my hair, I guess?"
“Captain Rogers? It seems that Mr. Stark is in his lab now, and has not set privacy mode on.” FRIDAY chimed up. Steve dropped a pair of pants in shock. He didn't think FRIDAY would
"Did he now?" Natasha looked at Steve, who was currently staring at Tony again. The shorter man had turned back around, towards the stove, and was stretching an arm up to the top of the upper cabinets, reaching for a big bowl. His apron, tied tightly around his waist, emphasized his curvy figure even more.
“C’mon. M’almost done.” Tony gestured with a nod. Steve blinked. This was turning into quite an odd morning. He took his clothes from the floor and slipped into them, and cautiously walked behind Tony back into the bathroom, unsure if the invitation was normal. He
Tony knew they were fiercely bound together regardless of what happened. Two men, in the wrong era - at the wrong place - in the wrong time. They needed the other, their fates would always cross, no matter how much it hurt.
Steve put his phone away. It was still very early in the morning and it was a sure bet that Tony wasn't up yet. He'd been texting photos of his trip to Tony every couple of days. At first, it was just to keep him updated, so he'd know he was safe. But now, he would look forward to talking to someone he knew, even if it was only a couple texts.
“Maybe.” Steve said. “But we would’ve worked it out, eventually, right?” He gave Tony a small smile. “We always do.”
you. Just...try to be nice to him? Hit on him? I don’t know, Tony. He’s basically already had sex with you - the rest can’t be that hard, right?”
." A hand shot up to Steve's hair, pulling back so he could see his face. "Fuck me. Bedroom. Now." Tony groaned, voice low and gravely with desire, before attacking Steve’s neck, leaving a trail of hickeys in his wake. Steve looked around at their surroundings - he'd been in here before, but he didn't know where Tony's bedroom was. Tony got impatient and pulled on his hair again.
"Mmmm. Me too." Steve squeezed him tightly. Tony laughed at that. He felt Steve's arms moving around him, then the swipe of cloth along his lower back, and between their stomachs. Steve was cleaning him up gently with his own clothes, then there was a soft press of lips on his forehead made him yawn. Steve shifted and gave him one more kiss right on the lips.
“Sorry, you’re right, you’re right. Cockblock isn’t ‘PC’. He delayed your romantic conquest, or whatever the kids are saying now. What, are you blind Stark? Let the man work!”
"No! I need to pee!" Tony giggled, trying to push himself away. After another second of forced snuggling, Steve mercifully let go, and Tony wiggled out of his embrace. It felt so right, so domestic. Steve almost fell back asleep to this thought when he heard a thump and a pained "Ow!"
"You...you really like that, don't you sweetie?" Tony flexed his fingers in Steve's hair, and Steve's cock jolted up again at that.
"No." Steve lied, standing up, and started pacing the room in a fit of nerves. "Just - I wish things could go back to how they were before. I thought when we forgave each other, everything would go back to normal. But they haven't. I should've made more of an effort to tell him how I felt back when I had the chance but, I don't know. I guess I was always a little bit…"
"That's weird." Tony knew usually the crew would just relocate to an indoor project if that was the case.
"FRI?" He questioned. FRIDAY never let anyone get all the way to the door without announcing their arrival.
Tony had a husband and a life completely distinct from theirs. The circumstances were completely different now. Things could never be like that here. Steve had fucked up - too much - too many times. There was no going back from the things they had done, and the things they had said.
"I...I realized that I didn't…I didn't give you a goodnight kiss." He fumbled out, hanging his head in shame, like it was the most unforgivable sin on earth. "And that's not a very nice thing for a boyfriend to do so…" He peeked up through his lashes at Tony, giving him a questioning look through his raised brow, asking for permission.
There were glimmering lights strung up everywhere, the tree was magnificent, its soft endearing glow washing over the small group in Tony's penthouse.
? Right now he kind of wanted to go hide in a hole, he wasn’t sure if he was ready to see everyone’s reaction.
Surprisingly, Steve enjoyed the spa day. Really enjoyed it. It was so relaxing to be waited on, hand and foot, literally. And it felt really nice doing it next to Tony. They made lazy, casual conversation sometimes, and sometimes just sat next to each other in a steam room or during a foot rub, silent and tranquil. It felt like something a couple might do.
"It was great. Thank you so much." Steve hesitated when the doors opened to his floor. "Um...well...see you tomorrow. Game and dinner, right?"
Then why was he so nervous? His stomach felt a little queasy. He went back in and turned in for the night, maybe it was just the sketchy steak he'd had at the bar.
“Yeah, that’s...kind of why I was down in the lab in the first place. I wanted to go back to the mirror universe to ask them how it all happened. How to get you to like me.”
'I'm okay' He thought to himself. 'I'm okay. There's no danger. It's just fireworks.' He thought, being this far out, that he wouldn't have to deal with them today. But he was wrong. 'You were wrong. You should've known. Even small towns have em' now. You should'a camped out in the park. Or gone to a big city hotel, there you wouldn't've heard them. You should'a stayed in New York, with your friends. You wouldn't have even heard the room next door there.' He was losing his grip. 'Get it together. Breathe. It's nothing. It can't hurt-'
how could he help himself? He tried to think of a way to avoid this being a one-and-done thing. But Steve
"I've never been there before, but it sounds like nice family bonding time." Clint gave his thumbs up. Steve was so relieved.
"Oh!" Of course that's what she meant. "Yes. It's great, I really enjoy living there, actually. Having everyone around has been very good for me, I think. Tony hasn't made me uncomfortable at all,"
"Okay. Just a nice dinner then." Steve whispered, not letting go of his hand, and placing his head softly on top of Tony's. Tony didn't know what he meant by that, and he didn't much care, because at least he was able to make him feel a little better for now. If he had to endure being so physically close to the unattainable man of his dreams in order to help, then that was just a sacrifice he'd have to make.
"Exactly!" Tony threw up his hands. "That's what I've been saying! No one is going to steal any plans, and even if they did no one is smart enough to create a new element to use it! There's no security issue!"
Now, in the harsh daylight, Steve loaded up his bike, yearning for the day he could go back to the tower and be there for the other man. It seemed like Tony was having a hard time with work lately, and Steve hated being so far away, not able to do much of anything. Speeding onto the road, he considered what he could get for Tony in the next town to cheer him up. Maybe a postcard? Apparently, anything could be sent through mail very quickly nowadays. He'd have to think of the perfect gift. He pondered it while listening to the music Tony loaded up for him, humming along to the catchy rock tunes that the man seemed to prefer. A couple hours later, as he was coming up on the Golden Gate Bridge, he realized - why was he even still here?
"Good. Great. I mean, I'm so glad. You mean so much to me. I don't know where I'd be without you, seriously." He rubbed the back of Tony's hands with his thumbs. "I promise I'll always be good to you. You deserve that, you deserve the whole world. I want you to be able to rely on me, to trust in me completely, sweetheart, and I know that will take some time-"
"Technically yes." Tony explained. "But it's an away game. Today, the stadium is all ours for the next few hours. We'll go on a tour, and get to see the Clubhouse, and we can even play some catch on the field if you want!" Tony seemed so enthusiastic, that Steve couldn't help but hold back a chuckle. "Everyone says Captain America was a huge Dodgers fan, but I haven't seen you watch a single baseball game since I've known you! So we have to fix that once and for all and figure out if the Dodgers are still your team." Tony poked him in the chest. "We're doing some soul searching today, Rogers."
"So some people will try to teach you by counting the beats or telling you where to move your feet. That's a load of crap. Dancing is all about your hips, and the rest will follow. Don't worry about where you step, right now we'll just move backwards and forward like this." Tony placed his hand on top of Steve's, pushing it against his hip. Steve took a deep, slow breath, in and out, sure to keep his groin as far away from Tony as possible. Wow, maybe this was a terrible idea. "You feel that? Just moving with the rhythm, and when my hips sway like that, my torso and legs naturally move with them. Getting it?"
"You sap." Tony teased, but he closed his eyes anyways and blew out the candle. Steve had turned back around to finish plating his own breakfast, but Tony couldn't wait any longer and took a big mouthful. "Mmmmmmmmm....good God Rogers. If I'd known you were good in the kitchen, I would've have taken you on a man-date much sooner." A spatula dropped, making a loud clanging sound.
Tony held out a hand, and Steve took it. He didn't need to say anything else, Tony leaned on his shoulder, closing his eyes, letting out a contented sigh when Steve carefully set his other hand above Tony's hip, pulling him in closer, swaying them to the gentle melody. The song wasn't very long, but it felt blissfully eternal.
“I see.” Other-Steve smiled mischievously, crossing his arms in front of him. “Boyfriend, huh? Wouldn’t want to be in
"I don't think you can just destroy whatever is there, Clint." Bruce interjected. "We need to make sure the old system is still operational so we can integrate the new power over to the old grid. Right, Tony?"
"Of course, Steve. Grab some more of those blankets and lay down, will ya? You can still see me right?"
Steve chuckled. He turned the helmet over in his hands. Had Tony stayed up all night making this for him? He tried it on, and it was a perfect fit. Comfortable and lightweight, but it felt durable. He pulled it off and looked at Tony, who was staring up at him in wonder...or maybe exhaustion.
"Look at me!" Steve gestured wildly at his general being. "I'm the most white male American there is! Old people love me, and you
, finally talking to me, being with me." He beamed at him, and Tony hesitantly smiled back. “I’m actually kind of glad we met them. They brought us together, after all.”
"So yeah." Steve sat back down and splashed Tony, making him giggle. "We aren't perfect. But we certainly are not ugly." He pulled over his phone. "See? Already got a thousand likes on our picture. We're
"I love you too." Tony bent down and kissed him, fiercely. Steve shivered at the sound of those words, like a huge weight had been lifted off him. To love Tony and to be loved back, it was amazing - it should've felt constraining but instead it was liberating. He could've shouted it from the rooftops, had he not still been so incredibly turned on by the suddenly determined man on top of him. Steve felt Tony slip his fingers out of him, and heard the pop of the lube bottle opening again. Two quick squirts and Tony was slicking himself up, lining up the head of his wet cock up with Steve's spent hole. Steve pulled his legs back, opening wider, allowing Tony to bend forward and keep kissing him while he pushed in. Steve gasped, one hand stuck between them, squeezing his rapidly hardening cock as he realized that Tony was really, really inside him now. And he loved him back. He loved him back! He threw his other arm around his man, relishing in being completely surrounded by him, penetrated by him, giving himself up entirely to him. Tony didn't waste any time, he started rocking into him, quickly reaching a punishing pace. The wet cum between them was cooling, slick, rubbing all over them as Tony slammed into Steve, harder and harder. He pulled himself up then, holding on to Steve's knees as he started pounding deeper and faster, and Steve watched his own cum glisten on Tony's chest.
"I...I've got to...um, I'll be right back. I'll see you at dinner, yeah? Bruce is making...something, I don't know. But you'll be there, right?" Tony frantically gathered his jacket and phone, scrambling towards the back of the lab.
"Hm...Well, let's just say, if you had asked me to share a bed with you in LA, I probably would've said yes." Steve shyly admitted behind a forkful of steak.
Steve didn't know what to make of that, but the car came to a stop just then and they were already there. He hadn't even noticed that they had driven up to a huge stadium.
"Good." Steve pulled him in close. "I don't wanna clean sheets tonight. I wanna sleep with my sugar daddy." He stuck his nose into Tony's neck and chuckled when Tony huffed, pretending to be annoyed, and tried to squirm away from his tight hold. "Love you, darling."
In the beginning, nerves and fear of not being physically compatible flew over their relationship, shadowing a time that otherwise it’s been the happiest of their lives. Both thought that Tony, experienced, spontaneous and so committed in bed would inevitably crash with Steve, stiff, always in control of himself and, above all, inexperienced.
