“No. I’m not. Was I surprised when you said you had married a stranger? Of course I was. But I appreciate that you’re both putting the effort in to making it work. Maybe you should let me talk instead of making all these defensive accusations.”
The night was as dull as Castiel was expecting. Even spending his time with Meg didn’t have the same veneer as time with Dean. Meg was as she always was, dry and sardonic and dismissive of his siblings. She occasionally turned to Castiel to make a caustic remark, but otherwise, Castiel spent most of his time thinking of Dean. Of the award that Dean had won, and how different a prestigious art award was to this one, which involved various companies run by Lilith’s family. How Dean would look in his tux, his hair slicked to the side. How much Dean took away his anxiety, which had been in full force all night. He found it difficult to even speak with Meg how he normally did, which she either didn’t notice or didn’t care enough about.
'Can I come too?' Dax asked quietly, shifting his feet. 'Faith's going to try and get me to fly again, I know it. And I wanna hear more about her as a kid.'
“Do you even know what they’re saying?” She blurted, sitting forward in her chair. Dean’s pen paused, and he glanced at Mr Singer. “They saw you giving me a ride to school, so of course that means we were doing it.”
“Uh, yeah.” Dean shrugged. Sam stood aside to let him in, and he walked into the sitting room, Sam appearing a few moments later with a couple of bottles of beer, the lids already off. He passed one to Dean without offering it first. “You weren’t expecting to see me?”
“Claire? Since your grandparents are bringing you into this argument, would you rather live with them, or with me?”
Castiel shot a glance at Claire. She could see it in her peripheral vision, but she stayed focused on the announcements board.
“Everyone’s a freak. We’re just not hiding it,” Alex said with a smirk, before patting Claire’s leg. “Enough of the feels, right? Let’s marathon some MCU.”
'Everyone who matters.' Castiel cuddled closer to Dean, who rested a hand on his shoulder. 'It'll work out Dean, and we'll be a family again, for real this time. But we should really get on, if you're leaving with Faith and Gabriel tomorrow then we need to discuss it with her sooner rather than later.'
'Faith, is it practical to hunt in heeled boots?' Dax asked as one of the thick heels came close to his face again.
“Because I think that perhaps you need some real closure,” Castiel said quietly. “I think I need to call Dean back, do you want to go and get some snacks for the flight?”
“And you know she and Patience take forever to say goodbye. They roped Alex and Kaia into whatever scheme they’re up to, and Alex’s friend Claire, so please stay. Two adults, that’s all I’m asking for.”
“Are you? I needed some recovery time, I look like an idiot with this thing on my face, I’m allowed to have some time off the grid for that.”
'Hey, I was just following orders!' Gabriel called softly from across the campfire. Dean bent closer to Faith.
The ambrosia and nectar flowed, and the music spread even to the peak of Mount Olympus. The satyrs came, playing their panpipes, dancing around Dionysus as he introduced wine to the merriment.
Gabriel appeared in front of her, sucking on a sucker and raising an eyebrow as he casually looked down to the ground.
Jack. The kid I could have cared about like he was my own if he didn’t kill my mother. The kid Cas has never second-guessed, has always cared for and raised like there was never a touch of Lucifer in him. I’m hearing what he’s getting to now. His happiness is in caring for people, and he thinks this will be enough. Maybe he’s going to fool the empty, get it to take Billie instead. We’ll have to move quickly to keep him.
“It’s really no different to an arranged marriage in that sense,” Castiel mused. “Getting married and then getting to know each other. The difference is that we both chose this.”
'Dad?' Faith asked around her third sandwich, which she was chewing furiously. 'Maybe it won't be so bad? I mean, I'm not looking forward to the idea of it, but Gabe's happy about this, and Mom supports it. Maybe I'll get a good one. Maybe I'll build an ark. I'll even take you and Uncle Sam on it.'
Hey so ... this is my thing, to write companion pieces. But I did realise that there was a lot going on Castiel's end of this story and it was only fair to give him a voice.
Dean looked around the room with an impressed look on his face. Castiel had his arms wrapped around his chest tightly, shoulders hunched, as though he was ashamed that someone might see his newly given Grace, his eyes glued to his fiancé.
Castiel’s face erupted in heat, and he left his coffee on the counter, striding back out of the room.
“Oh, right, you’re buddying up to the principal’s favourite. That way, you don’t get in trouble for your sexual harassment, right?”
Dean felt Castiel kiss the top of his head just as the older Mary appeared in the doorway. Dean and Castiel stood up reluctantly, following her into the kitchen and sitting together at the table, facing her.
'So, what happened, that last day?' Dean asked quietly, once the shock of Faith's revelation had worn off. He couldn't understand what had happened to unlock those early memories, but he was still desperate to know what might have torn their little family apart. Faith's voice had taken on a strange quality, as though she had regressed to being a toddler, and she spoke in a way reminiscent of her speech patterns back then. Dean noticed the unfocused look in her eyes and wondered whether she was reliving the scenes as she spoke.
“You need a drink?” He asked, and looked around for the bar. Castiel felt the heat rush to his face. They had just had a moment, hadn’t they? Dean was looking at his mouth, he still had his hand on Castiel’s lower back. He wanted to tell his siblings they were each other’s boyfriend. There had to be something on Dean’s end. He let Dean guide him to the bar, and they ordered drinks, still standing close together. “How you doing?”
“Time with Stevie has made you jaded,” she declared, and sipped from her drink again. He rolled his eyes, and she assessed him again. Had he always been like this? So caustic and sarcastic and ready to put her down? Had she been like it too, before she stumbled across her parents? Why had she ever convinced herself that she could love him? He seemed aware that she was critiquing him in her head.
“I’ll forgive you, so long as you don’t try out for cheerleading.” Castiel deadpanned back. “You seem to have inherited your dancing skills from me.”
She shook her head, but Castiel didn’t press for more information. He carried on trying to soothe her until she was ready to break the moment. But she didn’t, and soon they were just kneeling in their living room in a tight embrace.
“Scared me? No, Dean. I’m not a young boy on the edge of becoming a man. I’m not delicate. I’m a soldier too. I know that love is a large component of this band, but I also know bravery and strength and determination. I see all of those things in you. If you are so willing to risk so much just to have me as your eromenos, then what would you do in battle?”
“I know. But if Alex is the only person I’ve had a crush on, does that mean I’m a lesbian too? One doesn’t cancel the other, does it?”
'That was better than ever,' Castiel sighed blissfully, kissing the nearest bit of Dean's skin he could find.
“They got me good,” Castiel forced himself to continue. “I’ve had people use me in the past, Dean. People who were after my money, or my status. And Meg’s been my friend forever, her parents knew my parents. If she says someone’s a creep, I have no reason not to believe her. She’s been proven right before. Although I guess, looking back, maybe Meg framed them. I don’t know. I don’t know what to believe right now.”
Dean took the chair opposite him at the kitchen table and glared at the table top, and Castiel took the opportunity to drink in Dean’s demeanor, his aura, everything about him. Dean looked up, and their gazes met.
As soon as everything had been eaten, and Junior was given the task of washing up, the rest of their group set about packing up, and Faith approached, watching his scrub the pans in a nearby stream.
Castiel knew that, if Sam and Becky were to walk in at that moment, they would assume that he and Dean were working, researching a case. Obviously, Castiel would have been elected to read up on forgotten lore, while Dean grappled with more recent, technological methods of research.
They were both called over then, by Castiel, and Jack guided her over to them with a hand to the small of her back. She had a moment of concern that one of her dreams would find its way into real life, but it was very different. She was in her real dress, a lot of people were hanging around, taking pictures, and Jack separated from her at the last moment, standing the other side of Dean as Claire stood by her father. And then Jack moved away, out of shot, and Dean and Castiel surrounded Claire, their arms around her, both of them kissing her cheeks or holding close. Sam appeared not long after, encircling them all as he stood at the back, still visible. Jack came back with Eileen for some more pictures, and soon more and more people were joining their little group to pose for pictures - Dean’s extended family, Claire and Castiel’s estranged one, friends, co-workers, Claire lose count. When she was finally free to escape the posed pictures, Patience grabbed her to pose with Kaia and Alex as well, to document the four of them reunited. Jack offered to take the pictures for them, and then pulled his own phone out of a breast pocket.
“Claire? Please wait on the porch,” Castiel said in that placid tone of his, though it still made Claire shiver. She did as he asked, and he closed the door, keeping her out of whatever he had to say to Amelia’s parents. She sat on the porch swing, and wondered just how much everyone had kept from her for the past six years. And then she started thinking of how it used to be, when Castiel had left, when it was just her and her mom, and they visited this house. How they had helped bake cookies and she failed to learn how to knit but liked whittling with her grandfather. How simple and cookie-cutter a life it had seemed.
“Can you open your eyes so I can do the liner?” Alex interrupted her internal panic. She did automatically, and was surprised to see that Alex didn’t look any different to her. Same jet black hair flowing down her back, same warm hazel eyes. She was holding liquid eyeliner and Claire did her best to look where Alex instructed her as she applied the liner. “This looks so much better than the badger eye you always end up doing.”
Castiel nodded. So they were in agreement on that. Although, Castiel felt like this conversation should have earned him some points.
Faith was lost in what she was doing, chasing the vengeful ghosts as they reluctantly retreated from her, climbing higher and higher in the broken down factory as they panicked. She hadn't questioned why a new building could look quite so forlorn, though she fully suspected it was the handiwork of the ghosts. She hadn't questioned anything, until she heard Krissy calling from nearby.
It had been days since they'd experienced their first demon attack, and they had barely moved from the haven they had found in the form of a derelict farmhouse that bore signs of once belonging to a hunter. The reason for the pause in their journey wasn't the threat of more demons, though Dean, Garth and Gabriel took turns in watching outside the house for any enemies. It was because Faith had succumbed to morning sickness, to a level none of them could have anticipated. Dean had set up some blankets for her in the bathroom, and when he wasn't on watch duty, he sat with her, soothing her and helping her when she needed it.
And yet, she hadn’t run. Just like her father had told her. It wasn’t so much that there was anything to stay for, but that there was nowhere to go. And why should she leave? Why shouldn’t she be there every damn day to make Castiel feel guilty for everything he had put his family through? She hoped that every time he looked at her, he remembered the little girl he left behind, the woman who had been so devoted to him that she never let go of the thought he would come back. She wasn’t going to run like he did.
Eventually he released, covering Castiel’s hands and his chest, and he fell forward, hands splayed on the covers as Castiel continued fucking him hard. Finally, Castiel let go, and flopped onto his back, panting hard.
“Now there’s an idea.” Castiel smiled, and felt himself thawing. “Fine. My dad’s the guy by the barbecue with the fire extinguisher, the nervous one. Play nice.”
“Okay, so,” Castiel turned to Claire, pursing his lips for a moment. “Would it be too much for you if Dean stayed over occasionally?”
“The baby books say we won’t know the sex yet,” Becky sounded cautious, like she still didn’t trust Dean’s reaction.
They shared another intense eye conversation and then Dean left the room, beckoning Claire out with him. She followed, and found Alex poring over the Chinese menu. Dean was chuckling.
Claire curled her arms around his waist, and asked something that, until that point, she wouldn’t have felt comfortable with saying. But with what had just happened with Alex, and all the letters she had been reading through, and whatever complications were developing with Dean, it felt relevant.
Dean and Castiel gave him the same appraising look. Gabriel really didn’t seem like the type to like mush.
“I won’t be your dad, I know that. But I’m going to try my best to be the second best option. If you need anything, I’m here. I’ll be the best stepdad ever.”
“That’s stupid. He calls you his future stepdaughter. He’s like a cartoon character around Cas with the heart eyes. Even Jody was like, how long has Dean been with the book shop guy? Because they’re a little married already.”
“It’s okay, Kevin. You have the job.” Castiel swallowed hard. “And Dean and I … we just met. But I like him. I like him very much.”
But Castiel was watching a woman on a pole, and Dean tried to relax. They weren’t together, not like that, and Cas understood him better than he did himself most of the time. So surely he could enjoy the women dancing, and still enjoy his bond with Castiel?
“Castiel, we’ve barely had the pleasure of talking to your new friend. Dean, would you accompany me on the dance floor?”
“I thought you were going to make it hard for me?” He boasted. “Swapping the side you stand on isn’t enough.”
“Yeah. I went to see Sam first, and I just got back. All the kids are out and Mom’s in the kitchen with Mary’s teacher.”
“I thought you wanted to work on this project anyway, not gossip about my dad’s love life and junk.”
“There’s no answer I can give that doesn’t sound empty or condescending or vapid. So I suppose I know that because I want to believe that’s the man he is to charge the sexual fantasies I’m going to be having about him.”
“No, it’s cool.” Claire shrugged. A ride with Dean would have been fun, but she was trying to get rid of the rumours, after what she heard them say the night before. Walking to school and then the double date with Alex that night would help quash the rumours a little bit, at least.
Eventually, the string quartet began to play, as did a pianist, and the other guests began to drift to the dance floor in between the tables and move. It was all antiquated dances, ballroom steps from people who wanted to show off the lessons they had in their youth. Dean and Castiel remained sitting at the table. Castiel refilled their wine glasses with water as Dean turned to watch those on the dance floor.
“Shame the longest you’ve been with anyone is two dates,” Balthazar laughed. “And you look nothing like Sam’s girlfriend.”
It still felt surreal, that he had a husband. That he had married a stranger three days ago and changed his life so entirely. And yet … it didn’t feel right, living without Castiel. Which brought him back to wanting to be off the plane.
Castiel glared up at Gabriel, who smiled back endearingly, tipping his own martini glass towards Castiel as though he hadn’t just divulged details about the younger angel’s sex life.
“You know what, Cas? I hope you’re happy with her. I really hope you are. I hope you enjoy all those boring networking events together. And I hope that you remember that however much you spent on me, you still couldn’t buy a friend. Four million dollars, and you’re in the same place you always were.”
'Uh-huh, considering.' She gestured to her swollen stomach, that Garth and Gabriel had spent the previous day trying to measure so they could compare to a human pregnancy. She had felt like a piece of meat in their hands, hating the way the pregnancy took away her privacy. Everyone wanted to grab at her, to listen to the baby or feel it kick. Dean had only intervened when Garth had muttered something about an 'internal examination' which Faith was pretty sure she would never want to experience.
Claire sat back in her chair, and just hoped that Alex would back up her story. Alex’s gaze darted up to Ms Harvelle’s face.
“You lied to me,” Faith told Gabriel as they set off from the camp site. Her father and uncle were ahead of them, leading the way, and Castiel was by her side, Junior and Garth walking behind and talking between themselves as well. Gabriel smirked back at her.
He wasn’t used to this sensation. Yes, he had dated before, but always out of expectation or experimentation. His mother and father had tried to set him up with some eligible women, he had met a couple of girls at college. But time and again he had been used, or unable to go further than hand holding. Even the first guy he had been interested in turned out to be more interested in the name Novak than who Castiel was. But even he didn’t set Castiel’s heart racing, his palms sweating, his breath hitching the way that this guy did. He already knew from watching their progress that Brother had a great ass.
Gabriel sat up again, looking at Castiel, and he was finally able to free himself from his brother. He slid off the seat and walked out of the room, thankful that they didn’t try and call him back, didn’t stop him from leaving. He supposed that they too had been listening to Michael for once.
“Talking of weird,” Claire stepped closer into the room, and closed the door behind her. “What was going on at the end of that trial thing?”
“The thing is Kaia, I don’t know for sure if I like him,” she kept her voice low. “I keep getting these dreams, and they have me convinced I do, but I haven’t really felt this way before. But I want to be happy for Patience, you know?”
Castiel beamed, glad that Dean’s sense of humour was back. He sipped his water as Dean began to eat, exclaiming loudly over the taste of the food. When the second course came along, Gabriel pushed four plates towards Dean and winked as Balthazar pulled out a bottle of Cognac. At least his exuberant brothers would make this interesting. And they were feeding Dean’s good mood. Dean arranged all the plates between them and started picking through, gesturing for Castiel to do the same.
“The baby. She’s right, I was ready to catch the baby, to help it out, and then everything bleached out to this white light. Something’s happened, or gone wrong. Did you kill Stevie?”
“Can we not talk about that?” Claire whispered, as her salted caramel banana and his peanut butter chocolate shakes appeared, along with a slice of coconut cream. Jack unwrapped his fork from his napkin and nodded.
Kelly left two days after Sam and Eileen’s visit. Claire waved her off with Jack, knowing that as soon as her car disappeared from view, things would become awkward, and she would have to try and figure out some way of getting through the rest of the time that her fathers were away.
His father stooped down into his line of vision, smiling in that dopey way that Junior associated with total trust.
'Sure thing, kiddo. You can be the one to tell him to shove it up his ass this time, rather than passing the message through me.' Gabriel looked at Castiel. 'See you later, little bro.'
“I don’t either. But I think with his new powers, and the wedding planning and everything … maybe he’s just not ready for us right now.”
She finally started thinking about Dax, about the gangly, nerdy boy who was locked in the basement, alone and away from the only person he'd really spent any time with over the last eleven years. The boy who lived for books, and comic references, and bow ties worn with short-sleeved, pattern shirts. Who pushed his thick-framed glasses up his nose constantly, and twirled his thick fringe whenever he thought deeply. Whatever else he was, he was her best friend, her makeshift family. She needed to talk to him, just the two of them, like he'd been asking for when he was dragged down there. She just had to be smart about it, so she didn't get hurt, so Dean didn't get mad, so Dax wasn't offended. If nothing else, she had to tell him her mission from the angels, and why she was putting her mother first.
In the few brief windows when they weren’t laying together, or watching the scrying pool, Castiel would show him more of his world. Dean soon learned that Castiel was friendly with his father’s bees, and not only knew all their names but would talk to them. They seemed to respond, though Dean had no clue if it was just coincidence.
He pressed his lips together tightly, but knew there was no point in arguing further. Obviously, Faith's fear was coming out in the wrong kind of sentiment, and Dax knew the best way to avoid her insulting him further was to just dodge the bullet and leave it the hell alone. He climbed out of the camper first, offering her his arm so she knew he wasn't mad at her, and she took it with an air of indifference, though her fingernails dug into his arm and Dax knew she was petrified to be out, seemingly in the middle of nowhere, about to ask a stranger to stay in their hillside place. Of course, Faith had way too much pride to ever admit she was afraid of anything, but Dax had known her for far too long to buy that level of grade A manure.
Dean gave Castiel a short run-through of all the things they had tried, as Faith groaned quietly on Dean's lap. Castiel patted her legs awkwardly, knowing it wasn't good enough to remove the churning sensation in her stomach.
She flushed the toilet, despite not using it, and washed her hands, before emerging from the bathroom. They were no longer making out, and from the way they were looking at the TV you would never think they were, though Castiel still had his hand on Dean’s thigh. She crashed back onto the armchair and looked at the TV, letting the peace settle again. They were near the climax of the movie when she finally broke the moment.
“Still, I mean, I’m going to be a feature in your life, and Cas has made it so clear you’re a package deal. So we should have a friendship on top of that. Beyond me being your principal.”
“Charlie?” Jody and Sam whipped around too, staring at Castiel’s assistant. She was staring at them too.
'No, you would wear them. And accessorise with polka dot leggings and bright pink tutu's. I'm sure we have pictures somewhere, right Dean?'
Mary - Dean’s mother - had taken them all in without question, without much fuss. She insisted that they had all come to find the rest of their family, and she was Sam and Dean’s family, so they all counted as far as she was concerned. And yet, Sam had already moved in with Eileen by then, and somehow Dean was left acting like another father figure to half-siblings he never asked for. It had taken him a while to convince his mother that he needed some alone time. He suspected she forgot often that he wasn’t her other half, her partner in all things child-rearing. It was one thing to be the responsible older brother to Sam, it was another one to suddenly find himself pseudo parent to brothers and sisters he hadn’t had the chance to get used to.
'Guess it's time for bed? We should take it in turns to watch over Junior though, in case he wakes up.'
Dean scrambled off the bed and into the bathroom. Castiel started the water flow, and Dean pushed him under the spray, climbing in as well and grabbing the shower gel. He took his time lathering Castiel up, and Castiel did the same to him, his touch tender and full of care. They rinsed and stepped out of the shower together. Dean grabbed his towel and dried himself off, before passing it to Castiel. As Castiel dried himself, Dean retrieved his clothes and pulled them on. They dressed in silence, and headed back to Jody’s clasping hands tightly.
“Okay. We’re going to be in my room. Don’t burn down the house.” Claire announced. Alex picked up the stack of homework and her drink, and Claire took her mug and the blanket as they walked across the apartment to her room. She shut the door and watched Alex arrange the homework on her desk. She threw the blanket on the bed and tentatively slid her hand into Alex’s, which was cool to touch. Alex looked over her shoulder and smiled, before turning around and leaning against the desk chair.
'What about how absent you've been for the past decade, Cas? What about the night Faith shows up is the first time for a while that you even touched me?'
He found Dean in the bunker, in their bedroom, laying on the bed. His eyes were closed, as though he were sleeping, and his body was straight, rigid, although his hands clasped his chest, just by his heart. Castiel reached out for him, but stopped before touching. There was a heat coming from Dean that should have incinerated his body, and burned down the rest of the bunker. As Castiel watched, a light appeared as though underneath Dean. It spread out like liquid, small tendrils of beams working their way out and then around him, forming a cage around him. When he was fully surrounded, the light burned brighter, until even Castiel needed to look away, and then it extinguished itself, leaving a hardened cage in its place. It looked like patterned glass, but was soft to touch. Castiel could see Dean through the casing, but couldn’t get through to him. He still looked as though he was asleep, and Castiel wondered what was going on in his strange cage. Was Dean okay?
“My favourite cousin.” She agreed, and leaned closer to hug Jack. But she mistimed it, or had the position wrong, because their lips connected and fireworks went off in her brain. She closed her eyes as she leaned into the kiss, feeling his hands pulling her closer, their lips working together, the fact they were related not stopping either of them. Claire felt charged up in a way she had never been before, and though kissing Jack was nice, it wasn’t enough. She shifted on the bed, straddling him, and his hands roamed over her body, pushing her top off. She let it happen, trying to taste as much of him as she could, gyrating against him, needing some friction between them. They rolled over on the bed, clothes disappearing as they did, and Claire would give him everything, Jack was everything-
Castiel looked at the floor. Did Dean mean those words? Then why had he been so awful the last few times they had seen each other? He was the one blanking Castiel.
“Sure,” Dean nodded. They left the building, and headed for the shore, walking slowly together. The sun didn’t heat Dean’s shoulders with the same intensity as it did on Olympus, and the smell of salt water from the sea wasn’t as pungent as the world he knew now, but he liked Sam and Gabriel’s island nonetheless. They fell into an easy stride together, their sandals making the same imprints on the sand, and Dean realised that his younger brother was taller than him, easily as tall as the nearby olive trees. They hadn’t spoken since leaving the house.
“Dean, that’s not fair and you know it. The kids aren’t here and he’s not staying the night. And it’s been seven years since I lost John. I don’t have to get your approval.”
“If I had my way, I would have had you regularly the last six years, staying over at the weekends, some holidays. And you would have had more time to adjust to the idea of Dean in my life, and … yeah, I’d want to make a life with him.”
“I’m learning.” He swallowed the mouthful. “I watched that show with the horse guy and his ace friend. I heard Sherlock was written as ace. I’ve looked into it. Try me.”
“I don’t. These are Balth’s. He gave me the top as well. I thought maybe it would make you more comfortable if I wasn’t dressed up.”
“Where’s Grace?” She repeated. “I know I didn’t have her for long, but I did think I was going to be having a baby.”
“See?” Charlie gestured at Claire. She didn’t even smile. “Uh-oh. Teen drama? I’ll grab us both a latte and we’ll gossip while Cas does the whole overbearing father thing. Sound good?”
“It turns out that while you were trying to buy my friendship, I actually made some real ones in your brothers.”
“How about a brother with prophetic dreams and visions?” Dean propped himself on his elbows. “You should have seen him when he met his girlfriend, he started babbling about how he had seen her for a year before they met, went into the whole spiel … and she signed back at him. Completely deaf, but great at lip-reading. They’re cute together. And now I feel weird for talking about Sam when I’m in bed with my hot husband.”
“What, because I had that stupid isolation thing? That wasn’t my fault. I think Dean was trying to show he wasn’t playing favourites or something.”
One turned black and ran off, and the others turned grey, wincing as they began to lay eggs, and Dean wasn’t able to make any more sound with his laughter. The strain of laying an egg on Castiel’s face was, quite possibly, even funnier than Castiel dressed as a flapper girl.
“I didn’t say it wasn’t true.” Dean said eventually, sounding much more like his old self, if a little wary of where this conversation was going. “You are different. Important. You know that.”
Dean looked up, and into the eyes of his little brother. He would have expected Sam to adhere to protocol, but no, Sam came flying out of the house, flinging himself on Dean, who fell over on the impact.
What was Michael trying to hint at, that Castiel had no taste? That Dean wasn’t as good-looking as he could be? His brothers could be awful even when they thought they were helping.
“Not your mom?” Alex actually seemed concerned. But Claire wasn’t prepared to talk about her mom with the stuck up cheerleader in front of her, so she returned to her meal and tried to pretend Alex didn’t exist. But Alex didn’t take the hint, instead sitting there and chattering away, and waving at their English teacher when he walked in.
“It’s just one night. One more obligation down, right?” Dean’s voice was soft, and Castiel appreciated hearing the change in tone so much. Maybe he was overthinking everything, as per usual.
On the screen, Castiel was squinting at the screen, as though he wasn’t sure it was working correctly, before he began speaking in his usual gravelly voice. Dean had no idea where Castiel was meant to be filming the video.
“Do we all have to move out if we want to have sex?” Ben stuck in. “Sam moved out to have sex with Eileen.”
Dax coloured, and looked at the stack of books as though that would have some magic answer that he could give to stop them having that conversation. It wasn't that he and Faith were never affectionate with each other, but they'd never been
“How did you meet him?” Castiel tried to deflect Michael’s meddling. Michael steepled his fingers and leaned on his desk.
They had agreed early on in their newly-reinstated relationship that should Castiel feel an anxiety attack coming on he would give a simple signal and Dean would step in to help. It was something Castiel could do even as the panic took over, something Dean had noticed in the very early days of knowing each other. Castiel merely had to look at the floor, standing completely still, for a count of five and Dean would try to ease him out of the attack. Even if they were arguing, Dean had promised it would come first, though they were yet to have an argument since getting back together.
Faith wanted to kid herself that it was the baby telling her that silently, but she knew it coming from her own conscious. She really wasn't ready to deal with that.
'We'll do what we need to do. Whatever's going on with Castiel, he's usually good at being compassionate. Sometimes you just have to nudge him into the right direction a little, that's all.'
She flopped back down on the bed, holding her head in her hands. She wanted to go back to sleep, but what if she went right back to the dream? What if she didn’t? Would it go away?
Castiel’s eyes seemed to fill with emotion, and he bent closer once more, pressing a kiss onto Dean’s mouth. This one went deeper, as he nibbled at Dean’s lip, sucking slightly, probing his tongue along Dean’s teeth and into his mouth. He groaned, and pulled Castiel closer, his hips already bucking up as he crushed Castiel’s chest against his own. He felt his robes rucking up, and slid his hands under Castiel’s, sliding a hand up his thigh and tracing his butt cheek with his palm. A shudder ran through his eromenos, and he threw his leg over Dean, straddling him, grinding against him.
Castiel stood, placing the full glass on the table and taking Dean's hand again he led him out of the house. Dean spluttered with indignation as the front door shut and they found themselves back in the kitchen of the house they'd been hiding in.
'Yes. And we were close too, I promise.' Castiel kissed her forehead again. 'Faith, we can't change the last fifteen years, but we can rebuild. I know you're going to still doubt whether or not you trust us, and I think I understand that, but we're going to protect you either way.'
“Yes, Lady Antonia Bevell will be showcasing her pottery and we’re going to have to pretend we like it because she’s donated a huge amount to daddy’s campaign.”
That was the point, every time, where Dean would break down into sobs so affected that his entire body shook with the efforts until he finally dozed off. He knew he was pathetic, he knew he was putting too much onto Castiel, and onto Sam who had been forced to adopt the role of taking care of him. Dean knew how low he had sunk, and yet he couldn't pull himself out of the routine, out of the drunken stupor.
“That’s why they underestimate us,” he conceded. They fell back into silence, and Castiel continued to clean him, before helping him back into his linothorax. Once dressed, Dean bestowed a sweet, soft kiss onto Castiel’s lips, and then rested his forehead against his beloved’s.
All too soon, it was time for Dean to return to his home in Kansas. Castiel and Emmanuel had taken him to the airport, and Castiel was trying to work out how to say goodbye. Emmanuel stood back, giving them some time to themselves.
“Nah, we struck a deal. Claire looked after the rings and Sam gets the speech,” Dean grinned. “Besides, I don’t think there’s any dirt to have on Cas. It’s just my shame that’ll get out. Glad I have some students here.”
Castiel nodded, and Claire was just glad that they waited until she was on the stairwell outside of the apartment before they carried on their game of Find Dean’s Engagement Ring. Claire knew her father’s pockets would be the last place he would check. But she was strangely okay with it, as much as she was okay that Castiel had referred to her as Dean’s kid too. It was just the way their strange little family worked. She was just going to have to try to take their advice when it came to Alex, and hope for the best
So many distant aunts and uncles were due to come, and Claire didn’t remember any of them even as they mentioned how she had grown up on seeing her. Dean’s side of the family had fewer official members, but many more adoptive family members, meaning that there was a lot of laughter and introductions and stories about how they were entwined. Claire heard snatches and snippets as she went around doing her duties, trying to make her father proud.
It felt like a stab in the heart, and Castiel physically jerked in reaction. Was that Dean’s way of telling him to get lost? Or did he just not realise … Castiel laid it all bare.
“He gave me his number. Dean asked if I was okay, then got a new server. Never tell him, but he’s a pretty good guy. Dean, I mean.”
“So how does it work?” Kaia asked once they were all focused on their painting. Even Dean. “The ace thing, with you two dating,” Kaia’s paint brush pointed between Claire and Alex, threatening to drip green paint on Castiel’s table.
They continued marching all day, and reached the mountains circling Athens just as night fell. They scattered on the mountainside, finding places to sleep, the Sacred Band sticking together as they curled up in their pairs. Dean could feel the eyes of the rest of the Theban army on them, but he didn’t care. And likewise, though there might have been tensions and petty squabbles amongst the soldiers, when it came to warfare they were a tight unit. Whatever Dean had said to the other soldiers back at base camp that morning in his frustration, he would always defend them too. Castiel first, and then the band. Who wanted to feel responsible for a soldier losing his partner? And so they all found a spot where they could sit in concentric circles, looking out along the valley and mountainside for danger, arranging a quick look out schedule. Dean and Castiel were second on the list, and decided not to sleep as they waited for their turn. Instead, they star-gazed.
“No, no, you take your time flirting with the guy who broke your heart and ignoring the entire plan for tonight. I’m fine.”
There wasn’t anyone. It was times like this where she needed her mom. Amelia would have listened, she wouldn’t have judged. Claire tried to imagine what her mother would say at this point, but it had been so long since she had thought of her, the voice wasn’t there anymore.
“Do you want to invite Alex over as well? She knows about Dean and I, and it might even the playing field a little?”
'No, I didn't screw your daughter for this baby. God told me to go talk to her, and he would give her the baby in that conversation. Dean, I love Faith to bits, but I'm not a pervy old man.'
'We should tell her now,' Dean eventually muttered. 'She's probably sick of being kept in the dark about everything.'
Sam’s expression told her he didn’t believe her, but as he had no proof of what did happen, he didn’t accuse her of anything. Instead, he pulled his cell phone out of his pocket, and called for an ambulance, then called Dean and quickly let him know where Claire was. Castiel and Jack came running in a couple of minutes later, and Jack’s face falling was the worst moment about the whole thing.
“Dean’s husband. Castiel, perhaps you could wait for Dean in the basement? There’s a TV down there.”
“Cool, see you then!” Dean smiled, and tapped Claire’s math book. “It’s not as hard as you think. If your problems aren’t picked by prime numbers, the answers will go in that pattern. I never told you that.”
“Whatever.” She gave him another hug, and a small kiss on the cheek, before dancing off to pester Castiel. Alfie was the next sibling to approach, and he stepped straight into his hug.
“It never seems bad when you’re here,” Castiel admitted, before he could filter himself. Amara appeared before them, looking down at Dean with interest sparkling in her eyes. Castiel waited for her to sell him out.
“What are you doing? I was sitting here, enjoying my food, and then you came all up in my business.”
But despite Michael’s reassurances, the conversation that made him feel more human again came from the strangest source. Balthazar. He had come crashing along onto Castiel’s dune with a couple of cocktail glasses in hand, one which he pressed on Castiel straight away.
“Okay. I don’t like the idea of sending you to Moira and Franklin either. But I do expect you to try with him.”
'We are in the most densely populated city in the United States, and we are looking for one person in amongst over eight million. I'd say our options are limited at best.'
There was one time when he was in the gallery during opening hours where he didn’t have the chance to hide, and it would have looked strange if he attempted to do so. He was evaluating a painting by another artist, one who hadn’t quite decided on their technique but had been nominated for this award, when voices started up not far behind him.
“Am I meant to say something about gambling?” Dean asked. “Like, parenting, blahblahblah addiction?”
“I’ve apologised already. I know I shouldn’t have done it. But I do not regret it. You won’t make me say that.”
“Chuck?” Sam said gently. “I know you’re busy, and Grace is busy, but … I mean, I’m a little thrown. We were meant to help Faith have this baby, and get rid of the antichrist kids. We’ve done that. So now what happens? I mean, are we going back to the bunker? Do we have to stay here in Bethlehem? What are we doing right now?”
“I worked it out when you were in hospital, and then something Ellen said she overhead confirmed it. I figured you had your reasons for not saying anything.”
Castiel went into a full anxiety attack, and froze to the spot. Michael mentioned the magazine article. Had he laughed about Castiel’s fixation and begged Dean to go out with him, to play along with Castiel’s awkwardness but eventually agree? Was this a set up?
They didn’t linger with foreplay, Dean clearly needing the closeness as much as Castiel did. He hooked his hands underneath Castiel’s hips and pulled him up, before beginning to thrust into Castiel, taking it slowly so there was no chafing. Castiel strained to get some lube to materialise, to ease them along. When Dean felt it slick along the tip of his penis, he stopped being so gentle, bracing himself above Castiel as they crashed together, over and over. Time seemed to slip away, the sun set and the stars came out, and still, Castiel and Dean moved together, stuck in each other, lost to the rest of the world while they existed in this moment. Eventually, Dean tired, and collapsed onto Castiel, teasing the locks of his hair between his fingertips. Castiel lay underneath his welcome weight, and embraced every molecule of their beings that touched.
Eventually, their kisses petered out, and Castiel lay back on the cushions beside Dean, closing his eyes and tilting his head in the direction of the sunbeam they were laying in. Dean sat up slightly, propping his head up as he leaned towards Castiel.
“So, what do you think, Claire? Dean? I didn’t want to give Jack an answer without including you in the decision, but last night wasn’t right to do that when the girls were over.”
“Yes. Of course. She’s my best friend. But she broke up with me, Jody. She made me keep it quiet that she got kicked off the squad and then it’s my fault she got punished because the teachers still thought she was part of it.” She folded her arms. “It doesn’t make sense to me.”
'Dax is a fan of Edlund Carver, and the Ghostfacer boys.' She deadpanned. The corner's of Sam's mouth turned down as he nodded, and looked at Dax again, making Dax feel uncomfortable as Sam's eyes swept over him, summing him up.
'Faith!' Dax sounded horrified, but Dean laughed, forcing himself to look around at her. It was a bitter, forced laugh, designed to drive the point home to the forth-right teenager.
Dean stared at him for a moment that felt like it lasted forever. His eyes darted back and forth like he was trying to read the lie in Castiel’s words, and Castiel couldn’t help himself. Dean wasn’t in cahoots with Michael, they were both resisting each other for absolutely no reason. He threw himself at Dean, at the same time that the artist moved closer, and they were kissing once more, sinking slowly to the floor, fitting between artwork and equipment and losing themselves in each other. Castiel’s heart was thudding so hard in his chest he could feel it throughout his body, he could feel Dean’s heartbeat keeping time too. The kisses were as sweet as they had been in the limousine, with just the right balance of caution and urgency, the right amount of tongue, little nips that sent thrills throughout Castiel’s body.
There were a couple of gasps around the room, as though Dean had admitted something huge. He carried on before Sam could ask anything else.
“I didn’t want it, I swear,” Castiel kept his eyes firmly closed, his face buried in the pillow, as though by not actually watching Dean’s face, he could stop it from hurting so much. But he could still see Dean’s expression, could feel him warring between confusion and compassion and a hint of frustration. He answered the question on the tip of Dean’s tongue, throwing the words out as though he could get them as far away from himself as possible. “They summoned me back to Heaven. They gave it back.”
“So he was trying to undermine your relationship, and when that didn’t work, he got Meg involved. I suppose he offered her a cut of all our money if she helped. They used the trust you give her to manipulate the circumstances, but Luke was gunning for all of us.”
“You’ve brainwashed her,” Claire’s grandmother accused as she followed them through the house. “You took her away from her home and you brainwashed her.”
“Okay. Well, I’ll take you back to the motel, and give you some space. Girlfriend or not, you shouldn’t leave it in a bad place.”
'Please don't,' Sam sighed, rubbing his face. 'I don't want to wake up in the morning next to one of the annoying ones.'
And the car, the beloved Impala that had appeared in Dean’s article, that had towed the statue of his mother to the Novak’s estate? It was as well cared for inside as it was outside. The leather upholstery looked as good as new, the dashboard looked like it was well preserved. This car had been given a lot of love and attention. It purred under Dean’s control, like it loved the driver as much as he loved it. But like his artwork, Dean didn’t talk endlessly about his car, his love for it was evident in the way he had kept it pristine, the looks he gave it as they climbed in, the way he seemed to become part of the car. Dean did indeed love fast and hard.
“Castiel! You came! Is this a sign of the coming apocalypse?” He sneered at Dean, who he must have recognised. Castiel’s brothers had spent enough time in the last few months talking to Dean’s face on the front of Time when they wanted Castiel’s attention. “And you brought a friend who isn’t Meg Masters. Interesting.”
Although, he considered as reality crashed in, it really wouldn’t matter. The guy could be straight with ten kids, or dating this Benny; nothing would change if Castiel couldn’t even approach him. And he was so, so beautiful, Castiel couldn’t imagine keeping his head enough to talk to the guy, to flirt with him. Drooling in front of him wasn’t an attractive prospect. He wished he could be confident like any one of his brothers, instead of hiding behind a preserved, excavated horse. But he didn’t know how, couldn’t motivate himself to do anything, so he resolved to get over Brother.
“Well, when you’re ready to try him again, it’ll go through.” Michael didn’t seem upset by Castiel’s silence.
“Dad?” Castiel interrupted quietly. Both Chuck and Gabriel turned together, and their gaze immediately fell to Dean. “This is Dean, the man I met in Vegas.”
Faith didn't answer him straight away, instead she ran her thumbs across the worn paper clipping, smoothing the torn edges.
“You are. And I know that’s half the reason Dean worries so much about you. He thinks we’re cursed, he never wanted to pass that on to his kids.”
“But you were drunk?” Mary persisted. They traded another look, and Dean debated how much they were going to confess to his mother. Castiel seemed to be asking how much he would want to reveal.
'And powerful. I think we should try one of the others.' Sam spoke up. Castiel shot a quick look at Faith, before turning his attention back to Sam.
“I didn’t say your name, you’re safe,” Benny replied a little louder. But then their footsteps started, and they left the room before Castiel turned, watching their retreating backs, the way Dean curled towards his friend to whisper in his ear, a hand on his shoulder. Benny’s body tensed, but he listened anyway, and Castiel focused back on the painting. He couldn’t enjoy it after Dean’s succinct evaluation. Or maybe it was after seeing their uneven relationship up close.
He bent over and kissed her cheek softly before walking away. Claire walked into the room, and then stood behind her door, touching the spot Jack had kissed. Was that just a cousin thing? Did he somehow know about her crush? Or could it be that he felt it too?
“So, the wedding’s in a couple of minutes?” Dean’s tone was that flat one again, the one which wouldn’t betray his thoughts or feelings. Castiel hadn’t given him any information about the wedding, but he supposed with Michael around, he didn’t need to.
They both stopped watching the movie, looking at each other instead. Those lust-filled gazes doing all the communicating, before they both leaned closer and kissed. Castiel’s hand crept over to Dean’s thigh, and she could almost see how much they were restraining themselves. They both wanted more. Claire had no idea why Dean had thought it was a good idea to come over when clearly if they had stuck to their original plan then they would be having sex and Claire would be ignorant of that fact.
“Me too. I’m sure there’ll be some new gossip at some point, something that’s more interesting than the principal and a sophomore. Maybe they’ll hear that Bobby does Riverdance.”
“It’s stupid, isn’t it? They’ve known you your whole life, and they know you want to be with your dad, so you would think to keep that connection they’d swallow their opinion and put up with it to see you.”
“I guess it’s your party,” Claire acknowledged. He grinned at her, and she stole his egg roll out of his hand.
“Is everything okay?” Jody asked, as the server returned with the appetisers. Instead of making use of Dean’s vacated seat, he again pressed between Claire and Castiel to serve. Claire nodded, and leaned closer to Alex, taking her hand again.
Dean looked at Faith for a moment, who shrugged back at him. He closed his eyes, and squeezed the bridge of his nose.
“Claire? I’m used to fifteen year olds. Side effect of teaching. And it’s not been easy to hear those things for me either. Like, do I have to stop seeing Cas to shut them up? Do I quit teaching? Do we come out even though it’s early days? Do we stop having to hang out? Because I want us to have a relationship too. Not like that, like-”
Claire made herself wipe and pull her underwear and jeans up, leaving the stall to wash her hands and prayed she wasn’t shaking.
Gabriel and Castiel began talking about Castiel’s duties, and how Dean had been helping out, and Sam gave his older brother a small squeeze.
Dean returned home calmer than he was when he had left. Bobby, his boss, had been understanding, though he hadn’t told Bobby everything. The house was once again quiet when he walked in, though when he went looking he found his mother in the kitchen, sipping a cup of coffee.
It wasn’t what he wanted to be doing, but he felt indebted to Michael, who had been nothing but understanding since the marriage started to fold, who had given without any expectation of getting anything back. It wasn’t like Michael particularly wanted to be doing any of it either, but he felt a sense of duty. Castiel felt like he had to earn his way now, that maybe by participating more in family affairs he would actually be entitled to any money he had. Although Michael was still trying to get it back for him, he wasn’t too worried about getting his old fortune back.
Everyone waited, but Chuck never mentioned whether Bess would also be joining them in Heaven. Instead, he clapped his hands together.
They eventually stopped at an orchard, though the trees were only just blossoming and no one else was around. They sat side-by-side under a tree and tucked into their snacks happily, talking the whole time about their childhoods and the things they’d lived through since they had last been together.
They were interrupted by a large voice, who seemed to draw all the attention towards them. Castiel saw the man approaching and groaned. He was an old business associate of his fathers, one who the late Mr Novak tended to distance himself from rather hastily. He was the worst for boasts of grandeur. Dean stepped away from Castiel slightly as they were accosted.
Alex caressed her arm with an open hand, and goose pimples immediately erupted as Claire’s breathing became shallow. Alex was pressing closer and Claire had another out of body experience, feeling like she was watching this happening to someone else from their perspective, even as her skin tingled at Alex’s proximity. She tried to give herself a pep talk, to remind herself that Alex was her girlfriend now, that Alex knew this was all new to her and she wouldn’t push her boundaries. They had already kissed a few times, and it had gone well each time, so why was she feeling panicked? Especially as Alex didn’t seem to want to do more than just hug. She didn’t seem to notice Claire’s internal conflict, however.
It was the Prada jacket. Dean had been wearing Prada. Either he had bought it himself, or far more likely, Michael had given it to him. It told Castiel all he needed to know.
“It’s probably wisest, Dean. Want some bacon?” Castiel ran a hand through Dean’s hair for a moment, and then got busy at the stove, cooking breakfast.
Castiel wondered briefly if Dean was a misogynist, but then he saw Charlie’s eye roll and realised it was just sibling teasing. Or at least, he hoped. He drew his shoulders up, and tried to tamp down the anxiety of telling Charlie who he was. He focused on Dean.
“Of course I do, Clarence. You don’t get handled like a piece of meat. But Daddy and his friends are here, he wants to make good with the Senate, so if you could get over yourself for one day it would really help. You don’t have to like anyone, you don’t have to enjoy the conversation. Just fake it ’til you make it.”
“I know. I guess I just wish we could fast forward a few months to where she’s more comfortable and we can do stuff as a three, you know?”
Dean sat in his airline seat, for once not panicking about his phobia of flying. His mind was with Castiel.
“What do you mean, aces?” Alex frowned. Claire pulled out her cell phone discreetly, logged in and showed Alex a web page she had saved. Alex read with the phone wedged behind the book, and then returned the phone when she was done. “I wasn’t trying to sleep with you.”
Dean sounded so resigned, and Castiel felt his heart thrumming in his chest. He closed his fingers around Dean’s wrist, trying to be reassuring.
Dean tried to look up, not seeing the halo as it moved with him. He crashed onto the pillows, and Castiel burst out laughing at the sight of Dean craning his neck to get a decent view. And then he couldn’t help himself, zapping on top of Dean and embracing him properly, feeling Dean’s wing caressing his own, sending shivers down his spine.
Edith was talking about the upcoming award she had arranged. It was in its fourth year, but it had already become prestigious in the art world. The winners had become successful and world renown. Castiel loved that end of being on the board, knowing that he had a hand in making someone’s life better. He wasn’t boastful about it, but he had voted for every winner so far. He just hadn’t nominated a winner yet.
“Okay, okay, no more teasing?” Dean spoke softly, but then he was moving, pulling off his clothes, revealing a glorious expanse of tan skin before he tugged at Castiel’s shirt and pants, and pausing for a moment once they were both completely naked. “Mmmm, there’s nothing like a dark forest of chest hair, or olive skin in Maine, or-”
She reached the gazebo, and realised that she hadn’t been paying attention to her surroundings. She could see the diner from where she was, saw Sam sitting at the counter with a stack of papers to one side, and a plate on the other, talking with Eileen as she wiped the countertop clean. Claire leaned against the side of the gazebo and watched them for a while, as Eileen gave a big smile and signed something quickly, and Sam stood up, leaning across the counter easily with his height and giving her a kiss on the cheek. Claire smiled at the scene, at how happy they were together.
Sam closed the door on him, and he had no choice but to return to the car, and Kevin. They climbed back in, and Castiel scooted close by the partition.
'Because you're so timid. Relax, okay? No one's going to eat your heart out. And hey, while we're here, we can have proper Philly cheesesteaks.'
Everyone started laughing, even Dean, even Bobby. Claire leaned back against her father’s legs, and felt at peace for the first time in a while. Even with the Alex drama, it had been a long time since she was in a group of people, just listening to stories and feeling a part of the group rather than an outsider. And it was nice to hear that Bobby didn’t limit just calling students idjits, Dean and Sam got it too.
It took a few weeks after they returned home for Castiel to muster the courage to go to Dean’s house. His phone had been unlocked, sure, but this needed more than a text. And what could he really type? It didn’t feel like enough of an effort. And he had to show Dean the kind of effort he was making. He had let his brothers dress him, because apparently his usual suit was too intimidating for a working stiff like Dean. But they hadn’t strayed too far from what he found comfortable, and had ended up in one of Gabriel’s tamer shirts and a pair of slacks. He had gone alone to Dean’s house, not allowing himself a safety net, or a way of backing out. He wanted to have to make more of an effort to leave than he would need to have to stay.
Their breathing was becoming laboured, but neither of them made a move to separate. Maybe this would be how they were found, desperately clinging to each other and determined not to stop kissing. Because when this kiss stopped, Castiel wasn’t sure what could happen. He didn’t think there could be a world past Dean’s mouth against his, their bodies pressed together so tightly.
Faith was gulping down large breaths of air, trying to process what had just happened. She had been sulking while Garth and Junior cooked, listening to her father worry about her, when something had caught her attention nearby. Like someone had whispered her name. She had looked, and sworn she could see Dax - but it was too unlikely, it was just wishful thinking - and then Stevie had appeared out of nowhere and attacked Junior.
Claire pushed open the door to the apartment, and the other girls filtered in, and then stopped, all three of them staring at the same point in the living area. Claire looked also, and saw her father sitting opposite a guy who couldn’t have been older than nineteen. His eyes darted between Claire and her father, and Castiel pursed his lips for a moment.
Dean looked back at the girl snuggled in his bed rather than bite out an answer. He knew arguing over God with Castiel was pointless.
“Castiel!” Gabriel’s voice punctured the air, and Castiel felt the panic rise further. Not them, not after that interaction with Michael. It was too much. “Balth, he came! I told you he would, even if Meg’s gone away for the weekend. And who’s this hot piece of ass?”
They both looked across the room, where Mr Ketch was dancing with the younger Mary, her feet propped on hers.
Aristaeus finished talking, smiling that indulgent smile as though Dean knew the rest of the story, as though it explained everything.
“Hey.” She gave a brief smile, and then threw her arms around him. He hugged her back, feeling surprised. “I’m gonna miss you, Dean.”
Castiel was only slightly taken aback. Dean hadn’t really mentioned much about his family, except for his psychic brother; in the few days they had known each other. And yet, he wanted to see it very much, to know his husband even better.
“Any other person would use that as a line, you know that, right?” Alex smirked up at her. Claire rolled her eyes.
That evening, it was just Claire, Castiel and Dean. They sat down to a dinner that Dean and Claire had cooked together while Castiel closed up the store, the three of them practically inhaling the tacos and nachos that covered the table top.
'Listen, um, we don't need to read these,' Sam informed her, lifting the heavy stack slightly. 'We know the stories.'
“There’s nothing you could have done, Sam. The first time Azazel fed you his blood, it started warping your soul. It took me a long time to get used to how it looked, to see past it to the good behind the damage. I didn’t quite realise … I should have known … whenever I’ve become human, it’s been easier to see the real you, I stopped seeing how the demon blood ruined you. Even when I have my powers back, I don’t see it any more.” Castiel shot a sideways look at Dean, but he knew already that he was allowed to carry on. “I should have warned Dean, prepared him for it. That’s my fault.”
“Like what?” Claire leaned back, her head settling against the arm rest. “I do anything and it’s a cover for boning Dean. No one’s going to listen. And what am I going to do, sell out my dad?”
He pulled up behind the bookstore and Claire grabbed her school bag as Dean grabbed his files, and they made their way into the bookstore to say hello to Castiel. He kissed Claire on the top of her head, and smiled at Dean, before turning to a customer. Charlie chatted to Dean for a while, and Claire went up to the apartment to finish reading the pages Sam had assigned.
for the chance to see his father. And now Castiel was the favoured angel, the second in command, God's right-hand man. And Dean had no idea why.
She should have guessed he was talking to the principal. Claire was a little surprised that he was talking about her. She had thought, if they spoke on the phone, they would be a lot grosser. She couldn’t stop listening now.
“Of course, as good a stand-in Mom as Dean makes, he was raised by two very grizzly men himself, so expect romantic gestures to come in the form of a six pack or motor oil.”
“I feel like I’m missing the joke,” Dean’s mother said drily. Dean looked at her, trying his best to look innocent.
“It’s not the barbecue, Cas. It just sucks that my mom doesn’t approve and your dad doesn’t seem to like me very much.”
“It’ll be okay, Claire. You can’t be surprised that kids are curious when you kissed her at the game. And give it time, other kids might feel more confident being out if you both are, and then you can explain the whole ace thing to an audience who doesn’t know how great sex is.”
'I don't see it entirely the way you do, Dean, but I can see how you see it. He's expecting us. Come on.'
'Then you know I mean it when I say that, if you need anyone to talk to because your parents are pissing you off, I'm here. Just leave my crap alone. And don't turn me into a hamster.'
Dean approached one table, tracing his finger over a statuette, before picking up an amulet and studying it briefly. He then spotted the table crammed with Busty Asian Beauties, and began flipping slowly through an issue, turning the magazine around every so often and appraising the images. Right in front of Castiel.
“Take the Impala. It’s bad enough you’re going to some opera and listening to high pitched singing all night, you might as well look good on your way there.”
gone? Where had his weapons gone? He felt naked, even in the tunic. He felt lonely without his Castiel.
'That's all you have to say? Come on, Cas, I need more than that. She needs more than that! She doesn't know who you are, not really, to her you're some uptight angel making her friend act like a douchebag. Maybe when she was seven years old, she needed her mother, rather than her joke of an uncle.'
Dax pulled the photograph out of his pocket that he had taken from Sam and Dean. At the time, he had taken it in the belief that he and Faith were leaving her parents behind, as a favour to her, but now it had another purpose.
They left the venue when the house lights went up, with a slight ringing in their ears. Castiel seemed puzzled as they approached the car.
It sounded strange, out loud. Real, though Castiel hadn’t been fooling around. Was he really going to commit his life to his best friend? Dean seemed to be thinking the same thing.
“You used to do that as a kid as well. Make me chase you. Normally when it was time to go. You would refuse and go scooting back into the ball pit and bury yourself down. Then you would wait until Amelia sent me in to look for you to get back out and run off.”
Quoiromantic (also known as WTFromantic or Whatromantic) is a romantic orientation on the aromantic spectrum. ... Being unable to define romantic attraction so unable to say whether or not you experience it.
She reached over to the dashboard, and changed the CD from the whining indie music Dax had chosen, slipping in Led Zeppelin instead.
“Like I said, you were a little kid. I don’t remember stuff from when I was a little kid either. Like, pre-kindergarten.”
“Dean, it wasn’t like that,” Sam promised him. “Please, tell me what happened with you? Last I heard, you were in the army?”
Literally haunting, in one sense, Castiel thought. Sam’s expression was still similar to that which Castiel imagined graced the courtroom frequently.
“Okay, here’s how it is.” Castiel tried to be Cas the confident as he refilled their glasses once more. “You and I stick together the whole time, okay? If anyone asks if we’re dating, you don’t say yes or no, just change the subject. But we play up to it just enough that people wonder anyway. I don’t want to spend more than two minutes with anyone else if we can help it, and if I want to go, we go. Even if we’ve been in there ten minutes and you haven’t been grossed out by caviar yet. I said I’d come, I didn’t say I’d stay.”
“It will happen, Dean. And hopefully it will happen soon. But you have a lot of responsibility and I have ties here. Who gives up their life? Do we both do it? I know we jumped into this, but we don’t have to rush everything.”
And it felt like Dean wanted to get physical. Not just from the intense kissing, Castiel had accidentally brushed his groin and felt him straining against the fabric of his pants. And Castiel wanted it too, could feel his own body demanding to take control. He made himself resist until they were on the yacht.
'You think he knows about the antichrist?' Sam asked, surprise in his voice. 'I didn't think anyone mentioned them around him.'
Dean came to too slowly, his head feeling heavy. Not quite a hangover, but close to it. He never got hangovers, but then, he wasn’t normally in Las Vegas, wasn’t normally accosted by attractive men who for some reason had flowers and cocktail umbrellas in their hair and introduced themselves by reeling off a glorification of his facial features.
Dean had raised his eyebrows at the mention of a crew, but he followed Castiel through the boat anyway, taking in the gleaming, unused control panels and the pristine mess hall as they headed to Castiel’s favourite spot.
… Castiel sucked in another breath, and tried to tiptoe through the minefield that was their new relationship. Or what passed for it, these days.
“I meant about you. Dean and I were happy to leave you with Jack, but we’ve noticed you seem a little distant with him later? It’s been better today, but I’m still worried what could happen while we’re not there. I’ve been wondering if, maybe, it might be a good idea to send you to your grandparents instead. You can distance learn there, and then maybe things will be better between you and Jack when you come home?”
“Yeah, oh, guess what he did last night?” Claire grinned, earning a tut from Patience who was starting on her lips. “Sorry, Patience.” And then she told them about Dean’s stepdad vows, and held up the charm bracelet. A hand caressed it, in much the same way Jack had done the night before, and Claire knew it was Alex examining it. Alex, who had her own issues with finding her family. Finally, she opened her eyes, and looked at her ex-girlfriend. “I hope Jody does something similar for you.”
Alex didn’t get the chance to respond, even if she was going to, because at that point their teacher was walking into the room and starting their lesson. Claire forced herself to concentrate, but it was hard when she was so worried about her girlfriend.
“Food’s up!” He passed burger joint bags around, and Faith left Junior alone to grab a handful of fries, barely stopping to chew as she devoured them. Dean made his way in between them to eat his burger, and Faith had to shuffle along the seat in order to avoid the baby being squashed. She sent an apologetic look to Junior, who waved his hand back at her as though he were dismissing her silent concerns, and they both turned back to their own greasy, salt-laden meals.
Gabriel walked out the door, closing it softly behind him. Faith stayed curled up on Castiel's lap, waiting for him to say something. Gabriel had thrown yet another issue into the mix, Faith's attitude towards Castiel when he was just an unknown angel to her. But Castiel didn't mention it, merely stroking her hair gently and resting his chin against her head. She had chosen to talk to Castiel on a whim, hoping that his role as her mother would mean he actually cared about her opinion, not his own aims. He was her mother, he was supposed to love her, no matter what, right?
“Hey, where is your dad? Charlie’s alone in the store, she said Cas was up here.” He looked around, as though Castiel were going to jump out on him, and Claire swapped a look with Alex. She didn’t like the idea of lying to Dean, but she knew nothing about the Jack that her father had gone off with either.
He edged closer, and pulled her into a hug. He stank of Dean, and sex, but Claire didn’t care, because he still had a trace of himself in there and his arms were solid and comforting.
“Oh my God, you little snitch!” Charlie complained, and there were the sounds of running as Dean brought his phone close to his face. He did nothing to stop his sisters chasing each other, and Castiel could hear screeching filter through the house. Dean sighed heavily.
Eventually, Dean managed to wrap his legs around the man’s throat, twisting around and pushing his face into the dirt, sitting on his shoulders. He started to punch his head, his vision blurring as rage and desperation took over. He wanted Castiel … there was no one else … he wasn’t going to be kicked out of the band because he didn’t have a beloved. He couldn’t stomach even the thought of someone else having Castiel, touching him … loving him …
“That was what you were asking, right Cas?” Dean persisted. Claire waited for Castiel to finish his sentence and ask Dean to move in with them like he was planning, but he didn’t. Eventually, he spoke again.
“I mean, you’re not meant to … I mean … I thought you were,” Dean seemed flustered, and he opened yet another beer, then the words came out, all run together. “Ithoughtyouwereasexualorsomething.”
She managed to drift off again, but catnapped throughout the night. Nothing that led to dreams, nothing that gave her more rest. She heard her father and Dean getting up, the shower running, their low voices down the hallway, footsteps going down to the kitchen. She listened hard for Jack’s movements, and after a while when they didn’t come, she crept out of the room, grabbing a shower for herself, and then slipping downstairs for the kitchen. She grabbed a bowl of cereal and headed into the study to start her online learning, headphones on so she didn’t have to have a conversation with her cousin and betray herself.
“Alex, you’re not my friend. You’re my girlfriend and my best friend and outside of my family, the most important thing to me.”
'Angel blades,' he pointed to the pure silver ones. 'Only thing that can kill an angel. Cas and Gabriel have theirs, these are the ones Dean and I have collected over the years. That's a demon blade, the only one. Works faster than an exorcism, but kills the host.' He pointed to the engraved knife.
“Our training might finally come to some good use?” Dean checked. They nodded. “I’ll put up with Athenians for that.”
“I am going to be their uncle,” he said proudly. She rested her head against his, as Dean grabbed Sam in a hug. “How’s the morning sickness been?”
“Thank you, Bear.” Castiel whispered, dropping a kiss onto her forehead. Dean said nothing, but lingered in the hug before they took their seats again, just before a desert of pie was brought out. Claire shook her head at the sight of the tiny pies on her plate, knowing this was Dean’s influence. Jack was already tucking in, and Claire didn’t hesitate to start on her plate of pies, fending Dean off from sneaking the mini cherry pie from her dish. After desert, a few other people made speeches, like Bobby and Charlie, and Claire watched Dean and Castiel absorbing the stories, still sat so close together they were practically on the same seat. And still, she was aware of her cousin, still snacking slowly on his pies, one of his hands resting on the back of her seat, brushing against the nape of her neck. It was almost uncomfortable, pretending she didn’t feel it there while feeling a creeping sensation all over her skin at his touch.
He rubbed the back of his sweaty neck. How was he supposed to bring this up? He’d had a boyfriend before, but the guy had hit on him. He had no idea how to get a feel for whether a guy could be interested.
“Did he? Well, I won’t go into specifics, but he made the evening enjoyable. And then I got the call about your mother and I had to go, I had to be there for you.”
“I’m sure it’s fine.” His mother smiled. Alfie approached them as the others carried on looking around.
Dean had agreed to attend some of the necessary functions with Castiel finally, after leaving it a good four months before donning a tuxedo again. They had left Charlie and Sam at home as they went in a limousine with Castiel’s brothers and Amara. They were holding hands as they sat beside each other and for once, Castiel was just enjoying the sensation of Dean’s skin against his own without thinking about what their handholding would mean or signal to others, or clinging on to his boyfriend like a lifeline. There was no double meaning to the way their fingers interlaced and their palms rested against each other.
'And you?' Dean shot out as soon as Dax finished speaking, his stare making it clear he wanted Faith's story more. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Dax frowning, a little put out, but Dean didn't care. He wanted her story, he wanted to hear exactly what happened to Siobhan, but Faith shrugged.
“My point is, when we first met, I was an angel who took whatever command I was given. And you changed that, you made me think, you showed me the value in doing the right thing. That the right thing wasn’t turning a blind eye and hoping it would all go away, that you had to fight and get your hands dirty if you wanted to help more people. You’re my moral compass, Dean.”
“I know. Thank you.” She leaned up and placed a soft kiss on Claire’s cheek. “I don’t want you uncomfortable.”
'So, you wanted to talk about what's wrong with Faith, I take it?' Chuck asked over the rim of his glass.
She was still so aware of every part of their bodies touching, of how their breasts latticed together, how their groins were close. Every shift of Alex’s shoulders or hips sent shockwaves through her. And yet … she was okay. This was okay. She took a shaking breath in, and parted Alex’s lips with her tongue, feeling Alex come up to meet her. It still felt weird, and slimy, but it wasn’t as unpleasant as last time. She could do this. She even felt bold enough to put a hand on Alex’s waist, feeling the way her girlfriend juddered under her, like Claire’s touch alone was intense. She teased her fingers along the hemline of Alex’s shirt, as Alex’s hand slid down, grazing the top of her ass.
Dean and Castiel exchanged a look before looking over at Sam, who had been in the corner of the room for the entire exchange. He'd looked away pointedly as the angel had kissed his brother, but had been watching his niece with concern in the meantime. It was only as she spoke, however, that he seemed to realise their error. Faith had no idea about Dax's escape - Dean had decided they wouldn't worry her - and believed that Sam was still looking after him in the bunker. He cleared his throat, preparing to lie for her sake.
Michael looked between the two of them, trying to work out what was going on. Castiel stood and headed for the door, as his elder brothers once more began arguing. He checked his cell phone out in the hallway, and felt slightly better. Dean didn’t disappoint.
“She’s had a tough few years,” her father defended her mildly. She scoffed again as she stomped up the stairs to the apartment. Her father was always calm and non confrontational. It was irritating, and when Claire was having a hard time he made her feel like such a colossal dick with his soothing tones and restrained way of speaking. She vented her new frustration on the front door, giving it a kick before opening it up, and then slamming every drawer and cupboard door she could find, stomping on the ceiling the entire time. It took him ten minutes of her banging around the apartment to finally come up. Charlie must have been on a break. He stood in the doorway and watched with those clear blue eyes while she continued her tantrum, eventually giving up and, feeling foolish, flopping onto the sofa. And then throwing the cushions onto the floor.
“But you’re going to have to tell them,” Mary nodded to the door, and stood up to begin cooking dinner.
Dean gave him another adorable smirk and then hung up, and Castiel flopped onto the bed in the hotel room that not that long ago his new husband had been in also.
“It’s not your fault, Cas,” Sam sounded distant, thoughtful, and Castiel could tell how upset he was. “You didn’t want this either.”
“You could have warned me.” Dean’s tone turned petulant, which confused Castiel even more. Dean hadn’t responded to a single word, how was Castiel meant to tell him? Send a save-the-date card to the Winchesters? Beyond Dean’s shoulder, Castiel saw Charlie approaching slowly, eyeing them apprehensively. Castiel still had no idea what to make of Dean’s little sister, what she would do with the news that Castiel was engaged to someone else. He did not need two Winchesters to increase his anxiety. It was already coming out in the worst possible way, raising Castiel’s defences.
Claire should have expected a cemetery. For some reason though, she hadn’t been. And yet, Mary Winchester’s grave was pretty, well cared for, and in the corner of the graveyard. They stood side-by-side at the foot of the grave.
Dean kissed his forehead again, and started to snore lightly moments later. Castiel snuggled into his chest, and tried to stay awake, to enjoy the feel of Dean’s skin against his own once again.
“The first time I saw you, he was helping you with that egg-shaped statue, complaining that it wasn’t made of marshmallows. Then when I was assessing some of the other art, he said it was like Picasso and you said no-”
Emmanuel didn’t answer, and Castiel rushed back into his own house clutching the lint rollers. He went over his sofa, his rug, he swept the wooden floors and gave the tables and chairs a once over, and then let Dean in, feeling hot and out of breath.
'Okay, we'll do our best to get Flora and Stevie in that time. Sam says that Dax has been in contact, we're trying to lock down where he and Stevie are while we concentrate on Flora.'
'I didn't have a choice. My dad made me, and Dean. I tried to get out, so many times, but I kept getting dragged back in. Trust me Faith, there's a world out there beyond hunting.'
“Are you crying?” She whispered. Alex didn’t respond. “What was with that girl? Are the other cheerleaders giving you shit because I kissed you?”
Sam picked up his mug and took a sip, and Castiel waited for him to bring up what had just happened, staring down into his own mug.
“Well, Zeus, if that was wrong, we’ve got to keep going until we get it right.” Dean chuckled breathlessly.
Castiel felt the bottom fall out of his stomach. His muscles seized up, and he turned away from Dean to see Meg, who looked as flawless as always. Castiel felt sick, seeing his ex-wife, having her approach them so boldly when she had caused so much upset. Remembering how she tried to coerce him into sleeping with her, how she lied and made out Dean was anything less than the wonderful person he was. How she rinsed Castiel and acted like it was all his fault.
Even half an hour ago, Castiel couldn’t imagine talking to anyone in that way, to saying what he actually thought about the worst of their personality. And it hurt him to say it, like he was completely destroying anything that had been between them. He let go of Dean and walked away, seeking out Meg, feeling his entire body shaking. He kept thinking of other things he should have said, like how Dean was a pawn of Michael’s and Castiel had suspected it all along. But also that he missed the artist and he wished Dean had replied to at least one message. That he would call off his engagement in a heartbeat if he just knew that Dean truly cared.
‘Heaven is under new management. And the instructions were clear, bring Castiel in for an appointment.’
'Who talks like that?' Faith rolled her eyes, all joviality gone as she strode up to Ms Matthews, staring up at the elder woman's wrinkled, pale face. 'Because Ms Matthews sure as fuck doesn't.'
Dean smirked, leaning his head up so that they could kiss. Castiel obliged, although he wondered when Dean would ever acknowledge their foray into paintball.
Alex made her sit on the vanity seat and started untying the braids that ran along one side of her hair, and Claire tried not to think about how gentle Alex’s fingers were, and how cool to the touch. She put her hands underneath her thighs so she didn’t do anything stupid, and watched in the mirror as Alex concentrated on what she was doing.
He pulled the door open as his siblings dived into their rooms. The doors all slammed shut and Dean looked back at Castiel awkwardly. Castiel gave a sad little smile back.
All four girls oohed as Castiel led their principal to his bedroom, and they waited for a moment after the bedroom door closed to start talking.
Her grandparents traded a glance, before her grandfather put his hand on her shoulder. She resisted shrugging it off.
The glasses connected, and Gabriel immediately sipped from his glass. Castiel carefully brought his back down, closer to his mouth, and then tried to sip. Instead, he felt his mouth widen around the rim as the contents of his cocktail forced their way down his throat. He let go of the glass, but it remained connected to his lip, and he scrambled to find purchase on the edge of the seat as his body reacted to whatever Gabriel had managed to get him to ingest.
“Because one of your fathers was a man first?” Gabriel sounded intrigued. It wasn’t the kind of conversation Dean had thought to have.
Charlie looked around at her surroundings, her nose wrinkling at the smell of stale alcohol, stale air and the sting of sweat which threatened to overpower her. She tried to go gently with Dean.
Balthazar owns the stadium. He used to do figure-skating as a child and never stopped loving it. Not that he would ever tell anyone that.
“She said it was an accident. But the cheerleaders were missing in action for a while,” Sam answered. So, she hadn’t fooled him at all, and her English teacher had made a good guess at what had happened. “I noticed that Alex also wasn’t cheering tonight.”
“Certainly, Mr Winchester,” she preened, and flicked her dark hair over her shoulder as Claire glanced backwards. She caught the sneer just in time and rolled her eyes before doodling on the cover of her notepad and zoning out again.
The way Dean said it, he made it sound as though his siblings were fighting a lost cause. That he had tried to fight his own impulses and given up. He knew he owed something to Dean, a confession of his own, and he tried to ground himself by concentrating on their hands joined together, and refused to break eye contact as he responded.
“Well, I guess if you can afford to fuck about with a sculpture worth seven thousand dollars.” Dean gave a shrug, and Castiel felt himself relax a teeny amount. Maybe Dean was clueless, maybe this was just how he was. The moodiness that the assistant had warned him about. He felt emboldened by the idea. And also - he was managing to talk to Dean in a somewhat cohesive conversation. It was more than exciting, it felt unreal.
“Honestly, it will.” Mr Winchester promised, and put the donut box away, rubbing his chin as he looked her over. “Would you even consider seeing the school counsellor?”
“What’s Cas got planned for today? Because if it’s a marching band through the bunker, I’m going out.”
Dax watched the three of them as he ate his sandwich, sneaking his phone out of his pocket and taking a few surreptitious photos of the three of them. He was fairly sure Faith was going to need some kind of reminder of this fairly soon.
“See, Dean gets it. Twindom means you mess with other people. Having a double is wasted on you two.”
There was no way she could talk to her dad about this. He would be kind to a fault and then probably send Jack away. She couldn’t talk to Dean because he blabbed everything to her father. Jack was definitely out of bounds. Alex, Kaia, and Patience had continued to avoid her since she was homeschooled. Who was there? Who could help her sound out how she was feeling without it tracing back to anyone who could get hurt by it all?
“Why?” Jack swiped a lump of chocolate out of the carton that Claire had been eyeballing. “I mean, she wasn’t involved in what happened. I know Uncle Cas said she was a cheerleader and they think the cheerleaders did this to you, but why would she join in and why would you be mad at her if she didn’t?”
“Night, Dean.” She called as she headed to her bedroom. She heard them jump apart and then shut her door, climbing into bed. A few moments later, Castiel appeared at her doorway.
“I was just going to take these to your place,” Sam smiled at Claire, his eyes flickering to Alex and back as though silently asking if they were okay.
“Yes?” Balthazar stopped walking away, shielding his eyes from the sun to look at his little brother.
She almost went too far. She almost mentioned the day the angels came for her, that he could talk of her own good, and protecting her all he wanted, but that was the day he didn’t. But she held back, and he seemed to sense that she was, even without extra powers of his own.
'What act? Sam, I wasn't … I don't know what that stuff is, okay? I just want to go now, whether Faith comes with me or not. I want to move on, okay? Like, I wanna carry on hunting monsters, saving people, the whole Hunter deal.'
'Yeah, we were debating whether that might have happened too. Cas wouldn't let anything happen to him, he knows what Dax means to you.'
She took his wrist, and led him along the thick carpeted hallway, pushing open one of the thick doors and tugging him inside.
The silence that fell between them at that moment was so loud, it felt like it was going to burst Dean’s ear drums. He thought of how that week had changed his life, how he had begun to fall for Castiel - Castiel, not the vessel he was using - he thought of the shock of discovering that he was going to be a father. Castiel’s surprise, the way he babbled on … the way he just accepted that he would be a mother, no questions asked … how long it had taken for Dean to adjust to the idea of a little kid depending on him. But then, the day that Faith was born, the way she seemed so intelligent at only a couple of hours old, and so delicate, and a big part of him already.
“Jack Novak is here,” she hissed. “I knew Claire would be, she and Alex are always together, but I thought Jack was too cool for something like this. Do I look okay?”
'Kid, I'm sorry, there's no way you have any kind of authority that would make anyone listen to you.'
“Oh.” Castiel looked away for a moment, considering this. Dean wasn’t asking about money, he was concerned with his own family. As if Dean needed to become any more attractive. Dean wasn’t asking to tell them about the money, it seemed, but about how they connected. Maybe Dean was as ashamed of the cash as Castiel was. Not that it would stop Castiel giving it to him. He turned back, and felt his heart leaping in his chest as he looked at the beautiful man who was watching him intently. “Tell them whatever you want. Just make sure they’re not going to tell anyone else.”
'Dude, you're cuffed, you can't move, how about you realise there's no room for negotiation?' Sam sniggered briefly, humourlessly. 'And maybe take Faith's advice?'
I know, I know, I rushed through the wedding. Just like Meg and Cas. I have other things I want to address in this story, though ...
Dean’s brain faltered for a moment, before he pulled back, looking between the three of them in the grove.
“This is really good. Dionysus must be trying to get over the loss of his patron city. Hestia will think it gives her the right to be the twelfth Olympian, now he has lost Thebes.”
Castiel couldn’t move out from under Gabriel’s weight. The barrage of questions was typical of them in everything but the tone they delivered it in. There was no humour, no laughs punctuating the words.
It had been unavoidable that everyone discovered what had transpired. It had been awful having to go to some of these events and hearing people whispering, having them outright asking him for sordid details, especially at a time when Dean wasn’t ready to come too. He had stuck close to Balthazar and Gabriel at those functions, and they had lightened the mood enough for Castiel to manage until he could fold himself into Dean’s arms later that night.
Faith stepped cautiously down the thick concrete stairs into the men of letter's basement, picking her way carefully through so she didn't disturb Dean or Sam and have them force her out of the room. Every footfall seemed to echo around the dim room, even as she tried to tiptoe towards the sectioned off area that Faith knew Dax was sat behind. She peered around the door and saw him sitting in the chair, still heavily cuffed, his head drooping forward as though he were reading something. She assumed he was asleep, and crept into the room.
Music drifted across the grove, and they looked up to find both of Castiel’s fathers in vibrant colours. Aristaeus was favouring green, and Apollo yellow. They also had small rainbow squares painted on their cheeks. Apollo was playing his lyre, and he was followed by the muses who had opted for pink and purple shades, all of them singing songs they had given to the likes of Cher, Whitney Houston, George Michael to name a few. Their own party was starting.
“Are you sure about that?” Dean asked Castiel, who merely smiled back. He took the tape off the box, revealing tightly packed books. It was as he gently removed one that Claire understood.
“I don’t get why you want me. Why you’re stupid enough to do that, when you know I’m pregnant, and hung up on my ex-boyfriend. When I’m a bitch, and my healing abilities suck and I’m holding everyone back by waddling and we could be miles further on by now and you wouldn’t even have gotten hurt if I wasn’t around. And even if it made sense to like me, it would be pointless anyway, because I promised to never sleep with anyone ever and it would be stupid to go out with a girl who you can’t really be with.”
“Surprise, little bro,” Gabriel beamed. Castiel groaned at the positivity in his voice, and curled up on the seat to go back to sleep. He was roused again, and let his brothers lead him half-asleep through a building he was vaguely aware was full of people, yet still light and airy. They attracted less attention than Castiel might have supposed they would, but it hardly mattered as they were on Balthazar’s private plane about the time Castiel started to come around fully.
Claire almost couldn’t believe that they were arguing like this, except that she knew Dean could be a hothead, and that he father’s passive approach to things often drove her crazy too.
Faith rolled her eyes at her dorky angelic uncle, but crawled out of her sleeping bag and stood up, striding over to her father. He flipped his phone closed and smiled at her.
“He persuaded me that it was better to marry Meg and let her take charge. That he knew my heart wasn’t in it but Meg had always been there for me and she was decisive. And when I spoke to her, she said it was a great idea, and she was surprised Luke came up with it.”
“Dean! Welcome!” A merry voice called from the marble benches. Dean turned, and saw an effigy made living of a face he knew well. It had decorated his city, it had been everywhere as he grew up. Dionysus. Dean instantly dropped to one knee, bowing his head. He had never thought he would ever come face-to-face with one of the gods. “Oh, do get up, boy, humility isn’t one of your blessings.”
“I hope you have a good marriage, Cas. That she makes you happy every day. And that whatever else, you don’t think of me and hate me.”
“You’re more normal than I am.” She tapped her ear, and looked up at the clock above the bar. “I’d better finish up, my break ends soon.” She lifted the chicken finger up again, and took another bite. Claire ate the last few of her fries, though they were soggy and falling apart from all the cheese grease and chilli they had absorbed. Eileen scooted out the booth when she finished eating, sketched a wave at Claire and took her plate and glass with her. As she did, she revealed Alex, still in her cheer outfit, walking through the door to the diner alone. She approached Claire’s table with a meek expression.
'Yeah, in theory. But Sam and I don't talk about stuff like that, and there was nothing he could say. And Charlie calls me girlfriend way too much.'
Jack grinned, and started driving out of the lot, down the road and towards the edge of town. They passed Claire’s old school, and ended up driving past an orchard, and around a bunch of fields. They didn’t play the radio, or fall into silence, but talked endlessly instead.
Dean kissed him gently on the mouth, and stepped back for a moment, and instantly they were on a plane of Heaven that Castiel wasn't familiar with. He looked around, at the abundance of wild flowers around them, the trees that pointed high into the sky, too far to see where they ended. And at one end of the overgrown garden, half hidden by a large rose bush, sitting on a white painted wooden swing, was Mary. She watched them approach, her eyes firmly on Dean, raking over his face with a hunger that Castiel understood well. It was hard not to look at Dean that way.
A flapper did a quick shuffle to the side of the screen as the other eight flapper Castiel’s sat down, immediately donning jeans, denim-and-leather shirts, and pigtails as they milked cows that had appeared … all with Castiel’s face on. Dean was howling with laughter.
“Yeah. She was so caught up on Dad, she has all these rules that stop Charlie and Adam and me bringing someone back, and then she does that.”
“Okay. I remember being on a boat with you, I think? And some singing, and going for bacon double cheeseburgers.”
She saw, in her peripheral vision, Dean turn to look at her, and she kept her focus on Chuck. She wondered if Dean was remembering the same thing she was, the last time he had been over and she had said the same thing about high school boys.
“Yeah? You like me in your clothes?” He flirted. Castiel’s eyes widened, and Dean pressed closer, trapping him against the island in the kitchen. He lowered his voice, just audible over the music. “Or prefer me out of them?”
“Teenager present, be gross on your own time.” Claire turned back to her homework. Dean looked over her shoulder.
“Okay, we’re off the record now.” Mr Winchester sat forward, looking at her earnestly. “Claire, I know teenagers don’t want to listen when someone says they know how it feels but … my mother died when I was four. I
“Dean said I should get his cell number and email from you, so we can keep in contact about my piece.” Castiel told her. “I should also pay for my sculpture now.”
“Okay. And you realise that whatever you’re feeling, Claire, violence isn’t the answer? You know where the teacher’s lounge is, you can knock and talk to a faculty member. Or if that’s not something you feel comfortable with, you have a friend don’t you?”
“I think so. I’m not sure what I’m meant to tell you,” he confessed. “Dean’s working on something he wants to surprise Sam with.”
“You have three people coming to the game today. Dean Winchester and his brother and sister. Could you please give them the President’s box? And lay out some food and drink for them. Balthazar knows my accountant to bill for it.”
'Right about the time you opened your mouth, then?' he smirked back. 'Faith, it's me. Garth. We spoke on the phone with that djinn case in Cincinnati?'
They both looked across at Dean, who had convinced Emmanuel to dance with him somehow, both of them shuffling slightly and talking quietly. Dean’s gaze was on his husband, and he didn’t look away as Castiel gazed back. There was so much love and lust and heat in Dean’s gaze, and Castiel felt that pull he always did, to go and be with his husband. Mary chuckled.
She moved away, and began flirting with one of the generals of their regiment. Castiel scooted closer before anyone could take her place.
They walked into the house, and Dean immediately began sneezing, leaning against the doorframe as he did.
“And it was sad, you sitting here all alone, eating the first hot meal in forever. I felt sorry for you.”
'That's not what I meant, it was a joke … we're off the point. You're close with the story, but not quite there. You're not Jesus, Faith. That's not your role.'
“He’s not motivated by my money. And he’s been really understanding about my anxieties. I didn’t even have to tell him, he just knew.”
“She may need some understanding from your teachers when it comes to completing homework assignments for the next few weeks, just to ease her into it, but Claire doesn’t like handouts too much, so I think special treatment would irritate her,” he cast another glance at her. “Almost as much as it’s bugging her right now that I’m speaking for her, even though she has no inclination of talking right now.”
That night, Faith had climbed into the bed, and waited for her father to come in, her thoughts tumbling between Junior and Dax. Truthfully, she hadn’t made her mind up about what to do. She wanted Junior, she knew that much, but Dax had been a big part of her life. And maybe, when she was pregnant at seventeen and under a chastity vow with God in order to have a shot of getting into Heaven when she finally died, she really shouldn’t be thinking about boyfriends.
Castiel got a glimpse of a picture, like an old photograph. The old photograph he knew Dean kept close at all times, of a blonde woman holding her young son, cradling her swollen stomach.
“I’d prefer to focus on what’s ahead, than feel wounded by others opinions. They don’t know Sam. And you’re right, you have to rely on me, so instead of worrying about how everyone else is acting about my brother, lets focus on what’s coming.”
“I don’t know what I was thinking. Or I do, but,” she bit her lower lip for a brief moment. “Look, okay, I thought you had kissed me before, when you came over and made me feel better with that make over.
