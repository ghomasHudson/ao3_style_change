He turns the papers and pushes them to Dean across the table.
“Of course, you exist. I just didn’t know it was all, well…real.”
“Should we go make sure they haven’t gotten into too much trouble?” Gilda suggests, following her son into the kitchen.
Dean and Castiel stand side-by-side on Charlie’s doorstep. Both are nervous. Dean has been absently preening his beard since they got on the bus, tugging and pulling the underside into a tangled mess that makes Castiel’s hyper-bouncing knee look downright tame by comparison.
Then, they’re both laughing and joking, and Sam hauls himself out of his chair to give Dean a bone-crushing hug.
?" Sam chucks a pillow at his head and both brothers spend the night reminiscing about all the pranks they played on each other as kids, including the month Dean woke Sam up with that particular song every morning before sunrise.
He’s taking a quick break to stretch his fingers and unfold the girl's latest creation: a fat bumblebee with a dotted flight path, when he feels a tingle race down his spine, goosebumps raising the skin at the back of his neck. He tucks the drawing with the others in the breast pocket of his flannel, nestled amongst his guitar picks, and settles his guitar, eager to catch the first glimpse of his not-favorite, favorite blue-eyed commuter.
Castiel hangs his messenger bag on a hook near the door and pats the Chewbacca bobblehead on Charlie’s desk, retrieving the watering can from his desk drawer. After a quick trip to the water fountain, he makes the rounds of their little garden, ending with a spider plant that he’s let die several times which Charlie somehow manages always to resurrect. He says quiet hellos to each plant as the water sinks into their rich soil, thankful for the small amount of life they are able to bring to the subterranean environment.
“Anson makes for excellent company. Isn’t that right, sir,” Castiel asks, bouncing the toddler on his hip until the boy wriggles out of his arms to tear off into the kitchen.
?” He dons a vaguely Spanish accent and continues, “‘My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die!’” He mimes running Castiel through with a sword and Castiel finally loses it, bursting into a fit of laughter that Dean joins in after a moment of stunned silence. “You just wanted me to do the voice, huh?”
“Oh, that’s exciting! You could interview the girl we saw at lunch yesterday, too.”
“What the hell, Sammy?”
Now, though, it reminds him that free will is dead, that nothing will ever be right gain. And even if it was, he’s changed, irrevocably.
Sam and Dean don’t make it to bed that night.  They fall asleep, leaning into one another, on the couch. When they wake up late the next morning, it’s with cricks in their necks and full hearts. Dean makes them bacon and pancakes after Sam calls into his professor to excuse his absence, and the pair spend the whole day together for the first time in years.
"Hey man, you might want to go through the kitchen to get to the library," Sam tells Castiel with a conspiratorial wink.
Dean watches as Castiel packs his notes away in a folder that he slips into his messenger bag while he makes himself comfortable on the big couch. There’s a new tension between them. He thinks it’s the good kind of nervous before something big, but supposes the big stuff is already out of the way given his confession and Castiel’s ready acceptance. He feels fantastic and a little dizzy, having everything out in the open now.
He didn’t bother with the lights, dropping his towel and pulling on a pair of boxers, couldn't resist prodding the bruises covering him as he peeled back the covers on the bed and lowered himself gingerly onto the sheets. Sheets that were covered in prickly, itchy, awfulness. Sam leaped from bed and flipped the lamp, aches forgotten.
Dean reached out and looped an arm around Castiel’s waist, reeling him in close to his personal space. “The shirt? Hideous,” Dean concluded with a flick to the collar, causing a laugh to bubble up out of Cas. “You?” Dean pressed a soft kiss to his husband’s lips. “Gorgeous. As always.”
“What about me?” Cas stuck his arms out
Dirty money.
Castiel deduced. He could feel his heart beating rapidly in his chest, his pulse racing through his ears as he listened to the ring once, twice, two times too many, until finally, finally Dean picked up.
He had memorized Dean's phone number, something that didn't seem particularly significant until this very moment, and Castiel pushed each button into the payphone slowly with an underlining buzz of excitement and
Dean meant what he said about believing in all of them. If there was any hope of keeping all the good things in his life he had to. Even as he fell asleep to the sound of maniacal laughter echoing in his head, mocking him, Dean clung to that belief just as tight as Castiel clung to him.
"I am." Dean continued getting ready for bed in a state of irritation, shimmying out of his jeans and kicking them off to the side. He grabbed a pair of loose fitting sweatpants from his dresser and tugged them on avoiding eye contact with the angel. Everything about his demeanor screamed 'I don't want to talk about this anymore' but that didn't stop Cas from stepping into his space and blocking him from the bed where Dean was currently trying to get to as quickly as possible.
A surprised laugh bubbled out of Dean, and Castiel gazed at him fondly, sharing a chuckle of his own. It had been awhile since they laughed together. At this point they were completely intertwined with each other. Dean had his arms wrapped tightly around Castiel’s shoulders, while the angel’s arms looped around Dean’s waist. The skin on skin contact made it difficult for Dean to remember why he was supposed to be holding back. Too much too soon was not what he was going for here.
Every damn time Cas had left him, intentional or not, it ripped through his chest and tore him apart inside like that Hellhound had clawed through his flesh all those years ago. Except losing Cas – it was worse. Physical pain doesn't last forever. But the pain of losing this stubborn bastard beside him?
All Dean knew for sure was that he needed to protect his family. Even if it meant sacrificing himself. He would take on that role and be their shield. He would selflessly give up any future moments of happiness with his angel if it meant they would all make it out of this war in one piece.
Castiel was clearly confused. "Why not?"
"Leaving him behind was
Dean started off slow with a bar of soap in one hand and lathered the suds over the angel’s shoulders, concentrating way too hard on being overly cautious just in case Cas pushed him away or told him to stop. He didn’t. Dean worked his way down Castiel’s biceps and lower arms, reveling in the feeling of strong muscles under his finger tips. Dean felt the angel’s eyes on him as he worked and it made Dean nervous enough to speed up the process a bit and move directly to his broad chest and flat tummy.
Cas doesn’t whisper it like it’s a deep dark secret anymore; he’s confident about it, the words flowing out of his mouth freely, easy as stating a simple fact of life. The sky was blue. Grass was green. And Castiel was in love with Dean Winchester. He can’t say it back—not right now, not for the first time, not like
A small part of him (he suspected stemmed from a neglectful childhood) wanted to crawl into the other's embrace and just let himself be lulled back to sleep by fingers in his hair and whispers of sweet nothings in his ear. But things were still fresh between them. What they had now – what they
Dean took a breath to steady himself and grabbed the angel’s hand, pulling Cas up from the table as he stood. Castiel went willingly, linking their fingers together as Dean pulled him down the hall towards his bedroom, but made a pivot in a different direction when he was struck with an idea. Dean ended up taking them to one of the bunkers biggest bathrooms claiming he was desperately in need of a shower to wash the stink of purgatory off his skin.
“I’m going to run to the vending machine in the hall, get some water and any food that’s worth eating.” Cas detaches Dean’s grabby hands from his clothes, presses his hand to Dean’s cheek, bends down to kiss his temple. “Don’t throw yourself in front of any knives while I’m gone.”
Sam heads out after washing up, going to meet Eileen at a bar in town. Once the door bangs shut behind him, Dean pulls Cas out of his seat at the kitchen table, presses him into the closest wall and kisses the vanilla and honey off his tongue.
And he’s suddenly overwhelmed the solid reality of Cas’ warm, beautiful body pressed up against every inch of him.
“Cas, Cas it’s okay!”
Cas slings Dean’s arm on his good side around his own shoulders and walks him out of the bathroom. Dean leans into him heavily, head resting against Cas’ and eyes closing before they even make it to sitting on the bed. Dean toes his own boots and socks off while Cas slowly manoeuvres him out of his ruined t-shirt. Shuffling him out of his jeans and into some clean sweats takes a few minutes more, and by the time Cas is helping him lie down Dean is mostly asleep, all clingy arms and half-closed, unfocused eyes.
He shouldn’t be afraid of this, he realises. Cas isn’t. Somehow, despite all that Dean’s done to him, all the pain and guilt, all the literal deaths that loving Dean has inflicted on him over the past eleven years, Cas still consciously, repeatedly trusts Dean with his heart. He still thinks Dean’s name is worth saying with all the devotion of a prayer. The least Dean can do is be brave enough to accept what Cas wants it to mean.
The heading
Sam smiles a bit, turns away. He hesitates as he goes, turning back to look at Dean as if he’s afraid Dean will stay here all night, pinned to the wall. But eventually he does leave.
down into the pits of his soul.
turned out to be, loves him with all the force he used to bring to bear on a literal deity, and when he says Dean’s name like that, the sheer weight of that love could unravel Dean one atom at a time.
The first sip delivers enough blessed caffeine for him to open his eyes properly. He catches sight of his reflection in a corner of chrome and scowls at the state of his hair. Damn Dean and his grabby hands.
He wonders sometimes how many of those marks are faked, painted onto the actors’ skin and daubed over with CG later to replicate the shifting colours of an active bond. They certainly have to be fake in movies – he’s never seen a couple in any Oscar-bait flick he can remember who don’t have marks clearly visible on their hands or arms or necks. Funny how they’re always in those obvious places, despite marks appearing everywhere on average people’s bodies. They’re just as common on chests and hips and backs as on hands. Castiel even knows someone at school whose mark is on the sole of his foot.
“But you didn’t. I’m right here,” Dean whispers into Cas’ lips. “Tell me you don’t want this and I’ll stop. But I want
It’s a beautiful day, clear-sky sunny but with a breeze fresh enough to take the edge off the heat. Castiel stands under one of the trees lining the playing fields and stares up. Despite the blazing sunshine, the heat won’t sink through his skin. Inside he feels nothing but chill. Beneath the blue of the wide-open sky, he’s a tiny bundle of cloudy grey.
the man’s enough of an idiot to come back, but he’s met some really stupid people in his life. He’s learnt to be careful.
he thinks to himself.
Sam must see something of it in his face. He shakes his head again, tries to pull Dean back into a hug. Dean flinches away, memory grating his skin too raw for touch.
Pulling up the browser, he switches to incognito mode and rattles off the first search term that pops into his head.
Dean’s grin ratchets up a notch. He leaves it for the minute. Changes back into his own clothes, gathers up the pieces he wants and heads for the checkout. Cas trails behind him, half tripping on his dragging feet.
Dean closes his eyes. Nods once.
Dean loosens under his hold, turns his head to kiss Cas’ hair.
“No.” Cas doesn’t hesitate. “No.” He doesn’t smile, but his eyes crinkle like they do when he’s pleased. “There’s not much I’m certain of in life any more, but I am certain of this.”
Content at last, Cas gives in to sleep’s siren song and lets his eyes finally, finally close. He’s just slipping under when Dean huffs a breath against his shoulder.
They tumble through that door in a mess of tangled limbs. Dean’s hip rebounds off the desk but the jolt of pain barely registers through the heat flaring under his skin. He mouths at the line of Cas’ jaw, grabs at his shirt, shoves it off his shoulders to get to skin. The buttons snag and Dean tugs, stymied. Then Cas kisses into the hollow behind Dean’s ear, open mouthed and wet and messy, and the frustration slips from Dean’s mind in a hot glide of
It’s fucking freezing in Kansas this January. Dean has the bunker’s heating turned up to something obnoxious and he’s still shuffling around in sweats and his robe and a blanket thrown around him. It bites into his joints, sets his hands aching and his fingers fumbling no matter how high he turns the radiators or how many layers he piles on.
Cas. Dean called him Cas. And, it dawns slowly on Castiel, he did before too. When he was rushing to show Castiel his amulet he said Cas then as well. Just Castiel was too caught up in the moment to register it.
Cas glances over at him, something bereft surfacing in his eyes, and Dean slides his left foot over to press against Cas’ right.
“It didn’t
September rolls around and brings with it a new academic year. Cas slips back into the dull routine of classes and homework and squirreling himself away in the library at lunch to avoid the bored jocks on the prowl for a target, any target.
Castiel’s just reaching out to touch the arm of the bench when his heart skips and heat shivers through him. The colours of his mark blossom in vivid green and he realises.
Cas blinks, startled. Of all the things he’d wondered, he hadn’t expected that.
The pavements crunch as he walks, salt and snow gritty under his soles. He turns his face up to the sky and feels the snowflakes scatter across his cheeks, pinpoints of cold prickling on his skin in a counterpoint rhythm to the pulsing tug inside him. He hopes, he
was feeling in those hanging seconds. All that’s clear in his memory is the tide of unfamiliar longing surging inside him, drowning his own emotions in the flood.
“February 93? The winter I got the flu?”
The woman behind the stall sees him looking, steps closer and smiles.
You are worth more than the universe to me. I tried to tell you before, you are
Cas helped wash them both one last time before Dean shut off the water and stepped over to the towel rack. His fingers were starting to prune. The two of them took their time drying each other before Cas went over to the counter by the sink and picked something up, offering it to Dean with an outstretched hand.
"Hello, Dean."
you to know that.” And maybe it should have been a bigger deal than it was, maybe Castiel should have felt shocked, elated, overwhelmed. Maybe even a little scared. Dean had never said those words to him out loud before. But Castiel decided early on in their relationship that he didn't have to. Dean had made his true feelings clear countless times through his actions.
It came out a whisper, an exhale of those two words, and Castiel could sense the change in atmosphere on the other end of the line. Could practically see Dean's wide eyes and wobbling bottom lip, desperate to believe what he heard was real and not some cruel joke the universe decided to play on him because

And maybe Dean only said it because he was feeling sensitive about what happened with John. Or maybe he had been trying to get it out for a long time now. It didn't really matter either way, as long as Dean heard from Castiel himself that he was doing enough, that he was enough just
When Cas finally pushed into him to Dean it felt like coming home. Sure, for the most part they sucked at communicating, but this was something they
Gathering what little strength he had left, Dean pushed himself onto his feet and turned to face the angel. Castiel stood rigid only a few steps away from him. His eyes held a deep sadness, and possibly even more infuriating, genuine concern for Dean's emotional state.
“Because I didn’t know how alright?!" Dean exploded, every suppressed emotion he had been bottling up for days finally breaking the dam of his resolve. For Castiel's part he at least seemed surprised by Dean's sudden outburst. "How could I—" Dean abruptly choked on the emotion restricting his throat and swallowed thickly to try and collect himself. The way Cas was looking up at him, blue eyes glassy, eyebrows drawn together in sympathy, head slightly titled to the side, trying so hard to understand — Dean was so gone on him it was almost sick.
"How could I look you in the eye and tell you this is over?” Dean gestured a hand between them, his voice reduced to a scratchy whisper. “After everything we’ve been through, after everything we fought for? I couldn’t do it. I still can’t. So please don’t ask me to. I need you to tell me you get that."
but his time in the empty had affected him in a way he didn't know exactly how to define. Outside, at least, he felt like he could breathe comfortably—the static hum of the street lights and gentle

have to move for sure.
And finally—the grand show stopper—a beautiful pine tree, closer to 9ft in height that Dean hand picked and sawed down in the woods out back. Dragging this sucker inside had been a bitch, and Sam chewed him out for leaving a trail of pine needles all the way down the stairs but the end result had been worth it.
Every molecule in Castiel’s body was electric as he slowly turned around to face them. He saw Dean first, and then he
Castiel bumped their foreheads together, his eyes sliding shut as he made a thoughtful noise in the back of his throat. “I think there’s a lot we need to work through,” he said instead of answering Dean’s question, and Dean… kinda hated that answer. He hated it because he was mostly to blame for putting them in that position.
It was harder to hang up than Castiel had expected, but the promise of something more gave him that final push to click the payphone back into place, to trust what he had built with the Winchesters—what he had built with
“I’m not gay,” Dean hears a voice that’s no longer his own hiss gruff and distant in the back of his mind as the angel’s tear stained face splits into a grin and he tells Dean that everything he has ever done since the moment they met had been for or because of Dean. Cas tells Dean he changed him completely. Cas tells Dean he loves him. Dean tells the voice in his head to shut up.
Later.
“I’m not gay,” Dean tells himself in a raw, broken whisper the first night after he burned Cas’s body and Dean felt like he was the one who had died instead. A nearly empty fifth of whiskey white-knuckled in his left hand, the right hand clutching at his opposite shoulder desperate to find the scar of a branded hand print that had long since faded from his skin.
As soon as he was above ground the icy sting of December air nipped at his nose and cheeks. It wasn’t snowing now but there was a couple of inches still on the ground, most of which had been shovelled away for Baby’s sake. It was a quiet night; not even the music and rowdy conversations from the party could be heard outside.
The angel had ruined him. Dean couldn’t even bring himself to care all that much.
“I’m not gay,” a freshly turned 18 year old Dean rushed out in a panic while sitting inside the back of a strangers car with his hand still sticky wrapped around the other man’s cock and the reminder of $30 weighing heavily in his jacket pocket.
Dean's story was incredible.
“What else is there to say? You're pissed, you've made that very clear. But I’m not going through with it so what’s it even matter now? I told you and Sam we’d try and find another way. End of story.” Dean tried to push past him again looking for an escape, but a heavy hand dropped on his shoulder and forced him back in place.
So no, the angel wasn't surprised to hear it, but Dean's expression had shifted as if he said something life-changing, like a sudden weight had been lifted off his shoulders because of
“Not for that,” Cas corrects him, and Dean’s suddenly puzzled. There’s something akin to amusement in those blue eyes for a fleeting moment at Dean’s reaction before something more serious takes over. Dean is hopelessly mesmerized by his next worlds. “For letting me stay here with you in the bunker. I want you to know... there’s nowhere I’d rather be.”
And it was in the way Dean was looking at him right now. That was all the proof Castiel needed.
And that was
"Dean?" Castiel called softly into the receiver, now adding a hint of worry to the mess of emotions already racing through him. It sounded like Dean was driving. Maybe he had gone into shock.
Dean dipped his head with a smirk, bumped his forehead against Cas’s, teased, “I guess I didn’t need the mistletoe after all.”
“Hey, Dean?”
thorough full body check up with his fingers and his tongue and his
but every time he got close to actually saying it the words got caught in his throat. So Dean went back to his default settings and relied on his preferred method of intimacy to make Castiel understand.
“I’m such an idiot. Always fucking up what’s most important to me.”
“I’m not gay,” Dean quietly tells his Mom when they’re in the Impala together driving back to the bunker after finishing a mother-son hunting trip. It had only been three days since Castiel almost died from the Lance of Michael in that barn and made what they all thought was a deathbed goodbye speech to the three remaining Winchesters.
The two of them slid under the covers together and settled in for the night, Dean on his right side and Cas snuggled up behind him. With the light turned out the room became shrouded in darkness, a comforting sort of quiet blanketed around them.
Cas’s lips twisted into a conspiratorial little smirk as he jutted his chin out in front of him, gave a small nod towards the city, told Dean to, “Look,” and Dean did just that.
“Are you alright?” It was a stupid question, the angel knew that, but it opened up the door for Dean to be able to say whatever it was he needed to say to process the heartache he had suffered and try to work through it.
Sam's recovery from the initial shock was much quicker than Dean's, and despite the obvious suspicion in his voice, Sam diligently took note of Cas’ directions, and soon enough both Winchesters were on their way to meet him.
The thing was Dean knew they had failed today. Not being able to kill their unforgiving God or even trap him—Chuck had painted the boys into a corner. Dean didn’t blame Sam for what happened. He believed his brother, believed that whatever Chuck showed him scared him shitless about their future if something were to happen to God himself. So Dean told his little brother they’d find another way. There had to be something they could do. There was always another way. Now more than ever Dean was willing to fight for their future, for a better world. They would beat Chuck (whatever that meant now) Dean was certain. Today was another set back. Another door of opportunity slammed in their face.
"Do you want to talk about it?" Cas asked him, unbearably kind and patient, like he'd gladly spend the whole night discussing Dean's issues without complaint. Son of a bitch would, too, if Dean had asked.
Dean's
Dean fell deeper and deeper for this strange being he was fortunate enough to call a friend and it wouldn't
“Not yet. But there’s still plenty of time,” Castiel lied, already decided on a Greaser from the 50s. Because Dean in leather? That was something Cas would very much like to see.
Cas had his eyes closed as he stepped into the spray, much like Dean a few minutes ago, he appeared to be savouring every single moment of the peace and quiet. Tufts of brown hair flattened over his forehead as he soaked his head, making him look excessively adorable to Dean who had to fight the urge not to reach out and brush them back with his fingers. Not yet, anyway. Castiel looked relaxed. It was a significant moment in Dean’s mind, one worthy of remembrance. Seeing this look on his face was so rare these days. Dean would take whatever he could get.
The muscles in Castiel’s stomach jumped as Dean lathered and massaged the skin. He felt the angel release a deep breath, and when Dean chanced a look up at his face he realized Cas had closed his eyes again. He was enjoying this, and that gave Dean the confidence to slowly turn Cas around and start the same process again down his back and around his hips.
"Do you like that?" Cas prompted, grazing his teeth along Dean's left butt cheek, adding a light nip just to watch the hunter squirm. "Want me to fuck you with my tongue?"
“Hey,” Dean says.
—could withstand any trial or tribulation they collectively had to suffer through.
Dean's head fell back onto his shoulder and Castiel used it to his advantage, breathing heavily into his ear, whispering dirty words between them. "I want you to come all over your precious Impala. Mark her up. She'll be even more beautiful than before. Just like you when your hole is dripping with my come. Do it now."
“I know,” Mary says back after a moment just as softly, and Dean’s relief, though palpable in the moment, is also twinged by sadness. He’s startled out of the feeling that’s bordering dangerously close to becoming disappointment by Mary resting her hand gently on Dean’s knee. She can’t bring herself to look at her son with all the guilt still clawing and gnawing away at her insides, but she means it with every fiber of her being when she tells him, “But it would be okay if you were.”
Dean held his gaze, eyes red and puffy. "I lost you, too."
To show Cas he could lean on the hunter like he used to, show him he was there, Dean consciously made a choice to press their knees together under the table for support. If Dean was being honest with himself (which he was getting better at, evidently) he was just as disturbed to hear all of this as Cas. He needed that anchor of physical connection to keep him grounded. When Dean felt pressure push back against his leg, he knew Cas understood and accepted the gesture wholeheartedly.
Despite his anxiousness to find out exactly what had happened, Cas suggested that Dean take a nice long shower and change into something more comfortable before getting into it because frankly, he was a mess.
if you asked Dean, because Dean could hardly take his eyes off him, was so obvious about it earlier this afternoon in the kitchen when Cas invited himself to be a backseat baker, practically perching himself on Dean’s shoulder, that Dean almost left the pumpkin pie in the oven for too long, resulting in a crispier crust than he would have liked.
That was the first night Dean tried pegging. He kinda liked that too.
Oh, Dean was interested. He was
Castiel heard Sam question his brother once again before he heard the sound of shuffling clothing and swiping of the phone. "Who is this?" the new voice demanded.
Dean was still on his knees, his fingernails scraping helplessly at the loose dirt by his sides. The hunter took slow deep breaths when he started to feel overwhelmed by the angel's heavy presence behind him. He didn't look back, even when Castiel quietly began speaking to him.
Castiel dipped his head and brushed his lips against the hunter's shoulder. It was barely a kiss, a ghost of a chill, yet Dean found comfort in the touch. Physical contact was good. Dean could work with that, keep himself distracted.
“About time,” Cas breathes, then fully seals their lips together, silencing Dean’s punched out huff of laughter. As appealing as standing here and making up on lost time making out with Cas was, Dean had a tactfully better idea that didn’t involve either one of them freezing their asses off. When Dean was the one to pull back this time there was a brief look of irritation on Castiel’s face, impatience bleeding through, greedy for more.
Dean could feel the heat starting to pool in his abdomen and knew he wouldn’t be able to last much longer. Castiel circled his tongue each time his mouth descended on Dean’s cock and hummed again when he felt Dean’s thighs heavily blocking him in on either side.
Dean wasn't sure if it was the comment about him or his car that pushed him over the edge, but he went crashing over it all the same. Every muscle tightening up and spasming as he clenched down on Castiel's dick, streaking the hood of the Impala in white stripes as the angel fucked him through it.
“No. It’s not," Cas argued fiercely, and the passionate determination in his voice forced Dean to look at him, to see the hurt and betrayal he had been trying to avoid since he learned that Sam had told Cas the truth. "You weren’t even going to tell me about this ridiculous plan of yours. You were going to sail off into the middle of the ocean and get Sam to lock you in a box and toss you overboard without even saying goodbye to me!"
When the hunter pulled back there was a grin on his face as he said, “No arguments here” and was quickly pulled back into another heated kiss.
Castiel went willingly as Dean guided him away, party all but forgotten. Dean felt a firm squeeze to his hand, looked back at his new beginning, heart swelling, felt a snowflake land on his eyelash as Cas told him, “That sounds wonderful.”
When Cas unknowingly put the miniature reindeer with the funny red nose at the very back of Santa’s sleigh team Sam nearly bit the poor guy’s head off. Dean made a note right after to go out and buy a copy of Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer on DVD the next day.
All at once the tension seeped from Castiel's posture and the anger that had previously been occupying his facial expressions morphed into a look of deep remorse that Dean didn't fully understand.
“I’m not gay,” Dean jokes half-heartedly after handing Cas his favorite Led Zeppelin mixtape and receiving an amused smirk from his younger brother shortly after Cas has left the room. Sam teases him for it—it’s his duty as a little brother after all—but Dean doesn’t seem bothered by it. The affectionate little smile on the angel’s face as he gratefully accepted Dean’s gift with a brush of their finger tips was all Dean could really bring himself to care about in the moment.
This was Castiel’s first time celebrating Christmas since he made the decision to give up his grace and retire with them—or
Dean desperately wanted to let Castiel's words heal every part of him that felt utterly broken right now, but all he could think about was what happened the last time they thought they were going to win.
Cas had really taken to this new bossy role while fucking the hunter and if Dean didn't so obviously get off on it, he'd accuse Cas of being a little too good at it. But it wasn't necessarily about being in a position of power that Cas found so enjoyable. It was Dean's willingness to submit to him. Dean's ability to trust Castiel and take his orders without hesitation. Castiel felt liberated every time he barked out an order and Dean would comply, eager for it judging by the way his eyes would gloss over and there'd be an underlining thrum of excitement rolling off of him in waves.
No. No way. Cas was an angel. He couldn’t feel romantic love in the same way humans did. Did Mary think there was something going on between them? There wasn’t. There couldn’t be. Dean needed Mary to understand that. He needed someone to convince him of it himself.
Castiel reached around Dean's hips and blindly unbuckled his belt, tugging the jeans down until they pooled around Dean's ankles, leaving the hunter in his boxer briefs and still fully clothed from the waist up. Castiel took his time sliding his hands up the back of Dean's thighs, revelling in the way the muscles stuttered under his firm touch before moving higher up, sweeping over the curve of Dean's ass and hooking two thumbs in the waistband of Dean's underwear.
The one thing Cas wanted was his all along.
’ printed in bold black letters on the front. He found it on the rack at some old thrift store last week while out shopping with Sam and his sister in law. Naturally, Dean had found a sharpie and drew an extra E on it. It was two sizes too big for him. Dean thought it was hilarious. Cas was willing to compromise this year around with the promise of being able to pick a full costume for Dean next year.
“I’m not gay,” Dean sneered in disgust to a young boy who once tried to hold his hand in the 5
"No thanks to you," Dean snarled back, his voice raw with emotion. A moment of silence passed between them. Dean could practically feel the guilt radiating off of Castiel as he apologized in a deflated tone.
And that’s how they got here. Thinking back on it, Dean felt a little embarrassed by how
“Thank you.”
It took Dean a painfully long second to realize Castiel wasn't passing the blame onto him, he just wanted Dean to understand his own actions and realize that it wasn't as black and white as
By no means was this the first greeting Castiel would have imagined (hoped) coming from the hunter, had he let himself indulge in such selfish pondering, but my
As soon as Dean opened his mouth to pray his emotions overwhelmed him. The anger he had been feeling for days about Mary, and Chuck, and
“Fuck, Cas. I’m gonna-” Dean interrupted himself with a deep moan, throwing his head back and feeling all of his muscles lock up with his release.
Dean slipped away from the group under the charade that he was going to refill their water bottles. Dean's entire body was in over drive, elation and crippling grief destabilizing him as he stumbled to the edge of a nearby stream.
His father was gone, and Castiel wasn’t going to pretend he knew what Dean needed to heal from that, but whatever decision he made, whatever Dean chose to do from this moment on, it would be neither right nor wrong, just something he has to do for himself, and Castiel would honor that to the best of his abilities.
The silky fabric restricting his movement was erotic, to say the least. This wasn't a new game the two of them were playing. Castiel had been unabashedly vocal about finding out all of Dean's kinks, and the hunter went along with it because why the hell wouldn't he?
"Spread your legs for me," Castiel growled hotly into Dean's ear, making the hunter groan and grind his hips back against Castiel's erection pressing against his ass. "Be patient, Dean. I'll give you what you want."
Without a word of complaint Castiel guided Dean over to the bed and waited until Dean was comfortable under the covers to ask for permission to join him.
In a desperate attempt to stop the hellish downward spiral of his thoughts into self-loathing and deprecation, Dean leaned in and sealed his lips to Castiel's. The angel responded by holding him even tighter, trying to transfer every bit of reassurance that he could through their kiss. And for a fleeting moment Dean let himself believe in it. But the truth was they didn't know what was coming next.
Castiel moved back and watched as he slowly slid both of his fingers out of the hunter's pink slick hole. The angel decided he was stretched far enough — even if he wasn't, Cas knew Dean liked the burn. Castiel stood up from where he was crouching and freed himself from his pants, pushing them down his thighs just far enough to expose his straining cock, the tip already shiny from precome. Cas lined himself up and steadily sank into the warm, tight heat that was his hunter.
The angel somehow managed to smirk even with his mouth stuffed full with cock and took pity on the hunter, bobbing his head up and down, finding a nice rhythm for both of them and making use of his lack of gag reflex. Dean started swiveling his hips in small circles that Castiel allowed for the time being.
Castiel angled Dean’s head back under the spray and rinsed out his hair, taking extra precautions to avoid getting any soap into his eyes while he worked. Once he was finished the angel pressed a kiss against Dean’s neck, right below his Adam's apple, and Dean was in such a state of bliss he nearly dropped to the damn floor. “Dean,” Cas called him softly, and Dean knew this was the moment he had been waiting for. It was all or nothing.
“We’ll be okay,” Cas promised, and Dean believed him, because now he knew exactly what to call them.
. Not just his resurrection, but his death as well, and everything that happened in between.
Sam had died. Sam
excelled at. Cas because sometimes he didn’t quite understand what he was feeling or how to properly express himself (You couldn’t hold it against him, it was an angel thing) And Dean because he always knew
But compared to me, Castiel is the real angel walking the earth.
I've been thinking that ever since inherited the earth, where do I go from here?
"Come on, Dean," Sam said, "isn't there anything you're hiding from Cass either?  You wouldn't even show up at the hunters' party, and I'm equally unaware of what's happened since you've been in Heaven all this time, except with Cas, which doesn't surprise me, but back then? with all those things happened before we came to heaven, like how Cas summoned the Empty, that you've never told me about."
Sam and Dean are continuing their family business of saving people, and I missed them. Last week, I sensed them near a vampire lair before I finished dealing with all that stuffs above.
Dean put down his phone, "Faster than I thought."
Paradise Pizza Express, the fastest way you can meet an angel.
"No!" Alfie answered immediately, "But if it doesn't matter, I have my next order." He gestures to his work cap, which reads "Paradise Express Delivery.
Ah, if you're a soul condemned to hell?
I was thinking about the stars, you know, above the universe...but I never really placed myself as the Almighty or God.
*Started recording? Sam waved an 'OK' gesture behind the video camera.
"Not at all," Alfie replied, "we did originally think that would be a problem, but they get along so well now, we just left them alone."
There was a long, long silence, "First of all, I wouldn't have said that," Cass replied, "and secondly, Billie broke in and killed us all."
"Three of them?"
"But that was last week, and I took you to brunch, remember?"
The décor of the bunker gave him the feeling of being back on Earth, where he and Sam were sitting in that secret base in Lebanon, Kansas, always with an endless list of things to do at hand. Not saying that was a good thing, but suddenly one day you die, your soul goes to heaven, and something feels like it's been missed forever.
"Ca... What, Castiel?" Dean repeated the question incredulously, " How do I know that Chuck created it, Cassie's variation? Go ask the stars, I bet Cas doesn't know neither."
Sam could clearly see Dean froze, "Why would he know something that I don't even know?"
-------
"I know, I know, man, their car is awesome! Sam and Dean, right?"
He shrugged, "You might just forget, Dean."
People always have questions, and the answers will be in each of them. They aspire to harmony and balance. When Sam sees me again, I answer, "I am me, the power of Chuck and Amara are upon the skies, circling the universe like a Binary star, and won’t be hands-on. "
And patted me on the shoulder, which was very warm.
Sam swiveled his swivel chair in front of the table, and watched Dean come down the stairs.
"My name is Dean Winchester, this is Castiel, and we're doing a...couple therapy."
We'd go out on cases together, I usually partnering up with Sam, and we'd talk about funny things that had happened before. One time, Sam asked Dean, "Dude, you gotta tell me the truth when you first met Cas at Lucifer and Michael's apocalypse time, have you ever imagined any of these would happen?”
"For humans...people, yes."
"Couple therapy."
Rufus, who hadn't actually seen Sam and Dean for a long time, once asked Bobby, "Who's that chap in the trench coat with Dean all the time?"
"What did I tell you, he's hiding something from me! This whole Bill Harrison and his happy family isn't in trouble at all," Dean asked, after noticing Sam's seemingly amused expression, "Why you look so unconcerned, does that sound like a good thing to you?"
"Dean," Sam replied to him, "you know that death is never the end, right? I mean, yes, this is heaven, but you're still here, still living here, living in a better place, a place where you can finally get the vacation you dreamed of. In our world, while we're 'alive' we make it a better place, and when we leave, those legacies don't just disappear. In the bunker, in the Earth's bunker, there are still hunters out there being trained to carry on the legacy, just like we did then."
You see...the emptiness doesn't like me that much.
"So I pretend they never happened, pretend I don't care, there's no emptiness, no goodbyes, no regrets, just my new life in heaven with Cass."
Now his expression looked even worse.
Sam pushed the door open, Dean sat back in his chair, and Cas unconsciously moved to the side. It was as if there existed an invisible glass, which now had the word "embarrassment" written all over it.
-------
"Seems like you already knew that..."
People don't usually find out that the man in the trench coat in the Team Freewill is an angel, (just as they can't find out that Jack isn't even 3 years old yet) after all, angels don't feel like angels these days. Although the name that starts with capital "A" is still striking, holy, and sacred, who doesn't like harps, celestial music, girls in white dresses, and gleaming wings? --though you don't see any of those above in Cas. Perhaps Michelangelo's Judgment Day is more authentically.
At that moment I realized that my consciousness would be crossing the stars, connecting the glory of heaven and the fires of hell, from nothingness to another time and space, my power connecting the depths of the earth and the edges of the universe, I am the embodiment and guardian of this world.
"Yeah," Dean glanced at his fingers as he continued, "I mean, Cass, there's a lot of things out there that I never had the chance to have," he gestured to Cass, "little bars, freedom, and most importantly, you." He said, genuinely, "I want to experience them with you, to experience all these things I never had the chance to have, not just in heaven, but before, at one time, and I want to make up for all the regrets I had before."
When heaven was upgraded to 2.0 mode, the angels began to live their own lives, and in order to provide a happy heaven for atheists who in this materialism world, the angels do not just say to others: "Hello, I am an angel!"
"My brother - Dean! He's had a crush on his best friend for twelve years," he's chatting with Ash and then making some funny and exaggerated gestures with his hands, "because he thought," and now his face is getting very beat up, with a very stiff accent, as if he's mimicking Cass's speech, that "Angels don't feel the love!"
Dean said, "And we never leave family behind.”
The next reaper to die will take the place of Death and take charge of my book of life and death. People ascend to Heaven or head to Hell, and Purgatory is the eternal gladiatorial arena of monsters, where they will be constantly reborn and reborn, but the final destination for soulless beings is eternal nothingness, and the good news is that I can help it fall into sleep——just as it has always demanded.
"No more questions, keys, inventory, and the drunks who come here every day," Pamela spread her hands, "I guarantee this place will be absolutely as broken when you get back as it is now."
“Do you want to see mine?” Castiel starts rolling back his coat sleeve even before he’s finished speaking. Dean instantly nods vigorously, face lighting up all over again.
“Last one.”
you. It has nothing to do with this. With us. What we
But lately, just lately, he’s started saying it like it’s a prayer. A supplication. Sometimes he breathes out
“How’re you feeling?” He asks, while pressing the back of his hand to Cas’ forehead. “You’re a lot more talky than you have been for a while.”
. Has been shoving it into a box in the back of his mind for years, taping around it with layer upon layer of alcohol and denial the more it grew and split the box at the seams. Since he ripped that box open and let it loose, it’s been a wild, uncontrollable thing. No analogy he’s ever heard can put words to it. It’s fire in his blood, a storm in his heart, a drug intoxicating his brain, blue as a summer sky, green as the spring, gold as daylight, all of them and so much more than them all at once.
“Good,” he mumbles.
Cas rolls his eyes, leans to wind the window down so the fresh air buffets his face, drowns out Dean’s stupid voice.
“Since I was a teenager Sam, I’m not a moron.” Dean swigs his beer, movements viciously sharp.
“Hello Castiel,” Marv holds Castiel by the shoulders and looks him up and down. “You look pale, are you well?”
Dean closes his eyes and nods. Cas immediately slips Dean’s flannel down his shoulders and works him out of it. He moves on to efficiently pulling Dean’s t-shirt off, but as Dean’s head pops free from the material, Cas leans forward and kisses his forehead. He lingers against Dean’s skin and runs his hand down Dean’s naked spine, pressing kiss and hand so hard against Dean’s skin it almost hurts.
Dean blushes scarlet again but a sheepish smile tugs the corner of his mouth and he leans slightly into Castiel’s hand.
“The chicken in the fridge is for tomorrow, don’t touch it,” she says, brusque. “You can use any of the vegetables and the leftover fish for dinner. Don’t leave the washing up, do it as soon as you’re finished eating. And don’t stay up late again, you know we have church in the morning.”
“Cas, over here!”
So he’s wrapped around Cas’ little finger. That’s ok by him.
“I guess I should wear a suit around the bunker more often then.” He glances over and meets Cas’ gaze just as he turns to squint up at Dean in confusion. Dean grins, turns his eyes back to the road. “I mean, you know I want to give you things you like.”
there was nothing else he
“Oh is that what this is about?” Sam glances over at her, wide eyed. “No, dude, he’s really not.”
“Darlin’, I practically raised those two idjits.” There’s a sudden tenderness in his gruff voice so deep that hearing it shivers a strange flash of vertigo through Meg’s stomach. “Believe me, if anyone knows what’s goin’ on between ‘em it’s me.”
Cas huffs, staggers back pulling Dean along with him. He doesn’t stop kissing Dean, and for a few steps they stumble over each other, lips locked, before Dean pushes Cas away with a monumental effort of will and propels him towards their room.
“Do you think he’s…
“I always wear it,” Dean explains, running his finger along the ridge of the amulet’s horn. “Don’t feel like myself without it.”
Dean thought it might be a little on the nose to place a suspiciously similar looking angel figure of Castiel on top of the tree, and after Cas had given him
Dean wanted that. Wanted Cas to pin him to the bed and touch him in all the right places, kiss him until he couldn’t remember his own name, fuck him,
He’s not Daddy’s blunt instrument anymore. Cas loves him. He isn’t hatred. Cas loves him. He isn’t destruction. Cas loves him. He deserves to be happy.
get him the baby angel painted on a dark blue bulb, stereotype complete with a halo and fluffy white wings.
Dean threw the towel onto the floor harder than necessary as he turned his body around, only now realizing Castiel was a lot closer than the mirror let on. Dean brushed past him in a huff just as the angel was about to open his mouth, and set about taking off his shoes and kicking them under the bed. Dean had just started working on unbuckling his belt when Castiel's peeved words carried across the room at him.
“All right, all right. Get offa me, ya moose.”
“Rudy Duncan,” Dean declares.
Dean groaned and buried his face in Castiel's stomach for a minute before giving up and letting himself roll off the couch. Castiel folded the afghan and Dean chugged a dose of ichor straight from the bottle while his back was turned. He gagged and Castiel turned a critical eye to him.
“You play?” she asks, rolling her eyes fondly at him. He hopes it’s fond, it’s hard to tell with teenagers. If he didn’t have somewhere to be, Dean would probably talk her ear off.
“You knew my mom?” Dean knows his face is scrunched in an unattractive twist, but he can’t wrap his head around what Chuck is saying.
Gilda touches Castiel’s arm gently and takes the remaining hex tiles from Castiel’s hand. “Let her have her fun, Cas. She’s ok.”
"Come in, Alice," Sam gestures the girl inside.
“Put it on, Sammy,” Dean cackles, “It’s custom. Moose-sized.”
“Anyway, when they got around to having us, they got it in their heads to form their own little Partridge Family. First instrument I ever learned was the tambourine. Sounds lame, I know, but man was I cute. Stole the show every time.”  He feels more relaxed talking about his family and settles back into his seat.
He scrabbles at Dean’s arms, clutches uselessly at Dean’s shirt, his jacket, Dean’s hands as he holds him up, cradles his head. Darkness eats at the edges of his vision.
Next to him Cas chuckles a little.
would always know that voice.
“I’m fine Dean.”
“Hey,” Dean jogs his elbow again and smiles, though it’s a shadow of his shining grin that knocks Cas breathless. “One thing we’ve got going for us – the site’s a few hours from here. He’s living in the workers’ accommodation, put me and Sammy out here where it’s cheaper. He won’t be back here to check on me much.” He pauses, weighs his words for a second. “Probably won’t be back at all, honestly. Not till he decides to go.”
“Not gonna promise I’ll stop.”
This time Dean knows exactly what to do with it. He slides his arms around Cas’ back, presses his nose into his hair and breathes in the warm, familiar smell of him. “Love you,” he mumbles into Cas’ temple. And against his neck he feels the curve of Cas’ smile.
His feet lead him down the mainstreet, heading south. He crosses several intersections but the tug doesn’t waver from guiding him straight south. Only when he finally reaches the big park on the river does it change, drawing him along the winding paths under the leafless trees towards the riverbank.
Dean never can resist those eyes.
in his ear
“Wanna tell me why you were flirting with that waiter?” Dean’s voice is admonishing, but the crinkle around his eyes and the bright tap of his fingers on the steering wheel bely his faked irritation.
Besides, embarrassingly cliché as it is, Castiel knows he would run away with Dean this second if Dean asked him to.
“I feel like I’m intruding on the world’s most sickening double date,” Balthazar grumpily says to Meg as he takes the seat next to her. “I don’t know who’s worse, the honeymooning girlfriends or the bickering boyfriends.”
There’s a noise from the doorway and Dean looks up. Cas is framed in the arch with his phone out, suspiciously pointed right at Dean.
“Yes?” He hazards.
His conjured image of her in his mind’s eye scrolls through his phone history, picking out traces of his deviation from her rules.
brown eyes and artlessly curly hair. Meg’s finally alone with Bobby at their table. She takes her chance immediately.
It’s the first day they don’t slip away from each other at all. From that first touch to the moment he falls asleep, Castiel’s filled with rushes of tenderness, bubbling joy, a lazy comfortable warmth that makes Castiel feel as if he’s turned his face to the sun. It heats Castiel so completely that by lunchtime the chill of the morning might as well have been a bad dream. When his mind wanders in class, daydreaming as he watches the trees outside the window swaying in the breeze, the feeling turns teasing, amused at his distraction. Later, when he’s making himself pbj sandwiches in defiance of Naomi’s reminder to use up the leftover stew he doesn’t like for dinner and imagining himself in his own kitchen, his soulmate cooking next to him, close enough to touch, it’s bright and fond, so full of energy Cas finds himself bouncing on his heels and moving to a music he can’t hear. When he goes to bed that night, he falls asleep with sleepy warmth filling him up to the fingertips and a smile curling the corner of his mouth.
Cas pulls Dean’s socks off along with his boots. He leans over to drop the socks into the laundry basket, then places the boots by the desk where Dean normally leaves them. He takes a moment to nudge them straight and tidy with his knuckles and something about the knowing domesticity of that brief action finally soothes the anxious churn in Dean’s chest to a low tremble.
Tugging his sleeve back down and smothering his smile before he draws attention to himself, Castiel tabs back to the search results. Adding
“You’ve still got your boots on.” Cas scowls down at Dean’s feet, slithers gracelessly off the bed to tug at his shoes. Dean props himself onto his elbows, intending to lean forward and help, but once he catches sight of Cas he forgets what he was meaning to do. Cas has Dean’s right foot in his lap. His hair’s wild, skin flushed, shirt hanging open off his shoulders, delightfully dishevelled, and he’s poking at Dean’s knotted laces with the most ridiculous baffled expression, like he cannot fathom how he’s supposed to fix the problem he’s faced with. It’s so endearing Dean’s brain momentarily blanks out with affection.
A voice whispers up out of the pits of Dean’s memory before he can shove it back down into the dark. Slurring drunk, tobacco rough, the stench of cheap lager on stale breath ghosting over his cheek with the words.
Cas came off worse against a flying grandfather clock, and his entire left side aches. Dean’s already done a field assessment and declared him just bruised, which Cas trusts because Dean’s prone to flipping out like Cas is dying when he sneezes these days, but it hurts deep in his flesh and he feels like he can’t draw a proper breath. Dean flutters around him, dosing him with painkillers and helping him into his pyjamas and wrapping him in blankets. Cas would complain,
Something in the deepest recesses of Dean’s memory cracks open. It spills out hands on his throat, drunken breath in his ear, fingers hard and aggressive in his hair, words -
him to see, to touch, to claim.
“Fine thank you.” She flicks her eyes over Castiel. Castiel holds his face carefully blank, forces his shoulders to stay loose and relaxed under her scrutiny. Whatever Naomi reads from him must pass muster, because she just nods once and turns towards the entrance hall and the door to her downstairs office.
Then, with all the inevitability of contrary fate, Castiel’s phone rings.
Cas finally breaks the long silence with a turn of his head to breathe in Dean’s ear. “I do miss being able to see your soul.”
Castiel moves without conscious thought. He lifts his right hand and presses his fingers into the very centre of Dean’s mark, right over his spine.
Dean makes Cas eat some toast with honey –
Cas whispers into the sudden silence.
Dean twitches a little, self-conscious. Picks at a thread on his sweats. “I could see you looking. At those. And.” Dean stops, flushes a little.
Dean shoves past him, grabs Cas’ hand and pulls him up. He turns to the man without letting go, holding Cas behind him.
Cas doesn’t look up from his work, but his fingers tighten on Dean’s shoulder and Dean visibly relaxes, muscles easing and shoulders drooping until he’s slumped loose in his chair.
“Dean, what’s wrong?” Cas cradles Dean’s face in his palms. He’s so close his forearms brush Dean’s chest and Dean can smell the fresh, raw scent of him. Something like pine and the electric taste of air after a storm, cloaked in the human normality of clean clothes and coffee and Dean’s shampoo.
“Fucking god you fuck me up,” he mumbles into the curve of Cas’ collarbone. Cas laughs a little in response, his chest rumbling against Dean’s nose.
Cas leans up to press a kiss to the turn of Dean’s jaw and Dean smiles, easy.
Cas watches him for a few steps, notes the redness of Dean’s fingers, the slight hunch to his shoulders that give the lie to his words.
“Benny knew too,” Cas adds quietly, which prompts a snort from Dean and one of Benny’s small, private smiles.
He pulls out his phone and is thumbing the button to unlock it when Dean’s words filter through into his conscious mind.
His older sister rolls her eyes whenever she catches him looking at it for too long.
I have faith in anymore?” He detaches a hand from Dean’s hipbone and rests his palm against Dean’s cheek. His thumb presses gently into Dean’s lower lip while his fingers run tender lines across his temple. The light touch feels like a brand on his skin.
“How many people knew about this?”
Dean needs a new suit. His old standby FBI getup lost a fight with a really angry kitsune out in Missouri. Since it’s pretty much on their route home, Dean pit stops in Kansas City to pick up a replacement. Sam’s needed some new smart shirts for a while and he figures Cas deserves some clothes that aren’t his cast-offs or thrifted, so they might as well hit up a city centre and get all the shopping done in one go.
Cas turns his head towards him, nose brushing Dean’s ear in silent question. Dean smiles and pulls him a little closer. “This
Dean sucks in a shaky breath, swallows hard.
And Dean feels like the worst excuse for a human for being too drunk to remember their first time properly.
“I fuckin’ hate my birthday Cas, you and Sam should know-“
That only makes it worse. He wants desperately to let them know it’s okay, it’s always okay to not be okay. He wants to hold their hand and run his fingers through their hair and say he just wants to be there for them, he

here. From all he’s ever heard, all he vaguely remembers from the compulsory health and relationship classes in school, soul bonds only activate when partners are in close physical proximity, as close as a hundred metres or so. That’s when the colours first show, growing brighter the closer the two come to each other and finally glowing with inner light when they touch. But. His mark’s colours are still faint. They’re clearly there, unmistakable, unignorable. But they’re no brighter or fainter than they were when he first set eyes on them.
“Does it … does it still scare you?”
Huffing, Castiel shakes the thought of Naomi from his head and puts the half-finished plate on the bedside table. He really should go and clean it up given Naomi’s pointed order, but he’s so
“For fuck’s sake Dean will you
“Nearly fuckin’ died Cas.” Dean slides his trembling hands up to cup Cas’ jaw. “Again.”
After they’re done puttering about town, they head out to a garden centre near the highway. Dean lets Cas drag him around the whole place exclaiming over plants and telling him about the history of food cultivation on earth from a first-hand perspective, and the importance of bees in pollination, and doesn’t complain once.
It’s only when Dean’s about to brush it off, pick himself up, throw up his walls and leave on the excuse of making breakfast, that Cas finally manages to make himself move.
And there’s something about that absolute gravity in his tone, even in the middle of a casual conversation, that catches on her ribs and draws her in. Oh he’s pretty this one, blue eyes and bed hair and fine muscles under that loose t shirt, but he’s also strange and serious and curious, that much she can tell just from sitting by him for two hours in a chilly lecture hall, watching him flip through his textbook and make notes on subjects completely unrelated to whatever the hell the lecturer was waffling about.
Green.
But Cas just laughs softly and shakes his head, says “no, he’s still not my boyfriend,” and Meg supposes she’s meant to believe there’s someone else. She can’t see how though. With all the time Cas spends with Dean, there’s no way he’s fitting in a boy or girlfriend on the side. Probably he was just trying to find a way of saying no to her that was gentler than a flat
Dean nods, eyes creasing thoughtfully. “Sounds about right for flu. You’re going to feel like crap for a while yet. Sorry, sweetheart.”
They’ve been best friends for over a decade now, and crossing that line to lovers is so fucking bizarre. Kissing is fine, amazing,
Where the park ends and the trail peters out into a slush-slicked pavement alongside a main road, a pair of trees make a narrow arch over the path. Dean hangs back to let Castiel pass through first. As he moves under, the branches overhead rustle and he looks up, step pausing. There’s a bird on a twig just over his head, feathers puffed against the cold. It chirps briefly, hops on the branch, flicks its wings and flutters away. Castiel turns to watch it, smiling, tipping his head back to watch its silhouette shrink against the low clouds. When he looks back down it’s to find Dean watching him in turn, eyes thoughtful and not quite a smile hovering around his lips.
Dean pauses in the doorway. Cas is there on the bed, just as Dean pictured him earlier, sprawled over the turned-down duvet with his hair uncombed and nose stuck in an enormous leatherbound hardback, wearing a ratty old t-shirt and the ridiculous pyjama pants with bees on that Dean bought as a joke and Cas immediately started wearing constantly.

It’s as strong as anything he’s ever felt. It pulses in his blood, runs up the back of his throat to dry his mouth, into his eyes to spring burning tears that half blind him. But it’s not
Dean lets him disappear around the curve of the corridor, counts out enough interminable seconds for Sam to make it to his door, to go inside and be distracted by Eileen’s welcoming grin. Then Dean bolts for his own room.
Castiel has no idea how to put that across as an emotion, no clue where to even start. Instead, he presses his hand to his chest to hold down the tide of sorrow and tries to layer himself over with a façade of every gentle emotion he can bring to bear. Acceptance, concern, affection, anything he can pull out of his still shaky heart. His soulmate seems to sag in response, the presence inside Castiel softening at the edges with tired relief. With that comes a return of the ache in Castiel’s shoulder, a welling up of exhausted sadness that weighs him down. If he closes his eyes, Castiel can almost feel their weight leaning on him, the shake of their shoulders under his palm, the heat of their tears soaking into his shirt.
Sam huffs. “You’re wearing Dean’s Led Zeppelin t-shirt. It’s vintage.”
to have an unfaltering presence to rely on, even if it is only inside his heart. How they might feel the same.
” Cas smiles so wide it hurts. “Your birthday is supposed to be one of the most important days of your life. I think this fits.”
touching him for weeks.
“He’s not my
Cas hums for a moment, eyes thoughtful, then he nods once. “I think that’s why it’s called making love, Dean.”
Cas looks up from putting the tinned tomatoes into the cupboard. Dean is supposed to be sorting the bags onto the counter so Cas can put them away. Instead he’s just holding a box and staring at it with a grin on his face.
“Okay, Dean.” Cas whispers. It’s not a question, but it’s not a statement either. The way Cas breathes it, quiet and calm into Dean’s lips, here where there’s only the two of them to witness it, it feels like a vow.
Dean’s discomfort makes a sudden startling sense. Castiel has never been unsure of who he is. Perhaps he wasn’t precisely aware of it as a child, but that was only because he’d never had much cause to think about it. As soon as he was old enough to really consider, to really understand, he was sure of which way his heart turned. So no matter how anxious he’d been about seeing his soulmate’s face for the first time, he’d at least known one basic thing about who he’d meet.
He pushes Dean gently, hands slipping over Dean’s back to hold his shoulders. Dean blinks and scrubs his eyes, nodding blearily. He pulls himself upright, turns to look down at his feet. He needs to change, and the first step in that has to be taking his boots off. But his feet are so far away and he can’t find the energy to lean down and wrestle with his laces. He rests his elbows on his knees and stares stupidly at those laces, wondering if he can just flop down and sleep fully dressed. It would be far from the first time.
and you’re… you’re very distracting, Dean.”
“My fault.” Dean breathes between his teeth as the thread pulls through his skin, sweat beading his brow. “Wasn’t lookin’.”
“Cas likes waffles,” he mutters.
When Castiel closes his eyes he can almost see other fireworks from another place bursting across the backs of his eyelids and feel the ghost of a touch on his cheek.
Shaking, he pulls himself slowly back upright, glancing around to see if anyone witnessed… whatever that was. To his relief there’s no one in sight and no sound comes from the rows of shelves nearest him. With the kind of luck he’s shown so far in life, he’d almost expected one of his more vindictive classmates to be standing behind him. Probably filming Castiel’s panic to post on whatever the latest social media trend is.
“So what you want me to believe that you realised you’re into guys in your teens and, what? Decided never to do anything about it? Only date women? That’s ridiculous, Dean. Or,” something strikes him and Sam’s expression shifts from irritated to concerned like he flicked a switch. The change does not make Dean feel any less sick about how this conversation is going.
It’s a good night if one of them sleeps more than ninety minutes together, these days.
“Trust you to worry about me when you’ve been out of your head with fever for three days.” Dean leans forward to press a hard, furious kiss onto Cas’ forehead. His hand on Cas’ arm is shaking and water drops onto Cas’ cheek as Dean lingers against his brow. He’s pretty sure it’s not from the bath.
Cas stares up at him, watches Dean’s face flame red, his eyes flick down and to the side, his spine stiffen and fingers curl against the blanket.
Cas’ brow creases in confusion. He looks down at his t-shirt. It is, indeed, Dean’s. Against his back, Dean gulps down his first mouthful of coffee and sighs happily.
“This is so fuckin’ weird,” Dean finally bursts out. “You’ve been inside my head for goddamn months and I’m only just finding out you’re a guy, let alone your name.” Dean shakes his head, scrubs his hands through his hair distractedly, and Castiel’s heart drops into his shoes.
I don’t know… how did you
he’s not really interested in, other than for the fact Dean likes it. Sam doesn’t so much as huff in discontent, just tops up the beers and takes the less comfortable seat with Eileen so Cas and Dean can hog the entire comfortable sofa.
Cas is shaking in his arms. It’s not fear, Dean knows that. Cas stared down a charging werewolf three days ago, waited for it to get close enough to shoot without flinching. Cas doesn’t
“That was a long time ago,” he reminds himself under his breath. “Michael lives in London now.”
Cas leans Dean against the doorframe while he turns on the bathroom light. Even in those two short seconds Dean sways, face turning grey and queasy.
“Of course I did.”
Cas sighs happily, runs one palm lazily up from the small of Dean’s back to cradle the back of his neck.
Cas wakes with a yelp, shooting half upright. He shoves the duvet away with a startled arm, revealing Dean wrapped around him with one hand shoved up the back of Cas’ t-shirt.
“I’m not laughing.” He leans over and wraps his arms around Dean’s shoulders. “Thank you, it was… a wonderful day. Perfect.”
dropping from his lips with a quirk of a smile and a sparkle in his eyes that never appears for anyone else.
Naomi opens her mouth but Castiel cuts in, keeping his eyes trained on his hands putting his mug into the dishwasher.
“Cas, c’mon, Sam’s waiting for us.”
him shiver. “In March? It’s cold up here.”
Sam’s face twists in a particularly sour bitchface and Cas hides his grin in his coffee.
“C’mon, sunshine.” Dean plants another kiss on Cas’ cheek, tugs him towards the corridor with his lips on Cas’ skin and his fingers hooked in Cas’ waistband. Cas doesn’t hesitate. He grabs Dean’s hand, bolts for their room, reeling Dean behind him like this was
He shoves himself up in Dean’s face, red with fury.
(See the end of the chapter for
The first clear touch is cautious, as though they’re worried to overstep after their breakdown, but the second Castiel responds with all the warmth he can muster they relax. Contentment, affection, a gentle swell of yearning rush through him, leaving him feeling like he’s glowing on the inside.
. Dean fell forward crushing his lips to Castiel's, his hands cupping the angel's face, trying to eliminate any and all possible space between their bodies. Cas held them both steady as their lips moved together, a hand sliding down the curve of Dean's spine to rest on the small of his back protectively, the other holding the back of his neck, keeping him just as close.
When Cas starts to thrust into him Dean feels like he’s flying and falling all at the same time, his fingers desperately clutching at the bedsheets as much as they grab onto Cas’s hip, or arm, or back. They move together with ease, Cas pressing in just as Dean rocks back into him at the perfect time. They’re left bare and on display to each other in the most raw and vulnerable form of human connection.
And somewhere in the back of Dean's mind he knew it—knew it wasn't fair to blame Cas, knew that his split second decision to walk away would haunt him forever—but they were alone and Cas was standing right in front of him and he couldn't make himself
"This isn't because of Daphne, is it?" Dean inquired, though he was still able to pull off a smirk when Castiel's eyes narrowed ever so slightly. "Jealousy looks good on you." Dean's smugness was abruptly put to a stop when Castiel hummed deep in his throat, massaging Dean's cock and sending the vibrations tingling up the hunter’s spine. Dean let out an undignified moan and unintentionally pushed his hips forward, trying to get Cas to hurry the fuck up and give him more.
Dean weaved his way through the crowd of animatedly talking and laughing guests to find Claire and Kaia huddled up close together, looking up and admiring the tree. Dean plastered on an easy grin, greeting them with a cheerful, “Hello ladies. Having a good time?” Claire seemed startled as she turned around to face him, too wrapped up in whatever conversation the two were quietly whispering about to notice his approach.
Dean groaned as Castiel bottomed out, he slipped up and let go of his wrists, placing his palms flat against the car to keep himself steady before Cas started drilling into him. Castiel noticed Dean's error immediately, but he was too focused on his own pleasure to dish out any sort of punishment.
It’s not like Dean had
. Knew the life, knew how it would all end. Cas understood because he's lived it, a hell of a lot longer than Dean. He wasn't deluded by happily ever afters. He wasn’t asking Dean for more than he could offer. All he asked for was a chance, and fuck all if Dean wasn’t going to give it to him after
Castiel was letting out quiet little breaths into the skin just behind Dean’s ear, whispering nonsensically about how good Dean felt, how much Cas loved being with him. How much he missed Dean.
right
It was Dean’s favourite dead guy robe. That must have been what Cas left the room to get earlier. Dean’s face split into a grin while Castiel slipped into a robe of his own and the two of them left the bathroom, hand in hand, on their way to Dean’s bedroom. Dean considered throwing on a pair of boxers before getting into bed just in case Sam came knocking in the early hours of the morning, but ultimately decided he’d much rather go commando instead.
“I’m not gay,” Dean smoothly told the older pretty blonde woman at the bar with a small waist and a great wrack when she suggested the two of them invite a third male party to their already agreed upon sexual liaison. Dean thought about it later after they had already parted ways. He could have said yes. It wasn’t gay if there was a woman between them, right?
It was easy enough for Dean to spot Cas leaning on the railing on his arms near the bunker entrance, gazing out at the peaceful winter’s night, a look of contentment clear in the profile of his face. Dean brings his hands up to his mouth and blows on them a couple of times to warm them up—not to, like, stall or anything—and slowly walks over, makes his way to Cas’s left side, nudges him with his elbow as Dean mirrors his lean.
They were finally free to write their own story.
was his win. And this time, Dean was going to tell him.
Taking a moment to steady himself, Dean asked in a whisper, “Are we okay?” If he tried to get anything else out right now Dean was 99.9% sure he wouldn’t be able to make it through without crying again. One breakdown a day was his limit, thank you very much.
dead. Dean had watched his little brother die and then
“Don’t." Dean's fist clenched at his side, fighting himself on what he wanted and what he thought he shouldn't. And when a shaky exhale fanned out over Castiel's thumb, he knew the hunter had made a decision. "Just... come here?”
The angel hallowed out his cheeks and sucked him down
And Dean...
Dean let out a shaky breath, fighting to keep his emotions in check. "Just don't." The silence that followed was deafening, if that makes any sense at all, and Dean found it equal parts comforting as it was nerve wracking.
"Yeah?"
It was ironic Dean thought cynically, that Castiel’s importance to God’s overall story was a complete contrast to Dean’s
with an even more broken
It wasn't startling or intrusive — Dean was used to the lack of personal space between them by now — but it still went unnoticed. That is until Dean turned around from gesturing to the two chairs sitting in the middle of the room and came face to face with the angel, practically knocking into his chest when he spun around to face him.
Christ, when had he become such an open book?
He traced the outline of what he knew to be tanned skin and calloused fingers before repeating the process over again. Even while blindly maneuvering in the darkness, the familiar touch alone was enough to steady him, to keep him grounded to the moment. It was just a bad dream, after all. Dean had plenty of those over the years.
A few more deep thrusts was all it took before Castiel's hips stuttered to a stop and he spilled his seed inside the hunter's pliant body. Castiel kept his hands wrapped around Dean's middle just to keep him close until they both had their breathing back in check.
Dean buried his face in the crook of Castiel’s neck and let himself sag completely into the angel’s strong, capable arms. For the first time in weeks, Dean felt like he was truly living and not just going through the motions, an empty shell of a man beaten down by the world around him. For the first time in weeks, Dean felt
The party was in full swing. Hunters and close friends alike from all over had gathered inside the bunker’s war room to celebrate the holiday season with the Winchesters. Sam had been a little reluctant to throw a party on Christmas Eve because, “They probably already have plans, Dean. No one will show up.” But Dean was adamant that this year they celebrate Christmas properly instead of ignoring its existence like the previous years, and Eileen actually backed Dean on this one, which was a large part of (if not all) the reason Sam conceded to his demands in the first place.
from collected rain water in the gutters overhead lulling him into a state of cautious tranquility.
Hot breath ghosted over his perineum before Castiel's tongue lapped at his hole, punching a surprised moan out of Dean's mouth, but he still had the good sense to keep still, fighting the urge to push back and get more of that sinful tongue on him. Castiel lightly circled the rim with the tip of his tongue, eventually pushing his face in to suck gently at his entrance.
"Please. C'mon, Cas. Want your dick. Want you to fill me up. Need you inside me. Please, Angel. Give it to me."
a nasty voice in Dean's head sneered. If the angel was bold enough to follow Dean in the state he was currently in, the least he could do is have the guts to look him in the eye.
When Cas comes inside him Dean makes sure he watches. Every facial expression twisted in pleasure, every shudder of Cas’s body, every moan escaping pink parted lips; Dean sees it all, every glorious detail. He’s beautiful, Dean thinks. So goddamn beautiful and he’s all Dean’s. Dean was all his.
the hunter could almost forget that Sam was still in the bunker, and if for whatever reason he decided to wander into the garage the imagine of his best friend ravaging his older brother on top of the car they spent
