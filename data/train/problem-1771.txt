John nodded like he agreed, though Sherlock felt they were agreeing about very little. He ignored his own discomfort—how John seemed irrevocably foreign. The way he paced around Baker Street as if it were a museum exhibit, hadn’t been his home for years.

21 February 13:30
John’s voice cut through the haze: “I’m not going anywhere.” His hand, warm and calloused and familiar, rested gently atop Sherlock’s shoulder. “Just because things are different now doesn’t mean we should give up on each other. We’ll muddle our way through somehow.”
Not for the first time tonight, she wonders why she even came to this dreadful party.
," I hiss, glaring directly at him. He seems to shy away from my eyes, ears flattening against his head, but he doesn't back down completely. "If you're to stay in my care, there are to be a few rules, understand?"
"Don't feed me lies, Mycroft. I've met 43 Johns in my entire life, none of which have even been remotely close to being my soulmate," I sneer, looking back to my brother's scrunched up face. Good; I'm glad I'm annoying him so.
Mrs. Hudson smiles knowingly. "Dears, I just thought you'd like to know that the milk is in your refrigerator." The boffin's head snaps up hastily, John still looking at him through half-lidded eyes. Only after Sherlock makes an uncomfortable noise in his throat does the doctor turn his gaze to the landlady.
“Here,” said John several minutes later, returning with two mugs ensconced in his hands. The sight made something loosen in Sherlock’s stomach. Tea, over the past few weeks, had become an olive branch of sorts.
I shrug as I rise from my chair, leaning forward to grasp my cane; the solidity of it is slightly comforting as I knock it against the floor. I give her a nod before starting for the door.
Smack and speed and coke had been the only thing that made him feel okay. To have that security ripped away, and to have to share that feeling of devastation at some silly meeting, with a striking inarticulacy reminiscent of a newborn, among stupid people he loathed, was absolutely

"I know what you're going to say, Lestrade," I state as he starts to open his mouth,"and I assure you: no, he wouldn't avoid you because he doesn't want a soulmate."
that to him.
Will a kiss change your mind?
There was one lady at those meetings, he remembered, who always complained about her children. How misbehaved they were, how she sometimes wanted to strangle them, sometimes went into the bathroom and had forgotten why she’d gone, only to remember she used to escape and do drugs there in her youth. Another man had lamented about how when he watched the telly, it felt like he was putting the newscaster off. How he cut rails of sugar with a spoon and stared at it for several beats too long before remembering that, of course, it wasn’t coke.
Sherlock set off down the hallway with his hand trailing along the banister, ready to pound on his brother’s door before realizing that Mycroft was no longer home. Memories of their long talks of soulmates slipped under his skin like broken shards of glass, and, shaking himself as if he could dislodge the shards, he set off instead towards the garden.
I feel the soft tremor of his heart, listening to his heavy breaths as my fingertips rub circles into his splotched fur. He licks my limp hand, and I smile.
"I can't be sure, dear, but it could be anything. When you first see blue, all the blue in the world won't just appear all at once: it will appear slowly, gradually, in increments. So many things are blue that you could see the sky, first. Or a building, a sign. Maybe a shirt. It could be anything, at any time, and I know it's frustrating for you not to have a definite answer, and I'm sorry I can't give you one."
, after what felt like centuries, the need to heave abated. The papillae on his tongue were inflamed, swollen and stinging. His teeth tasted like hydrochloric acid and his throat had that dry and gummy taste of morning breath, like when you awoke from a slumber where you had been much too dehydrated.
However, once John and Rosie had settled into Baker Street, there was something about it that Sherlock couldn’t quite place that bothered him still.
"Yeah...the day before yesterday. He...," I trail off with bated breath, facing the door. "He got into a car accident because...he was
And then, I see Carver start to cry.
"This is miserable."
She frowns deeply as she turns back around to face me. Her mouth opens a bit, and her expression seems confused, but then her eyes widen the tiniest bit. Suddenly, I can see the full disapproval in the thin line of her lips, and deep down, the look doesn't make me feel good.
She rushes to me, placing her frail hands on my shoulders as she looks sternly at me.
Rosie’s pudgy arms reached towards him, and although once John would have passed her off to him with familiar warmth and genuine fondness, he now pulled her more closely into his chest.
There should be more John and Sherlock interactions in future chapters. Right now, they just gotta be apart.
All of it was gray. It was no surprise at all but somehow still managed to be a great disappointment.
Sorry it's been so long. I haven't had much time lately, and I'm sure I'm sick, but I hope you enjoyed this chapter. I would love any feedback or response.
"Sherlock?" she calls, knocking softly before twisting the handle. Gaze locked on the disorganized floor, she flicks her eyes up just for them to widen at the sight.
!" I shout, my voice ringing throughout our home. I wait a few minutes, anticipating for him to forcefully wrench open his door and cooly, calmly talk down to me in that condescending tone of his, but it doesn't come. I wait even longer, but then I realize suddenly that my call has fallen upon deaf ears.
Apology accepted, but you have to answer the door. It's Mrs. Hudson with the biscuits.
My fingers flex at my side ever so slightly. I glance around, shifting my legs to adjust my cane as I shake my head faintly. "I got shot," I admit, trying to smile; it feels more like a grimace.
What hurt Sherlock most was that he could
The cabbie glanced at him fleetingly before flicking his turn signal and edging his way onto the road. “Are you sure?” he said, side eyeing Sherlock with a shifty, hesitant gaze. “That place is trouble,” he continued.
..." Other words come to mind, filling the spaces in my head, but it would be difficult to even categorize the level of...adoration, I suppose, that I hold for his level of observation.
wrong.”
"Calm down," he cooes(Mycroft,
“I guess I had to wake up from that dream eventually. Reality was calling me, even though I’d managed to evade it for some time.” A long, heady pause. “You died. That's where it ended: that’s when it should have ended, but I could never stop thinking about you. Even with Mary—and I felt so awful for it—I
Sherlock stayed with that feeling for several minutes. His reality was a cold, shoddy bathroom cubicle, with dim lighting, cracked porcelain, and dirty tiles; his reality was an unsterile needle and trickling blood, dilated pupils and constricted blood vessels; his reality was John and Rosie, alone in the flat.
I'm left in his wake, and I rake my eyes over the room to stall for all this buildup.
Then John leans in with a determined surge and presses their lips together. Sherlock thanks the deity he previously never acknowledged that John has a plethora of experience in this particular area. Otherwise this whole affair would be quite messy and uncomfortable(but still utterly, inexplicably, undeniably perfect.)
God, he looked like a proper junkie, he noted with a crazed smile.
Sherlock nodded and finally shut the car door. He watched as the car peeled away from the kerb and sped off into the night.
"W-why are you trying t-to cover this, honey? You should be pr-roud to have a marking...," Mum drawls, and she glances up to my face with her pleading eyes, and I can't help but wince.
“Whoever did this must have known him,” said Lestrade, arms crossed and eyes clinging to the victim’s form. His gaze was frozen with disgust, and something else which was difficult to parse. I couldn’t feel the sympathy Lestrade did, which was painted across his features. It set his teeth on edge, pulled on the muscles around his lips. No, I couldn’t feel it, but I could understand it: I could appreciate it for what it was, like I could appreciate a painting without being an artist myself.
It took Sherlock several moments to gather enough energy to speak. “Take...the book,” he wheezed. The fingers in his matted fringe never ceased, but the touch grew less intense. Sherlock was shaking worse now then he had before, but he pushed the book across the floor steadfastly towards Mycroft’s pristine shoes regardless. “I...I can’t.”
"You're taking him," he huffs, and I can hear him opening the latch. "And that's final," he continues as I hear nails click against the hardwood. My lips form a thin frown as the canine nips at my heels as I try idly to kick him away.
risking my violin being mutilated!" Redbeard actually did all those things, but I don't want this dog as a reminder.
After all, he had just relapsed.
“I wonder what the first blue thing I see will be,” Sherlock said, though he thought it as unproductive to wonder, considering it was far too impossible to attempt to predict the nature of his color surfacing.
He smiled.
Wiping the smug smirk off of my face, I hold my hand up in a morning salute, which they return almost automatically, despite their drowsiness.
need anybody,” he said in a voice not his own. It was apparent to both John and Sherlock that this was a complete lie.
Sherlock suddenly seemed to lose the ability to speak. There was so much he
, Mrs. Hudson," I compliment, and although it's a bit of a hyperbole, I do think the flat and the biscuits are both fairly decent; just maybe not grand.
He entered the living room with static pillowing his head. Everything seemed to be swimming as if his world was submerged in water. John was perched on the floor, blanket draped over his lap. A bowl of soup and a mug of tea were paired on the coffee table behind him as promised, steam billowing forth, warming the air. John’s eyes flickered upon seeing him, and Sherlock almost visibly flinched—
I slide my phone closed with a click, and for some reason the sound sets me off. I hurl the BlackBerry across the room, and Gladstone almost seems scolding while Skully just looks amused in my mind.
John looked surprised at that. “Because you’re my bloody best friend, is why. Why
"Oh, dear. I'll have to go out for some," she mumbles, glancing to the clock hung over the doorway.
"Ah, Lestrade; lager, I suppose?"
John chuckled slightly. It wasn’t perfunctory or feigned, which made Sherlock sit up straighter on the sofa. Somehow, after so long of John treating him so shortly, his behavior right now was putting Sherlock on edge. Christ, it was so much more preferable to walking on eggshells and dancing around one another—but Sherlock had forgotten how to be genuine. He suddenly felt uncomfortable.
Films came to mind as well. They played like reruns in front of his eyes, all the film frames spread before him. Hushed “I love you”s when lovers embraced and love-addled confessions. He remembered quiet intimacy, but most importantly that initial glance between two soulmates where everything just seemed to click. The one would look into their beloved’s eyes, searching for something they alone could find. Something like calm would settle over their expression, as if gazing into the eyes of their soulmate was the hidden key to solving the plights of the observable universe.
old,” Sherlock assured, sounding hesitant despite himself. “I wouldn’t even bring you on a case if I suspected you were going to keel over and die—too many people would look to me as the murder suspect.”
He lay for a long time with his eyes closed. John had retired to bed hours ago, yet Sherlock still lay awake, haunted by the demons of his past, the reality of his present, and the uncertainty of his future. He counted his breaths—in, out, in, out—focusing on the rise and fall of his chest. The clock ticked indefinitely from above the doorway. Goosebumps raised along his arms, uncovered and folded against his chest. His heels dug into the deflated cushions, toes tucked in the space between the cushion and the arm of the sofa. Guilt and wanting mingled in his blood—boiled beneath his skin. An almost imperceptible tremor laced his body and a cold sweat broke out on his brow; he felt the beading droplets of perspiration, darted out his tongue to taste the briny flavor.
The psychopath and his sidekick are standing right under a strand of mistletoe. The worst part, though, is that neither of them seem to notice; not the mistletoe, or the quieting chatter, or the crowd's indecent speculation. It's only when some loud-mouthed Yarder yells,"Oh, just bloody kiss already!" that the two of them seem to realize anything.
He unearthed the baggies and syringes from beneath the wooden floor, carrying them like hot coals towards his coat on the rack, and shoved them into the inner pocket. Even though they were still sloppily hidden and well within John’s range of vision, it was a much safer place than ground level, where Rosie may have eventually discovered them.
"J-John...it's so h-
After a while, the combination of standing, withdrawal, and hot water caused him to fatigue, so he eventually sat against the shower wall. Water pelted his back as he sat on the floor of the shower, hugging his knees to his chest. His head was bowed between his legs as he closed his eyes against the steady stream of hot water, letting the tears fall in the quiet of the bathroom.
“Nothing,” said Sherlock, because lying was easier—but his voice broke on the word. “I told you already.”
Okay, so it’s been a long time. I haven’t written anything new or updated any existing stories in about two years. This was due to school and work stress, as well as familial issues and lack of time.
At least arguing is preferable to no talking at all...right?
Sherlock wondered how long it would take to fall back into step with one another—to return to whatever they had been, whatever they were before. Sherlock had no way to put their relationship into words, no way to quantify or qualify or explain, but he recognized that whatever they had been once, they hadn’t been in quite some time.
"It's none of
“That was...that was
“Why?” his mother said slowly, a knowing smile creeping onto her face. “Did you get your soul-marking, young man?” She said it sternly, with a certain air of gravitas that hadn’t been there only a moment ago.
(See the end of the chapter for
Four days stretch into six, and John is convinced Sherlock is subsisting on the fumes from his nicotine patch adhesives, then into eight in a hellish all-night stake-out, then nine before the case is cracked at last.
“I’ve already been on exhibit plenty today,” continues John intently.
“Why not?”
Sherlock opens his eyes slowly and tries in vain to control his voice.  It still came out in an undignified squeaky whisper when he said “what you did last week – that was fine.”  He saw John looking at him still, a flickering uncertainty dimming his regard, and Sherlock clarified “you don’t need to do anything different.”
So when a tantalizing text from Greg promises more details in two hours and Sherlock’s black mood dissipates like so much smoke in a breeze, and the detective gives John a blithe wave and dear god actually states his intention to walk down to Speedy’s for a pick-me-up, John grabs his chance with both hands.  So to speak.  But that’s as far as he gets, because Sherlock, still marvelously attuned to John’s self-pleasuring ritual, comes bounding up the stairs after him, gives the knob a firm twist, and collides bodily with the wooden door.  There is an astonished silence from the outside of the door, then some tentative jiggling at the knob, then a sulky “never mind, it was probably only a five anyway.”  And then silence again.
W: I’ll leave the chat open.
John rolls his eyes and hunches a bit smaller under the duvet.
Sherlock is not blind.  He is far from blind, the polar opposite of blind.  He can see what his lover is going through.  He doesn’t need a dozen subtle tells
W: John, oh god yes.
Sherlock opens and closes his mouth a few times before he can bring himself to say the words, “just what you like, John, whatever you like,” but John shakes his head impishly.  “Oh no,” he smiles, “you’ve been spying on me for weeks now. Sodding Sherlock Mr. Fucking Brilliance Himself Holmes surely has some ideas.  I can wait, love”  He demonstrates this by going into a sort of holding pattern with the stroking.
Sherlock’s cock is long and lanky, no surprise there, snugly smooth inside the foreskin, and not remotely aroused.  As John watches, Sherlock begins to count, slow and measured.  By 10, his cock is twitching in his hand, by 20 it has filled out, by 35 John sees that his pupils dilate slightly and his eyes lose their sharp focus.  It’s the only erotic thing about this whole mess.  But Sherlock is already on to 45, and then his body tenses, his breathing becomes, finally, harsh, and by 51 he is tucking himself away again.
Sherlock sighed, obviously wishing John did not pick such inconvenient moments to be ordinary.
They break off kissing and Sherlock is gratified to see that John is up to 8 tells.  The number of tells does seem to be a good proxy indicator for arousal, and he wonders if there would be a proportional relationship between time spent kissing and arousal, or whether the depth of the kiss is a better indicator, or perhaps both.  Then John moves down to place an open-mouthed kiss on the other man’s throat.  Sherlock sees that his eyes flick up towards the other man’s face, assessing the results, then he moves a bit to the left, eye flick, a bit down, and apparently decides that’s the correct spot, because he stays there for almost 40 seconds, and by 20 the other man is moaning audibly.   After that John moves somewhat at random, kissing the other man’s neck, shoulders, and chest, but Sherlock sees that each time he moves on he searches until he finds whatever he’s looking for, and the other man is now easily over 2 dozen tells.
Video-cameras are out, much to Sherlock’s chagrin.
Sherlock was aware that his mouth was hanging open, his breathing suspiciously harsh, so he snapped shut like a codfish, but John had finished giving advice, and was just looking back at Sherlock, a faint challenge in his eyes.  Still, the words hung in his ears, pure humming keening singing desire that was nothing
“Brilliant,” muttered John.  “The Case of the Uninterested Sociopath and his Dull Blogger.”
“I never said I didn’t want anything, John.  If you expended as much effort listening and observing as you do wanking, you’d know that.”  John expression darkens still further, and Sherlock hesitates, unsure where he went wrong.  Finally he decides on “ah, you need … validation.” He says the word as if reading from a web search.
"How -- this -- works if it only, well, works for one person."
“No,” John protests unconvincingly.
Sherlock gazes into his face and waits.
“Please don’t,” John murmurs as it dawns on him. “I’ve been doing the same thing.  I mean, I honestly didn’t realize at first, because you seemed, well, interested.  On the first night, I mean.  After that I should have known.  You told me and I should have known.  God, I even thought I was, I don’t know, helping you, maybe.” He is so appalled by the sudden realization that he can barely look at Sherlock.  “I just wanted to see what I wanted to see. I let you be … accommodating.”
The funeral is sparsely attended and quickly done.  John and Mrs. Hudson and Molly and Greg watch each other warily, and Mycroft twirls his brolly with the put-upon look of a man whose constant worry has finally been justified.  The rest of Lestrade’s team stays away, and it’s just as well, since John’s subconscious would be quite willing to brush up on his hand-to-hand combat with any or all of them at once.
“You need to show me.”
For once, it is Sherlock who falls asleep and John who lies awake beside him, wondering if it would be possible after all to fit a peacock into a sex therapist’s office.
Sometime after breakfast in bed of the second day (John wouldn't even hear of Sherlock cooking, and made his lover eggs and toast instead) Sherlock remembered the text from Lestrade.  And once he remembered, it struck him as odd that neither of their mobile phones had so much as chirped in the last day and a half. When interrogated, a smirking Captain Watson gave away nothing, but the phones were located, along with nine texts from Lestrade, the last one threatening to "give Anderson his due," and the detente ended abruptly as John pushed Sherlock out of bed.
Which is to say, until Sherlock gets bored.
John doesn’t move, but his scrabbling hand gentles.
John is pretty sure his mouth is just hanging open.  A place where things grow sideways?
John didn’t object when he reached out with his hand as well, probing with his fingers like a blind man reading topography, testing resilience and elasticity, feeling for knots and granules and ridges, and John was perfectly still.  Back to dozing, apparently, which made it not too outrageous to do a comparison of sorts, John’s good shoulder against his bad shoulder, the skin soft and resilient on one, coiled tight and ropy on the other.  John sighed and shifted under his probing fingers, and Sherlock froze, fingertips barely brushing over him.
Constructing a hunting blind seems like the kind of soldierly activity that John would excel at, and Sherlock means to ask him for help, but it comes out as a request for tea instead, and even then John snarls at him to make his own fucking tea.
“Unless you--”
On Wednesday Sherlock heads out early in the morning and doesn't return until it's gone seven, looking rested and not sporting any spray patterns that would indicate he's been in the sewers, so John doesn't say anything.  Sherlock makes stroganoff for dinner and douses it with a red wine that John likes, and they are both quite mellow afterwards, and they watch a bit of telly.  At first Sherlock is silent, but John looks at him and says "go on, then" and Sherlock smiles and says "why doesn't the idiot notice there are 2 hangers reversed?" and John laughs and shushes him.
"Really?  You didn't ask a question."
Sherlock flinches at the old argument, but John’s mouth turns up and he is almost giggling and Sherlock is suddenly so happy it is sublime.
“Seducing me.” John’s voice was eerily calm and matter-of-fact.
, and besides that, John is catching on.  So the next time he hears a stray footfall, he all but leaps to attention, flies innocent, lube under the pillow.
John senses a trap, but he soldiers on anyway.  "Try me."
"Oh, you're here, I suppose you may as well eat," he huffed, pleased to see that John was already sitting down to table with no invitation at all. He plunged into his own risotto, leaving John staring at an empty place. John squinted at him, rose and placed the diminutive bottle of garlic oil next to Sherlock’s glass with exaggerated care, and only then retrieved a plate from the cupboard. He had barely served himself when Sherlock rocketed out of his chair, snatched the lemon from him, and zested it carefully onto the mound.
“Dull,”  commented Sherlock, and, flatly, "even you don’t believe it” and John felt caught out.  Trust Sherlock to trample social niceties, even when John was just trying to be helpful.  This conversation didn’t look like it was going to get any easier, and John was running out of ways to putter. “Fine,” he huffed, dropping himself into a chair.  “What do I believe?”
"No,” says Sherlock slowly. “I believe you wouldn't." Sherlock's voice is normal again, the flush gone, his eyes blue and green and gray in the space of one breath.
It’s a breach of professional ethics, probably, but Ella has known him for years now, she's kept him alive long enough for Sherlock to take over the job more than once, and she smiles when they shake hands, as if his happiness and stability can be read from his fingernails or his haircut.
, but John has already stepped willingly into more than one trap tonight, and he is not sure that this is not a test.
“Yeah, I wanted to do, for a moment.  But I didn’t.”
W: I know you’re here.
W: Good night John.
“I’m not an exhibitionist, Sherlock,” John says doggedly, and he is astonished to see real hurt, deep disappointment, in Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock propels him to the bed with one hand on his back, and undresses them both as well.  He pushes John lightly onto his stomach and resumes his former activities. His hands roam down John's back, his arms, his legs, prodding, kneading, rolling, tapping, pushing into sore spots and dragging comfort into his muscles.  After 20 minutes, John feels like his body is made of clouds and beach sand and seafoam.  He is a thousand miles away when Sherlock suddenly flips him over and starts on his front, his hands on the planes of John chest, over and between John's thighs, pushing into the soles of his feet, across the inside his elbows, and back to his throat. Which is very tight. John feels he is getting hard and he grits his teeth, not wanting to betray Sherlock, but also not wanting to ask him to stop.
W: Please talk to me.
It’s a rhetorical question, Sherlock certainly hopes it is, but when John doesn’t relent, he chokes out “you and Mrs. Hudson and Greg”, and when John still glares, he clarifies “three of you” in a whisper, as if John might not be capable of adding.
“Broolay,” Sherlock informed him.
When Sherlock’s fingers resumed their lonely meandering, John reached down and undid his own flies and Sherlock just looked at him with alien eyes.  After several painful moments, he grated out “I don’t know – I mean – I do know, but not with someone else, not with you, or anyone...” And then, after more painful moments, “tell me… what to do…”
There will be an outtake someday, when I'm done writing it...
Not interested – the words fell mocking on his ears, and yet John was gazing at him with something like hope in his face.  Their eyes locked for long moments, and then John reached out and brushed the backs of his fingers lightly down the side of Sherlock’s face and Sherlock’s brain exploded into action, a violent attempt to catalog and analyze not just the number of hairs on each metacarpal but also the differences in their temperature and the webbed pattern of lines on the knuckles and the location of each vein and the whorls of John’s thumb as it followed and
“Absolutely,” John agrees apropos of nothing he could understand, grabbing his jumper to cover the bulge in his trousers and heading for the door.  Where he collides painfully with Sherlock, who is standing, just standing there, his mouth pursed in concentration.
John pronounced the creamy risotto “brilliant” just before he dozed off on Sherlock’s thinking couch.
John looks like he’s been punched in the gut.  “I never meant--” he begins, but Sherlock beats him to it.  “Of course you didn’t.  You never do.”
Sherlock takes a sharp breath, wondering if this is going where it seems to be going.
There is silence for several heartbeats, which Sherlock uses to jot some final notes.
“Full sentences, love.”
Sherlock has taken a step closer to him, is smiling shyly back at him, brushing a quick hand along his arm, and he hears Sherlock’s shouted “stay there, it’s only a 7 anyway” as the man himself clatters down the stairs.
But Sherlock sighs and shakes his head.  "That's not it, you know. I’ve never --  I'm a lot more convincing when I sham. It's not even that I don't enjoy -- you" He considers for a moment, then continues hesitantly "the same way I think you enjoyed Bill."
“But not at that volume,” answers Sherlock.
“Traditional?”
Sherlock sighs. "It's still a valid question."
“John… sexual relationships are not my area.  Sex as a motivator for crime, that goes without saying.  I can list 34 tells for physical attraction, 19 for jealousy, and 15 for revenge, but when not related to motive, I have very little data, and any that I ever had, I deleted it long ago.  I never thought I would need it.  Now I want it back.  And you need to help me.”
The frown dissipates and John turns his back on Sherlock.  He saunters back to the armchair and sits nonchalantly, then looks up at Sherlock through golden lashes.  “Fine,” he says quietly.  “That should be enough.”
“John, we have to get there before -- oh,”  Sherlock goes wordless just for a moment, but recovers valiantly.
But John’s hand has continued to move, and he clears the other man’s head without even brushing against it, and instead he puts his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, then sits to free his other hand to put it on Sherlock’s other shoulder, and his face is almost but not quite touching Sherlock’s and he says “It’s ok, I’ve got you.  We don’t need to talk about this right now, ok?” and Sherlock takes a deep breath and nods. Then he nods again just to make sure that John saw, and John smiles a bit and says “idiot.”  Sherlock is somewhat sure that it sounds affectionate.
And Sherlock shivered, because he didn’t know how to do any of those things that John mentioned so casually.  He had tried a bit of that with Seb once, and Seb had shoved him aside and muttered something about being too stupid to aim straight.  That had been moments before Sherlock had mentally declared the experiment invalid.  The speed with which he had extricated himself from Seb’s bed that afternoon had, well, complicated their relationship.
Updates to John’s blog are increasingly erratic, poorly spelled, and filled with emotional punctuation.  John gives his message at the no doubt also bugged gravestone and makes his appointment with Ella, plus a followup he doesn’t intend to keep three days later.
An indignant huff rouses him again, and he pads over and motions Sherlock to roll up in a ball.  Sherlock glares at him, so John clarifies, “Just pretend it’s your thinking couch and you’re avoiding me.”
At home they move softly around one another and have small conversations that seem very important without any actual meaning. Sherlock even nips out for the shopping and returns triumphant with a gallon a milk and seventeen carrots.  When John asks what experiment he has planned involving carrots, Sherlock looks perplexed, and John tries to figure out how to fit it all in the fridge.
“Fine,” returns Sherlock, regaining a bit of color.  “Am I allowed to ask a question?”
"I hope that wasn't too horrible," Sherlock hears John say.  His voice sounds normal, relaxed even, and he is smiling a bit at the other man.
“John, about last night –“
Sherlock stared down at the helpless zip.
“Why would you do that?” it is sharp and not in the least elliptical, the first thing that Sherlock has said in 4 minutes and 38 seconds, according to the electronic timer, and if you don’t count the scowling.
“No,” admits John.  “But that’s why I need this … this privacy.  It keeps you safe too, you know.”
John glares, very much the drill sergeant now.  His hands are rock solid, his eyes like bayonets.  “Oh, that would have been brilliant.  How many of us would you have risked for that little stunt?”
After a few discreet phone calls, the arrangements are made and Sherlock spends the afternoon rather happily making a kind of hunting blind in his room.  It will allow him to perch high up in one corner with most of his body obstructed by plywood.  One-way glass would be better, and can be ordered online, but not for same day delivery.
Sherlock is surprised when John actually laughs, and is only a bit reassured to hear John's  "Not a chance" because
“Stop,” said John at his most  granite.  “What is a third party?  What are you on about?”
W: I’m still here John
For a long time, Sherlock says nothing more, just rivets his eyes on John’s hand, which moves delicately between the two veins.  John’s breath comes faster and deeper, Sherlock looks at him as if he doesn’t quite remember what’s going on.  “Sherlock, fuck, just… this is lovely, just…” and Sherlock’s eyes focus and he murmurs “your mouth… lick your fingers again,” and watches raggedly as John’s soft pink tongue swirls around his own fingers.  When they are slickly wet, Sherlock says “now the raphe, slide your fingers down and back, slower John, slower,” and John reins himself in visibly, panting as he struggles to to control his own hand.  “Your other hand,” continues Sherlock.  “take your sack, just hold it, let your bollocks roll between your fingers.”  His own fingers curl in demonstration.  John does, and his head tips back as a low keening escapes his throat. He pulls his swollen lower lip between his teeth and Sherlock says “No, no, not that, I need to hear you, please let me hear you, please John,” biting his own lip, and John releases his with a sigh that becomes a moan.  At the sound, Sherlock surges forward, wraps both arms around John’s calves, and nestles his face into the clothing bunched at his knees.  They stay like that for a minute, two minutes, breathing together in a slowing rhythm.  “This” says John at last, his voice thick with emotion and longing.
When Sherlock only looked at him expectantly, John repeated again, “Not sure I follow.  What about Thursdays?”
John has been trying to argue and squirm himself under a blanket at the same time, but so far he has only succeeded in imprisoning his legs and jamming the duvet into his zip.  “Sherlock, would you please let me, just, I don’t know, just be, in peace, that would be lovely.”
"I am a doctor, you know," John sounded rueful. "I'm not totally inept with my hands."
“Hey,” John’s voice was so soft he had to inch forward to hear. “I’m sorry.  We can go back to the way you were doing it before.”
He wakes half a day later with an erection the approximate size and shape of Sherlock’s harpoon.  It doesn’t take long to figure out why.  Sherlock’s grip on him has loosened, but his hands are splayed one on John’s back, the other just on the curve of his arse.  His curls caress John’s shoulder, while his mouth, his brilliant sexy questing mouth, has fallen slightly open and his upper lip just grazes John’s nipple -- not enough to suckle, far too much to ignore.  When John stirs, when he even takes a deep breath, Sherlock’s lips and teeth press perfectly against the very hard peak there.   Sherlock’s legs, meanwhile, wrap around John’s, all heat and weight and the promise of gorgeous friction.
“You are an astounding person, John Watson,” Sherlock informs him earnestly, which is hardly fair, since John is still pretty steamed with him.
“Obviously, John,” says Sherlock in a bored tone.  “A competition name.”
Sherlock did not precisely like cooking, but it did afford him the opportunity to acquire new toys, so after the crème brulée fiasco (John had come home from his date the next morning
That’s hard because Sherlock doesn’t always fade.  Sometimes he explodes like a supernova streaking across their bedroom ceiling, shouting John’s name, laughing and crying at the same time, and John feels like a genius who has just discovered string theory or evolution or superconductors.
In answer, Sherlock sped up and pressed harder and John moaned and moaned again and then growled not at all softly, and within moments John was shuddering in his arms, spurting come between Sherlock’s fingers.
“How should I know?  Not my area, remember?”
2. John has installed a lock on the inside of his door.  Of course it’s only operable when he’s actually in the room, but that’s fine, since being in the room is what’s getting him in trouble in the first place.
3. Oh, and only do it when Sherlock is out of the flat.
It has John worried.
“Thursdays?” said John for the third time, and Sherlock wondered if sex resulted in lower intelligence, and if so how this could be measured, and would it result in needing to filch any new equipment from St. Barts, but John was clearly waiting for more explanation, so he stumbled ahead.
“You’re making what?”
Sherlock was in a quandary.  Experimenting with Italian cuisine now would surely alert even John.  He would need an accomplice. Luckily Sherlock knew many people who owed him a favor, a few who pressed favors on him past owing, and a small-time criminal who often needed his name a bit clearer.  That’s how it happened that three mornings later, Sherlock was up early making ravioli, alternating between 3 differently shaped hand presses, a carved wooden rolling pin, and a shiny silver pasta machine with a crank handle and “property of Angelo” etched shakily into one side.  John eyed the tray as he made his tea, squinting, counting the rows, losing his place, starting over, and poking at a few of the odder shapes.  “It has to do with smuggling pieces of--“ Sherlock began, but John waved him silent.
Hoping to convey some inkling of his affection, he leaned down to press a chaste kiss to her cheek. Molly’s hands fluttered in her lap, as if she wished to extend them. Sherlock grabbed them, squeezed them within his own, kept them from moving anxiously.
I rise from the ground, sparing a glance at the garden and Mummy before I leave. I see my mother smile, something in her eyes I can't quite place, and, as we've already established, I don't like not knowing.
comes to mind first. This John Watson struck an unfamiliar cord in me almost immediately, intriguing and perplexing me all at once. I felt something deep in my stomach at the word
The warmth vanished as John retracted his hand. Sherlock’s mind was scratching itself raw with grief and wanting and guilt.
. But if you're here now, at least help me dry the glasses," I say, tossing him a towel as he rises from the stool.
“Christ, I’ve been such a shit friend. I’m sorry, Sherlock. You must think I hate you...I don't deserve you.”
21 February 11:48
Sherlock lay on the bed like a dead thing. Sunlight poked through the sliver of the drawn curtains, illuminating the crown of his head. He observed it with absent amusement, extending his hand, flexing his fingers, watching the white light as it danced across his skin.
“Not that, you git.  How To Bring Up A Sensitive Subject Without Scaring Off Your Flatmate" John responds, and is rewarded by an actual blush from Sherlock.  It starts at his cheekbones but migrates to the tips of his ears and lingers there long after Sherlock has composed his face.  He supposes that, however expert Sherock is at Mind Over Transport, he left ear cartilage out of the equation, and now it’s betraying him.  John finds it endearing, and is filled with a surge of tender affection.  He wants to pull Sherlock into his arms and – well – there are any number of things he wants to do, but for the first time in a month, there’s no bitter resignation at not being able to do them.
Earlier Sherlock had been fuming at the fussiness of peeling and scooping and slicing a half dozen miniscule artichokes (“very thinly”, insisted the cookbook, “like a truffle”, and although he was determined to treat knifework as dissection practice, even Sherlock’s not that good at deceiving himself), and a text from Lestrade had distracted him long enough that the risotto burned after the vermouth but before the stock, so he'd needed to start over again.
With his body going exactly nowhere, John’s thoughts have circled around again.  Yep, Sherlock’s hands still on his back, his mouth still pressed open into John’s chest, his long, lovely throat bared, John’s very pointy cock pushing into his stomach, almost bumping up against his ribcage, Sherlock’s thighs on his hips, oh god and warm and lovely, and his toes scrunched behind John’s knees.
W: Do you want to talk?
And that’s when it happened.  Sherlock’s zealous prowling vigilant hyperactive brain just gave up protesting and let him plummet into quiet stillness, and his body reacted by rubbing its eyes open and stretching luxuriously, and Sherlock took a deep breath and pried John’s face away from his shoulder and pressed kisses against his forehead and eyes, then reached resolutely between their two bodies, gathering up John’s thick solid cock and his own not-quite-soft one in one hand.  With the slipperiness of John’s pre-come, he moved his hand up and down, not too fast, just moving. Then when it wasn’t cloying or galling, he moved a little faster, a little harder.  While Sherlock’s body slotted sensations into place, fitting touch and response and breath and voice into something that made sense, John was off in the distance, like a man with a sizeable head start just now.  So Sherlock made a supreme effort to observe, even if he wasn’t exactly in the same race as John, and just when he had decided that the doctor was beyond speaking, John turned to him, his lips shaping words with careful concentration. “This --  gonna be all right? with you?”
“Nothing I haven’t said before,”
Sherlock acknowledges that unhappily.
John hummed and grinned.  “You know, some people just stay in bed for three days.”
Sherlock looks at him in consternation.  “Of course I do, you’d know that if you just observed.”
John Watson had often heard himself described as placid, calm, even-keeled… and he liked those descriptions.  He liked the well-being that comes with self-knowledge and stability.  But even he had to admit that his emotional terrain had been affected by his association with the world’s only amateur consulting detective.  Within 24 hours of meeting Sherlock Holmes, he had killed a man in a situation where a serious wound, hell, even a stray gunshot wide of the mark, probably would have answered just as well.  Then he’d spent months ruthlessly squashing the fantasies that popped into his head (granted, unless he was in his own bedroom or he was following Sherlock on the stairs, a man had to have some relief).  He’d tried a string of girlfriends and even enjoyed a few of them, but the enjoyment made him feel guilty, which seemed supremely unfair.
Sherlock seems to be absorbed in the complexity of fork tines, but when John continues gazing at him, and responds in a rush, “this isn’t working.  You’re not happy.  You can’t be.  No one in their right mind would be happy here and you certainly have a – a – a very right mind.”
But it was when he actually kissed Sherlock that things really got strange – like his reality had been rearranged into some cubist painting, leaving him shaking his head in bewilderment.  Eyes one above the other, nose below the mouth, joy and pain swapping places, frustration knifing through like a scar about to break open, tenderness skirmishing with anger, straight lines of the calendar eclipsing the curves of the body…
John could have sleepy, comfortable, middle-of-the-road, cuddly sex five nights out of seven without getting bored.  He is happy to burrow into Sherlock’s embrace, shelter against his solar plexus, curl up between his fingers.
Sherlock nods as well and they fall silent, until Sherlock adds, “It was truly impressive, John.  Your … reaction, I mean.”
Sherlock can’t stand it any more, and words rush out of him.  “I had to come, John.  You were, you sounded … how could I just lay there and do nothing, you were hysterical, John.  I’ve never heard … And there was nothing I could do.   I had to come.  I had to know you were all right.”
Now there are many nights where John is too tired or Sherlock is too pre-occupied for much more than a perfunctory cuddle before John falls asleep and Sherlock lays awake beside him.
“Not your type, am I?” he tries for light-hearted, hears his voice fall into the abyss, tries again less convincingly “am I?”
Sherlock’s idea of a lovely evening with John involves putting up with his crap telly while wriggling his toes under John’s bum, drawing maps of John’s freckles, and interrogating John about the minutiae of his life, which Sherlock stores in boxes of cleanly cut index cards in the office of his mind palace.  Some 10 percent of them he also writes in careful longhand on actual physical cards, which he occasionally shuffles through when John is late from the clinic.
He fantasizes about Sherlock brandishing a riding crop over him, Sherlock immobilized with his own dressing gown belt and begging for John to touch him, Sherlock shouldering him down at a crime scene and fucking him mercilessly as five of London’s finest look on, Sherlock mouthing obscenities in his ear while John teases him, Sherlock covering his body with tender burning kisses, Sherlock on his knees with John’s cock in his mouth and John slumped almost insensible over his back.
Seducing John?  Was that what he’d been doing? John had plenty of experience seducing and being seduced, so surely he would know.
Up to now he had paid little attention to John’s comings and goings, as long as he was available when Sherlock needed him, which was frequently. At first, John had seemed quite taken with their lifestyle, and content as long as he could meet women for the occasional shag. That suited Sherlock fine.
Sherlock makes an annoyed face and says “it’s a metaphor, John.  Like my mind palace.  Like you’ve given it legs and walked it into a new universe.”
groused the running commentary in his head.  It felt oddly like being a small child, sheltering from something fearful that he couldn’t quite remember.  He held himself rigidly to avoid waking John, only his eyes flickering back and forth, taking in the details he’d never been allowed to access before.  The flow of the livid scar on John’s shoulder.  The shape of the inside of his ear, which you could really only discern up close.  The sparse trail of curly blondish hair that ran from John’s belly button down lower… best not to think of that right now, not if he wanted John to stay asleep.
Sherlock tries to consider that, because he has often wondered about jealousy,
The other man nods once, and offers “Kissing?”
John has lost his breath but catches it back again, and he obliges by pulling the foreskin this way and that, revealing quick glimpses of the head that Sherlock pieces together in his mind.  Gradually, leisurely, his cock begins to thicken, pulsing slightly in his hand, the foreskin slipping back and down and revealing more and more.  Sherlock stares mesmerized.
“Once a month is probably more than required, but I believe it better to err on the side of efficiency.  More than six or seven weeks can lead to unpredictable results.”
That night John explains the experimental procedure to Sherlock – the timer, the pants-stay-on rule, the no-actual-sex rule, the way they are meant to communicate and use their words and tell each other what works, what feels good, what doesn’t.  Sherlock’s eyes light up at the word “experiment”, and John doesn’t object to either a laptop on the side table or a go-pro camera on Sherlock’s forehead. The camera band flattens Sherlock’s curls into a parody of an eighties aerobics instructor, so John closes his eyes.
“Should I—“ John starts, but Sherlock waves in one of his quick, undefinable gestures, rolling his eyes a bit as he does, and John stays where he is.  He had thought that going first would allow Sherlock to ease in and feel more comfortable, but he’s not sure now that he was right.
Sherlock can’t hold it in any longer, regardless of which words fit together or how they all don’t, so he starts with “you were smiling” and “your hand” and “touch” and he’s right, his agitation is not making anything clearer.
He walks back in the dark, expecting to come home to an empty flat, but Sherlock is there already, and the smell of curry wafts enticingly out of the door. They eat companionably, and resettle in the living room.  John intends to finish up his entry on "The Case of the Missing Carrot Peeler", but Sherlock grabs the laptop from his hands.  He fiddles aimlessly with it for a few moments before dropping it summarily in the kitchen.  He returns and clambers over the back of John's armchair, nudging him forward until he perches behind John but barely touching him.
"Too bad its barely Friday morning," John replies with a smile, and Sherlock snorts, and John realizes Sherlock won't put up with waiting nearly that long.
In the end, they agreed on two days, mostly because John proposed it as an experiment. They slept, ate, and played for the first day and a half, not always in that order.  No actual fucking took place, or even anything that could serve as a metaphor for it, but many other things did.  Touching.  Delighting.  Tickling (mostly Sherlock).  Orgasms (that was John).  Later Sherlock would look back on that day and a half as the longest period of detente that his mind and his body had ever shared.
Really, was the man just going to repeat after Sherlock all morning?
"Not even if you begged," he struggles to keep his voice light.
For all the energy that John Watson had spent in fantasizing about, yearning for, and remonstrating with himself about his flatmate, in the end it was really quite simple.  The two of them stumbled into the stairwell, high on adrenaline, still giggling about the chase (nothing depressing like a murder, just a nicely clever ring of high-end car thieves and a fair amount of scrabbling over and under street level), John still glowingly amazed by Sherlock’s deductions.  He turned to Sherlock to say something that he knew would only stoke Sherlock’s already sturdy ego, and saw for a split second something he wasn’t meant to see – raw hunger for praise on Sherlock’s face.
Eating, that was even easier.  The body of a six foot tall man contains enough energy for days of deducing, sprinting, interrogating, and pipetting, with apparently some left over for fire-fighting.  (“John, I need some help in the kitchen,” Sherlock had called quite clearly.  “I’m busy, Sherlock, give me a minute,” John had answered.  After a half a minute, Sherlock had repeated “John, you really should come…” and John had responded “Busy, Sherlock.  I do have an actual independent life going on over here” so Sherlock had waited a full minute before calling “John, I—“ to which John had huffed “alright, fine, good, what’s the problem?” and then had become quite verbal about  god-damned scorch marks on the fucking ceiling, and the relative danger values of needing a pen versus setting kitchen appliances on fire.)
W: All right.  Good, that’s good, that’s fine.
Instead of answering, Sherlock says “you called me love, and gorgeous, and brilliant.”
"Shhhh," Sherlock is at his ear.  "It's ok. You're ok.  I can watch."
John rolls his eyes but nods.
After that John loses himself in the joy of the movement, flipping, twisting, spinning fast and slow and fast again.  It doesn’t hurt that he can see, from various upside down and sideways angles, Sherlock staring open-mouthed, though it could equally be John’s trampoline prowess or the idea of John having a growth spurt.  After several minutes of pandemonium, John flips to his back again and stays there, just bobbing softly and smiling rather foolishly.
“And how much time do we have?” continues John.
Finally John reaches for the lube and a condom.  The other man takes the opportunity to press his own kisses on John’s neck and chest, and Sherlock sees John go still, his eyes glassy but his skin nearly glowing.  John’s breathing has turned harsh and after 12 seconds he jerks his head suddenly to mutter “are you ready, or do you need…”
“I’m sure it does,” he mumbled sleepily.
John gives Sherlock a guilty grin, but holds on tighter.  They get two more bounces in.
“Don’t,” John snarls, “apologise.  Do it to Molly if you must, but don’t apologise to me for being who you are.”
John nods and finishes, “one week and then I join you, I know.”
“Bloody hell!” the curse is out of John’s mouth with no input from his brain.  Then more slowly, so that even Sherlock cannot fail to grasp his meaning “That Is. Not. Fucking. Happening.  Not in this life.”
and only glares at him when John thunders
John's whole body is awash in fire.  His skin can feel every move of Sherlock's before he makes it, and he is shaking in a way that is impossible to control. With an effort, he opens his eyes a fraction and the sight slams through his body -- Sherlock rapt above him, cheeks flushed a deep pink, tongue darting between his lips, eyes nothing but pupil.  He drags his eyes over Sherlock's body, down to his cock, which lies nestled, small and tender, between his legs.  Sherlock's words come back to him -- I'd like to watch you -- and for the first time, he has no desire to awaken anything else in Sherlock.
Luckily Sherlock has connections, has done favors for many people, and at least a few of those were tall, attractive, arrogant verging on infuriating men who don’t mind helping him out now even on short notice.  Sherlock has no illusions about his own personality, and since one observation is all he gets, at least for the moment, he wants to control as many variables as possible.  That’s the scientific reason, but he is also a bit afraid of John’s glower, and not sure that John wouldn’t eat one of his friendlier connections alive.
“Extenuating circumstances,” Sherlock replies easily.
And finally John took pity on him.  In a low, careful voice he described how Sherlock could trail his fingers up the back of John’s hands, how to find the pulse points under his wrist, how to press kisses into the crook of his elbow.  He described how to use the tip of his tongue to draw a meandering line down John’s throat, how to lick along his collarbone, how to catch the nipple between his teeth and tug and what that would do to him. He described how Sherlock could press his palms against John’s belly and follow the sparse trail of blondish hair to his cock and how to encircle it and where the sensitive spots were.  And Sherlock knew it all already, it was simple anatomy, but in John’s rough, longing voice it came out like poetry.  When John fell silent, Sherlock’s own skin was tingling, burning, too tight for his bones.  He squeezed his eyes shut and breathed deep to trick his brain and reached for John and put John’s fingers on the back of his hand, then John’s tongue on Sherlock’s throat, then John’s palm on Sherlock’s belly.  Sherlock squeezed his eyes tighter still because god help him it was hard to keep that brain at bay, but he could, because everywhere that John touched he left a warm writhe of comfort with a hint of fire, and when his hand reached Sherlock’s waistband, Sherlock undid it shakily and was glad that when John’s hand got to his cock, there was something there to encircle.  Not an obvious bulge like John, nowhere near hard, but at least there was some evidence of effort, Sherlock thought.
"Not even if you asked," confirms John. "Or begged," he adds with a smile.
“Not what I meant,” says John backwards from his upside-down trajectory.  He lands on his feet again, soars and hangs in the air for a second too long, thinks Sherlock, who flails to save him, only to land on the netting again.  John swan-dives cleanly onto his back.
“You knew that I was breathing,” protests Sherlock.
John had been down for the count after the first 21 hours, although Sherlock would excuse that, would absolutely not even secretly ridicule John, who’d been coping with a sprained ankle and two cracked ribs from the first footchase.  Hadn’t stopped John from trying to mother-hen him away from the petri dishes, though, and had certainly taken nothing away from the inventiveness of his language (and Sherlock could bask in John’s verbal pyrotechnics all day, if truth be told) when he discovered the toaster oven had been on fire for a good 3 minutes while Sherlock finished measuring reagents.
There is no residual heat from John’s side of the bed, and the covers have been pulled smooth.  Sherlock sees that John has retrieved his clothes, but left 5 golden hairs tangled in the pillowcase.  A restless sleep, then.  He wants to spend longer here, deduce John down to the last scattered clue, but he hears the chattering of a zip and the creak of a bed above him and it propels him into his dressing gown and up the stairs. It’s been a long time, and now he realizes that waking alone in a smooth bed was like looking over the edge of an abyss.  Remembering the lock, he puts his shoulder to the door, and falls into the room when it opens easily.
After the first time, they’d had words.  Lots of words.  Most of them while John was decently bundled in about 5 layers of cotton and wool.
“This?” asks Sherlock.
Once the world is in place again, he reaches down to help Sherlock, and realizes that Sherlock doesn’t need any help.  He must have come together with John, and that was nice.
"Well, I hardly think that playing at hair dressing is going to satisfy either of us!" Sherlock is recovering his ability to be acerbic.
A good old-fashioned way to a man’s heart.
Sherlock tries to speak but he can’t find any of the words that would keep a sentence together, only
It’s tempting to stay as long as Sherlock will have him on the narrow couch, but John can already feel his shoulder stiffening inside him, and he has a shift in the morning, so by midnight he makes to get up.  Sherlock rises as well, but when John turns toward the stairs, the detective tugs on his sleeve and asks, in a barely audible voice, “Stay with me?”
“No,” Sherlock dismisses the query, then hunches further in on himself.  John is obscurely insulted by the gallantry.
It’s not like that any more.
“Of course I was. I am. Happy, I mean.  There was nobody else who could have gotten a small time crook to deliver me my cane on my own doorstep, no one else I would walk into a pool strapped with explosives for.  We’re both adrenaline junkies and you put up with the telly and we like the same semi-decent takeaway.  Sex, shagging, fucking – it’s just.  Well.  It’s just a small part.  Not the way to measure what we – what we have.”  John was aware that he had made a strong start, but the argument had faltered somewhere after semi-decent takeaway and petered out altogether by the time he voiced the vague “what we have”, and he was having a hard time meeting Sherlock’s eyes.
The cab ride home was excruciating. John said nothing of his experience in the well, and Sherlock didn’t dare ask about it. The cabbie looked at Sherlock in the mirror occasionally, seeming like he didn’t know why these two blokes were taking a cab together to begin with. It was as close to a slap in the face as a look could be. It seemed to say,
21 February 11:50
, a warmth in my stomach that I thought at first was unpleasant but soon realized was anything but.
Sherlock’s head snapped to attention. He looked at John’s eyes and mouth, hands, posture—any indication that he was being deceitful—and found nothing but a startling amount of sincerity.
Molly’s mouth was in a flat, terse line. “You can’t help how you feel,” she finally said. The words seemed to scrape her mouth on their way out. “I never expected you to return anything. At least, after John.” She paused; smiled wryly. “That confirmed that there wasn’t a chance.”
"William Ewart Gladstone," I confirm, glancing at the bulldog's cocked head. I smile at him genuinely, despite my previous exclamations of annoyance and dislike; I only yelled because of-well,
"Well, I suppose you might have to get used to his love of umbrellas and cakes," I joke back. "But first, you'll have to meet him to see if he even is your soulmate."
! You need to use your phone more," she babbles, glancing to the boiling kettle, then going to retrieve the container of sugar and loose tea from the pantry.
There are times I believe Mycroft doesn't love me, but now is not one of those times. The way his mouth curls on the word hurt and the intensity of his eyes is caring in a way reserved only for things he truly cares about. Mycroft caring is more unsettling than comforting, right now.
His gaze patently avoided the underside of his wrist. Every time his eyes seemed to edge down on their own accord, he drew them upwards like one would control window blinds. Perhaps it was because he feared what he might see. He wondered whether the writing would be delicate cursive or sloppy script or a spidery expanse of letters, and ultimately if any of that would matter—whether it was simple furnishing or evidence of something he’d yet to know.
I suddenly find myself hoping that my counterpart, whatever their name is, wherever they may be, is safe.
“No, why do you ask?” The question seemed to be answered in the course of its formulation, because rather than wait until Sherlock responded, Victor said, “Wait, did you get yours? That’s amazing! What does it say? When did you find out?”
John looked at him, almost suspiciously. “Do you really have to ask? I’m sure it’s obvious to you.”
John's falling face makes his heart do something that is decidedly not normal. "Is that what you think?" His voice is surprisingly gruff, even; flatlined. It's odd, seeing as Sherlock finds his voice to be overly expressive.
“We’ll talk later?” asked Sherlock, hating how he had to phrase it as a question, wondering when John had become so distant that the answer was no longer an immediate
Sherlock did as he was told, his usual stubbornness and indignation drained. He lathered toothpaste onto the bristles and brushed vigorously, so much so that his gums began to bleed and his tongue felt raw. He scrubbed and scrubbed but the taste and smell of bile seemed to cling to him. All the brushing seemed to do was irritate his mouth worse; and the fluoride of the toothpaste made his stomach roil with a renewed wave of nausea.
I turn to Mike, some silent inquiry in the contortion of my face as he nods his head at me, looking quite satisfied with himself. "Is he always so...
Sherlock reflects on his meeting with this peculiar John Watson. His mind short circuits. It doesn't compute, he can't comprehend why a man like John Watson would say the things he did to a person like him. He can't take it. It's too much.
He missed it. It had taken losing it to realize how much he had felt at home then.
John looked at Sherlock as if he didn’t even know him anymore. “Right,” he said, eyes edging towards the ground. His voice sounded far away and foreign. “You’re right. Sorry.”
"A coat?" I snort, laying it against my chest;
His blogger bites his lip, sucks it, shifts his legs. His hands still over the mug's handles. "Well, we almost kissed each time."
I glance incredulously at him, practically glare at him, but he merely shrugs innocently and turns back to his lager. He knows I despise small talk, but I'll indulge him, just this once, since he's being generous with the whole drug fiasco.
I can't stand this silly chat room any longer. Mrs. Hudson, don't be alarmed if you hear a gunshot.
Sherlock shook his head, chest internally puffing with pride at his own
He was about to break his sobriety. Again. His very tentative, only several month long sobriety.
Mrs. Hudson looks stunned for a minute before she's giggling and clapping her hands softly.
"For being the World's Only Consulting Detective, he can be incredibly thick," her boss murmurs, palming his face with an exasperated gasp. Seeing their mouths moving, Sally quietly walks around the DI to try and hear what the Freak and his sidekick are saying.
“People do little else,” the brunette smiled back, a touch of something approaching an actual feeling coloring his eyes.
“I thought we lost him,” The girl said none too quietly.
“That’s written our jackets…” A quizzical Makoto interjected.
Nagisa narrowed his eyes and slowly rose from the pool. He dripped over to the almost reptilian Scotsman and crossed his arms. The Scotsman visibly paled. “Oh…sir. I had no idea
was going to be here?” He snapped at the caller as he exited the room.
“Sorry, Makoto,” The nerd with floaty arms said.
“Play chicken with me, Rei!” He screamed as he nearly drowned his friend. “You’ve got such strong shoulders! You can carry me!”
“And they come from a school called Iwatobi—“
“I’ll…I was…I’ll just be going, then.”
“This isn’t beautiful,” the drowning boy gasped, inhaling a lungful of water for his trouble.
, he thought to himself,
“First of all, they’re obviously not from England—”
“Maybe you weren’t invited at all,” the girl behind him muttered under her breath.
“Hmm?” His chiseled, beautiful face wore an expression of confusion, uncommon for a man of his vast intellect.
“Oh, it’s not her fault,” Nitori said, shaking his perfect gray bowlcut out of his face. Sherlock physically recoiled from the sight. “I put a tracking device in your swim trunks.”
Sherlock’s face contorted with disgust. “Not now, John. I’m already 95 percent of the way finished deducing who these strange children are.”
“You’re the competition, right?” Nagisa increased his efforts to drown Rei. “You’re here to spy on us, aren’t you?”
to do with his
The boy with dark hair and a sour expression on his face gave a noncommittal grunt of agreement.
“Ripping my clothes off in a darkened swimming pool.” The blonde flirtily smirked. “People might talk.”
The pip-squeak of the group started clambering on top of the tall boy who was much too old to be wearing the water wings he had on his arms.
“We’re speaking in Japanese, you asshat!” Yelled the bossy fangirl from across the room.
job!”
“Uh, Sherlock…”
“Isn’t this great, Haru?” The tallest of the four boys asked. His voice was high-pitched and annoying.
A strange Scottish man had just entered the room. “I had this place rented until 10 PM! My brilliant speech wasn’t finished yet! Everything was falling into place, finally, after months of meticulous planning!”
The tallest boy of the group, wearing an I’m-tired-of-this-shit expression, quickly swam over to the boys and separated them. “Enough of that now, boys. We’re all on the same team!”
The first time it happens is just weeks after John moves into the flat.  Dinner was Thai take-away, John watched a bit of crap telly while attempting to ignore the grimaces emanating from the couch, and made his goodnights.  Not twenty minutes later, his door flies open and Sherlock bursts in like a deranged jack out of his box, crying “John, a case, a nine at least, we need a ladder and your old army fatigues, come on John!”  Unfortunately he doesn’t leave like a jack on a spring, but heads straight for the wardrobe.
“Find one of them.  To do what?”
John is sitting cross-legged on the bed, an open bottle of lube and a spare pair of jeans unzipped next to him.  He nods in greeting.  “You slept three quarters of the day,” he says.  “I tried yelling and shaking, but this seems to be the only thing you’ll wake up for.”
Sherlock mutters something that sounds like “obviously”.
“I’m happy right now,” says John softly, realizing that it’s true. “I’m happy during a case. And watching telly. I’m happy that I’m here to have your back and patch you up and hear you spin your deductions out of straw.”
John snorts.  “I don’t think that’s the way the subconscious works, Sherlock.”
Later, at uni, he intended to add to his database with a few strategically-chosen partners, but his plan derailed almost immediately, when the principles of pleasure he had derived so easily in isolation failed to apply in combination.  The same touch that he had quite clearly recorded as pleasureable on his own became awkward, cloying, aggravating, galling, and very deeply tiresome, and he abandoned the effort with the conviction that the data would be anomalous in any case. So it had been a very long time since Sherlock had indulged on his own, and forever since he had done so with another person.  And John had nothing to say about that.
“Could it?” John is skeptical to a point that doesn’t assuage the hemorrhaging behind his ribs.
Before, he had debated how to deflect John without pushing him away.  But gradually it came to him that no deflecting was required.  John’s wanting was almost a physical presence in the room, but it never spoke, never acted, never took anything on itself.  Sherlock taunted it and it merely sat in stony silence.  Sherlock pushed himself into it and it merely gave way and reformed elsewhere.  So finally Sherlock started to ignore it, and then one day on the steps John had looked at him, ready to say something endearing and ridiculous and
"But you would let me do it, even though you wouldn't enjoy it.  And you wouldn't want to do it to me at all," Sherlock finishes bleakly.  "We're right back where we started."
“I’m good," the other man puts in quickly.
“Alright, yes.  But.  You were happy with all of those things before.  You were, weren’t you?”
But John is made of sterner stuff.
Finally John takes a half a step back and chokes out “why are you here?” and Sherlock finds it even harder to breathe.
Sleeping.  Eating.  Fucking.
It’s been two years and mostly John is happy and he thinks Sherlock is happy too. He remembers those years, all those five years before, of locking eyes with Sherlock over a dead body or Mrs. Hudson’s scorched kitchen table or other inappropriate place, the tidal pull towards the other man, the feeling of being washed away and pulled under and slowly lit around the edges all at once.
And there is nothing that John can do about any of this.
“I don’t ride bicycles,” Sherlock replies with a frown.
So John eyes his flatmate warily as he starts water for tea, but Sherlock’s belligerence has deflated. He hovers about, not moving more than 5 feet from John but not closer than arm’s reach either, while John makes tea and does the crossword and tidies the kitchen.
"I told you I'm a lot more convincing when I sham," murmurs Sherlock, and then "I'm sorry, John, I had to know."
The next morning Sherlock woke with a lurching feeling only partly explained by the lingering effects of the drugs, and several hours in which to obsess.
“Did you want to record anything on the spreadsheet?” he tries again.
Sherlock takes a deep breath, then another, then all in one go, “Push back the foreskin so I can see the glans.”  When John takes his time, he adds “please.”
Yep.  Could’ve happened to anyone.
Sherlock knew how it went.  The first 36 hours, a slight giddiness and a welcome bit of extra free time.  For the next 36 hours, there was clarity, euphoria, and lightning-fast reflexes, except at the 20 minute intervals marked by bouts of intestine-cramping drive to put something, anything, into his mouth.  John came in handy here, as Sherlock had learned that allowing John to bully him into one of his  occasional cuppas could prolong the not-eating by another two days.  In fact it got harder and harder to start eating again – because the getting there wasn’t easy, after all, and the urge to find out what happens next, what was around this particular corner, was so strong.  And because evading the increasingly subtle and tempting offers from John – half a poached egg cunningly forgotten amid the petri dishes looks like ambrosia to a man starving himself – that was half the fun.
"Always me..."
And if his soulmate were to bear a frustratingly common name, like James, who's to say he couldn’t match just fine with someone else’s James rather than his own? He could get on with any James he wanted. Maybe he’d never see color, and if he didn’t, he would know it wasn’t
"Mrs. Hudson!?" I shout, her appearing outside her door as I come to the final step. She looks slightly perplexed and concerned as I stride to the front door.
"I...I...," I stutter, and it probably seems weird to her, maybe even troubling, that I'm acting so meek, stuttering so nervously. I take in a shaky breath, exhale, inhale again. In, out, in, out,"
He watched as John bottle fed Rosie. It stirred self-loathing in his chest, but also kindled a refreshed wave of affection. John was the perfect image of paternal caution and generosity; he cradled Rosie closely, smoothed reverently over her blonde hair with one hand and tipped the bottle with the other. Rosie seemed to be shrouded in a halo of light. She made attempts at grabbing the bottle, but eventually settled for curling her fist in the front of John’s jumper. Sherlock couldn’t help being simultaneously endeared and humbled.
Rather than utter any of this, Sherlock kept his thoughts moving along, smiled hollowly, and finished off the rest of his tea.
Sherlock continued shooting up. Heroin was his only solace, only consolation—only company. He was reminded, startlingly, of his life before John. With John absent as often as he was, and Rosie constantly off somewhere, he had ample time and space. He never felt pressured to finish quickly. Languidly draped on the toilet seat, arm outstretched and laid across the rim of the bathtub, Sherlock often lazed in the confines of the bathroom. Blue veins scintillating in the bright bathroom lights, pallor of his skin sickly, his eyes peered at the ceiling, fixed on a crack or a blemish. He was enraptured by life for a while, euphoric, riding the high until he sobered again. He took a nosedive back into reality, injected some more just to feel that rush again, just to blind himself.
We stay in companionable silence for many minutes, continuing to wash and dry the dishes until there aren't any left. I gesture for him to go sit back down on his stool, and he complies, grasping his mug of lager and taking a greedy gulp.
It's a big change going from shot and bloody comrades to shopping at Tesco's and taking cabs to pubs with old mates.
It was preposterous that so much could lay in a single unspoken gaze from a complete stranger. Surely Sherlock was in simple shock.
years old, and I'm still seeing only the dull pallete of gray, black, and white.
"You, ah, got a minute?" he says, pointing at his chair like it's some foreign thing, like he hadn't sat in that thing across from Sherlock just five hours, 34 minutes, and seven seconds ago. "Before a case gets in? Well, you could actually treat me as a client, if you like."
"How do you know anything was different?" I know my voice probably sounds incredulous, but that's only because I am. The only people who know anything are me, Ma, and the hospital.
“What’s wrong?” said John, softer, and Sherlock suddenly felt like crying.
Yes, Sherlock lay now, alone on the couch. The refrigerator hummed; early morning sunlight blurred through the window; the floorboards creaked as the flat settled; and Sherlock was cold.
You really don't know your soulmate by a glance. It isn't like in fictional movies where the characters see each other for the first time, and then there are heated kisses and confessions of "I love you"' formed by their lips, like the films I saw as a mere child. It's more like, when you first talk to them, there's supposed to be a spark you've never felt before. Something pulling you to your counterpart. And then, no matter how small the increments, you see color for the first time. That's how you know they're
Sherlock simultaneously had the breath squeezed out of him and breathed back into him. He couldn’t fathom the words that had just left John’s mouth, the way they sounded exactly the same as his own if he was prompted with the same thought: how would you be without John? Broken was only ever the answer. John made him whole.
"Why not?" Molly sees Sherlock smirk as he chances a glance at the doctor's smiling face.
This isn't as painful as I thought it would be.
And why was John so adamant that he was unforgivable? Why would he not want Sherlock’s forgiveness? Shouldn’t he be leaping at the chance to have a clear conscience, rejoicing the fact that Sherlock was taking responsibility for some of the events that transpired?
“Sherlock, it’s alright,” said John, more sincerely this time. He was still wide eyed with equal parts surprise and bemusement, but his gaze seemed to be touched by and softened with fondness. “I know.”
"My God, J-John...it's aw-ful. He was d-drunk and h-he was dr-iving home...he hit a-a..." She doesn't finish, I don't start, and together, there aren't any words. The sun beats down on my forehead. It would've felt lovely yesterday.
feel good. Got it?”
"Ohh, Sherlock; that's lovely! What's his name?!" she shouts, her smile so wide that I'm (only sort of) tempted to ask her if it hurts.
“Of course everything’s alright,” he growled, curling his legs into his abdomen.
“I forgive you,” said Sherlock, seriously, without hesitation. He clenched and unclenched his hands in the fabric of his ratty pajamas, trying to find solace in something.
“I thought I had,” he said truthfully, splaying his hand against the wall in an attempt to balance himself. He looked down at the light trickle of blood seeping from the newly formed track mark and sucked in a harsh breath at another wave of ecstasy. He surveyed his mottled arm with a certain semblance of detachment, as if on the outside looking in. “I suppose one never really can give it up.”
He smiled weakly, turned to look at Rosie’s peacefully sleeping form. The desire for drugs shrouded him, winding around him like vines. It loomed over his head like a shawl, tightening its hold. The sudden yearning ripped through him and displaced whatever guilt had prevented its surfacing earlier. It seemed suddenly imperative, gazing at Rosie’s gently fluttering eyelids and Mrs. Hudson’s doleful gaze, that he return to the safety and sweet release only heroin could provide.
It wasn’t so long ago when he had related to them. He hadn’t touched smack for what must’ve been eleven years now, Sherlock thought. He and Lestrade had made a deal—if Sherlock got clean and attended his regular Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and didn’t relapse, Lestrade would give him cases with Scotland Yard.
He and John didn’t speak; Lestrade asked about Sherlock on cases, but was met with lies and falsehoods; Mycroft continued breathing down Sherlock’s neck, as was his wont, and his only way to express his caring; Mrs. Hudson padded around the flat, attempting to shoo him out like you would a bat with a broom, but Sherlock clung to Baker Street—his one true safe haven—with incredible tenacity and irritating stubbornness.
Sleep sounds so good right now, so I just lay my head against the warm sand, soaking up all of the sun I can. Maybe the sun can quell the queasiness of my stomach, or my lightheadedness. Then again, all I can feel is cold clawing its way over my body.
Mike rounds the counter and stands beside him, peering over his glasses. The handsome man glances at me again as Mike looks. "Looks yellow to me," he answers. He shrugs as he continues,"What've you been up to?" I'd like to know as well.
“You’re right,” said John, depositing his mug on the end table. “Donovan and Anderson would point fingers straight away.”
“Why?” he said, though the answer was obvious.
When had his life stopped making sense, Sherlock mused.
A certain defensiveness and determination flooded through him. “No, John, I messed up,” he said honestly, to which John’s eyes bulged from his head. “You and Rosie are the most important things to me, and I buggered it up. I wouldn’t want you to think I purposefully bailed.” The coke and smack still wedged in his pocket seemed to scream his name.
I nod my head subconsciously, my mouth curling into a grimace. Mum notices my distress, I guess, because she strokes the side of my face comfortingly.
She stares at me oddly for a moment before crossing her legs and saying, almost uncomfortably,"Well, no, Sherlock..."
Immediately upon exiting the vehicle, the cabbie sped off, seemingly intimidated by the small crowd of people encroaching on the store. The building’s foundation was relatively sound, but the store front was only austerely and simply furnished. The doorbell rang occasionally as passersby came in and out. The walls of the shop were cracked, vine-like weeds poking through spaces between bricks. Several people hovered on the sidewalk, many never actually entering the establishment. Not too far off, three men were slanted against the window front.
As he apologizes for Sherlock's behavior, my mind settles on the fact that his name isn't William. I really thought we had something, but now I know his name, and although it sounds nice in my mouth, it
I try to smile, but it's interrupted as Bill wrenches another fragment from beneath my skin. Then, he quickly plunges the tool back in. My eyes sting for a moment, and I bite into my bottom lip.
Deciding she can't take the insufferable silence any longer, she swings the door open, and there's the petite doctor, practically straddling the Freak's lap, his small hands wound in his curls. The psychopath looks hot and bothered, his gangly arms wrapped around his lapdog's waist.
Yes. Sherlock's acting cross because I implied he's a bad kisser.
"How many stairs are there leading up to 221B?" Mycroft's voice cuts in; he sounds breathless, like he's just run a marathon to get here. I cling to the chair cushion;
The color seemed to drain from John’s face. His brow furrowed, eyes crinkled around the edges. “Nobody should do that to anybody else,” he said finitely, steel edging into his voice. He seemed wildly convicted of the position he had voiced. “You
Fingernails scratched gently at his scalp, sending little chills down his spine. His overly sensitive skin seemed to pulse as John gently grabbed hold of his wrist and started stroking. His one hand still played with Sherlock’s hair in gentle motions.
Sometimes, in the quiet of early morning, something snarled under his skin. It felt like an old friend, like muscle memory, like sinking into a warm bath, or returning home after a long day. It was a feeling he remembered quite clearly, one which had imprinted itself in his mind and which he couldn’t shake. He watched his veins in the faint sliver of light which shone through the drawn curtains. Blues and greens slithered along alabaster, prominent, pulsing. They seared and ached, and something in Sherlock’s chest opened up like a chasm with wanting. Something primal and intimate surged in his abdomen.
"How've you been, John?"
Smiling in approval, I slink under the spray of water, relishing in the way the warm rivulets dribble down my back. It feels as if the steamy drops soak into my skin and alleviate the dull ache that's been blooming there for days. I feel the knots in my muscles gradually dissipate as I lean against the tiled wall and reach for the bottle of travel-size shampoo on the shower's ledge.

Registering the significant loss of weight, she recognizes that it's empty; another thing she'll have to do. Buy their milk for them. Or maybe not; she's sure she has an extra carton in her refrigerator. She can just give that one to the boys, for now.
John’s eyes became less narrowed. Something shifted, but I couldn’t pinpoint what exactly caused it, or what the change meant. “Why don’t you stay at mine tonight? I’m sure the kids would love to see you.” He smiled in that charming way all his own which I found increasingly harder to refuse as the days passed. For a sociopath, I still managed to be swayed by John’s countenance: it should have been disconcerting, but I found it invigorating—and intriguing.
John’s presence began to once again fill up the flat: his coat hanging on the hook by the front doorway; Rosie’s toys nestled in the corner of the living room; the collection of vintage CDs stacked on the end table; baby formula occupying the pantry; schmaltzy romance novels tucked in the bookshelf; every item of John’s was a staunch reminder that he was back physically—but what Sherlock couldn’t convince himself of was John’s actual presence—not just the tangibility of his furniture, but his mental and emotional existence within the flat.
"John Watson!"
"Oh, dear, this is wonderful...," Mrs. Hudson sniffles, drawing a handkerchief up to swat her face. "You haven't found him yet, have you?" She sounds hopeful, excited.
I care?”
A ping from my pocket disrupts my thoughts, calming my heavy breathing the slightest bit as I pull my mobile out; a text from Mycroft.
“Oh, but you just adore Rosie, I can tell.” Her easy exaltation softened some of Sherlock’s self-doubt.
He turned inwards, facing his room once again. He stared at his figure in the mirror. Nothing jumped at him particularly, except perhaps for one errant curl at the top of his head. His eyes shifted to the pile of notebooks and novels stacked on the vanity, Post-It notes slipped between pages. His bed was unmade, the duvet contorted in ways only fabric could be.
“What hasn’t?” he said instead, more anger infused in his voice than he intended.
Because he's my
“Last one into their outfit is a rotten egg!”
He began to doze off. Around a half hour later, the euphoria began to wear off. Reality nipped at the edges of his mind. He seemed to come plummeting down from some great height, as if his air balloon had deflated, or someone had infused his gut with lead.
I can see myself, short and scrawny, beside my stocky father. My mother and Harry are standing behind us. Dad and I are wearing eyepatches, and I'm wielding a foam sword, grinning with a bandana covering my shaggy locks of hair. He's got a pirate hat on his head, an arm slung carelessly around my shoulder as my mother hugs him from behind. Harry, despite her usual feigned indifference, is smiling widely beside me, slightly taller and older.
Sherlock shook his head.
John’s brows furrowed and his mouth grew taut. “No, I don’t think I will,” he said, avoiding Sherlock’s gaze. Something like steel was infused in his voice.
“Wanna play pirates?”
His shirt sleeve rolled forward, absorbing the trickle of blood and concealing the new pair of flushed and raised track marks. He buttoned the cuff, then shuffled into his overcoat. The woman watched him.
"Yup," I confirm curtly, my lips emphasizing the 'p'. She shifts uncomfortably, and I feel uncomfortable too.
My fingers find the folds and tear them open, eagerly wrenching open the parcel to see the exquisitely made black fabric of some article of clothing. I dig my hands into the wrapping, unearthing the article and letting it unfurl as I stand up with it in my hands.
"Sherlock," he sighs,"you'll find your soulmate, alright? Just because me and Mycroft might meet before you and your soulmate do, it doesn't mean you'll never meet them-"
"Ah, I'm hurt, Johnny: you
," and it hasn't happened yet.
"Anthea, actually," she answers simply, for once not tapping out a message on her phone. "Your brother requested that I personally drop this off for you," she continues, pushing the package towards my chest. I examine the parcel before taking it in my hands as she says,"You may already know what it is."
—only to remember he had to take a piss.
21 February 14:25
Once back upstairs in the safety of the bathroom, Sherlock tore the parcel open to find the inside neatly organized. A set of Stericups were stacked alongside a sealed baggie of clean syringes. Alcohol swabs, filters, a proper tourniquet, a new lighter, citric acid packets, and bottled water for injection lay tightly packed together. Resting delicately on top was the elegant scrawl of Mycroft’s handwriting on a note card.
Sherlock’s eyes were already sliding closed, eyelids drawing shut like window blinds. Something warm and firm met his temple as he slipped further down. His cravings for heroin, though no less intense, were tempered by John’s presence and his immense exhaustion: there was no way he could procure more drugs in such a state, so he might as well reserve himself to
"Yet...," I drawl, wishing I had a glass of water; my throat feels so dry. "I was a
"I, ha," he trails off,"wanted to...look, I'm bloody awful at this stuff." He smiles. "I imagine you're probably just as bad, if not worse." Another sigh, a cock of the detective's head, then a low breath as John rises and heads into the kitchen; to make tea, Sherlock realizes.
"Wow," I breathe, and the gangly man's eyes bore through me. "That was...
“You could tell him about your mark? Or perhaps Eurus might be interested?” His mother returned to planting new sets of marigolds, seemingly exhausted with answering Sherlock’s inane questions. “Go on now, before it gets dark.”
“How are you today, Freak?” said Anderson, interrupting my unfocused web of thoughts. He gave off a putrid mixture of body odor and a potent cologne trying and failing to mask it. “Another body, huh? Where’d you find him? Seduced him at a bar, then butchered him?”
," or,"
“Of course I am,” he said matter-of-factly, scratching the back of his head. “It’s just…” He considered the question seriously. “I’m also terrified. What is the probability of finding one particular person out of seven billion? Probability and possibility are not in my favor.”
Sherlock felt surprisingly detached.
Lestrade opens the door as I just start to shoo out the other customers. He stands off to the side as I wave my hands for them to remove themselves from the premises. Their loud groans grate on my ears, and I'm becoming tired of their whinging, but they finally start to rise from their tables. Luckily, there are only seven people still in the pub, sans Lestrade.
I remember the day like it's yesterday as I smile down at it, remembering the way Mum smiled at my father, how happy her grin was. I wish I could see the colors of the picture, know what shades I was wearing on my birthday.
She gurgled as means of response, giggling slightly at Sherlock’s broad smile, of which she seemed especially fond. John seemed to retract her, impossibly, even further into himself.
They seemed to be avoiding the glaringly obvious fact that John hadn’t been on a case in a very long time. “You aren’t
"Oh, honey...," she sighs with a pain in her eyes that makes me want to just...hug her. "I just...I wish you'd accept that you can't change your fate. You're bound to this...
Don't be a git. I even wrote a disclaimer saying you aren't a bad kisser. I thoroughly enjoy your kisses, when they're well timed.
“About John.” She was looking at him with a strangely imploring expression. “I never did have a chance, did I?”
John always appeared as if there was something he needed to say. Even on the off occasion where he was reading in his signature chair, or making two mugs of tea for them both—something which still made Sherlock incredibly warm despite himself—his face was marred with the consternation and absentmindness of someone lost in thought. Sherlock never pried, even when he saw the deliberation in his friend’s expression; even when he saw his foot tap absently or his tongue anxiously wetting his lips. Every time it seemed like there was an unspoken song in John’s expression, he tried to tamp down the hope that maybe something would finally change.
John hummed back lazily to indicate Sherlock had his attention as he flicked on the Jeremy Kyle Show. “Yeah?” he said, fingers still moving in gentle petting motions. “Something wrong?”
Returning to London should be...well, maybe not
It is no secret, either, that he does worry about his brother and Dr. Watson's relationship at times. One day, it will be verging on romantic, the next it will be intimately platonic, and then they will have little contact on the morrow, but come back full circle to start again. It is as worrying as it is humorous.
Like how he made us a candle lit dinner but missed my mouth directly over the flames. Needless to say, he singed quite a bit of our hair.
bloody
Perhaps pathetically, the knowledge that John remembered Sherlock took his tea with two sugars was immensely relieving. Something gnarly in his stomach loosened as he took a sip of the beverage. “It’s good,” he commented offhandedly. “Thank you.”
My brother glances at the D.I., annoyance clearly written on his face as he looks back to me. It's fairly obvious that I must look petulant(Mycroft says my bottom lip juts out and I cross my arms), but he sighs in defeat, and I know I've officially won this time.
"Mum, who? I need to know?" I lean against my nightstand. My hands lift the blinds to peer through the glass. I see a happy couple with linked hands. My eyes sting.
Sherlock just dismissively gestures for him to leave, then turns to John and starts prattling on about a list of possible motives. The last Lestrade sees is the detective pointing wildly at something before the door clicks shut behind him.
. I clench my fists in a vain attempt to calm myself, but my fingernails dig into my palms so forcefully they bleed.
, I suppose.
After replacing the towel, neatly folded, onto the rack, I bend over to scoop up the mound of dirty clothing. I start back for the barracks, my wet feet slapping softly against the floor, echoing in the hallway as I walk back to me and my team's room.
He occasionally makes me tea in the morning, which in itself is surprising. One such morning, he brought it out to me and waited until I started drinking it to try and kiss me. I spilt all of the tea on Sherlock's coat and my jeans. He somehow made it out to be my fault his coat had hot Earl Grey all over it.
something solid
As he entered the doorway, he emptied his coat pocket, then locked himself in the bathroom.
I weeze a little, tamping down my jittery leg, gripping the chair just a little too tightly. The fabric is scratchy against my palms. My sickly hands stick to it.
Sherlock took his other syringe, swaddled in loo paper and nestled in his pocket, and placed it on the bathroom vanity. He took the spoon from earlier and went through the whole refining process, ache growing in his chest as time dragged on. He was made only of wanting, in this moment.
Suddenly, I feel vaguely crestfallen: John is such an ordinary name. So common, in fact, that I've met precisely 17 Johns within my 14 years of existence. And then, my despondency boils into anger at how utterly unfair it is.
Despite his weight, his height makes him look gangly, and his skin looks very white in this lighting. His clothing is obviously expensive, probably tailored to fit his form and hug his body perfectly.
Sherlock would return to his life pre-John—he would solve cases alone, to prove to someone that he’s clever; he would wait for praise which would never come; he would walk into Scotland Yard without a partner; he would play the violin at night; he would keep body parts in the fridge; he would annoy everyone with his antics; he would shoot up in the bathroom; he would get reprimanded by Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson because they would be the only people aware of the squalor he’s living in. It hadn’t been a glamorous existence, but he was content with it once: he could learn to be content with it again.
, my mind chimes in.
This woman has a lesser reaction than the first, only staring at me with an alert glint to her eyes, but it's a reaction nonetheless, and I find myself slightly pleased. She nods before looking back down to her phone, and I nod in acknowledgement of her order, despite she isn't looking.
. He had gotten Mrs. Hudson to promise to properly dispose of his hidden stash, had taken up frivolous hobbies to quell the intense ache which had emerged from the lack of high.
He took a pointed sip of his tea. It was bitter and leeched the saliva from his mouth. “I’m not the best at handling children.” A general falsehood diluted with a smidge of truth: it wasn’t that he couldn’t handle kids, but rather that there was always someone more competent at it.
“You grew on me way too quickly. It should have been disconcerting, but I was having way too much fun to notice.” A calm, contented laugh. “We would go out on cases all day, then order takeaway; and you would do your crazy experiments while I read the paper and watched crap telly. It was invigorating, and silly, and so…unrealistic.”
Sherlock hadn’t touched any of the drugs since the incident with John last night. Guilt gnawed at his stomach, tangled with self-loathing and disappointment. He knew how John felt about the throes of addiction. He remembered John finding him high as a kite in a drug den, then on the tarmac, then during the Culverton Smith case; remembered John ranting about his hatred for Harry. How she wouldn’t just let him help her, how she couldn’t be helped if she didn’t want to be—how he didn’t understand how Harry could
“John doesn’t need to know,” Mycroft reminded, squinting his eyes. They focused on Sherlock, darting about and focusing closely on certain parts before mulling over some newfound piece of information. They seemed to peer through him. The gaze felt like an invasive stab to his abdomen; like a hot knife twisting in his stomach. Mycroft hummed thoughtfully before saying, “You look dreadful.”
As I slip on my shoes and tie the shoe laces, I realize the soldier is Bill Murray, one of my closer, more sincere, army mates.
"Step away with your left, John! Otherwise, you will continue to crush my toes," Sherlock admonishes, stopping his movements to glower at his counterpart. John mutters another 'sorry', and Mycroft is positive that John has apologized 53 times.
(See the end of the chapter for
She returned some moments later with a steaming mug. “I thought you’d have had a case today.”
“I don’t know.” Something in her expression shifted, her initial steel softening with concern.
“Long day?” said Sherlock.
It was just like Mycroft, the omnipresent bastard he was, to know Sherlock’s exact whereabouts to such a fine degree as to guarantee perfect synchronization of both his and Anthea’s arrival. “Perfect timing,” grumbled Sherlock offhandedly, to which Anthea cracked a knowing smile. “He’s always been overbearing, but I thought he might take a holiday by this point in his life.”
"What is it?"
He goads me with a stern look, eyebrows raised as if to say,"
Sherlock hummed.
I would even go so far as to say he is
Wow you guys. How were you not together until 2 weeks ago?
"He's all...bloody. His face i-is...
Before I leave, I weep.
“As well as I can be, I suppose,” said Sherlock. “Though I’d be better if you didn’t stick me, thanks.”
. I feel sick to my stomach knowing I did that to you.”
"No, but I don't feel comfortable talking about that." My sentence is a low mumble, dismissive in its tone. Ella cocks her head.
21 February 12:07
"John...you shouldn't be ashamed. I'm sure William is lovely..."
I sigh tiredly, albeit it's still in the early hours of the morning. As I sit on my cot and drag my shoes out from underneath of it, I see one of the soldiers in the bed across from me stir awake. He wakes groggily as I pull socks from my bedside drawer.
Finally, the next shard pulls out. Murray smiles at me, and I suddenly feel the whole difference; the bullet is gone.
you, Sherlock.”
She didn’t mind babysitting at all—she actually seemed to thrive off it. Whenever Sherlock saw her caring for Rosie, she seemed to have this otherworldly aura. She practically glowed, as one would in motherhood. Perhaps that was it, thought Sherlock; Mrs. Hudson had never had children of her own. The mantle of guardianship which John had passed onto her was probably equal parts exhausting as it was fulfilling.
!" I mutter angrily, swiftly pulling my violin to my chest. I scratch out a grating note before plopping down again.
