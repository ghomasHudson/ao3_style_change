Sherlock shook his shoulders in nonchalance.
John fixed Victoria with an expectant stare. “Well?”
Sherlock’s cheeks coloured slightly, but other than that he did not acknowledge the comment. For the better, probably, John mused. They still had a way to go with the case so they couldn’t afford making it awkward too early on.
“So… that’s why you left.” Sherlock wanted to say “me” but he couldn’t.
“You didn’t expect us to be this lucky, did you?” Sherlock wondered, arching an eyebrow.
,” John ground out now, leaning over the table with dilated pupils. “You are playing a dangerous game, Victoria.”
"I see you haven't learnt how to clean up in the past few years," John remarked, but he made sure to add a smile.
"These are private chambers!" the woman immediately complained. "You have no right to be here – explain yourselves!"
This secrecy ended in a disaster. It was the year when Mycroft entered boarding school and Sherlock was in reception. On a cold Sunday evening, after dropping off their eldest at Sevenoaks School with the family car, the Holmes Family was on their way back to London. It was November and typical for that time of year, very misty and damp outside. Mr Holmes was driving the Honda down the empty, dark streets while Diane was dozing off and Sherlock was sleeping in the back. Out of the blue he confronted his wife with what the neighbours had been whispering about her and John and because Diane denied it, the conversation grew heated and loud. Sherlock woke up to his parents shouting and the bright lights of a lorry coming their way. His scream was the last thing they all heard before they were hit frontally and thrown off the road into a ditch.
Riding the high that resulted from the awe in the other man’s expression, Sherlock’s mind accelerated and he only had to turn the device around in his hands once to explain about the addicted previous owner, John’s brother Harry, and the broken relationship that had led to John owning the phone in question.
"I asked what Moriarty wants by building a network of vampires," Adler had explained, "and all she could do was guess. She fathoms Moriarty wants immortality, wants to lead the vampires and promises power and freedom in return."
"Fine," Mycroft ground out through clenched teeth. "I shall make sure you are included."
John closed the door behind him and followed the detective up the steps.
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“A stone that doesn’t involve you talking to people, you mean?”
“Shall we go back to Baker Street?” John asked.
It was a little unnerving to feel these celadon eyes boring into him but John tried to not think much of it. He talked to Mrs Hudson about Sherlock’s condition, gave her a receipt for medicine and then dismissed them like any other patient.
Footsteps.
“That’s all total bollocks. We blend into society like a chameleon into nature. About the stake to the heart… maybe I’ll tell you more about it later.” His voice trailed off as he looked out of the window again.
"Oh, you have no idea," John sneered, infusing his tone with a hint of arrogance.
"Good," John said, clenching his fist. "We should probably…" he trailed off, inclining his head towards the door.
Although he never saw them, he knew vampires working for the Council were watching his family, ensuring that he didn’t give away his real identity. John hated it up until one of those vampires protected his son when he came back late from work and was nearly mugged in a back alley.
“Why did her eyes change colour?” Sherlock asked. “And what, exactly, is a banshee?”
The Vampire Council and Estrode helped to wipe away any trace of him to prevent anybody from finding him. The only person who knew where he had gone was his friend Gabriel. He was his link to London that kept him updated about his own small family and what was going on in the capital.
"I don’t know if you are aware of how
It was quite warm outside but John was wearing a jacket and a navy bucket hat that made him look rather funny, yet also ordinary and inconspicuous.
Pushing these worrying thoughts aside, John sat down like all the others on an empty seat and faced the person who had asked for their attention. He introduced himself as AIC Carter Brown, who had been charged with their team of selected people to give them information about why they were here and what their mission was about.
Sherlock felt eyes on him as he moved through the crowd. He should be used to it by now, seeing as it was by no means the first time this had happened, and yet the hungry, almost blazing gazes of the other vampires at the clubs were still decidedly unsettling. This was the forth establishment they had visited, the previous three yielding no results as to their mark's whereabouts.
"Yes, did I not just say that? Are you deaf in addition to daft?"
He found a nice little house close to where Mrs Hudson had moved and started working at the local hospital. He spent nearly every evening with the small family – Mycroft only came home on the weekends as he was enrolled at his school until he turned eighteen – and watched Sherlock grow up.
The man snickered to himself, which would have looked childish on anyone but him. He wrapped a hand around the hilt of John’s knife and pulled it out from where it was still buried between his ribs. John watched while his vision dimmed how the man cut his wrist until it bled and extended his arm.
Molly nodded. "My contact at Cambridge came through. He says it's the street name for M-Cat, a synthetic stimulant drug, similar to the amphetamine and cathinone classes. Apparently it's been developed primarily for vampires because of the stimulating effect."
Mycroft sensed he had to play his cards right when it came to his brother. It was remarkable that he had figured out the toxin and the implications on his own, and they needed Sherlock on the team if they were to uncover who was behind the killings.
AIC = agent in charge
"Please, Miss Adler, why don’t you enlighten us how you came to receive this information?" Mycroft said with a charming smile.
"And he didn’t tell you where in England he was staying?" John enquired.
A soldier who was never hurt and a bullet that managed what so many others had not. Realisation dawned on Bill with sudden clarity. Osmond was a vampire.
Molly swallowed. "It allegedly makes them feel alive because…"
"Follow us."
“Some, yes, but out of their own stupidity,” John said, slowly and deliberately. “You’re not stupid, are you? Then why don’t you answer me honestly?”
“Tell the Captain General to spread the word – no one feeds. No one! Any actions to the contrary will be considered treason!”
“Sherlock?”
When the Great Plague broke out, John Watson was sure his life would be over soon. To still be alive and breathing one year later bordered on a miracle.
“Yes, sir.”
The following snort was full of derision. "Of course I can tell. We’re going to Brighton."
On anyone who was no vampire, the reaction would have been lost, yet John noticed the faintest blush darkening Sherlock's cheeks.
Sherlock raised a dubious eyebrow but thankfully remained silent.
Sherlock nodded meekly and recounted how he wanted to determine the impact of candle placement on burning time on Christmas trees. John chuckled at that and for some reason Sherlock could not quite explain, something warm spread through his chest.
“Are you alright? Sherlock?”
He felt jealousy and possessiveness war within him. If he allowed Victoria to drink from Sherlock he would have to give up the craving to be the first to do that. Also, as they were only faking their whole relationship in regards of pet and master, he felt torn by taking the choice from Sherlock of deciding if he wanted to have Victoria drink from him.
"I know what a hug is," Sherlock snapped, though there was not much fire behind it. "Why? Mrs Hudson has already nearly crushed me with hers."
"Well, you have to see her point as well, Sherlock," John said. "She was worried about you. Fire is dangerous."
They shook hands and Adler leant in to whisper in his ear. "Someone has their eye on you, Mr Watson."
"I'm sorry," John murmured. "Thank you for your confidence. This club seems to allow vampires to bring their donors with them and feed on them in here. It's been quite a long while since I did that. I've stuck to bagged blood since the seventies…" His voice trailed off, leaving it to Sherlock to guess what could have been his reasons. "There's a man on the right in the corner with a very young woman. Maybe in her late teens. He could be the one we're looking for and if not perhaps he can tell us if he knows MacCafferty," John added, gently rubbing over the spot on Sherlock's arm where he squeezed too hard before dropping his hand in his lap.
“Hello, madam,” Sherlock began, sliding into the free chair across the woman.
In chapter two, John let Hamish in on his secret, joined the army, fell in love with Sherlock Holmes's mother and took care of the young boy after his parents died. Estrode found Harriet and John left London for some years just to return to a teenage Sherlock and realise that his infatuation with him hadn't diminished.
In the end, Hamish understood that the only way to keep John’s true nature a secret was for him to move away. They said their goodbyes and several weeks after John had told his son his biggest secret, he made his way to Glasgow. It was still close to Hamish, yet a larger city, which allowed the vampire to become invisible more easily than a small community ever could. It was very hard for Hamish to let his dear father go as he had grown very close to him after Charlotte and his mother’s death but John promised to write him which was only a small consolation.
John spent the next sixteen years looking after his sister and helping her partner when Harry relapsed and endeavoured to get clean once more, but in general his life was uneventful. Something which made him content but also made him aware that something important was missing. When another war in Afghanistan broke out, John decided to end the monotony of his life and joined the RAMC where his skills allowed him to work as an army doctor. Again procuring fake documentation, giving him a false name and date of birth along with stellar educational background eased his way into the military. He didn't go alone, however. His friend Gabriel joined him as his comrade in battle.
John looked at Sherlock. He had no clue about the drugs that were in circulation but maybe Sherlock had come across some during his life. He just hoped that he had never taken to any of them.
The man shook his head. “Not all. Only platinic ones.”
if it suits my needs.”
“How about mirror reflection, stake to the heart, black clothes, the whole Dark Age and Gothic rubbish?” Sherlock listed in a disparaging voice.
"Don't leave me alone," he pleaded softly.
It hurt to decide to disappear out of Sherlock's life. He didn’t want to get into trouble with the law by committing a crime in seducing a minor. It frightened him because it would not only bring trouble for him but also Sherlock. He didn't deserve that. He was supposed to grow up in a loving and sheltered environment that didn't take advantage of him.
“No feeding, they said,” John made out before the stream of words turned into another litany of swears. Then the man’s eyes widened and his lips curled into a smile that didn’t bode well. “No killing, yes, but I don’t have to let you die, do I?”
"I am here to offer you a position in another unit."
The vampire had merely smiled, an explanation of knowing where the true power lied falling smoothly from her lips. Mycroft was wary of her, yet had no choice but to trust her information.
"You shall see."
Next to him, John nodded, grateful to Irene for providing a few details for just such a situation.
The man who sat down opposite him was Mycroft Holmes.
"Did the man share drugs with you?" Sherlock asked, his voice as hard as stone.
Sherlock gave him a small smile, remembering that as a teenager he had coaxed the same reaction from John whenever he had made a deduction. He still couldn’t stop being surprised about that. It had been far too long that someone voiced their appreciation about what he deduced.
"I think so. We can always stop when it doesn't."
“Well… it’s the
Everhart's dark eyes fell on him and a low chuckle escaped the feeding vampire while he made a shooing motion with his hand. As if struck by lightening, John got up quickly, his fingers on Sherlock's neck slipping to his shoulder and pulling the man with him.
John hid his surprise that Sherlock very confidently knew where to go, probably thinking of the photograph with the rock formations. As if on cue, said cliffs came into view in the vicinity of the city, their stark white colour reflecting the warm sunlight.
Mary should have listened to him. With the help of John and a fellow midwife of hers she gave birth to Charlotte, a beautiful little girl with blonde tufts of hair and clear blue eyes, looking very much like John while Hamish looked a lot like Mary. She was a healthy baby and while John went to clean her and put her in white linen sheets, the midwife tended to Mary. With the enticing smell of blood in the room, John was quite glad to leave it and wash his daughter. He should have stayed, he realised afterwards, and made sure the midwife washed her hands properly. That day he learnt the fatal consequences of unclean hands.
"It was all rather spontaneous of us, but I assure you, we have got documentation."
“Listen, Hamish,” John tried again, “I’m sure you heard the talk. People wondering about why I don’t age, why my hair doesn’t turn grey… This is why. I shall never grow old. Not in appearance, that is. And, unless someone slays me with the necessary means, I shall never die.”
"Sherlock, you could at least try to be nice. We’ll all be working together."
John grimaced – the use of the formal moniker stung. "It’s John. I thought… after all we’ve…"
“How did you become a, what did you call it? Consulting detective?”
“You got all that from her –
"John Watson?" one of them, tall and black, broad shoulders, asked. John swallowed and nodded. There was no use asking how they knew his real name. A description of him would have sufficed for any member of the Council to identify him.
Suddenly teeth sank into his upper arm, closing around the wound. John cried out but a strong hand covered his mouth a second later, muffling his screams.
"Well?" he asked, signalling for Sherlock to turn around.
, he reminded himself for what felt like the hundredth time.
“It’s …” Sherlock wasn’t meeting John’s gaze. “It was a time in my life I’m not particularly proud of, John.”
"Don't mind him," John said, waving Molly into the room. Agents Sterling and Trevelyan had fled the room soon after arriving this morning, chased off by Sherlock's temper. "You found something on Meow Meow?"
Blue eyes narrowed suspiciously. "How much of this is news to you?"
Mrs Holmes smiled at him.
Victor Trevor died eventually of substance abuse and his death pulled Sherlock out of his horrible habit. He went to seek help with his brother who instantly put him into a drug rehabilitation clinic. He spent two years there until he was discharged. It was also his brother who saw his skill of deduction – after all, he was gifted too – and introduced him to Greg Lestrade, an officer at New Scotland Yard at that time, who worked for the Criminal Record Office.
"We have to look at all of it, don’t we?" she asked. "I mean – we’ll have to be thorough, and, uh –"
Victor Trevor, a quiet and kind young man, was the only one who got close enough to be allowed in Sherlock's proximity. He helped Sherlock to cope with Redbeard's death but was pushed away when he realised that forming an attachment to Victor would only lead to more pain. His brother had always warned him that it wasn’t good to become too attached to people or animals.
John did not need to ask how he knew. "Afghanistan."
"No need," was Sherlock’s prompt reply. "Miss Hooper here is one of Britain’s leading curators and perfectly capable of overseeing our work."
John took a tentative step backwards and smiled at her.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. "I highly doubt you have only been a vampire for such a brief amount of time as to actually be this woman’s uncle."
Mycroft raised an eyebrow, thoroughly amused that his younger sibling of all people was warning him against being too confident. "I assume you have a suggestion?"
Now Sherlock looked genuinely surprised. “I have wondered about that because you never mentioned having siblings. You have a sister? A sister who is still alive? But that would make her –”
"Vampires with this mark have been spotted all around the United Kingdom," Mycroft explained. "Their crimes have differed in severity and intention, yet this is a pattern that suggests a common element. An organisation, maybe even a leader pulling the strings. The British Government as well as the Council has allocated resources to deal with this matter."
They were allowed to stay in Brazil for as long as they needed. It took two months until Harry was strong enough again to travel the long way back to the United Kingdom. The fact that South American vampire policies allowed recuperating vampires human blood to regain their health certainly helped. Back in England, they took up residence with the Council upon Estrode’s behest.
Mrs Hudson hugged him tight and wished him well before he got into a cab and headed off. He went back to his sister and settled down in Liverpool where he opened a small practice. It wasn't easy to push his memories of Sherlock away but with time he managed, although it left a gap in his heart which he kept tucked away from everyone.
(See the end of the chapter for
It wasn’t what many vampires had wanted to achieve but many of them felt acknowledged to some degree and glad about the changes in society. The rumour spread among humans that vampires did exist but the average person dismissed it as superstition. Seeing as vampires blended in with the masses and weren’t recognisable on the street, it was easy for sceptics to only see what they wanted to see.
John tensed. “How so?”
John quirked an eyebrow. "I could have told you that."
John struggled, tried to flip them over yet the man seemed to be incredibly strong despite his burns and didn’t budge, didn’t give him one inch.
Magnussen was granted certain liberties, had been allowed to feed off humans even during bans, got away with heinous actions… and yet they needed him. He was a nuisance, granted, though also a helpful ally, especially in times of war, given his vast network of informants.
Then Sherlock’s last remark caught up with him.
Mycroft turned towards the AIC, intent to break the silence. "Carter, what are your thoughts?"
John’s vision blurred around the edges when his attacker finally released him. He couldn’t move, didn’t have the strength. He had no choice but to watch the man flop onto his back, smiling, red fluid dripping down his chin and trickling down his cheeks.
In the end, Mrs Hudson's anger won out. Sherlock knew on a primal level that the old woman was just scared because humans tended to be afraid of fire, and that this was the reason for her vicious dressing-down. It should not have hurt like it did.
, John wondered briefly.
John gathered her too thin form into his arms and carried her out of the decaying building and into his rented car. He drove carefully until they reached the local Council in Manaus, a city with two million inhabitants and quite a Vampire population. It took three days for Harry to open her eyes. Any human would have died, but thankfully there was no such thing as drug overdose for vampires.
"Nothing. I doubt the Countess’s intellect was of any worth, so it shall be easy to find where she is currently hiding."
Sherlock gasped when John exploded into motion, his movements too quick for Victoria to deflect. Her back connected with the wall next to the living room door and she hissed, baring her sharp teeth. She couldn’t throw him off, however.
“I always do, Mr Estrode.”
The dead piled up during weeks of chaos and John felt helpless in the face of the Black Death. He wanted to flee, like the King and his Court had done, yet he and his family had no money to do so. So he stayed, trying to help where he could, the constant fear of contracting the Plague bringing him many sleepless nights.
As she couldn’t afford keeping the house in Chelsea, an estate agency sold it for her and she used the money to move with her husband and the children to a house in West London. John followed them as he couldn’t stay in the area where everything reminded him of Diane and their illicit tragic affair. He felt incredibly guilty about what had happened and he told Estrode about his grief. Again he had lost a woman he loved and he started to believe that he didn’t have any luck with keeping partners with him. Another reason for moving was also the whispering neighbours. He didn’t want to see their reproachful faces when they came to his surgery.
Glenda Manor is fictional, but the Elizabethan Manor House "Glynde Place" in East Sussex was the inspiraton for it. It is close to Brighton and just like Knebworth House, its house and gardens are open to the public.
"They are really impressive," Molly said, "but can you show us the portraits in the private chambers of your mistress? We’d rather start there with our… research."
“What about all those folklore tales about vampires?” Sherlock asked, curious. “How much is true?”
"Honestly, I cannot comprehend how foolish a person could be to tell their dominatrix about ties to a highly dangerous criminal network," Sherlock concluded loftily, looking as though the lady’s stupidity were a personal affront to him. "If we opened your skull, would we find any brain matter or simply hot air?"
"I won't," John promised, relieved his voice wasn't betraying his feelings.
Piercing blue eyes were trained on him with the same intense focus that John remembered from many years ago. He had grown up into a breathtaking man, dark curls framing high cheekbones and a tall, slender body that stood in perfect contrast to John's compact form.
"It was a rather dull bit of drug smuggling. Mrs Hudson had no idea."
Sherlock pushed down the curiosity urging him to ask about John's motifs, yet the detective inside of him overrode the impulse. They were here to pursue a lead, after all – not to share a drink and exchange life stories.
Unfortunately, his strict father did not like how Sherlock was spending all of his time recently. He never allowed Sherlock to go over to visit John at his house and have some fun playing pretend, rather he demanded him to grow up and stop the silly pirate games. Mycroft always just raised an eyebrow at his little brother who cried when he found the garden door locked. Sometimes his mother would get the key and let him out but when his father found out that Sherlock had attempted to climb over the fence to John’s adjacent garden, he grounded him and didn’t let him see the man for a long time, literally forcing his wife to make the awkward visit and go over to his house to have tea with him. Awkward, in that John was yet to marry and her presence in his home would surely ignite rumours amongst the neighbours.
John thought that it would make Sherlock seem much younger and maybe even more interesting for the vampires in the club which probably liked to seek out young and innocent company who looked like they couldn't harm a fly and would be easy to persuade for anything.
"Oh, easy," Sherlock replied with a wave of his hand. "I found her wardrobe."
“Mr Estrode. I have what you requested.”
Just then Mrs Hudson returned, urging Sherlock to shed his mud-caked clothes. John stood back, watching the proceedings in case Sherlock lost his balance as he shimmied out of his trousers. It was only when John’s eyes were drawn to the boy’s bare chest that he realised what he had been doing.
Yet before John could react, stand up or let alone find a weapon, the door to the tiny hut burst open, revealing a group of five. Instinctively, John sniffed, catching a strange scent he somehow identified as that of other vampires.
“Analysing the relation between spray pattern and density of puddles,” Sherlock replied airily. His voice was still young. John wondered how it would change during puberty.
Sherlock guided the car from the main road onto a narrower street that wound itself along Brighton’s outskirts. Lush greenery surrounded them here, waving briskly in the breeze of the sea. The smell of salt entered the car and John closed his eyes, his olfactory senses enhancing the experience even more.
"How are we going to proceed from here?" Molly asked as soon as she got out of the car. "I’m sure it’ll be a bit suspicious if we split and start snooping around. Do you really think they will believe our cover story of writing a book about portraits in the stately homes of Hertfordshire?"
Now it was John’s turn to snort, a little torn between the warm feeling in his chest that being reunited with his long lost friend brought about, and the annoyance at said friend’s horrible manners.
place I got,” John replied, taking off his tight jacket and sitting down on the sofa. “After coming back from Afghanistan I was glad they didn’t put me in a cell for breaking the rules by joining the war.”
Magnussen was not one of those. He had established one of the very first English newspapers in 1621, had become a vampire a few years later and had since plagued the Council’s existence as one of the most powerful men of the country, maybe even of Europe.
Sherlock shrugged his shoulders, leaning back smugly in his chair and said: “Oh, it has evolved into 'Piss off! '”
"It was an acquaintance of ours," she said in a tinny voice. "I don’t want him to get into trouble."
Sherlock didn't miss the undercurrent of the last word, hinting at protectiveness and possessiveness, and he could feel the hairs on the back of his neck standing up with John in such close proximity. He gulped imperceptively before he nodded and put on a demure expression.
"Well, then it’s easy," one of the operatives spoke up when Adler was finished and taking questions. "We need to find your source and make her tell us all she knows."
"Well, then Miss Hooper should wait outside," Sterling suggested. "Just in case the woman slips out before we find her."
"Morning," John said, opting for a polite greeting in the hope it might lead to a longer conversation than the one they had held yesterday.
“Don’t get me wrong but he had sworn me to secrecy. He doesn’t want to be found. The situation has changed, though, and to be honest with you, I’d rather he is found and taken care of.”
so-called Vampire fetish clubs in England but not all of them were high-end.
“Pardon?”
"I’m not Mrs Hudson," John emphasised.
“He doesn’t see me,” Diane whispered one cold afternoon. “No matter what I do.”
Mycroft wished he could roll his eyes like Estrode was doing, or even groan just as his brother did a few seats away, yet such a childish display would be unbecoming of his position.
“Yeah, of course, not,” John chuckled.
Emily had turned rather pale now and sat down on one of the sofas in the room.
"That seems to be our place to enter," John said.
, John thought.
However, John never thought to ask for permission to reveal his secret. He took great care to hide the things in his home specific to his nature and Diane never got suspicious, even though the bed looked like no one had slept in it for days and the fridge was half-empty all of the time. John had begun to store his blood bags in the cold basement.
approached me,” she replied blasé. “You haven’t marked him yet, so he’s still free for the taking.”
John shook his head. He would forget again. He had a job, a distraction, a purpose. There would be no time to spare thoughts to past mistakes.
Before either of them could argue more, the guard returned, his face as blank as before.
"Yeah, I'm fine. Just a bit… the smell of blood is stronger here."
“Well?”
In the end, it was Sherlock who drove a sleek black jeep up to Knebworth House. Molly sat next to him on the passenger seat while John sat a little crammed in the back with the two operatives Sherlock had chosen. The two men were both tall and broad-shouldered, and John could see from their posture alone that they were truly capable agents. Yet where one was blond, Sterling, John thought he was called – the other, Trevelyan, had dark hair.
Behind his back, John smiled at him. He felt like a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders. It hadn't felt right to feel so alien in Sherlock's company after so many years of being apart. During Sherlock's childhood they had become so close and even though his conflicting feelings had eventually forced him to leave the boy, he hoped they could go back to their easy company, now that Sherlock had grown up.
The day was bright and blue, making the country house, that was situated between fields, acres of garden and an old church, even grander than it already was with its turrets. Molly was gaping at the manor, expressing what John felt as he had also never been here before. Many of these kinds of houses were strewn across England but in all his life had he never bothered to visit one. This mansion wasn’t open to visitors anyway as it belonged to the royal family. A gravel path led around the house to a high, black iron gate that was guarded by a sentry who stood by a small house next to the entrance. Like the Queen’s Life Guards at Buckingham Palace he was wearing a royal guard uniform and also carrying a gun.
"Perfect."
"You have no idea. Irene Adler," she introduced herself, a pleased smile curling around her lipstick-red lips when John's eyes widened in recognition.
“You too,” he said, watching her disappear on the steps and behind the door of her house with a twinkle in her eyes.
Irene looked sceptically at him but nodded and faced the crowd.
“Oi! What are you doing in my kitchen?! People eat there!” he explained and followed Sherlock against his better judgement.
"I will have to inform my supervisor," the guard told them and left, presumably to do as he had said.
“I’m fine,” Sherlock eventually said.
Sherlock, who had been facing the fireplace after entering the living room, turned around and looked him over. “Then it’s a good thing we already agreed you would move into the spare room here. You can start today, stay the night.”
"Yes, sure," Molly agreed readily. To John it seemed as though she was quite glad about her task. "I can inform you as soon as I see anything."
"Why?" John enquired, though Sherlock’s icy chuckle heralded the answer.
No, Estrode decided even before the car reached its destination. He would keep quiet about John’s sister and watch out for the man.
Carter Brown was the best superior officer MI5 had to offer, experienced, well-versed in fighting against vampires, and by normal people’s standards even clever. He was the only man from MI5 whose presence Mycroft was able to tolerate on a regular basis, hence the special unit became his supervise.
“Do you want to show off now? Show me how good you are at your detective job?”
“221B Baker Street,” Sherlock told the cabbie and off they were.
Of course Estrode would have to keep a close eye on the developments – Diane Holmes was married, after all, and John’s longing tone indicated that he was struggling with an attraction that went beyond neighbourly friendliness. However, he didn’t want to act too quickly. John had spent too much time depressed and secluded. He deserved more from his immortality.
“I’m fine,” he said, opening the door and entering first.
Their name was Holmes.
The butler frowned and pursed his lips again in obvious discontent about the circumstances that allowed his visitors to enter his employer’s private rooms in her absence.
The ensuing tussle was over within mere seconds, too fast for a human eye to comprehend, yet in the end both of them landed on their feet, staring at each other.
It didn't take long until the projectile lay in Bill's palm, bloodied but unmistakeably a grey-white bullet, strange marking on the shell.
At that he lifted an eyebrow at his audience, daring them to negate his words. John had to admit that he hadn’t had a clue about anything "dark in the north" as he had been too busy killing off idiot vampires and humans in Afghanistan.
. I don’t have all day, so what is it?”
The doors to his study opened suddenly, interrupting Estrode’s reflections.
"Well, look what we have here," a female voice said from his right. The woman was leaning casually against the wall and John's instincts immediately identified her as the second vampire that the operative had mentioned. "And here I thought I'd be special."
“And if I don’t?” John more wondered than asked.
It all escalated on a truly dreadful day in May. It had been raining since morning and when John came to the Holmes residence that evening after a long shift at the hospital, Sherlock was nowhere to be seen.
"Brilliant. I'll leave you to it, then."
John stifled his sigh. As far as he knew there were several
He made quick work of skimming the letter, then set it down slowly. Apparently, the people of Strathaven, the village in the district of Lanarkshire John and his son had settled down in and even found Hamish a wife, were becoming suspicious of John’s youthful appearance. The resulting talk had reached Hamish’ ears as well, and John wanted to tell his son the truth before moving away to avoid detection.
capable of keeping up.”
"Miss Irene Adler had the 'pleasure' of meeting someone who had information on his followers who provided information about his plans. Said informant didn’t give a name but we all have heard rumours about something dark stirring in the cold north."
Sherlock pouted but then he nodded and let John carry him upstairs to the guest bedroom.
“I’ve heard of this rumour too and I guess that Sean has had the means to get his hands on it but I have never touched it,” she said. “I saw the news that people have died…”
In chapter five, Sherlock and John reconciled again. As they were looking for Sean MacCafferty, they decided to go undercover in vampire clubs to find him. John was invited to Baker Street to see Sherlock’s flat and be dressed accordingly for their mission which brought tension high between both men, even more so when they went to the clubs as donor and vampire master. They met Everhart Lockley who gave them a tip to speak to a contact who often visited a café in Kensington.
"You were always amazing, Sherlock," John blurted before his brain caught up with his mouth.
Estrode became a mentor, someone always ready to dispense advice when needed and one of the few who didn’t judge John for choosing to never drink fresh human blood again. Others sneered at him, taunting him sometimes, yet John stood his ground. He was a doctor, trained to heal, not kill.
"I believe you," she said, "but rest assured that my uncle is not the only vampire on the premises." Her voice was shaking slightly, projecting insecurity which was at odds with the content of her words. "Now," she added, taking a deep breath, "what do you want to know?"
Mary died two days after, breaking John’s heart with it. He, Hamish and their newborn managed to get by, trying to cope with the hole Mary had left in their lives, but tragically, Charlotte followed her mother a year after with typhus.
"Your delicate sensibilities will cost us time," Sherlock pointed out. "We will work much faster in two groups. You’re highly trained agents; I doubt there is much course for worry."
"Then we are decided. Carter, I will entrust Miss Adler to your team, seeing as she is most familiar with London’s vampire culture. Mr Watson, you shall accompany my brother to Miss Somervell’s house along with two operatives and Miss Hooper," Mycroft ordered, pointing towards the young pathologist whose very special talent seemed to be blending into the background. Her cheeks coloured when Mycroft mentioned her but the nod she gave was firm.
Sherlock was silent for a moment, almost as if mulling over his answer. For a man who always spoke his mind and paid so little heed to how his words affected those around him, the pause was almost too considered in John's eyes. "What changed is that you're back. Whatever petty reason you had for leaving has to be moot now."
“We were informed you have been in close contact to Sean MacCafferty. He disappeared during an important deal with me and some colleagues and I are trying to find him. Can you tell us anything about him?”
“Fascinating,” Sherlock said, his verdigris eyes sparkling with keen interest. “What happens if you touch platinum?”
"What was it you said about hubris?"
The apology was sincere and Sherlock swallowed, his throat suddenly tight. He was about to ask about these
He found them eventually and exchanged the old candles against new ones, then designed a spread sheet where he noted the delay with which he had lit each candle. The next step meant waiting for the candles to burn, though Sherlock grew bored rather quickly. In retrospect it might not have been the best idea to leave the living room and tend to the fungi he was secretly growing and monitoring in his room… yet leave the room he did.
"This should do."
It took a long moment during which John had to force his eyes to remain on Sherlock’s face and not trail down his slender form, but eventually the detective nodded curtly.
In the end, Germany was defeated and the constitution amended: Only a certain percentage of humans were allowed to know about the existence of vampires. Those who learnt the truth mostly worked for the drug industry and health care sector, and soon protective creams against the sun’s UV rays and alternatives to human blood flooded the market, tailored to meet the needs of this new target group. Since most vampires had been around for quite some time, they had resources to spend and John imagined the bosses of large corporations laughing mischievously at their luck of discovering an entirely new demographic.
, but just as he made to speak he caught a glimpse of red hair out of the corner of his eyes.
John's other eyebrow rose now and contemplated Sherlock's words.
Emily looked taken aback by his words and chewed nervously on her lower lip.
"Yes," Sherlock managed, and began to steer them across the bar towards their suspect before John had a chance to wonder whether or not his rapid heartbeat had more to do with their proximity than the impending confrontation.
His attacker was whispering now.
When he found Harry, his sister was strung out on drugs of unknown nature, though John suspected it was one of the newer designer products that had flooded the American market recently.
In chapter four, Irene revealed information about Moriarty which she got from one of her clients – Emily Somervell, member of the royal family. Sherlock and John somewhat reconciled and went on a mission to find her to get more information. She told them she heard about Moriarty from a vampire called MacCafferty who could be found in high-end Vampire clubs.
Estrode disliked him greatly. That didn’t stop him from using his services. Another piece of paper caught his attention then. It was a photograph, showing a young woman. Her blonde hair was dishevelled and dull, her skin paler than considered healthy – even for a vampire.
He watched Sherlock’s jaw clench. "Morning," he managed through gritted teeth, not moving a single muscle in the chair he was sitting in.
“I won’t scare her away, John. You underestimate me.”
"Maybe," he conceded, and it was more of an admission than John had ever dared hope for. It took a second for both of them to notice they were both still looking at each other and it was Sherlock who tore his gaze away first. John was sure that if his heart were still able to beat, it would have broken his ribcage.
His companion chuckled at that, a fond look in his eyes. Well, now came the tricky part.
"Really?" John said, blinking in surprise. "And where will I be moving to?"
Many decades had to pass until the vampires were pleased with their existence among humans. It wasn’t ideal for all of them but it was acceptable for many.
“No, but I worry now that I told you all that,” John replied, leaning back in his chair as if to distance himself from Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
on the dirty ground.
Estrode bared his fangs at him, a sight that still made John flinch. “I cannot have a rogue youngling roaming the streets in hunger, John.” He glanced at his companions and the four men squared their shoulders. The threat hung unspoken between them.
"He prefers some other place on Thurdays. He says the pull's better there," Everhart added with a leer even as he manoeuvred his 'donor' into his lap. He traced the line of her neck with a finger, whispering something into her ear that made her blush furiously. "But I know a contact who might be able to help you find him. She frequents the café
John blinked at him. Sherlock’s voice was deeper now, but rather pleasantly so. He liked the way his name sounded now.
John lifted his eyebrows. "Offering makes it sound like I've got a choice here."
In the past, he had changed his appearance so many times, usually every fifteen to twenty years when he had to pretend that he was aging. After all, he didn't want to cause suspicion among his patients that he was still looking the same when he started a new practice or a new job in a different surgery in another town. He was familiar with make-up and wearing clothes that suited someone in his late forties or fifties but he had never really gone undercover for a mission, especially not in a posh club of the wealthy. He had no idea what kind of attire he required for such an establishment.
The reaction he received was immediate – Sherlock blinked, obviously surprised by his coyness. He swallowed, yet did not break eye contact.
They had met on the battlefield as an enemy soldier put a bullet right through John’s torso. Under normal circumstances, John would have played the part of the wounded soldier, yet looking up he caught a glimpse of another enemy aiming at Gabriel. John tackled the man to the ground – the bullet missed them both just so.
"Good day, sir," he addressed Sherlock through the open car window when the vehicle came to a halt in front of the looming gate. "I’m afraid I can’t grant you entrance. I wasn’t informed of any visitors today."
"May I come in?" John's eyes narrowed slightly but he stepped aside, offering him tea and following him into the living room once the mugs were filled. Sherlock sat down next to John on the couch, his body betraying his need for contact, for the kindness John always sent his way after Mrs Hudson’s harsh comments.
To his utter relief, however, Sherlock chose to ignore whatever hunch he had.
The startled sound he made drew the man’s – the vampire’s – attention and suddenly the panic that John felt was reflected back at him in the dark eyes of his attacker.
He cleared his throat, trying to get rid of the lump that was constricting it all of a sudden.
"Well, let’s hear it then," John prompted Sherlock once they had all reconvened in the first room, and immediately Sherlock’s lips curled into a smile.
"Just take it out," Osmond hissed – for it was a hiss, no other word for it – and presented his shoulder.
John couldn't help the bark of laughter that escaped him. "Must be quite the story."
He gasped when the teeth withdrew but there was no reprieve – instead the man sunk them unforgivingly into his throat.
"I have not been in our Countess’ employ for over fifteen years because I tend to disregard regulations, Sir."
As quick as they had come, they headed back to the car again, leaving a bewildered butler behind. This time, John sat down in the passenger seat since Molly fit much better in the back. Sterling and Trevelyan certainly didn’t mind at all.
“Everything alright, dear?” she asked. “You don’t seem so well.”
The boy snorted, clearly unimpressed with John’s lack of deductive skills. “It was to be vacant until you returned and I needed space for my experiments. Don’t touch anything in the kitchen. The data is sensitive.”
“That is not funny.”
John held her gaze. The tension in the room grew, building up with every passing second. Briefly, John thought Victoria would panic and fight… yet in the end, self preservation won out.
John’s eyebrows rose up to his hairline.
“Am I obvious, too?”
It took a few seconds and for a moment John thought the man would argue, but eventually he nodded, welcoming them into the impressive mansion.
He had a point, seeing as these were Sherlock's clothes, so John shot the other man a pointed look to make Sherlock give him some privacy, which he did with an eye-roll before facing the wall. Presumably social conventions such as modesty were too trivial for the likes of him, John thought with a chuckle. The trousers fit, albeit a little tight and long. He rolled up the seams a little bit. The white shirt was better, though the fabric spanned slightly across his chest. At least the jacket was comfortable.
Before he could defend himself, however, the man launched at him, moving so fast that John’s eyes could barely follow. The force of the impact propelled John backwards – he tripped and crashed to the ground with his attacker still upon him. John shoved at the man, even buried the knife inside his chest yet that didn’t even give him pause.
As if on cue, the front door opened and a man in his mid-thirties stepped onto the porch. John estimated he might be the butler of the manor.
“My turn,” John announced then with a smirk. At Sherlock’s arched eyebrow, he elaborated, “Only you quizzing me – seems a bit unfair, doesn’t it?”
"I guess this has to do with one of your experiments?"
This time it took the vampire longer to regain his composure, to stop his hands from trembling. Sherlock wished he could reach out and provide comfort, yet he feared the gesture would only make it worse.
"How stimulating?" John asked.
"What’s the matter?" John asked, now clearly worried.
John produced his mobile phone after that, pushing it across the table towards Sherlock. “Go on.”
A noise near him made him look up and jerk back in shock.
The cab had come to a stop opposite a five-star hotel in a bustling shopping street south of Kensington Gardens. The café in question was huddled snugly between a fashion retailer and a restaurant and was so small that it was easily overlooked. They were early enough that there were still several vacant seats, and Sherlock quickly calculated the spot most suited to their needs.
“Am I really? If I didn’t know you so well, I might agree.”
“How would I even know it’s not fake and you are just trying to chat me up?” Apparently the vampiress had seen through his charade.
John had indeed developed an attraction for Mrs Holmes which he was able to hide for a whole year. As promised he was invited quite frequently for dinner and he enjoyed having animated conversations with Mr Holmes who was a lawyer and quite influential in his profession. His eldest son Mycroft looked up to him and was a very good student, striving to be admitted into Sevenoaks School in Kent, one of the most expensive boarding schools in the United Kingdom, when he turned eleven.
"Like I thought – nothing suitable for fetish clubs," Sherlock eventually said after inspecting the meagre contents of John's wardrobe.
Sherlock was nothing more than a child, far too young to be lusted after. Granted, as a vampire John had a different attitude to age, but still some lines were not meant to be crossed. Not that every vampire felt that way – John had heard stories about certain circles where children would be seduced to function as donors. Apparently their blood tasted purer than an adult’s, yet John had never wanted to test that theory. He needed to put distance between himself and the youngest Holmes, for both their sakes.
"My flat, of course," Sherlock said with an air of finality as if this had all been a foregone conclusion and John was just slow with catching up. John just crossed his arms and raised an eyebrow.
"You’re free to go on," he said with a curt nod, handing back the documents and then moving to open the gate.
The next day was a sunny morning, reflecting Sherlock’s excited mood of looking forward to John moving into his flat. He tried to calm himself down as he didn’t want to look like an overeager boy but it was futile and he was sure that John could easily pick up on his emotion with his heightened senses and everything.
, John thought when the boy's last words were tinged in a dark timbre. He just couldn't say no to Sherlock. He looked so small and helpless that John's nature was rebelling against sending him home.
"We should split up," Sherlock suggested as they reached the entrance hall where three staircases led into different parts of the manor. "John and I will go left, you take the right."
"Oh no, you have been because you kept quiet about her extracurricular activities with one Irene Adler and presumably other women before that, haven’t you?"
John saw Sherlock’s hands twitch where they were holding the china. Yes, she was lying through her teeth. John didn’t need the country’s best detective to tell him that.
Seeing how gentle John was with the boys, especially Sherlock, Diane started to wish he were her husband. Sherlock was always so happy to see him and got encouragement from his visits as her husband very often subdued the bubbly and rather unique child. In personality, her little one was so much like her and, of course, John liked him.
“I’m hungry, Christ,” John explained, maybe a tad more severe than he intended. With a huff he started to unlace his shoes. “At least there are bloodbags at my
Well, the scowl of which John found himself at the receiving end definitely held some animosity, yet John doubted that Sherlock’s anger went as far as trying to hurt him.
Sherlock was taken care of in a London hospital and John informed Mrs Hudson of the incident. She had to break the news of their parents’ death to poor Sherlock and Mycroft who both took it naturally rather badly. Mycroft was the most affected of the two as he mourned the loss of his father more than Sherlock. Now was the question what would happen to the children and John already prepared himself to ensure that he could be the one to look after them. It was a long time ago, but he had been a father to two children before. Luckily, the parents had left a will that designated Mrs Hudson to be the children’s personal and property guardian which meant that she could manage the children’s inherited money and take care of them until they were eighteen.
Yet he invited her into his house again and again, the accidental touches becoming more frequent and especially longer in their duration. Diane relished the conversations they shared, basking in the attention and John couldn’t resist showering her in compliments, praising her in ways he knew her husband never did.
"Lead the way," he said, following the man out of his dreadful quarters.
"Did it occur to you, Agent Lively, that the fact that we have yet to do that means the woman in question is currently on the run?" he asked instead, his tone enough to chastise the operative.
Shoulder shot, the bullet still lodged inside. Osmond would make it, even though they would undoubtedly have to discharge him. Bill knew he couldn't do anything in the field, so he was about to simply dress the wound until they were back at base where they could operate when something peculiar caught his eye.
"Okay. Will it help?"
Just like Sherlock had predicted, Mycroft sought him out the following morning, his polite “A word, Doctor Watson?” by no means a request. John recounted what little progress they had made and the older Holmes pursed his lips in dismay but otherwise remained dispassionate.
, John told himself, but he already knew that would be impossible.
“I did a series of experiments on artificial scents in industrial soaps two years ago. It’s on my blog,” was the truthful explanation.
“But father –”
“Carry on,” he said to Victoria.
“You can imagine that it hasn’t changed what other people’s reaction is.”
The man cursed and John would have flinched at the sound of such profanity if he had had the energy.
There was a moment of silence as the vampire relaxed. “Ta,” he replied eventually and Sherlock felt his apprehension evaporate again.
"Are you all right?" Sherlock whispered, taking in John's completely dilated pupils.
"You’re in the UK, Molly. What did you expect? Human society is still made of a class system," John said, his mouth a thin line. "This house looks like it has been handed down for generations."
Sherlock gave him a half-smile and wondered if John still remembered when he was a teenager. His deduction skills hadn’t been as honed as they were now but they had always led to dissatisfaction and exclusion among his peers.
"Because you’ll do it all yourself, eh?" John enquired, raising an eyebrow.
In a display of power that was as blatant as it was boring, she took three whole seconds before glancing up form the screen of her phone. Even then, she only arched an eyebrow at him.
“Am I?” she challenged. “You’ve heard my demand, Jack. Let me have a sip, or you will have to keep looking for Sean. I doubt you’ll find him without me, but you’re welcome to try.”
"Focus on me, John. You are stronger than your urges, I know you are."
He flagged down a cab and opened the door for John who only gave him a slightly worried look, glad they were out of Victoria’s flat.
Mrs Hudson saw Sherlock suffering quietly and gave him a dog for his fifteenth birthday and it seemed that the Irish Setter was able to fill the void John had left. Instead of constantly concocting new experiments, the young man dedicated most of his time to Redbeard until the day of his death ten years later.
Lockley, contrarily, visibly perked up. Subtlety was not his forte, Sherlock noted with a mental sigh.
"I assure you there was no guessing involved, Mr Watson. Bill Murray identified you the moment he retrieved that bullet. It was designed to kill you, or those of your kind. Quite an effort to go to, unless one knows where it will be of use."
How severe would his punishment be? Would his friendship with Estrode be enough to save John from having his fangs pulled?
"I had to leave," John said, coming to a halt in front of Sherlock.
A carriage took him to the south to the village of Dulwich where Mary’s parents owned a small cottage. Compared to London, the air and water here was fresh and clean and John hungered for his wife and son’s company, needing to see if they were alright. He wasn’t worried that they would see the change in him; his appearance hadn’t changed much, only that many old childhood scars had faded away and his skin looked very healthy and unblemished. The grey in his hair had also vanished, giving him a younger look. But still, those were minor things and he was sure that Mary would notice them but not discuss them as long as he came back safely.
Simon Dale fancied himself an ascending star in the Vampire Council – he was rather young, and apparently spoke for the common vampire. Estrode saw right through him, however – all Dale wanted was power, and if he needed to pretend to care for the less politically inclined of their kind, so be it.
The next five minutes were spent with the most tedious kind of small talk – though to Sherlock, every kind of small talk amounted to torture – yet eventually, John slipped in a reference to MacCafferty. The girl next to the man, who had introduced himself as Everhart Lockley, kept stroking the back of her vampire's hand, giving no sign that she was paying attention.
By now, John even managed to say the word without having to supress a chuckle at the funny nickname.
John was so glad that fashion had changed drastically over the last six decades. Now he could wear comfortable clothes again like he did before he became a vampire. He turned back to the wardrobe, dug through the incredible amount of clothes – did Sherlock only keep it for dressing up? – and put a pair of black leather trousers, a white shirt and a leather jacket on the unused bed.
Watching the setting sun and the display of orange and red behind his curtains, John absentmindedly sipped his drink. What would happen tomorrow? Would there be any chance for him to get Sherlock to talk to him or would they just tag along with the others and ignore each other?
, he wondered, rising to his feet and turning around.
The butler looked at him for a long moment as if he was scrutinising John, and then he nodded and led them back to the foyer where he pointed up the staircase on the right-hand side of the entrance.
It was snowing, though Sherlock did not pay the flakes any heed. His feet carried him on their own accord, through icy wind and dark alleys until he was standing in front of John's house.
“She’s an informant and I can be quite persuasive and
"It's been a long time, Mr Watson. You haven't aged a day."
"Do not play coy, Miss Adler," Sherlock cautioned, "it does not become you. You know exactly who I am."
Everything was constantly changing. He might not have had to deal with the unrest the Civil Rights Movement caused his colleagues in the American Vampire Council, but the current economic downturn threatened to undo the tentative peace amongst the Vampire community of the United Kingdom once again.
"It wouldn't be advisable to walk around on your own, anyway. With all these hungry vampires around," John whispered, his head lifting up to Sherlock's who bent down slightly to hear him better. "After all, you're my 'donor' and I don't share."
"That I was risking all our possessions and our lives… And she wondered what my parents would think of me."
Sherlock was just finishing his deductions and levelling a truly smug look at his brother when he realised that Mycroft did not seem as surprised as he probably would have expected.
Mycroft inclined his head. "You are a capable soldier, John Watson. It would be a shame to neuter you and lock you up. Although I do believe Estrode is furious. He only too happily agreed to include you in this special task force."
The feeling the look of admiration on John’s handsome face caused was better than any line of cocaine Sherlock had ever consumed.
If John had the option, he would seek out his sister as well, but ever since the fire of London, no one had heard from her. John refused to believe she had died in the flames, but his attempts to find her had been in vain so far. Maybe it was for the better. Sooner or later, he would lose her anyway. The fate of vampires seemed to be that they outlived everyone they cared about.
"Obviously Miss Somervell is apt at hiding – as a member of the royal family with an inclination to join an undead dominatrix in her bedroom, she had better," Sherlock interrupted, and Mycroft would swear until his death that in that moment he was grateful for his brother’s lack of respect to procedure and authority. "So finding her will not be an easy task. We need to start with her residence, gather clues and take it from there. With me on your team it won’t take too long to find her."
"Compared to me, you are a fool. We've established that."
, John reprimanded himself.
They decided to start looking for disguising clothes in John's quarters which were in the same building and although John wasn't very keen on showing Sherlock his meagre bedsit, he gave in and led the way.
Mycroft raised his hand, palm up and suddenly there was a woman next to him – how could John not have noticed another person entering his room? – who placed a folder in his hand. Mycroft opened it and revealed several pictures, all of headless bodies – vampires, John would guess – some divested of their clothes. The focus of the pictures soon became clear: every single one of the six corpses sported a tattoo, above the buttocks or on a shoulder blade. A small, black spider.
John chuckled. “Do they still say 'Go away'?”
“I will be back,” John assured him before pulling the child into a hug. Sherlock clung to him and mumbled about all the things he would miss to see, like the River Amazon or the rain forest. But mostly John.
John was nervous. The inconspicuous doors of the conference room where the first briefing was to be held drew closer and closer as he made his way down the hallway, following the officer who had collected him from his makeshift quarters. Shortly he would meet the rest of the team, composed of several human operatives, one consultant and one female vampire. John was still surprised that the Council had turned to the British Government for help but nowadays he thought he shouldn't think like he was still in the nineteenth century. Humans and vampires had after all learnt to co-exist.
Silence spread while John was waiting for Sherlock to react and at the same time looking for something to say that would not sound too pathetic.
“Even though you must be aware that I am here to deliver punishment for you breaking several laws in your entry into the military?”
"Want to start fresh?" was what he came up with, causing Sherlock to narrow his eyes in obvious confusion. "I mean, let the past be the past?"
John’s chest clenched in worry while he chatted mindlessly with the woman until the front door opened and Sherlock stomped inside, drenched from head to toe in water and mud.
"You say that as if you doubt I could defend myself."
They approached the table and the vampire lounging on a long crescent-shaped sofa with the pretty girl on his arm narrowed his eyes the closer they got. The corner was shrouded in shadows, only two tea lights on a small table illuminated the sitting area.
"You seem rather sure of yourself," Adler commented, an amused smile tugging at her lips.
They gave him a moment to button up his uniform, still sporting a hole where the bullet had hit, before exiting the room and leading John deep into the administrative part of the base. They entered a room and made it clear that John was supposed to sit on a chair at a minimalistic table. There was another one opposite him yet neither of the armed men took it. Instead, they waited until the door opened once more, stood to attention and saluted the man who seemed to be John's judge.
In front of John’s eyes, the burn wounds start to heal.
With Victoria’s attention firmly elsewhere, John could turn his to Sherlock. The man’s eyes had gone wide, though in fascination rather than pain. He was probably cataloguing every sensation, storing away every gulp and greedy gasp. One day, John hoped to look back fondly on this memory, yet right now all he felt was jealousy.
At a loss of how to address the elephant in the room, John’s eyes darted around for anything that might distract him. They landed on the book in Sherlock’s hand, long fingers gracefully cradling the ancient-looking material.
"Sherlock," John chided, albeit good-naturedly.
"Quite common, isn't it? Even though no one's hunting us down now like in the olden days."
“It would be our pleasure to invite you for dinner one day,” she said, turning to go. “Have a good day, Dr Watson.”
John chuckled, apparently in assent. It was so unusual for anyone to react favourably to his deductions that Sherlock found it impossible to stop once he had begun. He retraced John’s movements prior to his arrival at the flat as best as he could, even determining which brand of conditioner John used, which elicited a shocked if not awed, “How the hell do you know that?!”
"I have news?" John turned towards the door of their office at MI5 headquarters where Molly Hooper was fidgeting on the threshold.
“Overwhelmed? Why?”
, he thought in disbelief.
"Please spare us your bumbling," Sherlock snubbed. "We are here to investigate, not to imitate annoying tourists."
Before John could get too lost in the sensation, Victoria returned and he had to loosen his possessive hand around Sherlock to let him drink his tea.
"Yes."
Mycroft arched an eyebrow.
Sherlock hoped no one would see the minute tremble in his hand.
The previous tenants had moved away several months ago, but John had told Mrs Hudson not to look for new ones since he would be returning soon. So it came to a big surprise to hear movement inside the house when he opened the door. His eyes immediately darted around the room, looking for anything he might use as a weapon, only to be fundamentally waylaid when the source of the noise appeared in the doorway to the living room.
Sherlock, meanwhile, glared at him. A lesser man might have been intimidated yet after years of suffering from his brother’s mood swings as a child, Mycroft had become thoroughly immune.
“What have you been up to?” John asked lightly to distract the young boy who glared at his guardian.
"Would you like a drink?" John asked, leaning closer and resting a hand on Sherlock's arm.
Sherlock, who had got goosebumps from John's gentle touch, knew that this was a wild guess. Not even he could tell if it was really a habit of some vampires to do that. But John must have his reasons and although they weren't very close (that had been a long time ago) he trusted John.
“I was momentarily overwhelmed. Nothing to worry about, John.”
Yet it stung, hearing her call him reckless and daft, wondering 'what would your parents think'. The last one was worst. Sherlock could not explain the pain he felt, could not deal with the situation. He ran out of the house and into the cold night, barely remembering to bring his coat.
Sherlock obeyed with only a hint of hesitation. John only noticed it because he was waiting for it – the man’s body clamming up, only for a second, before crossing the space and lowering himself into John’s lap.
Hamish was still looking at him with wide, unbelieving eyes, so John turned to his last resort. It required a lot of concentration, since he had spent years repressing the urge to bare them in the vicinity of humans.
Something in his chest loosened at the sight but he needed more, needed to see the man. He rang the bell, eager for the door to open. When it did, John smiled warmly at him in his dressing gown and shower-damp hair.
They never seemed to remember that humans outnumbered their kind ten to one and were – as interhuman wars had proven – capable of great violence. Estrode had heard the kind of horror stories travelling creatures told of Italy, where the Church strung vampires up in broad daylight until, hours or even days later depending on how strong the victim was, the vampire perished. Immortality could have an end after all.
Before Sherlock could even take a breath for a snide remark, John stepped forward and replied, "I promise that we’ll take utter care of everything in this remarkable household. We won’t be long."
Sherlock swallowed. When he spoke, his voice was but a whisper. “Intimately.”
, John thought mortified, pulling away carefully and making sure that Sherlock didn't wake up.
“Would you like tea, Sherlock?” John murmured to him. With the younger man resting against his chest, the angle was awkward but he managed to make out the small nod.
“Obvious, John. So you
"You all know why we have gathered here. The problem is called Moriarty, a man who strives to gain power by promising the vampire population victory over humankind. He thinks he can outsmart the government but he’s wrong. Information has leaked through; after all there’s always someone who can’t keep their mouth shut. The newspapers have shown us that the prize these leaks come with is death. We also know how difficult it is to kill a vampire but he seems to have invented a toxin that makes short shrift of those who betray him and that he also resorts to barbaric beheadings." Mycroft grimaced in apparent distaste at such crude measures.
“Fine. Then you shall deliver a report first thing Saturday, Doctor Watson.”
Under the disguise of leaving the country for a job in the States, John bid goodbye to the Holmes and Hudsons. Sherlock was visibly angry about it and refused to acknowledge John's departure. The last time John saw him for many years, he was waving up to Sherlock's window on the first floor with the boy turning around and disappearing into the room, his face hard as stone.
Folding his hands while thinking about his sister, John’s face had become thoughtful.
He had to give it to her – Victoria played the clueless bystander very well.
"I’m not sure if I caught the name right but it sounded like Meow Meow," she replied timidly. “It didn’t have that much of an effect on me, or Miss Huntingdon. But MacCafferty said it made our blood taste better.”
“Yes, sir.”
Were there ways to live as a vampire without being a monster? John somehow doubted that. Yet there before him stood a man, not a beast as John would have imagined vampires to be. Had he found a way, by any chance?
“What is your name?” he asked, his tone curious.
Yet everything turned out to be fine in the end. Humans in the know with a kink for blood play were a legal food source for many vampires, even though prostitution and coercion created new problems. After all it wouldn’t be Estrode’s unlife if there wasn’t trouble somewhere in the vampire community.
"You won't find Sean here tonight."
Just like that, the Sherlock John knew was back with full force and he could not help how it impressed him. The butler blanched, his eyes widening.
"If you care for a swim, I’m certain I can handle Miss Somervell on my own," Sherlock suggested, his voice tinged with sarcasm.
Yet after John’s last letter it was a different situation. He had spoken at length about a new family that had moved to his neighbourhood, their two sons - three and ten years old.
“Well, as this is business we are speaking here, let’s go by protocol and introduce names. I’m Jack Brown and you are?” John said, quickly coming up with an alias as it wouldn’t do well to give his real name.
“Yeah,” John replied, looking up and meeting Sherlock’s gaze. “Among other things. Sorry.”
"Believe it or not, Captain Watson, I usually don’t preoccupy myself with the monarchy."
Apparently satisfied, the man reached into his coat pocket and gave John everything he needed to join the army one more time. Vampires weren’t allowed to serve; yet professionally forged papers eliminated that obstacle.
Later he would realise they hadn’t healed as quick as other vampire wounds because he had been bitten, and bite marks inflicted by a vampire always took longer to heal.
"Brilliant," was all John managed to say, before he forcibly shook his head and stopped staring at his former friend who was brimming with pride over his deductions yet had chosen to abstain from recounting them in detail.
John smiled wryly at that. Sherlock heaved a sigh, muttered a “Bloody vampires,” but there was no heat in his voice. Then he straightened.
"Does that mean you two are finished with your little domestic?"
John, who had only been to posh clubs during the Victorian times where it was normal to spend his free time to engage with other gentleman or vampires, had felt a little rusty to Sherlock when he entered the first establishment. Obviously etiquette and interior design had changed drastically, portraying the twenty-first century in every aspect. All of the recent clubs were located in the rich boroughs of London, usually having their entrance in a small, easily overlooked alley. There were no flashing lights that indicated the existence of a vampire club. You had to know where they were. Luckily Sherlock had found them through his contacts as John wouldn't have known where to start. He never frequented clubs of this nature, or so he had explained.
Sherlock’s lips twitched at that.
“Also a vampire, quite right,” John said, taking a deep breath. “Not sure if I should be happy about it. She had some problems with drinking and drugs. I left London to help her settle her life; I guess she couldn’t handle being undead. Luckily she met Clara and is now in good hands. They had been split up but reconciled a while ago.”
“It is rare but not unheard of that humans give birth to healthy hybrids. Those are curious beings, John, with the most fascinating characteristics. They usually inherit all the positive genes of vampires and humans and are very sought after as marriage partners. Consider yourself lucky, John.”
It was from one of these groups that John Watson purchased his documents. He paid in cash, handed over the exact amount in a sealed envelope to a vampire considerably older than himself.
“Yes, of course it was,” John emphasised. “You were already astonishing when you were young but over the years you’ve become extraordinary at it. No doubt.”
He himself rarely frequented establishments such as Fangtasia, a global chain of vampire bars, but sometimes he had to attend meetings in such places (meetings of the shadier kind, that is). It was always a fascinating experience to see his fellow vampires lose themselves in the kind of ecstasy that had never really held much appeal for Estrode, not even when he was human, which explained why he had remained childless all his life. But not even he could resist fresh blood when it was so willingly given, so he occasionally indulged, leaving the blood bags in his fridge a little while longer.
"What are you doing about it?"
Victoria feigned thinking about it but it was clear to John that she would suggest something daring. He had already guessed by the way she had eyed Sherlock during their conversation.
He felt a little like being naked from the waist down as he had taken off his underwear to fit inside the leather trousers. They were really snug, maybe a little too revealing – the word "package" came to mind – but after all they were going to the club to attract attention and the way he looked now would definitely accomplish that.
A moment later, Sherlock was rushing out of the room and John and the others had no choice but to follow. Sterling grumbled something about informing his superior, but all of John’s attention was on the tall figure a few metres ahead of them, his coat highlighting his build and his chestnut-coloured locks reflecting the sunlight that entered the hallway through the windows.
"There’s a human behind that door. She must be the only one here," he whispered, approaching said door as quietly as only vampires could do.
They lived two more months in Dulwich until they returned to London which was being slowly rebuilt. They moved into a small house in the area of Regent’s Park which was known at that time as Marylebone Park and set aside as a hunting park. Here John could hunt deer and other animals.
Nowadays, there aren’t many mythical creatures left in the world. They walk in obscurity, wary of the fear they are met with, organising underground to develop techniques that allow them to blend in.
John thanked him with a smile, before turning to Sherlock and meeting his gaze. Sherlock could see the mischief and triumph in his steel blue eyes after getting the information, trying to push down the twisting knot that was forming in the lower region of his stomach.
