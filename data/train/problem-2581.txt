The voices were only growing louder and louder, it was all John’s voice and the feeling of injecting another in his veins was so persistent. He thought he might’ve heard another voice, a woman’s, but he wasn’t sure, he wasn’t sure of anything right now. Where he was, if he was alone or with someone, hell, it didn’t matter if he was in a crowd filled with people, he was still alone.
Once Sherlock got outside, he was welcomed by the cold wind of December, thank God he thought about getting his coat. To his right was John, standing with his hands in his pockets, staring into nothing. Sherlock approached him, carefully, not saying anything just first, only joining his friend by staring at the sky. He had to be careful about what he was about to say next, or else he might lose his best friend.
He simply nodded and finally pushed the door open. Clearly, someone had been here before because the place was more tidied up, the syringes gone and the dust cleaned off. Definitely Mrs Hudson. There were some cookies in the kitchen on the counter, still warm, so freshly baked. It was nice being back. It seemed like he never left. Like nothing ever happened.
“‘Stop that it annoys me’.” They said it in sync and Sherlock turned to look at John but he wouldn’t budge. He was still staring at some imaginary dot in the street. It was complete silence, no car was passing by, no one was out, of course, it was late and Christmas.
The doctor had told everyone to go, to let the patient have some rest like he didn’t in the past twenty-four hours, then he told Mycroft about multiple programs, for substance abuse and therapy for Sherlock. He had never once in his life thought something like this, talking to a doctor about therapy for his baby brother would happen. He still wasn’t really over what had happened, but he coped with it. The others left, John tried to stay but the nurse wouldn’t allow him. They all went to get some coffee, all but Mycroft and Mrs Hudson and talked. At first, no one wanted to open up the subject, but as time passed by, the three of them started to talk about Sherlock. Molly was the first one to open her mouth and after that John and Greg started to open up too.
(See the end of the chapter for
It took a little while until conversation sparked between the two. And it started with Sherlock complaining about how incompetent the doctors and nurses and the people around him were. A small smile made its way on John’s face, it was just like old times, Sherlock insulting people and pointing out how stupid they were. Except he was in a hospital due to last days events he simply didn’t look like Sherlock. He was more pale than usual and his cheeks sharper. Even if neither wanted it, someone had to start talking about what happened.
He noticed with a side-eye glance that John was chewing on his lips, something he used to do for a long time until he met Sherlock. “I remember the first day we met and you were chewing on your lip and you wouldn’t stop,” he smiled slightly at the memory, how they first met, their first day together, how John literally killed someone for him, “and I told you to ‘stop that, it annoys me’.”
“Mrs Hudson called to make sure he’s ok and when I walked in he was just, laying on the couch, looking so lifeless…” John didn’t even dare to say dead. And then he saw anger in Mycroft’s eyes, like he was about to jump to his throat and tear him apart, piece by piece, thinking how John was supposed to be there. But he knew he should’ve been there as well. He never really was, was he?
When they made it to the hospital, John was left in the waiting room, while Sherlock was under surgery. John was shaking, almost crying, he did spill some tears in the ambulance. He tried to believe that this was just Sherlock pulling off a trick or accidental overdose. He couldn’t believe it, what if Sherlock was not going to make it? Oh no, but he had to.
“But it didn’t actually annoy me, it bothered me because I knew you’re hurting yourself. And I didn’t want you to hurt yourself.” It was John’s turn to look at Sherlock, but he already turned his head, staring at the sky again. What the detective said, it made John feel warm inside, knowing he did care.
“Shut up!” Molly flinched, she was startled and extremely confused. Sherlock sometimes told her to shut up when she wasn’t saying anything, but it wasn’t like this. This was more of a disparate cry like someone had just stabbed him in the throat. It was loud and angry and even Mrs Hudson stepped out of her apartment to check if something happened.
She helped him around the apartment and promised to stay for a few more hours until John came by. Things were going to be ok. They had to, Molly promised herself she was going to do everything to put Sherlock back together, alongside John and Mycroft and Greg.
If Sherlock was going to die, which he won’t, he couldn’t, he simply couldn't, it wouldn’t be fair, John would make sure to make his life the very best. He would come over every day, make him breakfast, solve cases and all that. Only if Sherlock would take him back, of course.
“I want you to be ok. And I want you to open up, to me, to Mycroft or a therapist. Anyone Sherlock. Please.” the pleading look in his eyes almost made Sherlock turn around. The way he said ‘please’ did something to Sherlock, it made him realize some things. It made him realize how self-destructive was in the last days, or years. The damage he bought upon his friends, he never realised, he was too busy ignoring his problems.
To say that John was startled was an understatement, he would have never expected something like this from his friend. He just took his coat off and placed it over John, careful not to touch him, or else he might catch feelings and he never said a word. They sat there in silence and Sherlock took out a cigarette. John did throw a dirty glance at him, but to his surprise, the taller placed it between his lips and never took out his lighter.
“Will you just, stop being you for a second! Molly’s human you know? She did something nice for you and all you do is say those awful things to her. You’re really horrible.” That was a tad shocking, for everybody. No one dared to speak up. Sherlock’s expression didn’t change, it was the same as before, just as emotionless. But, it did hurt. It wasn’t the first time John would call him horrible, he called him many names in the past and he tried not to think much of it. It did make him a little bit sad. but emotion and feelings weren’t his domain, clearly.
Mrs Hudson motioned for Sherlock to follow his friend outside, but he didn’t need someone to push him, he bolted outside not even ten seconds after. The rest was left in rather awkward silence.
John always thought he was a genius and never doubted Sherlock. But this chase after a quite creepy but seemingly innocent man made the doctor doubt Sherlock, for the first time. He had shown up at his door, allegedly high, and telling John to come with him for this case. Mary’s loss had a huge impact on John, he saw her everywhere, he missed her like crazy. What he failed to notice was that it took a toll on Sherlock as well. Of course, he didn't notice when he was too busy accusing his best friend of killing his wife and being in denial.
These next few days were not going to be easy, at all, not that this day was, but the shock and the ‘what if’s’ were not a problem now since they knew Sherlock was alive and taken care of, physically at least. They had to get him to open up somehow, but they didn’t really know-how. Sherlock would never open this matter up and he’d ignore it, just pretend like his suicide attempt didn’t happen.
Anyway, thanks for checking this out and I hope yall have a good day/night!
Sherlock had a time in his life where everything was so dark, he was using constantly and was in denial about it, he had all of these thoughts, these bad thoughts that wouldn’t get out of his head. That was until he met Detective Lestrade and started working on cases. That’s what started to get him high, but of course, with no proper therapy or rehab he didn’t give drugs up completely. He barely used them and now that he had John in his life he only smoked cigarettes nowadays but decided to give those up as well. He was ok, but of course, everything went to hell the day Mary died. He kept thinking it should’ve been him instead of her, he started using again, he almost overdosed one time, but he didn’t pay attention to how much he had injected, so it wasn’t intentional.
“So…” Mycroft started, but never continued, he didn’t know-how. Or he did but didn’t dare to speak. He really didn’ want to ask ‘so how did you find him? Why did he do it?’ it would feel like torture. Losing his brother… especially this way would kill him inside, not just upset him, it would destroy him completely.
Six hours in and all of them fell asleep, except John who swore he will not sleep until Sherlock wakes up. But it started to get harder and harder as hours passed by and the sun started to rise and suddenly it was the next day. The others woke up at some point, Greg and Molly calling in that today they are not coming to work. They have to be there for Sherlock. The nurse was starting to threaten them to at least go home and change then come back. They each took turns. Going home, changing and grabbing something to eat only to come back to Sherlock, who was still in a come.
And no one noticed. No one was there for him. Wow, John was a great friend, truly. The best, him and Molly who seemed to have forgotten about Sherlock and Greg who never thought once about checking up on him and Mycroft who… was his very own brother and never said a word. He never did.
All of them starred in shock, Molly started crying immediately and Greg looked so lost and broken. They asked ‘how? Why? When?’ all of those annoying questions that John wasn’t really in the mood to answer.
“At the hospital, you’re ok now.” The last part came more like a whisper, meant only for Sherlock. Molly went after the doctor after she made sure Sherlock saw and acknowledged her. The detective kept on trying to get up and leave, obviously,  the wires were pulling him back. That and the fact that his whole body was aching, even breathing was an effort right now.
“I was just- taking the edge off.”
“I don't understand Sherlock, can’t you be nice for once!” John finally snapped. If there was one thing he didn’t like about his friend was this careless part, forgetting not everyone is a high-functioning sociopath, or worse, he didn’t forget he just didn’t think anything of it.
“And one day, your lip was busted, but no one punched you. I knew and I asked, ‘why’?”
None of them wanted to leave, they wanted to be there when Sherlock woke up. They didn’t want to leave him alone, again. So three more hours passed by and nothing happened. The nurse that came in once an hour to check Sherlock’s doses and pulse told them to go home, sleep and come back tomorrow. But no one was willing to go. Mycroft had requested a special room for his brother and they moved him quickly into a more spacious one with a private bathroom.
Thanks for reading this second one-shot from this series. I think it's better than the first one but these are a little older and I don't think that they are that good? They could definitely be better, but again, these are things I wrote a while ago and my writing skills improved.
“I was just telling the truth, would you like me to lie? I’m sorry I offended you, John, but I think Molly can defend herself.”
And then, there was a moment of silence, a moment between a glance and a kiss, where the world stopped, for the briefest of times. There was no one else but them and the anticipation of their platonic relationship becoming more, a moment so intense it just hangs in the air as it pulls them closer, emotionally. It was a moment so perfect, that when it came to an end they realised it was only the beginning of a new ‘us’.
Instead, Sherlock denied it. So very casual. He insisted he didn’t try to do such a thing, which made John a little happy. Because maybe he didn’t try to do it on purpose, he tried to inject a dose but slipped. Not that that was any better, but still.
He felt the urge to get up and push him out the door, not wanting to talk anymore with anyone. Especially since he knew he’d snap at him at any moment and Sherlock didn’t want that. He’d feel guilty afterwards and guilt wasn’t a pleasant emotion. Even though he shouldn’t feel guilty at all, about anything.
-It’s been postponed because Mycroft will spend the day at the Mansion with our mother, and we're invited too- Sherlock explained.
The detective quickly wondered what might have caused that reaction, coming to the correct conclusion: he had made the wrong move by letting John precede him.
Every time those thoughts gripped him, John shook his head and let a new patient in, trying to make himself useful.
Ten days had passed since his return to Baker Street and in all that time John had kept himself at a distance, totally uninterested in his life and basic needs: never once had he worried if the detective had eaten or slept, never once a cup of tea had appeared on the coffee table of the living room next to the sofa, perfect as only John was able to make it.
For years John had not met the man and listening to the tone of voice and the words used in that short sentence, one might have believed that the two were perfect strangers.
"Luckily yes" had been the reply.
-Come on, Gregory...
The armchairs and sofa were in the usual place, right next to the little coffee table clear of newspapers and the various takeaway boxes that had always hidden it from view previously.
But would he really be able to put aside his fears and do his part so he and John will have fun together?
Lady Holmes smiled a sad smile.
"Do you really want to talk about it now?" he asked, his eyes ready to throw lightning bolts.
Why did John persist in surrounding himself with boring and useless people who had no other purpose in life than to keep him away from Sherlock?
For fifteen minutes Sherlock settled down by the stained-glass windows, explaining to Hamish the main characteristics of the gorillas, everything he knew about their habits, careless of the crowd around him who tried to observe the animals while throwing at him curious glances hearing Sherlock speak so eloquently to such a small child.
"What?"asked John.
-You know it's risky.
I want the truth: I want to know everything that has happened in these three years.
"Was it really necessary?" Greg asked, leaving the take-way bag on the coffee table in the living room and then taking off his coat.
"John, where are you?" he asked.
-We would have a fight and I would leave slamming the door behind me and in a couple of hours a bag with my clothes would arrive to the pub.
“John?” the detective then called out loud.
Gregory Lestrade inserted the key into the lock and entered the apartment, leaving behind the cold rain and sharp cold that had accompanied him all the way home.
Silence descended between them for a few moments, both engaged with their teacups, until Jack spoke again.
John sincerely hoped that that press conference would have a positive outcome, bringing back to the man the private cases that would distract him from the constant buzz of his mind.
I know where we can go" he said, walking the next moment down the sidewalk in the opposite direction to which his "friend" was, expecting Greg to follow him.
I thought I'd take it to you in person, instead of waiting for you to come down to check your mail... Such a small ticket can be easily missed- she added.
"You really have to get over it" said Jack.
"Well it's not their business how I've lived my life these years and it's definitely not yours!" said John, turning his gaze away to try to control the anger he felt mounting inside him.
"You don't know" said Irene, "But if I know Mycroft at least a little, I know that he has already done everything in his power to prevent Hamish from being taking away from the Holmes family”.
Is that something we need to keep hidden? I'm sure everyone in this neighborhood knows you and is aware of your prowess-Sherlock said in a sharp tone before bringing back his look on Tommy who had observed the exchange in disbelief.
Sherlock Holmes had never been a sentimental man, but he could empathize with the man's words on screen without any problem: he had done anything to make John sit next to him.
Where was he right now?
asked a voice in his head dreadfully like Mycroft’s.
After all, how many times had Sherlock seen him go out on a date with another woman, or with another man in recent weeks, fully aware of what his main purpose was, what his goal was at the end of those dates?
So, tell me: what do you want to know? -she asked.
"Have you decided to stay by the door for much longer?" asked Sherlock without turning around.
Does that sound like an acceptable plan? -Greg asked with the same kind smile.
Only a few times, perhaps they could counted them on their fingertips, their  crime scene was such a "normal" bedroom: with rock band posters on the walls, pastel-colored walls, white closet, bookshelves full of books and a desk with a laptop placed neatly in the middle between a table lamp and a photo frame.
-I know that.
Feeling the warm and gentle touch of Sherlock lips on his skin John thrown his head back and moaned.
“Oh...” Sherlock murmured .
"I'm not going to change my plans because you got into a fight with your boyfriend" his father said.
"Some guy" Dan said.
I just want to go to dinner with a friend, have a laugh...-he said in a calm voice.
Maybe the tone had been too formal, but John wanted to be clear and avoid misunderstandings.
"What a bloody idiot!" exclaimed Greg, in disbelief.
-My brother has no feelings... - commented Sherlock, standing up and settling Hamish, fast asleep, in his wicker basket, giving the other man time to come to terms with that new information and to make the next link.
Clutching his fingers convulsively around the scarf, he walked to the door of the staff room, hearing someone call his name in the distance.
Irene shrugged her shoulders, finally taking off her sunglasses and laying them next to her glass on the table.
-Not recently.
Then, instead of immediately lining up for the dinosaur section, already crowded with people, Emma ran to the staircase leading upstairs and, once reached by the two men, turned to them.
-I thought it was the emphasis of the moment. Something...- John tried then.
Thank you for dinner, but I have to get back to work- Daniel said as he stood up and tucked half of the sandwich and of the cookies, which was also wrapped in multiple napkins, in the pockets of his jacket.
Moments later the waiter approached their table and presented them the wine and asked if they had already decided what to order and, after a quick glance at the menu, Sherlock ordered a vegetarian lasagna for himself and a porcini mushroom risotto for John in perfect Italian, leaving John speechless.
Once again, Hamish smiled at him and that little smile earned another kiss on his smooth forehead.
Sometimes I think it's so obvious that you can read it on my face... I want to record every part of your body in my Mind Palace, even those that you consider insignificant, I want to taste you... I want to touch you and leave my marks on you so that everyone can see that you are mine...
-Right..
The two men stared for a long time in silence, unable to find the right words to overcome what was perhaps the most difficult situation ever occurred in their friendship since the Baskerville case.
"I don't think so, she probably already has a complete dossier on all of our actions from the moment we met to date" Sherlock said.
"You don’t know that John!" said the other, trying to reason with him.
He knew he was sexy when he wore "Captain Watson" skin, it was thanks to his confident and affable attitudes that he had earned his nickname in the Army but to know that even Sherlock, so impenetrable, was impressed with it, embarrassed him for some strange reason, and led him to wonder what would have happened if he had exploited that information.
-What did you expect me to do? That I forgot the two years we had lived together, everything we had gone through and moved on with my life?
"Okay, I think it's time for me to go" Mary announced as she stood up.
If it wasn't for Mr. Micheals, I really don't know what would have happened to...- she said without finishing the sentence.
Or a tribute to two great minds, Sherlock thought, but kept his thoughts to himself.
I love my son, Dr. Watson and although I might never see him again, I know he will be fine; not because of Mycroft's cameras or Sherlock's huge intellect, but thanks to you- she said without ever taking her eyes off him.
Anthea? Impossible
"Are you still mad at me for that roast beef thing?" he asked.
Mr. Watson shook his head.
Greg flashed a smile and returned to sit in John's chair, happy to be back on known ground and to have back the sarcastic and moderately rude man he always knew.
The developments made in recent weeks were undone by the constant presence of journalists, camped outside the door, and by John's total closure towards Sherlock: there were no more cups of tea strategically placed next to the sofa, the reassuring presence of the doctor in the drawing-room gone.
-An intellectual fuck- helped the woman.
-Gregory…- whispered Mycroft looking down.
If we add the negligible fact that I had returned from Iran a few days before... I could have told the truth then, at that moment, but John is a terrible liar.
-Thank you... Although I know you don't really mean it- Molly replied with a smile.
Harry took a deep breath and met his gaze before starting to speak again.
During our investigation she died, or at least staged her death and for months Sherlock was simply miserable...-said John, leaving the sentence in half.
This time, however, Sherlock had decided to abandon his experiment and settle down next to John, on the other side of the sofa, while the doctor was focused on a movie on tv about a man mistaken for Jesus, making him laugh and sneer every two minutes.
-John! Do you really think I would tell something like this to my little brother? -she replied, pretending to be scandalized.
John was moving away from him for the umpteenth time, and Sherlock had no idea what to say to change his mind.
-The holster…- the boy simply said.
-I wanted to have sex with him. I have thought about it often, especially immediately after I met him, and I wish I could say that it was just as I had imagined it, but I must confess that it was quite disappointing.
"It seems you have everything under control…Carry on" Mycroft said, masking his surprise behind the mask of indifference he usually wore.
Not at all troubled by the fierce expression on Sherlock's face, Greg nodded.
John gave him a small smile.
______________________________________
-She’s also a manipulative bitch capable of any deception or lie to achieve her purpose.
He knew that Molly had a boyfriend; it was  evident since the last time he had seen her and  it had taken him a look in her apartment to realize it,  almost  a year and a half before, but for some reason he never thought it was the Detective  Dimmock .
-We knew those men; they had come to the camp a couple of times.
How could he not understand it before?
He tried unnecessarily to brush his hair with his fingers but a few moments later he declared himself defeated and brought his hands back to the stirring wheel.
“You stupid idiot! How can I be happy without you?" asked John.
A real room in which he can grow up, without you being forced to share your spaces with him.
Perfectly healthy was standing in front of him.
The girl seemed to think about a few moments, a hand abandoned protectively around her belly.
How can I live through another day
-Too young to be a doctor... And then that tie- said Sherlock, rolling his eyes again.
The notebook on which he had written a few important notes was placed on the tea table in front of him, next to a bottle of beer that was warming up quickly, the music in the background covering the noise of the shower filtering through the closed door of the bathroom.
What would Sherlock have thought of a relationship between him and Jack?
The restaurant was cozy and familiar with blue and white tiles on the walls, recalling the exterior, black-and-white pictures hanging on the walls to witness the decades of activity.
For the second time in thirty-eight years, Sherlock had found himself in front of a blank sheet, unable to draw his own conclusions.
I want to paint the front door... Mom would have been furious to see it in those conditions- commented John.
Greg nodded and for a few seconds stood motionless, not far from the window, not knowing what to do or say, until Sherlock freed him again from the weight of that choice.
But Sherlock was confident.
John shrugged.
After a few moments of silence in which neither of them could find a solution to get out of that impasse, John nodded and walked to the door.
Following his example, Sherlock kissed him, gently stroking his lips several times, before moving away and latching loosely his arms around John's waist again.
Where's the difference? -he asked genuinely confused.
John smiled and made to put his cell phone aside, but a sudden idea crossed his mind.
-And I don't know what to do because... Yes, you are right: I'm totally in love with Sherlock... You know? You and he would have got along very well once your lecture was over.

John sighed and decided to open his own sandwich, despite not having much appetite, but he was aware that he had to eat something; that night his stomach would stop him from eating even a pin and the last thing he wanted was to ruin that date because of him fainting.
Lestrade nodded, taking his coat and retrieving the gun from the drawer, then quickly exited the office.
"If I say that, I'm an idiot, if you say so, you're a genius" said caustic Anderson.
-Oh... It won't be a problem- said John firmly.
Greg let out an ironic laugh.
-Hey Doc! I heard my baby- she said happy to him.
-Ah, no. I still don't have enough power to shut down all the news outlets in England.
-Why's that? And how did you come up with such a silly idea?  -he asked her in disbelief.
"Did they have an affair at the time?" he asked.
John shrugged.
But he couldn't stop thinking about what Irene had told him.
The credits were flowing on the screen, at any moment John would turn off the television and announce that it was time to go to bed, thus forcing Sherlock to move away.
-I wonder if this little stimulation is enough to make you come-
Something had happened... Something that had escaped his attention, something that had unnerved Gregory, but as much as Mycroft struggled, he could not put his finger on the problem.
-I was there, sitting on the ledge, with my legs dangling in the void and here comes my personal guardian angel to sit next to me and talk until he can make me change my mind... Being rescued by the British government and his trusty right-hand man is something that happens once every two hundred years, like Halley's comet- he joked.
Greg gave him one last smile, before making his way to the office door.
"Was he a good father?" asked Greg curiously.
"Are you sure Sherlock?" asked John again, after closing the door behind them.
Next to them, wearing a lion's dress complete with tail and mane, was Jack Micheals.
"Corpses don't count" Sherlock said.
Her name was Irene.
"You're going to turn all girls' heads as you grow up" John said in a whisper, stroking his slightly wavy hair.
John burst out laughing and looked down for an instant; when their eyes met again a serious expression had appeared in the blue eyes of the doctor, and the jaw muscles had contracted leading him to assume his typically military pose.
All I ask you is that you make room in your life for us too- he told her.
-Should we expect some happy announcements? -
Then when you moved, it became obvious.
Sherlock shrugged.
-What? -
-The last case I allowed you to work on almost cost me my career.
Sherlock smiled at his son and effortlessly lifted the child placing him on his shoulders, a hand on the little one's bony knee to keep him still.
Mycroft had stared at him a few moments before nodding.
Hi everyone!
John was his friend. His only friend.
John closed the door behind them and took a deep breath: what a day.
So, what are you going to do considering that this little girl is the reason you can't go back to your family? -Sherlock asked trying not to be too harsh.
-Why don't you come with us on Monday? - Jack tenaciously carried on and proposed to him.
"Something that I didn't really think” Sherlock helped him.
That moment had marked a new beginning, from which they could no longer go back.
Since then there have been no set schedules, regular lunches or parties, but "interesting" murders, puzzles, endless weeks spent behind his desk or running between a crime scene the morgue and the Yard, returning home only when a shower and a change of clothes was imperative.
The moment the detective took the mug to his mouth, brought a smile on the doctor's lips, which John tried to hide behind his own cup, falling into the chair in front of the black-haired man.
-Oh, yes please, take me to the precinct, so I say hello to all your colleagues... If you only knew how many of them come by during their work hours- Daniel commented vicious, a harsh look in the eyes.
Looking up from his phone, John noticed that his father was staring at him cautiously.
The fault was certainly of his curiosity, of his insatiable need to know, even if this time he had gone beyond scientific knowledge, beyond the desire to excel in his field.
-Are you here for a threesome? -asked the boy.
John's face hardened more to those words, and for a moment Sherlock was certain that the other would strike him. again
He had never blamed his wife for cheating on him: when Sherlock pointed it out to him, he initially did not want to believe it, when he then confronted his reality, his first thought was to apologize.
He was aware that Mrs. Hudson had taken on the task of feeding Sherlock, trying to get him to least put on some of the weight lost during his absence, and he was infinitely grateful for that.
Then suddenly John Watson appeared in his life.
-Of course not! I'm certainly not going to change my life because he decided to return from the land of the dead- John said.
What had happened to him in his absence to justify that total closure against him?
Greg lifted his head from his plate and met his gaze.
-Okay... Greg, can I talk to you alone for a second? -he asked him and then walked down the hall, forcing the inspector to follow him.
Mycroft's eyes returned to focus on the doctor, making him the only object of his attention.
Satisfied with the corneal reactivity, John put the light back in his bag and focused on his lower lip.
Sherlock glanced at him briefly before nodding.
-It’s true!
Sherlock had remained silent for a few moments, unsure how to begin the speech, until he let a sigh leave his lips, preparing for the long speech that awaited him.
In this situation, one is never too careful" he said, placing a hand on the girl's shoulder.
"So let's try it like this" Sherlock said, drawing John's attention- I love you, John Hamish Watson.
With each button a new section of pale and perfect skin came to view, increasing John’s desire to imprint his own mark, to leave scratches on that skin so delicate yet so resistant.
"Do you know where John goes every Tuesday night?" he asked her.
-Why don't you do that? Are you afraid of my brother? -he teased him.
John stared at him for a few moments before nodding in his place, then retrieved his cup and taking a sip.
-Hey, I don't think I offended you when we were talking about your relationship with John - the inspector scolded him.
At least I didn't pretend to be dead for three years-commented unable to keep that remark to myself.
To find out where the heartache began
Homeward bound
John and Sherlock stared at each other for a few moments, Baby Girl's quiet sobs breaking a silence laden with electricity and unspoken words, until Sherlock turned with an elegant gesture, shrugged his shoulders to the rest of the audience and took refuge in his own bedroom, the door closed to temporarily protect him from the storm that would soon hit.
You would never say looking at his charming face what he could do with…-answered Jack.
"I can't stop you from living here if that's what you want" he said.
Recomposing and hiding his anger behind the usual mask of indifference, Sherlock opened the door and stood in the entranceway that separated his room from the living room, instantly finding John, a few meters from himself, standing between the sofa and the desk they used to share.
-I love London at night... It is as if a mystical and sensual entity were showing to our eyes as the sun went down.
Would Sherlock have been in favor of this change?
By then we had already realized that our story had no reason to continue, so we decided to be friends-concluded Jack.
Sherlock snorted, morphing his face in a bored expression.
Sherlock nodded and followed her.
Sally approached the blonde man with a candy between her fingers and an amused smile on her lips that led John to raise his eyes to the sky: this was just the kind of situation he hated being in!
She began by showing him what measures were needed to make a baby's bath perfect, how much soap to use, what was the right way to support Hamish during the bath, how to wash his hair avoiding to send foam into his eyes, repeating the same explanation several times without getting tired and encouraging him when she saw him fearful or hesitant.
The idea of Sherlock being overwhelmed by such a human feeling as lust made him even more furious, while his imagination  flooded him with images that had once been of two of them together and that now only worsen his anger and resentment: Sherlock's pale back stretched by effort, his perfectly drawn lips made more swollen by kisses and bites, the marks on his chest and neck left by two lips unable to detach  from that statuesque body... the satisfied expression on his face as he orgasmed.
I was discharged by the Army with honor as Captain Watson and returned to London- John concluded.
After all, it will be a win-win situation for you: I'd handle the unsolved cases, and John would continue to work with you on the new cases-
-Does it happen to you often?- John asked, putting needle and thread in his bag.
The girl smiled again, with greater conviction, and glanced at Boss.
I never thought we'd get to this- concluded Sherlock.
-Because you were lonely and sad, and you convinced yourself that this was your last chance to be happy, but mostly because you have a noble and kind heart and you thought this was the only possible solution to help the little girl's future without Baby Girl losing sight of her daughter.
"No one has the resources of the British government... - he commented.
-More or less.
-A girl? Since when do straight guys go around looking for a quickie with another man? - Daniel asked curious.
-To be honest, I don't know...-
Clearly surprised, Greg set back on his chair to be more comfortable and nodded slightly.
-He’s a Holmes."
I'm not sure I'll be able to post a new chapter next week so I want to wish you a MERRY CHRISTMAS AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR!
The scene that until a few moments before had led him to smile now caused a fire that corroded the walls of his stomach.
In the short period of distance an important factor had intervened to disturb the quiet of their daily routine and, although at first the detective was firmly convinced that it would take a few days to create a relationship between John and Hamish, now he had to deal with reality: the doctor seemed willing to bond with the child, but completely reluctant to strengthen the old relationship that until a few days ago had tied him to Sherlock.
"So, you became friends," he said, urging him to move on.
John tilted his head, in his mind the memory of the first time the detective had informed him of his "weirdness".
John passed his hand over his face trying to drive away that feeling of unreality that seemed to have taken hold of him.
There were few cases that Sherlock considered "interesting" that took place in rich neighborhood (
-Really?
-Dr. Watson. It's nice to see you again - Mycroft said welcoming him home.
Do I need you? Yeah, probably, as I think all the others at Scotland Yard do.
I tried to make Boss feel it too, but he's a man" said the girl, rolling her eyes.
And yet, this time there was something different...
Once again, the doctor took control of the situation; moving again in the embrace, he moved his lips to his left ear.
John fought against the need to look for Sherlock with his eyes, to reassure himself that the man was indeed there in the living room, and not a figment of his imagination, nodding in turn.
-SHERLOCK! -
-I'm not aware of the exact reason, but I think it's because of you.
Greg nodded.
"Here he is" said John with a triumphant smile.
With a long sip he finished the wine still in his glass and met for a moment Sherlock’s gaze, aware that despite his curiosity, the man would interrupt that conversation at the first hint of uneasiness on John's part.
"I'll see what I can do” John simply said.
What was really difficult was finding the courage to enter the restaurant and face his own demons.
Greg nodded slowly, aware that he would not be able to know anything more.
was Baker Street with the perfectly neat chaos, Mrs. Hudson and her cookies, the light of the lamppost coming in from the window next to the lectern and lighting up the music sheets allowing him to keep playing  all night.
Greg nodded.
John took a deep breath and tried to control the anger he felt growing within himself.
Before the situation escalated, John decided to take control of it.
For a few moments the boy stared at him almost as his words had come out in a different language than English once it left his lips, before frowning.
So it has a deep meaning for you, maybe it helped you during these months of solitude, it overcame your insecurities, maybe it became the first song you listened to in the morning even before you got out of bed."
-Look whose talking! I have a good job that allows me to know important personalities...-
-Then it means I'm going to yell Sherlock around the house and just whisper William when it's just the two of us…Maybe in the bedroom- John said, licking his bottom lip with the tip of his tongue and touching Sherlock's earlobe.
-This is my number.
Even though Sherlock had gone out of his way to make things difficult for him...
Someone who loves him... And despite your constant protests, I'm sure you're the right person- she said in a still voice.
She lived with her mother just outside London and judging by the number of names she had said during the conversation, she had many friends.
-They don’t need a lot of space: we can turn the apartment C into a huge tub full of ice and feed them with fresh fish every day- Sherlock proposed again.
"Maybe I overreacted" he simply said, enclosing his apology in those few words.
The way I see it, I'm still the only resident of this apartment.
At the time of our relationship he was in rehab and I think he needed someone by his side to help him on that path, step by step... that made him understand the importance of that program, but even then there was always a limit... - said Jack again.
Sherlock looked at his face with a thoughtful expression.
A small smile turned upwards John's lips.
-I was in total paranoia, convinced that that was the most logical solution, the only way out... I guess I even thought I'd do my friends a favor, that I would free them from a burden, but I had forgotten how stubborn they could be- he said with a small smile.
And surprisingly, Sherlock realized that that was the truth.
Sherlock nodded slowly and bent down to kiss the kid's hair before Hamish ran away to the sofa, sitting next to Hope.
For him,
The thought of not knowing anything about John annoyed him; he was now convinced that there was something that he had not been told, that escaped his comprehension; the surveillance work done by Mycroft in those years had been clumsy and full of holes, completely below his capabilities so the only possible explanation was that something had to have happened during his absence and Mycroft had preferred to keep him in the dark.
-Anything else? -
After the horrific scene witnessed by half of Scotland Yard's investigation team, Greg Lestrade could only send Sherlock away from the crime scene as the man would not be of any help to them in his agitated state.
Your instructor tried to intervene by spraying dry ice on your leg, then bandaged it, as evidenced by the slight swelling at the height of your left thigh.
The detective arched an eyebrow.
Whether it was good, however, has yet to be proved...- he added then almost overthought.
-What did you expect? It's a press conference, not a crime scene- the Inspector said.
It had been a long week, compounded by the problems he and Greg had had three weeks ago and that had not completely abandoned him and  Mycroft needed to go home, spend some time with Gregory and make sure things were back to normal, to make sure that the mysterious problem that had driven them away did not yet hover like a specter between them.
He remained silent, letting his gaze wander through the kitchen, posing on the photo of the famous Jack; Mrs. Hudson followed him gaze and laughed merrily.
Is it possible that a client had brought a newborn with him?
In a few hours John would be home and finally he could explain to the man the reasons that had prompted him to stage his death.
"It’s a girl?" she asked in a whisper.
"Thank you for accepting my invite, I wasn't sure you'd show up" he said, breaking his silence.
-Don't tell me she caught you having sex with another man-
That night, though, he would tell him everything.
But above all, what did he want? Was he ready to leave behind a life of solitude, completely focused on his own work and his experiments to make room for another person?
The detective shook his head.
-As much as I love London at night, I don't think I would have fallen into your bed with such a trick-commented John.
I know you've become attached to this little girl, despite the professional ethics that prohibits you to get involved with your patients, and I know why you haven't yet advanced the possibility of adoption with Baby Girl-Sherlock said in a calm voice.
Irene shrugged.
For the first time since that madness began, Sherlock took a moment to look at the small body in his arms.
"What happened then?"asked the blonde man curious.
-Stop being a fool!
Sherlock opened it and the first thing he saw was a photograph of John; not the John Watson he remembered, but what had survived his death by reinventing himself in something completely different at least in his  eyes.
Sighing frustrated, John pulled his phone out of his pocket and opened the text, freezing as soon as he read the words.
That's why at about eleven o'clock in the evening Greg grabbed his coat, turned off the lights in his office, said goodnight to the few agents still behind their desks and headed for the elevators.
-That doesn't excuse what I said.
Greg sighed in frustration.
-Of course it makes sense- John retorted with a hinted smile, moving his head slightly to meet Sherlock’s gaze.
Boss will have to wait another month before seeing and hear him kicking-explained John trying to avoid a quarrel between the two.
For the first time since his return, Sherlock had broken his silence and was speaking to him.
"What happened?" Sherlock asked, his voice slightly lower.
"You are the name on the gravestone" said the little girl, looking at Mycroft.
"I'm not surprised that Scotland Yard is so incompetent if Dimmock can't even put these few clues together" he said.
John shrugged.
You can't stand the idea that someone else is replacing you, that I might be interested in someone else" said John, unable to hide his disbelief.
-This naive attitude does not suit you, Gregory dear-Mycroft comment bitter.
-Monkeys-
-So the best solution for you is to go back to her, sparing both of us months of suffering and clearly unnecessary attempts-concluded the blonde without considering the interruption of the other man.
"Is there a problem?" he asked, trying to hide his irritation.
True love true love
Sherlock felt on him Mrs. Hudson's gaze and met the woman's eyes.
"That our dear Sherlock has said your name every time he came…" she replied, confirming his fears.
-Listen could you call Mycroft and have someone come and get him back? I can't...- he added.
Actually, if I'm honest I couldn't think of anything else, but I decided it was better to let it go- Greg said sincere.
Sherlock was back.
-Since when are interested in S&M? -asked Sally amused.
-Oh Mycroft, what did you do? -
If I were you, I would look in the clubs where S&M sex is practiced, especially private and exclusive clubs- said John.
But when it came to prove to me that I was important to you, you betrayed me.
-Yes, now it's even unthinkable - had quickly retorted Mycroft.
Sherlock let out a frustrated groan and was about to throw his cell phone against the wall, held back only by a new incoming message.
"Why don't you process your question?" said Sherlock, quietly silencing Lestrade, staring at the journalist.
The British official looked at him, remaining silent, waiting for more information.
Immersed in his thoughts, John was completely oblivious to where his feet were taking him, only partially aware that he was still in central London, in the crowd of tourists who besieged those places any day of the week.
"Are you ready to tell me what happened?" she asked.
If you come to offer yourself as a human sacrifice to save someone against a homicidal maniac and then agree to blow up, it really must be love-comment John, slightly lowering his voice, finding it hard to remember those moments.
-What's his purpose then? -
He quickly observed the rest of his body, seeing the scratches on his shoulders and  bites marks Sherlock had left in the hollow between his shoulder and neck, on his right side, and inside his left arm.
Greg stared at him a few moments before nodding.
What had scared him the most was learning about Mrs. Hudson's health problems and the radical change that had taken place in John.
On the morning of April 16, John Watson was on duty at the clinic.
John breathed deeply and rubbed his chin thoughtful before smiling a little.
Meeting his lover’s ice blue eyes again, John bent over him to lay his lips on Sherlock’s full, swollen ones, sinking his tongue into his mouth, licking every hidden corner; one hand resting on Sherlock's chest, John pushed him slightly backwards ending their kiss, letting the other fell on the bed.
John remained silent, aware that the long speech was not over yet and, above all, because he was unable to put his confused thoughts in order.
"Secrets?" he asked, jokingly raising an eyebrow.
-Okay, let's all calm down and do our job!- Greg scolded them, trying to restore order and peace.
"What are you and Hamish doing here?" he asked, straightening his back, his gaze fixed on the detective.
Both Boss and John were clearly aware that Baby Girl could not take care of that child, not if she kept living on the streets...
Sherlock smiled, despite his slightly red face, and propped up his elbows to watch John get rid of his pants and boxers annoyingly twisted around his ankles.
Sherlock had allowed himself the temptation of sex only a few times in his life, and each time he had failed to understand all the enthusiasm that surrounded those few technical and repetitive actions that accompanied it.
The man shrugged his shoulders, then carefully reflected on the events of the last few years but went back with his mind to one episode.
-Why is that? Sherlock is funny-
It wasn't the first time he'd heard it, even Mycroft loved his hairs, but Greg couldn't understand their appeal.
"I like your hair" he said.
And probably will be for the rest of our lives.
"So did you find out anything?" Greg asked.
He remembered perfectly that he had arrived at "Pride" with Greg and Jack and was astounded to find Sherlock there, perfectly at ease in that place as in any other situation he had been involved in.
John wet his lips inexplicably dry with the tip of his tongue, and did to speak again, but the waiter materialized for the umpteenth time at their table to ask them if everything had been to their liking and if he could take away the dishes.
Sherlock remained silent for a few moments, coming to terms with the new truth hidden in those words: John had replaced him.
Homeward bound
Have fun and take all the adoration of the press but keep me out of this hideous circus! - concluded with clenched teeth.
But above all, what infuriated him was the certainty that those dreams, those thoughts had not touched the analytical mind of the consultant even once.
-Why don't you keep me company? -
"Where are you from?" asked Greg, before taking a long sip from his own cup.
Faithful to me
"He must have taken that from you" Sherlock answered, raising his face from John’s shoulder.
-No matter how much John tried to rebuild his life, or how much it has changed, in these three years he has never stopped missing you.
The man smiled.
"Ah, John..." Greg called, staying silent for a few moments. -Don’t let Sherlock follow you-
Greg turned off the engine, without bothering to properly park the patrol car, and got out, smiling at the beautiful woman who was a few feet away from him.
- He will tell you that he did it out of boredom, to help his own cognitive processes, but the truth is that the death of Alastair has completely destroyed his spirit... And I couldn't protect him.
She just needed to look at the child once and her eyes had sparkled, like she found herself in front of a new corpse to analyzed.
Also, if you can keep up with the father, I don’t think you will have much difficulty with the miniature version-answered the old man with a small smile on his lips.
__________________________________
John chuckled.
Many times, the man had risked his life, sometimes because of his dangerous lifestyle, other times because of the reckless choices made in the past.
Sherlock had followed him a few moments later, flooding his hand with the sticky and warm proof of his pleasure, murmuring his name and laying his forehead on his shoulder, wrapping an arm around John’s waist to better support himself.
He had only been to that building once before and, even at the time, he had to stop at the edge of the world that was swarming within it because he lacked the necessary authorization.
John looked at him for a few seconds, stroking his beard, in a gesture Sherlock had now identified as a calming one, only to sigh.
It's a risk for me to give you these pills every month too, but I do it without the slightest doubt or second thoughts because I know they will help you and the baby feel good.
"But you always came back" he said a few moments later.
The policeman's life is hard" he said.
It was a noise he had never heard and never expected to hear at 221B Baker Street.
"Now, back to us: how was it? "Sherlock asked again.
"Well, if the British government can't get away from this invitation, neither can we" he said, unaware that his words made Sherlock smile happily.
After all, I had more spare time...-comment John ironically.
The woman had always contacted him encrypted cell phones.
-Obviously- he repeated.
Someone hummed softly with the music, and for a moment Sherlock was tempted by the image of John Watson preparing breakfast in the kitchen in boxer and dressing gown, smiling happily.
Is it possible that he was still in bed?
John held that look for a few moments and then shook his head.
"Maybe, but that doesn't mean it hurts less" the woman said.
Sherlock shrugged, then let the other man take the child.
-Mr. Holmes- Mary simply said.
One is decidedly more adventurous and risk-loving, while the other, despite loving adventure in the same way feels the need for stability, constant reassurances, of something that reminds her that there is a world beyond her adventures with the Doctor.
John Watson was an anomaly.
-Sometimes you're really morbid. The last thing I'd like before I go to sleep is to rethink the sexual preferences of the British government- John retorted, making both Sally and Jack laugh.
-Okay, why not... After all, you're the one who gets the worst deal in this situation-he retorted in the same joking tone as the other.
Without even seeing him, John could guess his posture: his back  straight, his hands sunk into the pockets of his jeans, a smile on his face.
How come I've never met you before? - she asked him.
John walked in the kitchen, trying to fill the silence that had descended into the room: he filled and put on the kettle, took three clean cups and arranged in each a tea bag, opened the pantry in search of some chocolate biscuit aware that chocolate biscuits always put Sherlock in a good mood and put the sugar bowl close to the detective's cup.
-Despite what will happen in the future I am not sorry-repeated.
-Why would I? -
It's not my medical field, but so far, I've managed to get away with it thanks to my memories and notes from University and the internship...
-Becoming invisible so that no one could hurt his feelings anymore-concluded Greg.
-Breathe- she said with a soothing voice.
And all my hopes into bits of clay?
Looking quickly around, John picked the lock and moved the chain just enough to open a single part of the gate, entering into the small courtyard.
The same discourse could also be applied for himself: he had risked his life several times during his years of service in the Army, or running fearlessly behind the most varied criminals on the streets of London, and finally he had been on the verge of throwing away his own life several times when Sherlock was away.
The direct interested blushed slightly at that nickname, gave to him during the war, but both Greg and Jack laughed.
But he would never have expected a statement like last night's.
Wrong again.
As if he heard a siren call, the doctor broke off from the bar and moved into the crowd coming towards Sherlock, stopping at close range, turning to him with a smile that was reserved only for the detective.
"Stephanie gave it to me.
-You're right. I know you're right- he said. - I promise to talk to him as soon as he gets back to London, but in the meantime promise me that you won't tell Sherlock anything about this-
"Just to know... - meddled Mycroft, leading the detective to look up at the group of adults- But what the heck are you talking about?" he asked.
Intrigued, John opened the link and moments later his room was immersed in the sound of a keyboard.
His thoughts were interrupted by the insistent whistle of the kettle and with a mechanical move, he poured water into the mug watching as it quickly colored.
-It's simple: in eight  weeks Baby Girl’s baby will be born and then she will still be homeless, but she will also have to take care of her daughter-began Sherlock in a practical tone, without expecting any reply.
Greg nodded.
"What the hell have you done this time?” he asked clearly upset as he advanced into the living room with a firm glare.
He walked to the door of his room and managed to catch an amused laugh that was definitely John, which led him to smile again before turning the door handle and then suddenly stop himself on the doorstep for the scene that was presented before his eyes.
-Don’t be upset. It's a protective mechanism.
He heard him exchange a few words with Mrs. Hudson, and while he waited Sherlock settled down more comfortably for the battle that awaited him in few minutes.
You know perfectly well what my feelings for you are... -Sherlock said, abandoning for the first time that calm and aloof air that had sustained him throughout their discussion.
-Fuck the tea-purred John, his face still hidden in the perfect corner between neck and shoulder, tormenting the skin with his teeth and tongue, leaving behind a red bruise.
"You stupid asshole” John murmured through his teeth.
Oh, right…
The elegant clothes that a few hours ago in Sherlock's eyes had been the preparations for a romantic date, now took on a totally different meaning: they demonstrated the strength and courage of that enormous enigma that in his eyes was John Watson.
"So, the music helped you cover the silence" said the other, wondering why it had been so difficult for him to understand.
"I can only imagine how detailed Mycroft’s files are" said John, winning a smile from the woman.
-I agree.
The two men followed Mr. Watson into the house to the living room where the elderly man stood at the doorstep of the room, glanced briefly at John who had dropped on the couch almost like dead weight,  heedless of his hands dirty of red paint and then went back staring at Sherlock, a short distance from himself.
"You know what I mean, or do you want me to become brutally specific as I can be?"  retorted Sherlock.
Why was he here? Did he have to force the gate and get inside?
Despite the late hour, the streets of the city center were always crowded with tourists and Londoners who indulged in a "special" evening, but Greg managed to get to Soho without any problems, showing his badge to get free parking in the parking lot two streets away from the crime scene.
Sherlock breathed a frustrated sigh, putting both hands in his curls, as he often did during a difficult case to encourage concentration.
Sherlock arched an eyebrow at those words ready for a sarcastic joke, but John sighed and walked away, making quick strides towards the apartment door.
-What?-
"I'm confused" she admitted, the words a murmur that John could barely hear.
"Do you know what day it is tomorrow?"she asked.
The detective watched him from the window until he was too far away among the bright night lights and when his gaze turned again on the tabletop, Greg told himself that the last thing he needed was to repeat the experience he had with Sherlock.
-Paris is decidedly overrated-Sherlock said in a bored tone.
No noisy steps on the stairs, no slammed doors, no explosions or gunshots against the wall.
-Okay, the boy, was called Tom Baker and he was 17. The girl, Alison Wilson, is 16.
-Well, Mr. Holmes. If you're here asking questions, it's clear you've never tried it.
"Try not to be too detailed" the good doctor said.
In addition, he also recognized that glitter that shone in the girl's laughing eyes and made him realize that, although they were still children, Alison was really convinced that she had found the love of her life.
-It's a movie with subtitles, it's obvious it's going to be deadly boring! - commented Sherlock, determined not to back down in his convictions.
Those eyes were still fixed on him, insistent, intrusive, as if they wanted to make a hole in his back to get to his soul; force him with silence and the sole force of the gaze to turn around and face it.
The room consisted of two dancefloors, one central, the second in the side area.
John met his eyes and returned the smile that was slowly bending the black-haired man’s lips.
movement, Sherlock focused his attention on John, removing the bow from the strings interrupting the symphony in half; the blond stared at him with a raised eyebrow in what had always been an expression of benevolent reproach, and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
I never did.
"Well I got punched, didn’t I?" the man commented.
"Is everything ready for the big announcement?" asked Mycroft, carrying a few pieces of chicken chow mein to his lips.
Daniel stared at the British official's long, stern face for a few seconds before pulling back the blankets that had so far hidden him partially from the other man's gaze and moved with difficulty until he sat down.
That simple bickering, like other conversations they had in the past, was instead a symbol of normality, proof that his life should not be sucked back into a black hole because of the return of Sherlock Holmes.
On the few occasions when he and Sherlock had been alone, the consultant had not missed an opportunity to point out the number of files on his desk, all clearly unsolved cases, each time volunteering to deal with it, as if he were a recruit just arrived at the police station and eager to make himself useful.
, he always says-
"As you wish” he simply said.
The question took him by surprise and for a few moments he remained silent, considering what to say.
I don't want anything to happen to you or the baby" John explained.
"I promised John I'd keep an eye on you, and if I know you at least a little bit, I'm willing to bet you haven't touched food since John walked out of that door yesterday morning- Greg said.
-Then we have a deal-
Sherlock shrugged off at those words, while accepting a toy that Hamish was giving him to attract his attention and smiling at the child.
-Didn’t you listen the conversation I had with your daughter?
He rested his arm on his knees and hid his face there, trying to hide that moment of weakness from the sight of strangers and colleagues.
He knew that Mrs. Hudson loved him and Sherlock equally, just like a mother, and that she would do everything in her capacity to avoid the confrontation that would happen, as soon as the two would come face to face.
The detective shrugged his shoulders and the next moment John started the episode, and for a few minutes the silence fell in the room, until the Doctor appeared on the screen.
And in his case, there was no need for a Holmes in depth analysis to find his most undisclosed desire.
All to hide that dark part of himself...
Molly's marriage occupied a smallest part of his thoughts, accompanied by gratitude to the woman for all the help she had given him during those years, and to the relief that he would finally no longer be the object of her clumsy advances.
"It wasn't my choice!" the man defended himself.
The wrinkles around his eyes had been heightened, as had the black dark circles that accompanied him since he started the police academy.
The detective's attention returned to John when he felt the deep breath above him.
"If there's not an emergency" Greg said, taking the beer Jack had left on the table for him, carefully following John's movements and casting a glance at Sherlock, taking a sip from his own bottle.
Since returning to London, Sherlock had never seen the doctor in the company of his conquests, but he had always believed that John had avoided having him meet them to prevent embarrassment.
First of all, the next time you feel the need to stage your death, if you really believe that I can be of no help, the least you can do is inform me, so that I will not spend my days crying for my son’s death-she said allowing Sherlock a few seconds  to make objections and receiving a nod of assent in return.
-Just give me ten minutes to change and I'm coming with you-
After the phone call with Mrs. Hudson, John threw himself into his work, showing his affable and loving side to every patient who set foot in his  office, even managing to exchange some joke with a 13-year-old boy embarrassed by an overly apprehensive mother.
Molly approached one of the work tables and placed her elbows on top of it, sitting on a stool.
The clinic had begun to come alive at the end of their phone call and, after saying goodbye to his sister, John had set out to work, visiting the various patients assigned to him.
-Processing information is a tiring procedure-replied serious the detective.
John lowered his head slightly.
-Which one? Sarah, who had the worst date of her life with me and who was the first to understand the true nature of my feelings towards you? Or Jeanette who told me that you and I would be happy together? -he asked him, clearly amused.
John shrugged his shoulders.
The man never spoke of feelings, trying to hide his own under a mask of indifference well developed over the years, so being asked such personal questions made him uncomfortable and above all annoyed him for his ignorance on the matter.
What should I do after dinner? Do I have to invite him somewhere else or do I have to call a cab and go straight home? -he explained.
"I would never do that" he responded, meeting her eyes.
The blonde's thunderous laughter rang out in the living room, making both Sherlock and Hamish smile.
John stared at her surprised by the sudden change of speech.
"She might be slightly annoyed that I haven’t visited her at the Mansion since I returned to London" Sherlock said in a whisper.
He had expected Sherlock to ask him to leave at any moment, while the detective had other thoughts in his head.
-What do you know about it?- Anderson pestered him again.
-141 Cleveland St.-
It was officially over.
John nodded and watched Sherlock turn his back on him to begin the preparation of the drink, although both were aware that the detective was totally unable to prepare a tea even remotely drinkable.
-Right... Just to be clear: is this your way of seducing me? -Greg asked amusedly.
Sherlock nodded and then raised the kettle again.
"Oh, I like that one too: no one makes chocolate cookies like Mrs. Hudson" Emma said.
-I was the one looking for her- Sherlock confessed.
-Would you know how to build it? -Sherlock asked again, this time addressed to Emma.
-So, how does it work? Are you going to let me give you a blow job and then show me your badge or do you want to show it now to get free treatment? -he asked Greg with a cold voice.
- Do you think this is appropriate for a woman of my age? -she asked him upset.
-John won't be home until Wednesday night.
Sherlock, still sitting on the floor, regained some of his confidence in those words, knowing that he could not do much to help John in his fight against the ghosts of the past.
He passed a hand on his jaw, feeling under his fingers the bristles of a day, considering for a moment whether to shave or not, then deciding in favor.
He asked me about school, the subjects I had chosen to graduate into, and what my grades were, and then he asked me what I would do after high school.
-John needs to remember how good we were together, that there's no one who can understand him as the me and vice versa... That's why I invited him to dinner this evening- Sherlock added almost as an afterthought.
The noise of the blaring basses shook the walls of the room violently.
-I dare not even imagine how complex your Holmes can be...
"After your fake suicide" Molly replied, frowning.
So the tension, the fear that had accompanied him all day long had been unmotivated... John had no intention of leaving him.
-Sherlock... I think it's better if we stop-John said without looking at the detective.
Greg at first tried to get him to eat, but then John kicked him out... I think he said something that wasn't very pleasant.
He cleared his throat and returned to meet Sherlock's gaze.
"Do you really think it's a good idea to take the kids to the Parade?” Sherlock asked for the umpteenth time turning towards John.
He turned and slowly walk back to the detective, again looking in his blue eyes.
); then there were others from which John was very happy to stay away because of the halo of secrecy that they carried behind
Greg shook his head slightly, hinting at a small smile.
Sherlock glanced bored at the waiter, and John could not hold back the slight smile that curved his lips: that poor boy did not know what he was against.
I was convinced it was a complete waste of time and I wouldn't even have been there if it wasn't mandatory... Anyway, I was there wandering around the stands when I stopped next to the Army and this man started making conversation: the Captain told me about life in the Army, how much it strengthened your character and allowed you to make friendships that would last for the rest of his life, he told me that the Army allowed me to travel  the world...-
"I'm sorry, but I'm not ready to come back yet" he said.
Hello everyone!
Moving quickly, Greg grabbed his overcoat from the chair in front of his desk, put it on and walked out of his office, heading for the elevators heedless of Donovan's voice calling his name behind him, his cell phone back against his ear looking for someone who could give him some explanation.
The doctor looked up to the sky, trying not to be overwhelmed by the desire to yell at the woman to go to hell and get out of that restaurant forgetting every moment of that meeting.
-Sherlock... Do you really think that if it was all over between us, I would have come to the Zoo with you and Misha? -John asked him trying to make him realize his mistake.
"Stay out of my life" John said, with what Sherlock always identified as "Captain" John Watson’s voice.
Sherlock took two more steps stopping by the entrance of the living room and stared at John, the man who had entered his life with the intention of sharing an apartment and who had quickly become his best friend, the secret object of his desire and the only person in the world whom Sherlock would put his life at risk against Moriarty and his henchmen.
-Hope-answered the girl looking at John.
John, one cup in each hand, entered the living room and placed both cups on the coffee table at a safe distance from Hamish, before turning a curious glance to his partner.
Similar in shape or color to the one in which he lived now, but with a fundamental change: someone who loved him unconditionally despite being perfectly aware of his many flaws.
Those desires, or rather repressed feelings, which he had hidden from everyone and himself, with the return of Sherlock, had returned stronger than ever, but now the nostalgia and remorse for the unspoken words and the gestures never made turned in anger.
Sally stepped forward and stopped a few feet away from Sherlock.
Younger.
-They always do-answered Sherlock for both of us.
"Have you ever caused any explosion?" asked John, again focused on his dessert.
Although his intentions were to stay awake by the window to catch a brief glimpse of John returning from the club with Lestrade, the weariness of the past days and the jet leg got the better of him.
-If they don't blow up before-added the other.
A slight smile had bent the woman's lips.
-No, I will not.
Given his experience with drugs, he would never forgive me, probably he would have criticized me for the pathetic and boring substance that had caused my addiction.
I'd buy a dog and continue our usual life, maybe slightly less dangerous, until we're too old to run after criminals-
-I think you’ve really lost your pretty head for our dear detective... Despite all the anger and frustration, you feel now, you're really in love with it.
John thought for a minute, what did he want? He wanted Sherlock to be ok and back to normal. He wanted to go and solve a case. He wanted to comfort Greg when Sherlock mispronounces his name, yet again. He wanted to wake up, make tea and pour two cups for him and Sherlock. He wanted to get all this over with already and he knew Sherlock would be more than ready to get things back to normal, ignoring all his problems, but John knew if this would happen, at the next argument no matter how small, he’d break completely and god knows what would happen.
She always had that polite smile around Sherlock, just a little flirty, but not too much. Not now though. He could barely see any emotion on her face and Molly wasn’t facing him so he couldn’t read her properly. But he knew she was upset, a tad angry even, Sherlock deduced from the way she was gripping the steering wheel. There was something else though, something he just couldn’t understand and he might even ask about this.
“What… Uhm, what did you say?” he tried to be gentle, realising he had scared her for a second which sent a pang of guilt right through his heart.
“I knew that and I didn’t ask anything, I just took care of the wound.” A small smile made its way on Sherlock's face that John hadn't missed. He looked good, in his long black coat with the collar up, the curly mess on top of his hair and his icy blue eyes. He looked so good. He was so beautiful in John’s eyes and that smile topped everything, that bloody smile that he rarely wore, it looked so good. And it all made John nervous, Sherlock Holmes made John Watson so very nervous.
He was laying there, so peaceful, wrapped in wires and connected to beeping machines. John sat down on a chair near his friend and Mycroft stood beside him, just watching. The very stoic soldier started to cry again. His older brother started shaking, he thought about all the scenarios possible and about having to bury his beloved brother.
The doctor came out, both males jumping up and bombarding him with questions. “He’s fine, he made it, barely. He took quite a huge dose but we managed to save him. He’s in a medically induced coma now, he’ll wake up in a few hours. You can go and see him if you’d like.'' With that, the doctor left to see another patient and the pair walked in Sherlock's room.
When he got to the door, he was a bit hesitant, not knowing if he actually wanted to go in. Molly didn’t rush him, she just stood behind, waiting patiently not saying anything. Freak. Show-off. Arrogant. You machine.
But how gracious did everything fall down? It all went to hell in a few days. A few days in which John decided to ignore Sherlock completely, to lock him out and to blame him for what has happened. And everyone was so focused on John, they forgot about Sherlock. Oh, how wrong of them. Even though Sherlock was a self-proclaimed high-functioning sociopath that doesn’t feel anything, John knew. He saw past this facade, he wasn’t just a machine, no. He had feelings, but would never share them, not even with himself. That’s why things like this happened.
He was now in the hospital, waiting for the days to pass and to get out, to go home and find a way to deal with everything, or ignore everything. Sherlock thought back to the time he was eating fries with what he thought was Faith. He was standing on the edge of the bridge, telling the girl her life isn’t her own, that she won’t be the one to grieve and suffer, yet he thought about jumping himself. What did it matter now? No one cared about him anymore, Molly, Greg and Mrs Hudson probably got tired of him being an asshole all the time, Mycroft didn’t like his guts from the moment he was born and John… John never wanted to see him ever again, that’s what he thought at least.
Yeah. That’s right. He forgot Sherlock was his friend. And he treated him so miserable these last couple of weeks, not to mention what he did to his face. If Mary would have seen him, like this, the way he acted towards Sherlock she would for sure assassinate him. How could he have been so stupid? His friend was already high, on drugs, not in a good place and somehow he still let him go without saying anything. That and he forgot how Mary wasn’t only his wife, but Sherlock’s friend as well.
