“I took classes with an ex-boyfriend.” She uncovered the basket and pulled bread out for each of them. “He was like you, absolutely horrible. The instructor even pulled us aside and asked if we’d like a refund. We kept through it though, his pride was so bad, and he managed to make one decent thing — omelets. For weeks after that was all he made. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, I almost think those omelets were the reason we broke up.” She scraped her fork along the plate. “It’s why I can’t even look at eggs again, let alone eat them.”
“Are you sure about that, son? They’ve got a shit ton of money.” Bobby glanced back at the building. “And thousands of other stores to support them.”

His mother patted his cheek. “Yes, thank you dear. We should be headed off.” His parents and their respective spouses walked towards the entrance, largely leaving Castiel by himself.
Late evening, the door slammed open and Honey burst into his room to join him on the bed. “Babe, are you in here? Honey, can you tell me where Castiel is? Bark twice if you’re with him.”
“It okay, there’s plenty to do while we wait for you to get hungry.” She stalked towards him and undid his tie. “After all, don’t you have coffee with dessert?”
“I’ve got dessert in the fridge. I’ll go get it.” She stood up and left.

The problem was breaking up with April
The waitress returned with their orders — burgers for both of them — and flashed Dean a smile before she left. Cas squirted ketchup to the side of his fries. “The problem is that I thought I was doing that for years. You put your business face away when you get home. I don’t know anymore if I want to keep that up. It’s frustrating, it’s exhausting, it’s —” He stabbed a french fry into the ketchup. “It’s too much. And I don’t think I want to do it anymore. Look how it turned out with you. Where’s my boundary between business and personal when I saw you in and out of it? Where’s my line? I think I’d rather give up the whole mess and just be

He licked his lips again. “I’d like to get to know you.”
“Krissy came into the store today and,” he sank into the couch, “she dragged us all out to see the new Milton Books they’re building. In my neighborhood.” He tugged the throw blanket over his shoulders. “I don’t know what I’m going to do.”
Pat Honey for me.
I’ll start with that I feel we’ve shared enough personal info that me explaining the in’s and out’s of my last relationship is not the deepest we’ve ever gone, but thank you for respecting the outcome of my decision. My relationship with my ex was...interesting to say the least. We had been together prior to meeting you, but when we started interacting, we had only been dating for a couple of months. My parents adored her (and if I’m honest nudged my towards her), so it was inevitable I’d spend more time with her. By fall, she had practically moved into my apartment, but still occasionally spent time at her place. And what should have been a time when we got closer, I never felt more farther apart. We both have demanding jobs we’re dedicated to, so I didn’t expect us to spend anymore time together, but we were almost latched at the hip at social engagements. She tried to keep us together, but I was too much of a carpet to tell her I didn’t think it was working. I didn’t realize until we broke up that most of those social and work engagements were for her, so suddenly I had all this time. To be fair, I was also working on a major project at work at the time, which was also finished around the time I broke up with her. Hence the free time, the hobbies, and knitting.
, because ‘it’s new’. Something with an ‘S’ I think?”
“Yeah, you talk. But I can always tell when a message is from him because it’s like you light up.”
Dean gripped his plate. Here stands the guy who has put him through so much stress and anxiety, a juxtaposition of ‘Corporate Asshole’ and ‘Good with Kids’. “You can’t recreate that kind of experience in your superstores. They’re impersonal and void of care.”
He went up to the counter and ordered another slice of pie and a refill on his coffee. The barista smiled and put extra whipped cream on his pie. Was it that obvious that he was stood up? He dropped his change in the tip jar. If he was going to camp here for a large portion of the night he could at least compensate the staff. He settled down in an armchair instead of the table he originally sat at and snuggled down. Maybe it wasn’t the night he expected, but it would be nice.

“I’ll be able to charm them back. Now get some sleep or order soup or something. Doctor’s orders.”
Dean scowled at his calculator and shoved himself away from the dining room table. Fuck this.
“Well, I’m glad because there was one reason I waited to tell you. I put in a job offer here and I got accepted. I’ll be starting in January.”
Dean grunted and shoved the calculator to the side. “Yeah, but Mom was a natural at what she did. I’m just eking it along.”
“Didn’t you also mention it to Krissy or Kevin?”
“You got it.”

He stared down at the pavement. “I know.”
Jack tugged on Castiel’s trousers. “Can we go on the boat?”
“At least not yet,” mumbled Krissy as she turned to walk back to the store.
He stared out at the cafe, scanning it. “I’m too embarrassed to admit it.”
“‘Bout what?” She fumbled for the cabinet door and pulled out a mug.
Claire laughs and pockets the change in her leather jacket. “You and Dean are too easy to rile up.”
“Well, beyond the third degree and jabs, I enjoyed spending time together in the cafe. Maybe I’m a glutton for punishment, but I don’t have many friends. The high powered executive lifestyle doesn’t leave much in the way for making friends. Deals? Sure. But not many friendships are made without some financial gain to come with it.”
“I’m surprised. Not like you can’t see the signs from across the street.”
“I — uh.” He tapped the sides of his cup.
He shrugged. “I think it was a long time coming. We were good during undergrad, but we’ve got different ambitions. We’re still good friends. Get together every now and then for coffee and catch up. She’s moving to Colorado after the new year. Got a job lined up at an art place with an old friend of hers — Sarah I think.”
“Okay, I’m gonna ignore any kind of backward reasoning that got you to that conclusion for a second. I’m not gonna tell you that no matter what you choose they’ll love you, because there’s a hot chance they probably won’t. But you’ve got to decide whose happiness matters to you more: theirs or yours.” He punched his shoulder. “And if you don’t say yours we’re gonna be having a longer conversation.”
Castiel held up a dented carton of eggs. “I think they’ve already suffered the most.”
Not Dean Winchester, however.
Dean stops and makes a face. “Yeah, peachy.” He runs his hands through his hair. “Uh, I kind of had a revelation while I was away with Sam. Well, Sam helped. Actually, Sam just told me. But, um, I like you.” Dean ducks his head toward the floor. “Like, like like.” He cringes. “God, I’m acting like an unpresented  thirteen year old with their first crush. I think you’re cool, Cas. And, ya know—“ he coughs, “um, I think I should stop there. Yeah.”
Re: Spring
Bobby stood up and clapped his shoulder. “I think you’re doing the right thing.”
“Dean, listen. You’re just as good as your Mama. Don’t throw her up on a pedestal she didn’t ask for.” Bobby stood up and dragged his coat off the back. “You’re a good kid.
He frowned. “We would be friends?” Unsure, as if there was a catch to Dean’s question.
The bell chimed and Krissy blustered over the threshold. “You would not believe what I just saw. Milton Books,
“Excellent.”
His boat bobbed in the water, a soothing reassurance that everything would be alright, eventually. The view out the windows was cluttered with the other boats docked in the mariana. Honey ran the length of the sitting area, sniffing every nook and cranny. She had been on the boat a long time, back in her puppy years, and was thrilled when he took her there. Say what he will about the opulence of the boat, but he appreciated it at the moment. It was nice to have the comfort a hotel room wouldn’t provide and none of the questioning bunking with Meg or Gabe would cause. He continued to put off returning to his apartment and talking with April. Five, coward.

“Tortellini soup.” He threw out the onion he bled over and began to cut the other half he saved. “Can you check the freezer for chicken broth? I’m pretty sure there should be some left over from that roast chicken we had a couple of weeks ago.”

Cas leans against the wall and watches Dean light up under the attention. The sun and surf have done him good: his skin golden, hair windswept and streaked with highlights, and, if possible, even more freckles trail his face and arms.
It must be the season for endings. Last night I had an epiphany. Maybe not so much an epiphany, but the requests and concerns of my friends and family finally made sense. My actions have been dour when it comes to relationships. At this point, we’ve been chipping away at what we originally wanted off the tables, but I find it harder each message to stand by those rules. And if I want to be honest, you need to know too because you were involved in a way. Last night I broke up with my girlfriend of almost a year. I had never been happy in the relationship as I only entered it to appease my parents. I know, desperate. But I thought I could go through with it for their sake. And at the beginning, it wasn’t hard. The woman was tolerable, sometimes a companion. We worked in the same sphere and had several similar interests, but it was never going to be enough to sustain our relationship. And then we had cybersex on New Year’s and I realized what I was missing, but I was still too scared to break up with her. It came to a head last night and it was quite the fallout.
In the late afternoon, his arms were of full prizes, balloons, and a memorable goldfish. Claire and Jack lagged behind. Something quiet would do nicely, a place to stop for a moment and recuperate.
The trip back to his apartment was lonely, cold, and let too much time for him to contemplate his future. The crux of the problem was that it never really felt like

Charlie squeals from the front and Cas glances over at Garth. He looks just as confused as Cas feels.
Dean leaned back in the couch and made sure Kevin was upright. NYC418 was right, he had a lot of great people to look after him. The next couple months were going to suck, but he had a lot of people looking out for him.
“See, I told you. We’ll have people to support us. Don’t worry so much.” Bobby clapped his shoulder. “We’ll make it through.”

“Still—“ Dean turns and stares at Cas, “I missed you guys.”
He sighed. “ I— I don’t know what to do. I don’t think there’s anyway I can talk to you without setting you off.”

I’m warning you, this is cheesy and cliche, and quite possibly the most hyperbolic message I have ever sent a living person. There’s something about spring that makes new beginnings pop up like crazy. I’m happy to report Honey and I have found more permanent housing and while she’ll probably never forgive me from moving her away from her favorite hot dog stand (I swear they purposefully dropped hot dogs for her), at least the view from the new place is stunning. I’m in the process of finding a new hobby as the lack of significant other in my life has freed up more time than I thought it took up. Maybe I should go into knitting like you did, though we wouldn’t be able to compare projects. Is it out of season to knit in spring?

Your family sounds lovely (I say that as if the idea of you and your brother tussling in any way reflects a peaceful and “lovely” image.) Ours is a buttoned up affair. The youngest will showcase any skills they’ve learned over the year. The adults discuss business. Everything seperated and neat. No mess or fuss. We are more like the images you see in pictures, but we never break the appearance. Always poised as if the picture will be taken any second. Though the youngest have challenged the norm lately. Perhaps I’ll join them at the kids table this year instead of sitting with the adults. Lord knows the conversation will at least be a bit more stimulating.

A Truth Universally Acknowledged
I’m sorry to hear you’re not doing well, but as long as you’re open and honest with your therapist you’ll get the best care. Not that I don’t think you aren’t already. I know I can’t do much over the computer, but do you have a fall back plan set up with someone close with you? Perhaps your roommate? Anything to catch you when you find yourself spiraling — I think that’s what you were looking for.
She rolled her eyes and he laughed. Maybe it was about time he took some risks.
He glared. “At this point, tolerate is what I can expect. I don’t think they’ll approve of anyone else I would choose.”
“If you need any help let me know. I won’t be able to do much out here, but I’ll be coming in for the holidays if you need help then. And you can always call me if you need to unload. I’ve got your back.”
“I don’t know, go to meetings, analyze sales, ask a big author to write something —”
She leaned in and angled her face to whisper in his ear. “Castiel, are you gay?”
She patted his cheek. “I know, hun, but you never know. Anything, anything at all, you let me know.”

Kevin sat the box down on a chair and opened it. “We’ve got decorations.” He pulled out a strand of tinsel garland and wrapped it around his neck like a feather boa. “Thank God. I was done looking in storage. Dean, how did you even get that much junk back there? It’s already pretty small.”

I get it about holidays. I’m a family guy, so I can’t get too cynical. You know those images of the family around the fire and everyone looks happy? That’s my family for the most part. Sure we can fight or whatever, but mostly we’re kidding around. My little brother and I have been rough housing for years. It just looks worse when you’re both over 6’. I’m glad you’re getting some home cooked meals. I don’t think it’s terrible you don’t have them throughout the year — some of us are busy and I’m sure you’re one of them — but there’s something about home cooked meals during the holidays that feels required. My oven and stove top are gonna have a work out in the next two months, but it’s gonna be so good. (And it will not end with a New Year’s resolution to lose weight. NY resolutions never work. Everyone puts in effort for about the first month and then they drop it. And the ads for it are so annoying. Yes, I know it’s a new year, but I’d rather make a new me in March so I can come out of hibernation like bears). I wish I could send some cookies your way. Or brownies. Fudge, mmm. I might need to go make a shopping list.

She’s the children’s agent I keep telling you about.”
He’d already put it off for six weeks: the moment wasn’t right, she had a bad day, he had a bad day, or it was a good day and he didn’t want to ruin it. Every night he went to sleep and hadn’t broken up with her, his conscience danced around his mind, pleaded and bargained him to break up with her.

The holidays were approaching — Claire and Jack would enjoy a day out in the city, the cold nipping at the exposed parts of their faces and they’d warm up at a fancy tea or perhaps a small cafe. He could help them pick out presents or decorate a tree in his apartment.
He stared down at his plate and twirled the alfredo, speared a shrimp. It was nice, but the romantic air dampened his mood. “Where did you learn to cook?”

He settled down on his bed and snuggled his pillow. Him and Sam may no longer be joined at the hip, but just talking to him made him feel closer. “Missed you is all. Got nostalgic and shit in the school supply aisle and thought of you. You were such a nerd when you were little.”

I’m not going to lie to you and say this is easy for me. It’s not like we’re exclusive, or even dating. We’re not dating, if anything we’re two people who met online and, during a moment of alcohol based judgement in the nostalgia of a year, had sex. I don’t even know if it does count as cheating since we physically didn’t do anything with each other. I guess that would be based on our own feelings. I don’t think I can share those feelings with you anymore. It might take awhile to trust you again. I don’t know if I can. I want to, but it might be awhile. I want us to stay friends, though. Don’t count me out yet, but it might be awhile before I e-mail again. I’ve gotta process everything. I’m glad you and Honey are safe.
He settled down in a quiet room and picked through his food. Billie’s house was nice: warm colors, comfy furniture, bookshelves full. He fidgeted in the armchair and popped a pig in a blanket in his mouth. In a hotel ballroom he might have been fine. A nice dining hall or a rented out restaurant, those were easy to slip out unnoticed and wait in the car for Charlie. These intimate parties at the author’s house were not only weird, but hard to leave. Only one entrance and exit and he had to pass so many people to get there, all wondering ‘Where are you going?,’ ‘Why are you leaving so soon?,’ or ‘Where’s Celeste?’.  Charlie was the people person. Him, well, a while ago maybe, but lately not so much. Kids, though, had no expectations and judgements about the way you lived your life. Sure they could be judgey, but there was no air of superiority.
I’m sorry I didn’t meet with you yesterday. There was a family emergency and I couldn’t get to a computer until today. I wish I had gotten to meet you. Reschedule?
“Not funny. Who suggests to meet their online crush after cybersex?”
She shrugged and sat next to him. “It’s okay. I don’t even know if I like piano.”

“Sounds like denial to me.” Meg turned away and drank her coffee.

She brightened. “You’ll love it. We have a huge tree and a roaring fire. So much food you’ll burst. Our gift exchange is pretty hilarious.”
A waitress came by their table to take their drinks orders. Dean fiddled with the napkin dispenser. “One is going to take so much planning. Like, I’ve been planning it for years and never really had any hopes to get it off the ground. The whole thing with the store makes me want to take the chance, but I’m still not sure. The second is just to go find another bookstore and see what they’ll offer. After being the boss for so many years I don’t know how I’m going to do working under someone, but it can’t be that bad can it?”
Dean slumped into the chair across from him. “Sorry I’m late.”

He sighed and pushed his cereal to the side. “Could it be better? Yeah. But the more I talk about, sometimes it just seems redundant. I know you and Charlie want to make sure I’m okay, but I wanna get past it not stew in it.” Sam stared to stay something, but he held up a hand. “And before you apologize, it’s okay. I get it.”
To: ImpalaGuy
NYC418: That’s great.
Dean grabbed the paper from her and glanced over it. An op-ed, so no interview  — thank God — but he liked it. Cassie did ask him a few questions and spent some time observing the store. A skim through the article showed it and it made his stomach knot in nervousness, but also appreciation: the love he put into the store sparked off the page.  “Thanks. But shouldn’t you be at work? Nine to five and all that?”
“Yeah, so like, I get it. It’s never really relevant except to the person you’re fucking, you know? It’s one of the reasons I bothered you until we were friends. I saw you eyeing the frat boys on the lawn.”
ImpalaGuy: i’ve had real sex
Dean relaxed his shoulders, let the tension out. “I think so too.”
“Crap, that’s not what I meant, I swear.”
Dean took two weeks off to drive up and down the coast with Sam before the semester started again.
“No, no, no. You can’t play that game with me. No deadpan humor for you. Say shit like that and I’m likely to troll every strip club in this city to find your cute ass.” She smiled and walked ahead of him. “So, projections. Should we be able to open on schedule in October?”
Re:Re:Re Movies?
Claire laughs. She grabs her laundry basket and heads towards the door. As she hip checks the door she mouths “ask him out.”
He hugged his arms. “You know I can’t do that.”
“Cas?”
He slowed down and glanced over at Meg who paced at a leisurely walk. “Normally the nature calms me, but there is nothing calming about this gym setting.”

“It’s simple. I want to run my store. Unlike you, I can’t solve all my problems by waving money at it.”
Castiel squirmed. If there was one part that made him anxious it was pushing out the local businesses. He had to make money too, but there was something to be said about charm. The other stores also cut into local businesses, but some still remained open. It often had more to do with the owners than the customers. Owners who were involved, younger, and eager to fight often kept a cult like presence in the area. Older owners often sold their businesses and took an early retirement. However, this was the most ambitious store yet. Only the best for New York City. It was also the first one his mother was allowing him to handle solely. She had always had a place wormed into one of his projects or another, but this was the first time she didn’t mention anything. No whisper of her from the board, none from investors, and if Meg hadn’t heard anything his mother had kept her word and stayed firmly out of it. “If Mother is happy then I can rest easy.”

Re:Re: Honey
Wait. Maybe there could be. He pushed Honey off his lap and sped to his laptop. He has to be online. He had to be online. He listened to Meg worry in his ear as he waited for everything to boot up. Instant messaging, ImpalaGuy was online. “Meg I'm sorry to have bothered you, but I figured it out.”
Yeah, he wasn’t going to answer that question.
“You’re right. Now go sit down so you can eat.”
She sat the container to the side of the pot. “Anything else?”
He pet the petals of one of the flowers. “I know we haven’t had great interactions, but I was hoping to put that behind us. I know it might not work, but I thought we could maybe, be friends?”
“Bobby —”
“I do.” He opened the door wider so he could come in. “But I don’t have many options. This was the best solution.”
, he was still him and there was no way he could date ImpalaGuy. Would he even want to?
Dean Winchester. ImpalaGuy was Dean Winchester, his online crush. “Should I go in?”
-o-O-o-
“Yes, I think so. I had gotten a bit blind to my daily interactions. I know I’ve been less than hospitable to you. If there’s anything I could do to make it up, let me know.”
“I know.”
He watched the digital clock’s numbers flit through past nine.
She shrugged her shoulders. “I’m not the one who picked the membership here.”
Dean stared down at his bandaged finger. “She’d want me to do the second one.”
“Bye,” shouted Claire. She took Castiel’s other hand and started to tug him in the opposite direction. “C’mon. There’s a party today.”
Dean opened the register and counted out change. “Milton Books is moving in down the block. It’s gonna suck, but we’ll get people to stay with us. Can’t beat our charm.” He winked. “Well, Claire, you take good care of your nephew out there.”
The last official day was on Friday. Several past customers came in just to say good-bye. People who came in for the discount offered their condolences. Kevin and Krissy handled the purchases while Dean and Bobby packed. Not all of the inventory sold, he expected it, but there was no reason to keep the store open past the end of the month for a couple dozen books. He’d donate them somewhere, he wasn’t quite sure yet.
-o-O-o-
Inevitably, he wandered into the children’s section. A bit more sterile than his store, colorful character murals dotted the walls and the shelves were well stocked. A cluster of tables held coloring stations and books for early readers. Squishy bean bag chairs leaned against each other. A pair of siblings shared a chair and the older one helped the younger flip the pages. He brushed the edges of the books, skimmed the titles.
He paced. All of the reasons it was a terrible idea tumbled over in his mind. He had a reputation to uphold. His parents, the stockholders, the
ImpalaGuy: Aw, you flatterer
“Yeah, just let Krissy know. She should be able to cover for you and if not me and the old man will be here.” Dean shooed him off a final time and rested his hand on a low bookshelf.
Cas had done many stupid things in his life, but going to Dean Winchester’s apartment was high on the list. He should never had done it, it crossed all kinds of boundaries. Yet the irony was that he had passed his apartment so many times. They could have met anytime in the street, yet they hadn’t met until he walked into his store. He should have waited and approached him in a more professional setting. Add it to the mountain of Problematic Things Cas Needed to Work On. One, boundaries. Two, separating work life versus personal life. Three, letting go of his parents influence. Four, give April a proper apology. Needless to say, he had a lot of work ahead of him.
She peeked in and waved at Krissy and Kevin. “Looks like you got a full house. I wasn’t even sure if you’d still be here or not. I called Charlie and she said you’d be here.”
Sam frowned and leaned over the kitchen sink. “Are you gonna go outside? Sun’s good for you and all that.”

She wrapped her arms around his neck and snuggled close. “In five years, this could be us. Kids would be younger, but it’d be like this.” She kissed his neck and stepped away. “It’s a nice feeling.”
“Did something happen on your way home? Or something else?”
ImpalaGuy: You need to chill out more. If you don’t watch TV or movies, what do you do?
“More than likely. Mother refuses to admit it as she doesn’t want to have to go through the humiliation of another divorce. The first one made her look like a corporate trailblazer. The second will make everything she can’t keep a man.”
Subject: Movies?
Why did he even need to open up another store in the first place?
The man ruffled her hair. “That sounds great. Do you want those?”
He’d do better tomorrow.
Subject: Endings
It was not a date. Cas needed to repeat that to himself for as long as it would take to sink in. He still could not fathom why Dean would agree to this meeting, but he wasn’t going to look a gift horse in the mouth. Life was looking up for him: April evaporative from his life with little fanfare, therapy was okay, and Honey had yet to show any resentment for boat life. So, not bad overall.
Garth crushes Dean in a hug. “We missed you too, pal.”
He pushed his shirt cuff up and glanced at his watch. Three thirty. “Yeah, they shouldn’t be finished with the story.” He ushered them inside and bell chimed. He maneuvered the kids and all of their new purchases inside and nudged them towards the large gathering of children. A man sat in front of them, reading in a low voice before rising with suspense. He situated the kids around the outer edges. He listened to the storyteller’s voice: pleasant, smooth, deep.
“I think I am. April was a first step and I’m not even past it yet.”
Sam frowned. “Friend?”

The sales associate grinned, relieved. “How do you spell the last name?”
right now. Good to know. If you two could excuse us, we need to talk. I hear if you go into the kitchen you can pull the wishbone.” The kids ran off and he handed him a glass of wine. “You’re probably gonna want this.”
The bell chimed above the door leaving Dean alone. He sighed and stacked up the notebooks. He could put this off for another day. There was no reason to get it all done as fast as he could if it meant it wouldn’t be a solid plan. He bundled up in his coat and turned the lights off as he made his way to the entrance. He locked the door then pulled the gate down to lock it.
He took the glass from her and stepped back. “April, I’ve talked about it before. I’m not comfortable —”
“Well, what did you wish for?”
“You were this close to full blown elevator look.” She hovered her pointer and thumb over each other. “But you only dated girls in college, so: bi.”
Dean Winchester.
Meg raised an eyebrow. “Are you in love with him?”
ImpalaGuy
The omega presses his chest out, shoulders straight. “Yeah, not the first knot-head I’ve met.” He drops his laundry bag and his pockets jingle as he reaches for change.
Claire glares down at him from her perch. Up above she’s like a judgy crow—long, blonde hair; shaved sides; and thick eyeliner. Her faint magnolia scent clashes with the way she presents herself and Cas can imagine her as a young girl—rejecting femininity, and later, her Omega presentation. “Whatever old man. Got a newspaper anywhere? Kaia and I thought about going to the movies tonight.”
Charlie pulled her hair up in a ponytail and took over the register from Krissy with a tap on her shoulder. Krissy wiggled through the after school patrons towards Dean. She snatched the paper from him and scanned. “This is good. Plus, we’ve got the picketing Saturday, so this is going to be great exposure for us this week.”
Draft: Socks
But most importantly, I do want to continue. I look forward to your e-mails and I wouldn’t want to lose our friendship due to my error. I hope my misstep won’t be too much to forgive.
You could give me a few specifics, like which realm it’s in. Without that I can only give you the vague “go with your gut advice.”
His Christmas confrontation with Gabe and New Year’s affair with Dean should have been his third and fourth clue, but apparently he needed it printed out in large letters: it wasn’t going to work.
“Is that what you’re going to focus on? Look, they’re still building. It’s going to take a couple of months before they open. We have the upper hand.”
“That’s great.” He finished off his beer. He needed to tell Sam before they froze out here. “I know this isn’t ideal after all your great news, but I’m closing the store.”
She dropped her head into her hands, elbows on the table. “You couldn’t possible dream of it. Your the sweetest guy I’ve ever dated.”
“Were you going to meet him?”
“This looks great, Castiel.” His father walked down the stairs back to the main floor, his current wife on his arm. “I couldn’t be more proud.”
Bobby sat the pastry box down and took the ornament Kevin held out to him. “She’s a smooth talker. Might be good to chip-in her offer.”
“But where would we get our snack money from?” Claire flutters her eyes and exaggerates a pout.
“Thanks.”
“I know and I thought I wouldn’t be this bad. If I had my way, you know what’d do.”
“I’m not quite sure what your daughter might want. Do you remember anything else?”
He walked to the end of the bookshelf and saw an exasperated woman with a sales associate.
“You’re insufferable.” Honey whimpered at his feet and he picked a piece of sausage off to feed her. “I’ve had Hannah clear my next Saturday so I can go shopping. And yes, I will get someone to move my furniture for me.”
The dinner fell into silence. Her foot continued to trail along his leg as they ate. The candlelight no longer felt romantic, but instead predatory with her intense stare across their meals. He wished it could be over with, but he hate to rush through the meal and kick her out of his apartment. Her foot brushed past his penis. He froze. She bit her lip and dropped her fork. The clatter made him twitch.
from the display with plush llamas. “Is it this one?” Jack nodded. This guy had a cute family. The kind Dean had to tell himself was not happy, at least not any time soon, or if at all. God, he didn’t even know if he could handle all the spit up. “Would you like to pay now?”
“No, no.” She grimaced.
“Hi, April.” She shuffled past and went into the living room.
ImpalaGuy: one sec

He made his way to the front, suffered through the line, and stepped back into the cold. Right into someone. He jostled backward and flung his arms out to stay balanced. The other person was bent over, a few groceries tossed. “I’m so sorry dude. Need help?”
Dean stared at him, a look on his face Cas couldn’t place, and he wanted to know so bad what was going through his head. “I’ve got to go. I’m supposed to meet up with them soon and I’ve got to get ready. We can set up another afternoon later.” He pulled his jacket off the back of the chair and rushed out of the pie shop.
“I didn’t figure you and Dorth would want to go all traditional.”
“Castiel? What’s that smell?” April slipped into the kitchen, heels in her hands. “Hey there, Claire.”
“You mean you won’t be my maid of honor?”

“But I gotta be back for dinner tomorrow. I can’t miss Christmas dinner. She’s gonna freak.”
“Hello?”

Bobby nodded and walked out of the office. “See you tomorrow.”
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. “It might not be that big of a deal. People love us and what good is New York City if you can’t come for quality, locally owned businesses? We don’t need big companies to come in and shut us down.”
Dean side eyed him. “I’m not that picky about my pie.” He used his fork to point towards Cas’s slice. “Though I’m not sure about yours. Coconut’s pretty sweet.”
Subject: Relationships
“First, we’re going to order pizza.” She sat down next to him and leaned against him. “Second, this sounds like a problem we can fix with
Castiel dug the bottom of his palm into his eyes and rubbed the stiff sleep out. He shouldn’t have worked so late last night, but at least this time he got some sleep.  Then again, he was up before dawn - did it really matter? The wall clock ticked each second as it passed. He pushed his papers to the side and dragged his way to the kitchen. Honey snored on the floor — the thump of her tail kept time. Bleary green 5:34 blinked from the microwave. He started the coffee maker and yawned. It was going to be a two cup morning minimum. He opened the fridge and pushed aside old takeout and condiment bottles. No luck. Maybe he could pick something up on his way into work. The steadying drip-drip of the coffee maker drilled against his thoughts. Everything was on schedule  — maybe a tad over budget but still within the limits of the just-in-case money put aside — but he could be proud of the work he’d put into Milton Books. He grabbed a mug from the counter and poured his first cup of the day. The shower rained from the other side of the wall — a staccatoed pitter-patter shifted as April undoubtedly moved to grab at the toiletries bag she “accidently” left last time she stayed the night.
Sam smiled softly. “I figured.”

April pressed the back of her hand to his forehead. “You feel hot, but that’s probably because you’ve been under the blankets all day. Would you like me to take care of you?”
Dean followed his employees back into his store and switched the sign from ‘CLOSE’ to ‘OPEN’.
“That’s okay, dear. She’s lovely. Do tell me before you propose. I’d like to get a head start on the wedding arrangements.” She patted his cheek. “You look good with the kids. I’m excited for grandkids. God know I’ll never get any from Gabriel.” She dropped her hand. “Come join us in the dining room.”
NYC418: I’m sure i will
“Yeah, I’ll make sure I’m there.”
“Your guess is good as mine. He is only five, Claire. Don’t they have naptime in kindergarten?”
His mother nodded. “That’s what I heard. Susan told me Mary Winchester’s store looks like it’s going to stand its ground. What’s it called again?”
NYC418: thank you
She snorted and poured coffee. “I could have told you that.” She turned towards the kitchen table. “I’m telling ya, I get people asking where you are all the time. Friendship is a two way street, you know.” She leaned against the counter, her face softened. “And we want you all back on the road.”
He had his work colleagues - Meg would never forgive him if he didn’t include her - but he maintained relatively professional relationships with them. Except Meg, but he never had her over to his apartment and they always met in public spaces. One memorable night they ended up at her apartment, too trashed to even remember Castiel’s address, but he never went over again. His online friendship with ImpalaGuy was easier and no doubt one of the closest relationships he had outside of his family. Which was the crux of his problem.
NYC418: That would be insomnia
He swallowed and stared at the floor. “I’d like to break up.”
It wouldn’t be terrible to just stay and read. Not unlike what he did on nights Charlie wanted to bring Dorothy over to the apartment. It was cozy, warm. Gotta make lemonade somehow.
“No.”

He angled his wine glass in her direction. “To be fair, I am — very drunk.”
“Kevin, and it was a fucking accident. Christmas has got of a bit of haze on it. He probably doesn’t remember though.” He paused. ”No, wait, I think I did tell Krissy once. She didn’t think I had it in me to date anyone. Had to prove her wrong somehow.”
“C’mon, it wasn’t that bad. So you’re a bit of a dick. Everyone is over something at some point in your life.”
“They can, depends on the campaign.”
Cut to the reporter’s sign off.
“So what helps you?”
I’m glad to help you with Christmas traditions. Every family has their own thing, so you don’t have to make Christmas cookies. You could always make something else. Me, I’m a pie guy. I always make sure there’s variety for our holiday spreads. I think it’s great you’re getting the kiddos in the kitchen. They should be fine with rolling and cutting if they’re past the toddler stage. If you want the shapes to actually stay the shape you won’t want sugar cookies, but a more stiff cookie. I’ve got both kinds attached if you want to decide. I hope Honey likes the recipe. I’ll admit, I don’t have a dog, so I don’t know if these are any good. I passed the recipe on to my brother for his dog, but I didn’t hear any complaints from either of them, so I’d say they were good.
“The same people who say ‘I love you’ during sex.”
“Ugh, Clarence you would not believe what I had to get through to be here anywhere near on time. I am lucky to be alive.” Meg leaned against his shoulder and took the second coffee from the carrier. “The Lord knew what he was doing blessing me with an angel like you.”
“I will.”
Honey zoomed back through, sniffed the edges of a window, and padded towards him. She shoved her head under his hand and he obliged her as he opened the pizza box.
He brushed her away and straightened his coat. “Okay, okay. I’ll do it. You should probably go home. I don’t know how long this will take and I’d hate for you to wait out in the cold.”
They said goodbye and Dean placed the phone back in the cradle. He popped into the office where Bobby sat, glasses perched at the end of his nose. “How’s it looking, old man?”
He passed the small cafe, all dark roasted coffee and baked goods. His stomach growled. He’d worked through lunch, not ready to leave his store yet. No pie, but slices of sweet bread, muffins, and cookies lined serving trays. Coffee makers lined the back and burbled as they boiled and warmed. But he didn’t come here for food. He still wasn’t sure what he wanted to get from his trip inside.
“Sure, we’ll get in next round.”
His home phone rang.
He groaned and buried his head in his arms. “I don’t know if I can look. It’s already been a disaster tonight.”
He finished off his whiskey. “I wanna believe, but I’m scared to take the risk.”
“No, really. There’s a difference between thinking you’re having a little last hurrah before settling down and being coerced into a marriage you don’t want. I thought you were just unsure about April. You’re okay with her, but you’ve always been an awkward dude. Or that you weren’t a fan of PDA. Why didn’t you tell me?”
I know we said no specifics, but the shitty thing about the holidays is that they reinforce how much society plays up the importance of being in a relationships. Not that there’s anything wrong with people who’ve found the one — good for them. But the other three hundred odd days outside of the holiday season (excluding Valentine’s Day, I’ve got a whole other conversation about that) people are all like “it’s fine, you’re improving yourself.” Or “you don’t need someone to complete you.” But the calendar flips and suddenly it’s a crime that you’re not attached to anyone. Excuse you, I’m a functioning person on my own. I buy my own groceries and pay the bills. My existence isn’t decided by my dating status. It’s just, ugh. Sorry for the word vomit.
“You could go back to your apartment.”
Kevin poked his head into the office and wiggled the phone. “It’s channel three. They want to know if you’ll do an interview during the picket. They’re putting together a story.”
“I sold my furniture with my apartment. I bought it under Mother’s influence and I didn’t feel like keeping it.” He licked a glob of cheese off his hand. “Also, the couch was never comfy.”
NYC418: Well, do you remember to take care of yourself?
ImpalaGuy: Are you always this obtuse at 3 in the morning?
“Meg, can you just talk to me?”
She smiled and took his face in her hands. Her rings were cold against his skin. “Oh, I’m so proud of you. I knew you would be able to accomplish this one day. You’ve learned so much from me. Once this is all settled and down we can talk about your next project. I can’t wait to see what you’ll do next.” She patted her husband’s arm. “Didn’t he do a nice job?”
“I’m working on it. Once I’ve got everything figured out, you’ll be the first to know. Should be able to give you the answer in a week or so. Just enjoy tonight.” He brushed crumbs off his face. “This is my favorite tradition.”
“I don’t think I would have been much better, but.” Her foot slide up the side of his calf, only about half way. “But it is good to know. About the omelet thing. I would hate to put you in an uncomfortable position.”
She hopped up on the counter and angled the glass towards him. “What are you gonna do? You’re at a good place right now to start over, do something new. And we’ve gotten you out of the apartment, so that’s one success. What’s the next step for Dean Winchester?”
He should be out of bed.
Re: Self-Care
Dean scanned the shop floor. Books back on shelves, some scattered on the kid’s sized tables. The reading corner with the colorful rug and comfy pillows. Most importantly behind him, the small picture of his mom watching the daily operations. “I think I’ll fight.”

It’s always been the smell of books for me. New books, old books, ink off of fresh newspapers. That section of Westerns in the back of libraries that always smell of cigarettes. Maybe I’m romanticizing it, but there’s just something about fall that makes it easy to put on the rose colored glasses and feel like there are new beginnings. Probably that school stuff you mentioned. Never caught the school bug like you did. Libraries though, I like them too. And that’s my roommate who just walked through the door. Since you’re feeling so nostalgic, can you recommend any books? I’m in a bit of a book rut and would appreciate a new perspective.
“I — uh. I wished to see how you are. I imagine the last month as been a lot.”
His eyes widened. “No, I — uh.” He licked his lips. “I didn’t think this out very well.”
“Gee, ever thought about getting those mommy issues sorted out? I’ve got a friend whose cousin’s daughter is a psychologist.”
He slipped out of his bedroom and guided Honey along. He clipped her leash on and threw on a coat. He would come back later for his things.
Perhaps you’re unhappy with your current situation: your job, your partner, some friends, or your living situation. Little annoyances can build up over time and create larger problems that come from seemingly nowhere. In my undergrad, I was prone to anxiety attacks, something I’ve mostly overcame as I no longer have the anxiety of being an undergrad, but do controlled breathing. Meditation and yoga are also helpful, or, if all else fails, you could try therapy. I don’t know much about your upbringing or current life, but I often find it helps to talk to someone who doesn’t know you (though I suppose I just described myself now didn’t I?). Or maybe you do need to slow down. Take time off work if you can, go on a small vacation. Treating yourself can do wonders.

I’m glad you feel better. I enjoy doing crossword puzzles in my spare time, or sudoku. I feel like you would enjoy a more hands on hobby than crosswords or sudoku. Since you enjoy baking (which I assume you would be if you’re involved enough to have famous cookies. I envy those who get to eat them, they sound delicious) knitting might be a good hobby for you. I know you dismissed it as a spite activity, but they’re similar. Patterns are like recipes. Plus, at the end of each hobby you produce something you can enjoy, though the knitting project could be long term joy while the baking product would be (delicious) short term pleasure. Just thought you might like my two cents.

He pushed himself up against the headboard. Ever since the disastrous “romantic” evening, April flitted between cold shoulder and too close for comfort. Her efforts to find a comfortable spot in their relationship drove him insane. It didn’t help that when he called her the next day she apologized for the surprise, but not the action. Said she would tell him if she would do something like that again. She didn’t get it and he didn’t know how to say it. He held her at arms width, not knowing what she would do next. “No, I didn’t feel well, so I took the day off.”
“I’m fully capable of picking out my own furniture.”
After meeting Dean and learning he was ImpalaGuy everything tumbled together. April would not fix his problems with his parents. He should have recognized his problems long ago, but he stubbornly ignored them and everyone who pointed them out for years. He ignored himself. Not any longer. If he continued like this he had a strong feeling Meg and Gabe would stage an intervention.
He should’ve never let it get this far. He should’ve run at the first sign of trouble. He should’ve let her go. “April, I don’t think I can do this anymore.”
“Your grandfather?”
“Bobby is a softie, but that doesn’t mean he’s trying to secretly hook me and Dean up. It just means that he’ll call me or Dean up first if he’s got extra hours. He knows we both could use the money.”
The girl beamed. “Uh-huh. I bet Kaia would love these.”
“I think I see him, so definitely a guy. Points for that.”
NYC418: oh
“I can’t remember the name of the book, or the author, but I do know the author is a man. She said it’s about kids who are orphans? But it’s not
“I should have never gone in that chat room.”
She grinned. “I’ll be plenty hot.” She waved and blew away with the snow.
“I’m looking for a book my friend wants me to read. She said it’s about a princess who lives with dragons?” The girl’s voice rose at the end as if she wasn’t sure she remembered right.
ImpalaGuy: and i am decidedly less drunk then I was when we started
April sighed and squeezed back. “You’re right, that we don’t really know each other. Just, don’t give up before you’ve given it your all, okay?”

That’s fair. I don’t even know where my own feelings lie right now. Maybe a break is what we need while we both figure out ourselves. Please take care of yourself. I won’t let myself have such a large ego that I’m the only one you can confide in, but I know it’s been easier for you to confide in me, a somewhat stranger, than friends and family at times. I feel privileged to have met you and got to know you.
The elevator doors pinged open and they lurched inside. He pressed his floor button and leaned against the back wall. April was cradled between his shoulder, arm, and the corner of the elevator. “I can’t wait until we have sex. Normally I don’t wait this long, but I have for you. You should feel special. God, I’ve bought three new vibrators because of you.”
“Mmm, sounds like fun. You wanna join me?”
“Shucks, Clarence, you sure know how to woo a girl.”

“Dude, wasn’t that a couple of weeks ago?”
Dean pinched the bridge of his nose. “Listen, the last month has sucked, but we’re still here. We’re still going strong. Maybe not as well as this time last year, but we’re not in a dangerous spot yet.”
ImpalaGuy: What are you doing up at this hour?
“Good, but you promise me you’ll explain this sometime.”
“That’s great, but lay off a bit, you’re choking me.” Man did she have a death grip. “So when are you getting out of here?”
Draft: Sorry
“I know, but I also know you were pretty cut up about the store closing. Don’t argue with me that it didn’t fuck you up a bit, we’ve long gone past that. It’s okay to have a friend to reach out to. Like NYC418.  I’m glad you’ve got someone else to talk to, besides them.”
ImpalaGuy: Been thinking about it
“No. Well, technically yes. I said so much after that about building a community and creating spaces for engaging in literature. And it’s all gone.” He set off the treadmill and sped walk.
“Hey, it was my idea, of course I would help you. I’ve got friends that could picket the store if you wanted. One of my friends has way to many craft supplies and could make signs for us.”
“There’s nothing in the fridge. Or your pantry.” The door shut and April came back in the room, mug in hand. “When do you ever eat?”
“What do you mean, ‘oh shit’.”
Sam snorted. “More like giving the man the middle finger. Which was her explanation by the way.”
Dean paces as Cas settles himself atop a washer. “Are you okay, Dean?”
He smiled. Anxiety was a bitch, but he could be stronger than it, at least for tonight. Greasy pizza and a comfort movie was what he needed.
I hope to hear from you, but I understand if I don’t.
“I promise I won’t laugh.”
“That’s right. And maybe you should call Sam too.”

. This is just a new development that’s caught you off guard. You’ve were able to keep the store running after your mom died and I know it killed a bit of you too, but you’ve done a lot of great work with it. Don’t let yourself get down because you aren’t living up to your memory of the great Mary Winchester.” She squeezed him tight and he was glad he had her to support him. “Now what are we doing tonight?”
“Hey, so were you Mr. Nose-In-A-Book.”
“Bruschetta, then.”
Jack beamed. “No.”
She kissed his finger. “Right. Now, what are we making?”
He snorted. “Came here to gloat.”
“No.” He dropped the pen and leaned forward. “Your Mama wouldn’t be her sitting on her ass resigned herself to already losing her store. She’d be making plans on how to draw folks in while still providing the service she built her business. She wouldn’t even entertain the idea she would be losing her store.” He dropped his shoulders and leaned back. “I know it’s hurt losing your Mama, but she knew exactly what she was doing leaving this store with you. You’ve got the drive and fire. Don’t let this Milton Books bullshit drag you down. When it gets down to the dregs, then we panic. Until then, it’s business as usual.”
“Wish I could, but I gotta stay put. Supervising and all.”
“She’s not gonna freak. She knows where you are and trusts me. She’ll be glad you stayed here. And if there’s any problem I can explain.”
She laughed and sat the bowl down. She grabbed his hands and kissed him. “No, you had a very successful first week for your new superstore and I just landed a great new author. Luck just seems to be coming our way.”
“No.”

Subject: Last Night
It was his Mom’s — soft curtains and polished hardwood floors, walls packed tight with the latest bestsellers and classics: all different sizes, shapes, and colors. The window displays were themed for the beginning of the school year: apples, pencils, a bespectacled bookworm plush, a small schoolhouse which propped up Clifford and Beverly Cleary. The store lived and breathed Mary Winchester — just the way Dean liked it.
I don’t know why you didn’t show up last night. Maybe an emergency came up. Maybe you were late and we missed each other. Maybe you decided against it. Maybe you were nervous. It doesn’t matter. I get it. It just didn’t happen.
NYC418: i’d take your cock in my hand
Charlie opened a cabinet and pulled out the Band-Aid box. “I’m sure you did, but it can’t help you if you don’t fill it. And maybe you’ll find talk is best.” She peeled the backing off and waited for him to remove the dishcloth to wrap it around his finger. “I know you think you’re killing your mom again if you lose the store —”
ImpalaGuy
She punched his shoulder. “Hey, I live here too. On occasion. Okay, maybe not as much as I thought I did.”
“No, pick one.”
The man blinked. “Oh. I’m not quite sure. Jack was looking for a book with llamas? I’m not sure what that means.”
ImpalaGuy: Oh
Re:Re: Hobbies
“I was waiting to start mine once I knew you liked yours. I would have offered to switch with you.”
“She went back home this year. We’re gonna spend New Year’s together.” Charlie squeezed into the armchair with Sam and stole a pinch of his cake. “It’s gonna be great. We’re getting the whole group together for a D and D sesh.”
“One second.” He turned back to Dean. “Thank you.”
NYC418: Then meet me on Saturday and you’ll find out ;)

“So he’s there.” He edged closer to the window. Torn between looking and not looking.
“A fine job indeed. Wait until it opens. You’ll have the little guys closed in weeks.”
“Yeah, but you won’t be moving furniture with anyone any time soon.” Gabe waggled his eyebrows. “If you want me to set you up, just let me know.”
“Okay.”
His time since the store’s closing was spent moping around the apartment and knitting. Lots of knitting. A progression of dishcloth quality filled the kitchen drawer to bursting. Charlie, Sam, and Bobby had scarves set aside for next year’s Christmas. A five pack of double pointed needles taunted him from the couch arm. He wanted to make socks, that was the thing you were supposed to make, right? But damn, four needles. He checked out pattern books from the library and asked around at the craft store for advice and the consensus was to go into the first pair with the goal of learning the skills and becoming comfortable with the needles. If he wasn’t satisfied with the sock, he could rip it out and start over.
“Don’t you think that’s rushing?”
-o-O-o-
“Well it is now.”
NYC418: kiss  you too
“Cold, dude.”
Dean lets out a puff of anxious breath. “Cool, cool, cool. Oh God, I was so nervous this would end bad.”
ImpalaGuy: mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Re:Re:Re: Advice
“No problem, kid.” He leaned against the countertop. The cookies did look good. He snagged a snickerdoodle and bit off half.
“Then is Jack your uncle?”
She sat her heels and purse on the floor and slid towards him. “I thought you couldn’t cook?”

. They’ll be loud and impersonal and after all of the brouhaha has died down people will come back to where they’ve always been: here, with us, providing quiet refuge from the city and service with personality.”
Dean stares eagle-eyed at the door, frown etched in his lips.
“Of course.” He heard the scrape of a kitchen chair pulled across the floor. “D and D has been great. Aaron’s been dying a lot, so at this point he’s got a stack of character sheets made up already, but this current one, Golem, might be a keeper. Dorothy was so pissed when we didn’t get the joke of her side quest, but to be fair to us it was already pretty late into the night.”
A couple fingers of whiskey and late night questions of mortality found him in the over thirty chat room. He made it clear to NYC418 that he was a dude, but it didn’t bother him. He had also been a bit lonely and had hoped to make a friend. Friend. Nothing wrong with that. Dudes could bare their souls a little bit and not lose their masculinity. Probably healthier. The problem was they had been talking for almost eight months and Dean had a feeling he was a little bit in love with the guy. Dammit though, he wasn’t supposed to catch feelings.
Dean rearranged the flowers in their vase. “Fight what?”
ImpalaGuy: ;)
He straightened up further in his chair and loosened his tie. Other people did it, why couldn’t he? It was just sex, nothing he hadn’t done before. Maybe only a few times and maybe he’d only been sort of okay with it. After dessert, he would ask her kindly to leave. He’d had a long day. He had an early day tomorrow. Anything to get her out and he could curl up on his couch with Honey in his lap.
“Castiel,” she whispered in his ear, breath warm. She slipped her hand inside his suit jacket and she teased the buttons on his shirt. “We’re not that far away from our one-year anniversary. Do you have an surprises in store for me?”
