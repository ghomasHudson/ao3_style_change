He genuinely couldn’t remember what she’d even come over to talk to him about. He just remembered that it wasn’t about the Avengers… He’d made sure of that, before he allowed his mind to wander…
It had taken so much mental energy to keep himself from spiralling into thoughts of Tony, all this week. A permanent, concerted effort to ignore sexual thoughts altogether, in a futile attempt to curb his physical desperation-
Tony kicked his robe under the dumpster and pressed both he and Bucky back as far as he could, as two security guards rushed past them in a flurry of grey - whoever had been stationed at the back of the building, running out to see what was happening out front.
And then the lightest press of Tony’s fingertips, ghosting over Steve’s shoulder blade like a static charge-
“Oh God, God Steve, please,” he babbled, mindlessly, his hand grasping at Steve’s shoulder entirely of its own accord. And then he felt Steve’s tongue flit over the head of his cock, like an electric shock. And then the slow drag of those beautiful lips as Steve took the length of him again, and then the tight heat of his throat. “Oh fuck, so good, please, oh please-”
But then he’d glance down at Steve’s perfect, pretty face… his lips so full and soft when he was sleeping…
But maybe this was something Tony never got the chance to do, in what little of a real life he got to have. Maybe this was something he’d only seen in movies-
And, obviously, Tony knew it wasn’t okay. That he had an awful lot of making up to do for that – a lot of things to change about the way he thought and the way he behaved. But, still, he was greatly relieved by that as a start.
“But why come here?” Tony demanded, snapping Steve out of his moment of enlightenment. “Why go to a different timeline at all, why not stay where you were - and why the hell was I trying to invent time travel in the first place?”
to do with the fact that they both knew they were going to a sex party, and actually, they’d just wanted to go…
In the moment, the scale of it made him feel slightly dizzy. The recognition that he really could do whatever he wanted, for maybe the first time in his life… spiralling into questions about what he wanted, and why... eventually dissolving into a vast, wordless realisation…
“Well, we all know SHIELD are assholes, and that’s why we’re actually here, isn’t it?” He huffed, gesturing pointedly to the data case. And of course Steve simply nodded and settled back into his listening position… Which was starting to grate on Tony slightly less, now that he at least expected that baffling reaction.
go to Tony now, and admit that he still felt confused and frightened and conflicted, and that Tony would listen-
you. And if you didn’t tell me the whole truth, it would only be because you were scared or because of the pressure - and I’d understand that, so I could still like you. I wouldn’t have to ‘deal with that’. So, you know, why not just ask? What was I worried about ruining…”
Somewhere, there were probably all sorts of thoughts that he wasn’t capable of pursuing. The ideas that
And ‘I wanted to read the file first’ didn’t really hold, unless he actually bothered to read the file.
He had already made a physical commitment, in some way tied Steve to it, before he’d thought about all this-
Or, thinking about it… He still didn’t. Which was actually the scariest of all options - knowing that it was almost certainly something supernatural, but still having no clue what it really meant. Where it really came from.
story. But it would have to wait. “So, they’re going to handle the Mallamen’s – they know who they’re turning them over to.”
Tony wasn’t sure whether he wanted to argue with that. On the one hand, it was patronising and presumptuous, and part of Tony would’ve liked say,
. So, uh, you’ve been on missions to Ethiopia and Libya and Sudan, right? You know, places where the sun is
“I know, most people have recipes stuck to their fridge,” Tony muttered self-consciously, putting two pans down onto the counter next to Steve. Steve caught himself, looking away from the flyer so sharply that only drew more attention.
“No need to be impertinent, darling,” he called back, hesitating just a few seconds longer – even though he knew it made no sense. That an extra minute wouldn’t make any difference, that he was going to have to talk about it right now, as much as he didn’t want to. Or tell Rhodey he didn’t want to talk about it, which seemed almost as uncomfortable…
“Yeah, I’ve missed you too,” he sighed. Tony glanced up at him, his expression soft and affectionate, a playful smile tugging at his lips.
“Please, I need you to listen to me, literally everyone in this building is in danger right now.” And then, as the colour was draining from her face, he added. “And I promise, everything is going to be alright, but I need you to do exactly as I say right now, okay?”
And Steve couldn’t tell whether it was just a culture shock - if he’d simply grown used to a society that aggressively marketed youth to young adults and glamorized a person's twenties as a time of self discovery…
And then Tony threw his head back to gasp for air, never breaking his rhythm, and Steve looked up to see him bite his bottom lip in desperation, so openly and unashamedly lost to this sensation - so perfectly beautiful-
“Good,” he whispered. There was a soft pause, as Steve exhaled slowly, and Tony settled against his chest. And then Steve went on, quietly, “as soon as we’re done here, I’ll take you home.”
- I-” was eventually broken off into a sharp cry, as Tony spread him open, and ran the flat of his tongue over his hole.
And he tried not to think about it. He flinched away from it, physically screwing his face up every time a random line came back to him, trying to shout over the top of it with desperate rationalisations –
Steve waited, barely-patient and determinedly obedient, until Tony parted his lips and let Steve slide his fingers into his mouth, his grip on Steve’s arm still strong enough to control the pace of this. Tony let Steve’s fingertips drag over his tongue,

“And if I did say to anyone, ‘I’m not this clueless, socially inept person really… everyone just thinks that because I don’t have a clue what’s going on, and I don’t know how to talk to people…’”
This was the first time – possibly in his entire life – that Tony had so much difficulty concentrating on his work.
, like walking or something - but I remember Tony grumbling for like a week about making the repulsors more responsive, or something, and thinking… It must be so many different commands and…
He’d already considered that the photographer might well be dead. He could see that the guy still wasn’t moving…
He paused when he saw that Steve had left the sketch face down - when he saw that familiar engineer's scrawl, and immediately pictured his father...
And… honestly, I think you’re over thinking this. You spent all this time worrying that your life wouldn’t fit a normal relationship, and how you found someone who does make sense in your life and you worry it isn’t normal… maybe stop borrowing trouble and look at what you’ve actually got?”
“Well, no one’s taking my hints about the hard-core rave invitations, so I’ll take what I can get-” Steve joked, cutting himself short when Tony paused mid step to throw his head back and laugh.

Contrary to his initial expectations, there wasn’t very much in the folder that had been redacted… which made Steve ever more curious about the few details that
Now that he was allowed to, Steve could so clearly remember turning to share a glance with Tony in this same training camp, on this unseasonably warm April day in the already distant past… He remembered the little rivet of excitement, because that connection felt familiar and hopeful and just for the two of them. Steve remembered
Steve woke up on a strange couch, in a room he didn’t recognise, with no clue where he was, or what time it was, or how he got here…
“Tony, I’m sorry…” He breathed, softening his voice. “I just - this isn’t… I really didn’t mean that to sound...” But he didn’t even know what he was trying to say.
,” Steve told him, his voice measured and calm. And then, after leaving a beat for emphasis, he added very pointedly, “it’s for Tony.”
He deliberately turned away from Steve to open the case, and took a few seconds longer than was strictly necessary to open up all the files - just taking a little reprieve from the intensity of it all, before he reset himself.
done everything he could to snap himself out of that mood, or ignore that mood, or reprimand himself for forcing others to endure that mood-
The initial attraction might have been more powerful than anything Tony had ever known, and for all he knew it
“Well, maybe that’s true. Like I say, I don’t know anything about your life. And it’s not my business – we don’t have to talk about anything like that, unless you want to…” And again, a little pause, just to make sure… But Tony shook his head. “But you don’t have to share everything with a person to let them do one thing to help you. You don’t have to let them into everything, and you don’t have to agree to every idea they come up with, and you don’t have to believe that they can really fix anything… But you have to let them try.
And that made everything about the world brighter, and deeper, and… Real, in a way that even his real life wasn’t-
Steve was embarrassed that this was the first time the thought had occurred to him - it seemed so obvious now.
And Tony thought about all the things that had happened between them, all the different things that Tony had thought, all the different ways he’d felt about it… He thought through every outburst either of them had given into, since they arrived at The Facility, he let himself think back over how they came to be here…
And when they did, Steve realised that this room wasn’t quite like the others. This room was full of pillows, and duvets, and blankets, with walls clearly designed to resemble padded headboards rather than being a continuation of the floor. That, essentially, he and Tony had just tumbled into a giant bed.
It was as though the surreality of the entire situation had hit him, all at once… And just burst out of his mouth as an uncontrollable, unending fit of the giggles.
Steve made the hottest little whimpering sound as Tony took his hand away, unconsciously trying to shuffle closer as Tony unfastened his belt.
“But, then, no one had bothered to tell me just how much the value of things had changed. I didn’t know that, in today’s money, Henry Ford would’ve been worth something like, two
Tony could feel everyone’s eyes on them as they walked, and realised that the few other people in the room must all be employees… that had an ominously, out-numbered feeling to it, however pleasantly everyone was smiling…
either, but he jadedly accepted that it was the least-worst option. It was a subject that fit with his listless frustration – and a subject he hadn’t run through for a few hours now. So maybe it would at least be a change of pace…
Tony broke out into a surprised grin. There was something immediately validating about that specific compliment, something that moved him before he’d had a chance to think about why.
And then he felt the dull press of Tony’s thumb rolling over his rim - an abundance of friction and sensation after that soft teasing touch-
to grab at Tony, grind against him, kiss him back – but there was no logic to Tony’s actions, no pattern, no time to react to anything he was doing before-
He’d spent the last few days in a state of constant, queasy anxiety. Listing all the reasons that this was such a bad idea. Trying not to think about it. Trying to come up with a way to get out of it. Asking himself why he’d agreed to it in the first place. And round and round the cycle went, until he felt physically, bodily exhausted with it. Until – he
“Um, okay, sure,” Tony nodded. “Someone should probably get up there, anyway…” And then Tony rolled over him, to reach for his clothes… and really, it was just the feeling of Tony’s skin on his again. A physical jolt, that pushed Steve into blurting out,
But, as it happened, of all the thousands of things that had just shattered his reality, the one to break the silence was,
He actually preferred the idea of being sober, and nervous, and awkward when Steve arrived… it felt more real. It felt more like getting to do it as himself.
“She seems to think you know her from somewhere,” Clint replied, squaring his shoulders defensively. Somehow, Steve couldn’t begrudge him that. Not yet, at least.
Tony swallowed. He unclenched his fists. He fought the threat of trembling, as he finally turned around.
work for Hydra” Steve explained. “Because she worked for SHIELD, so who knows? I mean, I know everyone can’t believe we didn’t know that the strike team were Hydra, because they ‘looked evil’ or whatever, but all jokes aside – we went out for drinks with Rumlow. Do you remember Ali, who had the baby with the breathing problem, and you paid for an operation and his wife made you cookies?
A trembling heat flared up under Tony’s skin, melting what was left of his resistance. He parted his lips, softening into Steve’s embrace, letting Steve kiss him deeper. Sighing, Steve snaked one arm around Tony’s waist, letting his other hand stroke up over the back of his neck, into his hair. A thousand electric shivers ran down along Tony’s spine-
...If he was being honest, he wanted to have an answer when Tony asked why he hadn’t told him before.
So, suffice to say I was a *little* bit optimistic when I said the work situation had calmed down, and once again dates got rearranged, so - once again - I am very sorry for the delay in this update 🙈🙈🙈
“Eyes open baby, come on,” Tony’s voice came from just beside him. Steve blinked, his vision already obscured by purple shadows, sleep closing in around the edges.
Steve’s free hand stroked down over Tony’s hip again, holding him firm as he slowly pulled his fingers out of him - already pulling Tony closer.
It was okay to say that he would love Steve, and trust Steve and share his life with Steve if Steve loved him back, and trusted him in return, and was willing to share as much with him – but not otherwise.
“Well, I mean, I’m doing this because I like you, and I did… that, because I like you,” Steve explained, “So, I guess, in that respect… But I’d like you either way, and I’d want to do either of those things, either way…”
And, if it helps, it was really more an issue with getting access to the chapter than because there was much work to do - so we're (hopefully) still on schedule to meet all the posting dates in future!
have let them all go, if it weren’t for that. And, as much as it sucked, as unfair as it seemed – he couldn’t really hold any of them responsible for just not liking him. Especially by 4am, when he’d realised how unlikeable he really was.
Steve didn’t bother trying to find his jeans. Wherever Tony had thrown them, they weren’t with the rest of his clothes-

And it wasn’t that Steve could think of anything he’d done wrong… yet. It was the worrying realisation that he should’ve thought about that
After a few seconds, Tony seemed to settle somewhere between amazed and wary - so, Steve did the same. And then, a pretty blush colouring his cheeks, Tony managed to meet Steve’s eye again, and muttered quietly,
much when you did those things is… well, lots of reasons that aren’t your fault. Because the world has hurt me, because
“Jesus, we’ve only been here a day – I can’t have earned us a reputation yet, surely?” Didn’t quite come out in Tony’s normal voice… but natural sounding enough, which was miraculous under the circumstances.
This might literally have been the first time it had ever happened – and least, without some awful price attached, or some dreadful trauma happening in the background.
“... Are you real?” Steve asked, as his smile pinched into a frown. But the guy didn’t answer him. He just stared through Steve for a few seconds longer, and then… wandered away…
. He was still desperately trying to convince himself that it couldn’t possibly be a vampire thing - although he was long past denying that he’d thought of it. A lot. Which, of course, meant that even if it
“Yeah, they might have a point about that” Bruce called, from over at the panel. Tony looked up at him, not remotely surprised to see him there, squinting at the computer screen…
“I’ve slept for seventy years sir, I think I’ve had my fill,” he muttered. Begrudgingly, he gestured to the living area,
“…Do you think, on balance, just, the way things turned out… Do you think it would’ve been better if they’d never woken me up?”
And, maybe, if he hadn’t been so concerned with the pill he was going to be given later, he’d have paid more attention to the one he was taking now. But he barely noticed himself swallow it, in a single gulp, without water.
“You can’t keep that close an eye on everyone in this place.” Steve added, “You’ve been watching us.”

He was just standing there, an expectant look on his face, waiting until Steve had reluctantly met his gaze again before he asked, in a perfectly level voice,
That he’d started out with a rule that he wouldn’t think about the future, because he wasn’t sure he could handle the existential crisis that would surely come with it.
A thinly veiled question about the many safeguards they’d overlooked - safeguards that, oh, say, the world's leading expert in renewable energy might’ve suggested,
to make sure Steve was still okay with things, in the soft room. When Steve had stripped him completely, and
And the questions. Just questions, that drifted through his head without context or reaction or any attempt to find an answer,
At first, it meant nothing. And then, just as Tony was growing irritated by this cryptic clue, he heard Steve huff a little smile.

to investigate Steve. He couldn’t deny it. Ever since Tony was little, his first reaction to anything that frightened or frustrated him was to try to understand it better. To work out what a thing was made of, what made it tick - how to beat it.
Tony just looked at Rhodey a moment longer, trying to ignore that vulnerable little feeling in his chest.
Tony’s breath hitched, his eyes flashing with such raw feeling that Steve’s arms twitched against the urge to reach out and-
Tony had spent the last few minutes in a state of highly focused shock. A strangely distant hyper awareness, in which he could see every detail and hear every word – but he couldn’t remember thinking a single thing about any of it. It was like his brain just knew to shut the fuck up, in case he missed anything.
it now. Another very human feeling, another thing he hadn’t felt in twenty years… and still felt so perfectly natural…
Some terrible joke about the crappy flip phone that Steve had left for him, and a reassurance that the phone
been blaming Steve for. And even if it wasn’t ‘one mistake’… it wasn’t the callous, self-interested betrayal that Tony had turned it into, either.
“So, I know that this fight had a huge cost…” Scott began nervously, glancing between Steve and Wanda before he carried on, “but I really think that Tony and Vision - and Nat - would be so proud that we won it.”
Steve had been lying on the couch in the break room for the last two hours, just staring at the ceiling.
Oh, Tony knew he shouldn’t even entertain this idea. He knew he’d be lost forever, if he gave that little voice the slightest chance…
And yet Steve was lying here wondering if he’d made a complete ass of himself last night, and asking himself if Tony liked him, and what could possibly happen between them-
, aren’t you Steve?” Adam spat. “You’re good at that. You pretend to be good – you say all the ‘good’ things and you play act all the ‘good’ actions, and you think that makes you good. You think if you pretend you aren’t scared, or jealous, or bitter, then you aren’t. Well, guess what Steve? You’re just the same scared, angry,
to grab hold of Tony’s hair – but didn’t. He just lay there, like he was writhing against invisible restraints, as Tony began to kiss his way lower, moving agonisingly slowly over the column of his throat. Steve tried to arc up into it, tried to move his body against Tony’s hands, wanting so much to grab Tony with all his strength and throw him on his back and-
thinking of it that way. It just seemed so… demeaning to Steve, or something. So utterly inaccurate and entirely unbalanced. It really wasn’t as though Steve wanted this more than Tony did, or that Steve liked him more than he liked Steve. And, of course, Tony would’ve loved to talk to Steve about all of these decisions. Go through all his recent musings, speak his frustrations out loud, ask for Steve’s advice…
“I just don’t want to lose you,” he admitted, getting right to the heart of it. “And I wish… Honestly, I wish these epiphanies could be cleaner. I wish some of this stuff could just…
And, Jesus Christ, he could hardly bring himself to ask the question, it was going to hurt so much to hope that hard…
The part of him that knew, one day soon, this whole thing would be over… and he’d never see Tony again.
quickly. A hot, nauseating shame that rolled through him along with the aftershocks – making it all one and the same thing.
So, when Tony finally snapped himself out of it, he immediately raced to bury himself in his work – purely to distance himself from that awkward start to the evening. And, thankfully, tonight’s procedure involved another general anaesthetic and a lot of complicated adjustments, so Tony had plenty to focus on. As always, he managed to push
Steve bit it back and forced himself to keep looking in Tony’s general direction. For the time being, he was more grateful than resentful that Tony seemed entirely focused on Bucky.
“...Not really,” Steve blushed. By now they’d followed an increasing throng of people out of the building - but Steve was barely aware of that fact. All of his firm warnings to take note of his surroundings had fallen away, as he concentrated on
He watched all three of them flinch in surprise, their faces melting into blank shock and their mouths falling open in unison. Clint slowly lowered his bow, obviously dazed.
The room fell quiet for a few moments, while they both did their best to make sense of the information in front of him. Steve didn’t
. The ideas just tripped through Steve’s head, one to the next, light and easy and intriguing. Trying to quiet them in the early hours felt more like resisting temptation than calming anxiety. And, just for once, there were nice details and positive interpretations and reasons to hope-
And then Steve leant into him, his hips pressed hard against him, dragging a long, slow friction against Tony’s groin-
To begin with, it seemed truly alien to see his work desk covered with physical papers and books. Tony had been running a paperless office since the late nineties, and this particular brand of clutter made the safe haven of his workshop seem unfamiliar and…

“Speaking of birthday surprises,” he announced, suggestively, as he unzipped one of the compartments on the side of the bag, “I have presents for you…”
because you felt you couldn’t sign The Accords, and not because you felt you had to help Bucky, but there
. And it didn’t even matter that he didn’t know what these feelings were, or what they said about him, or that they were nothing to do with the mission-
Steve felt his balls pull up tight into him, his hips tensing with painful speed as his something inside him simply gave way without warning, his climax crashing over him, breaking into the pleasure of Tony, still coming inside him.
so jarring, now. It felt slightly more natural, when he wasn’t pretending the warm feeling in his stomach wasn’t there – when he didn’t have to force it into a theory that was patently false.
But since he’d woken up in the future, everything was different. Steve had enough trouble working out how to talk to anyone at first, much less talking about
“And I’m sorry you didn’t know I was in love with you,” Tony told him, firmly. And then, when Steve fell quiet, Tony corrected himself, “I
just one of us having to… you know, work things out like this. And, obviously, I don’t mean I’m glad you have any of these issues,” Steve clarified, even though he knew he didn’t have to. “But… I don’t know, if I
Until at last Steve tensed against him, burying himself deep inside Tony and letting out an anguished moan as he came. Tony felt his stomach tighten just hearing that sound, too overstimulated and overwhelmed to process the spike of arousal it sent through him. He whited out for a second, a dead weight against Steve’s still heaving chest.
He was overwhelmed by a hot, buzzing confusion, a sense that he didn’t know any of these words, and there were so many of them, and none of it meant anything-
, than other people, Jesus Christ Tony, you’re…” And Steve only cared that he was crying again because it was getting in the way. Because he didn’t want to have to swallow back these sobs before he could tell Tony “I never even thought about you feeling unloved, or unwanted, or like you were actually worth less than other people, I just… you’re…
He’d spent so many nights trying to picture this perfect, pretty face in exactly this moment; trying to
couldn’t run from it later. It would make it harder to bury, when reality came rushing back to him, as empty and inevitable and awful as it had ever been…
Steve walked away from him, when Tony had just curled up on the floor and cried, genuinely fearful that the pain in his heart would kill him. A moment he’d trained himself to
And, of course, Tony had no idea which one of those things to think about, or what to think about any of them - and he hadn’t wanted to think about any of that, anyway.
It was the abject terror that there might come a moment when he really did have a choice. A moment, like last night, when he knew exactly what they were doing… and that he
…But it didn’t help that Obie had something so much like that, before doing something that was so undeniably, unforgivably
“Well, it’s not really fine,” Tony sighed. “But… I just want you to know that I know it, and that you

“I don’t know what any of this is,” he confessed, turning away again. “I know it’s… something. I know it’s weird. But I don’t know
What Zemo weaponised was Steve’s desperate endeavor to stop Tony from seeing him differently, or putting him in an impossible position - or leaving him.
Tony took a sip of his coffee, enjoying the way it tingled on the surface of his tongue. He pointedly reminded himself that he wasn’t trying to choose between Pepper and Steve-
Tony was so sure of it, so desperate for it, it was like a separate force pulling him closer to Steve. His eyes fell to Steve’s lips, and he caught that brief flash of tongue, that faint ghost of a smile - that tiny pinch of hesitation. Tony watched in slow motion as those beautiful lips shaped his name, barely a whisper,
He flinched away from that thought. He knew, if he started asking himself how she died, he’d come up with all sorts of horrible answers - answers that would no doubt be worse than the reality, but he’d be stuck with them anyway…

Steve stayed standing, still trying to get his breathing under control, still reciting reassurances and reminders in his head…

He hated being something else for Bucky to worry about. He hated not being able to help keep Bucky safe. He
“Like it was written by an alien who usually writes in squares.” Tony sighed, looking away from his screen and back to Steve again. “Also, I’ve just done a basic scan – and none of these inputs are in an alien language. There are no non-recognised keyboards used. So, no one’s password is in Varian. That was probably a Post-it note translating those words
And then, mainly out of habit, he reminded himself that he couldn’t do this, and that he had to restart himself.
He tried to beg again, but could only manage a truly whorish moan, still trying to roll his hips against Tony’s hand-
“Yeah?” Tony enquired brightly, surprised and immediately pleased. “...But I thought you didn’t want anyone to know you were here, yet?”
have warned him - that there were any number of things he could’ve done to avoid that specific outcome for this one personable guy…
...Even if it didn’t actually feel frightening. If it actually felt strangely comfortable and deeply reassuring-
He glanced up at his desk, to the tiny glimpse of yellowed paper that was peaking over the edge. He didn’t know why he should want to pick it up again, seeing as he could already visualise it perfectly… But something about it pushed him to his still shaky feet and powered him through those few floaty steps to the work bench.
“Every year, Bulsara honours the greatest heroes of the galaxies at a grand festival. The celebrations last four full days, and feature the greatest spectacle and sensory experience anywhere in reality. Billions of people compete to get a ticket - and, this year,” he paused for dramatic effect, almost hovering with excitement, “the grand council has selected the Avengers to be our guests of honour.”
These impulses were still being applied to Tony Stark – and that, as it turned out, was very different to them being applied to someone like Obie.
To tell Steve that he needed space to think about things, and then keep calling him with trivial observations…
“Well, in my defence, I don’t pay nearly as much attention to hot hotel employees as I used to,” Tony blushed. And then he remembered, “
be yours… So, you know, you’ll always have a house in Iceland, if that ever comes in handy - but, I’ll be honest, mainly I was thinking that you and the others should have somewhere safe you can use as a base, especially in this part of the world… and this way I’ll save a lot of hours sleep, when you are ‘looking for a safehouse’ in Europe, so…” he trailed off into a shrug.
“Oh,” Tony laughed, nonchalantly. “It’s a remarkably boring story, actually. But the short version is that I was too stoned at the time to think of a good disguise - and then Bucky thought of a bad one,” he shrugged.
“Did it feel heavy, the last time?” Tony questioned, glancing back at him. He saw the flicker of thought behind Bucky’s eyes.
“And if I think about all that and decide I was right, and I am something horrible,” Tony bit out, over a growing sense of frustration. “What if I’m stuck with really
“So, let me just-” Tony waved Steve quiet, running his other hand over his eyes. “Just… To summarize the evening so far. Captain America is not dead - Captain America got frozen for seventy years, woke up and fell in love with me, and then used time travel to come and find me again after I died,” and he raised one finger dramatically,
“...And, to be honest, what happened to my parents… and all that stuff about time travel… That’s still very much ‘What The Actual Fuck’. I don’t really know what I think about any of that, and I’m sure I probably do have lots of questions and things to say or whatever - but it’s not like any of that matters-”
“God, you are glorious like this,” Tony observed, honestly. He rolled his palm again, quicker and harsher this time, and again, and again, just
bitter about those. But, obviously, if there was one person he didn’t want looking into his whereabouts, it was Ross…
He didn’t even say it pointedly. He just said it as another lamentable fact of this situation, something he’d apparently come to terms with. And Steve felt that first tear run down his cheek, more desperation than sadness. He couldn’t
It was more impulse than intention - just an abundance of energy and an urge to be close to him and the instinct to share this incredible burst of joy.
survive by drinking blood, absolutely would have turned Steve’s stomach yesterday. But now he could easily reframe that as the study of another lifeform, something only distantly connected to himself.
And Steve didn’t know whether any of that would find its way into his cycle of recurring nightmares, or if there was still more to hit him, or whether it would be as easy to get over next time…
And her smile froze on her face for a second, and then flickered, and then she frowned. Tony could see her trying to make sense of all the contradictions – the competent way he was speaking versus the way he was swaying on his feet… the pleasant tone he was using to say such ominous words…
This time the structural integrity of the room held up, the reinforced steel groaning back into its natural state as the wild swinging of the punching bag began to slow.
He pulled back with a gasp, sliding his fingers free of Tony and grabbing him by the waist. Tony’s shout of protest was swallowed by a surprised yelp, as Steve lifted him effortlessly, pulling him into his lap again.
safe. He’d started thinking that maybe he just didn’t do enough about it, that his interest in the Avengers should really be more than the hobby he’d made it into – that he should stop congratulating himself for the tech he’d already ‘gifted’ them, and think a bit harder about what more he could do…

“All I’m really saying is that the world would be better if it was forced to drop that poisonous glorification of the past. And I didn’t hear any of those ideas from voices in my head. I didn’t hear them from the fairies. It’s perfectly logical that I should think that. Backed up with evidence of man’s behaviour and analysis of the facts. And, based on that, I’ve concluded that the world would be better if people were forced to change. You might not agree with it, until you drink the reasonable water. But how can
guessed, thinking about it. If I hadn’t been looking for it. But if I talked to your mom for two minutes, I absolutely know I would’ve thought of you. I’d have known she was your mom.”
He took once last glance at the computer – at that post-it in particular… and then he left, gently closing the door behind him.
He’d long since stopped caring what Nick Fury or SHIELD or the US Government thought of him - he couldn’t pretend otherwise. He wouldn’t have let anyone on earth tell him to keep a secret from Tony…
“It’s called beer fear” Tony smiled “You didn’t get that, when you were drinking before the serum?” And Tony saw a little memory flicker behind Steve’s eyes, and the ghost of a smile.
There was some distant recollection of his usual responses, even if he hadn’t quite slipped into them yet…
, something that had continued to make sense even as the lineup changed and the headquarters were moved and the chain of command was literally blown up and torn down… Still, he was sure he’d just known what it meant to be an Avenger. What they stood for. What linked them to each other.
It took him a second for his eyes to adjust, and the first thing he scanned for was anyone that might’ve seen them…
...Perhaps this would all feel more complicated and compromised, later - but right now it just felt like a moment of enlightenment.
That there was a time when Tony had understood that impulse completely, when it had made more sense than anything. A moment in which Tony knew absolutely everything about it, and didn’t even think it was odd that he knew it – a moment in which Tony was the preeminent expert, entirely confident in himself.
Steve felt very exposed all of a sudden. A hot blush ran up his neck, making it harder to swallow. And then he glanced back at Bucky, who threw his arms out and sighed,
“You are both currently under the influence of a perfectly harmless and entirely temporary drug, designed to keep you somewhat sedated-”
“…Well, I always just assumed I’d offended you…” He said, as though to himself. And then his lips curled into a smile again as he thought back through all his memories, and realised… “But, yeah, actually, we’re both just
...And Tony hated himself for thinking of that as something he shouldn’t get his hopes up over – or as something he would hope for, at all.
.” Steve corrected, suddenly aghast. “No, God, Tony – if I’d seen that tape before, of course I would’ve…” He could hardly finish, he was so shocked by that thought.
the answers were yes. Tony just wanted Steve. Anything. Everything. This was the first time he’d even allowed himself to want, in twenty years, and it was like a dam had burst. Suddenly, Tony wanted so much it was dizzying. He felt every moment of loneliness, every frustrated desire, every buried trauma for the last two decades – how
But there was no personal interest in meeting a former version of Quill or Nebula, neither of whom Steve knew very well, and there was no greater excitement about seeing this version of Rhodey than the one he expected to be around for the rest of his life.
Steve was sure a lot of effort had gone into researching and replicating the features of a 1940s home. At least, his apartment looked very different to everywhere else he went in the 21st Century, and was mercifully free of the ‘wireless’ and ‘interactive’ appliances that the world seemed to take for granted these days - so he knew that really he should just be grateful for the consideration…
“We’re not leaving them in there,” Sam asserted, almost angrily, shifting between glancing anxiously at the building and looking defiantly at Tony.
Erring on the side of caution, Steve had promised himself that he would steer well clear of anything his team had done on their mission to collect the stones - just so that he wouldn’t have to worry about the nature of a paradox that he didn’t fully understand.
While Tony dealt with the mostly technical challenges of getting Bucky safely into Cryo-freeze, Steve had marched on with the mission - which meant that
And of course, there was a part of Steve that wanted to call out to him. A wistful little instinct that clawed at his heart and tightened around his ribs, like he was holding himself back from something…
If Steve had ever wanted to scream about the injustice of it all, or cry at the unfairness of life, or spend a whole night wondering if he was the worst human being who’d ever lived… he’d have been given the same answer as any other kid on his street.
Tony considered Wesley for a moment longer, running through a final checklist before he gave a little nod of concession.
And yet, for all that - and far scarier than all of that - there was the horrible feeling that he already knew exactly what this meant…

be strong for someone, and still need them to be strong for him, sometimes. Maybe Steve could dedicate himself to helping people, and still be able to take something for himself.
When Steve finally woke up the following afternoon, he actually felt worse – at least for the first hour.
Their brisk walk away from the festival took them through a calmer, less densely packed crowd than they’d seen in the city centre, past hand-built kiosks and grinning street performers - not
And then some balance in him tipped, as his tears got fed up of waiting politely behind his words, and his whole being just broke down into sobbing. All attempts to carry on with it had to be abandoned in favour of gasping for air, his body no longer able to hold it together in the face of all of this. And his throat hurt with the force of crying so hard, and his muscles felt weak, and his arms were trembling hard enough to shake the chains around them – and he
A tiny little yelp caught his attention again. Slightly shaky now, Steve managed to push himself up into a sitting position, just in time to see Bucky pulling Tony out of the ball pit.
He still wasn’t sure how to act, or what to say, or how to handle all the things he hadn’t thought about.
Steve felt his jaw tighten in indignation, that Scott should presume to know what Tony - or Nat - would think, that he felt he had any right to decide which sacrifices were worth it-
Steve didn’t feel the need to check that maths for himself. He just followed Tony across the dancefloor, trying not to think about the shape of his back – trying not to look any

to glance at his watch... “And, hopefully, that means no one will think to pay too much attention to this lobby, and no one will see where we went after you pass out, and if they check back they’ll just see you chatting to a drunk guy who then wandered off – and, all in all, that should mean they don’t make the connection, and no one raises an alarm, and they won’t come looking for us. For a little while at least.”
“Why, what would you rather do?” Tony sighed. He knew from too much experience that it was always better to engage a drunk than try to argue with him.
… but he knew now that this was a perfectly normal impulse that he only needed to distract himself from.
Somewhat reluctantly, Tony sat up so that he could unfasten Steve’s belt, and tug his clothes down over his hips. Steve arched his back to help him, doing everything he could to kick his legs free, parting his thighs just as soon as he was able-
to let me say this first” Tony raced to tell him, his voice heavy and breathless “This is mission… drug, thing, that I have to explain before it happens, okay?”
Not sure himself which one of them he was talking to… and neither of them could answer him, for another moment.

“I think it’s more like, when you’re a bit drunk – if you can even remember being drunk – and sometimes you just come out with things… Not necessarily
Steve was caught off guard by the pleasantly uncomfortable heat that curled under his skin. A sheepish little smile began tugging at the corners of his lips, as a whole
That’s probably what he would’ve thought, if he’d happened to live a different life and never learned anything about aliens or gods or the limitless possibilities of the universe… If he’d been some anonymous businessman with an undistinguished career and no interesting stories, it never would’ve occurred to him that this was something ‘weird’. He never would have asked himself if there was something deep and meaningful about his strange impulses this morning…
For a few minutes he could only bask in it. The freedom of being this relaxed and open, the overwhelming relief, the hot shivers that fizzed through his fluid muscles. The echo of that low, pulsing pleasure, still throbbing in his hips.
“Since Pepper and I broke up, there’s no reason for anyone to check up on me, or what I do with my personal time… So, I don’t know, it does give us the option of keeping Bucky at my house, or in

...And how the fuck do you think about something like this, without analogies? How do you even start, without some sort of context?
And why? What crime had Steve ever committed to warrant that level of intrusion? How had Fury justified it, to himself or his superiors or… God, Steve hadn’t liked to think who else might have known…
this is the end of SHIELD. But it’s not up to me, is it?” And he paused to narrow his eyes in that same silent challenge, before he was compelled to carry on, “and I now have the
that aching longing, watching Tony walk, or the frustration of only being able to steal glances, or the sadness of what he could never have-
“So, how’re you feeling?” She asked, sinking into the couch opposite them. They shared an awkward look before Tony went to answer,
“Who the hell are you?” He demanded, aiming his bow at Tony’s head. Nat appeared beside him, her features set in cold determination, and then finally Sam – who looked far more emotional about the situation.
“Wouldn’t that technically make you the arcade game?” Tony observed, his voice still hoarse and breathy.
By the time he’d drifted into sleep, he was somewhere between wishing they’d never come to this place and wishing he’d never been born. His deepest regrets and most painful memories melted into his dreams, until he was trapped in a world built of his own anxiety. The images of Germany and Siberia, The Tower and The Compound, all blended together. The angry words they’d shouted at each other echoing in the background, out of context, or over the wrong scenes.
As he was explaining, Steve was gently pushing Zan forward, towards the portal. She seemed like she was neither fighting him nor going along with him, by now.
comforting about the realisation that he had thrown a tantrum, in front of the guy he liked, because he was jealous of a co-worker.
to take that pain away. It was an instinctive thing, a primal thing. More real and more important than anything else he might have to think about at the moment.
But, as it was, Tony was able to evaluate the situation. He knew that trying to talk Pepper into this, or even stealing her car, wasn’t the most efficient plan.
Too late, Steve realised that he’d spent the last few weeks coming to terms with all the things he might be, and all the questions he still couldn’t answer. That he’d given
“So, in no particular order… Hydra apparently tortured Bucky Barnes into killing my parents. First point, I should probably work out how I feel about that, at some point. Might be a note for the therapist, that one… but, anyway, we’ll put it down. More pressingly, Hydra still have Bucky Barnes, and are still killing people, and are still running the world - That will probably end up pretty high on the list. Also, there are apparently several imminent alien invasions. Also, Steve Rogers isn’t dead, and I think I’m possibly harbouring him from SHIELD - who are Hydra - and he’s a time traveller, and also he’s in love with me. So, I don’t know, maybe we just have a section for ‘Steve Rogers Head Fucks’ and ‘Time Travel Head Fucks’ and I’ll deal with those as and when they occur to me…”
As Steve was talking, Tony could feel his stomach turning to slime. That physical discomfort grew with every word, closing all around him, like it was crushing him.
“I doubt he’s ever even wondered if I like him, and if I told him I liked him, I don’t think he’d care - and I really don’t think he was thinking ‘Oh my God, my parents were murdered by Hydra and no one told me
He didn’t even know what he was bracing for - but he wasn’t prepared to see such kindness in Tony’s expression.
told everyone his weekend plans, when his weekend plans were in fact a man hunt in Eastern Europe. With Sam. Or Nat.
Tony groaned against Steve’s lips, opening his mouth wider, one hand grabbing the back of Steve’s neck-
And with that he scurried off, all but sprinting over to the staircase at the back of the room before he disappeared to a lower floor.
“Or someone who cheats on arcade games - which I totally never have, by the way,” Bucky lied. Tony just grinned in response.
“I remember that,” Sam said, decisively. “I was with Rhodey, and we ran over to the commotion - and Tony was yelling something about going to get Natasha… And then Rhodey went to find her and never came back.”
up to something, stands to reason they’d be suspicious of us investigating anything other than our own… vacation.”
He recognised a very particular pang of affection, something that came directly from his personal desperation to keep Bucky safe. A feeling that naturally followed whenever you looked at someone, whoever they were, and put your whole heart into praying,
His lungs froze as their eyes met, Tony’s brow melting into an expression that he could read so clearly, even in this state-
“Do you feel all, um… Dizzy?” He managed eventually. Steve’s frown deepened, his gaze drawn from the horizon to the inside of his own head as he thought about it.
Just having someone to come home to was something to look forward to - something he’d taken for granted that he’d never have again.
And… It was like he could see everything more clearly. In finer detail, in higher colour. In slow motion.
… Why I felt it so soon after I met you,” Steve stumbled on, not sure if he was struggling to force these words out or to hold them in. “I
to do, no way you can possibly spoil this, or let me down. You know that, don’t you?” And he fixed Steve with a sincere look, his features briefly hardening into a more serious expression.
“I’ll keep it in mind,” he said, in what he hoped was a final tone of voice. Pierce huffed out a relieved little breath, and nodded.
Most of the furniture had been taken away, leaving an abundance of space in the middle of the room that was entirely covered by blankets. Layers and layers of them, in every possible colour and texture, covering every inch of the floor. The couch had been pushed back against the far wall and draped with white cotton sheets. Standing next to it was a little wooden cabinet, the top of which was littered with items that Steve couldn’t make out from here – but he could guess.
“Here, you might as well finish this” Tony told him – loud enough for Maribelle to hear it – as he handed Steve his glass. “I’m going to get us something different.”
here should have waited until tomorrow, but I’ve been going over this and over this for the last two days, and if I don’t say something soon I think my head might explode,” Tony carried on, “So, really, this is probably just me being selfish. But-”
paying attention to Steve… sitting there with his shirt hanging open and his hair all ruffled and that adorable little pout making his lips look even fuller-
“Yeah, I’ll be up in a minute.” Tony nodded, brusquely, already heading over to the little kitchenette area in the corner of the workshop.
, letting Tony pin his arms above his head. His arms tensing against Tony’s grip, and then relenting to it…
Sharing random observations about Tony that he’d come up with, since they’d last had this conversation…
Which would have been a life-changing moment of enlightenment, at any other time… But now… Tony kind of felt like he knew that already.
Feeling like this was the first time he’d ever looked at Steve – and still feeling like he knew him so well.
now, and… mushy… He kept forgetting what he was literally in the middle of thinking about, or finding himself lost in an idea that suddenly seemed entirely irrelevant… to… whatever it was he was… whatever was meant to be relevant…
“Jesus- Jesus Christ, Steve,” Tony panted, eventually. “How… That was… I mean, that’s not even a thing…”

, really – I think the project you’re working on with Rogers and Barnes is the most important thing on the Avengers agenda, at present.”
So, he shook the thought away, and glanced up to ask Sam and Bucky if they actually wanted to do this thing-
It was only when he heard her mention Ambience that Steve realised he’d missed a whole chunk of her induction speech, while he was trying not to think of Tony tied to a bed…
he was hurt, that he’d been emotional and irrational. It was the same embarrassment he’d felt as a kid, when he was reprimanded for throwing tantrums and ruining some big event.
There was the question of whether Steve could be forgiven. Whether, objectively speaking, his mistakes were too large, or his motivations too unsympathetic, or his remorse too insignificant or insincere. Whether Steve deserved any professional consideration, whether Tony could understand his mistakes, whether Tony could move past it, for himself.
Steve moaned something like Tony’s name as his second orgasm broke, writhing against Tony’s cock as the aftershocks shuddered through him. His legs were still twitching when he heard Tony let go of an animalistic roar, grabbing Steve’s hips with both hands as he buried himself inside him-
And then again, and again, until it was like a jubilant crowd in his head, jumping and cheering at waving banners –
Instead, he answered with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes and sank to perch on the bench next to Bucky, nodding an acknowledgement to the rest of the group as Sam took a seat opposite him.
Tony leant into it, parting his lips, letting his hand run roughly though Steve’s hair. A rush of pure, perfect joy overwhelmed him, as it finally hit him-
A hundred scenarios had flashed up in his mind when he recognised the sombre tone that Steve was using - that Steve might be about to break up with him, that Steve was going to say he was leaving, that Steve was going to say he was dying…
in a state all week. But Tony was pretty sure it was a standard state of anxiety, probably common in dysfunctional people… who had fallen hopelessly in love. Even though his moods had been pretty intense, and his thoughts permanently distracted - and even though he had never felt this way before - Tony had still been reasonably confident that it was all ‘normal’. That anyone would easily identify these butterflies and stress headaches and moments of unbearable longing as symptoms of a perfectly human crisis…
Even in the midst of a personal breakdown, Tony found himself trying to work that out. Thinking back to the treatment yesterday with far more clarity than he’d thought about anything, all night. Maybe it was just the focusing effect of his responsibility for Bucky’s health, but – amazingly – Tony was actually able to concentrate. And then he remembered
The physical desperation for it spiked in exactly the way Tony had been expecting, his mouth watering and his stomach clenching as his body swallowed greedily, outside of his control-
And then he woke up in this alien future, feeling like he didn’t understand anything… like he was an interloper to this world, like he didn’t have the basic understanding of current morality to challenge it… Like he was always missing some important bit of backstory, or mistranslating a crucial phrase, or half a step behind the conversation. Just always
By then, Tony had been in the workshop for nearly twelve hours, and had gone through fourteen box files, three folders full of project notes, nearly two hundred pages of meeting agendas and countless scraps of handwritten doodles. He had also, in that time, run through every possible human emotion at least twice, revisited every interaction he and Steve had ever had, and reconsidered basically everything he was ever sure of.
By the time the peak came into view, Steve was ready to feel at least a mild tug of happiness that this much-dreaded task would soon be over with. He might even have felt tiny lift of relief, that this whole thing hadn’t been as crushing as he feared, that he wasn’t nearly as thrown by it as he was expecting-
Like the rest of the palace, it had been decorated in a burst of uncoordinated post-mission enthusiasm. Delicate webs of silver lights had been hung from every eave, encasing the patio area in a shimmering curtain, like the willows that framed fairy-tale images of enchanted lagoons. In one of her many whimsical impulses - which had also included covering the front lawn in glitter, and filling all of the flower pots with glow sticks - Shuri had drained the swimming pool and filled it with brightly coloured plastic balls. With a single element altered, or on another night, it might have looked contrived, or messy, but somehow everything had come together to create an intimate, magical atmosphere in the garden… Something authentic, and fun, and unique to this one moment in time.
And, okay, at some point Steve would have to deal with the fact that all of those things were on the same list of things that made him feel better. He wasn’t sure what that would say about him, when he got around to processing it…
, send Steve away now – of course, all these effects would be very different. That rush of affection might become a feeling of loneliness, or get misdirected into other reckless acts. That burst of strength would just sit in him, growing frustrated and angry. That mental focus would be wasted on analysing a situation he shouldn’t be in.
“... To begin with, because I wasn’t allowed to,” Steve confessed, miserably. “I was never allowed to. It was
“Welcome home, Sir,” JARVIS greeted him - with a subtle edge of warning on his voice, that only Tony could possibly have picked up on.
a functioning legal document… If I’d listened to some of your objections, and thought about how to deal with them and not just how to counter them… I just… Honestly, if we were to have that discussion again, I don’t know if I’d be trying to say something much different – but I’d sure as hell say it in a different way. And I’d
“Comes and goes,” Bucky shrugged. “Has been all day. S’not really gotten any better, or worse, or anything.”
“…That’ll take about twenty minutes or so…” Stape continued, shuffling over to the other trolley, gesturing to the monitor sitting on top of it. Steve didn’t even look at it.
...And, anyway, he didn’t know that this wasn’t a random project name, or an official term like all the others.
And their eyes met again, and the intention and connection and barely contained passion of that look was a high all of its own.
And he’d been worn down by his fathers constant nasty comparisons, and he’d been let down by so many of the people he’d once looked up to…
He had no idea what he was going to say, or what was going to happen – he couldn’t even remember what it was he was so afraid of… or, maybe he hadn’t worked that out yet…
have thought, if he hadn’t fallen in love with Tony Stark. What he might’ve been thinking about, if he hadn’t been thinking about… things he could never tell Tony when he asked, anyway. Steve could never even talk to Tony as a friend, because he could never work out how to act as though that was all he wanted. It meant every conversation was never quite natural, that there was so much of himself he had to hide even as he was trying to be open. It meant there were so many things he couldn’t quite explain…
have been happier, too many complications and sacrifices that could have been avoided, too many scars that would otherwise never heal.
Part way down the stairs by now, Tony still heard Rhodey respond – as though it was the only reasonable interpretation of her objection,
“Oh, you can call me Belle” She smiled, glancing between them “And you’ve just arrived, is that right?”
about the drugs” Maribelle explained, dropping to sit crossed legged on the floor in front of them, so that both Steve and Tony had to look down at her. “It’s fine, I spend so much time with everyone looking
“So, there was a night that we spent in a basement, under a warehouse in Chicago, in like 2012, I think? That was about the most wonderful night of my life.” Tony said, taking his hand back subtly –
Tony frowned thoughtfully. For the first time, it occurred to him that there were distinct parts to this…
“Ah yes, one of my top ten moments…” he mocked - trailing off when he recognised the thoughtful expression on Steve’s face. “What made you think of that?” He prompted.
to hurt, and I’m sure you would take a bullet for me. I’m just… some guy.” Tony breathed those last two words like they were the saddest thing he could’ve resigned himself to being.
Steve stretched, surprised by how satisfying it was as it ran down his back. In his first conscious thought of the morning, he recognised how much better his body felt for a good night’s sleep… and, probably, for everything
balancing out the morality of this, for no other reason than he wanted to – Oh, God, he couldn’t tell Tony that.
He silenced the music with a wave of his hand and shut down the grinder, a static panic already building under his skin. All of a sudden, he could tell that Steve was feeling
have the feel of a school hall. In a very fancy, long standing prep school, or a school from a British period drama… somewhere with gravitas. There were only a few other people there, engaged in bored chit chat a little way into the room, their occasional footsteps echoing ominously.
“It’s called the Shadow Party, it’s the first room you come to, at the top of the main staircase.” Zan answered efficiently. “You need to be there from nine tonight. I can’t promise when I can get to you – but I will find you before Franciszek arrives.” She was already lifting the bar as she spoke, walking to the other side of it. Barely glancing up at them before she added.
“Well, that’s something I suppose,” he joked weakly, reaching behind him to dump it on the desk with the others. And then, because it seemed rude to kick her out without
He braced for Tony to glare at him, or demand an explanation… But Tony just considered him for a second, with that same thoughtful affect.
, which Steve had felt to varying degrees, since they arrived at The Facility – some of which he was only just beginning to recognise. An irritability that simmered or flared, a light-headedness that waxed and waned, a sudden passion that would spike seemingly from nowhere. Those strange moments of mental calm, or mental absence, or whatever it was that lead him to just blurt out whatever he was thinking. That night he had just felt typically, familiarly
was the part of him that still resisted begging Tony to come back to bed – the part of him that instinctively put himself in Tony’s position, and saw how this might complicate a problem that Steve only wanted to help solve.
And then a petite woman shuffled shyly up to Steve’s shoulder. He might not have noticed her at all, if it weren’t for the fact that her bright purple hair caught the sun so dramatically. But when he looked down, he recognised the expression of someone courteously waiting for a pause in the conversation.
Steve maintained the tense smile, while he tried to convince himself that he wasn’t put out by this. He reminded himself that Peirce didn't know how much Steve wanted to be somewhere else. He told himself that being annoyed by this demand on his time was disproportionate and unreasonable.
The sexual side of his relationship with Bucky was entirely functional. Something that had developed naturally, when they both found themselves stranded on the front with the same serum-enhanced sex-drive. Because they both shared a basic need, and because they knew each other and trusted each other and loved each other in a way that nothing could complicate. But they weren’t lovers. They’d always understood that, in the same wordless way they understood everything about each other. This wasn’t a relationship based on a romantic spark or a genuine excitement. There wasn’t the thrill of attraction or the fun of flirtation or the genuine intimacy you could share with someone you were
Idly wondering how he was going to explain the marks all over him – wondering if Steve would laugh, if he asked that question…
And then Tony went back to moving his way down Steve’s body, this time pressing hot, deep kisses along his jaw, and neck, and chest… Grinning against Steve’s skin,

Steve let himself grind mindlessly against the bed, responding directly to animal instinct by now. He’d forgotten there was such a thing as shame, that there were any social constructs about this sort of thing. He just knew that it felt good to move like this, that he wanted it…
he could convince enough people that the Accords needed to be reimagined from the ground up, and get enough of them to commit to a new negotiation, then it was just a few more steps to a pardon for the Rogue Avengers, and a fresh chance at the team-
Except that, occasionally, and with no warning what-so-ever, Tony would remember some little detail about the night before.
...Nick Fury thought that Steve would be here for three days, and that Hydra would fall at the end of it… Even though, strictly speaking, Steve had never said that…
“I’m going!” Tony exclaimed, with comically exaggerated indignation, showing Steve the palms of his hands as he backed away.
And he tried to listen to Dev explain the background to some of these drugs, the brief history of their discovery, their use by the locals… Tony was sure all of that was on his list, when he’d decided to come to this meeting in the first place.
In all the time he’d been nursing this fantasy, throughout all the guises it had taken, Tony had never really considered that it would mean him
“Okay, so, you know when a man has a heart attack, he sometimes gets a pain in his left arm?” Tony began, waiting for Bucky to nod before he carried on, “Well, the reason that happens isn’t that there’s anything wrong with the guy’s arm, obviously. Actually, it’s because the pain receptors in your heart and the pain receptors in your arm send signals to the same part of the brain  – so, when they get there, your brain has no idea which part sent it, and therefore which part to make ‘hurt’. It’s called referred pain… But the point is, there isn’t anything ‘wrong’ with your brain then, either. It’s just that it’s the brain that is making it happen…”
to let you get an idea or an irrational feeling out there, without pouncing on it… And I’m sorry I didn’t, by the way. I know I’m one of the people who did that, who probably made you feel this way in the first place. But… You know Captain America, from the comic books?”
a lot of complicated issues to be dealt with. A few awkward conversations to have, a couple of important topics still to discuss. This was the first step on a new journey, a relationship that would no doubt have its ups and downs and its own unique challenges… All of that was objectively, undeniably true.

Nick Fury and Alexander Pierce and anyone else who’d known about this ridiculous, 1940s policy and decided to let Steve run with it - even after all the additional trauma he’d gone though.
“Bagged blood,” Tony replied, sounding oddly distant – like he was thinking about something else. “I mean, until I know… I can’t bite you. So. It’ll just have to be-”
“Pepper, you’re killing me. Remember the moment?” Tony smiled...and carried on smiling, as he realised that actually he’d
Tony’s skin crawling away from him, like it was begging the rest of him to back down – and, of course, it wouldn’t. Tony stood definitely still, while a protective instinct flared up in Steve, so hot and so immediate that he really
sparkling social life… But at least he could say he had one, now. He had date nights with his boyfriend, he had people over for drinks occasionally – he even had a more social relationship with Rhodey and Pepper, now that he had something to talk about besides ‘how’s the company going?’ and ‘yes, I promise I’ll eat better’…
“That’s it, leave me here,” Tony moaned helplessly, barely comprehensible. “Lie about how I died. Don’t tell the press I drowned in balls-”
And he saw that little flicker of distress in Steve’s eyes. The way he straightened up, and curled himself in just a little – the way his face
“I’ve missed you too,” Steve replied, reaching out to take Tony’s hand. His stomach dipped again when he felt the
And then, right in the middle of a conflict over whether to try to answer that question or avoid that question or just carry on hating life for forcing that question on him, Steve
“Well, think maybe just worse than that,” Tony suggested, “Like the Australian outback at noon on the hottest day of the year, or the middle of the Sahara desert – places you don’t get sent on missions, because they’re just too damn hot.”
All of this had flashed through Tony’s mind before the guy had even finished asking the question – and immediately, he’d snatched the rifles from the two guards in front, hard enough to squeeze the barrels closed.
Steve hadn’t heard a single word Dev said to either of them. He wouldn’t have been able to tell you the guys name.
“I’m so sorry” Tony blurted, as he watched the dread rise up in Steve’s eyes too. He felt Steve loosen his grip.
“The entire world agreed on a reasonable way forward, based on the concepts of justice and accountability and government that
high - as distinct from the inebriation he’d fallen into later in the evening - had actually been reasonably clear headed, and calm. Comfortable…
In fact, it was possibly only the focusing effect of seeing Tony’s injuries that kept him from fainting.
“I’m okay,” Tony replied, uncomfortably. Trying to smile and not quite managing it. “Just a little breathless, is all.”
know. All the potential ways they could plan this. What would happen if they acted – what would happen if they didn’t.
The year that Tony spent thinking of Steve as someone honest, and compassionate… and a friend. Thinking that Steve was a terrible liar, thinking that it made him so uncomfortable. Thinking that Steve might be stubborn, and reactionary, and annoying as hell sometimes – but never that he couldn’t trust him. Never that he’d be that cold.
up until this point… Like it might be a whole other thing, that should have a completely different word.

that he’d let himself fall into this, after twenty years of telling himself not to, after all that thought he gave it.
Steve hit the bag even harder, with a force he could feel reverberating up his arm. And then again, and then again-
He heard the affectionate smile warm into Tony’s voice as he finished his anecdote, his hand stroking over Steve’s forearm, encouraging him,
what it’s like to have nothing. No home, no family, no identity. More than you do,” Nat explained. Steve almost snorted another laugh, but he bit that one back - mainly out of a sense of fairness. Because that probably wasn’t a completely ridiculous thing to say, when she had no way of knowing that he’d lived with it for twelve years already. “You may
still under the influence of either of those things, it could have nothing to do with a revelation this huge.
For some reason, this felt like something he was doing for Steve. Even while he was so diligently keeping Steve out of it, so pointedly telling himself it was nothing at all to do with him… Somewhere, Tony felt as though it was important for him to understand this, to
– and he turned the shower off with a bit too much force, and all but leapt out of it. He shook himself, disgusted at the thought, and then grabbed the nearest towel and began frantically drying himself.
Somewhere, he already knew it was sad to get all excited because he got to play human for a moment. All the things that he thought would be fun became uncomfortable, when there was nowhere for him to go with them.
The moments between the building and the car seemed to melt past him – like when he read a whole page of text without taking any of it in. He vaguely knew to be relieved that the Avengers were mostly preoccupied with the hordes of fleeing employees. He hadn’t had to make much in the way of conversation…
“But is there any point in doing that now?” Captain America asked. Because, personally, Steve might’ve preferred to do
So, for the time being, Steve didn’t think at all. He took the opportunity to look around the room, and at the other patrons, thinking of it as making notes for later rather than giving any of it any real thought now.
He sighed, heavily, and resigned himself to a few hours in the gym. Which seemed like a shallow, pointless use of all this adrenaline, but he couldn’t think of anything else-
...something that went right out of his head, the moment he saw the expression on Tony’s face. A wide-eyed amazement, and the hint of an astonished smile, and, already, the flicker of thoughts building up behind it all…
the same as the moment he unhooked that car battery and slotted the first arc reactor into place… But it reminded Tony of it.
All of their previous interactions were built on something that had never been real, motivated by all the impulses that Tony had vowed to give up. Tony had spent years trying to get Steve to notice him, trying to get Steve to like him, trying to be the one to make Steve happy… If he’d accepted that all those things were bad for both of them… What exactly did he do instead?
And, God, he was so relaxed and open, moving against Tony with absolutely no resistance. Every sensation played out so honestly right there on his face, as Tony twisted his fingers inside him, working him open in a steadily increasing rhythm
of drawing. This wasn’t a sketch someone had taken while they were designing the outfit, or keeping a record of this image, or even as an artistic portrait… This has been sketched with attention to certain details, with the intent of drawing the eye a certain way…

thing that Tony had ever experienced. For a good few minutes, it didn’t occur to him to question it. It seemed perfectly obvious what was so funny, this was a perfectly reasonable reaction… it was
There was a part of Steve that didn’t want to think about whether Tony liked him, or what he might like to happen, even hypothetically. A part of him that already knew he wanted more from Tony than just one night – a part of him that didn’t want to think about why he couldn’t have it.
Not that anything would change at midnight. But this was how he’d gotten through the months since Siberia, cutting them down into manageable pieces and meaningless milestones, willing himself through
The sweet, shy guy who made awkward small talk and winced every time his friend had to have an injection… was Captain America. And, yeah, Tony knew all that before – but he’d never really thought about it. He’d never tried to fit all these different things he knew about Steve into the same picture. He’d never thought about Steve being that brave, or that strong-
The elevator came to a soft stop beneath their feet, and Tony glanced up at Steve in time to see Steve staring straight ahead with a very specific focus.
Gingerly, he held his outfit out in front of him. As he’d suspected, every inch of the floor length tunic was covered with those thick metallic sequins, arranged in spirals of silver and blue and purple and red…
“Mostly,” he said, darkly. And then, when Stape raised his eyebrows in a questioning gesture, Steve clarified, “you said your employers

“Yeah, but, I mean… James Rhodes learned to fly one,” The CEO continued - in a far more cautious tone than he’d been using all night, but Steve was far beyond caring.
“You want to order some dinner and discuss how we help liberate the city of Mallamen?” He suggested, instead. And Steve just nodded, gratefully.
So, begrudgingly, he stopped himself from doing it at all. He waited as patiently as he could, until at last Steve took the phone from him, and smiled at it, and then brought it to rest in his lap with both hands clasped around it.
“I don’t know,” Tony shrugged. Rhodey pursed his lips as he considered that string of answers… And then quirked an eyebrow in a

“Okay gentlemen, it seems this afternoon’s misunderstanding has been straightened out, and you’ve been cleared for release,” he said, by way of greeting. Bucky, Sam and Tony exchanged a suspicious look, before Tony declared himself the spokesperson and asked,
And Tony just grinned… and finally took a mouthful of his coffee, which was lukewarm by now. He knew that Rhodey was absolutely dying to ask him more questions. Tony had the strangest feeling he wouldn’t mind answering
when he’s going to turn up. So, maybe it is worth thinking about that threat as well, and what we can try to do to stop it, or prepare for it, because who knows when it’s going to happen or what stage our other plans will be at - what state world security might be in, at that point… I mean, maybe if I get a look at it, I might be able to figure out how to stop him from coming at all.”
“Hey you,” Steve beamed, endeared and amused by the scene he’d walked into. And he would’ve asked all about it, except that Tony had managed to stand up by that point-
to really know what it’s like… And that I hate that you feel that way, and that it breaks my heart, and that I wish I could take it all away… And that I’m really not trying to dismiss it when I say - it is objectively

“Afternoon,” she greeted him, her tone professional and vaguely distracted. And then she glanced up at Tony.
“And I know that this isn’t everything,” Steve sighed. “And… Honestly, not all of my apologies are this easy, even though I know there are more of them. It’s not that I’m
And then Tony sucked again, shorter and shallower this time, like an electric shock through his already over sensitive flesh-
When he looked back up, there was an innocent sort of courage in his eyes, different to that fierce defiance Steve usually came up against…
Or made his own moral judgements about who deserved that information, and who could be trusted with it.
A more basic feeling heated in Steve’s blood, a primal sort of pride in Tony, a primeval instinct to make Tony
Before long, Steve noticed an unfamiliar sort of hesitancy cropping up in Tony’s demeanour- as though he wasn’t sure what to do with someone who just
“Focus” Steve answered, still frowning at it. And then, by way of explanation, he handed Tony the paper.
But then, as the evening wore on, Steve began to think it wasn’t only the relaxed atmosphere that he appreciated. By then it had occurred to him that this was the first time he’d ever been to an event like this as Tony’s boyfriend… That, for the first time ever, Steve didn’t have to hide how much he loved him.
With a far more tempered apprehension, Tony let his head rest on Steve’s shoulder again, and started by dismissing all the things he
...After all the confusion and compromise of the last half an hour, Steve felt like he had finally reached a solution that he had absolutely no problem with.
He groaned, and gave his feet a kick. And then he let go of a very deliberate sigh, and tried to make his peace with it.
“Tony!” Steve shouted, bucking his hips, twisting Tony’s hair into his fist, tensing his back against this sudden onslaught of sensation. The wet heat of Tony’s mouth so tight around him, the firm press of his tongue stroking back over Steve’s skin… Steve felt himself writhe involuntarily, and then another surge of dizzying pleasure as the head of his cock dragged over the back of Tony’s throat. There was a hot, compulsive ache, from deep in his thighs to the small of his back, something that almost hurt but that he wanted more of-
“Not my plan,” Wanda corrected. “I never put any plan into his head - it’s a pretty big leap from telling someone they’re not doing enough, to them making an evil sentient android.”
sorry about that,” he answered, not sure if he was going for sulky or remorseful, “and I know it was stupid, and-”
Tony,” Steve whispered, his hands working their way back down over Tony’s chest, and his stomach, curling their way over his hips. “You are beyond perfect. You are so much more interesting and dazzling and extraordinary than just perfect-”
Tony felt it weighing down on him, cold and heavy. That awareness he was always running from, that thing he never wanted to think about – the thing place he
you - I mean, I still mourn that man, I still miss him, even with you standing here… There are things I will
He thought of kissing Steve. He imagined the warmth of Steve’s lips and the firm press of Steve’s hands against his back-
It was only when Steve went to put his hand to Tony’s back that he remembered the bottle he was holding.
And that probably started him on the most surreal train of thought of the entire day, without him even realising.
That same shard of hurt twisted in Tony’s chest, and a thousand irrational, emotional thoughts came pouring out of the wound-
“No, I think that was just him working out that I probably get headaches,” Bucky answered, in the same bored tone. Steve felt his cheeks warm as he realised… he was doing it again. He reminded himself that he’d resolved
“I don’t really have what you’d call a ‘dining area’…” Tony warned hesitantly, as he dumped the empty pans into the sink.
He couldn’t apologise for how he was feeling at the moment, for a start. There was just no explanation or excuse for this. He’d rather die than admit this to Tony, whether he asked or not.
He noticed Steve seemed a bit more relaxed than he had, at least. And Tony realised… yeah, there was a niceness to this. Being able to talk in the abstract about the issues that were outside of all human experience, but somehow still part of their actual lives…
The anticipation built up in his chest, pushing up against his ribs, until it was almost unbearable-
thank you,” Steve said curtly, over another round of snickering, “we’re going to the, uh, flower show, thing…”
As subtly as he could, he tapped and armed his watch, and shifted his weight into battle stance. He tried to keep his expression natural and his posture looking relaxed, as he slowly turned to look back over the drive-
And, God, it was even worse than just saying that he still wanted it now. Okay, obviously Steve still wanted to kiss him now – he’d wanted to kiss him for the last seven years, why would he suddenly not want to kiss him now? And, okay, maybe that would’ve meant he couldn’t completely distance himself from what he’d done, maybe it would’ve stopped him from claiming it had
“Nat roped me into training with the Maximoffs,” Bucky answered, as he carried on over to the fridge. “Why, what are you doing for the rest of the day?”
The ache in his hips tightened, the edge of pain bleeding into his breathing now, a pleading tone to every little gasp. His fingers pressed hard into the blankets, his only outlet for any of this barely tolerable pressure. His cock throbbed sharply, leaking steadily against his stomach, dripping onto the blankets. It was the most basic human instinct that urged him, again and again, to touch himself, the way he would immediately press his hand to a burn-
Steve froze, every muscle coiled tight anticipation, as he tracked that ominous creaking sound through the ceiling above him…
madness kicks in again the moment we get home, I might start doing stupid things to get him to notice me again - and, by the way, if you catch me doing that, you have my full permission to point it out… even though you won’t, and even though I probably wouldn’t listen to you…” That expression crossed his face again, like he was considering saying something more… and then he shook it away. “But I think I’m still going to remember figuring this out. I mean, I might not
As subtly as he could, Steve began taking shorter, shallower breaths. He dug his nails hard into his palms, deliberately twisting his shoulders so that they were tense and uncomfortable.
“Are you okay?” Tony whispered softly from just beside him. It was actually just the two of them, for the time being. They’d been asked to wait in a little side room, with a plush cream carpet, and two white linen love seats, facing each other across a low glass coffee table. Steve felt like they were waiting to talk to someone about their prostate issues, or something. Like there should be a stack of glossy magazines smiling up at him from the floor.
It might have been easier if Steve had just had ‘a plan for world domination’. Tony would have thought he was crazy, but at least it would be simple to explain.
proud of him,” Nat babbled on, gesticulating more than she usually would, her eyes softened by drink, or drugs - or flowers, apparently. “I mean, I know it’s also hilarious, but as well as being hilarious, I’m also genuinely proud of him.”
Steve reacted instinctively – he actually took a little step back. He knew his shock and horror was probably completely clear on his face-
he felt, thinking that Pepper felt no desire to stand up for him - that she didn’t even see the need.
He blinked a few times as the colours in the room came back into focus, and took a slow breath that was surprisingly refreshing…
Steve choked out a low gasp, barely registering the shock of it before Tony had pushed two fingers into him in one smooth motion. It felt so much, so
So, that had left him with nothing to do but go back to the same spot on the couch, and pick up the same train of thought from the night before.
“When did I ever make you laugh before this?” Tony challenged… And Steve couldn’t believe that wasn’t an easier question…
“Uh, well, like I say, I don’t have to breathe at all… As long as I drink blood. But I didn’t, tonight. I… got distracted.” Tony muttered, aiming for light-hearted and simply ending up awkward.
But, reluctantly, he focused enough to observe that - as intimidated as Wesley clearly was - he wasn’t physically
organisation do something terrible? What about all the things you don’t know?” Steve implored, speaking too quickly. “This
When he’d started this, it had been so much more knowing, more cerebral… more FOCUSed, maybe. Maybe that was it… But he’d started off thinking of this as some sort of closure. Whatever he’d said to Steve about it not meaning
escalating effect of the drugs, he really had been yelling at himself to get Tony and go. He had a very simple two-point plan, which he’d been repeating to himself over and over for the last two minutes, just hoping he could keep his head clear enough for long enough to say it. He’d forgotten the wider context, he couldn’t let himself be distracted by more details than that, he just had to 1) Make Sure Tony Said It Was Okay To Leave, and 2) Leave.
...And he hated the idea of anything that might delay getting to Bucky. Somewhere, Steve knew that he was only just holding his composure together on that one. That his patience and determination were built around these deadlines. That he was already spending so much of his energy trying to ignore that imagined torture chamber - and, now, those remembered screams… That he might break and ruin everything, if something forced him to wait.
That, actually, everything might be a bit different to how he’d thought it was… a bit more complicated…
“There are lots of problems…” Steve sighed, sinking back into the couch. It was a horrible couch. Too firm and covered in cheap fabric and an ugly orangey-brown colour. Clearly they didn’t give much thought to the little touches at… Steve literally had to look for something branded before he could remember where he was… Talleroy Communications.
, it’d sound like they were the one with the problem, like they were being entitled and unkind. Which they are, but they don’t want to sound like that – so they call it
“Yes, for you.” Steve smiled. “And, honestly, if I was talking to anyone else on earth, I’d think twice about trying to explain it… But it’s you. So, I’m going to tell you exactly what happened, and then, if you’ll let me, I’ll do my best to explain how...and why,” and again, he waited.
Why, now that he thought of it, he always stopped himself when that word was about to fall over his lips - why that was the
Not according to the computer system, there wasn’t. And that meant, if it existed, the fourth floor had a separate power supply, a separate communication network, a separate ventilation system – and great efforts had been taken to conceal all of it.
And Adam shuffled back from him, in a state of panic, his eyes wide and wet and fixed on Steve like an animal that doesn’t dare take its eyes off of a predator. Steve could
So, happily, Steve sat down at one end of one of the plush, cream couches. Tony sat down at the other end, smiling shyly, visibly collecting up everything he had to say.
“Me too.” Tony smiled, squeezing Steve’s hand. “And, who knows, it might even end up being more use. More than… I don’t know,
“Sometimes I wonder how that kid would’ve turned out… I mean, literally how I would’ve spoken, or reacted, or… Like, I
Stape threw his arms wide to gesture wildly at that, and Steve tried not to look too openly relieved that he’d moved the gun away.
“Right, okay.” Steve answered on autopilot… and then Tony was moving again, and the door was opening, and Janine was back.
“It’s not about security – it’s about the drugs they have up there. Well, which is about security, I suppose…” She paused, briefly, to yawn. “But, if you get invited up there, they ask you to take a pill before you go up. Counters the effect of the atmosphere, mostly. If you’re there without an invite, you’re there without a pill – and you’ll just be a sobbing wreck on the floor, within a few steps.”
Tony nodded again, and thought about some of the things he really would have liked to say - all the playful observations it would have been fun to share, all the conversations that could have unfolded so easily, all the ways in which he could’ve relaxed into this happy state of mind…
“Well, like I say – sort of” Tony sighed, “Governments around the world have actually been working on making a ‘truth serum’ since, like, the 1960s… possibly earlier. And most of those theories were focused on barbiturates – which basically ‘worked’ by lowering inhibitions, and making people more pliable. And generally, they were useless. Because, yeah, they could sometimes get people to talk, but they also made people really suggestible, and passive, and generally likely to parrot back anything they heard.
, is not a big deal. To me. I mean, I’ve had my fair share of unwise one night stands while under the influence, and I’ve gone to work with people after regrettable nights before – and I know it isn’t the same. But, all of that is part of how I come to my decision on this. So, everyone is going to have a different, I don’t know, feeling, about all of this…” And he took a deep breath, and slowed himself, and made himself look Steve in the eye when he went on “And, my decision –
Whatever the reason, Bucky was very happy to spend the afternoon answering all of Tony’s questions about ‘the Mustard Incident.’
If it helps, most of the drama has passed (and, crucially, it's finally dropped below 30°C in my living room....) and we're really quite close to the end now, so you shouldn't have to wait too much longer!
Vaguely, he considered that maybe this was exactly what he deserved. Karma, on behalf of all the people who’d ever tried to talk sense into him while he was drunk…

of what had happened with Tony. He still didn’t know anything about Steve donating his blood – partly, because Tony had asked Steve not to say anything, and partly… well, because it was personal. Which was a very strange thing for Steve to think when talking to
“Probably just as well” Tony answered, taking his own drink more hesitantly. “Not to show us up at the newbies that we are, but I think we might have overdone it already-”
“Sir? Ms Potts to see you.” JARVIS told him, interrupting another aimless daydream. Tony blinked… and smiled.
“No, no, no,” Tony warned, as Peter came to a deliberate stop about two feet away from them, and began searching for a clear shot. “Don’t you dare - I’ll tell Aunt May!”
Wesley's breath seemed to seize in his chest. His shoulders hardened inwards, and the colour began to drain from his skin. And then, as Tony was debating whether to change tactics or ramp it up another notch, Wesley managed to bite out an answer,
Steve’s head fell back against the pillows, his lips parting in a silent gasp as Tony pressed his fingertips to his rim-
“Rough how? Did something happen?” He demanded, making no effort to mask the immediate panic that had gripped him.
But part of his brain had worked out that he might need to know this. That, however desperate he was to simply
And then Tony placed a firm hand to the centre of Steve’s chest. Steve felt all the air just leave his body, his skin literally burning under Tony’s palm, instinctively leaning into it – but knowing he couldn’t move any more than that. And then he felt Tony push against him, and relented immediately, not so much
And he’d grown to like her more as time went on… But whether that was because Nat had changed, or because he had, or because they just grew closer… he didn’t know.
“There’s a room on the second floor” She said eventually, talking to the floor now “It’s dark, and has a lot of obstructions… and an office, set behind it. You’d be able to interrogate someone there, without anyone seeing you, if you were
“It’s, I say what I think, and they say ‘whatever you say Cap’ and… how can I complain about that, I’m not complaining about that, I just – you can’t ask someone to not be
He hadn’t realised until this moment, but those were the exact words for that shapeless discomfort that he’d always felt… That even if there
, at least. So, he did his best to make it that bit easier, even while he pushed on with this thing he knew Tony would find it hard to listen to. This thing he knew he had to do.
to talk to Tony right now... Having an actual conversation with Tony would mean thinking about which Tony to visit, and what Steve would want to say, and would almost certainly end with yet another personal revelation that he wouldn’t be able to process…
“He's called Loki. He's... not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.”
“Hm,” Tony nodded. “Yeah, well, you know what I was worried about back then… Just, in general… But yeah, since then I… Kinda fell in love with him.”
“It’s… an Earth thing. It’s hard to – it’s not important.” He muttered, and then gave his head a little shake. “I’m sorry, ignore that completely, carry on.” Zan considered him for a moment. And then she continued.
He wouldn’t make personal comments about Steve’s sleeping habits, except maybe to gently mock them. Not in an earnest attempt to build some common ground between them, certainly.
Tony almost flinched away from it, purely out of surprise. Surprise that Steve was still here, surprise that he’d managed to stop thinking about him – surprise that the reaction was just as sudden and just as intense, even though he’d been quite happily ignoring the same man a few seconds earlier-
to reach out to her now. That she should be the first person he called, when faced with a trauma this huge. That she probably
Steve broke out into a high pitched cry as Tony’s cock hit that sweet spot deep inside him, a sharp sensation cracking through him, his shoulders going limp under the force of it. “Oh, God, again, there, please-
friends – and I don’t even get to know what’s going on. And then I’m just one item on the debrief, things you could’ve done better…and you’re writing to me saying you wished we agreed about the Accords.”
There was a sharp kick low in Steve’s stomach. He didn’t dare hope, and he couldn’t bear to think, and-
Steve glanced up from his computer monitor to find Selvig smiling at him from the other side of the desk.
“Okay,” Steve grinned, and struggled to his feet. He waited until he was at the door to add, softly, “thank you.”
It wasn’t submission, exactly… It was trust. Complete, unwavering, unconditional trust. Like Steve had handed Tony his heart to hold.
This rush of affection, that cut through all of Tony’s inhibitions and made him feel happy and warm,
-” The words seized in Steve’s chest as Tony sucked a bruising kiss to the tender skin just above his waistband-
Something in his brain told him to go back, that there was an element here they hadn’t prepared for… but his legs overruled him. They just followed Tony down the stairs. They came out at the corner of a small, low ceilinged basement, lit with naked florescent bars. The whole room was made of concrete, and contained four mismatched old office desks, on which eight top-of-the-line computers were sitting idle. There was another door at the back of the room, and Steve could just about make out the sounds of people behind it… a low murmur of industry, like the ammunitions factories at home.
And he saw Tony’s eyes flash, startled or intrigued, he couldn’t tell. And he had a sudden stab of panic that he’d said something wrong, that he’d ruined something.
Usually it was simply because something had made him think of Steve, or he’d wondered what Steve would say about something, or… just because Tony missed the sound of his voice. And, although it was tempting to attribute that to some vampire instinct or supernatural draw… Mostly, Tony just
And, like a great many things he’d been taught in the forties, Steve had come to recognise that all of that was total bullshit.
, or something… And maybe that is what pushed me to leave the house today… But I don’t think that means it’s like,
person, and he should probably deal with that revelation before he gave any thought to what Tony was saying-
“Actually, there are a few things I need to do first,” he said. He was pleased that Steve simply raised his eyebrows, intrigued rather than hurt or concerned. “I, uh… Tell you what, I’ll get Rhodey to drive me home, and I’ll talk to him, and Pepper, and… get a few things sorted. And you can get whatever medical checks and incident reports out of the way. And then you can come over tonight and we can talk properly. About everything. Is that okay?”
He’d spent so much of the mission trying to ignore a painful erection that he barely bothered to notice that he was hard, anymore.
he didn’t understand why anyone was doing anything these days – that it would hardly make Steve feel better to hear that Tony shared his level of ignorance.
After all that investigation, The Avengers had reached the same conclusion they started with – that The Facility was dodgy as fuck. That they had no choice but to go in and see what was going on-
Steve looked away again, and screwed his eyes shut, wishing he could will himself out of existence for just a moment-
“Okay,” Steve whispered, already moving forward. Taking one final glance at each of the entrances, before his purposeful stride broke into a run-
… Steve had to admit, there was a sharp stab of hurt, just at the thought of it. And with that, the realisation that he really hadn’t thought about it like that before, and God, he felt terrible for that…
Even as the thought was still forming, Steve was already making the point, stroking a firm palm along each of Tony’s legs, pushing his thighs further apart, bidding him to lift his hips-
And then those few pages. That relatively short account by a man who clearly wasn’t a vampire hunter – who clearly used the word to mean vampire historian instead.
“Bucky,” he tried again, more urgently, relieved when he saw Bucky blink… and then frown in sleepy confusion.
It was as pristine and expensive-looking as anywhere else in the building, with dark hardwood flaws that’d been polished to a perfect finish, and intricately carved frames and skirting boards that would’ve counted as works of art on their own. At the far end of the room, opposite the grand double doors they’d walked in through, was a raised stage, framed by thick black velvet curtains that were held back by gold-detailed silk. The two other walls were lined with imposing looking wooden chairs, almost certainly antique.
“You don’t seem very sorry,” Tony noted, with a still-breathless grin. “If I didn’t know better I’d say that was on purpose.”
day having a very sensible, entirely rational talk with himself about this whole situation, and he’d come up with a perfectly level-headed compromise. He had
He glanced over and found himself looking at the side of Tony’s head. He had the distinct impression that Tony had looked away from him the moment he realised what he’d said.
“Well, it’d take a small moderation to the virus,” Tony shrugged. “But nothing I couldn’t do right now on my phone.”
desperate to get out of this situation – just to get out of this gag – only a few seconds earlier. He’d
As quietly as he could, he rose from the couch and stepped into the hall, pausing to survey the area. He cast a glance at his shield, resting in its usual place by the front door, but he didn’t reach for it yet. A quick calculation suggested it might be better to start this thing with both hands free.
There was a sudden spike of something – fear, excitement, shock… maybe some whole new emotion that Steve had never felt before in his life. Somehow, he was still unwilling or unable to drag his mind out of this very second, he
logic Steve had used to talk himself into the worst decision that he’d ever made - it was the reason he’d kept that secret from Tony in the first place...
“This isn’t good.” Tony commented – and, weirdly enough, it did help. It pulled Steve out of his own head, back into a strange situation he was sharing with someone else… a situation that physically existed-
He knew exactly when and how his window of opportunity was going to come about. He knew exactly how to use it.
Steve’s head swam, as some of that unbearable tension eased out of his chest. The next few breaths he took were cool, and slightly sweet. Everything slowed down just a little.
it now. He knew there was no ulterior motive behind these promises. He knew that Steve wasn’t some deluded fan with a crush on his public image. He
. So, I just mean… was that literally true? And, I mean, thinking it about it now… I don’t know, does it seem…
“…Or if maybe everything is like I thought it was, and that’s okay, and it’s just kind of… nice it happened…? I mean, maybe it’s all just the same shit, and this is just a thing that happened” Tony just carried on, talking to himself now. Trying to work out the shape of this thing. “Until what happens afterwards… but maybe that was always going to be awful, and maybe it’s actually less awful now.
to say – that he loved Tony, that he was happy it had happened, that it was incredible, that he wanted it to happen again. But there was this deep resistance to actually saying any of it, all of a sudden. A fear of ruining everything, upsetting Tony… making an ass of himself.
And then Steve heard the speedy patter of footsteps echoing from the left-hand hallway, and then Tony all but slid across the polished floor, coming to a not-especially-graceful stop right in front of him.
mad by this and – I don’t want anyone to die! I don’t want my Dad to go to prison and I don’t want to tear my whole family apart – but she’s just going to kill five hundred people! And there
And then he felt Tony slide his arm under him in one smooth, confident motion, somehow managing to roll Steve over as he lifted him up. Steve squeaked another surprised little giggle as Tony took all of his weight under one arm, holding him there while he tugged the wet duvet out from under him and threw it to one side. Still supporting Steve against his body as he climbed onto the bed next to him, and guided him to lie down against his chest.
And then that humming panic ballooned up in Steve’s head, smothering everything else. For a good few seconds he simply fell into that silence, thinking only of swallowing his heartbeat back down.
A little frown pinched at Tony’s dreamy expression, as he tried to decide whether he was uncomfortable with this train of thought…
“It’s always going to be like this, now,” Tony promised. Wanting to reassure Steve that all the games were over with, that he’d
Firstly, my apologies, but there will be a slight delay on the next update of this fic. To make a long story short (ish), half my work got pinged by the covid app, everyone had to rearrange their rota at short notice - including me picking up some random night shifts, which has fully blown my sleep patterns 😆 - and as such my schedule changed at the last minute. The good news is that I have a holiday right after that, so I'll be able to catch up again in time for the following update (and, all going to plan, get loads of writing done, so that might even mean I'll be able to update faster after that) But, in the short term, the next update is going to have to get pushed back to Wednesday the 6th of October. Sorry!
And then the half-memory of a story that Thor once told about his mothers favourite garden, leading to a curiosity about which garden it was…
A strange, cold feeling started rising up in Steve as he thought of Tony… Entirely unharmed, immediately recovered enough to resume his medical duties…
The elevator dinged cheerfully, and the doors slid open. Tony saw Steve take a little breath and set his shoulders before he dared to look at him.
And the bitter realisation that Steve woke up this way every morning, the ominous awareness that soon he’d remember all the things that made him miserable and irritable all the time
he was allowed to tell Bucky this – there was no reasonable way he could keep it from him, and anyway, Tony had outright said he could… But still, he felt an immediate resistance to saying any of this to anyone.
“What the hell are you talking about?” Nick interrupted, sounding exasperated now… But Steve could hear the fear in it. Whether it was because of what Steve was saying, or still the effect of finding a stranger in his living room… Steve didn’t actually care. Just as long as he was afraid.
...Although, now that he thought of it, this wasn’t the first time Bucky had gotten a completely different reaction from Steve to the one he was expecting.
The feeling of Steve, warm and solid against his chest, the soft heat of his mouth, the entreating, almost hesitant way Steve put his hands to Tony’s back-
“Okay, well, I think we’ve just finished clearing every floor” Rhodey began, his voice pulled just that little bit tighter, like it always did when he was in the middle of a mission. “A couple of awkward fuckers, obviously, but… well, the point is, if
But then, reality was beginning to slip away from him, at this stage. His senses had started to float away from each other, the context and connections between them getting lost in the growing darkness…
And then Steve put a firm hand to the inside of Tony’s thigh, and the sensation was so intense that Tony moaned, and tensed into it. Steve carried on pushing his legs apart, that determined confidence radiating from him like the forcefield around a magnet.
mean to exclude you, or disrespect you, or, any of that – but I know I still did those things, and I’m still sorry. I might not have put any intention into hurting you, but I didn’t put nearly enough into
And now he heard Tony talking to him like a co-worker, and he thought maybe it wasn’t a start at all… maybe it was an ending. Maybe there had been more hope back when Tony was giving him the silent treatment and cold responses – back when Tony was showing him that he was hurt. And Tony had shown him, and shown him, and to make it all worse, Steve
Steve was surprised to feel his voice running away from him, the words still flowing even as his lungs implored them to slow up. His heart began to race, pulsing in his throat, catching on every other syllable-
And now he thought of all those times they’d talked, back at The Tower. The times when Tony had felt brave enough to ask how Steve was feeling, and Steve had opened up a little, and Tony had felt so fucking optimistic…
wanted to get away from that airport before you found us there, I just… wanted it to be over, I just thought if we got there, and stopped those super soldiers before you had to get involved that
Amazingly - thanks to the sedative, and the adrenaline crash that happened when he realised that he’d genuinely pulled it off - Steve actually fell into a light doze while he was lying in a medical bay.
“Well, it’s up to you,” Tony told him, still dubious. “I mean, it doesn’t affect the procedure one way of the other. It’s just to make you more comfortable. So, I guess, if it doesn’t make you more comfortable…” And the confusion melted away as he spoke, and Steve could just see him thinking it,
To be honest, Steve had picked that request almost at random - because it was the first request he could think of that would work as a test. Something he was quite sure Nick would’ve refused under any other circumstances. Something that he could connect to Tony...
anxieties didn’t really get a look in here. Not when Bucky had to work through so many traumas, every single time they did this. Steve knew there were a hundred things Bucky was trying not to think about right now. Things he was trying so hard not to
“…And if it’s an AI this basic, it’s probably using basic over-rides…” Tony continued to muse, getting down on his knees to look at the back of the computer panel, “…So, if I force reset it…” He held his watch to the back of the panel, and waited, and then stood up to look at the screen – tapping the edge of it impatiently, while something loaded… And then he smiled. He held his thumb down on the screen, and said in a loud, clear voice.
Tony could feel that memory stalking in the shadows at the back of his mind. The moment he was trying so hard not to revisit…
had known it was a bad idea, at the time. That Rhodey or Sam or even Nat would’ve been a better choice, however their abilities compared on paper… that there were probably excuses he could’ve given, without mentioning ‘The Thing That Happened’…
… But not right now. Right now, Tony only felt it... a wordless sense that everything would be alright in the end.
been working on all this time. Steve already had a hundred plans in mind to track those people down, all far better thought out than anything he’d had the first time around.
- about his father’s relationship with Steve. He’d had that idea long before he’d fallen in love with Steve; before he’d even
Steve thought back to Nick’s stuttered attempts to respond when he’d first asked for these files… And, immediately, he was sure that Nick wouldn’t have tried to keep anything from him. Whatever Fury could possibly get his hands on was now sitting on Steve’s desk…
“Because I’m scared of both of them,” Bucky answered candidly. Tony’s disbelieving grimace melted into a thoughtful frown.

“Tony-” Pepper tried again, but he simply waved her quiet as he pulled his phone out his pocket and hit
Steve did his best to wipe the silly grin from his face, as he descended the stairs down to Tony’s workshop. He should probably make
A detailed charcoal sketch of a muscular, dark haired man - in what really looked like a lace baby doll.
He pulled the office chair back and fell into it with too much force, causing it to slide back in a fashion not exactly in keeping with the mood. Irritably, he pulled himself forward again, suddenly filled with an energy that he was still too dizzy and weak to do anything with.
outside the reach of our communications technology, at least for now. Ideally, we would have liked to send you an invitation and a programme in advance, but I’m afraid it wasn’t possible.”
“Okay, I’m going to shut up and stop distracting you,” Steve mocked himself, reaching for his t-shirt. Hurrying to get dressed now, thinking only of how he was stopping Tony from making himself well again.
attractive stranger would spark some sort of reaction in him. And, okay, the thought that maybe he was so physically lonely that he’d started fixating on total strangers… wasn’t exactly a comfort. But, for some reason, it better than thinking that he had a specific issue with Tony.
And Steve’s face was already hardening in preparation for an impassioned objection on Tony’s behalf. He was
from the wall ahead of them, making both of them flinch to attention. There was a fog of fine grey smoke…
Because, on the grandest scale, in the long term – his entire world view had changed, and for the better.
They both knew that, if they did this thing now, they would have to do it a certain way. They no longer had the option of laying out an elaborate lie, or shielding the staff from any unpleasantness, or taking the time to conceal that they’d even been there. They knew they
Steve thought back to the stoic generals and politicians of his era. The sombre way they took responsibility for everything, out of some universal sense of honour…whilst never really taking responsibility for anything at all.
For one very brief moment, Steve found himself right back where he left off -  talking to a government agent about Howard’s latest investigation into Hydra tech.
had found his way in this modern world well enough to have a sex life, by now. That fact made it much harder for Steve to pretend that he was putting ‘all that’ to one side because of what had happened. Steve had to accept that Bucky didn’t really need him to put his whole life on hold anymore... Which meant Steve probably had to accept that he had his own, full blown issue with sex, now.
Still, Steve flinched. He hadn’t meant to, but the visual image was so immediate, and so horrible, that he couldn’t check himself in time. Tony narrowed his eyes, unimpressed, a deliberate edge on his voice when he asked, “something about that idea bothers you?”
“Good morning Sir,” JARVIS prompted, when Tony didn’t move. Tony semi shook himself to his senses - enough to step out of the elevator, at least.
So, because it was the first idea that occurred to him that he couldn’t find a problem with, Steve decided to go to Tony’s house in Malibu - after Tony had become Iron Man but before he ever met Steve.
So, he popped the little pill free of its paper packaging, his hand still concealed in his pocket, and then swallowed it as discretely as he could. And then he closed his eyes and tried to count to ten.
“Well, there was this guy, with this really tiny lute, and he just kept hovering around Steve like a fly, and not really

level of intellect, it’s pretty hard to measure, but based on the scores they had, it was a best guess – and I just looked at him, like… That’s it? That’s just… his IQ then. His IQ is just… a kajillion, then. And that just… didn’t fit in my head.”
… and suddenly, the thought of having an easy chat with Steve as impossible as it had the first time he walked in.
It seemed to take forever, and no time at all, before his hand was up against the door. He allowed himself half a second to brace before he pushed it open and stepped into the unknown-
“Well, best answer to that is to independently verify some of that information.” Tony suggested, coolly.

And after all this time looking at each of those perspectives in isolation, jumping from one to the other and driving himself mad trying to decide between them, Tony finally looked at it all together.

“But substances such as herbal teas, or biological functions such as… a fit of the giggles, wouldn’t be considered ‘inebriating’, as such?” Freddie enquired.
then.” Tony carried on sharply – fronting out Adams insidious suggestion. Refusing to engage it. “The ‘day’ you transform earth?”
Together, he and Tony reached that tipping point, and then everything was yanked out from under them in a rush.
And he couldn’t think of them now, without remembering what it had come to. He couldn’t bare to think of what they might’ve been, by now, if only things hadn’t… if only
He found himself thinking back to the first time he saw Tony, telling himself that clearly, he couldn’t have been in love with him
Tony’s cock pulsed sharply, and he touched himself before he could think to stop it. Just an impulsive response to pain, at first. But then he felt that friction shock through his body, a blissful relief and a deeper ache all at once. He froze, knowing that he
It was like the first lie in after a busy week, like finally falling into a favourite armchair after the long walk home… Like finding his natural resting position, after so many years bracing his shoulders. Every inch of him tingled with perfect, satisfied relief.
Their tour had taken them over half a mile, and through night clubs and bars and spas and restaurants and parks and grottos – and an awful lot of sex. Sex in all of the above places, and in rooms specifically designed. There were live sex shows, and screens displaying graphic images and staff offering products for any conceivable sexual fantasy.
Tony would’ve had no qualms whatsoever about sending the Avengers on the strength of an instinct alone – if his instincts had been clear that
“…not that I can think of.” Zan shook her head “I… had to think very hard, to prepare this much, and I didn’t think… I wasn’t sure what you’d ask, so…”
And he thought… If he’d woken up in a distant and alien future, having lost literally everyone he’d ever known, and then found out that Rhodey was alive somewhere, the subject of inhumane experimentation… If he’d
And in the end it came down to the fact that Captain America knew what he was supposed to say, and Steve Rogers didn’t. In that moment, he was actually sure he really

human. That he’d been judging this thing according to criteria and priorities that just didn’t apply…
By then, Steve had fallen into a gentle doze on his lap, and Tony had kind of lost himself in this rare opportunity to just look at him… He was quite sincere when he told Belle that he didn’t mind. That he’d barely noticed it getting later.
“...It means that I really like you,” Tony breathed. And then the elated smile eased into a more cautious expression, before he added, “I mean… I still don’t think I
And it wasn’t the setting itself that was so astonishing. It was the fact that, at the moment, after the particular day Steve had had, this was exactly what he’d wanted. That every little detail was so perfectly
Steve could feel Tony melting into his embrace as the others were talking, letting his weight rest against Steve’s chest, pulling Steve’s arms tighter around him.
” Tony commented acerbically, still not entirely sure what tone he was going for “He used to say you’d be mortally disappointed if you ever met me, and how you would immediately call me out for being a shallow smart-ass,
Okay – The Accords. That had always been first on the list. He couldn’t tell Tony he was sorry he… hadn’t…
“Got you into swim shorts,” Tony grinned, flicking Steve’s waistband playfully. Steve barked a surprised laugh before Tony could carry on. “
this had grabbed his attention so completely – and, in the first instance, Tony wanted to tell Steve that, too.
He glanced up at Rhodey, who had fallen into a bored stare halfway through the journey. Steve reminded himself that his
And then he felt Tony force one hand down between the two of them, stroking roughly over the outline of Steve’s cock as he scrabbled rather awkwardly for the button at the top of Steve’s jeans. And, for a second, Steve’s head was just swimming from the sudden contact, his whole being focused on getting at more of it, mindlessly writhing up against Tony’s hand-
“Honestly, I don’t know - I mean, I don’t know what’s wrong with him,” she answered. “He’s been sulky and brooding for three days now - which is not a look that works for him.”
It seemed like such a very human thing, to be standing with every muscle tensed, his heart swelling to bursting point as he listened to that dial tone. Waiting for the boy he liked to answer…
“But I don’t claim to know her, because she did one stupid, cruel, unnecessary thing,” Steve breathed, with a tad more control. “For all I know, it was most out of character and she feels terrible for it. Maybe she thought about it afterwards and resolved never to spy on a dying civilian ever again. That’s not really my business.”
And it felt like a cheat, a creepingly self-serving excuse, to try and find solace in the people that he
never forgive myself - because I actually knew that was going to happen. And I could have stopped it. And, if you’d just let me help you, I know we could put a plan together, and get every piece of tech we could possibly need, and board a private plan by this time tomorrow - we could bring him home with us tomorrow night. So,” he finished, with a shrug.
Steve let go of a visceral scream as the next few waves of this crashed over him – they had sharp edges now, a burning need left in the echo of every thrust,
“No, I didn’t,” Steve corrected him sharply. “How is that a nice story? I said it was nice that they got
snapped and called Tony a few weeks earlier? What if he’d never come to New York in a bid to make amends - what if he hadn’t been there when Thanos minions tried to snatch the Time Stone, and Dr Strange along with it?
Confident enough to have stopped worrying who might see them, as he strolled up to a control panel next to one of the machines…
“Okay, just tell me this,” Bucky suggested, after a moment. “You know the first time you spoke to Peggy, when you came out with that stuff out about not expecting a beautiful dame to join the army or whatever – was it worse than that?” And Steve groaned, and threw one arm over his face.
And then a sudden, cold dread swelled up in Tony’s stomach, up into his chest, flooding his entire body.
been worse… This was everything made better in a single stroke. Every hurt and fear that Tony had ever experienced, instantly erased and replaced with a joy he’d never dared hope for. This wasn’t finding a light in the dark; this was stepping out of the dark completely, for maybe the first time in his life.

The friendly moments and more personal kindnesses they’d shared were the easiest to find, the ones he’d most overthought, and replayed over and over… But it was only now that Steve recognised that he hadn’t been acting like
“We should probably talk about Fury’s offer,” Tony reminded him after a moment. Steve’s jaw clenched again.
Bucky had only just realised that he’d been dreading this conversation… And that he’d never pushed through that resistance to ask himself exactly
Usually, at moments like this, Steve would try to visualise the potential outcomes. Even when he had no idea what a place looked like, he’d still have
He followed comfortably as Tony led the way outside, to where Happy would be waiting for them, looking unduly enthused about being in the driver's seat, for once. Steve still found it odd that Tony hired a chauffeur and then almost always insisted on driving for himself, but these days it was filed away as a charming eccentricity rather than a frustrating misnomer.
“I’m sorry about Peggy” Tony answered – which caught Steve a little off guard, somewhat. And then Tony saw his face, and shook his head, and added “Sorry, that probably sounded… random – there was a link in my head, I swear. Well. Just that… I didn’t really know how to say that at the time, either. I remember thinking,
“JARVIS?” He demanded, his system suddenly flooded with adrenaline, his eyes locked on the elevator door as he jumped to his feet.
rational. He didn’t deny that he’d desperately wanted any excuse to see Tony again, and obviously his desire to help him was at least partly emotional… But Steve was sure that he’d spent the last few days thinking about the objective benefits and the logical arguments, exactly as he’d explained them to Tony.
And Tony felt that stupid grin break out on his face, without warning and completely of its own accord. He turned away in a pointless attempt to hide it.
But that issue did seem so much more approachable than all the others. At least Steve had some idea what he was bracing for, with that one. And at least he knew that Bucky would help him out… Steve
“…And I’m telling you, no. I don’t think that, no.” Tony answered, and Steve looked at him so hopelessly, Tony could tell – “You don’t believe me.”
Every inch of him thrummed with a physical sense of peace, something he wouldn’t have been able to explain, but that he already knew so well. A fundamental sort of comfort, as though he’d found his natural resting position…
means, if we can get into that system in the first place, we can get to everything,” he worked his way into the big finish, speaking more confidently now. “If we can find one of Hydra’s hubs, for example, somewhere that would have to be hooked up to that network - from there we could take it all down. Delete everything that Hydra ever built,
However, the upside of my having to rearrange my shifts/holiday at the last minute is that I'm now off work for THREE WEEKS - which means I can't get caught out by the rota changes for a while 😆 (and yes, I AM turning off the work phone for a while, because as much as I love them and like to help out - I'm tired)
1. As I hope is made abundantly clear throughout, Steve is in a very bad place and is reacting partly out of grief and trauma. As such, not everything he says is entirely fair or rational - and neither is it an accurate reflection of his balanced views. I hope the chapter also makes clear that this is out of character for Steve (that is kind of the point, in fact) so please don't take this as a reflection of my view of Steve in general.
Well, attempted to distract himself, he should say, because it wasn’t as though any of his recent busy work had actually taken his mind off Steve.
“...It’s never been like this. With anyone,” he stammered instead. “I’ve never - I’ve never felt like this, before…”
“In which case, you will probably find that our fruit juices have less of an effect than our water,” he suggested, gently, like he was expecting Tony to demand-
what I’m going to start working on… But I don’t really know what I’m doing with it, yet,” he shrugged. “I don’t know… I just need something to do with my hands, and my head, for a while…”
The thing that the myth of Captain America had taken from him, more fundamental even than ‘I’m sorry’, or ‘I need help’.
“I think the problem is actually in your brain,” Tony started, carefully – and then, when he saw the flash of alarm on Bucky’s face, he raced to clarify- “But that doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with your brain. It’s not actually anything to do with your brain…”
“Renovation of one of the wings,” Steve corrected casually. “New IT system, new exhibits - just trying to get some additional publicity out of the thing, I think.”
It wasn’t that Steve was any less furious at the people who had wronged him, just because things had worked out for the best. It wasn’t that he suddenly thought these injustices and awful crimes were vindicated, because they’d
Tony gave himself a little mental kick. Called himself spoilt and self centred, for good measure. Right now, it didn’t matter how much Steve had hurt him. Right now, Tony just had to think about how not to hurt other people.
Nick Fury was one of a very, very small group of people who had ever known that Steve was a vampire. He didn’t really know what it
“You were doing what the Nazi’s told you to do!” Steve spat back, with enough venom that Nick shrank back into silence. “You didn’t do
As he drank, he saw Tony glance over to the bar – to where two of the barmen were now definitely taking an interest in him. Steve pointedly finished the glass before he took it away from his lips.
“...Thanks,” Tony deadpanned, while someone breathed a laugh. The assistant was, of course, entirely unaffected by their lack of enthusiasm.
“Thank you, that’s very sweet of you – thank you for all of this.” Tony babbled, still more interested the fact that he was
might’ve been mad about. He’d known that he couldn’t talk to Tony about what happened without talking about any of that. That, if they did end up talking about those things, then Steve wouldn’t be able to lie about them, and it would make it sound like he wasn’t sorry, and they would only fight again… And, if Steve thought he’d been scared of that
Tony cried out, somewhere between a scream and a sob, as the pleasure swamped over him, wave after wave. He locked his legs tighter around Steve, rocking up to meet him, his nails digging into Steve’s skin. Tony’s whole body surrendered to it, letting it pulse through every muscle, rolling all the way up to his shoulders.
“You’re taking a huge risk, in helping us. The Adams have weapons, chemical weapons.” She told them, a hint of desperation bleeding through. “And I know I should do more to prepare you, more to
Trying not to stir that old injustice, because he knew that once he started thinking about it, he wouldn’t be able to stop-
it was, just to be there. To feel as though he was truly part of a human conversation, a real moment…
And then his ribs started to ache, and he had to think about this breathing, and the laugher began to ease off – out of physical necessity, at first…
“Yeah, I know,” Tony muttered, a prickle of resistance running up the back of his neck. Another remembered behaviour, probably. His ‘usual’ response to Rhodey’s endless attempts to help him.
“No, I… I just figured, it should never have been a letter,” Steve replied sadly. “It just made me think that I really should’ve called you, or… That there were things I should have said. Just that… I’m sorry, this was a really stupid way to start with all this. I’m…bad at this stuff…”
“...Okay, but isn’t that just hallucinating, though?” Steve pressed, squinting at the flower. Figaro sighed, and gestured with it,
Or when he’d worked out that a ‘dzhadazhiya’ might not actually be a word for a vampire hunter, or even a vampire fetishist… That it might simply mean someone with an interest in the lives or mythology of vampires, someone who sought them out purely to observe them and understand them and record what they found.
“You have this pool for a week,” Steve corrected… already thinking that there was a lot they could do, in a week-
“And, to clarify, it needn’t necessarily be a submissive/dominance thing” Janine went on. “For a lot of people it’s more of a giving/receiving thing, or simply a chance to indulge a niche interest, or try something new…”

“Thank you,” he muttered, pulling it over himself like a blanket. Telling himself that he’d put it on just as soon as the room stopped spinning. In the meantime, he let his eyes slip shut, and relaxed his shoulders, and let
And then Tony began kissing his way down Steve’s back, moving more quickly than he had before, his kisses sharper and more desperate.
And Tony began fucking him hard and fast, his thrusts more sharp and shallow – hitting that spot every time, sending shock after shock through him until it was all just one continuous rolling sensation. Steve’s mind whited out completely, his shouts dissolving into choked off moans as his entire body surrendered to the pleasure running through it. His cock pulsed angrily against his stomach, the stinging, burning need of it just adding to this onslaught of sensations.
wanted that. And that’s not going to happen. So, I guess I’ll just have to make my peace with it, and let it go, and think about what I
And then Bucky pushed himself up on his arms, ending up in the same legs-out position as Steve, already scanning the room with an increasing awareness…
He was semi-distracted from his thoughts when yet another pair of waiters shuffled by the table, one collecting the empty plates, the other handing out the next round. This time it was a range of tiny pastries, decorated with brightly coloured icing. Steve burned with hope that this would be the last course-
Just that was enough. A beacon of light in a sea of suffocating, bottomless darkness – Steve didn’t know
And then he felt Steve’s palm caress into his shoulder, before he ducked his head to press a soft kiss to Tony’s temple.
Tony could feel it pushing up under his skin – like Steve was literally fucking this pleasure into him, all these sensations building inside him, already beyond what should have been a breaking point-
Steve’s pleading whimpering grew tighter, the sound of it shivering up Tony’s spine. A low pleasure coiled in his hips as Steve started rutting sharply against his mouth, spiking with every move Steve made.
remember what they were. He remembered everything he’d ever worried about, all the toxic thoughts that had tortured him, all the insecurities he’d nursed and fears he’d run from – and he fucking
“I don’t know” Tony sat up straighter and shook his head, equally baffled. “I mean, either she being enslaved by other Varians, in which case why not just tell us? Or she’s one of the people doing the enslaving, and that
And then Tony put a shaky hand to Steve’s forearm, looking to steady himself – or, more likely, looking for purchase, still trying to work himself off.
And, as soon as the word occurred to him, it was so obvious. He recognised every part of this, from so many years ago… he just
After ten solid minutes of comprehensive background details, Tony actually stalled to an awkward halt, catching Steve’s eye in a wary challenge, almost
But Steve just couldn’t resist the appeal of sitting here in the sunlight on this beautiful, quiet afternoon, so close to Tony. It was so nice just to
And he probably would’ve picked a random direction and simply started walking, except that a familiar voice called out from right behind him - and Steve’s whole body froze.
Tony didn’t know much about the Tesseract, scientifically speaking. But he knew enough to immediately recognise the whole new level of
would’ve seen the point in keeping that secret, when you were the poster boy for the allies, and, I don’t know, maybe when the world wasn’t ready for it…” And he glanced up, looking at Steve through his eyelashes when he carried on, “but, maybe if you thought about it
“Oh, hey – didn’t expect to see you here,” he said, automatically. The breakroom was generally deserted after six in the evening, when everyone migrated up to the bar… Had they been waiting for him?
thought had cropped up again and again, since he left Tony’s house. Every time Steve considered another way he might’ve just fucked up, it came with that same lament,
He took another deep breath, which came much easier this time. He felt so much better for simply having a list.
what he wanted, how good it would feel, that he belonged to Tony and was supposed to belong to Tony and
now? But it’s like I don’t know them, like I keep forgetting to take them into account, or I don’t know how to… slot them in. I don’t know how to make sense of any of it… and that’s making me feel like I don’t really understand anything…”
“Because this way around is weird and uncomfortable?” Steve guessed. A laugh bubbled over Tony’s lips before he could stop it, more surprise than amusement, and he had to hastily drop his face into his hands.
At last, the revelation dawned on him… That this wasn’t the same man he’d lost in that bunker, and that this story didn’t have to end the same way, and that…
Steve was looking at him. The openness in his expression, the vulnerability of his optimism… That little hint of shyness, which seemed so touchingly ordinary, somehow. Tony felt like everything good about human beings was somewhere in that look. Everything he missed about them. And maybe Tony could ignore the sudden urge to reach out to it. After years of practice, Tony could’ve talked himself out of this reaction. He could’ve fought the temptation to say
Tony had stared at that scrap of notepaper for a full ten minutes before he could bring himself to write
His entire being burned with the effort of staying tense like this, to the point that he actually felt as though he was floating, disconnected from his own limbs.
Steve felt a little bit guilty acknowledging it, but it was true nonetheless: he quite liked it when Fury called the entire team together at the Tower.
He grimaced distastefully, as he thought back to the blood he drank just a few hours ago. A particularly bad batch, even by his minimal standards – watery and gritty and of hardly any use. And Tony knew that meant he should actually drink
They barely paused at the foot of Tony’s bed, their hands reaching for one another impatiently – instinctively. When Steve pulled him close again Tony was smiling too much to kiss him properly. He was getting increasingly high on this surge of happiness, more delighted by everything the more delighted he was. His movements were messy and demanding as he clawed Steve’s T-shirt over his head, impatient to feel Steve’s bare skin under his hands. And then he ran his eyes over Steve’s perfect broad shoulders, and the smooth expanse of his chest…
“Steve” Tony cut him off, his voice barely a whisper now, his eyes shining with a strength of feeling that Steve hadn’t seen since that bunker.
something - because it didn’t look as though he had much to protect. He didn’t seem to have a career that anyone could ruin, or any status that he was scared to give up, or any loved ones to worry over…
“Common misconception,” he smiled, enthusiastically. “This idea that, because you have a new way to do it, you stop the old way altogether. I mean,
… it was all just him trying to think of what he would do, if he didn’t feel like this. Having to go through every possible angle, reframe and rebrand everything, push things into the background, all because he couldn’t trust himself to just open that door and
“No, of course I’m going to go,” Steve muttered, lying flat out on the couch again. He promised himself that he was going to
“Oh, God, Steve…” he mewled, throwing his head back against the pillows as the pleasure of it rolled out through his shoulders. “Oh God Steve, I love you.”
He could feel it starting to wobble. The cascade of enlightenment that was going to come crashing down on him. The feeling that he finally understood what Bucky’s rant was really about, that he was going to find words for it in a minute, that it was going to be horrible...
Bucky felt the same spike of adrenaline as he might get on a battlefield. That specific feeling of hearing a twig snap, or seeing a shadow move… the instinctive awareness that something was about to happen, that there was something he
“And I can assure you that it has no long-term effects,” Jesse went on, in the same casual tone of voice.
scared of anyone finding out what had happened here. He wasn’t anxious about it, or guilty, or even confused.
“...You think that’s what would make Steve happy?” Bucky asked, trying to keep the scepticism out of his voice. “If you
Steve actually felt just a little bit shaky as he slid the back of the frame away, the glass panel at the front coming free along with the photograph. Steve turned his attention to the picture first, carefully setting the frame aside so that he could concentrate on placing the photo into his inside pocket – the one deep enough that he could be sure he wouldn’t crease it. And then he glanced up at Tony.
” Steve spat with such venom it hurt his throat, stalking another step closer, all but pinning Adam beneath him. “You’ve just stood there and
“...This is your house?” Steve repeated, brightly. He felt a little pang of happiness that he wasn’t sure he was entitled to… But he
“You didn’t,” Steve replied, trying to sound nonchalant – and failing. “You wanted to know what he’s like, so… he’s nice.” He admitted, awkwardly. “He’s smart. He seems pretty normal.”
Somewhere, the faint rustle of fabric caught Steve’s attention, and he lifted his head in time to see Tony pulling a little black tube from his pocket-
He looked up at Steve again, his eyes wide and shining and impossibly deep, his lips slightly parted, his fingers curling apprehensively around Steve’s hand…
And Tony found himself just having to respond to each question as it came, focusing on whatever thoughts happened to crop up.
“…Yeah,” he nodded, more openly impressed now. Tony focussed his attention on the joint at Barnes’ shoulder. And he wondered…
That’s why he was so keen to explain himself – to reshape this narrative, for himself as much as for them.
Steve’s shoulders slumped with relief, a pleasant giddiness floating though his head as it hit him. The last of his daytime thoughts abandoned him completely, along with all the guilt and doubt and anger. That change in him was complete, and the only words left in his head were,
afterthought – Steve picked the empty frame up again, to put the various pieces into their proper places.
And then Tony shook his head, and shuffled close enough to put a hand on Steve’s knee when he promised him,
“Drink?” Tony asked, an edge of humour on his voice. Steve managed a joyless smile. He pointedly did not watch Tony walk over to the bar. Instead, he took an
He fixed Steve with a deliberate stare, running his thumb along Steve’s hairline as he smiled. Steve simply let it make him feel better.
All those years he’d spend dreaming of doting on Steve, thinking up ways to be nice to him, wishing he could take that pain away… He’d forgotten all that, since Siberia. But it had seemed so natural at one time, to respond to all the good in Steve with kindness and affection, to have fantasies that were uncompromised and without caveats and… just…
He glanced down at the table, smirking at himself when he realised that he’d drawn two perfectly symmetrical hearts into the dust.
“Mall cops…” He murmured to himself, trying to take some reassurance in it. He finally braved a step out into the open, and took a good look around. And then he turned to Bucky-
Tony had never given the slightest impression that he’d been a fan of Captain America, or a critic, or...anything at all, for himself. He’d only ever mentioned his
It was so brief, blinked away before Steve even realised he’d seen it - but he knew he had. For just a moment, Tony had actually looked
He got out of the car before Sam had the chance to answer him, not sure whether he’d really heard a sad sigh in reply or if he’d just imagined it. After that it was simply a matter of following his feet, wandering mindlessly towards the little bubble of activity at the centre of the yard.
he couldn’t eat and had barely slept and had difficulty sitting still. He’d just considered it as even more time to spend on his project, and focused
Steve couldn’t tell whether he hated himself for being this stubborn, or if he hated himself for even considering a compromise…
He leant over the basin, a cold sweat breaking out on his forehead as he willed himself not to be sick. Hand shaking, he reached out and turned the tap on full blast, washing the blood away. Trying to focus on the smell of fresh water and the sharp flecks of the spray on his face.
“You know, a great many people have sacrificed all they had to give, to possess what you are so readily giving up,” he observed.
think of…all that, as one mistake, at one point. Or, I don’t know, I hadn’t unpacked it at all, I’d just… assumed the guilt for it, like a Captain going down with his ship, never
“Gee, I don’t know Tony, maybe it’s because everyone I ever knew in the world is dead. Or maybe I’m still stuck on that horrific plane crash I was just in, right before I spent hours slowly freezing to death. Or maybe it was waking up on an alien fucking planet where I can’t understand what anyone is saying and I don’t know how anything works and I literally don’t know a single fucking person. Or are you only interested if it’s something to do with you?”
“Hey,” Tony said again – and this time Steve was just about able to raise his head, to find that Tony was standing right there next to his side of the bed. Steve began some pointless attempt to shuffle over, to give Tony more room-
comfort was the spiteful joy he felt at knowing something they didn’t know. Being so sure that Tony had already removed that component – and that ‘the company’ had no idea. Thinking of Stape being so very confident that he could remotely disable Bucky’s arm. Imagining the moment that he realised he couldn’t.
Tony had to break the kiss to gasp for air, his fingers still curled into the fabric of Steve’s jacket.
When he glanced up again he saw that Rhodey had fixed him with a more serious expression, clearly having realised that there was more to Tony’s mood than whatever was in the water.

Even though it wasn’t his fault that he was running late, even though he had already messaged to say that his previous meeting had over run, even though Maria Hill had already sent a cheerful ‘no worries’ in response-
