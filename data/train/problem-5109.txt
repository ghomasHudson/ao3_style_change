He was still itching to punch him. But Tony wasn’t like Rogers who acted exactly like A LITTLE BRAT. A BRAT WHO DISHED OUT INSULTS BUT QUICKLY RESORTED TO FIGHTING WHEN TONY CAME UP WITH HIS WAY BETTER COMEBACKS. COMEBACKS THAT WAS FULL OF brains and truth, unlike Rogers who only brought bad comebacks and idiotic, cocky remarks to the table. Besides, if he wore the suit he couldn’t get his-Steve-breaking-his bone-evidence-souvenir.
It was dark. In the dark, there was peace. He sought refuge in it. Release from the fear and pain. His pulse dwindled. The darkness pushed in around him. There was an ease in slipped away-gave into the unfamiliar calm.
He used the power surge to launched repulsor blasts from both his arms and chest-plate, sending the blond alien flying.
By the end of the day, Rogers would hate him so much he wouldn’t even look at him let alone admit to any kind of soul-bond then Tony would be FREE to happily continue with Pepper.
Tony had stopped looking at him like he was the brunt of the joke, but the silence plagued them was brittle. The plane ride seemed so long, even though Steve’s logic told him it hadn’t been that long. He couldn’t stand it anymore “I don't like it." Steve hissed under his breath to get rid of the brittle silence period.
For several seconds Maria didn’t comprehend– three long seconds during which Maria just stood there, staring at the picture of her soulmate cheating with his secretary. Deep down she had suspected that Howard had an affair with he seemed to lose all interest in sex with her lately, but she had glossed over that, she didn’t want to believe that Howard would do this to her. God knew his workaholic and the alcoholic tendency was bad enough! How could Howard do this to her!
That earned him a glance and an eyebrow raise. “I don’t like it.” Steve repeated, casting a look at their prisoner. Loki had been tied up and cuffed to his seat
"Cap, need a lever!" rang in Steve’s ear. Steve panted, looking over at the engine and back to the guys he was trying to fight against and staying holding onto the wire cable he was hanging from.
Anthony didn’t let him finish, he had enough of debating this in his mind. He wanted both of them, together, wrap in ecstasy. His body grew warmer, slicking up for Steven.
It took every ounce of self-control Anthony had to ease back. His pulse roared in his ears; beat like dragonfly wings.
Thor shook his head, dismissing Loki's speech. "You would take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights?”
Millimeter by millimeter, Tony’s head emerged, little eyes and chubby cheeks and tiny ears and scrunched nose and pouty lips and as his chin passed. Maria stopped her herculean effort and heaved several breaths, eyes going wide, “Holy shit!” The pain flared up and she wanted to run away although she’s trapped in the moment.
As far as the Omega boy was concerned, well at least they would be able to make sure he’ll marry well one day so it’s not a total lost cause.
A broken gaze from Steve, and truly, something in the gaze froze Tony to the core. It spoke of a pain so deep, so stark. He wondered if he had gone too far, being too cruel.
Steve swallowed. No, he didn’t want that, would never want that. He had seen so many died in the war… to ever wish that. His purpose as a soldier? Should he hide behind the stars and stripe uniform and cling to the last thing he had that's familiar, the last thing he had that's close to home - how to be a soldier, how to obey orders… will that be easier or worse? In the military, he at least wasn’t a fish out of the water, but there were still many changes, he didn’t know how to use current weapon or technology… he wanted to resist it… he wasn’t ready, he didn’t know if he would ever be ready!
The gentleman held his gaze from the opposite side of the room, sipped his drink lazily. He was captured by, trapped by, a pair of large, well-set, heavy-lidded eyes the color of some faraway ocean. Those eyes held him entranced; the expression not in them so much as behind them spoke of shrewdness, assessment, and cool, clear-headed cynicism.
Bruce looked up at him past all the running programs. "But you can control it." He couldn't stop the bitterness and jealousy in his voice.
It not like Rogers was wrong. The weapons he created to protect American soldiers and help them defend their country had been used to ruin lives reduced untold millions of innocents into blood spattered on the ground. He had to do something to wash away all the blood in his hand! Simply balancing it with saving people wasn’t enough, nothing would ever be enough! He needed to keep saving more, more and more people until his last breath. It was the only way he could live with himself, was that so wrong?!
Leaving things like this was not a good idea but Tony convinced himself he had to. The doors clicked in place behind him.
Then there were the soul-mates who weren't happy but stay together anyway, clung to the idea of the ideal relationship and what society expected of them. That was the situation his mom-Maria stark- was in, she was trapped in a never-ending cycle of misery, waiting, still waiting for her soul-mate to make her life perfect again, and grew increasingly bitter, resentful and withdrawn the longer the ideal eluded her. Tony promised himself, he would never let himself be that pitiful.
Casting a short glanced at Rogers, Tony was more relieved than he wanted to admit that the Super-Soldier wasn’t buying into it about as much as he enjoyed went back to his parent’s home for a holiday.
Thinking about dreams… brought back the memory of his first dream, of Steve calling his name sweetly, his eyes full of love and adoration. ‘SHIT! NO, don’t go there, never go there!’
Steve could feel the one eye glare burned into him as he continued jabbing the punching back, each pound harder than the last. No amount of refusal seemed to deter Shield from trying to enlist him and since the Tesseract was stolen, they grew even more determined. It was freaking annoying!
Pepper rolled to her side. Her whole body facing him. Her hand found him and laced their fingers together.
This guy was a joke! Sure he was muscled and very handsome, but Tony Stark could easily find better-looking men if he wanted to... Hell, he used to date supermodels and famous starlets. Of course, none of them could ever compare to Pepper who had it all; beauty, brain, passion, compassion, and patience… lot of it. Rogers was Underwhelming indeed!
Pepper knew exactly how he wanted the company to run. He trusted her with his company and his heart. Not an easy feat for him.
Tony gazed blankly at the dried and brownish blood stain left by Phil's body for a long moment. He couldn’t help but think of Steve’s words.
Tony was halfway out of his battered armor when the door swished open. He looked up, not entirely surprised to find the blond there. Alpha tended to get overprotective and Tony nearly got shredded.
Steve didn’t let his smile falter. He kind of expected Tony to went all professional like this. A flame of hope had been kindled in Steve after he heard about Tony and Pepper break up and he could not bring himself to blow it out. “Thanks.” One step at a time, he would wait for Tony his whole life if he needed to.
Nick Fury continued. “We're dead in the air up here. Our communications, the location of the Cube, Banner, Thor... I got nothing for you.”
Such mighty punch for a slender man but Steve quickly got back up. He hurled his shield at Loki who simply bated the shield aside before dodged Steve's first punch then countering with his staff as it cut across the air.
Even if Steven didn't notice it, he was goddamn attractive. It was like being alone in a room staring at a highly expensive bottle of wine. Anthony’s gaze caressed Steven’s body the way he imagined his hands would do. Anthony’s nipples tingled. His hips curled under and an ache began between his thigh and growing steadily harder until he let out a groan that could have been due to agony, ecstasy or both.
Through the bond, the force of emotion flowed between them like an impossible two-way river, sheered and untrammeled joy sang in their blood and bones.
“Master Antony, are you okay?’’ he heard Jarvis’ voice coming closer. The butler helped him up. “Ma’am I think you had drunk too much.” There was a hard edge to Jarvis’ voice.
Ecstasy soon evolved into horror as he realized that something was very wrong with the way Tony plummeted towards the ground, he was not slowing down. He must be unconscious or otherwise unable to stop.
As a natural leader Alpha can channel their cunning and natural leadership either to lead and protect like Steve and Thor or to control and used like Obie and Howard.
Nearing the lab, he stopped at the sight of the Billionaire Tony Stark and Doctor Banner interaction. Tony had exchanged his expensive suit for a pair of old jeans and a faded Black Sabbath shirt.
At the age of 16, he could feel nothing but hatred in Howard’s eyes every time he fixed his father’s mistakes or improved his father’s work. That was when he was forced to face the fact that he would never win his father’s love. Hell, he would never amount to anything to Howard other than a cash cow and being his punching bag. And God did it hurt! To Howard, he was just something to be manipulated and gained from.
That night, she let Howard brought her to bed. He transported her into a realm of hot delight and ecstasy. He drove into her deep and true, she clung to his body and they fell into a rhythm as timeless as the beat of their heart. It was a night she would remember her whole life. Being with Howard Stark was unlike anything she'd ever experienced. Her attraction to him was absolute, and she realized that her desire for him was inexhaustible.
Iron Man flinched and stumbled back, as the bolts hit his chest plate and engulfing his upper torso in a case of light and heat and crackling electricity strong enough to damage the suit.
He inhaled sharply as if it was his first breath in days. This wasn’t the time for personal issue, right now he had to push emotions aside. Forcing his mind back to the scene taking place below him, he saw Loki tossed Steve a good ten feet. Steve fell and hit his head hard, Iron Man decided to take the so called god’s attention away from the soldier.
Maria either didn’t hear or didn’t care because she’s pushing again, “Come on!” she shouted, vocalizing her discomfort throughout the push. Grunting turned to keening as Tony’s shoulders started to emerge. “Please get him,” Maria begged and shifted her hips, widening them as much as she could before pushing.
Note: Steve never saw the footage, he let Tony think he did to spite him which totally backfire on him. If Steve had known what was in the footage he would never do it, he would have respected Tony for resisting torture and defeat his adversary.
Bruce ran a gamma-ray detection scanner on the scepter for radiation, safe in Tony's lab and under the surveillance of Stark and himself. Bruce looked over at Tony. "The Gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports of the tesseract. But it's going to take weeks to process." He commented, frowning lightly.
"Stark Tower?" Rogers asked, obviously still haven't managed to follow Bruce's logic. Seriously, Fury wanted this guy to lead them?!
The morning after Steve returned from his trip, the blond got a message from Natasha told him Tony and Pepper’s relationship was over and the rest of the team had moved into the now Avengers Tower.
Pepper smiled encouragingly. Tony had been distant since the battle of New York. She had waited for him to open up about it.
“No. You're a Beta, Mr. Fury; you... don’t understand. I'm the ultimate Alpha. All my drives were to protect and defend everything I love and now they were gone." He had nothing to do and no one left to see or protect. He had only pain and nightmares; he wouldn't ever find the home he knew ever again. Steve already considered offing himself, twice, three times but he couldn’t. His religion, his beliefs and… something else… something he couldn’t put his finger on was holding him back...
“I once thought you were different. I believed that good old Captain America cared about who people were, not what they were. But hey, a 1940 Alpha’s a 1940 Alpha.” His voice was colder than the winter’s ice.
Happy had asked Tony permission in courting Pepper. Even though he was a bit bitter, he would rather lose Pepper to a man like Happy knowing he would take care of Pepper and gave her the undivided love and attention that Tony failed to give Pepper. Just seeing the smile on Pepper’s face was enough.
“But you know what; you didn’t deserve the title Captain America or the best superhero ever. You weren’t 1/20 of the man I once believed you were! I knew men that don’t have the serum but was ten times the person you were!” Tony spat acidly. “You openly call other’s ethics and morality out as a sham when you couldn’t even see your flaw! ” a real hero would never agree with Shield keeping a video that could ruin all his effort for a much better world let alone rubbed it all over his face!
Steve heard his heartbeat beat ninety miles an hour. Tony had been looking at Steve too long, but then the Alpha had been looking back, and he felt they both tried to say something the others couldn’t hear. Too long and now even longer, his heart even louder, Steve’s tranquil eyes swallowed him whole.
Captain America looked around, at the debris, and his expression shifted to stunned, as he realized… “We won.” He grinned like a fool.
Thor however only had his eyes on his brother-whose eyes widened in fear at the sight of the Thunderer and made a sound of distress. Thor’s face was so calm it scared the Trickster; no doubt it was the calm before the storm.
But it was neither his willowy figure nor his stunning face that left him breathless and stupid. It was Tony’s soul. It shone in his brown eyes like sunlight on diamonds, gleamed on the very glow of his butternut skin.
Tony startled awake from his slumber. The first thing he noticed was the soft body against his that female curve and lavender smell. Oh right, Pepper! It felt like a bucket of icy water thrown to his face, pulling him cruelly out of his soul-dream daze. The second thing he noticed was cum between his legs. “Shit.” He muttered.
Deep down she had suspected that Howard had an affair with he had lose all interest in sex with her lately, but she had glossed over that, she didn’t want to believe that Howard would do this to her. God knew his workaholic and the alcoholic tendency was bad enough! How could Howard did this to her?!
But the fight was far from over. Loki tried to strangle Steve from the back before spinning him off again for another meeting with the concrete. He fell and his head hit the pavement hard, bringing stars to his eyes, and his teeth gritting in pain.
Steve had gone right through the core of it, surely as though he had sliced Tony open and laid a finger to his beating heart. The brunet could feel his anger rose now, liquid and hot in his chest.
Part of Tony couldn't help but be disappointed at discovering his childhood hero was nothing more than a brainless SHIELD stooge with no ability to think outside his little military box. Another part of him was relief that Howard was SO wrong about Steve that this made it so easy to push him away.
That night he had a dream… which felt, unlike his usual dream. It felt so familiar… His thoughts were cut short when he realized that he was naked and in bed with another man.
At that moment, Bruce who was looking at the monitor noticed something about the Tesseract. It was right next to the Hellicarier.
“Of course, you did.” Steve said, voice devoid of emotion despite the dark color in his eyes. “That was why you kissed me like that.” He netted, angry that Tony shook off the kiss like a canine shook off the rain while Steve had continued to shiver even now.
With his back turn to the Director, he didn’t see the wide-eyed expression at Steve’s exclamation about Howard being his soul-mate. After Captain Rogers's inquiry about Howard Stark in Times Square, Fury had his suspicion. SHIELD had gathered enough data. They found old pictures, the way they looked at each other especially Rogers implied the two were more than friends… but soulmate… that’s impossible… Maria…. Unless….
Anyway, Steve and Tony weren’t just soul-mate they were Twin-flame soul-mates. Twin-flame were really rare, and they had spent many past reincarnations together. It was said that you could have a few soulmates, but only one twin flame. Twin-flame soulmate totally knocked regular soul-mate off the board. The dreams Tony had been his past life memories
Steve’s heart sunk, how could this be his soul-mate?! It seemed like Tony had inherited all Howard’s bad habit and blew it out of the water.
“I'm SORRY…” Roger’s tone mocking “wasn't EVERYTHING?” he demanded mockingly. He stepped closer to Tony, into his space, sucked all the air out of the room. Steve felt strangely satisfied at the thought he had all the smaller man's attention. So close, Steve felt drunk on the slithering smell emitting like sound waves over him. Every cell in Steve's body cried out to move closer, as though he wouldn't be satisfied until his lips met Tony's.
Steve had watched the exchange, his frustration building. "Are you nuts?!" He shot Tony a furious glare. It frightened and angered him that Tony endangered everyone but even more so that his soulmate had fewer self-preservation instincts than a moth!
Steve could smelt Tony even before his sudden entrance. Tony's presence was like a lodestone magnetizing all his blood, drawing his soul toward him. Tony looked dashing, Steve’s heartbeat erratic. He got up out of his chair. His eyes followed Tony as he strolled into the room like he owns the place in his ironed and neat suit.
It shouldn’t burn him this much, especially after how he treated Rogers. But when did common sense and emotion ever really mix, especially for a Stark?
Thor kept his hands clenched in Loki's robes as they flew to a rocky outcrop, slamming the raven-haired man to the ground as they landed in the dust. Loki groaned, laughing softly as he sat up on his elbows.
Tony was aware of being knocked to the ground and something… someone else shielding him protectively. He didn’t have to look to know it was Rogers.
Fury circled the table toward Captain America. “Yes. We were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract.” he said and felt Stark’s eyes at him. “I never put all my chips on that number, though, because I was playing something even riskier.” he paused to let it sink in. Steve finally looked up at him. He could see the well-guarded sadness in Fury’s eyes and some of his anger at the Director drained away.
God, it was far worse than it had been before. It used to be just dreams of Rogers calling his name, cuddling, or caressing and chastely kissing him. This… this… had got to stop… it felt like he was being unfaithful to Pepper. He made love with her, yet dreamt of another man. A man, that a voice kept telling him, was Rogers only it wasn’t. There were muscles and height differences! And the other guy wasn’t Tony either!
The blond hit the ground hard, sand spewing to the air. Thor stumbled over several times before staggered to his feet. Tony raised his faceplate.
Rogers wasn’t better than him. The man was an excellent fighter he would give him that much, but from where Ironman was standing, Captain America was very underwhelming. Why cared if Super soldiers were like a drop of water in the middle of the desert when his power-set had him totally outclassed by most super-heroes and super-villains? Captain America was an excellent fighter with a low level of superhuman strength, senses, healing ability, immunity to poison, stamina, speed, and an obsolete vibranium shield, but not much else.
Another thump, a giant man with long wind-blown blond hair and holding a hammer landed onto the opening hatch and stormed inside. Tony quickly recognized him from the archives SHIELD had shown him. Loki’s brother, Thor was also known as the god of thunder and strength of Norse mythology.
“You called that a great man! 30 out of 1600 children who were irradiated while they were in their mother’s womb during that explosion suffered clinically severe mental retardation. Children born to mothers who received whole-body radiation doses of between 50 and 100 radiuses following the bombing had an increased risk for small brain size and mental retardation. Some estimates state up to 200,000 had died by 1950, due to cancer and other long-term effects. From 1950 to 1990, roughly 9% of cancer and leukemia deaths among bomb survivors were due to radiation from the bomb.” he paused to let it sunk in.
It was so brief. Tony almost missed the moment where an expression open and terrible like a fresh wound took its place on Roger’s face. The expression vanished making way to love and acceptance he could never dream to be directed at him and that made him feel even lower than dirt. “I understand, Mr. Stark.”
In a rush, the baby came into the world, smeared in blood and fluids. The doctor caught Tony with expert hands and he’s all floppy limbs for a moment before he started wailing and trashing his arms like he’s fighting her.
"Well, I think it was meant for you." Bruce said, pointed at Tony, who looked out of the window towards where Loki was caged. Tony offered him his bag of freeze-dried blueberries, which he accepted. "Even if Barton didn't tell Loki about the Tower, it was still all over the news." Bruce continued. Steve listened, tried to understand how it was connected.
Tony startled awake on a single bed. He took a moment to realize he was in his lab. Damn it, this was why he tried to stay awake as long as possible! The moment he fell asleep he dreamt of ‘his past life romance.’
Unfortunately for Thor, JARVIS’s synthetic voice spoke out and Tony found out that the lightning had powered up his suit up to 400%. “Well, would you look at that.” Tony was proud of his work.
Anthony Edward Stark, 30 years old. ‘Only four years older than me… biologically’. He worked as a consultant to SHIELD for free and operated in a suit of armor called Iron Man. Despite the name, the suit was a high-tech prosthesis made of gold-titanium.
“Stop crying!” Howard yelled. “All I did was broke your stupid little toy car.” He said meanly. “Did you made this stupid thing?!” He said with distaste, holding the car in his hand. “You called yourself a Stark!” he threw the car at Tony’s arm which would surely bruise. “I tell you to stop crying, you pathetic Omega! Why couldn’t you be strong like an Alpha!”
A moment later, Tony could hear Hill's voice reporting through Steve's comm that engine three's turbine was out and somebody's got to get inside the engine and patch it, if one more engine went out, they'd be in free-fall.
Anthony dropped his forehead against Steven’s. Their breathing melded, hard and heavy. Both of them had lost a few buttons.
As if being splashed by boiling water, Tony startled out of his reverie and jerked away from him. Their perfect moment melted away in the face of Tony’s rejection and Steve’s heart ached for it.
Hill looked distinctly more irritated than before. Suppressing a huff, Tony moved the conversation back to its original topic.
The Iron man coolly, studying and assessing Captain America's body, mentally dissecting him and dismissing him all at the same time.
There was still something amiss… The thing kept crawling in his brain and he tried to grasp it… If the palladium core in the arc reactor was poisoning Tony, shouldn’t overuse of the Iron Man armor only worsened his condition and quickened his impending painful death. Yet, Tony continued donning the armor to save people. That was amazing! But it still felt like something was amiss… He felt a dreadful feeling inside… he decided to let it lay.
“Is not this simpler?” Loki's voice was now powerful and crystal clear as the crowd had gone completely quiet
Tony grunted when Steve's fist connected with his face. Wiping the blood away, with the palm of his hand. The guy’s punch barely touched his skin, and Tony felt his hackles rise, Rogers should have been angrier than this!
Tony rubbed his forehead, for a moment, blinked rapidly as the buzzing in his head intensified. The genius began to realize that something was wrong.
Seconds later, ‘Shoot to Thrill’ blasted out of her speakers and filled the jet’s cabin and drowning out the voices below.
One of the areas in which Steve's abilities were enhanced was his sharp hearing. But even he was unsure whether he was only imagining that Tony murmured "I am so sorry." as he walked away from the door.
A bright flash in the sky quickly caught his sight. His heart thudded as a comet— no! A man. A man in a suit of armor. His soul-mate!
“Close it." He heard the brisk and resign order from Clint. His heart stuck in his heart, refused to beat as Natasha thrust the scepter into the machine's center, the fiery glow above her brightening as it drew nearer to the portal.
"No surprises." As he spoke he reached out to jab Bruce playfully on the side. Bruce yelped in pain, frowned and jerked back slightly away from Tony, but there was no sign of any green in them.
What made the arrogant bastard thought he had any right to judge who was worthy or not because he had a clean slate or because he was a national icon?!
“KNEEL!” Loki screamed menacingly on top of his lung, intimidated the crowd into silence as they all kneeled before him, eyes widen in fear.
This couldn’t be real. Yet it was too much to be a simple coincidence. The more he looked at the painting, the more he couldn’t deny the truth. And as much as he wanted to destroy the paintings, he found he couldn’t part with it.
Part of Tony arching to prove Howard was wrong about Captain fucking perfect, that Rogers was just as pig-headed as most male alpha Tony had the displeasure of knowing- blinded by ego, sexist, controlling and treated and Omega like a possession instead of a living, breathing person.
Maria called him early in the morning, less than six hours after she'd left. His annoyance at the caller turned to overjoy when he saw who calling. They spend every minute possible together.  Howard held her hand, opened doors and pulled out chairs for her. He told her he appreciated that she made an effort to look good for him.
"Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny." Steve clarified, hoping to get through to Tony, probably to no avail as always.
Anthony imagined what will happen after this sitting over, Steven’s hands smudged with dark powder all over his body, caressed the flesh on the inside of his thigh. He had never imagined he could achieve so much foreplay by sat still. It was driving him out of his skin.
As if reading his mind, Anthony answered “I’m single and hasn’t the slightest interest in marriage. But you must already know that. I’m rather famous around here.” a dry smile. He waited as if gauging Steven’s reaction “I prefer focusing on my career over just being breed and raising kids.” Anthony’s lips thinned at that like he couldn’t fathom the idea. “I can’t even imagine myself doing that.”
Rogers looked down at Tony with anger and contempt spread thick across his features. His teeth bared and his shoulders straight. That deceptively slender body appeared broad and intimidating, his costume strained over the hidden strength which had suddenly come to the fore.
Lips curved into a smile before Steven reduced the distance between him and the gentleman. He could smell the alluring, sweet smell of a high-level Omega. With how sought after male Omega was he was lucky this wonderful creature was still single.
He wasn’t living anymore, he was just following a routine. He felt like a prisoner. Spending time with his wife felt like an obligation. There was no feeling behind it anymore.
Nick staring was interrupted by a loud sound. He lifted his gaze and saw a Quinjet took off following by the announcement of unauthorized departure from bay 6.
If the file and video were true, which he hoped with his whole being it wasn’t, then Tony Stark was everything Steve loathed. He even endangered other people at his birthday party and kicked Lieutenant Col. Rhodes around the house for trying to stop him over two years ago. Col. Rhodes was said to be his best friend and had endangered his job to vouch for him in court and had looked for him even after three months during his kidnap in Afghanistan.
‘It was a nice smell but not nearly as nice as Steve’s pheromone.’ Tony unconsciously thought. He winced internally. This scent used to lull him to sleep, but now it a reminder of the hole in his life… the hole that shouldn’t be there. What had the soul-bond done to him? His life and relationship had been altered.
It was a pain worse than when Obadiah had ripped the arc reactor out. Fury's words kept reverberating in Tony's mind going on and on about Coulson's belief in the Avengers Initiative. He remembered Phil's words “We do need you, Mr. Stark.” How he had been against Tony's exclusion from the team. Another man who believed in him was dead.
"Well, it's an old-fashioned notion." Fury said watching Captain America trailed after Stark, a worried look on his face. If the director didn’t know better he would say the Captain went after Ironman like a puppy. It was something to worry about when this was all over.
"Well, you're not wrong." Tony smiled wryly before getting down to business and blasting large chunks of burnt debris off the turbine with his hand weapons when he couldn't budge it.
He is not letting himself love Steve yet. In his opinion TOny Stark is a different man than Anthony Reeves. He isn't the man that Steve dream of him. He think he is not as beautiful, confident and whole like ANthony is. But he is letting Pepper down gently and let Steve into Avenger Tower because to him his duty as Iron Man and avenger come first.
Senses spun as Anthony focused entirely on their kiss. The pleasure built, whipped through Anthony, around him, spiraled through his senses as he melted into his lover.
Bruce tried to bring the situation away from another pissing contest, directed his comments to the captain.
Soon his mind was flooding with information: Not only Tony was a rare type of very high-level Omega, but he was also a Dominant type Omega. Steve’s mind went to Peggy the toughest, Dominant Omega he had ever met.
The whole room was fraught with the kind of tension that gave Bruce a feeling that sooner or later; someone would throw the first punch. His whole body thrummed, ready to snap, stirred the other guy up, so he stayed close to the window in case he needed to jump off.
Pepper’s face crumpled in misery. She looked away to hide her pain as she tried to come to terms with the news. “When? With whom?”
And of course, there was the fact that every time he was around Steve he had to fight this insane urge to reach out and touch him. He knew Steve was having the same problem because he'd caught him reaching for Tony a couple of times, only to pull his hand back like he'd been burned and look apologetic.
While doing super-heroism, such uniform would make it difficult for camouflage-shut up J-he could use bright red armor because he was awesome and didn’t need camouflaging. Beside Tony painted the armor bright fucking red so it screamed ‘here shoot at me not the innocent people around me.’ After all, if the villain busy shooting at him more innocent would survive. Rogers on the other hand just wanted to show-off!!
"I’m sorry.” Steve’s voice tight with sadness, looked down. “I wish I'd known him better. He seems like a good man.” He said in a small voice.
"Uh, thanks?" Bruce took the hand nervously but gave it a firm shake. To his surprise, he felt Stark's pulse calm and collected under his hand. Stark didn't know about the Other Guy, there was no way anyone wasn't afraid of the Hulk. Steve was thinking the same thing.
Looking at himself in the mirror, his eyes fierce, he said, “I will not-I repeat-I will not make the same mistakes my parents did. I will not waste my life over some national icon, and I will not let stupid bond rules over my life! I am strong, much stronger than a stupid bond!” He was too old and too smart to get beaten by the like of this.
Tony was lying, he had to be, there’s no way Howard would ever go that far. If what Tony said was true, the casualties were too great to quantify in any scale. Steve felt ill. “You… you were lying! Howard woul….”
Steve Rogers said “Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a Hydra weapon.”
Tony is very happy with his relationship with Pepper when Captain America appear and along with it many emotional baggage he had bury inside
Never looked down on Omega, some of them can be more cunning and ruthless and more fiercely competitive than an Alpha since well, the world is harsher on them. Natasha used his sex (very high-level Omega) as a weapon to help her on her spy, Tony also used it to get more people to donate to his charity foundation so it not without upside.
That was… the most beautiful words anyone ever said to him. Before he realized it, he was kissing Steven like a magnet springing to steel, irresistible and natural as the tide. Their tongues met and mated in a dance. As deep as bones, as ingrained as blood, as essential as breath- all needs and all desires were ultimately only one. Steven the romantic and gentle soul who was the center of his world. He was the lover Anthony thought he never deserved.
It was obvious to Steve that his reckless soulmate wouldn’t wait for him to gather the remaining Avengers members and would blasted off after he fixed his suit. And there was the deja-vu feeling again, exactly how many times in their-shared-lifetimes Tony did something reckless like this. He needed to do something with his soulmate lone gunslinger habit.
“Tony.” He whispered Tony’s name like a forbidden spell cast to forged love upon someone's heart. “P-please, I-I love you.”
Moonlight gleamed on Steven’s face as he turned around. Anthony’s throat went dry. He was so fucking handsome, it hurts.
Steven growled with animalistic zeal and drove into him. The sensation echoed, a feeling like penetrating and being penetrated at once, and both of them moaned. Steven rolled his hips. Every point of contact between them was exploded with sensation. The heat of Steven’s pleasure buzzed through Anthony and set his veins on fire. His bare chest was hot against Steven’s bare chest. How the hell they became bare. He didn’t know. He didn’t care. He couldn’t think. Grasped his hair in both hands, he arched against him, taking him, squeezed around him.
After Howard, he had vowed to make himself into a Dom so strong, he would never kneel to anyone again. He would make Alphas knelt to him. Never again would he walk around holding his breath to keep himself from slipping up and let his anger out to preserve a relationship already long dead. Nor will he ever bend over backward to earn anything from an Alpha ever again and that included Rogers.
His protest was cut off by Roger's mouth on his, kissed him like a man dying of thirst would kiss a river, tried to drink it dry, wild and greedy and almost angry. One large hand speared into the brunet's hair and held him to the kiss, held him captive while Roger's lips crushed his in urgent need, ravenous hunger.
The real reason Howard, his father gave him so much pain was never because he wasn’t good enough. It was because he knew his son who was from the lowest caste, an Omega, would outshine his skill at a young age and he absolutely hated it. Hated it so much that he taught a child that physical blows hurt but words could wound for a lifetime and shown him how much he didn’t deserve to be loved all before Tony reached kindergartens.
Steve couldn't contain the breathy laugh that escaped him at his soulmate’s ridiculousness. Thor and Hulk looked at the man in the iron suit with a look of disbelief. Tony almost died, and he came out laughing and joking around.
To Tony Bruce wasn't a monster just a man, a genius man with the unique ability to turn into something much stronger. He was testing his boundary to figure out how Bruce worked and how in touch he was with the Hulk side of himself. It felt teasing and childish but so utterly human and he couldn't remember ever got to enjoy this with anyone since the Other Guy showed.
The journey back to the Shield base passed in a blur. Shock seeped through Steve’s body like an anaesthetic; dulling the pain, fuzzing the edges.
“Hell, your father flew into enemy territory at night in a private plane to save soldiers he didn’t even know. You said you didn’t want a relic, you knew what he may be dead, but I would rather be his soul-mate than yours cause dead or alive, he was a far better man than you were!” Steve got into Tony’s face, wanted to see the hurt flash in Tony’s brown eyes, needed to see something of what he was feeling reflected there.
This was the man his father kept yapping about until his ears hurt from hearing all about Captain America and his ‘perfectness’ that he had wanted to punch something.
When he looked at the cupboards, he saw some clothes in the closet and a toolbox that he could use when he wanted to fix up his bike. It seemed altogether a room he would be happy to live in. It felt like... like someone who'd known him had picked it out.
Tony felt slightly guilty for dragging him into their argument when he saw the 'who, me?' face Bruce was wearing.
Their eyes held for a moment and a flurry of ripe unguarded expectation spur into the air, Hotspur and graphics. Recovering his composure Steven replied. “I-I’m a painter,” he stuttered.
But what was the alternative? Wait until the world burned along with him…. Or spend the rest of his life which was…? Fifty… sixty… seventy years… mourning his loss and watching punching bags split under his fists while the world keeps buzzing on overhead, growing and changing, spinning as if he wasn't there, as if his presence was inconsequential… Wasn’t that even more painful… then being out there fighting in the battlefield then perish honorably, a beautiful death… just like it should have been…
There it was: the something that had frightened Iron Man before. It was possessive and bright and positively overwhelming in its simple dedicated intensity. Steve was prepared to move mountains to be with him. He could feel part of him responding to that passionate possessiveness with anticipation. A bigger, more rational part of him wanted that spark to burst into flame. It was too intense, too fast, undeserving!
Like typhoon Howard swept her off her feet and they got married in a week of knowing each other. Hundreds of greedy Omegas and betas wept into their martinis as Maria Collins Carbonell, Italian model married their dream man.
Machine gun rounds erupted around him. He blinked in the spray of debris, lost the upper hand in his fight and slipped off the railing he was holding onto. Almost falling, he flipped back around and grabbed a thick power cord at the last minute.
The thing amiss that Steve couldn’t grab or better yet not want to grab is Tony doesn’t want to meet him…haven’t tried to meet him in the last two months of his wakening up…Tony should have known stark industry fund the expedition to find Steve…and even if in it didn’t they are both invited to join the Avengers
And it killed him every time watching Howard, his friends, his neighbors going away, dying, one by one. He could barely contain the bone-deep despair for failing to die when everyone he loves had done so that his whole body was shaking uncontrollably, and his face was wet with tears. Was it really worth it? Saving the world at the cost of everything he knew; everything he loved. They should have left him in the ice!
As if his guilt wasn’t enough, he was now haunted by a dream of Anthony and Steven’s eternal love. How he wished those dreams would just go back to the way it was. Even the dream of lovemaking with Steve was better than a dream of ‘his past life.’
"Mr. Stark." He greeted, hoping he didn't sound off. 'Wonderful, now he will think I don't like him…'
He felt like he had been struck by thunder at the sight of the devilishly handsome man in the photo. Tony was tanned and had a strong jaw, pouty red lips. His dark eyes stand out against his high cheekbones, a smirk lighting up his face. He was gorgeous!
After Obie’s betrayal, she was the only one he trusted to helm Stark Industries. Pepper was younger than him and nowhere near as intelligent but she was brilliant and frighteningly efficient. She possessed a keen eye for details and never seemed to fail at a task given to her. Pepper handled each task with ease and grace. Tony was in way over his head, the only thing moderate about Virginia ‘Pepper,’ Pott was her alpha pheromone.
The whole universe instantly compressed down to their kiss, to the way they shared breath. Something inside Anthony sang with glee, feeling every blissful touch of skin and lips on his.
That he had taken out the reactor and handed it over to Rhodey. Just handed over the thing that was keeping him alive, with all the trust in the world that Rhodey would never hurt him. Then he simply reached out and accepted what his friend/older brother gave to him without checking to see if it had been tampered with.
"Thanks." Bruce smiled sadly before glanced away, unable to look at Tony. Tony frowned "But the last time I was in New York I kinda broke... Harlem." The guilt was thick in Bruce's voice, but it also as if Bruce was gauging his reaction. Like he was worried a mere reminder of what the Hulk had done would make Tony recoiled from him. In truth, Bruce should be the one who recoiled from him, The Merchant of Death.
He'd gotten used to the morning visit, shield personnel always came to monitor him since his arrival two months ago and lately they had been trying to recruit him. This was the second time Fury came himself. Captain America; that was all he was to them, and they expected him to just bounce back and save the world just because they send him to session after session of therapy. Never mind he had just lost everything, lost an entire world!
‘Am I supposed to believe that man was me? Belief in all that reincarnation bullshit about special type soulmate, twin flame/twin-soul who had spent many lifetimes together instead of just one.’
Tony's pulse roared in his ears; beating like dragonfly wings. Instinctively Steve found the key to unlocking the repress desire and longing in the brunet. Tony made inarticulate frenzied noises, all of his passion unleashed and uncoiled at last. He was kissing Steve like a magnet springing to steel, irresistible and natural as the tide.
They spent hours talking about opera, about politics, about sport. Steven traveled a lot and was a surprisingly perceptive observer of people. He regaled Anthony with tales from his travels in Europe, shared hints on fashion. His canny imitations of various people he met during his travel made Anthony choked with unexpected laughter. Anthony had never felt so at ease with anyone like he was with Steven, not even his clan.
The bathroom was completely with grey, white, blue marble in attractive pattern and had a sparkling clean sunken tub as well as a large glass-enclosed shower. It was stocked with all the luxuries like mini bottle of body lotion, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, as well as soap, grooming kits and shower caps that look so gorgeous it would be shame to open them.
Tony’s smile grew sharper, and he threw his head back and laughed. It was raucous, sounded like scraping knives.
That was the first time Maria ever treated him roughly and the physical and word abuse became worse as she fell more and more into depression with the passing years. In her drunken ravings, she spewed whatever poison she managed to come up with at Tony from day to day. For years he bore the pain while believing that it was all his fault.
"Divided and conquered, yeah, it was great." the brunet’s hands moved as he said it trying to work through Loki’s crazy. "But he knew he had to take us out to win, right? That's what he wanted.” Tony said in silent contemplation. “He wanted to beat us, he wanted to be seen doing it.” Tony emphasized the words to himself as well as Steve. “He wanted an audience.” Tony continued, his eyes met Steve’s. He paced, their eyes never left each other even as his genius mind almost audibly raced.
Either they have a peaceful Hufflepuff nature or they are more Gryffindor or Slytherin in personality and fiercely compete in chasing after their dream/climb to the top. They are some Omega although minority who decide to not married and focus on their job, some even sterilize themselves to stop they heat renders them to be the same as Beta.
Thor snarled at that, flinging his Mjolnir rapidly. Tony’s turned around swiftly. The hammer soared towards Tony’s chest and shunting him a few feet back into a tree with a loud crash before he even had time to do anything.
“But… that is because he hasn’t met me before. I will change his mind.” Steve informed him confidently, never took his eyes from his soulmate. It was unfair how society treated Omega. No one even batted an eye if an Alpha or Beta man slept around, hell he knew some of his acquaintances who made it a habit of cheating on their spouse behind their back. But when an Omega man or woman did it, they were looked down upon and could only saw fit to become a mistress/concubine.
His thoughts soon dissolved as pleasure arrowed into his body as his body moved on his own and met the blond’s, as the two…
So what if Steve and he were husbands during their past life. Tony Stark wasn’t the same man as his past self. Tony Stark wasn’t the same man as Anthony Reeves. He wasn’t as beautiful, confident and whole. Tony was broken, and he didn’t know how to fix himself.
“You were sadistic, egotistical, brainless alpha on a power trip who thought too highly of your skill and worth!” Steve had never thought he would ever hear his soul-mate spoke to him in such a dark tone. “How dare you wrapped yourself in our American’s symbol? YOU SCUMBAG! What made you think you were worthy?! Even THE TORCH was far worthier than YOU! Heroes like you were an embarrassment to our country and you made me want to puke!” he spat venomously.
"Not here." Thor shouted back, shoving Loki backward. "You give up the tesseract, you give up this poisonous dream. Come home." Thor's voice softened at the end, he pleaded to his brother.
The whole universe instantly compressed down to their kiss, to the way they shared breath. Something inside Steve sang with glee, his enhanced senses racing, razor-focus, feeling every blissful touch of skin and lips on his.
It was unusual for an Omega to be involved in any form of business. Steven liked him more and more. “28, how old are you? It doesn’t matter. I just wanna know?” he mimicked.
Iron Man repulsor blasted out of the moving machine and into the cold night air. He grinned at the sound of Captain America swearing behind him before dipping down the sky
As if in synchronization, both of them launched toward each other, crashing with a screech of metal and rush of wind at the center of the arch they had created. Then they spiraled through the air, wrestling at the time as trying to control their flight back down. Tony elbowed and smashed Thor into the side of a mountain. Thor leaped off the mountain and took Tony with him, smashed down into a few trees before they both hit the ground hard, rolling over several times. Loki started chuckling at the sight.
The image of Tony in Steve’s dream piled onto the Omega. His hair was brunet instead of black, his eyes brown instead of oceanic blue, and his body short instead of tall, but Steve knew with unshakable clarity that people knew the sky was blue and the grass was green that they were simply different versions of the other half of his soul.
“Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D used the cube to make weapons.” Steve said, his jaw and hand clenched, his posture stiff from barely controlled his anger. He gave Fury a hard stare.
“Mr. Stark.” between labored breaths she said the words. “You’re the best man, I ever got and I don’t just mean the sex.” Her blue eyes glimmered with love and adoration.
Fury came striding in, having discovered a security breach “What are you doing, Mr. Stark?” he said and then clenched his jaw.
The explosion that told them that the Helicarrier was being attacked occurred; that was when everyone sprang into action.
Nick Fury looked at the bloodstained cards, his expression pained. “They needed the push.” he sighed. ‘It was what Phil wanted.’ His mind supplied.
Bruce fought a smile. He had managed to impress Tony Stark, one of the five smartest minds on the planet.
Tony wasn’t weak. He was a survivor who survived an un-anesthetized surgery when men he didn’t even know cut through his flesh. He felt every cut into his skin, every vibration of the bone saw, every pull on every muscle before he felt an electromagnet bolted and screwed into his body. He felt the horrible pain and thank his goddamn eidetic memory he could never forget any of it even if he tried.
With an angry shout, Thor swung his hammer and leaped high into the air, ready to smash Steve with Mjolnir.
Then he felt it, a presence. The pull stronger than it ever was before. T-tony… Tony was nearby. He could feel it in his soul. He glanced over to Loki and noted that he was just as confused and thankfully not sprinting over to Steve, so he allowed himself a moment to tilt his head back and looked up to where he felt the presence the strongest. The sky…
Steven was kissing his neck, promising he would devote the rest of his life making him the happiest Omega in the world. This wasn’t right… This was a dream!
He encouraged Maria’s modelling and went to the fashion show she was in despite his busy schedule. Howard made her feel like the most beautiful woman in the world. He would ask waiters if they’d ever seen anyone as gorgeous as Maria. He was everything she wanted in a lover despite being old enough to be her father and his womanizer past.
It was like being pierced by an arrow by something whatever it was cupid opposite, and Steve staggered like a wounded stag. “No, I—please…" A brittle sheen in his sky-blue eyes, Steve reached a hand out as his tongue tripped over the words. Steve’s hand was hot as if it was burning a path straight to his heart.
“Pepper… I am bonded to someone else.” The bitterness was sharp enough to cut his breath in half. He wanted to look away but he couldn't, he owed her his full attention. Oh, but it was hard to watch.
Oh God! Steven looked thoroughly rumpled and debauched, with his hair askew and his cheeks aflame. The yearned and hunger in his eyes were so plain that Anthony felt elation thrill through him. He wondered if he could make Steven begs for his affections, writhes in agonized need for Anthony’s hands on his body, Anthony’s mouth against his skin. Made Steven admit Anthony was all he wanted in the world.
Tony walked towards him and, swiped the programs to the edge of the screen so he could speak to Bruce. They were eye to eye now. "Hey. I read all about your accident. That much Gamma radiation should have killed you." He reasoned, willing Bruce to fill the gaps.
"You need the cube to send me home, but I've sent it off I know not where." Loki continued, almost smiling gleefully.
Seen how to focus Bruce was on his work, he risked showing the electrified pointer he was holding as he gestured with his hands. "Well, I promise you a stress-free environment, no tension." Tony circled Bruce.
Oh, the Irony. He was actually weak and resentful. He had only ever visited his parent’s grave once and never again.
"It's good to meet you, Doc. Banner.” Tony said, as seriously as he’s capable, "Your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled." He grinned.
An Alpha like Rogers needed to be put in his PLACE! Like he would let any Alphas degraded him after Howard, after Obie!
Fury’s expressions slowly dawn on understanding. Captain America was nothing more than a shell of his former self; his life didn’t have a purpose anymore. Fury frowned at that “Is it that bad?”
“But….” I don’t want to make weapons, he swallowed the words. His wrists were broken the last time he said it. As if hearing his thought, Howard looked angrier if that was possible.
After birth, she didn’t produce any milk. At 10 months, after visiting the GP every week with a child covered in eczema, Tony was diagnosed with a dairy allergy and it was testing. Maria hated that the baby was problematic.
“A higher form?” The Captain sound horrified. Then he felt disgusted at Fury, he was just like Loki; a controlling bastard who needed mass weapons to feel secure of his damn power and who wasn’t afraid to tear worlds apart if it got him what he wanted.
Steven Thorne was one of the best Impressionists. Tony read his biographies. They were largely about his career as it took off once he became one of the Impressionists. It was mention that he was married to a notorious Omega. The paintings of his twin-flame and later husband were dismissed as being unimportant compared to his later works. JARVIS had traced the owner of both of the paintings. He ordered his A.I. to buy those paintings.
Tony’s sunglasses clear but dark blue in the fading sunlight. To Steve, meeting Tony again felt as though he had been trapped in a freezing cave and then suddenly freed to bask in the bright summer sun. It was blinding and beautiful and the only thing he ever wanted for the rest of his life. He was staring at Tony, face bright, overwhelmed with happiness, brighter than the sun. He was floating.
The bond wasn’t that strong back the since Steve wasn’t even walking on land then. Back then, the dreams were PG-13 because they responded to young Tony emotional and mental need. He was an adult now and Steve was walking and breathing so it would be many times harder and the dreams were more NC-17.
That dream was full of heat and so much love that at the last transcendent moment, Tony felt the whole world went up in white- flames. He woke up, blinked a few times before he realized it was just a vivid dream and felt the content feeling drained out of him. He was shocked by the intensity of the sorrow and loneliness he felt. The feeling was more than disappointment— like a piece of him was missing. It filled Tony like an ache.
“The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only the major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick starts the cube.” He noted the puzzle looks he was getting out of the corner of his eye.
The way Rogers was looking at him right now was alien, too much, undeserving, and he didn't understand nor… did he want it? ‘If he knows how broken, fuck up I am…’ his mind supplied…
“I’m not leaving her for you, Rogers.” he said with an icy, knife-sharp calmness that made Steve swallowed. “I am not going to let a stupid bond dictate my life.”
They're simpatico. Their powers came at a different kind of personal cost, but like Tony, Bruce was A GENIUS YET BROKEN IN MANY WAYS. TONY WANTED TO HELP HIM GAIN CONTROL OF THE HULK AND GET OUT OF THE SHADOWS.
There was nothing conscious of Steve's decision to follow his soulmate. He simply did, obeying his primal imperative.
The sound of Tony’s voice felt like the most beautiful sound in his life. Steve- cowl pushed back- laughed in relief and had few barely noticeable tears trickled down his cheeks. Hulk beat his chest in triumph and roared victoriously to the sky. Thor looked down at him, dumbfounded and happy with the situation.
Howard was a middle-level Alpha, he should have a pretty high chance of getting an alpha son. He believed at the least he will have a low level alpha as first born/only child but instead he got an Omega. Something to him is unthinkable and shameful. It was one of the reasons he abandoned Maria and Tony other than being bored and wanted to go back to his obsession.
No matter how progressive Howard said Rogers was, he was still a 1940 male alpha and there was no way an ultimate alpha would ever take the lying down after being riled up by a mere Omega especially one who would be in his team and didn’t even made the team the first cut.
Steven had felt the oddest sensation as if someone were calling to him as he entered the room. “James.” He called his cousin breathlessly. “I can feel my twin-flame… is here.”
Tony's voice cut over Steve like a laser neatly clipped the teeth off of a buzz-saw. “I was not lying. You knew nothing about what Howard willing to do! You thought you knew better than anyone else when you were as ignorant as a frog under a coconut shell!”
Instead, Rogers glared; even as he glared he looked thoughtful. Tony didn’t know what the other man saw, but apparently, Rogers decided that Tony wasn’t worth his time and back of.
The elevator opened and Steve saw Tony in a suit. Roger’s of the chart’s Alpha scent invaded Tony’s senses. The heat at the core of his body made his legs weak. Tony fought to compose himself.
Why should he expect any better from an Alpha from the same generation as Howard and who had been Howard’s lover! If he wasn’t good enough he was CURSED if he was amazing he was also CURSED, there were NO PLEASING Alphas like them!
This was wrong! He had created something groundbreaking as a reason to be proud of him instead of filled with jealousy and anger. This was wrong! He was never good enough always hated and degraded. Why did Howard radiate fury like a silver flame?
I am not saying Tony is way better than Steve, Steve true greatness is his heart/moral value and belief and his tactical mind not his set of power…
Was it possible for a man to have eyes so radiantly blue and glowing skin? Or was this near-death thing? His stare alone sent a flurry sparks through Tony’s body.
All Steve could do was stood there, watched as the small bright red and gold figure of Iron Man zoomed quickly toward the portal with that nuke. Tony was gone, disappeared, and left nothing but a harrowing reality for Steve. His heart practically stopped for two seconds before it was beating into overtime, drummed mercilessly against his rib cage until its burst through his chest became an all too real danger.
It feels like a deja-vu because Tony had been recause in every lifetime and Steve had try to keep him as safe as possible in every lifetime. Poor guy, a reckless Omega like Tony is hard for his mate but luckily Steve can handle it!
He drove through Pennsylvania, passing farmland and kept going. His heart didn’t feel any lighter. He missed Tony desperately and felt empty and bereft without his other half. Frustrated he decided to take a few days break in the nearby motel. That was when the dream came back full force as if to answer his yearning.
The bond was fucking with his brain as always. Tony had been inside that man’s head in all of his dreams with ‘Rogers’ ever since he first saw the Captain on Howard’s trading cards. He saw what that man saw, felt what he felt… and wasn’t it fuck-up because the guy didn’t even exist!
It was definitely another way of Howard manipulated him to continue his work after he was gone but Tony couldn’t help but be sentimental about it. He was an idiot for playing into Howard’s hands. “I-I… can’t let all his hard work go to waste.” even if he still couldn’t forgive Howard.
Steven’s breath was a siren’s song against his ear, telling him “I’m going to fuck you senseless.” Then Steven’s teeth puncture the skin over his shoulder blade.
Loki appeared in front of them “Kneel before me.” When the crowd ignored his order, another LOKI appeared, blocking the crowd. Several blue lights flashed around them, all taking on the form of Loki. They all grinned as they raised their spears, encircled the crowd.
Omega is considered sexier, more attractive and sexual charge than Beta. And since they are half the population of Alpha, beautiful Omega especially high-level one like Natasha and Tony are sought after. That’s why some Omegas prefers to focus on beautify them-self and seduce the richest Alpha they can find rather than work hard (Some people hate and look down on them for this).
"Thanks." Bruce muttered, felt some of the pressure he feels shifted. Tony smiled as he saw the beta relax a little.
“I understood.” Steve repeated for a third time, eyes dark with anger now. “That you’re a fucking coward and a liar!” As Steve carried on, his voice rose and the anger in his tone painted his words with venom.
"But I didn't want it." Tony insisted. “Two people being soulmates didn’t mean they would be good together in a relationship. It was just the universe screwing with us, and I didn’t want any part of it.” Tony looked so tired. His dilemma was understandable after all his parents were soulmate and they were far from happy. “I couldn't do this, Pepper, I couldn't." It would destroy him if he opened his heart to Steve only to be hated once Steve realized how broken he was.
Bruce put the scepter aside and shouldered past towards the computer monitor. “Sorry, kids. You didn't get to see my party trick after all.”
“You dared thought you could just walk into my life and expected me to leave the only good relationship I had and the Alpha I loved for you!” There was something sharp to his tone, like the tip of a butcher knife. “Who the hell do you think you were?! You didn’t own me, Rogers, I could be with anyone I wanted, and I chose Pepper!”
Despite his determination, Steve felt tired like a rock cairn over hot lava, and any prodded at the rocks would spill molten stuff down his insides.
“Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?” Nick Fury glared at the damn hypocrite, his tone dangerous.
You reminded me of my parent and what they did to me, Tony could say. I hated you since I am 8 I didn’t know if I could get over it, Tony could say. I didn’t want to end up like Maria, Tony could say. You wouldn't want a broken man and would end up hating me anyway so it was only wise that I pushed you away, Tony could say.
What was with death and people long for the one thing he knew wasn’t real. Steve’s warmth wasn’t wrapped around him, shielded him, and demanded he lives.
Soulmate or not what Tony had done made his blood boil. Granted, Tony baited and let Lieutenant James Rhodes took and kept the suit but that didn’t excuse what he had done.
The argument couldn’t distract Steve from Tony for too long, the super-soldier shifted his eyes from Tony to Fury, he took the opportunity to verbally attack Tony. “I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck-deep…”
“Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.” Bruce’s voice was a level higher and they could hear the tension in his voice. He jabbed his pen angrily at the accusing weapon design picture on the monitor.
Tony’s words were like bullets embedded into Steve’s heart. The Alpha felt his ire ignited like canon fuse.
Steve had resisted learning about current technology but for the first time since he woke up, it was good being Captain since it was easier to get SHIELD agent to help him surf the thing called the Internet. They found mainstream stuff of Iron Man that help reinforced Iron Man’s hero image.
Steve felt like a ten-ton truck had just crashed into his chest. His whole body suddenly gone numb, and he felt a weird, floaty feeling. Deep down, the Alpha knew everyone he knew was most likely dead. He was alone. Steve felt something break inside of him.
Three months ago? So about the time, Captain America was thawed? Pepper snapped back to look at him. “Was he… Captain America?” She was falling apart, he could see it.
The man looked a little surprise, but Steve didn’t care if he found out about him and Howard, not when Howard might be dead.
When Tony awakened from his dream he felt both guilty and like he lost a limp, he decided enough was enough he needed to tell Pepper the truth. It would make him more miserable but at least then one of them could be happy.
Another Alpha would have gotten territorial and might even try to hurt Rhodey but not Pepper, there was a quiet moment where Tony’s worry spiked, then a silent acceptance. He must have done something good in his life to deserve someone like her.
Silence. Any normal Omega would have immediately obeyed a growl from OF the chart level Alpha like Rogers but never Tony. He had been swimming with sharks and military types in the business world-A world that was Alpha dominated culture- since he cut his baby teeth. He took it as an undeniable challenge.
Steve frowned at what Tony was saying, thinking it over. "You think Fury's hiding something?" He asked softly.
“Son of a bitch.” Tony grouched. Steve, to his credit, just gave him a look. “The Stark Tower.” The brunet supplied and paused just a second before shot toward his workstation without a backward glance. He needed to get the suit fixed to fly.
One thing for sure, he couldn’t put Pepper through this anymore, not when he knew he couldn’t love her the same way he used to. Pepper, his special Pepper deserved more. She deserved a man that could love her with all his heart. He had to come clean to her soon. Just the thought of hurting her made him felt low but he had to do it.
The downside they usually consider as boring and less desirable/sexual attractive/Sexual charge as mate compare to Alpha or Omega.
“Mommy.” Tony called softly made his way to his mom. There was anger, a burning fire in Maria’s eyes. But it was fueled by pain, and Tony wished so badly he could fix it somehow, there must be a way; Stark’s men are excellent engineers. His mom ignored him and make her way straight to the bar drinking straight from the bottle. She finished a whole bottle and had another.
A small part of Loki felt relief because he thought Thor would despise him when he found out his true heritage. He should have known that his single-minded, witless oaf of a brother would surprise him. A bigger part of him, however…
It took effort for him to tear his eyes away from Rogers even after barely a glance and turned to Bruce who was grinning quietly. You really have got a lid on it, haven't you?"
"Respect? He smashed Harlem." Tony cringed as soon as the words left his lips. Why did he say that?! He should never say that around Bruce even if it had no bite. His head felt foggy again.
“Sometimes there wasn't a way out, Tony.” Steve said softly, slowly made his way along the girder toward the billionaire.
The whole universe instantly compressed down to their kiss, to the way they shared breath. Something in Anthony sang with glee, his senses raced, razor-focus felt every blissful touch of skin and lips on his.
Steve quickly agreed to try shawarma. He didn’t care if he didn’t even know what shawarma was or that Fury would be angry that they didn’t report immediately. His relief was overpowering and almost too much to handle at the moment.
Nick Fury turned toward the Thunderer, his voice two levels higher. “But you were not the only people out there, were you?” he glared. Thor could saw the resentment lurking in his eyes. “And…” Fury’s voice turned even louder, sharper. “You were not the only threat.”
It was so warm… he felt himself cuddling a warm body, legs entangled. He felt at home, something he hadn’t felt since he woke up in this foreign world. As consciousness return, Steve opened his eyes and gazed up into the face of a devilishly handsome man with dark hair who looked so much like Tony. He couldn’t help but stare besotted at the man. Something chorded inside of him, he knew this man. ‘Tony’ something inside him whispered. ‘His soulmate, his lover, his husband.’
He could feel him, even though he couldn’t quite see his face. It filled every atom of his body with such warmth that all the ice that numbed him to the world was gone. He wanted to stay here forever with Howard, even though he knew that was impossible!
Steve was appalled that his soul-mate just poked at a sleeping dragon or in this case, sleeping green rage monster. Couldn't he, at least, kept his lips zipped around Bruce Banner?! Instead, Tony just have to be a total asshole and poked his big fat stick into a wound that was damned tender without caring how much it hurt the guy! Steve wanted to yell at him to keep his mouth shut but he had a feeling Tony would just laugh in his face and carried on.
Took away the super serum and Rogers was just a scrawny man with countless ailments weighed him down and whom the army had rejected a few times! REMOVE THE ARMOR, AND TONY STILL WOULD HAVE MADE A MARK ON THE WORLD. REMOVE THE GENETIC AND PHYSICAL AUGMENTATIONS AND NOBODY WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT ROGERS!
His armor was completely unresponsive now. Tony's breath caught in his throat, his lungs struggled for breath and desperation pickled inside him as he had no air circulating. His heartbeat hysterically like it was going to explode in his chest. Time ticked by as Tony’s conscience faded.
Steve was sure his entire world was spinning wildly out of control. Pain seared along his skin. "Why are you doing this?" To his humiliation, tears welled in his eyes.
Maria could never get pregnant again. She couldn’t give Howard the son he so desperately wants. Howard didn’t even come to see how she was doing. Tears fell to her cheeks and she wept. A deeper fear became clear: was she less of a woman and an Omega because her body was no longer capable of doing what an Omega woman’s body was evolutionarily made to do?
Not only that, Howard expected Maria to give birth to an Alpha as their first child and resented both Maria and Tony for having an Omega instead of an Alpha as his first and only child. By the time Tony was four years old, his mom was drowning in depression. An unfair expectation was a dangerous thing.
“Sacred…?” Tony laughed, but it was bitter and guarded like he was nursing some feeling deep down inside and was afraid to let it loose. “No, it isn’t. It is poison. The sweetest poison that poisons your mind, make you believe in fake feeling and unrealistic dreams before slowly eating at your soul.”
They sat for hours until sunset. Anthony heard the sound of Steven set aside his instrument. The gorgeous blond covered the painting before prowled forward to him. Anthony wasted no time he pulled Steven by the back of his neck and crushed their lips together.
Tony could felt Roger’s gaze pierced through him, pinned him like a butterfly beneath his lens. It only served to fuel his anger.
He glanced over at Tony. “Sorry, the computer is moving a little slow for me.” Steve felt pride bubbled inside of him as he had found out about Phase 2 faster than Tony’s computer did.
Then someone cleared their throat, and the moment was broken. They remembered their teammates were around. It hit Tony like lightning, all the reasons this was a really bad idea. Tony could have kicked himself for letting the bond fucked with his mind and acted like a lovesick buffoon. ‘Pepper.’ He might be alive but that changed nothing, he couldn’t wreck the beautiful relationship he had with Pepper for something so uncertain, something that could ruin him.
“See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could." Fury went on. He turned to Tony who still turned away from him. “Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea." Fury let out each word as if he was weighed them. “… In heroes.” He let the sadness leaked into his voice again as he finished, looked at Steve.
Tony had never asked JARVIS because of the thought of… but the fucker must, at least, had enough footage to put together a cohesive picture of what he had gone through in there and at the most video and audio of him being strapped to a table and screamed in agony, delirious with pain. Just the thought of someone saw him under such a vulnerable position made Tony’s blood boiled.
They both fought with their fists again. Tony swung and missed. Thor overpowered Tony, punched his back and almost knock the human to his knees. He lifted Tony off his feet, swung him up and slammed him down into the dirt. Thor kept beating on him as he was down, pummelled him hard.
Worse, Tony was stunned by Roger’s alpha smell that his breath came out short, never had he met an alpha with such strong pheromone, washing over him in a wave of desire. Rogers practically screamed alpha hormones. The serum must have strengthened Roger’s smell just as it made Rogers beyond the alpha stage.
That memory was more vivid than ever. Steve’s beautiful hurt eyes, Steve’s acceptance, Steve’s love, he remembered it all every day. The pain of the memory made him lose himself working more than ever. He got several charities going to reconstruction projects to rebuild half the damn city. He immersed himself into repairing the Mark VII and took a look at the alien tech. Tony invented some anti-Chitauri tech. When he planned to repair the top floor, he got the idea of renovating the tower to be the Avenger base.
Fury sighed; he didn’t like this one bit but it was his only resort “What if I tell you Howard Stark wasn’t your soul-mate.”
“Why? Why couldn’t I be enough for you? This wasn’t the life you promised me.” Her voice was broken. She cried, got drunk and vent her anger on Tony.
As Tony wanted to walk away, he heard a loud thud from behind him. Steve muttered expletives as his fists jabbed the wall viciously. The super-soldier screamed in frustration and pain.
‘The bastard was only looking after himself!’ Steve thought in disgust. It made perfect sense. Why else would a spoiled billionaire, asshole like Tony Stark worked for Shield for free or willingly risks his life fighting an alien army? He smirked with dark glee. He had ammo to bring Tony Stark down!
The next time she saw her husband Howard looked at her like a child looked at his favorite toy that had broken and it hurts, it hurts so much!!! She would never be able to forget that look.
"You're tip-toeing big man. You need to strut." He said to Bruce and emphasized his point by straightened his back and stepped forwards ridiculously. Rewarded with a small chuckle from the Doc, he resigned himself to facing Captain America.
The thought of PEPPER startled him out of his reverie. FUCK! Shame spreading across his vein so venomous it was like a parasite or a disease, how could he let himself sway when he already had Pepper?! NO, he would be damn if he gives in to this! He was BETTER THAN HOWARD, he wasn’t a damn cheater. Being tempted this much with just sight and smell made him furious with Steve and HIMSELF.
By the time Iron Man got to his feet, their prisoner had disappeared into the clouds with the blond man. "Now there's that guy."
Tony seethed at Steve, it was so much easier to fall back into anger and hate. It made him strong. He would never give in to this curse bonding. He had seen and experienced the aftereffect of a failed bonding in the shape of being locked inside a dark closet, Howard’s and Maria’s handprints burned into his skin, his back bleed-legacy of Howard's skilled with a belt, in the glass that cut through his skin when Howard threw a bottle at him, in his broken rib when THE HYPOCRITE caught him making out with a Beta, his parent tore into him with the edge of their tongue, his mother became a shadow in Howard’s life and needlessly wasted her life away, and in every poisonous word, they used to degrade him!
It felt like being shot multiple times. He heard a bark of harsh, humorless laughter then he realized the sound coming from him. He wiped at his tears, the horrible laugh still hadn’t stopped. It had never been the same again after that. He couldn’t forgive Howard anymore!
“You’re not the guy to make the sacrifice play.” Rogers said, looked him in the eyes with focus, scornful glare. “To lays down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.” Rogers snarled, and that felt like being shot because he had let Yinsen laid down on a wire for him, didn’t he.
Howard hanker for something his wife couldn’t give, nay she wasn’t even close to being good enough for him anymore. Nothing was good enough for him anymore so he turned to the bottle to forget his woes.
Bruce laughed softly. "It... It is alright. I wouldn't come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy thing." Banner replied, looking at the screwdriver Tony was wielding. Tony looked over at him, smiled again, moving around the worktop.
"Well, if he could do that." Banner continued. "He could achieve heavy-ion fusion at any reactor on the planet."
Steven moved, started to thrust with earnest. The stretch stung at first, then the pleasure danced over the pain and made Anthony keen with delight. Steven was breathless felt the same, and it redoubled until Anthony almost thought that he was the one fucking Steven. Anthony moaned loudly and answered back, gave him just as he got, rode him hard, smacked against him.
SHIELD had been monitoring Bruce and knew he hadn't had an incident in a long time, despite living in very heavily populated areas. Areas most people would stress out in. Also genius here, Rogers should back the hell off!
Sorry Tony was harsh but to be fair a lot of his hurt was cause by Obie and Howard and they are both alphas. And Obie is a high level Alpha-and in this universe the more high level the alpha was the more they usually sought to be top dog. Not that being Alphas are bad-Tony just had bad luck with relationships and sometime friends ex Tiberius.
