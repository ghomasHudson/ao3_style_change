Castiel hesitated, debating whether or not to come closer. “Dean—”
“I was gonna say it’s not your problem, man,” Dean finishes, tapping his fingers on the steering wheel anxiously. He very, very much dislikes where this conversation has gone. “I mean, me being all insecure and shit. Not your problem. It’s mine, that’s what it is.”
“That’s not what I mean,” Dean said. Their eyes met, and Castiel understood. After years of hunting, somehow Dean thought he was weak for still… what? Feeling pain? Being human?
“Not now, Cas. Please.” Dean faltered, muscles tensed as he clutched the edge of the sink. His bare chest rose and fell at twice the usual speed, and a long vein along his temple glared at the bubbles. The standard signs of his temper flaring out of control.
Cas’s eyes soften like butter in sweltering heat. “Dean.” How does he do that? How does he know without Dean having to say the words? And how is that one soft utterance of his name enough to make him want to hold on and never let go? “You know that I’m not…”
“I would like you to see this portrait often, Dean, so that it reminds you of our talk,” Cas explains, fixing an imploring look onto him that had no business being so convincing. “I fear that if we display it in your room, you will attempt to distance yourself from it. But I see how often you come here just to glance at these photographs, and I hope that this addition will not deter you from doing so. Please, if you would like me to remove it…”
The unused pillow accepted his head like it was meant to be there, and he curled up on his side, holding his knees against his bare chest as it rose and fell softly. He wasn’t asleep, but just there, slowly fading away from the overwhelming reality on the other side. As he faded, so did the sharp pain in his chest, until it was just a hum, reminding him not to fall asleep because there was no one there to protect him.
Cas smiled brightly, but toned it back so as not to frighten the lethargic man. “Always.”
“I can think of something else I want in our heaven,” Cas muttered against Dean’s lips.
“I guess so.”
The angel sets his wide, intense gaze onto him. “Am I incorrect in my observations?”
“No,” Cas interrupted. “Because you’re alive. Do you think I don’t feel pain? Even as an Angel of the Lord? I’ve been both angel and human, Dean, and I can tell you that, while it may be different things that cause it, the pain is just the same.”
“I guess,” Dean retorts, mind barely functioning from, well, the night before, mixed with a distinct lack of caffeine in his system.
Then a gentle ruffle of feathers followed by the dip in the bed took away that hum, too, for the first time in a long time. Cas didn’t touch him, only laid on his back with his palms flat against his stomach, listening to the content heartbeat from the man who had been seconds from death merely hours ago. All it took was that heartbeat to remind him that nothing would ever take away Castiel’s hum, as long as Dean Winchester was alive and therefore capable of dying too soon, while everything was still in ruins. But he didn’t mind the hum, because it also reminded him of his only mission, his purpose. It reminded him of his love.
body,” Cas chokes out, “all the while,
“What are you gonna do with all the stuff you bought?” he asks. He doesn’t mean to ask that question in particular, or anything really, other than to hear Cas’s voice. He supposes it slips out of him because a part of him does want to know, the part that isn’t wholly distracted by the perfect creature in the passenger seat of his car.
He makes a sound that would be embarrassing if Cas didn’t swallow it whole, and the world goes fuzzy at the edges like it does when he’s drunk, only he’s had just one beer and he’s glad about that for the first time because it means he’ll remember this in the morning. Usually – before Cas – he didn’t even mind forgetting the next morning, because his bones were still pleasantly hollow and his blood seemed to circulate better so who really needed to know anything more than that there was warmth and closeness and connection? Maybe it hurt less once they were gone that way. But now, now he wants to remember every scrape of Cas’s fingernails against his cheek, wants to revel in how heat rises and follows Cas’s touch like magnets, how Cas’s lips are chapped but he likes it because they catch on his skin and it burns just right.
“As far as I can tell, we have been deposited into an alternate reality wherein a virus similar to
Dean shivers at the thought, heat building in his gut. He leans down and swipes his tongue over the head of Castiel's cock before sucking it into his mouth. Castiel whines so loudly that Dean has to reach up and smack a hand over his mouth so he doesn't wake the others. Castiel's breath is hot under his palm as he pants, and when Dean slides his mouth further over his cock, Castiel bites into his skin. Dean hollows his cheeks and sucks harder, enjoying the ache in his jaw and the taste of the other man's cock on his tongue. He splutters when Castiel's hips come off the bed and he shoves his cock further into Dean's throat, and Dean’s dick throbs in his pants.
“There are bears in the bathroom?”
“Uh… check with the lube and condoms?” Dean suggests, jerking his head towards his bedside table.
"While I never had sexual intercourse during the occupation of a female vessel, I suspect the notion is not dissimilar," Castiel replies, groaning when Dean stretches his finger out to touch his prostate again. His fingernails dig into the flesh of Dean's shoulder and a shiver rolls down the other man's body, a small moan spilling from his mouth. "Oh."
He whispers her name, terrified if he says it any louder, she’ll disappear. “Emma.”
"I miss you both."
Dean has to think about that for a second. He knows he's been in three poly relationships, but how many of those were triads? "Uh, two? Or, well one, with a second where it became an option, and then suddenly wasn't an option. That was complicated."
"No. Her son's back, I'm just curious."
The local law enforcement are skeptical of their presence, but helpful once they’ve contacted their ‘supervisor’ (Bess), explaining the murders and the investigation’s progress. They have a suspect, but Dean’s fairly certain they aren’t the murderer, because he’s pretty sure they’re dealing with ghouls.
"You're… you're a shapeshifter," he says, a little awed.
Castiel's eyes dark to Benny, who's staring down at his coffee, face thoughtful, nodding his head slowly along with Dean's words. When Benny realises Castiel's watching him, he looks up and smiles at him. Castiel looks thoughtful, then, and after a moment of silence, he stares Benny down and says, "Can you get Monday night off?"
Castiel doesn't speak, but the noises that leave his mouth are constant. If he's like this when Dean hasn't even touched him, what noises will he make when Dean gets his mouth on him? What noises would he make if Dean slid his dick into him?
Dean hears Castiel's voice whisper "Cover your eyes," from behind him, and tries to turn to look at him, but it makes his whole body scream in pain. He manages to get his face in the crook of his elbow. He hears a woman's scream and can just see the shining white light from around his arm.
"Gross, why?"
"My visions are the inevitable future. When I see something come to pass, it doesn't change."
"If we die here," Dean begins in a whisper, staring at the blood on his hands. "Is that it?"
"It's one of twenty-two countries that was never invaded by the British, so the Men of Letters doesn't have a foothold," Rowena replies, falling into a chaise lounge gracefully, almost like a woman in an old Hollywood movie. She looks exhausted, and Dean feels similarly, especially since they haven't actually slept yet and it’s now mid-morning. He blinks over at the raven settled on the windowsill, beak nuzzled under its wing. Dean feels terrible for Castiel, he's been human far less often than he's been a raven over the last week, and Dean wishes for the millionth time they knew how to break the spell. "Bright side is we can do the spell tonight once the sun sets. I left quite a collection of ingredients in the atrium."
Lucifer frowns suspiciously at Castiel, but he doesn't argue anymore. Instead, he hesitantly admits, "Dagon."
Castiel does, cupping his hand around Dean's thigh, under his knee to open up his legs further and sliding his cock out of Dean for a moment before thrusting back in. It shoves up against Dean's prostate and knocks the breath out of, pulling a short whine from his mouth. Castiel does it again, then again until he's picking up a rough rhythm of deep and hard thrusts that leaves stars behind Dean's eyes. When he rolls his head on his shoulder to look over at Benny the man has his shirt off and his dick out of his jeans, and he's jerking it in time with Castiel's thrusts, his eyes on where Castiel splits Dean open.
It occurs to Dean then that if Lucifer managed to get through powerful celestial warding, he had help doing so. Help on the
Dean nods. “I’m sure.”
, Dean.”
- blush - because he's just about positive Benny uses it everytime they fuck, but Castiel must understand the rest because his eyes go wide and he lets out a startled laugh.
Castiel's mouth is open in shock, and Dean doesn't blame him, he’s feeling just as surprised. He truly thought they would have to break the curse before they could retrieve Castiel's memories. If he had his memories back, it could make breaking the curse easier.
Claire catches Dean's eye, squatting down in the lip of the garage, staring into the box of old tapes Dean found at a garage sale and was planning to show Deanna, see if any of them were worth keeping. "If you want any of them, take them."
moods. Castiel can definitely get down with that.
"Uh," Dean brushes his lips with the side of his index finger then chews at his fingernail before he finally says, "Yeah. I want to. I've not… with a man."
Dean and Castiel let the girls have the only bedroom, with the double bed and the pull-out couch, and take the other pull-out couch in the main room. It's not the most comfortable, but it's far better than sleeping on the ground in a tent.
"You are nervous again," Castiel tells him, sitting up. "We can stop."
“Hey, I didn’t get your name before,” Dean directs to the oldest gently, leaving the two feet of space between them. “I’m Dean, that’s my partner Castiel. We’re going to help you.”
Rowena nods her head and lets her arms fall to her sides, the grimace still on her face. "Selene and Endymion had fifty daughters, but by the seventeenth century, when I first came across one, there were only eight left; Sofia, Zoe, Eliana, Alexis, Evangeline, Daphne, Maia, and Dorothea. I don't think it's Sofia, that girl doesn't have the brains that God gave geese." She stops and looks up at them thoughtfully. "You know, Sofia might be our solution, she might just be stupid enough to give up her sister."
Claire lets out a breath through her nose and falls back into her chair, crossing her own arms. "No." She looks a bit like a petulant child, and for the first time Dean realises she's still so young. He's never asked how old she is, but at a guess, she's barely out of her teens, twenty-two or twenty-three. She's so young, and she kills people for a living.
Dean and Castiel surge towards each other at the same time, meeting in the middle with an unpleasant, painful clack of teeth. Laughter bubbles up from Dean's chest when Castiel pulls away to apologise.
Castiel tilts his head to the side, frowning at the two people in front of him. “How do you mean?”
Castiel makes a noise like he's pained, and Dean looks over at him. His cheeks are ruddy and his eyes are glassy, and his hand is wrapped around the shape of his cock in his jeans.
Someone calls Dean's name from the hallway that leads to storage and offices, and when he rushes into it, he finds human-Sam on the floor bleeding from a large jagged cut just below his ribcage. There's a lot of blood, and Dean's not sure he'll live long enough for werewolf healing to kick in.
Castiel turns to look at him. “I love you, Dean. I’m in love with you.”
Castiel gives him a confused look, head tilted to the side. "Yes, Sam?"
"Yeah, uh, Castiel."
It’s Castiel.
They barely make it inside, and Dean's just set the bag carefully onto the floor, before Castiel is pushing Dean up against the door, slamming it shut behind him and claiming his mouth. Dean gets a hand in the angel's hair and pulls his face to the angle he wants it, so he can kiss him properly and get his tongue into Castiel's mouth. Castiel tastes amazing and Dean dives further in to chase the other man's tongue, pressing his hips against Castiel's. Dean slides his hands from Castiel's hair down to his hips and back up underneath his shirt to paw at his skin. Castiel groans when Dean lightly rakes his nails down his spine and his hips jerk up harshly, pressing into Dean's, making his skin prickle with arousal.
"Fuck, Benny," Dean grunts, stroking his thumb over the head of his cock, shivering at the sensation. He's so fucking close to coming, his entire body feels like lightning.
Castiel nods his head and Dean turns around, sliding his arms behind his back, resting the underside of one arm over the underside of the other. He watches in the mirror across the room as Castiel undoes the extension again before kneeling closer to Dean. He’s got wrist cuffs down pat, he was doing them long before Dean brought up shibari, so Dean gets to sit back and watch the concentration on his face instead of instructing him. Castiel pulls at the cuff to check the tension once it’s tied and Dean’s gut grows warm at the feeling.
"She still in pain?" Dean asks, staring down at the baby in his arms, who's still wriggling, but mostly quiet, more interested in chewing on the collar of his t-shirt. Sam nods. "Go take a nap in the spare room, I'll get the girls fed and see if I can put this one down, you bring any tylenol?"
Dean lets out a long, deep breath and says, "Oh, that thing. Well, yeah, for a while. But I could always tell you felt the same, and just weren't ready to admit it. That's why I stuck around. You're a rat bastard for it, but I fucking love you."
Castiel nods.
He's following after a particularly squat hare, prowling through the decaying fallen leaves, shrubs, and roots that make up the forest floor. This time, he plans to bring it back and make something for Kelly because he vaguely remembers the pack feeding the pregnant omegas rabbit meat. Kelly's not a wolf, but he knows rabbit meat is safe for humans, and she's going to need the protein and calories pretty soon.
Benny appears as they're pulling apart, obviously summoned by Claire and Jack's appearance in the kitchen, stealing his own kiss. Dean feels warm and fond and he pokes them both in the hip so they'll stop, and he won't say something stupid. Mary starts wriggling in his arms, face screwed up like she's about to cry (or do a shit, Dean can never really tell the difference), so he lifts her up against his shoulder and bounces her out of the entryway, shooting a look at Benny and Castiel that he hopes says
Castiel smiles gently and takes it, cradling it in his hand. "Thank you."
Dean laughs. "Two out of three is pretty good."
Her eyes go wide and she says, "It has a V8? God, I have to hear it."
Dean whispers it again, "
A sound like the crack of lightning comes with Dean’s first hard shove in and the angel shouts something in Enochian and begins to pull back.
"Dean, I don't care," Benny says, though he's extremely unconvincing.
Dean scoffs, shaking his head at the absurdity of it all. He feels a bit like his head might explode at any minute, too much information at one time. He wholeheartedly believes that if they involve the angels they're asking for trouble, but he trusts Rowena enough to work with the people she trusts, even if he won't ever trust them himself.
Benny's car is waiting in the driveway, and Dean finds him making himself at home in Dean's kitchen. He's made himself a sandwich and poured himself a beer, and he's sitting at the kitchen bench, staring at the doorway as Dean comes through it. "Hey," he greets, before going back to his food.
"What do you mean?"
Dean looks over at Castiel who's watching their interaction, before he says, "I don't have to work tomorrow, you guys can come over and see her if it's okay with Cas." Castiel's mouth turns up into brilliant smile, one that makes Dean's stupid gut do kickflips, before he nods. "Awesome, come round whenever. Has anyone taken your order, yet? Cause I'll take it and go back to the bar before Benny fires me."
Dean licks into Castiel's mouth and he responds in kind, tasting the inside of his mouth before pulling back to heave a deep breath. The freckles on Dean's cheek stand out against the red flush that has spread across them and Castiel wants to lean forward and press a kiss to each and every one of them, no matter how long it takes. He realises he's been just sitting there, staring at Dean's cheeks for an abnormally long time and turns up so their eyes meet. Dean is bemused and his eyes are crinkled in the corner.
"One of them," Lucifer says, staring at his hands as he picks at his nails, bored. "The future changes with every choice you make. The psychic will understand," he looks over his shoulder at Patience, who's standing between Alex and Claire. Despite being confronted with the devil and a demon, she's not afraid, none of them are, and Dean has to give them props for that.
Sam's face morphs into confusion, and then contemplation, then something like resignation, which he hides with a smile that doesn't quite reach his eyes. "No, I just thought it meant you- no. Nevermind, just ignore me. Have you seen Eileen?"
"Not on the couch this time," Dean says, nudging him away once Castiel starts tugging at the hem of Dean's shirt. "I don't think Patience will forgive us a second time."
Castiel reaches out and takes Dean's hand, threading their fingers together as Benny rests his own hand on Dean's knee. "Don't be."
Sam never touches him like that.
“It’s gypsophila paniculata,” Castiel says, nodding his head. Dean and the examiner both turn to him in confusion, and when he notices, he says, “Its common name is Baby’s Breath, a perennial that grows in alkaline soil. It’s one of the only plants I can grow in the garden at home.”
When Sam's gone Benny sits down next to him, pulling Dean into his side. Dean lets him, pressing his face into Benny's neck and taking a deep breath. Benny smells nice, like his cologne and food, and Dean breathes him in, tries to center himself. Benny's arm tightens around him and he rests his head on top of Dean's.Neither of them speak, Benny knows Dean wants silence after he's had an episode, and Dean appreciates it.
Sam nods. “I know,” he says, turning to Castiel, face sincere and sympathetic. “But you’ll never know if you never ask.”
Sam shrugs. "Human during the day, wolf at night."
"You… you don't have to pretend. That you didn't see what I did. That you weren't terrified."
"Yes."
Dean reaches up to thread his fingers through his hair with the hand not holding the gun, tugging at it until it hurts. How the fuck are they supposed to find Jack now, especially once they throw Lucifer into the Cage?
“Oh little brother, you always did want things you couldn’t have.”
Dean snorts. "Ha! You're a sixteen year old girl who has big gooey feelings for me, flattery gets me everywhere."
, then after a moment's thought,
“Yes,” Castiel replies, nodding his head once. “I found them in the bottom of Dean’s closet with other bed coverings.”
"You and I share a profound bond, if you think of something deeply enough, for long enough, I find it impossible to keep your thoughts out."
The man gives him a strange look, and Benny steps in to save him before he digs himself a hole. "Ignore him, he's a dick and he's manic. He's gonna go check and see if your order's ready yet."
Dean loses his jeans and shoes and leans over Castiel, taking Castiel's face in his hands and tilting it up. When Dean kisses him it's rough and desperate, licking into Castiel's mouth and tasting the whiskey he drank earlier on his tongue. It's an awkward angle, but Dean doesn't mind until his neck starts to ache, so he presses a hand to Castiel's shoulder and pushes him down into the mattress, climbing on top of him.
Jack nods excitedly.
speak to women like that, do you understand me?" Dean hisses, settling the bowl on the table with a clatter. "Now get. The fuck. Out."
When he's outside, around the corner in the alleyway, he counts the last of his money, deciding he'll need to get more soon. He looks up when the raven trills sharply from its roost on a window frame from the second story of the grocery store. He sends it a pointed look. "I told you to stay. C'mon, let's go."
Benny's cheeks flush and he steps up between the vee of Dean's legs, curling his arms under Dean's knees and pushing his legs up. It almost throws Dean off-balance and he has to shoot his hand out behind him quickly to hold himself up. He wraps his other arm around Benny's shoulders and holds onto him as the other man takes his cock and presses the head to Dean's hole, pushing it in slowly.
Dean pulls away from Benny again and replants his hand behind himself, looking down his body at where he and Castiel are connected. The sight of his body stretched around Castiel's cock sends a shiver down his spine, heat pooling in his gut. "Just gimme a second." Castiel nods easily, sliding one of his hands up Dean's chest, tracing the shape of his ribs and brushing his thumb over a nipple. Dean lets out a long breath and his eyes flutter closed as he relaxes his body around Castiel's dick. "You have a stupid amount of dick, no one needs that much dick." Castiel laughs. "Go on, fuck me."
"Normally I'd say you could probably go home and I'd let you know when the car's ready, but I don't think Bobby will let you take the loaner outside the state. It's up to you what you want to do, man."
Dean slides a hand from Castiel’s hip up his body and takes the man’s face into his palm. “Baby.”
Castiel pulls Dean's shirt over his head and hooks his fingers in the waistband of Dean's sweatpants, looking for permission to remove them. Dean nods and helps Castiel do so, lifting his hips and then his legs before Castiel throws it onto the floor and out of the way. He's not wearing briefs, and when Castiel looks down, his cock is there, out for him to see, and the heat in Castiel's belly grows, causing his knees to weaken and his mouth to go dry.  Castiel wants to reach out and touch him, wants to find out what Dean tastes like, how he feels on his tongue, but he doesn't know how to ask, wouldn't know how to go about it even if Dean said yes. Instead, he kisses the man again, pressing up against his body.
happened? Why did you want me to stop her?"
Benny nods and shoves the menu in Dean's direction. Dean points to the kleftiko first, and says, "That's the lamb I was telling you about," then the kotopoulo me ryzi, "That's chicken and rice, it's really good, too," then the pansetta, "And that's pork belly."
Sam joins them after a while, and once he's eaten they take the girls home.
"Children," she says in lieu of a greeting.
motion. "I mean, threesomes are more sex-centric, and a ménage à trois - or throuple, triad, there's a few names for it - are more relationship-centric. Mostly, I like saying triad."
Dean's hand reaches out to squeeze Castiel's knee, and it stays there until they reach the roadhouse down the highway and they have to separate to exit the car. They play pool for a few hours, for fun rather than for money, and Castiel enjoys every moment of it, especially when Dean steps up behind him and places his hands over Castiel's on the cue to help him line-up his shot.
“Still unconscious. Gabriel has healed them, but we were unable to wake them,” Castiel tells him, brow furrowed. “I found Gabriel in a Holy Oil trap, the spell must not have been powerful enough to work on an archangel.”
“Do it again,” Dean replies, wiggling his hips pointedly until Castiel slaps his ass and tells him to stop moving. “Yes, daddy.”
When Dean climbs back into the bed, Castiel pulls him into his arms and kisses him again. Neither says anything, too afraid they'll break whatever spell they've cast between them. They’re still holding each other when they fall asleep, moments later.
"Yeah, Cas," Dean replies, though he's not really sure
"It's the end of the fucking world. Get over it."
-*-*-*-*-*-
“Good boy. How are you feeling? I need a proper answer this time,” Castiel asks after he’s flogged Dean’s ass and thighs raw.
“Sick,” Dean says, grinning brightly. “Love you, Cas.”
The raven follows him out of the cave again, flying above him. It circles and swoops down at him, pecking him teasingly, and Dean bumps him back with his muzzle. He's a playful thing, and he's warmed up to Dean quickly. It makes Dean wonder if Castiel hadn’t had a companion in a while, if he had ever had one.
He looks different. Rougher. Sort of bigger, with more muscle. There’s a scar over his cheek, a slash, like one made from a knife. This is not
They enter the house together and head to the lounge room where the others are waiting. It's crowded, too many people shoved into such a small room and Dean quiets the room, sending everyone off to their respective corners, leaving the witches the only occupants while the others watch from the doorways.
Dean grins again and Castiel kisses him soundly.
Sam frowns and looks over at Eileen. “I don’t think so, what’s gone missing?”
Dean's not quite sure what to say after that so instead he says,
for me."
“Thank ‘oo, Deanie!” Jack shouts, taking the bits of banana Dean has ripped off into even sized chunks. He shoves the first piece in his mouth, face already covered in the sticky yellow food, when he finally realises something about Dean is different. Other than the nakedness. With a mouthful of banana, Jack says, “Deanie, your wings are pretty!”
Rowena turns to look at Castiel, her face weary, showing her years more than she ever has. "A cretin. My son."
He hunts, not because he needs to but because he has nothing else to do, and sometimes he brings it back to the penthouse. Other times, he lets the poor beasts go.
Castiel replies, sending a series of laughing-crying and winking faced emojis right after it.
Dean knows that even his Castiel cares for Claire (in a way, so does Dean), so it's not a surprise that as soon as the car's stopped, Castiel's jumping out of it. Claire meets him in the middle, squeezing him into a tight hug. She's crying, and Dean thinks Castiel might be too.
Castiel stumbles into the apartment early in the morning, with Claire hot on his heels, barely managing to make it to the couch before he collapses, holding his hand over the haphazardly stitched wound in the meat of his hip. Claire locks the door behind them, checking the warding and salt lines before dropping their bags on the ground.
Castiel looks unsure, but nods nevertheless and releases Dean. He miracles the earth parted between them until skeletons are revealed in the crater he's created. Some of them are so small and Dean feels breathless for a whole other reason. He pushes through it and climbs down into the hole, still breathing through his nose as he chooses a larger skeleton (just so he doesn't have to look at the tiny ones huddled together).
At the first touch of Dean's slick fingers, the press of it against his hole and then the pressure of it as Dean slides it inside gently, Castiel groans, reaching down to wrap his hand around Dean's shoulder. He gets the hang of it pretty quickly, mumbling about it being
enough to keep him here with me once I knew you were coming? I'm the fucking Devil."
Dean nods his understanding. “Was this a month ago?” The kids nod. So the father was feeding them corpses until he died. “Why did you kill people? He had to have taught you how to scavenge from corpses.”
Benny takes the bottle, rolling his eyes and says, "Jesus, cher, if I wasn't the big boss, we'd've been fired ten times over by now."
The only thing that placates his thoughts is the knowledge that if the secret was something bad, they wouldn't keep it from him.
The examiner’s eyes widen a little like he’s just realizing that the Castiel is referring to might be
Dean's eyes flutter closed and he rolls onto his other side so he's facing Castiel, forehead pressed into Castiel's stomach. Castiel feels a heat grow in his gut that he recognises as arousal, yet he can't explain why.
Not long after God's destruction Jack's power had become unpredictable and dangerous again - at least, what was left of it, as the act of destroying God had severely depleted his Grace. With Castiel no longer an angel, the only person with enough power to help Jack control his own had been Rowena. Instead of simply teaching him control, Rowena had decided to turn him into her apprentice, using his power for witchcraft. Castiel didn't mind, really, as long as it was going towards something rather than spreading uncontrollably like a wildfire. Over the four months Jack had been living with Rowena he'd become rapidly proficient in magic, something Castiel could tell made Rowena very proud, but wouldn't admit to.
? What the fuck does that even mean. Dean replies with a line of question marks.
with a winking emoji attached to the end.
"We have to go back to Rowena's cabin, she needs to be warned."

Pancakes are easy, he's made them so many times he doesn't think he could get them wrong, even without measuring cups. He's spooning mixture into a frypan when Claire's finally had enough coffee to speak.
am I, what the
Dean watches their surroundings as Castiel pumps the gas into the car, body poised and knife held aloft, ready for any sign of danger. It's dead silent, not even the whistle of the wind, and everything is so still. The sun beats down on his skin, and sweat springs from his hairline, dripping down his skin. He's so determined, concentrating so hard, that when Emma rolls her window and whispers to him, "dad, I have to go to the bathroom," he almost jumps out of his skin.
She shrugs her shoulders. “My dad doesn’t know about monsters, I never told him. So unless you want to have
“Where are we taking them until Bess gets here?” Castiel asks as they’re helping the three kids into the backseat of the Impala. “And we need something for them to eat.”
"What do you mean?"
Dean climbs to his feet, heading for the bottle of whiskey in the bag, resolutely trying to hide his stupid erection and willing it to go down. He's not a pup, he's a fully grown wolf and he can
Castiel chuckles, leaning forward to kiss Dean again, sucking Dean’s bottom lip into his mouth, sinking his teeth into the flesh gently. Dean makes a noise in the back of his throat and surges forward to kiss Castiel harder. Castiel slides his arms around Dean and holds him close, licking the taste of cherries from the angel’s mouth until the taste of him is all that’s left.
“The second one…” the oldest (who still hasn’t dropped his name) begins, eyes turned down and face red. “He tried to… he thought I was a…” he shakes his head. He won’t look Dean in the eye anymore like he’s terrified of Dean’s reaction to hearing a middle-aged man tried to pick up a kid, like Dean would be angry at him. Dean was only a year younger than him the first time it happened to him.
That is until Castiel stops Dean as they’re driving to a diner three days after they first arrived in St Roberts. He points out a bush in front of a cafe, informing Dean that it’s Baby’s Breath. St Roberts isn't a particularly large place, and it doesn’t have a particularly large population, and this is the first time they’ve seen the plant. It has to be the one.
”Baby,” Dean murmurs, tracing his thumb over the curve of Castiel’s lips. Dean’s never known anyone as beautiful as Castiel, and he still doesn’t understand how he managed to make an
Castiel also grimaces, and despite the fact Dean has no idea what they're talking about he doesn't bother to ask. "So you think one of Endymion's daughters is the witch working with Lucifer?"
Castiel and Dean climb the stairs together, knocking on all the bedroom doors in the hallway, and telling the women to pack the essentials quickly and get downstairs. Alex doesn't answer, and when Dean peeks inside her room, he finds her gone. His heart thunders in his chest, terrified she's the one who's called the hunters.
Dean licks into Castiel's mouth and he responds in kind, tasting the inside of his mouth before pulling back to heave a deep breath. The freckles on Dean's cheek stand out against the red flush that has spread across them and Castiel wants to lean forward and press a kiss to each and every one of them, no matter how long it takes. He realises he's been just sitting there, staring at Dean's cheeks for an abnormally long time and turns up so their eyes meet. Dean is bemused and his eyes are crinkled in the corner.
But then it is enough. Dean thinks
Dean feels a vice close around his throat and though he's been choked out before -- and not in a fun way -- this time feels worse because his vision isn't fading, his lungs are still working, but the mess inside of him feels like it's going to kill him.
And then it's Jack and Dean and Cas bringing beer bottles to the kitchen, Jack telling Cas about the wild stuff he's up to upstairs, and Dean just looking at them like he was before, but this time Jack catches it.
"Dean," says Cas softly. "What did Chuck say to you that you have not already told me?"
There is nothing Dean Winchester hates more than destiny. Well, maybe the dry mouth he can't shake after a night of one too many drinks. Or when fries are soggy -- what's the point of fried food that isn't crispy? And also when some asshole leers at Baby like he's gonna break a window --
"You gave me the handprint." Cas looks away, though the smile is still at the edges of his lips.
Dean does what any rational man who denies the role of destiny in his life would do -- he ignores it. He ignores how it seems to gently pulse as he makes his way back to Sam and Bobby. He ignores how it throbs when he and Pamela do their disastrous ritual  -- the last look she ever gives him is one of knowing when he pulls up his sleeve. He ignores that, too. Or at least he tries to.
And then Cas is gone.
, what is he supposed to do with that?
The first time Dean is told that Castiel is dead he doesn't believe it. His gut reaction is to scoff because how can Chuck know better than Dean as to Castiel's whereabouts? Dean is his....well.
Cas looks at him this time and tilts his head in that familiar way. "Perhaps not in the moment, but yes. I came to realize quickly that I had bonded our souls together on accident." Dean lets out a breath. On accident. Well.
"Yes," he says. God, Dean wants them to talk about something less depressing, but he has to know more.
But -- a fucking classic, this one -- Dean gets out and Cas doesn't. The second that he gets back he feels it -- different than when Cas was dead the times before, but still gut-wrenching. It feels like he left a piece of himself in Purgatory. Which, well, he kind of did. And it makes him
"Cas..." he says softly, turning his hand so they're palm to palm on the table. Cas lets out a soft breath. "Cas," stronger now, green eyes on blue. Dimmer than when he was an angel, but still so, so blue.
that he wants Cas to stay and that Cas doesn't want to leave, but he makes it happen anyway because he's just not sure how to fight for something else. He tears down his own fantasy with his bare hands, and he thinks, selfishly, that even if Castiel is gone in this way Dean will know he's alive. Though Cas has fallen, the bond between them remains the same and Dean feels a sick sense of satisfaction that not even humanity could tear them apart. Only Dean can do that, apparently.
"Anyway," he says, not backing down now, "Chuck's telling me all this and I'm not sure why he is because he's rolling around in the dirt as we decide whether or not to gank him but then he gets angry all of a sudden, glaring at me. And he gets all quiet and he asks me if I know why he's telling me all this. And I'm like, Chuck, fuck if I know, man. Get on with it. And behind me I hear the kid say something real soft, and Chuck goes, 'That's right Jack. Cas.'"
Dean's throat goes a little dry and he bravely manages to keep his voice from cracking on the last word. He takes a sip of water.
Cas says nothing for a moment, but he looks tense, as if he's remembering something.
So Dean lets the night go by, everyone slowly drifting to the bedrooms they've claimed, filling this space that's now theirs to fill.
, Dean thinks, as Sam and Eileen are the last ones to disappear with a soft goodnight.
Dean's cheeks heat immediately. "Well shit, Cas, when you put it like that..."
"Cas," he manages. Both hands wrapped around his water glass, he tells himself to look up, that he's got nothing to lose here. Nothing to lose because he's already lost everyone before but now it's over and they're safe and nothing is hanging over them, not destiny, not God, not the end of the world.
But. Always a but in Dean's life because Winchester's don't get happy endings, remember? He should never have forgotten that lesson.
--  pulled him out of Hell.
"Yes, Dean," he says, his other hand joining the tangle they've made on the table, gripping each other desperately. "I know."
blue -- flick to his shoulder and back, as if they can see through his jacket, even through his skin to his very soul. It's almost enough to make him blurt out something like
So sue Dean for thinking it is a cosmic joke most of the time. And so when he lays eyes on Cas at the bottom of the front steps of a house that looked like a life Dean had not that long ago, not a hint of recognition in his blue, blue eyes, Dean wants to laugh. He want to laugh and he wants to punch God in the face. And, shit, even though it's as fucked as it can be, Dean inhales and it feels like the first breath he's taken in months.
He feels like he can now measure it in times Cas has died and come back. Times that he has been scooped out so wholly that he felt like collapsing and times when he has been yanked back to life by the invisible tether that exists in his soul. Despite how much the world falls apart around him, the people they lose and the once they gain, the times they fail and the blood he washes off of his hands, it all comes back to Cas. And fuck if that doesn't make him guilty -- to let everything in him be consumed by just one...guy. One angel. His soulmate. Fuck.
Though Dean has to amid that he tends to ignore anything that Cas does that might make him hopeful that them being soulmates is something they could...act on, sometimes it gets too much to ignore. And when he's on his knees -- on his knees
When Dean had come out of the motel bathroom a few minutes after midnight , he put on a neutral face for Sammy, though something deep inside him stung a bit. Figures that the universe would deem him unlovable, huh?
"Did you know it was a soulmark?" Dean blurts out. Fuck, he can't believe they've never talked about this.
And when it's over, after Sam leaps into the hole in the ground and as blood drips down a million openings on his face and Dean wonders how long it'll take him to die if he just sits here, Castiel's fingers touch his forehead and the surface wounds of what might be the worst day of Dean's life heal. The numb of his shoulder disappears immediately. When they're in the Impala after -- driving somewhere, always fucking driving somewhere, thinks Dean -- and Castiel asks him,
"Is that how you knew that you had...bonded us? Because you could see the mark when you pulled me out? Or did you feel it?" he asks.
Because looking down and seeing the thing he's fought, the thing he's been taught to spit in the face of, the thing that ruined his family...well. He's not about to do something wild like deal with it.
"Nah, Sammy." At his crestfallen face, Dean had rushed to reassure him. "S'okay though, not like just anyone can be thrown into this life. Plus how'd I find them, with how much we're on the road? They really dodged a bullet here." He had plopped down on the bed next to his brother, slinging his arm across his shoulders, hoping he wouldn't comment on his lack of specificity (Dean hadn't known he was going to say it until he did). "But don't worry about you, Sammy. If any Winchester was going to be picked by destiny and have it work out, it's you."
Dean doesn't look at him as he thinks about it. What is there to lose by admitting it? If he can't be honest with himself in Purgatory, he doesn't deserve to find Cas anyway.
When Castiel enters the barn and everything changes, Dean's mark pulses in time with his heart. But he's thinking about other things, understandably, though something deep inside him stretches taught when Castiel's eyes -- blue,
Anyway. Dean hates destiny. Which is why he was just fine when his 18th birthday came and went and not a single thing appeared on his skin. Had something showed up, Dean would have taken great pains to hide it from John, who wore a thick leather bracelet over the pale grey soulmark on his wrist. Dean's memory wasn't good enough to remember it when it was just a raised pink shape -- when it had matched the one on his mom's wrist before that burned away along with all of the possibilities of their happy life.
"You know, this bond...thing," he says, pulling his hand away for just a moment to gesture in the air between them, "it made me uh, connected to you. I think. In a way that meant that I felt it every time you died."
Dean knows that without the gentle burn in his soul he won't be warm again -- not even later, as he stands by the pyre that burns Cas, that burns away all the chances Dean has missed, let go, spurned, the pyre that Dean considers throwing himself into, just for a second. He closes his eyes and all he can see is the blade through Cas's chest, the light of his death almost blinding but Dean couldn't look away, had to witness what he had nightmares about, the thing he'd seen before but this time was the truth.
The handprint is what he imagined a soulmark to be.
and honestly, isn't that the same in Winchester speak? And it's just the fucking thing, actually, and Dean is clutching Cas and Cas is cupping his face and then it's over. It's over but it's also just starting and Dean feels like collapsing because what is he meant to do now? Surely Cas understands. Does he need Dean to say it again? He will, he thinks. He will, if it means they can start now.
Castiel frowns and asks, “Why did you never say anything?”
, watching something on TV that Castiel doesn’t recognise. He sits down next to him wordlessly.
"What year is it?" When Claire tells him that it was made in 1960, Dean tries to remember the usual causes of an engine that won't start in a car made that long ago. It's hard without being able to see the engine, but he had a '58 Mustang in a few months ago with an alternator that hadn't been returning the power back to the battery. Even fixing the cables hadn't helped, when it normally would. Bobby had told him pre-70's alternators for Mustangs were a load of shit, and if he came across another to replace it with a new one without bothering to check the wires. "If she'll let you, get a replacement alternator, do you think you could replace it yourself?"
. Lucifer, the
. The sparks of pain spread out through Dean’s body and he feels his muscles jerk with the impact. Castiel hits him hard enough to hurt, hard enough to make it sting, to leave marks, but not to leave welts. Welts will suck.
"I went out with Cas, we were going to go out again on Saturday." He tries to take a steadying breath, but it comes out shaky, and he can feel himself crack. "Fuck, his ex was abusive, he's probably running for the fucking hills-"
-*-*-
“Son of a bitch.”
“Later, then.”
Sam doesn't need to say anything. Rowena comes down the stairs, beautifully dressed as always, but with a large purple bruise on her throat that Dean knows she could have hidden but either had forgotten to, or didn't want to. Going by the smug expression on her face, it's definitely the latter.
A burst of laughter is startled from Castiel. "What do you mean?"
The door opens, just a crack, and Benny pokes his head in. "Can we come in, cher?"
Castiel takes the toy from Dean and turns it over in his hands. “I don’t want to kill a kid, Dean.”
"You drank all my whiskey, and I don't remember the last time I had anything resembling a vegetable. Werewolves need them too, you know." He gets another peck to his shoulder and Dean brushes the bird off so he can find the human money he keeps in his bag for when he goes into town. He gets most of it from hustling pool at bars, something he's surprisingly good at for someone who's never lived in a human society. He undresses and gathers his clothes, shoes and money in a canvas bag before he shifts into his wolf, taking the bag in his jaws.
Castiel still looks completely confused and possibly slightly terrified of them both, but he still rattles off his order - a turkey and cranberry sandwich after Dean suggests it - after Dean and Benny have. When Jo's gone, Castiel looks at Dean with wide eyes and says, "What the hell?"
Castiel doesn't reply again, instead he gets to his feet and starts pulling his jacket off, then leans down to untie his shoes and pull them off. He stops at the fastenings of his jeans, his face going darker, and says, "Could I borrow a pair of pants?"
“Well take them back to the hotel? And I think I can produce a dead body for them to eat,” Dean replies, reaching behind him to touch the wound on the back of his head. It’s deep and he’s still bleeding, and he thinks it might need stitches.
Dean purses his lips. "I doubt that." Rowena smacks him in the shoulder and he hisses, "What?"
“Perks of my thousands of years experience as a soldier,” Castiel replies. He sighs thoughtfully before he continues. “Does Dean feel the same, or is his body simply identifying me as a potential mate?”
Dean stirs as Sam's shutting the door and mutters, "Wassat?"
?” Dean asks as Buffy and the blonde-haired vampire are fighting (Melody? Rhapsody? Harmony? Who fucking knows). “Also, do you wonder if Joss Whedon knows about monsters? I mean, he’s taken liberties, but there’s way too many truths for it to be a coincidence.”
"Dean, fuck," Castiel groans, threading his fingers in Dean's hair and tugging until it stings, trying to meet his thrusts. He's getting close, Dean can smell it on him, so he wiggles a hand in between the both of them and gets it around Castiel's cock to jerk him off as he thrusts up into him.
Castiel must know what giving Dean permission to knot him will do to Dean because his grin is sharp and smug when a low primal groan tears its way out of Dean's mouth. Dean anchors himself with a hand on the tree trunk beside Castiel's head as he begins pounding roughly into the angel's body. He feels his knot catch on Castiel's hole, feels the power he uses to make himself looser, slicker, so he can take Dean without pain. Dean's gut grows warm, his muscles tensing as he comes, his knot growing bigger, locking them together.
Dean asks, taking a gulp of his beer before leaning over the table to shovel a forkful of food into his mouth.
Dagon and Lucifer only try to come back in once, giving in when Kelly's eyes glow with that heavenly Nephilim fire from the child inside of her. He's not even born yet and he's already taken a pretty strong stance on how he feels about his father. Dean likes the kid already.
Castiel looks confused, and he doesn't speak for a long time. "You're very different. I didn't think people could change as much as you seem to have. I accept your apology."
Sam's too tired to argue, and just lifts the baby bag off of his shoulder and onto Dean's, poking at one of the side pockets before he collects Eileen from the lounge room and takes her into the spare room. Dean takes the two girls into the kitchen and gets Deanna to hold Mary for a minute while he gets the food out of the oven, taking her back while he dishes a plate for himself and one for Deanna.
"C'mon, Cas, want you to come for me," Dean grunts into Castiel's mouth, belly so warm and tense. He's close, too, he doesn't think it'll take him long, but he wants Castiel to come first, so he doubles down on his thrusts and then tightens the grip he has on Castiel's cock. "C'mon, baby."
Dean laughs again and pats his thigh in a way he always does when Castiel doesn't understand something; it makes him feel naive, but strangely, he never hates it. "It's okay, Cas, I can't always tell when someone's being sarcastic either." Castiel isn't sure he believes that - Dean always seems to understand the subtle nuances of social etiquette - but he doesn't argue. He's figuring out how to begin the conversation with Dean that he's been meaning to have for days now when Dean speaks again. "Hey, do you want to go on a hunt, just you and me? If I have to deal with Sam and Eileen's baby bubble one more day I might just become a demon again," Dean says with a grin. Then, when Castiel has stared at him with a strange mixture of confusion and horror for long enough and is just about to say something, Dean bursts into laughter. "That was another joke, Cas."
"Aren't you a little too old to be acting like a first grader?" Dean asked while Cas and Gabe sent a confused look.
Taking a deep breath, he wished to see Jack. Within a nonexistent heartbeat, Dean was transported outside God's office. He walked in to see Jack giving orders to angels for fixing heaven and redesigning hell. Apparently, Jack has watched The Good Place and he wanted to see if he can change the souls down in hell. Kids are such optimists. As the door creaked open, Jack snapped his head up.
It was over. Death was, in the most literal sense, at their doorstep. Dean and Castiel had managed to buy more time by hiding in the dungeon but soon that would be over too. Amongst the fear and panic, Castiel started to feel a sense of peace. He was going to die with the man he loved. Suddenly it clicked for him. The angel of the lord, the angel of Thursday, Castiel was in love. He was in love with the man he had sworn to protect from the first moments of his existence. If Cas could find it in himself to be happy about this, he could save Dean. Maybe it wasn’t all over.
"I didn't say anything to that black bitch."
Dean shrugs. He's perpetually nosy and also wants to know about the guy who made Dean decide to admit his sexuality to his father rather than be outed against his will, and face the consequences. Also, Castiel's hot as fuck, definitely gay and quite possibly available, and Dean's not one to let that lie. "Just tell me."
Dean nods his head and flicks open the cap of the bottle of lube. He slicks his fingers with the liquid and tosses the bottle aside before wriggling down so he’s lying between Castiel’s thighs. He fingers him open carefully, but quickly, efficiently, making sure Castiel’s ready before Dean removes his fingers and swaps their positions. He piles the pillows behind his head so he’s lying slightly elevated, takes off his briefs, and then pats his thigh.
"Someone
“It’s okay Dean, I know you have important things to do in heaven.” Dean has his hand rested over Castiel’s heart, his chin braced on top. He’s studying Castiel like he does sometimes, when he’s trying to figure Castiel out, as if he is some intricate puzzle. As if he doesn’t already know everything about Castiel. “How’s everything going upstairs? You obviously had time to come down and visit me so it must be going well.”
Sam looks pointedly at his sleeping brother and says, "So, Cas, anything you'd like to tell me? There's fifty bucks with my name on it just
"I don't trust Gabriel, Cas, and I don't trust Crowley, and we can't put the humans in danger. We've already put them in too much," Dean shakes his head and lets it fall into his hands, sighing heavily. "We have to get him back, Cas. We promised Kelly - I promised I would look after him."
"Could be a few things, I'd have to pop her open and take a look. Noticed anything else?" Dean says, pulling the hood up and propping it open. When Castiel doesn't reply Dean looks over at him. He looks confused, not sure what to say, so Dean starts listing off as many other symptoms as he can think of.
Gabriel has to obscure himself and Castiel from prying angel senses before the two can go into Bobby Singer's personal heaven and retrieve his soul. They then have to sneak the soul out of heaven and put it back into Bobby's body. There are so many cracks in the plan, and it doesn't even account for the possibility of Michael or Raphael sensing them. It worries the fuck out of Dean.
Rowena lets Dean take it, study it. Despite Dean not being able to perform magic himself, he spent so many years around magical beings that he can feel the magic that surges from the pages, sending tingles up his arms and making his hair stand on end. It's strong, like no other grimoire Dean's ever touched before. He opens it, flicking through the pages carefully - yellowed with age and ripped in places, ink a little smudged on some words and images. "I can feel how powerful this book is, Rowena, why would they give something like this to you?"
Castiel opens his mouth to answer, but Jack beats him to it. "I'm a boy, can I come?"
"Claire knows her limits, and she knows if she goes over them, we go home and she gets dumped into bed," Castiel replies, to which Claire nods, taking the first drink of her beer. "Jack's allowed to have one drink with dinner on special occasions, but he hasn't found an alcohol he likes the taste of yet. I'm hoping it'll stay that way."
over and over. Finally, the other man's words filter into his brain. "What do you mean
"Thanks for the food. And the furs," Castiel says, blinking up at Dean.
"Where's Jack?"
Dean takes it as acceptance when Castiel gives him a bright smile.  He rips open the packet of chocolate and snaps off the first line, putting a piece in his mouth. Dean tries to ignore his body's reaction to Castiel's face and the noises he's making. Castiel glances up from his second piece and says, "Can I ask you something?"
"Dad?"
Dean smacks Benny's shoulder, eyes wide, and says, "Did you - did he just say that?" Benny nods, his eyes just as wide as Dean's and Dean reaches over for his phone on the bedside table. He types out a text message into their group chat and hits send without hesitation.
Sam appears first, sitting at the table next to Jack, clapping a hand over his shoulder in greeting, and smiling over at Rowena. Castiel hands the pot of pasta to Dean who places it on the table, then the pile of plates, then the salad Dean begrudgingly made (after a fair amount of complaint). There's still most of a bottle of wine in the fridge and Castiel grabs that while he's reaching for the beers. Eileen looks nauseous again when she enters the room, she’s a bit pale and looks like she might vomit, the way she’s looked on and off for days. Castiel's suddenly reminded of the hours Kelly would spend in front of the toilet the closer she got to her due date. She often complained about having to go through the morning sickness again, and not being told that it could reoccur.
"One for Claire?" He asks carefully, taking out a fourth bottle out and waving it in the air slowly, careful not to shake it up too much.
Oh okay, yeah he’s
-*-*-
Castiel sighs, stroking Dean's hand with his thumb. "It's not like that, Dean. It's not a normal childbirth-related death. The Nephilim's power overtakes them - they can't possibly survive that."
The feeling in Dean's gut that he knows Bobby from somewhere hasn't gone away. In fact, the longer he spends time with the man, the stronger it gets. The way he talks, his mannerisms, that stupid ratty cap. Dean can't get it out of his mind.
“Are they coming?” She asks through a yawn so wide Dean hears her jaw crack.
Two items of clothing aren’t necessarily a pattern in a household that regularly shares clothing, but it’s certainly annoying. He really liked that hoodie. After a few hours of looking he shrugs it off, deciding it’ll do the rounds and be returned to him when it’s ready.
Dean doesn't want to talk, but he does shift back, climbing to his feet and shoving Castiel back against the tree with a hand on his chest. He angles his head down and kisses Castiel until the angel stops trying to argue and instead takes Dean's face in his hands, deepening the kiss with his tongue. Dean reaches up to start unbuttoning Castiel’s shirt, sliding his hands through the sides as he pops each button one by one. He pushes the shirt from Castiel’s shoulders, pulling it out from between him and the tree and dropping it on the bag of Dean’s clothes. Castiel’s hand slides from Dean’s cheek into his hair, fingers scratching at his scalp until a shiver runs down Dean’s spine.
It rings through three times before it's answered, and Rowena doesn't pause before she says, "Dean? Whatever's the matter?"
"It's one of the Four Horsemen," Gabriel interrupts. "Death."
The room glows with golden light as he pulls the baby out by its shoulders, almost blinding him. He can't tell where it's coming from, everywhere and nowhere at the same time, and it washes over him, warm and calming like the ocean in the tropics or a fire in the dead of winter. Kelly’s eyes are golden still, and light streaks up her chest, over her face in the form of yellow lightning. She's dying, he can smell it on her, the way her organs are shutting down, her pulse slowing. Dean lays the baby over her chest, reaching up to brush her damp hair back from her face. Her eyelids are drooping, and a shaking hand reaches up to stroke over the baby's head, the golden blonde curls matted down to his head with blood and amniotic fluid. It's rather disgusting, he's still not very good with bodily fluids.
"Why would he do this to me?" Castiel asks.
“Up you come, buddy.”
He's just about to bite into the leg of a demon and tear it away from Jody when a familiar scent invades his nostrils.
It takes getting Garth on the phone to convince the kids to pack their things up and come with them. They’re still terrified, yet they’re still trusting Castiel and Dean enough to follow them.
He pulls the remote from Castiel’s hand, grinning, panting for breath, and says, “And that is why you don’t miss sparring sessions.”
"I'm taking Benny to my brother's for Thanksgiving, Elizabeth is with her mom. Do you guys want to come? It can be a boyfriend-slash-lover thing or just a friend thing. I don't want you guys hanging round your mum's creepy old house all day."
“I don’t know what I’m doing,” Castiel says, throwing his hands up into the air, the two ends of the untied rope still held in his fists.
"Crowley." Dean nods solemnly. Patience's head whips around to look at him, as do the others'. He suspects they've never known who the perpetrator was before. "Fergus MacLeod, also known as Crowley. We suspect he works with the Men of Letters."
Dean’s grin is toothy as he climbs off of Castiel and disappears in the direction of the hallway. Castiel stands and goes in search of the keys for the truck, leaving Gabriel and Claire a note on the coffee table. In it, he tells them he’s healed and is with Dean in case they wake before he returns. Castiel isn’t stupid enough to think they aren’t going to know exactly what he and Dean are doing, so he doesn’t bother coming up with a convincing lie.
"I'm not sure the four of us will be enough, Dean."
Dean comes first, groaning Castiel's name against his throat, his body squeezing tight around the angel's cock. He shivers through the aftershocks, through Castiel's continued thrusts, and he’s just starting to become too over-sensitive to bear when Castiel finally groans and spills into his body. Dean slides his hands from Castiel's back to take Castiel's face into his hands, panting into his mouth as he kisses him, much more interested in the touch of Castiel's tongue on his than trying to get his breathing back to normal.
They set up camp in a small Missouri forest for the night, tents and lawn chairs around a fire, circled by tin cans on strings to warn them if someone or something approaches. Dean makes them a dinner of ramen with tinned vegetables, which isn't all that great, but it's not like they've got any better. Dean misses steaks and burgers.
"We haven’t talked about a lot of the things we should." Dean looks over at him, frowning, because yes, they really haven't but he really needs Benny to be specific right now. "It had to have hurt, cher, when I couldn't give you what you needed. And you still stuck around."
"You're right, there were."
He’s proved right when Dean whispers,
Benny shoves him up onto the edge of the desk and undoes his pants, reaching in to pull out his cock. He's about to pour the lube onto his cock when Dean says, "Hey, no, I am
"I don't like that look on your face," Benny says, squinting suspiciously at Dean. "Wipe it off."
"They tried to clone dinosaur DNA? That's hilarious, what did they plan to do with one if it took?"
When Benny joins him, he gets the distinct impression that Benny thinks he's asked him in here for sex, so straight away he says, "Not here for a booty call. I did something without thinking and I had to let you know, you know, before anything happened."
-*-*-
"Were they ever cursed like Castiel is? Stuck shifting with the sun?"
"What do you mean?" Castiel asks, eyebrows knitted together.
When he gets to the bar it's full for the lunch crowd, people chattering and music just loud enough to be heard over everyone. Benny's at the bar serving a customer and Dean catches his eye, jerking his head towards the office. Benny nods his understanding and Dean goes to the office to wait for him.
He doesn’t leave until he’s placed a gentle kiss on the top of Jack’s head and pulled both Gabriel and the newly woken Claire into hugs. Castiel’s heart clenches as he watches, and he can’t fight the smile that tilts his mouth. By God, he is stupid for him.
children.
"Don't worry, bud, I'm on it," Dean says, which only makes Castiel blush darker and hide his face in his hands. Claire is looking up now, head tilted to the side in a perfect replica of Castiel's confused head tilt and he just shoots her a smile, which she rolls her eyes at.
Castiel lets out a breath he didn't know he was holding and nods vigorously. "Please."
“I am unsure. I am unaware of a being that could teleport us into another world. Perhaps an archangel, but all known archangels are currently incapacitated,” Castiel replies, a thoughtful look on his face. “Perhaps Gabriel is not dead after all? This seems very much like one of his games.”
, Dean."
Dean pours Lionel another beer then turns back to the kitchen window to see if there are any orders he can take out before he goes back to Castiel and his kids. Jack's vegan bolognese is on the counter, as well as Castiel's onion rings and a chicken burger with no mushroom from another table. He takes all three, leaving the chicken burger in front of a kid who can't be much older than six, sitting at the table with his mom and dad. Dean doesn't recognise them, so he suspects they're travelling.
"Anytime they've gotten involved with humans they've devastated entire civilisations," Dean says to Castiel before turning back to Rowena. "No."
Castiel's head falls to the side and thunks against the headrest as he sighs. "It's gonna cost me, too, huh?"
Dean frowns suspiciously at Castiel. “Okay… well, where to start? The archangel Gabriel trapped my brother and me in – I dunno, TV-World? – to convince us to agree to become the archangel Michael and Lucifers’ – you know, the devil? – their vessels. Insane enough? Or what about that time I got ghost sickness and was afraid of literally
"Also," Dean says, a little louder, feeling calmer and less self-conscious with their hands on him. "I don't like that she was looking at you like a piece of meat. Only me and Cas are allowed to do that."
“We didn’t hurt good people, only bad people, I promise,” Dale says, her eyes still wet with tears. She’s so little and so scared, and Dean’s heart hurts for her.
Dean nods. "Well, do you have questions or do you just want me to break it down?" When Benny doesn't reply Dean suspects it's the latter. "Well, I could go on all night about the nuclear family and the conservative idea that the only possible - the only correct family - is one with a straight married couple and their children, but I don't think that's what you want to know." When Dean looks over at Benny he's shaking his head. "Personally? I feel more comfortable in tightly knit polycules, which is closer to a single relationship with multiple partners, but there are other kinds, there's really no way to get it wrong. Some people have multiple relationships with multiple people, and they have relationships with others, people you don't have a relationship with - they're called metamours by the way. If we go ahead with Cas and you decide you don't want to be involved with our relationship then he would be your metamour, and the same for you bein' his." Benny looks over at Dean and nods, like he's letting Dean know he's understanding and he wants Dean to continue. "I guess you could say that poly relationships involve more communication than non-poly relationships, but that wouldn't really be true, it's just a different kind of communication. We're human, we aren't immune to jealousy and insecurities, we all worry that we're not enough for the people that we love. Even in a two person relationship you can never be absolutely everything for one person. It's unrealistic."
Dean frowns, a bit taken aback and hurt by the new knowledge. “Why?” He asks.
"Complicated?"
. Even on their worst days he and Sam could always afford a hotel room.
With nothing to input, no ideas of safe places for them to continue to, Dean simply replies, "Sure."
"Dean," Castiel says very gently, pulling Dean out of the car by the wrist when they finally stop. "You are covered in blood."
Dean loves babies, don't get him wrong, but he's also pretty sure he'll never have any of his own. His sleep schedule is shitty on it's own and he remembers how awful he felt when he had Deanna over when she was little and he could never get her to stop crying. It absolutely broke his heart. Mary's a far calmer baby than Deanna ever was, even at ten weeks old, but she got knocked over by early tooth growth and she's been crying every time he's seen her over the last week.
“Yeah, Cassie’s waiting for you at the bunker. He was super nervous, though. Something about hoping that he wouldn’t have to face you again.”
Sam and Cas reached a few minutes early so they decided to finish preparing breakfast. Dean walked into the kitchen and froze. Sam had fresh tears in his eyes as he went over to hug Dean. Dean patted him on the back.
"Cas and I are together." Dean said. His heart was racing. He knew Sam was less judgmental about this stuff than most other hunters but his brother's approval meant the world to
"Yes, I would like that a lot." Dean adjusted himself so he was sitting up against the headboard. He moved over, gesturing for Cas to sit beside him. Dean took a deep breath and
“Whoa whoa whoa! Babe, I am just kidding. Of course I love you! Please never take anything I say seriously. I am so sorry.”
"A little angel told me you needed me." Gabriel said after a moment. Sam nodded slowly.
"No, you are fine. Just deep in thought, I guess." Sam responded.
I do not condone violence and what Sam did is not a healthy way to deal with these emotions but John Winchester is a piece of shit
The quote in hindi is a real quote. I think that is exactly what Dean's doing.
Sam and Castiel were both at a loss of words. They wanted to stop Dean from this but they knew he was right. If Dean had fallen in love with a human, he could be with them in the afterlife forever. It really wouldn't be fair that Castiel and Dean had a threat of splitting apart. With that thought, an idea passed over Sam.
“Yeah, he was raised in a cult that he recently managed to escape from.” Sam said quickly. It wasn’t entirely a lie.
In May, Dean and Cas went on a dangerous hunt where Cas had almost gotten killed. The demon they were tracking down happen to have an angel blade. It just barely grazed Cas before Dean stabbed the demon. Dean caught Cas before he could fall to the floor. In a moment of panic, Dean took his wedding band off and put it on Cas giving him the small grace it had. That had been enough to save Cas’ life but not enough to heal him. Dean brought him back to the bunker and patched him up.
"Us?" Sam asked.
"You couldn't have protected him. You were 6 months old when it all started." Castiel reasoned.
Dean nodded politely. He decided to give this Brandon dude a chance. So far, he had been fairly nice, despite how awkward Cas was and how aggressive Dean had been, himself. Pushing the lump in his throat down, he took a seat in the station next to him and forced himself to look less intense and suspicious. It worked for about 5 minutes until Brandon started making small talk while cutting Cas’ hair.
"Dad," Sam said, an eerie understanding dawning on him. Gabriel squeezed Sam's hand tighter under the breakfast table.
"You stay here. For Dean. This isn't about your personal vendetta against your father. This is about helping your brother. So you stay here and ask what he needs. You help patch the wounds and replace the dressing. You comfort him like a little brother would. Don't forget was Cassie said. You are the reason he kept surviving. You pushed him to live. Keep doing that. And I am here for you. Whatever you need."
"Gabriel, are you sure you want to do this?" Castiel asked.
"But I-" and everything turned black.
"First of all, we never had sex. Not even close. The empty was a difficult time and we just became friends. Secondly, you did help  me in that mental hospital. Any time my
“Cas! Where are you?” Dean yelled cautiously. After shining the flashlight around, he began to walk. It was too silent. He started to hear every noise his body could make, him breathing, his stomach digesting the food, even the blood rushing to his ears. Dean couldn’t take it anymore and decided it would be best if he called out to Cas instead.
Sort of half angelic." Jack said.
"Wait, you really are jealous." Dean relished this moment.
“Not yet. I will, though. I won’t make him do anything he doesn’t want to do. At the same time, I won’t let him risk his life like this again. Jack still hasn’t figured out how to keep
"No, he doesn't. He can't hate you because you protected him. He is just angry and you were the only one he could take it out on."
"I really fucked up with Jack, didn't I?" Dean asked in a resigned voice.
“I don’t fucking know, Gabe!” Sam yelled. Dean stepped back and took a seat. He was going to enjoy this argument. If only he had some popcorn.
“What did your son major in?”
Yet here they were, at the altar on 14th February 2021. It was a lovely outdoor wedding outside of Roadhouse in heaven. Since Dean was technically dead in the eyes of the law and Cas never existed, Jack suggested that they could have the ceremony up there. People from Earth and hell were invited, not to mention the people from heaven too. Ash and Ellen had spent so much of their time and energy setting up. It was a beautiful venue. The only absentee was John Wincherster. Dean knew that on this happy occasion, he should be surrounded by people that love him, not those that used him like a ‘blunt little instrument’ when they couldn’t cope with their feelings.Sam and Gabe were the best men, obviously,
"Dean? What are you doing here?" he asked. When Jack said he was going to keep his nose out of the human world, he meant it. Jack had blocked all prayers and refused to get information from Earth, kind of like Hydrogen from The Good Place.
"Yeah, I took Jack. He needed to apologize to her and he couldn't face her alone. She is the first person he redesigned heaven for."
“What do you mean?”
“I understand, but it's still protocol. We want to make sure we clean the hair properly so we don’t contaminate our hair tools.” Brandon explained gently. Cas looked over at Dean and he nodded.
“Of course.” Cas and Dean followed Sam to the main floor where Cas was greeted by his stylist.
"Sure babe, as long as I have you, I don't need that."
"Come in," Jack said. Castiel opened the door to see Jack sitting on the bed, thinking. It was hard to believe that this was God and not the same lost Jack he had taken care of all this time. After arriving at heaven, Jack remade the bunker there. It was the only place he knew to be home and wanted that in heaven. Jack didn't need to eat or sleep, he just kept the bed and beer for the sentimental value.
After Dean was sure that the Empty was gone, he allowed Cas to pull back. He wrapped Cas in a hug and pulled him close. Cas tucked his head in Dean’s neck. Dean kissed Cas on the top of his head.
Sam threw Jack a strange look. "I'm God. I can find out anything about everything in less than a second." Jack shrugged.
"No." Was all Sam could manage.
"I hated him, our dad, I mean. I hated him for what he did to me. What he did to Dean was way worse. And protect me? We fucking hunt monsters for a living. Why would Dean need to protect me from Dad who was nothing but a fucked up human?"
"Never again. I'm staying right here with you." Castiel promised.
“You may now kiss…Oh, okay, they’re just going for it.” Jack laughed as Dean pulled Castiel into a kiss. The two of them walked back down the aisle relishing their first moments as a married couple.
Castiel leaned his neck away and put his hand on Dean's chin tugging his face upward to meet his eyes.
"No." Cas responded a bit too quickly. He felt his cheeks heat up.
"Alright, alright, alright." Gabriel said after a minute. "It has to be me."
“Wow, Cas, you look great!” Sam encouraged. Cas beamed and turned to Dean with nervous anticipation.
“Dean?” he said, not exactly sure what he was asking.
“Oh, I haven’t really thought about it. I don’t even know what types of haircuts there are.”
"Oh. Anything we can do to help?"
movie date.
"Well, let's look at our criteria shall we? 1. Archangel (check). 2. Has to be accustomed to humanity (check). 3. Ends up being your soulmate but you want to be with someone else. That's completely fine by me. I am not a one man angel and we both can continue doing our own thing once this is done. (So checkity check check!)" Gabriel explained.
“I want him safe, alive and with me. We’re done. I’ll start looking for places for us to live once Cas gets back on his feet.”
"It's true. Dean had the talk with me after I thought I was going to have sex. It turned out that the girl had only wanted me so she could feed me to her zombie boyfriend. We were driving back from the case when he told me all about how to get girls to sleep with you." Jack interjected.
Castiel communicated to Gabe and Jack to follow Sam. The two of them were gone in a blink of an eye. This left Dean and Cas alone. Castiel knew what was coming as he led Dean to his room. As soon as Castiel settled next to Dean in the bed, Dean broke into sobs.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Come on, let's go." Gabriel sighed.
It wasn't the most chaste kiss. Whenever Dean had pictured this moment, he was a lot calmer, sweeter. Castiel deserved tender, slow, soft not the anger and the pain. Yes, this wasn't the kiss he imagined but it was memorable. First kisses were meant to be memorable, not perfect.
“Sorry. I… Those memories just kept rushing back to me during the drive and I couldn’t take it anymore. I felt like such an idiot.” Sam explained. Gabe nodded and waited for his boyfriend to continue.
"Yeah, that would be great." Sam said, surprised Gabriel came back. He was sure he wouldn't be seeing the former archangel for a while. Gabriel and Sam took a seat at the table and Gabe started explaining the basic wing properties. Dean and Castiel supervised, making sure that this didn't end with the first ever hybrid death.
"Sammy where the hell are you going?" Dean called out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Jack performed the same ritual on the other pair, bonding them for eternity.
over us because she took care of you, I wanted to ice her. I hated the fact that I left you alone. In that mental hospital and in the empty."
"Relax Cas! We, obviously, didn't go through with it. Jack was in these handcuffs and we were trapped in the basement. I used the angel blade on the handcuffs and Jack flew into the door opening it. We finally were able to talk her out of it." Dean was practically laughing at the fond memory.
“Is there anything you like in particular?”
Dean turned around to face Castiel. "Five more minutes, angel" he grumbled groggily. Dean snuggled closer to Cas, burying his nose in Castiel's neck.
"Sleep tight, you have a big day tomorrow. Just know that I am proud of you. I love you, Dean." Cas whispered before placing a soft kiss on his forehead. Dean seemed to relax more and more with touch as his pursed lips turned into a gentle smile.
“What do you think about wedding day?” Cas asked.
"Yeah," Sam said, nodding slightly.
By the time they were done, Gabriel and Jack arrived. It took them longer than anticipated because Jack wasn't an angry hunter who drove 30 miles above the speed limit. Gabriel and Jack had bonded pretty well and he easily became Jack's fun uncle. That wasn't too difficult as Gabe was Jack's only uncle who didn't want him killed or captured. Jack felt like a kid again. Every time he visited the bunker, he could sort of let go of his new responsibilities. Here, he wasn't leading angels or fixing the universe, he was drinking beers with his dads and driving a hot car with his uncle. He was something he could never be: a human, a child. Castiel seemed to have picked up on Jack's more relaxed attitude and insisted that he stay overnight. Sam and Dean surely didn't have a problem with that. Dean did throw a fit when he found that Jack parked Baby in the last parking spot near the curb because "no one puts Baby in the corner."
"Plus, if they die as angels, they would have to go to the Empty. If Dean and Sam still have their humanity, we could argue that they belong in heaven." Castiel added.
"Sam, in order for a soul to attend the reform program, they have to feel remorse. Your dad is reliving his worst actions but he hasn't felt guilt or regret. He only feels bad for what happened to him. Not the pain he inflicted onto... other people." Castiel explained. He looked up at Dean who was trying to maintain a neutral face for his brother.
"Oh yeah, she is a wood nymph the men of letters brought to basically be their moms. She wanted me and Sammy to kill Jack."
"You gave Jack 'the talk'? Please tell me it went better than when you had it with me." Sam laughed.
"Dean you have nothing to apologize for. It's that jackass that needs to beg for forgiveness." Gabriel finally spoke up. He knew Sam was in no position to console Dean but he also knew that Sam would regret not being there to support his brother. Dean nodded and silence passed over them as Sam took his time to process the information.
“I love you too, Dean.” Cas said when they pulled back.
"I know that, babe. Cas knows that too. Everyone knows that but Dean."
“Stupid angels think you can do what ever the fuck you want.” Dean mumbled as he stepped through. Sam and Jack continued to stare at them while Cas begged him to put him down.
“Hello, Jack.”
"What is it Dean?" Cas asked, tired of his boyfriend's immaturity.
"I'm sure. It's not real. Dean never left the bunker tonight." Gabe reasoned.
The three of them seated and Sam took in the environment. It looked like a typical office, except it was darker, more witchy and in the center of hell.
"No! You did this. You are the reason I ran away. Dean is the reason I stayed for as long as I did." He started punching a defenseless John. "You were supposed to take care of us. You left. Leaving Dean and me all alone. Dean wasn't supposed to replace mom. Dean needed you and you weren't there. You were hunting. You left him. I had him but he had no one. YOU are the reason Dean is so broken. YOU are the reason Dean wanted to kill himself as many times as he did. This is only on you. You left a 4 year old boy wondering what he did wrong to get his mom taken away and his father to leave only to come home to hit him." Sam yelled, still continuing to punch with every sentence. He kept hitting John for a couple more minutes until Gabe noticed him starting to get tired. Gabe got Sam off John and they both noticed that John hadn't even gotten a bruise. Gabe pulled Sam towards the door as he saw John stand up to resume his position.
“What did you think of your hair wash, Cas?”
"Well, I'm in." Dean said.
had Castiel's scent to sooth him.
September 18th 2020 would be a date to remember. It would be their 13th anniversary of the first time they met. So naturally, Dean takes him to the barn where they first met. He takes a picnic basket and they have a moon lit dinner outside the barn. With a little help from Jack, he was able to make sure that it was a clear night and the stars would look extra shiny. Cas was looking, animatedly talking about seeing each star be born from heaven. All Dean could do was smile at Cas. Castiel looked back to a love struck Dean and stopped his rambling. He felt himself blush and shy away from Dean’s gaze. Cas had fallen, he killed his own kin and yet he had this righteous man worship him with just a gaze.
