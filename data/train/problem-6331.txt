His voice trailed away, and Steve took a step back.  “I can wake him, if you want,” he said, ignoring the sting of rejection.  He tried for a reassuring smile.  “Give me a-”
“A little bit,” Steve admitted.
“Villages didn’t move,” Bucky grumbled, dropping another flask on the pile.  “You forgot where it was.”
“Tony.” Steve’s smile never wavered.  “I promise.  I’m-” He spread his hands.  “Healthy as a horse.”
Tony was nearby, sipping a coffee and chatting with Hank and Reed.  Steve was pretty sure that he should break it up anyway, there was only so long the three of them could go before they started to fight with each other.
“Bleeding,” Harris said, and took another sip of his water before setting it down.  He reached out, rubbing the cat under its chin.  “Why can’t you sleep, DJ?”
Slowly, deliberately, he refolded the page, smoothing the creases to a knife edge.  “Of course, this changes nothing.” With an almost offhanded flick of his hand, he tossed it into the fireplace.  “Officially, Happy’s in charge of security around here, but he’s not exactly good at the job.  Too friendly, or maybe not friendly enough.” He paused, his hands propped on his hips.  “He’s not suited to the job, I think even he would agree to that, so this seems like the perfect time to shift some people around.”
“Right,” Steve said, suddenly exhausted.  “The only thing I’d be beholden to is him.”
For the first time, Tony’s eyes came up, sharp and brilliant beneath the dark sweep of his brows.  “Tell me you have a gun on you right now,” he said, his voice patient.
Tony looked at the shattered remains of the plate.  “Right,” he said, pushing himself to his feet.  He was so tired that he ached, but he went down, his movements clumsy, to one knee, and started collecting the pieces.  “And how’s that working out for you?”
Steve slid the shield into its bag, tying the cord off with more force than was strictly necessary.  “Have you notified the police?”
“Pretty sure you can still get it working,” Clint said.  Rhodey gave him a look, and Clint pointed finger guns in his general direction.  “I have faith in you.”
“Thank you, Mr. Stark.”
“Right,” Tony grumbled.  He hovered by the couch, knowing he should leave before he got himself in trouble, but fuck it.  He made bad choices.  “You have dinner yet?”
Steve leaned forward in his seat.  “So they did it to catch us offguard.”
“Before you realized how big it was,” Tony finished.
She reached for the coffee pot on the stove.  “Figured breakfast time would be coming, soon enough,” she said, pouring a cup.  “And there’s jam to be made before everything goes off.”  She held the cup out to Steve with a slight smile.  “Fresh bread in a half hour or so, and since Hawkeye’s up on the roof keeping an eye on things, the main course will be oatmeal and eggs today, I think.”
Clint shrugged, his hands tucked in the pockets of his sweatpants.  “He had a nightmare.  We watched old sci-fi.”  He met Steve's eyes without flinching this time, clearly back under control.  “What's to say?  It happens.”
“Banner had that data,” Coulson said.  “When he's back-”
Ty’s lips curled back in a snarl.  “Despite your best efforts, no,” he said, and on the other side of the table, Justin shifted in his seat, his shoulders hunched forward.
“Wow,” Steve said, his eyebrows arched.
“Seatbelt better be on back there,” Harris said.
“Yes,” she said, drawing the word out, her hands fluttering nervously in front of her chest for a second before she corralled them again.  “It’s…  Yes.  It’s good that we have desserts.”  She said it firmly.  With feeling.  Like she was trying to convince him, or possibly just herself.  “The issue is, we have…  We have a lot of desserts.”
Tony huffed out a breath.  “He shouldn’t be worrying about that.”
Tony nodded, relief making the whole thing just seem ridiculous.  “Yeah.  That’s…  That’s something I did.  And it wasn’t even the stupidest thing I did in the last few days.”  He took a deep breath.  “I should’ve talked to you about it, before I did it, and I intended to, but then, well…”  He held his hand up in front of his face and made a ‘drinky-drinky’ motion.  “I got stupid.”
The door to the workshop swung open and Pepper strode in, her shoulders squared, her heels snapping against the floor.  “A week,” she said. “You couldn’t even make it a week.  I asked one thing from you, just one thing, and-”
The workman turned around, and Tony Stark glanced over his shoulder at them.  Steve stared up at him, suddenly achingly aware of how hard his heart was pounding.  Stark grinned at him, and there was a streak of grease along one of his cheekbones, plaster dust sprinkled in his black hair.  "So I do."  He stripped off his gloves, tucking them into his pocket before he hopped down off the table, the motion smooth and easy.  "Good afternoon, Officer Rogers."
“Let’s go,” Bobbi said, and though she addressed the group, she was looking directly at Steve, her eyes sharp.
Jarvis arched an eyebrow.  “And I maintain my family honor by pretending to be shocked every time someone brings it up,” he said.  He picked an invisible thread from the arm of his coat.  “If Clint can’t keep up with him…”
“I love how you try to be diplomatic,” he said with a grin.
Tony’s fingers rattled against the surface of the arc reactor.  “Are you going to put on pants?”
“Yes.” Tony said.
She stopped at the end of the line, her fingertip hovering over the shot of Steve Rogers, an embarrassed smile on his face, holding up his left hand to show off his ring.  Ellen tapped it.
“Right.” Rhodey peeked across the foyer.  Steve was sitting on the main staircase, DJ next to him, Furbro draped across the boy’s knees.  DJ’s attention was on the cat, Steve’s attention was on his feet.  Rhodey sighed.  “How’s Tone?”
Tony looked around, his eyes darting over the room, and Steve felt his shoulders go tight.  He refused to do the same, to even acknowledge how small, how dingy, how worn everything was.  How little he had to his name.
Jan sighed.  “Fine,” she said, a slight smile curving her lips.  “He likes you, too.”
Jarvis' lips twitched.  “Sir.  Children are just very small people.”
“Too many sketchbooks?” Carol asked.
Tony choked on a laugh.  “Oh, you did not,” he said, but it was a nice thought.  He grinned at nothing in particular.  “Let's not pretend you were a wallflower.”
“No, inappropriate would be teaching him extra swears in extra languages,” Bobbi told him.  “It’s an important life lesson in New York, Jarvis, people take you seriously if you can curse ‘em out in their mother tongue.”
“Right, I'm going to pretend I know what that means, and just-  You know, read this,” Sam said.
“How late am I?”
Hank glared down at his work.  “You’re mad.  He’s not.”
“We have a service, Steve.  They bring us groceries.   There’s literally no reason to go out for a gallon of milk.  Let alone to do it three times in a week.”  Tony pulled back, just far enough to meet Steve’s eyes.  “Or was it four?”
Steve nodded. “Clothes off. Now.”
“The Council of Lesbians and Steve is disbanded,” Carol announced, and someone chucked a balled up napkin at her.  “Your acts of political violence change nothing."
Steve took a deep breath.  “You rented a theater to see a movie?”
Steve smiled, a little of the fear melting away.  “I'll keep that in mind,” he said as the quartet started to play.  The song was soft and slow, a modern tune he felt like he should've recognized.  It had a melancholy feel to it, but somehow, it felt almost natural to be dancing to it.
Happy’s eyes darted in his direction.  “Ah, yeah.  Banner.”
“I will never forgive you for this,” Phil said, but he was smiling.
“You’re having a salad without dressing, and you’re washing it down with water?” Drew asked him.
“It’s all right, these things-” Tony started, as the kitchen door opened.
Tony struggled against a smile.  “How many baby teeth did I knock out, well ahead of schedule?”
Hitomi appeared behind him, studying Tony through the lens of the tablet. “Has he done his studies?”
“God, I hate this holiday,” Tony said, just to hear Steve laugh,  He arched up, his mouth catching Steve’s, letting the kiss linger.  “I’m closing for February next year.”
The upper hall was silent and still, light filtering up from the main floor and through the windows on either end of the house.  He paused, his hand sliding along the length of the banister, to look down into the great hall beneath him.  There was something ghostly about it, when it was empty and dark, the intricate woodwork and artistic flourishes casting long shadows across the stone.
Steve snapped the pocket watch closed and returned it to his pocket.  “Close enough,” he said with a smile.
“And when something fucks with that, something changes that,” he managed, the words tripping out, faster and faster, “when someone else is there and slips under your guard and manages to take on some of that weight, you don't notice that, either. It's like sunflowers on the table, it's a shock at first and then you fucking get USED to it, and that's the problem.
“Well.” Bobbi’s head tipped to the side.  “I never said I was smart.  Besides, The Kingpin’s a fair man,” she said.  “Prone to acts of unbelievable violence.  Possibly insane.  But mostly, fair.   And uninterested in his people’s private lives or histories, as long as they were loyal and made him money.”
The holograms lit her pale hair, casting icy shadows over her face.  “I think you are a man who is very well acquainted with fear,” she said, her voice soft.  “A man who has lived with fear, for his entire life.  After all, that is the curse of brilliance, is it not?  The average person walks the street, comfortable in their ignorance.  Something beyond their vision may kill them, but they’ll sleep peacefully until it does.
“It’s been a long day,” Tony said, gathering wine bottles in his arms.  They rattled against each other,  the glass gleaming in the reflected glow of the fire.  “A very long day.”
“I did it,” she agreed.  “Packed what I could, sold what I couldn’t, and showed up here, expecting-”  She stopped.
"Was that the 'don't punch a head of state' one or the 'mocking of others tech is only allowed when they're actively breaking one or more laws or international statutes' one?" Tony asked.
“Needed a workout,” Steve said, his voice tight.  He yanked the hood of his sweatshirt over his head.  “Figured I could have a hard run and then come back and meet up with you.”
He held his breath as the armor slid into place, the metal smoothing around him like a liquid, settling into place even as he fell, as he fell through the nothing and into something else entirely.
“Bet he managed to make his budget stretch to a few more things,” Steve said, moving back far enough for Tony to stand up.
“Everyone hates ties,” Jesse said. She raised her camera, snapping a sequence of photos before Steve could school his face into something approaching a smile.
Bucky gave him a hard look, but Sam was already moving towards the door.  He pushed it open, stepping aside so that Shuri, T’Challa, and finally Steve could enter as well.  Only after Bucky reluctantly stepped inside as well did he push the door shut with a firm, and final click.
“There are games in the lounge, s’mores and cocoa by the fire, the buffet is set up in the main dining room, white elephant gift exchange is set up down by the balcony entrance, and if you’d like to join in with the madrigal singing later on tonight, just let Jarvis know, and he’ll download the sheet music into your device of choice,” she said with a smile.
“Two’s better than one,” his father said, and DJ’s eyes flew open.
“In a manner of speaking,” Jarvis said.  “Also playing, in a manner of speaking.  I doubt he would mind company, if that is what you were inquiring about?”
Tony stalked into the kitchen, his phone in one hand and his head cradled in the other.  “I’m not dying.  Pep.  Pep.”  He dropped his hand, his head falling back.   His eyes squeezed shut.  “Virginia.  I’m not dying.”  His shoulders slumped.  “Yes.  Yes, I know I’ve said that before.  Yes.  I know it was a lie then, but it’s not a lie now, how many times do you think I’ll really lie about not, you know, dying?”
“Right.  You should-”
Jarvis stared at him.  "You may have some soup with your sandwich, sir."
And by ‘almost always,’ he meant…  Always.
“Wait,” Steve said.  His head swung around.  “Where's Jan?”
Tony flipped the chair around and sank down into it, balancing himself on the child-sized seat.  “Deej.”  DJ's eyes flicked up towards his, and Tony smiled at him.  “I'm sorry.  We're not going to do anything to your room without your permission.  We're not going to take your things.  This is your space.  You control it.”
Bruce tipped the book in his direction.  “Periodic table,” he said.
“Yes.”  Tony turned the water on.  “Apparently I fell asleep in the kitchen and he put me to bed.”
“I did move a little bit,” Tony said. “I moved this far. And that was far enough.” He smiled, and Steve felt that against his skin, and his arms tightened. “This... This is good.”
“Turns out, no, he’s not.”  There was a long pause.  Then, threateningly,  “This time.”
Steve looked up.  Mrs. O’Malley was standing on the sidewalk in front of their building, her youngest cradled against her chest, a shawl wrapped around them both against the evening chill.  She looked tired, her thin face drawn tight, but she smiled easily at Steve as he approached, bouncing the baby in her arms.  “Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes,” she said, and Steve couldn’t help but smile back.
“I'd say I've lost control of this situation,” Stark said to Jarvis, “but that would imply that I'd ever had control of the situation.”
“I think it's a good idea all the time, but I'm an idiot,” Tony pointed out.
Tony nodded.  “I won’t hold you to it.”
Steve's chin came up.  “Asking,” he said, and Luke nodded.
Steve looked up, his eyes dancing.  “I think I’m capable of doing both at once,” he pointed out, his voice stern.  He hipchecked the bedroom door open.  “Let’s bed.”
“Just an observation,” Steve said, because Tony was laughing into his chest now, and he could feel it, through his breastbone, through his whole body, warm and comforting and the realest thing he’d ever felt in his life.
“She says my Aunt Patricia says you’re a strange, strange man, but she’ll take you up on your offer.”  Rhodey dropped his phone on the counter..  He looked at it.  He looked at Tony.  “What did you say to my aunt, Stark?”
“I am a product of my upbringing,” Tony agreed, grinning down at his newspaper.
Steve tipped his head in Sam’s direction.  “We’ll work our way up to pool.”
“I got up to get a drink of water, and, uh, the Ancient One here was waiting for me just outside the bedroom door,” Harris said.  He rubbed a thumb behind the cat’s ear, and it let out a rusty growl of a purr. “I figured that it wanted pets.  So.” He shrugged.  “I’m not good for much, but I sure can pet a cat.”
“Does this mean that I get to choose one for you?” Steve asked, and Tony went still.
Her eyes went up, staring at the inside of the hat’s brim.  Tony wondered if it was as bad from her angle as it was from his.  “I kinda like it,” she said, folding her arms on the table.  “I mean, the color’s a little much, but-” She bounced up and down in her seat, making the brim bob.  “It’s fun!”
"You're late."
“It's the nature of things,” Obie told him.  He glanced over at DJ, who was still chewing, slow and careful, on a bread crust.  “Don't you want a few children of your own?”
“Yes,” DJ said.  He didn't seem especially concerned by that.
Bruce’s mouth opened.  Closed.  “Well, I mean-”
“I’m sure Fury’s-” Tony said.
"Went to try to recover his truck," Tony said.  "Since, you know, he forgot Kamala is a force of nature and now she's met Isaiah, which went far too well, so now they're plotting some sort of takeover of something, it might be the US Government, and Steve is absolutely fucked."
"You a good climber?" Peter asked, and DJ nodded.  Peter grinned, holding up the bushel basket.  "Wanna help me gather apples, then?  I could use some help."
Tony opened his mouth.  Closed it.  He leaned back in his chair.  “Well, who doesn’t like praise?” he asked, his voice flippant.
“Yes,” Steve repeated.  He shook his head.  “He's different.  Not better, not worse, just different.”  He huffed out a breath.  “Let me put it this way, Miss Potts.  Say you had a domestic who was a hard worker and a loyal one, who did most things well, but never washed the windows the way you wanted them washed.  And then one day, you realized that she was simply too short to reach them.”  He arched his eyebrows.  “Would you fire her and find someone taller?  Or would you just give her a stool?”
One of the Stranges stepped through, and DJ followed, disappearing into the light.  Rogers and Stark went together, and as they stepped forward, Tony saw them reach out, finding the others hand as if by habit or instinct.
"Doesn't it hurt now?" she asked.
"Because he needs to try this with another man," Sam said.  He spread his hands.  "Me."
Steve caught his arm, dragging him into the warm shelter of his body.  “Merry Christmas, Jarvis,” he said, capping it off with a yawn.  “What time is it?”
“That's a bit of a comedown from last year, isn't it?”
“There’s a cat up here,” Bucky said.
“Just out of curiosity, you doing anything later?” Trip asked her.
“Sometimes, I’ll take your hand, or you’ll touch me,” Steve said, and his voice was tight, “and your hands are cold.  And it-” He swallowed, his throat working.  “It’s like you’re slipping away from me, or that you’re already gone.”  His eyes closed, a flicker of stillness.  “And it scares me.”
“You're a good man, Jarvis,” Stark said, amusement twitching the corners of his lips.  He looked at Steve, one eyebrow arched.  “She will not give up, just put the jacket on.”
There was a beat of silence.“Uh-”
“Probably.”  Ellen reached for her tea pot.  She poured it, her fingers steady on the hot porcelin.  “Want some?”
“It's such a shame, we've not a bean left in the house,” she said without missing a beat.  She paused to kiss Peter on the cheek, then headed for the blanket.  “Welcome home, Miss Potts.  DJ, will you come here and put your marbles away?”
“She’s absolutely right,” Fury said from behind him.
“At this point?  I’m going to welcome the memory wipe.”
“And as soon as Romanov decides to get her ass in gear, we can get started,” Tony said, reaching for a piece of banana bread.
"She absolutely does.”
The capitol on the hill beckoned them home.
Bucky gave him a look.  “Or we could find a place with, I don’t know, intact walls.”
He'd gotten used to that first wave of flashes, the moment of pure blindness as everyone took that first shot almost simultaneously.  He's gotten used to keeping his face still, his smile bright.  Relaxed.  Amused.
Pepper leaned over the prep station.  “The database,” she repeated.
He took a seat at the bottom of the stairs, his elbows braced on his knees.  “He does that sometimes, but he’s always back by now.”  He squinted up at Steve, his eyebrows arched.  “You showing up seems bad, but not as bad as someone from the Board of Orphanages.” His toe bounced against the worn wood of the stairs.  “He dead?”
“Yes, sir.” He resisted the urge to fill in the rest of his ‘to-do’ list.  Obie didn’t like to cede control of the conversation.  “It’ll hold through the lambing season.”
“'On permanent loan'?” Tony finished for her.
“And I’m sure that he wanted you to think that,” she agreed.  She crouched down, her blunt fingernails tapping against a curl of copper tubing.  She made a considering sound under her breath. “I told him this would go badly.”
Everyone stopped, heads swinging toward Steve.  He met their eyes, one by one.  “That’s enough,” he repeated, and it was his field voice, the one he used when he needed their attention, when he needed their cooperation.  “There’s blame enough to go around here, and I don’t care about who’s going to shoulder the brunt of it.  All that matters is that we find him.”
Tony nodded.  “I absolutely will.”  He pointed at Jarvis.  “That goes double for you.”
Harris stalked into the suite, and Tony grinned.  “For off the rack?  They did a good job.”  He picked up a platter.  “Want a waffle?”
DJ grinned at him.  “Thank,” he said, picking it up.
“Lying is beneath you, Jarvis.”
He reached for the bottle, drinking straight from it this time.  “He spent his entire life trying to escape from here, though where he thought he was going to go, I never did know.”
It wasn't right.  But he was pretty sure he knew how to fix that.
She didn't move, her fingers locked on his with a surprising amount of force. “It's going to kill me, isn't it?”
“Hmmmm.” Jarvis gave him a sharp look, his eyes narrowed over the knife-blade of his nose.  “I do believe I mentioned yesterday that you had quite a schedule today, and that perhaps abandoning your work and taking to your bed would be best.”  He tapped a knuckle against the underside of Tony's jaw, nudging his head up.   “If I remember correctly, sir, you were less than swayed by my argument.”
“Sir,” Jarvis replied, a faint hint of amusement in the single dry word.  “Did you ring, sir?”
DJ made a face.  “He can,” he said, drawing out the word.
He yanked his pillow back down.
Tony snuggled down, his arms looping around Steve's neck. “Does that require me moving?” he asked.
Tony sipped his coffee, letting the warmth curl through him.  “I'm fine, Steve,” he said, and he sounded like he'd swallowed a frog.  He tried to clear his throat, which was never going to work, but he was stubborn and stupid.  “Stop asking.”
“I was dreaming that Steve was stripping me,” Tony said, and that was an understatement, that was absolutely an understatement.  Even now, the memory of it was enough to make his knees weak.  Steve's fingers, sliding over his skin, coaxing his clothing away, piece by piece, his mouth hot and wicked, his lips whispering soft, dirty words against Tony's skin.  Steve, his body swaying against Tony's, pressing close, rubbing against him with every movement.  Tony squeezed his eyes shut, struggling against a fresh wave of arousal.
“I’m going to need to see your invitation,” Stark said from the front pew.  He looked up at the SHIELD agents that were milling around the aisles.  “I do not tolerate gatecrashers.”
Tony was breathing hard now, his shoulders rising and falling with the force of it.  “Okay,” he said, and he sounded wrecked.  “Okay.  No.  That was a-”  His eyes shut, and he exhaled a slow, shuddering breath.  “That was a mistake, never do that again, I think I just had a goddamn stroke.”
“And what, exactly, do you suggest we do?” Natasha asked.  “Shoot one of them?”
“It's so cute that you think I'm risking New York traffic,” he said. “I'll be out of here in ten.”
Steve smiled at DJ.  “Clint and I will take you.”
“Never,” she agreed.  She crossed her legs, her flowers settled easily in the crook of her elbow with all the grace of a beauty queen.
“Way ahead of you,” Natasha said.  She smiled.  “Way.  Way ahead of you.”
Steve’s head dipped, the movement slow, almost lazy.  Right before their lips met, Harris was pretty sure he heard him say, “Yes.”
"You're lying on my kitchen floor," Steve said.  "How comfortable can that be?"
He stopped.  “But if you want something different, if you want a mother and a father and maybe siblings?  If you want a normal house and a normal life and a school, and all of that, I’ll do everything I can to find you the perfect family.  One that knows you and loves you and will make sure you’re happy.”
“You’re coming off really well in this story,” Steve said with a smile.
“I know.” Steve pushed some of the tools out of the way, clearing a spot for his arms.  “This is-”  He picked up a chunk of the armor, turning it over in his hands.  He gave DJ a glance, one eyebrow arching.  “Dad’s making improvements again, isn’t he?”
“Are you eating nothing but desserts?”
“I'm a proponent of making allowances for who people are,” Steve said, his voice flat.  “This city only works if we accept that we're not the same, we're never going to be fully the same.  Things that are fair aren't always equal, and things that are equal aren't always fair.”  He gave a slight shrug.  “And things work better if we just give people a stool rather than arguing that they could reach if they really wanted to.”
“Fuck,” Tony said, and he scraped a hand over his face, needing the physical pain to distract him from something worse.  “Right.”  He turned, and his foot collided with something, tripping him up.  He looked down to find DJ’s butterfly net pushed half under the bed.  He leaned over, collecting it.  The net was tangled, but intact, and he smoothed it out.  “Did you find anything that could help us?”
“Yes, thank you, Ghost of Christmas Nobody Asked For This So Fuck You,” Tony said.  He opened one eye to glare down at his phone.  “Clint?”
“You will not, sir.”
“Oh, there absolutely are anarchists, and on most days, I find myself agreeing with them a bit more than I’d like.”  Tony caught the edge of Steve’s orders, giving the page a tug, and Steve let him take them.  “But no.  The current threat has nothing to do with them.”  He smoothed out the sheet of paper, his eyes darting over the few simple lines.  “And likely never did.”
“Closer to six thousand,” Pepper said.
“Well.”  Jarvis was silent for a moment.  Then the elevator stopped and the doors opened. “I am glad.  If you can calm him, I will be...”  The words seemed to break, like an almost imperceptible burst of static.  “Grateful.”
Jarvis hovered just over his shoulder, an array of plates balanced in his hands.  "Biscuit, sir?" he asked, offering him the basket.
DJ's head rolled in his direction, and he gave Tony a quick smile and a quicker nod.
"So will you," Tony shot back.  "The press, the innuendos, the internet-"
Iron Man looked at him, his head tipped to the side.  “No?” he repeated, sounding almost curious.
Tony glanced at Jarvis.  “You didn’t want him here.”
Jan nodded. “Steve?”
Strange looked at DJ, who nodded. “Tuesday,” he said, stepping into the foyer. “Lessons?”
Clint snagged a skillet from the rack, setting it on the stove, and laying the bacon in it, one strip after another.  As it started to cook, he held up a hand.  Natasha tossed in egg at him, and he plucked it out of the air without even looking in her direction.  Natasha flicked another egg in his direction, and he caught it with his hand behind his back.  A third egg arced high over their heads, dropping into Clint's waiting palm.  As Steve watched, confusion sweeping over him, Clint started juggling them.
He felt Steve’s fingers, gentle and familiar, trace a curious path across the back of his shoulder.  Something stirred in the depths of his sleep-addled brain, something that he should’ve been concerned about, but he was asleep again before he could figure out just what it was.
Tony’s hands stilled.  “I’m sorry.”
“Oh, that’s rich, coming from you.”
“Engineering as edutainment!” Darcy said, spreading her hands in the air.  “It’s great!”
“Are you?” he shot back.
“Who says he gets to stop?” Wanda said, spinning spaghetti on her fork.
“Abby and I'll be right behind you,” Sam said.  “Clint?”
“Both,” Natasha agreed.  “Thank you, DJ.”
“Never hit anyone, did I?” Clint asked.
“I don’t have the attention span for blackmail,” Jess said, peering over Carol’s shoulder.  “Can we get churros?”
“You're helping,” Steve said, because he'd always been weak to a hopeful smile.  “Other people, not so much.”
DJ looked up to find Harris peering over the back of the seat at him.  He managed a smile and a nod, and Harris smiled back.  His face was pale and washed out in the flickering lights, but still, something he knew.  Something he was comfortable with.
“What are you even doing here?” Tony asked him, doing his best to ignore the way Jan was still muttering to herself under her breath.
“Well, now I do,” Steve said, meeting Carol’s eyes.  She was turning red, and he grinned.  “Are you…  Are you BLUSHING, Danvers?”
His voice trailed away, and Natasha picked up the thread without missing a beat.  “We left the northside gate unlocked.  He’s…”  She stopped, and Tony opened one eye to peer at her.  She handed a knife to Clint, who took it with a broad, self-satisfied grin.  “He’s very disappointed in us.”
“Be careful going home,” Darcy said, her arms folded on the back of the pew, her chin resting on her wrist.
“TRADITION,” Jan said, slapping her hands on the table, and the mistletoe bounced in place, ringing gently as it settled back against the wood.
“It’s food, Steve,” Tony said, scooping broccoli, green and crisp, into the steamer basket.  “Not that complicated.
Another beat, then Peter said, “Hey?” in his most tentative voice and Tony reached for a pad of paper next to his computer keyboard.  He ripped a sheet free, crumbled it up, and threw it off camera in the general direction of Peter’s voice.
“Far better than I had any right to expect,” Tony said. Because Steve loved him. Steve loved him. He realized, a bit too late, that he was holding onto his phone like it was a lifeline. He forced his fingers to relax.
“Goodbye, Pepper,” he said, but he was grinning.  He hung up the phone, tucking it into his pocket as he wandered across the roof.  Without a second thought to how much his suit had cost, he settled down on the edge of the roof, his arms braced on the lower strut of the railing and his legs dangling off the edge.
"Oh, I understand," he said, his bow tie bobbing along with the words. He gave Rogers’ had a single, strong pump. "Duty calls, and all that?"
“I mean, I did, but then I got out of the hole and someone thought I should get medical treatment,” Clint said, staring at Natasha with narrowed eyes.  She smirked down at her pistol.  “Didn't you-”
Logan shook his head.  “Chuck keeps tabs on these things, too,” he said.  “Gyrich's been in and out of a couple of highly classified government agencies through the years, not sure if he couldn't get anything to stick, or if he was just hunting for a place he felt he could build a power base.”
Tony blinked.  “What?”  He lifted his head.  “DJ?”
“I do believe that if you were to exit the bathroom in the Iron Man armor, you might well cause him a great deal of panic,” Jarvis said.  “Might I suggest the blue Brioni?”
“Right,” Harris said, scraping a hand over his face.  “Right.  Because I’m getting the feeling here that the reason why you don’t know what’s happening is because you don’t give anyone a chance to explain.”  Tony’s head tipped in his direction, his eyes hidden by his sunglasses.  “I’m going to guess that you heard the bare minimum from every single  person involved with this, and took off to handle it all by yourself, because fuck everyone else and any insight they might have into the situation.”
DJ went back to the Rubik's Cube in his hands, his fingers flying over the surface.  “Not hungry,” he said.  Steve waited, hoping for more, but DJ was focused on the puzzle now, arranging the colors in complicated, irregular patterns that meant nothing to Steve.
“Why haven't you gone to-”
"Papparazzi don't feel shame or guilt."
“Thank you for humoring me.”  He tossed the plate in the air and caught it, the movement smooth and easy.  DJ tracked the arc, waiting for the plate to land safely in Steve’s hand.  When it finally did, he exhaled, his shoulders relaxing.
“Don't blow him up next to the bomb!” Steve snapped, just as an arrow thudded into the flamethrower's fuel tank.  There was a crack and a sick, gooey noise, and then the man was on the ground, a pile of expanding foam rapidly swallowing him.
Jan waved an airy hand in his direction.  "We've all got work to do,” she said, the words mumbled out around a mouthful of pins.  “And I had to work this in when I could bring in my people.”
“I’m kinda thinking that you’re mad because of the wedding picture, which, okay, that was in bad taste.”
“Okay,” DJ said.  He looked up at Jarvis.  “Two eggs, please.”
"OOooookay," she said, trying to hide her cruller behind her back. Without looking up, Celia shoved a napkin across the desk at her.
Steve frowned.  “One of his?”
Hands shot up all over the room, and she pressed a hand to her chest.  "Oh, now you all want to be tech reporters?"  To general laughter, she looked at Tony.  "Ready for round two?"
"How does someone think they were dating when they were not dating?" Carol asked.
“Can I have a name?” Harris asked.
“That did not sound confident at all,” Steve said.  He glanced back towards the range, where the kettle was barely starting to steam, before he headed to the bathroom.  “Are you-”  He poked his head into the bathroom and found Tony struggling to get his shirt off.  Smiling, he leaned a shoulder on the doorframe, his hands in the pockets of his pants.  “Need help?” he asked again.
The crowd in front of him shifted laughter rippling through the group as they jostled for position.  It echoed through the foggy air, low and eerie, as the men pressed forward, their individual shapes lost in the dim light of the street lamps.  There were a dozen or more, and they were still coming.  Trickling from the dark alleys between the weathered warehouses and piles of cargo, they pressed in on him, cutting him off from any path back to the city at large.
“'Hey, baby,'” Sam said, his voice falling to a low, sexy pitch.  “'Take this jewelry.  The US Government gave it to me for free, so I'm kind of regifting it, and it was intended to identify my charred body, hopefully after I die.  But I think it looks better on you.”
“No, we cannot, because tomorrow, you’d suggest that we wait until Monday and then till next month, and next thing I know, it’ll be three years from now and you’ll have skipped every single diagnostic that is on the schedule,” Tony said.  He pointed at the charging stations.  “Come on.  Phil’s civil liberties violations will still be there tomorrow.”
The question was like a splash of cold water, straight to the face.  Tony gave his head a shake.  "Is that sass?" he asked, reaching for the pliers again.  Rogers got there first, fingers curling around the grip as he handed them over.  "Is that working class sass I hear in your voice?"
Shawn deflated.  “You don’t think I can.”
Tony's eyes twitched in her direction, then back to his work.  "He's got Clint," he said.
“Officer-” Pepper started.
“Then you don’t get a vote.” Bucky pushed away from the wall.  “C’mon, Steve, grab your new toy and let’s go.   We’ve still got a few days ride; might as well get to it.”
Steve nodded.  “Don't stay up all night, Tony.”
The seat next to him was pulled back, and Harris set his plate down before he dropped into the chair.  “Did you get something good?” he asked.  His plate was full of tiny berry tarts and cookies, perfect little squares of cake in perfect little frosting coats, and scones with scalloped edges sitting by a tiny pot of clotted cream.
“Xavier's takes students as young as thirteen,” Franklin said.  He picked up one of DJ's tools, turning it over idly between his hands.  “I mean, earlier, sometimes.”
Luke snorted under his breath.  “You can’t kiss one handed?”
Tony glanced down at himself.  He'd left the armor on the landing pad on the roof, but the black undersuit was decent enough.  “What, do you think that I'm going to go get a facial and a manicure?  Get a bespoke suit?”
Strange waved him off, his mouth a tight, thin line.  “As I said, a fool.”
“I threw those out,” Shawn said, as Darcy handed him a tray.
“I’m just fine,” Tony told him.  DJ nodded, but didn’t look up.  Tony smiled.  “Diagnostic?” he asked.  DJ’s eyes came up, and Tony leaned over, as best he could.  DJ reached out, the movement cautious, and tapped a finger against Tony’s nose.  Once.  Twice.
"Tactful," he managed.
“At least a decade,” Carol said, her voice cheerful.  She crossed her arms over her chest.  “And think I still have Steve beat.”
“Shoot ‘em.”
Tony laughed, the sound muffled against Steve’s skin.  When he pulled back, his eyes were dancing.  “It all comes off, darling, that’s rather the point.”  One of his hands slipped free of Steve’s suspenders, falling to catch the waistband of his pants.  “I can demonstrate, if you’d like?”
“And like you said, the city’s full of them,” Hank shot back.  “So-”
“Probably the cat,” Harris said.  He sounded very tired.
“We can burn them,” Tony agreed.  He nodded against Steve’s shoulder.  “I’m fully in favor of this.”
Tony knew he'd been right as soon as he picked it up.
“Yes.”
“Just a secret identity?” Tony said, his hips arching into Steve’s.
DJ’s mouth opened, and closed.   He took a breath, his shoulders twitching.  “Dad?” he whispered back.  “Is he…”
It wasn't what he'd expected, but seeing Steve here, in the midst of it, seemed perfectly natural.  Perfectly comfortable.
"Are you mocking me right now?" Steve asked, smiling despite himself, and Tony held up one hand, his finger and thumb an inch or so apart.  Steve took a deep breath, trying to ignore the nausea that still churned low in his stomach.  "Listen, buddy, this is my first marriage and my first divorce, I've got concerns."
Tony shrugged.  “I’m not sure what difference that makes.”
“Aaaaaand that’s a name that only a fellow nerd would dredge up,” Harris said with a wide smile.
“Ooh, banana.” Stark tucked his hands in his back pockets.  “I want that back, just so you know.  Don't get too attached to it.  I'm expecting it to be waiting for me, with more coffee in it, when I get back.”
“If he’s paying, I’m having a second bowl,” Clint said to Shiro.
Before he could get another word in, she was gone, a faint trill of laughter echoing in her wake.  Tony grinned at nothing at all.  “That woman,” he said, shaking his head.
“Harris MacIntyre,” Harris said.  “DJ and I met the first time he ended up here.”
The teenager looked up at them, his face pained.  “Sorry about this.”
“We’re going to have a quick discussion about the choices that we’ve all made that lead us to this point,” Iron Man told him.  The armor flickered in the light as he turned.  His head twitched, a quick jerk of his chin to one side.  “A quick, honest discussion.”
“What..  Oh my God.”
Tony managed a lopsided smile.  “Recognize the chip.”  He rubbed his thumb against the indentation on the rim.  “How long do you plan on using it?”
“He's having a pretty bad day,” Bruce said with a slight smile.  “And if you don't want to have a worse one? I'd suggest you leave quietly.”
Clint frowned at him over the top of the plastic wrapper.  “No?” he repeated.  “Think I need a larger size?”
"No," Steve said, at the same time that Jan said, "Yes."
Steve grabbed a stool, dragging it over to the counter and boosting himself onto it.  “You always give me the hard jobs,” he said.
He shook his head. “Jan-”
Maguire shifted his weight, his fingers gripping the brim of his cap  tight.  “I-” His face flushed, he tried to bluster forward.  “I was told to bring back your reply?”
“He makes video games,” DJ said.
The second sweep, he’d try to keep focused, despite the way his brain kept trying to wander back to last night.  And this morning.  And the possibility of later on today.
“Yeah, and it’s you.”  Steve started to laugh, and Tony caught the front of his shirt in one hand, pulling him towards the door.  “Let’s go.  My safeword is ‘budget.’”
Her eyes were slits now, sharp and hard.  “So you want to do a chargeback?  You go right ahead.  I won’t even contest it.  You want to sue me?  Fine. Pretty sure Bernie already hates you on general principles, so she’s probably got a filing ready to go.  But I don’t think you will, because if you do, you’ll have to find yourself a new artist, and Tony?”  She smiled.  “You’re lazy.”
Pepper struggled not to smile.  “I appreciate the information.”  She reached for her purse.  “And-”  She pulled out a half dollar, the silver gleaming between her gloved fingertips.  She held it out to him, one eyebrow arched.  “And if you have any other helpful tips?”
Tony saw the streak of movement, the flash of pale skin and dark body armor, and he honestly did not understand what it was until Clint slammed into the girl, their limbs tangling together, locking them together just as the bus went flying, end over end, to smash into the pavement right on top of them.  There was a roar, or maybe a scream, a sound of denial lost to the sound of metal crashing into the pavement, into the scaffolding.
Steve let his hands drop.  “I’m not going to ask how I missed this-”
It took him a second to connect the dots.  Steve grinned at him, despite the way his body was in chaos.  “Sometimes you've got to double dare me,” he managed, and Tony was laughing, his forehead braced against Steve's chest, and Steve could smell his hair, could feel his breath through the thin fabric of his t-shirt.  His eyes drifted shut, warmth curling through him, part arousal, part affection, all trouble.
Fury took a deep breath.  “Barton, do I even want to know-”
“There is NOTHING honorable about Mario Kart,” she said.  “I’m bringing the pain.”
“I went to school,” Peter said with a grin.  “Then school ended, and I came home.  I did my homework in the kitchen, and DJ helped with that, which was very nice of him.  Now I’m eating a cookie.”
Reality hit like a bucket of icy water to the face.  Steve took a step back. “Sorry,” he said, and his voice sounded raw.  “I’m-” Before Tony could say a word, Steve was scooping DJ out of his hands, wrapping the boy up against his chest.  He took a step back, and nearly tripped over his own feet.  “I’ll put him to bed.”
“And I thought, maybe Bruce, but-” Steve’s weight shifted, and he caught Tony’s right arm.  “This is the chemical structure of, what?”
Tony grinned as he reached for his napkin. "And he's still after my pastry, so..."  He patted the bed next to him.  "Guess it wasn't enough.  Come on, hop up here, kid.  I'll distract Jarvis and you can finish off my eggs benedict."
“Our entire civilization looked at that hut and collapsed,” she said, and Bucky was laughing out loud now, his head thrown back, a hand pressed to his eyes.  Shuri leaned forward, her spoon cutting through the air.  “From SHAME.”
"Who's the dancer here?" she asked.  Her heel dug into his shoulder blade.  "Reach for your toes, Cap."
“I'm going to hit your mute button now,” Tony said.  “Before you get me in trouble.”
“Haven't got a plan,” Rogers said.  “Other than getting him outside for a bit.  Maybe take a walk around the grounds, or down to the lake.”
Tony held up a hand.  “I need an overview,” he said.
Jan gave him a look, a born vamp, and threw her measuring tape around her neck like a scarf.  “I'll just keep your vase.”
Tony took a deep breath. “He leaves his shoes in piles at the door. He makes ridiculous sandwiches. He compares sales fliers for grocery stores.” The bubble of laughter caught him so off guard that it hurt. “He buys organic milk.”
“Absolutely not getting into trouble,” Peter said.
There was a soft sigh, and then a light bonk on his head.  He looked up, and Shuri smiled as she tapped him on the head with the shield again.  “Get up, you fool,” she said.  “Barnes, come collect this fool and-”  She looked over her shoulder just in time to see both Sam and Bucky go down to one knee, covering their hearts with one hand.  Shuri heaved a  heavy sigh, her eyes rolling up.  “Okoye.”
“Can we plan a heist, at least?” Darcy asked.  “Sexy siren distraction, elite hacker, some straight up muscle?”
“The council has put certain precautions in place while we attempt to track her, but as you might know, she is remarkably clever and just as dangerous,” Stephen said.
Steve blinked at him. “What?”
“We'll be right here,” Rhodey said, pushing away from the wall and stroking in Pepper's direction.  “Take your time.”
Rogers blinked.  “A picnic.”
"I know it is, but my bisexual outting came a long time ago, Steve," Tony said.  "I'm old news.  I'm not going to be the one they focus on here."
"Which is weird.  I mean, there's a lot of caped types that I would not mess with, but he doesn't seem the type to break your camera or your knees.  How has he escaped the plague of photo locusts?"
“I saw you naked,” Rhodey said.  “For the…”  He stopped, one eyebrow arching.  “God, I’ve seen you naked way, way too much, Tony.”
But Clint didn't remember moving.
“Tell me the truth, Miss Potts,” Tony said, returning his pen to its stand.  “How much of your job is honestly easier if I’m not there while you’re trying to do it?”
“Clear the streets and hold your distance,” Steve said.  Tony spared a glance for the street below him, catching a glimpse of his familiar blue clad form.  SHIELD agents and police officers were moving everywhere, scrambling over the streets like ants.  But it was Steve that everyone followed, the civilians spilling out in his wake like he was the Pied Piper, the only point of reference they had in a world gone mad.  “Iron Man, what's it doing?”
Tony took the coffee cup out of her hand, hoping she had a sip left.  No such luck.  “Is this your way of saying that you want to come out with us tonight?” he asked.  “Because you’re always welcome, Pepper.”
Mickey nodded.  “Thank you.”  He looked at Steve.  “Thank you, sir.”
“Stark?”
“I'll consider it,” Bucky said, holding up a hand.
“Evicted right before Christmas,” Phil said, and Tony decided that he really didn't like the man.  “However will I cope?”
DJ leaned his chin on Tony’s arm.  “One more.”
“You said anything,” Steve sing-songed, tipping Tony back to lie with his head in Steve’s lap.  Steve grinned down at him, his hair falling over his forehead, his face flushed.  “You said-”
Tony met his gaze with an easy smile. “I'm not going anywhere, Steve.” The words were light. Easy. They ate through him like acid, and he hated himself. “I need you, too.”
Bobbi was waiting at the kitchen door, her shoulders braced against the wall, her arms crossed over her chest.  As the car slowed to a halt, she pushed herself upright, her coat swinging around her legs with the movement.  There was a holster strapped to her hip, the grip catching the light that flowed through the kitchen windows.
Fury pushed himself to his feet.  “Finish your soup,” he said, collecting the other half of his sandwich.  “I’ll arrange for a car.”  Harris opened his mouth and Fury held up a hand, stopping him dead.  “You will not be taking the subway.”
“How are you this much of a pain in my ass?” Harris asked. “I really-”
"Flowers!"  Jan came floating across the lobby, resplendent in black velvet.  The bodice was lavishly embroidered in gleaming gold thread, the skirt cut above her knees and trailing down to the floor in her wake. Pepper was right behind her.  "Who needs flowers?"
“Right.  I’m getting my purse,” Pepper said, heading for the staff room.
He was really looking forward to showing DJ everything he’d figured out.
The kid stole a glance at him, his head coming up and then ducking right back down again.  "I want you to be," he said, the words almost inaudible.  "You're my grandpa's favorite, you know?  He talked about you, even before-"
And she was breathing.  He could feel it.
“And it was a bad idea before, and it’ll be a bad idea in the future,” Bobbi said, breaking off a piece and tossing it into her mouth.  She hip checked the kitchen door open, waving Steve into the laundry yard.  “Trust me.  I speak from experience.”
When he looked up, he found Franklin smiling at him.  “Worth it, isn't it?” he asked.
"What-"
Steve blinked at him, his brows drawing up tight.  “What?” he asked.  “Of course I would.”
“I love you, and good luck.  Kick some ass,” Tony said, and Steve hung up before he could.
Tony nodded.  “Thank you,” he repeated, and on some level he registered the look that passed between Bobbi and Steve, but he didn’t stop, didn’t even slow down.  Bobbi pulled the kitchen door open, holding it while they stepped past her.  When they were safely inside, she closed the door again, sealing them in.
DJ stood just outside his bedroom door, clad in a wrinkled gray t-shirt emblazoned with the MIT logo and an unzipped red hoodie that fell awkwardly around his shoulders and hips.  He shifted his weight, working his feet deeper into his sneakers, and shifted his backpack a little higher on his back.  One hand wrapped around the strap, the other held a reusable Dunkin Donuts travel cup.
“I don’t think any of us really know what you’re capable of,” Carol said.  “We think we do.  We’re pretty sure we know what we’re dealing with.  And then-” She waved a hand at him.  “You go right off the rails and we realize, nope.  We have no idea what we’re dealing with.”
Jess stared at one, and then the other.  "You're both horrible," she said at last.
But as Steve drew closer, the head came up, and a boy stared at him, dark eyes wide over the broad width of his freckled nose.  His hair had been dyed a sharp, almost electric blue, and cropped close to his head.  As Steve approached, he straightened up.  “You're Steve Rogers?” he asked.  His backpack slipped down his shoulder, and one hand came up, grabbing for the strap.  His nails were covered in chipped turquoise polish just a shade lighter than his hair.
DJ took a deep breath, and another, his head spinning.  He opened his mouth, and nothing came out.
“Yes, but it is mine,” Pepper said, her voice unnaturally chipper.  Tony paused, his fingers hovering over his notes.  He looked up to find Pepper staring at him, a wide, toothy grin plastered on her face.  “So.  If I'm asking you this question, do you really think that the answer would be found in the database?”
“Pick your poison,” Rhodey said.  He stepped into the garage, leading the way to the car Happy had just finished with.  His cap was still sitting on the roof, and he collected it. “Put in a call.  We’ll come get you.”  Without a word, Steve opened the door and slid into car, and Rhodey got behind the wheel.  He glanced at Steve.  “Look.  You’re not the sort to leave a job half done.  So I’m going to ask a question here.”
She stared at him, her expression torn between amusement and dismay.  “Thank you so much for your restraint, Mr. Stark.”
Steve started, glancing down at his holster.  “Yes.”  He looked back up.  “Yes.  It is.”
“We could, but we're not going to,” Steve said.  He pointed at the screen.  “How much time does he spend shirtless?”
“Yeah, so does everyone else in the room, so, I’m going to thank you for your rare show of good sense,” Fury said.  To DJ, he added, “We’re trying to get in touch with our Stephen Strange, but as of yet, no luck.”  He leaned back in his chair, his arms crossed over his chest.  “All the numbers we’ve got come back with the same message, and we’ve gotten an ‘out of office’ reply to our emails and texts.  At this point, we’re looking at sending a team over to the Sanctorum, but as you might guess, that place has a solid ‘no solicitors’ policy, so if he doesn’t want us making it past the fence, we likely won’t.”
“I’m considering making that the new family motto,” Tony said.
“She'll be up in a moment, she was helping the Chef check the greenhouse,” Pepper said.  Together, they watched Jarvis and Rogers head up the stairs, both of them bent protectively over DJ.  Tony exhaled, and Pepper gave him a look out of the corner of her eyes.  “Don't.”
“What the hell kind of fish is Deathclaw?” Tony asked Dummy.
Jan looked out, squinting at the view. The landing platform was sheltered by the building, giving a full view of the city without having to brave the full force of the elements. “I thought you'd be in the gym.”
“Always thinking of me, aren't you?” Steve asked.  But instead of putting his soda down and taking it by hand, he leaned forward, his lips parting.  Before Tony realized what he intended, he'd taken a bite, his lips brushing against Tony's fingertips.
Gentle fingers touched his jaw, tipping his head to the side, and he barely had time to draw in a breath before lips brushed against his cheekbone, soft and light, with just the barest scratch of a beard to convince him it was real.
“Brilliant management strategy,” Steve agreed.  He reached behind Tony, trying to grab the last crab rangoon.
“Right.  All of you stay right fucking here,” Clint said, and that was stupid, that was absolutely stupid, and Tony was already running.  “Stark!”
He probably would.  Steve had seen Greer down in the workshop a few times, perched on the edge of the workbench, idly playing with a holographic design or just dancing to the music Tony blasted every time he was working on something serious.  Steve wondered if Tony danced with her sometimes.
“Have you considered that maybe you're using physical exertion and general violence to cover for deeper emotional problems in your life?” Jan asked her.
“And chocolate helps?” Steve asked.  He leaned into Tony’s body, needing the contact more than he wanted to admit.
“Jarvis, call the cleaning service,” Tony said, allowing Steve to drag him out.  He wrapped the blanket around himself, an improvised toga.  “I think I make this work.”
Steve studied him in the flickering light of the passing streetlamps.  “I can’t protect him if I don’t know what’s happening,” he said at last.  “You know that.”
“You need to start thinking of someone other than yourself,” Obie said, stabbing a finger against the desktop.  “What do you think will happen if you end up injured, or, god forbid, dead?”
Tony's eyebrows arched.  “What, about the sex stuff?”  He huffed out a breath.  “Pretty sure that's my line, Cap.  You didn't ask for this.”
The boy gave him a look like he’d lost his mind.  “What if they wake up?”
“Don't care,” Pepper sing-songed at him.  “As long as you show up.  Ten minutes.  Wear something warm, it's an outside presentation.” Tony let out a long, pained groan, and she hummed in agreement.  “Wear your gray coat and the blue scarf.”
“Remember it now?” Sam asked, far too chipper for the early hour.
“We’ll do our best,” she said.  “But he’s making Bruce tense.”
He suspected Rogers would spontaneously combust, and he felt a pang of grief that he'd never see it happen.
“It does.  Thank you, Jarvis.”
“More than that,” Bobbi said.
"True.  But she has her own agenda."  He looked at her.  "You going to take his advice?"
Steve took it.  “What’s this?”
Sam nodded.  "Steve?” He glanced at Steve, his mouth drawn up in a lopsided smile.  “I think you did get married.”
“Yes,” the blanket said, and Clint flopped back on the couch next to him.
When she left, Tony would lick Steve's fingers clean, his tongue lingering against the skin to make Steve shiver.
“I'm not wearing armor, even if you make it for me,” Pepper said, proving that she knew him far too well.  “So don't even try.”  She patted his arm.  “That went well.”
She paused.  “No one legit, anyway.”  Her head came up, looking up at the sky. “As it turns out, a well-trained chemist can make other things.  Things that may or may not be one hundred percent legal at the time when it’s being made.”
“I’ve never claimed otherwise,” Clint said.
Steve kissed him.  “Keep it on, if you want, but-” He exhaled against the hollow of Tony’s throat.  “Kale smoothie for breakfast.”
DJ wasn’t sure if it was hunger or stress or fear or something else.  He didn’t suppose it mattered much.  He shifted in his seat, his arms wrapped tight around his backpack, clinging to the armor like a lifeline.  Outside the windows of the car, the city flew past.  But at every street light and every stop sign, he found himself scanning the buildings, looking desperately for anything he could recognize.
“And we're clear!” the news director said, and Tony realized he'd been holding his breath. He exhaled, his head bobbing in a nod.
Steve took a step forward, and another, staring down into the passage that had opened up in front of his feet.  He couldn’t see the bottom, he couldn’t see anything beyond the first five or six steps, but he could feel the movement of air, hinting at a massive, monstrous space beyond the reach of his eyes.  A faint, soft swirl of music, melancholy and soft, came with it, a siren’s call that made his breath still in his chest.
“Oh, of course, just DJ,” May said, cupping his face in her hands.  She kissed his forehead, and DJ leaned into the contact, his eyes fluttering shut.  “But if you’d like to go by Dover Julian, please just let me know.”
The distinction was subtle, odd.  DJ realized he was picking at the upholstery of his chair with one hand and shifted his hands into his lap. “Clint says,” he said, the words slow, “that I’m what happens, when you don’t compile your code, or run spell check.”
Something wasn’t right.
“Seems like a pretty good plan,” Steve said. He held up the ladle, and she handed over her bowl for a refill.
"One of Mr. Stark's drivers," the man said, with a nod in Steve's direction.
The rush of relief that flooded over him caught him by surprise.  He did not want to think too much about that.  “So just ask Happy where-”
“We need to update the furniture in here, don't we?” he said, spinning DJ's desk chair with an idle hand.  “You're getting too old for this stuff.”
Steve's tongue swept out, wetting his lips.  He was strangely pale.  "A protest?"
"Okay, got it, it's serious, what-"
In one fluid movement, Steve pulled away, leaned over, snagged the keys, jammed them into the lock and wrenched the door open.  Laughing, Tony tried to step aside, but Steve tossed his keys in the general direction of the hallway table and wrapped an arm around his waist.  “This is very good for my ego,” Tony said, struggling to keep his breathing under control.  “Really.  This is-”
“I’ll let Jarvis know to put it on my tab,” Steve said, clearing the way for Tony as they crossed the lobby.
Instead, he rested his cheek against Tony’s hair, letting his eyes fall shut, focusing on the soft sound of his breathing.
“They’re children, Jarvis, I’ve been blackmailed into letting a hundred filthy urchins ruin my house,” Toy said.  “And likely my life.”
Obie gave him a look over the tops of his gold rimmed spectacles.  “I’m serious.”
“You should think about it,” Tony said, smoothing his tie down.  “It would make both of our days much easier.”
Natasha allowed herself a shrug.  “Hard to say,” she said, reaching for the sugar bowl.  “Rogers has proved…  Difficult to anticipate.”  Not that she wanted to admit that, but she did like to give credit where credit was due.  “And Tony is…  Tony.”
Clint flipped him off.  “You’re just jealous, hat boy.”
She smiled.  “So am I.” She took a deep breath, and it hissed between her teeth.  “I’ll be honest.  I don’t remember all that much that happened afterwards.  I was determined, I would not break down.  Peter had had enough loss, enough grief, and if I was all that was left, then I would be the rock upon which he could anchor himself.
“And furthermore-” There was the sound of heavy footsteps on the stairs, then, “Aw, c'mon!  Ugh, I don't wanna see that, what the hell, right in front of me?”
“They’re both safe.”
Tony studied him, wondering how much he could tempt fate.  “I never thought I was a particularly good judge of character,” he said at last.  “And I guess that was confirmed today.”  He looked over at the house, his head tipping back.  “There are certain…  Projects that my father started.  Connections he made.  I have my own, or course, but I inherited a lot from him.
“I would never,” Jarvis said, his voice tart.
She made her way around the table, emptying her arms as she went.  “Our party is a buffet this year, we simply have too many people to do a sit down meal, and super heroes have…”  She paused.  “Unreliable schedules, so this makes it so people can come and go when it’s most convenient for them.  Natasha’ll be double checking the guest list, so if there’s anyone you want that I might not have in the group rolodex, please make sure you get their info to her ASAP.”
Tony grabbed a piece of metal with a neat hole in the center.  "What makes this?" he asked, tapping the hole, then holding it out to DJ.  DJ's fingers traced the edges of the hole, pressing against the smooth bore in the metal, and then shot over to the toolbox, coming back with the hand drill.  "Right," Tony said.  "Drill."  He printed the word as he said it, sweeping his work aside to make more space.  "This is a drill."  He tapped the word, and DJ stared at it, his brow furrowed.
Time slowed down, Tony’s breath stilling in his lungs, his heart going silent in his chest. The barrel of a gun, was a hollow, a hole through the world, a black void, tiny and empty and infinite, and he had an instant to realize that it was going to swallow him. There was an instant of knowing. Of certainty. Of remembering.
“Back off, you harpy, you've got your own,” he said, and she laughed, settling back in her seat.  Tony petted his roses with a careful hand.  “It's all right, darlings, I won't let the greedy lady get her hands on you.”
“In exchange, I want at least one full buffet every day we’re in Nevada,” Clint said.
“Didn’t you do that yesterday?” Tony asked.  Dummy nodded, his claw bouncing up and down.  The papers in the folder flapped wildly with the movement.  Tony sighed.  “Aren’t you done yet?”
Tony’s head jerked up.  “What-  I-” Darcy was looking around, her head jerking from one side to the other.  “What do you-”  He spun around.  “Harris?”
“Most people would say that would be suicidal,” Natasha said.
Strange looked at DJ, relief flashing over his face.  “By the realms, whatever possessed you to come back here?”
Tony nodded back, acknowledging that, even if he didn’t believe it.  “Get out.”
He considered that.  "Yes," he said at last, with such conviction that Pepper had to choke back a laugh.
“The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,
He sucked in a breath and tried not to think about that.
“Coulson knew him.”
“Have you considered being less smug?” Harris asked him.
Steve stared at him, his stomach churning.  “No,” he said.  “Really.”
Steve made a sound kind of like a laugh.  “Listen, mister, I do what I need to do to get the job done.”
DJ nodded.  “Six,” he agreed.  “Thank.”  He slid out of his seat, and kicked the door shut with the side of one foot.  He pulled the back door open, leaning in to collect his bag.
"I regret letting Tony make up a registry after the fact," he said, taking a sip of water. "Some of that stuff is just horrible. Who needs a chafing dish in this day and age?"
The early morning light was hazy, the hard edges of the city fading into the background, and he was there, the golden boy crowned with greenery and surrounded by blossums.
Happy caught his arm.  “Not here.”  When Steve didn’t move, his eyes flicked towards a man who hovered nearby, trying to look like he wasn’t eavesdropping.  Happy leaned in.  “He’s fine, so’s the kid, everyone’s fine, let’s go.”
Dummy’s head popped up on the other side of the workbench.  Tony leaned a hand on the top of the bench.  “What are you doing?”
“Unexpectedly dark for you,” Carol said, pointing at her.  “Did you get Jess’ script?”
“Your father was less trusting, but less brilliant.”  Obie patted Tony on the cheek, hard enough to sting.  “Much less trouble, though.  All he wanted was power.  Status.  Money.  I could give him all of that, and he never paid much attention to anything else.  But you?”
Tony glared in Peter’s direction.  Peter didn’t seem to notice.  “Right, and maybe it was for them,” Tony said, gesturing between Rhodey and Pepper.  “Did you ever-”
“That…  Might be a bit much,” Pepper said.  “The performances can be awfully long, Jan, and…”
“You mean, he'll want to know what he has to complain about,” Pepper said, her chin braced on her folded hands.
DJ followed his gaze.  “It's good,” he said.  He looked at Tony, his gaze steady.  “Good that it's ours.”
“Don't worry,” Natasha said to Steve, as Clint returned to the stove with what looked like a few pounds of bacon.  “Enough hungry mouths to feed, it'll all get eaten.”
“That’s the trauma of culinary school talking, you know that, right?” Tony asked, tipping his head up so that Steve could kiss him.
Steve nodded.  “Hammer.  He’d have to do the paperwork, so he knows, he knows enough, and he’s always looking for money.  We don’t want the hired muscle.  We want Hammer.”
May set the tray of coffee cups on the side table, steadying it with a careful hand.  “Oh, do you know?” she asked, smiling at Pepper.
Steve untangled their bodies, pushing Tony onto his back and moving over him, his knees braced on either side of Tony's hips, his hands on the mattress on either side of his head.  “While I do enjoy that-”
Okoye watched him go.  “If you want him to disappear…” she said, her voice dire.
Now, she studied Tony as she stacked up plates.  “Go wash up,” she said, hefting a tray of dishes with well-practiced speed.  “You’re a right mess.”
“As it turns out, I have security clearance,” Steve said, interrupting him.
Clint got there first, snagging the folder from the top of the pile and opening it up, thumbing idly through the pages.  “Are you upset we didn’t invite you to our fake wedding?”
It took Steve the better part of an hour to get Tony washed and dried, then to steer him up the narrow, steep set of stairs to the bedroom.   Once he'd wrestled Tony into a pair of his pajama pants and one of his t-shirts, he coaxed him into swallowing half a cup of sugary tea and some cold medicine, and put him to bed.
Laughing, he pulled back, wiping soda off of his lips and chin with the back of his hand.  The foam was still pouring out of the neck of the bottle and he licked at the glass.
“Yes, but more importantly for this conversation, she's also currently the VP of PR and Marketing for StarkIndustries.”
“Tell him no more Chick Webb,” Tony called to Rhodey, even as he set Pepper back on her feet.  “My heart can't take it.”
Steve's head tipped to the side.  "I-" His fingers twitched, and he let the page fall back into place.  "Nothing major.  A change in the scale, looks like the draftsman made a mistake when he picked up his work again after a break, or maybe on the next day.  You've already-"
“Yes,” DJ said, digging in with his fork.  It disappeared almost all the way down to his fingertips.
"Honest," Ed said to her, his chin in the air.
Steve’s fingers flexed, tightening on the case for an instant.  “I’d prefer to wait until he’s…  In the mood,” he said, trying to be polite about it.
“And it wasn’t enough,” Tony said, and Jan fell silent.  Tony sighed, his shoulders rising and falling with the force of it.  “You know I don’t begrudge you a bolt of fabric, Jan.  But Fisk will.  And you don’t steal from the man.  Even if he only owns half the stock.”
“Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face!
“And no one cares what you think,” she said.  She turned, kissing Sam's jaw.  “But for now, duty calls, and for that, I need you, Stark.  There's some tech that we can't figure out, and as much as I'd like to lock you out of my labs on a permanent basis, you're our best bet for figuring it out.”
“Not at all, I’d just love to see it,” Tony said, making Steve laugh.  “Your ass is a work of art.”
"Yes, and nothing says romance like a surprise marriage," Tony said, saluting her with his coffee cup and a wry smile.
DJ blinked.  “I...  Don't know,” he admitted at last.
“You can have one after you’ve had some real food.”  Clint moved so fast at the cutting board that the blade of his knife was just a blur.  “Sit.”
"It's the ugliest color I've ever seen."
There was a long moment of silence, and then the rustle of a paper bag.  "Where's Steve?"
“You do that,” Tony said.  He reached for the tea, resigned.  “Tell me about your kitchen.”
“Who’s going first?” Steve asked.
The door to the bathroom opened, and Clint leaned in.  “Not to put any pressure on you here, but people are done eating and if we don't get them up from the tables soon, someone's gonna get bored and invent something we all regret.”  He checked his reflection in the mirror.  “I told Jan putting the Hanks at the same table was a bad idea for so many reasons, but right now, they're out there arguing who could make a better bomb with stuff found only on the buffet.”
“Right,” Clint said, drawing the word out.  “Right.”  He nodded.  “And who or what is that?”
“I’m not 100% sure my legs are going to hold me much longer,” Tony said, bracing an elbow on the counter.  “So if you want some physical gratification, you’re going to have to come over here to get it.”
“Ah, so I see it’s fine for you to keep him up past his bedtime.”
“Which is HR speak for ‘shoot ‘em,’” Clint said.
DJ nodded at her, grateful, and she nodded back, a slight smile on her face.  “Thanks.”
Bruce nodded.  “Send word if anything changes?”
“It’s like, it’s-”  She turned it over, nearly vibrating in place.  “When I was a kid, I had a Super Nintendo, but it was just the system, and all the games were on separate cartridges, and this is all the games I used to play, but on one machine, all ready to go.  Know what this means?”  She shoved it at him, her expression slightly manic.  “I.  Am going.  To kick.  Your ASS.”
Thanks for sticking with me, everyone!  And thanks so much for the winner of my auction, who provided such a wonderful idea for me to play with.
“It wasn’t that-”  She gave him a disbelieving look, and he smiled. “Okay.  It was.” She laughed again, and Steve braced his hands on the bench on either side of his hips.  “Is that all you needed?”
He looked up.  “Good night, Miss Romanov.  Sleep well.”
“DJ,” Tony said, ignoring the way that Pepper was giggling.
“You can,” Tony said.  He held out a hand.  “But…”
“Aren’t you going to ask where he found me?” Mrs. Parker asked.  Steve’s head snapped up, and he found her smiling at him, the knife held easily in one hand.
He felt Steve laughing behind him, as much as he heard it.  “Oh, really?  What do you think is going to get the trend setters hot and bothered?  Is it my mismatched kitchen chairs?” His fingers smoothed over Tony's hair, playing with the strands.  “The chipped egg cups?  The novelty coffee cup full of kitchen utensils?”
“Shoes are not to be trusted,” Thor said.  He was lying on the bed now, his hands folded behind his head.  “Foul things.  The boy shows sense.”
“Third time this week,” Natasha said.  She took the spoon away from Clint.  “It's started to lose its sting.”
“You have the files from Hammer.” Tony gestured at the box of paperwork Happy had collected for him.  “Anyone who shows up?”  Tony smiled at him.  “I expect you’ll do everything possible to protect the company from…” He paused, and reached for his cup.  “Unacceptable losses.”
The blonde’s face relaxed into a smile.  “Honestly?  No.  That’s some excellent graphic design work.”
1. I know zero about fashion and cloth.  I read a lot of bespoke clothing forums.  I might get stuff wrong.  I apologize, but I don't care.
“I’m just saying, touch my corn dogs and I’ll have you murdered.”
“So I have that to look forward to,” his Tony said, as Steve’s Tony signed the registry with a flick of his wrist, and held the pen out to Steve.
Tony tapped a small hidden seam on the side of the armor, opening up a small slot.  From that, he pulled out a black American Express, flipping it over between his fingers.  “In case I need to buy a wedding ring on the fly, of course,” he said.
Steve stared at him.  “You going to do what I tell you for once?” he managed.
“All right, but-”
Steve glanced down the road.  He knew where it went: straight through the heart of the city and to the castle.  But the buildings that pressed in on the road were taller than he remembered, packed tight together.  “It’s been a while,” he allowed, and Rhodes nodded.
The back door lead directly to a small parking lot that was wedged in the space between the chapel and the take-out fried chicken place next door.  It had space for exactly two dumpsters and maybe half a dozen cars, parked discreetly out of sight of the main drag.
Stark slid in, pulling the door shut behind him.  “Steve’s got this thing about being a good role model,” he said, settling in into the seat with a sigh.  He set the cup in the driver’s side cup holder and tossed the tray over his shoulder into the back seat.  “Coffee. Black.  With a double shot.
“Pray?” Obie suggested.
Rhodey brinned.  “Sure.”  He finished the last of his croissant and reached for the bag.  “You like it, though.”
“No, I-”  Steve sucked in a breath, and it did nothing, it did absolutely nothing to ease the tension that twisted his lungs.  “No, I ordered assorted pastries for seventy people.  I-”  He looked at Tony, desperate for confirmation.  “That was what I did.  Ordered pastries for-”
“Oh.”  DJ blinked at him, slow and careful, and he was older, he was not the small child Harris remembered any more, but that motion, the slow, precise way he blinked, that was familiar.  “This isn’t…  What I meant at all.”
“That’s…  That’s kind of the point,” Steve said.  He opened his mouth to say something else and Tony leaned in, cutting him off with a kiss.  For a moment, Steve considered pushing him away, but he was already too addicted to the way Tony’s lips coaxed a reaction from him.  He sank into the kiss, his fingers sliding into Tony’s hair.
"Stop sabotaging me, I need the agreement in order to live," Clint said.  He rolled to his feet, testing his balance and his back at the same time.  Everything held, despite the ache in one leg.  He sucked in a careful breath. "What's your name?”  Simple questions, short.  Easy to answer.  Give her something to focus on.
Steve held up his hands, trying to fend him off. “No, please, it's-”
Steve braced a hand on the roof of the quinjet.  “How’re we doing?” he asked, his voice quiet.
“Nope,” Tony said.
DJ had his face buried in his folded arms, his eyes bright over the tops.  “Snores,” he whispered back, sounding pleased.
“He’s usually right, that’s the problem,” Clint mused from his side of the bowl.  He poked at the flame in the center with his straw.  “He’d be less annoying if he was less right.”
“You do have a shower, sir,” Jarvis said.  “It's there, just to your right, if you'd care to turn slightly to-”
“Good try.  Off with you, I’ve left your books in the library, and-”   Far below them, a bell started tolling,  with a slow and measured tempo, and Strange stopped.  He held up a hand.  “Excuse me for a moment.”
“Space Nazis,” Steve said, the bottle hovering at his lips.
“The-  Oh.”  Bruce turned it over.  “There’s a button labeled, ‘what time is it?’” he said.  “And-” He pressed it.
He had an instant to see the confusion on her face, and then she disappeared behind a wall of red and green leaves.  “Oh.”  The leaves rustled as she tried to get a grip on it.  “I-  Thank you.”
“What?” Bucky repeated, shrugging.  “She was hungry!  What do you think I’m gonna do, turn her away?”
She met his eyes without blinking.  “Get.  In.  The car,” she said, her voice soft and silken.
“Tony?”
Rogers gave him a look.  It was a very disrespectful look.  "Go to bed, Mr. Stark."  He reached down, big hands sliding under DJ's legs and back.  He straightened up, DJ cradled against his chest, and DJ pawed at the air.
“Do you not know where Steve lives?”
“Hey, Cap.”
"I suspect he may have hooked up with a few in his teenage years.  But male or female, he only gets involved with smart people," Jan clarified.  She wobbled a hand in his direction.  "Nerdy smart people.  I'm going to put you in some nerd chic, he won't even know what hit him.”
Tony braced a hand on the newel post, his expression unreadable.  His pants were unbelted, a silk shirt thrown over his shoulders but lying open against his chest.  He moved, and the hem of the shirt fluttered against his hips, against the bandages wrapped around his ribs.  His feet were bare against the dark plush carpeting, and Steve wasn’t sure why he noticed that, why that small fact brought a rush of heat to his face, like the man was naked, like he was seeing something he shouldn’t.
"I am not claiming him," Steve said, and everyone was laughing now, the photographers jockeying for positions, for angles.  Steve ducked his head, a faint smile creasing his cheeks, and they went nuts, shutters clicking so fast that it was just a wall of sound.
"Wow," Tony said.  "Wow.  That was, that wasn't even GOOD lying.  That was bad lying, that was pathetic lying, that was just sad, that's what that was, Sue, give me that before he poisons you."
“Someone had to do it,” Steve said, his voice soft, and Tony paused, his fingers just resting on the glass of the bottle.  Steve shook his head.  “It’s not…  It’s not right.  I hate it.  I hate that the only way I can do this is to take my badge off and do the things that no one else would do, because it’s not right, it’s not something anyone should have to do, but no one else-”
Tony blinked at her.  “Of…  What?”
“I'm taking him to my place,” Steve agreed, resigned.  “And I can hear you smirking.”
“Probably!” Steve said, his voice cheerful.
Hulk let out a snort that ruffled Gyrich's short hair.  “No Banner,” he rumbled.  “Only Hulk.”  He leaned in, his jaw set at an obstinate angle.  “You.  Go.”
Her eyes narrowed.  “I’m a woman of all work, Officer.  I do a bit of gardening, a bit of housekeeping.  I chop some wood, I polish some brass, including this brass,” she said, gesturing at the still.  “He's...  Satisfied by my output.”
For the first time, Tony seemed to hear him, his steps staggering to a halt.  Steve let out a frustrated breath.  “You are going to be a handful, aren't you?” he said, steering Tony back towards the bed.  “It's the middle of the night, what are you doing?”
Jarvis's eyebrows arched.  "I understand, sir.  Shall I have him removed?"
“So send Happy, he’s been here enough, he knows where to find me,” Steve said, his voice barely above a whisper.  “I’ve never seen a man so determined to put whatever Guardian Angel he’s got out of work.”
“Stop thinking,” he whispered, his breath warm against the angle of Steve's jaw.  “Stop trying.  It's like throwing the shield, Steve.  You know what you need to do, you don't need to analyze it, you don't need to think about it.”
“I can work from that, honestly,” Bucky said.  He reached for the cream puffs.  “Like I sad, it's nothing personal, Stark, Steve's just a private sort of person, and you take up a lot of room.”
Jan nodded.  “That,” she mused, “may be the least convincing lie I’ve ever heard you try.  And I was here when you tried to convince Jarvis that the second floor curtains spontaneously burst into flames.”
“Damn right I do, you got CLINT,” Sam said.  “And I was right here.  Me.” He held his hands out.  “Really?”
“I know what I'm doing,” Jan told him, her lips drawn up in a smirk.  “Trust me.”
“Professional courtesy, that’s all I’m saying.”  Clint swung the bow off his back, snapping the tip of it against the shield that Steve immediately moved, trying to tuck it behind his back.  Clint exhaled, a soft whistle of breath.  “Now, that’s curious.”
Tony thought about that.  “Right.  That’s…  Right.”
His voice trailed away, and Steve nodded, his face unreadable.  “Work hazard,” he said.
His fingertips tingled, and he realized that his hands were flexing at his sides, spastic, uncontrolled movements.  They formed fists, the bones straining with the force of it, and then went lax, twitching against his legs, against his chest, against his face.
“Well, it did just happen, so yeah, it can happen, but probably more to me than you,” Clint said.  “Close your eyes.”
He leaned forward, his lips ghosting over DJ’s forehead. “I love you.  I’ll be back to see you before you know it.”
It was the sort of think a schoolboy would do, wasn't it?  Scribbling the name of a crush in a notebook or the wall of an alley.  Making some small claim on that name, on that person.
“I can open it on Tony's phone, I think, I-” He grabbed Tony's phone, checking if the password Tony had given him still worked.  It did, and he let out a relieved breath.  “Yes.  I can open it up.  Have him call again?”
“Does anyone ever say no to that?” Clint asked, taking her plate.
“Go to bed,” Steve repeated, and everyone filed out.
“I’m sure.” T’Challa stood.  “Okoye?”
"I want to pick my entertainment, without a random element that results in me watching a weird, badly dubbed Japanese anime that Peter and Clint are watching for mockery purposes," Tony said.  "Or they say they're watching it for mockery purposes, but hey, they're still watching it, and the mockery has since died down and-"
The girl’s smile died completely.  “Sorry, I-”
“Dummy agreed to feed Jane’s fish and Darcy’s cat,” Jarvis said.  “As well as fill Thor’s birdfeeders.”
DJ bit back a scream, his hands coming up reflexively, ready to ward off the threat.  What he found instead was a Roomba, swinging back and forth in midair.  It beeped at him, rotating in place, and floated forward again, bouncing against the armor’s faceplate.
The side of his face hit the floor, and it was a shock, the cold of the stone and the lingering smell of ashes that filled his mouth, filled his throat.  His fingers scraped against the stone, against the front of his shirt, pulling hard at the fabric there, against the skin over his breastbone.
Chuckling under his breath, Steve stumbled along with her, enjoying the rise and fall of the music, even if he was never going to enjoy the dancing.  “You’re good at this.”
Tony reclaimed the nine with a slight smile.  “I need that, thank you, and yes.  It’s very-” He snapped his fingers.  “Pop.”
“It… It shouldn’t ever be effective,” Bruce said, sounding pained.  “It’s, that’s not a good way to, to do this sort of…”  He stopped.  “Anything.”
“No, but there’s, like, it’s from behind and his pants are really tight,” Peter said.  “Sorry, Steve.  I’m not trying to look at your butt, but this picture is pretty much all butt and-”
His footsteps were silent here, muffled by the moss that grew thick and heavy over the ground.  The branches blocked the wind, and held in the light of the lantern, and he didn’t mind the heavy feeling of the air here, damp against his lips.  He set the lantern down and brushed a few leaves off of the stone, his fingers lingering.
“Or...”  Sam smiled at him.  “Or you can spend the next six months doing your best to win Tony's heart.”
DJ considered them, and then chose a flathead with a polished black handle.
Tony stared at him.  "Make me."
Chuckling, Shuri darted after her, swinging from one side of the road to the other in fast, sweeping arcs.  “Do you not trust me, Okoye?”
“As if that’s the worst thing I have to deal with today,” Steve said.  He braced his hands on the table, leaning into them.  He took a deep breath, and another.  “I’m trying.”
“Let’s keep looking,” she said, letting Clint take his unicorn back.  “I’m sure we’ll find it, soon enough, okay?”
“I think I'll just, I'll go to my room,” Steve said.  He stood.  “So I might be a while.”
Slight warnings for nightmares and scared children.  Very scared children.
Gently, the young man extracted his arm from Steve’s grip.  “It’s something about this shop,” he said, wiping first the door knob, then the glass of the door’s window with his handkerchief.   “Just a little light can’t hurt, wouldn’t you agree?”
Tony grinned into his cup.  "Well, never let it be said that I interrupted the educational process," he said.
“So,” Sam said, his lips curling up.  “Thor.  You got Thor to come and dance with Steve.”
“Or they're hopeless but very enthusiastic,” Natasha said.  She gave Carol a pointed look as she and Sam went past, doing a heavily modified box step.  Steve was pretty sure that she was just letting him do what he wanted, and keeping her feet out of his way.
Steve caught his arms, his grip light, just enough to force Tony to keep facing him.  “We are going to find him, Tony.  We are going to find him, and bring him back.  And you need to be here.  You need to be waiting for him.  Or I can’t bring him back.”
He wondered what it was like when it was full.  Once, there must've been grand parties here, full of grand people.  Maybe there still were.  He allowed himself a wry smile.  Not like he would've been on the guest list, and even in this city, some things still stayed secret.  It wasn't hard to imagine the lines of cars snaking up the long, winding driveway, the people in fancy dress strolling across the marble floors and down the rolling green lawns.
“What?” Strange asked.
Steve shook his head as they headed down the walk and around to the garage.  “I think we both know I won’t be coming back.”
Unable to resist, Steve reached out, his fingers just ghosting over the shining red metal of the front fender.  “How's it drive?”
Agatha nodded, and Darcy said, “Wait, what?”
The mobster took an aggressive step forward.  “What the hell are you about, what is-”
“Why?” Tony repeated, his voice rising.  “So you can be a target instead?”
DJ stared at him.  “Yes,” he said at last.  “Yes, we can.”
“Toast duty, my favorite duty,” Peter said, and it sounded like he actually meant it.
Rogers' mouth opened, and closed.  Tony could almost see him gather himself.  “And the bomb damage down on the garden wall?”
“You picked.  His pocket,” Hank said, his voice dire.  Tony stopped, and gave a broad, theatrical shrug.  Hank groaned.  “Tony.  He was leaving.  He was actively trying to leave.  And you not only stopped him from doing the thing we wanted him to do, which is leaving, but you stole from him!”
The similitudes of the past and those of the future,
“About that,” Darcy said, stepping aside.
“It’s fine,” Steve said, checking each of the stones on the hearth.  More than a few were looser than he’d like, and he settled back on his heels with a sigh.  “We can fix it.”
Steve grinned.  “No, you're not.  And please tell me that Sue left before you-”
“And T’Challa is talking to him, and it’s clear to everyone involved that this is a disaster,” Shuri said.  “Because he’s getting attached.  I’m looking at the guards, and they’re going-” She made a comical shrugging gesture, and pointed both hands at Steve, then went back to shrugging.  “And I’m just waiting for the inevitable, as this one explains that he’s quite pleased with his little hut.”  She templed her fingers in front of her.  “What was it you said?”
“Sam…”
"Very inconvenient, though," Tony muttered, and Pepper kicked at his ankle.  He sidestepped her easily.  "You are an HR complaint looking for a place to happen, woman."
“Welcome to New York,” Victor agreed. “Our people are pretty open about their love, and their hate.” He tapped a finger against the arm of the chair. “Still. It's a little different from someone you know.” One eyebrow arched. “Someone you live with?”
“And just how sensitive is that threat sensor?” Tony asked.  He pulled up a grainy cell phone video of the robot's arrival, coming in low over the harbor, repulsors pushing it along low over the surface of the water.  “What, exactly, would set it off?”
Before the sentence was even done, Steve was reaching for it.  But for some reason, he stopped short of taking it, his hand hanging in the air a few inches from the other man’s.  His hands were dirty, his fingers rubbed raw, the tips almost black with oil or soot.  The silver case of the watch gleamed against his skin, but it seemed to fit there, in a way Steve couldn’t really define.
DJ's face lit up and Steve straightened up.  “I don't think-”
Danny held his plate out towards Luke, who gave it a look.  “What do you expect me to do with that?” he asked, gesturing with a piece of beef teriyaki.
“They do,” Jan said, at the same time as Carol said, “Yes, they do.”
She gave him a look, her face flushed, her loose copper curls bouncing around her shoulders with every step.  “I’ve never given up on a lost cause before, officer, I’m not about to start now.”
“Well, since you’ve been dead for almost fifty years?”  Nicholas took a sip from his tankard.  “Wasn't really expecting Wilson to come back with anything other than an apology.”  The tankard thumped against the tabletop.  “But since you’re here, I think it’s time for some plain words.”
Tony watched him go.  “Just out of curiosity,” he said, and his throat ached on the words.  “If I hadn't gotten sick, would you ever have had me over?”
Tony grinned at her.  “If you're going to be playing in the black market, Pep, better know what brings in the clientele you want.”  He gave a sharp nod.  “And I know just what this clientele will show up for.”
The knock at the door sent Steve scrambling backwards, his coffee cup slipping out of his hand and onto the quilt.  Biting back a curse, Tony leaned forward, his arms folded on his knee.  “Yes?” he called.
He grabbed his pants from the end of the bed, yanking them on and anchoring them in place with one hand.  Not bothering with shoes or even the lamp, he stalked over to the door, just as his visitor started knocking again.  “Lay off,” he said, unlocking the door.  “I’m right-”
Shawn made a face. “I shouldn’t.  Less sugar.  New Year’s Resolution.”  He held up his hands in front of him like a prize fighter ready to square off.  “I can do this.”
Jan fell into step beside him, her feet flying over the polished floor of the hallway.  “Tony.  He's fine, and-”
Steve took a deep breath.  “Come...  Come here.”  He shifted forward, pushing himself upright, and Tony jumped out of his chair like he'd been launched from it.
“It COULD have been, but you had to dilly-dally around starting a relationship until after I’d already bought your present,” Tony said.  “I’ll save that for next year.”
Everyone watched, with varying amounts of confusion, as Natasha pushed Clint forward, angling him for Steve.  "Sorry we're late.  We didn't get in until around three am, so he's running on about three hours of sleep at this point.”  She patted Clint on the back.  “He's upright and he's pretty pliable for the moment, that's about all I can promise."
“Tony,” Steve said, his voice quiet, and Tony shook his head.
“Progress,” T’Challa said, offering her a piece of the pear, and she took it with a grin.
Behind her, the door to the dining room opened, and swung closed.  No one came in, and DJ pushed back from the table, craning his neck to see if he could find out who was still outside.  “Steve?”
"Do you have a safeword?" Peter asked, and heads turned in his direction.  Peter went pale.  "No."
“I know you stole that vase, Jan,” Tony called after her.
“Me?” Rhodes wiped his hands on a rag, squinting down at the engine block.  “No, no.  Let's not bring me into this.  It's you.”  He stabbed a finger in Stark's direction.  “You've run this thing into the ground.  I'm just trying to put it back to life."
"Puce," she said, stabbing her pencil at the girl who was struggling to get her measuring tape around Thor neck.  "Do you need a stepstool, darling?"
“I’ll have it framed and hung directly in front of Dummy’s charging station.”  Tony slid his arms around Steve’s waist.  “Let’s go.”
“Tempting, but, kinda defeats the purpose of paying people a fair wage, wouldn’t you think?” Tony drained the last of his water.  “I remain a man of the people.  Even while drunk.”
He tossed it onto the table, then started emptying the pockets of his jacket and his pants.  Small coins and a dozen condom packets, a folded receipt and a scattering of metallic confetti.  A few crumpled fliers, ones he'd kept despite not being able to read them, simply because he liked the design work.
“To hell with my father,” he gritted out.  “Are you-”  He stopped, just in time, humiliation washing over him like a wave.  He bent his head back over his schematics, ignoring the way the images wouldn’t quite stay in focus.
He looked at the garage door, and back up at Natasha.  She was looking back at him.  “Problem?”
Rhodey waited until he seemed ready.  “We good?” he asked.
“Mom and dad don't know,” Val said, leaning her chin on her her hands.  “Mom's not going to be happy when she finds out, Franklin.”
Tony held up his hands in a gesture of surrender.  “Begging your pardon, I would never dream to imply that you didn’t.”  He flopped back on the couch, throwing one leg over the arm. “Where’s the urchin?”
“You're easily impressed,” Rogers said.  He met Tony's eyes, his gaze sharp.  “I have some questions.”
“Well?” Steve asked, his voice soft.  Hopeful.
“I know where you live, you dork.  Is Tony still there?”
“I can wait-” he started, just before Clint dropped a plate in front of him, brimming with eggs and crispy, sizzling bacon.
Laughing, Peter grabbed a jar of pickles.  "Okay," he said.  "Let's eat."
DJ’s fingers traced the familiar lines of his backpack.  He could feel each plate, and he knew exactly what each one did, where it would sit on the armor when it formed.  He smoothed the pad of his thumb over one particular piece, back and forth.  “If I was home, I would be sure,” he said, choosing each word carefully.  Feeling them form between his lips and his tongue and his teeth, testing them before he gave them breath.  “Here?  No.”  He looked up at Tony.  “But…  The margin of error is small.”
Steve couldn't quite hold back an affectionate smile.  "You're going to get us both in trouble," he said, reaching out to ruffle DJ's hair.  DJ smiled up at him, and Steve headed to his own bed on the other side of the room.  "You know that, right?"
“Glad to be doing business with you,” Phil said, heading for the bedroom.  “Be right back.  I need a shower, then I can help decorate.”
“I'm aware, but I'm ignoring this betrayal,” Tony said.  He took a deep breath, and it came out in a cough.  “Our relationship depends on it.”
“Between me, Richards, Jane and half a dozen of the other best scientific minds on earth, we might be able to,” Tony said.  “But not with any real confidence.  I’m not willing to risk it.”  He nodded towards DJ, even as he stabbed the straw home.  “I’m not willing to risk him.”
“Nothing,” she said, meeting Tony’s eyes head on.
Tony smiled at him.  “It’s fine,” he said, and when Steve opened his mouth, he held up a hand.  “It’s fine, Steve.  Honestly.”  He rocked back on his heels, his shoulders back, a slight smile on his face.  “I’ve known her since her unicorn phase.”
Harris smiled.  “Uh, I can’t move, can you-” His voice was soft, light, and DJ crossed the room, circling the couch to face him.  Harris settled back onto the couch, facing him now, and DJ realized the trouble.
Laughing, Tony let himself fall into step with everyone else, doubt washing away.  For now, it was enough.  It was all he needed.
Sue tapped her hand gently against the boy's.  He grinned, wide and bright, and bounced off across the workshop, ducking around Tony's legs and past the workbench.  “Smoothie!”
“You don't think I have a problem?” Steve asked.
“I’m outside in the hallway,” Steve said in a rush.
“I mean, no one asked for a photo or an autograph, if that’s what you’re asking.  I tipped a fifty, so if it does show up in the tabloids, you can hold your head up.”  Stark took a sip from his cup, his gaze locked on the windshield.  “You going to let us do this?” he asked, his voice quiet.
“I do-” Steve choked on a breath, burying his face in Tony’s shoulder.  “I have my moments.”  His hand brushed against the bandage wrapped around Tony’s ribs, and he went still.  “You’re hurt.”
Isaiah gave him an innocent look.  “I’m an old black man, beholden to a wide variety of social charities and government agencies to try to feed the absolutely most disenfranchised people in the city of New York,” he said.  “You, meanwhile, are a young, attractive white boy who is eloquent, charismatic, and make your money from people who pay Tony Stark the equivalent of a month’s rent for a single meal and then come out and stand on the curb and pay you to actually feed them.  And you taking Congress to task is only going to act as free advertising for you.”  He spread his hands.  “Am I throwing you under the bus?  Boy, the bus is going to speed straight up to you and do an instant u-turn.”
“Kingyo,” Tony said, his knife slicing through the head of broccoli, separating it into neat, bite sized florets.  He rubbed a thumb across the top, testing it for firmness before he swept it all into the bowl of ice water to soak.  He chopped the stems with quick, efficient strokes.  He looked at the tablet that was propped up next to cutting board.  “C’mon, give me something hard.  You’re babying me, and I know it, and I rather resent it, I can handle it, let’s see what you got.”
“You got yourself into that mess, Tony, don't know why you'd think that I was going to get you out of it,” Steve said, heading for the door.  Tony heaved a sigh and plodded after him.  “Come on, let's see if we can steal back two of your plates, otherwise, we're eating eggs and toast off of paper towels.”
“Wait, weren’t the rest of you seduced?” Rhodey asked.  He looked around the room, his eyes wide.  “I assumed the rest of you-”  He picked up his coffee.  “Just me, then?”
“He’s waking up.”
"Are we basing this on experience, or are we simply guessing?" Tony asked him.  He cut off a corner of his egg and put it on his saucer, setting it on the bed in front of the cat.  That seemed to appease it, and it settled down in a pile of fur to consume his offering.  "This is going to kill me in my sleep, isn't it?"
Clint flinched.  “Ouch,” he said, and behind him, he heard Jarvis sigh.
“I know.” DJ shifted in his seat to look back over his shoulder.  His backpack was still on seat behind them.  Satisfied, he looked forward again.
Tony pointed a bishop at him.  “And you’ve seen me do far worse, so I’m not certain why you’re surprised.”  He straightened up. “What difference does-”
Tony’s smile stretched into a vicious grin.  “Because you’re bad.  At.  Your.  Job.”
"I'm sure the game appreciates your financial responsibility," Steve said, heading back towards the kitchen.  He stepped over the laundry basket and started shoving everything back into it.  A few wrinkles wouldn't hurt anything he owned.
For a moment, she was silent, her face an unreadable mask.  “It wasn’t as satisfying as I had hoped,” she said, and Steve nodded again, a little slower this time.
“Oh, we're going to need one of those, too,” Tony said, toasting Luke with his coffee cup.  “Do you have a lawyer lined up?”
“Right under his belly button,” Rhodey said.
"Didn't say worst."  Sam tried to reach around Steve for another bag of trash, and Steve got there first, snagging a bag in each hand.  Sam gave him a look.  "You gonna let me help?"
DJ’s eyes closed, and he focused on the burning sensation as it crawled up his arm.  “STOP.”
“No.”  He stopped, a suit jacket hanging forgotten from his hand.  “Do you want a corsage?” he asked, because that sounded like information that Greer might want.
That wasn't happening.  Tony reached for the sous vide machine.  “Let's just through this, first.”
“Phil got.  I thought we expelled you.”  Tony ducked around him and strode into the room, his hands tucked in his pockets, his head tipped to the side.  He was smiling, but there was a tension around his mouth, around his eyes.  “Didn’t we?  I distinctly remember-”  He pointed a finger at Harris as he passed.  Behind him, Sitwell closed the conference room door.  “This is your fault.  Don’t think that it isn’t.  Absolutely your fault, you were given the defective product and a valid receipt and you were sent to make a return.”
“Let me rip up the divorce papers,” Steve said, the words rushing out of him, and Tony stopped.  Steve took a breath, staring at the doors of the elevator.  “That’s…  Been a reoccurring one for me, the last couple of days.”  He looked down at Tony.  “If things don’t work out, I understand, I won’t blame you, but for right now-”
Steve had expected that they'd all drift away as soon as they'd finished eating, returning to their work and their routines.  But no one did.  One by one, they put their plates aside and just settled down with a cup of lemonade, lingering in the last of the afternoon sun.  Even Stark had merely reclaimed his notebook from Pepper and settled back, his back braced against against the tree, his head bent over his work.
“Yeah, two for the price of one, on war legends and folk heroes,” he said with a grin.  “Wasn’t expecting that.”
Steve wasn't sure how he did it, but somehow, Tony found the center of the chaos, an array of tables and small booths where people in matching shirts were handing out bottles of water, packages of prophelactics, and multicolored domino masks.  Tony slipped through a pack of older ladies in matching red hats, tugging Steve along with him.
“Sorry,” Tony said, burying his face in DJ’s hair.  “I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry.”
"How long was the longshot?" Bruce asked.  Tony gave him a look, and he gave a shrug, his face flushing.  "Just asking.  For science.”
“Oh, you warned them, did you?” Steve asked her, his lips twitching, as he snagged a jug of beer from the shelf.
“Why not?”  Sam shrugged.  “Why the fuck not, Rogers?”
“Sir, you do need to get up at some point,” Jarvis said.
“What is-” he started to ask Strange, and DJ pulled away from him, slamming his fists against the portal.  Once, twice.   He stumbled back, and he was crying now, his shoulders shaking.  Harris caught him by the shoulders, only barely aware when the conference room door opened.
“Yes, how odd that the police don't ask us if we want them to investigate our crimes,” Natasha mused.
Somehow, there was no sting in the words, no sense of disdain or mockery.  Grinning, Steve watched as DJ turned the pages of the book.  "If you're that interested, you can come sit down and listen to the story, Mr. Stark," he said, giving DJ time to study the picture.  DJ's fingers traced over the contours of the knight on horseback, just barely making contact with the page.  Steve waited until he was done, until he pulled his hand back and looked up at Steve, his expression expectant.  "It's looks like it'll be a pretty good one."
“Thank you, darling.”  Jan stared at Steve.  "Be smaller."
He did like tea.  He liked the pale, fragrant brews that Natasha poured into mismatched tea cups, gleaned from thrift stores and antique shops.  He liked the tea that Bruce gave him, poured hot and then reheated when it was forgotten, somewhere in his lab, the lingering bitterness mellowed with a heavy dose of sugar and milk.  He liked the neat, colorful rows of tea bags in Phil’s tea chest, and the loose, brittle leaves that Thor kept in a big china jug, high on the shelf.
“It’s Christmas, DJ got you a gift, it’s in your lap, you should open it,” Jane said.
“Yes, that's not happening,” Steve said, ruffling his hair. “But maybe Rhodey'll give you a donut.”
“Oh, wonderful,” Iron Man said, his voice twisted by the armor’s speakers.  “The annoying voice in the back of my head gets a physical form.”  He shook his head.  “Not that it’s any of your business, Jiminy Cricket, but it’s an emergency release.  One he’s not supposed to use.”
DJ watched, confused, as his dad turned a page, his chopsticks lingering in mid-air as he leaned over the book, his dark hair falling over his forehead.  He reached up, pushing it back, and DJ could see the streaks of dust in the dark strands.
There was a phone on the wall, and Steve pointed at it  “Call them, now,” he said, heading for the filing cabinets where Hammer kept the files on the boys.  He heard Happy’s feet crunch through the glass shards that covered the floor, and turned his attention to the cabinet.
"We're here for unscheduled, unforeseen repairs," Steve said, ignoring him.  "Our plane sustained damage leaving Latveria.  There is an approved ground crew that was dispatched by the local SHIELD office attempting to get it back up and running now.  We estimate it will be ready to go in a few hours.  By morning at the latest."
“Oh my god, he totally does,” Ellen said, frowning at the picture. “How-”
She took it.  “Cynthia.”
His head lolled to the side, following the flow of the light, rising and falling in waves, like music, like laughter.
“They’re my dads,” DJ said, picking through the rose petals.  “We’re going home soon.”  He looked up at her.  “Will you marry them?”
“Stay here until I’m back,” Steve told him, and Tony blinked at him.
“I neither know nor care,” Tony said.  He lifted the top slice of bread off of the sandwich.  “Is this watercress?”
Trip was doing her best to keep her back to him, circling the altar to try to find a path of escape not covered by an agent.  She wasn’t having much luck.  “Sounds like something a dude with memory erasing tech would say to make me let my guard down,” Trip said, and Tony grinned.
“Welcome,” DJ said.  He reached for the button, and Bruce held the clock out of reach.
“Eat it,” she said, cutting off any objection.  “Drinking on an empty stomach is not a good idea.”
In front of him, Rogers straightened up, and Tony spotted Stark walking across the parking lot, an overflowing cardboard cup holder in each hand.  He watched, his stomach churning, as his doppleganger set one of the set of cups on the hood, leaning into Rogers’ personal space.  Rogers didn’t look in his direction, but some of the tension bled out of his shoulders.  Stark’s head tipped forward, a smile curling his lips, and he held out a cup with a theatrical flourish, the other cup holder balanced on his hand like a serving tray.  Rogers ignored him for a moment, but when he finally took the cup from Stark, Tony could see a faint smile on his face.
“Do I get extra points for bringing up the oral sex?”
Steve wrenched the gun from his hand before he could even get the weapon free of his coat.  “Who sent you?” he bit out.  “Who-”
DJ's eyes slid away from Tony's, his face pale and set.
“Someone wanted me out,” Steve said, doing his best to keep his voice calm.  He shoved a hand through is hair.  “Someone paid a lot of money to get me away from-”  He stopped, not sure of the right words.  “Away from the house.  And whoever that is?”  He closed the back door of the car.  “I want them to know I’m back.”
“This is more stressful than presents should be,” Bruce said, tugging the paper apart.  A few moments later, he pulled a clock out of the box.  The numbers on the front had been replaced by elements from the periodic table, the notations bright and cartoonish. There was a moon/sun icon inset on one side, to indicate AM and PM.  Bruce grinned down at it.  “This is great, thanks.”
“Did you see-” Darcy started.
Steve cleared his throat.  “Very.  Sexual.”
“It’s less-” DJ paused, his eyes narrowed.  “Less than you might think.”
“She could, but it would be rather uncouth of you to ask it of her,” Jarvis said.  He paused.  “Especially since there we had little choice about cleaning up the vestibule.”
“I just bet he is.” Tony looked at the board, his eyes narrowing.  “Can I play on your side?” he asked DJ.  “You can show me your tactics.”  DJ nodded, his face lighting up, and Tony smiled back at him.  “Come here, then.”
He turned and headed for the stairs, leaving Steve staring at the empty hearth.  By the time the words sank in, he was halfway to the second floor.  “Move some people around?” he asked, not understanding that, or maybe not wanting to understand that.  “What the hell does that mean?”
“I’ve got leave, so unless Tony lands us in jail today, sure,” Rhodey said.
DJ smiled at him.  “Same,” he said, holding up a hand.
The Tony Stark that wasn’t his Tony Stark (and Harris hated the thought of having a Tony Stark in any way, shape or form) took a loud sip from his coffee cup.  “Appears to be a constant,” he said.  “Though I’d say my assholeary is more warrented right now.  Since I’m at a magic convention, in a universe that isn’t my own, with no current way to get my kid home, and no one, from Stephen Strange on down, has chosen to give me warning about any of this.”
Stephen frowned at her.  “Containment is-”
“Also you’re nosy,” Steve said.
“You clearly never signed one of Howard’s contracts, or you’d know that is absolutely not true,” Obie said.  He took his hat from Natasha.  “Thank you, darling.”  He pointed at Tony.  “Guards.”
“I cannot feel anything below my hips and that’s a good thing, because when I can feel my legs again, I will want to die,” Pepper said.  She rolled her head in his direction.  “Happy Valentine’s Day, boss.”
“Yes, but that was when I thought I was going to die alone, young and beautiful, and was in an all fired rush to spend it all before my inevitable demise,” Tony pointed out.  “Now I have a child to provide for.  A wide variety of superheroes to take care of.  I have a very spendthrift lover.  My milk expenditures alone are through the roof.”
“Hello,” Jarvis replied, smiling back at him.  He tapped the glass gently, and DJ reached for it, taking a quick sip.  Jarvis nodded in approval. “Perhaps you should send Officer Rogers one of the drawings you did yesterday.”
Tony’s head snapped up, his heart in his throat.  Steve leaned into the kitchen, propelling Peter ahead of him with a hand on the boy’s shoulder.  He had a cooler box in his other hand, and he set it on the edge of the counter.  Steve smiled at Tony, warm and familiar, his hair flopping over his forehead, his sweatshirt hanging open over his red t-shirt.  “Found this outside.”
“Hi,” Steve said.
Tony let out a soft, sleepy sort of sound, his eyes half closed.  “Sorry.  Kind of...” He blinked, his hand falling to the dip of his flat stomach.  “Kind of out of it.”  His head lolled to the side, and he smiled up at Steve.  “I'll make it up to you in the morning.”
He stared at Sam across the dim, shadowed length of the room.  "He needed you, he's been waiting for you to show up for hours, and you were in this building?  You were here, but instead of coming up here, you were filling out PAPERWORK?"
“You can't?” Steve asked, grinning.
"Drill," he repeated, turning the simple word over with his tongue.
"Well, pretty much everyone picked the obvious suspect," Natasha said, hooking at thumb in Clint's direction.  Clint stood, and gave a low, sweeping bow, to a mixed response of clapping and boos.  Natasha glared at him.  "Including, despite rules to the contrary, him."
“Next time,” he said.
“My grandmother is cherries,” Rhodey said.  “She’d gather them, by the bushel, and sit there, pitting them for pies.”  He peeled a strip of the croissant away, popping it into his mouth.  “I remember her, fingers stained with the juice, red on the tea towels and coating the old glass bowls.  I remember the scent, sweet and heavy and-”  He shook his head.  “Her pies were, they were unbelievable.  She tried to teach me, but I never had the knack.”  He looked at his fingers.  “Still can pit a cherry faster than anyone you ever met, though.”
“Thank god for small favors, I guess,” Tony said.  He considered his coffee cup, but his stomach was churning.  Instead, he shifted sideways, leaning into Steve's personal space.  Steve wrapped an arm around his waist, his grip firm and strong.
“Absolutely,” Natasha said, and Sam gave her a spin.
“You’re fired.”
“We’ll discuss it,” Fury said, his head jerking towards the door.  Heaving a heavy sigh, Tony stood, following him into the hallway.
The elderly lady paused next to him, a bin of dishes braced on one hip, her neatly pressed uniform barely disturbed by the weight.  She gave Steve a look.  “Customers aren’t supposed to be doing the cleaning,” she said.
He settled the shield against his knees, his hands resting on the rim. “Tell me everything we know so far,” he said.
Tony studied her.  “Jan, it’ll be missed.  Someone will take the blame.”
"You're not the first one to think so, ma'am," Steve said.  He shifted his weight, trying to find a way to sit without touching anything.  It was a lost cause, but he was used to lost causes.  "All due respect-"
“You sound horrible,” Steve said.  “Lie back down, I'm going to get the thermometer and a cup of tea.”
“I can, yes, there’s a-  A box for delivering packages on the back of my bicycle,” Mickey said.  His thin arms went around it in a hug.  “Thank you, Mr. Barton.  I really-”  His throat worked.  “Thank you.”
“I don’t know,” Tony said.
For a long, still moment, Steve just studied him, his face unreadable.  Then his lips twitched up in a lopsided smile.  “Tony, if we were to break up, I don't know how much of  a life I'd have left.”
"Every movie or show file," Jarvis said.  "Just as a point of clarity."
Dummy rolled sideways, and Tony walked around the bench.  There was a stack of boxes piled up around Dummy’s base.  Tony scrubbed a hand over his face.  “And did you finish the calculations I needed you to do yesterday?”
“So your tactic is containment, rather than all-out attack,” Agatha said.
She gave him a look.  “Everyone’s going,” she said, “Or they’re skipping town before Jan finds them.”  She bit her lip.  “But maybe that’s the problem, everyone’s going to be there.”
Tony’s eyes fell shut.  “Right. Of course.” He pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering when, exactly, he’d acquired this headache.  “And what do we consider appropriate precautions?”
“We’re doing just fine,” she said.  “But I’ll be honest, it was kind of you to send that Mr. Hogan around.”
“I don’t want to be charged for that, and I meant, I didn’t think it was a real thing.  That people did.  Then I met you,” Steve pointed out.  “And your disconcerting laughter.”
“Did you want an invite?”
“I mean, I was the last one to break my word on that, and I really think that should count for something,” Stark said, and Rogers looked up at Coulson.
“Of course, Mr. Stark.  Eight am.”  She turned her attention back to him.  “Is there anything else I can do for you tonight?”
Jan Van Dyne came bouncing down the stairs, catching Hank by the shoulder and ducking around him.  “You said you’d call me!” she said, hopping down to the basement floor with both feet.  She stared down at her boots, her hands spread out at her sides.  “I still say there’s a magic word and you’re not telling me what it is.”  She spun in place, the gold and black fabric of her skirts swirling around her boots, her face tipped towards Tony.  “Tell me.”
"Just give them a rough dice and set them in here to soak, please, and Clint'll set a pan up to fry them."
“Let’s just say that I’m looking for a little peace and quiet and somehow-” His head tipped back, letting the music wash over him.  “This is the best I can find.”
“Well, at least you're honest about it,” Tony said.  He shifted the flowers in his lap, the leaves rustling as he found a way to balance them without having them half in his face.  His fingers smoothed over one of the velvety petals, a faint smile creasing his face as he considered the place where the red bled into the yellow.  His colors.  Steve had found roses in his colors.  He looked up to find Pepper smiling at him, her eyes bright.  “Is that a smirk?” he asked, his voice dire.
Tony gave him a critical look.  “Your costume.  I mean, as soon as we get you some sunglasses and handcuff a briefcase to you, or, you know what, I’ve got one of the suitcase suits, that’ll-”
DJ’s head tipped back as he considered the full dimensions of the main hall.  “Okay,” he repeated.  He rocked forward.  “Can we make popcorn?”
“I honestly don't know,” Steve said, half under his breath, so disgruntled that Tony started to laugh.
“He’s not allowed in the chem storage locker,” Bruce said, already scowling down at the tablet.  “My choice.  Not his.  He has different ideas of what, uh, what he should be helping with.”
“Someone tried to shoot you, Mr. Stark,” Steve said.
“My house did not-”  he started, before Clint slapped a ‘Tourist’ nametag on his cape.  “Excuse me, I think that-”
Tony shook his head, his head swinging to watch a girl pass by them, close enough to touch, but without acknowledging them.  “You’re doing this,” he said to Strange.  “You’re, what, hiding us?”
The portal slammed shut with a crackle of light, and Tony, left utterly alone, stumbled forward a step, and then two, his hand still reaching for something no longer there.
Steve raised his shirt, wiping his face with the bottom of it, and Tony wasn't sure what he was trying to accomplish, because his shirt was just as wet as his face, but his stomach was a work of goddamn art, all firm muscle and pale, almost invisible hair peeking up above the waistband of his sagging shorts.  Steve looked up, and Tony made a deliberate attempt to look him in the eye.  Steve nodded.  “I could make you.”
“Clint's the one she should be thanking," Steve said.
“Nothing,” Thor said.  He was holding the far perimeter, crackling lightning darting through the air in his wake.  He matched Tony's movements, but for now, he held back, watching.  “It does nothing but frighten those below.”
Clint's fingers twitched, going to fists before he could stop them.  With a force of will, he flattened them out.  "We're going to do our best," he said, because he tried not to lie to DJ.  He tried his best, and even he knew there were limits to what he could do, what they could do.  "To make sure nothing bad happens.  To anyone."  He managed a smile.  "That's what we do, right?"
Bucky snorted.  “Sure as fuuuuu-”  His eyes darted towards Shuri.  “Heck wasn’t.”
“Please, have some respect for the dead,” he said, when the two of them gave every indication of having forgotten he was in the room.
Rhodes gestured in Steve's direction, his attention still fixated on the open hood of the car.  “Officer Steve Rogers.  NYPD.”
“Wait your turn,” he said, grinning at Stark.
“And she'll flex and the next thing you know, you've lost a seam,” Jess said.  Peter darted past her, running full out for the door, and she snagged him by the back of his shirt, dragging him to a stop.  “So...  Up to you, fashionista.”
“That's a sucker bet, and I know it.”
Steve looked up when he walked into the room and Tony forgot anyone else existed.
“You had one when you got here,” Steve grumbled.  He pushed his hair back, away from his eyes. “Almost certain you had one when you got here.”
He tossed back the rest of his drink.  “He jumped.  That’s the last I saw of him.  By the time Stane stopped the car and we doubled back, he was long gone.  I told him that he’d gotten past me, that he’d opened the door and escaped, he’s…  Clever that way.”
Steve glanced at him, not sure how to handle that question.  "Because my Ma liked Steve?" he managed at last, his lips twitching.
“He is,” Sam said.  “Doesn’t mean that he isn’t going to complain about it.”  Bucky gave him a look, his eyes narrowed into slits, and Sam grinned at him, unconcerned.  “Yeah, you’re a real threat.”
She smiled.  “This isn’t for him,” she said.  “It’s for Mr. Stark.  If DJ is going to stay, then it will be his responsibility to make sure that DJ is taken care of.  He needs to get used to that sooner, rather than later.”  She tipped her head forward, peering at Steve over the rims of her glasses.  “And you need to learn that if you’re not going to be here for dinner, you need to tell us.”
Pepper took a delicate step backwards, well out of range.  “Please tell me that this doesn't have anything to do with the new dessert menu.”
“Did you go up the trellis again?” Jarvis asked DJ, who scrunched down, concentrating very hard on moving the marbles into the jar.  Jarvis smiled.  “It is very tempting, isn't it?”
Clint grinned.  “Jambalaya,” he said, the word rolling off his tongue.  “An old recipe from my last…”  He paused.  “My last job.”
“Happy Valentine’s Day,” Steve said, his voice quiet in the silence of the kitchen.
"Shocking, but I used to be even shorter than I am now," Ed said, unperturbed.  His hands danced as he finished the drink, swift and assured, and he grinned at DJ as he slid it across the counter. "One fat free caramel vanilla latte for the terrifying redhead who lives upstairs."
Tony considered that, his mouth pursed.  He pointed at Peter.
“I take it that went well,” Steve said at last.
“How many times has he grounded you forever?”  Rhodey asked DJ, who paused, his face scrunching up as he considered that question.  Rhodey grinned into his coffee cup, and Tony considered throwing something at him.  “Calculating.  Calculating.”
“Peter's pretty easy to bribe,” Sam said.  “I pretty much just have to wave something fried in his general direction.  You need any help with Tony?”
“For all of us.”  She looked at Bruce.  “Would you like some cake?”
“I thought maybe that might be the case.” She was trying not to laugh.  He appreciated that about her.  “Look, I’ll leave you to your misery.”
Tony pressed his hands to his face.  “I thought this was supposed to get easier when the kid got older,” he said, his voice muffled between his fingers.
"No," Stark told him.  Then, "Do we have any honey?"
He put his watch back in his pocket.  “I like this suit,” Tony said.
Jan winced.  “Okay,” she agreed.  “Gotcha.”  Her teeth worried at her lower lip, her eyes narrowed.  “And this is a problem because you want to dance at the reception?”
DJ studied him, dark eyes unblinking, then went back to tearing the crust off of his bread.  Rogers finished with his plate, setting it back in front of him, but DJ ignored it.
“I take pretty pictures,” Jesse said. “And I'm not going out there. Just to make that clear. I am not going on TV.”
“No.  If you would, please, I’d like you to go back and reassure the rest of his family that he made the trip safely, and that after we’ve seen DJ-”  He looked at Steve.  “We’ll figure out what’s going to happen.”
He made a face, and that hurt, too.  His head was throbbing.  He risked opening one eye.  “What…  Wait.  Which infirmary?”
“It's my goddamn suit and I'll wear it if I want to,” Tony said.  “I can get one of the lightweight ones, light on weapons systems and-”
“IN MY DEFENSE,” Carol repeated, “that line has never, ever worked.  It’s not-  It’s not supposed to work.” She braced her hands on the table.  “It’s a bad line.  It can’t work.”
“Military,” Steve said.
“So.” Steve ran a hand over his hair, undoing the hair and makeup department's careful work with one swipe of his fingers. “Uh. When did you get here?”
Tony went back to his porridge. “Yes, sir.”
“Yeah, but it’s mostly food, isn’t it?” Steve asked, his fingers tapping against his coffee cup.  “Sure, it’s not my name, but this is the first one that’s just-”  His voice trailed away.
“Right,” Steve said.  He studied the still. “Why?”
Steve blinked at her.  "Boys in glasses?"
“Yes, it is, and yet, you’ve done it again.”  Pepper slapped the letter down on the workbench.  “Which has resulted in her renting out Radio City Music Hall.”
“I appreciate it,” Steve said, amused.  He headed for the elevator. “Jarvis-”
Tony smiled.  “No.  It wasn’t my idea.  But I didn’t stop him, either, so I suppose it is my fault.”  He lifted a pawn from the board, but didn’t finish his move.  “What happened to his parents?”
DJ considered Tony, his lips a thin line, his eyes narrowed.  Tony pushed the cat off of his lap, nudging it gently down to the floor.  It hopped right back up, purring up a storm, and rubbing its cheek against the edge of his tablet.  DJ stared at the cat, then gave Tony a very suspicious look.  “This is a borrowed cat,” Tony said, giving up as the animal rubbed against his jaw.  “It does not belong here.”
Harris leaned forward, peeking out of the kitchen door.  DJ was still flopped out on the floor, a box of breakfast cereal braced on his chest.  “DJ,” Harris called.  “How’s it going, buddy?”
“I don’t-” Steve’s fingers twitched, and he had to resist the urge to rip the pages out from under Tony’s pen.  “I have a job, Tony.  How can I work for you, I-”  He gritted his teeth to keep from saying something unforgivable. “I’ve been reassigned, and I need to report back to the station.  Tomorrow.”
Natasha grabbed his hand and pulled it away.  “How bad is this going to be, Coulson?”
“Because I’m more than willing to fight Hammer, and the city, and the state, if it comes down to it,” Tony said.   “I don’t…  I don’t know if I’m willing to fight you.”
“For my own sanity, I'm going to pretend you are,” Sue said.  Her eyes fluttered closed, and she took a deep breath, her shoulders rising and falling with the force of it.  “I'm tired.  That's...  That's most of it.  To be honest, I'm just-”
Gyrich squared his shoulders, reaching up to straighten his tie.  To his credit, his hands were steady, despite the way that the Hulk was staring at him, his face set in a scowl.  “I'll talk to you, too, Banner.  Soon enough.”
“Manatee Cash,” DJ said. Not quite right.  Not quite what he had tried to say, but he wasn’t sure why.  He dug the bottles of liquid color out from under a pile of used parchment paper sheets.  He held them out to Clint.  “Manatee and Cash.”
“Interesting,” Natasha said.  Clint made a sad noise and pointed at his still open mouth. Natasha struggled against a smile.  “Feed the baby bird, will you?”
“We’re very different people, you and I,” she said, laughter audible in the words.  “I do it because I can, and Tony pays for it.”
Trying not to laugh, Steve looked back at Pepper.  “All that, and I’m the problem?”
Natasha smiled.  It was not a nice smile.  “No.  You haven't.”  She clapped her hands.  “Let's start.”
Steve loomed over him.  “And what if I think my place is above you?” he breathed, catching Tony’s shoulder and going down on one knee, pushing Tony onto his back.  Tony went with a grin, sprawling out on the carpet so Steve could straddle his hps.
“I think we owe Officer Rogers more of a thank you than the Almighty,” Tony said.  “Where's Natasha?”
“Absolutely,” Carol said.
“Maybe,” Steve allowed.  “But still.  After Wakanda?” He reached down, gathering up the flasks.  “It’s still like coming home.”
Tony stared at him, his mouth a flat line.  “Are..  Are you sassing me right now?”
Steve nodded.  “Yeah.  I'm just starting to figure that out.”
“As we say in my line of work, everything has a cost.  And not all costs are obvious.”  She smiled.  “Which means, you’re not afraid of me.  You’re afraid that if I proved to be a threat, you would not be able to stop me.”
Steve's head jerked back towards the stove.  "I...  Appreciate that."
Pepper paused, blinking at him in confusion.  “Okay, but...  Why?”
Steve gave him a look.  “That was not your best work, Stark.”
“Oh God, she is.” Tony pressed a hand to his face.  “So.  So.  Rhodey and Peter went to pour me into the shower, those two-” He gestured at Jess and Carol. “Were lighting sugar on fire in my kitchen.  And you stripped down to your shorts and sang a novelty song, until you were tempted by the leavings of their burnt sugar, and you went into the kitchen.
Shuri’s hand flopped back to her side.  “Do you see this?” she asked Steve, gesturing at Okoye.  “Do you see how I am treated?”  Without waiting for him to reply, she turned back to Okoye.  “And stop calling me highness.”  She swung her horse around Steve, putting him between her and Okoye.  She leaned forward, peering around him.  “I only agreed to come along only because here, no one knows me.”  She tossed her free hand in the air.  Her horse, calm by nature and well trained, didn’t seem to notice the twitch of her reins.  “My holiday from myself.”
“Right.”  Steve headed for the sink, grabbing a dish towel from the drawer.  “You’re a bit messier than usual.  Wanna tell me what happened?”
“Sandwich first,” Steve said, and then, “I love you.”  It was a prayer and a benediction and as close to religion as he got these days.
He nodded.  "Yes."
“It's bigger than him,” Stark said.
The stores had changed.  The houses had grown and cluttered up streets that had once been empty, and women in fancy dresses and men in high collared jackets walked where sheep had once jostled against each other and their shepherds.  There were parks that hadn’t been there before.  There were old benches  right where he remembered them.
“Yeah, guess I was-”
“No,” DJ said, giggling.
“There's a password,” Steve said. “Leftover from the Prohbition days, I suppose, but even though anyone can get in, if you don't have the password, the barman won't let you into the back rooms.” He locked eyes with Tony. “I mean, fella like me wouldn't have the password.”
"You may not be who you were, when you first crossed the threshold.  You may not find your way back.  But maybe, just maybe, you might find something you never knew you were missing."
Darcy hummed to herself for a second.  “Want to have sex?”
And if any of them were missing, or out of place, they’d all hear about it.
Harris made a sound, high and sharp, and the cat jerked upright, its ears plastered flat against its sull.  “Sorry,” Harris said to it.  “Sorry, sorry, that was-” His head snapped back to DJ.  “Twenty THOUSAND?”
“She’s awesome and also gave me a knife for my birthday,” Clint said.  “DJ?”
Tony leaned in.  “I’m watching out for anyone in a uniform,” he said, and Hank rolled his eyes.  “I need to go home before I’m missed.  Can you promise you won’t be raided in the next-”  He made a show of looking around, checking the various clocks that were ticking away on the walls.  “Ten hours or so?”
Steve picked up the glass from the floor and dropped it into the sink. “I swear to god if your ass moves one inch off of that couch, Stark, we are going to be having a discussion that you will not enjoy.  Stay.  Still.  I will bring you some water, okay?”
“This house is a mess of riddles and contradictions,” Steve said to no one in particular, just as Bruce pushed the back door open, stepping in from the laundry yard.
“Which is nice, but I'm not publishing it.”
“And eat dinner first,” DJ said.  He pushed the untouched cup of soup away, and stood up.  He smiled at Harris.  “It’s Taco night.”
Steve took a deep breath, and another, bracing his feet under him, the toes of his boots almost digging groves in the wood of the wharf.  He squared his shoulders, his shield up and braced in front of him.  “Last chance,” he said through gritted teeth.  “Anyone want to leave now?”
Tony opened one eye, blinking hard to get his vision to focus.  Yes.  His bedroom, in the penthouse.  The clothes strewn across the floor looked like his and just his.  Nothing was on fire, and-  He leaned over, just far enough to check the trash can left convienently next to the bed.  It was empty.
Steve stalked past the car, his shoulders squared.  “Don’t need a ride,” he said, and Natasha stepped in front of him.
Rage rushed in to fill the hollow space in his chest, white hot and cleansing.  “Hey!”  His feet were back under him, and he didn’t remember getting up, he didn’t remember moving, but he was running now, running full out, with a speed that he hadn’t even known he was capable of.  But the man was running too, his foot catching an end table as he passed, sending it crashing to the ground.  The vase on it went tumbling, shattering on the floor, and Peter vaulted over it, bouncing off the wall and landing on his feet.
DJ’s bed was empty.  Steve took a deep breath. “Deej?” he called, his voice pitched low.
“We’re fine, Mrs. Parker,” Jarvis said, as Tony gasped for breath.  He realized Jarvis’ hand was on his back, rubbing slowly back and forth.  “Keep an eye on our uninvited guest, please.”  To Tony, he said, “Better?”
"Wonderful," Steve said.  He let his head fall into the cradle of his palm.  "Tony.  In all seriousness."
Tony's chin dipped, the faintest hint of a nod.  "Right."  And then, again, "Right."  He took a deep breath.  "Can you look into that for me?"  She shifted away from him, and Tony turned back to meet her eyes.  "Quietly."
Tony nodded.  “I know you will.”
Tony took the cup of water from him and drained it as footsteps came thudding up the hallway.  “As it turns out, you were right.”  He struggled to his feet, holding fear at bay with a force of will.  “I need a car and a driver.  Now.”
“What was she hoping to accomplish?” Rhodey asked, leaning against the edge of the workbench.  He crossed his arms over his chest.  “She had to know he was going to be discovered, he’s not cut out to be a spy.”
The smart thing to do would be to politely excuse himself.  The expected thing to do would be to simply decline.  The nice thing to do would be to stop teasing Rogers and just answer the damn questions.  What Tony wanted to do was to grab the man by the collar and find out if his lips tasted as good as they looked.
"Yes," Franklin said with confidence.  "I do."
Another shrug, but Mickey’s face was set in a sharp frown.  “They told ma we don’t qualify.”  He turned his head, his lips pursing as if he was going to spit, but he caught himself in time.  His shoulders hunched as he went back to his meal.  “Whatta they know?”
“I got Clint,” Jan said, cutting him off.  “Because he can at least be trusted to-”
“Oh, you have no idea,” Jarvis said.  “So much effort, so much progress, and now I have a child who will be miserable, a master of the house who is going to take out his bad mood on everyone around him, and a household that’s going to be on edge for days if not weeks.”
“Yes,” Tony agreed, as Darcy went sprinting back up the aisle, laughing manically and clutching a fake wedding bouquet in each hand.  Three SHIELD agents were right behind her.  Tony watched them go.  “You might want to do something about that.”
“Of course, sir,” Natasha said, setting a plate of pancakes in front of DJ.  “Let me get you the jam pot.”
She looked at Steve.  “I called my mother, because, well, what else could I do?  She’d…” Something flickered over her face, some sharp and broken fragment of an emotion, gone almost before it was fully formed.  “Washed her hands of me, a long time before that, but I was still her only child.  She took the call.  Not that she had the money for bail, or the influence to appeal to anyone who did.  What she had was a few numbers, a few people who remained loyal to my father when he’d been ousted.
"You think you're kidding," Tony mumbled.  “But I know.  I know I'm doomed.  He'll make my life a living hell.  He can do that.  He will do that.”
“Okay.”  DJ nodded.  He looked at the door, and then back at Tony, his gaze curious.  “Can... We go now?”
DJ nodded against his knees.  “Both of us?”
“Oh, God, did I overpay,” Darcy said, taking another bite.
Bruce gave the cake a dubious look.  “Is…  Is it actually Reed’s birthday?”
Bruce pushed it.  “ENOUGH SCIENCE GO TO BED,” the clock screamed at him, and Bruce lost it.  Laughing so hard that he could barely sit upright, he hugged the clock to his chest, struggling to breath between bursts of giggles.
“That's why I'm not asking him, I'm asking you,” she said, wiggling the page back and forth.  “Maybe something simpler?  Maybe calligraphy?”  Her eyes went wide.  “Ooooh, we could hire a calligraphy firm and have them done by hand, it's more expensive, but it does pack a definite-”
Steve’s breath hissed out from lax lips.  “Like a hobo,” he managed, and he felt Tony’s laughter, soft and warm, against his jaw.  He smiled.  “Just because you look good with a beard doesn’t mean that everyone else does.”
“Yes,” she said.  “And to be honest, we’re still not sure what broke the spell.  Whether it was something we did, or just time running short on the spell’s effectiveness, but one day, it just-” She stopped, her eyebrows pulling up tight.  As quickly as it had come, the expression disappeared.  “Cracked,” she said, turning her attention to her meal.  “Right through the heart of it.”
She rocked forward, pushing away from the workbench.  “Yeah,” she agreed. “Family business didn’t work out so well for me, but neither did the chemistry phd, so I guess maybe the problem was me.”  She turned her back to him, reaching for a rack of test tubes. “Any other questions, officer?”
Ellen shifted her phone to her other shoulder.  “Of course I'm watching this,” she said, because there was no point in asking what 'this' was.  They both knew.  Ellen worried her pen cap between her teeth. “What else would I be watching?”
"Okay, he's fine," Tony muttered, rubbing his forehead. “He's... He's good. Who else?”
Slight warning for a panic attack, a little canon appropriate violence, and a cliffhanger.
"Reed is...”  She paused.  “Used to being able to fix things, or ignore them if the insist on being impossible to fix.”  She pinched the bridge of her nose as Steve punched the elevator button.  “And this, this does not go easily into either of those boxes.”
Steve's shoulder jerked upwards, pushing his bag a little bit further behind his back.  “Took someone's shift,” he said.  “Might not have told the brass about it.”
“I love how she asks AFTER she's already punched the elevator button,” Tony said.  He pushed away from the railing.  “Tell her I'm as decent as I'm likely to get, if she's knocking on my door at this hour of the morning.”
Steve hung his keys on the hook beside the door, already too tired for this.  “I thought we agreed you'd go bother Sam until Tony's feeling better,” he said, kicking his own shoes off.  “There's really not-”
“And just as illegal.”  She reached out with one hand, trailing it against a wall as they passed.  “Punishment’s the same, if you made it yourself, or if you bring it down from Canada, and I guess the mob found it easier to have my father make it.  Found him a nice little chunk of isolated countryside in upstate New York, and a very demanding set of quotas.  He wasn’t proud of his new employers, or even what he was doing, but neither did he think that Prohibition was a good law.  Or even an enforceable one.”
“No, but he’s checked the door every single time he’s in its general vicinity,” Natasha said.  “He’s rattled that doorknob about once an hour for the past two days.”
“Yes.”
Steve's jaw was as hard as a rock.  He avoided looking in Tony's direction.  “Right.  So can we-”
Tucking the empty bottle under one arm, he pried the cigar free from the arrowhead, brushing loose tobacco free from the gleaming tip  “Look at that,” he mused, his head tipping to the side.  He rolled the shaft between his finger and thumb, letting the light play across the metal arrowhead.  “See that?”  He flicked it towards the head of the mob, who flinched back.  “The barbs?  They make a real mess of whatever they go into, you know.  They bite in deep, and when you take it out…”
“I'm going to interpret that to mean 'a lot,'” Tony said.  “'A lot of books.'”  Tony held up a well-worn paperback.  “'A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'?” he asked with a grin.
Steve fished his phone out of his pocket.  "Right," he said.  "Are those your socks, Bucky?"
Jan was undeterred.  “Do we liiiiiiiiike him?” she asked, weaving her fingers together under her chin..
“Did you-”
Tony cursed, but got back in the car.  Only after his door shut did Steve follow suit.  Happy looked at him out of the corner of his eyes.  “Playing with fire there, aren’t we buddy?”
“Right,” Steve said.  He turned off the tap.  “I'll just have to take your word for that.”
"Where WERE you?"
“Yeah, probably.”  Billy disappeared back inside, leaving a few of the other boys to take their turns at the window.  Behind Steve, Happy raised a hand to wave, and all of them ducked back inside.
“I have a problem,” Steve admitted.
“Got it,” he said, and tried his best to watch the movie.
“I...  Could do that,” Rogers said, drawing the words out.  “But-”
“Nothing.”  Tony's fingers traced intricate patterns on Steve's skin, his breathing smoothing out.  “Sorry.”
“Now I feel like they're booby trapped, or maybe poisoned,” Bucky said.  He picked up the biggest one on the plate and took a huge bite.
Steve's arm shot out, blocking the doorway so quickly that Clint ended up stumbling back a step or two.  Steve's head rolled in his direction.  He studied Clint as he took a sip of coffee.  “What's going on?”
“Six,” DJ agreed.  For a moment, he just sat there, staring up at the old brownstone.
DJ licked his spoon clean, savoring the sharp tang of the berries.  “Yes,” he said, because it worried Steve when he didn’t talk.  He never said anything, but he got quiet, too.  And DJ didn’t like the silence very much.
“Loud difference of opinion,” Tony tried.
Tony pointed at Rhodey.  “Don't think I don't know why you're here,” he said.  “I absolutely know why you're here.”
“Waiting this out back at Stark’s place,” Steve said.  “Eating everything in sight.”
“He’s fine,” Jan said, hopping down to the ground.  “Mad as a we cat, but fine.”  She paused, her eyes darting towards Greer. “Uh, sorry?”
“Colorful,” Tony said, but yes, he was definitely smiling now, the sort of a smile that crinkled the corners of his eyes and softened the sharp line of his jaw. “All right, then, officer, I'll bite.” He braced a hand on the workbench, leaning into it. “Who, exactly, do you plan on putting in those seats?”
“I mean, he's going to act like that's, like it's a real thing,” Tony said.  “With the touching and the smiles and the-” He flapped a hand at the room at large.  “He's going to kiss me, Pep, I know he is, and this is going to be hell.”
