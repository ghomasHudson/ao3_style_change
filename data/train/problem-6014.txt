“You’re not the only one who said what he shouldn’t say. And in case you didn’t remember I lashed out first...I am so sorry” Tony sounded shameful. It didn’t even occur to him back then, he was too busy protecting himself to realize that Steve had lost his whole world.
Tony wasn't fooled the slightest, his parents were living proof of the ugly truth. Soul-bonding wasn't the sacred or glorious thing that people, novels, and television made it out to be, and not all soul-bound couples were happy.
God, it was far worse than it had been before. It used to be just dreams of Rogers calling his name, cuddling, or caressing and chastely kissing him. This… this… had got to stop… it felt like he was being unfaithful to Pepper. He made love with her, yet dreamt of another man. A man, that a voice kept telling him, was Rogers only it wasn’t. There were muscles and height differences! And the other guy wasn’t Tony either!
Natasha gave a hard stare while stepping forward “Loki was manipulating you.”
“Then don’t take my stuff.” he replied patronizingly.
"I’m sorry.” Steve’s voice tight with sadness, looked down. “I wish I'd known him better. He seems like a good man.” He said in a small voice.
Fallen back to his anger to make him strong, Tony’s eyes blinked with loathsome rapidity. “STOP IT, ROGERS.” he made the words like a hand held upright, commanded him to a halt. “I am not yours and never will be. Get your head out of your ass.” Steve never in a million years thought he would hear any of those words from his soulmate in such a dark tone as they did. Tony's face was stone cold showing no emotion.
It was unnerving seeing Loki spun back seemingly untouched when Steve's punches usually sent his opponents flying. Taking advantage of Steve's momentary pause, Loki quickly attacked him with his staff, knocked his shield to the side, before his fist connected solidly and sent the Captain flying.
At that moment, Thor and Natasha marched into the lab. Bruce’s eyes narrowed angrily at the sight of her while Natasha kept her eyes right on him.
After he defeated Vanko and his drones, he had ordered Jarvis to locate and hack into Shield and Fury’s personal computer and got rid of every trace.
Maria wasn’t stupid she knew Howard would want a successor but she had hope that it would be much later. The big problem was Maria was young, enjoying her life to the fullest and focus on her modelling. She hated the idea of being burdened by a screaming, crying, puking baby. Even the idea of a baby swell inside her, like a cancerous growth made her felt sick.
Grateful that he got away with just a hot ache in his arm from the force, Steve slowly got to his feet, panting slightly. He faced the two. "Are we done here?"
To say he was shocked seeing the first painting was an understatement. A devilishly handsome Anthony posed naked on a bed, looking out of the canvas so brazenly. It was covered in astounding detail, Anthony’s chest was perfectly replicated; each muscle and sinew line on his body was there. Tony didn’t know why he suddenly felt flustered. Every line and freckle on Anthony’s face was perfectly copied onto the painting. Steven Thorne must've had taken many weeks to get all of those right.
He could feel Steven's hardness pressing through the layers of cloth between them, and the sensation woke a desperate triumph in him and even more desperate hunger.
Maria was everything Howard needed in a wife. She was young, murderously beautiful, very fertile as she was a high level omega, and had enough wit and raw intelligence to be engaging to someone like him.
Iron Man pushed the button that opened the hatch and marched toward it, he wasn’t sure of the threat outside but he was ready to fight.
He couldn’t bring himself to say the words; they caught in his throat as he searched for any sign of Tony’s brightly colored suit. There was no trace of him and Steve had to say the words. He tried to force them up to his throat and out of his lips…
"You want me to put the HAMMER DOWN?" the Thunderer growled and Tony knew what will come.
"And you just might." He quipped back, got to work again.
Hulk shook his head in grief as he stared at Tony’s lifeless body before he roared so loudly that the ground under them shook. Steve had never heard such a desperate yet angry sound.
Tony pulled himself away to look at the empty cell container where Loki had been caged. Looking down at the hole Thor had fallen through, he wondered how the blond Alpha was faring. He didn’t think the big guy would die easily but fall from this height made he wondered if he ended up injured.
Steve couldn't contain the breathy laugh that escaped him at his soulmate’s ridiculousness. Thor and Hulk looked at the man in the iron suit with a look of disbelief. Tony almost died, and he came out laughing and joking around.
Steve looked at the file and reread it again and again. Hope blossomed in his chest. A rare type, a very high-level Omega. Steve had never met a high-level type Omega before but he heard they had really seductive pheromone and very fertile. Two per three chances to get pregnant during heat if caution wasn’t taken-and thus highly sought after and usually went for high-level Alpha or rich and powerful one.
Bruce laughed softly. "It... It is alright. I wouldn't come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy thing." Banner replied, looking at the screwdriver Tony was wielding. Tony looked over at him, smiled again, moving around the worktop.
“You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract!” Nick Fury’s voice heightened and Tony could hear the tension in his voice.
He is the moon when I lost in darkness and warmth when I shiver in cold,
Their eyes held for a moment and a flurry of ripe unguarded expectation spur into the air, Hotspur and graphics. Recovering his composure Steven replied. “I-I’m a painter,” he stuttered.
Everyone he had known before being frozen was long gone, and just as he had finally begun to see Tony in a new light, he would lose the other half of his soul. How fair was that?
Level or sexual caste doesn’t indicate who is strongest only level of pheromone induces and fertility though usually higher level and sexual caste usually gets higher position in the pack. But we all know Avengers are hardly normal pack and Steve and Tony are going to be co-leader while Steve is an alpha and Tony is an Omega.
Rhodey: Low level Alpha. He was discriminate because he is not muscly like other Alpha but he prove them wrong. He is an Alpha through and through.
That night Steve had fallen asleep hugging Tony’s file to his chest, he had a dream.
Thor growled, squared up to Loki and stepped closer. “You listen well, brother! I...” He started before he was tackled by a fast-flying man in a metal suit, taking him far away from Loki.
Steve could feel the one eye glare burned into him as he continued jabbing the punching back, each pound harder than the last. No amount of refusal seemed to deter Shield from trying to enlist him and since the Tesseract was stolen, they grew even more determined. It was freaking annoying!
Obadiah: high level alpha
Steve’s world silently crumbled.
Tried lightening the mood, he turned to the crew and called “Raise the mizzenmast! Jib the topsails!” It didn’t work as he had thirty pairs of reproachful eyes turned on him. Pointing to the corner he called out, “That man is playing Galaga. Thought we wouldn’t notice. But we did.” Again with the reproachful look, was all Shield agents didn’t have a sense of humor.
Summoned his fallen hammer, Thor quickly climbed to his feet and thrust the hammer to the sky. Pealing clap of thunders streaked the sky and a wild storm brewed about them. Thor drew the lightning towards his hammer. With a grunt, he channeled the electronic bolts on Tony before he could swerve out the way, trying to override his power.
Palms to palms, their hands met, fingers gripping hard like a soul grasping another. They watched each other as Steve filled him until it seemed that the two of them were melting against each other, and Tony didn’t know where he ended or where Steve began.
“Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy.” Bruce’s voice was a level higher and they could hear the tension in his voice. He jabbed his pen angrily at the accusing weapon design picture on the monitor.
To Steve's surprise, Bruce was smiling, clearly enjoying Tony's attention.
Loki blinked, his eyebrows curled “Well, yes.” he said it like it was obvious and Thor was stupid for even asking.
"STARK, SO HELP ME GOD IF YOU MAKE ONE MORE WISE CRACK ABOUT..." Steve’s eyes snapped with imperious blue fire, he was furious that once again his soulmate was being suicidal.
Steve’s heart sunk, how could this be his soul-mate?! It seemed like Tony had inherited all Howard’s bad habit and blew it out of the water.
It took him weeks to finalize the renovation plans. And as much as he hated to admit it he spent longer personalizing Steve’s floor. He chalked it down on pity. After everything Steve had gone through he could at least build a room that could be Captain America’s escapade and comfort from his pain of losing everything (including his soulmate). It was the only thing Tony could do for him since he planned to avoid Steve as much as possible outside of duty.
At the thought of Dominant Omega, his thought went to Peggy again. He had always admired her strength and charisma. He didn’t know how it was now, but generally, Alphas in his time wouldn’t even consider a Dominant Omega or would try to get them on their knees. But not him, he had never minded giving up power to his partner in the bedroom he preferred it.
And his kiss still thrills me,’
Sorry. Pendragon tells me I talk about politics too much. That it is off putting for fellas.
“What, you gonna have a beef with ‘em because they set you up with some dandy? Even high-hats must feel the way you do.” Bucky shrugged. “Would also explain why he couldn’t just go to the clubs. More chances of running wrong of the cops.”
“Nah, don’t you worry a bit about that. Got them this far; I should be able to get them the last little leg.” Michael paused just inside the door to toe-off his shoes before carrying the art supplies over to the kitchen table. He dropped them on top of the surface, causing the table to give something of an ominous creak. “Sweetheart, did you really need to bring all this to do a sketch or two?”
I have seen a platypus and that is one of the nicknames I have for Rhodey. He has way too many nicknames and I am probably going to have far more for you. Sometimes I wonder if whatever’s up there has a sick sense of humour sometimes.  But well I’ve made it out of everything so far right?
Waking up in the Garage on New Year's was different. Tony hadn’t attended any parties. He’d made all the Christmas ones that were before Christmas and just stayed in once those were over. That morning, he rolled off the couch and ran a hand through the nest of curls atop his head. After a cup of coffee, he began working on his to-do list that Pep had been hounding him to complete. By lunchtime, he had emailed over the designs he’d wanted done and the cellphone upgrades he was putting in place to Research and Development. He then dragged himself over to the mailbox. The blizzard was done according to Friday, and the newest letter sat in the spot Dum-E had been programmed to place it on. Tony gave the bot a fond pat and took the letter, and its accompanying painting, as he sat on the unofficial letter writing chair.
Also the movie they refer to as Angel Street is known as Gaslight to the rest of the world. The version they watch is the 1940 movie. Which studios in America marketed as Angel Street to make sure it wouldn't be confused with the movie they were making with the same title and based on the play of the same name.
Should we let Franklin be the judge?
“That’s very kind of her. Would I have seen your work anywhere?” Tony asked with a little grin. At least he was hitting things on the wish list of questions he’d ask Steve Rogers list he’d made ages ago. High school Tony was having a party, he was finally at least hitting the g rated questions he’d wanted to ask. Lord help him if he ever got to the R-rated ones.
Grant,
I think … I am a little jealous of Pendragon. Growing up, he could get anyone he wanted. I never saw him go without a date or a partner on the dance floor. Or to take home. But I could never find the right partner. Now that he has the love of his life, I look at him and just wonder… why not me? Why do I not have that? It is difficult, because I do not want to talk to him about those feelings. Or even Franklin, if I am honest. Because Franklin is the same way, just with the molls. When we would go to the dance halls, the dames would swarm him, and he always gets his choice of partners. I do not think he has ever had a girl turn him down, Lee aside. Then again… I get the feeling you are the same way. Maybe something is broken in me.
The hall, which Steve supposed had once been the mess, teamed with life. Howlies moved to raid the larder and sort the omegas into different categories of needs. By the time darkness was falling, most everyone was asleep because of the exhaustion of the day.
But pictures. What would you want?
The buzz of life that came with spring in the city drew a smile to Steve’s lips. Birds chittered at each other, and children yelled in delight as they played a game of chase. All of the trees had erupted with a beautiful mix of blossoms and leaves, painting the clear blue sky with splashes of colour. It was a relief, after the harshness of the winter, to see signs that life persevered. Coming up to his favourite bench, Steve collapsed on it with a little sigh. He gazed out over the plaza, admiring the way the light played across the water of the Pulitzer Fountain. When he had been a kid, Central Park had been an absolute disaster. A large shantytown had cropped up at one end of the green, and one of the meadows had been completely overrun by sheep. Monuments had been vandalized, benches broken, and weeds run rampant. Robert Moses sure had done a bang-up job in revitalizing the gardens and cleaning everything up. Now it was a beautiful place, though very much a work in progress as several parts of the park were still under construction.
Grant
“You really haven’t been, I mean you had some weird shit happen in December that I definitely kicked your ass for. But do your thing I guess?” Maria shrugged.
If this is something that is going to take ages to fix one of the first things I am going to do after I kiss you is sink my teeth into your ear punk. And then probably kiss you again.
“Yes, and you can definitely say that you had sex,” Tony added with a chuckle.
Steve and Tony bond over having really, really awful dads.
Edward
Explaining his choice of gifts in a letter form, though, proved to be a great deal more difficult. Steve hemmed and hawed over the words, struggling to capture the rush he had felt in those moments of inspiration. Ultimately, he erred on the side of brevity, trying his best to avoid looking like a fool.
Happy early birthday. I hope you like them. Pendragon sends his regards.
The point is to enjoy it, Grant. The mental image of me nibbling at you. Kissing you until you don't want to stand up straight.  I'd want to know you were enjoying yourself because I like knowing that
Edward,
“Oof. Okay. I am pretty sure I am going to put that money into helping it get restored, and because it’s Steve. Get it moved somewhere it’ll get the care. But alright, have you ever been to the Carlyle? “
Steve lives through the worst day of the year, while Tony makes some regrettable life choices
“Hi, Tony,” Maria grinned before she got him in the shoulder with the pellets.
And the smell! Steve nearly started to salivate when he caught the scent of the corn dogs and funnel cakes; the popcorn and pies; the hot dogs and clam bakes. It all smelled divine. Edward would certainly want him to spend at least a little of the money eating, Steve was certain. Surely that was part of what the other man referred to as “treating yourself.” And maybe he could spare some money to ride on the Parachute Jump or the Cyclone. Just to live a little. But before he did any of that, he had to see about getting those pictures made. (It just wouldn’t do for his hair to be a wreck in the photos; Edward would never draw his hair right then.)
I sort of wished Bella had stabbed the guy. Violence is not the answer, but being robbed of your mind is something I would probably want to hurt someone over. That said, “What knife?” and watching the light die from that man’s eyes for a moment was visceral.
"I just have a couple things I need to do first," Tony firmly replied.
"No, not at all. I am calling it a missed connection which just shows how much I should work on networking.  And I mean they should at least know me by some reputation Ty." Tony grinned and tried to wave the situation off - trying to remain calm.
I also submitted my final sketch to the PWAP office. They said it looks real good and very American. Though I think one of them gave me a leery look for putting Rhodey in there. But I just stared him down. Because America is not just white folks. If anything, I want my next mural to be of a jazz scene, catching the way the community hums with a different energy. And maybe after that I can sneak in some of my fellow artists into a mural, remind the world that not everybody is fitting to marry a woman and have a bunch of kids.
“Gooseberries, black currants, I think that would have had me covered,” Demi grinned as she watched Tony make a mental note. She moved off her mat and started rolling it. “How is your tech disaster friend?”
So that was part of his life now.  Still texting Patricia (Pat please), or Maxim March, had only led him to more questions than answers. How could one woman be so busy? And the strangest stories. He joked about Grant being a vigilante, but Pat. Pat made him wonder.
And then the letter took a turn.
I really wish I could just fire him, but it’s a board of directors. I would need to provide a reason besides I DON’T LIKE HIM. Because he’s been on the board for years and just wheedling his way into more power. I can’t just barge in his office and steal files that way. That would be so stupid and dangerous. If I could fake my death that would be great, but it would not be responsible because he’d run roughshod over everything and it would be really hard to get back in my control.
And … that. Does help. I like reading comics, so it makes sense that it would be easier to read writing like that. How did you know that would help?
Tony laughed as she did some kind of leg routine before lowering herself again. “Did I miss any other dietary requirements?”
“Yes. Want to know what helped lead to him getting all these murals?” Tony asked with his phone at the ready. Ready to show off the magazine covers he’d had Friday dig up.
Reaching over, Bucky wrapped his hand around the nape of Steve’s neck and gave it a squeeze. “You’re welcome, punk. Though, maybe you could try to take better care of yourself, huh? Make me worry a little less?”
I am real sorry that you are so worried about your safety, though. I cannot imagine living every day wondering if one of the people around me was going to try to poison me or something. Honestly, I would probably do more than jump out the window; I would move to the other side of the country. At least then I might have an excuse to avoid their parties. But you are a brave man for sticking it out. I do not know what keeps you there, but I do hope you stay safe. The world would be a sadder place without you in it.
As always, we do our best to research and keep this fic as correct as we can. But sometimes mistakes happen... and sometimes our beta process isn't the best. So if you find any errors, feel free to let us know! Or you can just scream in the comments to tell us about your feelings... we enjoy that a lot.
I feel as if there might be one or two people I could ask about experiments with unexpected results. Like the sudden appearance of Mr. Hyde. There are some really damn wild experiments going on out here. Wild in the nature of the experiments and results from them. It’s just really wild all around, to be honest. It’s a changing world out there Grant.
So, Hobbit?
Grant.
Edward,
People are going to keep assigning bullshit about work and gender and keep shovelling it to kingdom come. It’ll get better. I have to think that, you know?
I'm very glad to make you happy there honey. You deserve some sweetness. I was too young to know how much everything cost for my parents, but the highway robbery doesn't surprise me. Everyone deserves a burial fitting their faith. But the church is not my favorite institution for exactly the reason you bring up Grant. Shoving the poor further under the rug.
After a moment Tony grabbed the new wallet, tracing his fingers over the patterns and opening it to look at the photos again. The simple shot that Tony was pretty sure followed the Booth instructions but was cute. And then the piece de resistance. His little stubborn jerk holding out the flowers and having the nerve to look bashful.
Steve beamed up at his friend. “Thanks. I appreciate you going out of your way to do that for me.”
My first assignment is on the side of a grocery store over in the Bronx. I am thinking of doing a scene from a diner I like to frequent with Franklin, when we have the money for it. But instead of the usual patrons painting in people I know. Maybe some of your friends. I have included a sketch of Pendragon and Michael, plus one I am thinking of including with Maria and Rhodey. Should I put you and me in it too, honey?
Tony glared at the mailbox after he finished
"My dad was like that too sweetheart. Damnit. Not Sweetheart too personal Tony. Augh. Not that personal you called ‘sweethearts’ your sweetheart. Strike that out Friday. "
Bucky rolled his slate eyes. “The things I put up with for you…”
You feel so real to me, Eddie. Sometimes I almost imagine I can hear your voice. And your letters offer me so much happiness. Even if I never meet you, I would not regret a bit having our names thrown together. I am so proud of the way you have been working on being a better man. You are hard-working and kind and thoughtful. Anyone would be lucky to know you. Just do not give up on yourself, hear me? The world needs men like you.
This was a struggle and thank you for patience and love you so much for joining us this far. The next chapter might be a ways off because our struggle is not over yet. but we're trying. Make you have your tissues. Please send the positive vibes and well wishes our way because we will need them.
I wish both of us had better childhoods. Imagine if we were just a little bit less screwy; what a novel idea. But, it is what it is. I guess all either of us can do is to be better fathers to our own children. And by God I mean to. Because, I do want children. I may not want a wife, but I do want a family. I think I could at least do better than my father, though that is a fairly low bar. Maybe I could even be a real swell dad, someone who is able to make their kids’ lives amazing, you know? Teaching a daughter how to properly throw a punch, teaching a son how to shave, watching them as they slept – knowing that I helped keep them safe and happy every day. That is the real dream. Honestly, though, it seems even more of an impossibility than marrying a man does.
As for myself, I’m of… mixed heritage. My mother is Italian, so I have her coloring. Warm skin, dark eyes, and hair that can’t decide if it wants to curl or go every which way. Otherwise I’ve been told I look like my father and grandfather. Which I guess is kind of a mixed bag since reportedly they weren’t always the nicest men.
Erskine had agreed: Steve’s fighting spirit had been what allowed the serum to work. A lesser alpha would never have been able to withstand the pain - the unmaking - of the serum.
“Your fella sure doesn’t hold back on gifts,” the brunet griped. “I was sure my arms were ‘bout to fall off haulin’ that through the city. Shoulda made you go get it yourself.”
Stooping, Steve carefully pulled out the photo and gazed down at his likeness. His hair was a bit feathery as it swept over to the side of his face, and the stark shadows of the booth made his eyes stand out - even in black and white. The shot was surprisingly good. Almost like Steve was offering the viewer the flowers, hiding shyly behind them in a bout of nerves. It was cute. And definitely not platonic. Slipping it into his coat pocket, Steve went back into the booth and sat down once more. Another coin, and another photo. This time, though, Steve gazed into the lens with a soft smile. Sure, the photo wasn’t as pretty as the first one, but it was definitely safer. With a nod, he slipped the second photo into his pocket before leaving the flowers in the booth, hoping someone would find them and enjoy them before they wilted too badly.
Reaching over, Bucky squeezed the nape of Steve’s neck. “You deserve good things, kid. I hope the dream lasts a long, long time.” It went unspoken between them that the letters with Edward were, for all intents and purposes, nothing more than a fleeting fancy. In the world they lived in, there were clear expectations of what was right and proper. Two men falling in love and sharing their lives together was so far outside of that limit it could be a death sentence for them both. But for now, in these golden moments, Steve let himself forget the real world. Instead, he imagined a place where one day, if he were lucky, maybe he could share his life with another man. They could build a home and family together, maybe have a house in the countryside where the air would be better for Steve’s lungs. When his dreams got particularly wild, the blond even imagined them raising a baby together, getting a dog, maybe even a cat too just because. His dreams were as big as the sky and just as impossible to hold on to.
Tony disappeared down to the workshop, where the letter draft was still waiting on the work table. He skimmed over it, making a few corrections, before grabbing the Conklin pen and the nice paper. The motion of rewriting the letter helped to soothe him further, helping his thoughts fall more orderly within the storminess of his brain. More than that, though, he smiled a moment at the thought of Grant, his little spitfire. Well, not his. The spitfire who, against all odds, would be reading Tony’s thoughts on a movie more than sixty years old. Shaking his head at the thought, he let the ink dry before sending the letter.
I know it has not been very long since my last letter, but Franklin said my first effort was ‘a piece of work.’ So, I thought I would try again. Just in case the first one maybe did not convince you I was worth writing back to.
“Friday, you mind annotating what I’m saying? Starting in five seconds. Document name draft one since I don’t want to write a letter twice right now.”
PS: How about by the next letter or the one after have chapter one read of the Hobbit? Is that enough time?”
“Right.”
I’m sorry for your neighbor's loss. I’m not sure it’s going to get better for a while. If you or Franklin have family over there and they are saying horrible things are happening... Believe them.
After a few days of meetings that Tony was irked couldn't be switched to another week he was finally home. The letter was neatly sealed with some small sketches of trees he'd done in between meetings of what he could see from the windows. They still looked a bit too much like clouds. Pepper and Jarvis had sent pictures for him of the celebration for Rhodey's promotion. But it still wasn't the same. Tony couldn't shake the feeling Obie was trying to isolate him.
Tony put away his phone as the members of the board arrived for the meeting. He tried to focus on maintaining an air of nonchalance as Obie arrived, exactly on time, and settled in at the chair to his left. Unsettlingly, the meeting went about in the usual manner. Which now bothered Tony. Because he wondered just how much of the meetings were out of his control. What decisions were being made without him? What was being done behind his back? Just who was in on Obie’s schemes? Tony focused carefully on the presentation, trying to keep his brain occupied and from spiralling further.
“Probably not. But I would know if it isn’t because of your project,” Jarvis gestured at Tony’s math and research then glanced back at him. “I’m a little surprised you aren’t a touch further in that.”
"Shawarma after, then?" Tony was undeterred, looking around again as he got his breath back. Steve chuckled, offered the man his hand. Tony scowled at his hand but he was too tired to argue so he took Steve’s hand and pulled himself up. His heart didn’t flutter, and he didn’t shiver from the warm tingled along his spine.
Howard hanker for something his wife couldn’t give, nay she wasn’t even close to being good enough for him anymore. Nothing was good enough for him anymore so he turned to the bottle to forget his woes.
Steve had resisted learning about current technology but for the first time since he woke up, it was good being Captain since it was easier to get SHIELD agent to help him surf the thing called the Internet. They found mainstream stuff of Iron Man that help reinforced Iron Man’s hero image.
You reminded me of my parent and what they did to me, Tony could say. I hated you since I am 8 I didn’t know if I could get over it, Tony could say. I didn’t want to end up like Maria, Tony could say. You wouldn't want a broken man and would end up hating me anyway so it was only wise that I pushed you away, Tony could say.
Loki seemed to have the upper hand. Tony needed to do something. It was, first and foremost, a clear indication of how fucked up he was that he wasn’t the least afraid of fighting a craze superpower alien but was very much afraid of meeting his soul mate.
Dream
He could hear the sound of Rogers and the others talking.
Then Maria’s shock started crumbling away to make room for – to give her the first taste of – a whole new world of pain. The kind of pain that made her wanted to rip her heart out of her chest. An ache that will always be there, no matter what. It's not numbed, and it's omnipresent. The room blurred in front of her eyes as her tears fell unbidden.
“Is not this simpler?” Loki's voice was now powerful and crystal clear as the crowd had gone completely quiet
A beeping alerted him and Bruce to the completion of his download. Tony's monitor showed a collection of secret files. Scanned, his eyes were immediately drawn to one particular deadlocked and coded file.
"Sir, we're losing altitude." JARVIS informed him worriedly.
A genius inventor as a child, graduated from MIT ridiculously young, lost both his parents at 19. He became CEO of Stark Industry a powerful international company that manufacturing weapons at 21 and changed it from a multimillionaire company to a multibillionaire company in only a few years. Tony had several PhDs.
Tony tapped at his lip with a regular pen; he was still not quite confident enough with the nib on the Conklin pen to write a first draft with that. He sat in the garage working out his reply, tapping his toes to the music blaring out over the speakers.
If it weren’t a conflict of interest, considering she was teaching him to fight and could kick his ass seven ways to Sunday, Tony would want to take Maria Hill for a drink. But, asking her out in any capacity would be something of a moot point, as she had been discharged for having a relationship with another woman. Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell was a nightmare, but at least it gave Tony an excellent teacher. She went to work quickly training him in a wide variety of combat techniques: drilling him in urban conflict, tactical thinking, and how to find spaces to hide in. Her taking his aim from pretty good to amazing was a great benefit too.
I think the gift might help. There's also Maria's writing in there too.
“You really do need to eat. Sacrificing your safety isn’t going to make it better for anyone. It’s not me, but someone has got to have some kind of hunting or trapping skills. You have strength and skills that are just as useful, barter some for yourself too." Tony suggested.
Bucky blinked up at the clear delight on the blond’s face. “You two are madder than a bucket of cats.” He hesitated. “It’s cute. I’m glad you’ve got a good fella. And that it worked out between ya.”
-Grant
“Oh lord,” Maria snorted before dumping more ice on him. “Is this your artist friend that you have a little gallery over there for?”
Have I ever mentioned how much I like it when you call me sunshine? Never fails to make me smile.
And I am so angry and frustrated about all of that.
The blond licked his bottom lip, weighing his words carefully. “What if … he doesn’t really want me, though? Like. What if I really am just some distraction for him?”
And yes. Hobbit time
And then came the worst reveal of all. Paul was not who he said he was, but instead the vanished murderer returned to find the lost jewels. His wife had mistakenly uncovered his past, leading Paul to decide to destroy her credibility by destroying her mind. By the climax of the film, as the cops stopped Paul from attempting violence against his wife, Steve was nearly on his feet. He both loved and hated every moment of the film, but felt a grim sort of satisfaction to see the murderer clapped in irons.
Hopefully, the next chapter won't be as long of a wait. But I can't guarantee anything. While this one is a short four pages the next chapter is at 16 pages so far with areas that still need expanding.
It was definitely a lack of something - self preservation or inhibition, maybe - that brought the thought further detail. He imagined sharp, clever fingers reaching to pinch a little meanly. Maybe the guy would leave a mark where he could reach. Tony groaned imagining it: sharp bony hips against his ass and hair a bit blonder than the sight behind him. It took a moment before he realized he was fantasizing about Grant. Damnit, dammit it was so wrong.
I am not going anywhere.  Darling, you have to trust that. I know it's going to be hard to trust anything right now.  But I am doing my damndest to be okay. You have to put some faith in your friends too. They are skilled people who want to come home to you and their loved ones.  It's going to be hard.
I can show you some exploded views I did a while back. They’re in the envelope. So sunshine, I hope this improves your day too.
Grant,
Tony wanted to throw up from his nerves about the response. Whether it was because Franklin was busy and just couldn’t make it there. Or because Franklin could have gotten a cold. When he got home from a series of meetings with Pepper and the board, (which needed far too much convincing about a really damn good idea), it was a relief to finally sit and read the letter.
A wireless phone? That sure would be a miraculous device. Our building does not even have a private line, so I can barely fathom how different it would be if people had access to phones just wherever they went. Gosh. What would they even do with them?
Sorry.
“Name specific people who will receive your things do not divide anything among your board. Talk to my lawyer and see if they can get you assistance with the corporate part of it,” Jarvis mused as Tony looked over multiverse theory.
Ps: So were you warm enough like that?
Grant. I repeat, are you trying to kill me? Because, yeah, I can imagine that: you in my garage, draping your legs over a couch and sketching away. Also, Sweetheart, any of the nicknames you mention are perfect. I will also accept jerk and punk. I think I’ve referred to you both in my head and to some friends as my favorite vigilante, brat, honey, my artist, (Pepper has asked literally ‘How’s your artist doing’ and I’ve told her how you’ve been). Not sure how friend-like that sounds, but I really do like talking about you.
“They died. It was highly classified and the only person I feel even safe talking to about this is Agent Carter of the SSR. And that’s only in a very private circumstance.” Tony said urgently. “It’s why I was so desperate to get out of there.”
“He already knows you’re butch as hell. Thinks you and Pepper should try dating. Remember he saw the Shakespeare night pics,” Tony added as Maria shifted her weight. She was standing very still like she was holding her ground.
Will ao3 list the thing having three chapters now finally. Let's find out.
Arnie swatted at Michael’s chest. “I question it too.”
It would be fine.
“I forget sometimes that you only help curate the art portion of things on my walls,” Tony quipped as he brought the certificate down from near the door. He worked quickly to get the certificate free.
“You know,” Serena said slowly, “the guy next to him looks a lot like you. Any relation?” Never mind the fact they both had the same strange facial hair. She shot Demi a befuddled look.
Catching sight of the brunet, Ty clapped slowly.  “If it isn’t the genius, finally descending from his throne to be with us mere mortals.” Once Tony was close enough, the blond grabbed his wrist just a little too tightly and growled in his ear: “Tony, you’re late. Didn’t I tell you to be here an hour ago? You’ve embarrassed me in front of my friends.”
After reading the letter, Tony was finally left with one impression on the letter that he needed to fix right away as he wrote.
Just in case that doesn't come through,  I am teasing.  So I can just imagine whatever brows. Alright, how have I failed in rendering what must be a fine jaw, Grant? An even sharper angle?
Cleaning the air, in general, is a thing I want to do. Finding power sources that reduce the amount of smoke getting put in the air is a good start. There are air filtration devices for personal use short term that you can make. But I think you mean large scale and getting the funding for those is a pain in the ass. Getting people to use less coal and fossil fuel would be the better start.
“I can close it. Can anybody copy?” She said into her wrist receiver, holding the staff steady in her hand as she waited to hear from her teammates. “I can shut the portal down.” She clarified, panting and staring into the glowing revolving tesseract power pouring out of the machine in front of her.
(See the end of the chapter for
The word arrogant bastard reminded him of their recent argument and all his reasons to be mad at Rogers.
Maria felt hatred toward that bitch unlike anything she’d ever felt toward another person. She knew her. She had sat at her dinner table. How could anyone knowingly cheat with a married man? A father of one? What did she expect to get from it besides a bigger office? Maria was baffled.
He waited with bated breath to hear Tony say something and let out a sigh of relief when his soulmate did.
They got onto the plane and Iron Man hesitated a moment-for once hating how heavy his pheromone smelt -before finally removed his helmet, he needed to face his bogart head on.
“Son of a bitch.” Tony grouched. Steve, to his credit, just gave him a look. “The Stark Tower.” The brunet supplied and paused just a second before shot toward his workstation without a backward glance. He needed to get the suit fixed to fly.
“Nah. We’ll get one of those posh portraits. Like folks do when they get hitched. We can hang it in our bedroom someday.” Arnie and Michael shared a quiet smile at that, and it made Steve’s heart ache for them. Even if the pair were to live together, all anyone would ever see them as was unusual roommates and irresponsible bachelors. But that would have to be enough for them, for the time being. “But we will get out of your hair. Figure you might want to get those in the mail sooner rather than later.”
Tony nearly fell right on his ass, he stumbled back leaning against the wall to take in the full picture. Them. It was them how Steve had described them when he had gone to Central Park. On a private rainy evening a soft moment where he’d steal a kiss. And Steve had gotten away with it. He wheezed out a breath as his knees gave. This mural was Steve shouting from the rooftops and Tony choked out a sob as he felt his eyes spillover.
“It sounds like you’ve got a lot of things you are fearing. That can’t be good for your heart old man.” Tony lounged against the couch “But... Yeah. Those. Who would do that?”
-Grant
The future scares me, when I think about it. Isn’t that rich? I am so desperate to live – to make it through all the illnesses my body squares off with – and yet I worry it might not be worth winning that fight. Maybe it is my upcoming birthday making me feel this way. Franklin always says I get extra philosophical when I think too much about birth and death. He may be right. Sorry if this was a bit too much for you.
There are people I know in the scientific community looking into the sort of difficulty you’re describing. How the letters kind of swim around for you. The one used in comics is a kind of font that has proven easier to read. I could write to you like this instead if you want on a more regular basis.
He had a thing that fucked with time in his own lab, surely he could figure out something that could bring him through time. But Tony didn’t have all the pieces for that puzzle - yet. He needed to focus on what he can do, which is to write Grant back another letter.
Throughout it all, Steve did his best to keep his boyfriend up to date on his artistic endeavours. He often sent sketches of pieces he was working on, including a rather detailed portrait of Louis Armstrong wailing on his trumpet that was set to greet visitors as they entered the bar. There was also an entire wall filled with dancing couples, pressed cheek to cheek as they moved to the imaginary music. True to form, Steve snuck Jarvis and Ana into the group of dancers. And he painted his own ma seated with Winifred and George at a table in the room. He was also sure to include the many amazing Black performers and artists he had seen in the clubs he and Buck had ventured to. The owner of the Carlyle had been quite fidgety when he had noticed, but Steve had explained that it simply could not be a true jazz mural without them. Plus, Steve thought to himself, jazz simply would not exist without Black people, so why shouldn’t they be featured? If he could have gotten away with it, the entire audience would be filled with the Black Americans who made Harlem what it was.
The Irish-American’s thin lips pulled into a decided pout. “Buck, come on. It’s my letter. You can’t keep it from me.”
He got a text earlier from Pat of 'Happy Birthday.' Then she sent photos that were showing her helping weigh tiger cubs at a rescue reserve.  It was so cute he wanted to burst.
“You alright, honey?” The warm, comforting voice of Lee came drifting down the hall.
“... You never mentioned a boyfriend before.” There was an almost dangerous undertone to George’s words, prickling at the artist’s spine.
-Grant
Are you screaming? We're screaming.
-Grant
If he could just make it upstairs, Tony thought, he would be able to get coffee. Fresh, delicious coffee. Yes, that sounded nice. As he made it upstairs, Jarvis peered at him from over the edge of his newspaper. Two fresh mugs were waiting on the counter, one of which the elderly man pushed slightly forward. “Good morning,” he drawled, amusement making his green eyes twinkle. Tony grumbled a half coherent answer before burying himself in the caffeinated offering.
Your holidays sounded great. Jarvis makes some of the best baked goods I’ve ever had. I think you’d enjoy it. If I could, I’d send you a bunch of it; give you enough to share with Franklin’s family. And this year I dodged all of the mistletoe, thankfully. I think I climbed a window one time to do it. But I did it. Don’t like the tradition that much.
A thoughtful look graced Arnie’s features as he glanced up from preparing his drawing board. “Roll around on the sheets a bit. Muss up your hair and the bedding.”
After a short nap, Steve finally sat curled up in the windowsill. The rain had come back, washing out the streets into a grey haze. He had wrapped a quilt tightly around his body, just to protect his chest from the chill in the air, as he considered the blank page. Somehow, it was even harder to write Edward after acknowledging the way his feelings kept bubbling up stronger and stronger. But, he had to try.
“Yeah. Guess you ain’t managed to scare him off just yet. Pretty thick little envelope, too.” Bucky slid his hands into his pockets and rocked on his heels. “Seems like a good sign to me. If he were sick of your mugging, he would’a just wrote you a quick note and been done with it all.”
“So you’re saying it would be a standard press date, and then just an actual stay in date with optional sex. If it goes like you said it would, would it be okay if I scheduled that after a shoot? Sounds like it could be relaxing.”
Sleep well,
To my favorite Vigilante,
“Not mad since it’s not the real one that is at the Stark Tower building and it was your idea to put it up anyway?” Pepper mused, possibly stirring her tea; he could hear the spoon hitting the cup.

My Darling Treasure,
Tony almost wrote yours. He almost wrote yours at the end of a letter where Grant was just talking about someone coming onto him way too strongly.  And creepily.
Feeling ever so put upon, Bucky waved a mittened hand at the house. “Alright, Arnie. Let’s get this over with.”
Wandering over to it, Steve traced a finger over the R that curled its way across the heavy paper. Did he feel up to reading a letter? Going back over to the stove, he carefully put his pot of water to boil and prepped his cup. All the while keeping one eye on the envelope.
, Tony made an order for chalk pastels and stretched out on the couch. Jarvis nestled with his knit blankets as they watched Sean Connery, and they both eventually fell asleep with Tony dreaming of holding lithe, bony arms to him. He dreamed about long fingers stroking through his hair and being held like he was a precious thing. Of being someone
I just want to be safe. I want the people I love to be safe.
Because I also don’t have any solutions for our predicament yet. I haven’t had time to dedicate properly to that. There is so much math involved, Sunshine. And figuring out work over there. A lot of things. But I have daydreamed about it. My question is. Until I figure it out, would you be content with our correspondence? Or is there more you want? I don’t know any solutions yet but I won’t know that until you ask.
“Having a personal driver could seem like something I would have if I was drunk for extended amounts of time,” Tony muttered tapping at his chin while Maria raised an eyebrow.
Any Other World is a B-Side from Mika's album Life In Cartoon Motion.
A tiny sliver of a smirk caught itself on George’s lips. “All I did was see some talent and try to hold onto it for myself. Nothing to thank me for.”
Steve blushed. “Yeah, I do. Thank you again.”
“You’ll have to put it to the pack,” Steve said firmly. “I may be the commanding officer, but we work as a team. And any additions have to be approved unanimously.”
“I was a bit surprised to find out you two weren’t an item, based on how he hovers over you,” George admitted. Stopping in front of a door, he twisted the handle. “Though I’m glad you aren’t.” When Steve went to walk into the door, the editor blocked the way with his arm. Leaning in close, he gazed down into the blond’s bright cerulean eyes. “Anybody ever tell you how beautiful you are, Steven?”
I love your comics so much. They are a delight. Maybe you should quit being an engineer and draw for the papers instead. Sir Grant would be the champion of children everywhere. But the adventures he goes on with Lord Kitt... I am sure those would be my favorite. Sir Grant gets a bit lonely going through the world by himself.
Tony slipped a sketch of Jarvis - done in a lot of heavy angles, to look sort of like a robot with a J in the corner with the letter - along with the funds into the envelope. Two dollars in a few quarters and some nickels were folded up in paper to keep from being immediately obvious in case the mailbox was accessible by other people who needed money. The man looked down at the envelope and sighed, closing it. Into the mailbox it went.
“Well as long as it would be of use, but just how do you think it would be of help to them in the alley,” Jarvis mused as he started rinsing off the dishes. Tony loaded the dishwasher in a slight daze and nodded at the reminder. Tony thought of the reminder now on his shoulder and still healing.
April rain ran thick down the windows one evening as Steve sat listening to Ben play the piano for their little group. Arnie and Buck had been unable to tag along, as both were working late, but Steve had assured them he would be fine. After all, he knew everyone in the house, and the walk was not actually that far. But that had been before the rain started to fall. Frowning, Steve peered through the curtains at the silvered streets. “Looks like it’s coming down cats and dogs,” Lee commented lightly. “Sure you wanna go outside in that, honey?”
“Sure am,” the other man agreed. “The absolute worst.” He leaned over to steal a kiss from those pouting lips. “Makes me question your taste, what with you keepin’ me around.”
I was both delighted and surprised to receive your letter. Franklin was becoming frustrated with how often I would ask if any new mail had come; whenever he would come to visit he would not even greet me before telling me there was nothing new. But today! Today he came, armed with his ma’s soup and his sister’s bread, with good news for me. He had a letter. And when I read your words I felt flustered and enthralled. You have such a pretty way of saying things that it almost seemed you were speaking right into my heart. I am simply grateful Franklin did not notice the way your words made me blush, as he would never let me forget it.
“We could cab it, I have it covered. As a heads up, the other guy at the Jukebox is the guy's boyfriend. They met through a little letter service,” Tony explained as he scrolled back to the picture showing them. Scrolling past a couple of pictures of her he’d taken for Demi. “He’s a teacher at that point and Steve tells his friend that they are great for each other”
Grant,
He slipped into the slicker and pulled the hood up over his head. “Thanks, Lee. I appreciate it.”
And I would pay money to see you dancing in your garage. It would be real fun to draw you dancing around or working on your cars. I bet you smile a lot while doing either, and that would be … real fine.
I’m looking forward to it too, Grant. With everything happening I am worried. I think I’d make myself of more worth off the field than in the war proper. But I worry about your friends. Pendragon and Franklin seem strong and able bodied. Am I wrong in thinking you worry too? A movie is a great distraction for that. And I do think Franklin and I would end up making you laugh like that. Has the medicine been helping you?
I feel so called out. How did you know? Because yes, I do dance around the garage. One of the things my mother had insisted on were taking me to dance lessons. And those continued for a good while because Jarvis figured they helped me get excess energy out of my system. Which I guess they did, between that and all the building and tinkering. I would have driven people crazy.
After finishing his breakfast, because it never did to waste food, Steve retreated to his apartment to change into his Sunday best. Admittedly the shirt was too big - one of Bucky’s hand me downs - and the pants were wearing thin in the knees. But, the blond knew his ma would appreciate the effort for what it was. He then slung on his winter coat, ignoring the way it overwhelmed his figure, before going to collect Bucky.
The moment the man’s identity clicked, her mouth fell open. “Captain Steve Rogers?” She could see it, in the bird bone frailty of the blond and the fierceness of his eyes. “You have letters from Steve Rogers about his art…” Turning to Tony, she hesitated. “Maybe you could provide historians with edited versions? Or put together an art exhibit. Since you feel like people have forgotten he was an artist before he was ever a hero. Those are absolute treasures.”
Tony took a few notes on the paper about the nearest equivalents to his work. Weapons work was true, and working on communication devices. He was going to have to leave Friday out so far. She was a little too advanced to be talking about yet.
“I thought you had eyes only for me, sweetheart,” Ben drawled.
Jarvis leaned over and reached into the pen case, lifting the lining to show four more of the pen nibs. “It will not be the first time that’s happened. I can teach you as well. I might not have my wife’s talent for it, but I can teach and have decent penmanship,” Jarvis explained with a little bit of straightening his posture. He also lifted the lining a touch more to reveal a folded sheet of paper. “That also shows how to replace the nibs should you need it.”
Mostly letters. Some art. An important letter was answered.
Crouching down, Steve carefully cleaned off her headstone before setting the flowers across the top. His bottom lip wobbled as his spindly fingers traced over her name. “Hey Ma,” he croaked. “Brought you a real nice bouquet this time. I remembered how much you liked peonies. Always telling me about how you wanted a garden to plant some in one day, when I was a famous artist.” He rubbed his thumb at a bit of dirt stuck in the middle of one of the numbers on the headstone. “A friend of mine helped me get ‘em for you. I think you’d like him, Ma. He’s … he’s real smart. And he makes me happy.” Taking a shuddering breath, Steve tried to blink the tears out of his eyes. “Would you be happy for me? Would you still … still love me, Ma, if …” He could not even manage to choke out the words. Instead, he sat down hard on the ground and cradled his head in his hands, full-bodied sobs overtaking him.
-Grant
But that was not the reason for the blond’s petulance. Oh no, if it had been that simple Bucky could have found a way to cheer him up. It had been days since Steven had written his second letter, and each day Bucky had to remind him that it would take time for his recipient to get the mail. After all, the Wilde Society had to sort the mail and deliver it, then the other man had to have time to write back. But with each day, Steve became more and more confident that he had managed to chase the recipient away. (Buck was fairly certain the blond’s morose mood had more to do with being sick than thinking the letter would go unanswered.)
It's a new year, and with it comes some new inside jokes... and some surprising new friends.
Ducking his head, Steve turned absolutely red. “Uh, you could say that. I was part of an experiment, and it made me… much bigger and much healthier than I was.”
Just as a note, Tony and Steve do talk about their abusive dads, though it's not particularly explicit
“Malibu, you’re very obviously a Brooklyn boy,” Tony replied with a little chuckle. He glanced out in the night and squinted. He tried to focus on that and not how great Steve smelled. “Can’t escape the accent.”
You are banned from movie picking. Banned. Banned banned. I did not need those emotions in the middle of a movie theatre. There were a lot of them. I don’t claim to be super knowledgeable about children but there are things that went through my head.
And then Tony looked closer at the trees.
Okay, Jarvis or Rhodey hit a gold mine, Tony covered his mouth to smother a laugh as he read. The guy was cute from the sounds of it. Maybe a touch shy? Tony chuckled to himself as he continued reading. The fact this letter was never opened until that moment made him feel a little sad for the guy. Tony figured the letter had been confiscated or maybe just never sent, meaning the little artist had never gotten his hoped-for reply.
Tony changed to a regular pen "Friday can you bring up I guess… comic font." Tony mimicked that for the rest of the letter.
Steve gave his eyes a light roll. “Nothing naked,” he warned.
“If you can, that would be a hell of a feat,” Tony replied like there was a joke in there. “Might just figure out a way to stick with you.” It was probably the safest bet, Tony figured if need be he could try something using the tesseract as a power source to get back home. Or at least the tesseract fuelled power cells.
Bright laughter followed Bucky out the door as the blond made his promises to be on time and properly attired. Though he was not Jewish, Steve appreciated the devotion the Barnes family had for their faith. And he was always grateful that Mrs. Barnes considered him so much a part of the family that he was expected for their sabbath worship, even though he was Catholic to the core. It was not quite home, being with the Barneses, but it was something close.
“But we’ve got to help,” Steve whispered vehemently, fighting with his whole soul to keep his voice down. “The Allies need us!”
