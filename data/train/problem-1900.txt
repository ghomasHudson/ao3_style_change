Had he been too impulsive? Had it all happened too soon?
Emil turned the microphone away from his mouth. “What’s happening, exactly?”
She sounded genuinely remorseful, and Sherlock didn’t know how to respond. He was still angry, and an apology wouldn’t change the fact that he had become optimistic about John’s potential change of heart only to have that stripped away within minutes of arriving at the Crown hotel. Apologies held little weight without a change of circumstance.
The flight attendant gave him an obvious once-over. “Please, Mr. Holmes, let me know if I can help you with anything.” He winked.
61. Smelly cheese
“Please,” Sherlock heard himself plead. His mind shouted weakly, too far in the distance, something about destructive distractions.
As she walked back down the aisle, John shook his head. “I was hoping getting out of the country would prevent any fan run-ins.”
John nodded, bringing a finger to Sherlock’s lips. “Shh, it’s okay. Let’s just go inside, yeah? Just sit together. No expectations.” He squeezed his forearm in what was supposed to be a reassuring gesture, but in Sherlock’s vulnerable state, it bordered on patronizing.
“That brings me to my last point, which is that Harry was always right. She told me once that her drinking would kill her one day, and it
John dug his fingers into the skin underneath Sherlock’s trousers playfully. “Yeah, well, what’s new, Mr. I Take All the Air Out of the Room.”
John sat, crossing his legs in a mirror of the man across from him. Sherlock’s gaze lingered on his knees.
, for god’s sake. He always knew how to upstage the main act. And- the owner of the other voice caught up to him- why the hell was Rosie with him?
“I’ll tell you the details later. You need to sleep,” Sherlock replied, fighting against his impulses to pick John’s brain.
, John,” Sherlock pants, holding onto John by his hair.
He could hear John’s smile over the phone. “God, yes.”
he wants to kiss Sherlock.
In lieu of responding, he rebuttoned his shirt and put his trousers back together with as much dignity as one could muster with a glaring stain of dried semen down the front. John was staring at him with such confusion and disbelief, Sherlock had to turn away. “You can see yourself out,” he said coolly, willing John to get frustrated or offended at his aloofness and leave on his own accord.
journal is about his relationship with Sherlock Holmes.”
He knew she hadn’t meant to be condescending, but he took it that way. Sherlock smirked behind his tea.
“It’s so good John, oh god, you’re so good,” Sherlock pants into his mouth.
“What did Mycroft want?” John asked.
Sherlock’s chest lurched. If Sherlock was beautiful, then John was breathtaking, the grand finale of a fireworks display. His voice came out in a dry whisper. “I don’t mind.”
“You need sleep. Aren’t you the guest of honor or something? Father of the bride? 7am. Will you be there?”
“Bedroom, love? The heat from the fire should have warmed the house up a bit by now.” And with that, John was already half off of him, sitting up, straddling over Sherlock’s half-clothed chest.
“What?”
John wanted to rip up the message and leave the torn pieces on the platform, just to prove he could. Instead, he shoved the piece of paper deep inside his pocket, hoping he would forget it existed.
She tips her head curiously. “Nice to meet you, Sherlock. Although, I have to be honest, I already know who you are. I
Sherlock swallowed. He was still getting used to speaking to this post-John Watson Question John. “Late Christmas gift, perhaps.” Sherlock stiffly handed John his key.
5. More intelligent (as Mycroft insists he is to Sherlock)
She pushed on. “When I came home for Dad’s birthday in April, I was looking in his things for a token of his to wear for the wedding.”
Daddy held her closer. “Sorry, sweetheart. I can’t give details.”
Dad sighed. “I don’t know if he does.”
Thirty (five) minutes later, they stomped up the stairs to 221B, not wanting to see anything they might have interrupted earlier.
Rosie smiled into her piece of cake, the flavor Dad helped her choose. “I really, really hope so.”
Stella bit her lip in concentration. “I believe Sherlock Holmes has solved the case.”
“Stop wallowing, John. I can hear it from here,” Sherlock calls absently from the sitting room.
Sherlock turned to face John and lowered his own voice intentionally. “That’s Mr. Watson-Holmes to you.”
Word of the wedding announcement had spread, and with Rosie’s infamy on the Isle of Man and her growing name recognition on a larger scale, a group of Douglas tourists and natives alike gathered on the street to watch.
Somehow, days until her last, she still had that sparkle in her eye that meant Sherlock had understood her in a way that went deeper than deduction. “I embraced it. Age, death, loss, heartbreak, the lot of it. And look at me now. I don’t regret a thing. I don’t fear a thing.”
Sherlock couldn’t resist. He carefully slid his left hand behind John’s nape and onto his scalp, massaging gently, imitating the way John occasionally scratched his head. Sherlock had done this before, in John’s unknowing sleep. But this time was more intimate, having confirmed verbal proof that he was permeating John’s subconscious.
“Sherlock, I…”
“Can I tell you all a secret?” Rosie asked when she found the right dip in the conversation. Stella’s thumb paused over the back of her hand. Stella could be annoyingly honest, and she hated secret-keeping. Rosie hadn’t yet told her about the stunt she pulled inviting Sherlock to the wedding because she was nervous about how Stella was going to react. But, she figured, it was better to rip the bandage off now before Stella spotted Sherlock Holmes during their vows and gave her a questioning glare at the altar.
Sherlock continued, “Last night, Stella drank arsenic-infused wine. The caterer gave you a special couples bottle.”
John quietly followed him to the room number on Sherlock’s key. He kept his distance, as if he knew that walking too close to Sherlock might burst an invisible barrier keeping him from blowing up.
from Rosie: “Dad, I love you so much, and it’s easy to see how much you love him. Welcome to the family, Sherlock. Thank god I invited you, because meeting the man who holds my father’s heart has been one of the greater pleasures of my life.”
John leaned his head back, groaning. He slipped his hand underneath Sherlock’s jumper to touch the smooth skin on his navel. This proved to be effective, because Sherlock’s whispers were turning into soft pants. John hung on every sound.
When it comes time for eulogies, Clara’s is gutting. She tells a story about a time in university when Harry dragged her to a funeral for a stranger just to get some good food, then got on the microphone at the reception to tell a completely made-up story about the deceased. “She had everyone in that room hysterically laughing, then tearing up. She always knew how to work a room, find an angle. She made it so easy to fall in love with her,” she stops and composes herself. “It was certainly easy for me.”
Sherlock pulled away, and John blinked like an idiot.
Always staying low
John. He needed to call John. It was a Wednesday, so John was at the surgery, probably dealing with an influx of flu patients. Text? No, it was 12:30- he’d be on his lunch. He could call. It was urgent enough to call. But…
Mrs. Hudson took another bite of pudding from Sherlock’s outstretched spoon. “You didn’t dread it,” he said.
“You’re bluffing.”
Sherlock only slammed the cupboard door in response.
“Do me a favor and get the high chair set up for Rosie. I’ve got to give her some breakfast or she’s going to throw a fit.”
John considered. “Maybe I’d slip it in Sherlock’s coffee. Could be fun.”
“Oh, um. Hello”
She’d teetered on the edges of this for ages. Dad had always been unnecessarily elusive when it came to the topic of her mother, but she always assumed he was too emotionally stifled to talk about her.
John had him backed into the kitchen countertop, knee pressing between Sherlock’s own, and just the sensation of being so surrounded by him was intoxicatingly disarming. “Didn’t say anything,” John said, chuckling into Sherlock’s neck.

Xiaowen’s smile grew. “Yes?”
John ran a frustrated hand through golden grey hair. “No, just. Let me explain, okay?” He leaned on the sink and looked extremely uncomfortable. “Could we, maybe, go back into the room?”
through friends. Hinge). She had seen John from across the pub and urged Daniel that they go somewhere else, blaming the weak drinks. John, apparently, hadn’t caught sight of her. Seeing John Watson in a London bar had not shocked her; Molly knew John liked a drink. Rather, it was who he was sitting with that had caused her to stare.

John relaxes and rolls his eyes. “Sorry, Clara, this is my, uh, friend-”
“So? Did Holmes RSVP?” Elaine tried to diffuse the tension. She had a knack for reading a room (“It’s a natural talent, Rosie. I’m a libra,” Elaine had told her once, when Rosie, who was always in her head about social interactions, had asked her how she did it. The response hadn’t been particularly helpful).
The Woman. “Really?” After all of John’s ridiculous implications about the two of them.

said it was good, at the time.
“Excuse me?” Sherlock shook his head, trying to process that sentence. “Why would you...”
It did. It had. Irrevocably.
. It gave her an idea for a song.
Dad’s fury had seemingly transformed into genuine interest. “Then, how did Diana die?”
Rosie shot him a pointed look.
John gripped the steering wheel just a touch tighter. He was driving Rosie to her third grade orchestra concert, and she was gripping her violin case to her chest in the backseat. He silently thanked himself for choosing the rental. Rosie seemed to love the instrument so much, he had been close to purchasing one.
and he wants it quickly. “Want to touch you,” he whispers.

John’s coffee poured, he walks in and sinks next to Sherlock on the couch. After four days of Sherlock sleeping there, it smells like him: tobacco, tea, and lavender shampoo. The familiarity of the scent soothes his throbbing headache. Well, that and the paracetamol Sherlock hands him wordlessly.
That glorious bastard.
Sherlock left a secured Jacqueline with Lestrade and made his way to the microphone. He gave Emil a threatening glare, and the poor sod stepped aside, handing it over. Dad was covering half his face with his hands, as if that could help him unsee what was unspooling in front of them. Stella’s mother was looking around at the rest of them like they were lunatics for letting this madman take over the mic and the ceremony. They might’ve been.
She gushed. “I just wanted to say thank you again for your help yesterday. You were very brave.”
going to let my therapist help me.”
“Jesus,” John muttered between sips.
, I want that, yes-“
“He needs me to take a case in Asia. Taiwan.”
“I’m glad you are amenable,” Sherlock said after what felt like several long minutes of nothing but the sound of the fire crackling, Earl’s snoring, and Sherlock’s fingers rustling through John’s grey hair. John’s chuckle came from deep in his throat, and suddenly, he was bursting with high-pitched laughter. Sherlock’s rumbling laugh was not far behind.
Touchy subject, then.
“Not much. I only know he was a diplomat, kind of like my mum,” she said. “We don’t talk about our family histories much.”
“I’m investigating a murder,” Sherlock said, that familiar condescension grating on John’s patience.
. They looked like the shallow waters of the Manx coastline, the light in the room reflecting off of them like stones rubbed raw from choppy waters. There was a softness there, but more chillingly, there was a sense of distance, of being removed from it all, an object operating on its own timeline totally unaffected by the cosmic shift in John’s. He smiled a terrible, put-upon smile John had only ever seen used on clients.
John shuddered. “You. I said I didn’t want you. And that I didn’t...love you.” Sherlock kissed him, trying to tell him in every nonverbal way that John had nothing to fear. He could say it. He should say it.
“None that made us targets of an arsenic poisoning. What do you know about her family?” Sherlock asked, gesturing for Rosie to sit on the toilet seat as if it were his own home. She did, the porcelain icy against her bare legs.
Rosie gripped Stella’s hip: firm, all sharp angles. Not dreaming.
“A gift?” With all the trouble Rosie had gone to
With John spurting between them, tightening around his own cock, his own release was not far behind. A few more thrusts, and Sherlock was there, calling John’s name.
An invitation to Watson’s wedding. He didn’t know whether to feel enraged or euphoric.
45. A screwdriver has many, on Doctor Who
The more optimistic, mind palace John announced himself, climbing out of the tower Sherlock kept him in. “But Sherlock,” he said, “The letter wasn’t nonchalant. ‘It would mean everything to me.’” The illusion of John wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. “I’ve been thinking about you.”
For a moment, it looked like Xiaowen was going to punch him. But after a moment, her expression turned into a devilish grin. “You slept with him.”
“‘They’?”
Well. Edward was here for an entirely valid, sincere reason.
“Hello, Watson. Stella,” Sherlock greeted with a hint of a smirk, probably seeing her deduce in real time exactly what he'd just been up to. “Welcome home.”

It was over too fast. Sherlock came with John’s encouragements panted into his ear:
Sherlock extended a hand.
Before he had the chance to ask Sherlock what the theory was, his mobile rang. It was late, long past midnight now, and seeing Rosie’s name light up on the screen was far from comforting. She was supposed to be out partying, causing a public disturbance and the like, not calling her old dad.
He was nearly salivating to get into John’s bedroom.
Go ______, or like Jim in Sherlock’s data
“King of K-pop,” familiarly
but after a considerate bite of minced lamb, a tour actually sounded pleasant. With Watson as his tour guide giving him the tools to create a sensory map of the Isle of Man, he could piece together a more accurate portrayal of John’s life in the last twenty years. Data collection.
“Sherlo- oh, god, your mouth,” John panted. “Obscene.”
John feels caught. He nods.
Stella looked awkward, and Rosie couldn’t stand for that. “No, it’s okay. I’m just happy she came.” Stella’s mum was from Beijing, and had moved to London when she married an English diplomat- Stella’s dad. He’d died when she was two. So had Rosie’s mother. They understood each other, in that way.
John did the same, and proceeded to inhale the remaining pieces of chicken.
Sherlock speaks softly, but deliberately. His face is calm, and it tells John nothing. “In a minute, you’re going to go in there, get Watson and the pram, and come back out. Then, we’re going to walk back to Baker Street and sort this out.”
He was not giving her anything to work with! “What about you? Are you dating?” John stiffened. “Not that I’m interested! I mean, I’m interested, but not like, well, you know.”
Dad only sputtered disbelievingly in response as Sherlock took the microphone back from Mrs. Liu. Emil threw his hands up on the side, completely helpless watching the exchange.
Sherlock returned to 221B smelling of rot. This stakeout was the third and only successful one in the case, and it involved waiting for the murderer to collect his weapon stashed in a very hot and very full dumpster. They nabbed him in the end, after a laughably short pursuit, considering the full week of planning and ineffectual stakeouts leading up to that moment. It was likely to be Sherlock’s last case with Lestrade, as the D.I. was set to retire the following week, so he had stayed around for the arrest and even for the tedious paperwork-filling.

John smiled, his mouth widening across his face like a cresting wave over sand. “Tell me again.”

“Thank you, John,” Sherlock said, sincerely. “It might help to think of it as simply a more potent truth serum than scotch, without the other debilitating effects.”
“But--” John protested, but Sherlock cut him off.
Obscene? Was that... “Good?” Sherlock asked with a pop.
“John, that’s hardly--”
“Glad you think so.” God, he loved this blushing man with every fiber of his being. John pulled him down by the nape of his neck for a slow, morning snog. Sherlock came willingly, pulling John’s lips between his own with unexpected immediate enthusiasm.
“So you agree he’s dazzling,” she smiled. Dad did not find it particularly funny, coughing on his own surprise. “But that’s why we love him. He’s
“And here you are,” Sherlock chuckled, that deep, throaty chuckle that made John ache for him. “You have far too many clothes on, John.”

Sherlock to this whole affair, John was already deeply indebted to his daughter. She needn’t have gone to the effort of a gift; she’d already given him everything he never knew he wanted.
“A terrorist’s daughter, that’s who!” Jacqueline snarled, trying and failing to break free of Lestrade’s firm grip.
John chuckles. “She was.” He locks eyes with Sherlock over Clara’s head. “She really was.”
Jacqueline clutched a hand to her chest. “Mr. Holmes, Diana couldn’t have been murdered. That kind of thing just doesn’t happen here,” she said, her voice wobbly. John could tell Sherlock was fighting the urge to spit a biting remark at that comment, and he fought to hide his smile. Sherlock wouldn’t have held back, twenty years ago. “And she was the loveliest woman,” Jacqueline whimpered, and burst into tears.
Xiaowen grabbed a pair of scissors from a mug on the desk and kneeled behind John. With John’s chair behind Sherlock’s view of the desk, he couldn’t see what Xiaowen was doing, but he knew she was trying to cut through the thick rope with the scrapbook-level blade.
Stella was more like Dad, in the way that they both kept their hearts hidden, guarded. Though Stella had been the one to approach her, she’d been a sort of player, back then. Stella used her good looks and natural mysteriousness to pull, but had never stayed in any entanglement long. She was an emotionally guarded lockbox with a charming smile and a fancy coat, too scared to bear her heart. Rosie felt lucky every day that she had been the one to manage coaxing it out of her.

Rosie smiled, looking away. “No, just sending a letter.”

John’s tears were steadily flowing, now. “Sherlock. I love you that much, too.”
“John, I’m sorry, I-” he didn’t have the vocabulary, the schema for this conversation. “I don’t know how-”
“Ready?” Sherlock bounds down the stairs, cutting him off, and John can’t help but stare at the sharp, clean man in front of him. It may just be the contrast of the last few days of disheveled lying about in his dressing gown, but Sherlock looks...spectacular. He’s wearing some expensive, well-tailored black suit, looking like he just stepped off the cover of some snobbish magazine. He hardly has the right to look this good at his sister’s

John gasped at the sight of him. Gone was the frazzled, chaotic, high-strung energy of the high Sherlock he had known five years ago. He looked
It took Sherlock and Xiaowen twenty minutes to find the office in the maze of the Palace Museum. On the way, Sherlock nicked two ID cards from attendants for each of them. Sherlock’s was a Taiwanese man’s, but he didn’t suspect anyone would look too closely. They had to slip behind a staff member before a carded door closed, their IDs not having the access, but once they made it into the personnel area, the process of breaking into Iris Lyu’s office was exceptionally easy. Sherlock picked the lock and the automatic fluorescent lights switched on to reveal a small room made to look even smaller by filing cabinets filled to the brim, and various posters laid haphazardly over the desk and cabinets. There was a door that undoubtedly led to a cramped broom closet.
She stiffened slightly. “Yeah, um, he kept a journal with all the blog posts in it from when you two were- lived- together.” John kept copies of the blog? “He adored you.”
Admitting to being caught in a lie was, apparently, above Sherlock’s capabilities. John sighed. He leaned back in his chair, chewing on a piece of crispy bacon and studying the puzzling man across from him. He had Sherlock here, didn’t he? That was enough. He didn’t need to push. He’d promised himself that he was going to revel in this, today. He needed to let go of logistics.
Today’s puzzle was called “Bylines.” From what he had answered already, he gleaned that a few of the longer across answers could be expressions like “CAUGHTBYSURPRISE” or “LEARNBYDOING”. John cleared his throat and focused on the clue.
“How long will he be out for?” John asked, tilting his head in Sherlock’s direction.
“Wait! Everyone, wait.”
“Redbeard...your dog.”
“Fine. I expect a response about Dr. Watson’s attendance by tonight.” Only Mycroft could make MI6 work sound like a state dinner. “Either way, you’re leaving tomorrow afternoon, 3pm out of Heathrow. Good day.”
John pulled away from the spot where his mouth was working on Sherlock’s neck, his nose coming up to graze Sherlock’s. “You see?” he mouthed against his lips.
He launched into the details of the Paris case, in which a baker had been poisoning his customers in microdoses through butter. The more layers of pastry, the more deadly the dessert. Quite basic, really. The French police force was unthinkably even less competent than London’s.
Sherlock brought his lips to John’s, and he gasped. The truth tea made John more receptive and less inhibited, so there was a special quality to John’s enthusiasm that he hadn’t yet experienced. The kiss instantly deepened, and Sherlock climbed onto John’s lap in his red chair, grinding into him.
That was Dad for you: stubbornly closed off for far too long, but once he decided on something, he put his all into it. It was his best and worst quality.
55. Start of a children’s rhyme for making a choice
As if reading his thoughts, Sherlock lies back, stretching across the sofa and plopping his feet in John’s lap. His eyes never leave the screen. Attenborough’s rattling on about symbiotic relationships. John’s steady, practiced fingers get to work massaging Sherlock’s arches. He groans.
“Fuck, Sherlock,” John panted.

Really, really, really, really
Stella’s eyes widened, and she nervously brushed the fringe of her cropped, jet black hair back, making it look distractingly tousled.
Xiaowen shook her head. “She wouldn’t,” she whispered, more to herself than for John or Sherlock. “Not Amy.”
“Excellent.” Sherlock spoke with confidence, but his flushed cheeks betrayed him.
“What’s wrong, love?” John asked, his voice so gentle and soft, Sherlock let out a whimper.
So, the morning after her ninth birthday party, she marched down to Daddy’s office and demanded an explanation.
John went slack beneath him, his hips sinking into the mattress. Sherlock pulled off, wiping the excess mix of sweat and semen around his mouth. He was incredibly hard himself, but he felt sated, staring at John in this limp state. He fell into the space next to John, perfectly shaped for him, and John threw his arm over Sherlock’s stomach.
“Yes. It’s canceled,” she said, sealing it with another kiss on Stella’s cheek.
“Yeah. Typical ridiculous requests,” she answered, rolling her eyes. “Do you ever talk to him?” There. Now they both had asked questions they already knew the answers to.
With John’s come glistening on his black shirt and covering his right hand, John’s lips moving tenderly and openly against his own, Sherlock’s mind caught up to his body. It told him, based on previously collected data, that John Watson was going to leave. The probability that he would return to life with his daughter, leaving Sherlock to marinate in grief amplified by John’s brief reintroduction and disappearance, was uncomfortably high.
Sherlock thought about the sea air, the grassy knolls, the quiet charm of Isle of Man. The idea of a life here wasn’t completely abhorrent. But London was his home. London was
John shifted so that his hand rested on Sherlock’s chest, his left leg thrown over Sherlock’s thighs, and his head on the same pillow.
Rosie’s cry for help was a small blip over the blasting music as Stella slipped down her arms onto the floor, unconscious.
“Morning,” he greeted, as if they hadn’t run into each other in the hotel lobby just a few short hours ago.
“John, she’s perfect.” The image of Sherlock crouching so deeply he was nearly sitting, fawning over his dog pulled at his chest. Was this what his life could have been? “You, on the other hand, could use a bit of grooming,” Sherlock noted, his eyes scanning up and down John’s body in his familiar way.
John can’t help himself, he leans in, placing his hands on either side of Sherlock’s face, and kisses him. “You’re gorgeous. I just- I didn’t ever think we would get here. It means a lot.” He looks away, getting emotional. Sherlock tenses.
Sherlock had considered picking up random strangers for sexual research, observation, and experimentation exactly four times, but he never followed through. It was a socially precarious practice. There was no reason to be unnecessarily vulnerable when he understood the act itself and the emotional and physical responses it elicited. He
28. Major Yorkshire river that runs through Leeds and Skipton
“It’s an awfully good one this week, mate,” said the shop’s proprietor. John half-smiled, liking to figure that kind of thing out for himself, thanks. As he turned to walk toward the nearest tube station, eager to get home and settle in with a cup of tea and his puzzle, he stopped dead at the sight of a very familiar woman in a striped jumper talking animatedly into her mobile not ten yards away.
“No, well. We left you with Mrs. Hudson,” he said, too casually. “Our landlady.” The reductive label tasted sour in his mouth. “But she was more like your grandmother, in practice.”
“Sherlock Holmes? Dr. Watson?” a woman’s voice with a vague American accent came from behind them. It was Xiaowen.
John furrowed his brow, not wanting to get near the stuff again. “The tea?”
Sherlock addressed the audience again. “Excuse the interruption. Can’t have a murderer at a wedding, can we?” he winked, actually
He looked away, unable to confront the overwhelming mix of emotions shouting from John’s features. “Of course. She’s a genius.”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. John could see his brain working, fusing wires of information together like an unmatched welder. It was mesmerizing.
Afterwards they laid breathless, lightly touching each other along chests, arms, hips, thighs as if to assure themselves that the other was real. John kissed him, pouring what seemed like all that was left of him into it.
She hopped out of the car to give them each a hug, and Stella a kiss.
Sherlock was drowning in sensation. That sound John just made was a thousand symphonies, the caress of John’s hand undoing the last button on his shirt and urging the garment off of him better than the feeling of a newly stringed violin bow across Stradivarius strings.
Sherlock slumped a little, reaching his arms out onto the countertop behind him to support himself. “I’m sorry, John.” John stepped forward to wrap his fingers around Sherlock’s jumper at the waist. “I- I let my emotions get the better of me. You being here has greatly escalated my emotional response.” He closed his eyes, wrapped his arms around John’s shoulders, and laid his head on top of John’s, breathing in the smell of his own shampoo. “Because of course, I love you, too.”
“You’re not leaving,” he commanded, and the guard shrunk. “Xiaowen, secure him with the rope, please.”
Sherlock looked him directly in the eye, wanting badly to give this to him, but knowing this was not the time. “Yes. I promise I will give you the full version, on my turn with the truth tea. But tonight I ask you the questions.”
The moment their fingers touched, however, the energy charged. It was as if he held a fragile piece of himself exposed that would cause his entire system to crash if he let go. John leaned in. He seemed to feel it, too.
not like in our day,” John laughed.
It’s likely Sherlock had already deduced the entirety of his sexual history of the last twenty years, however limited. John was clean, as of nearly two years ago after a tepid one night stand with a stranger at a medical conference. “Clean, yeah.”
The conversation was derailing. “Xiaowen, what did my brother want?” he asked, perhaps a bit too testily.
Sherlock’s hand paused over his shaft, but he kept his thumb circling the head teasingly. He really
She reached her arms out, and Sherlock reluctantly stepped into them, keeping his arms still at his sides. As he did so, she went up on her tiptoes to whisper in Chinese:
“Fuck off, Harry!” he called back. Some of Rosie’s friends looked rather horrified at the exchange, and that only sent him further into the giggling fit. He was gasping for air when Sherlock’s lips found his again, still vibrating from laughter. The kiss tasted of Sherlock’s laugh, low and rumbling, and John decided he’d never been happier.
Sherlock didn’t want to answer, either. John got so worked up over these things. God forbid Sherlock actually brought up John’s bisexuality- there’d be radio silence for a week. And he needed John to be willing to come to Taiwan for this case. By tomorrow.

“Come on, then! Let’s solve a case, John and Sherlock Holmes,” she invited, gesturing to her dark green Honda Civic 2008.
“Lestrade, take her away,” Sherlock ordered, sounding as disgusted as Rosie felt. She had no idea where Lestrade would be taking her, considering he didn’t actually have any authority on the Isle of Man, but she assumed Sherlock had worked that out.
“I like it when you give me a striptease,” John mumbles against the side of Sherlock’s mouth.
A sound came out of John that could have been a squeal, or a yelp, or a loud chuckle, and it quickly devolved into giggling. Sherlock smiled, a genuine, eye-lit smile, and joined in.
, of course. Sherlock’s staring off at the window guiltily.

John chuckled, low and breathy. He licked at Sherlock’s earlobe. “God, where to start?”
“Yeah? Do you know how I could fix that?” Sherlock gave him a look that said
his clothes off as soon as possible. And then he was going to rip off Sherlock’s.
Xiaowen crossed her arms. “I’ve got plans to break up with my girlfriend.”
John chuckled, a high, nervous thing. Sherlock had no clue how often John had stayed awake through long nights, imagining exactly all the places Sherlock could put that mouth. “A few, yeah.”
Sherlock. I still can’t believe it.” John’s breath floated over Sherlock’s cheek like a summer evening breeze.
“God, wow. Molly?”
There had been the harsh, isolating loneliness of Afghanistan, and the crippling loss of the battlefield when he had returned.

“That’s settled, then,” he said, and John swallowed. He was going to be inside Sherlock, no barriers. Every one of his nerve endings sang with want, and he had to stop himself from reaching down to take himself in hand. Sherlock’s eyes flickered down to John’s maddeningly hard cock and back up, clearing his throat in the way he did when he knew John was not going to like the next words out of his mouth. “I know where to find lubricant in this house, but you’re not going to be happy about it.”
John stood, wiping ash from his trousers. Those would need a good dry cleaning later, but for now, Sherlock was mesmerised by the juxtaposition of dirt on John’s one piece of expensive clothing. “Indecency,” he answered.
Sherlock stretches his lanky limbs across the sofa, laying his head in John’s lap. John lazily runs his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “Thank God, because I need to get some sleep without worrying you’re going to drink yourself into oblivion. Do you mind?” He pulls the throw blanket off the back of the couch and covers himself with it, settling in.
It’s half-five by the time John stumbles into Baker Street, soaking from the London rain, lugging a large box of his and Rosie’s stuff at his side. Rosie’s also wet, and crying. Once he sets the box down unceremoniously, he tries cooing and rocking to quiet her, but no luck. Sherlock bounds down the stairs, fully dressed in grey trousers and a light blue top. It’s a relief not to see him in black.
Clara waves a hand dismissively. “You don’t owe me anything, John. All I did was greet some old faces.”
John stiffened. Molly Hooper looked different somehow; better, even. Even from five meters away, John could sense an air of confidence exuding from her that hadn’t quite been there when he’d known her well. If he’d just met her at a pub, he may have tried to buy her a drink.
Stella ran her fingers over the edges, worn with age and disuse.
Reading John’s post-TD-12 blog had been fascinating, but horribly troubling. John’s brain had been more resilient than the doctors had expected (John Watson had always been a severely underestimated man), and had clung to many elements of the truth, obscuring it rather than completely erasing it.
They’d kissed all afternoon into the evening, but they were public kisses, sweet and loving and promises of more. But with this needy snogging, each wet, desperate slide of tongues said
“Don’t need the cards. I’m quite good at predictions as it is.”
Xiaowen pulled away, and John perked up. “It is, isn’t it? Sherlock, we should celebrate,” he said, smiling gently over Xiaowen’s shoulder. It was hateful.
He had been there, in John’s hospital room after the shooting. He had seen the bag filled with the eerily luminescent viscous liquid hanging next to his bed, had witnessed the nurse start the IV, and had done nothing to stop it.
John frowned. What was Sherlock playing at? Using his homeless network to get to him? Did he even
“Fuck me.”
John smiled. “Arse.”
“You’re getting married tomorrow. You need to sleep,” he said, needing to cut this line of conversation immediately before he said something he would regret. He sounded dreadfully like his mother.
Sherlock pulled back the foreskin, wrapped his mouth around the head of John’s cock and sucked. Every one of his nerve endings was singing with the sensation, and John lost his train of thought completely.
Sherlock looked expectantly at Jacqueline. “Well? Who was this person, Ms. Mann?”
“Mm,” John sped up, and Sherlock began thrusting in earnest into his palm.
“What?” Sherlock panted, thrusting up into John’s palm. John answered with a questioning glance. “You, looking at me-
Sherlock looked away. “No, it’s...fine.” It clearly wasn’t. “I should be going.”
“Good morning, Dr. Watson!” The hotel event manager’s impossibly cheery greeting pulled him from his thoughts.
, this feels so nice,” John breathes against Sherlock’s neck.
Surprisingly, the woman smiled at this. “There’s the Sherlock Holmes I know. It was nice to finally meet you.” She reached out to shake his hand, and Sherlock shockingly found himself reaching for it. “Iris Lyu,” she introduced. “Have a nice trip to Taiwan.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “Make a deduction.”
Sherlock had watched Harry carefully all evening as a form of ethnographic observation. Aside from the tempting man presently rubbing his thumbs in circles on Sherlock’s stomach, pressing just hard enough to feel like a claim, Harry was the most interesting attendee. There was an entire treasure trove of unmined data about John stored in her strong gait, her tired eyes, her too-loud voice, her memories.
It was all he could do not to immediately shove his face in John’s crotch and lick and suck to oblivion. No, John Watson was lying fully naked and vulnerable below him, and he needed to take his time.
At first, she assumed that they were just good friends getting drinks. Upon closer inspection, however, John had his arm wrapped around the waist of the other, younger man, who sported curly dark brown hair and a thin frame. For a moment, Molly was transported to an alternate universe of what-could-have-been, where the man coyly whispering in John’s ear was Sherlock. She thought, perhaps, John felt it, too. Maybe that’s the entire reason he was there. In her own way, Molly completely understood.
23. Pimple, informally
in cutting someone out. Hate was simply love gone through a chemical change. The nonchalance in extending an invite for a casual visit was insulting.
If he was going to get through the weekend, he needed as little mention of Sherlock Holmes as possible.
All John wanted to do was pull him into his arms.
Sherlock began undoing John’s getup, pulling him closer by his tie. “I also have regrets about that day.”
They kissed again, the knowledge of a hundred fantasies fueling the heat between them. “Where did you shag me, in your fantasies?”
He leapt off the bed- he couldn’t take it anymore. He ripped a piece of dental floss and tied it around the lip of the faucet, so the water would cling to it, slipping down to the drain silently.
“I dunno,” he said instead, sliding his foot along Sherlock’s instep.
He’d seen John naked before, but his body had never been so offered, so tantalizingly available to him. Sherlock started by inhaling the heady scent of the tuft of hair between John’s strong thighs.
Hope you’re alright, dear. I’ll stop at the shops on the way home.
“What if…” John started, but he looked away before he could finish.
Dad had told her once, and suddenly, years of tension around Sherlock Holmes clicked into place.
Once they were settled in the car, Xiaowen driving, Sherlock in the passenger seat, and John disgruntled in the back, Xiaowen told them that she was taking them to her family home for lunch.
He stuck the fingers of his right hand into the waist of John’s trousers and pulled him closer, undoing the zip one-handedly (an impressive feat, considering his current state), and reaching around John’s length. John obliged Sherlock’s body, so intimately in tune with its nonverbal requests for
bloody frightening.”
Everyone was riding the high of combined shock value and romanticism, and the live band performed like they were at a sold out venue for thousands. In the great hall of the Crown Hotel, sparkling with fairy lights and decorated with sprawling bouquets, Rosie performed her song she had intended to sing at the original reception, for Stella. But as the words flowed out of her, she realized they were oddly fitting in this case, too.
He kept quiet, expressing his pleasure only in huffed breaths through teeth. When he came, it was in gentle spurts. A soft warmth coursed through his body. He felt relaxed for the first time since Mycroft had asked him to take this case.
?” He was close enough to Sherlock with the microphone for this news to be shared with the audience, and everyone was looking around, their eyes asking whether or not they should leave.
Rosie followed suit, searching Stella for any revealing details, but found none. Her fiancée looked as confused as she was. But there was a small voice in her head questioning whether their entire relationship had been a ruse. Questioning whether Stella had been sent by some secret evil corporation to ruin her life. “Stella, what does he mean, your ‘identity’?” A flash of hurt crossed Stella’s features at the accusatory nature of it.
Sherlock wanted to yell and cry and sulk about this, but his most immediate, overpowering reaction was to try and fix this perspective. This skewed, false perspective Sherlock had tried so hard to force on the world, only for John to internalize it.
“I now pronounce you married.”
She conceded. “True. It’s just…it’s a shock. I’m going to end things in a minute, but that doesn’t mean my feelings for her have disappeared.”
Sherlock you’re so beautiful your hands are perfect I’ve dreamt about your fingers around me like this,” John gasped, a string of compliments that went straight to Sherlock’s groin and bloomed in his chest.
John pushes Sherlock off of him and wordlessly walks into the church and down to the second row, where Mrs. Hudson is sitting with Rosie and the pram. John tries not to make a fuss with Rosie as he straps her in, unsuccessfully. After his outburst just minutes earlier, the funeral attendees seem to find John a more interesting spectacle than the pastor. When Rosie starts chanting “Bwack bwack bwack”, she gives them all the more excuse to stare. Mrs. Hudson shoots them all dirty looks. Clara even mouths across the aisle to him, “You okay?”
John could feel something coming to the surface that he hoped would sound like a chuckle. Instead, a strange ball of noise that sounded like a deranged laugh and a sob and an agreement released itself before he could stop it. He turned away, embarrassed and wanting to run away from the entire situation.
She smiled at him. “I’ll see you tomorrow morning. I’ll pick you up.” Her casual charm was back on, but there was a sadness in her voice Sherlock could not miss.
Rosie shook her head in disbelief. None of this was making sense. Sherlock had thought Stella a
He had suspected as much, had deduced John’s depressive tendencies the day they met.
Sherlock had strict rules about when, where, and why John was permitted to roam his mind, but in his current state, he was wont to ignore them. He really should toss the envelope immediately. Rip it in two. He really, really--
” Sherlock’s cheeks were aflame.
John realizes he knew startlingly little about Harry’s personal life. She was gregarious, and wild, and constantly bugging John about his own affairs, but John knew she used that as a shield. She never opened up to him, and John still doesn’t know how or why her and Clara split up.
Sherlock leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees, intrigued. “What
After dropping Rosie with Harry and Clara, John had been silent most of the way to the airport. Usually, this would have put his focus on the case, and he would be asking questions about the basics, prodding Sherlock for theories. But not today. Today he ruminated. Questioned his decision to come on this case. Sherlock spent the ride pretending to study the detailing on the sleek leather seats in the car Mycroft had sent for them, trying to avoid provoking John at all costs before they boarded the plane.

She nodded.
Clara’s voice trembles. “She’s an idiot, full stop.”
“You enjoy talking about sex, during sex,” Sherlock deduces, quite correctly. “‘Dirty talk’,” he finger-quotes.
“Joooohn,” he called, falling onto the couch in a total surrender by his limbs. Shit, what time was it? Nighttime, he was sure. He probably shouldn’t be yelling.
John was still lost, and Sherlock breathed a frustrated exhale, a test of John’s nerve endings’ tickle resistance.
He sighed, checking his watch. 08:05. He still had the whole day ahead of him, and half a puzzle. Six letters for
I’d like to make a revised vow. John, Stella, and Watson: I promise that I’ll always be there. For all three of you.”
Sherlock joined him on the bed, cracking open the lid and making a move to spread the stuff onto his fingers, but John stopped him. He wanted to do this for Sherlock, make it good for him. “Let me.”
Lo-___
Sherlock’s all awkward, long limbs, and it takes a minute for him to settle into a straddling position on John’s lap.
“Molly Hooper,” he replied with a small hint of smile.

“Erm, excuse me?” John replied defensively. He flexed his fingers again.
“Oh, I think he knew
“Age is funny that way,” she’d told Sherlock just weeks ago, “People spend their entire lives dreading it- getting older. All those treatments and creams and silly things. No one wants to say it, but age is just the polite term for getting closer to death.” Her voice was shaky and slow, but her mind was as quick as ever.
John continued, “If she- Amy- knew about the tea leaves, she might try to use them against him. Catch him in the act, so to say.”
She laughed, her eyes crinkling. “After our day yesterday, I’m sure you’re ready to get the hell out of here.”
, and written below.
Sherlock smiled against his knuckles. “That’s Mr. Watson-Holmes to you.”
“You meant everything you said.” Sherlock’s tone is impossible to read.
from Greg: “What she said.”
Xiaowen glanced between them and (thankfully) didn’t comment.
“George doesn’t matter, Sherlock; he won’t be bothered in the slightest when I tell him I won’t see him anymore. What I have with you- it’s different,” John pleaded, only hoping Sherlock would understand.
John turned to her. “I used to think my wife would never hurt anyone, and it turns out she was a professional assassin. Love makes you see what you want to see.” Sherlock shot a meaningful glance to John. That must have been difficult for him to admit.
His attempt at humor fell flat. “No, I mean,
John laughs. “God, me too. Don’t know what got into me.”
Elaine’s big t-shirt rode up to Rosie’s waist as she slipped to the bathroom floor. She ached for Stella. She ached to know the truth. And for the first time in years, she ached to know who Mum really was.
“Obviously, yeah,” John said knowingly. He ran a hand through his own hair, smoothing it. “We’ll be landing in just under two hours. Breakfast will be ‘round soon.”
on a flight this morning?”
But Rosie was convinced that his heart was on display because Sherlock had reached inside of him and pulled it out.
“Ooh, you’re a bad man,” John grumbled, emphasizing it with a gentle tug on Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock stood, trying to regain his composure, but his hair was a glorious mess, his jeans rumpled, and there was a naughty glint in his eye.
John cocked his head. “That’s not the Sherlock Holmes I know.”
You ok, mate? Saw the video on Twitter. About time, really. Bloody awful circumstances, though. Sorry to hear about your sister.
John Watson was no hairdresser, but he could learn to love pink, too.
“No, but I can smell the croissants.” He hands the dressing gown to John, who stands and wraps it around himself. “And they’re not the ones from the bakery by her flat, or one on the way here. Conclusion: she slept somewhere else.” Sherlock pulls the dressing gown he wore last night from the hook on the door, letting it hang, untied, giving John an unobstructed view of his fancy underwear and the bulge beneath. John licks his lips, reminded of those thirty-six ways Sherlock wants him.
, he brought his lips to John’s.
“It’s Taiwanese for hello,” Xiaowen clarified. “This is my father. He doesn’t speak English, but I can assure you he’s happy you’re here.”
John looks up at Sherlock with the most sincere expression he can muster. “I meant it, you know. What I said, about Harry being right. I love you.” The words feel so
John melts at the word
Rosie’s eyes widened. Daddy’s life
“Wait!” John called, and Sherlock hated how easily his feet slowed. “Can I at least patch up the cut on your head? Check your vitals?” he fussed, and Sherlock couldn’t stand it. He loathed John’s concern.
Sherlock chuckles softly, "I think I speak for both of us when I say London is my home."
"Practice makes perfect, John, as you can see." Sherlock retorts, suddenly feeling defensive. Why should he have to justify his methods of destroying himself? Why can't John just stitch him up when needed and say no more about it?
"Jesus, John, you're a doctor, try and see if he's oka--"
Sherlock nods, unsure of himself. No one had even come close to caring to him like John did, and the lack of experience in the department left Sherlock more confused than he felt he had any right to be.
John scoffs, "You didn't know what? That your death would kill me too? That I didn't want to live, let alone take care of myself and keep myself well? You were too busy playing the hero and saving the world to realize what this did to me."
"So today, I thought you might like something simple, like a Caesar salad." John begins.
he's not here?" John asked pleadingly to Mycroft.
her, it would just be
"I'm trying, John. Let me be." Sherlock says quietly.
, he thinks bitterly.
John laughs softly. "It's because I love you, idiot. I always have."
"I know," he says quietly, staring straight ahead. "I just wished I could have kept this to myself."
So here he is. Eating a whole ass meal. Recovering.
Sherlock feels briefly irritated at the simplicity of the case, but he figures it's better than nothing.
"This would be a preferable alternative to wrist checking," Sherlock says, covering John's hand with his own spindly piano hands, in turn feeling John's scars on his stomach, a wistful look on his face.
"I'm not a hopeless romantic," Sherlock snapped. "I just like the song."
"God, Sherlock, I wish you had come to me sooner." John says wistfully, gently tugging on the needle, pulling his flesh back together.
"My cheekbones? God, you're insufferable." Sherlock says, his cheeks tinting the slightest bit pink.
"I just want you to know how much I love you." John says wistfully.
Again, he had never killed anything, and he didn't plan on it. But he knew, at least on some level, that he and the teenager had seen and felt similar things.
"John." Sherlock says, raising his head and looking he other man in the eye. John's gaze dropped as he pushed Sherlock's hand away from his stomach.
"Oh. Well, aren't you supposed to be eating more now?"Lestrade asks quizzically.
Sherlock supposed he knew what Nirvana meant by "I miss the comfort of being sad". He had been so sad for so long, he had forgotten what it felt like to not be sad, to not want to tear his skin open and and shoot up with drugs. When he wasn't sad, he was...empty.
"Aren't
"Well...I don't know, it sounds silly, but...how could you love me? I haven't the faintest why someone such as yourself would fancy someone like me."
That one word was like a load of bricks dropping off his chest, and his previously fear-heavy limbs were filled with an anticipatory tingling numbness. This wasn't going to be easy, but he has to do it.
The interview with the boy proved to be rather disappointing; all Sherlock could glean was what he had already been told: cat goes missing, and then the cat returns. They had given the cat a bath since it had returned, so Sherlock wasn't able to deduce much from just looking at the cat. It had behaved oddly, shrinking away from people in fear, as well as staring intently into space before freaking out and running to safety. Sherlock wasn't as cat behaviorist, and Cluedo never had fits like that, so he didn't quite know what the significance of it is. The cat had been covered in mud and debris, he had been told, but that could be easily chalked up to having gone missing for 2 weeks.
"What do you want?" Sherlock says irritably.
But what to do about that? Send him away to a looney bin for a few more weeks? Pump him full of IV nutrients and drug him out of his mind? The most important thing about recovery is honesty and will to change, and John wasn't sure Sherlock had much of either.
"I'm proud of you, love," John says between mouthfuls of food. "Cooking dinner, then eating it. Lots of progress. It does me good to see you healing."
John laughs quietly to himself, almost in disbelief. "Fancy that: Sherlock Holmes the hopeless romantic."
"Are you sure you're up for this, love?"
"Well, that's the end of our hour. Please, just think about it, okay? You need to decide if you want to heal and be with John enough to make some major changes. Have a nice night, Sherlock, I'll see you next week."
"I love you too," he says sleepily, thoroughly loving the feeling of John's arms wrapped around him.
John caught sight of Sherlock the instant he walked through the doors of the hotel. It was 7am, and Sherlock looked like he’d already been awake for hours. He sat primly in the antique-style chairs in the hotel restaurant, one suited trouser leg crossed over the other, sipping tea. For a moment, John was transported back to a calm Sunday morning at 221B, rare London sunlight streaming through the windows, highlighting domesticity and high cheekbones. If only he’d ever touched those sunkissed lips to his own one of those soft mornings, maybe those mornings would still be a reality. He couldn’t think like that- he was incredibly grateful for the life he’d had with Rosie- but John still ached to have one more morning wrapped in the nostalgic comfort of Baker Street.
Sherlock huffed. “I can arrange for her care.”
John chuckled. “Planning on never getting up, then?”
“Are you willing to risk it?”
He worried the fabric near the waist of his ancient cream-colored jumper, nearly worn through. It was the only tell that he had any feelings at all about Rosie’s confession.
“Not even Northumberland?”

John slides his hand up Sherlock’s chest to his neck to his cheek, cataloguing every bump and smooth line on Sherlock’s body he’s never been able to touch, linger on before, and possibly won’t again.
“You done?” John flexed his fists a couple times, and remembered a time a few years ago when he would’ve wanted to use them. Now, he would work through this. He wanted Sherlock enough-
Sherlock already had the schedule memorized, so there was no need to keep up the flirtatious act. He stood up straight and turned wordlessly away from Connor, making his way toward Watson and friends. “Oh, I really don’t think he’d mind,” he said, and the image of John slapping him on the back like a mate down the pub and making a cheeky remark about pulling Janine at his own wedding came to mind.
) to look at him. “Yes, John, you are. How breathtakingly observant of you,” Sherlock bites, running a hand through his already unruly curls. The vitriol in his voice is unmistakable. With Sherlock so close, John can see that he looks undone, too. His hair is wild, his eyes are red-rimmed, his dressing robe is stained, and his cheeks look hollow.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’d only look properly shagged if you had decided to intrude about an hour later,” Sherlock calls playfully from the kitchen. He puts the kettle on. “Fancy a cuppa?”
Sherlock curls into his chest. “Mmm, yes. Do you mean

A sleek black car pulled up to the curb outside his flat just as the rain started to pour. He gathered his things, prepared a very eager Earl for their adventure, put on his jacket, and scanned his flat, as if he’d be returning as a different man. Part of him hoped that he would. Part of him wished he wouldn’t have to return to this flat-- he still had that deep craving for life as it was in 221B, though, he knew that life was no longer his. Part of him didn’t want to leave at all, for fear of what- or who- he would find at the other end. Sherlock scared him. He always had. But looking out the window at the grey clouds and rain pounding onto the pavement, John realized, it wasn’t Sherlock that had scared him. It was their mutual ability to destroy each other.
John snorted. “God help anyone who tries to hold her back from anything.” John could be so predictable, still hanging onto old sibling resentments despite the sober status she’d clearly worked hard to earn. But then, John had always been slow to forgive.
“John, are you-“
Molly jumped at the tap on her shoulder. She hated being taken by surprise. She was in her third rather heated argument of the day with Sherlock at the moment, and dammit if she needed more food than a bag of crisps for lunch. Couldn’t this person see that she was in the middle of some--
Information is power. Moriarty had known it. Magnussen had known it. Sherlock thought he knew it. But in standing by and allowing that drip to seep into John’s precious veins, he had stripped John of his autonomy.
“Rat Number One.” He felt panic rise in his throat. What was Lord Moran’s daughter doing marrying John Watson’s daughter? The universe was rarely so lazy.
“That makes two of us,” Sherlock whispered, tightening his grip on John’s hand. John buried his head into Sherlock’s thigh, and after a few moments, Sherlock tentatively began to rub John’s head. In any other situation, John may have found this vulnerable position to be demeaning, but it was Sherlock, and his touch and heady scent of worn denim, lavender, and tobacco was healing. Sherlock’s hands combed through his hair rhythmically. John couldn’t remember the last time he had been touched like this- so gently, reverently- and he moaned into Sherlock’s denim.
“What do you mean?”
and the tight clenching of muscle around his cock was enough to send John over the edge, and
“You want to, right? I can tell,” she said, bloody intuitive as ever. John looked at Sherlock and back at Rosie, and gave a stiff nod. He did want to go, in the way that his fingers twitched when he wanted a drink. “Stella and I can handle things around here. As long as we see you at the rehearsal dinner tonight.” She pointed a warning finger at the both of them, as if she were the one parenting them. She probably was.
Where could they be? She pulled out her mobile, ringing Dad. No answer. She rang Sherlock, and aha! He picked up on the fourth ring.
. To be fair, there was no way he could have expected to come back to this bedroom a married man. The proposal idea had come to him like a lightning strike, like one of Sherlock’s brilliant conclusions at the end of a string of connected deductions. Obviously, he hadn’t had a chance to stop at the pharmacy. He hadn’t had a chance to do much of anything besides marvel at the man currently lying arse-up underneath him.

Clara looks between the two of them and smiles. “You’re really fit together.”
He should’ve tried to help.
“Um.” John cleared his throat, feeling like Henry Knight the morning he’d come to their flat about the hound. “It certainly wasn’t one of our men.”
“Come at once if convenient. If inconvenient, come all the same”
John nearly laughed. Christ, it was his daughter’s wedding, he had about a million things to do, and Sherlock wanted John to go chasing after him on a case. He was winding up to give Sherlock a piece of his mind about twenty years of nothing and now this, when Rosie spoke up.
Xiaowen gave him a meaningful look. “I hope you’re wrong, Sherlock Holmes.”
“John, when I knew you were coming here, I considered that this was a...distinct possibility.”
Sherlock cursed the ease at which his mood lifted.
He slid a finger underneath Sherlock, who tilted his hips encouragingly. He slid one, then two fingers inside, gasping at the tight heat. He moved them in circles, stretching him. Sherlock moaned, clutching at John’s hair.
“Molly? Hello? HELLO? Did another passably attractive man just cause a circuit shortage in your brain? Or was it a daylight robbery? Ooh, that could be interesting-”
“I know,” Sherlock said, making eye contact. John licked his lips, and oh god-
“I’m glad,” he said, and he was genuinely pleased. He’d been proven correct just in time about the multiplicity of arsenic poisonings, but he’d also taken a liking to the grown-up version of Watson this afternoon, and she’d have been devastated if the poisoner had succeeded. However, Mycroft’s voice was like an annoying gnat’s in his brain:
in there?”
It’s harder this time, but John nods again.
“Sherlock, I don’t need--”

“Oh, yeah, he’s clearly trying to put you off with all these texts,” she said, making a grab for Dad’s mobile. His reflexes were instinctually good, however, and he pulled it away before she could steal it.

Stella’s mouth dropped open. “What?” she barely managed to whisper. She reached for Rosie, who dropped her hand from Dad’s back to rub Stella’s shoulders comfortingly.
She backspaced.

His fingers continued to move inside Sherlock, opening him up with gentle flexing, swirling, and sliding. When he’d been on the receiving end himself many
John considered this compromise and agreed.
John had the audacity to sit on the bed and patted the spot next to him. Sherlock pointedly pulled out the chair from under the desk and sank into it instead.
“Why not?” John asked, his tone dangerously close to exasperation. After weeks of rehearsals and screechy at-home practices, Rosie was going to perform in that bloody concert if it meant carrying her on stage.
, John. You needn’t worry.”
John squeezed his eyebrows together, replaying Sherlock’s words in his sleepy brain.“Hmm?” What was he on about?
Rosie sucked in a sharp breath. She’d known this man for a day, and he’d already saved her partner’s life, deduced her latte order, and gave her a perfect accessory for her wedding without ever having seen her dress. She was starting to understand exactly what Dad had seen in him during that first strange meeting in the blog. But there were still things he wasn’t saying.
“I felt it from the beginning. But I suppose I didn’t realize it or accept it until Irene.”
“Sherlock Holmes, eh? The detective bloke?” Seamus asked, smoothing the label onto the envelope. His soft Irish lilt had always been endearing to Rosie. “You hiring him?”
doing with his blog, but even so).
Sherlock had been naive, then. Blinded by undead optimism. Fooled by the stories he’d constructed for himself with this adoring Mind Palace version of John, some of them in this very room.
John let out a breath of laughter, pulling Sherlock in front of him to wrap his sturdy arms around his midsection from behind as if Sherlock was a giant cuddly toy. Sherlock sank into the embrace as John’s head came to rest on the side of his shoulder (he wasn’t quite tall enough to place his chin atop it) and he had to hold back a sigh of contentment. If he could secure John’s arms around him indefinitely, that would be ideal. “Don’t like goodbyes.” Sherlock felt John’s nose scrunch against his jacket sleeve, and he wished he’d seen it instead. Nix the arm securement plan. “I’ll see most of them tomorrow at brunch, anyway.”
Rosie playfully pushed Elaine away and parted Stella’s lips under hers to make a point.
“Tell me what you want me to do,” Sherlock instructs, and John smiles. Sherlock is too good at knowing what he’ll like, which is not the least bit surprising.
Sherlock stood aside and gestured for her to come in. She didn’t hesitate, taking off her shoes, striding right into the room, handing one bag of food each to John and Sherlock, and sitting on the edge of John’s bed cross-legged. She stuck a wooden stick into a piece of fried chicken and popped it into her mouth.
Sherlock smiled, and started typing a packing list.
His cock twitched in his pyjamas. “Keep talking.”
“Yes. And it was spectacular,” he answered. He thought John would turn away in embarrassment, or punch his arm, or apologize, but he did none of those things. Instead, he pulled at Sherlock’s shirt and went up on his toes to kiss him. In public.
Sherlock cleared his throat, the heaviness of the space between them close to activating his tear ducts. “Well, then. Come be cliche and ring in the New Year properly.”
John ran a hand through Sherlock’s hair, encouraging him to move closer.
The sentiment was clearly meant to be kind, but it only fueled his bitterness. He swallowed it down in favor of a forced, polite smile.
is simple- you said it yourself- anyone would want this tea. It could so easily be weaponized. An airline could potentially use it for people filling out customs forms- smuggling drugs into Taiwan has been a heavily reported problem. Passport fraud is also relatively common. There could have been a specific passenger on the flight who was being targeted.” Usually, Sherlock liked to keep his theories to himself until they had sufficient evidence to be impressive, but under the influence of the truth-tea, he was thinking aloud.
Sherlock hums and runs his hands down John’s sides. “Move,” he directs, shifting his hips slightly in encouragement, his legs tightening around John’s own.
daughter is marrying mine!” Dad’s voice went scarily loud and high by the end, and Rosie startled.
The story tears at John’s chest. Even then, Sherlock knew. They had wasted so much time. “Did you...enjoy it? Sex, I mean?”
He’d spent years of his life now, millions of kilojoules keeping a bolted lock on John’s corner of his Mind Palace. Still, wisps had floated through, powerful smells and certain phrases wearing away at the wooden beam (why had he made it wooden? Repairs were in order). But at this request, being asked to say anything about John at will, years’ worth of memories threatened to spill out, to drown the entire place. He leaned against the beam, putting his entire weight against it, and still memories slipped through.
HELLO JOHN SH
“But John,” he tried, the emotion in his voice betraying him, “Please, consider it.”
, Sherlock, yeah, I mean, I want to, but we don’t have to right
“It’s called ‘Slipping Through My Fingers’,” she blushed. “It’s from your point of view.”
John kisses Sherlock again, open-mouthed. He reaches inside Sherlock’s pants, pulls out Sherlock’s gorgeous cock and begins stroking in earnest, the pre-cum leaking from the head just enough to lubricate. They’re going to feel the chafe in a few hours, but at the moment, John doesn’t care. Fuck, he doesn’t care one bit; he’s getting off with Sherlock! God, he’s waited so long for this, and it’s so wrong, and so right, and so,
Jacqueline was wearing her hotel uniform, smiling down at him. She was pretty, around John’s age, and single, and on a small Isle, that combination naturally meant that acquaintances had tried to set them up, more than once. But other than the occasional holiday party, he hadn’t interacted with her much, and besides, he wasn’t interested. He’d given up on dating years ago.
Sherlock was breathing heavily. “And only if you want this, John, then I’d like you to push into me,” Sherlock’s voice lowered to a whisper, “fill me up.”
She decided to let it go- it really was none of her business, she supposed. She would relay the news to Sherlock (which was more than that mail-order-body-parts-bastard deserved), and he would have to be satisfied. For now, though, Molly just wanted to look at photos of John Watson’s adorable dog.
What's the name of the game?
Rosie squealed. “Let’s go, then.”
“If you take this case, retrieve the tea leaves and secure the perpetrators, I’ll see about terminating your contract.”
10. Journeys
The speeches came to a halt after that, when Dad pulled Sherlock into a deep kiss so intense, Rosie had to signal the band to start playing.
it!” John countered. “I chalked my lack of control over what I was saying up to the disorientation of a thirteen hour flight, but now that I know what it feels like to drink this tea, I’m certain I’ve had it before.”
Sherlock eyed him, pausing for a brief moment before dashing off. “It’s good to see you, John.”
The artist friend gave Watson a sloppy one-armed hug. The actress spoke for both of them. “Of course. There’s plenty of room in those double beds.”
The invitation featured a professional photograph of her and her fiance embracing at Port Erin, and their names and wedding details in dramatic script:
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but smiled in spite of himself. “Your reptilian brain is truly astounding.” He huffed, undoubtedly trying to cover up his rather adorable blush.
John turned around in the mirror, eyeing himself in his grey morning suit. He nearly did a double take. Hell, he didn’t look half bad-- he’d cleaned up from the previous night’s chaos and the morning’s spat with Sherlock as nicely as he could have done. Nothing much he could do about his growing beer belly pushing at the buttons, but otherwise, he thought he looked rather smart. Seeing Greg after, what, ten years, and a hot shower had done a world of good. He and Greg caught up that morning over lattes and sausages after Sherlock left the hotel in a rush John wished he’d been swept into. But the Sherlock-induced whiplash wasn’t as much of a shock as the news that the (recently retired) D.I. was shacked up with Molly Hooper.
9. “Is it too early for a ______?” -John to Mary in The Six Thatchers
“I’d best be off. I’ve got to be back at Bart’s in fifteen,” said Stamford, putting on his jacket. He smiled across the table at John. “It’s always nice to see you, John. It’s good to see you doing well and all.”
“Want to make you come,” John growls. He sits back and changes the angle so he can pull Sherlock’s hips onto him. This results in a spectacular moan. John grins; he’s found the prostate. “Touch yourself.”
“You just can’t ask me to do that kind of thing anymore, you know. I’m only going to say it once more: I’m not sending you mail-order body parts, Sherlock.”
40. Tea with an employer locale?
The exchange quickly devolved from a waking kiss into a heated, motivated brush of tongues and a teasing roving of hands. John rolled them over so that he was straddling Sherlock’s hips, applying more pressure just
“You’re lucky I came, then,” John smirked.

The next Sunday, John strayed from his usual newsagent.
“Sherlock,” he greeted, his voice far more even than Sherlock’s own, holding out a hand in greeting. Disappointingly, uncomfortably formal. Sherlock took it.
“We’re going to have to dry her off,” a low, familiar voice that felt like a blanket on John’s skin came from behind. John closed his eyes, having dreamt about hearing that voice for five years now. He stood tall, took a deep breath, and turned to address Sherlock.
always been that clueless? The two of them were right idiots with each other.
Much hello-ing and hugging and laughing is offered, and Sherlock finds himself among them, feeling for once in his life as if he belongs somewhere, that he is not merely tolerated, but liked, even loved, and it feels wonderful.
"Stop what, love?"
"When?"
"Of course it did, Sherlock, we lo--"
"Alright," John agrees. "Let's see..."
John screenshots the search history, all of it, and sends the images to his phone, before deleting the screenshots from the computer and clearing the history. He kept the photos for documentation, but clears the history for the sake of Sherlock's fragile state. It's a funny sort of compromise, but John does his best to meet Sherlock halfway.
John looks up at Sherlock, dropping his arm. "Well, we best get to it."
John nods, emotion flashing briefly across his face, too quickly for Sherlock to name.
"All right." John says, standing to get up before his boyfriend inturrupted,
"Well, if you feel that way, I guess--"
"Can we watch a documentary?" Sherlock asks, feeling slightly sheepish about his request for some reason.
John places a gauze pad on the wound and wraps it up. He sits still and stares at the dressed wound for a few moments, and for once Sherlock can't tell what he's thinking.
"Okay Sherl." John says with a smile, laying back down and pulling a blanket over them, John grunting in discomfort on the tiny couch.
But it's his first case in almost 6 months. If he had to eat one meal a day in order to have it, isn't that worth it a little? Besides, it was 2 meals less than he was usually required to eat. Sherlock decides not to push his luck. A case is worth one meal a day.
"I don't know Sherlock, how are you?" John says, not looking up from his newspaper.
Sherlock had been sat on the couch for a solid 6 hours. Not because he was in his mind palace, or because he was watching a film. No, it was because Cluedo fell asleep in his lap at around noon and Sherlock didn't have the heart to move her.
"I don't think I ever--"
He can't see clearly, but he knows what he's looking at is horrifying.
"You're plenty strong, mate, you're just focusing your efforts on the wrong things." John says with a hint of a smile.
Sherlock brings his hand down to John's muscular shoulders and touches him lightly, his fingertips gracing the bare skin.
"You...
Frank nods, gesturing to continue.
Sherlock pulls away, and runs his shaking hands through his hair, and wipes his face and blows his nose with a kerchief he kept in his inside jacket pocket.
John looks briefly hurt, but shakes it off. Lately Sherlock has been feeling guilty when that happens. He used to not care who he hurt by being brutally honest, but there was something about the look of betrayal and sadness in John's face that made him hate himself for not being as loving as John is. Especially, he felt, because he didn't deserve the kindness John so freely gave.
John stirs slightly, mumbling "It's okay, it's okay, s'okay..."
"What song is that, my dear John?" Sherlock asks quietly, not wanting to disturb the calm, peaceful ambiance.
"So," John say, his voice taking on a serious tone. "I've asked everyone to mind their business and not treat you any different, but just remember that no one is entitled to your life story. If Donovan or some other asshole is being a prick about it, you can just tell them to shut the hell up, and that would be okay."
like to talk about?" He asks.
"You doing alright, love?" John asks, appearing beside him.
John's whispered "goodnight" did not reach the detective, as he had fallen soundly asleep.
John scoffs and looks off the the side, shaking his head in disbelief. "Sherlock, if you hadn't cut yourself in the first place then I wouldn't have to do this. Don't act like it's my fault you do a shitty job of concealing how hurt you are. We need trust, Sherl. That's the number one thing of any relationship, and we've been scrimping along without it, but we can't go on like this. How long ago did you cut?"
"Hey, Sherl..." He whispers softly, trying to convey his emotions through his eyes.
When they left the room and were out of earshot, John says, just loudly enough for Sherlock to hear him,
The cuts on his arm were mostly superficial, but there were three that required stitches and one that Sherlock had to beg John to not have him go to hospital. John had said the only reason why he didn't bundle Sherlock into the car and take him there was because the cut had narrowly missed the two major arteries and only nicked one tendon.
“She’s stable, thank god,” John breathed through the phone. He sounded absolutely knackered, and Sherlock felt anything but. John Watson was on the other end of the line, and he’d just saved a life. Luckily, the ambulance had arrived within minutes of the phone call with Rosie, and John had immediately put Stella on dialysis and ordered a Dimercaprol drip.
Mycroft shifted his weight onto his left leg (the weaker one) and raised an eyebrow. “Oh? Why ever not?” He glanced pointedly at John’s empty chair behind him. “According to Dr. Watson’s account, you’d be ready to flee the country at the drop of a hat if he needed you to
“It’s mostly Sherlock’s things,” he said, setting the table with a dish filled with chicken pesto spaghetti and sundried tomatoes. It smelled heavenly, of home. She knew this meal well.
A talking gecko stars in their adverts
Sherlock scoffed as if Mycroft was the last person he’d ever allow at a celebration for his wedding, and Mycroft forced a patronizing smile as if he’d be the last person ever to attend. “No, no. Thank you, Dr. Watson, but I’ve a work call to make,” he declined, and John almost wished he’d accepted. The idea of seeing Mycroft interact with the commonfolk at a brunch affair was comical. “When do you expect to return to London?”
A wave of self-consciousness swept over him. He looked like shit-- an unplanned night in the ER hadn’t done his weary eyes any favors, and he wasn’t yet dressed for the wedding in an old pair of jeans and a Manx fishing t-shirt. A gaggle of tourists in the lobby chatted excitedly about the TT, and he walked past them across the lobby to join Sherlock at a cozy two-person table. He dared a light touch along Sherlock’s shoulder to his neck in greeting, testing the waters. Sherlock didn’t lean into the touch, but he didn’t reject it, either.
Sherlock cut him off with a perfectly tight pull on John’s cock, stroking as he spoke. “Shut. Up. And fuck me.”
John’s arousal twitches. “Christ, Sherlock, keep talking like that and I won’t be able to sleep.”
21. Medieval address to a king
“Sherlock, please.”
Stella tensed. “All of it?”
“Oh, you’re just showing off now. You haven’t even seen her yet.” John stretches and hangs his feet over the side of the bed, realizing the only clothing he has in this room is his suit. Sherlock jumps up off the bed and fetches a dressing gown from his dresser. John can’t stop staring at his arse in those tight black pants. Are they Calvin Klein?
Sherlock breathes out, blissful and sleepy. “I do.”
! He should have known.
Sherlock and John exchanged knowing glances. Sherlock put his paper bag of chicken down on the nightstand. “Xiaowen, does your girlfriend know about the tea?”
This offer actually sounded tempting, but there was no chance of revealing that to Mycroft. The thought of leaving London still pulled at him. If he left John now, even for a short time, he didn’t know if he would ever get him back, and Sherlock couldn’t take another rejected return.
“No. Cam, I believe their name was, flirted with Clara from the start of the service, bringing up a story about a work dinner they attended a few years ago. Clara was particularly susceptible to advances yesterday, having had such an emotional day. They’ve been waiting for their chance with her. It was the perfect storm.” John doesn’t miss the similarities to his own behavior.
John reached between them, taking Sherlock’s cock in hand and stroking him to full hardness.
“Is that how she met Edward? She made marketing materials for his art exhibits?” Sherlock asked, and Xiaowen visibly shrunk. She had thought Sherlock was trying to make conversation, not investigate.
The directness startled him. Molly had never been a wilting flower, but now? She was a fully bloomed rose with a few Sherlock-aimed thorns. It was entertaining to watch them interact after twenty years of friendship without John’s divisive presence looming over them. Sherlock and Molly were proper friends, now, without the semblance of a power imbalance that had existed before, when Molly was head over heels.
Do away with
“Stop, stop,” Watson shook her head as if to erase her memory of the last thirty seconds. “Fine. I’ll cover for you,” she conceded, and Sherlock cheered inwardly, not caring one bit about the cover, but at Watson’s clear approval. She hadn’t had two minutes of mental preparation for her father to get married, and Sherlock had learned through years of working cases with resentful stepchildren that parental remarriage could be challenging for people to deal with. Not Watson, though. She had essentially played Cupid in all of this. He owed her this embrace of John’s in which he was currently wrapped, and all the ones to come.
John continued, “I know I’m not very good at saying things. Haven’t been.”
New lines had etched themselves into Sherlock’s forehead and around his eyes. His
John reached out a hand, and she took it. “Take care, Xiaowen. Maybe next time I can actually be a real tourist here.”
Elaine sighed exaggeratedly. “Let’s save it for the wedding night, yeah?”
He could turn around right now, and Molly would never have known he was there. But he was John Watson, dammit, and he could-- would-- face her. He squared his shoulders, and with a set of his jaw, he marched forward.
29. Grows weary
“No,” she smiled, “in Chiayi.” Joy was radiating from her, and Sherlock couldn’t find it in himself to be annoyed at Mycroft.  “I love Taiwan- I couldn’t leave. I suspect you know the feeling, Sherlock Holmes.”
“Hey!”
Sherlock gawked. “Sorry?”
John guiltily looked away. “Right, yeah. Not going to tell me about the case, then?”
He, Sherlock, Molly, and Greg sat round a table, chatting and joking like twenty years hadn’t passed. As guests milled around the dining room, Sherlock told the table the most interesting and provoking deductions: Strangers exchanged numbers in the optimistic wedding afterglow. Harry planned how to break up with her new girlfriend. Lisa Liu regretted announcing her previous marriage to Lord Moran to the entire crowd. Elaine flirted with a fine arts school alum simply for the networking. Rosie intended to give John and Sherlock a wedding gift.
One was set for John in the lab at Baskerville
"I can still recall
“Is it...truth serum?” Sherlock asked, a million different thoughts and questions and wonders floating in his head.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “So do you.”
John leaned impossibly closer, moving his wine-stained lips to Sherlock’s ear and whispered, “If you pull that crap again, I’ll be heartbroken.”
Any feelings that may have existed between them were ancient history. They’d had a blip of rushed groping sprinkled in the middle of a twenty year separation-- even the strongest of emotions couldn’t withstand such a stretch of time. It had only taken two years for John to move on the first time around.
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day

John took in the sight of spilt tea and a half-finished plate of eggs on the table. “Breakfast?”
Iris laughed. “So you’d give it away? Please. I had a microdose and the airline was already interested in a trial run.”
Instead, to her credit, she just snarkily says "Welcome back,
Sherlock exhaled irritably, irked at his boyfriend's comment. Didn't he know how hard it was for him to leave that bathroom, to put down the blade and wake him up, blood still dripping down his arm as he shamefully shook John awake?
"Come on then. It'll be fun. I promise." He reaches out a hand to Sherlock, who reluctantly takes it and is pulled into a standing position and led into the kitchen.
"I promise I will try." Sherlock amends, his voice tight and his breathing shallow.
"So it's gone up, hasn't it?" Sherlock says snappily.
Sherlock forces his "I'm fine, what are you, a cop?" face on, and quickly shakes it off and addresses Lestrade.
waste that."
Lestrade places several hors d'oeuvres on a plate and hands it to Sherlock, who takes it reluctantly. "Have you had any yet? They're very good."
"Work on yourself." John stated again. "Recover, then we'll talk."
"Do you...do you love me?" Sherlock asks, hating how small and uncertain he sounds. Like some schoolgirl waiting for an answer on his "do you love me? Check yes or no" note.
"All right, lovely," John comments, washing his hands, gesturing for the detective to join him. John takes Sherlock's long, slender hands in his own and washes them, lovingly stroking the side of his palm with his thumb, gazing at him adoringly. Sherlock smiles despite himself, and leans in to kiss John.
John pulls a first aid kit out of the closet, where he kept his gauze and suture needles and the like. It's more like Sherlock's emergency kit than a first aid kit, and it's not the first time they've had to use it.
"Do you...do you think that will be okay forever?" Sherlock murmurs into John's neck. "I know you have...urges...and I can't satisfy them. Is that going to be a problem? Am I going to have to...I don't know, share you?" The last two words came out shakily, and John can feel his irregular breathing under his hands.
feel sexual attraction? Isn't that a basic fact of biology, the urge to reproduce?
Soon, John notices Sherlock's breathing growing slow and even, and it appears the detective has fallen asleep. John feels a rush of affection for him, not quite sure why, but there it was regardless. He really needs to start preparing dinner, but for now, he can sit with Sherlock until the documentary ends.
Later, when both men were curled up in the two twin sized beds they shoved together, John turns over to look Sherlock in the eye.
"I...thank you..." Sherlock says, a little uncertainly. "I missed being here last year as well. It's good to see you too, Molly."
"It's okay, love, let it out. I'm here. I'm here." John whispers, holding him tighter and pressing Sherlock's head into his chest. "Listen to my heart. As long as it's beating, you'll be okay. You're okay."
"You hear that?" John's voice was a deep rumble in his chest.
Being with John always inspired this particular feeling, which had only intensified as they became involved with one another, but he had never taken time to name it until now. Feeling safe hasn't really been a thing up until his more recent years, but he did rather enjoy the feeling. It was nice to know that for once, taking care of and protecting himself wasn't entirely up to him now.
He slips on his coat and ties his scarf, trying to feel normal again. He needed to get back into his usual mindset if he were going to make it through the case emotionally intact. A few deep breaths, and Sherlock starts to slip back into his old personality again.
John couldn't have been happier.
Sherlock had forgotten to grab his coat after he argument with John and was paying sorely for it.
John nods and smiles, thoroughly enjoying his reaction. "Yes. I didn't get anything major, you could probably solve it in 48 hours, but I figured it was better than nothing."
He prayed.
Sherlock closes his eyes and sighs. He feels tears pressing at the back of his eyes and a lump rising in his throat. But he stands anyway, wiping the majority of the blood away with some toilet paper and tossing it into the toilet, flushing it. He shakes the sleeves of his long-sleeved T-shirt down before opening the bathroom door miserably. He doesn't look up at John, keeping his eyes on the floor.
"You shouldn't have to get used to it. No one should." John says softly.
"Okay. I love you too."
Sherlock pretends to consider, making a fake frown. "Oh really? I guess it's no use trying then--"
Sherlock stiffens, all to used to voices in his head. But he relaxes after a moment. This was a voice he recognized. This was John's voice.
"How so?" Sherlock asks, confused.
John just smiles kindly, and lays back down on the bed, pulling Sherlock down with him and locking him in a warm embrace.
Sherlock is silent, emotions bubbling and broiling, too hot to sort out which was guilt and which was anger and which was sorrow.
John turns around suddenly, pulling the detective into a long, desperate kiss that left Sherlock dazed.
"Thank you," Sherlock says, almost a whisper. "It means a lot to me. More than you ever know."
"Sherl, mate, maybe if you weren't so sarcastic you'd have more friends," John mutters, a smile betraying him.
Sherlock's cheek twitches with irritation; he quite hated nicknames, especially ones that weren't true. But he loved John, so he was willing to endure for his sake.
"All of Me, by John Legend." Sherlock answers instantly, surprising himself with his unexpected knowledge. "I remember hearing it when it first came out a few years ago, shortly after I met you, actually. Kept thinking; hoping, really, that someone would love me like that. You seemed too good to be true, so I didn't bank on it. It turned out to be you after all."
The door creaks open, startling John out of his catastrophic thinking spiral. He stands immediately, but resists the urge to rush over and meet Sherlock at the door. He noticed that it irritated his boyfriend to be constantly fussed over when he returned home from therapy.
"For what?" John asks kindly.
Sherlock gingerly unwraps the chicken and places it in the microwave on a plate, attempting to steal a look at the nutrition facts on the label. He doesn't get a clear view, but the first number is 1, and it looks like a triple digit number. So, a max of 199 calories. It's not too bad.
"I love you too, John."
"It's Greg, and okay." he says, walking off.
John blinks, not expecting that answer. "What do you mean by that? Asexual, what is that?"
Sherlock nods and tries to give John a grateful look before taking the cup of tea and sipping it. It was warm, and the heat travelled down his throat and spread across his chest, effectively calming his nerves and stilling his still slightly trembling hands. He doesn't quite remember the calorie count in Earl Grey tea, it's not high, but he can taste some honey in the tea and briefly wonders how many unseen calories he's consuming. He's too exhausted to attempt mental calculations, so he just sighs and leans into John.
"You're correct, it's not your business." Sherlock interrupts icily.
Sherlock laughs softly at this. He was never one for labels, but he knew from a rather young age that he wasn't entirely straight. The thought didn't plague him like it does so many others, but it was just a fact. Sherlock Holmes is not straight. He never had a boyfriend or girlfriend or any sort of significant other to prove it, but he knew what he liked. And he liked John.
"Okay, well...I love you, okay?" John says, stretching up on tiptoe to kiss the taller man gently.
a case.
Sherlock obliges, returning his attention to the kitten resting on his stomach.
"I don't think I did either," Sherlock said quietly, trying to go through his mental databases and find even a sliver of what he felt for John before he met him. Nothing.
John pushed Sherlock away slightly, just far enough so he can make eye contact. "Never, my love. I'm yours, and yours alone. I can...make do. The internet is a wonderful place," he says with a wink. "Unless that bothers you?"
His intense inner battle is interrupted by a ridiculously tiny mew. He jerks his head up, making eye contact with the little black kitten that had appeared in the doorway.
The two sit in the shower and hold each other until the hot water runs cold.
Lestrade shrugs, unbothered. "And your whole deducing bit you do is none of yours either. You eat what you'd like, but I'm pretty sure John would want you to eat something."
"I'll be there in a minute. I'm fine." Sherlock lies. He glances at his wrist, where blood was still running freely down his forearm. If he stops now he can probably get away with it. There was still the issue of obtaining a new razor before his scruff becomes noticeable, but he'll burn that bridge when he comes to it.
While the documentary was fascinating, Sherlock couldn't help but submit to the wonderful sensation of John stroking his hair. If Sherlock were a cat himself, he would be purring up a storm.
But watching Sherlock, the love of his life, break down so completely and thoroughly? It hurt his heart. Luckily he knew how to handle a panic attack, but if it weren't for the fact that he dealt with it regularly, John would have broken down himself, unable to cope with seeing his boyfriend in such distress. He hadn't ever seen Sherlock have a full blown panic attack; the worst thing he saw in that regard were his minor anxiety attacks that would leave him frozen for a minute or two. Sure, that was difficult to watch anyway, but watching the great consulting detective reduced to a pile of tears and fear in front of him shook him to his core.
John is standing right outside the bathroom door, stumbling back when Sherlock opens the door in his face.
Sherlock turns over again, pressing his back closer into John's chest. His boyfriend settles his fingers into the detective's hair once more, lightly scratching his scalp.
Looking at that bird, all he could see were calories. 200 calories in one serving of turkey breast, over 1,000 calories in one leg, and that was assuming he could stop eating after that. His fists clench, and while John is carving the turkey, he steals away into the bathroom.
...to deal with."
"Hello John! I know I'm a bit early; I overestimated traffic a smidge and ended up getting here a few minutes ahead of schedule." she says, stepping across the threshold.
"Christ, Sherlock, don't do this. Don't you dare try to pin this on me. Don't you
John just smiles again. "Sherlock, I'm just laughing because even after all this, after all the hell we've been through in the past six months, you're still the most stupid, stubborn git I've ever met in my entire godforsaken life. It's just funny at this point. Sure, it used to hurt, but now I know that
Lestrade stops talking, holding his hands up in surrender. "Alright. You're in charge here, I'll consider this not my division until you get back."
"I know." Sherlock says quietly. "I didn't see it, but I heard about it. After."
John rolls his eyes, "This is my face. I'm not making any faces, Sherl."
"Of course," John adds, "it was a little rocky in the beginning. I could never tell if you had any feelings whatsoever towards me, all I had to go on were the little things that you did only for me. I never could crack your facade, and when you made me tell you that I loved you, I was bloody terrified. After that kiss the night before you were admitted...I thought I had fucked things up. That I ruined whatever we had."
But he did. And that was pretty damn special.
Sherlock turns abruptly into the nearest room, throwing open the door hard enough to dent the adjacent wall, staggering halfway into the room before collapsing onto his hands and knees, his back arched and heaving. Great gasps and ragged sobs are torn from his body, and he feels like the entire world is ending right here, right now. There wasn't enough air, his head was on fire, and his chest felt like someone was being crushing him into a vice. Why the hell was he like this?? Why can't he just go back to normal life?? He
"It's fine. I'll get used to it." Sherlock says, trying to force out words amidst the avalanche of frustrating emotions.
"Welcome back, Sherlock! How was your week?" Frank asked as Sherlock walked into his office.
"Thank you, John. This means the world to me," Sherlock says, unable to contain the grin spreading across his face. Slowly, ever so slowly, the detective was learning how to feel again.
"That would be
That's the emotion he was feeling right now.
John wasn't a psychologist, he was an army doctor and he knows nothing about the inner workings of the mind; certainly not one as complex as Sherlock's. No one knew what goes on in that head of his.
Lestrade and Donovan exchange looks, which Sherlock doesn't like, but he presses on, trying to act like he used to.
The sounds coming out of John's mouth are wretched, broken, and it's the worst sound Sherlock has ever heard in his life.
Sherlock glares at John, but picks up his fork and spears a pineapple chunk, bringing it towards his mouth and chewing slowly.
"Come
"Okay, I think we're ready," John says, making Sherlock look up at him with a silly half smile on his face.
As the cab pulls up to the hospital, Sherlock inhales deeply, hold his breath, and exhales again, for 4 seconds each time. He didn't like using therapy-mandated coping skills such as breathing exercises, but they did help some. The detective is, again, put off by how deeply his supposed recovery is affecting him. Turning the thrill of the chase into an anxiety-inducing activity. All those damn emotions being dredged up would be the death of him. Poor choice of words, he admits, but the sentiment is the same.
But not this time.
Sherlock's mouth twitches again, and the half-hearted smile stays a fraction of a second longer than the last one.
Sherlock's breath hitches, and he pulls back once again. John's vision is slightly clouded with lust, and he tries to blink away the sexual tension so he can see the situation properly.
anything."
Perhaps there was no "maybe" about it, actually. John rarely allowed himself to think positively at this point for fear of catastrophic disappointment, but things definitely have been on an upward trend. Sherlock had gained almost 7kg in the past 5 months, and was more consistent with meals, despite not eating much, and he had been clean from self harm, cigarettes, and purging for a solid 6 weeks. John knew it was dangerous to let his guard down, but he still felt so immensely proud of Sherlock that he thought his heart may burst.
The detective nods, blinking hard and shaking his head. Some life is returning to his eyes, and he seems to wake up more with every sip of coffee. He was sitting up straighter now, and his usual sense of regality and confidence returns with each passing minute. It did John good to see him back to himself, more or less, even though he knew it was mostly a facade. John can't help but marvel at how the detective masquerades as normal and functioning almost 24/7, even after being reduced to a heaving mess upon a hospital floor not even 16 hours ago. John doesn't think he could ever have that much strength and courage. Yes, he had been in the military and had seen a lot of shit, but he always was relatively healthy. Fighting tooth and nail with his own mind every second of the day, and then appearing normal to everyone else? His grit had nothing on Sherlock's. But the worst thing? Sherlock didn't even know how strong he was.
"Look: you never have to speak about things that you aren't ready to talk about. But sitting there silent and petulant isn't going to help you, and honestly, Sherlock, I don't really see you having any kind of quality of life if you don't try. I don't really see you having much more life ahead of you if you don't  try and fight what has been a part of you for your entire life." Frank looks at his watch, allowing Sherlock a moment to compose himself again. Before he can say anything, the therapist speaks again.
John's voice whispers into his right ear, making the detective shiver.
"I'll take that as a 'I'm free, John, and I'll do whatever you'd like me to'" John laughs, reaching out and stroking Sherlock's hand.
"I hope so," the detective replies, equally as soft. "I'm feeling better now, I just hope it stays that way."
As the doctor traces his hands over the detective, his mind spins with worry.
"I think it's best if I'm off to bed," he says, stretching and yawning.
"You said we'd do something tonight," Sherlock whines, and John catches a glimpse of the petulant younger brother he once was.
"I haven't, actually, but I'm not really all that hungry..." Sherlock tries to protest, staring at the food on his plate. He had intended to eat at the party, but after googling how many calories a tiny hors d'oeuvre could pack, his resolve weakened with every passing moment. Not to mention the turkey and the cider and the champagne and the cake afterwards....it was too much. He couldn't do it.
try and tell me that my hurting myself was unjustified. You've been doing it for years because of how hurt you feel, and same goes for me. I stopped doing it, okay? I stopped cutting soon after you came back. I promise you I did." John says, his voice dropping in volume until that last part of what he said was whispered.
Sherlock nods, saying nothing, too irritated at the fact that Frank was right to formulate a rebuttal. The therapist leans back into the armchair again, crossing one ankle onto his other knee, a non-threatening and open gesture he probably studied in college.
like switching off a light. He's been at this for 30 years....surely it couldn't be that simple.
He turns, puzzled. What did that mean? Drugs? John had taken those up.
John is heard puttering around in the kitchen, and Sherlock hopes to God that he isn't making him food. It was all too much right now, and he can't handle the stress of eating at the moment. He does know that he hasn't eaten today, and that he promised to eat at least one meal a day on a case, but he doesn't think he's physically capable of that right now.
"Ah, wondered where she got to. You good with her in here?" he asks.
"Are you hurt?"
Then they bundle into bed, each wearing the others sweatpants; John's riding high on Sherlock's long legs, Sherlock's tangling around John's feet.
"I'm fine," Sherlock cuts them off, staggering to his feet only to collapse again, John doing his best to catch him, and Sherlock could see concern on his face at how light he was.
Sherlock says nothing, staring at the untouched fruit salad he had ordered.
As they returned to the flat, Sherlock tries to force all his negative feelings away so that he can enjoy winding down with John. It had been a routine with them: after a long day, or any day, really, they would settle down in the living room with a film and Cluedo, and decompress from the day. This always helped Sherlock when he was having a rough metal health day, and today was no different.
"Any particular reason for that gem of a kiss?" Sherlock says breathlessly.
"No, don't even say anything to defend yourself, Sherlock. I thought you were doing better. John said you were doing better."
He doesn't even know why he's still doing it. He's not particularly anguished at the moment, and his heart was still buzzing in his chest as a result of the slow kiss they had shared after breakfast, the taste of John's black coffee still on his tastebuds.
"You know what." He says irritably, but softens his voice, "Stop...cutting. How did you do that?"
The lights were low, curtains drawn, and Sherlock's head was resting in his lap, with Cluedo nestled between them, and for once, all felt right with the world.
"Yes, John?" Sherlock says sleepily, his eyelids drooping.
"I don't want them to be gentle," Sherlock says frustratedly. "I want to be treated the same way. I know they were never kind to me, but I don't care. I'm just tired of being abnormal. A freak."
Everntually, the fruit salad has been eaten and John promised to pay Sherlock for his troubles when they got home.
The two walk out of the room and down the hallway, Sherlock leaning a bit heavily on John, but doing his best to gather his thoughts and emotions again.
John feels a pang of guilt, but says nothing.
"Hush," John said firmly, yet fondly. "It's okay to let people do things for you."
"No, let me say this. I've been...angry at you. And I don't have a right to be, because you're just trying to take care of me since I can't do it on my own. And so I keep making jabs and accusations because of that," Sherlock explains, becoming more confident with every word he spoke. "I'm trying to understand what I'm feeling, because I don't like hurting you. Myself, no problem, but you? I could never."
Sherlock always looks over to the form sleeping beside him, resisting the urge to feel his neck for a pulse, to bring an ear to his mouth, listening for deep, even breaths. His fingers itch for something sharp, something to take the mental pain away and morph it into physical pain. He needs to cut.
"No, it's fine. I just wasn't aware it...impacted others so greatly." Sherlock admits, not meeting Molly's eye.
Sherlock pulls his gaze from the wall, his surprised eyes finally meeting John's. "Are you serious? I thought I was so incredibly, painfully obvious. I hated it. I felt like you always saw straight through me, and that you never said anything of it because you didn't feel the same."
is when you're like
It's John's turn to blush, but he gets up and piles blankets and pillows on the ratty couch in the den and snuggled into Sherlock.
John smiles lovingly, and Sherlock hopes to God that John could feel the love radiating off of him.
"Well...yeah, I suppose, for you, but not for me." Sherlock grits his teeth, annoyed at himself for coming to pieces for a damn number.
about that. I have no fucking clue what Donovan is going to say, and if I get one more pitying look from Grant or Gabe or whatever his name is, we might be looking at a completely different murder case."
"Can you hear me at all?"
John is still a bit unsure of the veracity of his statement, but he goes in to kiss Sherlock again anyway. Sherlock's hands travel his body quickly and desperately, and John slowly allows his hands to return to his waist, moving his hand further upwards delicately, while Sherlock seems to be out of his mind with the urgency to feel every square inch of John.
People were supposed to start arriving in less than an hour, at 7:00, and John was busy in the kitchen finishing up the food. It was mainly just hors d'oeuvres, but John was dead set on making a Christmas turkey that year. He had started cooking it at noon, and it was looking like it wouldn't be ready for another hour. He could tell John was stressing about it, but he didn't really know how to help with that. Comforting people wasn't really his strong suit, and he felt guilty because he knows that John would drop anything and everything just to make him feel better.
With that, they're kissing again, John's hands hesitatingly roaming over Sherlock's body, his fingertips stuttering across the detective's ribs and spine, and John feels a brief pang of sadness at the fact that Sherlock still had bones sticking out against his skin, even after six months of coerced eating.
And he did.
"And what if I can't?"
"Well, I suppose, but I still hated it," Sherlock admits, still having the remnants of a scowl on his face. "It felt so unnatural, being so completely in love and not able to do a bloody thing about it. I don't think I've ever been in love, actually."
"Hello, Sherlock." Molly says softly, not quite discreetly giving the detective a once-over. Sherlock represses an uncomfortable squirm, feeling very much on display. The fitted suit he was wearing had to be altered to fit him this year, and he was still very touchy about it.
"I figured you wouldn't want to eat anything right now, but I thought you'd might like a cuppa. The grapes are for me, but you're welcome to have them."
John is quiet, not making eye contact, throwing a glance at the room they just left. Several heads turned to stare at him, and Sherlock freezes like a deer in headlights, caught in the middle of his meltdown. Embarrassment colors his cheeks, and he storms off to the elevator to escape.
here for you.
"Well, I don't know, how else would you manage to hurt yourself for so many years when everyone was fighting to keep you from doing it? How else could you manage to do the things you do to yourself and still stay sane?"
compared to losing you."
Sherlock feels a brief flicker of annoyance, but soon pushes it off. "I only know important things John, you know this. Regardless, I'd like to watch one on cats."
-Wren
"What are you thinking about, love?" John asks softly, bringing Sherlock back into the present moment.
"Bull," John states, "I know you keep tabs on him. You know where everyone is."
Sherlock stirs next to him, and John pushes the upsetting thoughts away as he closed his book and turned to face the detective.
"So, first, we need to defrost the chicken," John says, handing the package of chicken to his boyfriend. "Just put it in the microwave on defrost for about 15 minutes."
Sherlock nods heavily, not looking at his boyfriend. "Yeah...just...just trying to wake up...I become absolutely useless after an attack...this is normal." His voice is husky and cracks every now and then, and John feels a pang of sadness watching his beautiful detective so deeply affected by his own mind. He proceeds into the bedroom and sits by his side, pressing the full length his body against Sherlock, who leans into his automatically.
His boyfriend laughs. "Yes, he does that to us all. Anyway, I just asked because you're looking at those crackers a little intensely. You don't have to have the hors d'oeuvres, but I'd like you to try some turkey later on. When they leave you can have whatever you'd like in return. Within reason."
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--"
Sherlock knew John wasn't nearly as well off as he had been, but John seemed fairly captivated by it, and somehow seemed more into it than Sherlock ever had been.
"Just watch the movie, mate," John chides.
Sherlock takes a breath, teetering on the edge of indecision. John was going to find out tonight anyway, but there was the matter of pride that Sherlock had too much of.
"Hey, just in case you've forgotten, I'm checking today. Your wrists. Legs. Wherever you usually...do..it." John says, trailing off as he looks at Sherlock's slightly puffier left sleeve. Sherlock thanks the gods that John wasn't observant enough to figure most things out.
"You've been in there awhile, love, I'm worried. Please, come back to bed?"
John nods sympathetically. "I know, love. But it's like cleaning: an area can't be clean and healthy unless you pull everything out into to open and start fresh. Just remember that people, are, as you say, stupid, and sometimes you're going to have to deal with ignorance and stupidity from people, and you can't let that affect you too deeply."
Eventually, his eyelids grow heavy, his mind grows foggy, and the detective falls asleep.
John laughs a little, his smile crinkling the corners of his hazel eyes in a way that made Sherlock want to kiss them.
"Just...nothing." Sherlock says, suddenly afraid to say anything that might worry John.
John says nothing.
"Kissing is okay," Sherlock says, appearing relieved that John wasn't making a big deal about it. "And so is cuddling, and holding hands, just not anything to do with sex. Making out is kind of pushing it, but as long as we don't have to have sex, I'm okay."
Sherlock stiffens as the realization hits him. Fuck! How could he have forgotten today was check day?! He might have been able to disguise the cuts with makeup or something if they were several days old, but he knew there was no way to cover up the fresh, deep ones that itched on his forearm as he panicked.
"Okay. I am. I'm sorry," he says, his voice barely above a whisper.
Sherlock smiles warmly, soothed by his words but still anxious that he might be lying.
So he ate about half of the sandwich, and almost out of habit, pushed his plate away. Yes, he was still hungry. No, he wasn't going to finish it. But he was trying, and that's what he felt mattered.
"I can do this by myself, I don't need..." Sherlock sleepily protests, trying to push John away a bit. It felt a little embarrassing, being carried to bed like a child that fell asleep in the car.
John smiles softly and takes the plate and half-eaten sandwich away to the kitchen without a comment. Sherlock appreciates that. He doesn't want a full 5 minutes of praise over eating half a sandwich, and he definitely doesn't want to be chided into eating the whole thing. Just a smile to acknowledge that John knew he was trying was enough.
"You're alright now, love," John says gently, spreading his hand flat against  the detective's scapula, moving closer and rubbing his hand over the admittedly less apparent bones in Sherlock's back. He sidles closer, drawing his boyfriend in for a hug. Sherlock clutches at him desperately, suddenly feeling like the only thing he can do right now is hold that military doctor as tight as he can before the world comes apart. Silent sobs shake his body, and John just holds him, rocking him through the final moments of his panic attack. Sherlock pulls back eventually, and kisses John for all he's worth. Tears find their way into his mouth, and the salt pricks at his tongue as he keeps their lips pressed together in a desperate kiss.
"What have you got for me?" the detective asks curtly, falling so easily back into the genius sociopath role he had assumed for years.
"No, John and I can do it ourselves," Sherlock interrupts.
But there was no denying it. Sherlock was doing better. His relapses were fewer and farther between, and he was less than a stone away from being in a healthy weight range. Mentally, John knew that it was still a battlefield for him. But at least he wasn't in physical danger anymore. And John doesn't think he's as suicidal anymore either. It's difficult for Sherlock to open up about such feelings, but he doesn't have that same desolate, dead look in his eyes anymore. And that was progress.
John sighs patiently. "I already told you that you need to work on recovery, and I stand by that. However," he adds when Sherlock opens his mouth to object, "I have seen you working hard and eating, and I'm proud of you. Which is why I took the liberty of finding us a case to do."
"Sounds good then," Sherlock says, awkwardly clasping his hands together and turning to walk away.
He had expected John to laugh and poke fun at him for not being able to process basic human emotion, but his boyfriend stayed silent, looking off to the side and appearing to ponder it genuinely.
"No, we haven't," Lestrade says, thankfully speaking to and looking at Sherlock as he normally would. "We were waiting for you. We--well,
Imagine going from a clever, mysterious, entirely over-competent detective to a depressed, queer, broken kind of man. He knew he was always like that, but he had never let it show. Now his facade is broken, and he has to decide whether to start constructing it again, or finally bare himself to the world. The latter option was not looking so good for him.
Sherlock mumbles something, but was muffled by the pillow he had shoved his face into.
It was Christmas Eve, and the flat truly looked it.
Sherlock's head shot up to meet his eyes. "Who told you that?"
Sherlock tries not to scowl as he steps on the scale John borrowed from the hospital. It was a blind scale, with the box and reader connected by a cord held by John, meaning that the only person who could see his weight was John.
"And that's all that matters," John says decisively.
The detective propped himself up onto his elbow, staring hard at John. "I don't think it's stupid. I felt the same. Like if I didn't do something you would leave me. Everyone else had, and that's why it was so horrid not saying anything, I felt like I had everything right in front of me, but I was too bloody terrified of actually
Sherlock's face flushes at this, despite the fact that no one actually said that. He turns over, his hand wavering hesitantly over his boyfriend's smooth cheek, right over the worry lines that had recently creased his beautiful face.
Standard reply.
He nods, trying his hardest not to let his expression betray him.
He opens his laptop, enters his passcode and waits for it to boot up. It always took forever, but whoever had used it last had completely shut it down, so it took even longer. He doesn't remember shutting it down last night, but he knows that Sherlock uses it at times, and thought it was probably him. Why the bloke didn't get his own laptop was beyond him.
Sherlock rips his hand from John's, spins around 90° to face him, absolute rage filling his face.
"Yeah sure whatever mate." John laughs, looking down and shaking his head as his face filled with warmth.
John gives him a hard stare.
"We are, my impatient one, just relax a bit," John says with a smile, "I just have to make you wait so that if he evening falls flat then you'll still enjoy it because you had to wait."
"How did it go?" John asks, trying to sound nonchalant and hide the tone of worry from his voice.
He only wished he had someone to share in his pride.
“I love you, too, John,” he smiles deviously, “But I’d also love for you to fuck me before I implode.”
“Xiaowen, this is...this is incredible. It’s a triumph of science,” Sherlock gushed, and he felt a bit embarrassed. He literally couldn’t stop himself.
He hadn’t imagined it.
“He went to prison for life when Stella was only two, so she has no memory of him,” Mrs. Liu said, addressing the audience and decidedly avoiding eye contact with her daughter. “I was pregnant with Andrew at the time.” Andrew, the best man, looked equally as wrecked. “I decided it was best to protect my children from my own mistakes, and told them from a young age that their father was dead. To me, he is. I condemn my ex-husband’s actions, and had no part in them.”
John swallowed. “I had to. She was an incredible woman.”
Oh, good lord. “Please, John. You haven’t had sex in ages,” he rolled his eyes, the deduction crystallizing upon entering John’s bedroom.
“Mm. Clever boy.”

Don’t worry, I’m going to kill whoever recorded that.
A sniff of sandalwood burnt into the old leather chairs in the sitting room, the pine in John’s shampoo mixed with apricot soap in the bathroom, rosemary and thyme and two-nights-ago curry in the kitchen. Each room was like an aromatic museum of John Watson, like John’s bedroom at 221B concentrated to the nth power. It was like his own personal aphrodisiac scent store, and Sherlock wanted to sniff the place down. In time.
But upon checking into the elaborately decorated lobby for New Year’s, he discovered that Mycroft had booked two separate rooms. However passive aggressive a move on Mycroft’s part, it quieted his anxiety about revealing the source of his foul mood to John while confined in a small space together. He had come too close in the cab.
John’s heart sank hearing the name, the memory of their disappointing breakfast that morning bubbling under the surface of his skin.
They were the loveliest three words he’d ever heard: sure and breathless, with just a trace of
John’s breath came faster, and it only took a few more tight strokes before John’s release.
“Yes. I enjoyed it yesterday.”

Clara’s voice echoes down the hallway into Sherlock’s room. “Oi, are you boys talking about me in there? I’m waiting! I’ve brought croissants!”
“Watsons are annoyingly stubborn, it seems.”
He refused to believe them until John said the words himself, which was never going to happen. Obviously.

would Sherlock go to all that trouble to say hello if he was just going to be an arse?
“My timing must have been perfect. With you secured, Iris and the guard had gone to look for me and Xiaowen back at the exhibit. But-”
He closed his eyes, willing himself not to bring up every horrible time Sherlock had left John out of the loop without
The next morning, John texted Sherlock. He was done resisting; he had spent too much time thinking about the insufferable, temperamental, utterly fantastic genius in the last five years not to confront him after this puzzle.
“Finish it.”
Mary nearly killed him, and Sherlock left him. He didn’t want pity. He wanted his old life back, before everything went sour.  Before he resorted to crossword puzzles to keep him entertained.

“Yes, you are.”
“I…” Sherlock progressed from blinking to opening and closing his mouth with very little sound escaping. “John, I...”
It takes him a minute to acclimate, and when he does, he realizes his mobile is buzzing on the nightstand. Damn thing has probably been going off all night. He rubs his eyes, leans over, and sees it’s Mrs. Hudson. It’s 8am. Better get it, then.
pining has been in the past?”
“I do appreciate it, you know. Your, concern.” John reaches across the seat to rest his hand on top of Sherlock’s, softly rubbing his thumb across the smooth skin over Sherlock’s knuckles. Sherlock looks down at John’s sturdy, tanned hand over his and blinks, but doesn’t make an attempt to move it. John looks back out the window, and doesn’t let go. This is how they are, now.
“But Watson was unknowingly helpful in dispelling my bias. Once I confirmed that Ms. Wallis had been poisoned with arsenic, I remembered that the water in the honeymoon suite wasn’t running yesterday morning. It seemed to be working perfectly fine everywhere else, which told me Diana Wallis’ death was an accident.”

Xiaowen cut in (again, thankfully) to explain that the length of the effects of the tea on the brain varied by the amount consumed and the depth of the steep. So, a few sips would only last for about 10-15 minutes, whereas drinking a full mug may have the consumer truth-telling for two hours (depending on how strong the tea was made).
With the tension rather dissipated between him and John, he popped in his new Airpods (a Christmas gift from Irene) and pressed play on a podcast detailing the murky circumstances surrounding Tchaikovsky’s death. Sherlock already had the case memorized, of course, but it was comforting listening to classical music threaded through a discussion of cholera conspiracy theories. The animated map of the plane route from Heathrow to Taiwan played innocuously on the screen in front of him.
Sherlock crossed the threshold, waving a small, clear bottle, successful. “Don’t worry John, I didn’t disturb-”
The announcement for the arrival at Taipei Main Station played over the speakers, and John stood to bring their carry-ons down from the overhead. A line formed in the centre aisle as Sherlock’s mobile buzzed. It was Mycroft.
Mrs. Hudson greets them both with kisses. “Oh, John. It’s good to see you up and about. I’ve been so worried.” She takes Rosie into her arms, who coos “Huddy!” in delight. “Poor thing, she’s had so much loss in her life already. She’s a strong little thing, though, just like her Daddies.”
John got to work lighting a fire in the sitting room fireplace. It was his routine; he was comfortable in the tacit knowledge of the process, handling the pieces of firewood with ease and familiarity. This was his life, and it was rather unbelievable that Sherlock was suddenly, once again, a part of it in a major way. He sank into the leather sectional like he’d always belonged there, laying out long, unabashedly watching John’s hands work with competence, thinking about the way they were going to handle his body. His erection had faded from their tryst outside between using the loo to wash up and getting the quick tour, but he could feel himself getting hard again, seeing John’s fingers trace down the wood and expertly set the kindling before rubbing the head of the match down the side of the matchbox to catch a flame.

“Mycroft Holmes got in touch with me this morning.”
Oh, perfect. Even Sherlock, who’d never once expressed interest in being John’s matchmaker, was privy to the Jacqueline setup scheme. To his
Everything went dark for a short moment, then suddenly: soft purple light in the window, reflecting off hanging light features. Fragrance of basil, oregano, roasted tomato, truffle oil. Soft murmurs of dining conversation. A candle on the table. He was in a perfect recreation of Angelo’s. Or, what Angelo’s used to be- the restaurant closed down a few years ago, when Angelo moved back to Italy to be with his family.
The third wave of self-consciousness of the morning swept over him. “Ta, yeah. Just a bit of fun, I suppose.” It was unbearably awkward. He sat, and the slightest rosiness colored Sherlock’s cheeks. He took a sip of tea, and John scolded himself for being mesmerized by the slight bounce of Sherlock’s bottom lip when the cup pulled away.
Stella cocked her head in an unspoken question, her fringe tilting to the side under her beanie.
Running his fingers down the textured, worn pages of his journal, thick with paper cutouts, John mourned for all the time he’d loved Sherlock without doing anything but write about him. These were his love letters to the man- his infatuation, then his devotion, then his love, then his loss- crystallized. He put Sherlock into every word he wrote. Wasn’t that love?
“Or burn it,” Sherlock suggested, pressing his lips to John’s neck.
“What if I wanted...something more?” John braced against the island and, gathering his strength, looked up at Sherlock. John could feel his heartbeat through his throat, and he was genuinely afraid he might vomit on Sherlock’s (spectacularly soft, inviting) jumper if the man rejected him.
He watched Mycroft leave, noticing the extra 2 seconds it took him to get down the stairs. Age was slowing him down.
with Sherlock in his arms, but it won’t bring Harry back. He feels a pang of loss in his stomach. It’s dulled by the sex-fueled serotonin coursing through him, but still there. He hugs Sherlock tighter.
His phone vibrates.
Sherlock bites his lip, hard. “
He ran to the loo, ignoring the annoyed stares as he wandered through the maze of tables. He looked at himself in the mirror, and tried to see himself through Sherlock’s eyes. He saw a man who abandoned him. He saw a coward. He saw a man with a tea stain on his shirt and bags under his eyes and wrinkles in his forehead. Shit. He splashed some water on his face.
Sherlock shifts next to him. “That’s exactly the problem, John. I don’t trust that you were in the right frame of mind.” He turns to look at John, who sees worry, and fear, and sadness, and a sliver of hope in Sherlock’s features. “How can I know how much of it you meant? I’m inclined to think you were desperate for any sort of human contact: an emotional and physical release after a traumatic event. And if that is the case, I was happy to give that to you. It doesn’t need to happen again.” Sherlock gets up and goes to sit in his own chair, across from John, his hard exterior back on.
The instant the words are said, John knows he doesn’t want it. He doesn’t want to live in Harry’s shadow. He could sell it, rent it-
When they pulled apart, Rosie was looking at the ground, trying to give them space in this vulnerable moment, but John wanted anything but. He gestured for her to give him a hug, and she happily pulled Stella, Sherlock, and John into a big cuddle in the middle of the dining room.
Defensive. There had been a slim chance that John already knew about the nurse’s girlfriend, but this response confirmed his suspicions to the contrary. John Watson was a puzzle to him in many ways, but in others, he was so completely obvious.

Sherlock looks thoughtful. “So are you.”
“You grew up so fast,” he whispered into her hair, planting a kiss on the top of her head.
“Ta,” John whispers, his voice low and breathy. Sherlock swallows.
“Sherlock asked me to come with him. For a case.” John was staring pointedly into the empty cup, avoiding looking at her directly, as if that would stop the truth from pouring out of him.
“Oh,” a complicated thread of emotions crossed John’s face as the word passed his lips: confusion, interest, excitement, sadness, anger, self-doubt. Sherlock waited for a verbal acknowledgement of any of them, but all John said was, “Right.”
, John. That insufferable squawking outside. ‘Puffinus puffinus’- the scientific name of the Manx shearwater.”
John raised a brow and continued to chew. “Yeah?”
John bounds up the stairs, eager for this fight. “Well?” He turns to Sherlock, eyes wide. “What’d you think of my speech?”
John thrusts once, and drowns in the pure pleasure of it. Sherlock lifts one arm to tug at his own curls, and brings the other hand to touch his cock. John can tell he’s lost in it, too. He thrusts again, and again, and Sherlock starts to push back against him, more forcefully now.
ABBA has been releasing new music and I am wayyyy too excited for the full album. As always, you can find me on tumblr @disfictional!
“You fell asleep,” John said, incredulous. His hair was a mess, bending against his usual part and sticking up in places it shouldn’t. Sherlock ached to run his fingers through it, to mess it up even further. But- oh. Yes. That’s how it got that way.
New spirit has arrived
John looked away. He knew exactly how she felt.
Sherlock and John barely made it three steps into the hotel lobby before Watson came jogging up in a wedding dress like some distressed character in one of those tedious British dramas to stop them from leaving, all flushed cheeks and messed lipstick. She’d just been snogging Stella on the dance floor, clearly.
“Too busy thinking about you,” he murmured into Sherlock’s ear, coming behind him to slide off his suit jacket. Sherlock let him. He started working on the rest of his own buttons, but John stopped him. “Please. Let me. I’ve been thinking about undressing you for years now.”
It was minutes before Diana Wallis was declared dead on the scene.
She took Stella’s hand and led her over. “Hey, Dad.”
Her annoyance was quelled a bit when the train bell rang, and the bright red vehicle started chugging its way through pine and cypress like a toy train under a Christmas tree.
John licked his lips, and Sherlock had to pull his eyes away from the new wetness there. “Okay,” he conceded, “Bathroom then.”
He steadied himself against the counter, and he must’ve seen the bolt of understanding light up in her face, because his voice was soft as he asked, “What has Stella told you about her father?”

Sherlock gave John a pointed look, his eyes devouring John’s body and landing on his crotch. It was softening, now, but still resting heavily over his bollocks. It was delicious.  “Obviously not.”
That night, John’s restless sleep was plagued by the string of letters and numbers from the message dancing in his mind, contorting themselves into shapes of memories.
Sherlock tried to compose himself, closing his eyes, taking a shaky breath. This was John. He loved him. He was the one person who mattered. But that was just it- he mattered so much, Sherlock couldn’t afford for this to go wrong.
“That’s good, John. That’s really good.”
“Come inside me, John,” Sherlock says. It’s all the encouragement John needs. An intense wave of arousal courses through him, and after a few well-placed thrusts, he comes in one long release, falling on top of Sherlock’s chest.

Sherlock pushed himself off of the counter and stood back up to his full height. He gave John a pitying look that touched a nerve. John sniffed. “Molly Hooper saw you fawning over him in a pub. I decided to do my own research.” John cringed to think about what this “research” might have been. John remembered that night- it was one of the very few times he had actually gone outside of his flat with George. He thought he had only imagined he had seen Molly. He had been quite plastered, after all.
“好了(Hǎole)!” Xiaowen’s father called from inside. Lunch was ready.
She smiled. She wouldn’t ever forget. Her phone was her heart, now. Dad was in it.
John rested one hand on Sherlock’s leg while he drove through empty streets outside of Douglas, absently stroking his thigh with his thumb, grounding Sherlock in reality as his thoughts spiraled into a nervous whirlpool of what was to come.
“Oh Lord. It really is the man. Molly, I agree that the radiologic technologist is easy on the eyes, but he is beneath you by nearly every measure.”
He took a deep breath, and turned to face Sherlock, eyes red and glistening around the edges. “I’m sorry, Sherlock. I want you in my life as long as I can have you. If you can’t tell, I’m a right
Molly’s replies to Sherlock’s texts about a corpse experiment, perhaps
“I’m not sure that’s relevant.”
John nodded, knowing he was losing this battle. Sherlock gritted his teeth, knowing he could have coaxed more information out of her. “Porcelain,” John said, and Iris’s body language expressed the confusion Sherlock felt at the response. But Sherlock’s confusion was instantly replaced with pride as he realized what it was: a codeword. John instantly reached for the gun looming by his ear, grabbing it with stunning efficiency and turning it onto the security guard as a figure who appeared to be Xiaowen ran across the room and stuck something into Iris’s shoulder. She collapsed onto the desk, unconscious.

It was wrong and confusing and overwhelming, but John’s hands
Sherlock looms over him on the side of the bed and brings a finger to his top button. When he speaks, his voice is deep and breathless. “Touch yourself.” John doesn’t need to be told twice. He reaches for the lube and puts a small amount on his fingers. Jesus, even his own hand on his cock feels bloody fantastic right now. He pulls, slow and languid. Sherlock groans at the sight.
And suddenly, with no understanding of how or when they made it there, the two of them were in the stairwell of 221B, Sherlock’s tongue in John’s mouth.
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
“Xiaowen, who would be after the tea you were supposed to deliver on December 26th?” Sherlock asked, eager to solve this case (for John’s sake, mostly- he’d be wanting this wrapped up to get back to Rosie. Sherlock would face Grumpy John at 4 days and possibly Angry John at 5).
“How did you and Amy meet?” Sherlock asked, partly curious, but more hoping to find out how much of a threat she potentially posed.
“She loved a Watson even when Harry decided not to be with her. Even when Clara couldn’t help Harry help herself.”
“Yes, John. You need to sleep. You’re delirious, grieving, and going through withdrawal.” He attempts to move John’s arm, but it stays firm.
“No?”
He hadn’t eaten since the night before, and he was, in fact, hungry, though that wasn’t entirely the reason he found himself at a casual kebab joint sitting across from Rosamund Watson.
John can feel Sherlock’s smile against his skin. “Oh, believe me, John, I want.” He emphasizes this with a well-aimed thrust.
“Ready, Dad?” she asked, taking his hand.
“Hang on,” Sherlock walked to the kitchen and shuffled around in the cabinet for a minute before pulling out a dog bowl, easily flipping it in the air, and handing it to John. He was about to ask why Sherlock had one of these, when he read the name on the front.
On the phone, Mycroft was doing most of the talking, as always.
John tilted his head in question.
He nodded in response, holding up the ribbons he had been cutting for the centrepieces.
cooking, John. Anyone with access to Youtube can learn the art,” but even as Sherlock was speaking, he took a loaf of freshly baked sourdough smelling of rosemary out of the oven.
“My dad is in love with you!” she yelled, and it was so desperate, so broken, Sherlock couldn’t retaliate.
“I want to,” John interrupted, stubbornly determined. “I want to be able to give this to you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He eyed Mycroft suspiciously. “You’re encouraging me. What’s it to you?”
“Husband,” John agreed, shaping his lips into a smile.
“Now take it off.” Sherlock does. The scar on his chest hits John with the same amount of force as before. That’s going to take getting used to. Sherlock moves to cover himself with his arms, but John stops him.
After a bit of heated snogging, John takes Rosie back to the flat he’s renting (not “home” anymore, but was it ever?) to shower, give Rosie a bath, make lunch, and gather some clothes and more of Rosie’s things, toys, and books to take back to 221B.
Sherlock drops his voice so it’s low and teasing. “I want you to touch me everywhere, John. I want your tight, strong hands rubbing my chest, stroking my cock, gripping my hips, pulling them onto you as you fuck me.”
He looked up at the ceiling, contemplating the years they had ahead of them. Would every night be like this one? Doubtful (this night would be rather unbeatable, but he had a feeling they’d give it a run). Every night he’d spent alone in the last twenty years taught him that every subsequent night spent with John next to him would be infinitely better.
John resents this. He leans forward, aching to reach across the space between them. “Sherlock, I regret how it happened.” Even in the darkness of the room, Sherlock’s face hidden from the light of the window, John sees his entire being shrink. He rushes to clarify, “But I don’t regret
“He gave me a ride,” Molly clarified, her voice getting higher when Mycroft turned his calculating gaze onto her. Peak tourist season- flights to the Isle were probably booked for the next few weeks. Mycroft must have leant her use of the jet. “It was awfully nice of him, Sherlock.”
Footsteps approached outside. Mycroft’s contacts. He quickly rifled through the desk drawer to confiscate the remaining truth tea from Iris’s (now open) compartment and pocketed it.
As Watson snuck back into the reception hall, a distant wave of dance music drifted into the lobby. He and John lingered at the hotel desk, the question of
Mycroft looked down at his umbrella, using the tip to nudge the speck of dust off his shoes. They probably cost as much as Watson’s wedding banquet. “It’s of no consequence to me. You’ve already made up your mind. Far be it from my realm of influence to stop you.”
Clara laughs. “You could call it that. Doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate an attractive human.”
John didn’t speak until he secured the piece of tape over the gauze.
like that.”
Above it, there are two ticks:
“I guess we’re lucky he’s here, then. Dead people are his specialty. Stella, this is--”
God, no. That would be a bombshell. He’d only ever dated women, after all, and Rosie knew she had a mum. She had no reason to suspect he’d had a foot in the closet all these years.
Sherlock smiled to himself as he stood, though the smile felt foreign on his face, distant. “There’s a reason my brother calls himself ‘M’,” he said, attempting a joke. It fell flat.

The driver was an older gentleman in an American baseball cap, in stark contrast with the rest of the luxury vehicle. The man nodded to acknowledge John’s presence, but kept quiet the entire ride. John was grateful for it. His mind was preoccupied thinking about how many ways this meeting could go. And soon, London was behind him, shrouded in grey clouds. Earl settled herself into the comfortable leather seat beside him.
John inched closer to Sherlock, leaning over his arm to read the information Mycroft sent. “Sherlock, look. ‘She recently faced backlash for consulting on a film with blaring historical inaccuracies.’ Could that be some sort of motive?”
