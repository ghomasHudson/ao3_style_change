“And I, you,” Andrea replied with a watery smile.
“Don’t wait to tell her,” Dean said to the steering wheel and pushed Baby to go a little bit faster, Sam typing away beside him.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas deadpanned.
Cas studied his face for a moment before he nodded and relaxed back into Dean’s embrace.
John had stood at the door to their barracks berating and questioning them, his eyes flicking back and forth between the hovel that was their home and Novak’s lean-to outside all without actually looking
Dean moved back to the house and took his place in the doorway opposite the other Were.
“Yeah. That’s mine and that’s Charlie's,” Dean grit his teeth, pointing to his bunk and then the one across from it. Sure there was barely enough room for three adults to stand up at the same time, but it was all that they had to call home.
Dean bared his teeth and saw the rest of his Pack follow suit. “And you think you’re going to stop us?”
“John! Do we have an understanding?” Dean growled.
“Welcome to Babylon,” Gabriel crowed, bringing Dean’s attention back to the front. He had come to a stop in the entranceway of the cavern, trying to take in all of the activity. The guards nudged him forward with their guns and he resumed walking, Castiel’s shoulder bumping into his.
“Now, Chief Medical Officer Bevell, in your expert opinion, do you think a tranquillizer strong enough to keep a Were down would kill an average human female?” Dean asked conversationally. Bevell began to thrash even more, her fingernails scratching at Dean’s skin and her feet kicking at his legs. She would not get away. “How much do you think you would need to overdose?”
“Nope. There’s no exit from this room, this lot isn’t going anywhere. So you might as well stand outside and leave us be.”
Is that not what you have led me to believe?”
Charlie turned to face him, baring her teeth and growling. “I don’t believe we’ve met.”
“You were meant to,” Dean said with a grin, enjoying Cas’s laughter as Ash wrote down some numbers and took the cuff off.
“Piss off,” Dean said with a laugh, but walked back towards the barracks with her.
Charlie glanced over her comic at him. “Benny will be fine.”
She looked at him, hate in her eyes, as her white fur—speckled with his blood—was slowly dyed red from her own haemorrhaging body. She struggled to snarl and to shift, but Dean didn’t wait to see if she succeeded, or healed, or succumbed to her wounds. He didn’t wait to see if another Were came to her rescue or if she was put down by a passing soldier. It didn’t matter. He didn’t care.
“I know the answer to that question,” Bela said with an unimpressed sniff.
“Good girl. You have everything we need?” Lucifer continued, ignoring the snarling Pack in front of him as if their presence was inconsequential.
“Why do you always put us out front then,” Dean snarked, “if not to fight for you?”
Sam nodded once, seemingly satisfied.
Dean wheezed and whined, trying to catch his breath, waiting for the puncture wounds to heal on his neck. He needed to get up. He needed to catch Lucifer! But he couldn't move. Not yet. Then a stunning black wolf with vibrant blue eyes leapt over him and charged after the helicopter.
Sam’s face immediately went red while Eileen just watched curiously. Seconds later a larger sandy-coloured wolf and smaller red one were standing where Dean and Charlie had been, rubbing up against each other and moving back over to the blankets. The recognition in Cas’s eyes made Dean happy, and a moment later a large black wolf joined them in the blankets. Cas curled up around Dean and began to groom him. His rough tongue cleaning Dean’s fur and pushing away his stress. Seconds later Sam and Eileen joined them, Sam having grown into a wolf nearly as large as Cas, and Eileen into a mid-sized grey wolf. They watched for a moment just on the edge of the blanket before Sam caved and crawled over, nuzzling Dean and then Charlie before getting comfortable. He whined to Eileen and she moved onto the blanket as well. Dean pressed his forehead against Eileen’s when she came up to him, welcoming her. She made a small noise of happiness before she curled up with them as well. There was some initial shuffling but once everyone had sorted themselves out, Dean watched as the stress slowly started to drain out of his Packmates as they relaxed. He could feel the bonds of their Pack strengthening and becoming whole. Dean brushed his tongue down Charlie’s back in thanks. She rumbled back at him without opening her eyes.
At least the Humans had no idea their pairing was odd. It was one of the reasons they had chosen this area in particular, it boasted about its low Were population as a perk. They had probably only been allowed to move in because the military had gotten involved on their behalf.
“Winchester and Bradbury reporting in, Sir!” Dean stepped into the aid station with Charlie at his side. Novak had followed behind them, close enough that they could be mistaken for a group but far enough away that Dean couldn’t reach out and touch him. The aid station was one of Dean’s least favourite places on base, mostly because of the underlying scent of sickness and death that no amount of sterilization and antiseptic wipes could get rid of.
They were also good at what they did. They balanced each other out perfectly and made a great team—something he had known for weeks. And now they had a plan—a way forward.
Dean closed his eyes for a moment. They’d had this conversation before, but the reality of it hadn’t changed. He wouldn’t be
Cas’s tongue was thrusting into him the way Dean wanted—no, needed—his dick to be. He didn’t have to see to know that Cas had opened his own pants and was jacking off to the same rhythm he tongue-fucked Dean with. Their combined scent was overwhelming, filled with lust and love and urgency. Cas moaned into Dean’s ass and Dean’s cock twitched in interest. Shit. The desire to be filled was growing ever stronger.
Dean plastered a smile on his face as he chatted with everyone at the table. He wasn’t going to be the buzzkill that ruined this for everyone. Normally Sam would be all over him about it, seeing through his mask, but tonight his brother only had eyes for Eileen who practically glowed with happiness at his side.
“It’s not like you gave me a fuckin’ chance, you asshole,” Dean snarled and finished the drink, ruthlessly shoving down his desire to smash the bottle into a million tiny pieces. He wasn’t going to cause a mess for Jody and the girls to clean up, and he certainly was in no state to deal with broken glass.
“Sir!” they said in unison, quickly straightening up.
Do you know that Jack’s become the new Chuck? Can’t even say it’s the weirdest thing that’s happened to us.” Dean sighed and took another swallow of beer. “One moment he’s our kid, the next, this unknowable omnipotent being.
Sometime later, Dean pulled Cas into the house and shut the door behind them. The moment the door closed, Sam, Jody, Donna and the girls exploded in cheers and applause, showering them with hugs and affection.
“Dean,” Novak sighed.
Eileen nodded and immediately got up to do just that. There was no arguing, no complaining, just no-nonsense acceptance and practicality. Within twenty minutes they had everything they needed packed into two duffle bags.
Lilith’s smile was all teeth.
“Welcome to the military, Sam,” Charlie smiled.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No. We’ve already informed your office that you won’t be going into work today.”
“Uhh…sorry? To be fair there hasn’t been a lot of time…” Dean managed to grumble out.
Dean felt the ground disappear under his feet as his stomach lurched. Lucifer wanted to watch him kill his own father. Bastard. Dean locked eyes with John. Dean hated him with righteous fury, but it wasn’t enough, and everyone knew it. Dean refocused on Lucifer, not shying away from his ice-cold gaze. “I do not wish to kill him.”
Sam looked over at Eileen, who looked like she was going to be sick.
Dean laughed humourlessly and covered his face with his other hand.
“Yes sir!” Ketch said and called out, “Ceasefire!”
Sam shrugged. “I have nowhere to be.” He crossed his arms over his chest and glared at Gadreel. It was only half true. If the men outside made a move they’d have to make a run for it, but even if they did, he didn’t know where they would go. He had been betting on house arrest, not kidnapping.
“It’s a complicated scent,” Dean hedged, not wanting to admit that it both repulsed and attracted him. He lifted more debris and found the sniper rifle, banged up, unusable. Definitely of Russian design. Shame, it had been a nice weapon.
It wasn’t until his skin started to itch as if it had been stretched too thin over his human form, that Dean realized what was going on. He shut his eyes for a moment, stopping them just inside the entranceway to the main cavern and tried to breathe. He used his free hand to wipe his brow. He was sweating. When he opened his eyes again there were a number of eyes staring hungrily at him.
“Dean!” Sam’s voice came as his brother came back into the room. Charlie was at his side a heartbeat later, all red-faced as if she had been crying.
“Oh! Yes! That’s right. I come bearing great news!” Gabriel grinned, his eyes sparkling with mischief.
“Because Dean will never stop fighting if we keep him from his mate. I would argue you should take the whole pack to be sure, but you said to just bring the essentials,” Bela explained.
It wasn’t much, but Dean would take anything that wasn’t blatant hatred or total dismissal.
“Hey, Red. It’s me. It’s Zepp. I need you to wake up for me, okay?” He placed his forehead against hers. “I know that it’s hard, but I know you can do it.” He ran his hands through her fur, trying to stimulate the muscles and spread his scent. They did not have long before they’d be discovered. “Please, little wolf, even just shift to your human form so we can get you out of here. I promise I will protect you.”
Dean had taken it without complaint, dropped his stuff in his barracks—notably the farthest one out and the one closest to the latrines—before heading to the Mess to get something to eat. He’d been pleasantly surprised at the amount of meat that they’d served him. Sure, the cooks had taken one look at his partial uniform and scowled, but they’d given him a proper serving anyways.
“It’s nice to finally meet you in person!” Sam exclaimed, his scent filled with happiness. In fact all of them smelled happy at that moment. Dean basked in the joy of his Pack being reunited, a small win he was going to experience in the fullest.
“Hey, Sam. Did you find what I asked for?” Dean asked without preamble when his little brother’s face finally filled the screen.
Dean did his best not to snarl at this thought. It would not be their tomb. Not today, not ever.
Sam was sure his and Eileen’s scents were filled with Alpha-rage, and yet none of their captors even glanced in their direction.
Dean barely heard Ketch’s noise of disgust as he had already made it outside the base, Charlie hot on his heels.
“Yes, Sir.”
The man’s eyes widened significantly when he took in what little they had. “This is ...it?”
“I’ll go with him, Boss-man,” Charlie said. “You
Dean was lost in a haze of lust and friction, his body moving in tandem with Cas’s, thrusting against each other slowly, their arms grasping and running over each other’s bodies. It wasn’t quite the urgent pace they had set earlier, it was something deeper. Cas locked eyes with Dean, his arms tightening around him into an embrace. Dean lost all his words, staring into Cas’s beautiful golden eyes and returned the embrace. This was more than just sex, this was Dean and Cas. This was them. Dean shuddered and whimpered as he felt Cas swell and come inside him once more, locking them together again. Dean grabbed his neglected dick, but Cas pushed his hand aside and jacked him off between them, coating their stomachs in Dean’s spend.
“That’s not what we signed up for!” Garth’s voice joined hers.
Sam had met his neighbour a handful of times since he’d moved in a couple of years back. He was a quiet guy, kept mostly to himself, and hadn’t caused them any trouble about their designations when Eileen had moved in. It had been a relief, honestly, to not have to worry about the person they shared a wall with, especially after all of the passive-aggressive and sometimes fully aggressive way complete strangers sometimes acted around them when they went out in public together.
Dean’s eyes flew open and he all but yelped, shifting into his human form mid-run to put as much distance between them as he could in the confined space. No. No! It couldn’t be. Castiel couldn’t be. Dean despaired.
Novak sighed and ran his hands through his hair. “Lucifer is my brother.”
“Where are we?”
Dean ignored the dismissal and pushed on. She wasn’t going to get her way.
“Poughkeepsie?” Gadreel grimaced, clearly nervous about the outcome of this passcode.
A long moment later, Dean heard someone moving inside, and then the door opened.
He sighed. “I’m sorry. You’re right.” He placed his forehead against hers for a moment, breathing in their scent of a cottage by the sea filled with leather books, before standing tall again. “But you’re worth it, Eileen, and so is Dean.” He turned back to John and did his best to contain his rage within his professional lawyer voice.
Alistair.
“We are not meant to go through mating cycles that often. Our bodies regulate themselves three or four times a year and that’s it,” Ash was explaining when Sam tuned back in.
happens to them, I’m going to hold you
until we become functionally extinct!” Lucifer snarled. “How many of us joined the world’s militaries when our species came out? Almost an entire generation has already been removed from the breeding pool!”
“Ah, don’t mind Bela, she’s just sore she’s away from her favourite luxury coffee shop,” the mullet-wearing man said with a laugh, coming to stand in front of them.
Cas melted into Dean’s embrace and clung to him. “Thank you,” he whispered. They sat quietly together for a while before Cas murmured, “It’s done”.
“Does it really look like we’re a fan of the military at this point?” Dean finally cut in, scowling. “We aren’t going anywhere with them, and we sure as hell aren’t staying here either.”
“Okay, like to redecorate? To hang a nail?”
Sam’s face went red and he pulled away to reach for the Alpha who had been standing beside him.
“Packmaster Winchester, are you going to introduce me to our new guests?” Lucifer purred.
As soon as Dean stepped outside, he immediately identified the hulking brown beast on top of the car as Alistair and the smaller off-white one on the hood as Lilith. Alistair’s rotten egg and decaying flesh scent wasn’t one he would ever forget. Lilith on the other hand, had taken him a moment longer to pinpoint as this was the first time he had been able to get a clean scent off her. The wolf smelled like fire and death and ash, like fire that simmered for years without ever going all the way out, but in a space far too small to contain it, filling the air with poison…she smelled like a pyre! It was an odd scent for an Omega. It lingered in his senses long after it should have dissipated, and Dean forced himself to not bury his nose in Cas’s neck to get rid of it. Dean’s lip curled back in anger when he realized that her designation also explained her interest in Cas.
“Looks like the military found us—time to go,” Cas said, sharing a glance with Dean.
“He’s…He’s
“I’m not sure the better future you see is the same as the one Lucifer sees, Gabriel,” Cas sighed.
“Garth, Jo, have you betrayed us?” Lilith asked conversationally as she led the way through the tunnels. “Lucifer will be very interested to know who the traitors are.”
Dean scowled but took off towards the west as instructed.
“Okay, okay, just give me five minutes, alright? And then we get food.”
“Glad you’re not dead, old man,” Claire sniffed as she stepped back, discretely wiping her eyes. Kaia took her hand and the two of them curled into one another. He was glad to see them together, confident in who they were as people and what they meant to each other. For some reason, these young women had been able to just accept things he’d struggled to get his head around his entire life. Claire deserved this happiness. Deserved to have her loved one beside her after all of the pain and grief she had been dealt in her young life.
Sometime later Dean stood up and stretched, flashing his canines. He nosed the other wolf and took off at a slow walk hoping to entice Castiel into a run. He looked back a few times to see Castiel watching him intently. Dean picked up the pace and trotted away from him before breaking out into a run. The black wolf was up in an instant and soon they were chasing each other across the wilderness in the moonlight.
Instead of submitting, Cas’s eyes flashed gold and he bared his teeth at Dean, enraged. “You won’t leave your asshole father but you’d force me to leave my sweet sister?”
Dean toyed with Cas’s dog tags, running his fingers over the bumps as he had with his own for years. Were. C. Novak. NY. O+. Angel. Cas was a universal donor? The military had never done cross-species transfusions of course, but universal donors were valuable everywhere, especially in hidden cave-dwelling free Were societies, he’d wager. Dean frowned, they would have to be careful about that. “Let’s not broadcast you’re a universal donor, okay?”
Dean kissed Cas’s nose. “Listen up, Lover, we’ve had short, shitty lives, and they ain’t about to get better unless a whole lot of things we can’t control go perfectly, absolutely, right.”
The three Weres remained silent for a moment. Maybe a win was too strong a sentiment just yet.
An indeterminate amount of time later Dean finally gave in and shifted back to his human form. Seconds later a very human, very naked WO Novak sat next to him.
Dean placed the meat in Cas’s mouth and watched as Cas closed his lips around the fork. His teeth gently pulling the cube off the prongs and his tongue flicking the tips. Dean’s brain helpfully supplied him with images of what Cas’s mouth looked like wrapped around other things Dean had given him. He stifled a moan and glanced up to Cas’s amused eyes.
“Wait!” Dean snarled before Lilith could follow through.
“We are no threat to you,” Cas said placatingly. “We want our freedom too,” he gestured to the armed guards behind them.
“No, it’s not,” Cas and Ketch said at the same time. Dean and Charlie shared a startled look. How the fuck did Ketch know something John didn’t? He was much further down the hierarchy. What exactly was going on here?
Castiel finally broke his gaze to turn and glare at his brother. “What. Do. You. Want?”
Something or someone was coming. Ash, Sam, Eileen, Garth and Jo stopped immediately, whereas Bela bumped into John on Sam’s back. She nearly squawked but the group’s murderous gaze cut her off before she could complain.
“What I had to.”
“Humvee’s safer.” One of her eyes cracked open to focus on him. Dean smiled down at her. “Welcome back, little wolf.” He brought their foreheads together briefly.
“Dean, can you divest
“No problem. Don’t get dead. Over.” That had been Charlie’s sign off since he had met her three and a half years ago. ‘Don’t get dead.’ Some people would have found it nihilistic, but Dean knew it was the way she reminded everyone to be safe, that she cared, that she was with them instead of just a voice in the clouds. Dean couldn’t imagine his life without her.
Suddenly two hazel eyes were peering into his as Eileen cupped his face in her hands and angled his head down to hers. Their sweet saltwater cottage scent curled around him comfortingly. Sam breathed out deeply and wrapped his arms around his Mate’s waist. He pressed his forehead against hers momentarily before pulling back to look her in the eyes again.
“How long were we…?”
Dean would be killed in action and men would show up with Dean’s effects to tell Sam something he already knew. Maybe even haul him off to war in Dean’s place. Or maybe one day Dean would wake up and just be done, he would walk away, disappear into the night, no note, no plan, just gone. Maybe he would tell Sam, but maybe he wouldn’t. Maybe he would take Charlie with him in that situation. Maybe Dean had convinced himself that Sam was better off without him, and the military wouldn’t go after him if they thought Sam knew nothing. Or maybe one day Dean would show up at his door, and they would have to run.
Dean shifted back into his human form. His Pack stayed as wolves beside him.
On the fourth day after Benny’s death, Dean, Charlie and Novak were finally sent out into the field to try and catch the Were that had attacked.
“We grew up with him! You more than me, you know how treacherous and manipulative he can be! Not to mention how corrupted his scent has become! That alone should have been a warning sign!”
“Don’t be silly. I don’t like any of you.” Bela sniffed and walked back to Sam’s bedside. “But I’ve done the math, and my odds of getting out of this alive are better with you than they are with them.”
Winchester.”
“I told you so,” she purred, facing Dean head-on. “They aren’t coming. They’re with Lucifer, as I said.”
“Sam?” Dean asked stiffly, glancing over again to see tears on his brother’s face.
Cas removed the IV from Charlie’s forearm. “It could be a while before she metabolizes enough of the drug to wake up,” he grimaced. They would not be able to carry her out in this form.
Gabriel nodded urgently.
Lilith flicked her hair blithely and held her ground. “Pass,” she chirped looking at her nails, her scent calm and even. Clearly she expected them to come right back.
It was a well-trod conversation between them, so Dean dropped it and lay down, grabbing his earbuds and phone on the way. Charlie had confirmed a couple of years back that it was the shots that kept all Weres in the military scent-free. She’d even found a schedule of when each group got their monthly injections. She’d said it had something to do with not giving away their ‘advantage’ to the enemy. But Dean wasn’t so sure.
“We intend to! Even that Alpha he’s shacked up with! Unlikely couple, those two. Don’t see a lot of Alpha/Alpha pairings these days.”
“The only lives I’m responsible for are mine, my Mate’s and my Pack’s. And now, apparently, yours. So don’t do anything stupid to jeopardize that.”
“What was that, Lucifer?” Cas growled, his eyes shifting away from Dean to focus on his brother. Dean allowed himself to be pulled back to stand beside Cas, his focus shifting between the man behind the table, and Cas’s hand in his.
As much as Dean hated the man, John didn’t deserve this. No one deserved this. Dean had left his father here, thinking he was safe, thinking he was under Dean’s protection as his prisoner instead of as Lucifer’s. But Dean had been too trusting, too complacent. And now John was paying for Dean’s mistake. Had Alistair acted on Lucifer’s command? Or was this just the twisted actions of a psychopathic Alpha left to his own devices? Did it matter?
Hendrickson looked around, eyeing the corpses and Dean’s Pack. Some of the soldiers fidgeted back and forth nervously—looking equally unsure of how this scene was going to play out—while others were clearly still drunk on the bloodlust of battle, clutching their weapons and grinding their teeth. Hopefully, Hendrickson could keep them in line long enough to let Dean’s Pack escape, otherwise, these soldiers would die too.
Castiel was strong. Really strong. Dean found himself on his back a few times, pinned down by the larger wolf, but Castiel never pressed his advantage, nor forced Dean to submit and so the battle continued. Finally, when they had enough they lay panting companionably beside each other. Dean leaned over and licked Castiel’s muzzle and rubbed their heads together again. Castiel returned his affections and they napped for a time.
“Sam,” John responded, “I see you fool brother got you involved in this mess.”
The four of them stayed silent for a moment before Charlie ducked out down the corridor as they had agreed. Eileen moved to follow her, but Sam grabbed her hand and she nodded, lacing their fingers together. She moved to stand facing him from the side so she could see his mouth as he spoke and also watch for John’s response. This was not Charlie’s fight, but Eileen was his Mate, and they would face whatever life threw at them together. Including one John Winchester.
John gritted his teeth and drove the Humvee to the front gates. A soldier stopped them. It was Captain Ketch.
Dean’s skin was burning, it felt tight and uncomfortable and the need for Cas to fill him again rose within him like an untamed beast. It felt like he was going into heat again. But that was impossible.
Now that his shoulder was back where it belonged, Dean could feel it starting to heal properly—by this time tomorrow he wouldn’t even remember the pain. The feeling of Novak’s hands on his skin or the way he had touched Dean gently—kindly, even—or how he’d shown an impressive amount of skill and strength, however, weren’t things Dean ever thought he’d be able to forget. But there wasn’t enough time in the world to deal with that thought, let alone in the middle of an attack, so he brushed it aside and quickly followed the other Were back outside to the remaining men.
“You’ve both been in the military for far too long, we’ll run tests of course but it’s highly unlikely either of you will ever be able to produce offspring,” Lucifer continued, now looking back at whatever was occupying his attention on the desk.
“We need to free Charlie before she is locked up or shipped out. I expect you have been preparing for that in our absence?” Cas asked, looking back and forth between his brothers. There sure were a lot of Novaks in this room. Dean wrinkled his nose, but then again the ozone and lightning smell of danger wasn’t as strong as it was last time the three of them were together. Now the whiskey and leather scent was just as strong with both him and Cas producing it, along with their mixed Apple Orchard in the Rain smell.
“Look I don’t know this Lucifer guy at all,” Dean cut in, “but the dude killed my packbrother, Benny, and slaughtered Humans like cattle. He keeps exploding shit near me and then drugged and kidnapped me’n Cas. He’s not exactly on my 'people I want to befriend' list, let alone 'people whose word I trust' list. In fact, if I see him again I’m just as likely to rip his throat out with my teeth.”
“So, how’d you end up in a place like this?” Dean asked as Ash started drawing blood.
Cas growled back and rubbed his erection across Dean’s hole again, the head catching on his rim and making them both whine with need. Before Dean could ask again, however, Cas thrust inside in one smooth motion.
“Either way you’re with us now, Bitch.” Charlie snarked, a growl forming in her chest.
“So I hear.”
Finally, Novak looked up at him. “Thank you for telling me. We should return now.”
“There has been enough death here today, don’t you think?” Cas’s voice rumbled, drawing the soldiers attention back to them.
“I’ll be happier if I never hear you use the words 'rut sex' ever again.” Sam winced.
“Underselling it a bit there, Cassie.”
John scoffed. “So unnatural. You know why they keep the whole...” he motioned flippantly with his hand, “second gender thing quiet, right?”
Well, they hadn’t planned on being able to sneak out, but being that transparent wasn’t good. Lucifer still allowed Dean’s Pack to walk around freely, even if he had increased the number of guards watching them. He either thought that they weren’t a threat or that they were but would never find their way out of the caves to do anything about it. Or maybe Dean had it wrong, and Lucifer still thought he could convince them to see his point of view. Or maybe he just didn’t care. Dean scowled. There were still too many unknowns.
“Dodger. Charges set, on my way. Over.” Charlie’s voice came over the coms, lifting a weight off of Dean’s mind. She was safe.
“So I’m asking for us to have something they can’t take away. Something we already knew the moment we scented each other.”
The Major narrowed his eyes and focused on Castiel. “You are POWs turned deserters caught trying to kidnap a soldier, trapped on the inside of a heavily fortified base. I think it is you who doesn’t understand your position.”
“No, I’m not fucking alright, Cas! How could I be okay?!” Dean raged. “This is so fucked up! I can’t even be upset about us because, fuck, that pales in comparison with fucking genocide! And then there’s Charlie, Sam and Eileen’s lives on top of that!”
“Yeah. I know. It’s just…” he tried and then sighed and signed, “I love you.”
Dean pulled away from Cas slightly to glare at the other Omega.
Dean was at odds with himself about letting Jo take point. The closer they got to Cas, the more he felt the urge to shift and run to him. But with her in the lead, they kept moving at a reasonable pace, kept a close eye on their ‘guide’ and were able to look out for the encroaching military presence.
“Gesundheit,” Gabriel said.
The next few moments were chaos as another squad came rushing into the area with the helicopter beating overhead. Medics flooded into the house and immediately went to help the wounded men. Soldiers were shouting orders Dean could only half-hear when Novak got his attention again. He signed <
Dean looked at the group around him, some Pack, some not, but all of them trusting him to lead them through this. He would not put them in any more danger than he absolutely had to.
Novak came to a stop and looked over at Dean. His eyes were filled with sorrow. “My sister. My good, sweet, kind sister.”
They were no demolition experts, and they hadn’t been furnished with enough explosives to do too much damage, but there was definitely enough between the two of them to cause a problem for even their inhuman healing capabilities. They carefully picked their way to the entrance, pausing and watching for movement, before finally stepping inside. Dean’s eyes quickly adjusted. He sighed in relief when he couldn’t see anyone. There was a tunnel near the back of the cave, undoubtedly leading to the rest of the system. There were no signs of habitation, no scrapes or burns or even footprints to suggest it was used at all, let alone used by the number of Weres Dean could still smell.
“Y-you…” Gabriel stuttered, staring at Cas with wide eyes.
“How are you feeling?” Novak asked, his deep blue eyes troubled.
Dean waited until Hendrickson had moved to the other side of the watch box. Apparently, it was Britney Spears night as he hummed pop tune after pop tune. Dean gracefully jumped the fence and landed quietly on the other side. He paused, listening for the sound of an alarm or the other Were heading off to rat him out. Nothing. Within three strides he had shifted into his wolf form as easily as breathing. That was one good thing about this godforsaken place; the opportunity and ability to shift often, sometimes even for work. It had become easy, habitual. Not like when he had lived in the city, surrounded by concrete and tall buildings. The parks, as infrequent as they were, were not really large enough for him to get a full run in. It had taken a lot more time and a lot more pain for him to shift before he had moved here.
Pack and as...helpful as your pack has been to us, he still belongs to
Gadreel’s shocked face might have been entertaining had Sam’s thoughts not already been preoccupied with his need for immediate action and wondering which scenario had led Dean to use their emergency passcode. He certainly hadn’t expected Gadreel to come back with it. He didn’t know what he had expected, but it surely wasn’t this. Had Dean given the password freely? Sam hoped so, as he was betting his and Eileen’s lives on that being true.
“But why?” Cas asked, staring off into space. “I can believe a lot of things about Father, but wanting to exterminate our species isn’t one of them.”
“Ah. Thank fuck.” Dean sighed in relief, dropping his head to the steering wheel for a moment. At least one of them would get their happy ending. He raised his head and shot his brother a smile. “Where is she? We’ll go pick her up.”
Dean attacked Lucifer from behind, sinking his teeth into the white wolf’s right flank. The massive wolf snarled and threw him off as Cas came at Lucifer from the other side. The first time Dean had seen Lucifer’s massive wolf form, he had shuddered in fear, but now the shiny white fur was matted red with blood, and Lucifer’s burned forest after a storm scent was filled with pain and anger. There would be no smug win for him today, no victory howl. He was alone. And lone wolves don’t survive.
Dean moved over to his brother pulling his brother’s head down so their foreheads touched. “It’s not your fault. I gave them the passcode on purpose. You weren’t any safer where you were, so I’m good with the decision I made—because if we’re going to be in danger at least this way we can face it together.” Dean pulled back to make eye contact with his brother before reaching out for the others.
He would have to worry about that later, he had to get Charlie first. She was in even more danger now that Sam had disappeared as well.
“How do you know it will be a better future?” Eileen pressed.
Sam got out one “But Dean!” before he quieted down. Cas stepped forward to match him and took his hand. Either way, they needed more information than they had now. They needed an exit and they needed a plan. And they needed to be fully rested or they’d never be able to put anything into action. At least they were together now, and while they weren’t free, their movement wasn’t as restricted as it could be and they needed to make the most of it.
Dean could smell the worry coming off of Cas and looked up to see it mirrored on his face.
“Yes, yes, we are prepared to take the base,” Lucifer said dismissively.
“Then why are we the main target? And not her?” Dean snarled.
“Lead on before I kill you now and we find them on our own,” Jo snarled, coming up to press her rifle in between the Omega’s bare shoulder blades. Dean made eye contact with Jo over Lilith’s head and nodded. Jo was now on ‘Lilith Duty’.
Dean rolled his eyes at her before taking the opportunity to look over everyone else. Sam was grinning, clearly enamoured with the way his mate had dealt with the situation, and with Dean. “Is everyone okay?” Ash had been grazed by another bullet but just shrugged, wiping the blood off his already healed skin. Everyone else nodded and Dean looked each of them in the eyes in turn, making sure.
“Yeah, not all of us are slaves!” Dean replied.
“Hendrickson,” he coughed out.
Once back in their cave, the guard said something about grabbing them some food and water before she disappeared back down the tunnel. Dean hadn’t paid her any attention, nor anyone else that Cas had snarled at on their way here—not with Cas holding his hand. And now that they had stopped, Dean immediately wrapped himself around Cas, rubbing against him obscenely.
“Fuck no.”
Sam sat at his kitchen table, laptop open in front of him, his girlfriend—no, his Mate—by his side, anxiously awaiting his brother on Skype. It was the right date and time, (the computer clock said 7:01 P.M.), so it was only a matter of time now. Sometimes it took a little bit longer for Dean to log on for various reasons. Sometimes someone else ran late with their call or Dean had to run from the other side of the base to get there, or sometimes the internet was just spotty that far out. Occasionally he even brought Charlie or Benny with him to chat with Sam, normally the week after Sam had been particularly hard on him about something. Regardless, his brother had never missed one of their calls. Not once in four years. His computer hit five after and he couldn’t help but bounce one of his knees in anticipation. He really wanted to introduce Eileen to Dean. They were all family now, after all. He hoped that his brother would be supportive, no, he knew that he would be. Dean was always supportive of whatever he was into, from the very beginning.
“We’ll make do.” Cas kissed him chastely before pulling back to look into his eyes. Dean watched as Cas started to regulate his breathing and slowly force himself to relax. It was extremely impressive to watch Cas go from tight and anxious to soft and pliant in his arms.
“This is so cool! Who would have thought my big bad Packmaster was an Omega who smells like apple pie?” Charlie cooed.
Donna stepped back and then Claire was in his arms. Apparently being cool and aloof was not on the agenda for today. He hugged the young woman tightly, placing a kiss on her head. He didn’t know how or when he started thinking of her as his kid—or maybe kid sister—but it had happened, independently from… But he had, and he was grateful. He was even more grateful for the fact that she was here, alive, in his arms. With a world where free will reigned once again. A world where kids like Claire could choose to live a good life—a normal life—free from the pain of hunting if she wanted. One where she had all the potential in the world and the ability to choose her own fate. If Dean could pick, it would be a life where she’d never be on a first-name basis with Death. But that was for Claire to choose, and he would never take away her right to choose it. He looked up and made eye contact with Jody over Claire’s head. She smiled sadly at him. They’d told Claire then, that—that not everyone had made it.
“Your turn,” Cas said quietly, his eyes now watching the room instead of his empty plate. Dean felt a rush of warmth and gratitude for his Mate—his partner, now in life and in battle—and dug into his food, knowing he was safe to do so while Cas was on watch.
Before he could even get a word out, his vision was filled with blue eyes, dark messy hair, and that stupid ill-fitting tan trenchcoat.
“It’s so good to see you!”
“Welcome to the Pack, Ash.”
“Could’ve fooled me,” Dean snarked, gesturing to the lab around them.
“Thank you,” she murmured and stepped back, wiping her eyes. “Thank you for being there for him when I could not. For…for being a good Packmaster.”
“Can’t argue with that logic.” Dean grinned.
“Every time?”
“Hendrickson,” Dean nodded in greeting to the soldier in the bed across from him with an IV in his arm.
“Couldn’t have said it better myself, Red,” Dean replied with a smile, wrapping his arm around Cas. “We believe in hugs in this Pack. Hope you’re okay with that.”
“Why are you such a bitch?” Charlie snarled. “You know what, never mind. You’re not important enough for me to bother with.”
“I don’t even know why she thought I was a threat. I didn’t want—and I still don’t want—to control the Novak family. I am honestly grateful to be away from them.” Cas looked at Dean and Dean nodded encouragingly back at him.
“Ugh. I think I’ll pass if this is what the food’s like.” Sam took another large bite of the ration bar and grimaced as he chewed and swallowed it down.
Ash immediately came over and helped her hold his arm in position before they snapped the bone back in place. Dean howled in pain before ripping his arm away from them.
Sam’s arms were full with John, so Eileen lifted his shirt to check the closing wound before she grabbed his arm roughly. Dean snarled in pain and spat out, “We don’t have time for this!”
“Not a thing.”
Dean shook his head with a grin. Cas had totally missed the point, and Dean loved him for it. “I can’t take you anywhere, can I?”
“We were hostages before we ever set foot in this cave!” Dean snarled, baring his teeth at his father. “Sam was practically under house arrest for the last four years!”
“Yes.”
John Winchester.
“Oh...you mean like toothpaste and velcro!” Sam exclaimed.
Dean couldn’t help but sniff the air again, and Castiel’s rich ozone and lightning, the forest after a storm scent washed over him. Comforting him, beckoning him. Telling him he was safe. It was everything he ever wanted, everything he ever needed. “You’re a fucking liar, Castiel.”
Before Charlie could answer, the entire cave system shook and there was a large booming noise followed by a sprinkling of rock dust on their heads. Dean was up and out of the bed in an instant, Cas at his side a second later in case he fell. Everyone stood silent, eyes wary, waiting.
“Yeah.”
“Yes,” Dean raised an eyebrow. “Haven’t you heard? We’re animals not worthy of such luxuries as gender propriety.”
“Eileen?” Sam said, gesturing for her to join him on the bed. She sat down beside him and put her head on his shoulder, and closed her eyes. Sam wrapped an arm around her and hugged her to him.
Then suddenly they were alone in a random cave, and as if by magic, Dean appeared before him, alive, whole, and mated to Castiel Novak.
evil, and Dean tentatively put him on the “to save” list in his brain. It had been years since he had been responsible for more than a couple of people, but here he was, already up to about a dozen people in his mind that he felt a desire to protect, Pack or not. Granted most of those were kids he had seen running around this place, that needed to be protected if this all went to hell in a handbasket, but Hannah had also made it on the list for Cas’s sake, while Gabriel was still a toss-up.
“What is it Sam?” Eileen asked
Dean drifted, feeling safe and blissfully happy for what felt like the first time in his life. He snuggled into the warmth and comfort around him, trying to cover himself in the intoxicating scent of ozone, lightning and the forest after the storm. It was clean and pure and perfect. It made his heart sing. His mind supplied him with images to go with this potent new scent; of a large wolf—both familiar and unfamiliar—at his side grooming him, taking care of him, protecting him. Showering him with love, affection and kindness. Dean relaxed further. There was no need to worry here, no troubles, no war and no fear.
Dean shuddered with loathing and shook his head, trying to clear it of the many images of torture and rape his mind had conjured. No. He felt Sam’s shoulder brush against his, and he glanced at his brother, Sam’s face was filled with revulsion and despair, but he never looked away from the carnage in front of them, his gun up and levelled at Alistair’s head. His brother’s breathing was slow and steady and Dean let it calm him, taking a deep breath in to match, and then focusing the way Cas had shown him. Bela, Ash, Garth and Jo were all staring in disgust, their weapons all but forgotten in their hands.
“I promise to come back to you,” Cas said simply.
Cas took his hands and all of Dean’s focus snapped to where they were touching. It didn’t matter that they had spent four days wrapped up in each other, Dean still flushed at the rush of electricity between them that skin-on-skin contact created.
“Shhh, I’ve got you.”
But it was a big deal. It was a big deal for all of them.
“What the hell does that mean, Gabriel?” Cas growled. “You think you’re going to lead?”
that Charlie is still alive!” Dean snarled back.
“You were watching us?” Cas growled, his hand tightening around Dean’s.
“Maybe. Over.” Dean took a deep breath, pulling in as many scents as he could. He could smell all ten of the heavily armoured Humans behind him. They were familiar but uninteresting. He could smell rotting garbage, old faeces from pests, pets and people alike. He could smell gasoline and motor oil, dust and smoke.
Castiel hadn’t yet shifted back into his wolf form after Hannah’s last visit when Dean finally called out to him.
Hannah stepped out of the shadows pointing a pistol at Cas’s head. “We don’t need to fight. Just come peacefully!”
Despite Dean’s reluctance to become emotionally or mentally connected to anyone else, it hadn’t taken much time after that for them to become Pack. And they’d been watching each other’s backs ever since.
Dean smiled and ducked his head  “I understand. I’m sorry I worried you. It won’t happen again. Er…well, I will have sex with Cas again, and I will go into heat again at some point, naturally, yes…but not the dangerous brain-boiling kind. Right, Doc?”
Dean started the day pointedly ignoring the fact that Novak had partially constructed a lean-to against Charlie and Dean’s barracks. It wasn’t going to keep the sand out of his bedroll, but it would help with the sun. He could feel the other Were’s eyes on his back as he walked to the Mess but didn’t turn around once.
“Er…thanks, Ash,” Dean said, still trying to wrap his mind around what had just happened. He was grateful that Ash had been nearby when it happened. No doubt his quick thinking had saved Dean’s life.
It was hard to see the worry in Cas’s eyes and feel the sudden tension in his body. Was Cas thinking he’d have to compete with the memory of a dead lover?
“Zeppelin, Angel!” Charlie’s voice crackled in his ear. “Either of you getting anything yet? Over.”
Dean blinked a few times, trying to process what Ash was saying. There was a chance he would never be able to touch Cas again without going into a heat so strong it’d boil his brain? That without Sammy he would have died? That he still could? His stomach lurched and he barely kept himself from throwing up. “That’s…great.”
Dean was twenty-one years old when the world changed.
Cas hesitated again but pressed the heel of his hand against the swelling in his pants. “I don’t want to take advantage, you’re not…in your right mind.”
Charlie dropped down off the supplies barefoot without a sound. She wrapped her arms around Dean’s mid-section and they held onto each other. Benny got up from the bench press and rested his forehead against Dean’s, wrapping his arms around both of them.
Dean’s step faltered when the overwhelming scent of the pack ahead hit him. It was even stronger than it had been outside, his mental scent map was swiftly becoming completely and utterly covered. It left him effectively scent-blind. Castiel looked over at him in concern, but Dean shook his head slightly and continued moving forward. He was going to have to get used to it, and quickly if they were going to survive. Castiel bumped his hand against Dean’s between them and Dean nodded and bumped him back, the corners of his mouth turned up in a small smile. They’d definitely revisit this non-verbal hand holding conversation
“So we treat it like a mission. We do reconnaissance on this place tonight and see what Lucifer has for us tomorrow. He seemed pretty confident that he could get Charlie, so let’s assume she’s back on base. We can’t grab her without Sam and Eileen already being in the wind or it will put her in more danger.”
At the last moment, Charlie called back to the Pack, “Don’t get dead!”
“How long did it take after the shots wore off before you opened your legs for Novak? Minutes? Hours?”
Dean rested his forehead against Cas’s. For a moment their hearts raced and they panted, trying to catch their breath. Dean finally pulled back to look at Cas. He was covered in dried come and slick and spit. It was in his hair and on his face and yet, no matter how disgusting he was—they were—right now, Cas was still the most beautiful thing Dean had ever seen.
When they were done, his bunk was standard military issue. Blank and boring, and everything that was Corporal Benny Lafitte fit into one small cardboard box.
“You fucking Dog Soldiers.”
“Need you, Alpha,” he moaned, his hand reaching down to pull at his dick.
“Of course. We’d ask that you not lead the military back here, but I have a feeling that won’t be a problem.” Lucifer waved a hand in a dismissive fashion. The guards backed up and gestured at them that it was time to go.
“Need you,” he whispered, his breathing laboured.
“They are trying to wipe out our entire species! All they need to do is reduce us to an unsustainable number and we’ll do the rest for them by breeding with
Hendrickson bent down, closed Garth’s eyes and removed one of his dog tags before standing up again. He tossed the tiny piece of metal across the divide between them, and Dean snatched it out of the air.
“We might have another problem,” Cas said through gritted teeth, his eyes gold once more. Cas ground his hips against Dean’s again, his knot pulling at Dean’s hole.
“Zepp,” Charlie said through their comms just as Dean crept up to the main entrance, keeping low and doing his best to use the terrain to his advantage. He was downwind.
“That’s rough, coming from your family, man,” Dean said rubbing the back of his head. He was no stranger to having shitty family members, but he’d always had Sam beside him.
Dean beamed at Cas who smiled back at him, while Sam, Eileen and Charlie all wrinkled their noses at the smell.
Dean glanced at his overfilled plate of food and then back at Cas. “Can they do that?”
“Yeah,” Dean said, flushing. His eyes shifted from Cas’s to the rest of the room which had changed since the last time he’d looked up. “Oh hey, when did they drop off soap and a bucket of water?”
“Nothing yet, Red. Just more dirt and exhaust and the unwashed masses of this godforsaken place. Over.”
“It won’t take that long,” Novak said, coming to stand in front of him. “I received my last one at the same time you did.”
“Show us,” Dean growled.
A half-hour later, and there was still no sign of the red wolf. Lucifer stepped past Dean, moving towards the base. Dean snarled and shot forward, blocking the path of the larger wolf. He bared his teeth and his fur bristled. Even puffed up to his largest, the white wolf still towered over him. Undaunted, Dean growled, his scent turning angry and protective. Who knew how the Humans would react if they attacked now? He would not allow Charlie to be put in harm’s way. A moment later, Cas was by his side, also baring his teeth at his brother. Dean felt a rush of affection for his new Mate. They were completely outnumbered and overwhelmed, but they would stand together.
He thought he heard Novak’s breathing pattern change, but his ears still weren’t quite right. He looked up to find the other Were methodically going through the rubble without even glancing at Dean. Why bother asking if he wasn’t even going to pay attention to the answer?
“You’re preaching to the choir, Sammy,” he shrugged, “but that’s why I’m out here.”
“Dismissed!” John stated.
“You think?” Dean snarked and crushed their lips together. It wasn’t sweet like their kisses had been earlier, this one was full of tongue and teeth and passion. They fought for dominance but this time Dean submitted quickly, baring his neck. He whimpered as Cas kissed and lightly nipped at the offered skin. Dean started tugging at their clothes. He needed them to be naked right fucking now. Fucking right now. He wanted to roll in Cas’s scent until it covered him completely. Until their individual scents could no longer be distinguished from the whole. Dean pulled Cas over to the nest of blankets and pillows on the floor as he shed his shirt and pants. His skin was on fire, sweat forming all over and slick leaking out his ass. He lay down, looking up at Cas, who was still standing and still clothed.
Without trouble, Sam and Eileen boarded the private plane and were whisked off to some unknown destination. It was the only lead they had to Dean, and they were going to see it through, regardless of where it landed them, literally or figuratively.
His eyes found Charlie’s, glowing gold in the dark, and as one they leapt out of their bunks and into the night. Were they under attack? No. Not them, the forward base. Benny. Dean could see flashes of light from the firefight on the hill from here. Dean swore and took off towards the front gate.
“I’m fairly certain you know exactly who they are, as you were the one who had them brought here,” Dean replied.
“No, we can’t,” Cas murmured back, his eyes glassy. “But we have each other now, and that’s what matters.”
“Eileen. Her name is Eileen.” Sam grinned, joy exuding from every pore. It was a wonder Dean had missed it when they first said hello.
“The Corporal is right. What Lucifer has done here is evil!” Novak said.
“Excellent. Shall we then?” Lucifer smiled.
She nodded, squaring her shoulders as the Humvee came to a stop.
Unsteadily, Cas got to his feet, one hand still holding his knot, the other coming up to stroke Dean’s face and pull him in for a kiss. Before their lips met Cas’s eyes went wide with recognition and then with fear.
. Yes. That would help. He smiled back at her. Of course, she knew of his mental state and what would help the most. “Sure, let’s do it, Red.”
“He’s not new, Dean,” Charlie said from the door, her teeth bared in a snarl. “He’s just a privileged, pampered house pet. That’s Warrant Officer Castiel fucking
“I don’t know how many times I have to tell you that I didn’t know before you will believe me,” Novak responded, sighing heavily before he returned to his pacing.
Eileen nodded. “I understand.” She called out, “Charlie! We need to go see John.”
Cas brushed his fingers across Dean’s dog tags and then Benny’s. “You have his…” he said, sounding surprised and looked up into Dean’s eyes. “I know he was a member of your Pack but were you two...together?”
“Ah Luci, there you are,” Gabriel said as they entered a side chamber with a large table in it flanked by a man whose presence seemed to consume all of the air around him. The tall blond Alpha looked up briefly from the giant map spread across the table, before going back to what he was doing. His scent was overwhelming. Murderer! Dean’s brain screamed the moment Lucifer’s ozone and lightning, charred forest and burnt rubber scent filled his senses. It no longer intrigued Dean, not with Cas’s pure clean scent beside him. There was no comparison between the two even with their shared ozone and lightning. Lucifer was all fire and death whereas Cas was water and life. Dean growled low in his chest and bared his teeth. This was the man who had killed Benny, the man who had nearly taken Dean out a number of times and the man who had slaughtered countless human beings.
“Explain,” John gritted out, “and quickly.”
Dean whined, the desire for Cas to fill him rising up within him. “Cas.”
“Your eyes…were so fucking…blue,” Dean grinned between nipping at Cas’s scent gland. “When we met…I was lost. But my wolf knew...always knew...it’s always been you.”
Eileen nodded her acceptance. “Then?”
“Despite doing everything you could to get rid of me, I’m now the only thing between you and death.” Dean paused waiting for John to work out all of the permutations of his situation. His father was a bastard, but he wasn’t stupid. John scowled and nodded.
The guards all shifted nervously back and forth, glancing at each other and then at Gabriel, who nodded.
“Shut up.” Dean scowled but could feel his face turning red up to the tips of his ears. Hadn’t they established that scenting people was rude? As if he hadn’t been doing the exact same thing to Castiel this entire conversation. It wasn’t his fault he couldn’t breathe now without a mix of their scents assaulting him. The space was too small and their feelings too raw to hide any of it. And to hear his...Castiel speak so passionately and sincerely about him. It made something like hope grow inside of him.
“You know the Corps went to shit when they started letting you animals wear the uniform,” Ketch said conversationally to the men he was sitting with, but his eyes never left Dean.
“You suspected that we…”
“Yeah.” Dean sighed. Sam really did have the harder job between the two of them. After all, Dean only had to worry about a few lives, while Sam had to worry about all of them.
“Ah, there you are, we were wondering when you’d come up for air!” Gabriel grinned at them as they were escorted into Lucifer’s planning room by their guards. Home-Cooked kept blushing whenever he made eye contact with Dean. That would be fun if Bourbon-And-Bubblegum-Over-Steel didn’t keep smirking at them openly every chance she got.
“Hey! I’m not suicidal, just curious! Like say, if you stuck Novak here with 300cc would he pass out or just keel over dead?”
Dean scowled his eyes flicking over to John and then back at Cas. “And what, leave him to his own devices?”
because of the military—no—because of our family?!”
> Dean signed.
he signed, taking up a defensive position in front of Novak further into the cave. The other Were nodded and started to attach explosives to the entranceway. Hopefully, they’d be long gone before they went off. After all, this explosion wasn’t meant to hurt anyone—that part came later.
“What about doing a blood transfusion?” Castiel asked before he shook his head “No, that won’t work I’ve been exposed to the Therianterine, I could make it worse.”
“That’s good, Dean,” Sam said sincerely, trying to catch his brother’s eye through the screen.
Dean wanted to believe him, but he couldn’t. “Don’t lie to me Novak! I told you what his scent was weeks ago!”
Dean took off towards the last man in the field who appeared to be alive, but just as Dean reached him, a bullet took the marine out. Dean snarled in rage, his teeth extending and his eyes flashing gold as he turned towards the source of the shot. He saw a glint of a barrel in a second-story window. Before he could take off toward the shooter, another movement caught his eye.
Bela bared her teeth in a sharp smirk. “I’m surprised his scent hasn’t brought all of the Alphas in Babylon crashing down onto my lab.”
“Thanks, Sam.”
“Now for the rest of you, listen up because I will only say this once.” John paused and the men made noises of assent that were far from military courtesy but John continued anyways. “While I can not deny that Corporal Winchester is my offspring, I assure you that I am one hundred per cent human. I was not made aware of his mother’s...heritage until well after his birth, and have not been associated with him, his brother, or their mother since.”
Dean looked away and tried to shove down the errant thought about how casually Cas and Gabriel spoke of their father. Maybe that was normal behaviour for them? Something that Cas expected he too would have at some point?
“You’re going to kill Lucifer?” Ash asked, his eyes wide. “Dude, I didn’t know that was the plan. That’s really...metal.”
“I mean it exploded, Sam! I caught a whiff of nitroglycerin and saw a flash of somethin’ and the next thing I knew I was hitting the Humvee and rolling onto the ground!”
The explosion threw Dean through the air, right into another merchant hut that collapsed under the force of his landing. He was really getting tired of the smell of his own flesh burning off. The explosion was still ringing in his ears as he did a top-down check. He blinked a few times and the world spun. Huh, must have punctured an eardrum again. The shockwave of an explosion often did more internal damage than any of the cuts and burns the explosive parts made. That and shrapnel. He somehow managed to only have one piece of wood sticking out of his arm. He wiggled his fingers and toes before reaching over to rip it out. Everything hurt but seemed more or less intact. Hmmm, nope, his shoulder was dislocated. Just great. He gritted his teeth and pushed himself up out of the remains of the hut he’d destroyed. Silk. It could have been worse. He moved as quickly as he could back to where he could see some of his men lying on the ground twitching, while others lay completely still. Fuck. The smell of blood, death and burning skin was as thick as the dust cloud that was currently giving them cover. He knew from the experience the smell would linger for hours, while the dust would disperse faster than they would be able to clear everyone out of the blast zone.
Sam and Eileen looked just as ill as Dean felt.
“It’s nice to meet you too,” she replied with a smile.
“Speaking of, don’t you think we’ve been tiptoeing around this long enough, Alpha?” Dean challenged, holding Cas’s gaze.
A heartbeat and then wolf after wolf stepped into view, trapping them against the rockface. Amongst the wolves, there were a few Weres still in their human forms. They were young and strong and held themselves with the confidence that comes only when success is inevitable. Dean barely had time to take them all in, before the Alpha with the decaying forest scent stepped out in front of the pack. He was tall, blue-eyed, and blond-haired, with a wicked smile full of teeth.
“This isn’t how it was supposed to go,” Dean shrugged.
“Say, Dean. You and Cas never gave me the sperm sample you promised last time you came in.”
No. He would not deny them this moment.
“Someone is tapping on the wall,” he said, turning to look at her briefly before his eyes were drawn back to the wall and to the tapping.
In the intervening time, Dean hadn’t so much as made eye contact with the manipulative, lying bastard who had come into their home pretending he was a decent person when he was really just another branch on his traitor-father’s life-destroying tree. He knew from mealtimes that the other Were had been thrown out of all the other buildings he’d tried to sneak himself into. The main barracks didn’t let him set one foot inside before he’d been ousted. The Mess had cited sanitary reasons to not let anyone sleep where food was prepared but loudly spoke of not wanting to invite fleas inside. Even the armoury tent had locked the other Were out.
“Sure thing,” Ash said as Sam and Eileen quickly moved to open the cell to let him inside. “I didn’t exactly bring my entire store of medicine with me, and I am more used to Were physiology, but I should be able to help… ”
Dean tried to convey all of the emotion he could in those last glances with Cas and Charlie, hoping that they knew how much he loved them, before he turned away and shot Bela in the chest. She wobbled and then fell to the floor. She wasn’t dead, but she wasn’t going anywhere fast either. Chaos ensued as bullets flew around them, and Dean aimed his next shot towards Lucifer. Lucifer ducked, grabbed the bag out of Bela’s hands, and darted away towards the Blackhawk, his soldiers rushing in to fill the gap. Dean was certain he’d hit Lucifer at least once before his gun was ripped away by a strong set of teeth.
Sam nodded, took a deep breath and knocked back.
“Dean. Are you alright?” Cas said softly as soon as Gabriel was out of earshot.
Sam’s eyes had immediately gone to the wall, confused.
Dean scowled. He couldn’t provide for his Pack or keep them safe. Not before, and certainly not now. Dean ruthlessly shoved his feelings of inadequacy down, he could worry about that after they escaped. Dean glanced around at the wolves surrounding them. If they escaped.
That is, until there was a soft tapping on their inside duplex wall.
he’d never find a mate, and he
Cas raised an eyebrow. “You think he’s going somewhere?”
“What?” Cas said in a low voice that suddenly seemed far away.
“Good. That’s great, Sammy!” Baby rumbled back into life as Dean turned the ignition and then pulled back onto the highway.
“This is Sam Winchester and his mate, Eileen Leahy,” Castiel said stiffly beside him. “Sam, Eileen, this is Lucifer Novak. Leader and mastermind of a mostly AWOL army of Weres, a mass murderer, our captor and, unfortunately, one of my siblings. Standing beside him is another one of my brothers, Gabriel Novak, who may or may not be involved with all of the evil that goes on here. Haven’t quite figured out if he’s entirely a willing participant or just really stupid.”
She shook her head, “You did everything you could. Not only for him, but for all of us.”
for your art! Collaborating with you was a joy~!
detected it by now? It seemed impossible. Dean shared a glance with Cas, he had so many questions. They needed to find an exit as soon as possible.
“We’re with you Dean,” Ash said quietly behind him.
But surely the military would have contacted them by now had Dean gone AWOL. Maybe they were just watching for signs of something wrong. Or for Dean to show up at Sam’s front door just as he’d always dreamed about to try and capture him. Maybe if he and Eileen continued on with their regular routines and acted as if nothing was amiss, then the military wouldn’t intervene. They’d probably figure Sam had no more knowledge than they had and would leave them alone.
Benny, on the other hand, had come about a year later when Charlie had finally convinced the top brass that she was more valuable as a tech than as a scout. Just like that, Benny had been assigned to their unit. Without any fanfare, Charlie had taken him in. Dean rationalized that it was to protect him from the Humans—to stick together as he and Charlie had done when they first met. This wasn’t the way packs usually formed, but then again, nothing had been the same since the Dive and everything had gone to shit. Nothing was normal anymore. It was even more complicated without scents to help navigate pack hierarchy. They couldn’t tell another person’s designation, if they already had a pack, or really where they fit in at all. It took a couple of weeks—and a particularly nasty firefight—before Benny had become Pack as well. One moment they had been fighting independently, side by side, and the next, Benny had started taking orders from Dean and they continued the fight together.
Castiel sighed and shook his head. “No. Of course not. Thank you for your assistance while we were incapacitated.”
“Yes,” she said calmly, holding eye contact with him.
“I should kill you for what you’ve done to me,” Dean snarled, baring a mouthful of sharp teeth at the Bevell, who couldn’t even draw enough breath to whimper, “to us. To all Weres. You deserve to die, Human.”
“Unicorns are real!” Charlie said without hesitation.
“You should thank me—I saved your life!" John argued, righteous anger colouring his face. "Got you into the military where you’d actually be appreciated as something other than a whore.”
“Damn, Sam. That’s wonderful!” Dean cheered as his brother spaced out thinking about his new mate, for that was certainly what Sam had just described. This woman would not be a fling. He was thrilled for Sam of course, but also sad, knowing that he’d never get to experience that life-altering moment, not while he was in the military at least. He would probably age out of the whole mating business or die long before the military ever let him go.
“Pft. He thinks he can hold us here for a month? Fat chance. The corps will be along shortly to pick us up,” Dean said with confidence.
“Cas?” Sam frowned, “As in WO Castiel Novak, the guy you’ve been complaining about for the last couple of months? The person whose presence coincided with our lives going to shit?”
“You’ll be court-martialed, Dean!” Charlie hissed.
Dean pulled back slightly to look in Cas’s eyes. The world fell away for a time and slowly Dean tilted his head, baring his neck. Cas leaned in, licking and kissing the scent gland before he bit down, his canines drawing blood. Dean immediately reeled from the mix of pain and pleasure emanating from the bite. He felt their bond grow in the back of his mind. And then Cas let go, his tongue lapping up the blood and running over his skin. Cas then bared his own neck, and Dean nuzzled the skin there, searching for the perfect spot before he too bit down. The rush of blood on his tongue, followed by the feeling of their bond solidifying in his mind was indescribable. It was different from the bond they had established earlier when Cas had become Pack or those bonds he shared with Benny, Charlie and Sam. It was as if a whole other piece of himself had just opened up and surrounded him with love and affection.
Were to kill them all. You’ve surely seen the other reports of bases being completely destroyed by one or two assailants. The wolves outside are toying with you,
A number of military leaders were also prosecuted, but most got away with a dishonourable discharge due to their claims of ignorance and of ‘following orders’. There was a significant amount of speculation within the Were community over just how many managed to slip through the cracks completely unpunished, and a certain amount of vigilante justice certainly took place.
“...not enough...”
“I don’t know yet. Going to check it out. Over.”
Dean turned his back on the white wolf, and after giving Cas a reassuring lick, he took off towards the base. He would get Charlie out one way or another.
Both Dean and Cas bared their teeth at him, their matching growls starting deep in their chests. Alistair just laughed. “We can play later. Go talk to Luci before he gets impatient,” he smirked before wandering off down the passageway, his foul scent lingering behind him.
“Let me through. I will go negotiate,” John said gruffly.
“Good. You will join the outgoing team,” John replied without fanfare.
“Well, one thing’s for sure. If Winchester’s alive, he’ll be back,” the first soldier said smugly. “Stupid dog.”
The tension in the car went up considerably.
“You know me, Brother, cool as a cucumber. Really they should be trying not to piss me off—not the other way around!” The Cajun grinned before touching his forehead to Dean’s and then to Charlie’s forehead. “See you in a couple of days, alright?”
“The work could be recreated,” Bela sniffed, “but it would take significantly longer without me.”
“But haven’t you been in the corps for four years?”
“But we’ll be right behind you!” Henrickson called out after him. “And we’ll be killing anything coming down that hill on four legs!”
“I know my place, Angel. Learn yours. Over.”
John harrumphed and changed the topic. “Did you come here to mock me? Or…” his face turned hopeful, “to get me out of here?”
Cas held out his other hand to Andrea, “Castiel. It’s nice to meet you, Andrea.”
“Knew you’d come around, Cassie.”
“We didn’t save you so you could die of starvation,
A number of heads whipped toward him. Dean ignored them in favour of watching his father’s face.
“No! Dean!” Novak’s voice broke as if he could see all of the horrible things racing through Dean’s mind. The other Were quickly stood up, holding out his hands defensively. “I didn’t know it was him! I’m not a traitor. I promise you. I didn’t know. I didn’t. It wasn’t until I caught his scent for myself today and even then, I didn’t want to believe it until I was forced to see the truth with my own eyes.” Novak looked at Dean imploringly. “Please believe me.”
Dean finally pulled back enough that he could look at the Angel’s face, now more hopeful than unsure.
Dean blinked, stunned. He’d just confirmed the existence of a community of people and they were still going through with the plan?
“Howling inside like a wild animal now, are we?”
Dean and Cas shared a look before nodding. “We can do that.”
Dean glanced at Benny’s empty bunk and all the pictures of his pack back home, before settling onto his own bunk. He toyed with his dog tags as his mind drifted. He wondered how Benny’s previous Packmaster had felt when Benny had slipped allegiances to Dean. Angry? Relieved? Did they feel grief over the loss or relief that one of their own had been taken in? Dean barely remembered having his connection to his mother severed, and his father, being human, hadn’t really had an impact. It helped that Sammy had joined him almost instantly instead of defaulting to Mary’s pack. It had been him and Sam for as long as he could remember—that is until Dean was shipped off.
“What happened to ‘we won’t resist’?” Castiel eyed the guards. The petite female bared her teeth at him while the lanky-looking male remained neutral. They both had very light scents, but still more than enough for Dean to pick up. The male smelled like a roast of some kind with all the fixings, like a home-cooked meal. He smelt wholesome. The female, on the other hand, smelled nearly familial, with her bourbon over steel with a hint of something sweet. Like bubble gum.
“Well, since we were able to test Dean, and then he had the good sense to bring Samwich here, we’re hoping we’d have enough data to move forward without subjecting more people to testing,” Gabriel replied smoothly batting his eyes at Sam. Charlie frowned, and was about to argue, but then stopped, and gave Dean a look.
“How secret? 'Cause the sides don’t seem as black and white as they did last week,” Charlie snarked, checking the mag of the gun Cas gave her, before attaching it with a click. “Last thing we need is to find an entire military convoy waiting for us at the exit.”
Whatever it was, it had picked the wrong fucking house to mess with.
“Come on, my worry-wort Packmaster.” Charlie laughed. “Let's get down to brooding.”
He ran his fingers over his own dog tags, traced so often he didn’t have to look to see Were. D Winchester. KS. A+. Zeppelin. Everything he was, summed up on one tiny, disposable, shitty piece of metal. One that said
“Me too,” Dean chirped. “So I’d appreciate it if we never spoke about what you saw today ever again.”
he was. Would Major Winchester keep his? Send it to Sam? Or just throw it away? Dean tucked his and Benny’s dog tags safely away under his shirt and gathered his things.
Dean laughed. “Only you would find those topics romantic. Does this perfect lady have a name, Sam?”
Dean snarled in rage and slammed himself against the bars, his clawed hand reaching out to tear at Gabriel. The other Were was just out of reach. Gabriel bared his teeth at him but otherwise did not move. Dean pulled his arm back to his side of the bars.
WO = Warrant Officer
“You mentioned before that you were going to kill Lucifer,” Sam said almost conversationally once they were out of earshot. “You’re not going to find a better distraction than the military attacking his base, all of his people scrambling and everything going to hell.”
Cpl = Corporal
“Loud and clear,” Charlie said and stepped in to hug him as well. Dean hugged her back tightly.
A nervous-looking Lieutenant stood at his door with a large box. He withered under Dean’s glare. “I’m uh…I’m here...for uh…Corporal Lafitte’s effects, sir.”
“Everything? Without your work, Lucifer has no cure? Is that right?” Sam cut in.
Dean felt Cas’s hand slip into his own and he glanced at his Mate who smiled sadly at him before looking back over to the soldiers.
“Like, Novak money?” Dean whispered in return and they shared a look. If Novak Industries were fueling this terrorist group then the problem was significantly larger than they had previously thought.
Novak sighed again, his whole form slouching even more. “I believe he means when our shots wear off.”
John shook his head no.
Dean pointed to his ear and his dislocated shoulder leading to a useless arm. Novak nodded. He pointed to a house off to the side where they could move the men while they waited for EVAC. Dean nodded and moved to help, pleased that the need to retch had passed. The first man he reached was dead. Dean grabbed his dog tag and moved onto another. The next man was groaning in pain, something that Dean was only starting to hear from one side. He couldn’t see any blood, but that didn’t really mean much. He moved to pick the man up and realized his right arm was still out of commission. He grabbed the man with his left arm and pulled him up over his shoulders. It hurt like a bitch, but the soldier probably had it worse. Dean snarled and moved as quickly as he could to the dubious shelter of the house.
“No, but she’s a hell of a lot smarter than Dad,” Gabriel argued.
“But…” Sam said, “but we have to do something!”
“John’s here. I need to go see him.”
Dean didn’t know how long they stared at one another, but long enough that he could hear Charlie on her way back.
“I… Can’t take it, okay. You not being here. Because I want it too. You. I mean. Us. “
Dean sighed and rested his forehead against Cas’s. If someone had come to him saying that Castiel fucking Novak of all people would be his Mate, he would have kicked their ass into next week. And yet here they were. Dean drank Cas’s scent in. It reached him at a primal level, one that said he was safe and protected, and wanted. It was more than he ever thought possible.
Dean smiled softly at his new Packmate and stopped to pull their foreheads together. Dean took a deep scenting breath, breathing in Garth’s home-cooked roast scent which now included a glass of whiskey and a leather-backed chair. “Welcome, Brother,” he murmured before they continued walking behind the rest of the group. Sam, Eileen and Ash turned to grin at Garth and Garth flushed at their attention.
“I’m new… I was assigned to this barracks? My name is Castiel.”
A half-hour later Dean finally made it back inside to spend time with what family he had left.
“You got it, Boss-man,” Charlie grinned. “My cute little Omega Packmaster.”
A couple of hours later Dean slipped from their barracks in nothing but his skin and dog tags. He was halfway across the yard and about to leap the fence when he felt a gaze land on his back. His hair stood on end. He turned to see Novak’s lamp-like eyes watching him from his lean-to. He paused, wondering if the other Were was going to call out.
“And I need to get Hannah,” Cas added.
In fact, Sam reflected, everything had been fine or at least fairly consistent until that Novak guy arrived in Dean’s life. It couldn’t be a coincidence that as soon as the Novaks got involved with the Winchesters, everything went to hell.
“Your what?!” Sam exclaimed at the same time Ash said “Well...”
“Dismissed,” CMO Bevell said, her face already buried in her charts. Dean blinked and looked away. How long had he been lost in Novak’s eyes? He hopped off his bed, nodded to Henrickson again, and led Charlie out of the aid tent. He didn’t have to look to know that Novak followed after them, or that his eyes never once left Dean’s back.
“Nice to see you too.”
He tipped his head back and howled their victory and their sorrow, his voice still rough from his injury. The Pack joined him and their pained voices echoed through the hanger and undoubtedly through the caves of Babylon as well.
Dean dragged the doctor over to where Charlie lay unmoving.
“No. They aren’t. Lucifer was always going to take the base, all I did was save you from the same fate. You’re welcome, by the way.”
“After the tests.”
Dean nudged Cas with his shoulder and gestured to his food. For a moment it appeared as if Cas was going to argue with him, his eyes filled with the will to fight, but then he relaxed and nodded. He placed one hand on Dean’s thigh while his other skewered pieces of meat on his fork. Satisfied, Dean turned his attention to the Weres coming and going from the meal room. Sure, there were families with little ones, but the vast majority moved and ate like soldiers, most of whom ignored his little Pack with a practised ease. There were a few, however, who made no show of hiding their regard, including their two guards who had blatantly positioned themselves just inside the entrance to the food area. He would really have to find out their names at some point. For now, maybe he could just call them Dumb and Dumber? Or Harry and Lloyd. Never mind that one of them was female. Dean grinned. Surely that would be better than calling them by their scent markers?
“Because when else will we get the opportunity to compare the genes of two half-blooded Weres, one who has been exposed to the Therianterine and one who has not? It could be the breakthrough we’ve been looking for,” Lucifer said simply.
“Why? Why would you…” Cas asked brokenly, his face a mix of anger and pain. “Humans never did anything to you. Have you ever even spent time with one?”
“Out with you lot,” Bela scolded the guards, moving to stand in between them and Dean’s Pack. “You’re taking up space and interfering. And Lucifer would not like to hear about you bothering us.”
He was quiet for a long time.
The humvee suddenly tipped forward with the weight of a giant off-white wolf landing on the hood. It bared its teeth and growled. A moment later the Humvee rocked onto its back wheels as another wolf landed on top of the vehicle. Dean couldn’t smell them from inside, but he didn’t need to, to know the threat was real.
“I think you’ll find that you’re wrong. Corporal Dean Winchester. Born into The Campbell Pack via his mother Mary Campbell, his father, a human, John Winchester. Younger brother Sam Winchester. Mother died young, father abandoned them. Broke from the pack in his teens, and became one of the youngest recorded Packmasters in modern history when he took his brother with him. Blackmailed into the military at twenty-one after his own father outed him right after the Divulgence.”
Anxiety flooded Dean’s senses. Under normal circumstances he would never hesitate to sacrifice himself for his Pack. He had never hesitated before, not when it was Sam being held hostage by the military, and not when Charlie or Cas had been threatened. But this—this was on another level. This was a deal that Cas would kill him for if Charlie didn’t get to it first. And Sam? Oh Sam. Would he be packmaster after Dean? Would Cas? Would his makeshift family fall apart without him? Was this really the best way he could protect them? His Pack was sure to disagree, but then again, it was not their decision to make. How could he even trust Alistair to keep his word? For all he knew, by surrendering now he would be giving Alistair everything he needed to force Dean’s entire Pack into doing whatever he wanted. Alistair could not be trusted.
“You should have seen Dean-o here asking over your wellbeing! Such a good Packmaster he is,” Gabriel cooed.
“We leave at Oh-Six hundred hours. Dismissed!”
“Sam Winchester, Eileen Leahy,” he said, nodding to each of them. “I had hoped it wouldn’t come to this but here we are. You know me as Gadreel Milton, but what you don’t know is that I am actually a member of the Novak family, and I’m here to take you to your brother.”
“We’ll see you soon,” Cas promised, their eyes locking for a long moment, before he nodded and turned away, gesturing for Charlie to follow him.
“We’ve been a little busy being kidnapped by your Packmaster!” Dean growled. Irritated not only by her comment but also by the fact that his nose was still completely overwhelmed, and he couldn’t pick out her scent despite being only a couple of meters away.
(See the end of the chapter for
Bela scowled. “That joke’s getting old, Ash. Not that you were ever amusing.”
When the need for oxygen finally broke the kiss, Dean rested his forehead against Cas’s once more and smiled. “Couldn’t die without doing that at least once.”
“No, I suppose not,” Castiel conceded.
“I’m sorry I worried you,” he finally managed to get in after a full five minutes of Charlie’s rant.
“My name is
Dean growled at her and she just raised an eyebrow at him. “It’s not his fault.”
“You won’t find the rest of your pack that way,” she called, bringing Dean and the group to a halt partway down the tunnel.
“I might have done,” Dean said through gritted teeth, trying not to shift and spread his scent further. The loose pants he was wearing would not hide his semi for long, nor the spot his slick would make. “Your whole family’s freaky.”
“Ah, Lilith, how are you this fine morning?” Gabriel asked a small blonde female as she walked by. Her bright green eyes raked over them, clearly assessing the threat.
“You’re damn right. So don’t die until I do.”
A group of wolves sat in a semi-circle around the pair, waiting. Lucifer stood out from the rest of the pack, not only because he was monstrous, easily towering over the other wolves, but also because his pure white fur shone in the moonlight, and his blue eyes had gone red with his transformation. Dean did his best to mask his shudder every time he locked eyes with the other wolf, but a subtle nudge from his Mate suggested that he hadn’t succeeded as well as he thought. Or maybe his scent had gone sour with his fear and anxiousness. Cas, on the other hand, looked even more beautiful in comparison with the other wolves, his scent clean and strong. He wasn’t as large as Lucifer but his inky black fur seemed to shimmer with a rainbow of colours in the moonlight. Cas licked his muzzle comfortingly and Dean nuzzled him back, breathing in their mixed scent to rid his mind of the other wolf.
“Something isn’t right here, Zeppelin. Come back. Over.” Novak said a few seconds later.
“Sure,” Dean stuck his fork in another cube and held it up for Cas.
“Not sure…How long until the next wave?”
Dean breathed, the tension and the spinning thoughts were dismissed as easily as they had arrived. How did Cas always know what to say? He blushed when he realized his scent had given him away. Again. He’d really have to work on that…or maybe not. He leaned in and kissed Cas chastely in thanks. “Me too,” he whispered against Cas’s mouth before he reluctantly pulled away. Then the world came back into focus and all of the eyes in the room were on them and their moment.
“It has to be,” Gabriel said sadly.
“Understood, Zeppelin. Set the charges for ten minutes then retreat back to the main target. Over.”
If Cas felt remorse over his father’s reaction, he hid it behind a mask of indifference. “I know. And I would never ask Dean to put his—
“I did you a great service,” he said with a nod, secure in his righteousness once again, before addressing all of the men again. “This subject is now closed, and this is the one and only time that we will speak of it, and if you bring it up to me again, you will join the Captain in his punishment. Do we understand each other?”
“I believe that you believe this is the right thing to do, Gabriel. But trust me when I say that it isn’t,” Novak reasoned. “Please let us go.”
Between Lucifer’s corrupt scent and his freaky red eyes, Dean wanted nothing more than to get as far away from him as possible, but he would not back down, not when his Pack was at risk. The other wolves stood passively by, but if it came down to it, he knew whose side they would be on. Lucifer stared down at him, his teeth forming into a snarl.
“Maybe it’s not lies, maybe it’s persuasion?” Cas mused. “Will you feed me a piece of meat from your plate?”
“Once you have Sam—and Eileen—safely away from their military escorts, we will need to move quickly to get Charlie. You seemed sure last time we spoke that you could retrieve her—I assume that means you know exactly where she is—back on base and not wandering the wilderness?”
“Cassie! That’s not very nice.”
Sam grinned. “Knew you were smarter than you looked.”
