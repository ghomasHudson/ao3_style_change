Just like that the familiar is gone and sinking feeling lands in the bottom of his gut. He nods but doesn’t lift his gaze to meet Tony’s as he leaves the room. Steve doesn’t eat. He leaves the food to congeal and go cold. Instead, he curls up under the blankets again and thinks about Ultron exposed him, how Tony knows. How he’s that small 90 pound weakling again that no one ever wanted.
“They are,” Tony says. “I might be close to Jarvis, but hell I barely know Vision. I pay him a huge sum of money to live here and take care of this place while I’m not around. I pay him at least 10 times what others in his position would get. Why? So he will be loyal, because in this day and age you have to pay for loyalty Steve. I don’t know if you get that or not. But that’s the way it is.”
Steve closes his eyes and sighs. He drops Tony’s bag on the chair and then remembers his stuff, his inhaler, his clothes, his comic book stretches, everything is still on the island. “I have some stuff.”
Sam shakes his head and sips the coffee. He blanches and places the mug on the desk. “That is vile, my friend, you need to learn how to brew coffee. But what’s worse is what’s going on here. You need more help than I can give you.”
Then the voice of Tony’s mother follows – she’s calling for her husband. The image pops into Steve’s brain and he should be frightened and shocked that Ultron’s able to manipulate their neural inputs. But the image of Bucky standing at the side of the car, the passenger side. His flesh and blood hand in the car, and the gurgling sound of a woman choking to death, her last cries a simple and pitiful whimper.
Tony cringes and lifts his head up with a glance to the lion. “You’re speaking metaphorically, right?”
Instead Tony curved around in the air and headed back to DC.  As he made his way toward the hospital the smoldering remains of the wreckage from the downfall of SHIELD lay before him. He landed near what was left of the Triskelion, opening the face plate and surveying what was left of the building. As he stared he ordered, “JARVIS, get me Rhodey on the phone.”
“The undead should have stayed dead,” Ross said and then nodded to Pierce who left the window and addressed Steve.
Steve ambles into the parlor one morning, still tired from the previous night’s work. His client, General Fury, had been quite a workout and he’s still a little sore. Natasha gave him some specialized lotion and it’s working wonders as he snuggles into cushioned chair in the corner to read through his next week of clients. He likes to prepare himself – do a little homework to make them feel special. He thinks he’s getting the hang of it. Wanda’s been a wonder helping him get clues from unknown clients and known clients alike. She tells him he’s a natural and he blushes at her compliments.
“Yeah, I am, it’s suit of armor for the angel of justice. Tell me, Cap, are you the angel of justice.” Tony falls off then into a fitful slumber. The pain of the infection overtakes him.  Steve fetches the rest of the clean water, another rag from the shirt he’s ripped, and places a cool rag on Tony’s forehead. He has no idea if it will help or not.
“Hey Buck. Been missing you. I left Brooklyn over three months ago. The cruiser I took was fucked or something, but I made it. I do not like spaceflight. Prime Station is a great place, lots of advancements and nothing in short supply. I can actually bathe! I got a pretty good deal going here. I work with Natasha Romanoff.” He stops and then erases everything. “Fuck.” He finds tears in his eyes. “Why do I feel like I’m disappointing everyone?”
Steve falls back on his haunches and Tony follows him, standing up and fucking into his mouth. It’s raw and brutal and everything that Steve wants because it rips away the fragility of their situation, of hiding and keeping quiet about it. It blasts away his walls, his fears and he urges Tony, gripping his ass and opening his throat. The head of Tony’s cock slams against the back of Steve’s throat and he shudders with the need, the desire. He clutches onto Tony, enjoying the freedom, the bliss of being in love and he realizes he is in love and he wants to spend every moment with Tony. Always.
“So a friend outed you?” Steve opens the dishwasher and rinses the plates. Maybe helping out in the kitchen will win him points with Jarvis.
Natasha glances between the two and then picks at her food. “No, but I think you’re going to tell me.”
“He shouldn’t have done it,” Clint said. “Do you know he didn’t even call in Bruce? Bruce is part of his fucking pack and he decided to take down all of Hydra on his own, Like he’s a fucking-.”
Tony shakes his head. “Filled with viruses to hack into my company’s computer intranet. No thank you.”
“I didn’t die in battle. I lived a full life in another timeline. I got my happy ending.” He tastes the stew – it’s hearty, rich, and earthy in a way.
Tony ties it off and Steve clicks at Shield. Hopefully, the horse is done being frightened and they can get across the river without incident. He draws the horses to the edge of the river, to the banks where the rocky shore falls into the mud. In the height of summer, passage over the river is more like jumping a stream since it dries out to a trickle. But as the rains come in September and load up the river, it grows and swells into a wide and meandering waterway. Schmidt intends to divert the water up in the mountains to use in his mines, but Steve’s still fighting that battle with the Territory’s governor Pierce.
“Your own fault, Cap, she did warn you,” Clint said as he hopped down from a perch up in the tree near the bike. He hit the ignition to turn it off but then twisted up his face at the state of the bike. “Might take a while to fix that.” He pointed to Steve. “How about you?”
For a second, Steve thinks that Tony might wrap his arm around him and saunter back to the picnic area. When he doesn’t a deep disappointment sinks through Steve and he clears it away by coughing and blinking. Tony turns to investigate but Steve only begs off.
Rumlow shrugged at them. “You don’t want to acknowledge the wealth of information and the gem you got here, that’s not up to me, sir.” He snorted. With one last revolution, the mask split open and Sawyer helped Rumlow with the ports that had been drilled into the Captain’s skull. Tiny trickles of blood dripped down his face like tears. Once the mask fell away, Rogers bowed his head and blinked, though he fought to keep his eyes open even through the tears and the obvious pain the lighting brought him.
Tony laughs. “If I went into urgency that would be the greatest feat. Can you imagine? The whole of the council waiting for days as I fucked my brains out with this champion.” He takes a hold of Steven’s shoulder and shakes it.
Cradling his head in his hands and leaning against his legs, Steve succumbs to the tension and fear building inside of him. He ran from Tony for a reason, one that he’s trying desperately to hide from – and using all the power of his tactician mind to warp into a rationale. Even though he asked for help from Natasha regarding Stane, Steve recognizes the truth. Shit, even Natasha saw right through him when he talked with her. It’s not that hard to figure out – it’s not his fault. Not really, Tony Stark is a damned charming guy. Who would blame him?
She starts to walk away but before she leaves she stops and says, “I’m here for you, you know that Tony?”
Steve nodded but still didn’t look up at Tony. “There’s something else. Something horrible, Tony.” Now he did move. He met Tony’s gaze. “When Natasha and I were on the run from SHIELD, we ended up finding a version of Zola. His mind, believe it or not, had been uploaded into this huge databank. He told us things about how Hydra grew inside of SHIELD. He called it a beautiful parasite.” He made a little laugh. “How beautiful could it be if it’s a parasite?” His eyes glimmered with unshed tears as he looked at all of the paper work. “You have to believe me, Tony. If it had been Bucky, if he had any control, any free will he would never have done it.”
Steve presses fingers into his eyes until he sees stars. “I am. In Canada on an island off the coast of Newfoundland.”
“I agree, your highness. I appreciate everything that you and your people have done for us,” Steve replied, the stress tightening his shoulders as he spoke. “If you hadn’t taken us in, I have to admit, I’m not sure I would have healed or what would have happened to us.”
“No. You’re someone. Who are you?” Tony asks. It sounds like the thunder of the ocean waves crashing against the shore dinning out all other noises.
Tony sighs and drops his hands. He white knuckles his console. “Not we, you. I don’t like you going alone.”
Sam caught Tony’s arm. “Think about why he’s doing it. Why he’s shielding us from what’s really going on.”
Natasha? Bruce? Sure, he understood Peggy – Peggy had been Steve’s girl, everyone knew the story, the heart-breaking story of Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter. How their unrequited love lived through the decades and how the ghostly shadow of Steve hovered over Peggy even through all of her successful days. Once he returned and she had lived her life, the internet went wild about how Peggy – old and infirmed – would never leave Steve. He would be haunted by her all the days of his life. It was circular, and tragic, and the internet and media loved it. They ate that shit up.
“When I was a child, my mother told me about limbo and purgatory. Those sinners waiting for their final reprieve.”
Steve performs all the time in his role as a sex worker. It’s what he does. He’s like a robot. But no, this isn’t like that at all. His body takes over his mind and he transforms into a rutting animal in need of a good fuck. He’s not sure Tony’s fingers are going to be enough for him and he makes little whimpering noises.
She lifted a shoulder. “It’s how I grew up.” She seemed oddly comfortable about the turn of events. Considering her position, a link to someone so out of touch with today should be, at the very least, an inconvenience. She dusted herself off as he stood there feeling as if his arms were too big and his chest too large. Emanating from her, he only received a soft hum. Usually, he received a hard feedback loop that always gave him a headache, but not from her at all. The sound of her in his head warmed him. It felt both soothing and frightening – how very in control of her emotions she was.
“I’m gonna set her down close to DC. We need to get to safety as soon as possible because they’ll still be able to find us.” Clint battled with the choke and then got the helicopter to stabilize.
What does it mean? Does it mean the Transformation to an angel? What is happening in his world?  Then he remembers Steve begging Natasha –
“Okay, room service it is,” Steve agreed. Part of him relaxed but a deeper part panged with disappointment. He picked up the empty cup and disposed of it as they exited the gym area of the hotel. Walking through the hotel, Steve tried to ignore the electric undercurrent between them. Clearing his throat, he asked, “So Thor isn’t taking it well?”
With practiced hands, Steve stretches himself and uses the lube liberally. He always likes the way it feels, to be penetrated. It sends thrills down his spine and he feels a twitch in his flaccid cock. He figures most of his clients won’t care if he gets off, but it’s probably good to show interest. He’s glad the idea of being a sex worker doesn’t shame him, but in fact sends little shivers of delight and desire coursing through him. Once he believes he’s adequately stretched and ready, Steve slips the dildo out and places it on the sink. He washes his hands and then washes the dildo.
Heavy dark woods adorn the foyer, carved and embellished. A massive curving staircase dominates the back wall of the circular foyer. Strange points to the staircase and it surprises Steve, but there are a few other stragglers headed to the upper floors. They find their way to the third floor where the ballroom is.
“Like?” Tony asked and waited but that’s when Bruce clammed up. “Oh I get it. It’s only for the pack.”
“He stares at me,” Tony replies and abandons the work to turn around and close his arms around his chest. The arc reactor aches today for some reason. “Just stares.”
Jamison glares at Tony. “I keep telling our lord that I am not going to be training anyone. I am the Master of the Fleet and the Captain of this ship. I do not have time to be his head of security. Just because you removed An’Estane as your Master of Security and rid him of your clan, doesn’t mean I have the time to do it.”
“Didn’t know if it would work,” Steve said. He focused on their hands together. This was okay. This was how it should be. “The bonds, you know, don’t bleed out. I mean, if I reach out to only you I’m pretty sure it’s not like a party line and everyone gets the signal. Just you get the signal, if I’m focused.”
So why was it decades later he asked for the fool to bond with him? It had nothing to do with his childish hero worship and everything to do with fucking Natasha’s profile on Tony as Iron Man. It haunted him, that profile. Nearly kept him off the Avengers, but Fury eventually broke down and called Tony in because Iron Man could do the job no one else could. Hell, he didn’t even need the rest of the Avengers. They were superfluous anyway. Who needs someone with a hammer? A carpenter, that’s who. Oh, and a guy with a bow? That’s useful in a gun (laser and bomb) fight. Let’s not even talk about an unarmed guy with a shield or a chick with killer thighs. Useless. The only one of the team that might be functional was Hulk, and he was a dimwit. It’s like Bruce ate all the brain power and left Hulk with toddler brain syndrome. What a useless pack of nobodies.
Steve bows his head and looks at the wavering ground – it looks like orange blades of grass but it isn’t. It’s just nothingness in the end. “I don’t know. I can’t lose again, not you, not Natasha. It was too hard the first time.”
Blind spots flickered in his field of vision as he turned to look at Tony who stood right next to him. In quiet voice, Tony whispered, “Hey.” Somehow he read that the mood shifted and Steve battled those inner demons again.
“It’s kind of like that GPS thing, right?” Steve must pull out the disc again because Pepper clacks over to him and slaps it out of the air. Tony can hear the clap and the swat of air.
At first, Steve thinks that Tony’s might protest, but the prince rethinks it and nods. Steve smiles at Luke and he brings them to a corner where silk straps and lingerie adorn the walls.
Tony threw his hands up. “I don’t know how to get there. Not like purposefully. I’ve never done it that way.” Sure, that one time with Steve in England was almost directed, but really not. He thought of that as mutual dreaming or some shit. “It just happens.”
“It wasn’t much, but I couldn’t,” Steve said. “We went through what we were able to save when Ma got sick. I couldn’t make the rent a few months in a row. Old man Miller needed the money too. So I left.”
Tony nodded, and they started toward the mid-century modern house with its swooping roofline and windows. No one would ever think a vampire lived here. He looked behind him at the lightened sky, the reds and pinks. It would rain today. He shivered. He opened the door to safety and only wished he knew if Steve was safe as well.
Reaching, Clint unlocked the gag and then tugged it off. Clint had to yank the plastic ball out of Steve’s mouth. As he did, Steve’s eyes watered, and he worked his mouth. His jaw ached. Part of him, a small and quiet part – the child that curled in his bed sick and miserable as his mother soothed him with a hand through his hair – wanted only to beg for release, to plead for his arms to be unchained, to ask someone to clean away the semen staining his wounds on his belly. But the man that Sarah Rogers raised swallowed down the need for pity, the weakness of a little boy, and remained silent and stoic against the agony that befell him.
She smiles and takes out her phone to jot down the notes. “Already done. Now, I’ll have JARVIS update you on when to be ready for the press conference this afternoon. Don’t be late! After that we have a Board meeting at 6 pm.”
“Hmm, do you want me to get you a date?” Steve hesitates. “I mean I’m not even good getting myself a date.”
“I’m not going anywhere, and I don’t think you’re in any shape to make me leave.” He marches into the tiny bathroom. It’s so tight and cramped, he hates it. “You have a first aid kit or something.”
“And what comes next?” Tony shook his head as he picked apart the shaft of a grass blade. “I don’t know.”
Steve slips his arm off of Bucky’s shoulders, and studies him. “Really, Buck, what’s this all about?”
“And a guy I knew – well, he went into it and it worked out well for him. Got him off the settlement. I’d heard the Prime Stations were great for money and for the whor-the sex worker positions. Real protection, real respect. So, I signed up.”
“This is not at all like what we did with Clint,” Bruce said and then added. “Reminds me more of an intervention.”
“Going onto Schmidt’s range -which pretty much nearly encircles the town- is dangerous. He’s got his gang patrolling all the time. Getting close is near to impossible.” Steve stands up and sighs, feeling as if he’s losing part of himself with Bucky.
Tony frowns, that doesn’t seem like anything he’s heard before and could not be linked at all to Steve. Clearing his head, he puts his hand up as the locals step back. “Hey now, I got you.”
Agents held his arms onto the cross and other agents used large mallets to ram large iron spikes into his palms. Rumlow laughed as they worked. Tony’s brain roiled and scrambled, trying to make sense of what was happening. Someone shrieked, and he realized it was him. He let the sound come, exploding out of his mouth as the pain encompassed him. He screeched as the pain shot through him, wished his undead state saved him from the agony – but it did not. Each swing of the hammer lanced through his arms and he screamed. Rumlow stared down at Tony.
“Fries, if you don’t mind. There’s a frozen bag in the freezer. I brought it. Just make half of the bag.” Steve hums to himself after he gives Tony the instructions. “You can go ahead and use the oven. It will just take a bit longer for the fries to cook because of the chicken.”
Shrugging, Steve brings out a small lantern and turns it on. “Well, I knew you wouldn’t think of any type of food or survival supplies. So that’s what I thought of. Most of this will last for as long as we’re in here. I kind of wish I’d thought of something like that for my shield.”
“That’s it?” Tony rubs at his face. He has a blanket fold impression on his cheek and his eyes look bleary. He scratches a hand through the mess of his hair.
At first, Steve reaches to pick up the bacon with his hand and then remembers himself. He grasps the fork, playing with it, then balancing it, until he finally grips it like a toddler.
“And now?” Tony asked. He trespassed. Somehow he trespassed into secrets he shouldn’t know. Though the strange room he found himself in was small, he felt like the expanse of the universe opened up around him.
“Oh, that reassures me,” Steve murmurs but does collapse into the chair. He shouldn’t, he needs to go and check on Bucky – he’s been at Stark’s residence all day. He loathes to leave, because he knows once he steps out of the threshold, he’ll have to face what he’s done and himself.
“Sweet-pea, there you are.” Thor leans against the door frame. He’s holding a banana (where the hell did he get that) and winks at Steve. “I missed you. Come back to bed.”
The business of killing people got him where he is today. In a damned cave in the mountains of Afghanistan with terrorists waiting to kill him at any moment. He needs to finish the suit and get them out of here. It isn’t going to be easy and he’s not sure this thing in his chest, this arc reactor, will have enough juice to power the suit and carry him and Steve to freedom. He has to try, he wasn’t going to leave Yinsen behind, and he damn well is not going to leave Army boy behind.
Tony stays open and willing for him, begging him for more as Steve laps at the tip of his cock, playing and teasing.
“There has to be.” Steve munched on the chips. “Otherwise I’d be dead in the Potomac. We’re bonded and I have to believe that means something too.
Crossing his arms, he considers her bait but doesn’t take it. “I have my ideas. But this isn’t the time or the place to discuss them.”
When they approach the double doors to the prince’s quarters Happy goes through an elaborate display of security measures for entry. When the doors finally release their locks and open, Happy gestures for Steve to go first. “Please.”
Tony scowls at him. “Fine, big Army guy, be that way.” Tony moves away and stands by the work bench with his back to Steve. He doesn’t start to work, or do anything. He’s only staring, gazing out into the abyss.
With no clue on how to proceed, Tony replies, “Sounds good. Let’s try for late morning. I might need to sleep in.”
“In order to find out what the main security issues are I need to know what all the players are doing. You can’t command soldiers without knowing the battlefield,” Steve says.
Words stuck in Steve’s throat as a sinking feeling consumed him. Steve shook his head, not in denial but in stunned silence. He didn’t have any idea what to say, how to deal with the subject. He never even tried to say anything.
Tony doesn’t want to do it, but the omega forces his hand. He has no other choice, not with an audience. He has to go through with his threat otherwise nothing he says will be taken seriously by Steven. With a quick signal, Tony directs Jamison to come to his side as well as his Security Administrator. “You will see that even though you are considered my Master of Security, the Captain of my forces, you must submit to my will.” Tony inhales once before he makes his final judgment. “Take him and cane him. I think five will do. Use the collar to subdue him. After, have him dressed and ready for the meeting in thirty minutes. I don’t care if he’s falling down on his face.”
“Shouldn’t have attempted this. Damn foolish,” Steve says and then he thinks of Bucky and how he would do anything to save the man he calls his brother. “But Bucky.”
“Yes, you could. I don’t think you will,” Steven says and steps across the short divide between them into his personal space. He surprises Tony then, by tenderly cupping Tony’s jaw and bringing his line of sight to focus on Steven’s eyes, his expression. “I once told you I never knew you to be so cruel, and you replied that I didn’t know you at all.”
“Aye, it is truth. My brother is one of our greatest inventors. He brought forth many medicines and other -.”
“We could wait,” Steve suggested. If it put Clint in any more danger, then Steve thought it would be a good idea to wait it out. At the same time, the idea that Clint’s soul was literally ripping itself apart ratchetted up Steve’s fears. “But what I experienced… it wasn’t good.”
“You have been fucking in dreamland and at the same time acting like a prude in reality,” Tony said. “I think I get to laugh a little at that.”
He rocked on Steve’s hard cock. The sensation sent shivers of extra want through him. Steve managed a whimper as he lay unmoving beneath Tony. They’d played around with the paralytic before, and Tony knew that Steve loved it, that he longed for Tony to take him and show him the power of their pairing. “I’d do anything for you, my sun. Anything at all.” Tony lifted his hips and slammed down again as a dribble of drool bubbled out of Steve’s mouth. Steve’s eyes were fully open and Tony bent down to kiss him. “Gonna give you the antidote now.”
“Tony, you need to listen to me. The danger is worse than you think,” Steven said and he glanced around as if he could pinpoint the source of the danger. His eyes glinted in the light, and there was something feral, powerful, and potent about him. “It isn’t just political.”
“You know I do think of you as more than just my Personal Assistant, Steve,” Tony says. His eyes closed; he’s not straining for something that’s not there. “You’re a friend at the very least. You’ve been a talented asset. As well as a caring assistant. You’re important to me. I think Pepper and I made a good decision when we hired you.”
“Thanks, he might settle a bit if you sit with him.” He offers and opens the small clay pot with stew. There’s a plate of freshly baked biscuits, and a cup of warm coffee.
“You have very little faith in me,” Tony says and settles against the tree, still picking out of the brownie container. Steve stands up and goes over to him. He kneels next to his feet and starts to untie Tony’s shoelaces. “What the hell are you doing?”
“Doctor Strange wants to make sure that Mister Stark is stable and can endure the flight,” the medic says.
The agents battered Steve with fists as well as superficial knife wounds over the next five minutes. No matter what Tony did, his spiritual form didn’t intervene, but then he noticed his physical body shuddering on the gurney. With no idea whether or not it was responding to his desperation, Tony concentrated on it.
“All for what price,” Steve says and wipes his hand across the console, clearing it and plunging the room into darkness. He stays perfectly still, letting the silence, the void of space wash over him. He longs for the cockpit of his bucket of bolts, the Howling Commando again. The long journeys, the reverie of night watch. It was simpler then, and yet – he ignored responsibility, aspired to nothing.
He walks up the scorched steps and finds his way to the little apartment. The stench of fire lingers even though it has been months. He can taste it in the air. He shoves his hands deep in his pockets and feels the moments again, how very strong and crazy Bucky was.
“No, I don’t,” Steve said, and Tony felt the truth of his statement ring through the bonds. “I know this is the right thing to do.”
“That’s fucking brilliant. Wish I’d thought of that.” He smells the hot liquid and luxuriates in it for a minute before he cracks his eyes open at Steve. “Wait a minute. You said thermos of coffee for you. That means you brought this specifically for me.”
“That’s enough, Agent Barton.” Ross came to stand in front of Steve. “Agent Rumlow,” he called. “Please escort Agent Barton to see his family. They’re waiting for him.”
The pure pleasure of it, the idea of feeling Tony surrounding him, taking him, shoots waves of need through him so powerful, Steve very nearly drops – his blood pooling in his groin. He steadies himself against Tony as he kisses and nuzzles against the nape of his neck. He stifles his words, wanting to confess how much he needs Tony, how much his heart beats for him. When Tony leaves every thing will be different. It will destroy what’s left of Steve’s heart. He shuts away the idea of begging Tony, asking him to take him away.
“Could be,” he says and offers her a quick peck on the cheek. He glances around and puts on a fake shiver  “I hate these places.” Tony rotates his shoulders as if his suit jacket is too tight. He peers out the window of the building, to the outer docking bay. He should be on his way to the Council meeting, preparing his team. They only haveweeks to ensure his Prime Status claim to the chair will succeed. Instead, he’s stuck on the outer world of Nod – so called because it is a planet of unwanted Omega warriors.  Apparently, he’s that desperate now.
"Hold him down, I need to clean out the wound, I’ve never seen a wound like this – it’s like it’s festering," the doctor says and with Natasha, they work their way into the wound along Bucky's side and his back.
“Better,” Steve rasps. His ears ache and every now and again a spearing pain shoots through them, but it’s tolerable. “Better.”
“Yes, she can be counted on,” Tony says. “Now An’Furin and his omega Marya are a little trickier. He’s part of the Elders of Shield. I would think they would stay on the sidelines for this since they are usually neutral and charged with protection of the whole of the human Council of Worlds. But you never know. He’s never to be trusted.”
Logan must share the same hesitation Tony feels based on the twist of his mouth and the narrowing of his eyes. It is the easiest way to test it, though, so Tony nods.
They end up at the Parlor Inn with Darcy serving the coffee that appeals to Sam more than the brew Steve offered him.
“I won’t – that’s the beauty of being a vampire Divini – it can’t hurt me anymore, remember. It will just make it more difficult to use my abilities, if you know what I mean,” Tony said and patted the lounger again. “Unless you would like me to leave?”
Ross only growls and the SUV doors slam shut. The back of the vehicle plunges into darkness with only a pitiful stream of sunlight making its way into the space. Tony grabs Steve’s thigh.
He looked over to Rumlow, who only smiled. Son of a bitch. He needed back up, but they were so many levels down in the Earth. The armor couldn’t get here and Rhodey was out of range. He should have carried the suitcase armor with him. He needed a means to communicate with the outside world. He needed to call in Rhodey for support. With a glance at the still smirking Rumlow, Tony decided the only way to handle the situation was to get Pepper to find a way to link to Rhodey. She might be able to do it.
Her energy cycloned around him, swirling with ever increasing intensity. It devoured pieces of him, his life energy dissipating through the burning misery. Even as it jabbed and seared, he felt his soul respond. His astral projection searched and then mirrored her energy. As they synchronized, the despondency and hopelessness of the young woman came through and he knew her, understood her. Her and her brother.
When Tony finally pulls away, Steve glimpses a hint of wetness in his eyes which he shifts around and goes to the water pitcher to hide. Steve doesn’t call him on it. As Tony pours them both a cup of water, he starts, “I have to admit, it’s fucked up. Everything, everyone.”
Instead of the heat from the battle, Steve only felt the cold and ice of death. He trembled and for a second believed he might be back in the ice. Cho knelt next to him and he heard other voices, voices calling out. He must have blanked out for a moment. The next thing he knew Bruce and Tony hunched over him as a nurse wiped his face.
She sighs a little. “What I mean is this – Steve’s fragile right now. The whole Barnes thing ate him up. He’s not like me, he’s not used to holding his secrets for the greater good. But he’s held this one about himself, because he’s always believed it was for the greater good-.”
Steve moves his wings, shifting them close to his body and then perches on the arm of the cushioned chair. “Like I said, angels aren’t allowed to have relations with humans, it’s forbidden. The angel becomes anchored to one human and it’s not a good thing.”
“Yeah, like we are.” And then Steve kissed him. Maybe, just maybe, Tony might come to an understanding of being Beloved in a soul pack.
Natasha came and exposed them, but neither one of them wanted to admit it. They were both the Emperor with no clothes, both pretending, both strutting and parading around and not allowing themselves to see. “That’s not it,” Tony said and tore away from Pepper. He loved her, he did. Talking about this – about Iron Man and his life’s calling – that was off the table.
He steps up to the dented chipped door and knocks trying to settle his stomach. After a few minutes, the door across the hallway opens and a red head peeks out. She looks like a dream and he has no idea why someone with her classical beauty would end up in a place one door over from hell. She mutters something in what he thinks is Russian and then in broken English says, "Not home. Steve out for night."
“Are you sure?” The sting still ached in his wrist where the band was and now there was the new brand with its intricate weaving up his forearm.
“What if I told you, I had nanites that would solve that problem completely?” The side of Tony’s mouth crooks in a wicked smile.
“Come here, let me take off your shirt.” Tony guided Steve to sit more properly on the couch and then tugged off his shirt. He examined Steve’s chest, the soul mark across it – the Beloved brand – purpled against his skin. Reaching out, Tony touched it. “Is it always this color?”
Jarvis scans him up and down and then gives a curt nod of his head and huffs as he leaves. Steve watches him go. Apparently, his performance at the little lunch party was noticed. Steve lets out a sigh that only aggravates his headache. He changes quickly, cursing himself for being excited to see Tony again and at the same time feeling ashamed of himself. He’s a college graduate with a fine arts degree. He was a Captain in the Army. He did tours of duty; he went on missions. He’s not some damsel in distress. After he cleans up, Steve studies himself in the mirror.
As they unbind him and remove the leads and other tubes, he lies there in a kind of stupor. His mind flashes back to the Retreat room with Tony, the kiss, and how he felt at that moment. Raw, open, wounded. Then his mind brings him vividly back to the bunker in Siberia. His own words ringing through his head as he tried to convince Tony not to kill Bucky. As he thrust the shield down into the arc reactor to once and for all stop Tony. That’s all he wanted to do, stop him. He’d blown off Bucky’s arm, kicked him in the face with an armored boot. Even now the pain and angry and sorrow races through him.
“Steve, Steve,” Clint said. Steve jerked to attention and shifted his eyes to Clint. “Please. Take some. It will help.”
“But you’re right. I was lucky to have them. I still am lucky.” Tony tilted his head and wished for all the world he could see Steve at that moment. He wanted to know his body language, wanted to feel the intensity of his gaze. “But why do you ask?”
The audience is grateful to turn their attention to something other than the fatal car crash and applaud long and hard for Pepper. She thanks them without coming to the microphone.
Tony didn’t reply. Instead he walked right over to Steve into the sunlight. “You need rest after everything that happened today. Sleep.” He pointed to the lounger that was easily large enough for two.
Pepper stops him. “Say no more. I’m off.” She spins on her heels and is gone before he can release a pent up breath.
“I think I know where they are.” Steve turns to face Tony, hands under his cheek. “You’re not going to believe me, but it’s the perfect place to hide out because no one really see you there.”
This time he feels real heat and shame as he points to the obscenely large purple one. Without missing a beat she picks it up, stows the others, and then slicks up the purple one with some lube.
“Just-.” He raked fingers through his hair, feeling his nail against his scalp and then recalling how he’d imagined Steve’s nail scraping against his dick. Even recalling it, he got hard. The robe hid his shame. “Just, don’t.” He gagged a little. “Don’t do this. I can. We can try again. Right now.”
“So, there’s a magic- a science cube you found but haven’t figured out yet?” Tony squeezed his little stuffed toy under the table. He kept it on his lap because his father detested the lion.  He swung his legs, happily. He’d distracted them from their fight. The warmth of success suffused him, and he smiled.
“Ready when you are.” Strange looks him up and down with that judgmental stare and Wong only sighs. Steve only throws his hands up and says, “This is as good as it gets, fellas.”
“Well you always used to go to that little shop around the corner from the Tower. I went into Manhattan and I asked them to make some of their creamer and brought it with me.”
She leans down and opens a drawer in the table to retrieve a remote control. Pointing it at the painting on the wall, she activates it and the painting slips into the wall pocket and a screen appears. The screen warms and lightens as several photographs and biographies of men appear on it.
Tony considers him, studying how the sunken eyes remaining surprisingly alert. An intelligence flickers through the blue of his eyes and his expression only twists imperceptibly as he assesses Tony as well. He looks like he holds the secrets of the world behind those eyes.
He climbs to his feet and finds Steve leaping from the bed. He's naked. His body and face are bruised. His jump stumbles and he curls over his midsection, clamping a hand to obviously injured -probably cracked- ribs.
The vampire ‘disease’ had been part of human existence for centuries. The vampires stayed out of the limelight, haunted the shadows, and by their own admission hunted humans when they couldn’t mate. Of course, it caused all kinds of consternation and unfounded fears. It led to rumors, myths, and whatnot. As the true nature of vampirism was discovered, the world went from fear to resentment to outward disgust. The idea that the undead crossed the border to be immortal and relied on human blood instilled in people an irrational envy. When vampires came to volunteer to help the world when it roiled with war and Nazis Steve had thought they’d turned a corner. But when he woke up, he’d been proven wrong. It wouldn’t be the first time.
As they all exit the train, his party disperses, Pep reminding him of his morning meetings. Harry, Jamison, and Pep amble toward their respective houses. Steven walks Tony to the mansion entrance. The scent of jasmine and fresh rain lingers in the air, and Tony wonders if while they were stuck indoors all day it had showered. He can hear the occasional hoot of a night bird and the rustle of the light breezes. When he glances at Steven, the light from the lamps lining their pathway to the house glows around him almost ethereally.
“Yes,” Steve says through clenched teeth. He tucks the pad away after entering the name, and clasps Stane’s hand with a quick shake. “Your father and I did have some interaction.”
She snickers. “You still don’t get it, do you?” She shakes her head. “Sometimes the lies that I tell, even I fall for, Rogers. Sometimes, I even believe them.” Her gaze drifts over to Bucky’s and she smiles, softly, sweetly, lightly.
After my beta  read the chapter, I decided I didn't like how it went so I went through and rewrote a massive section of this chapter. It hasn't been read for issues, so there might be some typos and things like that - so I apologize! Hope you like it!
Steve touches the side of Tony’s hand and then places them in his palm. Tony slips the glasses on and touches the frame. He winces a little but doesn’t complain of a headache – yet. “What are you talking about?” He turns his attention to Strange.
Tony rested his head against Steve’s heart. The sound of it, a steady beat against his ear, might be the most beautiful sound Tony ever heard. He loved to listen to it all day. “Promise me?”
“In some ways, there are some people who brought that hierarchy out here,” Tony says. “Like your territorial governor. Sure, he has someone like Fury as his assistant, but that’s all for show. You think he listens to a word Fury says? A former slave? I don’t think so. Before you know it, Captain, this entire safe haven of yours is going to transform into the world you left behind.”
Whether or not Natasha transformed into something more fantastical only passed as a trivial point in Steve’s life. Tony and his welfare had become Steve’s sole purpose. He understood the glamour drugged his mind, but he had the serum and it cleared the dulling effects easily enough. What was left was Steve’s devotion and gratitude, and love. Tony showed the same to Steve. When Steve walked in a room it was like the sun shone on his face for the first time. Tony brightened and rose red came to his cheeks regardless of the last time he’d eaten.  Tony wasn’t supposed to be able to blush, but still it was there. They spent every spare minute together. Steve learned of Tony’s obsession with tinkering and inventing; while Tony spent hours listening to Steve’s war stories or modeling for Steve’s drawing.
Tony cannot believe the idiot is asking such mundane, stupid ass questions. Of course, he spent the hours alone working on the suit, the way out, the armor to get the fuck out of here and save them both. He’s very nearly done. It will only take a few more hours and he’ll be able to place the last pieces together and upload the codes for flight. It’s going to work, he knows it.
“Okay, okay,” Steve says and knows that Tony’s sinking fast. He needs to get him out of the rest of his wet clothes and bundled in some blankets. Kneeling, he pulls off Tony’s boots and then goes to his pants. He works as quickly as he can considering his fingers have lost all feeling and his own body threatens to sink into the oblivion of the cold. But the fire is a God sent and he keeps functioning, keeps forcing his body to do what it needs to do.
He really needs to check in with home base. As he considers escaping the shop for a few minutes to call the Brothel, Tony walks over to him with bags in hand.  The joy on his face hits hard.
“Nice,” Bucky says and the odor grows heavy and he gags as he hits the sewer. As he does he scrambles to his feet, not only to get his head out of the muck, but also to search for Steve. He manages to get himself on his feet in the knee high sewage but Steve’s laying completely submerged, flailing and trying to right himself. Bucky rushes to his side and grabs hold of his hands. “I’m here, it’s okay.”
Once he had imagined her as a catch, then as a lover, and finally as a life mate, but he’d missed his chance when he found out his body guard, sometimes driver, was dating her. He twisted around in the bucket seat of the SUV to see the specially equipment van that Happy drove following behind them. Pepper had insisted they needed the van with its medical equipment and its security tools. You can never be too careful she’d stated.
“Nanobots, thanks to your vampire mate.” Ross smiled and the glimmer in his eyes shined in the light. Rumlow entered the room and gestured for Clint to follow him. “He was working on them, though it was officially Stark Industries.”
Steve thanks her and clasps it on his wrist; it instantly forms to his thin arm. “I didn’t think this was necessary.”
“I’m not going to place anything, Tony. You don’t seem to comprehend the risks you’re taking. The implant you have now is being rejected. While we are on ground not a lot of researchers have tread, I fear that if we go further you may suffer injury.”  As Strange talks he spends time testing Tony’s reflexes as well as instructing him through a series of cognitive skills tests.
Tony stills for a moment and tilts his head. “Who would ever not want you to finish. You’re exquisite.”
“Stay. And let’s finish our lunch. I’d like that. Then after you can give me one of those head massages,” Tony says because he knows the glasses aren’t going to last – not today. Not with all the stress. He’s going to breakdown and the headaches lurk in the corners.
“Don’t say it, Captain,” Tony says and he drops his hand from Steve’s face and a coldness sweeps over him. Tony tugs open the ties of his shirt to reveal a scarred chest and a small metal device over his heart. “We live on borrowed time, Captain, all of us. Why do you insist on cheating yourself out of happiness?”
Tony saw the sketches that Steve did before, so the words are on the tip of his tongue, but he sucks back -
“Even my hardcopy notes,” Steve assures. “Please Tony. The quicker you get this done the better.” It seems to trigger Tony and he nods. “Okay then, the medics can proceed.” He gets out of the way.
“You’ll lose blood,” Steve replied and didn’t want to add that it was precious blood that Steve had lost but the words hit Tony without even being spoken.
“Yeah, it’s wonderful. How did you? I mean how did you manage?” Steve asks. He has to get it out of his head that visually impaired people can’t do things he can – they just do things different. They accommodate and compensate in different ways.
Cursing under his breath, Steve dodges the next series of shots and swivels to the side, getting a wall to the next path between him and his nemesis. He grits his teeth and takes off down the open air tunnel, trying to gage the direction. Ultron’s been smart though, there’s no angle to any light. It’s just above and that’s it. He can’t tell north or south. He can’t stop to figure out whether or not he’s headed toward the exit and to Tony or not.  A bolt of repulsor fire hits the wall next to him and he scrambles out of the way as a cascade of stone and mortar rains down.
“How’d he get here?” Steve asks as Tony continues to stand, unmoving, only a few meters away. It feels like millions. He’s doing a bang up job this time. He might as well ask for his ticket out of here, he’s not going to win this one.
“I was thinking on the ride over here that I screwed up, that this would be awkward. I don’t want you to feel cheap or that this is a one night stand, because to me it’s not.” Tony runs his hand through Steve’s hair. “To me this is the start of something.” He wants to touch all of Steve, know every expression, every inch of his body. “Let me touch you?”
“Do it,” Ross said, and the two scientists wheeled the vampire out, her dying eyes gazing at Steve. He shivered in his bonds.  The enforcer type V-Corps agent stayed. Ross studied Steve and then moved into the shadows where Steve could barely see him. “You see, your blood is very valuable.”
“Scott’s a chemical engineer 2 years out of prison. Let’s not base whether or not I’m going to get my sight back on his concerns,” Tony says. “Now come here and drink in my morning breath.”
Tony gasped for air as the laughter bellowed out of him. He swatted at Steve. “Wha- What!” He hit Steve until he stopped. Hiccuping for air, Tony rasped out. “What is wrong with you?” He wanted to protest more, but he found a strange warmth filling him, suffusing through him as Steve mingled his soul within Tony’s core. It shivered through him and he quaked in response. A drunkenness came over him and he relaxed into the cushions. “What are you doing?”
Blu nuzzles him next to his shoulder, yawns, but then gets back to his work of licking Tony all over. It’s terrifying and disgusting. When Tony shifts to move slowly away, the big paw squashes his movements and presses too firmly on his ribs. He moans at the touch and Blu eases his pressure. Blu stares down at him as if assessing his wounds, then tenderly licks the blood from Tony’s head.  Blu’s tongue lingers near Tony’s pulse point on his neck. Holding his breath, Tony cringes as he waits for the fatal bite.
Steve lifts a shoulder. “Not a lot of people dream about being a sex worker as a child. Things happened. The war for one. Back in the Brooklyn settlement there’s not much left due to lack of resources. I trained because I wanted to be an Artist in Residence – well, that was my big dream.”
Tony released Steve’s cock and a whimper of complaint was his answer. “Hey, come on, look at me.” Steve blinked a few times and then focused on Tony as he climbed back onto the couch. “I want to come with you.”
“I’ll talk to them,” Steve said and started toward the room. It was Natasha that stopped him with a hand on his arm.
“Then what is it you intend to do?” T’Challa asked. Was it a challenge or a question? Maybe it was both mixed up with the hell the world had become with America at its lead. T’Challa placed his juice on the table next to his chair. “I want to be helpful to you. I want to support you. But you must understand the pressures-.”
“What Stark wants, Stark gets?” Steve says. “Listen, Nick, I don’t have a lot of time and I have more to do than I want to explain right now. Just let it ride.”
“It would be good if we had some opponents, but since we do not, I think we must work in pairs and over a distance. In this way we may be able to coordinate and do these war games you wish,” Thor said and scooped up another bowl of pasta. Clint flinched and then stood up.
“I’m not sure what you mean,” Steve replies but keeps his eyes keenly away from meeting Tony’s gaze. The flush of heat to his cheeks screams his embarrassment loud enough. He adjusts the straps on his holster for the shield. “Which way?”
Steve jerks to the side and there’s the stranger again, but he’s standing (how did he jump over there) and he’s washing his hands with a rag and the bowl of water set near the pitcher on the table.
Thankfully, Steve sleeps most of the way back to the States, only waking for bio breaks and to scarf down as much food as he can. This seems to please Tony and eases the lines in Natasha’s features. Part of Steve’s happy to see Tony gratified with his progress but he recognizes this must be part of his nature. He wonders if this means the gland is starting to function. His cheeks warm again. He doesn’t want another heat. Ever again. He might need to ask about suppressants.
He recalls what Steven told him only a week ago. Omegas could procreate. They could father children or they could birth children depending on their sex. No omega today in civilized society could do that anymore. Omega lineage is something of a misnomer. All alphas try to ensure a number of omega children in their clan. The genetics are not straightforward. From what he understands of the biology it is a multiple allelic heredity. Some alphas and even some betas carry the recessive alleles for omegas. Those secondary alphas and betas who are identified in the clan are usually paired in order to ensure an adequate number of omegas. Of course, many times omegas are just rounded up from the Purge Rim and brought to the inner worlds.
“Who?” Tony shouldn’t ask, because some part of him already knew. He watched Howard for years. Every part of Tony as a young child emulated his dad. He wanted to be Howard. He desperately wanted to impress him.
Shaking his head, Tony snarls at him, “You don’t know me at all. I’ve told you that before.” With a look to his Master of the Fleet, Tony says, “Do it.”
“Shit,” Steve says. He presses the heels of his hands into his eyes. If the Captain reported Bucky’s status as MIA, it means it’s serious. It also means that while Steve’s been literally fucking around, Bucky’s dead or worse. He finds hot tears streaming down his face and he wipes them violently away. If he’d been a better man, a stronger man, not a weak sickly man, then maybe, just maybe Bucky would be safe.
“What do you mean, Steve?” Natasha whispered. The kindness touched her voice now with a stillness that meant tranquility and acceptance.
They’d already talked about this before dinner and now Steve spun back to the same place again. Tony took a count of three. He pulled away, not touching Steve anymore, slipping a space between their souls. “Let me get this straight. You’re going to take someone who used to be assassin, who might just be insane, and bring him to a cabin in the middle of nowhere and use what? Your Captain America voice to get him back?”
“Died. A few times. I kept coming back as a lion. It was really confusing and painful. But you saved me. You were there, you got me back. I’ll forever be grateful, Tony.” Steve speaks lowly as if he might tempt fate.
Going to Blood Dens, Tony took the sights of the preternatural world around him and drank his full. His path through the dens led the V-Corps onto his trail. He had to spend most of his time on the run. Pepper shuffled money around so he had access to his fortune, but it didn’t matter one bit when he met Steve in a Blood Den.
the other time, the other reality. Tony wonders if that means the other him, the other Tony is waking up, becoming aware, recovering from whatever they did to him. But then again, he doesn’t have to think
Tony pokes at his salad. “Oh, you mean you running around with a beard and split t-shirt down the chest as your uniform?”
“Get on your knees or I will have you caned.” The anger vibrates through him until he can barely take a breath. He’s tried to allow some leeway for Steven to express himself, to be the companion that Tony wants and needs, but outright defiance –especially now with the Council of Worlds just minutes away – cannot be tolerated.
“No, Tony. No. That’s not what I was saying.” Steve gets up and then slides into the booth on Tony’s side, forcing him to push in further toward the wall. He clasps both of Tony’s hands in his own. “That’s not what I was saying. I was saying that I can’t ever have hoped to be with you. I have nothing to offer. I’m an Army Vet with nightmares and a freelance comic book artist that can’t hold a job. I was lucky to have you pick me. Me! Of all the people you interviewed for the Personal Assistant job.
“Can you get the back gate open?” Steve asked and curved away from one of the cars as they tried to smash into the side of the Audi.
Riled up, Steve took the bull by the horns or in lay man’s terms, he went for it. He grabbed Tony’s face and pressed his lips to his mouth. It wasn’t the best kiss. Their teeth clacked and their noses bumped, but after the muffled huh from Tony, he eased right into the kiss and Steve pursued it even further.  All these months, years, of denial culminated into this moment. The hunger that grew in Steve from his earliest days overtook him. He hadn’t realized, had been blind to the truth, had fooled himself for too long. The kiss transformed into something wild and passionate.  He dragged his hands down Tony’s throat, clawed at his clothes. He would never have come up for air, happy to drown in the ecstasy of the moment. But it was Tony who stopped it, pushed him a way and gulped for air. Once he brought in enough breath, Steve moved again on him, but Tony pressed a hand to his chest and stopped him.
It seems peculiar that he’s nose blind to the smells of the food. Picking up the sandwich he bites into it as Tony watches, his eyes trained on Steve’s mouth. The first bite activates Steve’s salivary glands – but he tastes nothing. Nothing at all. His throat closes up again and his chest explodes with pain. He drops the sandwich, and it falls apart.
“Maybe he thinks he can change things. From what I understand, Steve Rogers is the eternal optimist when it comes to people. Believes in them and all,” Tony replied and couldn’t fathom why he was bothering with trying to defend that shithead that couldn’t even pick Tony to be part of his stupid soul pack. Inwardly, Tony berated himself for still trying to build up Steve Rogers and his stupid Captain America persona.
“Are we really doing this here?” Tony asked as he placed the shield on the floor, propping it up against the bed in which Steve currently slept. Tony hadn’t looked at him, hadn’t focused on the patient or the man he was now forever bonded to. Maybe he just couldn’t make it a reality. If he did how would he ever get out of it?
“I thought having a Personal Assistant meant that you got to take the Personal Assistant wherever you wanted,” Steve says. He does not want to fake date Tony. It’s a recipe for disaster. Natasha – who doesn’t even really know Steve – even said he is a terrible liar. It isn’t even that he can’t pull off pretending to date Tony for a night, but the idea of keeping his feelings tucked away – that’s the problem. He sighs. This is even the first time he’s even admitted that his subconscious thoughts are invading his conscious feelings.
“One of my employees thought of satellites that deploy drones to surveil and fight but what if someone gets their hands on it. They could manipulate it, cause all kinds of harm.”
Steve looks down at himself and then back up at Tony. His face is hard but also ashamed. “I don’t need new clothes.”
Tony set about digging through the old safe with all of his father’s papers and notebooks. He knew his father obsessed over things from the A-bomb to finding Captain America. Yet, he never expected to find much on vampires and their biochemistry. The little he’d found right after he’d became a vampire turned out to not be very enlightening and somewhat prejudicial. It hurt to look at – maybe he had been hoping for some kind of acceptance through the yellowed pages. What he’d found discouraged him and he locked all the papers away.
“Yeah?” Tony said, and he shared a critical eye with Pepper and Happy. “Does the specimen try to escape a lot?” Just what the fuck were they talking about here.
Tony tries to focus on what they're saying but he needs to battle down the nausea as he pictures Steve selling himself to these two idiots for their silence, as he imagines Steve on his knees with their fucking dicks in his mouth. It rules him - the anger and transposed shame. Without a second thought he grabs one of the decorative bombs and lobs it at the two shit heads. It explodes in one's face as the other ducks. But Tony's not finished yet he throws the next one like he's a major league pitcher sending a fast ball across home plate. It slams into the second moron, bursting as it does and the goon shudders, then collapses to the ground. Tony should check and see if he just committed murder, but he doesn't. Instead he slips through the door of the old factory, keeping down as he does, and then he tries to get his bearings as quickly as possible.
The man smiles shily and then looks down. When his gaze lifts, it’s through his long lashes. “Yes, your Blu.”
That seemed vague enough. He closed the connection and rolled his eyes. Nat would laugh at him – she was right. He had no idea how to lie. Without further delay, he put his helmet back on and started the engine of his motorcycle. A few hours on the road might help to clear his head.
Tony caressed the hand on his face. “You think someday we’ll get to this? You think someday we’ll love one another?”
“We all are Scott. We all are.” Steve shakes his head. He doesn’t know what he was looking for, but Scott’s not the route to find some peace. “Thanks, Scott.”
“Oh I’m sorry, dear. I can read it to you if you want?” Tony guesses by the woman’s voice she is probably older, in her early sixties.
Steve looks down at his boots and then back at Tony. “I’ll forgive you, if you’ll come have coffee with me at the Parlor Inn?”
“That I let you – in a dream? I have before. This is a dream, my dream – our dream. What’s so different now?” Steve touched his hand to the small of Tony’s back, drifting lower. “Please.”
Tony jerked out of his reverie and smiled. He stood up. He looked good. Strong. Whole. Ethereal. An otherness radiated from him like the corona of the sun. The aura was unmistakable, though it disappeared as Tony gathered himself and stepped over to Steve’s bedside. Closer, Steve studied the changes in his love. His eyes – the irises were gold flecked with reds. His hands and chest shimmered with a low light as if he held the flames of the dawn in the palms of his hands and within the cage of his breast.
They both startle at the sound of Nat’s voice and Steve’s legs give out. She rushes to his side and takes his other arm to put it over her shoulder.
“I don’t know, Bruce, I really don’t. I told you about the crackles?” Tony takes a sip of his coffee. It’s bitter and cold. “Well, there’s more. I’ve been getting this feeling like I’m being shadowed, like someone is stalking me. I get this image of like dark inky tentacles or vines coming after me. I don’t know.”
“You can’t go back in, Tony,” Natasha says and moves away from Sam. She grips the side of the gurney, her knuckles white with tension. “It was touch and go. We waited as long as we could before we pulled you out.”
He gasps a little and, for one horrifying moment, he thinks she knows that Captain America is turning tricks to survive. Yet, he knows that she would never leave him, never allow him to fall so far from grace if she knew. It has to be – “You believe he could have survived? That he -.”
A troop of V-Corps agents met them at the corner. Natasha flew into action as Tony flung the gurney toward the wall. The coven mistress grabbed one of the agent’s arms as he swung around to hit her with one of his wood spiked gloves. The air around her warbled, a high pitch whistle and then she yanked hard, pulling the guy at the same time she kicked him in the balls. Half of his body shifted through space and dimensions while the other half ended up lifeless on the floor. Without pause Natasha jumped on the next agent as the others scattered along the doorways and hallways of the corridor. That would make it more difficult to hit them, but Clint shot off two arrows as Tony felt the heat warm his palms. Natasha leapt onto one of the agents, swinging her legs over his head and then the air wobbled about her and she arched backwards into the void.
“It wasn’t always like this here, was it?” Thoughts of his loved ones passing through this place is horrible and foreboding that it hurts.
“Mind? No!” Tony says though he is a little disappointed. It means he’ll have to make himself scarce.
“Yes, sir. It seems as if that vestiges of the terrorists known as the Ten Rings have been pursuing the lion. The local radio in the area state that the new leader sees the lion as a prize to be taken, killed, and skinned. He wants to don the skin as a token of his strength.”
Steve smiles and reaches for the teacup, but Jarvis stays his hand. “Sheriff, I’ve brewed some coffee, if you would like?”
None of it makes any sense. A jumble of words – of letters mixed together in a soup and red with blood. He blinks and knows he faded out because the pretend doctor is no longer there. Only the lion.
Tony gets up with a scowl on his face and tends to the horse. He’s calling her Friday, but Steve’s not sure that’s the horse’s name.  He gets the horse tied to a thin pathetic looking sapling near the side of the path. When Tony rejoins Steve his eyes are fierce and he’s not taking no for an answer. He pulls out a flask.
“Not sure I want to. Would rather have the armor.” He tucks his hands under his armpits, through truth be told the getup he’s wearing is surprisingly comfortable and warm.
This little ritual clears out the fears, and allows his body to take over. Steve turns over and lays on the cold tiles. It startles but helps his growing need and desire. It cools it a little. Helps him overcome his need to thrust. He bends his legs and brings his knees to his chest and then opens his legs. Alpha tilts his head as he observes Steve. He leans down, grasps Steve’s cock, and jerks it a few times. It’s enough to harden him even more but not enough for him to come. Right now it feels a little too analytical to give him what he needs.
The monorail arrives and they board with the small talk and the comments about the standard business of the Stark family dissipating. Everyone feels the drain of the conference. Days and days on edge and trying to outwit everyone in the room eats at their souls. Seated, Tony sits and then glances up to see Steven standing over him – though there are open seats on the private rail. As Tony considers him, he picks up the alertness, the every present guardian stance, the way his shoulders move and his long legs stay planted on the floor even as the train car sways. He’s a wonder to behold.
When Steve opens his eyes, Tony’s not even looking at the pad anymore. His lips part. After a moment, he remembers to breathe, and he gasps the air. Silently and without looking at Happy he hands the tablet back. Happy smiles at Steve as if to impart some wise knowledge that Steve loses in translation. Before he can ask, Happy disappears into the foliage again.
“I’ll call. Don’t worry.” He gestures for her to get along with her work. “Oh, and remember you have that trip to the West Coast.”
He made Steve wait too long. He made himself wait too long. He’d denied a growing attachment, a love, and settled away from the Avengers. He needed rest, he needed peace, he convinced himself. Inside his chest he feels the roil of self-hatred, self-deprecation. Tony Stark never needed peace a day in his life. Denying the truth, denying that he needed the fight led to so much lost time. But once he accepted the fight in his soul, the spirit of a warrior, he’d come to his senses. It meant another upheaval in his life, but it also meant that Pepper was safe away from him, away from all this madness. Their split was amicable, and they stayed friends. It was good. Yet, Tony still gave his heart away.
“Well,” Jarvis replies and pauses. Tony imagines the slight tap of his feet on the floor as he sits and sips his nighttime cup of tea with his wife by his side. “When I first met Captain Rogers, I had my doubts. I knew he was an artist which greatly intrigued me, but I also knew from information Ms. Potts shared that he was not successful as in – he lived in a garret apartment, owed little, and did not have a regular job. In fact, most of his work was free-lance.”
Blu finds them a comfortable spot slightly up the hill from the small stream. It’s an old hollow of a huge tree. Tony can just about fit into it; Blu can’t at all. The other trees around them offer shelter. It will be enough for Tony to spend time repairing the HUD. It’s going to take more time than Tony would like, but luckily, he’s not an idiot and in the left thigh panel of the armor he built in tools for just this kind of emergency. It is the barest of essential tools but at least it’s something.  He wrenches the panel open and sets out the tools in the tree hollow. He can’t do much tonight; it’s getting too dark.
Tony stared blankly into the darkened room. He saw nothing, but the pain cleaved in his chest. “You go, who will come back?”
“Why should I?” Tony grapples with the argument. Steve witnesses as he goes from cold stone where he’s unwilling to move to raging fire where he’ll fight with his last breath. “You have sight. You don’t know how it is. I’m an inventor. I do R&D. How the hell am I supposed to do it without sight.”
“I’m grateful you brought your doctor here, you’re welcome to stay. I’m just the sheriff, trying to protect a town no one else cares about.”
“Did you know about him before we even got here?” Her face turns a little toward beet red, like she might thunk him in the head any minute for putting her through all of the stress of finding an appropriate omega on time.
“Well, thank you. I think it’ll better than nothing.” It is good, if a little gamey. He tears away the hide and digs into the meat of the thigh with his fingers; it’s hot and sizzling. It’s a lean meat but there’s a little fat to make it juicy. Maybe it’s the hunger but it tastes divine. He eats more than he probably should.
Clint twisted the controls, his biceps working to keep the helicopter under control. “Nat doesn’t need to drink. Well, not like Tony anyway. It’s been a while. She’s older so she can fast for longer.” Part of what he said sounded rote as if he’d practiced it too often.
“We both know you broke the rules, Rogers. Now get over to Bruce and have him take your blood sample.” She never turns to face him; the blue light of the aquarium an eerie glow about her.
Not able to make heads or tails of it, Tony goes to the kitchen cleans up and then heads back downstairs to fix the mess of wiring in the house. At least it’s something to do while Steve is sulking or whatever. They’d all promised not to bring their Avengers equipment with them, that meant no armor for Tony. All he really has is his phone link to Friday and his tablet. While he sits and sorts through the wires he gathered, he sends a text to Maria Hill.
Friday announces that Pepper has responded. “Steve left. We don’t know where he went. It’s for the best, Tony.”
Tony rubs at his eyes and then releases a heavy breath. “Jesus. I just don’t know. This is like fighting myself.”
“I assume you mean Han Solo and Chewbacca.” Tony grumbles as he searches for The Empire Strikes Back. “You are in luck because the best movie of the franchise is the next one.”
“That sounds nice, plus I am getting the downward part of the curve for my hunger.” He finishes the potatoes and tosses them on a rack in the oven with the chicken.
Tony grasps his hand and brings it to his lips. “Steve, what happened to us? I am so sorry I let it get this far, that I let my -.” He stops, visibly winces before he continues, “I let my damned biology get in the way. Don’t leave me now.”
Tony closes his eyes as if that will do anything to wipe away his embarrassment. He rubs at his nose and then his face, running his hands through the mess of his hair. “No. I can get there on my own. Just leave the mess. Jarvis will get it in the morning.” His hands feel so cold. The world is so distant, so very far away.
“Can I? Would it be possible to try again?” Steve searched his face, his eyes flickering around Tony as if he couldn’t believe what he saw or touched. “It’s just a dream, I know. But can I try again?”
Thinking of Tony brings on a mix of emotions from the need for Steve to be by his side to the memories of Tony shooting off Bucky’s arm. Everything hurts when he thinks of Tony. But the fact remains that he was – is no longer bonded to Tony because of the dissection of his gland by the mad scientists. When he finally found Bucky again, his biology reared its ugly head and he could not defy it any more than he could throw back the force of the tides. What his body signaled to him, he might very well take to the grave. He doesn’t want to think about it now, and instead, he heads toward the mating blocks.
“I don’t,” he replied. “I worked side by side with Vampires during the war. The real war, WWII. We wouldn’t have won against Hydra or the Nazis without vampires.”
“And the best part is, you get to stay up and watch me,” Tony smiles as he locks the case. How he found everything he wanted, Steve hasn’t a clue.
Narrowing his focus and drilling down to his gutted feelings, Tony replies, “I want to know why. I want to understand you. You don’t act like any omega I know, not even Clyn, Nat’s omega. You act like you command a team. But at the same time, you’re broken and lost.” For the first time, Tony remembers the bottle of bourbon in his hand. He offers it to Steven. “Drink. Drink until you get drunk. Maybe a little truth serum will help.”
“Because you threatened his children, you bastard,” Steve jeered. “What kind of man uses innocent children as a tool to get what he wants?”
She could go for the cheap shot, but Pepper never stoops so low. “Well, I think you should reconsider asking him to do this. He’s not your toy to play with. He’s an employee.”
“You’re a tease and I need to study.” Steve’s pupils are blow wide and he’s panting hot and heavy over Tony. His gazes searches for somewhere to land.
Steve nodded. While Steve missed Natasha’s words of wisdom, he needed some right now. As Companion, Sam could step into almost every other role (except for Beloved according to his reading).  Steve touched the soul bond between them, seeking and asking for more. He folded his hands and asked. “So what does that mean to you? That Bucky is Brother?”
“Help who? And why?” Tony crossed his arms over his chest, fully aware that he closed himself off both physically and through their soul bond, but sometimes it was necessary.
“Yeah with that ability to change into anyone, sure.” She nods. “It works for him. I heard he gets some hefty tips. Oh, did the prince offer you anything?”
“Well, let’s get to it. We’re burning daylight.” The landscape around them looks too perfect, every blade of grass, all the leaves in the trees – nothing blends together. “I think you should have consulted an artist when you designed the entrance.” He walks away from the Door. Keeping the Door directly behind him must be the best strategy, but he doesn’t know for sure. It’s not like he’s spent much time playing video games.
“Got it in one. And he’s not supposed to use anything because we’re trying to see if we allow some time before he uses it again if we can decrease the side effects like migraines and prolong the use of his glasses beyond the 3 plus hours it was at during the beginning of August. The time was deteriorating.”
Tony stops, considers, and then says to one of the guards, “Vanko, please purchase whatever you believe is needed for new recruits on the Avengers. Please spare no expense.”
Steve had access into the compound. The retinal scan and blood sample from a finger prick opened the secured gates. Clint drove the sedan to a parking spot in the small garage and, as Steve opened the car door, he heard the doors to the garage close. Previously, Steve called Tony on the burner phone Sam gave them to detail the car and their arrival time. The whole place, the woods, the meadows, everything was rigged to spot and defend. Clint jumped out of the car and smiled at Steve. They’d known each for years now, and Steve swore he never saw Clint in the safe house – though that was to be expected since it was Tony’s and not actually the coven’s place. Tony had once said he built it years before he was turned, as a haven to get away from the paparazzi and, as far as Steve knew, it stayed secure from the eyes of the outside world.
“You fucking put me back in there or I swear I will rip the interface out myself!” Tony screams at Cho. She startles back from his vehemence but she’s not backing down.
Steve waves off the idea of expanding his medical visit. “Not really. I left abruptly so I really have to get back.”
Tony slips his hand away from Steve’s and moves off the stool. He curls his hands into the hoodie pockets and says, “I know.”
“Yeah, good. He’s gonna be fine.” Tony peers over his shoulder and the idea of Steve hurt and letting someone hurt him jabs into his chest like a hot poker. “Do you, do you know he lets that guy hurt him?”
Steve furrows his brow because nothing Tony is stating actually makes much sense. “So you’re telling me that you’re going to force me to go with you because of this law and that you’re going to enact my punishment, like I’m a two year old?” There’s a part of Steve that’s still scrawny and ready to beat on anything within arm’s swinging distance. He forces himself to remember that he’s recovering from having his gland re-implanted – or regrown – he really doesn’t know.
“Yeah, yeah.” Tony’s expression softens. “You know he’s gruff and hard now, but back in the day when I was only a little kid maybe 7 or 8 standard years and Howard started to drink – it was Obie who taught me the basics of thermodynamics when I nearly blew myself up making a simple combustion engine.” He chuckles. “Then he brought me to my first space race. Never saw anything like it. He even gave me the sex talk. Hated that I preferred guys over gals, but he still tried. Told me I should focus on the gals for the preservation of the line. Even in this day and age. He’s positively medieval sometimes.” Even though the subject matter had negative connotations, Tony’s demeanor and tone remains positive. “He’s a good man. A little gruff nowadays, but the stress of having to deal with me all these years can’t be easy.”
“Doesn’t work.” Tony considers the idea formulating between them. “If the UN would buy into it, we could deploy Avengers throughout the world.”
With more lube he pushes in the third finger. Tony writhes beneath them, hungry and greedy for him, his cock actively dipping against his belly. Steve bends forward and licks the pre-come. Tony sobs.
He retracted as fast as he could, closing it off, shutting down, building walls around it. He didn’t think Natasha or Bruce saw it. But as he opened his eyes, Wong studied him, his mouth in a tight pucker, his eyes studious and dark.
Steve nods and grasps the prince’s elbow to lead him through the tight passageway toward the back service elevator. Tony leans in close and whispers, “How hurt are you?”
“He’s been talking crazy in his sleep,” Tony says. Who is this person? Why is she here? “Are you here to get us out?”
He scrambled under the bed linens with his tiny flashlight that Jarvis had given him. With a flick of the switch Tony illuminated the small stuffed animal. It had a beautiful mane just the color of a golden sun and a long tail that had a puff of blonde and dark strands on it, but most of all it had the bluest eyes Tony had ever seen. He wanted to know everything about the lion that appeared on the coast of frozen Norway. Tomorrow he would search for books at the library – but he would have to beg Jarvis to take him. It wasn’t library day. It was museum day and Tony didn’t want any of that. Sure staring at paintings might be interesting for old people but he hated to just sit there and not touch them.
“She’s an Avenger. I’m not surprised that you would bond with your team, your soul pack.” Fury sat up straighter in the chair, leaning his elbows on the desk. “This is your first step, Captain. The world around you changed, but this, this will guide you.”
When he arrives home and walks through the wide glass doors, Steve’s sitting in the lounge. His face brightens as soon as Tony enters. He stands up and puts his hands behind his back as if he’s in parade rest. “Tony. I didn’t know if I’d see you tonight.”
He shrugs it off and then taps the countertop. “You are allowed to eat.” It looks like his guest is partially comatose or playing with idea of going catatonic. “Steve.” Tony tilts his head to get a glimpse of Steve. “What’s going on?”
Bucky only twisted his mouth in muted glee at Sam’s turn of phrase. Tony rolled his eyes and assured, “Yes. We’ve come to an understanding.” He tried to step around Sam, but a hand on his arm stopped him.
Sam frowned and then said, “No.” He elongated the o. “Not at all. It’s advice from someone’s whose been there, done that.” Sam glanced at Steve who had walked up further to the front of the jet as the final flight checks were initialized. “He’s going after them regardless of what you say. Just watch out for him. That’s your job.”
He rested on the bed; his mind wheeled around like a creaking grocery cart. No matter how hard he tried it drove him around in circles. He always ended up on Steve and whether or not it was fair to have him mated. The mating bonded him to Tony. It shifted Steve’s view points of the world. That’s not to say that Steve had been an arrogant asshole and prejudice against the undead. Tony witnessed his breakdown about the world and the state of the undead himself. Yet being bound to the undead made his life more dangerous. It was illegal for any vampire to mate with a human. He knew it by heart, all human children did. It was a warning. Like the times in the old days when kids would have to do nuclear war drills and hide under their desks. It terrified children. He recalled coming home from school weeping about the evil vampires waiting to suck his blood and make him into their slave.
Steve sat up and slipped his legs over the side of the bed. His head felt like someone knocked it with rocks a few times. “How long?”
“I don’t know,” Steve says and his gland pulses and his brow sweats. Heat is very close. “I didn’t realize.”
“Touch me, Tony, I want you to touch me, and then I want you. Will you, please?” Steve says and he knows he’s out of his right mind with desire. This is forbidden, and he’s falling straight into Lucifer’s waiting arms.
Steve closed the book and put it on the table between them. “We’re all a little part of the problem. We’re so used to doing things, getting the job done, on our own, doing it our own way, I don’t think we know how to function as a group.”
“Doctor Banner?” Wong said. “You’ve done something similar to this before when you were able to bring Mister Barton from the edge of darkness when his way was lost.”
“I’ve never seen a wound fester in a matter of hours,” Natasha says. “What kind of knife was it and why did it go bad so quickly?”
“Yeah. In the garage. It’s an oldie of a goodie. Classic. 1942 Harley-Davidson WLA. Got some nice additions I designed myself.” He’s enjoying the reveal himself.
“You didn’t give me all of the resources I need to get through this scenario,” Steve says and the dossier is back in his hands. He tosses it down and points to it as if it is some kind of war prize. “I can’t do my mission if I don’t know all the details.”
“Lord, Tony,” Steven had said and grabbed his arm. They were in the dining room but to the side as the dinner was breaking into smaller groups. The musicians had taken the stage and the light sounds of the orchestra playing filtered through the cooling summer night. The huge ballroom had more than twenty tables that sat ten people each. Waiters still whisked through the room with trays of finger desserts and after dinner wines and other drinks. Tony only sipped wine. Steven had given of his gland several times during the day. It had been invigorating but he could see the telltale signs of it wearing on his omega.
“What drop down? What’s this all about?” the Captain says in his very captainy voice. Tony has got to stop reading Avengers’ fanfiction in his free time. He really needs to get a date, or get laid, or something.
Fury nearly growled at Tony. They’d come to an agreement after all, that if Tony took Steve on as his Submissive and the bond sealed it, then the price to pay was his silence. The world would never know that Steve Rogers aka Captain America knelt at Tony’s feet, that he most gratefully licked Tony’s shoes or even groveled with his forehead to the floor – the standard and accepted form of greeting to a Dominant from a Submissive.
"Can you clamp that down, while I clean this out?" Natasha says and Steve shifts to see the spurt of blood from the gaping wound. The doctor works to do as Natasha asks but Bucky holds onto consciousness making it difficult.
“How about lung pain?” Bruce puts down the blood reader. “Do you want to do some pulmonary tests while you’re here?”
“Divert the Fleet to find one lost soldier? How would that look for the most powerful prince in the Conclave?” Steve shakes his head and sniffles. He’s crying again. “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have ruined this for you. I’m a mess today.”
