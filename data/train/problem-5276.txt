“Really?” Cas asked with a hopeful look.
The two turned their heads to face each other, noses almost touching.
Instead, there was Jack, standing at the TV, grinning from ear to ear. Cas walked over to Dean with a smirk and held out both his hands. Dean handed him a beer in one hand and took the other in his own. Cas then led him to his favorite recliner and settled down in the other.
The short drive was silent until Cas said, “Here,” in front of a white house. It was nice, definitely nicer than Dean’s home. Though, he was surprised Cas didn’t live in the fancier part of town where he knew Cas’s friends all came from.
“It turns out that I am the chef and Jack is the food critic,” Cas explained, groaning as he got up from couching at the little stove. He set a plate of plastic food in front of Jack. “Bon appetit, Mr. Jack.” Cas bowed at the toddler and then glared at Dean when he began shaking with laughter.
“Dean, you shouldn’t be calling it a monster in front of Jack. He should learn that it’s just another living being and we can all live in harmony,” Cas retorted, tilting his head in the way that said,
“June 28th and July 22nd - for two pi and the fraction of pi, twenty-two over seven, in day/month format,” Eileen explained.
“Thank you, chef,” Jack said with a little head nod before he tucked his napkin into his shirt collar.
Cas gave Dean a kiss on the cheek and whispered “thank you” in Dean’s ear.
, Dean thought, to anyone and everyone who helped make this day possible, whether they could be here or not.
“Really?” Jack asked as he bounced on his toes with his hands shaking.
Dean rubbed the back of his neck and made the mistake of making a quick glance at Cas's lips. He could kiss him right now.
Before stepping up to meet Cas, he glanced at Jack who gave him a huge smile and a double thumbs-up. They were going to be a real family now and Dean made a silent promise in that moment to be a good dad to Jack - to be the dad he wished he had himself.
"Hey, do you need a ride? I'm assuming the bus is long gone." Dean called to Cas, secretly hoping for some reason he'd say yes.
Thank you so much for reading!
Cas rolled his eyes at Dean’s gesture. “How about a new chef, Jack? I bet Dean would love to take a go at it!” Cas suggested, and to his relief Jack nodded excitedly in response.
“We’re going to have to bring Jack over to Garth for a dentist visit if he eats all this,” Cas said, gesturing to the pile of candy bags they returned from the store with. Dean assured Cas that they would help so Jack wouldn’t eat it all himself.
“Of course not, but it’s a nice coincidence,” Dean replied, stuffing a forkful of now cherry pie in his mouth.
“And?” Eileen and Dean said at the same time. The two smiled knowingly at each other as they each grabbed a slice.
Cas turned on his side to look at Dean. He was Cas's best friend, and now his husband - the human he gave everything for. Somehow everything that happened led them here. Though, ironically, "normal" was, and always will be, a very odd word for them. But here they were, doing it, being normal.
After that first game, Jack wanted to play ping pong all the time - the kid was pretty good at it too. Cas and Dean played with him at least a few times a day, every day. Things got even more hectic once Jack started telling everyone about the family’s new hobby.
What intrigued Dean about Cas the most was that he often seemed to be in his own world. He liked to draw in his notebooks, Dean observed. Every once in a while, Cas would raise his head up to nod in agreement with the discussion or shift to take a few notes. He was obviously intelligent, but he wasn't one to show off his knowledge in class like the others. He rarely answered questions, but the teacher must have trusted him to have done all the readings since she never called on him either.
"Do you think he'll be able to find this?" Cas asked as he tucked an egg under Miracle's bed.
“Here we are! Some sweet, sweet pie! I got a cherry for all of us to share, and then some slices of blueberry, pecan, key lime, cream, and apple,” Dean exclaimed, setting down all the boxes on the table and then rubbing his hands together.
Dean pointed at Sam and Eileen. “Well, mark your calendars because you guys are coming over and we’re going to be celebrating again. This day just keeps getting better!” Dean said as he held a forkful of cream pie out for Cas to try. He smiled when Cas leaned in to take a bite and got some cream on his lips. “And happy one month, Cas,” Dean whispered, going in for a kiss to clean Cas up.
Dean wrapped his arms around Cas from behind, resting his chin on his shoulder.
“You don’t need to apologize, but I’d like that,” Dean said, handing Cas his notebook back. Their hands brushed and time seemed to stop as they their eyes met once again.
Cas was about to reciprocate when he pulled back quickly, making Dean sulk even more. “Dean, stop pouting, I have an idea.”
“Hey, hey, I don’t mind taking it slow, you know. Don’t think we have to jump into anything. I already told you I’m all yours.” Dean said, catching his breath.
Cas shifted up on his elbow to give Dean a kiss on the temple. "Honestly, no. For many reasons, I never saw us here," Cas confessed.
While waiting for the guests to arrive, Cas joined Dean as he stared up at the sign. “Do you know how badly I want to tell everyone how this all started?” Dean asked with a smirk.
"Hey, I know how hard it is to talk in class. I only like taking on questions I definitely know the answer to, like in math. Explaining your inner thoughts about books, which are already up for interpretation, can be difficult. Especially if you know there are some rude people around." Cas rolled his eyes at the last part which made Dean feel even better.
“Daddy is making me food!” Jack yelled while banging his hands happily on the table.
"Don't be stubborn, try it!" Cas was getting frustrated now that he clearly had two babies to deal with.
Cas smiled a little and rolled his eyes. Then, he looked nervous again as he paused. "Um, do- do you look at me in class? Or do you just catch me looking at you - I mean not that I'm looking at you...uh I just feel like we lock eyes a lot and I didn't know if I was creeping you out or-" Cas rambled, waving his hands around with every stumbling word.
"Dean," Cas squirmed. He rolled away from Dean on the bed and sat up, ready for revenge. "You better be careful. I built you piece by piece, so I know all your weaknesses," he threatened, holding his hands up towards Dean.
“Much better. I read that using positive words is good for babies, especially as they learn to talk,” Cas explained, picking up a stuffed animal frog and putting it away in the toy bin.
"Good job! Now daddy's going to put in the baking soda and a pinch of salt." Jack impatiently watched Cas stir the ingredients since he knew what came after.
Dean thought.
Dean and Cas looked in a mix of shock, horror, and amusement at the 2 inch burn mark that was now on the wall. The kid had obliterated the poor thing.
“Remember when we put on
There was a silence between them. Dean rubbed the back of his neck. "Yeah, I guess that’s true…um..." He didn’t know what else to say. As much as he stared at Cas in class, he knew very little about him and they definitely had never talked one-on-one before.
“Cas, I don’t want to play around with fake food and get harshly judged!” Dean whispered.
“I don’t know how you can tell how it’s looking, but I agree. So, are you going to handle the scary monster? Or am I?” Dean asked nodding his head towards the window. Jack turned towards them with his eyes wide when he heard the words ‘scary monster’.
“Ah I see. English still proves to be one of the most confusing languages. Trust me, I know them all,” Cas stated, signing at Eileen who started laughing again.
, Dean thought. This was just a study time to go over a book, nothing more.
Jack was buzzing with excitement when Cas and Dean explained Easter and the subsequent egg hunt to him. They started the clock as they set the kid free to go searching.
Cas rolled his eyes and then laughed. “You better not say a word. If this all works, then we will play our own round later tonight,” he said, winking as he left to go answer the door.
The vanilla was added and so far, all the ingredients made it in the bowl without disaster.
, Dean thought.
Cas opened his mouth to reply but then Jack screamed. Cas rushed over to him and noticed the spider had dropped down from the window sill and was hanging by a thread of webbing very close to Jack’s face.
The three settled down at a picnic table, waiting for Dean to return with the pies. They figured it was best to let him have free rein at an event basically designed for him. Dean walked back to the table with several boxes precariously balanced in his arms.
“Cas, these are…wow. I’m flattered and impressed. I can’t draw for shit and meanwhile you’re making portraits in class,” Dean laughed, bumping Cas’s shoulder.
Cas then pinned him down and gave him another quick kiss. “I have to go tell Jack about the cat, Dean,” he said getting up from the bed, leaving Dean alone, tired, and a little turned on.
As he walked towards the parking lot, Dean fished for his keys inside his backpack. When he looked up and spotted the Impala, he stopped. There was Cas, just standing by his car and reading a book.
“Thank you, Cas and Dean, for coming to this presentation. As you can see, I really think we should get a cat.” Jack clicked to the next slide and a list appeared. “So first, cats are very soft and fluffy and that’s nice. A cat would also be a good friend for me, and I would have fun playing with it. And finally, I think a cat would really bring this family together,” Jack outlined.
Dean felt fingers running softly through his hair. They were gentle, soothing. Suddenly, he opened his eyes, remembering where he was and what he was previously doing. Sensing Dean’s jerk awake, Cas removed his hands from Dean and looked down at him. Dean turned his head to meet Cas’s eyes.
Dean woke up with Cas staring over him. He was perched on his elbow in bed looking down at Dean with his signature squint and head tilt.
"Did you ever see us here?" Dean thought aloud as he looked up at the ceiling.
“This is an awesome car, Dean,” Cas said, breaking the silence between them as they got in.
, Cas reflected as he watched Jack mix as hard as his little arms could.
“Sorry about that. It’s just her and I, so she's very invested in my life.” Cas was looking everywhere but Dean. “We can head to my room. I have all my notes on the reading up there.”
Jack went off to bed and Cas turned to Dean and gave him a kiss. “Ready to play some ping pong?”
Jack reached below his chair and picked up a clipboard and pen. “Gimme a minute and then I will give you a star rating,” he said, waving Cas off with his small hand.
, he thought.
"Cookies! Cookies!" Jack yelled in Cas's ear.
On the way home, Cas and Dean again went over everything they had researched about Easter online. They had the eggs, candy, basket, and even a bunny, so that seemed to cover the bulk of it.
"Love you too!" Jack yelled back. He turned to look at Cas with his wide eyes. "Now cookies?"
Cas titled his head a bit and gave Dean that pity look again. “Well even if you can take it, doesn't mean that you should."
"Hey," Dean whispered.
Jack pretended to eat the food very carefully, pausing to ponder about the imaginary taste. Cas was standing above Jack with a hint of nervousness on his face.
“Yes!” Jack exclaimed. This is where it started to snowball.
Dean knocked lightly on Cas's door. "Hey Cas?"
“I can do a real sketch of you sometime. An apology for all the staring," Cas offered.
“You usually dress comfy for these movie nights,” Cas said, using air quotes around the word ‘comfy’. “So, I saw these clean clothes in the laundry room and thought I’d give it a try.” He hesitantly made his way over to his side of the couch. Dean smiled and patted the seat next to him and Cas settled himself in. He realized he was still staring at Cas and quickly turned back to the TV.
Instead of racing out of the classroom, today Dean packed his bag slowly at the bell. He jumped as he felt a hand touch his left shoulder.
It was Jack's idea for the wedding to be on Valentine's Day. "It's the most special day for love of the year!" he had said as soon as he found out that Dean and Cas were planning on getting married. Neither of them had a good argument against it, so Valentine’s Day it was.
Sam and Eileen wanted in on the game and came over for dinner later that week, playing ping pong well into the night. When Dean told them they didn’t have to keep playing, Sam just smiled and shrugged as Eileen smacked the ball in the far right corner for the win. “We’re having fun!” Sam said with Eileen nodding in agreement.
"Really? I think you'd do well there. Your takes are more advanced than high school honestly. There are supposedly less jerks in college too because you get to take classes that you’re interested in,” Cas explained.
"Hey, Cas?" Dean called out.
Cas seemed to pick up on the awkwardness and looked at the ground. “Would you like to go over the next book with me?" he blurted out.
"I told you, I read it in the books. Babies smell fear." Cas laughed and gave Dean a hug and a kiss. Dean was grumpy, but also had a smile on his face. Guess this parenting thing wasn't
“Wow, I guess it’s already been a month! Well, this is a great way to celebrate, isn’t it Cas?” Dean smiled, bumping Cas’s shoulder.
Two words that sound alike.
. Dean groaned as the family got the day going.
Cas shook his head and smiled. “Tell me about it. He threatened to call the health department on my last meal.”
Jack's cups were overflowing, but it worked out since the extra landed outside of the bowl, as he decided to drop the flour in from high above. He looked up at Cas with a big smile. "Sugar!" Jack then announced, remembering the next ingredient. This time, he carefully dumped the cups Cas handed him into the bowl, proudly clapping after.
"Let's have a movie night, just the two of us," Dean suggested, hoping Cas would agree without asking any further questions. Sam was going out with Eileen tonight; this was their chance to be alone with time for Dean to prepare.
"I, uh, need you to know that...even though I pulled back a little after you returned...I do want it. I do want us. I was scared. Of course I was scared. You know I don't let myself be happy." Dean paused and took a deep breath. He pushed himself off of Cas's lap and turned to face him on the couch. He wanted to look Cas in the eye when he said what came next. Cas stared at Dean, his blue eyes wide and soft in both curiosity and anticipation.
There were little sketches all over, but Dean found his face scattered throughout. There was a sketch of him taking notes, him smiling, and even one with his pen in his mouth. They may have been just pencil doodles, but there was no mistaking the likeness.
, Dean thought.
“Yeah, sure, we can watch that,” Dean agreed, lifting the remote to start the movie. It was a dark movie, but also an easy one for both of them to watch.
It was late once they hid all the eggs as they tried to find more tricky places. Cas and Dean collapsed in their bed exhausted from their preparations.
“Cas, I’m running late, but there’s some money on the counter for pizza and- oh! Who’s this?” Mrs. Novak stopped in front of Dean, looking between him and Cas.
"No, I have debate club in a few minutes. But thank you though!" Cas called back with a wave.
“Jack, look! A big scary monster!” Dean said pointing to a tiny spider slowly climbing up the living room wall. Jack screeched in fear and fascination as he crawled over to it. He flapped his hands and watched the spider move towards the window.
Cas squinted up at Sam. “They dislike gay people?”
Dean walked over and gave Jack a kiss on the forehead and Cas a kiss on the lips. "Alright you two, be good. And try not to make too big of a mess," Dean said sternly, bringing two fingers up to his eyes and then pointing them at Cas and Jack.
Dean didn’t respond. He knew Charlie was right, but he also wanted to avoid what was coming next. In class that afternoon, they received their schedule for the next reading, which meant that soon he was going to have to hang out with Cas to discuss the book. So, instead of going right to his car, Dean met Charlie in the library, hopefully the last place Cas would search for him - if he was even trying to find Dean.
Jesus.
“Wow, I get a kiss
“It’s up pretty well I think,” Cas laughed, winking.
"Do you think he's excited to make cookies?" Cas sarcastically asked Dean.
Dean reflected.
“How’s it up?” Dean stammered as he approached Cas, immediately realizing how messed up that came out. “Oh man, I was going to say, ‘how’s it going’ or ‘what’s up’ and that came out instead.” Dean was already hot in the face.
------------
Dean spent the rest of the day cleaning their room, making some coffee and breakfast, taking a shower, and even glancing at a few books. He had not seen Cas or Jack since getting up and was starting to get suspicious. It was never good when the bunker was quiet, especially if Cas was with Jack, or even Sam. Luckily, Sam was visiting Eileen and couldn’t get involved in whatever schemes were brewing in the bunker. He loved Cas very much, but sometimes that angel could cause some chaos.
“Pi and pie are homophones,” Sam elaborated to Cas.
Dean joined Sam who gave him a slap on his shoulder. "I'm so happy for you, man."
There was little interaction after their reunion, anyway, once Cas found out what happened to Jack. Cas needed to go see him and Dean was grateful for the time to recalibrate. He feared opening up to Cas and he feared letting himself be happy. Dean didn't want things to necessarily change between the two of them, but he also didn't want to not explore what could be their future.
“Well, I’m sold,” Cas said with a teasing look to Dean.
“Yes, I was able to extract a little bit of grace for you to always hold on to,” Cas explained as Dean chuckled and shook his head in wonderful disbelief.
Dean was intelligent - he

Dean didn’t know what he just agreed to, but he did know that it would make his little family happy and that’s all that mattered.
"Hey...why does this cookie only have two chocolate chips in it?" Dean questioned, examining his cookie.
“This?” Cas asked as he began stroking Dean’s hair again.
"Give me the spoon," Dean demanded, holding out his hand to Cas. He was going to get this baby to eat and was determined to do so without having to eat a damn bite himself.
Jack changed slides again and now there was ginger long-haired cat on the screen with the words MR FANCYPANTS below. “So, this is Mr. Fancypants. I found him on the internet, and he is the cat I would like. He is 2 years old and lives in a shelter 10 miles away. They say he plays well with children and likes to sit on laps. Oh, and also for Dean, he is a Siberian, so he is hypoallergenic.” Jack said the last sentence with a matter-of-fact look directed right at Dean. Dean couldn’t help but smile. Cas grabbed his hand again and gave it a squeeze.
Cas sighed as Dean walked over to Jack, pulling his shirt over his nose. Jack was still clapping at his fine work.
“Well, if we’re confessing things now…” Dean started, fumbling with the pen in his hands. “I’m not just looking around the room. I'm kind of looking at you too.”
Dean was the one to first bring up the whole "let's get married thing". He knew Cas wouldn't care either way, but Dean wanted Cas to know how much he was loved and prove his commitment to him in a more tangible, and very human, way. It was also a great excuse to get their family all together, drink, and have a night of fun. Of course, the whole marriage thing is purely symbolic since Dean is legally dead and Cas is a 400 million-year old angel – a fact Cas brought up several times. But Dean didn’t care; he just wanted to marry his best friend.
"Good luck," Cas said as he handed Dean the spoon and rolled his eyes.
he thought
Dean needed to take a walk after that which put their Easter efforts on hold for an hour. When he came back, Cas apologized and promised to make it up to Dean later, which turned his mood right around.
He told himself he wasn’t going to cry in front of everyone, but Dean couldn’t help it as Cas read his vows. They both had tears streaming down heavily by the time Dean finished reading his. The vows were beautiful, cheesy, and were culminations of a decade spent together but not yet
Dean shrugged. All spiders were bad to him, venomous or not, and he definitely couldn’t tell the difference.
Jack found all the eggs in under 10 minutes. It would have been in under 5 had Miracle not taken one of the eggs and ran around the house with it while Jack chased him. He definitely used some of his angel mojo to find them because Dean thought they had done a decent job hiding.
"Why can't you eat it? He worships you anyway," Dean whined. He wasn't joking either. Jack attached himself to Cas right away - must be an angel thing.
“What’s going on you two?” Dean questioned, taking a swig of beer and looking between Cas and Jack.
Cas returned from visiting Jack four days later. Luckily, Sam was around again, so Dean and Cas weren't alone just yet. He couldn't keep avoiding Cas, but he also needed to ease into it and be prepared - have it be on his call.
The two weeks until Friday the 8th were agonizing. Dean had to keep himself occupied: he actually tried paying attention in his classes, worked on his car after school, and tried not to get caught looking at Cas every day in last period. That task turned out to be difficult since it seemed like Cas was looking at him too, but Dean was probably imagining it to make himself feel less creepy.
“Well, if Jack really wants one, he’s gotta show us he’s prepared for it. Also, I’m allergic, remember, so the cat has to be hypoallergenic,” Dean said pointedly. He knew that a cat was an easy pet, but he still didn’t want to be the one constantly taking care of it or sneezing all the time.
"Because, Dean, he needs to see you eat it. I think he senses your fear. He won't do it unless you do. I read it in one of the books," Cas explained, clearly trying to also get out of eating the green mush.
Cas never laughed, though. He would look at Dean in earnest, tilting his head, like he was encouraging Dean to get the words out. At least, that's what Dean imagined. Cas was probably just confused and trying to understand what the hell Dean was sputtering.
Jack ran over to Miracle and hugged him. "Yes!" He turned to be face to face with the dog. "I'm going to hide them so good Miracle. Even better than how daddies did!“ Jack explained.
“I’m just saying, there were several reasons why people followed him” Cas replied, shrugging.
Finally, it was Friday and Dean could not keep his leg from bouncing in class. He kept glancing between the clock and Cas. He wondered if Cas was as nervous as he was.
“Cas, we need to find a new phrase - and not another game. I’m not doing a badminton tournament next month.”
“Thanks, uh, it’s my dad’s car. I like to work on it after school. Probably why I never get my homework done on time,” Dean half-joked. He glanced over and Cas smiled at him, making Dean’s stomach flip.
“Come back in five minutes and then Jack has something to show you,” Cas called back.
Cas knelt down and grabbed a piece of candy from the pile. “So, Jack, did you have fun hunting for eggs?"
"Dean c'mon, please? For Jack?" Cas pleaded, holding a tiny green jar.
When he walked out the bathroom, Dean was standing right in his path, eagerly waiting to hear the results. “So?” Dean asked.
“No. Dean and I stopped hunting.” Sam’s mind was going a thousand miles an hour. “Wait a minute. Have you been the one that’s been stalking me?” It made so much sense now. He wasn’t losing it. He knew someone was watching him, it had to of been Becky.
“Me, first,” she insisted. “I don’t think it would be a good idea if I moved in with you. My mental health is already not the best, and I can’t imagine what it would do to me if I lived with you long term,” she explained. “So, I am respectively declining.”
Sam took a beat before responding. “That doesn’t make any sense, I’m a guy. I can’t get pregnant.”
"Yeah, right." Chuck sent her a fake smile. "
Chuck's face twisted with anger for a brief moment. His fingers twitched on the pages, but then he took a deep breath and asked in a seemingly peaceful voice “Well then, my only fan. What is it that you don't like?”
“Did you beat him?” Dean gave Chuck a disgusted look.
“Come on, guys! If this really is the end, then go on! Kill me! This will be the most glorious ending, won’t it? The Winchesters actually killing god! Oh, this one is even better than the one I wrote before!”
“It’s...Jody,” Sam fished the cell from among a pile of Dean’s clothes, randomly thrown on the floor. “Hey, what’s up?” he asked as he put her on speaker.
"Sam got a job?" Becky looked genuinely surprised. "Why wasn't it mentioned in the book? What's he doing?"
“That's it for the beginning," she said. "Now that we've got Dean's death covered, let's talk about Sam."
Dean followed Claire and Alex as they walked into the tv network building.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean took a quick glance at the documents and started filling the designated blanks with some random data, discreetly looking around. He noticed a security guard standing in the corner and cameras on the ceiling.
“He did what?!” Sam interrupted him. “Why would he do that? Why haven’t you told me?”
“You were tracking me,” stated Claire reproachfully, taking a look at Sam’s laptop.
“No.” Becky shook her head. “It should be Castiel. After all, he’s in love with him. And we all know Dean loves Cas as well. Right?" She gave him a very meaningful look.
It was their last day in the bunker. Sam and Eileen were moving to a little white house with a porch and a big backyard, located just outside of Lebanon. He had gotten a job as a programmer and she found a vacancy in a flower shop.
"Well, he should have. Rewrite that part too."
“Did Jody send you here?” Kaia sat on Dean’s chair and picked up a pile of printed pages with articles from the web.
"If that's all you've got to tell me…" Chuck gave her a meaningful look.
None of her passengers looked at the once-almighty, hopelessly kneeling on the ground. They just got into the car and drove away.
He started to lift off the plastic cover and Dean was halfway across the room before Cas slipped in front of him, arm outstretched. Dean came to a stop just as Cas's fingertips touched his shirt, still glaring daggers over at Gabriel.
“Can't you conjure up your own food?” Sam sighed, eyes half closed as if to block out the stupidity of the situation.
“Oh, right.” Dean chuckled, scrubbing a hand over his face. “Yeah, good call.”
“Y'know I like to think me and John are a lot alike.”
“Well, we never really made a huge deal of it,” Sam admitted. “Growing up we moved around too much to have proper Christmases. Same after Dad died. But we figured...”
“...Right.” Dean blinked once, shrugged in disbelief. “That's-that's all you have to say?”
“Yeah, you know they don't even put the word
Sam closed his book, apparently giving up on the pipe dream of reading it. “Of course I do, but they're two grown...” Sam faltered, frowning. “Well, I mean Cas isn't exactly... And Dean doesn't
Cas looked silently at Sam, and then down at the tree, which was rather misshapen, bare, and on the point of tipping over.
That is to say, it had been a good few weeks without so much as a regular, small-fry case, let alone some world-shattering event involving pain and trauma and dramatic conversations. So when Dean and Sam were sitting around the library table in a state of unusual calm – Dean cleaning his gun and Sam nose-deep in a book – and there was the sound of flapping wings, they both assumed their luck had run out.
Gabriel stood at the end of the table, having watched the way Dean grasped his brother's arm, the intimacy of it. He had noticed how, even as Dean slowly let go of Cas, the two had continued to talk to each other as if neither Gabriel nor Sam was present. How Dean looked up at Cas with eyes glinting with amusement, of undeniable fondness. How Cas gazed back down at him in his softer expression of amusement, of absolute focus on Dean.
“Nothing, Dean, but I think you should go to bed. It will be uncomfortable sleeping in that chair.” Cas had his hand on his shoulder, Dean realized, just seconds before Cas let go. He straightened up, stepping away from Dean a little. “I remember enough of being human to regret doing such things.”
“Karl.”
Gabriel had seen Dean's dark side plenty of times, and he was aware of how – after all these years – that darkness had flooded closer and closer to the surface. All the battles, all the resurrections, all the betrayals. All the death. It chipped away at you, Gabriel knew. Like Dean, he covered his own scars with a personal brand of whimsy and snark. But what he saw on Dean's face was not the defense mechanism, it was the real thing. This was happiness, this was ease, this was...
He wasn't in the bunker.
“Not a Christmas movie,” Sam piped up.
Cas pushed his chair under the table and followed Dean to the kitchen. “Hm, sometimes I go to Kyoto. It's a little past 5pm there right now so there's still a lot of people around, and there's a shrine with these tunnels of beautiful red gates. Other times, I might just go to the 24-hour diner – if you recall there's one just a few blocks away – and sit there and watch people come in and out. Those places have a different atmosphere at night. And there's a waitress there, Luisa, who is very pleasant to talk to. She and her wife are currently in the process of adopting a dog.” He smiled slightly, warmly, and then looked over at Dean. “And sometimes I just stay here, in the bunker. I read, or simply sit and reflect, and I feel better knowing I'm nearby if there's any trouble.”
“If you ask me you've got a long way to go,” Dean called.
Don't you want them to actually
As Sam walked off to replace the book, Gabriel stood very still, letting that last sentence turn over in his mind. Sam had been joking, of course. But it had given Gabriel an idea, albeit a much more creative one, steadily expanding and mapping itself out.
“I'm not sure this was a worthy investment.”
He realized they had been doing that thing where they sort of stared at each other, and he cleared his throat, ears tingling. “Right. Well, goodnight, Cas,” he said finally, passing by him as he headed to the door, “and uh, if you do spend the night here, no parties, okay?”
it was their home. That when Dean was asleep in bed, Cas was drifting around a few rooms away, watching over them.
Cas might not appreciate it at first, Gabriel knew he had to be prepared for that. But he was trying to be a better brother, and this was for Cas's own good.
Dean's lips moved uselessly, abruptly speechless. When he made the comment he had been thinking more along the lines of, 'looks like a badass, is good at one-liners, pretty handsome dude if I do say so myself' and he had been half-joking. It was just damn typical of Cas to come along with a disarming compliment that Dean had no idea how to respond to, let alone attempt to believe.
Cas kept his eyes on Dean as if he were confronting a wild animal, and said: “Gabriel, put the pie back.”
eating that. I am saving that for later.”
By the time they reached
“What is this?” Cas asked, pointing to something by one of the pillars.
He waited until Cas moved out of the way and then flicked off the TV, standing up and stretching until his joints clicked. As he lowered his arms, and gathered up the empty beer bottles, a thought came to his mind.
Cas had a darkness too, and a power that – while not as great as Gabriel's – was fearsome, strong enough to pull the world apart at the seams if not completely destroy it or blink it out of existence. He had seen creatures and civilizations form and grow, tear themselves apart and form again. And this same angel was now looking down at a single human like he was the most wondrous thing the world could produce.
, Sam's yawning had become distracting to the point where Dean told him to just go to sleep already, and without Dean realizing Gabriel had disappeared, leaving Dean and Cas alone.
(Although now that loyalty was to the Winchesters. More specifically, to Dean.)
He patted Cas on the shoulder, and went off to his room. And when he lay in the dark a little later, the memory of Cas's fingers on his skin felt achingly fresh.
Cas bent to inspect the sad plant, and as he touched one of the branches a handful of needles drifted to the floor, joining a growing pile. He looked genuinely concerned.
“What's wrong, Cas?” he asked, blinking around in search of some threat or damage to the bunker.
like he's grown but... Look, the point is, only
But as he reached for the bedside table where he kept his phone, his hand grasped only air. No phone, no table. Confused, he opened his eyes properly, gazed around... and lurched upright.
When Dean awoke, it was to the persistent blare of an alarm.
It was embarrassing how much that thought comforted him.
Dean stood against the sink, just looking at Cas for a moment. He honestly forgot sometimes that Cas, who seemed so present in their lives, was this grand celestial being who could move so fluidly through the world. Who experienced things on a level Dean couldn't imagine, and had millennia of experiences just living inside him. And now to be reminded of that, it was crazy to think that sometimes he just chose to stay here, in Dean and Sam's home, precisely
“I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that, Sammy.”
“I didn't realize you celebrated,” Cas said, resolutely addressing the Winchesters. He looked over his shoulder at the tree. “If this is indeed a celebration.”
After manhandling some colored lights around the sad little tree, and scotch-taping some more to the pillars – Cas had dutifully unspooled the lights as Dean stuck them down – they had all settled around the TV with some beers and watched movies. It had felt strangely normal, despite half the group being made up of angels. Even Gabriel had behaved himself, apart from bragging about the time he romanced Donna Reed for half of
second being ripped apart in some way so...” He shrugged and Sam nodded. “Why not?”
“How do you stand it?” Gabriel whispered, stepping closer to Sam.
“I'm gonna try and salvage Sam's twig with some lights. You're welcome to join, Cas.” Dean tapped Cas's arm, and then grabbed it, suddenly looking serious. “Did I make you watch
But Gabriel ignored him. “Sharing is caring, Dean.”
Cas sighed. “Well, I don't know who Nessie is, but I don't have any bad news.” He looked slightly offended at essentially being called a bad omen. “However, it has been a while since we talked, so I came to check in on you.” He waved a hand from Dean to Sam. “The pair of you.”
He didn't say much, occasionally a short retort to a comment Dean made, such as:
Cas visibly considered, as if he were having to solve some cosmic problem rather than giving his opinion on a blockbuster.
“Huh?”
Cas wasn't even looking at him now, though, instead occupied with reading the back of the DVD case.
Dean looked pointedly past Cas to where Gabriel stood, as casual as you like. “And him?”
would've survived his injuries long enough to try and kill John at the end. But I understand the artistic license makes it more exciting.”
“There's a war on Christmas, little bro. You should Google it.”
Sam made a strange noise from the other side of the table, but Dean ignored it. “Whatever bad news you've come to deliver. Heaven wants us dead again? Nessie's awake and she's pissed? What is it.”
At some point, the beer and the late hour had lulled Dean to sleep with the help of the dialogue on the TV. He had nodded off for maybe a few minutes when he felt cool fingers against his jaw, and opened his eyes to see Cas standing over him. Those blue eyes were fixed on him so intently, that for a moment Dean was caught in them, his sleep-fogged brain unable to process what was going on. And then his instincts kicked in and he assumed the worst, jolting a little in the chair.
yet.”
It was difficult, Gabriel understood, to address your all-consuming love for someone when you were both constantly saving the world and dying. You needed some space, a little vacation from reality in order to do that, to talk about the little, selfish things. Fortunately, Gabriel could provide that vacation.
Cas hummed as he stood up. “From what I've seen, the... mainstream celebration of Christmas for humans has very little to do with the Bible.”
The archangel did a full-body, theatrical groan. “Fii-ine. But he is being a terrible host.” He stalked out and there was the distant sound of the refrigerator door slamming. Dean flinched, as if worried about the pie getting
Dean sighed and dropped his cleaning rod onto the table. “Okay, lay it on me, Cas.”
“So? Whadya think?”
, he thought, bleary eyed and legs kicking in the bed to dislodge the sheets around them.
something about it?”
Cas frowned. “What d--”
“Then you're staying, Cas. You can experience a human, if very Winchester-style, Christmas.”
“I can see that this was indeed a formative movie for you,” Cas had said at some point, focusing so much that Dean couldn't help be endeared by it, and ended up watching his reactions half the time. At first he didn't think Cas was enjoying it at all, his expression so serious, but eventually he noticed that Cas was leaning forward more and more throughout the movie.
“Yes, I did.” Jack nodded.
Sam filled them in as they moved the weapons to the trunk of the Impala. He found some news about a series of mysterious deaths in San Francisco that could catch the young huntresses’ attention.
"You're such an asshole, you know?"
Eileen didn’t expect to hear something like that.
“We were able to determine the three of them have been working on the same project,” explained Alex.
“Alright, we’ve got this. Don’t worry, Jodi. We’ll find them.”
“That’s not what he meant,” Sam explained, noticing confusion on her face. “Claire and Kaia, Patience, Alex... You could say they became hunters because of us.” He opened the back door for Eileen and got into the Impala after her. “Dean feels especially protective over them. Or any other kid we’ve encountered, but don’t tell him that,” he added, making sure his brother couldn’t hear him.
“Yeah, about that,” Dean kept his eyes on the road, doing everything he could to avoid his brother’s gaze. “You asked me what do I want to do now that we’re not hunters anymore, remember?”
“You’ve done so many terrible things,” Jack interrupted him. “And you never planned on stopping. I won’t let you off.”
“I still don't get this, Chuck. You told the Winchesters you're not going to write any more of their story.”
The second phase of Dean’s grief was destructive. It started at 3 a.m., when Sam suddenly woke up to some huge noise. He jumped out of his bed and ran down the corridor dressed only in boxers. His sudden moves woke Eileen and they both ran into Cas’ room with guns in their hands,  only to find the elder Winchester murdering the bed with an axe. A table and a chair already smashed into pieces. Dean stopped and gave his brother a long look. Their eyes met and what he saw in his blood-shooted ones made Sam slowly withdraw. He never went back to sleep, listening to the sounds of total destruction that lasted for another few hours.
“Agreed. What about the last one?”
“Still…” Sam took another look at the article. “That’s a bit weird.”
Becky didn't hear him - or decided not to - and continued her speech. "I love how you paralleled the day before Dean's death and the day after. Same scenes, their normal, every-day life, but such a huge difference. I mean, don't even get me started, that one, lonely toast? I imagine Dean every morning grabbed his when it was still too hot. But now, Sam makes just one piece. And there’s no-one to catch it." Becky's eyes were wet. She blinked a few times, trying to hold back tears. "Even thinking about it makes me wanna cry."
"Who's Becky?" Jack blinked in confusion.
Well, at least its first half.
“What now? I thought you'd love to have him back.”
At that moment they arrived at the front desk, where a young man in striped shirt greeted them. “We’re here for the audition,” Claire pointed at Alex and herself, sending him a smile so fakely cheerful she could feel her face hurt.
“So, it did turn out for good, didn't it? The best ending she could have was the one she made herself. People will like that.”
"No," Jack answered firmly, shaking his head. "I appreciate that you told me about this...little show, as you called it, that you were planning on doing here, but I can’t let you go just like that.”
“What's wrong with that!”
“It’s nothing. I’ll let you know when we find out anything.”
“Yeah, well, about that... I lied, you know.”
For the first time in his life, Sam had no idea what to do. How to help.
Eileen puffed a laugh.
Jack snapped his fingers and in an instant they were back in shape, wounds and blood gone. He smiled at the brothers as they stared at him with strange looks on their faces.
The boy shook his head again. “Someone once told me,” his eyes moved to the two frozen men behind Chuck. “Family doesn’t end in blood. And it doesn’t start there either.” Jack’s eyes glowed with yellow light when he looked back at his grandfather. “Family should care for you. And you don’t care for me, Chuck. You’re not my family. They are.”
The receptionist explained to the girls where they should go. As the two were walking away, Claire glanced at Dean over her shoulder. Their eyes met and the Winchester winked at her with a reassuring smile on his lips. Claire nodded right before she disappeared behind the corner.
“Speaking of Castiel, why is he not here anyway?” Becky shifted a few pages, as if she thought she missed some of them, and then looked up at Chuck. “He’s been around for, like, 11-12 years? And you didn’t even bother to let him make an appearance.”
“And? What do you think?”
“What are you two doing back there?” Dean’s head instantly popped inside. “Try keeping your hands away, okay?”
And just like that, they left.
“I lied, Becky, okay? That's what writers do. That's what gods do!”
“Claire?” he repeated, surprised. He took a quick look at Dean, but his brother shook his head with a stern face. “No, we haven’t. Why? What happened?”
Then, after about three weeks of constant drinking, one day Dean just stopped. He never told his younger brother about a dream he had at that time. One filled with the flutter of a trench coat in the wind and the rustle of wings, with beige and baby-blue.
“You're a control freak. You hate it when things don't go the way you want them to.”
“What...what did you do?” asked Chuck in a weak voice. He was still laying on the ground, unable to even get up. He didn’t expect things to end up like this when he followed Becky’s suggestion to try to make peace with Jack. Up until that moment, everything was going according to what he had written previously, even though the manuscript was already gone. He was so certain he knew all of them and that they’d act the way he expected them to even without it being written down.
"Do we really have to?" asked Chuck very quietly. There was a trace of despair in his voice.
Dean stopped.
he added.
“Like a supernatural scout girl”, Dean whispered with a smirk on his face.
“Okay, I don't get where this is going. I brought you here to give me some tips on the
"Really? What do you have so far?"
“To, uh, end the story?”
“What?!” Chuck's face was full of disbelief. “Oh come on, it's not that bad!”
The woman closed her eyes, doing her best to keep calm. At least a little bit. For the time.
"Besides," Sam looked at Chuck with a stern face. "Leaving you all by yourself? Making you live a regular, human life? That's the best punishment for you."
“So you liked it?” Chuck's eyes brimmed with hope.
It was the same bar where Chuck worked on his autobiography with Metatron a few years ago, but Becky couldn’t know that.
"Ah, yes, her. She died in a car accident a few years after Dean."
“Well, there goes our happily ever after,” muttered Dean, but none of the two heard him.
The part in spanish was provided by Google Translate. If it's incorrect - really sorry for that!
Sam looked at him over his shoulder. “Can’t? Who are you to tell us what we can or cannot do?”
The third phase, which came in the evening of that same day, soon turned out to be the worst one in Sam’s humble opinion. After some time, he realized he preferred it when Dean was smashing stuff in drunken fury. It was much better than his dead silence or the heart-wrenching sobbing in the first days.
“Please, don’t tell me we’re gonna pretend to be actors
“Well, the girls...” Jody fell silent for a moment. “Yesterday Patience told me she found something worth checking and the four of them decided to go.  Normally I’d join them, but the last few days have been crazy here. It's just that I've got a bad feeling, Sam. It’s been quiet for too long, if something happens to them…”
“I have an idea on how to get in,” came the answer.
“No, it's you. Just you, the Chuck. Amara didn't have that need, did she? Besides, you couldn't control her, could you? You didn't write her story, she did all that herself.”
We're doing a little time-jump. Prepare yourself for some hunting trip with our boys and their gorgeous company.
Sam and Dean exchanged glances, full of concern. Sam then turned to Eileen. She nodded and put down a box she was going to take to the car.
“Sure. And?”
Eileen looked at the printed articles scattered on the table and took one from the pile, showing it to Sam.
Dean puffed a laugh that earned him murderous glances from all of them.
(See the end of the chapter for
Patience nodded.
No-one to help him.
“They will.”
“Hi!” Sam hugged every single one of them and then introduced Eileen. “How did you find us?”
“From the beginning, if you won't mind.”
“Well, here’s the thing.” Dean unconsciously run his fingers through his hair. “Before he died, Bobby, our old Bobby, left me his place and I…”
"Why, Chuck?" Becky shook her head, disappointment visible on her face. "They were happy together, why didn't you let them?"
Chuck shrugged. "Didn't feel like it."
With what seemed like a total disappearance of monsters, there was not much for them to do anyway. Sam kept in touch with other hunters, but - as of now - none of them met anything supernatural. No weird deaths or strange omens, no impossible accidents or unusual disappearances.
Becky rolled her eyes, but didn't comment. "Where is Eileen though?" she asked instead.
If Castiel himself didn’t want to show up, then there was nothing he, god, could do about that. And besides, he was still angry with that son of his.
“At least Sam is with him,” stated Chuck in defense.
“No, yeah. It is.”
"Eileen? The badass mute huntress Sam dated before you wiped her out?"
“But, actually,” Becky looked at the pages again, as if suddenly realizing something. “Why are you even writing all of this?”
Sam sent his brother a murderous look, but Dean only bared his teeth in a wild smile.
“We just got back from the morgue,” Claire waved her hand in the direction of their car. “The girl’s name was Janice Parson, she was 25 and was working as an assistant. During lunch break she choked to death on a sausage.”
“Well, for starters, we don’t know any.” Dean was ready to go, leaning against the car's door. “Second, this is a kinda family thing. Those are our kids.”
Twenty minutes later they were sitting around a table in a decent-looking, simple-furnished room. Sam was clicking on his laptop, busy with trying to locate Claire’s phone. In the meantime, Dean and Eileen were once again researching the case, digging into online articles and police records.
It's been four weeks since they beat Chuck and Sam had already gotten used to this new life of his. A long run through the forest and a breakfast for three in the morning. Then some lazy reading in the library and a fight training with Eileen in the afternoon. She moved into the bunker and gave it a much needed female touch. And tuned out to be great at dealing with drunk Dean.
“Can we go now?” asked his brother.
“No, they won't. I don't, and we both know I'm probably the only Supernatural fan that's still reading your novels.”
"Have you ever read him saying that?" Chuck’s face showed no emotions.
“So, what did you want to tell me?” asked Sam.
The girl frowned and rolled her eyes, but obediently sat on one of the beds next to Patience. "She shouldn't have," she stated. "We can handle everything."
“See, that is why,” Dean pointed at his brother’s face. “I knew you’d react like that!”
She pointed at something on the side of the road. It was a sign to a hostel under a fancy name ‘House of Fame’. “Let’s stop there,” she said, interrupting their argument.
They looked at each other heavily. There was fire raging in their eyes. Chuck was first to turn his gaze away. He didn’t expect Becky to understand and now felt a hint of shame.
“Cynthia Warren,” his eyes ran through the text. “Died of  a heart attack? At this age? A bit too young, don’t you think?”
“What do you mean? I’m just surprised.’”
“I hate popcorn and you know it.”
Sam asked, but only once. Dean’s expression told him he should never do that again.
“Because,” Alex gave him a stern look. “You’re the only one fitting for the role.”
Four young women just got out of a beautiful, red ‘69 Mustang. Dean whistled, sparks shining in his eyes. He got up from his chair and hurried outside. “Hey, kids,” he greeted the girls quickly, already circling the car.
The next day, an assistant to one of the directors choked to death eating sausages during a break at work. The police once again got nothing.
“You will never hurt my family again.” In three long steps, Jack crossed the distance between them and grabbed Chuck’s head. His eyes flashed and his skin shone as he sucked all the power from him. In a blink of an eye, it was over. Jack let go and Chuck fell to the ground, now completely powerless. Behind him, Sam and Dean suddenly gasped as the force that kept them frozen was suddenly gone.
“Jack…”
Sam narrowed his eyes. “You've got something,” he stated.
looking uncomfortable. He turned his gaze at the Winchester brothers, frozen by his power behind his back. They were kneeling on the sand, all beaten up and covered in blood and dirt. He then looked back at his grandson. "I knew you wouldn't take it well," he said quietly. "Can't believe I really let Becky talk me into saying that."
"I wouldn't change a thing there. But later on… Who did he marry?"
“He's the Darkness now?”
“Honestly?” Becky put down a pile of papers and looked at the man sitting across from her. “It sucked.”
“I mean,” Becky didn't seem to hear him, focused on the manuscript. “I get why you killed him. With Cas dead, he'd spent the rest of his life blaming himself and grieving. And, let's be honest, he could never live an apple pie life on his own. Without his angel, he wouldn't want to.”
“We’re underage,” Alex explained, smiling.
God shrugged. "Just some chick he met at work."
“What about the others?” asked Dean, still leaning next to the front door.
Days passed idly. It took some time, but eventually he and Eileen moved on and started talking about the new kind of future ahead, while his brother...didn’t.
God looked at her with despair, but Becky was determined to point out all her disappointments. She put a few pages to the side and turned the rest to him. “Bobby? Seriously?”
No-one to hear him.
Sam kicked the God’s Book away as he followed his brother.
“So…?” He was getting annoyed.
“Are you really just letting me be?” There was despair in Chuck’s voice. “After everything I’ve done to you? You don’t want to punish me, to take your revenge?”
“Sam,” her voice sounded a bit worried. “Have you heard from Claire?”
“Morning, Dean,” Claire answered with a sour face.
We’ve investigated the victims. First was Cynthia Warner, a 37 years old screenwriter. No family, except for an older sister who she hasn't talked to for years. There was nothing interesting in her flat, only dozens of books and some merch related to the movies she worked on. And before you ask, she was already cremated”
"We should definitely start with checking out the place," said Eileen and then looked at Sam.
“Thank you, Sam. I'll send you the location”
"Yeah, she did," Sam closed the laptop right in front of Claire's nose.
This time he really, truly had no idea what will come next.
Since then, a week has passed. There was still no sign of any job, hence there was no need for hunters. After some serious discussions and a few heated arguments, Sam and Dean finally decided on starting over. On doing things they never had a chance to do.
“I am helping you, Chuck. Looking at you, I see my old self, you know? You got too involved. You have to let it go, Chuck. Instead of writing a fanfiction, just let the Winchesters make their own endings. Just sit back, grab some popcorn and watch the show.”
"Please don't," Chuck whispered softly. "Not again."
Although Dean never shared the details of Castiel’s death with him, Sam pretty much figured it out. His brother was obviously heartbroken and devastated - much more than Sam has ever seen him.
“In a way, yes. He is. It's too complicated to explain.”
But Dean didn’t even spare him a look. He patted Jack’s arm, giving him an approving nod, and said, “Let’s go home.”
The Nephilim took a step closer. His eyes were shining brighter and brighter, as he sucked more and more of Chuck’s power. God fell to his knees, his face full of shock and despair. “Jack, please…”
Chuck knew he was provoking them. He did that on purpose. In the ending he wrote previously, he tricked the Winchesters and kept some of his powers. Now he couldn’t and he really was ready to die. Otherwise, he’d have to live a regular, mortal life. And that’d be unacceptable.
Chuck took the freshly finished manuscript away from her and quickly started running through the pages. Becky used that moment of quietness to take a look around.
"Who?"
“Then what about Jack?”
“Maybe we should contact some local hunters first?” asked Eileen.
"Eh," Chuck casually waved his hand. "Not important."
“I know,” Chuck sniffed. “Sadly, I've seen it.”
“Oh, come on, Jack, we’re family!”
“The cause of his death should be more glorious. It's a hero's death, after all. Give the man some dignity."
The man didn’t look entirely convinced, but he nodded slowly and handed Dean some papers. “Please sign here, sir.”
The man nodded, clicked something on his iPad and turned his gaze to Dean, who was standing stiffly behind the girls. “And you, sir?” he asked with suspicion in his voice.
“Smile,” muttered the blonde.
As the three of them slowly made their way towards the Impala waiting on the side, they could hear Chuck’s voice from where he still laid on the sand. “Guys! Guys! Wait! You can’t just leave me here! Guys!”
“Where do I start?”
The first few days Dean spent locked in Castiel’s old room. Sometimes Sam could hear his sobbing from behind the closed door. At that time, he’d stay, listening. He never knocked, knowing his brother wouldn’t want to be seen in that state. He never prayed, knowing no-one could help. He could only stand there, silently listening, heart aching for his brother, until Dean passed out, completely drunk.
Sam let the book he was holding drop to the table, exasperated. “It was the last one they had in the store, okay?! The last one that would fit through the door.”
“I'm not taking cues from you knuckleheads.” Gabriel reappeared, brandishing a half-eaten cherry pie and a surly grin. “Key word
“You stalking Cas doesn't make you our guest,” Dean grumbled, sitting down forcefully to make it clear how he felt about the whole thing.
When the credits finally rolled, Dean leaned back and looked over at Cas, bright eyed with satisfaction.
“Hey, I thought

“...Since we kinda have a permanent home now,” Dean continued, “we might as well do something. Y'know, it's Christmas Eve and the world isn't currently exploding and we are not at

Cas hesitated, perplexed. “Lay... what on you?”
