“They’d rather light a candle than curse the darkness,” Dean said. He’d heard Bobby use that phrase before.
Dean flashed a lopsided grin. “That sounds less than confident, but I’ll take it. Trust me Cas, I know exactly where I’m going.”  Dean took his hand to lead him the rest of the way. The grassy path had given way to a forest floor covered in roots, pine needles and rocks jutting up in places. Dean continued to walk hand in hand with Cas until they heard water up ahead in the distance.
Castiel was a trigger for him then he would become one through association. He thought about how best to make Dean understand.
Clearing his throat, a sudden flush on his cheeks, Dean led the way up to a large functioning balcony on the second floor where they could avoid most of the matinee crowd. His eyes flitted along the sides of the theater where smaller balconies, meant for two or four patrons, lined the upper walls, but these had been closed off due to disrepair. Below the modern movie screen was a large stage area, a testament to the time when the entertainment would have consisted of vaudeville acts by small traveling theater groups.
Cas in the meantime would sleep in the spare room until he figured out where he was going and what he was going to do next.
“Dammit Cas.” Dean sighed, gesturing at the blanket and its contents. “I’ve never made fried chicken before. Never done this crazy sappy shit before. Not for a girl, not for  Sammy not for anyone, ‘cept you,” Dean’s shoulders slumped a little, his eyebrows drawing together. “And obviously I suck at it ‘cause I’m doing it all wrong if I can’t make you see how special you are.”
“Ughhh...that’s it! Cas, why? He sounds like a huge dick.” Charlie could instantly see her mistake as Cas sat up rigid, fixing her with an irritated glare.
Dean felt his neck getting hot. Hanging up the phone he went back to the bedroom and threw together a bag of clothes. He called Bobby to let him know he was going to the shop in San Francisco for the night, that Cas might be in trouble and he would do as much free overtime as he needed to make it up to him. Bobby called him an idjit and told him to just be careful and find Cas.
Dean gave in and tentatively sang along as Jess made him harmonize. After the first verse, he had to admit it wasn’t too bad. Listening to them sing together for the first time, Sam thought it was one of the most magical things he had ever heard. Sam grabbed the tambourine, ribbons and all and joined in and Dean broke down laughing so hard they all had to start over.
Cas told Dean more about his brother Gabriel. He’d been married and divorced already. Cas thought seeing Gabriel again would be awkward but after the first few minutes of stilted conversation they both relaxed and he forgot how funny his brother actually was. Gabriel seemed contrite for having been estranged from Cas all those years. Cas couldn’t help but forgive him. Something in Gabriel was always a little damaged, even though he put up a facade. Gabriel could never handle the pressure of family fights and tension; he usually avoided it by running away. Away from the heavy influence of his father and older brother Gabriel was so much more at ease.
“You’re not fucked up Dean,” She’d countered, shaking her head. “I just thought it would be good since we are still establishing this therapist - client relationship to get some work in sooner rather than later. The holidays can be difficult for some people but we don’t have to meet so soon if you don’t want to.”
Cas had his own room in the bunker. Obediently, he allowed Dean to lead him there now, settling on the bed.
“Thanks Dean...knew I could count on you. Take care boy. Call me from the office when you get a sense of things.”
“You rolled in today gloomy as a little thundercloud, but a call to this ‘Dean’ guy and you're….well just what I said, you’re glowing brighter than a streaker’s ass in the moonlight.”
Dean felt a rush of energy flow out of him, stopping and leaning for a minute with his back against the wall just outside Fred’s room to regain his legs. He needed a moment. The tears finally breaking free and spilling over. Tears of relief, mixed with joy and tears of release. He wiped his eyes with his hands before straightening up and making his way back to the visitor’s lounge where Mildred was waiting.
Cas turned to him. “That’s not true Dean. Sam cares, Jess cares, Bobby cares, even Rachel and Gabriel-”
“Let’s go Jenny!” Cas said, cutting off Dean’s latest remark with an overly pleasant tone, holding his hand out for the little girl. “I think we’re all set now,” Cas nodded to Hanna on the porch. “Have fun with the goblins!” he said as the first group of monsters came rambling up the lawn. “See you later,” he added softly to Dean.
“Oh thank the lord!” Mildred cried in relief, fresh tears streaming down her face. Dean exhaled and she hugged him, then turning to hug Garth, who was beaming, as well.
“You’re a dick Dean,” Cas teased back, over the sound of continued laughter, too busy glowing inside from Dean’s easy banter to really mean it. “You know that right?” Cas smiled and
Cas looked down for a moment, closing his eyes. When he opened them again he caught Dean’s worried gaze.
Over an hour later, yet still too soon it seemed, the movie was over. Dramatic music blaring. Credits rolling. Their conversation stifled, as if both parties were afraid to go on without the excuse of the movie to share.
The grinning one had a knife sticking out of the side of its head for effect and Dean briefly worried about which one if any Cas had carved.
Dean even found a few races locally to wet his feet again and Garth and his family came out to root for him on a borrowed bike. There was nothing like the feeling of pushing a bike as fast as it could go. Dean thought it must be as close to flying as you could get without wings. Still, he knew things were different...
“No...no….NO!” Dean yelled hauling his ass back to where Adam lay, face down in the mud. Hit by his own platoon mates. Dean grabbed Adam’s shoulders to turn him over. Cas looked up at him...eyes blank, their light gone, blood trickling from his mouth and nose, gushing from his stomach. “No! No! What’s happening??” Dean cried cradling Cas and touching his hand to his cheek. Blood pooled under Dean’s fingertips as every place he touched became an open oozing wound on Cas’s lifeless body.
Dean stood up, wobbly on his feet, putting the bar and Crowley to his back as the three men surrounded him. Recognizing the potential danger of the situation he used all the will and energy he could muster to focus. Unfortunately Dean was still very drunk - granted a slightly more alert drunk than a few moments before, but still staggeringly drunk.
Cas slammed the kitchenette counter with his fist, swiping a pile of mail and a coffee mug, sending them flying across the room. The mug smashed as it hit the floor. He stood there, staring down at the broken pieces. Leaving them, he turned on the TV, dropped onto the couch, and stared into it. His jeans were still uncomfortably damp from the rain he'd run through, but he was too exhausted suddenly to do anything about it. He didn’t even have it in him to think about where Balthazar might be going, or when he might come back, or what any of this meant for them. He was just tired...so goddamn tired. He pulled a throw blanket from the arm of the couch to cover himself and closed his eyes - the sound of his thoughts drowning out the droning of the voices on the television.
Cas excused himself for a moment and called for one on the payphone in the entryway, then returned to the booth with Dean until it pulled up to the curb.
“Wait!...Are you okay to drive Bobby?” Dean asked as an afterthought, his hands shaking as he opened the passenger door.
Dean started to relax as, eyes still closed, he heard the room joining in to clap with the rhythm as he and Jess sang. While he couldn’t bring himself to open his eyes, he imagined he was back with Cas, in their apartment before the war, playing and singing only for him.
His stomach lurched as he struggled to sit up. He was in the throes of one of the worst hangovers he’d had in recent memory. He heard movement outside his bedroom door and grabbed a baseball bat which he kept nearby as a primitive home security system. He cracked the door open only to see Sam messing around in the kitchen. Thank god, it looked like he was about to brew some coffee.
Dean shook his head uselessly, forgetting Cas couldn’t see, pulling at the tears forming behind his closed eyes.
He remembered how she would dress up at night in short skirts and heels before sending them to bed, telling the boys to stay in their room and lock the door until she came to get them in the morning. Dean was nine.
“They adore him,” Hannah said watching the three move on to the next house. “I do too. He’s a really great guy.” She said looking sideways at Dean as he settled down next to her in the chair.
Cas didn’t know if his heart would ever be at peace again, but Dean needed it, if it was something Cas could give him, he'd pretend, for Dean's sake.
Cas elbowed him gently,  but enough to turn his attention. “You’re picturing cowboys and dancing girls in various states of undress behind those curtains aren’t you Dean?” he asked, glancing sideways at him with a knowing smirk.
“That’s great!” Dean encouraged, but then made a few mental calculations, deciding he probably shouldn’t get his hopes too high for a late evening, given Cas’s early shift tomorrow.
This time Cas ventured further in, squeezing through bodies to find a patch of floor where he could turn around and come face to face with Dean. The crush of people brought them close out of necessity and it wasn’t long before they were flush against each other, Dean’s arms around Cas, his face seeking the hollow of his neck. The music didn’t even register, only the relentless beat and pulsing lights as they moved against each other... other people’s bodies bumping inconsequentially around them.
It just flowed out of him...out of the sudden hope that welled inside, ironically threatening to immediately dash that same hope. It was too much.
Rush hour was subsiding, but the sun was still plenty high in the summer sky when Dean headed down the stairs into the street. He leaned back against the side of the building and scanned the crowds for signs of Cas. Rain started sprinkling then opened up suddenly in a short but heavy burst, the sky a patchwork of clouds and blue as the sun in spaces reached down over San Francisco in misty rays. Dean ducked under the awning of the shop next door to the garage for cover. A moment later he saw Cas, jogging towards the shop to get out of the rain. He waved Cas over and they both stood for a moment in the shelter of the awning. Tiny droplets clung to Cas’s hair and laughing, he shook his head to flick them away.
It crossed Dean’s mind to call Cas later to set up that “raincheck” when he realized if Cas had moved, the number he had wouldn’t work. He supposed he could ask Jess if he gave her a new one, or maybe even call Rachel, but then he remembered that Cas had his number and if he wanted to talk to Dean he would probably call. Dean wasn’t used to being on the waiting end of things. It messed with his head. Dammit, he should have just gone with them anyway. Bobby would have understood. Dean felt so stupid. Between Cas’s brief visit and the end of the workday, he found a dozen different reasons why Cas would probably never call. Cas was just visiting with Jess and now Dean had gone and read too much into it.
with fluffy crap like “Mrs. Castiel Novak” and “Gilda Novak'' and little hearts with your initials in them.” She stuck her finger down her throat. “BLECH!”
Even in that movement, long before he realized the significance of it, something had broken in Dean. The feeling that sometimes a moment comes along in life, after which, life is never the same.
Dean laughed at first. Then thought about it, and once he actually started talking, the floodgates opened.
He rolled to his side, bunching the pillow beneath his head until he was better supported. Dean closed his eyes, his thoughts returning again to the words….
Dean shook his head, adamant in his course of action, “But see... It wasn’t Cas - It wasn’t a bad day...it was a good day...a
On nights when Dean couldn’t sleep or when everything got to be too much he would occupy his mind and body teaching himself any song he could think of. Songs he grew up with, songs he knew Mildred would like, new Zepplin tunes, anything really….well, almost anything.
Cas was mortified at his sudden inability to make his mind craft the simplest response...to make his mouth form words. He suddenly remembered why he called, because after all, it wasn’t just to stumble into speechless idiocy at the sound of Dean’s voice. That most certainly wasn’t the reason.
Cas tilted his head curiously, a crease marking his brow. Dean was sobbing now head in hands with an intensity that he’d rarely seen. Cas instinctively reached out a hand to Dean’s cheek to comfort him, turning his face to look at him. Cas’s eyes widened at the unnatural heat radiating off him. He quickly flipped the back of his hand up to feel his forehead. “Dean, you’re burning up!”
“So this can’t be your first trip to this place.” Dean motioned to the cafe tables around them. “You seemed to know exactly where you were going.” Dean imagined him sitting with Balthazar, sipping wine and enjoying the romantic view.
“The ancient astronomers marked their calendars around it, the Winter Solstice….the day the Unconquered Sun began to strengthen and grow again and eventually overtake the darkness until everything began to blossom with new life…..new possibilities. Sol Invictus.”
Cas turned his head towards him now, looking up at Dean through thick eyelashes. Dean absentmindedly wet his lips, mouth parting slightly at Cas’s tell tale dark pupils before shifting his gaze off to the pavilion in the distance.
“Oh, poor Dean. I hope he feels better soon. Oh Cas - I know you still love him...You could invite him for Thanksgiving with us....give it another chance...do you think he would come?”
The heat and steam of the ensuing shower was welcoming but it only made Dean more exhausted. He dried off and threw himself back under the sheets naked..too tired to even find clothes. He’d taken some aspirin and hoped that the pills and some sleep would calm the vicious pain throttling through his skull.
He pulled down a shoebox of carefully protected letters and photographs. Cas hadn’t dared look through them in years.
Playing around after dinner at Sam’s and singing with Jess was one thing, but this was public. His hands started literally shaking at the thought.
Hannah laughed. “It’s fine, but you’re gonna want to get your motorcycle off the street I think,” She said nodding to a larger group of almost-teens about to converge on the lawn perilously close to the bike. “Most of the kids around here are harmless but we do have some older ones occasionally that prefer tricks to treats. You can close it up in the garage.”
Well, better Cas know exactly how shitty he was. Let him be angry. It would help Cas move on. Sam had agreed to tell Cas that Dean was okay. That he didn’t want to be found, that Cas should forget him.
They found a Balthazar listed among the alum. Balthazar Sébastien. Dean pulled out the San Fran phone book and checked.
Cas moaned. He closed his eyes, then closed his lips around Dean’s finger sucking at it and massaging it with his tongue.
Like a rubber band had snapped, he’d been slammed right back to where he started, that first night back, Cas outside the bathroom door as Dean confronted the hollowed-out shell in the mirror, some walking corpse clutching a useless St. Michael’s medal in his hand - his scarlet letter, meant to hang round his neck as a reminder of his shame. He looked down to his empty hand now as if still holding it.
Sam decided to let the matter rest and they settled back into a relaxed silence for a few more rounds. Although his perfect luck didn’t hold, Dean was merciless to his brother in every game, and to be fair, Sam was a little too rattled at having witnessed his brother all but proposition a total stranger in front of him with body language alone.
Just hours earlier Mary, Sam, Wally, Dean, and Cas had been ordering food and getting ready for what seemed like a routine demon hunt. Dean was more interested in helping Cas get lucky with the waitress who locked eyes with him than ruminating over the details of their plan. To be honest, Dean knew Cas would be too shy to follow through with a hasty hookup, but seeing the fluster in Cas’s face as they teased him, the nervous sniff of Mandy’s hair after they told him she’d smell like food…these were the things about Cas that made Dean’s chest almost burst with amusement. Not quite as amusing as the look of abject terror in Cas’s eyes the night Dean took him to a brothel and sent him off with “Chastity,” but enough to make Dean smile with the dorky awkwardness of it all.
must have known. When you’re in love like that, it pours out like light from your eyes. It flows through every movement and step, like a dance. There’s no hiding it.
“Charlie, tell me I didn’t do anything stupid.” She stared for a moment confused. “Why is Alfie here?”
“Carter says if he becomes president he’ll sign a Gay Rights bill,” Cas commented, his eyes fixed lazily on the campaign coverage.
would be unconquered, but only if they didn’t give up. As long as you didn’t give up, you would see the day when the darkness subsided, and
Neither man spoke. Dean stared at the floor as if looking for the words at his feet. When he looked up, Cas was staring at Dean with red-rimmed eyes, trying to hold back tears that threatened to fall.
“Dean!” Sam cupped Dean’s cheek with his hand, pulling his face up to look in his eyes. Dean was having trouble focusing.
“That was so nice of him!” She said smiling. “You should bring him by for dinner so we can thank him in person. I’d love to meet him.”
“Alright…” Dean said, uncomfortable, giving Sam a quick pat on the back hoping to break the hug “Okay… hey easy now.  If you’re not careful Johnny Hooker over there is gonna think he can’t come home with me.”
“Dean!” Cas yelled, his hands up to protect him from the spray as a water droplet hit him square in the eye.
“Dean we haven’t even started yet. You think because you’ve been out of the theater for a year you’re home?”
Dean sat up, shifting to position himself between Cas’s legs and lowering himself, teasing the tip of Cas’s cock along the slit with his tongue. He moaned softly, delighting in the taste of the precum that had leaked there.
Dean settled himself above the covers, far enough from Cas to convince himself it was nothing more than concern for a friend. Close enough for his hand to resume gently rubbing up and down Cas’s side, even though it was no longer needed for warmth. After a few moments, Cas reached out and caught Dean’s arm, just holding it, settling him there. Dean pulled his hand back along Cas’s until their hand’s grasped. Gently he pulled Cas’s hand to his face, holding his cheek to the back of Cas’s hand and brushing it with his lips, pressing a soft kiss. It wasn’t romantic, just pure need. Still, it felt wrong, it felt forbidden, not because Cas wouldn’t want it, but because Dean
Cas beamed at him, “We can do a late dinner if you think you can eat twice. Or just come for pie.” Cas looked away as if gathering courage, then back to Dean, “You could just relax, stay over at my place after,” he swallowed.
For a moment neither moved. Dean was unprepared for the suddenness of what he felt. He wanted to grab Cas... hold him tight and beg forgiveness for ever leaving him. Instead, after a moment he offered Cas an awkward smile then sat down in the chair in between him and Sam. Dean took a sip of his beer, wondering how he had ever fooled himself into thinking he could handle this.
On day nine Dean had an unexpected visitor. Fred Jones, the cab driver, had called to check in on Dean and Rufus suggested he come for a visit. Dean was mortified at first. He glared defiantly at Fred as if to say
Dean shook himself out of the vision and back to the moment. “Human weakness” Ishim’s voice echoed. That’s what Dean was. How many times had Cas risked his life for Dean? How many times had Sam and Dean almost gotten him killed? Maybe Cas would have been better off if Ishim had just done it.
“Wait Cassie!” Jenny ran into the garage and came back out holding a hairband with black furry cat ears up to him. “Witches need their kitty cats for magic!”
When Dean picked up the phone and heard Cas’s voice his insides were suddenly churning, blood coursing. He kept his voice steady nonetheless and managed to piece together enough coherent sentences to not sound like he’d been sitting by the phone, hoping for Cas to call, even though he was certain that's exactly what Sam would have accused him of.
Cas’s mind automatically flew to the last time he lost something important to him because someone had called him out. His landlord evicted him, but Dean had welcomed him into his apartment, into his bed, and into his heart. It was their first and last home together.
“Wonderful you two!” Hannah smiled. I think you have one more thank you before we go in to get you cleaned up. Tommy turned to Cas “Thank you Cas!” he said as Cas high-fived him. Jenny dropped her bucket and ran to wrap him in an exuberant hug. “Thank you Cassie Kitty Cat!” she sang.
They had met in college in the same horticultural program. Stephen was in research. His goal was to one day have an herb farm and vineyard. Rachel joked that he was great at cross-breeding varieties but crap at design so was smart to keep romancing her, but he needed no encouragement on that front. Cas could see the way they looked at each other.
Dean tried calling Cas just after he got the call from Garth but Cas wasn’t home, and of course, just his luck, the one payphone on the stop he’d allowed himself to make on the way to Valens was busted. Dean should have thought to stop earlier but he was afraid of arriving too late.
Cas would have to get up extra early to drive back home in the morning to shower and change for work but it would be worth it to finally feel Dean’s body warm against his after so long.
Cas stepped back as the man took his place at the sink. It was then that he saw the grey bandana in the man’s left back pocket.
“So I’m sitting on the end of the couch...your head is resting on me, in my lap...we’re watching the Thin Man together...my fingers brushing through your hair. Rubbing the back of your neck...Just like we used to.”
Dean knew the street well, having lived for a few years in the loft above Garth and Bess’s barn while working at the shop. He tried now to picture the place Benny was referring to.
Dean tried to think back. “His hands were around mine. He asked me what I felt. Asked me what was in my hands. So I told him.”
Early the next morning Dean got up early, showered, packed his bag, and grabbed the San Francisco phone book from the office, stuffing it in his pack before heading out the door. He stopped to grab coffee, then made the trip back home just in time to meet Jessica at the university library where they asked for as many copies of the quarterly newsletter that they could get from the last 5 years.
Cas looked momentarily into his coffee as if the answer to a burning question might be revealed in its depths, finally looking up to search Dean’s face. He decided to be blunt.
Dean left the grounds and made his way back to the entrance where he’d parked. On his way he passed a woman selling trinkets on the side of the street. Something caught his eye and he stopped to look at it, handing her a twenty and not waiting for the change. Sam was right. Dean knew he needed to talk to Cas. He still wasn't exactly sure how.
“If I ever meet up with that son of a bitch he will be begging you on his knees for forgiveness.” Dean remembered how distraught Cas was when his landlord evicted him for sleeping with Dean. It broke Dean’s heart that Cas’s own brother went after him this way.
When the man didn’t answer Dean tightened his grip on his shoulders pulling him forward and slamming him back into the wall.
“The last person who owes me anything Cas is you. Just needed to make sure you were okay. Guess I could’a fucked your life up more in the process.”
Cas's eyes shone for a moment with the light of his grace at Dean's words. "Never be afraid with me Dean," He said softly. Castiel's heart quickened as he leaned in to kiss Dean again, hungry for the taste of Dean's lips.
“Please Dean! I want the world to see how good you are!” Jess smiled, and the crowd, seeing her attempts to entice Dean into performing as he shook his head “No”, cheered them on loudly.
When Dean disappeared, Cas first sought to find answers, or hope, or at least comfort with Sam and Jess. But Sam’s awkward evasions followed by more blunt, if reluctant refusals of information soon made it clear he was now an outsider in every way in Dean’s life. Cas’s throat tightened with the memory, the feeling of being cut off and discarded by the people he had come to view as
Dean closed his eyes and sighed, “Look fine, I’ll play along. I won’t run. Just get these off and let me take a piss okay?”
Cas looked through the TV guide and got up to change the channel to one that was showing a marathon of Abbott and Costello movies. They were just in time to catch the beginning of
Dean turned again, staring up at the house. Minutes went by. Finally, the light in Cas’s window went out. Dean let out a ragged breath as if waking from a dream. He rubbed both hands over his eyes, pressing the tension out of his forehead. He was tired...he was a fool.
“You sayin you wanna be that for me Cas? Cause honest to god just knowing that’s gonna carry me through this week.”
Charlie let out a big sigh. “Yeah, I guess....but Cas, none of this gloom and doom now, okay? Just give yourself a chance to figure out what you want. What’s your rush?”
Images and bits were floating around Dean’s head, but they didn’t piece together into anything that made sense. He remembered a voice behind him, something about his father, and there were people around him - the feeling of his face hitting the hard surface of the bar. He remembered just feeling….hopeless. Something about the feel of the memory made his stomach queasy.
Cas struggled to reconcile the Dean sitting across from him with his memories. Dean had been despondent after the war. So much so that he wondered as he struggled to get Dean to get out of bed, or even just to eat, if maybe
One day in the fall of 75 he went over to Fred and Mildred’s for Sunday night dinner. It was then he told them he would be leaving. It was time to go back home. Dean wanted to live closer to Sam again. He had gotten a letter from Bobby telling him he could really use him back home.  A cousin of Bobby’s who was getting on in years had offered him part ownership of his auto shop in San Francisco and Bobby would need all hands on deck to run the shop in Sacramento and deal with San Francisco too. He had already talked to Garth and given plenty of notice. He would move in with Sammy and Jess temporarily. It was a good time to make the move.
“You’re always so good to him, to everyone. You took care of your little brother last night like you always do...I know you’ll be doing everything you can to take care of him this week if he needs you even with having to work at the other shop for Bobby.”
“Hell...You had the shock of your life only two weeks ago. Now you’re taking on Mount Everest without any climbing gear and expect to be at the summit by midnight. Now don’t bullshit me. Why are we here? Do you want closure as you put it? You wanna give Castiel closure? Or is this some way to figure out if you want him back in your life?”
my thing, Cas” Dean smiled. “And you’re gonna show me your moves on the dance floor tonight, right?”
Just as quickly as it happened, Dean released Cas’s hand as Sammy came back with fresh beer for everyone.
Dean nodded, rebuked. His hands began clutching at the table cloth where it fell along his thighs. “Okay, good. I’m glad Cas.” Not believing it, but knowing he had no standing from which to judge Cas at this point. He had given away his right to have any input in Cas’s life when he left him, without any word.
“Sammy and I found it once when we were trying to hide out from my old man. We come here every now and then to swim when it's hot out. It’s kind of a special place to me. I wanted to share it with you.”
In the end, Cas had only stood there, ramrod straight, arms glued to his side, a respectable distance in the center of the old salvage yard, wary of getting too close, as if Dean was a cornered animal that he needed to keep clear from lest he lash out, terrified.
...and suddenly Cas was asking Dean something about racing, and Dean’s lips found an answer with barely a thought...and good thing too because his mind could form only one word...one name - and the voice inside him sang it over and over.
’ he slammed the dresser drawer. “He casts you aside like garbage and four years later, he feels a twinge of guilt, gives you a little wink and a smile before he casts you off again, and you’re
He drove home, quickly showered and changed into fresh clothes, drank another glass of water, piled the food he’d prepared the morning before into his car and headed to Rachels.
Dean was a hundred and ninety percent sure this was a mistake, and yet his feet were moving despite him, across the lawn to the apartment building entrance, every nerve tingling with fear and longing and regret. Halfway to the door he glanced up again. The silhouette of a woman formed near the window…
Dean wanted to say it, but he held back, afraid that the words would seem empty after so many stops and starts.
“And what if I want you all soft and gentle tonight?” Dean asked, his eyes heavy-lidded and wonderstruck. “What if I wanna play with your body till you’re twisting and squirming under my touch? You look so fucking beautiful like that, baby…” Dean’s breath quickened. “Would you let me do whatever I want to you Cas?” His eyes danced over Cas’s face, settling on his lips, before he leaned forward again to place a tender, worshipful kiss there. Cas loved it when Dean was gentle like this. He knew Dean was holding back a little...drawing him in.
Cas stiffened, looking in the mirror’s reflection to see a man around his own age, sizing him up from behind. Cas turned.
His father and Michael had always been cold and disapproving, even before they knew he was queer. Once Cas was found out, they made it abundantly clear that in their eyes he was an abomination. The family curse. Unworthy. It actually made it easier for Cas to look to a future with them in the rearview. Besides, he nurtured the hope that Rachel at least still cared for him - that one day they would be able to visit and laugh and be siblings again.
“Why did you do that Cas?” Dean whispered, crying out softly to nothing but the cool night air, “I’m so sorry I didn’t deserve it.”
The man was taller than Dean, but Dean tipped his chin up to stare challengingly back at him. Before Dean could speak Crowley cut in.
just as a friend reaching out. It had been weeks after all. Long enough that Dean wouldn’t get the wrong idea.
"Oh. Okay..." Dean stiffly patted Sammy on the back with his free arm, the other holding the bucket of cleaning supplies, but Sam gripped him tighter until Dean surrendered to it, dropping the bucket and hugging him back.
After a moment Dean drew a long deep breath. He started blinking, becoming aware of his surroundings for the first time.
Dean stood staring open-mouthed and wide-eyed, his heart pounding, the urge to follow pulling at him like a riptide, wanting to chase that kiss, until Cas disappeared inside. He looked back to the bike, vaguely aware of the blinds shifting in a house across the street.
“Beautiful night boys!”  Balthazar’s expression was closed as he flicked his eyes from Dean to Cas who had gotten off the bike.
Cas shrugged. He hadn't meant the comment to bring her down. "It's not. Besides it wasn't your fault."
Cas followed him as he quickly made his way to the kitchen grabbing his keys from the counter where Cas had dropped them.
Twice each week, they met in a circle in the basement of a Unitarian church to drink coffee, talk,  joke and share their common struggles and experiences, taking turns sharing. Each time the turn came round to him week after week it was like pressure in a bottle, building, waiting for a cork to pop. Each week Dean shoved it down again and again. Why bother telling half-truths? If he was going to tell it he was going to tell it all. Tell them about how the war had ripped away the only thing he remembered having in his life that was true and good. He couldn’t tell that story without telling everyone about Cas - and once he did, that would be it. Dean wasn’t ashamed of who he was and what he wanted, but he didn’t want to lose the connection he made here.
he thought. Dean didn’t even mean his appearance. All the tender moments, the sweet promises and soft touches they had shared came rushing back in a tidal wave of memory. The levy Dean had worked years to build was breaking. Dean was in danger of being swept away. More than that...Dean
say goodbye. No matter how it ended, your coming back was the best thing that could have happened, because it made me realize that what I was doing was just hiding from life and trying not to feel anymore. That's not living, and I realize now I have a lot to give and a lot to live for. Thank you for that.
Cas…” Dean interrupted, unable to hold back tears, though he worked to steady his voice. “It’s all my fault...everything, I broke us, and it’s all my fault and I’m sorry!”
“In terms of his heart, he was lucky.” Dr. Inias sat on Mildred’s other side calmly delivering the news. “Your husband mentioned he took aspirin for some mild chest pains earlier in the evening. That probably helped to  lessen the severity of the heart attack. He’ll need to make some dietary changes, go to a cardiologist for regular check ups and get on a suitable exercise regimen, but we’re pretty sure if he does what the doctors order he’ll be able to go back to regular activities soon.”
Cas got out of the car, then stopped, turning to him. Balthazar was being so warm and accommodating. Too forgiving. Cas wanted to feel grateful and loving back. He had been trying for so long. Cas pulled Balthazar in to embrace him before they went up the stairs to their apartment.
“Point being Sam,” Dean said, serious once more, “It’s not like I haven’t thought about it. It’s not like I haven’t tried to “move on.” And yes, I could have Sundance over there bent over for me within the hour if I wanted to. But I don’t. I just don’t want it Sam. Don’t try to force the issue.”
Dean exhaled, flushing pink, a smile pulling at his lips. He ran his hands along Castiel’s sides a few times affectionately before motioning him to sit and sliding up next to him. Dean pointed to the first container.
Cas dropped the knife and cheese, “Oh Rachel!”  His face lit up as he gave Rachel a celebratory hug. “That's fantastic! I’m so proud of you! So happy for you!”
Still, Dean maneuvered between Cas and his admirer effectively blocking him and adding a not too subtle hip check.
“No Cas...I...that’s just it. It’s not okay...I DO want it...want you” Dean pulled away to stand and face Castiel but as he did his hands began to shake again. “But I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. Or how to do it.”
Fred had help from other people who had been through it. He asked about Dean’s future plans. Fred listened and nodded when Dean told him he didn’t think he could go home yet. As he was about to leave, Dean couldn’t help but wonder “Why do you care so much man? You don’t know me from anything but here you are on your day off, hours from your home.”
He didn’t wait for more of an explanation. There was no higher power to appeal to. He was fired because he was gay. His own brother had been the instrument. He strode from the restaurant to his ugly powder blue long-term rental and drove home.
When you found me again this summer I didn’t know what to think. I may have seemed angry sometimes because part of me was ashamed that I had lost my way without you. I was afraid you would think less of me.
He found himself getting up and going over to settle Dean so many times that at one point he woke to find he’d fallen asleep on the floor leaning up against the couch with his head on the cushion and arm draped over Dean’s middle. Cas felt Dean’s skin, still too hot and dry, and coaxed him awake long enough to take another drink and dose of medicine.
Static overtook the station and the driver fiddled with the dial again snapping Dean back to the moment. The spring days had been lengthening but Dean looked concerned as out the window of the cab he saw the sun crossing to its downward arc. He needed to be there to see the sunset. To hear the waves. It wasn’t November, but it was still early enough in the year that the beach should be somewhat quiet.
He suddenly feared Cas might think it was too sappy. Maybe he’d only want the hardened, flippant bad boy persona Dean showed to everyone else. Right now, Dean was feeling more like the scared little boy who'd always put on a brave face for Sammy, desperate to pretend everything would be okay, all the while just one more worry away from breaking apart.
‘I don't know Rachel, I just know I can't tolerate even being around him anymore after everything he did. So he can't be a part of it.’
Dean felt edgy as he sat with Sam and Jess at the round table in the club. He realized far too late to do anything about it that all he had in his closet that was even remotely wearable was a pair of Levis and a plain black t-shirt. He hoped he wasn't underdressed but as he glanced around he saw that most people were in jeans, though a few looked like they had just come from the office.
Like some kind of small window of opportunity may have opened. Still, Cas was afraid he’d end up crushed like a bird who thinks the way is clear to fly through only to end bloody, smashing it's head on glass walls he didn’t see.
She'd set herself up with a chair and a giant bowl of candy on the front steps of her house. Having sprained her ankle at work last week she was grateful she wouldn’t have to hobble through the neighborhood on crutches. Cas offered to take Tommy and Jenny up and down a few streets in the neighborhood for her.
Resting was good. Resting wasn’t dead. Resting implied consciousness and recovering from whatever put him there. Or did it? What put him there?
Fuck this, he was going to find out. But just as Dean started to rise up to approach, the doctor motioned for Balthazar to follow him behind the ER doors to where the patients' rooms were. And just like that, it was over.
Then there were the closeted ones. They tended to be kinder on the surface. Wedding rings on their fingers and family pictures in the wallet but all eyes or hands in the wrong places when someone wasn’t looking, as if a hand job from the waitstaff or even an after shift motel tryst was something you could order a la carte. Dean wished he could say he’d never acquiesced, but sometimes John would be gone for weeks without leaving them means for survival and Sam needed clothes on his back and food in his belly and at seventeen Dean had exhausted every source of funds just keeping the heat and the lights on in winter.
“I have a few contacts who could make a place for a guy who knows engines. If you need a job or a place temporarily, you know, until you’re ready to head on home, you can call.”
Dean looked at her and recovered. His expression now a mask of calm. “I...I never did this sort of thing really, no. ‘Cept once with my brother.” Dean looked to spot the trio, smiling again as the kids ran across the street to the next house, Cas in his cat ears following protectively behind them. This was, Dean thought, what childhood
Fred stared right back, unapologetic. Then Fred started talking. He knew the signs because he had been in Dean’s shoes once. After dropping Dean off, Fred had driven straight into the nearest town, phoned in a potential suicide to the police station, then drove back to the dunes in time to see Dean collapse in the sand. He stayed with Dean until the police arrived, yelling for them to radio an ambulance, then stayed longer until the ambulance arrived.
You know I’ve never been good at writing letters, but lately it seems I’m no good at saying what I need to in person either. Yesterday, when you left there was so much I wanted to tell you, but I didn’t want to hurt you anymore than I already have and I couldn’t get the words out in time.
“So for now I guess we’ll have to settle for me kissing my own palm and listening to the witty banter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles. You’re a cruel mistress Cas, teasing me like this.”
Dean closed the book again, setting it on the bedside table and pulling the cord on the lamp to turn out the light.
I love you Dean. I’ve never stopped. I know now that I never will. It’s okay. We will be okay, even if we can’t be okay together. We tried. We tried our best, and despite how it ended, it was something really beautiful. Whenever I hear the waves crashing on the beach, it will be you and I together.
Dean took his bike out riding through town. Every shock of messy dark hair he passed made him do a double-take. Cas was here in this city somewhere. He stopped at a food vendor by the beach to get a burger and fries. This was a good city for Cas, Dean thought. He could see the ocean any day he wanted to.
Cas looked down for a moment, blinking back a tear of relief and smiled in thought. Looking back to Dean his eyes were joyful...Dean marveled in the knowledge that
Sam had hugged Cas, wished him good luck. Cas hadn’t asked about Dean. But before he got in the car he turned and said. “Say goodbye to Jess for me, and to Dean when you see him again.”
“It's so good to see you.” He said, pulling her soft body close, a note of genuine longing in his voice. “You look beautiful.”
“You didn’t have to do that Sammy,” Dean’s shame was abundant. He softened his tone, “Look, I’m not going anywhere, I promise.”
After graduating pre-med Cas at first felt unmoored and mutinous to the idea of furthering his studies in medicine. Adrift that summer with Balthazar, he at times felt like he’d been all but pushed into it by his father and the idea of pursuing it any further seemed wasteful.
Cas didn’t respond, and when the door closed, taking the sliver of light from the hallway with it, Cas laid back down and welcomed the darkness. It somehow made it easier to deny the tears that streaked his face and wet the pillow beneath his head. He could still feel, but not have to see, the effect of the sobs that silently wracked his body. Cas had sworn to himself so many times that he would be stronger than this. He was just so
They ordered delivery, watched an episode of Grizzly Adams, or what Balthazar jokingly called “the Bear with the Bear.” The show was way too hokey for Balthazar but Cas could tolerate hokey and corny tonight. The idea of being able to live off in the wilderness somewhere where no one could fuck with you, or tell you how to live still appealed to him in some ways. Besides he liked the animals, and with nothing else on until the networks showed a movie at nine it would have to do. It was strangely...okay. They genuinely laughed together a few times for the first time in what felt like ages. All of the tension and unrealistic expectations exorcised from their space. If Balthazar were being honest though, it probably helped knowing that Cas wasn’t running straight to Dean.
The feeling of impending doom settled over Cas as he suddenly recognized the man as one of his father's old investment advisors who had been to their home several times. One of those astute financiers who prided themselves on always picking the next big ticket in the market and never forgetting a face.
. “You’ve never exactly been a ray of sunshine ...but lately,” Sam tilted his head, giving Dean a knowing look. “You gotta get off this Cas thing Dean.”
“Don’t you even dare!” Cas faced him fiercely, keeping his voice low so as not to upset Rachel in the next room. “Dean was there for me when
Cas pulled the covers up to his chin, feeling a mixture of blissful exhilaration with a kickback of mental exhaustion. A smile radiated from deep within Cas as the sound of rain pounded on the roof, lulling him into a calm, contented sleep.
Cas smiled understanding “Dean, yes.” he spoke, gently tilting Dean's head up until he opened his eyes again, centering in on Castiel’s. “I ..love..you.” Castiel said slowly for emphasis. “I have for...well..for a long time in your years now. But you don’t have to worry if that’s not what you want. I have always been your friend and will always be your friend. It’s okay.”
Oftentimes Dean found himself twisting, pulling and arching his body to extricate himself from the warm tangle of Cas’s limbs while he slept, so he could get up, brew the coffee and make them breakfast on a Sunday.
“Jeez Cas...If I’d known you’d sell your body for the promise of perogies I’d’ve brought some with me.” Dean smirked.
“I’m good,” Cas said refilling Dean’s coffee and pouring himself some, and pulling up a chair. “The wound is totally healed and I feel my strength returning. Thank you both for everything.”
Dean thought, but given he’d just given Dean near a week no questions asked for being sick Dean felt he owed him this. He would find a way to be there for Sam in the off-hours. San Francisco wasn’t all that far after all.
Cas smiled thinking about the summers he and Rachel spent playing hide and seek, making fairy houses and chasing fireflies. He and Rachel had been a team against the tyranny of their elder brothers. Gabriel liked to tease and trick them, but he was always good-natured in the end, sometimes standing in between them and Michael, whose “jokes” and pranks were always more malicious in nature. It was as if, as the first child, he resented having to share their parents’ attention with everyone who came after him.
“Look Cas, no pressure, I know you’re shy around new people. But I promise, Fred and Mildred and Garth and his family are great. I’d really like you to meet them.”
“You once said you wished you could take me dancing.” Dean forgot his earlier lack of enthusiasm for this choice of venue when he saw Cas’s lips part slightly in surprise.
the right person...that is if you ever want to try that….or not,” he shrugged again. “I’m good either way, Cas.”
It was made very clear to Cas by Michael, who arranged their father’s funeral, that he should not show up for the sake of the family. Thanks to the rumor mill that Hester facilitated within their family’s social circle, it was well known that Cas was in an “inappropriate relationship” with a “known criminal” and he would just bring more shame on the family by his presence. So on the day Charles Novak was laid to rest Cas went to a church by himself to light a candle and pray for his father’s soul. He then lit another and prayed for Dean’s life, pleading with God for his safe return from the war.
Dean got up deciding to try Cas again. Taking his coffee with him he searched out the bank of payphones near the elevator. He dialed the number.
Inias shook Dean’s hand, followed by Garth’s and nodded and smiled to them all one by one before returning to his rounds.
He turned to Hannah. “He told me what you did for him....he told me about Michael. I’m glad he has a friend like you.”
Dean smiled at him, chuckling softly before leaning in to catch his lips again...running his fingers up Cas’s sides, delighting in the feel of his warm skin, and the rise and fall of each rib his fingers slid over.
Unconvinced of her blamelessness, she smiled wanly and took the dish from his hands to bring it into the kitchen.
that would allow him to think of his father with a measure of peace. Any sign or acknowledgment of his father’s love. Instead, their estrangement had been recognized publicly and legally in his father’s final message to his children, signed and notarized in the state of California.
Dean knew he was messed up. The flashbacks were a more rare occurrence than when he first came back from the war, but Dean still had episodes where for days or weeks at a time he couldn’t find a spark of happiness inside him. He was, as he’d remarked to Benny, just shoveling snow. How long could he pretend to Cas that everything could be the way it once was?
He reached back in memory and saw Cas through the lens of the camera that day at the beach, happy, waving and smiling. Putting his hands up to shout “I love you!” to Dean, even as the wind carried his voice away.
“But” Benny continued, fixing Dean with his eyes now as if he were the only one in the room, “the Romans knew if they held on, if they lit a candle, if they kept moving forward they too would rise out of their own darkness again. They
Dean hummed pleasantly remembering the dream of the house with the picket fence. “Flowers or vegetable gardens?”
Ketch’s head tilted back, his eyes bright as he suppressed a laugh. He could feel a well-intentioned history lesson coming on and often chided Benny on his inability to master the subtle art of the segway.
“Now, here’s where I really should be minding my own business,” Rufus hesitated, “and here’s where, if you were still in treatment with me I would have to hold my tongue - you with me?”
Dean felt like he couldn’t move. He was rooted in place. Cas, only a few steps away, held him there with his eyes. Those eyes. He had missed those eyes, longed for them...and now they were boring into him with a look of tenderness, questioning and a bit of uncertainty.
“I’m calling Bobby and letting him know you can’t come in tomorrow,” Cas said, recovering, pulling off the last sock and letting Dean slip out of his jeans so that now he was in just his t-shirt and boxers.  “What’s his home number? I only know the shop’s.”
It was Sunday evening and he’d just settled in to watch a baseball game when he answered the phone. He heard it immediately in Dean’s voice - the fear, the doubt, the near hopelessness that comes when one realizes for the first time that the victory they thought they’d secured isn’t one free of insurgency, but a protracted struggle with periods of detente and conflagration. Rufus believed that ultimately trauma could be healed if one learned to be patient and forgiving with oneself. This would be Dean’s greatest challenge.
“Freaking suburbs,” Dean laughed, hugging the fresh sheet tighter around him and closing his eyes again. “And still...after that it seems like a good idea to you?”
“I wish that were true Cas, but I’ll take the day,” his words were interrupted by a series of coughs that made Cas frown to hear. He finished with, “I promise….’
Bobby stayed silent, figuring whatever was going on with Dean, and he had a pretty good idea what that was, Dean didn’t want to talk about. He seemed to be calming down, and though his eyes were open he could tell that Dean was somewhere far off, inside himself.
“Thanks Sam. Talk to you tomorrow. Tell Jess I’ll meet her at ten unless she’s busy with something else."
Dean paid the bill, pulled on his flannel and stood looking back to where Cas had gone. After a few minutes passed, tired of sitting idly, he headed back in the direction Cas went to meet him on the way.
did you suddenly decide that you wanted to see me? You disappeared for years. Why now?” Cas shook his head, genuinely perplexed, “Why at all?”
“Yeah.” Cas smiled, relaxing a little at Dean’s appreciative comment. “Baskerville weather,” he mused.
anymore. Every time I close my eyes there’s blood... everywhere...screams. Even when they’re open sometimes. It doesn’t stop. It
Dean turned and glanced at the face of the British man. He looked scared. The receptionist was trying to calm him.
“Yeah, I’m here,” Dean swallowed. He thought about their date last night and thought he knew the answer, but after the sadness and shock he’d been feeling all day he needed to hear Cas say it.
Balthazar placed his hand possessively on the back of Cas’s chair and waved a waitress over. “What’ll you have Cassie?” he asked.
“Dean!” Cas called, pulling desperately at the buttons of Dean’s jeans. “Get these off you!...Oh god,
“It’s okay Dean,” Cas chuckled, running his free hand along Dean’s arm. “I assumed you wouldn’t want us to sub for some stranger so he walked away disappointed.”
Dean’s head swam, drunk with the longing in Cas’s eyes. He’d had plenty of conquests who’d looked at him desiringly, but this was different. This was some strange measure of love, sincerity, and desire blended together that answered his own perfectly. He and Cas belonged together like thunder and lightning. One without the other, incomplete, searching, unsatisfied -  together they made sense, and would make the heavens tremble.
Since the incident this summer with Cas, a door had opened. Talking about Cas in that way became much more matter of fact between them. Who was he kidding? Sam knew they had lived together, Sam knew they were lovers. Sam knew Dean’s leaving had broken them both apart and Sam knew that Dean still carried a torch, no matter how much he had tried to quench it.
He held it back, afraid it might be too much too soon. “I wish you were here right now,” Dean said instead.
Castiel’s breath caught at the sensation. It was the first moment he was certain that Dean reached out to touch him in a way that was anything other than “brotherly.” Now it was Cas’s turn to tremble as his hunter gently pulled him closer, placing his other arm around him, his hand gently resting on the sensitive space between his folded wings. Cas moved a hand to Dean’s face, the other gently feeling through Dean’s hair as Dean, eyes closed, urged them closer.
Balthazar told Dean about the bender, the overdose. Embittered, he related Cas’s declaration that Balthazar would never be Dean. Balthazar said it like everything that was happening was Dean’s fault. Maybe it was. But then he told him about the fight they had Saturday night and how he decided to go home to London for a few days.
The last year of pre-med included several shadowing programs where Cas and other students made rounds with doctors in different fields of medicine. At the time he was still struggling with the profound loss of Dean, and could barely drag himself out of bed each day to show up for rounds. Looking back at it now, he remembered moments where he became so absorbed in the work he observed that more than just a few times the day flew by in what seemed like mere moments. Cas knew work like this could give him the sense of purpose he wanted for himself.
“Fuck yes!” he groaned, his head dizzy, greedily claiming Dean’s mouth, his tongue slipping past the gate of his lips. Cas was drawn back into him over and over, needing to feel the plush softness of Dean’s lips against his own, licking into Dean’s mouth to taste his sweetness and feel their tongues sliding wet and slick against each other.
“No Cas!” Dean put his hand gently on Cas’s chest as if to stay him. “Don’t be sorry. I’m sorry someone fed you full of that bullshit - that you’re nothing special. You’re special Cas. You say I barely know you and okay - so I only met you last month. But already I know that you're smart, and sweet, and sarcastic, and all kinds of hot.”
They were quiet on the rest of the drive, but filled with delighted anticipation and it felt right not to break the spell with words. Finally, they pulled into the lot of Dean’s apartment building. Dean pulled the keys from the ignition, looking over to Cas. Cas was wide-eyed.
Cas sighed, the muscles in his throat aching as he tried to control his voice to make any kind of normal response. Instead, he blinked - a fat heavy tear dropping on the papers, smearing the ink.
Cas strode purposefully over towards Dean. He realized the storm of emotions he was feeling must be written all over his face as Dean swallowed nervously as if bracing for impact.
A little laugh like chiming bells burst forth from Cas as he smiled down at their hands, eyes moist, and he smiled, and smiled some more, before raising his eyes back to Dean, whose beautiful face looked tenderly back - eyes soft, and deep, and dark with longing.
How could Dean not know by now? Seconds passed as he gathered himself to keep his voice from breaking.
“You already have,” Cas said softly, a smile on his lips. “I wish more than anything that you could be here right now, but the flowers are beautiful, and hearing your voice again…it makes me very happy.”
On day six Sam and Bobby arrived, less than 24 hours from the time Dean gave over the names and numbers. Dean refused to see them. He was too embarrassed. Sam left Dean a letter telling him how much he loved him, how he could come home with him and Jess and Bobby and everything would work out. Dean just knew he couldn’t bear that.
It was purposely vague and yet somehow Dean hoped Cas would understand exactly what he meant. Dean waited for any response.
“Screw it,” Dean muttered to himself, and suddenly he was back in April of 1965, confronting pretentious frat boys and causing a stir on a Saturday night, and he was about to pursue a shy boy, with beautiful blue eyes and glasses and take him on the ride of his life.
“I understand,” Cas said, and this time, he truly did. He felt silly, and a little selfish that he had worried over the reason for Dean’s absence before.
“You’re fulla shit Cas. Look what you did for Hannah and those kids tonight. You can read people and you can tell what they need, or if you don’t, you think and figure it out and you care enough to give it.” Dean was still so weak, those few words had taken an effort.
Cas kept one hand stroking Dean’s cock, the other moving swiftly to grip his face, fingers pressing firmly into one cheek, his thumb on the other, giving him complete control over Dean’s mouth, pulling his chin up until Dean could only stare back into Cas’s dark eyes.
“I need to know if you still mean it.” Dean blurted out before he could stop himself, “What you said...when you left me..”
It got quiet between them for a moment, Cas’s eyes were drawn to the rise and fall of Dean’s chest, moving up to see the skin flutter in shadow along Dean’s Adam's Apple as he swallowed, his eyes traveling up to his lips before meeting his Dean's again.
Cas didn’t know what to say. “Thank you...for telling me that,” Cas said finally to break the silence.
“Move over! Make room!” Benny said as he wedged another chair between Sam and Dean. The comfortable distance that he and Castiel had enjoyed was suddenly less so, as Dean’s knee brushed Cas’s and they both pulled away startled, actually tensing their muscles now to keep from intruding on each other’s space.
They entered through a door on the side of the garage and climbed an enclosed staircase to the second floor. Cas led him in and over to a sitting area that functioned as a living room and offered Dean a Coke.
Cas grabbed both sides of Dean’s face, pulling him in and kissing his lips hungrily, teasing slightly with his tongue. “I know, silly,” he said between kisses. “This is
Cas blushed, shaking his head as if to deny it, all the while feeling like she was probing at a thousand exposed nerves. He started fiddling with a stray thread on the edge of a throw pillow he held in his lap.
A woman got up first to welcoming applause and sang acapella in what sounded like Arabic - the club was mesmerized, Dean chanced a glance at Cas. His blue eyes gazing ahead as if following some far off  treasure.
Cas knew one of them had been for him and one for Sam and Jess, but the last thing he wanted now was a reminder of Dean’s stupid happy grin… of the time they had Halloween together….or of this day.
“Rachel.” Dean smiled, putting out his hand and then withdrawing it, realizing how covered in grime it still was.
Dean joined her vigil in the waiting room of the Cardiology wing, ushering her back to the grey couch she’d been sitting on when they arrived and taking a space next to her. Garth left briefly to grab them each a coffee from the hospital cafeteria downstairs.
Nothing like so many of the new developments Dean saw going in along the outskirts of Sacramento where, for expediency, the builders bulldozed every tree in sight, leaving cul de sacs of oversized homes towering over hastily planted matchstick trees, that is if they bothered to plant them at all.
Music figures heavily in this chapter. If you enjoy the chapter I strongly encourage you to use the music links at the end to listen and reimagine the scenes with these versions of the songs mentioned.
Before Dean could open his mouth Benny supplied “Well gee, Dean and I met when he got a job with a buddy of mine owns an auto shop in Oregon.”
The money his mother, who had held him and loved him before she died, left Cas, it wasn’t much - but
Dean closed his eyes at the sound of his name in Cas’s gravelly voice, deeper now for the years that passed. It had been so long. Dean never imagined a singular sound could unmake him.
"Clearly.." Dean flushed as he cleared his throat. "uh, clearly Cas anyone who thought that would be sorely mistaken."
Dean slid his arms under Cas’s thighs, encouraging him to tip the cant of his hips up and toward him, giving Dean better access. Cas’s hand’s carded through Dean’s hair as he swirled his tongue around the head of his cock, bringing a hand back to fondle his balls, gently rolling and caressing as Dean took Cas into his mouth. Cas’s hips thrust up involuntarily as Dean flicked his tongue back and forth along the sensitive bundle of nerves just under the head. He could taste more precum leaking from Cas, lapping it up before taking him deep once again, hollowing his cheeks as he sucked Cas against his soft pallet.
Dean angrily pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes, his nails biting into his own scalp as he yelled in frustration “
Dean came into the shop a little after eleven the day after his evening out with Cas, having driven there directly from San Francisco that morning.  He went straight to work without even telling Bobby he was back. Seeing the closed determined set of Dean’s jaw as he worked with a wrench, Bobby was a little afraid to ask what happened. Finally, he just came out with it.
“I don’t know.” Dean shook his head as if Cas could read his body language over the phone. “He’s kind of messed up right now. I don’t know how I could have missed it.”
She hesitated, then looked away towards the approaching children, “You seem like a really nice guy….Be careful Dean, with his heart... and your own.”
Dean swallowed the comment he was about to make. His mouth fell open, his chest rising and falling visibly, near breathless from the emotional toll. They stood on the lawn, staring at each other in mutual disbelief.
a theater chosen for its distance halfway between Bobby’s shop in San Francisco and Cas’s place. Originally a small opera house built back in the time of the Gold Rush, it had seen better days, but had a support column sporting bullet holes that according to a sign were made in the attempt to apprehend the outlaw Tom Bell, a name that Cas had never heard, but one that had Dean, an expert on all things gunslinger, beaming and rattling off aliases of the “Outlaw Doc” who’d apparently been the first outlaw ever to rob a stagecoach. Dean looked thoroughly chastened when Cas asked him what had happened to the passengers of the coach, and he had to admit that an innocent woman was killed in the robbery.
Dean was so used to being the one in control. His excitement mounted as Cas gripped his hair tighter, giving himself over as Cas took charge, guiding him up and down his cock. Cas was careful and gentle about it - easing up when Dean's throat made small involuntary sounds of protest. Still, Dean pulled him in further, wanting to take him deeper than he'd taken anybody before, more than that - he wanted Cas to know it - that Dean belonged to him. He looked up at Cas through tears that formed in the corners of his eyes as he worked to relax his throat against reflex, his head bobbing as his tongue massaged along Cas's length, drawing pleasure from him.
Cas suddenly didn’t care that he was on the lawn in the middle of the neighborhood lit up by street lamps - didn’t care that he was going to get sick after this. He took Dean’s face in both hands and pressed a kiss to his lips for the
Meeting Castiel's eyes he was for a moment quieted, both of them lost in each other as they had been so many times before. Dean swallowed...hesitated...but the words couldn't be held back anymore.
Cas hung up the phone and sat for a moment on the bed in Rachel’s room. Dean was right. There was never enough time. Something was always getting in the way. Cas felt like he was running an obstacle course juggling two jobs. Yes, it had served to keep him busy, keep his tortured thoughts at bay as he made a break for independence and resettled in a new place. It had served to pad his funds for med school and give him a footing for the future, but that was before - before Cas thought it would ever be possible to have a future again with Dean. Now it seemed it was making it damn near impossible for them to have any chance of rekindling anything between them.
"Breathe you idiot," Dean thought to himself, "Shit..you’re acting like a scared little boy with a crush." But he couldn’t help the shaking, as a tear traced down his cheek. What the hell was he feeling? Was it fear? Joy? No not joy, not yet. Here was Cas….. Castiel. A Seraph for freak's sake! A warrior of heaven. More than a warrior, a badass general.  He was a celestial wave of …..what was it he had called it? Thick dark wavy bed-head...messy, beautiful like a storm. Eyes...blue, like a sea of Creation. Of all the things Dean had seen in his life there was nothing more awe-inspiring than what stood before him now. Familiar, yet still awe-inspiring. Seeing Cas was on the one hand like finally being "home,"....."safe." Cas was alive and there was no one he needed more. Yet at the same time he felt the opposite of safe. Dean was literally shaking with so many emotions including a fear so strong he could taste the bitterness in his mouth. Here in heaven, Cas was back at full power and in his element, what could Dean possibly have to offer him now? What if Cas was over it?
Dean thanked her and walked down the lawn towards his bike, arriving at it about the same time the group did.
I will be gone this week so while I try to post on Thursday and Sunday, Thursday will likely not happen. Be back soon though!
Jess asked Benny about his family and after a few minutes Cas looked around in search of the reason for Balthazar’s prolonged absence. He was standing at the bar at the back of the club having a smoke and chatting with the bartender.
Gabriel joined Stephen and Rachel in the adjoining room leaving Cas to try to recover his composure. It wasn’t Thanksgiving without family pissing you off now was it? Or so he’d heard. Still, he found himself worrying.
He put down the receiver and stared for a minute at the phone. He didn’t know whether to be pissed, or whether he should actually “sod off” - whatever the fuck that meant. I mean what would he say if the situation were reversed?
. Except now he realized he hadn’t been keeping it just for himself. He’d been keeping it for himself
Trigger warning for PTSD relapse and negative labels once given by some to Vietnam Vets upon returning home. By NO means do I believe anyone should be labeled as such for their service!
They were in the kitchen one night after dinner and Dean was washing dishes while Mildred put away the leftover food. A song came on the radio and he stopped to turn the station. Elvis, he always turned off Elvis. Mildred noticed his eyes were sad.
When the meetings officially "ended" for the evening many of the guys hung back to shoot the shit about less serious topics, often grabbing another coffee or one of the leftover baked goods left out for them by the local chapter of the Unitarian Women's League who met before them. Benny pulled Dean aside on one such occasion.
“I don’t know….why don’t you pick?” he flashed his most charming grin. Harmless flirting was always good for a distraction anyway. Dean figured their age difference and the ring on her finger made it safe enough.
“Jesus no Cas. You just said your sister’s coming. Spend time with her. For the record, I’m really glad you have her back again.”
Cas’s hands stroked along Dean’s back, bending his neck to kiss his hair. Dean stopped to kiss at a freckle just above Cas’s right nipple, before taking his nipple into his mouth and swirling his tongue around, sucking and swirling and teasing with his tongue and teeth, drawing a breathy whimper from Cas.
“I know it wasn’t easy for you to share your backstory Dean,” Benny nodded. “I’m proud of you brother...honored actually that you let us in,” he said, and Dean knew by his face it was real.
Dean smiled, warm and genuine, “Absolutely nothing…..everything’s,..everything’s right,” a quick, joyful laugh escaping his lips. It was infectious and Cas couldn’t help but smile back.
Sometimes...oftentimes, the loss was still so fresh and profound that it threatened to swallow him. So yeah, Cas liked to party. Getting high dulled the sadness. It was easy with Balthazar then, to kiss him, to make him smile, to be good to him the way he had been good to Cas. When he was high he felt happy...affectionate.
Cas’s ears were ringing slightly from the club on the ride home and Dean left the radio off. It had started to rain. Whenever he could spare a hand from the wheel Dean reached down to take Cas’s hand in his. The closer they got to Dean’s apartment the more Cas’s insides buzzed and hummed. Cas felt his hand shaking slightly as Dean took it again. Dean must have felt it too, because he turned slightly, regarding him.
“....No,” Balthazar hadn’t moved and after a moment Cas sighed, lifting up onto his elbow but still not turning to look at him as he spoke. “We'll talk tomorrow. I’m not doing this now, and you shouldn’t expect me to after you took off, and after whatever the fuck that was out there.”
He could be affectionate to just about any warm body near him if he was high enough. Shit, he even made out with Meg once when they crashed at some hash house she led him to after a night out. They were fully grinding with half of their clothes discarded in a heap before a wave of clarity came over Cas and he realized what was happening. He stopped just short of fucking her. Cas pushed himself off and scrambled to grab his clothes while she rolled on her back, her tits exposed, giggling, telling him how much she wanted his cock inside her. Telling him he could take her from behind if it helped.
he muttered to himself, swallowing hard, shaking the surprising though not unpleasing image away before taking the final steps and sliding back into their booth.
Cas crossed his arms, one hand reaching up to rub the tension from his brow. Trying to will himself not to shatter emotionally into a million pieces in front of the neighborhood.
“Huh!” Dean snorted an almost laugh.  “No….. Queer.” Dean looked defiantly up at Rufus, sure of the reaction he’d get, daring the man not to show disgust.
She put down the chef's knife she was using and passed it to him along with a cutting board covered with a partially prepared charcuterie. “Chop these for me.” She pointed to the cheeses and vegetables next to the platter. “In a minute everything will be prepped and we’ll be just waiting for the oven to finish doing its work. Then we can nibble on these in the meantime and watch some football or a movie while we wait for the turkey to be done.”
“Uuh...yeah, maybe, - he’s just a pal of mine. I think you’d like him.” Dean said now, making it up as he went along.
“Sir, if you’ll come with me,” an older woman insisted, stepping in to address the man and guiding him away from the doors to the inner ward where the patients received their treatment.
“Dean, yes.” Cas chuckled, cutting off Dean’s nervous rambling - just another little tell that made hope spring in his chest.
Dean breathed in deeply...dropped his head into his hands again rubbing his forehead and temples before finally muttering, “I’m sorry Bobby, never mind...keep driving.”
“I’m not much of a church goer myself, always thought some of what’s in here must be a lot of hooey. Fred’s more of the religious type, but some of the Psalms I enjoy, and I have to say, the apostle Paul was on to something here.”
Cas had scolded him both playfully and urgently more than once, especially in public. Growing up the way he did, Dean never had to care about how he looked to the rest of the world. Never had to keep himself in check. He did what he wanted and consequences be damned, he’d find a way to handle it.
Dean couldn’t bring himself to thank him. He wasn’t exactly overjoyed to be alive, but at the same time, he was glad he wasn’t dead. He tried not to think about the outcome if Fred hadn’t meddled. In hindsight, it kind of terrified him. He did agree to a game of cards though. Fred was good, it was the first time in a long time anyone had given Dean a run for his money. Before he left, Fred told him his change from the fare would be waiting for him with his personal belongings when he was ready to be discharged. Dean didn't know it yet, but Fred left the whole fare.
“Not you dear,…..So, where were we?” the man in front of Dean crooned. He leaned in, his voice grave and resonant, little more than a whisper, meant just for Dean. “Ah yes, I remember. Punish the body, cleanse the soul.” Its gravelly depth reminded him of Cas. The sound of it next to his ear made something inside Dean shudder.
A slower song signaled half of the dance floor to clear as people took a break to grab more drinks. Cas made to leave, but Dean surprised himself by pulling him back and holding him close to
Dean felt the years lift from his shoulders. He breathed deeply, surprising himself as a laugh broke out of him for the first time since their date last night.
I curiously read another T&S inspired fic. that I enjoyed and wanted to share. It's a short one and I think many of us can relate to Dean in this one. Don't worry! - It ends well.
Castiel felt the blood drain from every extremity until he thought he might be sick. God as his witness, it wasn’t money or stocks or property Cas had hoped for on that day, but maybe one last word, anything, he had come hoping for something from the ‘testament’ part of the ‘Last Will and Testament.’
“What are they?” Dean asked, pointing to figures at the tops of each column. Each column had four figures at its pinnacle. Their backs to the world, heads resting on their arms in a sorrowful pose, faces hidden from view. So many of them...as if an entire city had fallen and they were all that was left to mourn the dead.
"What?!” Dean’s eyes narrowed, his face twisting into a scowl as he turned to look towards the restroom doors.
“Benny?” Dean said surprised? He turned, stood and gave Benny a brief hug. Somehow this felt like a rescue. He was never so glad to see someone in his life.
After, Fred brought Dean to the garage where Garth agreed to put him to work on a trial basis. Minimum wage was all he could afford but it came with a place to stay in a furnished loft above the barn on Garth’s property. Part of the condition of Dean’s release was that he attend a group for vets in the area on a weekly basis. Rufus put him in touch with Benny, an army vet turned social worker with a thick Louisiana accent who had done three tours himself in Vietnam before coming home and moving to Valens. Benny ran an unofficial support group for vets that met a couple of times a week.
“I appreciate you bringing me home, I really do, but anyway why are you still here?” He knew the longer Sam stayed the more questions he’d be badgered with.
“How can you even ask that Cas?” Dean’s voice was tight. It came out louder and harsher than he’d intended. “Because I’m no good for you. I can’t even take you out for a drive without fucking everything up and coming apart. You deserve to be with someone who’s not fucking broken.”
“It’s all pretty weird at this point,” Cas’s voice was tight. After a moment he sighed adding. “I’ll think about it Dean.”
“Great, thanks! Let’s go, Jenny!” Cas grabbed her hand, he needed to get away to get his bearings. “Where’s your bucket, Tommy?” The little boy ran back into the house emerging seconds later with a bright orange bucket in the shape of a jack-o-lantern.
It was Sunday afternoon - Halloween. Still early, but late enough that little children, anxious all day to go door to door begging for goodies could finally get their wish. Jenny was standing on the lawn with Cas, making him pretend to stir an imaginary cauldron with her as she sang a Halloween song she learned in school. She adopted a quiet, tremulous voice.
he told himself, trying to rid himself now of the pain of too-tight shoes. He toweled off and threw on pajama pants.
“Benny’s a good friend, who helped me through a rough patch after my tour,” Dean said as if to clear up any confusion as to their relationship. Cas looked curiously at Benny, and back to Dean - questions in his eyes that Dean wanted to answer…. but it probably didn’t matter anymore. Cas had Balthazar now.
“No, look at me!” Dean pulled his chin up slightly and Cas snapped his eyes open as Dean’s thumb continued to rub against his lips.
The sincerity in her voice made Cas thankful the conversation was happening over the phone as he wiped fresh tears from his eyes, his heart aching over the loss, all over again.
Before they’d left, he’d handed Cas a backpack to strap on but refused to tell him what was inside until they got to their destination.
Cas laughed. “I listen to the radio a lot and when I’m alone there’s no one to complain no matter how tone-deaf I am when I sing along.”
“Yeah, okay.” Dean smiled. He knew Sam would feel better about leaving him if he made sure he ate something first, so he allowed it. Dean had grown up taking care of Sammy, now it seemed Sam was always taking care of Dean.
“You moron! Figures. Only a Winchester could do a mental one-eighty in so little time. Six hours ago you were floating around the shop like your fairy godmother just got you a dress for the ball, now you’re Mopey the eighth damn dwarf! Moved on huh? Is that why he came here and introduced you to his sister?”
He only did it one more time before the man’s business trip was over and he returned to his family. Dean wondered about them. They probably had food and heat and new clothes. He knew this man was a predator, and yet when the man said goodbye cupping his cheek Dean closed his eyes and leaned into the touch, part of him hoping the man would come back for him. It was more affection than anyone other than his little brother had shown him in years.
Cas moved his hand to cup Dean’s as he gripped his coffee mug, brushing his thumb over his knuckles. Dean let go and laced his fingers in Cas’s. They didn’t dare look at each other. Neither spoke, two pairs of eyes fixed on their interlocking hands. Cas lifted their entwined fingers to his lips, gently grazing the back of Dean’s hand, his eyes closed.
“I looked around but Lisa, my ex, told me he just left. So I rode around a couple of streets ‘til I found him.”
“YAY CAS! FINALLY!” Tommy yelled jumping up and down in excitement as they started down the driveway.
Dean was really glad that Sam couldn’t see him as tears came unbidden and sudden. He schooled his voice to hide it, “Yeah...I want that.”
He was parked against a copse of trees at the edge of the lot. Dean rushed to open the door to the back of the Impala letting Cas slide inside and out of the rain, scooting in to join him and shaking the rain from his hair like a dog.
He pulled himself out of bed and pulled on a t-shirt and sweats. It was evening and he still felt weak from the effect of the hangover. He thought about warming up a can of soup. Putting a pot on the stove and turning on the burner he moved to make a small pot of coffee. Dean tried to find something to distract him on the television as he ate, but the dream had intensified the dark feeling he’d had since yesterday. He couldn’t shake it.
Bobby turned so he could still see the road but glance at Dean. Dean was distraught. He pulled over.
He wore soft blue jeans with a forest green button down shirt that Jess assured him brought out the green of his eyes in the best possible way when she’d taken him shopping the night before. She’d also made sure he sat for a haircut and dragged him through a maze of fragrance counters on the main floor of a department store to help him pick out just the right cologne.
“Screw those guys!” Dean muttered. “What about something like Greenpeace? Switch teams Sammy. I mean is the money really worth your soul?”
“I’m sorry Balthazar,” Cas whispered again. Cas knew Balthazar was worried he might’ve done this on purpose. “When I get like that…” he searched for the right words, “it’s not like I was trying to land in the hospital you know….I just, lose myself sometimes.”
He somehow got Cas to stay on the line with him through the whole thing as he slowly worked up the courage to ask to see him again. Taking Baby out on a long drive, at first seemed like a good cover. In trying to be nonchalant about it though he’d actually made it much worse, tripping over his words miserably as he tried to make it seem like no big deal if Cas didn’t want to. Somehow despite his fumbling idiocy, Cas said yes! Dean was thankful that no Orwellian telescreens existed to betray his excited fist pump at Cas’s answer.
“This is bullshit.” Dean muttered. Getting up and making to walk out of the room bare assed in the hospital gown if he had to. He was grabbed by the bigger of the two orderlies and restrained.
Dean could hurt Cas if he wanted to - could incapacitate him. He’d been trained to do it. But Dean had only once lost control and hurt Cas inadvertently, and he’d never forgiven himself. Dean quickly threw his hands up in defense instead.
As soon as he got into Valens he stopped at a phone booth and tried again. There was no answer. Cas was probably working a late shift, he told himself. The night before Thanksgiving was always a big night for bars and restaurants with so many people traveling to visit friends and family for the holiday and drinking late into the night. Failing to reach Cas, he called Sam, hoping Sam could keep trying for him until Dean could reach Cas himself later.
Cas glanced at the ground near their feet for a second, then looked back to Dean with clear eyes. “No - just me. - Balthazar, he’s...well he’s staying. We’re uh....It was time for me to leave.”
Dean pulled himself off Cas, earning a momentary cry of displeasure. He grabbed at the buckle of Cas’s belt, loosening it and pulling it open, then popping open the button fly of Cas’s jeans. Cas kicked off his sneakers and shimmied off his jeans along with his underwear, kicking them aside.
He flushed, realizing that Dean was still waiting for some kind of verbal response. He knew Dean could fix just about anything, without breaking a sweat, still, he was touched by the offer.
Dean smoothed his hand through Cas’s hair, leaning in and gently pulling him closer, laying tender kisses on his lips, again and again.
“He made terrible accusations Castiel. He said…..” she hesitated but didn’t spare him. “He said you were a 'sexual deviant,' she stated, looking concerned.
“Dean!” Cas shouted, and he swore the figure stopped briefly, looking to the side as if he heard something, before continuing on. Cas tried to follow but traffic blocked him and once he crossed the street himself he spent the next hour feeling desperate - looking fruitlessly down alleyways, through shop windows, and past rush hour bus crowds until he made himself stop.
Dean looked back confused, puzzled, as Rufus' mouth took on a lopsided smirk. A surprised laugh burst from Dean unbidden. And Rufus full-on smiled.
The children’s laughter was both muted and carried by the wind and the surf, high pitched and blending with the sound of the gulls. A boy and a girl rushed out to grab shells and stones as the water receded, only to breathlessly giggle and race back to avoid the surging water, reluctantly obeying their mother’s call as she packed up a blanket and bid them follow her. Dean thought of the way Cas, his Cas, had been so full of joy, childlike almost when last they were here. It had been a good day. He saw it now in his head as if it played through the projector.
“Where the hell am I? What is this? Get off me! Cas!” Dean yelled out as an orderly tried to restrain him back into the bed. The attending physician appeared at the door with a chart.
“I just...it feels like there’s never enough time. Things keep getting in the way….I just want to hold you again.” Dean’s voice was little more than a breath,
Meg got Cas high and then she went to another place altogether. They were ultimately numb and alone, just alone together. Being here with Hannah...there was no oblivion to be had. The pain was overwhelming, there was no escape, but here he wasn’t alone. It was like that with Balthazar at first, before they had disastrously tried to make it into something more. Cas wasn’t sure yet which he preferred. If given a choice in this very instant, he’d probably prefer numbing the pain, but for now, he was forcing himself to handle it. Anyway, as they watched it was nice not to be alone.
Cas chose not to tell Hannah that his usual bender involved copious amounts of coke, smack and alcohol. He couldn’t help but think about the difference now. If he were back in San Francisco he would have gone straight to Meg, straight to oblivion. He felt sad thinking about it now. He liked Meg, even loved her in a strange way. There was something so broken about her that he understood, but maybe he had been using her. He felt a pang of guilt and wondered where she was tonight - if she was okay.
“Do you need your sins cleansed Dean? Because believe it or not I have some expertise in these matters.”
He shouldn’t let Dean just ride home like that. He’d be lucky if the dumbass didn’t get into an accident or end up with pneumonia with how sick he still was. Still, he felt like they had reached a point of no return and there was nothing left but to send Dean on his way to make a choice.
“Yeah…. well, let me give you my number just in case, okay?” Dean waited for Cas to grab a pen and give him his home number, “You can call there, or here for that matter, any time. Whatever you need.”
Cas searched the map and found a nearby park. They parked the car and Cas grabbed the small cooler from the back. There was a playground area near a pavilion where a family party was in progress. A mother lit birthday candles as family members gathered around a child to sing as Cas and Dean made their way past. Further off in the distance Cas saw a bench under a copse of trees. It was a warm day for October so the shade would be nice. A pleasant stream wound just past the copse through the woods, cooling the air there. Dean sat on the bench and accepted the offered sandwich and cola.
Dean saw something in Cas then, and all the nights since, that maybe Dean wished he had inside himself. Maybe that was it. Anima and Animus colliding as Benny would say - though Dean couldn’t have used those words to describe it that way at the time.
Dean smiled slightly, the longing back in his eyes as he looked out toward the streets, but Cas and the children had disappeared.  “Love at first sight.”
Seeing Sam so brokenhearted felt like a knife twisting in Dean’s gut and he was freshly overrun with guilt. He knew it wasn’t his fault, but he wanted to take away Sam’s pain. Then there was the even more gut wrenching realization that he’d caused Cas this kind of pain - only it was worse, because while Sam had been responsible for the actions that drove Jessica to leave, Cas had done
Cas felt shame all over again now as he looked at Dean’s still beautiful face, and knew that he had put those marks there.
“The doctors are in with him now. They’re doing everything they can,” Missouri escorted him to a seat near the desk and grabbed him a cup of water before taking her place back behind the counter. Dean cleaned the coffee he had spilled and then took a seat nearer Balthazar. He pressed his hands against his thighs to keep them from shaking.
Sam’s eyes widened and the guy quickly flicked his attention back to his own table and date when he realized he was caught out.
Sam smiled and nodded goodbye. He told Jess, but he never brought it up to Dean. He figured he would wait until Dean was ready to talk about Cas.
“Dean!” Cas yelled, getting his bearings, trying to make sense of the noise and sulfur in the air and the confusion as another explosion sent a pulsing wave through the air and the ground around them. He looked towards the source of the sounds.
Cas whispered, mouth falling open, eyes hooded as they moved from Dean's face to his cock and back again - until Dean couldn't tell for sure which he was addressing. A strange quiver of shyness crept over Dean at the scrutiny, but then Cas gripped him like Eros himself, pleasuring a lover, his thumb running a circle through the precum that pooled and dripped at the head of Dean's cock before stroking him up and down. Dean's mind went momentarily blank as his whole body chased after the sensation. He sucked in a ragged breath, pressing up into Cas harder, begging faster, his own hand rubbing and stroking over the outline of Cas's cock through his jeans.
You should rest a bit before you try to drive back. I can put on the TV and we can just sit and relax...we don’t have to talk about anything unless you want to.”
Cas grabbed Dean by the arms pulling him up to stand. Dean was clearly disoriented, not answering Cas, looking with blank confusion from him to their surroundings. Dean winced his eyes shut as more bangs sounded and another M80 exploded.
Dean thought…”umm...it was a diner, or a food stand, I think. Cas must have driven us there. I don’t remember leaving the park, but we were at a drive-in ….and then he was pressing ice into my hands.”
By the time the cab pulled into the visitor lot by the beach the meter read $81.84. Dean handed the driver a $100 bill, grabbed his pack and jumped out, not waiting for change.
On day fourteen Dean visited the book-lending room to pass the time. He found a copy of The Odyssey along with The Fellowship of the Ring. He thought he remembered Sam liking that book, or maybe it was Cas. He borrowed them both.
“Right now I have a sweet deal, she’s determined to marry me off to one of her granddaughters, so plies me with extra food every time I go.”
Cas slapped a hand on Dean’s back several times until his coughing stopped. For the life of him he couldn’t help laughing.
Dean knew he was poison now. He wouldn’t let the darkness inside him extinguish Cas’s light. He had moments where he felt shitty about leaving Cas the way he did, but some truths remain even when everything else crumbles to dust.
“You didn’t tell him then did you?” Balthazar looked pleased with himself as Cas looked questioningly back to Dean.
It was unseasonably warm for May and their sweat pooled between them in the humid air, slicking their bodies. Dean’s hands caressed everywhere he could reach, raising himself back up now to meet Cas’s mouth and pouring himself into him, his tongue more demanding, spurred on by the friction Cas’s hand was causing down below.
But Cas didn’t look at him with revulsion, or disgust, or blame. Cas looked at him with eyes wide and blue as the sea and pulled him close, sighing his name.
lives. I just wanted to make sure he’s okay. Please tell him I called. If he doesn’t want to call me, I get it.”
Dean heard a knocking sound on the other end of the line signaling that Rachel had finally arrived. Cas paused to let her in, returning to say his goodbyes.
Dean nodded silently. Getting up to leave he laid the makeshift ice pack on the kitchen counter on his way to the door. That’s when he saw it. He paused.
Even though this is an AU, I think the level of self-hatred and blame Dean experiences is pretty canon. Dean may think he is back at square one, but he isn’t. All of the inner work Dean has done hasn’t left him, but he needs to be reminded. I promise you he will be. Also, for the record M80’s were used in military sims and as a firework banned in the 70’s because of their danger but they're still afloat. They are much louder than cherry bombs and firecrackers and you can feel the blast if close enough. Thank you for reading so far!
“Fuck!” Cas whimpered, his expression losing much of that commanding smugness as Dean’s hand began wrenching pleasure from him with each stroke. Cas sank his forehead into the cradle of Dean’s neck, his eyes shutting tightly as he moaned and kissed blindly, sucking and nipping into the skin of Dean’s neck, his hand on Dean’s dick quickening his strokes in time with Dean’s.
“Come on Cletus you stupid son of a bitch!” Dean laughed, waving on the tall man, whose head was now bleeding.
Cas wondered what that simple flick of lashes meant. Wondered if he’d misread in some way. Was that Dean flirting? Or was Dean so over him, so oblivious to the idea that Cas could still be pathetic enough to be holding on to a love he'd cast away years ago, that he didn't realize the unrest an innocent gesture of friendship would cause.
Waking in this way, coming to his awareness, he suddenly felt anything but safe. He felt a familiar flush on his neck and cheeks. He was in bed, tangled in the arms of his best friend, and Dean had been the one responsible.
When Cas did look up, his lips were pressed tightly together - the blue of his eyes magnified by a gloss of tears. He had no words, responding instead with a silent shrug. Hannah understood, sharing a sad smile, placing her hand on his.
Cas went back to the chair, cradling a pillow between his bent arm and cheek in the hopes of getting some sleep. He only had hours before he needed to get up and go to work himself. He was pretty sure Dean would be okay on his own during Cas’s shift, reasoning he would have been so if he were at his own apartment. He toyed with the idea of calling in sick, but Dean was right, and it was very likely Cas would end up getting whatever Dean had himself and need the time off, despite following most of the protocols they stressed in pre-Med for caring for the sick. This wasn’t just any sick person after all. It was Dean, and he deserved every extra touch and caress as Cas felt for fever, brushed the damp hair from his brow, and soothed him from his troubled dreams.
Cas had stripped down to his underwear and climbed into the bed in the spare room across from their bedroom.
“Take off from work,” Dean said. “Baby’ll be finished by then and I just bought her off of Bobby. I want to take her out for a long drive. Thought I could show her off to you. Besides...you said you’d give me a raincheck for lunch right?”
Cas laughed and walked down to admire Baby then invited him in for a quick break to see his apartment before they headed out for the day.
“You must have a magic touch,” Charlie told him one night as they closed up together. “Usually this level of society are the cheapest bastards around.” Cas laughed, reminding Charlie that this was exactly the kind of club his father once belonged to.
“Stop this!” he uttered out loud, quickly looking around him to see who might have heard, but he was alone. Dean looked up again, a flurry of feelings and realizations again bombarding him. The dream was
They made it almost to Dean’s floor when Dean stopped just shy of the landing. He still held Cas’s hand, but put his other up to him in warning. He was looking at something down the hallway but Cas was behind him and couldn’t see.
“But I wanted to.” Dean cut in. “Didn’t want you thinking I’d skipped out on you,” Dean whispered into the phone. His voice back to normal after a pause he added, “I wouldn’t do that again Cas….Promise.”
“Where would she go? I know you know her and if you lie to me I will find you again,” Dean promised.
Tuition fully paid for and he could start almost right away. It would still cost a fortune for living expenses and it would be hard to work and keep a full-time course load but Cas was determined to manage it. He had been careful with the money from his mother’s estate and had added a little. There was still time to tuck away a few thousand more if he was really careful. In any case, it was one of the best schools in the country, and a better offer than he had gotten locally. He couldn’t wait to tell Rachel and Charlie. Cas felt a pit in his stomach when he thought about Dean. Dean had gone home two days earlier and Cas had heard nothing outside of the quick phone call to let him know Dean got home safe.
Unlike last night, Dean fondly put up with Cas fussing over him when he insisted on getting a thermometer reading or that Dean take meds. Dean really wasn’t well enough to ride home yet so Cas pulled the long cord of the phone from the side table so he could call Bobby himself about being out again tomorrow and was relieved when Bobby told him the shop was slow and they were waiting on a parts order so to just rest up and “let Cas take care of you.”
I have never written anything of length before so believe me when I say that when I started I thought it would be a 20K word max endeavor. Sometimes they (or I) might frustrate you with their shenanigans but just know at least they are taking two steps forward and only one step back on occasion.
“Ha,” Dean chuckled softly to himself at the image of what Benny no doubt meant to represent the unconquered sun. It was beautiful, Dean had never owned anything like it. A note inside read:
Dean looked around at the comfortable living room area where they sat. Between the two chairs where Cas and Dean sat there was a couch and a coffee table, all angled around a floor model tv. Behind the couch the room opened to the kitchenette. A hallway led off to the bedroom. Dean glanced over his shoulder to see a small dining table, big enough for two or maybe four, placed near a large window overlooking the street. There were shards of something, a cup maybe? - on the floor near the table. Other than that the place looked like a well-kept home. Dean noticed there was more furniture than he and Cas had ever owned.
Dean felt a jolt go through Cas as he slowly kissed and licked his way down his perineum, flicking teasingly around the rim of muscle there. Cas moaned, his hips arching to help Dean along as his tongue circled and flicked delicately around the outside of his hole. Dean flicked back and forth with his tongue, fluttering against Cas’s opening, exulting in the murmurs and gasps of pleasure pouring from Cas’s mouth before finally spearing his tongue and pressing inward.
“Don’t be nervous Cas,” Dean said, a shy smile on his own lips. "I'm gonna make it so good for you, my sweetheart." Somehow it only made Cas’s pulse race more. He closed his eyes, fighting through shallow breaths, his heart beating a steady cadence that called
“Naw man, cassette deck. Much smaller. You need to get one. With the right player you can make your own mixtapes and everything. I’ll put one in for you if you like next time I’m up.”
The food momentarily forgotten, Dean felt Cas tugging at the hem of his shirt to pull it free. Dean automatically raised his arms as Cas pulled it off him, tossing it to the side, hands mapping the terrain of Dean’s chest, and back, sending shivers through him, before reaching down and fumbling desperately for the button of Dean’s jeans as he kissed him.
Dreams, long since wished for and abandoned filled its corners - a house with a white picket fence...a dog….
“No please….It's my fault for not being totally honest with you in the first place, and I’m sorry if I made trouble for you and Balthazar….I just….I want you to be happy Cas.” he could say it...he needed to say it, “and I just wanted you to know that I had a really nice time..the best I’ve had
Sam read off a few “Michael’s”, one “Gabriel,” a “G. Novak” but no “Rachel’s” or “R.s” to be found. Dean copied down the numbers.
“Oh Dean come on,” Jess pleaded, getting up and grabbing Dean’s arm before he could answer. “Sing with me!”
“Shhhhh. It’s okay Dean. Just relax.” Cas gentled. He let Dean pull him down ‘til he sat on the edge of the coffee table, his hand stroking through Dean’s hair, smoothing now sweat-soaked strands away from his brow. Dean leaned into his touch.
Alone in the ward lounge, Dean sipped on his now lukewarm coffee wishing it was hot. A few minutes passed and Dean heard a small commotion down one of the halls of the ward. It was the opposite direction from Fred’s room, still, Dean found it unsettling. He wished Garth was still here. Dean didn’t like sitting alone in this place. He was anxious.
Dean was quiet, not liking the question. His eyes skirted Crowley's face. “Fuck you man,” he said, tipping back the glass and draining it.
Cas's eyed Dean sideways, a small grin on his lips, a knowing tilt to his chin, "What, you don't think I can do manual labor?"
He grabbed the pile of bloody clothes from the chair including the pants and shirt that Cas had changed from and brought them to laundry, throwing them in for a wash.
“There’s only one cowboy I wanna see undressed,” he countered, flashing Cas a wink. Dean knew he was being ridiculous. So ridiculous that Cas narrowed his eyes and deadpanned, "I'm sure there's a full-length mirror back there somewhere you can use." Dean snorted, forcing a laugh from Cas. Dean didn't care if he looked like an idiot.
Dean followed silently as Cas hurried out into the street. It was chilly, even though it was summer, the moisture rolling in off the ocean like a cold sweat. Cas crossed his arms to rub away the chill. In the light of the street lamps Dean could see that Cas seemed to be struggling to focus, squinting his eyes, blinking. He was on something, and even though he seemed to be thinking more clearly than he had a few moments ago, whatever it was, was still having an effect. He looked down the street and then in the other direction as if not sure where he was, before finally turning right and walking with purpose.
Dean gave up struggling and settled reluctantly back in the bed. He could do this later when there wasn’t an audience.
Fred looked back at Dean. “If it had been my boy, heading to that beach, I would have wanted someone to stop him. Life’s too precious Dean.” A tear welled in Dean’s eye as he considered it and Fred had the grace to look away so Dean could wipe his eyes in private. Before he left he gave Dean a card with the number for his cab service.
Cas finally looked up at him and nodded curtly, acting before he could argue himself out of it, “Okay then…” he breathed.
Cas had no idea what to say to make it different this time. Part of him knew what was happening was out of his control and that terrified him.
, in those first years after Dean left. He had been so generous, and so attentive, and patient. Cas felt a little bit like he’d owed him something in return. He’d owed it to him to try at least.
Dean watched from the window as Cas got in the waiting taxi. He looked back, spotting Dean, and waved from inside one last time. Dean managed a tight-lipped smile and waved back.
Sam sat up straight immediately. Dean never talked about Cas. Sam and Jess for their part didn't bring Cas up to him. Cas’s absence was a hole in all of their lives but considering Dean disappeared for over a year, running away, Sam figured he should respect his need to not talk about it.
“Don’t you dare come yet Cas!” Dean moaned popping off, heavy-lidded with arousal at the way Cas was coming apart under his touch. He lowered his mouth to cover the head of Cas’s cock once more, swirling his tongue along the frenulum to the tip, giving Cas a pleased little moan at the taste of him.
Dean poured his 3rd shot and was about to sink it when Sam stayed his arm “Seriously Dean, you should get some rest too. You look like hell.”
He knew that Jess loved Sam, but she had mentioned feeling like she deferred to his decisions too much and was losing something of herself in the process.
“The two drag queens sitting at the table next to ours, the bouncer, and don’t forget the meter maid writing parking violations on our way out of the club,” Charlie chimed in. She lowered her voice to a whisper, “Much as I think you two would be sweet together, poor Alfie never had a chance,” she confided.
“I mean it.” Dean hesitated, “I didn’t realize it at the time and I was a dick to you, but I understand now what you did for me that day at the park.”
“Dean let’s go!” he said before placing a hand on Dean’s chest to break the connection, if only to grab his hand and lead him off the floor.
Cas’s eyebrows shot up as Dean handed him a small stuffed bear. It wore a tiny yellow hat shaped like the cap of a honey bottle.  A sweater that pictured a hive read “Let me Bee your Honeybear!”
Crowley glanced over to the men still drinking by the pool table. They were getting drunker and louder. Dean, in his stupor, was vaguely aware of them, sounds and words and vibrations only.
Sam probed Dean with that worried, sympathetic look that always annoyed the shit out of him when it was directed his way, but to his credit he let it rest for the moment.
“One more thing,” Balthazar said. He told him about Meg. How Meg crashed from place to place but had a shady dealer named Marv and where he was likely to be.
Throwing in an extra update this week. Here we see the events of the last chapter through Dean's eyes.
It was too late now to start the fall semester and possibly too late to find a good school placement by January but Cas worked diligently filling out applications and writing letters to all of the higher caliber medical schools nonetheless.
Dean’s mouth curved into a delirious grin, “You looked meow-gical tonight.” He burst into a laughter that shook his head and chest, erupting into a coughing fit.
“If I ever meet up with that son of a bitch he will be begging you on his knees for forgiveness.” Dean’s mouth formed a firm line, his jaw tight.
“Say it, Dean.” Cas cut in, knowing that Dean was rambling out of fear. “Whatever it is you can say it.”
Dean grabbed a napkin and wrote down the number to the apartment over the San Francisco shop and Sam’s number.
Cas stopped talking, a soft sweet moan on his lips as Dean’s thumb found the head of his cock through the fabric of his jeans and circled it over and over.
“Right,” Dean nodded more to himself. Looking back at her he added, “Okay, thank you,” and made his way back to the lot.
He placed the letter on the table. The familiar ache flooded him. No, Cas thought. This was sharper. The tearing finality of
Dean let the smile drop from his face. “Don’t you worry about Mildred though Fred. Or about anything for that matter. Garth and I are gonna make sure she’s all set this weekend for you to come home to, and after you get some rest we’ll all have a late Thanksgiving together. The only condition is that you and Mildred don’t lift a finger.”
Ash used to talk about all kinds of crazy theories. He’d talk about everything really. Half of what he said Dean didn’t understand, but he understood enough to be certain that the world would have been better served with Ash in a research lab or university than in a jungle ducking bullets for his twentieth birthday. Once, he said something about time folding in on itself, like paper, that if such a thing were possible then a hole could be punched from one time to the next. At the time it made Dean think about watching the Twilight Zone with Cas back home, the one with the woman on horseback, trying to warn her younger self not to make the biggest mistake of her life, one that would end in tragedy and despair. She yelled...but always unheard, and always too late. The drugs must be taking their effect, he reasoned before the next wave of disorientation crashed, because in the growing twilight Dean looked out now and saw ghosts of his own. His younger self, barely steps away, holding the camera, looking out at his sweet Cas down along the surf. What would Dean scream if he could punch a hole through time and make them hear him?
poet had written in a way that stood out to him - made him turn down the corner of the page, like she understood the dirty secret Cas was still trying so hard to hide. If Balthazar had known the effect the words would have on him, he would have regretted giving Cas the book. Opening the closet, Cas could hear the familiar verses in his mind - his hands shaking as he reached to find what he was looking for.
and more than that, Dean was almost certain he saw it mirrored in Cas too. He wanted to take Cas home, lift him up and carry him to his bed. Then Dean would kiss him until all the sadness was gone and all that was left for them both was
This surprised Dean. He thought for sure Balthazar was the kind of guy who would be wining and dining Cas at nightclubs any chance he got.
“I could teach you!” he blurted, feeling stupid as soon as he said it. It’s not like they lived near each other. It wasn’t like they would start hanging out. The last thing Cas needed was Dean hovering eagerly, looking for reasons to distract and disrupt his life. But Dean’s breath caught in his throat and he felt a flush on his cheeks when Cas chuckled telling him, “I think I would rather just come and watch you somewhere.”
He found himself suddenly nervous that maybe Cas wouldn’t show, when a taxi pulled up in front and out climbed Cas. Dean took another drag and then stubbed the cigarette in the ashtray. Cas came in, looked around for a second, then spotted Dean who stood to wave him over.
Cas wished Dean wasn’t so stubbornly cynical. There was no use trying to talk to him when he was like this.
Now, as Dean played the notes to Simple Man, Sam could see a tightness in his jaw that was usually lost when he played. Dean was troubled.
Dean’s voice broke as he continued. “I still….well Jesus you saw how I still have those episodes sometimes, where I lose it. Cas, I just don’t want to be that person around you.”
“What time is it?” Cas asked. He looked again to the man on the loveseat still sleeping, a panic falling over him.
“Thanks Cas.” Dean smiled, settling down against the pillow and pulling the sheet up over his shoulders.
This version of CCR’s  - Have You Ever Seen the Rain from The Voice has such a gentle perfect blending of voices. This is how I imagine nJess and Dean sounding on stage, except Dean’s voice a bit deeper. I can just imagine him nervous at first, but then singing his heart out that one verse for Cas by the end.
“So I guess this is goodbye then..” Cas said, his voice barely steady enough to choke out the words.
Cas eyed him like he had lost his mind, “You literally just said you have to get back to your baby.”
Later Cas, beer in hand, grilled burgers and hotdogs on the deck as the children chased the last fireflies of summer. A warm September evening that would, in just hours, give way to a mild October, the smell of citronella candles wafting through the air. Hannah and Rachel chatted comfortably as the kids raced through the yard. The sun had just set, sending the world into a soft blue glow as the first stars appeared. It was a magic hour….“the gloaming” his mother used to call it. As it got darker, Hannah lit some lanterns around the deck and brought out sparklers for the kids left over from the Fourth of July. They played cards and talked and drank and enjoyed each other’s company late into the night.
Dean bit back the thoughts that came rushing at him suddenly like water bursting from a dam. It was so stupid, Dean thought -impossible to ever give voice to - to hope that Cas could ever be so stupid as to forgive him - to believe in him again after all he'd promised and all he'd failed to deliver. If it were someone else who had done this to Cas, Dean would....
“Oh....sorry I woke you Cas!” Dean said in a choked whisper, looking away and wiping his eyes so Cas wouldn’t see.
Cas could see the subtle shudders in Dean’s body and stepped across the divide, reaching to place a hand on Dean’s shoulder. “Dean,.....Dean are you okay?”
Cas sat down on the end of the couch closest to Dean, their knees almost touching. “You should eat something.” He nodded at the banana.
It was dark and Dean was standing in the garden, the tall figures of the Weeping Maidens towering overhead, but instead of hiding their heads in grief they looked down on him. A colonnade of bereft faces above him and a voice behind him.
Cheers. Applause as he finished the last verse. Dean’s senses were overflowing but for the first time in a long time in the best possible way. His adrenaline was surging for all the right reasons. He found himself remembering the way a race use to make him feel like he was flying a mile off the ground. The way it felt making love to Cas in the summer rain.
Dean sighed, and Cas was certain he saw through his bullshit but made an attempt to explain anyway. Cas for his part made an attempt to look like it all made sense to him now. Like some great fucking enigma had finally been unraveled in his mind now that mysteries of 'torque' had been settled.
“Okay then, come with me!” Cas led Dean a few streets over to pick up a car that would take them from Union Square to Fisherman’s Wharf. The car was pretty full with tourists but they managed to squish together on a wooden bench facing the street. Cas told him a little of what he had learned about the famous cable cars.
‘You’re right…” Dean shrugged, taking a step towards Cas, his brow furrowed. “I probably shouldn’t have come. But I did, and I’m sorry. But since I’m here can I please talk to you?.. I couldn’t call...I couldn’t just call you after -
Cas was shy where Dean was bold, Cas was compassionate where Dean was rough, Cas smoothed out Dean's edges and Dean fortified Cas. Cas was all of those things that Dean wanted to be but was afraid to be...except with Cas. Together, they made a whole. Like a star pulling everything into its orbit, Dean couldn’t escape Cas’s gravity, and he wanted to be pulled closer, deeper, until he was consumed, taken in...until everything was Cas.
Dean’s eyes relentlessly held him, diving deep inside him, reaching beyond skin and blood and bone. Cas’s body couldn’t help but be stirred by it.
Dean finally relaxed into the warm feeling in his body and the rush in his head that he knew wasn’t the whiskey. As his eyes met Cas’s his whole body thrummed. Dean laughed taking in Cas’s smile, pulling him close against his body as the music changed again and Thelma Houston sang -
He felt a retching in his gut...and inside of him his pleas were as useless and insubstantial as ash scattered in the wind.
Cas made an effort to loosen up - to act like it was all fine. Truth is he didn’t really know anything more than what Sam had told him. Sam called last night to let him know that Dean had tried to reach him earlier but was on the road now. Cas hadn’t been home. He was working a late shift at the restaurant. Sam said Dean asked him to call because he wasn’t sure when he'd be able to get to a phone and wanted him to know right away that he couldn’t come to Thanksgiving dinner at Rachel’s. Apparently, Dean’s friend Fred was sick. He was headed to Oregon to see him. Cas had thanked Sam and wished him, Jessica, and Bobby a Happy Thanksgiving before hanging up.
“No! NO!” Dean screamed as he jerked out of bed, awake. Disoriented. A nurse tried to settle him but he jumped from the bed pulling the wires and tubes from his arms…”Where is he??! Cas??!” he choked out, his throat raw.
Cas had heard him, and that was the very thing that had stolen his voice - temporarily short-circuited his thoughts. Cas
Dean gabbed tight to Cas’s arm as he leaned in pulling the angel closer, closing his eyes and resting his forehead on Cas’s.
,” she had said….He felt the color drain from his face as he turned slowly to look at her.….staring for a moment, eyes narrowed at Mildred, who somehow
you then Cassie? Do you even know? You deserve more than a ‘wham- bam thank-you-Cas.’ Seems he’s always finding reasons to let you down.”
“Yeah okay.” Dean punched his arm, then pulled him into a hug. “Better set a date quick before she wisens up.”
Cas shrugged. Exhaling, he closed his eyes before looking up at her. He knew she was right, but his life lately had this ‘urgent’ feel to it ever since....well,
Dean was panting now writhing into Cas’s hand as Cas shifted his hips to rub his own cock harder against Dean’s thigh and fingers, gripping Dean and pulling him down until they were both prone along the seat, breathless and desperate for each other.
“Hang on!” Dean said, holding up his hand to stay him. He unlocked and rolled up the garage door at the front of the shop, disappearing inside. Cas heard the familiar rev of a motorcycle engine starting up. And Dean pulled out front, getting off long enough to pull down the door and lock it again.
Dean had asked to see him….and Cas wanted so desperately to see Dean - and they would be together again soon….and that was all that mattered to him in this moment.
Bobby crossed the office to the door where Dean stood, clapping him on the back to pull him along “Well come on then.”
“They have a Castiel Novak….They said he’s resting. They can’t give any more information out over the phone due to patient confidentiality.” Sam said.
Cas reached his arms around Dean and held him close, his head resting in the hollow of Dean’s neck, before kissing him once more goodbye.
Dean knew somehow back in that moment on the beach with Cas, that this was life at its most precious, this was love at its most tender, that this feeling, so pure, couldn’t be captured and held. The day had been bittersweet.
Dean found a marked trail and led Cas onto it, walking along it for about ten minutes before veering off on what looked like nothing more than a deerpath.
With a sigh Cas’s arms softened around him, his fingers loosening and splaying over his own shoulders as if holding Dean again. In his mind’s eye he saw him, that wolfish grin settling into an adoring smile. Eyes still closed, Cas swayed ever so slightly…. imagining...remembering.... the feel of holding Dean close as Elvis sang.
Dean laughed…”Yeah...I hear you, but that's a big step man...that's really great. I’m excited for you.”
Dean wanted to tell him it was anything but weird but settled instead for “Hey, it wasn’t you...I think anytime people have…” Dean struggled.
He left his bedroom now and padded over to the percolator in the kitchen area to brew some coffee for himself.
“It’s not stupid - but you’re selling yourself short. Dammit! Always on the boob!” She grabbed a napkin to dab sauce from where it dripped on her faded ‘Lavender Menace'  t-shirt.
“Pack a bag and stay there for the week would ya? I need somebody to take charge of the shop. Billy’s out with pneumonia and I’d do it myself but I got some auction deals coming in here this week I gotta sign for.”
Cas let out a small relieved laugh. He had thought before, long before he had given himself to The Empty, that maybe Dean would be able to love him the way he loved Dean, if he came to him in the form of a woman. But Castiel knew that wouldn’t be right either. That wasn’t who he truly was. Angels might not have human bodies but they each had an essence. A sense that caused them to greet each member of their huge dysfunctional family as “Brother” or “Sister.” Castiel’s vessel was suited to him. In fact, now that Jimmy Novak was in heaven this separate vessel had been specially made for him, it was in fact part of him and he was part of it. He wanted to love Dean as he knew him, as he had come to know him, and he hoped that that would be enough for Dean. Hearing Dean now say it....seeing Dean look back at him with a look of love and acceptance, was more than he ever thought possible.
“Wait!” As they passed a small alley between buildings, Dean pulled Cas over to a shadowed space near the wall.
He walked away, climbing into the car with Benny and rubbed his forehead with his palm to brush away the fatigue. As Benny drove away Dean leaned his head against the window.
“So what’s new with you and Jess?” Dean ventured to try to break the pensive quiet. He was terrible at small talk. He pretty much saw Sam and Jess enough that the question seemed ridiculous to him as it left his mouth but he was grasping at anything at this point.
“Mmm, just as well.” Cas said, “Feed a cold, starve a fever….still, you should try to get something in you today. I’ll stop by during my lunch and bring you something.”
Cas was sure that Dean must not love him anymore. He had come to terms with that, even if Cas knew he would never stop loving Dean. He just had to try to make room for someone else in his heart as well. Balthazar had saved him from that empty apartment - that
It had always been easier for Cas to push away Dean’s declarations than to accept them. Maybe he was afraid if he fully believed them it would just be harder when Dean wisened up and realized Cas wasn’t anything special. Dean rolled his eyes and dropped on the couch next to him. His calloused hand cupped Cas’s cheek roughly, pulling him up to meet his eyes. Dean’s thumb brushed back and forth over his lips as if to shush him, his voice lowering a register.
“Yeah well, then he can consider it payback for all the times he’s creeped me out.” Sam looked like he was about to say more but Dean cut him off “I gotta shower Sammy and you’re right - we both need rest. “I’ll see you in the morning. Don’t worry about Cas - I’ll check in on him,” and with that, he left.
“Call him a fucking cab then,” the man now on Dean’s left, the one in the red baseball cap, complained coming closer. "Else let 'im sit there till he sobers up."
“The neighbor across the street has a hive in his backyard. He let us - me and Hannah and the kids I mean, he let us watch him from a distance all suited up. Brought us over fresh honey later. It was pretty neat.”
After taking care of business in town he came back to Fred and Mildred’s house and tried to reach Cas a few more times. Dean perked up when he finally got a busy signal. He hung up and called again immediately three times in a row, getting the busy signal each time.
Dean knew that question came out with an anger he didn’t actually feel. He didn’t know any other way to push Cas away...free of him. Cas didn’t deserve to have to deal with his damage. Even as he said it,  it stabbed at him to know he was hurting Cas, again.
Dean felt his cock stir at the husky sound of it. Something about their earlier conversation made Dean eager to obey. He let himself be led back down the little staircase.
Dean swallowed, wondering just how much Cas had confided, and what kind of picture he’d painted of Dean. Looking worriedly back at the street, he spotted Cas and the children again, now little ants in the distance.
The waitress brought Cas another drink but Dean waved his away and asked for a cola instead. Turned out the joy on Cas’s face was all the inspiration he would need tonight, and besides he would have to drive them home later. She gave them a minute to look over a small menu before returning to take their orders. The choices were limited to appetizer-like snacks as the club focused mainly on drinks so they ordered a strange array of meatballs, onion rings, and shrimp cocktail along with mini chicken croquettes.
Cas heard the smile again in Dean’s voice and couldn’t help but agree. He asked Dean about his guitar.
Cas shook his head and took a breath, trying to clear his head. He carried the platter in to join the others as the doorbell rang.
Dean stared blankly. His breathing settled as he started to put two and two together. He was in a hospital. How?
Dean stared, his heart singing at Cas’s words. He was momentarily speechless and Cas’s eyes widened.
“I don’t know - they went into the house. I imagine it didn’t end well for the poor bees.” Cas added suddenly looking sad.
Dean woke up on his own couch Sunday morning with a hangover he hadn’t earned. The pounding headache was purely from stress and poor sleep and the malaise from sadness. Sam was a wreck the night before, and after hours of coming clean about what was really going on for the past few months in their deceptively happy home, Dean walked Sam into his bedroom, and made him get some sleep, taking the couch for himself.
“Rachel, it was nice to meet you. Take care of your big brother,” he teased, eyes flicking from Rachel to Cas.
Dean knew when Garth got back they would find a doctor to try to get an update on Fred’s condition. He tried to push thoughts of it from his mind until then as best he could, knowing it was futile to speculate on anything. Instead, he let other worries flood his brain. Ones that didn’t involve death, ones that maybe he could manage better.
Balthazar walked past, moving to the bedroom where he began hastily throwing things into a duffle bag. Cas followed him.
Dean raised himself to his knees, pulling his jeans and underwear down as far as he could before rolling to his side to kick them off the rest of the way. He laid for a moment on his side, pulling Cas against him  just to enjoy the feel of their naked bodies, skin against skin, their chests and hips pressed together as Dean put his arm around Cas’s back and lightly stroked from the space between his shoulders, down his spine to the small of his back, and lower, teasing his fingers lightly along the crack of his ass and back up again. He caressed Cas like something delicate, like a love letter, extraordinary and ancient, whose pages might crumble at too course a touch, even though they both knew Cas could take his cock railing the length of him savagely - Dean wanted Cas to feel how precious and gentle his love could be.
Dean glanced at Jess who subtly raised her palms in a ‘don’t-look-at-me’ gesture, her eyes darting sideways to Cas who was suddenly staring intently at the old cars on the side of the salvage yard, lips pressed into a tight line. Was that a flush on his cheeks? It was probably just Dean’s hopes getting the better of him but suddenly it was like a thousand bees were buzzing inside his chest. Cas had left Balthazar and had come to see
“Tonight, when you grabbed my arm in there, you pulled your hand away and it was the first time we touched since the war that there was no blood. No blood anywhere. Thank you Cas.” Dean looked up and met Cas’s eyes.
“Shit,” Cas murmured as Dean stopped the bike in front of his house and he got off to see Balthazar sitting on the steps of the Brownstone.
Cas rolled up the window and stepped out of the car, locking it. Dean stepped smiling into his space as he turned.
Dean replayed the memory of his father beating him in Darlene’s apartment, only this time he was there, on the side, watching as a grown adult. He pictured himself as a man catching John’s fist just as it was about to strike the boy, about to strike Dean. He’d teach John Winchester never to hurt that boy again, if he could. He had to admit the vision was satisfying. It soothed something inside of him.
“Trick or Treat!” a chorus of what looked to be elementary-aged children sang as they converged on Dean and Hannah. Dean grabbed some candy and doled it out to each of them. Two of the kids had costumes that looked like they were painstakingly made by a loving parent or grandparent. The other 3 sported plastic masks tied on with rubber bands and vinyl smocks with cartoons and superheroes printed on them, a Bugs Bunny, a  Casper, and Wonder Woman. Dean hoped Hannah wouldn’t mind as he slipped an extra candy into the vinyl costumed kid’s bags, He figured they could probably use it.
Dean’s eyes went wide. “Dude I am so freaking turned on right now!” he told Cas as in the background Robert Plant belted out “You need Cooooolin! Baby I’m not Foooolin!.......”
Dean continued, “Because I never told you, and I’m sorry...I’m so, so sorry….See what I’m doing now?” Dean took Cas’s hand in both of his now. As Cas looked down Dean traced his fingers gently across the back of his hand.
Cas’s expression was soft, wistful as he looked back at Dean. “It's just...you barely know me. You’re gonna change your mind one day when you realize I’m nobody special.”
Cas swallowed. He’d been fighting to keep his own eyes from filling and felt the sharp strain of fatigue in them. He slowly opened them and looked to Dean who at some point had sat up. He looked across to Cas, his eyes soft and open, like green embers yearning to catch fire.
Cas cocked his head, a little furrow emerging between his eyes. “Dean, grey bandana, left back pocket, mean’s he’s looking for a sub.”
on another. They stuffed their faces with pizza, too much popcorn, and now Hannah was scooping out the last of a half-gallon of ice cream they’d split into their bowls. Cas topped his with caramel sauce and Reddi Whip. Hannah popped her legs up on her coffee table to stretch out, propping her own bowl on her lap and leaning her back against Cas's side as they continued to gorge themselves and watch.
Hanging up the phone, he headed to the bathroom to splash water on his face and brush his teeth. Checking the medicine cabinet he found shaving cream and a pack of razors and quickly shaved the stubble off his face adding a splash of aftershave. What should he wear? Cas hadn’t said and Dean realized it didn’t really matter as he rifled through his duffle bag since all he had hastily packed were jeans, a few t-shirts and a grey and white flannel. He hoped Cas wouldn’t think he looked like a lumberjack.
To top it off Jess had been talking about going back to school to get a degree in education, but Sam kept talking about getting married and starting a family, and how she didn’t need to worry about having a career.
In the process of cleaning his mess from the night before he nearly vomited twice more, barely stopping himself by walking away and steeling himself to continue.
Cas put a hand on his shoulder. “I’m right here Dean. You’re okay.” Cas gave Dean’s shoulder a comforting squeeze. “You’re safe Dean. I’ve got you.”
Suddenly his breath caught and Cas swallowed against the familiar lump in his throat. He opened his eyes, willing them not to water as he shook off the memory. The needle made a tortured
“Run!” he mouthed silently as he imagined them there. Tears streamed from his eyes freely now and he found himself whispering, because it's all he had left, “Take him and run...” He would tell them to find that island - run to Canada, anywhere the war couldn’t reach them. Build Cas a house, with a  picket fence, he thought...but Dean had been too proud not to fight. His mind was swimming, voiding, folding in on itself. He felt like his head was being spun on one of those carnival rides that glue you to the wall with centrifugal force. He was too weak to sit up anymore. His gut wrenched and consciousness faded in and out. He felt sand on his face… grains in his mouth….another wave crashed in on his mind and it was gone. It was suddenly hard to breathe but Dean couldn’t remember why. Another pain like being ripped open contorted his body and he cried out. His eyes opened, he tried to push up with his hands..his mind searched to grab onto something as everything slipped away with the incoming tide.
“Bloody hell I know that look,” Crowley said, drying a glass with a clean towel. “That’s not a ‘beer’ look.”
He didn’t need to be cajoled like an errant child. It was bad enough he felt like one. He didn’t want to think about Dean judging him, calling him a ‘junkie.’ It wasn’t like that - still, he was angry, upset, and more than a little humiliated about how the night had played out. He had lost control in every way imaginable. Had hit Dean.
As they reached Baby, Cas stopped, turning to Dean with a look of realization on his face. “‘We’ll need a safe word."
“I was going to say ‘tiring,’ - but yeah, I can see how it might be lonely.” Cas threw Dean a sad smile, eyeing him affectionately. He reached up to swipe a dot of ketchup from the edge of Dean’s lips with his thumb, bringing it to his mouth and licking it off.
Did people do this? It was odd, but Cas couldn’t help but break a smile as he settled back into the cushions of the couch. Somehow Dean hadn’t made it seem awkward. Just an ordinary thing friends would do. Maybe.
