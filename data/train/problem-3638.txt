Finally, everyone stood as the judge left, then people began filing out. Dean let go of Cas and started walking out.
"YOU SHOULD HAVE NEVER ALLOWED THIS TO HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE."
Cas glanced at Chalie. She shrugged, "seems legit."
It was a word problem. Sam knew how to get an equation from it, but he wanted Dean to help.
"Divide 365 by 5?"
Charlie stood up, "We're human and so is your brother. We removed the mark."
"Stay safe out there Catherine, if you ever feel like a creep is following you, you call me got it. I'll be right there."
. Damn those green eyes. Dean. The photo caption said his name was Dean. He was a mechanic at Bobby Singer's auto shop. This was Sam Winchester's brother. Cas decided to go to the shop the next morning.
"Yes, and you are?"
Sam looked up and greeted him, "Hi Dean. So uh, this is my girlfriend, Eileen Leahy. Eileen this is Dean."
by Bon Jovi. Cas steals a glance over at Dean, who is now humming along to the song. When the chorus begins, Cas starts singing softly. Dean looked at Cas making him blush, but he didn't stop singing. Dean joined in and they got louder and more into it.
"Dean, why didn't you tell me?"
They drive home in a comfortable silence. The only sound was Dean telling Cas when to turn. They pulled up to the curb and Dean hopped out. Cas rolled down the window and Dean turned back.
"Then what happened?"
"Are you Cas Novak?" Benny asked.
He wasn't supposed to be here was he?
"Because of me? Cas, what-"
"Only if you're honest with me," he put his hands on Dean's shoulders, "You getting inta drugs again?"
Crowley licked his lips. He loved seeing Dean all desperate.
"Whatever you say Cas."
Sam just nodded. It was silent for a moment while Cas tried to figure out what to say.
Dean shrugged, "don't wanna move."
"Why not? You went to a bar."
Cas asked himself. He didn't have time to answer because Sam started talking.
"That's good, real good Cas. I'm proud of you. You're making sure you're not gonna relapse."
"Shut up," Crowley said through clenched teeth.
"Not guilty."
Even Sam was surprised. Dean threw his head back in laughter. It was a great to laugh after everything that's happened this week.
"Sam believes you and I'm sure if you told me what happened I'd believe you."
"Yeah I-"
Dean paused, "he saw you get in my car, I guess."
"Well, we have a hand of God."
Dean laughed, "Well did you win? What am I talking about I bet she kicked your ass."
Cas nodded. One of the lawyers, Gina Sheppard, cleared her throat.
"No?" Dean put his hands on his hips, "well that makes me sad. I suppose you don't know where the First Blade is then."
"No, I hadn't drank anything yet."
"How is that possible? He- he was sober. He was happy. I- what-"
"Do you want me to come in with you? Or should I wait in the car?"
"Huh, I'm a legacy too. Did the prophet say anything?"
"No, yeah. That's good, good. You sure you're getting enough sleep though?"
"You disgust me, Dean Winchester."
There are no triggering topics in this chapter. I will update tags and put warnings when triggering topics come up.
"Yeah that sounds good, just don't expect me to shower."
Cas immediately pulled over and took Dean's hand, "talk to me, Dean."
"I've actually been good, well bad, but good in the sober way," the man next to Dean said.
"That's nice."
The file details the process and requirements for the cure. Dean's treatment was finished but apparently, it didn't work. Not completely.
. That's when Dean became a demon. His brother Sam tracked him down and brought him back to the bunker. He wanted to cure him.
Cas put his blade away and kneeled down next to Dean, "good to have you back."
. Dean walked faster. It's colder than he thought it would be. Probably because it was so early. He flipped his collar up and shoved his hands in his pockets. He shuddered as Alistair's face flashes in front of him again. His dad started screaming in his head. STOP BITCHIN ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS BOY. His throat felt tight. Alistair's cheek laughter, "Dean, Dean, Dean. I told you you'd always be mine."
He could no longer sit up. He leaned forward until his forehead was against the ground.
"You won't be able to do anything in this state. Now get out "
"You don't?"
Benny pondered Cas's question for a moment before answering, "He deserves to know the truth behind your actions. You'll get to talk to him one way or another."
"I- I don't-" John put his hand on Dean's shoulder.
"I saved your life, Dean, and you left me. How do you think that made me feel?"
"Can't you ask your brother for help?"
"YOU'RE SELFISH YOU WANT YOUR FAMILY TO STARVE."
Dean shook his head, "I don't want to talk about it."
"Don't worry. Many people ask. I have an interpreter that comes to every class."
Dean just stared at Lucifer. He was having trouble processing everything and staying in the moment. This time he saw Lucifer's lips moving but he didn't hear any words come out.
"No thank you my car's fine. I just wanted to talk to him."
Dean took a few deep breaths with their help. Then spoke again, "the things I said, the things I did to my brother..."
"The jury gets protection, but if witnesses get protection I'd have to throw my life away," Dean wasn't really talking to Cas, but Cas was still listening and trying to comfort Dean.
"Come on in."
"Yeah, it has apples in it."
"Today's his day off, but I can take a look at your car for you."
"Zip it. If it were anyone else I would've fired them."
"Yeah, they do Dean."
"I'm not."
but I had stopped feeling bad. It was a murky grey for a while, for a long time, but I stopped drinking. Slowly, things got good and it will for you too."
Oops thought I posted. Enjoy!
. but he pushed that thought from his head. He was already there.
Dean scratched the back of his neck, "Hey, well thanks man, but uh, I'm actually here with someone tonight."
(See the end of the chapter for
"What?" Dean looked at Cas.
"Yeah real funny. Don't let it happen again."
It was an innocent mistake, he'd simply misspoken. He didn't know why Dean would be embarrassed to the point of drinking. Unless...
tw: mentions of past r/pe, panic attacks, disasociation
Sam laughed, "Only because you were dodging the subject ok?"
"I'm sorry Sam, I'm sorry." It was a flashback.
"Yeah but it's not actually a big deal. I smoked a couple of cigarettes, but it was just one day and it was only cigs so I'm back on the sobriety bandwagon."
Dean smiled, "naw she got me good, I'm just better at hiding my wounds."
"A hand of God? Didn't the prophet say-"
Cas took his necklace off and put it into the spell bowl.
"Does Dean know? I mean was he surprised when you told him Cas was drunk?"
He'd been there too long. He grabbed a large handle off the shelf. He didn't bother reading the label he was too... excited? No that's not the right word. He was too guilty to be excited. He was just ready to drink. He needed to drink.
"You can't!" hot tears hit the cold wood floor.
Along the way, a couple of people nudged him with their feet or tapped him on the shoulder. He didn't react to them. They saw he was alive so they soon moved on. One persistent set of hands started pushing him. He got rolled over to his back. He didn't mind. Well, the rocks started digging into his back. He felt a sharp pain in his shoulder, but that didn't matter. He didn't even care enough to open his eyes. He felt his shoulder hit something hard. He was against the wall of the club. The hands left and he was alone again.
"No, I finished and then saw this on the news and ran over here."
"But you seemed so excited before! You're going into high school now Dean, you're so smart and old."
"We want to take your statement of what happened," she sat down across from him.
"So you have a girlfriend?" Benny asked.
"Then how'd he find out who you were?"
"Why not?"
"Well that's complicated and A long story, but will you untie me? I've proved I'm human."
"Wow, that's so cool."
"Sharing your super personal problems to all those people is impossible. You either lie or I don't know, really trust people."
"Fine, I mean, I've only seen him once or twice. Last time I was waiting outside Haden's office for you and he thought I was homeless or something. He yelled at me and I cursed at him and left."
Dean pulled the rubberband between his hands before sliding it on his wrist. "Let's go in."
Sam paused and spoke softly, "Dean."
"You thought I couldn't go out and have fun because I'm sober."
"Dean? What are you doing here?" she asked giving him a hug.
"Yeah?"
"Ok guys. I think," Dean sighs, "I think you two should go in first, just to explain. Then I'll come in after."
Dean looked at Cas in surprise. He spoke softly, "you'd do that for me?"
"See, everything works out in the end." Cas pulled back onto the road.
His dad was quiet for a moment. Still processing.
"I know," Sam smiled at Eileen, "and I won't."
"Did anything else happen?"
"You keepin your nose clean?" Dean asked after a sip.
"What's your name?" he asked.
"Anytime you need me," Cas said looking over, "I'll be there for you."
They showed their IDs to the bouncer, which Dean was confused about. Cas said that even though there were no drinks, it was still a club, so only people 21+ allowed. When they stepped inside, Dean stood still. He could not believe what he was seeing. There was a ton of people there and they were all having fun. Almost everyone was on the dance floor. Although there were a few that were off to the side at tables.
"I told you it was my day off Bobby," Dean said continuing to tighten something under the car.
Cas was doing exactly what Dean needed. Squeezing his hand made him feel more connected. Reminded him he was physically in the courtroom. This courtroom, for Catherine's case against Carl. He didn't know how much time was passing, he just kept his eyes closed and focused on his breathing. In 1 out 2 in 3 out 4 in 5 out 6 in 7 out 8 in 9 out 10 in 1 out 2 in 3 out 4 in 5
"Look, Dean. I know it's hard ok, and it's going to keep being hard. So please just go, at least until the court case is over."
"Did you. become a lawyer. because of me?"
"Not like that... Just talking about it, in general, is hard."
"ID?" The cashier asked.
The impala was parked badly right upfront. Sam opened the back seat door. Dean crawled in and sprawled out across the seats. Benny drove home and parked in the driveway.
Benny smiled as he reminisced.
"He's not in trouble, is he?"
Dean looked at his brother confused.
They maintained eye contact as Crowley rubbed his thumb against Dean's chin.
Losing Dean like that.
"He what? Have you tried talking to him?"
Dean pursed his lips, "well Professor Haden can't help you, and staring at the problem for another 10 minutes won't magically make you understand so why not let me take a crack at it?"
Cas rolled his eyes. He couldn't stop himself. Maybe that was inappropriate.
The next room they enter looks like all the other storage rooms. Cas is about to move on when Charlie stops him.
Dean took a step back, "I spent it already."
Dean took a couple of puffs of his cigarette before answering, "just... brings back memories."
"SPIT IT OUT BOY"
His father leaned in closer to Dean, staring him right in the eyes, "I just want to make sure we're all on the same page. I want us to stay a family. You wouldn't want them to take poor little Sammy away, would you?"
"Do you want to date?" it sounds so childish but he is too giddy to care.
"Why?"
"What happened? Why so desperate?" Crowley slowly walked in a circle around him. He closed his eyes.
"Dean please I-"
"I told Catherine to run and call 911. And she did. She got away," Dean took a deep breath, "and then me and Carl started to fight. He got me in the nose and I couldn't see."
"Aux up," Cas started the car, "one of my students taught me that phrase."
"So just how crazy are you that you want to date my brother?" Dean asks smiling.
"Stop! I don't wanna hear it ok? So leave, now." Dean laid back on the creeper seat and scooted himself under the car. Cutting off the conversation for good.
Yes, I'm a bitch with this cliffhanger but I've actually planned out the story a bit now. Sorry for any spelling/grammar mistakes I literally wrote this in a day. You guys have been too kind to me and you've inspired me to write this much. I do have school so I probably won't update until next weekend. But you guys really are the best, I love you all. Thanks for reading, commenting, and leaving kudos!
"Yeah, well I can blast through the door, but I'm not leaving without my blade. So if you find it... we can make a deal."
I know what you're gonna say, Dean and Cas just need t get together already.... but that's no fun >:)
"I know! I mean, I know you'd never hate me or whatever, but it still feels like a big thing to tell you. So that's why I never did."
"He's got a big math test that day. He's just getting his grade back up, he can't miss it. If I told him he'd either make sure he was right there with me, or he would be too distracted to do well. I can't let him worry about me, not at the expense of his education."
Dean clenched his teeth.
"I'll wait here," Dean says a couple of yards away from the door, "you guys go knock."
"Wait, wait!" Dean pulled away and his tears stopped falling, "is it really 2038?"
"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?"
"No, but I can stop the blaring sound and the flashing lights. The door will stay closed. Get to work."
attention seeker
Cas jammed his finger into Dean's chest, "
"Yeah, yeah. You into cars?"
"Come on can't be that bad," Dean smiled as he dried his hands.
Dean tried to respond to that for a moment, but then he just ignored it.
Dean looked Cas in the eyes and saw genuine concern. He willed his body to relax, "no we just got here. Let's go dance!"
The girl who called him a genius spoke for the group, "so Dean, where do you work?"
"What- no- I'm not a demon- who are you?"
"Are you sure?" Charlie asked.
"That's it. Breathe."
"Yeah he could, but he wouldn't and I don't want him to." He walked past Sam but he just started walking next to him.
"No, Dean," he took a deep breath, "Andrea's dead."
"No Dean, stop! I mean yes I went to her apartment but it wasn't like that! We-" Sam looked down and mumbled, "we were playing Mario Kart."
They sang all the way to their destination.
"What the hell is going on here?" Charlie asks once things are calm.
"Cas, man, I can't thank you enough," Dean opened his arms and hugged Cas.
"Alright, we're outside, what?"
Cas sighed, "I don't know, but I think the demon is trapped in that room."
Dean leaned back on the table, "Barely made it through high school, man."
"Yeah, now she won't talk to me and she glares at me a lot."
"Charlie gave it to me."
"So then what she do?" Dean asked.
Dean caught himself on his hands. His elbows began shaking, "wha-what? You're not-"
. He heard all of the AA leaders say. Well, fuck them. If he drank until he blacked out at least he wouldn't have to think about him. Dean. His Dean. Not his. Not anymore. Dean's name was the only thing on his mind last night and he loved it. Now he- he couldn't even think about that. He placed the handle on the counter.
"Cas I don't want to- I don't want to talk about it- I've never talked about it- not even with Sam."
"Well let's see."
Why not? What else did he need to do today? Nothing.
When he was a couple of feet away, professor Haden's door opened. Out stepped an extremely frustrated Sam Winchester.
and yes this chapter's title is misleading but I didn't know what to call it and I didn't want a spoiler
The demon laughed, "you have no idea what you walked into, huh?"
Dean whipped the tears off his face, "I'm sure it is, but yeah, let's check."
Cas was in his house in the living room. He lived alone in a small one-bedroom house with a garden in the back. Cas had just finished eating dinner and was getting comfy on his couch in order to read. His phone pings on the coffee table. Someone texted him but he doesn't have their number saved.
No matter how many times Sam tried to engage Dean in a conversation. It never lasted. Dean would give short answers, sometimes only giving a nod in response.
"I finished number 6!" Sam called giddily from the kitchen.
Dean looked down at his shaking hands and closed his eyes.
"Wow, Sam. That's a lot to handle."
You were the one that ran down that ally.
"They should be, I mean, there are multiple witnesses, and when I testify, there's no question we'll win it."
The woman finally got up and started running. Dean and the man were locked in a fight. Both only getting a couple of punches in. Dean dodged a punch then kicked the man in the balls. The man doubled over and Dean took a few steps back. He was just trying to keep the asshole here until the police arrived. He assumed the man would be down for a few. It was a mistake letting his guard down. The man lunged at Dean punching him right in the nose. Dean stumbled back. His eyes were watering and he couldn't see. The man probably broke his nose. The man pushed Dean against the wall as he struggled to blink away the tears. The man had a tight grip on Dean's wrists as he leaned in for a kiss. Dean tried to lean away from it but the man kissed his lips, cheeks, neck, anything on Dean's face. He tried to fight it but the man was stronger than him. When he finally pulled away he had a sinister smile on his face.
"Come on Dean, don't lie."
Cas's face darkens, "oh."
"Why not? Let's go for it."
"Sam, go!" Dean pushed his brother who thankfully did as he was told.
"Dad," it came out as a whimper.
Sam rolled his eyes, "fine it'll be 6:30, and
"Whore," he added then slammed the door. He didn't bother to see Dean's reaction. He went right back to his bed. He curled up and tried to sleep but found himself more awake than before. The rage probably helped the alcohol wade off quicker.
He was in Hell, well Crowley's illegal club. The music was a solid pounding beat. There might have been song lyrics, but Dean didn't hear them. His day had been real shity and so he came to the club hoping for a quick high. There were so many people around. Whatever drugs that new guy gave him didn't do the trick. Bar on the right, the DJ on the left. Normally he was more careful with what drugs he was putting in his body, but not today. Dean's trying to focus. Stumbling from table to table. Whatever he took was fucking him up and not in a good way. He's bumping into people. He needed to find a dealer with the good stuff. So many people everywhere. Even more so now that the last drugs were taking him down. There was a sea of people on the dance floor. He finds himself in the bathroom. A guy hands him a pill. Acid. Good stuff. Could improve his mood. He's on the floor. Why's he on the floor. It's quiet here. No someone's talking. Someone else is also talking? No music though. He wasn't in the club. He was face down on the floor. Hardwood, covered in drool. Covered in vomit.
"Dad I-"
"What the hell Dean, you were two months sober."
"Well, that's not possible. In order to move on, you need to deal with it."
Sam was glad that things went back to normal. Whenever Dean got shut in like that, he would ask for help on his homework. This coaxed him into talking and feeling better.
"Will do."
Dean and Benny started talking again. They carried the rest of the conversation.
There's no triggering topics in this chapter. I will update tags and add warnings when triggering topics come up.
"You can blame Moose too. Law school fits him well."
He soon noticed some brunette glaring at him. He pointed her out to Cas, "recognize that chick glaring?"
A hand grabbed the hair on the back of his head. He felt someone's breath on his neck. They spoke right into his ear, "get out or I'll have someone drag you out."
No one bothered him for a while after that. At least he thinks it's a while. He can't be sure, he's not paying attention to what's happening around him.
"Well you get off at 5:30, so I was thinking 6?"
He was eating breakfast at the kitchen table.
"Alright will do. What time?"
"He grabbed my wrists and slammed me against the wall."
"Oh, we will," Lucifer narrowed his eyes, "no further questions your honor."
Sam looked up at his brother, a forkful of spaghetti in his shocked mouth. He chewed and swallowed. Then he spoke, "what do you mean?" Dean was calm, almost too calm for Sam's liking. Dean never,
Soon he was sitting in the courtroom next to Cas, unable to sit still. He wasn't going to be up right away. He knew that. But the ceremonial court stuff seemed to last forever. He used the rubber band and made it into a star. Then he just stretched the band back and forth.
"Don't you know? Weren't you the one he was fucking this morning?"
Cas felt his heart beat faster, "what do you mean?"
"Dean!" Garth called from across the room causing everyone to look towards the door. Dean's embarrassed but he can't help but smile. Garth was just such a small, warm and cuddly person.
"Apples covered in sugar and baked in bread."
"Thank you, brother."
"Cas look," she points to the ground, "scratch marks. I think-"
Dean sat down at one of the chairs at the kitchen table. He didn't say much as Benny cleaned the wound with a damp paper towel. Then he tapped a bandage on it.
Dean continued, "that's when to police showed up. The man was still holding me but he was distracted. So I pushed him off then I saw red. I started going off on the man's face. The cops pulled me off him. They took me down to the station."
Sam resumed crying. Dean had such a big heart. What could have possibly made him this upset?
"No, that was when the police showed up."
Somehow he made it back home. He collapsed onto his couch and let his tears really flow. His tears were messy and his nose started running. His couch was getting messy. He didn't care. He just tried. He forced himself to breathe. His face felt super hot. It was probably from running but the tears didn't help.
"Well, I better see you back here tomorrow!"
"SPEAK SON WHAT"
Whatever he couldn't care less. He could lose Cas's number.
Hesitantly, Cas took his flask of holy water out of his pocket. He flicked some on to the man. The man closed his eyes but didn't burn at the holy water.
"Why would I make it up?" Dean cried out, louder than he meant.
Cas yanked the door open all the way with a glare. He laced venom into his words, "what the hell do you want?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"But- but I need-"
, Dean reminds himself.
"Sam!" Dean called with his head still in his hands.
"I don't know, let's ask him." Cas shook the man's shoulders. No response. He slapped him. Still no response. He tried slapping him again. This time the man gasped and opened his eyes.
"Well I asked him what you were apologizing for, and he said you thought he was a homeless person, and you told him to get out of the building. But I know you would never treat a homeless person like that and then I asked him how you knew he could help me with math and he just shrugged. I don't know, he didn't want to talk about it."
"Tell us first."
He took a deep breath and looked back at Lucifer, "can you repeat the question?"
Cas forced himself not to roll his eyes again, "don't ask stupid questions."
"No," Dean said instantly, then he looked in her eyes and realized he couldn't lie to her, she would understand. "We fought, he pushed me against the wall, there was one kiss but the police showed up right after."
"Good, they took a quiz. The worst part of teaching is grading though so not looking forward to that."
"Sammy, no!" Dean pleaded for Sam to back off.
"Dean," a slight smile tugs at Crowley's lips, "what are you doing here?"
Tears silently fell down Sam's face.
"Sammy?" he croaked out.
Dean half-laughed, half-grunted.
"What are you working on?" Cas asks eventually.
Dean clenched his fists, but before anything could happen, Cas grabbed the back of his upper arm. He stepped in front of Dean and put his arm out. He forced the man blocking their path to move. The news camera was now pointed at the group of men, suspecting a commotion to occur, so the mob backed off. Cas guided Dean into the building.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, Benny I'm taking my business elsewhere."
Cas hurried over to her, "what?"
"Yeah..."
"Because you've been sober. At least mostly sober for the past couple of months."
"I'll say! I mean it's hard enough falling for someone that doesn't swing you're way but man, thinking you were dating? Wow!"
"Nah, I went to Waffle House."
"Have you eaten yet? I'll make you something."
"I was..." he closed his eyes, "I was at Crowley's. I think something was laced. Then I- the bathroom... the floor, I-I don't, I don't-"
"Dean, I forgive you. If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine."
"Let me explain then! Then he'll be good again."
"I-I haven't- I haven't seen my brother since he was 25 and now- now he's 55? That's oh god, that's if he's even alive. God, I'm still 30. What will- oh god- he'll try and kill me- I'll freak him out- he'll think he escaped- I-I-I can't I-"
Tomorrow. He'd feel better tomorrow. He would sleep it off.
He didn't move. Even when he stopped crying. There was no point. No where to go. His last resort was hell on earth and they just threw him out.
He narrowed his eyes, "if you're human, why are you tied up?"
"Defense you may now question the witness," Judge Michael said.
Dean's lips trembled. Crowley's grip on Dean's chin tightened as he bent down and whispered into Dean's ear, "come back when you have money."
"Crowley I need a hit. The strongest you've got."
"Nothing."
"Yes."
Dean forced a shaking hand to his face, "and- and more."
He stares at the blue line. He isn't sure what to say. He types then deletes. Type then delete. Type then delete. The blue line blinks back at him mockingly. Finally, Cas decides on what to send.
Sam was doing his math homework on the kitchen counter. Dean entered the room and looked at Sam expectantly.
Dean had no energy, no emotion, no... life.
"Wait, you like me as in you think I'm good-looking?"
"Can you tell me?"
Crowley threw Dean's shirt at his face, "you pathetic little thing."
He almost didn't recognize Profesor Novak. He was young enough that Sam assumed he was a student. The way he was stumbling around, he was definitely drunk. He felt required to help him. He wouldn't exactly call him and Profesor Novak friends, but he and Dean definitely were. Also, he was super drunk and it wasn't even late. Something had definitely happened. Something Dean didn't tell him about. Dean seemed happy this morning. Like really happy. He would've sworn that he'd just gotten together with someone. He thought it was with Castiel specifically. But Castiel was devastated to the point of breaking his sobriety. Something wasn't right.
"No, it's not!"
"I'm good Clarence. Business is good," her eyes shifted over to Dean, "Hello Dean."
How could he not? It was right there advertising his favorite brand of cigarettes.
Cas hadn't been in a liquor store in so long. The cashier definitely thought he was insane. He kept walking around. He couldn't decide what to get.
"Of course Benny," Dean put his hand on his shoulder, "you can stay as long as you like."
Dean scoffed. "Why are you up this early?"
"How can I not worry, Dean?" Sam sounded so broken.
"Terrified. She was crying, begging someone to save her."
"Well it's nice to meet you too," Dean sat down at the table and the waiter came over. He brought the boys a sprite and Eileen some orange juice.
"You know I can't Dean, if you don't want to talk about it fine. I'll give you some time, but let's get you home."
"Def Leppard?" Cas asked pulling the car out.
"Hold on brother, we gotta clean that cut on your back and you got scrapes on your stomach and hands," Benny gestured at Dean.
Charlie crossed her arms, "there's an override switch."
"Dean... please."
Cas nodded, "That makes sense."
"Whatever man," Dean said turning to his right and walking away.
She's safe. You're safe.
"You know why. And I- I heard you, Dean. You had a nightmare, right? About Alistair?"
He put the needle down, "there's plenty of dealers you can buy stuff off outside."
"It was stupid. Don't worry about it."
"Why?"
tw: mentions/implications of rape
"WHAT WAS THAT?"
"Because I've been there. Feeling empty. And I know you think it'll always be like this or you've forgotten what it's like not to feel empty."
"Is taking classes hard? Sorry, I don't mean to be offensive but this school isn't for the hard of hearing so like how does class work?"
"For now."
"Don't you ever call Dean that, ever!"
"Freeze! Police!"
"Hey Sam?" Dean asked.
"Bitch."
Dean sighed, "I'm not an alcoholic, ok? I used to do drugs. Me and alcohol are fine."
The man's eye widened for a second. Then he nodded and stepped aside.
"Yes," Dean clenched his fists.
"Do you want me to come with you?"
Cas nodded.
-------
He didn't move or open his eyes, but he grunted to get the person to go away.
Dean really didn't want that, but he could always scrub it off later. Then again, that would just be another task he would have to do tomorrow.
"Dude," she punched his arm. She glanced at Castiel who, thankfully, was talking with a different student, "keep your voice down. Besides, I already know this stuff."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean looked up at Sam, voice soft, almost embarrassed, "I didn't want you to miss your math test."
"You helped me think through it. That made it make sense. Can you help me with the rest of the worksheet?"
Dean cuts him off with another kiss. His hands find their way to the back of Cas's neck. He feels Cas's hands move up and down his back. He eagerly pulls Cas closer and runs his hand through Cas's hair.
Dean looked down at his shaking hands and closed his eyes.
"I care, Dean, and I know you do too." Confusion was quickly added to Sam's anger when he noticed dry blood under Dean's nose and on his knuckles.
Sam's eyes widened, "Dean what the hell?! He's an alcoholic why would you-"
"Dude, who are you?" a young guy said from the front row.
The smile dropped from his face, "yeah I know I shoulda called, but I wasn't really sure what I was going to do."
"Sammy, you don't have to apologize," Dean smiled at his brother, "I'm the one that needs to apologize. The things I said, the things I did."
"Well you did make it to two months, and then when you smoked again you came back to the meetings."
He quickly pulled up his google calendar. He sighed. He didn't. He wouldn't have been able to attend if he did have class anyway. He opened his website and canceled his office hours.
"That's a dick move even for you Dean."
John takes a sip of his coffee before speaking, "I got a call from your school today."
"We?"
"Yeah? Even the shortcut I used?"
"Sam," Cas nodded.
"You sure you don't want to stay with Eileen?" Dean said thinking about how he was going to meet up with Cas at some point.
"Shut up, anyways how was your day?"
Dean's eye widened, "wait no- I didn't mean. I mean we're here together, but we're not together. I just- sorry. Not interested."
Dean put the marked back and laughed nervously, "sorry I-"
no matter what you do
"I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you!"
"WHAT THE HELL DID YOU SPEND IT ON!"
"Hmmm," Benny took a moment to think.
brought up the case.
"That's good Dean. You're ok."
"Dude, it's all good," Charlie smiled, "honestly."
Cas closed the door. They stood awkwardly in the mudroom.
"Yes I assume, he was there and he told me that Dean was in the junkyard. I went and tried to talk to Dean. We talked and he told me he never went to college and, I still can't believe I said this, but I told Dean I wanted him to do more math and that if he didn't, he would be wasting his head."
Dean thought about his nightmares. God, he wished he could just wake up on command. Houses and people fly by. He tries to forget. Remind himself that that was the past. It wasn't real.
"We don't even know what happened."
"Eileen and I met in class."
"Sam can you uh," he cleared his throat, "can you not follow me? I want to talk to Cas alone."
"I had just arrived and when I asked for my favorite drink, Makers Mark, the bartender told me they were all out. So I left to go to a different bar."
"Then why you do it?"
"I think so, Sammy. I mean, there's so many labels out there."
Cas stepped back and told Charlie to do the same.
ALSO, thanks to literally all of you, especially those who leave comments, I'm honestly writing this story because of you. And for those few that have commented multiple times, I see you and I literally scream from joy to see your comment. So thanks for reading! I hope you enjoy going more in-depth in this AU!
Dean left and began searching through each room. He could feel the blade's presence somewhere close, but nothing exact. Hours pass and he narrows it down to one room. He searches and searches but it's not there.
He was in the kitchen making lunch. Talking to Sam about his day. His father was passed out on the couch.
. He was there but his mind wasn't. It was just watching. Watching him sit there as it all went down.
"Thanks Benny. I-I I don't know what happened!"
Sam couldn't help but smile back at his brother. Something had happened last night to make him this happy. Dean was never this happy in the morning.
Everything was flying back through his head. Memories of Dean at his lowest. When he overdosed and Crowley dragged him across the floor. Only moving when he was choking on his own vomit. It was eerily similar to the way he found Dean today.
"You won't take our souls?"
Winter_Wolf101 I know you specifically requested against it, but there's gonna be some rough misunderstandings coming up :)
Dean grunted in frustration, "just let me be."
"That doesn't make pie a fruit!"
Dean huffed, "I didn't have any money."
"You're welcome, Sam." Cas then turned away and walked to his car.
It was Cas. "Sorry didn't mean to startle you,"
Sam laughs but gets serious again, "you sure you're alright?"
"Um, do you guys mind if we stop somewhere?" Dean requested, "I uh I haven't eaten in like 30 years."
Sam did the math. It came out to 73. He then wrote down 73 x 8.
Bobby's face softened, "That's good son," he took his hands off Dean, "but you didn't answer my calls you didn't text me."
Dean grabbed onto Cas's arm, "I need to go, now."
"I'm fine Castiel. Is that new guy Dean here with you?" she asks.
"So obedient. So submissive."
"Sammy," Dean's voice broke, "what happened?"
"Oh well ok, wanna go out to eat someplace? A bar?"
Cas feels heat rush to his cheeks "I just meant he looks so peaceful now. It's nice. He's obviously been through so much."
"We uh kissed," Dean bit his lip, thinking about how nice it was to have Cas's lips against his, "we're dating now."
"Dean where are you right now?"
"Hey Cas, I hope it's not a bad time..."
"What? I- no bu- what did Dean do?"
"Why?" Charlie asked.
Once everyone had settled in, Garth spoke again, "hello everyone. I know some of our veterans will remember him from last year, but since we have some new faces I think it's proper to have him introduce himself again."
"So say you all?" the judge asked.
She looked up at him, "thank you Dean, you saved my life."
"Thank you Dean."
"No I'm not."
"Bitch."
His bother's head shot up. He was crying but a smile spread across his face.
Charlie parks the car in front of the history building. They follow the signs inside the building to Sam's office.
"I can't thank you two enough," Sam shakes both their hands, "I will never be out of your debt."
Dean put his phone down and stared at the beer in his hand. He sloshed the drink around for a moment then downed the rest like a shot. He was working on fixing up a motor on a 1970 Ford Mustang Boss 302. It wasn't his favorite looking car, but when the engine was fixed up right, man could she purr. He'd been putting off working on it, but now that he started it, he didn't want to leave it unfinished. He drank through another beer as he installed the fixed up motor. He texted Cas he was on his way and Cas responded with an emoji.
"I'm not sure if you wanna talk about this with Benny around."
"Exactly, I'm struggling and, no offense Dean, you barely made it through high school. If I can't do it, what makes you think you can?"
Dean was breathing heavily, he was trying to look through the glove box but the tears in his eyes made it difficult to see.
The demon's face completely relaxed, "whatever." His whole demeanor changed. He squeezed his eyes shut in concentration. The room started rumbling.
Sam pulled away, "Dean, I left you down there because I thought you couldn't be saved and I couldn't kill you. The only way I was able to leave is knowing that I did everything. That there was no solution, but I was wrong. I was told that hands of God don't exist. Dean, I'm so sorry for giving up on you, please forgive me."
Dean stared up at his brother, "I did, didn't I" he smiled for a moment the got serious, "oh shit, Cas." He got out of the car.
"What about like with Sam?"
"I'm proud of you too Dean."
Sam wiped tears off his face and tried to forget how empty his brother looked. How he wouldn't get off the ground. How he was so desperate to go numb he was willing to pimp himself off to Crowley. What the hell happened? Dean and Cas were supposed to get together. How could-
Cas leaned forward, "I know you don't think it helps-"
"No. Thanks for the little show though."
"Sleepin," Dean laid down again but the two men forced him to sit back up.
"Yup, bye."
She gives him a small smile, "of course. Take care of yourself."
Dean stood up too, "deny it all you want but you're not getting sober."
Dean feels light-headed, but he smiled.
"He- he attacked me." Dean wanted to cry, but he could never in front of his father.
(See the end of the chapter for
"That's a long story. Why don't you tell me what year it is?"
The man was Lee? And he called Sam? Stupid snitch.
"But it was only because Stacy forgot to put the weed in."
Cas's arm was pulled forward as the blade was summoned. He had no choice but to let go. The blade flew through the air and right into Dean's outstretched hand. Dean grasped the blade and held it out. He had a wicked grin and bloodlust in his eyes as the Mark started to glow.
"Y-yes." Dean didn't know the exact emotion behind his Dad's gaze, but it was scarily similar to greed. John fought the urge to smile.
Dean sighed, "I don't-"
She laughs, "not as crazy as him I can promise you."
Dean tried to regain his composure, but he couldn't. He tried and he couldn't.
"A rubber band. I need a rubber band. Turn around," Dean clenched his eyes close, "I need to go back."
Sam got a flask of holy water and quickly flicked some at the hunters.
There was some talking between Sam and Benny, but Dean paid it no mind. He hoped he could fall asleep again, but he wasn't that lucky. Before long, two people hauled him up. His arms were draped over their shoulders and he was forced to open his eyes. He tried to squirm away but he didn't have the drive to put up much of a fight. He sighed and allowed himself to be walked to the street.
"What Dean?"
"And you have every right to be. So please," he put his hand on Dean's arm, "let me help you."
Cas awkwardly hugged Dean back, "of- of course."
"Did it work?" Charlie asked.
Dean cleared his throat, "So what are you coming here for? I mean I heard you say you were what? Four months sober? Sorry, I just kinda tune the whole meeting out."
"Do you want to leave?"
"..."
"Open this door!" Benny was ready to kick it down if necessary. He didn't have to because a few seconds later he heard the lock clicking.
"WHERE'S YOUR PAYCHECK"
"..."
"This Cas guy. He's gonna give me a reason for treating Dean like that."
, Castiel reminded himself. That was the company on the back of the man's jean jacket. That's who he would go complain to once he saw what ridiculous thing this man wrote on the board.
Dean rolled his eyes and took another long sip.
He stood up and took his wallet out. He threw some bills down on the table and spoke in his normal voice, "come on Cas, I'll drive you back to your car."
"Sure Mr. Sleep-through-two-appointments," Dean jeered back as he cleaned off his hands.
Dean didn't respond, tightening his grip on the wheel. He looked over at Sam, his little brother Sam, and saw no hate in his eyes. Only curiosity.
"Actually Dean," Sam laughed at how awkward it sounded, "he told me to go to you for help and to tell you that he's sorry."
"No of course not."
"Professor Novak?"
Dean's face tightens, "what?"
"It's fine Cas. It's- well I don't hate her- it's complicated. I assume you know she was a druggie too right?" Cas nodded and Dean continued, "well she was one of Crowley's, we've crossed paths a couple of times."
. He smoked some more, but his mood didn't increase. Not like it had the first time. It had helped his muscles relax a bit but he was still on edge.
"Come on Bobby, you're starting to sound like all the girls from the bar."
"I- Sam's not coming." Dean bit his lip.
"Dean and I don't need some shrink. I'm fine." With that Dean pocketed the flask and left the bathroom. He shook his shoulders and looked around for Cas. He was over in a quieter corner talking to two guys. When Cas spots Dean, he waves him over.
"The First Blade is the jaw of a snake, kinda. You'll know when you see it. Alright, you stay here, and I'll go turn that
Dean fiddled with the edge of the blanket.
Sam opened the door, stepped inside, then closed it behind him.
"Wait is he- or it alive?"
"Oh," Cas spat. Then he slammed the door.
When he turned onto Dean's street he frowned. He could see a motorcycle in front of Dean's car. He didn't recall either of the brothers owning one.
"I don't know what you're even talking about. What changed between last night and now."
He felt calm again, but he was wide awake. He looked at the clock. 6:30 AM. God he barely slept. But he wasn't going back to bed. He was biting his nail. He couldn't just sit around for another three hours. He needed to move. There wasn't anything to do. That didn't matter. He threw on some jeans and his leather jacket and just started walking.
He ended up in front of the package store.
"Listen," Benny put his hands up, "I know you want to straighten everything out, but Dean ain't ready to listen. He barely let us treat his wound before he collapsed into his bed."
"Apparently someone noticed that you had bruises."
"What was the dream about?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Nonsense. Hey wait is this the class you and Eileen share?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"We'd never help you." Cas spat.
"Hey wait I knew that sign!" Dean smiled as he put his pinkie to his cheek and flicked upwards, "juice right?"
"What do you want?" Cas growled.
"Relax I'm just-" he took a deep breath, "I'm just going to ask him to explain himself. I know Dean wouldn't want anything violent."
Cas rolled his eyes and walked over. Dean grabbed Cas's face, surprisingly gently, and began passionately kissing. Cas kept his hands down but slightly kissed Dean back. When Dean finally pulled away, he kept his hands on Cas's face.
"What?"
Cas looked back at Dean, "you have a deal."
"Sam, if you ever need anything, or just want to talk, you can always come here."
Dean extended out his right hand and pointed at what looked like a burn mark. Charlie and Cas backed off. He was blocking the exit. They were trapped. Dean stuck his arm out and Cas felt the blade tug at his arm.
"No, it's not worth it. Working is important. I don't want to waste my life on trivial things."
Cas blushed, "yes and the way you were biting your lip I just assumed-"
He was being lifted up. He tried to help the big person carrying him but his legs fell out from under him. WALK he told his legs. His legs did not walk.
"Why would I do that?" Dean stopped and turned around, "you can help me find it."
He turned towards the whiteboard and tilted his head. The man had solved it and given the proofs. He would have to double-check his answer sheet to make sure, but everything looked correct to him.
"What are big brothers for? You have any siblings Eileen?"
"Yeah, you into cars?"
Sam signed,
Cas waited on the other end of the line. Not wanting to interrupt and say the wrong thing.
"So yeah, hope that makes sense," Dean turned to the class and smiled.
"I don't know. Honestly, I didn't know you guys ever met before. What happened between you too."
"Well you head in the courtroom that um yeah you heard that and after well," Dean coughed, "my dad was pissed. He'd hired a lawyer but... and he yelled. Said I wasted money said I made it up- and I-" Tears were falling down Dean's face.
"Oh I should warn you, Dean, it is a bit of a drive."
"I was with Lisa and we sitting on the bench outside school. She's telling me about how she needs this new leather jacket that just hit the store. Then a guy wearing that exact jacket walks right in front of us."
Dean pulled up to the church and put the Impala in park. Well, technically it was a church, but there were so many community events there and there weren't many Jesus statues, so Dean decided to think of it as more of a community center. It's been a long time since he's been to this rehab group. He was kinda nervous. He shook his head. He shouldn't be nervous, he's got nothing to prove. Dean saw a few familiar faces enter the building but he couldn't make himself go in yet. Finally, the meeting was going to start without him, so he got out of the car.
Dean hadn't noticed that John woke up.
"Shut up!"
"It's just such a small thing," Dean shook his head, "and I was freaking out and looking back I," he chuckled to himself, "I don't know I just overreacted."
"You're bleeding. Did they throw you on the ground?"
Cas hesitantly stepped forward, "Dean, is that you?"
Bobby patted Dean on the shoulder and ushered him off to work. Dean went into the shop and started with a couple of basic oil changes. While he was doing things with his hands, he found it easier to think. He reflected on what Cas had said. About his family. About life. About things getting better. Dean couldn't say he really believed any of it, but he liked working on cars. He shouldn't have stopped going to work. Something about cars... there's just always a fix. Even though he's been a mechanic for his entire life. He never got tired of it.
Sam eagerly put his bag down and got two plates out of the cabinet. "Beer?" he asked Dean.
As he got closer to the house, he heard laughter. He instantly recognized Dean's laugh. He was about to smile, but then he frowned. There was another man laughing as well. It wasn't Sam's laugh, this was way too deep. If there was an emergency, why was Dean laughing?
Cas's eyes widened, "there's a pulse!"
"Fine, what about the math then?"
The demon had a wicked grin on his face, "well if you're so confident, why don't we fight?"
Cas hugged him back, "of course, Dean. Anytime."
"Deny it all you want, but you'll always come crawling back to me, whore," Crowley spat.
"Sammy go to your room. Now!" his voice was quiet but urgent. Their father wasn't even upstairs yet and Dean could smell the alcohol. Their father was yelling.
Dean nodded and blew out a smoke ring.
"Dad was right it was dumb for me to even bring it up."
"You were the one that ended the deal when you attacked-" Dean started coughing, "what the- cough- what are you doing?"
. Would a hero let himself be pushed against the wall? Would a hero let himself be touched like that? Again?
"Dean-"
"We can't give it to him. He'd be too dangerous."
"WHAT!"
Also, updates are probably going down to once a week because I'm working on another fic as well
"I know it's here, but I can't find it."
Benny was silent for most of Cas's ramble, but his anger was too much by the end. His muscles unfroze and he moved without thinking. He took one big step forward, pulled his arm back, and then slammed his fist across Cas's face.
"That wasn't you Dean," Charlie smiled at him, "your brother knows that."
Ceaser elbows his husband, "it's a 1981 DeLorean DMC-12 and it's my pride a joy."
"That's good, but Dean, you can't just ignore it. You can't magically make yourself better."
Sam looked up in shock, "what?"
"You made the conscious decision to set your alarm and then go for a run, this early."
Sam sat up in his seat, "so what really happened professor?"
"It's fine, I just finished dinner and was about to start reading."
"I- I want to forget about what happened. To just move on."
"Good I wish I knew," Sam whipped his face and cleared his throat, "Benny if this is too much, I mean with everything else..."
"Let's go home," Catherine said, "I don't know you, Dean, but if you need anything, ever, just text me." They exchanged numbers as the police officer came back in.
"What? That's a thing?"
"Yeah," Dean spoke soft and slow, "I don't know if I can do it."
"Well by timing he's probably hungover in his bed and I bet..." he pulled out Dean's phone, "you know Dean's passcode?"
He thought yelling at Dean would make him feel better, but he still felt like shit. It probably wasn't emotional. Just physical. Just because of the hangover.
"Of course, Sam," Cas gave a small smile, "and you can call me Castiel if you'd prefer."
Sam rolled his eyes, "He probably just assumed you went to college."
------
Dean shrugged, "I changed my mind. Now that I'm older I gotta make grown-up decisions. Like choosing work over a silly party."
"DON'T TALK BACK TO ME!" He grabs Dean by the shirt.
tw: breaking sobriety
Dean to a long drag of his cigarette and Sam waited patiently as he blew the smoke out. "It was a fight at first. Kicked him in the nuts. I thought I'd won so I let my guard down. He broke my nose and I couldn't see." Dean took a deep breath. "He grabbed my wrists. Slammed me against the wall. Said I was fuckable. Feminine. A whore. That I'd be just as good as the girl," Dean had started crying and his voice started cracking a little, "I told him I was gonna kill him. He said I'd never get the chance."
"Sam will be-"
"I'm safe, Cas, I'm at the junkyard." It was the truth. Dean was sitting on the ground leaning up against a vintage car.
"Hey Sam, is Dean with ya?"
"Well you know I have a challenge problem that I put on the whiteboard."
Dean slapped away the finger that was still against his chest, "I did it all for Sam. To provide for him. To give him a better life!"
Dean's eye widened.
Benny took a deep breath, then spoke, "she was sick. Cancer. Doctors didn't catch it until it was already in the later stages. She went through tough treatment. She fought so hard. She passed a couple of weeks ago."
That was the scariest thing.
The class all started talking as the students began packing up their computers and notebooks.
"What if I break down? What if I can't do it?" Dean asked in a whisper.
The door to Professor Haden's office opened and Cas turned towards the sound.
"Will the defendant please stand. You may read the verdict"
"Don't worry, you can do it. So let's break it down. First, we know that there are 365 days in a year, and every day he gets 75 cents from his mom. So write down 365 times .75. Then he gets $8 every five days. Now we have to see how many 5 day segments are in a year. Any guess on how to do that?"
"Look at me," he commanded.
"Actual I was teaching the class, which you would know if you went sleeping."
Dean looked down at his plate while chewing his food. When he finally swallowed he looked up at Sam, "Why?"
"I'm sorry Dean, I didn't realize you knew each other. She owns this bar."
He grunted.
Sam watched his brother walk away. He didn't try and stop him. There was no reason. When Sam looked into Dean's eyes, he saw only pain.
So Cas cried. Cried for his loss. Cried because he let himself be open. Then got spit in the face.
Dean's jaw dropped, "no way, you're insane!"
He shut the door behind him. It sounded so loud.
Dean keeps his cigarette lit for as long as he can, but it inevitably goes out. He thinks about lighting up another. He still has one in his pocket that he saved. He didn't want to lie to Sam. It was just... a contingency plan. He decides against it and goes inside.
Sam frowned, "well you're an alcoholic and you obviously need some help right now... You've helped Dean when he needed help, I'm sure he can help you."
, he thought. Alistair grabbed him by the chin. "Don't talk to me like that boy. I'm not even here." He rubbed his eyes and took a deep breath. He had stopped walking and he didn't realize it. He started up again, this time keeping his shoulders back and his head up. He turned onto a path that led to a trail around a lake. He forces himself to really look at his surroundings. To take in nature. He listens to the crunch of the leaves beneath his feet. He watches the squirrels chase each other. He chuckles as he sees two young kids smoking a joint. Then he frowns. Maybe he should stop them. Who's he kidding. Teenagers would never listen, especially to some stranger. He certainly didn't listen to anyone's advice. Although he wished he would have. He wondered how different his life would be if he'd never gotten high. Never got addicted. Never ODed in Crowley's club.
"Boom," Dean leaned back like he had won the world. Sam shook his head in defeat.
"Of course, now you can say we've had fun together."
Cas reached out to the door and pulled. It opened.
A minute later, Dean speaks again, "hey Cas, I never really got to thank you. For yesterday and now today. I really didn't want to get my brother involved. He worries about me enough."
"He solved it?!" Sam gasped.
"Alright class," Cas sighed, giving a slight glare at the group of laughing girls, "I'm glad Dean was able to clear up any confusion. If you have any questions you're welcome to stay, the rest of you can leave a few minutes early."
THINK HE WAS HOT?"
He clenched his fists.
"It's fine," Benny interrupted, "we'll just patch up this cut then you can go to bed, yeah?"
Dean rubbed his face, "can't you just use what she told you?"
"You draw an auxiliary line in the second trapezoid, then you have two congruent 3, 4, 5 triangles. That gives you part a."
"I drove. It wasn't that fast, I live on the other side of town," Cas was kneeling in front of him.
"YOU'VE WASTED ALL OUR MONEY. DO YOU WANT SAM TO STARVE IS THST IT?"
Charlie began exploring the machines to try and find out how they were getting power. Cas began skimming through the various books and files. After a couple of minutes, Charlie comes back into the main room.
"Yeah," Dean smiled.
"So are you pre-law too?"
Dean did, nodding to Catherine as he passed by. When he sat down he realized he'd been holding his breath. He steadied his breathing, but his mind was still fuzzy. He knew he was in the courtroom and yet he couldn't hear what was going on. He saw the courthouse around him. The judge, the lawyers, Catherine,
Dean peered at the glowing sign in front of them, "Cas is this a club? I thought-"
Dean opened his eyes wide, "w-what?"
Dean whisper screamed, "Sam what the hell is going on? If you got something to say, say it, but we ain't kicking Benny out."
"DEAN! GET IN HERE!"
"Yeah," Eileen laughed at Dean's enthusiasm.
"Oh not on purpose, no. You see the only way for you to get out of here is to stop the lockdown. The only way to stop the lockdown is to A. get me back in that dungeon, which is never going to happen, or B. kill me. So if you don't want to starve to death I suggest you get going."
"Heh, yeah. Seriously, though, I had a lot of fun tonight."
Cas opened his mouth to speak, but Dean cleared his throat.
Sam smiled. He tried not to be awkward, but all he could think about was Cas.
The hunters glanced at each other.
"No. I just," Cas paused not knowing what exactly he wanted to talk to Dean about, "I just want to talk to him. That's all."
People file into the circle of chairs set up in the middle. That's when Dean spots him. Cas has his bright blue eyes staring at Dean. After a moment Dean looked away and found an open seat next to an unfortunately familiar man named Crowley.
"I'll repeat the question. Do you remember what the jury ruled on the case?"
It was the same officer from before, "You both can go, we've got all we need for now. We'll be in touch."
"Sustained. Please rephrase your question, Mrs. Sheppard," Judge Michael said.
Benny patted Sam's shoulder, "it's alright, brother, and thanks."
He forced himself to breathe out. In then out. In 1 2 3. Out 1 2 3.
"What'd you get up this early? You still having nightmares?"
Charlie nodded.
The files talk about a demon named Crowley who apparently was the king of hell. He was the one who brought Dean, human Dean, to meet Cain. That's when Dean got the mark, but not when he turned into a demon.
"Come in," a voice says from inside.
"Will you- will you stay with me?"
"Why?" Cas sneered.
"Bu-wha-hey I was not dodging the subject!"
"I was hoping maybe I could take you up on your offer, on talking about my problems. If it's still on the table... and I don't know, it's easier to talk on the phone."
They leave the bunker and get into Cas and Charlie's car. Charlie pulls out her computer.
Cas nodded, "no matter what happens."
Dean was getting hurt. Dad was hurting Dean. Dad was drunk. He couldn't control himself. Dean wanted Sam to hide so Dad couldn't hurt him too.
"Here I was thinking I was the hottest guy in here," the man smiled, "then I saw you." He winked.
