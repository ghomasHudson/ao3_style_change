The headache pounds, and he struggles to move his arms and legs, to fight, to run. Feels sweat bead on his forehead, feels his face twitch. Curls his fingers into a fist at his side.
“If you look directly at the camera with your right eye, Dr. Fitz,” JARVIS says calmly.
she thinks, and the tears are falling now. As Bucky sits upright, dismayed and offended on Steve’s behalf, she bends to wrap her arms around Steve’s narrow, bony shoulders. He doesn’t seem to notice, just continues to hang his head miserably, until her hand finds and covers her soulmark on his skin, and his eyes widen, head jerks back to glance over his shoulder and she feels a jolt as his eyes seem to meet hers. “You’re wrong,” she says, soft and fierce, watches those eyes soften and shine with wet emotion. “I love you no matter how strong you are. I love you no matter what. You’ll find me, Steve, and it’ll be hard, but we’ll get through it. We’ll get through it, all of us, together. Okay?”
“Maybe not today,” Toni says, and he catches her eyeing him speculatively. “Later tonight? I can do the finishing touches myself, if you’d prefer.”
Bucky’s chest is tight, like there are bands around his ribs squeezing the breath out of him.
Toni stares at him, then looks at the lawyer, then looks at Clint. Clint has an eyebrow raised. Frowning, Toni unfolds her copy of the will, licks her thumb and begins to speed-read. Within a few minutes, the will is falling from her numb fingers. “What?” she says softly, raising her gaze to eye the lawyer. “I don’t… understand. He left me everything?”
not happening. Hasn't since I found where they were keeping you. Jesus, James. I would never do that to you.”
A bullet whines off the forearm of her armor, scratching the paint and digging a furrow in the dirt. Toni makes an unimpressed noise and looks up The HUD tracks the target – the second guard, no doubt alerted to her presence by the utter ineptitude of the first guard. The targeting system calculates her angles, his cover. He’s speaking into his radio, voice high but steady, rattling off something that sounds like a warning in maybe Turkish. The rifle cracks again, and a bullet buries itself in the ground between her boots.
in here, all the things they want to say but never will, all the blame they want to throw, all the apologies they want to make. Christ, he’s choking on their pride and their stubbornness, and it’s just making his headache so much worse.
and the pit of her stomach drops out. “Aw fuck,” she says, tears squeezing out of her eyes as she cradles her probably-broken hand inside the crushed gauntlet. “He’s got his shield back.”
Loki, it could only be Loki, his face pale and bloody, neck hanging at an unnatural angle. Her breath came hard and fast in her chest, until her thoughts were swimming and her vision blurring.
This is too easy, he thinks, moving swiftly along empty corridors and checking the handles of doors as he goes. There was hardly any resistance to their entry, once they got through the shatterproof glass. Wasn’t Iron Man supposed to have an army of minions? Lethal robots patrolling his base of operations?
Another coughing fit overtakes her, leaves her head spinning and her breath short and shallow. “But I would have liked to have met you,” she says, weak, low, faint, and closes her eyes to sink back against the pillows, to slip into the last fever sleep she’ll ever have. She’s so tired of fighting to stay alive, tired of being alone even when she’s surrounded by those she loves. She’s ready, eager even, to disappear into the dark.
“I know,” Toni says, pressing into Natasha’s forehead just a little, and closes her eyes.
“You can’t have my armor,” Rhodey says, because Clint is now looking at him speculatively. “Won’t fit you anyway. Go get your own.”
, and the man spins off into the darkness. She gags and drops to the floor, listing drunkenly on her feet before her body drops her on one knee. Panic hammers at her temples, and her head spins nauseatingly.
She tucks that realization into the back of her mind, lets it simmer on a quiet little burner, just in case she one day needs it. Because there is one Sorcerer Supreme she knows where to find, and failing that, she can go beat answers out of the Sorcerer-King of Latveria.
“No.” She closes her eyes, softens her tone. “No, it’s fine. It was going to come up sooner or later. I mean…” She draws in a breath and blows it out, opens her eyes. “It’s pretty fucking obvious it was going to come up at some point. I don’t even know why--” Her hand scratches at the left side of her chest, hooks her fingernails under skin, claws until it separates and shimmers into a panel of fine mesh.
And Toni
Tony never expected him to do anything less. The others have been in various states of optimism since Steve returned from Cloud Cuckoo Land, but Tony's always a pragmatist. And he knows that Schmidt is a survivor through and through, and with a four year old cosmic entity thinking he's her daddy, well… Schmidt's plans, until they manage to separate Kobik from his influence, will be difficult to predict, let alone counter.
“Shoot them in the face,” she says, turning her attention back to her paperwork. “I may not want to mass-produce weapons for the world at large, Obadiah, but I still own a
“Won’t do you any good,” he says, nips at her neck. “You still wouldn’t hear me coming.”
” Clint says in lieu of a hello, full of fury and a note Toni’s learned to identify as fear, “
Steve follows the nurse through the corridor, though he’s not sure why. There’s a pleasant haze over his thoughts, an urge to be compliant, that’s vaguely unsettling deep down where a mutinous little voice is still yelling at him to wake up. He wants to know where they’re going, but can’t find the desire to ask. He’ll find out soon enough.
The shield smashes into the bottom of her boot, and the jet goes dead. She loses control, crashes into the wall, through the wall, smashes through furniture and then through another wall, sliding to a stop on her back in another hallway, coughing and dazed. She sends an unaimed shot through the holes she made, and they angle off the shine of his shield. His heel crunches down on her working repulsor, and then it’s not working anymore.
Lightning-quick, Toni has her by the throat, slams her onto the desk, and bends over her until their noses are almost touching. “You tell Fury,” she says, soft and calm, “that if what I think happened has actually happened, I will turn all of my extensive resources, genius brain, and
“He suggested I schedule an appointment and ask pretty please.” Coulson looks amused, for some reason. “This is our appointment. Pretty please?”
He dreams of a woman with curly brown hair and an infectious laugh, calling his name as the world goes dark and cold. Dreams of a man laughing in sunlight, looking up at him in candlelight. Dreams of fights in trash-strewn alleyways, grunting and cursing and the sound of flesh punching into flesh. Dreams of a metal coffin and a bright white light, a soft-spoken man with a German accent and another with dark hair and a vandyke who talks fast and big.
Jesus, he just tried to kill her. How the hell is she so calm?  “March 4th. 2012.”
Clint shrugs, and there’s no sympathy, empathy or pity anywhere in his eyes. “Buy her a really big gift, say you’re sorry, and suck it up, princess. We’re not getting anywhere with this if we don’t get her on board.”
People wander in and out of his awareness, and eventually he starts recognizing faces as his body and senses finally begin the process of adjusting to the clamor and clang. He talks to some, answers questions, makes simple requests for books and writing materials when he feels like conversing.
“Don’t be an ass, kid. I can still ground you.” She scrubs shampoo into her scalp. “Or sell you to Gates,” she says thoughtfully. “What’s the status on Mark VIII specs, J?”
- Trapt, "Headstrong"
Tony swallows past the ball of gratitude and assorted other feelings lodged in his throat. “Couldn't hurt,” he says. “The harder it is for Steve to find me, the longer we have to figure out what the fuck to do about him. You sure you can stand having me around, birdbrain?”
“Perfect,” Rhodey says. “What were we talking about?”
He doesn’t know where to look. Staring off into space just makes him want to slip into the Winter Soldier, let fresh rime crystallize his thoughts, and that’s a bad idea with Clint at the other end of the room, because if he goes sociopath, Clint
He frowns, eyebrows twitching, as the memory tries to slip away from him, stinging him with pain like a static shock in warning that maybe he really doesn’t want to know what it contains. He chases after it, determined to catch it before it becomes a ghost file, because he has a feeling it has the answers he needs.
Natasha arches an eyebrow. “It’s cute how you think this is a democracy, Rhodes. It’s not my fault you were too slow to grab the opportunity when it rose. Besides, if you’re that eager for something constructive to do, FitzSimmons need training. Their basic SHIELD aptitudes aren’t going to cut it with this team.”
“Nothing in particular, ma’am. I apologize if I startled you. I simply wished to express my relief and gratification that you are doing well.”
“And the other half is full of exciting explosions and bad guys,” Coulson says mildly. “It's a fair tradeoff. You did good today, Toni. You'd make a good agent.”
“Deal with the Captain, Stark,” Magneto replies unexpectedly. Tony’s eyes flick to where he’s currently stripping thin plates from the bulkheads and sending them sliding left and right to block agents from creeping up behind a busy Thor and an equally busy Kamala Khan. “I may not be a cosmic entity, but I am more than capable of handling an unruly child.”
He sits and pulls his phone out of the pocket of his sweatpants, ties his hair back and plays Angry Birds quietly until Steve’s eyes fly open maybe ten minutes later. He knows the routine by now, has seen it enough times to move his legs out of the way as Steve scrambles off the bed and rushes for the bathroom. Moves them again after a prolonged period of muffled retching and spitting to let Steve lie back down, then slouches down in his chair and crosses his ankles on the mattress.
“Then by all means.”
Carol. Lost-her-fucking-mind Carol coming for Miles to arrest him for what he
Toni takes a moment to think, gives herself cover by yawning and stretching and scratching through her scalp with both hands. “I’m always looking for good pilots,” she says off-handedly. “Well, good
All credit to Clint, it only takes him a minute to recover from gaping shock, and then his hip shifts subtly, and the defensive posture turns into a coquettish sprawl against the door frame. “Sad for you,” he says with a smirk. “I was a circus performer. You have no idea how bendy I am.”
He covers July. Toni’s birthday is in May. Clint’s is January. Bruce, if Steve can talk him into it, covers December. How Pepper knows Natasha’s birthday is in November, he’s a little afraid to ask, because even her official SHIELD file doesn’t list that information. Pepper slipped her own name onto the list to cover February, with a sidebar stating it’s to keep Clint from complaining that, as an archer, he should be Cupid. And she helpfully points out that James Rhodes, Toni’s best friend who he still has to officially meet face to face, has a birthday coming up in October.
“I can’t believe I’m even considering this,” she mutters. “I’m a goddamn busy woman. I have companies to run, tech to invent, beaches to lay on eventually.” She picks up the charter again, flips through it one more time. Sighs, because she knows she’s going to do it. “Two conditions,” she finally says.
Toni laughs. “You’re an asshole,” she says fondly. “But yes. I’ll love you again then. Only then, and not before. Let’s go get this bullshit over with. I want to be home by this time tomorrow.”
She will not cry. She is not going to cry. “Why are you doing this, Pepper?” she says.
For some reason, Hogan looks amused as he spares Steve a quick glance. “Yessir. I head up security at Stark Solutions now, but I started in the transportation department as a driver. Toni didn’t mention?”
Her eyes flick to his hand on her wrist, then back to his face. Suspicion paints her face in lines hard and dark, and he grunts a little as the pressure increases against his restraining hand. “Steve warned me you might approach me with some cockamamie story,” she says, and her eyes narrow. “You destroyed a Helicarrier, Stark. God knows how many lives were lost. Do you have anything to say before I take you in?”
One by one, the items on the digital checklist JARVIS helpfully displayed turn green, and Toni’s grin just gets ewider. Anticipation builds in her gut, nervous energy that makes her feet want to jitter, her stomach tie in knots. She all but bounces in place, watching impatiently as the final few items run through their tests.
No, no,
futures). This culminates in Bruce Banner being killed by Clint Barton, as Bruce had made Clint promise to kill him if he ever started turning into the Hulk again, and the stress of about a hundred people showing up on his front step with accusations and threats of incarceration kinda started triggering the Hulk. At the very end, with Carol definitely having lost her shit and Ulysses' visions growing even more preposterous, extreme, and frequent, Carol tries to arrest Miles Morales, who she believes is about to murder Captain America based on Ulysses' visions.
He walks to stand beside her like he hasn’t the slightest worry she’ll repulsor him through a wall, like she isn’t one more piece of bad news away from going nuclear. “I can see that. Can I help with the clean-up? Seems like the very least we can do.”
Steve’s eyes go wide and soft, and his hand lifts off the bed, reaching out but stopping shy of touching. “You found her,” he breathes. “You found…” Cuts dead with a strangled noise, like an animal in pain, and Bucky knows he’s figured it out. “Oh fuck, no.”
Manhattan disappears behind her as she kicks in the afterburners and breaks the speed limit. Clouds whip past her helm, slapping liquid across the faceplate. There’s nothing but water below her, peppered with motorboats and unfurled sails, tourist cruises and private yachts. Muscle memory and long-term behaviour has her  dump height for showy speed. She skims the surface, corkscrews through the spray of a cigarette boat, sees a blur of faces and pointing fingers, the wink of the sun flashing off camera lenses and raised smartphones.
The word comes out breathless.
“Right away, Captain,” JARVIS replies, and the document is replaced by the SI standard phone interface. “Trying her office and personal cellular device now.”
His palm, broad and warm, curves around the back of her neck. Squeezes gently, solid and real. “You with me, Toni?”
He shrugs with an easy smile. “I like cooking,” he says, and doesn’t add
that’s it for him. He raggedly grinds into her, a series of pulses that jolt his whole body, kissing her desperately as everything goes staticky and bright.
(See the end of the chapter for
The way Toni’s looking at him, soft and vulnerable and teary,
“Incidentally,” she says to Bucky, bending over his arm again to fiddle futilely one more time before giving up and closing the open panel, “this is why it takes me going psychotically off the rails before I submit to authority figures. I don't do well sitting on my ass, and half the time, that's all they want me to do.”
He's breathing hard, wild-eyed, off balance and reeling, scrambles to his feet. A dark-haired man crouches over Stark, brushing back her hair, gently caressing her cheek, cradling her head in his lap. A man with a metal arm and a sniper rifle slung over his back. A familiar man, he realizes, and the world crumbles as Bucky Barnes stares furiously at him, torn between absolute rage and utter joy. Steve’s legs go out from under him and he's back on the floor, staring up at his soulmate, alive and well.
says the memory of Clint.
Carol, it should be noted, is given pretty much a blank check by the President to keep her Ultimates going in the aftermath of these events.
Most of the time, Phil respects Nick Fury, looks up to him. Seeks to emulate him, and master the vast range of skills Fury has in his arsenal. Today doesn’t seem to be shaping up into one of those days. “Director Fury, as far as she knew, SHIELD agents had broken into her home, damaged and destroyed her property, and abducted her soulmate. What happened to Agent Carter was unfortunate, but understandable under the circumstances.”
Ask her who he is.
He lets himself rise into the sky, until he can reach out and lay a hand on one of the cosmic-blue veins, and images of a very young, very small Steve flash past his closed eyelids. It would be tooth-rottingly adorable, if tiny Steve wasn't dressed in Junior Hydra clothing, helping his mother with her Nazi quilting bees. Instead of being charmed, Tony is horrified beyond all measure to see that broad, happy smile forming the words “Hail Hydra” without irony.
She cracks a baleful eye with an ascerbic comment on the tip of her tongue, but her breath hitches in her throat. Clint’s face hovers above hers so close their noses are practically touching. There’s a speculative look in his eyes. She licks her lips and watches his gaze flick down. A curl of heat rolls low in her belly.
romance right now,” she says, with the underscore of a snarl, and it occurs to him that he didn’t mean to say all that out loud, but he apparently did. “I don’t want gentle, I don’t soft kisses and slow touches and whatever other bullshit you think I
A long chapter, because I finally managed to get my pacing where I wanted it. This whole thing is a weighty 10,000 words, and I really should have broken it in two; there are a lot of good break points. However, since I have driven some of you to rage and despair and coping mechanisms, I'm not going to torture you any longer. Your chapter, folks. Enjoy!
Toni’s tiny smirk widens into a genuine grin, and slouches back in her swivel chair. She tucks one leg under her, and uses her other foot to gently swing the chair from side to side. “Not your call, I take it?”
And Toni is sobbing in his ear, deep, racking, hysterical sobs that shake her entire body. He’s sitting up, clutching her with two arms, protective and tight, shocky and wobbly and incredulous. “Jesus, Mary and Joseph,” he breathes. “Jesus fuckin' Christ. That little shit.”
“If you’re sure,” he says, still frowning at her.
For a long moment, all she can hear is the scream of the air over her suit, the faint hum of servos and repulsors, and her own harsh panting echoing inside the helmet.
before Clint’s fist impacts in the center of Steve’s face… and then Steve is rocking backwards with a sharp bark of pain, hitting the mattress heavily and streaming blood from his mouth and nose.
“Easy,” he murmurs into her hair. “The maids aren’t paid enough to scrub blood off the tiles.”
Toni wraps her hands, trying to keep the panic under control. She keeps her breath slow and regular, but her inhales are a trifle sharp, and her exhales come out shaky. She concentrates on the bright blue of the wrap, flexing her fingers and wrist to check the fit before closing the velcro strap on each hand. Concentrates on the feel of fitted cotton-lycra blend, the breeze on her arms, the floor under her bare toes. She’s barely got a handle on it, and she knows it. But this is something she has to do.
“Understood, Captain.”
Carter’s mouth opens and closes, her expression off-balance and uncertain. Toni laughs harshly, reckless with anger. “I’m sorry, did I go off-script? Was this not covered in the SHIELD agent’s guide to manipulating Toni Stark? Do you not have a snazzy, multi-point plan for dealing with your top consultant telling you to go fuck yourself? Can’t think of a comeback? C’mon, Carter, I don’t have all day.”
“How big is this goddamn base anyway?” Toni grumbles an hour later, snapping off another pair of repulsor blasts at another featureless grey door and finding yet another staircase leading down, down, down. She grips the rail and peers over the edge, lifting the faceplate with two fingers so she can listen with her own ears. For once, there’s nothing but silence and the too-loud drip of water, but the star is beating a steady cadence, a predatory, patient cadence.
I am set to live in the most decadent lap of luxury I feel like for about a thousand years. So there’s the door, off you fuck, and enjoy trying to debug Hammertech operating systems every time you want to check the goddamn weather.”
Voices are calling her name, swearing viciously. Hands and fingers and bodies swirling around her. Rhodey's face looms over hers again, fright and relief and hope and worry all storming through his eyes.
has escaped him until now. He’s floating in space in what is quite possibly the largest Iron Man armor he’s ever created, a goddamn Gundam if he were inclined to play to the millennial crowd. There are literal gods and forces of nature and superpowers at his back on the surface of the Moon, and the Phoenix makes them all look like a child’s plastic green army men.
how self-satisfied it is. She grinds her teeth together and her hands fist at her sides. “Big girl in a suit of armor,” he taunts, crooking his hand at her. “Take that off, and what are you? A plain old, boring-ass vanilla human.”
The knot of unease, the sense of
Today is the day that Stark Industries, quiet and dark for six months, hemorrhaging money left and right with all the retrofits and staff turnover and new hires, opens the doors on their brand spanking new domination of the telecommunications market.
Bucky’s grinning like an idiot, and a wave of aching need clenches a fist around his heart, strong and sudden. He sits in the pilot’s chair, closes his eyes, and tilts his head back to listen to their voices. Already the itch in his skin is receding, soothing away, fading to nothing, his restlessness calming with the voices of his soulmates in his ears.
Clint's still got his hand out, so Tony puts the thirty-seven in it, and watches it disappear into Clint's pocket. “Bagalia is a tough town,” he says, putting his wallet away. “Awful as it is to say, sometimes bad shit happens.”
“Two cars, three in one, four in the other. I’m running low on arrows, dear.”
“Or someone’s trying to kill you,” Clint finishes, then plops carelessly back on his ass, hauling her down to sit beside him with his arm around her shoulder. “This happens every goddamn time, Toni. Vacations, business trips, parties, doesn’t seem to matter. No one has this much shit luck.”
“So you admit it!”
Dammit, he’s not ready yet. Steve sighs and pulls the plug on the sink of soapy water, drying his hands. Not a big deal. This is why he made contingency plans.  “Thanks, JARVIS. Are you able to keep an eye on the kitchen for me? And ask Toni to  come to the courtyard before she comes in through the … hangar? Is that the right word?”
“Nah,” he says, not sure if he actually does or not, but it’s a simple question and he’s determined to answer it himself. “I’m good with juice.”
but all I can think about is how his face looked when he was ripping my armor to pieces around me. I’m trying, Bucky. I’m fucking trying, but I can’t… I can’t figure out how to separate it all out. I don’t know how to fix it.”
It’s like a shot of cold water down his spine. Bucky shudders out a breath, hips jerking slowly. He pulls his head back from Toni and glares. Clint is leaning against the doorjamb, so close he could reach out and touch them if he wanted to. Bucky really doesn’t like the way he’s looking at them. Looking at
Carter’s not looking at her, staring at the pair of DSMR cards in her gloved palm. “Sir, what do you mean, you never authorized an op? Sitwell had the paperw--” Her mouth snaps shut, and she goes sheet-white. “Yes, sir,” she says, very quietly. “Yes, si-
Nine Inch Nails, "We're In This Together"
In another life, Toni might like Sharon Carter. Under the bullshit SHIELD agent persona, she seems friendly and fun. In another life, Toni might even invite her out for drinks, get to know her, probably even take her to bed, because she's got that sense about her, the one Toni's practically attuned to, the one that says
Toni feels the blood drain from her face, and her hand comes up to clutch at her chest. She knows no one can see, but she’s suddenly aware of just how fragile her protection really is. “So what—” She stops, clears the hoarseness out of her throat, and tries again. “What are you suggesting?”
In the silence that follows the smug
“Children,” she says with a tiny, derisive snort, watching Clint slide under an obstacle only to kick it directly into Bucky’s path. Bucky vaults it without missing a beat, but hip-checks the next hard enough to send it sliding at Clint who rolls over it the second it’s close enough. “JARVIS, are Rhodey and Carol ready?”
He closes his eyes, splashes more water on his face, and reaches for the white towel hanging on the rack. The nurse, to check his vitals. “I’ll be out in a moment, ma’am,” he calls. Debates not going out at all, because he doesn’t want more pressure cuffs or questions checking his memory. He doesn’t want the injections Fennhoff prescribed to help with the nausea and the headaches. Doesn’t want more blood drawn.
business.
“It’s your birthday, ma’am,” JARVIS says calmly. "He says he's here to make sure you join the festivities."
Something slams into his chest, solid and warm and real and alive, and everything hurts again.
“None of your business,” she snaps, then instantly regrets it. “You know I do,” she says in a more reasonable tone. “Why do you think I developed the nano mask?” She stops, blinks, tries to cover herself. “Uh, I mean, why do you think Selwyn from Berkeley developed the nano mask?”
He turns fully around, hauls her in by the waist and buries his head in her shoulder, shudders in relief when she loops her arms around his neck. “I’m going to wreck this,” he says into her hair. “Whoever gives out soulmarks really fucked up when they saddled you with me.”
Steve frowns a little. The shield, he thinks, should have been the last thing Toni wants to touch. She had given it sidelong looks full of wariness on the flight to Los Angeles, nervous with its presence until Steve decided to tuck it out of sight. Why would she come into his room to take it now? “Thank you, JARVIS,” he says, deciding to ask Toni herself.
Bucky’s hand is squeezing his leg so hard he’s going to have bruises, and his jaw hurts from clenching it tight. The Asset is whispering around the edges of his mind. This Stane asshole better be dead and burned, or Bucky’s going to track him down and make the last few hours of his life
The last dregs of the insane fury drain away, leaving a hollow, tired feeling behind. She links her fingers over his shoulder, sags a little while she has the time to close her eyes. “I’m so pissed at you,” she says, feels him go tense under her palms. “There are
“She runs two very successful Fortune 500 companies, sir,” Phil feels compelled to point out. “I think she understands the concepts of confidentiality and classified material.”
He sighs, glances over his shoulder at the still-closed door, sensing more than hearing Steve coming up the stairs in search of him. This is a conversation he'd be okay putting off indefinitely, but running from conversations with Steve has never worked out for him.  He waits until the door opens, and meets Steve's startled gaze with a smirk. “Hail Hydra,” he says, and turns back to the sunset.
He laughs, shakily, and even the fact that he’s having an arm soldered to his body one nerve at a time isn’t enough to prevent the soft warmth her words create. “Goddamn, Toni, right there.
“I’m thinking,” Carol says, deadpan. “What’s the pay?”
(She has absolute faith that Clint will be along, because that’s just the kind of guy he is. But if he finds her sitting down on the job and
with this much bullshit floating around in their heads? He grimaces and grinds his fingers into his temples, wishing he could just reach in and claw the pain out. At this point, he thinks, he might swear his allegiance to Hydra just to make it
“I’m going to be hauling that woman out of the rabbit hole for the rest of my goddamn life,” he grumbles under his breath. “Thanks, J.”
The staccato of footsteps coming down the hall turns him around, in time to see Toni emerge from the hallway with a suitcase in hand, tinted glasses pushed carelessly into her hair, looking so young and uncertain Steve has the overwhelming urge to enfold her in his arms and keep her safe from everything he suddenly knows is in her future.
Romanoff had been the worst. She stalked Fitz all day, seeming to pop up to scare the bejesus out of him the second his attention wandered. He’d been a nervous wreck by lunchtime, barely able to get any work done all day, and drained to the point where he’s wondering why he’s even here at all.
“I noticed,” murmurs Coulson.
He puts his head in his hands, breath hissing in and out of his clenched teeth. The rage and betrayal and anger aren’t going away, they’re still surging in his gut, nowhere to go but inward. He’s sick and he’s unstable and he was ready to kill someone who’s been nothing but a friend to him over a goddamn misunderstanding. Toni should have left him in fucking Siberia or, better yet, just put him out of his fucking misery instead of bringing him home and thinking he’s worth saving.
, only to have to rebuild him from the ground fucking up when she gets him home? Why can’t she have like, a cellist or a writer or a guy who’ll sit at home and look after the cats while she’s out conquering the known fucking world? Why does

Toni’s palm is cool and welcome on his forehead. “It’s how I knew you,” she says softly. “I fell out of a tree when I was eight. You caught me.”
Toni’s worked with enough amputees to recognize those signs too.
He dreams in red and gold, in black and silver, in metal and flesh, in wet red blood and glowing blue lines.
like a swarm of bees, and she bites her tongue so hard she tastes a hint of blood.
Frigga had been giving that some thought too, in the moments between consoling her distraught and confused children. “I will train her, far more gently than the Norns would. I have the gift of foresight and prophecy. I can show her how to control it.”
on the denim of his jeans.
Behind them, the quaint picturesque hunting lodge they’d rented for her birthday, cosy and romantic before it was riddled with bullet holes and broken walls and bloodstains, burns to the ground.
The blanket is yanked away. Toni whines and scrabbles for it, but Natasha has her determined face on, and she keeps it from Toni’s fingers. “The first time you go to bed with your soulmate, Antonia,” she says, “you will not smell like you fell into a sewer. And there will be
JARVIS directs Toni back through the hole in the wall and towards the stairs she discovered before the Winter Soldier came out of nowhere to fuck with her day. Said Soldier is now slung unconscious over her shoulder in a fireman’s carry. The elbow joint of the armor is locked into place, keeping him secure. She’s pathetically grateful that she added that feature, because otherwise, she’d be reduced to dragging him along by one foot.
-- and heaves up everything in her stomach.
To think that this is the man who’s going to be dictating the future of the Stark legacy makes Toni want to break something. Preferably his smug, insufferable face.
“How long until Clint and Tash get here?” she asks, and if her voice is flat, well… she doesn’t have the energy to put into locating an appropriate tone either.
“Toni.” He’s on his feet as soon as he sees her, and it’s actually painful to watch his face close off, defensive and dark, hands warding off anything she might say or do. “This wasn’t my idea, okay? I can go.”
She can’t do
? I had it all planned out, you know. We were gonna be ninjas. It was gonna be
“S’alright if I touch you?” Toni asks around another yawn. At his nod, she nudges his arm under her pillow, tucks her head near his shoulder, and settles her hand on his chest, right over his soulmark. “S’okay,” she mumbles, and her eyes slip closed. “Y’won hurt me. S'okay, Buck…” She slips into slumber, still murmuring reassurances.
“J,” she says as she turns away and moves towards the door. “As soon as I’m out, lock it down. Seal everything. I don’t care what it takes, you keep them safe. If it looks like they need it, let them access armory specs and prototypes.”
“It is 12:03pm, ma’am,” JARVIS replies. “I did attempt to alert you to the time, but ma’am muted me for interrupting her

, her voice alone might be his undoing, be enough to break his shaky self-control, all lazy and throaty and practically purring.

Red Star looks past her, looks back to her, and then steps away, turning on his heel and disappearing back down the hall and around the corner. Toni’s legs quit the second he’s gone, and only Clint’s rush forward to catch her saves her from collapsing on the floor.
“I hate you,” she says, pacing furiously.
Toni stills, staring at the hand pressed into the couch in front of her nose. She stays that way for a long, long time, wrestling with what she knows are gigantic trust issues, arguing with the ghost of her mother saying that she is to never tell anyone what marks she carries. Fighting with herself, because as much as she says soulmates are bullshit, she desperately wants to believe in the stories, but can’t because she knows that she’s never going to have any of the fairy tale.
“Technically,” she says, “it’s
“I have to,” Toni says, stops, squeezes her eyes shut and swallows hard. But there’s nothing in her tone to indicate how haunted and desolate her face shows she truly is. “I knew it was always a matter of time before he found you. He has your mark, you have his, and there’s no claim greater than that.” She turns with a smile that looks real but isn’t, and gently lays her free hand on Natasha’s shoulder. “It’s fine, Tash,” she says gently. “You’re good for him. He’s good for you. You deserve each other, and you deserve some privacy. All I want is for you both to be happy and safe. I promise, it’s okay. I’ve got things to take care of in New York anyway.”
. Maybe Toni can help him bridge the past and the present in a way that makes more sense to his poor, addled brain.
— Fall Out Boy, “Immortals”
He blinks, but recovers quickly. “Lola,” he says, figuring he’ll at least follow this line of conversation and see if it turns up anything beneficial. “Fully restored.”
“No,” Schmidt says abruptly, and Steve snaps his mouth shut in surprise. “Stark is not a high priority target at the moment. The Phoenix is a volatile element, Commander. Attacking it, or being perceived to attack it, has grave potential to unravel everything we have worked towards these last few decades. Return your resources to their normal operations and do nothing to threaten the success of our ultimate mission.”
Rhodey pins Toni with a look that promises yelling and recriminations and attempted guilt trips at a later date. She just bares her teeth in a smarmy grin and wiggles her fingers goodbye at him.
“For the last time, Obadiah,” Toni says, without looking up from the sheaf of design specs and technical portfolios Pepper has sent her. “SI is not pursuing, entertaining or accepting any new contracts for weapons from anyone. I don’t care if Captain America himself walked through the door in all his red, white and blue glory, announced the Red Skull was rampaging through Manhattan, and only a Stark missile could put him down. That’s not our business anymore.”
It isn’t actually a pair of eyes, but to an engineer – no, scratch that, a brilliant freaking genius of a mad scientist – like Toni, it’s just as good. She touches the screen as code streams, slows, resolves into a black square fading into six different angles from the cameras installed in the workshop.
Rhodey just gives her a bland grin. “Not at all, Ms. Stark,” he says. “It’s just that Mr. Barton threatened to sink arrows into my testicles if, and I quote, ‘you don’t stick to her closer than a hemorrhoid, Jimbo’. Mr. Barton seemed quite serious in his threat, and I have to protect my future children.”
“I anticipated your request, sir,” JARVIS says, “and have altered our flight path to intercept.”
“JARVIS,” she says, grimaces, pushes a hand against her chest. It hurts to talk. “JARVIS, you there?”
"Raincheck. I’ll take my breakdown later.  We'll trade 'em off. Right now, it's your turn, so shut up and close your eyes already."
Miles. Miles Morales. Standing, terrified but defiant of Ulysses’ visions, on the steps of the Capitol. Steve facing him, with the kind of perfect, patient faith only Captain America can display, confident Ulysses is wrong.
Fennhoff shrugs. “More time would be appreciated, of course, to allow the process to root deeper in his psyche, but I believe the asset is ready to take on short-term, supervised missions.”
This isn’t Toni’s workshop. At least, it isn’t her workshop as he knows it.
about it. I told myself I was imagining things, but now…” He sighs, grimaces. “How certain are you about this Hydra thing, Stark? Where's your intel coming from?”
“It’s something you’ve needed for a long time,” Obadiah says, spinning the ring on his pinkie with his thumb. “Howie might have been too much of a pussy to discipline you, Toni, but I’m not your father. I’m not going to tolerate your smart mouth or your disrespect. You’re a Stark, and you will start acting like a Stark.” The corner of his mouth curls down, the Stane mark of dismissive disdain. “Or you’ll find your monthly allowance cut off pretty damn quick. Howie might have indulged you, Toni, but I’m not paying for your whoring yourself across the world.”
because if JARVIS is saying that in front of Coulson and FitzSimmons when she gave him specific orders to never mention it in front of any eagle-toting agent not Clint or Natasha, it’s infinitely worse than she could expect it to be. “--and there is a file I believe requires your immediate attention.”
She waggles a finger at Helen. “Oh my
Goddammit. Pepper couldn’t make her cry, but JARVIS just might. “Thanks, J. I love you too.” She runs her hands through her hair, making a face at the tangles her fingers catch on. Christ, she’s got to pull herself together and go mingle with a room of superspies and government agents and people with metaphysical connections to her soul, and somehow convince them all that she’s perfectly okay and happy to be amongst them, when all she wants to do is curl up in her bed and sleep for a month.
He leaps towards her, and she blasts upwards by pure rabbit instinct. “Jesus fucking Christ, Steve,” she says, her mouth still running, still on autopilot, because it’s either a steady stream of verbal diarrhea, or endless screaming. “We need to work on your concept of understanding what the fuck I’m saying. Lay off the 'roids, dude. They're obviously damaging your brain. I don’t care what they tell you or how pretty they smile. Hydra doctors are not your friends.”
Sparks fly above her head and the door protests with a violent screech as a metal fist punches in, right where her skull was a second ago. She yelps and fires her jets and stabilizers, shooting her out of the way of her attacker’s follow-up knee strike, down the hall.
he howls, furiously flipping pages. “
even though he wants to.
Tony closes his eyes, hears the sickening impact of the arrow into the back of Banner’s skull again, heroically chokes back the urge to vomit. “No,” he says, strangled. “It wasn’t your fault.”
Anxiety chews on his nerves. Toni’s here.
“Rough day?”
be your soulmate in public. It solves a whole bunch of problems. You look like I’m going to whip out a knife and go American Psycho on you.”
Kobik fades into sight, thin and tiny and chin tipped defiantly at him.
“New assignment, got stationed back here a few months ago,” Coulson says. “I just haven’t had a chance to drop by and say hello.”
, but she’s at the very least content in the moment. “We’re okay,” she says, dragging her fingertips down from his hair, tracing the line of his spine to between his shoulders, and then reversing the motion. It’s a tiny thrill of satisfaction when he leans into it, and she smiles. “You can kiss me again, if you want. I can quite honestly say I’ve never been kissed like that before. S’nice.”
He blinks in surprise. “Oh. Okay then, let me back up.” He opens his mouth, then closes it again. “Actually, let me start with pants.” He fishes around his side of the bed, comes back with his jeans, and slides off the bed to put them on. Toni ignores the way her mouth goes dry even though she privately thinks his ass needs to be registered as a weapon of mass distraction.
Warmth and awareness wash through him, something waking up in alarmed response to his surging, uncontrolled emotions. He’s only peripherally aware of it, but it builds in size and presence, weaving through his rage and smoothing it out, until it’s righteous wrath flaring bright and hot, until he’s burning with the unbearable pressure, until his skin can’t contain any more.
That’s lighting a match to the fucking powderkeg. Clint’ll get popcorn and make suggestions on how to get more creative with bloodspray. Tash will critique my technique as I'm hauling the guts out of whatever fool gets in my way, tell me how to maximize pain and suffering. You... You're the goddamn eye of the hurricane, Coulson.
He finishes with an exhale, the world stills. There’s nothing else but them.
“Ditch this,” Tony reaches over and plucks the condom off Steve’s hand and chucks it off to the side. “You’re a supersoldier,” he pants. “I’m clean, and I’ve been waiting far too
“Thought you just left,” Tony admits quietly, eyes downcast. “That it was just a one night thing.”
He stares at the cornflower blue shirt, wars with himself whether to keep up with the illusion just a little while longer or to push through the pain and just get a new shirt. In the end, his neediness wins out and he shrugs it on. Ignores the slashing in his chest as he breathes in Steve’s scent.
The communal kitchen empties out, leaving only him and Steve as he sits on the stool. There’s a spread of full breakfast on a tray: pancakes, cut up fruit, eggs cooked sunny side up, orange juice, and an extra spot, conveniently sized for a coffee mug.
Tony is no virgin by any means, but Steve feels
“Oh, Tony!” Steve greets. “Good morning,” he hands him a mug of freshly brewed coffee, scent of heavenly ichor pepping Tony right up. Almost like the crisis Steve caused earlier didn’t happen, but only almost. “You’re up early,” Steve notes, pointing a spatula to the kitchen island. “Help yourself,” he urges, and so Tony does.
— “No!” he shakes his head, denies it and will deny it vehemently to the grave. “No, no, I don’t want it to be a one night thing,” he spills out in confession. He’s too tired, too desperate to do anything but take the chance while he has it. “Wouldn’t think of it. Would only stop if you said no. I just thought…”
“Thought?” Steve hums, sliding the bacon next to the eggs before putting the pan back on the range to cool. Tony notices then that there’s another tray across his own holding several wrapped sandwiches and a protein shake, Steve sliding onto the seat in front of that one.
A soft rag presses cold on his skin, he shivers at first contact but it’s welcome respite.
Where Steve is cooking breakfast.
"Do you know what your sin is, Anthony?" Speculum asks, tone curious.
But god, Tony wants
and Tony wants it to happen for-fucking-ever.
"Do you know what your sin is, Anthony?"
He doesn’t want to hurt Tony, not now, not ever again.
“C’mon,” Tony urges. “I can take more than that.” He can, he has, he
He can have this. He can have this.
The world is silent and there is nothing else but this. Nothing else but them and the space in-between.
Tony cranes his neck, flinty eyes reflecting back at him. "I'm a fan of all seven, actually," he says with ease, palm flattening out. That's the thing with these kinds of villains. They only see Tony Stark as vulnerable without his suit. "Right now, though?"
“Alright. I’ll find something for the both of us.”
This chapter is still NSWF! It features nudity, butts, very soft Dom/Sub situation and praise kink UwU Don't watch if it makes you uncomfortable!
“Please,” he begs, shaking his round hips up to meet Steve’s mouth approaching his intimate part. "Please, Mr Rogers."
“A ship with cannon would accomplish the task better. Or a letter from court. That’s my other option.”

Sam rubbed his chin. “Good thing we can move the piano.”
A couple of weeks later, Steve spared no expense in holding a dinner party for all of their friends. Tony’s friends Rhodey and Pepper had come to stay with them for a short while. Steve had been given to understand that Rhodey wanted to confirm that Steve was good for Tony.
The mill owner, Mr. Rumlow, was in his office and he warmly greeted both Sam and Steve. Shaking his hand, Steve immediately could tell Rumlow was one of Those Alphas. Bullheaded in opinion, righteous in attitude, demanding in all his supposed rights as an alpha. Pretty much everything Steve despised in one neat package.

No response.
“Can we put glitter on the hats?”
First Steve was stunned and amazed that he was holding a fairy. Fairies were myths and legends and he’d never heard of anyone who had seen one. This particular fairy was gorgeous in red and gold, coloring that extended to his delicate orange-red wings with black tips.
“I know, mother.” He smiles. “You are my most precious confidant.”
“Yes, Ana!”
This page was harder for me to draw, especially the posings U_U; Tiredness is bad for inspiration. I hope you will still enjoy it :3
He worried about his neighbors. Wealth and fame insulated him very much from criticism and he was well aware that he was an oddity of being both a war hero and a wealthy unmatched omega. Almost fit for a zoo or museum exhibit.
Tony sighed deeply from the depths of anguish. “If I had my workshop, with proper tools and materials, I’d have been done by now and on my way home. But --” he waved dismissively at the items strewn across the table. “It’s going to be a race between if I can finish the signal or my wings heal.”
He stirs two cups of coffee as she bangs around in the fridge, looking for her
“Fuck you,” Toni mutters, and pulls a pillow over her face to muffle Natasha’s fond, but mocking, laugh.
Well, I still live. And so does this fic. Deadlines cannot keep me down!
Fitz exchanges another long, worried look with Jemma. “Is it just me, or does that sound an awful lot like Black Widow is going to jump at us at odd moments?”
Fury turns around, both eyebrows high on his forehead. “
“Huh,” is all Clint says, but he sits rather suddenly and heavily in the chair across from Tony, and holds out his hand, palm up, as he stares off into space. “Guess that would explain it. Shit, that would explain a
“So don’t leave. Stay here. With us. You don’t do well on your own, and it’s going to break something in him that can’t be fixed if you leave.” Natasha takes a step towards, and her mask cracks. “It’ll break something in me too,
He’s expecting anger, he’s expecting guilt, he’s expecting any number of things. What he gets… is quizzical confusion. “Neither? He’s my best friend, you’re my soulmate. There’s no jerking around happening in either direction.”
He dreams of red stars and blue circles and white triangles. He dreams of pain and suffering, terror and rage, despair and emptiness.

We have hair replacement treatments that are so thorough, no one will ever know the difference. Lesson learned, folks: never settle for second best.”
“When have you ever known me to sit still, Cap?” Clint retorts, but gives up on the ridiculous position and, Steve hopes, whatever he’d meant by
Her eyes slide half-closed and her head tilts forward, all of their own volitions, when his thumb starts rubbing circles behind her ear. “You’ve completely ruined the illusion for me here, Steve,” she says, voice more a purr than human words.
part. For some reason, you’re not allowed to call yourself The.” She lifts a hand and holds it out, and he seizes it and shakes it happily. “Call me Toni. You are..?”
“Am I misreading this?” he murmurs.
His stays in the chapel grow longer, and he spends the time between his customary prayer and his eventual departure with his sketchbook in his lap, humming hymns and detailing faces and locations in dark, thick, smudged lines. Sometimes there are other people when he arrives, kneeling or sitting in silence, and he always tenses up, unhappy and disquieted, until he’s certain they’re not there for any reason but their own.
But he snaps back into giving Tony his full attention when Tony says, “That’s why I’m here. I’m trying to understand why this happened,
she admits quietly, and her hands are shaking as she reaches out to clasp Toni’s shoulders. “Please, don’t go. Don’t leave us. I didn’t think I could ever find someone like Clint, and to realize that he is with someone like you… I would count myself very fortunate if you stayed with us, because we are all better with each other than we ever will be alone.”
“As would I, ma’am.” Anyone else would read the AI’s tones as his usual bland, slightly-pleasant manner of speaking, but Toni knows him almost better than she knows herself. Knows he is just as thoroughly upset at she is. “The Mark VII’s fabrication process will finish at approximately the same time as the diagnostic.”
Cheers!
She snarls in frustration and hauls herself off the couch, wants to stop herself from pacing like a caged lion but can’t. “God, what the hell did I ever do to deserve you? Jesus, Rhodey. Periods are like, supposed to be a magic button girls get to press when they want guys to shut up and stop talking. Fuck women’s lib. It ruins everything.”
ever fell out of either side of his mouth.”
“--ky!
Rhodey frowns, clears his throat, swallows, clears his throat again and looks uncomfortable. “Look,” he says. “I’m only gonna ask this once, and then we’ll never speak of it again, alright? I just wanna know if the reason you don’t want to talk about what’s clearly upsetting you is because…” He grimaces. “Am I one of your marks?”
Peggy sits down, folds his hand in both of hers, and he does his best not to yank it out of her grip. “You are Captain America,” she says. “You’re the
“You know what the amazing thing is about the Phoenix Force, Steve?” he asks conversationally, and this time, it’s his grip that’s iron, keeping Steve locked in place, forcing him to his knees, even as Steve bucks and shoves, tries to break free. “It burns away what doesn’t work. It’s a cleansing force, a purifying agent of the universe. I think it’s absolutely fucking hilarious that out of all the people on the planet,
“The power requirements will all but drain the—“
“Yeah, just like we were discussing. Okay, that’s enough business for now. I’m going to go play with my toys”
“Good,” she says, and leans her head into his chest, tucking under his chin. “I’m with you too.”
Steve makes a startled, strangled noise, and Toni’s cackling in delight because she’s taken him by surprise. His spine bows backward, arms pinwheeling, and Toni hastily scissors her ankles apart, rolling away before she gets squashed under a toppling supersoldier.
He holds his right hand up, and she slides the repulsor right over his fingers, adjusting the fit. A little loose, but serviceable. “Max distance, probably twenty feet,” she says, HUD’s warnings getting a little more intense with two more guns spitting bullets at them. “It kicks like a drunk mule. Point four seconds between shots, point six delay in firing response off the gauntlet. Squeeze in towards your index finger with your thumb to fire.”
Odin stroked his beard, and Frigga’s hopes brightened a little, for that meant he was at least giving it serious thought, and the battle she had expected to fight on her daughter’s behalf was already all but won. “The idea has merit,” he said slowly, thoughtfully, “but—”
There's a single heartbeat in their chests and they breathe with synchronized inhales, in silence and stillness, and watch the night give way to the dawn.
“Well, Howard didn’t exactly have the permission of the Wakandan government to play around with their sacred metals,” Toni says, reaching out in an unspoken request for the shield.
His head spins and the world crumbles around him. “You’re my what?”
Whookay. This one's a monster. It's actually only half the chapter I originally intended it to be, because Things Happened, and they happened with a lot of words.
Steve’s never liked being sick, has to hate it now, since Erskine’s experiment was supposed to cure him of ever getting sick again. He should go in, sit with him while he’s awake and more-or-less lucid.
“Not in twenty minutes, they can’t. Goddammit.” This time, she does thunk her head against the wall, very gently. “Do you have eyes inside here, J?”

Bucky shrugs, lets his back hit the hallway wall and crosses his arms. “It isn't about me,” he says. “But even if it was? Yeah. It sits just fine.”
“Oh, thank Christ and all the saints,” Rhodey says with real, palpable relief, sinking back against the couch and scrubbing his face with both hands. “I love you, Tones, I do, but the thought of being your soulmate scares the piss out of me.”
“STEEEEEEEEEVE,” Peter yelled as he cannonballed into the pool.
Now it’s time to see if the waters are inviting or if he has to leave them for good.
“I’m not the alpha for Steve,” Natasha said and Tony wondered if he heard a touch of regret in her voice.
Tony looked stricken and Steve knew then that he wasn’t even supposed to see Tony before Tony left. “I see,” Steve said tightly. “You are always welcome here, Tony. I should attend to the cleaning downstairs.”
There was a brief break in the music as dancers set up for the next round. Tony pushed through the crush, aiming towards Steve. Steve was graciously greeting and nodding to his neighbors, enjoying their rave compliments on his house, renovations, gardens, food and the ball.
notice that I Prince Charming’ed your ass, right?”
“Good,” Toni replies. “Cos I’m sure as shit not either.” She bends her knees, shifts her feet again, and brings her hands up in loosely-curled fists. “Just please keep in mind that I’m a plain old vanilla, boring-ass human being, not a supersoldier, huh?”
The Phoenix is on him faster than he can blink, and
Natasha’s eyes flick between Toni’s for a moment, and Steve takes a step towards them, because they both look so heartbroken behind their masks he feels like he has to do
It’s so
Damn lump is practically choking her now. “Jesus, Carol,” she says, thickly. “Why would you--”
Now that it's out of his mouth, it once again occurs to him how fucked up and strange their lives are that either scenario is counted as plausible at all, let alone which is
The agent hurries away, and Steve flips through the screenshots on the tablet again, forehead furrowed in thought. In hindsight, he should have expected something like this to happen. Tony’s nothing if not resourceful, even when he has no resources to draw from.
“Extraction. A ride home. Medical attention. A goddamn cheeseburger. A shower. In that order.” Her firm tone fades. “Come get me, Clint?” she pleads.
“Never suffers. Why?”
. Between the new designs she sends down the pipeline into prototyping, and the long hours spent with Pepper planning the expansion into three new states, Toni doesn’t have time to take off to have a kid. She doesn’t have time to spend with a kid. She doesn’t even know if she wants to have one
If she wasn’t so scary fucking powerful and more than a little unhinged, Tony would be utterly charmed by how adorable she is with her face scrunched up like that. “I’m not going to fight you, kid.”
What you need
“That’s because spoiled, pampered Americans can’t handle how hard we Russians party,” Natasha says, sliding her legs under her and pressing two fingers to the inside of Toni’s wrist, head bent in concentration over the watch on her other wrist. “Not our fault you’re a wuss. Next time, go to France. I hear even their neofascist secret Nazi bases have feather mattresses and bidets.”
Metal slides against metal, gears whir and lock, and Toni is completely engulfed. The Mark VIII armor, fresh off the fabricator, is her best work to date, and there’s something indescribably
knows with the thinnest thread of restraint she has left that she’s going to do something she’s going to deeply, deeply regret when this is all over.
Steve sighs, rubs his face tiredly, and sits down on the edge of the hospital bed, staring at his reflection. Three days after waking from a coma, and he’s still just as lost and confused as he was the moment he opened his eyes. He tries to connect to what Peggy describes is their life, their experiences, but he doesn’t connect to any of it. Dr. Fennhoff tells him it’s a lingering aftereffect of the coma, warns that he may never recover his memories but he should still try. Tells him to look at the documents Peggy’s brought from their home, look at the service records Dr. Fennhoff retrieved from SHIELD, for whom he apparently works. Look at the footage of him fighting Iron Man in a secure base somewhere, even though it’s grainy and blurry and in black-and-white, terrible quality that keeps jumping around and going staticky, and he’d be hard pressed to say the one not in armor is him.
Because he certainly would never picture Steve sans uniform shirt, with a goddamn Hydra logo painted in black on his bare chest, kneeling in subservience to the fucking Red Skull.
The scent of gun oil and, crazily, vanilla shampoo hits her nose, and it opens her lungs wider than menthol would have, and she sucks in a desperate, deep breath despite the agony in her ribs. “You’re not alone, dumbass,” another voice says with a warmth she’s only heard in her dreams. “You’re never alone. We’re here.”
Some time later, she stirs from sleep. She’s not awake enough to really know where she is or what woke her, but she’s warm and content, and has a man wrapped around her. Her nose is buried in the crook of his neck, breathing his scent. His cheek is against her temple, his breath in her ear. Her legs are tangled with his, and there’s an arm curled around her hips She makes a contented noise, burrows back into the warmth of his neck, and descends back into sleep.
“Many things are true,” Tony replies as pleasantly as he can through gritted teeth. “Might I inquire which of these things you could possibly be referencing?”
[Go listen to it, if you can. It's absolutely gorgeous.]
Toni swallows the lump in her throat. “Where is he?” she asks, and hates how small she sounds.
“Probably.” An utterly ridiculous grin is curving its way onto his face, but Bucky can’t really find it in himself to give a damn. He shifts his hands up her back, threads his fingers deep in Toni’s hair and listens to the pleased purr rumble out of her throat. “So. Last day of vacation. Whatcha wanna do, doll?”
Gradually, she realizes that Clint has gone silent. She turns to look at him, and he is staring at her with naked fear. “What if she dies, Nat? What if we get there, and we’re too late? What if--”
The door opens and a woman in white comes through with a syringe in hand. His legs push, and he launches across the room in a single jump. He shoves the woman roughly out of the way. She bounces off the door and sprawls onto the floor, crying out in shock. He doesn’t pay her any attention. He’s already past her.
he’s not misreading the pointed look Clint shoots at his groin, and the vein throbs just a little faster. “--you’d love to get her--”
“Yep. We’re good.” He rises to his full height, and Toni’s breath catches in her throat, because Steve Rogers is who she dropped to the floor, but Steve Rogers is not who gets back up. He’s minus the shield, minus the uniform, minus the cowl, but there’s a set of his shoulders, a look in his eyes, something about the way he holds himself… There is absolutely no doubt in Toni’s mind that this is Captain America in front of her now.
Steve tenses for just a second, but it’s there and gone in a flash. Toni smiles to herself; they’re both getting better at coping and adjusting. “You redesigned the whole thing,” he says, resuming his efforts to make her melt into a puddle inside the armor. “It’s different, the contours, the material. I can tell. Plus,” and she can hear the wry grin in his tone, “it helps that it’s painted with my mark.”
you?” he snarls. “Everything’s a fight. Everything’s your way or no way. Someone needs to haul that stick out of your ass before it becomes the pike displaying your goddamn head to the barbarians at the gates, Danvers.”

“Finish each other’s thoughts,” Fitz adds.
, that wasn’t called for.”
Carol grins cheekily and tosses a kernel of popcorn in the air, catching it in her mouth. “You’re only saying that because you lost.”
Steve’s silent for a long time, and Tony watches him out of the corner of his eye, heart in his throat, waiting for Steve to angrily deny it all. But all Steve does is lean on the rail with his elbows, hands folded over each other in front of him, chewing on the corner of his lip as he stares off into the distance. Tony doesn’t need any of his telepathy to know what’s going through Steve’s mind either, and the corners of his mouth tilt hesitantly up.
She impacts off the corner of an intersecting hallway, and winces as she feels the armor crunch, hard enough to squeeze the air out of her lungs. Her HUD careens wildly, screeching information, threat assessments, searching for targets, calculating damage reports. “Stealth mode,” she wheezes, spots dancing before her eyes.
“Sister Margaret?” Steve says with a tentative smile. “Like that?”
“Captain Rogers returned to the mansion approximately thirty minutes ago. Drones are launching from the Aerie now, ma’am. Intercept time is estimated to be two minutes.”
She grabs the shield and yanks it out of the wall. “Catch me if you can!” she tosses through the hole in the wall, through which she can hear Steve picking himself up. Flicks the edge of the vibranium shield with her finger, just to make it ring, just to piss him off. “Ever play monkey in the middle?” His return, wordless roar sends her rocketing down the hall, carrying Steve's shield with her.
Toni swings back and forth on her chair impatiently, drumming her fingers in a rapid staccato while the system goes through its reboot. Everything is checking out so far, everything is just goddamn
“You’re a cruel man and I regret my decision to employ you,” she grouses as she pads back to the center of the mats and takes the loose, defensive stance he’s spent weeks drilling into her.
She hides her sketchbooks and her loose, wild scribbles in a waterproof bag in the hollow of a tree, twenty feet off the ground. It’s a sturdy tree, and she’s a sure climber. She ignores the faint, distant calls of her full name, and pulls herself up one branch at a time until she’s hidden in the branches and pulling her designs out of their protective satchel.
Natasha tightens her grip in his hair, then relaxes her fingers with effort. Her hands do not shake. They are steady as stones. “She won’t, because Toni is resourceful and smart, and despite her breathtaking lack of self-preservation, she knows how to take care of herself,” she says with firm assurance, and meets his eyes. “But if she dies, if we’re too late, we burn the world until all those responsible are ash and dust.”
all the time,” Toni says miserably, swiping her eyes with her wrist. “I can feel it, and it gets stronger when he looks at me. And I know he’s not angry with
The next text takes so long in coming Tony assumes the conversation is done and has finally poured his smoothie into his travel mug to take into the office with him.
Steve frowns at that. He knows Toni’s had some close calls, but the way Hogan says it makes it seem like there’s more than just the handful of incidents he’s heard of. “That usually a concern, keeping her safe?”
“Wasn’t it?” Pepper continues, relentless. “You’ve been nearly killed four times by my count in the last four months, and I know they weren’t in their right minds at the time, but they’re
“Yeah well, I was wrong,” Tony says, and swallows hard. Pulls back into the relative silence of his own brain. “It wasn’t your fault.”
“Active-duty Avengers receive seventy-two hours minimum when new soulbonds are formed,” Coulson explains, and pulls a thin pamphlet from his folder. He unfolds it, pulls a pen out of his inner pocket and presents both to Bucky. “Sign at the bottom, please. You’re on leave starting now.”
Rhodey gives her a slow, one-arm squeeze. “Selwyn from Berkeley developed the nano mask so Toni Stark didn’t have the patent and design stolen by her father,” he says gently. “I still don’t know why you’d want to hide your marks.” She side-eyes him. He shakes his head and grins. “C’mon, Tones. I may not be a child prodigy with an intellect approaching Einstein’s…”
to his room instead of sitting in a chair with people who he’s pretty sure hate him.
she retorts, and sticks her tongue out at Tony as she flashes her hands into the air, sending blue sparks everywhere.
“Yep,” she says when she can breathe again.
She tips the envelope over the floor beside them. Documents and plastic rectangles and smaller envelopes spill onto the floor, accompanied by the more solid thump of a worn leather wallet and the jingle of metal keys. His own face stares up at him under the glossy shine on a New York state driver’s license, half hiding the top formal script of a Record of Birth. A new StarkPhone, this one with a red and silver star on the back of the sleek, black case.
It registers long before he’s awake, and he thrashes to consciousness in blind panic. His hands sweep, and sweep, catching on tubes and wires as he kicks against the thing choking and tangling around him. His arms twinge, tape rips off, sharp pain in his elbow and wrist and the back of his hand.
She drops to her knees, pulls up the access panel and drops into it, letting out an involuntary squeal at the sudden crash of the shield against the door. “I’m in a goddamn horror movie,” she says, feeling the urge to laugh wildly and just barely restraining it. If she starts, she’s not going to stop.
Bucky’s right, of course. Steve’s halfway there already, but he has a head start. He’s
He barely recognizes his own voice when it snarls out of him, “Maybe Clint can come fuck it better.”
Nothing makes sense. Nothing sounds familiar.
her that running off without a plan was suicide.”
Toni smiles a crooked, fond smile. “I doubt the Air Force is going to just send you two on your merry without a whisper of protest. They don’t like me, and they’re not going to like this one little bit.”
Bucky sits the fuck down, right next to Steve, who’s holding his bleeding face with one broad hand, eyes wide and shocked above the line of his fingers.
”Thanks, J. Appreciate the updates.” She slicks her hair back from her face, and reaches up to adjust the shower head to it’s hard massage setting, jacks the faucet left until the water is almost hotter than she can stand. She slumps under the spray, head bowed forward, and groans in sheer bliss as the scalding pulses pound the knots out of her neck and shoulders.
“Love you too,” she replies softly, and the connection cuts. With a too-loud groan of too-much effort, she forces herself back to her feet, wobbles until she finds her balance. “JARVIS, status?”
the fuck ahead,” Toni snarls. “You think I need Fury’s floating fortress of feds to keep SI going? Newsflash, sweetheart. My life would be a lot less fucking stressful without all the secret agents I have constantly crawling into my ass. I am the top name of my fucking industries, Carter. I don’t
Yeah, she’s forgiven.
Steve leans forward, all but off his chair, looking over the rail at Doctor Cho moving around Toni, ashen and still unconscious, adjusting leads and electrodes with delicate precision. His whole body is thrumming with tension, and a muscle in his jaw keeps jumping.
give you data.”
If a herd of wildebeest suddenly stampeded through the lab, Toni would eat six of them raw, horns and hooves and all. “Is that what that is? I thought it was a black hole in my stomach.”
at his plight. “No, Tony, I—“ he shakes his head, instead choosing to show what he means, the hand on his thigh skipping introductions and circles around his neglected cock. “Want you to come ‘fore me,” he explains, smile dazzling and bright like he’s the sun and Tony is far, far gone for this man.
Steve is everything. Steve is leaning his face into the crook of Tony’s neck, at the join where it meets his shoulder. He wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, strong and unyielding and protective. Steve noses a spot before pressing a warm kiss there, tender and so unlike what Tony’s always known. A tear escapes Tony’s eye, as he buries his face in Steve’s hair.
Tony thinks helplessly.
much.
“The time is 7:12 AM,” JARVIS announces. At least there’s someone here who will stay, has stayed. “Might I suggest getting breakfast from the communal kitchens, sir?”
“Oh,” he breathes out, reaching out to touch, moving his hand on top of Steve’s. “Okay. Sounds good.”
“Tony,” Steve breathes out his name, like a lifeline, like a prayer, like a person coming undone.
"What does it matter? I'm adopted."
Tony rolls over, groans in protest as twinges of pain shoot up his back, up his spine.
The evening is warm but with a fresh, gentle breeze accompanying them, so they’re not suffocating like during the past two days. Tony is mystified by how Steve is gentle and fun during their game. He keeps smiling and even shows Tony the cards he drew and added to make the game even more hilarious to play. Tony feels grateful his friends are not there so he can share such a nice moment with him. They’re completely relaxed with each other.

He had his breakfast with Tony first and he eagerly set down the tray, expecting Tony to summon him to bring Tony to the table.
-There is a sexual fantasy standing place for one of the main characters.
“I'm sick of London, Bucky.”
“Oomph!”
Tony and Steve have some sweet fun together, feeling more at ease. Steve is taking charge in a surprising way UwU <3
