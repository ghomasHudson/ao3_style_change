And Tony leant up and kissed him again before he could even finish making his point.
Tonight was exactly perfect, just the way it was… And Steve didn’t want to risk the story of it, on a gesture that might well blow up in his face.
And then pushed himself up onto his feet-
“Trying to save it,” Nick’s voice echoed somewhere in the distance, as Steve’s eyes were drawn deeper into that eerie, ethereal blue…
“Well, among the many things that Bulsara is famous for, is the fact that it cultivates a diverse range of plant life - most of which are used in medicine and food production,” Scaramouche explained, “but, perhaps the most famous are the plants with recreational, and inebriating qualities-”
The memory of Tony’s beautiful body pressed close against him.

intending to at least pay attention to where they were going. If there was nothing else he could do, he could gather some intelligence - which was really just an attempt to control of his rapidly escalating temper-
“Of course I forgive you.” Tony whispered, like it had been a silly question – which, okay, was a bit rich, given what Tony had been thinking a week ago… But it did seem like a silly question, now. “And… honestly, I kind of know there’s no point in me asking whether you forgive me…” Which Steve answered with a little laugh,

He could acknowledge that his priority now - his

“What did you expect it to taste of?” She asked, a teasing lilt to her voice.
His head felt so thick and sluggish, his whole body still weighted down with the remains of sleep. It seemed to take forever for his vision to clear. When he eventually forced himself out of bed, everything felt restricted and heavy and so much more effort…
It might burden Tony. It might lead him to questions that he never wanted to ask, and anxieties that he never would have faced.
Steve made his shallow breathing obvious. He hissed painfully, swallowed hard, twisted his features into a grimace-
“Up,” he commanded, simply. Steve’s shoulders tensed instantly, his arms scrambling to comply before he’d translated the word. Tony snaked one arm beneath him, lifting into a sitting position in one strong motion. Steve’s stomach dipped, like he was at the crest of a rollercoaster. He was still righting himself when he felt Tony hand curl over his arm, secure and protective-
Or, at least, Steve was excited at the prospect of a second chance. And he was
their interactions – even the good ones. Tony couldn’t help but recognise that this was definitely a goal for Steve, that he’d successfully disarmed one of Tony’s potential arguments against him… That he was still counting points.

For all his three-day work marathons and week-long benders, Tony still felt a pang of shame at this point in the morning. A wordless feeling that he

And in the end, he gave up and just kissed Tony again.
There, that was that decision made.
But, for just a moment, Tony had stopped listening to it.
There was just so

The glasses hit the bar with too aggressive a bump.
“Okay, just tell me this,” Bucky suggested, after a moment. “You know the first time you spoke to Peggy, when you came out with that stuff out about not expecting a beautiful dame to join the army or whatever – was it worse than that?” And Steve groaned, and threw one arm over his face.
…And he thought of Tony, in the nano-tech armour. The way it melted around his body, even as Tony moved-
…And that was obviously what JARVIS was asking him for.
Oh, Steve liked that too.
He couldn’t do anything, while Adam had that phone in his hand-
He deliberately turned away from Steve to open the case, and took a few seconds longer than was strictly necessary to open up all the files - just taking a little reprieve from the intensity of it all, before he reset himself.
And that laughter just casually carried on, a low, simmering rhythm of giggles, as Tony fought his way back to the surface again - and exaggerated incredulity on his face.
Tony had never known such horrible, suffocating emptiness.
“Yeah, sorry - it’s just been a rough couple of days, that’s all,” she sighed, and managed an appeasing smile for him-
, Tony forced himself up. He snatched Steve’s hand out of the way, barely giving him a second to process what was going on before Tony had shifted-

“How do you know?” Tony asked, like he was curious.

He’d not considered that he might really fall for him, that he’d...
…That couldn’t be right.
of those perils first, I guess it makes sense to start with the one that’s already happening. If Hydra are out there torturing Bucky and killing innocent people and fucking the whole world up, right now, as we speak, then I guess we deal with that before we deal with the… aliens, who aren’t here yet. And, yeah, if you don’t want to work with me, or if you’re dead set on doing things your own way, then fine - it’s none of my business, and I’m not going to try and stop you. But you’re not the Captain of me, and you’re not going to stop me, either…”
“We don’t know yet,” Tony answered honestly.
And, he could ignore the fact that it was a sad way to think.
The more that Bucky had come into the world, the more horrors he’d found in his head. Some minutes were worse than others. Sometimes there were spikes of white hot rage that seemed to come from nowhere, that cut open deep stores of resentment and injustice that it would then take him hours to silence. Sometimes that queasy anxiety would flash up into an all-out panic that he felt sure at the time would kill him. There were times when he couldn’t stop those memories from replaying over and over in his head.
And then, the specific choice of argument, the flow of words and the internal logic that led you to believe he’d really thought about this – that, underneath his likeable egotism, there was almost certainly a competence and a desire to do good…
And, just as Steve stepped forward to kick him again, there was another hydraulic hiss – directly above them, this time.
have greatly eased the background tension he usually felt during these meet-ups-
But that didn’t seem like the important bit, right now.
And Tony would’ve liked to analyse the science of that. It might’ve helped to analyse the sociology or morality of it, if only so that he could answer her. He would’ve liked himself more, if he’d been immediately repulsed to hear this coloniser and slave driver call a conquered land by a new name. This would have been a good moment to remember the importance of what they were doing, the relative insignificance of anything else that was going on.
attracted to him, and nothing can happen – I mean, we’re in the middle of why a simple conversation can’t happen, so obviously nothing more can happen – and that’s not going to be fun, is it? For either of us, probably…” He just trailed off, exhausted by the whole thing.
“Welcome home, Sir,” JARVIS greeted him - with a subtle edge of warning on his voice, that only Tony could possibly have picked up on.
“But, I don’t know, it’s still probably better if I keep it to as few people as possible.” Tony shrugged – which wasn’t a lie, either. “Especially if he’s going to just stand there-”
balancing out the morality of this, for no other reason than he wanted to – Oh, God, he couldn’t tell Tony that.
And he
“Like what?” Tony asked, kindly. And Steve found himself taking a little breath before he answered… because it

“I know what you risked, to help me. I know what you went through.”

his newfound certainty that there was nothing wrong about Steve.
“I… Can’t,” Steve surrendered. “I mean, I just, I can’t take you to that bunker. I know we talked about this, and I know I said... but, I just… This is different. I can try to explain it, I can try to talk about it, but… This one I have to do on my own…”
And it was hard,
“No,” Tony shook his head, fighting the oddest urge to laugh, “no, not really.”
Tony looked down at the case, still swaying innocently in his hand. Suddenly, it felt so much heavier…
think about all the things they’d already achieved…
And Tony began fucking him hard and fast, his thrusts more sharp and shallow – hitting that spot every time, sending shock after shock through him until it was all just one continuous rolling sensation. Steve’s mind whited out completely, his shouts dissolving into choked off moans as his entire body surrendered to the pleasure running through it. His cock pulsed angrily against his stomach, the stinging, burning need of it just adding to this onslaught of sensations.
close to Steve. Feeling this connection in such a pure form, separate from all the background noise of human life…
“And that’s, what, a different planet to earth?” Tony pressed.
“12:51, sir,” JARVIS replied cheerfully.
There was a large, square living area, with a cream coloured carpet that was so thick it bounced to walk on it. There were three huge couches, and Steve had no idea what fabric they were covered with, but it was so luxurious that a shiver ran up his spine when he touched it. The bathroom was bigger than Steve’s apartment. He only glanced into the one bedroom, but he was pleased to see that the bed was roughly the size of a parade float…not that it should matter, he reminded himself, as he fully intended to sleep on the couch.
All because he knew he couldn’t move him.

“...No,” Steve realised aloud. “I guess… I don’t know, maybe I didn’t want to tread on your toes, or something?” He narrowed his eyes, not entirely sure himself what he was trying to say…

He saw Tony swallow down his anger, and look back at him…
“Anni-Vara is a small planet, and not densely populated – but there are other cities, and people have tried to come to our aid. The same thing happens to all of them. And everyone in this city would’ve risen up, fought back, if we could – but it’s happening to all of us, too. The Adams put their own chemicals in the water and in the air, and they effect our physiology more than yours. It keeps us passive, and confused, and tired. I’m one of our senior chemists, and I take what I can get away with to counteract it, as best I can think to, not knowing what they give us… but it’s not enough. Groups have tried to gather a resistance, but they all come to nothing. Everyone is too tired, too distracted, too sad. And, if ever we did – when the armies of other cities come – the Adams can put thousands of us down with a single burst of gas. A cloud that puts us all to sleep, of leaves us all in blinding pain, and has no effect whatsoever on them. There’s nothing we can do.”

That was another way to look at it, right? That, actually, indulging this sudden, irrational, out of character impulse was likely to
Yeah, he was pretty sure that wasn’t right. He couldn’t see Sam endorsing that.
This was an old man, his hair cut in a style that hadn’t existed in the forties, his features worn and somehow crueller...
“And, you know how, you really don’t blame me for finding it hard to apologise… But you still know I have to?” Steve added… And Tony had clearly recognised the tone Steve was using, the fact that he was building to something here… so, he stilled just slightly, and he simply nodded, and waited.

And when he first stepped out of that container, feeling like he was walking on stilts and not knowing where his limbs ended and worried he might be dying because it felt so strange to
hurt by what he did…
This was the first page that Steve had felt genuinely invested in since he first opened the folder.
“I, uh, I
Steve remembered that he’d already felt guilty for ignoring Bucky. He’d been thinking that he’d have to explain
And he knew he couldn’t go in cold. He couldn’t spontaneously apologise for a general feeling in his gut, without really knowing how Tony felt, when Tony had already said they should just ignore it and move on – but, maybe if Tony yelled at him, he could actually just apologise…for everything…
Oh, God, Steve wasn’t sure that he could trust himself not to abuse that.
Steve had curled up under the covers, and squeezed his eyes shut, and willed his body to give into fatigue… But his mind had carried on bouncing around the inside of his skull like a ping pong ball, jumping from one thought to the next without any obvious connection.
isn’t about me wanting to control other people - it really isn’t,” Steve assured him. “I don’t want to be part of any team with the power to dictate policy to other people, I don’t want to make the world work a certain way… it’s just that I don’t want to give anyone power over us, either. And I do want to be able to intervene, to stand up for
, then maybe they could get a starting point. Access to a central computer system, some indication of who were the important players, an idea of which parts of the city were draining the power source… Maybe even a better idea of what sort of place this really was.
Everything seemed to flow through him so much more easily now, quicker and smoother and…more…
He huffed a surprised laugh at himself, as he blinked the last of his tears away and took a good look around him…
just fell out of Tony’s mouth.
Maybe it was simply that it was familiar. In a world where everything was strange and wrong and required conscious thought, the confines of the war room provided a perverse sort of safe haven. Seventy years hadn’t changed nearly as much about how all this worked as they had everything else. If it weren’t for the holograms that Tony insisted on using at every opportunity, this could have been one of the strategy meetings that the Commandos had been called to in Washington.

He had been expecting to find something out of place. Something unfamiliar, and, well… alien.

It lingered longer, this time. Without an immediate task to push ahead to, Steve found himself getting snagged on those particular memories. There was finally room for a few actual thoughts to speak up-
all the thoughts in his head were so wonderful.
“Ahreddan was a code word for Operation Rebirth?” Tony clarified, a different kind of curiosity flickering behind his eyes. “...But that’s got to be a coincidence, right?” He murmured, almost to himself. And then he looked back at Steve, and asked more directly, “
His desperation to see Tony grew ever sharper, as Steve struggled with the impossible fear of losing him.

A younger version of Tony would probably have thought it very sad that he was going to spend his birthday alone in a hotel room. He wouldn’t have guessed that one day he’d be making considerable efforts just to be
, and I know I’ve been… ignoring everything, and… selfish.” Steve recognised, as he said it. And Bucky rolled his eyes, but Steve pressed on with it. “I know a lot’s going on with you right now, and you probably feel like I haven’t even noticed. And I know I’m asking for a lot, and not even telling you what it’s about. And… I just want you to know, whatever…
And Steve wondered why Tony was still explaining this theory, when Steve had just said he accepted it… and he realised, it was because Tony just hadn’t expected Steve to trust him. He’d prepared all this evidence and all these arguments, because he’d
“Why, who's following you?” He demanded protectively, stepping forward to put a hand on Tony’s arm. Tony’s fraught expression softened briefly, the hint of a smile threatening to break through… And then he gave his head a little shake, and deliberately straightened his back.

“No, it’s okay, it’s…”
And then, when he’d opened it, Steve just casually took it from him. Tony saw Steve set his jaw, before he pulled out a single sheet of paper. Bracing the same way Tony had.

Now, it was just a case of waiting for it to arrive.
When he turned back to at the others they were all looking at him with the same interested frown.
And then Steve saw the more serious tone pinch at Tony’s smile, his eyes softening into a different sort of kindness - the kind you use to deliver bad news.
“Okay, Steve, you know what-” Sam tried more forcefully, to no avail.

And all the other little gripes he might’ve had, all the arguments he might still think he was right about – all the things he knew he’d have overcome just as easily, or had already changed his mind about, or didn’t care about anymore – just fell by the wayside. He didn’t even get a chance to tick them off, because he’d remembered why none of that mattered.
And Steve had

with Obie, and pain, and fear… and shame. To hear them again now, even in his head, was an immediate trigger of alarm and distress – before he could think what any one of them meant.
Of course, he had no hope of processing a revelation that huge right now – he had far, far too many things to be happy about first, before he could think about that… But he felt it. He understood everything it made better, everything it meant…

Would he have to rethink his grievances against Nat, in light of all these revelations? And Sam? And Wanda and Clint and Scott?
It was a ridiculous impulse, and probably a waste of valuable time, but Steve decided to indulge his anger for just a second longer before he got to work. He took the folder marked

He could package that whole thing up as something he didn’t understand, something he could simply assume worked in a reality different to his own - he could take as a given that Quill’s father knew what he was, and that it probably made sense to him, and that it had nothing to do with the world as Steve knew it.

He glanced up at Gary again, even though he knew it was too early to move. He clenched his jaw very gently against the build-up of tension, and breathed through the beginnings of a fluttering in his chest-
“But no, I just finished a meeting,” Tony carried on breezily. “Made the mistake of ‘quickly’ checking my email before I left the room.”
And then there was a pregnant pause, as Tony willed himself to push ahead with it. Trying to think of something he could add that would sound final, some way to ease them towards that conclusion. Dismissing all the options, because none of them sounded right…
Of course, as soon as they arrived at the Princess Aura Folk Dancing Competition, Tony had started to think they should’ve perhaps been a

Most of them were still just confusing and vaguely unsettling, at this stage. The practical issues of trying to translate texts from medieval languages, when the ‘correct’ translation would probably sound ludicrous anyway. The frustration of finding pages that referenced the earth’s rotation around the sun, or the curative power of leeches – and made Tony feel completely ridiculous for actually studying them. The way that creepy words or graphic descriptions could come at him seemingly from nowhere, turning an otherwise dry text into something frightening or embarrassing or eerie.

The moments between the building and the car seemed to melt past him – like when he read a whole page of text without taking any of it in. He vaguely knew to be relieved that the Avengers were mostly preoccupied with the hordes of fleeing employees. He hadn’t had to make much in the way of conversation…

How to explain this strange, almost pleasant reluctance to finally do the thing he’d waited so long for, and wanted so much… Just because, once he had, this incredible, magical, life-changing moment would be over.
Steve parted his lips, the moment Tony kissed him.
There was a smattering of applause that felt strangely… distant. Like he was hearing it from inside a bubble. It felt slower. Everything felt slower.
“I’m going to order us some food then.” He announced, wearily. “Wouldn’t want to be late for Assembly.”
And as he was talking, he could feel Tony’s back getting stiffer – until, eventually, he sat up, his eyes still fixed on Steve. Like he was being drawn into what Steve was saying. And Steve felt the slightest flutter of the old anxiety then… a worry that he was about to say something wrong, a memory of that instinct to shut up…
And, honestly – it was just too far away.
it… That he’d wasted all this time trying to prove to himself what he already knew.
…Steve.
Oh, Tony wanted to kiss Steve’s neck
He’d been so sure that he was going to be angry at Nick forever - that no amount of time would diminish the hurt Nick had caused him, or the wrong he’d objectively done… But Tony couldn’t deny, now that someone had actually done something about it, he was so much less bitter. He didn’t like Fury any more than he had, he didn’t think his actions were any more understandable. But the spite wasn’t there anymore.
And then Steve grabbed him by the hips, lifting him, or carrying him –
Somewhere, that enlightenment had already started to form…

Tony grinned again and shook his head, before stepping forward to fall in line with Steve, so that they could leave side by side.
What if…
“Okay,” Bucky breathed, subtly bracing his back.

“This planet is really called Anni-Vara – which all of the Adams can pronounce, quite easily, and yet they chose to give it a name of their own…” A sadness passed over her face, her eyes losing focus for a second as she remembered something she wasn’t going to share… and then she blinked, and carried on. “It wasn’t like this, before they came here. Anni-Vara has a unique eco-system, and the people here have been using it to make medicines for the body and soul for thousands of years. Generations trained to respect the things they made, and the elements they made them from – and the good they could do. People would travel from every planet in this system to heal here. It was a spiritual place. People would go to our woods and smoke our herbal mixes, and meditate. Sick people would come to bathe in the lakes, to be restored. And yes, couples would come here and take our serums and it would help them to connect, and talk, and feel – but not like this.” And she scrunched up her face, to show her distaste, before she carried on.
that it stopped Tony in his tracks.
Well, that’s how it felt in the moment, anyway.
At last, as Tony let go of
Even when Tony dropped his head to pepper soft kisses along his neck, his hands still stroking gently over Steve’s skin. Steve groaned, and bucked his hips, and

He found himself thinking back to the dream, so sure he’d remember it – it felt so real, and vivid, and recent…
He sat himself up abruptly, and pressed the elevator call button again. The doors slid open immediately.
...He was always thinking ahead to how things might sound, and how much he might let slip, and how he was going to deal with the
The relief rolled through Steve’s body like a wave of heat, the tension melting away from his joints so rapidly that he felt unsteady on his feet.

“Is just one issue that complicates this a bit, yeah” Tony agreed, unhappily “And what the relationship is between these two groups – I mean, there
“Scaramouche?” Tony clarified. And then, when the officer nodded, he turned to Sam and Bucky and said, completely seriously, “we could just stay in jail.”
But he didn’t say anything.
In fact, belatedly, he recognised exactly what he was doing – and how childish, and unhelpful, it was. He couldn’t commit to being angry with Steve enough to argue with him, and he couldn’t commit to liking Steve enough to just go with the moment… so he’d gone for the middle ground, and jabbed at him. And it was completely unnecessary, especially as Steve was drunk, and that wasn’t even his fault.

Which wasn’t even Steve’s idea in the first place.
“What –

He knew those words were powerful, significant words. Words he would only have one chance to say for the first time-
“How much can we find out from that?” Steve gestured to the file reader.
That same voice, that wasn’t really a voice at all. That
And Bucky felt another pleasant sensation - something else that was happening more and more, as time went on-
Sinking down onto Steve’s cock

back here again…
An expression he’d never seen before….
“Oh, uh, something about a security clearance glitch?” The clerk stammered. And before Steve could overreact, Bucky loudly intervened.
Tony’s heart broke in the nicest way…
“And why didn’t you tell us?” Sam demanded, suddenly. “Or, ask us? You just… Snapped us out of our reality without so much as a heads up?”
And Tony saw Zan flinch. He was sure Steve must’ve seen it too. But, obviously, as per the plan, Steve pretended he hadn’t.
An almost wistful look came over Tony’s face then. Just for a second, and then he just blinked, and carried on.
had to go in and see what was going on, because only recognised billionaires had any chance of getting by the gate.
As such, Tony didn’t bother to leave a pause before he sent the response that he and Steve had already agreed on.
If Gary woke up
Suddenly, the crisis that had just been so all consuming faded entirely. Steve completely forgot about the kit he was holding – it was total fluke that it didn’t fall from his hand.
“Shh, lie down,” he soothed, moving up the bed to lie beside him, letting his weight rest against Steve’s chest. Steve wrapped an arm around him, pulling him closer, and Tony felt that rush of light elation…
glowed brighter, enough that everything else just disappeared into the light around him.
And very sure of his role in this, all of a sudden.
as he arched his back, rocking his shoulder up to Steve’s mouth, rutting at what little friction Steve’s grip afforded him-
And then Tony just smiled at him.
And then, as Tony reached his front door, a cool shiver ran down the back of his neck.
That a tiny little part of Tony would kind of want to tell him - Jesus, that was a terrifying impulse. Like standing on a high ledge and realising a little part of you really wanted to jump-
Steve leant into him, one hand sliding over the back of Tony’s neck, the other still holding Tony’s hand, fingers interlaced.
, so I drink like half a mug of it and wonder why I feel weak again by lunchtime…” And then he seemed to catch himself, like he was scared he’d just said something awful, and rushed to finish, “but I’d get at least a couple of days, before I was in real trouble. Even on the worst of the crap I drink.”
having surgery, I mean.”
it would become clear that Steve hadn’t thought it all the way through… although, to be honest, Tony had never banked on that. He was expecting Steve to have run through a checklist; he was even prepared for the swell of affection that rose up in him when Steve said it.
...He could daydream about the life he was going to lead from here.
And then he felt Steve’s hand on the side of his face, strong and soft and…
“Well, kind of, yeah - well, I mean, that’s
However, the immediate area was now otherwise deserted, and that would do for Steve’s purposes. Casually, he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a USB pen - which, of course, he had to turn upside down three times before it would click into place. And then, as he sat back in his chair, an unexpected swell of relief rolled up his back… and he realised.
in that moment. He wasn’t bothering to hide his concern or his sympathy or his pride – and he didn’t bother to dress any of it up. He wasn’t making sure Tony saw any of this, or thinking about how it would come across, or mentally collecting brownie points for being so considerate… he just
This one day seemed to have taken
At first, Tony was worried that maybe Steve felt like he needed to be punished, or something… That Tony had made him feel like that…
There were no inconvenient observations or emotional responses, right now. Tony hadn’t even bothered to note that he was

The only question now was whether Tony was going to ignore Nat’s instruction to bring drinks back with him...
He felt…

Oh, but the answer couldn’t be
All the air left Tony’s lungs in a rush. A treacherous heat flooded his face, and for a second he had to divert all of his focus into not bursting into tears-
But no, Sam was following after Bucky…
That intoxicating warmth was still pulsing beneath his skin, moving closer to the surface, pinching his shoulders in anticipation of something….
“Yes, it does have that feel to it.” He smiled. “But, to answer your question, sometimes one of us will do a formal presentation” He gestured to the stage. “If there are a few people here. But, to be honest, it’s looking like it’ll probably just be the two of you tonight, so I can just take you through a bit of basic information, and then see what you want to ask about?” As he was speaking, he was gesturing to one of the women in the room, who then went over to flick a switch on the wall. One of the wooden panels began to slide upwards, concealing itself in the wall as it revealed a large, white screen. And then Dev gestured for them to follow him over to it.
He didn’t even know the answer to that question.
Of course, there were
Steve took a sharp, shuddering breath and very pointedly told himself not to get distracted by that.
“Yeah, I’m fine. I promise.”

Steve knew he should’ve spent more time interrogating Bucky over it. That he should have made more effort to prise from him the actual words, the real meaning – the response from Tony. Instead of which, he’d settled for telling Bucky that he
“Did you
But he knew he’d seen it.
Even though it felt doubtful and confused and contradictory, still, it lingered…
What if he’d never had the chance to apologise to Tony? What if he never got to hear that Tony also had regrets, and apologies - what if he never got to hear Tony say that he’d missed him?
And then he felt the shadow of Bucky standing over him, and he forced his eyes open.
Steve went between glancing over the balcony, and glancing at Tony, as he booted up the system and began trying command after command to get a response. And then his eyes lit up.
And Steve felt the cold press of a little glass object against his palm-
Steve dragged Bucky on top of him as he fell onto the bed, clawing Bucky’s t-shirt over his head so roughly that he stretched the fabric. He saw Bucky grin, briefly, as he rushed to meet Steve’s pace, ripping Steve’s shirt off and unfastening his jeans.
“Hey, Tony? You okay?” Sam asked. Tony blinked, his eyes still a little unfocused when he looked up at them.

He was just floating in this wonderful feeling, just letting it happen to him, just letting it feel good… just that.
“Because in seventy years’ time, I’ll still look like this – and he’ll be dying,” he sighed, bitterly. “And he’ll have to look back on all those wasted years, when he could’ve been meeting someone he
‘Tired’ seemed so far away from where he was.
He thought back to his uneasy self-reflection, in those first few days, when he’d first started to wonder if he’d actually been mad at Steve for just not loving him back. When he first asked himself whether it was fair to be angry at Steve because his feelings had been hurt.
Two months of remembering the warmth of Steve’s lips and the taste of his skin and the overwhelming strength in his arms…

“Why can’t you send Clint in with me?”
“Actually, you might,” Tony corrected, kindly – but still Steve inhaled sharply, bracing for something. Tony leant back to look at him when he explained, “that’s not actually the criteria, Steve. Not for anyone else, at least. People aren’t only trustworthy up until they keep one secret – otherwise you wouldn’t be able to trust a single person on Earth… I’ve lied. I’ve lied to you before, and kept things from you, but you never assumed that you could obviously never trust me again… I’m not saying what you did wasn’t wrong. I’m not saying you shouldn’t learn anything from it. I’m not saying it’s not a big deal if you lie to me – you really

But. On the other hand.
There was a stir of adrenaline that was somewhere between shock and temper, and a beat of total silence in his head.
“What did she say that was?” Tony asked, when they got to walking out to the elevator.
“Fuck me,

“Colonel Rhodes, sir…?” JARVIS explained, sounding slightly concerned.
“Keeping in mind, the alternative is staying enslaved by a group of people who might well be able to kill your entire species with the flick of a switch.” Tony talked over her, in the same level tone.
“Would that be okay?” Bucky asked quite genuinely, like he was perfectly prepared for the answer to be no…
“I know, I’m a terrible influence,” Tony grinned, because he already knew that Steve was staying. That Steve

Oh, God, Tony had finished his call.

If he
And then he gave up with an impatient shake of his head, and focused his expression again, and took another determined breath-
“Left out.”
This was before he got to that part. This was the first step on his way to that bit – the previously unthinkable step of
“I never say what I’m supposed to say.” Tony told him. “What do you want to ask?”
Steve looked absolutely wrecked. His face was flushed pink and sheened in sweat, his hair damp and dishevelled, his pupils blown.
Whatever came afterwards, Tony was
That you’re never going to stay out of a fight if you can help, and you’re always going to be able to help, because you’re you. And I love you for that, and I don’t want to change it - even though I know it’s going to be a lifetime of anxiety… It’s just… The bunker is different… And it was one thing, trying to get my head around the thought of going back there at all. To be honest, I don’t know if I was ever going to be okay with that. But if
Steve had been so flooded by adrenaline at the end of the battle that it seemed to push him out of his own body. The first thoughts that came back to him were anxious and jittery, fuelled by that residual nervous energy-
Bucky was safe, and he was home, and no one was ever going to hurt him again.
…Then it would finally make sense why this awful thing had happened to him, why Tony had ended up exactly here, exactly like this.
all the things Tony couldn’t find the words for…
But, as luck would have it, Tony had provided him with an opportunity. ‘Fifteen minutes or so’ in which Bucky would be asleep, and JARVIS would be doing all the work. Steve wouldn’t need as long as that. As huge as this was, and as much as there was riding on it, it would still only take a moment to say.
He blinked, and raised his head from the patch of white carpet that he’d been vacantly staring  through. He found a disorienting wall of moving light, without perspective, without edges...
in the process of organising his arguments – that some unnamed SHIELD agent wasn’t good enough cover. That Nick was basically asking Tony to act as protection for someone else-

But before he had a chance, Steve had pulled Tony up into a deep, bruising kiss.
Second guessing every word he’d said, and everything he might have said instead.
He’d actually invited Sam over to the house, not once but twice, and had a nice evening on both occasions.
“Oh, Steve, fuck,

And then he heard the sound of the elevator settling on his floor.
“Oh, I know
And Tony pinched his lips together, like he was slightly embarrassed at himself.
And he saw the injured look rush into Steve’s eyes, the way his chest seized up.
...Why it reminded him of watching Steve in that Bunker.
Nothing he could use to explain things to Tony, or assuage any of his fears.
The end of the first Avengers Christmas Party, when Tony had thrown himself into the couch next to Steve and made some self-deprecating joke… That watery feeling that spread through Steve’s stomach as he recognised how unguarded Tony was in that moment - that it was probably the first easy moment between them…

Steve barely swallowed a scream, caught off guard by the hot pleasure that curled in him as he clenched around Tony’s fingers. Tony pulled his hand back slowly as he dug his teeth deeper into Steve’s flesh, the spike of pain meeting that surge of pleasure, the contrasting forces pulling him apart from the inside out. He could feel himself on that knife edge, the urgency of the moment cutting into him-
“Did he get mad at you?” Bucky pushed on, regardless. And, in spite of everything, Steve found himself answering,

Already thinking he was liable to regret it, Tony let go of a weary sigh and yanked the robe over his head - taking a little too much joy in throwing the damn thing to the ground. He was thankful that he had an adolescence worth of experience in tying togas while drunk, because otherwise the task might’ve been one too many things to think about. As it was, he just about had the sheet in place when he heard the sound of shouting in the distance-

he’d felt, when they first worked out what The Facility was – the idea he dared not look at. The desire he dare not name.
“Them,” Tony clarified, nodding his head over Steve’s shoulder. Steve turned, and saw that Sam and Bucky were now standing quite a distance away from them, at the very edge of the field - but close enough that Steve could make out the exaggerated gesturing of a fight.

Steve could’ve taken a moment to establish exactly how things were going to stand in this timeline - to state out loud, for the world to hear, that he was cutting all ties to the previous version of himself and the loyalties he’d been tied into-

“And what’s your plan for when I kick you out?” He asked instead, raising an eyebrow in challenge.

He remembered that pull of connection, that spark of real time inspiration, as he

“I think he regretted that,” Bucky observed, with a smile.
“Yeah, okay.” Steve smiled, eventually. “Why not?”
…Because, well, even if Steve didn’t want to talk about last night, he

the slightest taste of himself there on the very edge of Tony’s tongue-
He did one final check of his monitor, almost wishing he’d find some anomaly to investigate… But no. All scans running as they should be, all results as expected. And, of course, that meant that this was now

“Hm?” Tony snapped out of his spiral, and glanced back at Steve…
Tony didn’t know what to do with that.
Where had it gotten him?
And Bucky very nearly laughed.
He saw what each of those authors had been trying to say through the prism of their own society.
“Nothing.” Maribelle answered, quickly and decisively. “I’ve never even met him; no one has. I don’t think he’s ever been down from the fourth floor.”
… But, in a way, thinking back to it felt like remembering a particularly vivid dream. There was still that slight distance, the disconnect between the way Tony’s brain had worked that night and the way it worked when he looked back on it… There was still that wordless feeling that it had happened in a different world, that it had happened

might ripple.
It began as one of those immediate, uncontrollable bursts of laughter that breaks right from the chest - and then rolled through him like a forest fire, each fit of giggles sparking the next, each level of disintegration just making the whole thing funnier. Steve laughed harder every time he remembered why he was laughing, and then he laughed at how hard he was laughing, and then he laughed at how hard Tony was laughing, and then he laughed at the fact that they were

Tony squeezed his eyes shut and told himself to concentrate. Slowly, it came back to him…
