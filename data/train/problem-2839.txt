”... I was concentrating on you.” Cas was speaking carefully as if his words were negotiating a maze made of razor blades and knives. “I saw some memories of your childhood together. The two of you argued a lot when you were younger.”
“Oh, I did,” Dean put in. “Your version, that is. We left him trussed up over there. This here is the Cas from my world. He’s not happy with you either.”
Isn’t there? whispers the question. Dean’s heard rumors. There’s some betas… the ones who think they’re oh-so-tough but who have a weak head, can’t take the pressure. Who reach too high in their pack. They can’t maintain it. A subtle stress builds up, poisons the body, the bend, and suddenly they- no. Come on. That’s stupid.
A clarion call in the distance heralds the end of their current savage entertainment. Dean makes an aggrieved “aww!” echoed by Jo and a few of the other younger Hunters, but Castiel, who is responsible for all their lives, does feel relieved.
The very small feeling of detente between them had frittered away, but Castiel had hopes - had faith - that one day he’d be able to establish a true long term rapport with both Winchesters. It was surely just a matter of time. If he continued to act calmly and reasonably, as humans always preferred their interactions to be, surely both brothers would unbend in short order.
“The rest, come with me, we’re going north.” Vic jabs a hand in that direction like he’s chopping it in two with an axe. Yup, whatever’s out there is gonna regret it if a sleep deprived alpha finds it first. Betas may be ready for a fight all day all night, but an alpha in early summer is
Dean did not leave the question behind him in the library stacks, it still gnaws at him, and the final image, calm - tame - as it is makes something shiver deep inside, but he puts the book in his pack regardless and leads them back to camp.
He wants to stay at Dean’s side, share the dangers, fall into bed with him every night - shoved back into the mattress while Dean leaps on him with a ragged grin - or simply sit and watch the two Winchesters sit at the kitchen table, eat lunch and argue…
Bright Day was a celebration of love and the new spring bursting out beyond the castle walls. Peasants would give bright yellow flowers to their sweethearts, mothers gave their children hard-boiled egg yolks, landowners would give a shiny gold coin or ring to their inamoratas while royalty outdid themselves with the fanciest of lavish gifts. Jewelers made a quarter of their yearly coin on that day alone.
“There has never been a time I’d give up on you,” Castiel points out shortly into Dean’s hair. “Nothing that happens between us now can change that.”
Alfie sounds like a bard as he regales his audience. “The first I saw her, she was kneeling in the dirt of the battlefield - but the earth wouldn’t dare soil the pure linen of her white dress. Her hair was a waterfall of white-gold splendor caught in a diadem. On her bodice was the silver fleur-de-lis that her Crusaders adopted as the symbol of their holy endeavor. Her face… you’ve seen her, her face is as beautiful as a gem, and back then it was like a dream in the midst of the battlefield. She reached out her hand, as small and delicate as a bird, and brought a dead soldier back to life with a single touch.”
“I can cut myself off from Heaven and the Machine. If I do that, then Michael cannot communicate with me, nobody can find me. For awhile. Unless I use an excessive amount of power.”
“That’s one of many likely problems,” Chuck stated. “Problems humanity will have to sort out. I’ll still be around in a limited capacity, I’ll provide food, healing - though humans will have to go to the altars for that, you won’t have angels running around fixing your slightest booboo. Will it be potentially rough? Yes. But-”
“Lots, if you know how to look,” Dean said shortly. “But I ain’t gonna waste time on foraging. I’d rather go hungry.”
“Yes, but if you come into contact with their blood, you need to tell me right away - and it will still be dangerous, I am not of the Hands of Mercy, I-“
“My mother planted a seed in the center of the royal gardens, which grew into a tree,” the man says gravely.
He finally manages to stop coughing and clears his throat enough to talk after a couple of tries. “...I am very confused.”
“Should we get some bread to go with it?” Sam asked, getting an empty plate out and making a gesture to put it on the table.
Dean, conveniently at the outer edge of the pack, takes a few steps to the right and realizes he still has a shadow.
“But either way, when someone saves your life like that, it’s destiny, right? That always ends in a marriage.”
Cas’s hands are a Maker’s hands: long fingers grip, strong muscles flex when he wields a hammer. But the way he holds that lightbulb, a mother hen wouldn’t handle her egg any more tenderly. He inspects it with care, and Dean momentarily silences his rambling monologue to watch.
Dean, who’d been changing his bed, dropped the sheets in shock. “Goddamn- what did I tell you about flying around inside the house?!”
Dean and the other betas from his group fall out without another word. At his back, he hears Vic say: “We will escort you to the roadhouse. While we-”
“The CDC…You actually found-...” Then Cas pulls himself together, focuses on his brother, hard. “What did you find exactly?”
“That’s convenient.” But also true. It’s not like they posted the circumstances of Drew’s demise on the trees all around camp for the magpies to read. Even other packs John warned about this probably only got informed ‘some foreign beta up to no good approached one of our omegas, put up a fight, got shot.’ Nobody but those involved would know the blow-by-blow.
“Pshaw, he’s fine already.” Max gets to his feet, cracking his knuckles. “It wasn’t all that deep. He’s indestructible, is our commander. Maybe I should feel sorry for the demons. Only bringing half a dozen? What were they thinking? Castiel, keep pressure on the wrist, it’s not too bad, and I want to make sure I hold back some magical reserves in case there’s fighting later. Ride back slowly, don’t undo my healing on your thigh, okay? The ribs are going to hurt too, I’m afraid. I’m not as good as the lil’ lady over there when it comes to stitching things up, but I will gladly eat my humble pie, knowing that at least I’m not an evil scheming harpy. See me tomorrow for a follow-up on the leg, take a couple of days rest in the meantime, and you’ll be fit to run a race by Sunday.”
His room at the top of the house being pretty cold even in the perpetual summer of Paradise, Dean normally slept under a couple of blankets in his long johns… but today he was fully dressed and sleeping on top of his covers. Other abnormality: he wasn’t alone. Sam was snoring faintly next to him, also fully dressed with his hand resting on the New Talmud at his side, like a knight’s sword to protect Dean’s chastity from the other occupant in the room, to whit - Dean turned his head on the pillow to face the other way - the angel sitting on the couch, staring straight at Dean with a moody expression.
Original-factory-setting Castiel’s voice made the plastic windows of the warehouse rattle and shake, the plumes of dust from the destruction at his feet whipped around like a prude dame’s skirt reacting to a naugthy suggestion. “This is your plan? To summon
He would never afterwards know what came over him, because he was used to what Dean Winchester did to him, that fond warmth that burned deep inside, he was used to ignoring it. He had all the intentions of ignoring it then too. Sure, Dean had remembered him on Bright Day, but with such a- a ridiculous paltry thing-
“Fuss,” Dean repeats murderously. It was only five hours ago he watched Cas cut away Vic’s trousers and saw what was underneath...
“Who?” Robert asked bluntly, finally stepping in front of the king to force him to stop pacing. “They'd have to be the devil himself to get a jump on your prince. He’s had the courtiers whipped since Michaelmas the year he came. It was nice to no longer have to worry about it myself,” the old man grumbled, eyes dark with worry belying his tone. “He dealt just fine with those venomous toads, their little plots and power-plays. I was beginning to think I could finally retire without seeing you murdered immediately. No, I’m not sure what happened, but I don’t think-”
“How far?” Dean whispered - angel senses being what they were, he didn’t need to keep his voice down, his presence alone would be enough to alert any celestial being paying attention, but he couldn’t help himself. This alien building made him feel like an unwelcome intruder, like a roach in the foundation.
“We’ve practiced for this, people,” said Bobby, sounding almost bored. “We know how they work, and we work around them. We’re the operators here. They’re just the obstacles. Let’s get the train started.”
“I’m perfectly fine, Ben,” Castiel started to say, feeling guilty at the way the boy was hanging back in the doorway as if unsure of his welcome.
“That would have been considerably better,” Hannah says bitterly. “The Watchers in Heaven have found something. For months now, they have been feeling increasingly uneasy. It wasn't clear before, with the nephilim and other angels on earth, but now that the static of their presence has cleared, the Watchers are sure. They’ve analyzed the traces of what happened last year - it’s knell still echoes among the farthest corners of the stars. They recognize the stench of what is growing down on earth, however faint and hidden it may be.”
The way he said heir, tone heavily ironic whilst only a few feet away from the precocious boy, made Castiel’s skin crawl.
“I am fortunate to have found an emotionally intelligent, smart, strong beta such as yourself, and to have him like me and accept me in a way-... in a way very few people have, even inside my own family.”
“Oh, Dean, you don’t need to- you can just leave the notebook with me now, I can squeeze it under my arm-”
“Uh, sure,” Dean says, even though now there’s just an open door and Gordon looking at Dean like he eats babies on the sly.
“Yeah. She died because all her life she wanted to be a mom. The Machine said, hey, guess what, you’re not one of the lucky few chosen to have children, and there’s no appeal. Tough! And then my mom-.... my mom who had already had Dean and who was-... You’re right, I never knew Karen, and Dean was too young to remember her, but I know her through Bobby and Ellen and others, and she would have made a great mom. And instead, who gets in the family way for a second time, when hardly anyone has more than one kid anymore? Her best friend, Mary Campbell, a Hunter on active duty who probably didn’t even want a second child at all. How does that make sense to you…? Bobby tells me mom tried to help. She got Karen to watch Dean for her, she hoped Karen would- would get to be our second mom. Instead, Karen brought Dean back one day, gave my eight-month old pregnant mom a hug, and went home, and you know what happened next.”
the human the angel was now united to. He thought he and Sam had ironed out some of their earlier mistrust...
Sam, waiting for him to finish his question, followed his gaze with a frown. He pulled his shirt closed and did up a couple of buttons.
“Even better. You’re still building muscle. You know what they say about pups who quicken in winter, right? It’s true, you want to work your body even if it’s hard to go out, or this whole state will last even longer. Besides, the cold will help dissipate that itchy heat you’re always complaining about.”
Cole’s muscles are as tense as a spring, he’s not giving in an inch to the beta who’s got him by the neck, his voice is an aggressive snarl. “I knew it was you, I heard you approach- recognized your step-”
His Majesty King John the First of Lawrence fell in the war against Prince Azazel that following year. Dean was crowned on the battlefield, and then the warrior king, assisted by his brother, gathered his armies. A year of staggered campaigns brought Dean’s long-term strategies to fruition, positioning the two Winchesters to where they could finally crush the invaders and execute Azazel, avenging their father. But when Dean returned to his kingdom, ragged after years of war, he found plenty of problems waiting but no signs of Lisa. Dean searched high and low. Insert romantic machinations imagined by scullery maids and dowager duchesses alike. Where the silly legend of the lost slipper came from, Castiel had no clue; he’d found some of Lisa’s footwear in an out-of-the-way closet in the Consort wing one day, her shoe size was perfectly normal and could fit three quarters of the female population of the kingdom, so surely- oh, right, not a romantic.
“Well I thought it was good news. One less demon,” Sam mumbles, turning back to his open laptop and email.
“Great. I’m tougher than Crowley. That’s like saying I’m nicer than Lucifer. That bar ain’t high, lady.”
“Yeah.” Jo made a show of sighing, but her step lengthened and she perked up a bit. They just had to last the day without kicking an angel in the pants or breaking a decree, and tonight they’d be helping folk and pissing off the Host. It took the bite out of an afternoon of being put on display like débutantes waiting for a suitor to notice them at the fucking summer ball.
“There was such a massive unraveling of our reproductive system that it could be an accidental byproduct, but the fact that we are all of us functioning hermaphrodites - which just didn’t
Cas looks back, looks around, an internal struggle all over his face. Then: “Just… just one more minute, Dean. Please?”
That’s how the tale goes, that’s how the bards will remember Dean Winchester the First, known as King Dean the Brave, or Dean of the Holy Sword and Rifle. And one has to admit that ‘I am taking up the cross of the crusade’ sounds better than ‘I get bored in a throne room, there’s demons to fight, and I want to make sweet love to my male companion in peace without the privy council pestering me about weddings and heirs, so I am abdicating in favor of my brother who is married with a son now and a good deal better at all this politicking anyway, fare thee well, sirs, fare thee well!’
Like he’d expected the thrust, like he’d dodged Dean a thousand times before - he parried with his forearm, twisted his elbow at just the right angle, plucked Dean’s wrist out of the air like a fucking daisy. A grip like a steel clamp wrung the blade out of Dean’s numb fingers, and now he really was going to die.
“Pity, but we’ll think of something. That will give the League plenty of time to spread the word far and wide, and mobilize all the people here who might like you.” A veiled reference, Dean supposed, to the resistance, not that he could involve them in this mess.
Cas overtakes him and parks himself between Dean and the omegas. “Hi, what are your names? We’ve not met. I’m Castiel.”
there’s an alpha in charge, then some will start to grow hair on their chest big time and soon the pack will tear itself apart until a newly minted alpha pair leaves, taking a bunch of betas and omegas with them.
were a bunch of dicks that had robbed humanity of freedom, robbed him and Sam of their mom, of Jess, robbed so many people of so much. But that was angels plural, as a group. Individual angels were sweet Alfie, Balthazar drawling out mock insults, Melod ignoring small transgressions because he understood a bit, it was Cas-... it was Cas. Listening, with that head tilt of his, trying to understand. Picking a tomato with an air of wonder, staring at bees, smiling at something banal on the Lantern, going down on one knee with a serious look on his face to better follow what a child was explaining. It was his spouse helping Dean haul in the wood, talking to Sam, meeting Dean’s friends, it was... just Cas.
Cole’s left stranded in the middle of all this, gone from being the voice of rebellion to the puppy locked out of the house. From the way he’s swaying, he can’t quite believe this happened and he doesn’t understand how.
Dean glanced over his shoulder instinctively. This was not something he ever discussed out in public without speaking in code. Or with a Seraph for that matter. “Yeah. ’Course not. I got an angel on my back, talk about a security risk. I thought that was obvious.”
Dean tenses, rips his gaze off of Cas’s stiff shoulders so he can look down at Charlie. For a second he’d actually forgotten her there.
Since this is divergent from Soul Survivor onwards, Executioner Song never took place. I had to take care of Cain somehow… We’ll see a bit more what that dream meant at the end of the fic.
Change of plan, it felt better to roll the chapter and the small epilogue together into one larger final chapter. Enjoy the completed fic ^___^
“Oh, they can get anywhere, they’re awesome climbers - but once up there, she’ll be stuck.” There’s boxes at the other end of the bookshelf all the way up to the ceiling, blocking the climber's path, and now the leash sweeps the top of the furniture, aiming right at her.
Dean sank onto Sam’s bed, staring at the note. Then he closed his eyes hard and brought his hands together (only collaborators prayed -)
The moon is sailing through the sky when he leaves. Dean takes a very small detour on his way back to his cabin, prompted by his thoughts about the omega barracks earlier. There’s a hodgepodge of a shack behind Vic’s place, it used to be a clapboard shed but then it got expanded in fits and starts to shelter a bunch of bunk beds around a coal heater and a long table.
“Where’s this herd from?” Jo asked disinterestedly as they spotted the first visitors trickle down main street.
“Duma? Oh, yeah, I remember him, he was in the Azazel search-and-destroy group. Towering red-bearded fella.”
“It’s this bit.” Dean takes a discreet breath, hoping his middling-to-slow reading skills are not about to humiliate him. ”The human re-pro-duce- reproductive system was most affected by GF32, in large ways and small.”
The brothers exchange a glance. “Uh-huh. Worry about the warlock’s continued health, not mine,” says Dean with a snort.
The plot thickens! The next chapter is not related to the Winchester-centric plot, however, I'll leave it to speculation as to what it could be about... (obviously nothing rosy and happy and full of kittens.)
The fastidious fallen angel thinking briefly about all this is at the far, far back of Castiel’s head right at the moment; Castiel the newly minted human, the perpetual outsider with a heart that feels like it’s finally found a home, is already nodding eager consent and tugging Dean forward by the hand he’s captured.
slipped through his fingers but Castiel’s hand had fastened on his arm as he caught him, and pulled him up into the light of the pinned sun and into their combined destiny.
Dean didn’t look around the corner. Angels had extremely keen eyesight. Their hearing was very good too in theory, but being in a town full of movement, people talking and singing, kids playing loudly, creaking wood, clattering footsteps and heartbeats made that no more useful than an average human’s senses. The crucial thing with angels was to stay out of sight, but Dean needed to know where the chicken hawk was. If it’d been one of his railroad operators up at the window above, Dean could have gotten the bastard’s exact location through code, but Sarah wasn’t up to that, and he wouldn’t put her at risk anyway. He had other means.
The last of the demons, the heavy-set one, takes stock for a few astounded seconds. It’s all alone now… but it has a weapon and Castiel does not. An evil grin conquers the look of uncertainty on its stolen face and it lumbers forward confidently.
But a week later, the elusive Mr Smith hasn’t been found. They can only dog his trail at a distance, following from one of his exploits to the next, putting together the picture of a formidable hunter who is always three steps ahead of them.
“But that’s my point. You didn’t betray your railroad or your resistance or your friends, and they tried to kill you anyway. Saying that not all the resistance is like that does not signify, because that is what their rebelion is leading to. That freedom you threw in my face the other day, that’s your savage freedom, Dean: humans killing each other over a disagreement. Not even a disagreement as to a cause such as opposing the Host, no, simply in the way they think the cause should be fought, between those of you who believe that some compromises can be reached, some situations accepted, and fanatics who will accept no compromise and who can only think in terms of blood shed. That is the result with a common enemy - angels - to oppose. Can you imagine if you were truly on opposite sides? The atrocities that would be unleashed? You think you’re at war with us? I’m sorry, but you have no concept of what the word even means.”
“By envoys, you mean the gullible mooks you sent far away in case the spell blew up in their faces or brought the wrath of heaven down on their sorry asses.”
“Oh hell yeah, now you’re talking my language. I know this diner off Highway 16, doesn't look like much but the food is worth killing over.”
Parley, huh? Dean gives their surroundings one last suspicious look. They’re in a gentle basin pockmarked with copses of trees here and there, it doesn’t exactly scream ‘ambush’, but then again neither did the setup this morning. Talking of which...
with the maker of this curse.” Dean can honestly not tell if she wants to congratulate the guy or crucify him. Right this minute, Rowena herself sounds like she’s on the fence.
“Oh, I like to tweak the noses of powerful entities that could crush this entire continent like it was a-“
“...I don’t think he knows what she looks like.” The interjection is a little hesitant. “Wasn’t he blinded?”
Jo actually snickers, tight, nervous; she’s still fighting the trance this alpha is imposing on their beta physiology.
are also an angel on earth, and what happens when all the runaways are back home or six feet under, huh? Aren’t you in a ‘last man out turns off the lights’ kind of situation here?”
The hunter’s den is deserted, Dean doesn’t have to keep up the appearance of a dutiful deputy right this minute. He stomps over to the couch and flings himself on it like he’s ten, sending it careening back a foot across the hardwood.
The Mark on his arm is faint. Rowena gives it a month tops before it’s gone for good. So now it’s going to be a waiting game. To see if the kid, once born, has the power to help whatever spell she wants to try next. Though they’ll have to wait awhile before she can do that safely; if she upsets the kid before he’s old enough to understand the necessity, she’ll end up looking like a red-headed barbie at best, or more likely a smear on the wall.
“Uuuh, ‘f Dean’s good, ’m good,” Charlie says woozily as she props herself up on her elbows, barely awake.
Castiel tensed, blade instinctively slipping into his palm, eyes scrutinizing the gathering gloom for what had made Dean jump and swear like that, before realizing it had been the rumble of thunder.
Late in the evening on the second day, he hears the bunker door open. Well known footsteps brush across concrete, metal stairs, hardwood floor. A jacket gets tossed on a chair, the ch-chink of a gun being checked and put down on an antique side table.
“Can’t imagine why,” says Dean, glancing around. The swan’s watery habitat is ensconced in a clearing smack dab in the middle of the Dread Forbidden Forest where the sun only pierces the canopy at high noon and entire armies have disappeared without a trace, which is of course the reason Dean is here, and most sane people are not. The lake itself is pleasant: clear enough to count the duckweed in its depths, bejeweled with lily pads and small emerald frogs, while on the shore where Dean dismounted, a venerable old hunting lodge leads to a delicate gazebo plunging marble steps straight into the water. ‘Pretty’, is what Dean would call it (
Just as Lydia’s fist drew back and a moment before Dean snagged it, he caught sight of Cas’s expression. Head down, omega-meek, but still calm. Composed. Certain. Ready to take that blow as his due, the price he’s willing to pay just for speaking his mind - and Dean’s not only furious, he’s fucking sick to his stomach at the thought of Cas -
“Yeah! Who’s a good boy?! You are! Wow, so fast! Who’s a fast boy?! Go Robbiekins! Go buddy!” croons Sam, doing a micro crawl at the kid’s side to avoid outpacing Robbie by feet.
Once the three of them were seated - Castiel on a stool that’d been taken from Sam’s study in the other room - there was a moment where the brothers looked at each other then at Castiel repeatedly, as if unsure how to proceed. Finally Sam coughed and held out his hands to both Dean and to Castiel. Dean did the same, with a faint huff.
Castiel glances down at himself. Suit, trenchcoat - he still isn’t wearing a tie, but surely that’s not a problem -
“This ain’t sheriff Uriel,” Rufus said softly, already three steps away towards the nearby alley between houses.
Robert took a sharp turn in his hurried course to stride towards Crowley. Poulterers, confectioners, milkmaids and basters leapt out of his way left and right, a sea parting before him like Moses, but the pharaoh was already on the other side, waiting for him with a provocative sneer on his face.
Once he was sure Dean was listening, Castiel folded his arms over his chest and turned that strict gaze towards the window. “I am not sure... I am awaiting Revelation same as you on this, but there is one thing that I can guarantee you right now. There will be no harm done to you or your family. Sam Winchester will not be threatened or harmed, not unless he breaks a serious decree. You have my word on that.”
WARNING for casual disregard of postpartum depression (because Dean), for magical birth leading to a realistic newborn in all its un-glory, also for passing thoughts of infanticide, because of circumstances. Only passing, however.
“What’s that?” Dean interrupts Castiel’s grumblings, pointing to the cloth his commander is holding folded over his forearm.
Dean and Ben conspired to spoil him that afternoon, and Castiel let them. They dragged him, settee and all, to a spot by the fire with furs over his lap and a mantle around his shoulders, where they fed him beef tail consomé which was apparently good for the blood and fainting fits. Then Ben read to him from
A look of fury and a clenched fist suggested the old knight was contemplating a more physical repartee, but then he released the apron. “I got no time for this. I’m turning this castle upside down if I have to, but I’ll find our prince.”
Ginny is hungry and pokes him with her nose, whines gently once. He has nothing for her in his small larder, so he opens the door to let her hunt around the outside of the compound, find a mouse under the snow or scraps somewhere. Dean’s not hungry. Ginny looks longingly at the outside, sniffs the air a few times, then turns tail and returns to her spot by the fire from where she watches Dean quietly with big liquid eyes and floppy ears twitched down and back. Dean returns to his chair.
“I accept,” he said to the silence and the spider. Though I would have preferred a posting on the front line fighting Leviathan with my bare hands, added a small part of Castiel with a faint sigh of resignation.
The silence stretches. Luke’s still got the snide, punchable look on his face, he’s just waiting for his brother to finish in order to be more of a dick. But Cas isn’t finishing. In the silence that stretches between the brothers, the
“I know what you’re about to say, Dean. That you also considered ending Jesse Turner when you knew what he was, despite his age.”
“Alrighty then.” Dean wrapped his grin around the tip of his spouse’s cock, tongue chasing a hint of that taste of lightning and light that he'd found in Cas's mouth. Cas, completely ignorant of human conventions, particularly of the bedroom variety, didn’t make appreciative noises or encouragement or anything one might expect, but neither did he protest, and when Dean glanced up, it was to meet that blue-eyed gaze as bright as the noonday sun, watching him raptly. That and the further swell beneath his tongue and fingers suggested there was the opposite of any problem or objection here. Good. He reached for one of Cas’s hands, quiescent on the coverlet, and encouraged it to rest on his head. Cas touched him with the same gentleness as before, as if Dean was something precious and fragile. Dean liked it a bit rough, but didn’t mind this either… He shifted a bit on his knees, free fingers trailing over his own growing erection which was starting to quiver and beg for a stroke. A few quick tugs was all he allowed. He wasn’t sure how Cas would react to what was going to follow; he doubted his husband would be scared off at this point, but maybe he shouldn’t delay in getting on to the next stage, he wasn’t sure what Cas’s endurance would be like, it being completely untested and all. He reached blind for the pot of oily mixture while he let his tongue and lips and teeth continue to play.
He reaches up, gently removes the hand Dean’s put over his eyes, covering his expression that’s broken like a ship on a reef. His emotions are still all over the place, even though he’s now as sure as hell he’s not falling. But… but maybe a part of him wanted to, you know...? A part of him wanted to go to Cas even if, once arrived, they’d never have had sex. If they'd both ended up together in the omega barracks, they would certainly never have made love like they just did, they never would have touched at all, but still, in a way, in a strange and weird way, he is somehow sure they would still have been lovers…
open the door,” he ordered a startled Sam, who was now holding up Cas like Dean had done earlier. He went to the side window, examined it carefully, slid it open and made his way around the house to the front door, wary of anyone taking a pot shot. Night was falling fast, and revolvers didn’t have a rifle’s range, they’d likely miss if he was more than thirty yards away… unless he got unlucky. Dean suspected he'd already spent every ounce of his luck tonight and was now running a tab.
They barely made it out of the guest wing before the angel who had been politely guiding them abruptly disappeared. Cas lifted his head like a hound scenting the wind.
Breath rattles in Dean’s throat. It’s like he’s coming back to his body a piece at a time, discovering bits like foreign territory, the freezing air in his lungs, the creak of snow under his boots, the agony lancing up and down his arm and right hand, the mid-morning sun shining in his eyes, making him squint, the copper-meat smell of blood building in his nose.
“I am not hallucinating, damn it, come on, having  a prince turn into a swan is not even the fifth strangest thing we’ve seen this year. But if you can’t feel the magic on him, that means the curse is tied to the lake. We need to head back.” Dean sighs, and then dodges a beak thrust with the habit of practice he’s garnered the last few days.
Cas shifted. Just a bit. Not a flinch or a sign of weakness; he leaned back an inch to better accommodate Dean’s canted body - sending fireworks like a dozen railroad signals rocketing up to Dean’s inner sky. Cas was- was reading his body language, figuring out how to help spool out that pleasure even further, god
“You could say that.” The words rasped past the clench of Dean's jaw. His narrowed eyes suggested he was contemplating the possible penance for punching a flip God in the face, and if it wouldn't be worth it anyway.
Dean scratched his forehead with a very small screwdriver, looking puzzled. “Now that I think about it, Jonah didn’t say why he wanted me to quit it. Just snipped in passing when I was working on this lil’ guy here in the yard one day, then sent me a sharp note via the Machine the next morning. I just thought it was because we’re not supposed to change stuff. You know.”
They fill in the grave of the old sinner, and then head back to the car and a future filled with danger and diapers, demons and a tricycle, angry angels and a long-running argument about the advantages of the Impala versus a minivan.
Dean knew, to the bottom of his being, that if they had had the long life together that they were meant to have, then every new and fascinating thing he’d find out about Cas would make its way into his heart and soul, and vice versa. Up to and including the spectacular fights they would still have, since they were both as stubborn and ornery as a couple of tom cats, soulmate stuff notwithstanding. But even those arguments would have gotten them closer once the dust settled, he was sure.
“I see signs of stress,” Castiel adds, hands trailing after his gaze over the familiar body, the rich casing of the gem of the soul, beautiful in its impermanence, its frailty and yet undoubtedly its strength too. Splendid, as always, despite… yes, traces of ill health, exhaustion, lack of sleep, loss of muscle tone, increase of weight, signs of strain as if Dean has suffered some repetitive injury around the middle, and there are lingering traces of magic like foreign fingerprints over solid gold. Castiel sighs. “I wish I could have helped, the spell must have been arduous.”
“Cas, I don’t know what this says. I have no idea where this is sending us next.” The match guttered, he dropped it absently and brought his hand to rub his mouth, staring at the note. The hand was shaking. Castiel felt something clench deep inside, anger and concern. Dean was exhausted from this- this insane carnival of clues sending them hiking for
“-that just wasn’t done in my former pack,” Cas says, navigating around a claw of rebar swiping out from a large clump of palm sedge. He’s been talking virtually nonstop since they passed by a landmark indicating they were less than ten minutes away from their destination. Dean almost told him to be quiet and let him focus on their environment, but he knows his friend is just real nervous about what they’re going to find at the end of this large road. So he lets Cas talk, most of his attention on the corners of buildings and the alleys and occasional pothole.
That's set down the ground rules, now let's see how Dean and Cas (and the rest of Paradise) negotiate them. Comments/questions adored ^__^ Hopefully next chapter out next week, life's gone completely crazy but writing relaxes me.
Cas, who’d followed him in and shut the door, glanced at their surroundings and then back at Dean. “I thought it would be familiar.”
Cas twitches a little. “...Dean, do hunters have any real objection to curtains in final?” he starts to probe almost cautiously - still a bit of omega clinging to him at times, or maybe it’s the Maker’s fussiness he’s not sure will fit into a Hunter’s free-roaming lifestyle.
Cas glanced down at his chest and then up at Dean’s face without a single remote hint of embarrassment or shyness. In fact, the latter’s familiarity with the angel’s small tells informed him Cas was both intrigued and rather pleased with the effect his initiative had gotten him.
The omega is standing near a large gaping hole in the goddamn floor. The couch was inching out over it under the impetus of Dean’s last shove. Floorboards have been pried up, there’s tools and nails around. The floor proper has also been prybarred, and the base of the house beneath that has been sawed open by the looks of it.
He fell silent for a full minute. The logs crackled, highlighting the silence of the night around them.
...A splintered thought stays lodged in his mind, a wish that he could fly again. That’d get him to the location of these misbehaving angels in no time, and then his wings could take him back to Dean’s side in a human heartbeat. Beyond the convenience, he really misses flight. The power of flinging himself through the Ether, the grace of spiralling past churning stars and around the calm blue marble of the Earth, the softness of air flowing past him like a caress.
“You would not drag him into a conspiracy now, when you refused to do it ten years ago, back when there was considerably less risk.” Cas sounded very rational. And he was completely right of course. But...
Rob whimpers. A warning shot across the bows, as it were. The first two months, the kid was an eating, sleeping, shitting machine. It was easy. When he cried, you knew what to look for. But a personality is now starting to bubble up inside what was purely a mechanical need for survival until now. Now he wants to be held a lot, and talked to, and rocked back to tranquility with a raspy acapella Metallica medley (Dean pretends to be more annoyed than pleased when the kid seems to like him better than any of the other adults when it came to being a walking pacifier, but he doesn’t think anyone’s buying it.)
“Whoa!” The grin turned jagged and openly mocking. “Sharper than the serpent’s tooth is the ungrateful brat! I’ve done you and your family nothing
Congratulate themselves? Why?! They’d not contributed to Alastair’s defeat. Their Father’s second born has grown up and is striking out on its own, leaving the angels to flap around in increasing redundancy,
“We forbid bachelors from becoming involved, because their soulmates could be out there,” said Cas, a faint sadness in his tone hinting that he was also thinking of Sam. “So we cannot allow relationships and attachments.”
This-”... the outburst caught him by surprise, but too late to stop now. “This is the part I hate. The waiting. Not being able to do anything. Once the hellbeast is out-... well then shit can happen. Something I can actually
“Good,” Dean said and meant it. Being a decoy was the linchpin’s job, and if that had protected just a bit of Sam’s inner life, his feelings...
“That is good to hear,” said Bartholomew, rather than ‘damn you for finding the best protection a human could wish for in this day and age.’ The League was a power not to be neglected. It wasn’t just that each and every one of them could argue until the sun went down and even an angel got bored. The members of the League communicated, they were organized, and people respected them, the good people, including many of the Sheep, and yes, even a few angels believed firmly in their cause and helped them out as much as they could. If Sam was kidnapped out of the home of the current head of the League, the kind of woe that would generate would cause unrest, worry, protests and paranoia from P1 to P419 or higher, and the angels did not want their charges disturbed, after all. They trod carefully around the Advocates.
“Is the why significant? Don’t all angels want to come down and meddle?” Dean asked, dwelling more on the how and the who.
“Does she ever? Did you want to go pick it up today? I can probably go in a few hours, I just need to finish this procedural document first.”
The tracker nodded as if this made perfect sense and flew off. Yeah, in their job, they did not have to be hampered by red tape. Uriel was another matter.
Dean’s black charger rears under the effect of a sudden curbed rein bringing her to a halt. His eyes are wide as they take in the sight of the clearing, widen even more as they settle on Castiel.
sounds like Paradise’, was what Dean would have said once upon a time, or more specifically, two months ago and before he’d gotten married to an angel who’d willingly followed him down to hell to save his brother.
Dean frowned. He knew instantly where that was; as it had only ever happened once, there wouldn’t be cause for confusion. He was just surprised the Joker knew where one of the members of his cell had taken his eighteen year old son fishing that one time. John and Dean had not even caught anything. They’d shared a large bottle of home brewed beer, complained about Sam’s stubbornness a bit, sat in sunshine. It was one of the best days of Dean’s life, two years before John’s death.
put me on my ass. You… Bloody hell. Look, I… I don’t see you-... You’re my best friend, okay? But this… I don’t really feel that way-... “ Dean’s start-and-stop sentences are abruptly tossed aside as the hunter straightens. He shakes off Castiel’s grip and makes a cutting gesture with his hand. “Look, nothing’s going to happen. That’s just not in the cards. Got it?”
Dean strode along. It was early morning, they had a long day’s walk ahead of them, they were still in the relative safety of the Garden... Nothing like whiling away the miles with a game of ‘who thought up
could be used when talking about Castiel was if one added “not at all, really,” or “strewth, quite the reverse,” immediately afterwards. Dull, dutiful and devoid of humor, prince consort Castiel could accidentally kill romance just by glancing in its direction.
“No. I’m sorry, there’s no easy way to explain this... Released from their responsibility to exist, might be close. Encouraged not to. In a way.”
“Yes, Cassie, it does matter,” Balthazar said, sinking into the Light. “There’s stuff going on here. Trust me.”
Someone up ahead singing ‘Swing Low Sweet Chariots’ had him instantly on the alert. He spotted Melod clumping around on Halpern, looking industrious and pretty useless. Dean dodged him easily. A small part of him would miss that rum cull; a harmless angel, the kind it was easy to get around. Doubt he’d find them that congenial at the next town he’d stop at.
John’s next question cuts past the formalities and into the quick. “Is there a lot of rearranging of your teams?”
Dean should do something, take charge, discipline the mutt or send for Garth to take Clancy back and keep a better eye on him this time, but honestly, deep in his noggin, Dean’s clawing at the door too. He doesn’t have the heart to come down hard on the poor half-grown puppy. Dean’s arms are savagely crossed so he doesn’t fidget. Can’t afford to show his nerves even though he’s wound up tight.
Now to get on with the rest of his duties which, as it turned out, also revolved around family. And since one of the visitors this day was king Michael, domestic love and cheer would not be flowing from that quarter either. But after almost two years of married life, Castiel was finally going to meet his brother in marriage, Samuel Winchester. He’d never even seen the man outside of a portrait, and the fear that Samuel would disapprove of him, of his inclinations and his marriage to Dean were some of the concerns that had kept Castiel awake at night. But from what Dean had told him - proudly and at length - of his brother, Samuel was a kind and tolerant man, and Castiel hoped they’d get along.
“Of course not. I am fully intending to go back,” Cas said firmly,. “I am being a bit loose in my interpretation of my orders, but as a Seraph, I do have that leeway to maneuver within the confines of my mission. Once I am back with Sam safe and sound, I will explain my reasons.”
“That’s the spirit.” Dean stole the rest of his glass and shot it back. “Don’t get blotted until you’re back home though.”
If it’d been a being even remotely similar to Uriel, Sam would have done something stupid and regrettable, he was sure. Fortunately Cas was-... Cas. All around weird, undoubtedly sharp and dangerous in his own way, while at the
“I… sorry, this is my first time getting important quest information from a bird,” Dean admits. “Also, hate to break it to you, but… the beak? Not helping. Bit of a speech impediment. Uh, can you go back to being a guy?”
Sure enough, sixteen year old Dean was begged by a neighboring kingdom to come rid them of a wyvern. Dean suited up and rode off.
. If circumstances were different- Dean realized his thoughts were heading towards ‘I bet if they got to know each other, they’d get along’, and shut that notion down. He hated to see Benny mixed up in this, just as much as Cas, because this was probably not going to end well...
Dean went to get some more coffee, mainly to hide the fact that his hands were shaking slightly. He felt a painful and prickly sensation in his gut, like he’d just been knifed and something he’d never known was there had been carved out. Even Bela and Susan were in love in their fucked-up way. Even John and Mary had been happy amidst the anger and before the pain. Dean and Castiel? Nope. Not gonna happen. The very idea was ridiculous.
Charlie rolls her eyes. “Dude, c’mon, you’re going to make me blush,” she says sardonically. She’s always felt like the little sister Dean never had, down to the whole emotional distance and deflection deal that all true blue Winchesters have cornered.
Now alone, Castiel let his shoulders slump, rubbed his forehead, sighed as he looked at the still vibrating door. He dumped fairy tales on the same cinderheap as romances, so he was quite bewildered to have wandered into one. His role: being the evil stepmother.
Then the angels came down like a hammer. Or so said the resistance. Dean didn’t want to feel like a traitor in his thoughts, he still believed in the cause, but the fact was, when he now visualized that screwed up period, he did not imagine angels striding through throngs of frightened people, dictating orders and throwing their weight around. No, he’d imagine his own garrison - a few nasty pieces of work like Zach and Uriel being dicks, but the others wandering around fruitlessly, with Cas at their head wearing his puzzled and frowny ‘why are you all not making any
A rap on the door brought everyone’s attention there. A guard, one of Michael’s retinue, stuck his head in, gave it a shake and departed.
Sam relaxed and his expression became extremely sour. “Can you please be more careful about what you say when-“
A month ago, Castiel would assume the words were born of ingratitude and ignorance. He’d have even agreed with the sentiment: if Dean had never been born, Castiel would be free to pursue a duty he understood, a work of meaning.
When it reaches 7:42, Castiel stirs. He gets to his feet and walks as if in a dream towards the kitchen.
“Enough talking,” Dean says - almost growls - grabbing Castiel’s jaw and leaning in for a rough, long kiss.
Castiel looked around the circle of faces and then back at Rufus. “You... hadn’t told them? They don’t know you were born several years before the Apocalypse?”
Dean’s attempt at composure is whisked away like a demon’s smoke after a particularly vigorous exorcism and his hand leaps back to cover the Mark. Only for a second. Then he scowls and turns to lean hard against the counter,  pushing against it like the kitchen had started to fall on top of him and he’s now stubbornly forcing it back into place.
He told Cas the angel gives him a reason to live. It’s almost beyond hope that he’ll actually be able to do so… Cas is being very philosophical about the fact that they could have been boning for years now if fate - death, disaster, the usual - hadn't cockblocked them at every turn. The angel seems to think that hooking up happened when it was supposed to. But that's an immortal point of view if Dean ever heard one. Dean can’t be that sanguine about it; the thought of all the years he might have had with Cas versus the countdown of months on his arm keeps him awake every night Cas is not here. So the thought the Mark might fade, that they might have accidentally beaten it, is alluring. He might get out from under it. Cas and Sam might escape the obligation of putting down the rabid thing he’ll become…Shit. It makes him dizzy, he wants it so bad.
“You’ll figure it out,” Dean concludes to both Cas and his own inner beastie who’s just begging to be let off the leash to go throw his weight around on his mate’s behalf. That wouldn’t solve anything, though, and then Jesse and Cesar would kick his ass for disrupting their pack, and John would hold him down. Dean-the-human tells the mutt to go roll in the snow and chill.
Like it’s got a mind of its own, Cas’s thumb is caressing Dean’s mouth, his chin, his nose - the fingers of his other hand flare, leaving the cheek they’re propping up briefly as if to illustrate something in the darkened cabin around them. "I’m supposed to be in the stray beta cabin, remember?"
“-so yeah, hah, I have this, well, almost superstition about sharing the full details of that day. Because if I never say anything, and nobody else knows, then it’s surefire proof that the person who comes forward and repeats my words to me is the person I owe my life to-”
“I know it, boss-man. Night, Cas!” Jo strides off in the direction of her sleep roll. Dean follows her with his eyes, wondering what she was doing - or, being a beta, who she was doing. That’s the problem with having Tyler’s team around, and Sam’s guards too; there’s been a scuffle or two every night as betas unfamiliar with working with each other find their balance, and then after that’s done, there’s been a bit of sorting themselves out the other way; the strong making a point of jumping each other’s bones, taking the conflict into the sheets in pure beta tradition, while the day’s losers have to sit out in the cold, simmering with jealousy. Children, thinks Dean with a patronizing huff (which may go to show he’s got a short memory… but even if he’d be getting up to the same shenanigans this time last year, that don’t signify, he’s matured since then - look how he sorted out his small rift with Sammy with words, like a grownup, see?)
Nobody said anything. Both the advocate and the angel must have figured that if a more serious commandment was to stay intact - thou shalt not kill, for instance - it’d be best for Dean to have a shot of decree-breaking stimulant before he was expected to examine this dog of a situation in any detail.
The demon stupidly stops and tries to squint down at its own collarbone, then tugs at the thongs of the hauberk it hadn’t properly closed. The offering sigil is the opposite in shape and function to the anti-possession tattoo on Castiel’s chest. The Hunters as a rule come with all kinds of decoration inked on their skin, but the flame-and-pentagram is considered a must, even Dean and Sam have one.
I get back, I need to have words with someone about many, many things, but among others, we need to re-think garrisons. If I can get this confused after barely two months stuck with one of these humans, what must the garrisons be like after two centuries...? It’s a wonder they’re not all like the lot at Paradise 342.
“So you are,” said Dean without looking around. “Come on, let’s walk a few hours while the moon is high.”
Kudos, comments and questions much appreciated :) Especially with some upcoming chapters that still need work and are busy fighting me tooth and nail *sigh*
of one vial touching the other was… perturbing. Castiel stood frozen to the spot, wondering how to announce himself and also what she was doing… He wasn’t a superstitious jackass, of course; he read treatises on philosophy regularly. Why, he had a very clever one on his desk right now, regarding the spontaneous generation of salamanders from ditch water and burned wood which he intended to re-read in peace once he had the time. But there was something about Eileen… the way her eyes followed one, the steady way she gazed at people’s features, the wit she showed on her tablet that was so strange coming from this otherwise silent and isolated woman- now she was boiling the liquid, what in heaven’s name was she doing…?
Dean didn't break stride as he headed towards the larder, ducking beneath the festoons of herb and onion garlands hanging from nails in the ceiling. He kicked aside a few empty canvas bags, moved a crate of potatoes and opened the second disused flour bin at the back. Sam hissed a warning, but Dean ignored him. He took out the packet of perfectly illegal coffee and the small grinder from their hiding place, and carried his prizes to the paraffin burner. Then he went to the kitchen pump, hauling at the handle with a bit more force than necessary until water thundered out into the large stone sink and drenched his hand, his sleeve and the percolator’s kettle.
“There’s ways to deal with that,” Jo said in a dead serious tone that had Dean open his mouth for a quick put-down.
In case you find it puzzling, the origin of Lydia's attitude will make sense in a couple of chapters.
Lutecia’s smile slips a little as she catches sight of Castiel over Dean’s shoulder. Castiel’s not sure what expression he makes - he tends not to ‘emote’ much according to his friends, they call him stoney-faced, but if his features aren’t currently expressing his feelings right now, he’s sure his glare is. Lutecia murmurs a question to Dean, who turns and looks startled to see his Hunter commander. Startled and not as pleased as he usually is.
Castiel’s eyes (seriously? Castiel? That’s a name?) flick up and down, a weighing moment. “You do have a floodlight,” he says, and Dean is pleased that the guy’s taking him and his question at face value and not as a verbal trap for further remonstrance. “A wire has been sectioned. I was fixing it.” He holds up a pair of pliers.
Rowena has a delicate lace hanky pressed to her profusely bleeding nose, her hair is a fright and a rip runs up her dress’ seam. Not having been bounced off a wall, she’s still in better shape than Dean.
“Has he ever. I might have to adopt him at this rate. He got wisdom I never heard. One day of talking to the dude and I was expecting Michael Novak to come kicking down our front door to get him back. He’s got perfect recall. Everything he’s ever read is right in that head of his, and he’s been let loose for years in Salt Lake City’s libraries and schools. Guy's got more knowledge in one pinkie than all our packs combined. But apparently Novaks don’t like a know-it-all. Especially one who can tell you all about the history of the nail but can’t hammer one for shit. Cesar had to teach him. Good thing he learns quick."
Zachariah was interrupted in his attempt to squirm out from under this situation and make it someone else’s responsibility. On the desk closest to the door was a tray of teacups for humans who came in to consult with the garrison. Dean Winchester hooked one up with his free hand and hurled it with great precision at Uriel’s head.
Another angel died in a gaping scream of light, the mid-afternoon sunshine dimming by comparison. Not anyone near Dean, no, one of those furthest away from him, behind all the others and in blade’s reach of Cas.
“Why didn’t you tell me right away?!” Sam shouts. “Wait- I’ll call back- “ A click, then the beep of a phone’s buttons being punched. “Dean?! Are you home yet? Shit!
“It is such a wonderful time to be alive! You babes cannot appreciate it!” Rowena sings out rapturously as she waltzes around the room, picking up burp towels and bibs and a book of pastel colors and putting them down again in different and not noticeably better spots.
“Remember, you can’t call him on it, he’d deny it. I trust you to find other ways of making his life hell. I can give you ideas if you want,” Balthazar said brightly, leaning forward again and reaching for Communion. “Now for the other side of this equation. Here, join me, it’s easier to dig around when you can cut through the Word's authorization layers.”
“The wires were nailed in taut, anything could have snapped them, snow being pushed under the crawlspace, racoons - probably not mice, they prefer the indoors.”
Michael shut up and fixed wide eyes on the face that matched his own, bar the jagged sneer and the all-black eyes. Dean, smoke still gently wafting off of him, finished unfolding from the twisted lunge that he pulled out of every last bit of hatred and bloodymindedness he’d ever possessed, alive or dead, to rear up, rip the Blade from the back of his jeans and plunge it where it belonged.
“I’m fine,” Charlie says quickly like a reflex, even though she’s sunk onto the laundry basket and her eyes were closing before she snapped them open. “Sam only left yesterday. I can lead high level raids for two days and nights straight with enough coffee, snacks and internet connection, so I can watch a baby for twelve hours. You’re the one who looks tired.”
Silence. A silence that says almost as clearly as Dean could, ‘You’re the least superstitious man I know, why are you of all people talking about fate?’
Dean can't help a chuckle. “Yeah, that sums him up. Weirdest mix, right? Knowledgeable, but weirdly naive about pack basics at times.”
. That’s how animals better their packs, and us too. And it’s more, it’s… I mean, I’m glad we moved away from the time when an alpha assumed he or she was allowed to stick it into anything, but y’know, sex
A year ago, a beta brute would have growled, “John ordered me to bring ya, no thanks needed.” John did order him to take Cas here, but today’s Dean would have done it anyway.
“I’m Dean Winchester,” says Dean. “Deputy of alpha Hunter Victor Henricksen, Winchester pack. This is our territory.”
“The fact that she disappeared before we could get to her proves that the human had arcane means of escape. You know what that signifies.” Yeah, only the resistance knew that kind of trick...
A scant three weeks passed between Michael summoning Castiel to his office with a ‘you won’t believe this’, to standing in front of the head of Eden’s church, hand in hand with a virtual stranger. Three weeks would be fast for any wedding not involving a pregnancy and pitchfork-wielding parents; for a royal wedding, it was ludicrous. But king Dean, Castiel would learn, was not the kind to waste time once a decision was made, especially not on ‘fol-de-rol crap’, and Michael had obliged his soon-to-be brother by marriage. Maybe he was afraid Dean might change his mind if given time to think about it.
The boy puts his fingers in his mouth (absorbing a large quantity of mud and various other substances) and sucks them with a wet sound. His nose and chin are covered in snot, and his eyes are still swimming with tears, but he’s calm now, focusing on Castiel to the exclusion of anything else.
“We do, we do! You’re Dean Winchester, you used to be - I mean, you probably still are a hunter, this version of you. A hunter of monsters and stuff, and you met the angels during the apocalypse. I mean, not you, you, but the other you, our version of you.”
. In the cold light of day, he couldn’t remember what he’d known so overwhelmingly anymore. “Mesquite whiskey from ol’ Ma Stanton,” he added as explanation to both himself and the Millers.
where they only ever had an alpha and, very occasionally, a father, but this is just because life is a little easier now, their dad can afford to relax a little and spoil his youngest ever so slightly. It sucks for Dean and Sam that they were born in the lean years of the camp and their father’s affection, but nobody can be said to be to blame exactly.
“Urgle,” said Kevin, or something to that effect. Tom took a philosophical swig of tea (herbal, because the angels were assholes and one of them had decided that real tea and coffee contained something bad back when Bobby was a kid.)
Before he made deputy, Dean knew what that was like. Indeed, he might have been the one clawing at her door, he’s done it often enough in the past. At this point, though, all that goes through his mind is: ‘Really, woman? It’s not even four o’clock and I got shit to do.’ It sucks being responsible, sometimes. Betas may be up for it at any time of the day and night, especially after a successful hunt that’s riling up some basic ‘we provided, now we fuck!’ instinct deep inside, but a deputy has, well, a lot of shit to do. The boots are just the start, he’s only cleaning ‘em so he’s not tracking mud everywhere as he goes about his other duties; after this he’s gotta distribute bullet- and arrow-making duty, get more gunpowder from Bobby over in Makers, check in with Victor and make sure alpha's squad don’t need anything before leaving on their own long patrol...
Though of course there’s nothing wrong with having love handles. Perfect for giving someone a really nice grip...
The blue eyes centered on the hand Dean had stuffed in his pocket, palm oozing a few drops of blood. “You’re injured,” Cas said softly in that rumbly voice of his that seemed inexplicably gentle and intimate even when ten feet away on the other side of a stile.
There’s a raging battle inside Dean. All his past experience of sorcerers suggests the dude is selling him some wholesale baloney. But Dean’s instincts are all telling him otherwise. There’s just something about the way the guy talks. There’s no oily desire to persuade, there’s hardly any human communication at all, the guy is as blunt as a hammer and just about as charming, while power radiates off of him like fire, and he can’t even be bothered to threaten… Dean probably shouldn’t be listening, yet he does, keeping an open mind. After all, Swan Prince was certainly confused, his memory more full of holes than an old cheese in a pantry full of mice… Dean still holds his sword at the ready, but takes his tone down a notch.
, human, or your penance will make this whole filthy city weep. You are already due for punishment for your infractions tonight, you-“
“Oh we agree on that, it was a complete fabrication born of necessity. But Azazel and his Croatoans were kicking our derrieres and threatening hundreds of Paradises. We didn’t have enough angelic troops to combat all the fronts Azazel created, we needed some good human fighters to supplement our strategies. And so what did it matter that she was married and the mother of two kids? There was no way a warrior and general of Mary Campbell’s caliber would be left to rot at home. Mind you, she could have fought it. We thought she would. She didn’t. Seriously, Cassie, I spoke to a couple of angels who knew her back then. She wanted to go.”
Magnificent terrible beings with the power of angels and the freedom of men striding across a battlefield. Castiel has killed two of them before - three, counting the one Metatron led him to.
The guy on the floor gives his strewn belongings a swift look but doesn't complain. Either Dean put the fear of god in him or… Dean himself goes over to check, moving goods brusquely aside without regards. There’s bundles of woven cloth tightly wrapped in twine, colors you don’t see around here. Fist-size oil-skin bags peek out amongst the folds of cloth, maybe the dyes used, a good item to trade. There’s some average-looking skinning knives, a small keg of gunpowder, a folder of stiff hide that contains decent-looking paper. A bag tied to the saddlebag goes clink when Charlie toes it, that’ll be the trader currency: strips of copper, tin, lead and such, as well as bits of gold and silver, turquoise and sea-shells if this guy visits packs who can afford a lil’ luxury like that.
“You’re a bloody stubborn son of a bitch,” Dean growled, getting up from where he was kneeling by the bed. “I’m gonna need more light. Kerosene lamp ain’t gonna cut it.”
“No, I don’t think they are, and they won’t be able to follow us soon. But we might as well get in out of the rain.”
“Oh, we’d be doing them a favor. Wait till this kid goes full Damien on their nuts, they’ll be begging us to help.”
The look he got could be bottled and used to clean the Roadhouse bar counter. Dean bared his teeth in a humorless grin and looped an arm around her shoulders.
He said it very precisely, steady and self-assured to the hilt, but Dean - who could start to feel his fingers again - now knew that this fucking archangel was, on top of everything else, completely cuckoo. From the stony gaze Cas was giving him off to one side, he’d cottoned on to it too.
‘You are cordially invited to the witch’s cottage where your brother is waiting for you, hale and unharmed. Make a wish where you almost fell, but hurry, or the four and twenty blackbirds will eat all the breadcrumbs.
”...Why do you say that? Are you saying you’re starting to connect with Dean and you miraculously understand all his little quirks and foibles?”
“I still don’t think he’s coming back,” she murmurs, leaning forward again, elbows on the table in a way that lifts and highlights the goods. This time Dean manages to keep his eyes on hers. They are remarkably clear. She isn't a blowsy drunk or a barfly; she's classy in a black dress, tasteful jewelry, the look of an exec of some kind unwinding on a Friday night. It's explicitly clear in every line of her body that the unwinding mechanism she is contemplating is right in front of her eyes.
“Okay.” Dean shouldered the pack he and Bobby had prepared. Bobby looked almost his age tonight, worry he would not admit to carving his cheeks and taking the light out of his eyes.
A leaf on a still day wouldn’t nod more than Cas does in response to that before he turns away. “I need to set up. Excuse me.”
happening, then when is Cas gonna start fucking and who is he gonna fuck first? Folks are giving this question the same importance as ‘how are we all gonna eat come the spring?’, and if Dean gets asked about it one more time he is gonna shoot the person askin’.
“You hate everything about this new world! You hate what was done to us, this injustice forced on us by those- those scientists playing god!”
Dean sat himself down on the edge of the bed and looked around. This wasn’t a perfect copy of his room. Not only was he missing a window, he was missing that whole section, as the walls here angled differently. Which meant that Cas hadn’t created the couch near the window either, there wasn’t really any space for it.
Those firm, chapped lips pinch. Cas straightens, but only so far as to look Dean in the chest. “I thought traders were quarantined.”
Cas stared at him and Dean stared back. Apparently Cas had witnessed Dean’s feelings but not understood their implication as they related to himself. Dean opened his mouth-
“Get up,” Castiel prompted, glad once more that he’d arrogated this duty to himself alone. Servants should not see their liege in this manner, and Castiel was quite happy to be the only one to watch a bed-headed king roll over to give him a sleep-besmirched stink eye.
“Well, I got ‘em sorted now,” Dean summarizes, not going into the details of the issues he’s been having trying to fit Cole in a team - after the enemies he’s made - without putting him in with Lydia, and of course Benny’s bombshell- but that’s his hairshirt to wear. At several times in the past four days, as he was juggling temperaments, past rivalries, ranks and roles, he had to remind himself that he wasn’t going to put this together and then bring the result to Vic or to John for evaluation. From now on, Dean’s decisions are final, and so are the consequences if he gets it wrong. The plans he will be drawing up at the desk next to Cas’s in Vic’s- in their cabin’s little office will be the plans that will see the Hunters sink or swim. The buck stops here.
“It’s fine, Dean, he’s receiving revelations. Hey, what do you think of this picture? Think he’d mind if I put
“Not around for now, but I have a feeling he’ll be back. He’ll keep an eye on the family. So are we. He might be tempted to tinker again. That’ll give us the chance for a little... talk with him.”
“Really? How’s this for open and honest. Sooner or later, Cas, my side is going to figure out what to do with this. We got smart humans on our end.” Like the Joker. That was why Dean was holding up and holding out. This was fucking unique leverage he had here, potentially, and somebody like the Joker could surely find something smarter to do with it than order Dean to commit suicide just to make a point and show up the Machine as fallible. “I won’t go against my word to not physically attack you or another angel even on their say-so, but trust me, we will find a way to make this work for us.”
… but that damned chivalry kicks in. Dean’s not above eliminating a human or human shaped creature that’s out for his blood, he’s got as many bandits notched onto his belt as monsters, but the steps the sorcerer took to warn him away and chase him off - the multiple efforts, however insulting - mean that Dean has to at least make a halfway decent effort to battle him to a standstill and give him a chance to surrender. If the guy accepts to lift his curses, then he can go and live in another tower, a special one in Lawrence meant for his kind and warded up the hoo-ha, until King John can sit in trial, hear a list of his crimes and pass judgment.
Ah, that explained a lot. “This is your doing,” Castiel concluded, a flash of wings in the higher spheres indicating the garrison and by extension Castiel’s presence here.
it’s a slope, maybe I’ll shorten you a couple of hooves on the right side and see if that helps straighten you out, would you like that? Bloody nightmare beast, next time I better get a horse, or a proper-”
The only answer to that is an ill-tempered growl. Dean presses down harder. Cole’s face must be picking up streak marks that match the broken concrete.
“Oh? What kind?” asks Dean vaguely, professional curiosity kicking in while most of his mind is busy trying to weigh where this guy falls exactly on the Evil scale, and if he’s not closer to Hard Done By.
It’s not like anyone would know I murdered him under a truce flag apart from my guys, and they’ll be 100% behind me, thinks Dean, but doesn’t say it. Because Cas is right; maybe they’re all monkeys scratching each other for lice, but they’re not backstabbing bastards or their society fundamentally wouldn’t work. He doesn’t even want to think what kind of civilisation this Lucifer character would build. Yikes.
“Cas, we could play this several ways. We can do cloak and dagger shit, lie, pretend to play nice then stab each other in the back- we can make our lives absolute hell, but I don’t think that’d really change the bottom line all that much. Can I be honest instead?”
Too irritated to argue after a long day and a tedious banquet, Dean fixed Castiel with the glare of a king who’d battled for years, commanded armies and made seasoned soldiers quail with one sharp look if they failed to obey his orders.
Dean and Sam looked at the worn carpet, which was as clean as the Machine dictated but still had had feet cross it all day.
“Yeah, yeah. Sam! Get!” Intellectually, Dean knows Cas will stay in the bunker as instructed until the third or fourth apocalypse rolls around (which one are they at now?) but instinctively he does not want to take a chance.
“I didn’t. He insisted he should go. I suggested we play rock-paper-scissors for it. He chose rock while I chose to jump through the open rift,” said Cas with a shrug.
“I am saying that I hunt rogue elements who come down to earth without permission from the entirety of the Host,” says Castiel, turning away. “Do you know her name?”
“Better than jail, but not by much, I think.” Dean scratches the back of his head. “When Cas said ‘entrusted with an important mission’, I heard ‘community service’. Picking up angel roadkill alongside the highway sort of thing.”
Jo hesitates because she’s still a kid, still finding that line of independence between herself and her mom (one that looked a lot like a battle line for a long time, mind you.) But then she runs on ahead to say hi. Dean leads the omegas up the last part of the slope, then he stays outside to supervise as they unload the mule cart.
Cole shoots her a nasty look, but doesn’t follow through physically or else Dean would throw the ‘keep Cole’s humiliation private’ plan outta the window right away. “I can’t believe all of you!” he rages. “This is
guardians, we’re not fucking sheep to keep penned. Yeah, you know what? Some of us are bored, because you have us in a bloody zoo!” Dean gesticulated wildly. “How many people have gone to the front line just to feel alive rather than half asleep in this - this constant daydream?”
. We’re not supposed to invent or improve stuff because that’d imply there’s things to improve, and everything around here is
Dean leans back to have a look at the object on Cas’s other side. It’s about the size of a bowie knife down one end and a skinner knife on the other.
“It’s alright,” Castiel says softly, talking over the little head on his shoulder. “I know you couldn't take the chance. Not with this. Especially when I tried to kill the last cambion I met. And being the… how did you put it? Heaven’s hitman? I can see-”
“Dean knows-.... aaah... Dean knows I’ve done nothing wrong and so you’ll release-” Sam choked on bile.
That does not reassure the seraph. He looks around as if he might miraculously find himself within range of an international airport instead of deep in a mountainous forest. The only functional means of transportation he can see is the beaten-down Lada some garagist in Ibarra had been very pleased to sell him. “Could you wait until I get back? You have Rowena captive now, so surely-”
“Can’t say I’m all impressed with- Cas? You okay?” Dean shelved the sarcastic ‘not what I expected’ comment when he saw the look of pain on the angel’s face, pale in the gloom fitfully illuminated by lanterns their escort had brought.
There are also those times, few and precious, where the solitary talks delve deeper. Dean’s told him what it was like growing up the eldest son of King John of Lawrence after his mother’s death; how he was coronated at the tender age of fifteen, and had to be both mother, father, king and brother to Samuel, and indeed to an entire country, and how Dean feels like he’s losing himself in all this sometimes, diluted like wine in too much water (at which point he rides with the Hunters for a while and ‘bashes demons until the feeling goes away, works every time’.) He also shared his private opinion on hereditary royalty: which, to summarize Dean’s argument, ‘blows’. A surprising philosophy for a monarch, Castiel opined, at which point he learned that Dean is merely waiting for the first quiet year after the demon wars to rebuild Lawrence’s government from the ground up, turning it into an elective monarchy. Hence his effort to populate the noble class with ‘fellows who have their head screwed on right’. It’s also the reason he refuses all the marriage alliances from other kingdoms his privy council pushes on him, as that would give another monarchy a stake in Lawrence’s. Sam will still be Dean’s heir until further notice, but in this scenario, he or Dean’s descendants won’t automatically inherit the throne, they will have to be chosen by a council of nobles and burgermeisters. Because the traditional system ‘is crap, why should someone get to say what everyone else has to do just because they get squeezed out by the right dame?’
Gabe rubbed his chin. “Hm. Well, we’re too far down in hell for Mike to find us, so yeah, they might be okay. For awhile. Cassie, don’t do anything stupid,” he added quickly. “Was that your plan all along? Bring Dean to the resistance HQ, make sure Sam was in no danger, and then go back by yourself and try to sort out what’s going on at the risk of getting shredded when you showed up without them? Keep them safe at the cost of your life?”
“I’ll start looking around for a place to camp then.” Castiel judged that he had mastered a fair amount of woodsman craft these past days of following Dean. He was starting to know what to look for in places where a human could put down a bedroll and rest. A lack of ant nests was a starter.
“Good man.” Dean pats him on the back - carefully so Cas won’t take a spill like last time - and then hangs back in order to keep an eye on their six. Ginny, the canny girl, is following Cas closely in his tracks; he flattens the snow so much, even here at the back of the convoy, that she can avoid wasting too much of her energy plowing through the powdery white stuff herself. Sometimes she noses up ahead to give an unsuspecting Cas a questioning sniff as if wondering why he's huffing and puffing so much, but then she falls back again and stays at Dean’s side, vigilant.
“He’s always so… cold, but that time, he got angry. It had something to do about the citizenry, the ones asleep in the beds of brambles, but I… I can’t remember. Nowadays, he only comes to ask me once again to reconsider pledging him my loyalty. When I refuse, he…”
The alpha weighs the two women, then Dean. Something ever-so-subtle in his scent shifts. Dean’s got the intuition that the tiny confrontation has not gone as the stranger expected. Neither did the way the team regrouped and rallied under Dean so well, closing ranks and leaving very few chinks in the defenses.
“Whoa... that’s the tree,” Dean concluded, steps slowing as his gaze wandered higher and higher. There were a dozen bird’s nests in the mighty branches above their heads; a riot of birdsong greeted them as they approached.
Dean snorted, he didn’t need no angel to tell him that. He gave Bobby a clap on the shoulder and a brief “take care of Jo and Ellen, ‘kay?” Rufus was already gone, he had railroad damage to manage now.
Bobby leaned back in his chair, tilted his chin up and gave the angel a long cool stare, as if the critter didn’t even deserve the effort of full-on antagonism.
“Wait, Cas, it might be-” But then Dean’s gut rang the alarm. There was something wrong about the way that stranger walked.
It’s said without the slightest whiff of condescension or mockery, it’s just straightforward, the working man accepting to step up and do his job. Castiel, who took a lot of mockery for his sexuality in his youth, feels faintly grateful that this man doesn’t think lightly of him for standing on a table because of an animal a tenth his size.
“Hm. Figures. Got a great weapon there and you lot are too-... too stuck up in your ivory tower of rules and self-righteousness to use it.” Dean still hadn’t turned around. “Thing is, the stories don’t do it justice. Not when you hear a first hand account. That makes it real. Knowing what-... knowing that happened to someone you see every day. That makes it real. It’s been churning my guts for the past hour. I... I feel stupid for saying this. For not realizing. I guess you think I’m dumb. Ignorant. A baby in a cowboy hat.”
want to leave Winchester to find a new pack to lord it over. But transitioning up… that’d explain why he’s still boss-dog but with lesser libido; alphas only really get going during heat season.
“Yes. Balthazar.” Castiel hesitated - and he thoroughly hated the words that he was about to say, the very thought that he needed to express. “I… think that… ”
Castiel stops two feet away. When he doesn’t say anything, one of Dean’s eyelids hoists up to half-mast.
He takes a step away from Dean. The hunter rolls over, surges to his feet- yells when his broken knee twists beneath him and compounds the injury. He hits the sand again, eyes glazing over with pain and the effects of concussion. Castiel flinches, but reins in his instinct to go help; Dean is badly injured, but his life is not in immediate danger and there is a much, much greater problem on this beach.
Cas gave him an arch look. “You don’t have to look, you can sense him with your mind. I’ve told you before, you need to work on your abilities.”
A second later, Cas’s weapon, whirring hilt over blade, struck the creature in the throat, sending it crashing into the dust. The Croat flailed, the scream now a gurgle. Cas was there three heartbeats later, yanking his blade free and looking around. He turned towards Dean -
“But I didn’t say anything,” says Sammy, an obvious lie as his whole smarmy expression is one long soliloquy. He ruins it even further by adding, “I bet dad would be happy to know how our ‘useless wandering’ has turned into one more attempt to get you hooked to royalty. At this point the old man is so desperate, he won’t even care that Swan Prince is a guy, he’ll take the opportunity to get you settled down whatever it takes. This place may not seem like much at this juncture, after a century of neglect, but it could become an important waypoint for merchants traveling east to west once this cursed forest is dealt with, so it would even make a decent dowry… Hmm, Dean, do you think we should detour by town first?
Looking at his slumbering spouse’s back, Castiel felt an odd lump form in his throat. It’d have been hard to be married off to a repulsive older man. But neither was it easy, Castiel found, to
“... You and Sam… peas in a pod… shit… “ Dean sinks his head further into the crook of Castiel’s neck, and the angel feels more than hears ‘Such a bad idea’ moving against his skin.
“Language!” Bobby rapped out. “That I did not teach him, if you want to know,” he groused in the direction of the angel.
A touch on his arm stopped him as he took a few steps away from the barn. Balthazar’s face was unreadable as he stared at Dean.
“One of the rogues, before I-... caught him. He hid this from us, you understand, we didn’t know. He, they, he and the human he was with, they had a child. A nephilim.”
“Michael did not kill her. But...” Oh dear, this was not something Castiel was comfortable explaining. “Anna... Annael, I mean, she loved this planet, loved humans. She saw so much potential in them. I do not know-... The death toll of the apocalypse, it hurt her deeply. She felt responsible - that we were all responsible for it, for not doing more. She even-” She’d blamed their Father for the Plan, but Castiel was not going to say
With a bare motion of his eyes, Sam directs Dean’s attention to the slice of moon that has just appeared in the twilight sky. “No, that’s why he changed back. I’m sorry, your highness, the curse is still set on you, I could feel it operate the transformation. My efforts had no effect.”
In short order, battle lines were drawn, troops massed at the border, hostile forays took place, and the castle became a battlefield before Michaelmas. Everyone from the stablemaster’s apprentice to Dame Ellen were aware of it (and amused, to Castiel’s resigned irritation), the exception being Dean. It was understood by both princes, in this otherwise no-holds-barred war of theirs, that Dean was not to be disturbed. They didn’t want to add to a king’s burden. Besides, the one who roped in Dean would be conceding he couldn’t manage the other one alone, and neither of the combatants’ pride could abide the thought.
“So Crowley told you all about his old pack, and who leads the Demons now.” Alastair returns from his mind-trip of torturing Crowley to fix Dean with a satisfied look drenched in sadism. “Then he must have told you I can see the future.”
That sure scored high on the bullshit meter. The world had just flipped like a pancake, dropping Dean out of a strip joint in Albuquerque and into a circle of candles and sigils chalked onto the concrete floor of a dusty disused warehouse. Dean had been in the act of slipping a dollar bill to a girl wearing nothing but a cowboy hat, sequined chaps and a tong. The bill was still in his fingers, but the sexy cowgirl had been replaced by a couple of dirty guys. Nothing ‘fine’ with this picture.
The swan gives an ungainly hop that splashes it from the bank back into the water, where it floats with a stark contrasting grace. The light of a gibbous moon pouring over the lake touches its feathers, which shine ghostly white in the darkness of the night.
in some sort of stockings, and she had a bustle full of large ribbons on the back and she was leaning forward so he could see her- bloody hell, just looking at this broke five decrees.
“We have a city, you know. A real one. Brick and mortar buildings with a temple in the center - this is not an old city we renovated, we built it brick by brick and called it New Eden. The lesser compounds - named after the tribes of Israel, if you believe it - are in a circle around the city at halfday distance by horse, crude camps much like this one-” Dean’s eyebrows twitch but ‘brick and mortar’ and a temple does cast shade on Winchester’s wooden amalgam. “They each have their specialisation in what they mine, farm or produce, while New Eden, controlling them from the center, is touted as a paradise, a beacon of purity and civilisation, one step away from Our Savior. The more godly of the betas are regularly rotated from the outer compounds to the city to be closer to him - to Michael Novak, our leader after God. As a reward, they say, which just reinforces the dogma, and when their turn is up they’re sent back to another tribe afterwards, which stops them from forming partisan relations in one single camp that might supersede their loyalty to Michael. It’s a transparent means of control, but nobody seems to realize it.”
But Dean doesn't leap forward for further attempts at a raccoon round-up, he’s side eyeing Castiel in a strange way and his face is doing something odd.
He’s only distantly aware of Sam beating a hasty exit with an overloud “Ew!”, then shouting from the corridor beyond, “Do that somewhere else! Some of us want coffee and breakfast!”
That last part was a slip, he suspects. Hannah quickly wrapped up the call after that, speaking tersely.
Cas checks him over - Dean’s grateful he thought to cover the bloody arm of his jacket with his poncho and pull on his gloves, because he doesn’t want to distract his mate. As expected, as soon as he sees Dean’s safe and sound, Cas focuses past him to the approaching stretcher. His face tightens and he leaves Dean standing to go meet the Hunters straggling towards the beta sleeping cabin. Cas doesn’t stop them but lifts the blanket over Vic. His face is real serious as he glances down at the alpha’s legs.
“Omegas are the basic workforce of any community,” Cas says in a didactic tone, “providing labor without any say in the leadership of how that work is applied and what for. There’s only two ways to keep that kind of system going. Our natural passivity and the hormonal control exerted by the Hierarchy can only go so far to control us, especially since omegas tend to be the most numerous in a pack. So you either enslave them, keep them down, constantly destroy their morale with institutionalized beatings, rapes-”
“With Cassie here? A fair amount. He’s a good soldier, mind you, he’s naturally obedient and can smite as hard as the next guy in line when you ask him to, but he’s one of those who likes to think, and Mike, well, he’s paranoid. Naomi rewrites a lot of angels on a regular basis, particularly the Seraphim, but any of my brothers with half a brain and a propensity to ask questions tend to get regular visits to her office... Some of them break, you know. After awhile. They just… lose something. Die a bit inside-”
“Let’s just say I misfiled a report into the best of hands.” Balthazar gave his famously charming smile. “Though I never expected my yelps of alarm to reach the military arm of the Host. I wonder who boosted that report up the ladder in your direction...? I was aiming for Elijah, or someone from the Decrees department, it seems more their bailiwick. Strange... but a pleasant surprise. Ah, as long as I didn’t drag you away from anything important.”
Naomi broke away from her staring contest with Cas to give the revolver in Dean’s hands a look reserved for the worst demon from the deepest pit in hell. “That. I wish I’d never found it.”
Eileen stood there, surprisingly, holding a candelabra and her tablet onto which she had already written:
“Kid,” Samuel said softly and seriously into the rim of his bottle, “everything you’re about to say to me, I’ve said to myself every day for the past fortnight and more. Trust me. You being here with your, ah... what’s the term used these days? Where two fellas are concerned? 'cause back in my day, lemme tell you-”
Sam’s voice rises to an impressive crescendo of gibberish (he insists it’s Latin) until one final proclamation rings out over the peaceful waters of the lake: “Confractus!”
There is a moment of silence in which Castiel can hear Garth and Benny stir outside, but they don’t come in. Castiel and Dean could be alone in the universe right this minute...
The less said about Castiel’s time in Eden, the better. It wasn’t too bad while his father was alive. Charles - or Chuck as his family affectionately knew him - was decent enough, if somewhat vague and prone to letting his cabinet rule while he piddled with attempts at writing. Life didn’t get truly tiresome until Charles was gone and his eldest son Michael ascended the throne.
Michael’s full attention shifted to Cas. “Is that why you came here? Did you think you could assassinate me, you and this… foul creature?”
“...I think that’s why I was so… upset with Cesar,” Cas finally says. “I… my head is so full of-... agitation. I
“It’s okay - it’s okay, they’re thick -” Castiel quickly wipes away the lasagna from his pants with the salad tongs. His thighs are getting a bit hot, but he’ll live. The raccoon, though…
Sam shoves him. Dean hip-checks him back. Sam returns to rooting around the toiletry kit, his grin now spread out like a banner.
He sits there for two days. He moves once, to remove a fly that somehow wandered into the bunker and is buzzing repeatedly against a lamp, thinking it’s a window to daylight and salvation.
“Ledgers fighting back? Don’t know how you spend all your time working on that shit. I’m serious, Cas, you really don’t have to wear that if you don’t-”
Dean gives him a cockeyed look over the board he’s holding steady for him. “That’s one way of looking at it. The other drawback is: too small and your pack is defenceless against raiders, and too big, it’ll rip itself apart.” A bigger pack needs more betas to protect, direct and feed ‘em, but they’re a volatile lot. If an alpha can’t dominate them properly, make them
,” Dean added, taking a step back and contemptuously smacking Castiel’s shoulder with the back of his hand, “fair warning. Gag me again and I will stab you in the throat.”
“I am not bothered,” says Castiel serenely, getting to his feet to go straighten up one of the fallen pew. Dean takes this as an invitation to join him, and they sit side by side in silence for a while, looking at the stained glass window. The artist’s faith shines through in the pains he took, though sadly it outstripped his talent; the dove looks like a strangled chicken and the bowl’s mangled perspective manages to ruffle even Castiel’s angelic patience.
It didn’t make his argument wrong, however. It did not make his words a lie. Uriel would lash out because he would not want to face that, but it was there anyway. The very fact that Dean, a strong vibrant soul, who should have been one of the brightest ornaments of their new world, hated it here so much... was a failure.
“He’ll join you outside, just drop him a prayer,” Balthazar said in lieu of any other greeting. He stayed standing in the gathering twilight outside the barn, where the wards had been reset.
“I’m glad you didn’t,” says Dean prosaically, taking off his belt and starting on his various upper layers. “I know Cesar is over ten years older n’ you and looks like a pussycat, but sweetheart, he would flatten you.”
“Who the devil are you?” Colt started, then decided he didn’t like the angry look the guy was giving him, or the way dust rose in wild swoops all around him as if Colt’s indifferent housekeeping was rising up in his defence. Colt lowered his gun and fired into the bastard’s left patent leather boot. This was Wyoming, not Connecticut. The law was on the side of the man with the fastest draw.
Glass. Fucking glass. It was all over the place in the mythical Old World, they just loved to use the stuff. Now you have to scavenge out its relics, windows and broken bottles and such (but only the right kind) or else you have to mess around sifting sand, limestone and potash to cook it direct in a kiln - a fucking charcoal-burning kiln, the most expensive coal-muncher in the entire camp. Other betas outside Makers wouldn’t think about this, but John’s eldest has seen more of the inner workings of the camp than they have. He can
It didn’t make a difference. Even with his eyes closed, he knew where Cas was. He could feel every inch of the space between them, he could measure the distance in his mind. As he felt himself drifting off with the ability of the soldier to sleep at any time, anywhere, that ball of feelings deep inside him ached subtly as if reminded him that this was not the distance at which he’d gone to sleep a few days ago after the attack, when Cas had been lying at his side, breathing softly and watching him in silence....
Now, originally this was going to be the end of the fic. The theme of the work is that Dean never does connect Cas with his savior, this little thread of plot remains unpulled, never resolved as sometimes happens in real life, and this might be a good thing in final; gratitude and a life debt are dangerous connections to mix with love, etc.
“I recall that you tried,” Castiel points out. “You probably should have tried harder,” he adds, looking down morosely at the hardwood floor.
Castiel spins on his heels and runs towards the treeline. The demons immediately burst into pursuit, as unable to help themselves as a cat spotting a scurrying mouse. Castiel makes it to the trunk of a large sprawling oak at the edge of the clearing a mere moment before the first in a disorderly line of his pursuers reaches him. They split up to bypass the tree, expecting him to keep on fleeing through the woods, because humans always run away from them.
“But I’m glad you railroaded Sam and came yourself, there’s angel trouble on this side of reality, Sam would be a bit out of his league.”
In a spot not five feet away, that Dean was ready to swear on a stack of bibles as big as himself had been empty two seconds before, was a bubble of familiar-looking glass with clockwork inside. It was similar to the one that floated over P342, though maybe half the size. It hovered two feet above the fresh grass beneath it, and rose to a little over head height. Okay. Fine. At this point Dean had stopped wondering how or why. Now he just had to wonder what to do next.
Wákida, now, Clancy’s predecessor, Wákida was a terror, a dark shadow following Victor’s every move like the sentinel he was named for in Ioway; the epitome of a hunter’s hound. He’d been seven, in his prime and strong, it never occured to Victor that he should be training up a successor. But some fever ran through the camp late last winter; it started with the pigs, but then somehow the dogs caught it. Dozens sickened and ten died, including Wákida. It will take a year and a lot of training for Clancy to grow up to fill those mighty paw prints… until then, Victor will have to go dogless, but since every other hunter owns a mutt, there are enough sharp noses and bared teeth to cover him.
Vic is a scary serious guy, and the hunters are well disciplined when it matters… but they’re pack above all. The crisp military air dissolves into chuckles, good natured ribbing and cries of ‘awww!’
That affords him an affronted glare which honesty burns away, leaving nothing but a cinder of embarrassment. Cas mutters something almost covered by the vigorous scrub of the brush, Dean only catches ‘two years ago’, ‘nearly’ and ‘beta Lydia’, and he suddenly thinks this conversation makes sense.
“Shh. You sure are noisy. Then again, who am I to talk, look who I work for...” Balthazar poked absently at his ear. Blood was trickling from it too. Dean was the only one in the lot who wasn’t injured, though he felt like he’d picked up a sunburn on his face.
“I’m working all around this compound for the upcoming month, I’m sure we’ll run into each other,” says Cas with a faint smile.
“Okay, my turn. Hmm.” Dean negotiated a sharp slope, pulling himself up with the help of a jutting tree root. Then a hand appeared in front of his face. He looked up. “I thought you can’t fly anymore, now that someone might miss us.”
“Yeah, that’s the point.” They were waiting for night to fall before they moved. Day, night, it was all the same to angels, but it was not all the same to their human devotees who just loved working for the garrison. All bystanders, innocent or otherwise, would be at home or in bed once night fell. Besides, many spells and signals worked better in the dark.
“Was that what you had to say to me?” Castiel leaned back against the chair a little. Dean couldn’t tell how much this news inconvenienced him. He hadn’t really thought that Cas might use him - subtly, overtly or indeed any way - to track down the resistance or the railroad. He’d been relying on his trapped head, and on the protection of this marriage. He still wasn’t sure if Cas had been planning anything, he didn’t seem angry or disappointed, but Bobby had burned the bridge anyway.
stream by inevitably. Dean felt like his face was going to combust and he was now the one unable to meet Cas’s gaze, preferring to stare down at a button on his duster.
Castiel didn’t stay to speculate, he was home a second later, making Dean drop a jug in the kitchen in surprise.
“Angels are trying to get into the Dome, and Gabriel is making a fuss in New Jerusalem.” But Castiel’s arms wouldn’t let go either. “It could get nasty out there. People here don't deserve that, they'll soon have more than enough problems to contend with. We… we need to go.”
“The fact that we’re both out here? No, that’d be the Joker’s fault. The fact that we’re married isn’t my say-so either, but that’s not on Cas. Put the goddamned gun away, Benny, I’m telling you.”
And you left without finding out what she wants - you dunce! They’re all blind, but instead of lending them your vision-
Car idling half a block away, Castiel watches the magical battle that breaks out next to a white picket fence and a couple of ugly plastic flamingos. That has to be Rowena, there can only be one witch in town with that kind of power. But why is she fighting the demons looking for the cambion? He thought she’d be interested in the faction gunning for Crowley. Does she have plans for the creature that do not involve a revolution in hell? And an even better question, Castiel reflects as a burnt pink plastic wing goes scything over the hood of his car: who exactly in this scenario is he supposed to be siding with…?
Dean was out the door as soon as he heard the hiss-bang behind him, knowing that would catch the Seraph’s attention for a few precious seconds.
“Awesome.” He levered himself up into a seated position and looked down at Cas’s bare back, which still looked mighty fine in the light of day. Perhaps even more so. It’d been awhile since Dean had gotten laid, and he’d better get used to that state of affairs, he reminded himself. Cas, pure and prudish feather-duster that he was, probably wouldn’t care who Dean had a discreet fling with as long as it wasn’t him, but Dean wasn’t going to drag any poor sap into committing this kind of adultery; there had to be a special name for the sin of cheating on an angel.
Dean was staring straight ahead, his shoulders as rigid as scripture beneath Castiel’s arm. “Cas. You ever touch me again without permission and this thing will be over before either of us has a chance to drag the other down.”
...His thoughts touched upon a tangle of emotions and contradictions that’d knotted in his gut these past few weeks. Despite his best intentions, his feelings towards Cas were... more complicated now. The guy had taken a bullet for Dean, he’d saved Sam’s life. But oddly enough, when he touched the parts of himself that had changed recently to see what they were made of, it wasn’t only Cas shielding him with his body that popped into mind. It was Cas being stroppy, or puzzled, or putting his foot in it, or going all quiet when Dean snapped at him, or giving that faint smile of his when he discovered something out in the world that he found entertaining, often for reasons Dean could not conceive of. Dean wasn’t sure why these feelings kept drifting through his mind ten times a day. He did know he did not like it. The Joker had a plan, that much was obvious from that note. Dean had to be sure his feelings were clear-cut and certain so he could carry them out when those orders did arrive. And he would. He knew himself that well. He would carry them out. He just didn’t want to hate himself too much for it afterwards...
“I didn’t mean that way, idiot. I meant if you settle down. If that guy back there happens to be The One for you.” You can almost hear the clunky capitals.
There was an awesome moment of silence in which Dean could almost hear little angelic gears turning in the head close to his own; in his imagination, it sounded like the ting-tong-ting-tong of the God Machine, a teeny tiny version thereof. He wasn’t very surprised when Cas leaned away from him slightly, pulling against the arm around his shoulders to turn and examine Dean’s face, a very obvious question about to pour forth like an awkward rainbow.
Dean rubs his nose. There’s a faint trace of pink kissing his cheeks. “Unfortunately, as to that, I can only guess. I was practically blind. That’s why I have no clue who she is. I only caught a glimpse before I passed out. I’m pretty sure she had on a white dress, and her hair was so blonde…. the way it caught the sun, it shone like a halo.”
“Have they been going at it like that since I left?” Sam asks, dropping into a crouch near Dean. “That’s not right, by the way, that line has to bisect here at a forty five degree angle.”
They proved their mettle again these past three days. This region was infiltrated at the turn of the year by monsters born of Eve, egged on by stragglers from the demon horde and abetted by opportunistic bandits of the mortal variety, the usual leavings from the bottom of humanity’s barrel. The numbers between the two sides were even. The fiends had their supernatural means and cruelty on their side, but the Hunters had faith and organization, and prevailed without too much effort or any loss of life. They’ll leave this region under the protection of a regular army patrol tomorrow and go to the next hot spot further east, but tonight the Hunters are going to party as they usually do after any engagement.
I have 3 SPN fics in the works, the next in all likelihood is a multi chapter beast, so probably out closer to Christmas. See you then!
Dean looks him over carefully. The guy looks the part: he’s in tidy homespun with tough leather boots, while a dark overcoat of good make is tossed over the mule’s saddle in deference to the day’s warmth. It’s the kind of good wear you need when wandering around the midwest where hot and cold can come at you any time. The coat is imprudently covering the draw on the rifle holstered at the side of one of the packs... Still, standard all in all. There’s no immediate reason to distrust him… but Dean’s gut won’t have any of that, and neither does Dean’s inner mutt. His real mutt, Ginny, is making low growling noises and hasn’t lost an iota of tension. Something about this guy feels off. Beyond the obvious, that is.
Michael was the kind of prick who could speak in capitals. Colt would learn that this was true of most angels.
- breaks the alphabet and the dictionary just as surely as Hell did, but for the opposite reason. Words like majesty, terrifying beauty, righteous burning light, pop into Dean’s head and flee just as promptly, ashamed that they even tried to capture this sight, the purity, the grace, the wings like heaven made manifest sweeping out, hauling him up up up- The air screams by them. Surely they should be near Jupiter by now at the speed they’re going, yet they’re still only at the edges of Hell. Oh, but there’s light beyond the being’s shoulder. Light. Sunlight, maybe, and they pick up speed. There’s a popping in Dean’s ears as they grow back, sounds like fire crackling, or maybe the sound of a keyboard typing furiously- Dean can’t pay any attention, he can only stare, mesmerized, at the one pulling him ever upward.
This is a fantasy AU that is roughly based on 19th century ish style, but Dean speaks like he does in the show because I find his dialogue way too funny that way. The actor known as Swan Prince in this play may seem a little OOC to start with, but there's reasons for this. Have fun!
Dean’s already moving. Pain is an old enemy, he’s dealt with it before. He will not let it slow him down or freeze him like a fucking rabbit! He twists his left hand around, manages to fasten fingers around Alastair’s wrist and keep him from swinging back and punching again, and in that split second of distraction as Alastair pulls at his captured arm, Dean’s injured right hand fastens around the hilt of his bowie knife in the scabbard tied to the back of his holster belt.
. Cas had casually stuck his finger in the celestial clockwork of the universe and dicked around just to give himself a better chance of nailing Dean’s ass to the wall.
Great, angels were sniffing around this Shakespeare’s trail. Dean couldn’t believe he’d been complaining about the day being perfect earlier.
Dean feels like some kind of chessboard just got turned upside down, the sky and the snow have switched places. The look of amazement on Luke’s face certainly measures up to that kind of seismic shift.
“I’m sorry I keep saying those things to you!” Ben wailed into Castiel’s surcoat. “I don’t know why I do it! I always do it and I don’t know why!”
“Yes, I didn’t think you used brine for preservation,” says Cas, sweet omega Cas completely unaware of the scents flooding the porch of Dean’s cabin. “That’s why having a cold room is such an advant-”
Wow, that sounded thoroughly suicidal, and Dean was glad he was going to be in another dimension by the time that happened.
Dean knifed one of his own targets right on the heels of that distraction. He was taking down the second line, Cas was in charge of the first, now thoroughly confused, already down three men and facing the wrong way.
Side to side the whiskey sways, as if weighing which part of Dean's recent Hell Knight experience he has to hate himself for the most. Is it for the dark greedy joy of hunting down his brother with a claw hammer? Or Cas having to spend almost all of his fading strength to come wrestle Dean, all snarling and demony and damned, to a standstill to stop him?
Three hours later, Sam indeed tells him the same thing. It boggles Castiel, but he isn’t that familiar with the ins and outs of witchcraft, not enough to say whether Rowena’s explanation is a patented fallacy or not. The Winchesters usually know what they are doing, or at least they are considerably more paranoid than Castiel is. If they both think this has to happen, then he can only accept it.
“I put your drinks back down in the cellar,” Jo said, practical as always. “You can have them when you get back. Let’s head to the park.”
within the last four days since the battle…? Or are they talking about Castiel’s efforts at saving Dean from the gas? What does a blonde human have to do with it then?
Dean sits where he left him by the fire, in that tiny island of light and warmth in the darkness, watching him steadily, expression unreadable.
Robbie squirms and jerks at Dean’s jacket. He wants to be held up so he can snuggle against Dean’s chest while looking over his shoulder, the sprout’s fave position. Dean hoists up his boy, making himself a vague promise. That maybe he’ll suck at things like milestones and Christmas and birthdays and helping with the homework, but he’ll try to be a better dad than John, at any rate. His son will need to learn to fight, no doubt, but he’ll not be nothing but a soldier for all that...
He’s put all of his meager skills of dissemblance into appearing normal, hiding the bleeding ache inside, his worry, his anger and his sadness, but Sam’s instincts are superb. He seems reluctant to leave Castiel alone for more than a minute as if afraid the angel might take flight the moment his eyes are off him. But human frailty is on Castiel's side. Once Sam keels over in exhaustion in the den’s deep couch, a nature documentary droning unheeded in the background, Castiel covers him with a blanket and proceeds with his plan. Rather than chance the summoning circle, he simply steps outside and places a phone call. It’s three in the mornings, but demons don’t sleep either, and he knows Crowley will pick up. The King of Hell has certainly been following their progress these last few weeks.
“Huh?!” says Charlie, twisting her head around sharply at the bloody L word the big moose accidentally dropped into the conversation. Not that they can afford to keep any card in the hole at this point.
“You say the weirdest stuff at times. Look, dude, some would say it’s destiny. A fair maiden saving my life, vanishing before I can thank her, then fate leading me to find her again after a year of searching-  it’s a grand tale, it’s poetry, it’s fated love, all that.”
Dean’s eyes flit towards the distant figure. There’s sort of a code here, though it’s never been written down or anything; you normally send out matching numbers in a parley. He turns back to his mate, and notes in passing that everybody else has a firm NO WAY! written all over their faces, though Cas is the only one to have dared articulate it. Odd how everybody’s acting like they’re part of Team Dean now, even Vic’s people and the Rancher guards; hell, even Dean’s guys, who are normally pretty vocal with their boss, seem unusually obedient lil’ doggies today. It makes Cas, the mulish exception to the rule, stand out like a war banner. Dean has a feeling he could order any one of his people to jump into a fire and they’d do it, but Cas won’t let him move an inch even if Dean starts to yell and cuss.
“Just needed to be sure,” said Dean, and because offence was always the best defence, the word ‘sure’ coincided with the solid thud of his knuckles connecting with Castiel’s chin.
Castiel tilted his head, weighing that in surprise. “After only two days? Maybe if I didn’t do anything for a thousand more years, I might be, but I usually find something to do or think about before that happens. We handle time differently than you do,” he added as explanation when Dean shot him a startled look.
“What do you mean?” Castiel had the information they’d found in minutes sparkling in his palm, he gestured at it with a wing tip. “It’s here quite clearly. This angel here in the Statutes Library looked at the request, realized which decree was being used, against whom, and put in a counter-order. It makes sense to me. Do you know what Sam and the League could have done with this? If we tried to use the same dubious decree that killed his mother to rip his brother away, especially when the borders of Purgatory are calm and we’re cutting back on our number of human troops?”
There was a morass of feelings boiling around in Dean’s gut, and he did not have the time or luxury to examine them all, but there was one fact he could reach for, one that made sense to the Dean Winchester who worked for the railroad and the resistance, and that might make sense to these men gathered here too. All personal stakes aside, Dean could see a future where Cas would be one of mankind’s greatest allies. It’d take time and work, because Cas was stubborn - rightfully so, Dean wouldn’t trust a weathervane. But once Cas was persuaded, oh, he would make mistakes from time to time but at his core, Dean knew his angel would try to do what was
“Why?” Naomi asked, surprised, but then waved her own question away. “Never mind, don’t tell me. To access the Dome, you need to use this sigil, here.” She traced something in the air so fast that Dean could only blink, but Cas nodded in understanding. “I will do what I can on my side to leave you undisturbed, but the Dome-... I will try to distract the watchers in Heaven as well, but Castiel, I can’t keep
Most of Donna’s bounty ended up in the larder, but Dean indulged himself with a cup of coffee and a slice of her pie right there, and who cared if it was three in the afternoon, it broke no decree. Actually the coffee did, so he’d let Cas understand that his absence would be much appreciated. There was something of a gray zone for minor transgressions like this, so a thing with no name had evolved between them. Dean made a minimal effort to keep his little rule breaking out of Cas’s way and Cas returned the favor by ignoring them.
“Then you appeared out of nowhere today and- and started accusing her right there in the throne room - I panicked. We were still trying to figure out if she had help among the other crusaders or newcomers- or even among my own courtiers since she was so slick, this had to be an inside job in part. So I- I tried to get you out of there, ordered you to shut up, told you we’d talk about it
