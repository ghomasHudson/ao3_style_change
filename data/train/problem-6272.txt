The first photo he wasn’t surprised to see. The two girls from yesterday smiled widely in the foreground, and behind them was Thor and Tony. Thor had Tony’s head cupped in his hand, his thumb over his lips. And, yeah, it didn’t

“That’s really generous of you, Mr. Stark. But I think I’m good.”
“If I get eaten

With an audible sigh of defeat, unable to keep his mind occupied, he let his thoughts drift to Tony.
“Oh,”
The suit jerked forward before stabilizing again, the streamline design of the suit cutting through the air like a bullet. He watched his speed jump from Mach 2 to 3, faster and faster, until he was at Mach 5. He let out a
romantic or sexual! Tony Stark is capable of being just friends with people!
Bucky slowly got up from the floor and limped over towards Steve. “Ugh, I’m done. I’m tapping you in.”
Tony shook his head, a slightly pained look on his face.
Suddenly, Tony felt the need to apologize. He wasn’t sure what for, as long as Steve would stop looking at him like that. His stomach churned something uncomfortable, the space between them feeling more like an ocean than the width of the room.
“My head and neck really hurts, and I feel weak.” He said. Bruce mumbled something about blood samples and scans, but Peter suddenly swatted at Tony’s hand and sat up, his legs caught in the tangle of his sheets. He leaned over the bed and threw up next to Tony’s feet. Tony’s stomach churned at the smell, but he stayed put and rubbed Peter’s back as he heaved in a breath.
“Not the first spider you’ve seen with hands.” Bucky’s humorous voice crackled over the comm. An offended Peter sputtered through the comm before Natasha tsk’d.
Tony shot a finger gun at Clint, “Bingo.”
“It’s no intrusion,” Thor supplied, shifting so that he was crouched low enough to be in frame.
The memory of Thor dipping Tony in a heated kiss in the middle of battle and Bucky not an hour ago pressing Tony against a wall with a possessive hand around his neck barraged his mind once again.
“Sorry, we don’t mean to intrude but—”
“What?”
“I’m not—you did nothing wrong. I’m just…working through some things.” He said with a sigh. “I think I’m going to head to bed.”
Tony would be mad. Maybe offended. For good reason, too. Tony wasn’t
Tony clapped his hands around Peter’s ears, stretching his face into faux-scandalized look, “Mind the young, impressionable minds in the vicinity!”
I was. Watching you kiss everyone in front of me.” Steve opened his eyes to meet Tony’s. His head was still reeling from the past 24 hours, not at all recovered from the emotional whiplash he’d just endured.
“That’s a nice cross section.” Tony mumbled.
Tony hopped off his stool and quickly threw a pair of jeans on over his undersuit, having not been bothered to change out of it after training, and headed out of the workshop and towards Peter’s room to drag the kid out of bed for the second time today, Steve travelling behind him.
It wasn’t like he had claim over Tony. No, he only had himself to blame. He knew it would have been stupid to assume that he was the only person attracted to Tony, but a part of him always hoped he would have been brave enough to be the first to admit his feelings.
way!” Steve amended, “That would be hypocritical of me. What I mean is it’s weird to see two of my teammates dating.”
Tony scanned Peter’s face, but relented his search as he found no signs of bruising. “Try not to get snot on your suit.”
“You get hit in the face, kid?” Tony asked as Peter sniffled once more.
Tony struggled under his grasp, but Steve continued to drag him out to the hallway.
He didn’t exactly have to imagine, though, with the way Tony was making his way through the Avengers.
A hand landed on his shoulder, pulling his head above the water.
Steve raised his hands in a placating gesture, “I don’t—you don’t owe me an explanation for who you step out with.”
Rogers just hummed in response, and they took off.
Steve only snorted, reaching for a spoonful of sorbet, the rest of his attention focused on the screen in front of them.
Tony shot a repulsor blast at the back of its head, not even making a dent. “It’s impossible to get through its skin. We’ll be here all week trying to take it down.”
Natasha braced herself against the wall and motioned for Tony to step onto her linked hands for a boost up, “Not a fan of Italian. Steve on the other hand—”
Tony popped the arc reactor core back into his chest, two pairs of relieved sighs filling the room. Rogers eyed the reactor for a moment longer, a wary look on his face. His eyes roamed across Tony’s torso as if looking for something, like if he stared long enough a new injury would appear across Tony’s stomach.
Well, his and now Steve’s.
“About that, Steve. That wasn’t—”
Thor nodded his head solemnly, stifling a laugh, “It would be an honor Anthony.”
“Maybe you should make me some parachute arrows so next time you don’t have to make out with me.”
“Five minutes. Any longer and Friday has permission to blast Pitbull’s discography at full volume.”
. He loved Tony.
“With the power of
Steve jumped, like he hadn’t heard Tony enter, but continued his rhythmic punches without pause.
losing to Sam.”
“What if they call my bluff?”
In a moment of confidence, or maybe post-battle exhaustion, Steve surged up to kiss Tony. Their mouths met at an awkward angle, noses bumping and beards chafing sharply against each other. Tony’s hands flew up and gripped at Steve’s shoulders, tightening as he tried not to fall over due to either surprise or the sheer force of Steve’s face colliding with his.
“It’s not too late to change your mind. I can still have you and May set up in a five-star resort in Morocco by five.”
Steve couldn’t blame him if he was a little in love with Tony.
Bucky, already in the kitchen and digging through the fridge, replied without missing a beat. “Yeah, just dropped him off at his workshop.”
“I’m pretty sure Captain America committed at least three felonies before he was 25,” Peter said dryly.
Steve’s eyes flickered for just a moment but Tony, ever observant, followed his gaze to where Bucky was toeing at Rorgg’s unmoving head several meters away. Tony blinked, and then turned back towards Steve.
“Focus on me, Tony.” A firm but comforting voice ordered him. Tony’s mind clung to the instruction, glad to have something to focus on instead of letting his mind run wild. Steve’s other hand disentangled Tony’s fingers from his jeans and pressed it over his heart, the warm plane of his chest rising and falling in even breaths.
“—my, my, Captain. That’s mighty forward of you—”
At movie night, Steve came to a halt as he walked into common area, eyes glued on Thor’s arm wrapped around Tony’s shoulders. Tony patted the seat next to him where Steve sat every movie night. Steve eventually unfroze and hesitantly joined them on the sofa. Tony was hyperaware of Steve’s presence next to him, only because he sat rigidly for the entire three hours, barely shifting position. The rest of the team slowly trickled out, back to their rooms during the second movie, until it was just the two of them left.
“The longer I stay here… the worse it will get… he… he…” Tony stutters, tears threating to fall from his eyes. “You.” It made no sense to Steve and Tony knew that. He just didn’t know how to tell his best friend that David had always threatened to hurt Steve if Tony would ever leave him and the fear that his best friend would be hurt or possibly worse because of him was more than he could bare so he could put up with the physical, emotional and sexual abuse from David as long as he knew that Steve was safe. There were a lot of things in this world Tony would put up with as long as he knew that Steve was safe. Through everything that was the one belief that David hadn’t been able to break, that Steve would always be his friend and always be there for Tony no matter what. So instead of trying to break it, it became a threat that if he would ever try leave him or try to tell anyone about their relationship he would go after Steve. And he knew that people would hate him if they found out he was the reason Steve was hurt or dead.
“Tony you are so good! So hot when you just take it like a slut!” David moans and reaches his orgasm spilling it into Tony without a second thought. He pulls out and lies down on his back pulling Tony with him so he lands on his side with his back to David which he was grateful for. He didn’t want David to him crying over this. It wasn’t a secret that David liked rough sex it was just that usually he prepped better. “That was great babe!” David praises him.
“I know baby… Its okay. We will figure this out.” Tony promise him. “But from now on I need to work more since I am taking over the company.” He saw David’s eyes darken at this. It was everything from jealousy of Tony getting a position he could only dream of to feeling angry of not being able to control Tony all day. The grip on Tony’s wrist tighten and he was certain it would bruise. “Not here!” Tony hisses. The grip doesn’t loosen but Tony smiles as people pass them by.
“You know exactly who I am talking about Tony! Are you on your way to his place now? To fuck him behind my back?!” Tony just shakes his head as he looks at David.
“Tony. This is not your fault.” He was firmer in his tone but still kind and gentle. “It is never okay to hurt anyone. Never, so this is on him not you!” He tries to convince him but he knows it will take months maybe even years before he believed him. Tony continues to fiddle with his shirt and focuses on the floor.
” He answered and Tony was feeling all warm and fuzzy inside and had at once a stupid smile on is face and could feel his cheeks flush like a school girl.
“Come on and sit on the couch.” Steve changes the subject because he would only be mad if they continued to talk about David. Tony obeys and sits down and Steve sits down next to him and carefully pulls of the hood. He is not shocked when he sees more bruising and a few cuts that may need stitching. He opens the box and takes out the antiseptic and cotton balls so he can clean the wounds and get a good look at them. “This will sting.” He warns and Tony winces slightly but nothing major. “So what did you do at SI?” Steve wonders hoping he still worked.
His phone vibrates and he opens the text from Bucky.
“Good. Come on let get you to the bed.” Steve doesn’t know how but somehow they made it to the bedroom without falling over on their way there. Carefully Tony makes Steve lay down on his back first so he can clean him up with a wash cloth but only took the worst before turning him over to his stomach and sat beside him on the edge of the bed playing with his hair for a few moments before taking out the cooling lotion and another bottle Steve hadn’t seen before. Carefully he begins to put the cooling lotions on his butt. “Sorry tell me if I am to rough.” Tony says softly making Steve chuckle softly. “What?” Tony wonders.
They had made a complete night of it. From Tony laying out his clothes before dinner to him taking his coat, pulling out his chair and making his order for him at the small bistro they had gone to, then they took a walk through the park home and he had let Tony talk and only answered when spoken to or asked a question and when they came home Tony had ordered him to undress down to his boxers and kneel by the small desk they had in the bedroom so Tony could go over a few blueprints and contracts before they continued their night, it was just a lie to get Steve to graze just above subspace and for Tony to touch him. But none the less Steve did as he was told because he had asked for this and wanted this.
“And I am trying!” Tony snaps back rises from the chair. “It’s just that my work have been taking up most of my time!” Tony says in a calmer tone. “I am so close to breaking this thing!”
A few notes:
Steve threw his shield at Peter, catching him in his shoulder. Peter shot a web to Steve’s face, pulling him in and sending him right back with a kick to the chest. Steve’s cowl flew off. He gripped his shield a little tighter.
“There must be
“Showtime.” Tony whispered under his breath.
That only left one person.
“Steve, get Bruce.” Tony barked. Peter winced at the noise and Tony lowered his voice to just above a whisper, “Fri, lights down to ten percent.”
“Hey, Pep! Pepper-pot. Pep in my step,” Sweat started gathering at his hairline, “What can I do for you? You look beautiful, might I add. Is that the new Hermès spring line pant suit?”
“Iron Man?”
True.
“Maybe try not to leave a trail of bodies in your wake.” He teased. She finished smoothing the uniform down and dragged the unconscious woman towards the bathrooms.
Well, so much for going easy.
“Please. Just, let me say this before I can’t.” It was getting harder for Steve to meet Tony’s eyes, and by the looks of it he seemed just as uncomfortable as he felt. Tony opened his mouth once more looking like he wanted to protest, but eventually slumped back into his seat, giving Steve a patient look. “Okay. Okay.”
2) Well. It's done. Sorry that it took so long but, ya know, life sometimes hits you in the face. Thank you so much for all the comments and kudos despite my extremely sporadic updates. If you made it to the end, then an extra thank you for sticking with this fic for 7 months! 💕
“Are we any closer to finding how to wrap this up?” Clint haggardly asked over the comms. So maybe he was running out of arrows.
“Friday said you were bringing gifts!”
“Why are we at the grocery store?”
“Wha’ time issit?”
There is also a description of a panic attack in this chapter, but it's pretty short.
Rogers nodded, his mother-henning instinct supposedly soothed for the moment. “Think I could hitch a ride with you back into the city?”
Tony, perhaps sensing some of Steve’s inner turmoil, grabbed the sides of his head between his hands, the repulsors still warm from the fight holding his face so tenderly. Those two points and his eyes staring right into his, all of them anchoring Steve in the moment.
“I’m sorry, I thought you said to
Spider-Man, Ant-Man, Wasp, and Black Widow at some point deemed themselves the “Bug Avengers”. Tony tried to argue that if Peter was wearing the Iron Spider suit, then he belonged in the “Iron Fam” with him and Rhodey, but after discussion they rebranded as “Team Power Armor” to include Sam since “Bird-vengers” disassembled as soon as Clint suggested it. Steve took pity on the archer and dragged him over to join the two super-soldiers’ sparring match.
He dropped into the study, landing on his side in an ungraceful heap. Natasha was instantly on his side, hauling him up and dragging him towards the window.
Tony blinked, reading the headline, and then read it again.
“On it!” Peter shouted as he dove out of the Quinjet, Thor right behind him.
“Hah! So he
the time to panic, he scolded himself. But another look at Peter’s pale and limp form sent a dizzying wave of anxiety over him.
“I resent the implication that I would ever roofie you.”
They stared at each other, waiting for someone to make the first move. Luckily, DUM-E chirped from his charging port, effectively breaking the strange tension between them. Tony started gathering pencils and scrap paper while Steve made his way to his spot on the couch. While his back was still to Steve he closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He couldn’t remember the last time things felt awkward between them, if things had ever been awkward. Steve had reasons to be a little short with Tony, though. He had ignored him, his best friend, for three weeks, almost a month. Anyone in their right mind would be upset. So Tony just had to make it up to him. Show him that he didn’t actually forget about him, he had just been busy.
“Try not to squash my spider, okay?”
“What?” Rogers’ eyes darted between the two of them. His hand squeezed his for a second before he dropped it, like he had forgotten it was there in the first place.
Tony shuddered. He would definitely make good on this promise.
,” Natasha pressed.
“Scusate, signore.” She winked at him before disappearing back through the kitchen doors.
And there was nothing he could do about it now.
“There’s a lot to think about.” He sighed. Steve continued to work his hand over a knot, the tightness in his shoulders starting to give. He blinked slowly, his eyelids growing heavier.
“Hey, how did the—Tony!”
the ice splintering beneath him before giving way, and sunk below the surface.
Steve’s arm remained wrapped around him throughout the movie. Tony’s own melancholy mood was forgotten as he provided his own social commentary about dating, and Steve theorized that the blonde woman in the movie was played by Natasha while undercover.
Tony!”
He pulled away and gave Thor a wink before he went about collecting the pieces of his armor that he could salvage—his helmet, boots, a gauntlet. He went to call Steve to see if he’d help him lug his suit back to the Quinjet, but when he looked back up at where he was standing, no one was there.
“You’re home early.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He wasn’t
“Thor.”
“Oh, nothing.” Natasha smirked. As if on cue, Clint rolled up to them, barely stopping the car long enough for them to get in.
“You sure know how to help a guy forget his ex,” Tony patted the space next to him on his bed. “Well, come on. I can’t get over my heart wrenching break up unless I watch at least two romcoms.”
Right. He needed to get his suit. Go collect the other Avengers. Start thinking strategy. Tony was already halfway out his workshop towards the Quinjet by the time Steve had gathered his bearings. He caught his gaze, and Tony stopped for just a moment, giving Steve an earnest look.
He shoved off his coat and started to squeeze through the gate. He sucked in as much as he could, getting his head, arm, and leg through, but the metal of his arc reactor caught on the bars. He twisted, trying to hunch his shoulders and curl his spine so his chest could clear the gate, but it caught no matter which way he turned. A wave of frustration washed over him, and he mentally cursed the metal in his chest.
“Hawkeye, what’s your position?” Rogers asked, voice in full Captain America mode.
Thor dropped to the ground as they reached Central Park, making a b-line towards a hotdog vendor. Tony shook his head with a laugh. A few people had stopped in their tracks, eyes wide and hands fumbling for their phones as the Norse God of Thunder strolled passed. Majority of people though barely spared a glance, either locals used to the sight of superheroes or assuming the long haired man with a cape would ask for money as soon as they locked eyes.
“Alright, I think we’re good for today. Good job everyone.”
Tony sat stock-still, eyes darting between Steve’s. His questioning expression slowly morphing to hesitant disbelief reminded Steve of the slow cranking gears of an old clock.
“The disguises are necessary.”
“Anything for you.”
"I think I'll survive," Rogers frowned at him and Tony rolled his eyes, "Friday will monitor me and let me know if any of my fingers are about to fall off."
A large truck came barreling down the street, an alien spider on the hood of the truck and wildly flailing its arms towards the broken front window before the truck slammed into the side of a brick building, pinning the spider between it and the wall. Bucky leaped through the open window and sunk two knives into the spider’s eyes. The spider let out an eerily human scream as it flung Bucky off of it, sending the man skidding across the pavement.
Natasha clawed at Bucky’s face. He shoved her away, not wanting to lose an eye, and Natasha skidded to a stop at their feet, gasping for air. Bucky charged her once again, ready to claim victory, but her hand shot out and grabbed Cap’s shield. She jammed it in his kneecap, forcing the super-soldier down onto his other, and smashed the shield upwards in an uppercut to his chin. Bucky fell over, a dazed look in his eye, and Natasha dragged herself back to her feet, shield in hand.
“Are you—did I upset you?” Tony asked. Steve finally met his eyes, obviously holding something back.
. He tucked the mental image away. He’d deal with whatever
“Clint, stay here and watch that hard drive. Bidding starts soon, so if we’re not done by then—”
.” Clint wiggled his eyebrows at him. Tony tried not to smile as Clint was sent into another coughing fit, gripping his chest.
She arched a delicate eyebrow at him, and his heart lurched into his throat.
“—Jesus Christ, never do that again.”
“Lights at ten percent, Fri.” Tony murmured as he gently pushed open the door.
is a lost cause,” Steve plowed on, ignoring the suggestive arch of Tony’s eyebrow, “I do have something I need to talk to you about. But it can wait until after you’re done with whatever you’re working on.”
“Food.” Steve said in the most obvious tone, and yeah, that would make sense.
“You should be good. Once you find the electric panel let us know,” She tapped towards the nearly invisible earpiece tucked in her ear, “And we can meet back in the study you entered from.”
Tony stood there in stunned silence.
Natasha ran at Bucky and wrapped her thighs around his neck, sending them to the ground.
and productive. When Thor travelled to New Mexico to visit friends, Tony tagged along and ended up spending the weekend picking apart Jane Foster’s head and enjoying a comfortable back and forth with Darcy. Whenever he wanted to go out, he had someone to keep him company
“If anything I’m doing them a favor. Half the tabloids in New York would tank without me. Think of all the jobs I’m creating.”
“Five more minutes.” Peter turned, wrapping himself tightly in the blanket. Tony sighed but started out the door.
Tony shook his head. “Can’t.”
owe me, Rogers.”
“I can do a lot more than a two-step. Daddy dearest made sure of that when he sent me to boarding school.” Tony let out a short laugh devoid of humor. He shook his head, as if to physically rid himself of the memory of Howard. “I could show you sometime. Whatever you want—waltz, tango, square dancing—I’ve mastered them all.” He offered his most blinding smile. Bucky turned back towards him and shook his head, taking a step closer to Tony.
Tony barely managed to morph his smile into a grimace.
“I’m sorry Captain, Boss—” Steve barely managed not to flinch as Friday’s lilting voice echoed around the room. “local authorities are requesting the Avengers.”
“The guy who almost died is fine too, Cap. Thanks for asking.” Clint said dryly. He shivered and broke out in another coughing fit, struggling to pull in another breath between coughing up mouthfuls of water.
“Peter, can you press your chin to your chest and tell me if you get a shooting pain up your neck?” Bruce asked, calm as ever. Steve was already digging through the en suite bathroom closet for cleaning supplies. Peter did as he was told, holding his chin there for a few seconds, and shook his head. Bruce released a breath Tony didn’t know he was holding.
“We’re big fans of the Avengers.”
“She’ll wake up with a headache and in someone else’s clothes. You’ve been there, right?” She smirked as she started undressing the server. “There’s probably a backup generator, so the lights are only going to be down for a few seconds.” Natasha explained as she swapped clothes, “The only person who can get close to the items inconspicuously is a waitress.”
“I can’t take the distance anymore, Thor. Even when you’re here it feels like your mind is realms away.” Tears started to well up in Tony’s eyes. Thor clutched his hands and held them close to his chest.
Tony let the nanites disassemble around him, leaving him in his black undersuit. He walked over to Peter and offered him a hand up.
Tony snorted. “From where I’m standing it looks like he can’t wait to leave.”
Clint had an actual birdbrain or missed out when they were handing out self-preservation at birth; it was the only reason he would have thought shoving an exploding arrow into the creature's mouth was a good idea. There wasn't even a second for Tony to berate Clint for being an idiot. A blast of orange flame and smoke erupted, a stark comparison to the white and gray snowscape of New York, and Clint's purple form was falling out of the creature's hold. Tony redirected all his power to his boots in a futile chase after him, but a moment later Clint hit the river with a
“I’ll keep an eye out on him.” Steve offered. It wasn’t much, but it was enough of a relief to help him focus on training instead of worrying over Peter.
“You plan on sharing any of that?” Tony asked as he landed next to him. Obligingly, Thor handed over a hot dog loaded with condiments from the pile in his arms.
“Should’ve drank it sooner. You snooze you lose, old man.” Tony said, matter-of-factly.
Tony couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face.
Steve sucked in a sharp breath.
Tony finally ripped his eyes off of Steve to look at Bucky, who looked pleased with himself, apparently oblivious or unbothered to his best friend’s current state.
“Ready?” Tony wheezed out.
Tony’s heart fluttered at that. When he looked at Steve, he saw no anger, no disgust in his eyes. His hands were red, raw from too many nights spent here in the gym when he should have been spending time with the team, with
Tony nudged Peter in the ribs. “Oh, this is always a good time.”
“As long as you don’t fall and make me dive back into the river.”
Steve returned a few moments later with an ice pack in hand and a rumpled looking Bruce in tow. Steve pressed the cool pack into Tony’s hand and took a step back, allowing room for Bruce to brush past him.
Tony whizzed by, grabbing both mugs out of his hands, and started on one as he made his way to one of his work stations. A blur of blue projections followed him across the room, blueprints to different designs and various documents orbiting him like their own mini solar system, some disappearing seemingly at the flick of Tony’s eyes. He set down the other mug on his work station while simultaneously plopping down on a stool, spinning a few times with childlike—or manic—amusement.
“Sam didn’t
Sam took a bite of his bagel, “I stole your credit card, broke the bank, and lost your money.” Sam stood from his seat and tossed a credit card on the table, and clapped Bucky on the shoulder, “Thanks for breakfast, champ!”

“You’re a good dancer.” Bucky said, eyes sweeping across the room. Tony leaned against the wall and shrugged.
Natasha circled around Bucky, eyes narrowed, feet slinking like a cat hunting its prey. Bucky remained planted in the center of the circle, head barely turning but his eyes remained locked on Natasha with ice-cold intensity.
“Any chance I can convince you to take a nap?”
Iron Man flew ahead as Steve and the rest of the Avengers boarded the Quinjet. Steve took the time to clear his head, ridding himself of anything that didn’t pertain to the situation ahead. He listened closely this time as Friday updated the rest of the team—they were heading towards a small town in Maine, the newest location of apparently
The next movie night Steve skipped completely. Tony tried to ignore Bucky glaring daggers into the side of his head.
The discomfort stayed with him well after they ditched the car and boarded the Quinjet. He pointedly ignored it the rest of the flight home.
anymore.
“Friday, can you patch Thor through?” Tony asked, much to Steve’s apparent dismay. Before he could argue, the familiar blue eyes and joyful face of Thor appeared on screen.
“Tony,” Steve’s voice came through their private channel, “I have an idea, but you’re not going to like it.”
“What?”
Tony was met by silence. He looked at Steve, who was across the workshop, only a few steps away from the door. His hands were settled on his belt, but he might as well have had them crossed with how rigid he was. An emotion flashed across his face, too fast for Tony to place it, and he schooled his features into something more diplomatic, like he was talking to the press or a government official.
Natasha smirked, “You’re just mad I beat you twice in a row,” She handed back the shield to Steve and tapped Peter on the shoulder, “You’re up, little spider.”
“Is this mine?” Steve was sitting on the edge of Tony’s bed, a red sweatshirt in hand. Tony shrugged and grabbed the sweatshirt, pulling it over his head.
Peter pulled on his mask and jumped towards the center of mats. Tony grabbed Steve’s arm, meeting his eyes.
“Let’s get Peter some water while Bruce runs some tests.” Steve suggested, but was already leading him out of the room.
Steve managed to refrain from rolling his eyes at him. Tony ducked his head, wild curls blocking his face from view, and took a long sip from his mug, barely managing to smother the amused smile on his face. Steve had to slip his hand into his pocket to keep from running his hands through Tony’s hair.
His gaze instantly landed on Peter’s form on the settee perpendicular to them. He sat wrapped in a blanket and leaning gently against Bucky, his forehead pressed against the cool metal of his arm. They both were watching the TV with half-lidded eyes, a small smile on Peter’s face as he watched Harrison Ford shoot at a group of Ewoks.
Tony turned towards him and was met with a serious face, not that his face was usually anything other than serious. Tony cringed, wondering if that’s what Bucky, what
“Aye aye, Captain.” Clint saluted. He winced a bit as he waddled over to Sam, and they took of towards medical. Natasha nodded and disappeared back towards where the Hulk’s angry roars echoed.
“Maybe,” Bucky paused. “He doesn’t care for rich snobs or the press crawling around with cameras.”
“I’m serious, Tony. You need to shut this down. No more headlines or front page photos.” Pepper said.
Whew, that was a longer one! If this chapter seems familiar, it's because it's heavily inspired by the Italy mission in Uncharted 4. I also snuck in some silver fox Tony because I can't help myself.
“It’s actually Francis tonight,
Tony managed to nod his head. A hand cupped the back of his neck, a comforting weight acting like a barrier to the spreading panic, stopping it from fully consuming his mind.
Tony was trying.
“He did steal Buck’s credit card, but unless he only had $20 to his name I don’t think he ‘broke the bank’.” Steve said while he nodded at Bruce as he blearily stumbled towards the table.
“Um,” Steve’s mind works at three hundred miles a minute, playing out different scenarios at the same time. “Great, you can either assist Hawkeye with the ranged attack or stick down here and deal with the left flank. Don’t push yourself,” he pauses to kick a lizard into Natasha’s blade. “don’t push yourself into something if you’re not ready, we don’t want a Winter Soldier scare.”
“Steve,” Tony says, shaking him slightly, “it’s six pm, Bucky and Peter are supposed to be back. Did they come home? Did I sleep through them coming home?” Tony asks, he’s slept through things before, but he knows that Steve never sleeps through anyone coming home. The super soldier hearing he has stops him from doing so; he wakes up from the sound of the elevator moving, from the sound of Clint rummaging through the fridge even when he’s wrapped up in their room.
“What the hell happened to him?” Steve asks, breaking eye contact with Tony, he looks around the room; the rest of them seem just a lost as he is. Suddenly, he turns to Tony looking at him with really soft eyes, “do you want us to go, Tony?”
“I’m almost there pal; I need ya to stay with me okay?” Steve says, his stomach is sinking, he hopes that the serum HYDRA injected into Bucky is enough to keep him alive.
“Thanks, J,” Tony mutters, turning away from Steve, he hesitates for a moment. “Steve?”
“Meeting with Fury at twelve, then I promised Peter I would help him train a little,” Steve shrugs, “I could reschedule the meeting? Why it won’t take that long will it?”
Peter is sitting at the breakfast bar, listening to Clint explain his arrows, he’s got one hand on a fork and the other tracing the arrows’ fletching. Clint’s smiling, always happy to talk about archery; Tony looks on, both hands curled around a coffee mug. Steve watches him, dark brown eyes catching the few rays of warm morning sun turning them the colour of whiskey. Tony has this tiny small smile on his face; he’s resting on the countertop, he looks so gentle and soft; he was breathing slowly his head angled towards Peter.
“Oh yeah?” Tony looks up at him, “what were you thinking? Bright pink? Purple? Blue? Striped? Spotted? I can do anything you like.” Tony grins flipping the wrench in his hand, unscrewing the plates and the different parts of the arm, Bucky grimaces it always feels little weird when people root around in the arm.
“Tony,” Steve places a hand on his elbow, “can I have a sec?” He really doesn't want to tear the man away from his son, not just yet, but his duties as team leader are catching up to him. He knows that he needs to get Stark thinking about how he’s going to take care of the kid while Tony leads the kind of life that he does.
“It is seven o’clock in the morning, sir,” JARVIS replies with just a hint of humour discernible.
“I know,” Bucky nods, watching the others leave, so it’s just Steve and him. “I’ve done missions when I’m a little tired before, Stevie.” With this he squeezes Steve’s shoulder again, “we’ll get ‘im back, don’tcha worry.”
“More than good,” Peter grins, and Tony hugs him even closer, dreading the minute he’s going to have to let his son go again. “Love you, Dad,” Peter whispers into Tony’s chest.
“Наташа,” he slips into Russian easily, knowing that it’s the only language no one but them speaks in the tower. It had surprised him when he’d been talking to Natasha in French, only for Tony to answer with easy fluency. “What can I do for you? Have you been up there all day? That can’t be good for your back.” Bucky is curled on his bed, a book propped up by a spare pillow beside him; he has a mug of cocoa on the table next to him.
“You’ve outdone yourself this time,” Steve walks forward, he doesn't touch the arm until Bucky relaxes his hold on it, a silent signal that Steve picks up on; Tony is proud that he notices it too. “This is like a work of art, Tony.” He places a hand on Tony’s shoulder, rubbing his thumb in a circle; Tony leans into the touch, smiling as they both watch Bucky trace his fingers over the arm’s almost invisible joins.
“Oh yeah,” Clint grins, “but when we’re put together, we make a sort of functioning family. You know, teamwork and all that shit.”
>>I'm LITERALLY CRYINg!! #gayvengers<<

“The” Tony pauses to breathe in and out, trying to get himself under control, “the amplifier is giving me some trouble,” his speech is slightly slurred, like it always is just after a panic attack, “I want to” he has to pause again,” “to make sure its sensitive enough. I’m also trying to figure out a way to,” he hates panic attacks, “make it adjust automatically based on brain and nerve function. That will make it more like an external kind of ear, something that’ll work just like your ears do, but also something he can remove when he wants to; ‘cause I know he likes to do that, and I doubt he’d wear it if he couldn't take it off.” Tony doesn't know when he starts to talk normally, time is sometimes skewed after an attack like the one he’s just had.
“You don’t have to replace them, Tony, you just have to be there for Peter. He’s always going to miss them, of course, he is, and you’re not ever going to replace them. That’s something you really need to come to terms with. But what you are going to do is you are going to be a father to Peter, you’re going to make him better when he’s sick, you’re going to help him with his science fair projects, you’re going to help him through breakups with friends and partners, you’re going to take embarrassing photos of him before his prom. You’re going to cook him dinner and take him to the movies, and you are always going to be there for him.” Steve smiles, “you don’t need to replace May and Ben, you just need to be you, and that’s it.” Steve looks up at Bucky, blue eyes wide, the light shining in them; Bucky nods, and smiles at Tony.
There’s a tense moment where Bucky just sits in the chair, he’s breathing really slowly, trying to calm himself down. Tony hops from foot to foot, hoping that the arm is working correctly, he’s almost tempted to ask JARVIS to scan Bucky’s brain, but he holds off. Steve comes up behind him, resting a hand on his waist, grounding him; Tony feels all the nervous energy that had been surging through his body dissipate a bit. Bucky opens his eyes, they’re blue and electric, and alive in a way Tony feels like has been missing since the Winter Soldier had taken over. There’s a huge grin stretched across Bucky’s face; he rushes to his feet, and deliberately paints a line down Tony’s face, down his neck, and across Steve’s hand.
“Oh,” Peter moans, “Dad, and Steve. If we’ve been gone for a whole year, what about Dad and Steve? Do you think they were taken too? Are they okay?”
“Tony!” Pepper doesn't yell, she doesn’t scream, but Tony can see the nervous glint in her eyes. “You need to get down here right now. I haven’t even briefed you yet. God, I don’t even know if James wants to do the conference, I have a seat here for him, but you never told me if he wanted to come along yet.”
“Alright, Petey, don’t worry it’s okay, just as long as there is no pain. I mean it, you need to tell us the truth so that we can help you,” Tony places a hand on Peter’s shoulder, he’s standing by the bed that Peter’s lying on.
“Sir suffers from night terrors, almost every night, a warning sign that they are about to begin is an elevated heart rate. You are the only Avenger awake, I thought it prudent to warn you,” JARVIS sounds like he’s almost pleading with Bucky to do something, “it would be best if Sir had some company, James.”
“Not that I can see, Sir,” JARVIS tells him, “though there is a body shape in a room at the end of the corridor, Sir. It appears to be holding some residual heat, perhaps it worth looking at, Sir.” “JARVIS, can you tell who it is?” Tony sighs, praying beyond hope that it is not May or Ben.
“JARVIS told me you were surfacing,” Steve smiles by way of explanation, “I though you’d want something more than what you’ve got down there in the lab. Thought I’d make a little extra anyway if the others came up early.”
“If I even get custody of him,” Tony mutters, “I talked to Pepper, she said it’ll be a fight, too much of my backstory in the press, too many failings. Too reckless, too distracted.”
“Shit, I forgot about Peter, he’s going to hate me; I’m not even ready,” Steve tries to wiggle free, “Tony come on, I gotta go train your kid, lemme go. How am I going to tell him that I can’t jump off buildings because honestly I just want to sit here and look at stupid pictures on the internet?”
The coffee cup shatters as it hits the floor of the workshop, along with about five thousand dollars worth of scanning equipment. Tony curses as he wraps his cut hand in a rag; he kicks the poxy machine, it didn't work. All of his efforts have been poured into scanning machines, he’s coded, and built as he has never done before. But, none of it has worked, and now all he wants to do is curl into a ball and die. Part of him is grateful to Natasha and Clint; they worked hard to remove every last drop of alcohol from the tower; another part of him wants a drink. Every bone in his body aches, with loss. It is as though he has lost his purpose. Which he knows is a terrible thought, because he has Steve. Steve, who has been nothing but perfect, and good and gold like he is, but it hasn't helped, and Tony knows Steve knows. Though he continues to try every single day. Nothing will help, until they have people hold or bodies to bury.
“Right, back to work then,” Rhodey groans aiming the gun on the back of his suit down the corridor in front of them as Tony looks up, one eye on the scan that JARVIS is completing.
“Stark, I’m here to help, if you can’t help but be annoying then at least you could be quiet.” Strange steps forward, there’s a green light coming from the ugly necklace thingy that’s sitting around his neck. His red cape thing rises behind him, and Tony looks down to see him floating about four inches from the floor. It's a little extravagant for Tony's taste, the whole floating thing, but the wizard doesn't seem to be a threat so he lets it slide, for now.
“You talk it out,” Natasha says it like it’s the most simple thing in the world. “You’ve got to talk and talk, then talk some more. Everyone has to be happy with what’s going on, and that doesn’t just take one conversation, котенок; if you don’t talk it out, then someone’s going to end up getting hurt. But, that’s the same in every relationship.”
“You can’t stop us,” the words are barely whispered, but Tony hears them all the same, “AIM.” The man breaks one of his teeth and foams at the mouth, the gross liquid runs down Tony’s gauntlet, the guy twitches for a few seconds before he goes limp; Tony drops him to the ground.
“It’s great, Tony, thank you. Really you don’t have to-“
“Just queue up a flight path for the mark IV,” Tony stops himself from shouting, just, he can feel the warmth from Steve’s hand; he leans into it, just barely, an imperceptible amount.
“Our feelings? Tony, nothing is going on between Bucky and me,” Steve is shaking his head, his blue eye wide with surprise, “I wouldn’t do that to you, you know-“
“Why don’t we do presents now?” Steve says, running his hand through Tony’s hair, his other hand is resting Bucky’s ankle. He’s not sure he could feel more content than he is right now. And, he’s reluctant to leave his spot but, Tony is getting more and more restless beside him so he’s not sure his peace would last much longer anyway.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Too late,” Tony squeaks.
“Clint! Tasha! Get to Ben,” Cap yells as he sees, through the splintered wood, Peter’s uncle collapse on to the floor. They surge forwards, moving together like the well-oiled team they are, each of them following the plan they hadn't needed to speak to make.
Tony still can’t quite believe that he’s sitting here holding Peter in his arms. Peter, who had grown so that he was nearly as tall as Tony, and honestly twice as strong; his hair had been grown out, and it looked like it had been dyed a honey blonde, but nothing had changed as Peter curled into Tony’s arms. Steve is currently sitting with Bucky leaning against his legs; Bucky has a few of his memories back; they’ve been in Avengers Tower for a few days, long enough from him to have undergone some treatment. He’s got huge dark circles under his eyes, but he looks mostly at peace. The Winter Soldier seems to have been easier to dispose of this time.
“Uh,” Peter scratches the back of his head, Steve takes the time to properly look at him. His hair is greasy, and his face has bruises and scratches all over it. “Use a knife?” Peter bites his lip, looking a little guilty.
“Well, if we’re going to keep doing this as a team, then I need to get with the programme,” Tony mutters, though the suit amplifies it anyway. “Okay, clench up Capsicle.”
Warm water sluices down Steve’s back as he lathers shampoo through his hair. The realisation hits him slowly, it feels like a comforting, pleasant, light spreading through him. He loves Bucky, and he loves Tony. There’s no panic, just a little confusion, he wonders as he’s washing the shampoo out if loving two people at once is accepted in this century; he knows that there’s so much of what is and isn’t okay nowadays that he’s missing. He's torn in half or feels like he is. Not one thing he read about this century could have prepared him for it, Tony has been there for everything, every panic attack; he's there at the end of every SHEILD mandated therapy session. In return Steve has been there for him since he got back from his cross-country road-trip; they had fallen for each other without even noticing it. His feelings for Bucky, though, they have never left him, not since Steve was old enough to know what love meant. Pondering on his feelings for a moment, he doesn't notice when he gets shampoo in his eye.
“Sergeant,” is all Tony has to say, his voice wavering a little bit; he hopes the team will ascribe the wobble to the comms.
“Where’s Natasha?” Tony looks around, “JARVIS where’s Natasha?”
“Scan is now twenty-five percent complete, Sir. I am running the symbol through my databases, Captain, I will contact you as soon as I can,” JARVIS replies. “Sir there are five agents coming up the corridor directly in front of you.”
Tony,
“You can only try your best, Tony,” Steve sighs, “it’s going to be hard, but you’re the only relative he has left, and you might have only met him a couple of days ago, but he clearly likes you well enough. You’re a family now, like it or not.”
“You never asked, Stark,” Bucky smiles ruefully, “don’t think I’d’ve remembered if you’d asked me a couple’a months ago anyways.” He shrugs, “the recipe only came back to me tonight.”
The room is so cold and clinical, there’s nothing in there save for a bed and two chairs. There isn’t even a window. SHEILD insists on caring for Bucky at HQ and Steve knows better than to resist. He wishes that there was something to take his mind off things. The walls are painted a disgusting off-white colour, like rotten milk. Steve feels himself falling apart, slowly, but surely with the beep of the heart monitor, tapping out a rhythm to which he’s losing his mind. There is nothing he would not give for Bucky to wake up, he would lay down his life so that Bucky would live. His best friend has had far too harsh a life, far too sad an existence to die now. Steve is crying, he knows he’s crying; he’s pretty sure he hasn't stopped since he sat down in the chair some time ago.
“Yeah, I know,” Clint sighs, “I know. They’re together though. Barnes will keep him safe, you know he will. He’d die before anything happened to Peter.”
“Ugh, if that’s you when you’re out of shape I can’t wait to get my hands on you when you’re back in peak physical form,” Tony leans forward and squeezes his bicep. “Yeah, I think it’d be better for Bucky to take Peter the first time he tries jumping off a building, not that I encourage that, I’d just prefer for him to be with someone when he does it. He’s my kid. He’s going to do anyway, I just want him to do it with adult supervision.” Tony pulls Bucky up so that they’re face to face, Steve turns around in-between Tony’s legs. “Make sure he comes back in one piece, yeah Barnes?” Tony grins as he kisses Bucky on the lips gently, before deepening it. Bucky can feel Steve’s eyes on them, burning into the back of his head, before he breaks the kiss with Tony and turns to Steve.
Tony takes his place by Barnes’s bedside, he’s alone with the sleeping man. Memories, from when they first brought Barnes in, fly through his head, he can see them as clear as day. Barnes was silent for the first week, he never said anything, just followed Steve around like a lost puppy; Tony remembers the first time Bucky spoke to him. They were in his workshop, Tony was working on Bucky’s arm; he’d been drawing up specs, he’d threatened to give Bucky a bright pink arm if he didn't say what colour he wanted. Bucky had looked at him right in the eye and said, ‘do it, I dare you.’ Tony had been a little in shock, but he’d laughed anyway and told JARVIS that he could keep the silver. Since then, he likes to think that they have become pretty good friends, sometimes, in the darkest crevices of his mind, Tony wonders if they could ever become more. The thought dies before he can truly mull it over, every time, he wills it so; he has Steve, and Steve is good and kind, and amazing, and so far out of Tony’s league.
“JARVIS,” Tony calls, “any signs of life?”
“Sure thing, need a boost though,” Clint grins and hops down from the tree he’d been sitting in, “can’t just jump on to the roof, Cap.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The battle is hard, it takes a lot out of them, but soon enough they seem to be reaching the end. All of them are outside a room that has been barricaded from the inside. The Hydra agents are making their final stand. Tony knows they have Ben with them, that if any one of them makes one false move, then Peter will have lost both his aunt and uncle; he knows that it will be his fault. Steve is in front of him; even Captain America hasn't been left unscathed, there’s a massive cut just above his left eyebrow, it must have bled a lot because there’s a broad red streak trailing down his face. Tony looks up at him asking a silent question, he’s not wearing the face plate, and Steve presses two fingers to his chin keeping it in place as he looks at Tony’s face. Steve moves to pull away, but Tony grabs his wrist, not willing to let the comfort go then. There’s an eyebrow raised in a question, but Tony shakes his head, the rest of the team is looking at them; there’s a strange feeling in the air like time has paused. Then a shot echoes from the room and they’re in action again, Tony slams down the face plate and kicks open the door.
Don't forget to come yell at me on tumblr @wxntxr-sxldxxr
“If I may,” JARVIS interrupts as Steve starts to send himself into a panic. “Here are some resources detailing polyamory; they might be of use to you, Captain Rogers. Another thing, Captain,” JARVIS pauses like he’s waiting for Steve respond.
Tony feels the walls closing in on him, the room is suddenly too dark; Steve is suddenly too close. His chest feels like it is being crushed under the pressure of a thousand imaginary waves of icy cold water. It feels as though there is nothing he can do, that he is in a car that is spinning off the road and there is nothing he can do to stop it. Steve is saying something to JARVIS, probably asking him to trace Bucky’s last known location but Tony only hears it like Steve is behind glass. His body has become his enemy, his lungs won’t work properly and his brains won’t think anything but ‘not again’ the words repeat for him two thousand, three thousand times becoming more and more garbled with each repetition. Tony knows that he’s having a panic attack, he is violently aware of it, he can pinpoint the exact moment worry became fear which became something more. His entire world is off its axis, spinning wrong; he feels like he exists somewhere slightly to the left of where everyone else is.
“I was in Siberia, being cryogenically frozen and then brought out to kill people, forgive me for not being up to date with pop culture.” Bucky sighs, he tries to be annoyed, he really does, but he can’t help the warm feeling that bubbles in the pit of his stomach and worms its way up through his chest. He’d been floating for so long, aimless, with no family to ground him; but now, now he has everything he’s ever really wanted.
@tonystark congratulations all of you.<<
Bucky’s whole demeanour changes in a matter of moments, he’s smiling brightly a Bruce, like he hasn’t just been rejected by his best friend. “That’d be great, Doc, thanks. I used ta cook, you know when Stevie was too sick. Never was great-“
Tony shifts as Bucky leaves, moving so that his head is in Steve’s lap. Steve looks down at him; Tony is so far gone, Steve knows that if Tony weren't exhausted, he wouldn't have his head in Steve’s lap. It is not something Steve has never seen before when Tony is tired he tends to use the nearest person to him as a pillow, but it’s never been Steve before, always Bruce, or Natasha, even Clint sometimes, never Steve. He doesn't quite know how to react, Bruce usually just sits there; Tasha pets Tony’s hair, and Clint draws funny things on Tony’s face. Steve opts for Bruce’s approach, keeping still, letting Tony do whatever he needed to do. That works for a while before Tony grabs Steve’s hand and puts it in his hair.
“Shit,” Bucky says, looking down at Tony’s relaxed face, his hair is sticking to his forehead both damp with sweat; but there’s no panic etched into his features, he looks peaceful. Bucky really doesn't want to move him, but he also knows that Tony really shouldn't spend a night on the sofa. “Come on; Stark lets get you to bed.”
“Yes. Fuck yes. Patch her through to me, now.” Tony sits up, his heart pounding; luckily the conference was always going to be held in a room in Stark tower, so he doesn’t have far to go.
“We just, uh, announce our marriage?” Bucky smiles as Clint’s jaw dropped. Over the past few years, they’ve become good friends. Grudgingly. And it’s a friendship neither of them admit to.
“Jurassic what now?” Bucky asks, looking at Tony with furrowed brows.
“I can hear you thinking, please just go to sleep,” Steve whispers in his ear, “we’re going to have so many mornings like this, you don’t need to take all of this one in.”
“How many times, Barnes, do I have to tell you that I have enough reasoning skills to know that it wasn’t you, not really. I know that you’d never do anything like that now. Should I record myself saying that I forgive you so that you can listen to it once a day?” Tony shoos him out of the workshop, “now go take my son to get ice cream, maybe see a movie or something, there’s a new Jurassic Park thing out; he’d like that.”
“Hi,” Steve walks into the room, his hair is slightly damp from his shower, and he hasn't bothered to put a shirt on. He leans against Tony on the huge sofa, not before he leans forward and presses a kiss to each of their cheeks. “JARVIS said you wanted to set up my twitter again? I still don’t know how it works.”
“I’m glad he’s okay,” Steve mumbles into Tony’s chest, he can feel Tony’s hand combing through his hair; he loses himself in the touch. “I’m so tired.” He yawns Tony can feel it against his skin, the small puff of air. “I’m tired of watching over friends as they lie in hospital beds. I just feel like there's nothing I can do, I'm supposed to be a hero and there's nothing I can do.”
“Where’s the power room located?” Natasha asked.
“I’m sorry if I’ve been making you uncomfortable the past few weeks,” Tony started. There was no reason to drag this out any longer than it had to be. “I mean, even without Barnes’ death glares, it’s pretty obvious I’ve been doing something to make you avoid me.”
Tony didn’t bother to look up as heavy footfalls quickly approached them.
Tony paused, physically stilled in the air. He twisted around until he could see where Steve was standing on the ground, looking back up at him.
Suddenly he was regretting not taking Rogers up on more of those training sessions he insisted on.
“M’sorry. I got…distracted.”
“Ugh, I think I got snot all over my mask.” He groaned, rubbing at his shoulder. “I need a nap.”
bothering you.”
“Hey, stay focused.” She reprimanded him before taking out a dagger and attacking it’s face once more. Steve shook his head, trying not to let himself be distracted by Tony and Bucky.
“Pete—”
Well, it was better than nothing.
“You’re a strategist, Cap. Sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire.” He plopped down on the opposite end of the couch and swung his feet onto Steve’s legs. “I just need a willing boyfriend. Or girlfriend. A date mate. I’m not picky.”
alien invasion, and although it wasn’t a New York level threat they weren’t about to take any chances.
“Fever broke an hour ago,” Bucky voiced over Peter’s head, and then added, “I already called May and let her know.”
Stephen Strange and Wanda worked with Friday to set up the simulation training, adding illusions and effects to the area and training bots. They kept to their teams, getting a feel for the new dynamics on the spot and learning to cover each other’s weak spots and set the other up for success. Sam and Rhodey already had a comfortable camaraderie, working in tandem like a well-oiled machine. Fighting alongside Peter was a struggle at first, with Tony’s overprotective streak and Peter’s need to impress his mentor, but after a few a hiccups they found a rhythm of Spider-Man distracting the enemy and dodging a few hits before Iron Man swooped in and covered him, repulsor blasts finishing the job.
Bucky shook his head and waved him off. Tony let out a relieved sigh. “I’m just glad you’re feeling better.”
“Just, try to close your eyes, Tony.” Steve said softly.
Tony nodded and tried to smile without letting the mouthful of hot dog spill out of his mouth.
where it is?” Natasha’s eyes narrowed at him and he raised his arms in surrender. “Fine, I know where it is. But I can’t just walk in there. I won’t make it five feet before someone recognizes me.”
, the edges of his mind still heavy with sleep. He pillowed his head back on Steve’s chest and let his eyes fall shut, too tired to get upset over it, and instead counted Steve’s heartbeats. It felt nice to be held, even better knowing it was Steve who was holding him. The past few days he felt like his mind and body were going a mile a minute, threatening catapult straight into the sun if he didn’t slow down. He felt grounded, physically and mentally. Steve would hold him down and stop his body from hitting the self-destruct button.
Tony looked up and met Rogers’ concerned gaze. “Don’t worry Cap, I have at least 30 seconds before I go into cardiac arrest,” A twisting pain shot through his chest, “Give or take a couple seconds.”
Tony was only taken aback for a second before a grin spread over his face. “You wish.”
Tony Stark was technically a genius in the academic sense, but he could admit that sometimes he had a lapse of judgement when it came to interpersonal relationships.
“You have to outbid them, Clint.”
It was a testament to how tired Peter must have been, because he didn’t argue or press on. He flopped to the floor with heaving breaths, the lenses on his mask closed.
And with that, Bucky left.
“Guns barely make a dent.” Sam added, his voice both in his ear and from somewhere behind him, still showering the two alien spiders with bullets.
“He was trying to set me up with you!”
“Tony,” Steve said with fake patience, “It’s eight o’clock.”
“Are you alright?”
“Oh sure,
Thor gave him a near imperceptible nod.
Clint made an impatient noise, jolting Tony out of his head. The image of a sweaty Steve Rogers pinning him down on the gym floor lingered for a moment before he physically shook the thought back.
“Hold on, you have something—” Thor reached over and swiped his thumb over Tony’s bottom lip, pulling it away to reveal a smear of ketchup.
It wasn’t like Tony had fallen in love with Thor in their brief time together, and they weren’t even together in any sense of a romantic relationship. But he was inexplicably going through the motions of a real breakup. If anything, he thought, he had grown comfortable with going through the motions of the day with someone at his side. That was mostly his fault, though. Instead of leaving it in the public eye he had been greedy, pathetically attached, to false devotion and the guise of intimacy and he had taken and taken, only to be cut off cold turkey.
She only gave him that look when he had seriously messed up and would be paying in at least three new pairs of shoes and one board meeting
“The Átta will not leave until it has consumed the core of your earth. We must defeat it in battle to end this.”
“Iron Man, what are we looking at?”
Tony blinked, caught off guard this early in the morning. He hadn’t expected anyone to be awake at this hour—he usually wouldn’t be if he had gone to bed, but he spent the whole night trying to recover and rework his armor.
Steve watched as Iron Man dashed through the air, avoiding Rorgg’s flailing limbs as he tried to grab Bucky’s outstretched arm.
“Remember we have team training this afternoon,” Steve said. He turned towards Tony, “I understand if you won’t be making it.”
Peter was nearly vibrating as he sized up Steve. It was a moot point, asking Steve to take it easy on him—even though Peter lacked formal training and the tactical experience of a century old super-soldier, he had a literal extra sense protecting him and faster reflexes. Tony was willing to bet that Peter was stronger than Steve too. And if Peter thought Steve was giving him a freebie, he’d undoubtedly push harder and force Steve to fight as an equal.
That wasn’t much better. Peter had been napping for around five hours, and spent more hours asleep today than awake. His sleep schedule was going to be all out of whack, and Tony had the distinct feeling that May would not appreciate him returning her nephew on a nocturnal schedule.
“Captain America hasn’t committed any felonies,” Steve said seriously. Peter’s eyebrows shot up and Tony could see the apologies starting to poor out, but Rogers lip quirked up in a smile, “As for Steve Rogers, that’s a different story.”
“Let him sleep in,” Tony said as he padded into the kitchen, “He deserves it.”
“No, I need to be with him.” Tony decided. Steve thankfully didn’t fight him on it. He took another deep breath, accepted a glass of water from Steve and filled another one for Peter, and headed back to his room.
Everything was fine.
“Speaking of sleep,” Steve tugged gently at Tony’s sleeve—the same blue dress shirt he wore last night, “When was the last time you got some?”
was later.
Steve looked up from his bowl of oats at the mention of his name.
Natasha was waiting for them at the window with a grim look on her face.
. Tony nodded, and curled back into Steve’s chest. Steve inhaled deeply beneath him, and his hand gently ran along his spine, coaxing him back to sleep. The tension in his body was already melting away at the sight of Peter and Steve rubbing his back. With his mind at ease and his body comfortably wrapped in Steve’s warmth, he fell into a restful sleep.
Bucky narrowed his eyes. “What’s the catch?” When Sam only shrugged, Bucky pressed on, “What thing of mine did you steal, break, or lose?”
Tony excused himself and headed towards Peter’s room. He knocked a few times, giving the boy ample time to hide any incriminating objects or make himself decent. A few seconds passed, no telltale sounds of a body falling out of bed and scrambling around the room. Tony knocked once more, a little louder, but the room remained silent.
“The people’s minds are already made up. I’m just running with it.”
he was in a relationship with Thor, something about Pepper breaking things off a few years ago because of his infidelity, an “inside source” gushing about their cosmically long distant romance—
“Sorry,” Tony hoped Natasha wouldn’t instantly chop off his balls as he pulled her in by her face and kissed her. To his surprise, she kissed back harder, flipping them around and covering as much as him from view with her body as possible. He stood pliantly, sandwiched between her and the wall for a few more moments, her hand coming up to caress his face as the guards walked passed without a second glance. When the footfalls disappeared, she broke free from the kiss and straightened Tony’s collar.
Bucky rolled his eyes and kicked open the door to Peter’s room, “I spent plenty of nights nursing Stevie back to health. I think I got this.”
“If that’s what you want,” Steve pulled out two spoons and a pint of Ben and Jerry’s ice cream from behind his back.  “Or we could exact revenge. You could go to the prom with Chase and show Thor what he’s missing.”
to stay with Peter.”
“We’ve got a problem.”
“You haven’t done anything wrong. I’m just—it’s just strange to see you and Thor together, I guess.” Steve admitted. Tony narrowed his eyes at him, because if Steve was avoiding him because he had a problem with him being— “Not in
Steve joined him on the floor and began stretching, “Everything alright?”
“You’re killing me, Steve. There’s no way I’m reaching across the Grand Canyon every twenty seconds to give you a bite of this,” Tony waved the sorbet in the air, “I thought you were my shoulder to cry on?”
“Right, you probably weren’t thinking. God, Steve. I have a
They weaved their way to the kitchens, thanks to a key card Natasha swiped from an unsuspecting server. Tony tried to angle himself away from any wandering eyes, and managed not to catch any lingering looks.
Tony spluttered, staring at Clint with a look of disbelief.
Clint snorted. “There’s just the small matter of a couple hundred eyewitnesses.”
“I do miss our little talks. It’s nice to see you again.”
Like this, safe in Steve’s hold, his body threatened to slip back to sleep.
, you don’t happen to be related to these guys?” Tony could hear the smirk on Sam’s face, “Can’t you coo at them and tell them to fly back to wherever they came from?”
. The next seven days were going to be a science extravaganza, something close to what he did during his spring breaks before he started joining other college students in Cancun, getting drunk off raspberry flavored Smirnoff Ice and dancing with strangers in a packed club to some top 40’s song.
“Sure, sure. I’ll put it on my list right after a mouth disinfectant to kill any infectious diseases you just gave me.”
Tony bent forward and grabbed his toes, the arc reactor touching the tops of his knees. “Just peachy, Cap.” Steve raised an eyebrow at him, and Tony sighed. “Peter seemed a little off this morning but clearly,” He nodded towards where Peter was excitedly greeting Scott, “Everything is fine.”
to Tony. Because that’s what it was starting to feel like. Lying. He couldn’t help but feel like he was taking advantage of Tony when he let him fall asleep on his chest, or curled an arm around him. Friendly gestures he used to throw around without thought now held so much weight. The scales felt tipped on his side—he couldn’t help but feel like he was getting more out of their relationship than Tony. It was bordering on deceitful.
“But since
Tony’s stomach somersaulted at that. A feeling started to curl in his stomach, something close to jealousy. But that made no sense at all. What did he have to be jealous over?
But he couldn’t keep
Ultimately, his curiosity had lost to friendship.
“I don’t want to keep you from Thor,”
“I was saving your life!”
“Alright Spider-man, why don’t you talk to your boy
“Look, Stevie is smart but he’s also a dumbass. You two have that in common,” Bucky sighed. Tony nodded reflexively, still trying to catch up, as Bucky continued. “Sometimes he needs a little push, ya know?” Another step. Their knees knocked gently together and Bucky’s other hand reached up to stroke Tony’s cheek.
“Alright, Fri. Increase power to the back repulsors, let’s say by five percent increments for now.”
at the metal casing through his sweatshirt.
Tony rolled his eyes, “Fine. No more long walks on the beach with Thor. Got it.”
He passed by Steve who was already dressed and showered for the day and Sam who was still in his running clothes, the smell of dried sweat lingering around him. Tony wrinkled his nose at him, and only got away with it because Sam is always immobile for at least a half hour after his runs with Steve.
When he woke up again, the room was considerably darker than when he fell asleep.
Peter gave him a reassuring smile. “I’m alright Mr. Stark. You can go back to sleep.”
“Thor?” Steve called out, hoping for an explanation to whatever they were fighting.
Tony’s shoulders slumped. “Yeah, well, it’s easy when there’s nothing on the line.”
. His big shoulders were hunched, rounded in a sheepish display.
All of them except for a pair of wide blue eyes from across the room.
That much was obvious. Most of them couldn’t get close enough in fear of getting swallowed to help. They had tried Steve’s shield, Thor’s hammer, Clint’s arrows. The parasite was impenetrable, and had a one track mind, unwilling to be distracted or led astray from its goal.
), and then went on his run. When he got back he started the coffee pot before taking his shower in hopes that the smell would lure Tony out of his workshop.
Tony nearly choked on his coffee as Pepper slapped down a newspaper in front of him. It took him a few seconds to process the unimpressed look across her face, her arms crossed against her chest. Why was Pepper at the compound? Why did she have a physical copy of the paper? Most importantly, why was she glaring at him with the intensity of the sun?
“It’s just cortisol and noradrenaline flooding my system. The adrenal medulla secreting hormones that are overriding any sense of logic.” Tony babbled mechanically.
“Isn’t that more
Tony couldn’t tell if he imagined the small smile that spread across Steve’s face.
Steve shook his head. “It’s…fine.”
“Okay. Right. But that’s the thing, we aren’t—”
“I wasn't planning on becoming a Capsicle again,” Rogers huffed out a laugh, “But if I do, I trust you’ll give me the
Just as Tony started to eat, a finger tapped on his shoulder and someone cleared their throat. Tony looked over his shoulder to see two girls, college aged, looking at the two of them with sheepish but bright eyes.
Okay. He definitely noticed.
Tony would’ve protested, but he was already half asleep.
Bucky rolled and clamped his arm around Natasha’s neck in a chokehold. The metal plates of Bucky’s arm whirred as Natasha struggled to get free, and elbowed him in the chest, not hard enough to crack a rib but enough for him to let out a grunt.
“How do you know—”
“Thor, any ideas on how to get rid of this thing?”
Steve’s morning resumed the same as always. He woke up at 5am, asked Friday if Tony had made it to bed last night (
“How are you feeling, Peter?” Bruce quietly asked. Peter flinched even at that, but let out a shaky breath.
never felt like enough.
Tony shrugged. “Wouldn’t hurt to hear him say it out loud once in a while.” It wasn’t like he was actually upset. He understood more than most how difficult it could be to show thankfulness in situations like this. Not because he was ever ungrateful, but a simple
“Rise and shine, Spidey-Boy!” Tony flipped on the lights as he entered, making a b-line towards the lump of sheets and blankets in the middle of the bed. “Wakey wakey, no eggs and bakey. Unless you ask Cap nicely, he—Jesus, what happened?”
Tony chuckled and led Peter out of the training facility and back towards the living quarters. “You did good today, kid. Wash up, eat, take a nap. You can meet me in my workshop when you’re rested up.”
He turned back around, greeted by the sight of Steve shaking DUM-E’s claw and talking to him in low tones, a fond smile on his face.
“He really enjoys these things.”
If none of
The ground beneath Steve started rumbling, not unlike what he’d imagine an earthquake would feel like. The pavement began to crack and split as a spider larger than any they’d encountered erupted from the ground. Large fingers digging through the earth hoisting a red, monstrous alien to the surface, it’s parody of a human face grinning wickedly down at him.
Bucky paused to give his shoulder a squeeze before he disappeared down the hallway towards his room.
“Public displays of affection make people uncomfortable,” She said with a cryptid smile across her face, “Steve could learn a thing or two from you.”
“They’re
“You can brag about being Steve’s first kiss later.” Clint said, looking antsy.
“I just wanted to see them happy.”
Tony took off after him. Thor was already a small dot in the distance, his form disappearing into the clouds. Friday helpfully displayed his current speed in the corner of the HUD, clocking in at just below Mach 2.
Like a period to the end of his sentence, Tony brought Steve into a gentle kiss. Their lips just brushing for a moment before melting into something soft and gentle. Unlike before, a wild confession in the midst of heat and adrenaline, this was almost reverent and unhurried, so full of love that Steve felt like if Tony let go his body would float off into the atmosphere. Tony pulled away but pressed a soft kiss to Steve’s brow, murmuring lowly against the skin there.
“There,” Clint said after a few minutes, pointing to an upper floor window. A light flashed three times before the room went dark again. Tony nodded and followed where Clint had already started down the hillside towards the estate.
Tony half registered voices quietly conversing above him. His side was pressed against a solid body, the soft thumps of a heartbeat underneath his ear. There was a hand carding through his hair and gently scraping against his scalp, and he let out a content sigh. The hand and voices stopped, and Tony frowned and furrowed his brow, his eyes still closed. He nudged his head a little and smiled when the hand returned to his hair a second later. He tucked himself into as small of a ball as he could, chasing the warmth of the body next to him, and slipped back into unconsciousness.
“You should try to sleep.”
“I don’t know, Buck was pretty upset about
Here, Tony could see it. He could see a flash of the Bucky Barnes his father and Steve remembered and talked about so fondly. He was charming without even saying a word, and there was confidence in every step he took as he brought them around the dancefloor. Tony almost melted in his arms, not quite swooning, but completely entranced in the complete change of character in the man. This wasn’t James Barnes or the Winter Soldier. This was Bucky.
Training was going smoothly. It wasn’t hard to integrate Spider-Man into their drills and exercises—he worked well as a bridge between air support and the ground fighters.
It had been ages since Tony had spoken to Thor. A couple weeks, maybe a month at least. It was hard to keep track of nowadays, with most of his waking hours spent focusing on SI as the fiscal year came to an end, and on Avengers business whenever he had a spare moment. Right now was a rare day where his responsibilities towards both were a bearable load, meaning he had an extra couple of hours to dedicate to his own personal projects. Building a new Iron Man suit being the first on the top of his list.
“You really don’t expect me to scale a wall, do you?”
“Yeah, Tasha wiped the floor with him.” Clint said with a fond look towards the redhead.
“Alright. Try to get some rest, Tony. He needs you at your best.”
“You don’t know how, how
“Where’s Peter?”
. But he deserved to know, he deserved an explanation. Bucky didn’t seem to mind or find his attraction a threat, which he shouldn’t, because he would never try to undermine their relationship despite his own feelings, so maybe Tony wouldn’t either. Or at least, Bucky would help smooth things over, with Tony being more inclined to listen to him.
“Where’s Peter?” Bruce yawned.
“I’ve got the hard drive,” Natasha patted the rectangular form sitting in her apron’s pocket, “But we’ve got to move, now.” She threw open the window and secured their rope. Tony reached forward, but Natasha intercepted his wrist. “I’ll go first.”
World’s leading authority on waiting too long
sexy, and more painful than he imagined, though had a hunch that was due to his earlier threat— he barely had enough energy to shed his clothes and cross his bedroom. Despite the soreness already radiating through his body, it felt good to be back. Even Rogers’ nagging felt less annoying than usual. Tony might have even appreciated his concern.
She was right, of course. The storage room was about as far away from the main ballroom where the auction would be held. There was no reason for anyone to be wandering all the way in the back manor of the estate. There was nothing to worry about.
“You just wanted to win the bet, Barnes. I’m calling interference.”
“Jeez, easy on the civilian, Nat.”
Steve gave him a short nod before he disappeared around the corner.
“Why the hell do these things have
“Nope.”
special between him and Tony. He was his own special category in his mind, a mix of new feelings attached to his name, separate from friends or family. It was incomparable. It was different than his friendship with Sam or his bond with Bucky. If anything it was more appropriate to say it was adjacent to what he felt for Peggy. Equally as important, but somehow
“I, um, I talked to Buck last night.” The words stumbled out, considerably less confident than he was moments ago. The light, teasing atmosphere was suddenly gone as Tony’s expression shifted marginally, brows slightly drawn. He was rapidly becoming hyperaware of their proximity, the point where Tony’s knee was still pressed against his leg abruptly felt all too much.
“I’m really sorry.” Peter said, “I didn’t mean to ruin spring break.”
That seemed to open the floodgates. As they finished their food and walked through the park they were stopped four more times. It was barely a nuisance, as Tony had grown up with this kind of attention, but a few flashes of light in the of the corner of his eye meant the paparazzi were starting to gather, and as much as he loved meeting new people and making their day, he hated the paparazzi more.
Tony circled around so he was facing him head on. Steve’s gaze remained fixed on the punching bag in front of him. Tony huffed.
“For a genius you sure are daft as fuck.”
here?”
“Are you going to paint my nails and tell me there are other fish in the sea, Cap?”
Tony brushed Peter’s curls off his forehead and gently pressed the ice pack over his eyes and forehead. Peter whimpered but pressed into the cool bag.
Steve’s eyes snapped open, finding Bucky’s dark silhouette emerging from the elevator. His bowtie hung loose around his neck, sleeves rolled up haphazardly around his elbows. He carefully didn’t read too much into his friend’s debauched appearance. He deserved that peace of mind.
With that, Rorgg’s eyes rolled back into his head and his grip on the web dome loosened, his breaths growing even more strained.
“Bathroom?” Tony asked, but Peter shook his head.
Steve passed Tony a paper box with an assortment of breakfast pastries. Tony took a blueberry muffin before handing the box back with a thankful glance.
Tony spent the rest of the night, steadfastly keeping watch over Peter, thinking about the
Tony grunted. “Repulsors are managing to stun them.” He replied shortly.
“Don’t yell at me when your arm falls asleep.” Tony mumbled.
A knock at the door made his eyes fly open. He hadn’t even remembered closing them. He haphazardly finished cleaning himself and got dressed.
“Well, I was hoping to convince you to go to bed—”
“Clint, keys,” Natasha ordered, and Clint nodded, heading towards the valet to grab their car. The two of them stood near the entrance, far enough away not to be recognized, but close enough to hopefully not look suspicious. Tony tried his best not to look like an injured man on the run, but it was hard to remain inconspicuous when it felt like his chest was caving in.
school PSA’s to the team.”
Bucky snatched the box from Steve, who was in the middle of grabbing a bagel. Steve pouted. Tony broke off a part of his muffin and offered it to him. Steve beamed.
“Right now? I’m on top of the tram where my dearest Tony left me—” He took a sharp turn, already headed towards where his HUD zoomed in on Clint standing atop the Roosevelt Island Tram where a dozen of the flying creatures were circling him, “In about five seconds? The East River if Stark doesn’t hurry it up.”
Steve’s face was suddenly a few inches away from him. Tony could see him, but it was hard to get a good look at him in the midst of the chaos.
“Tell me again why I’m here?”
Tony moved from Clint’s chest to his mouth, his lips already a dull shade of blue. He pinched his nose and quickly breathed two short breaths into his lungs.
And then Bucky’s lips were on his. For a second it was just lips pressed together, Bucky making no further move to deepen it. Only when Tony finally caught up and pressed back did it turn from a brief touch to downright sinful. Bucky kissed like he fought—ruthlessly, like his life depended on it. He bit Tony’s bottom lip, eliciting a moan from him before he licked his way inside of Tony’s mouth. Their tongues twisted, Bucky’s running across the top of Tony’s mouth, sending a shiver down his spine. He pulled away in favor of nipping down his jaw and neck, his hand running along his ribs, the other fisted in his hair, pulling his head back to bare his neck as if they weren’t in the middle of a crowded room. He sucked a spot right below Tony’s ear, teeth scraping against the sensitive skin before returning back to his mouth. Tony moaned something whiny and high in the back of his throat as Bucky wedged a leg between Tony’s thighs.
Things came to a screeching halt in Tony’s mind and he froze up, realizing what he had just done. Thor would surely push him off, they weren’t out in public and on display. He was overstepping a boundary, crossing a line, showing how desperate and pathetic he was, that he’d accept affection even if it was a fabricated lie.
“Iron Man, think you can give me a lift to Rorgg?” Bucky called out. Out of the corner of his eye Steve saw the red and gold armor swoop down and lift Bucky bridal style into the air towards Rorgg.
Their game of cat and mouse slowly morphed into a comfortable, almost leisurely flight, that was more of a dance than anything. They twirled through the clouds like ribbons, flying close enough that Tony could reach out and grab Thor if he wanted. The air was thin this high up, and even though the Iron Man suit was pressurized, Tony felt lightheaded in the best possible way. If he could, he’d spend all day up here.
“Shit!” Tony fell back onto his ass as Clint pushed him off and turned onto his side with a groan. Tony flopped onto his back and threw his arms over his face, the adrenaline still coursing through his body, but relieved to hear Clint breathing again.
Tony was
Tony only raised an eyebrow in return, but Bucky laughed and dragged him by the waist towards the center of the room. Bucky’s metal arm grasped his own, his flesh and blood hand pressed to the small of his back. They were pressed incredibly close, their faces only inches apart. It was hardly a dance—they swayed back and forth for the most part, an intimate moment to a slow jazz song that had Tony’s head swimming in brief confusion at the whole thing.
“One of those was actually for me.” Steve said lightheartedly, stepping close enough so as Tony spun his knees knocked into his legs, stopping his movement. Tony stared up a him with a frown while raising the mug back up to his mouth.
Tony stared at the grainy photos of him and Thor. They certainly weren’t the most compromising photos of him that had been published. In fact, they were extremely mild in comparison to his past front page scandals.
against the back of his hand.
Tony didn’t bother to look up as Rogers entered, eyes scanning the arc reactor core for any damage.
“Always happy to meet fans,” Tony added once he managed to swallow without choking himself. He stood next to Thor as one of the girls pulled out her phone and switched it to the front camera. Tony wrapped his arm around Thor’s shoulder and smiled brightly as the girl started taking rapid fire photos.
“I can hear you thinking.”
“Right. I guess you saw…” Tony gestured his hand in a noncommittal wave as his words trailed off. Steve nodded. There was no use in dragging this out any longer than it had to be.
“Stranger things have happened.” Tony said. Steve frowned, and he amended, “Sorry, bad joke.”
“Thanks. It was Cap’s idea.” Tony said as he started removing his helmet. “Hey, help me out of this? I think the acid is starting to eat through my armor I’m only sort of fond of my limbs.”
With an apple in hand, Bucky plopped down on the opposite end of the couch, the sound of him crunching happily on his snack and being
If Clint could do it with a month old tailbone fracture, so could he. He gripped the rope and climbed, steadily ignoring the growing burn in his chest and shoulders. It only took Tony a few more minutes than Clint, but he made it up in one piece and with only a few droplets of sweat on his forehead to show for it.
“I figured,” Steve said, “Put on your shoes. We’re going out.”
“Steve was busy,” Ouch, “And you know the layout better than any of us. We’re counting on you to maneuver us discreetly while inside.”
"I'Ll uPdAtE eVeRy oThEr DaY!" *insert clown emoji*
Or maybe it was just dating
At this point, there was only one thing left to try.
Tony nodded, looking like he knew how absurd it sounded.
Maybe he would let Peter take one of his less intimidating cars out for a spin in the parking lot. May
“One second, honey.” Tony replied, blasting through the snow filled sky and taking down as many pigeon-pterodactyl hybrids as he went, “PETA’s going to have a field day with this one.” He mumbled, already irritated at the PR nightmare ahead of him.
The jealousy dissipated, leaving him with a heavy feeling of defeat. “I was yapping your ear off for months. God, Buck. You should have just told me.”
“I could use a lift, Iron Man.” Clint’s voice crackled over the comm.
“Hey, do you want to help me teach DUM-E how to write the rest of the alphabet?” Tony blurted out, “After you taught him how to write his name he’s been practicing,” he continued, the heat rising up his neck as Steve kept staring, “He can hold a pencil without breaking it and, um, he doesn’t tear the paper anymore, so,” he trailed off.
happy for you and I respect your relationship with Bucky—I would never try to undermine it— but I can’t keep living with this secret inside me. I don’t want to lie to you anymore.”
“I think I just made Bucky’s hit list.”
Peter groaned and peeked open an eye, squinting at Tony.
Across the room sat the circuit breakers behind a metal gate. Tony deflated when he realized that it was lock and key, nothing he could hack his way into.
“Let’s get this show on the road, unless you’ve got one hundred thousand euros to spare.” Clint said tightly.
Everything was not fine.
“Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation isn’t required anymore,” Natasha was suddenly at Tony’s side. “Chest compressions alone are proven to be equally effective.”
“It’s just a runny nose.”
The sharp pain of the brick cracking behind him only lasted a second as he limply fell over on the ground, his vision going black almost immediately after. When he opened his eyes again, he saw Iron Man quickly approaching him. He took a shuddering breath, but his ribs twinged as they expanded, knocking the breath right out of him again.
“We don’t have a minute, Stark. Bidding’s started and the hard drive is up next.” Clint said through clenched teeth.
?” Sam shouted as he whizzed past Steve, dodging another swinging leg. True to his word attached to the ends of each leg was a four fingered hand.
And finally, thank you for the love on the first chapter! This is my first Stony fic, so I appreciate the kind words :)
Maybe Bucky had grown tired of Steve’s pissing and complaining after all these years, maybe he wanted to see what all the fuss was about—Steve couldn’t exactly blame him. He’d spent years wondering what it would be like to be the object of Tony’s affections. Tony was a passionate man—anyone could tell that just by looking at his work at SI, with the Avenger— and it wasn’t hard to imagine that passion extending to his love life.
He’d seen Steve turn down and refuse plenty of dances before, albeit with genuine regret. He didn’t even know if Steve could dance—the super soldier serum helped his reflexes and Steve was a fast learner; certainly if he wanted to dance, even if he didn’t know how to, he would pick it up fast enough to be flying around the ballroom like a pro.
“Hey, hey, hey. Before you disappear, what do you say you go on a fly with me?” Tony knocked his gauntleted hand twice against his helmet, “Just finished up this one and I need to take it on a test run before it’s officially in commission—I love all my kids equally but this one takes the cake. How does Carol put it? Higher, further, faster, baby.”
“I am not protecting anyone. Because David is great and he have never hurt me.” He replies never wavering from his script, because nobody could know what was going on, nobody would understand. Rachel smiles softly to him as she takes another sip from her coffee and remains quiet as if she was trying to read him and make a report on him.
When they break apart Tony moves around to the back and starts to move the leather over the skin there, muscles rippling where he touched softly and without a warning he is hit over his shoulders one, two, three, four times, each one harder than the one before making his skin burn and him bite his lower lip to not scream out. The leather moved over his spine down to the perfection that was Steve’s butt. At least if you asked Tony. Two clashes on each side. “Your ass could even make a guy like me believe in a god.” Tony mutters as his finger traced over the probably red marks that lingered there now. “What is your color sweetheart?” He asks softly.
Tony chuckles even though there was nothing funny about it. “You want to hear that story? It’s a long one.”
Their deal to not go to bed angry seemed out the window as well. Steve went to bed after he put down Joanna for the night at 8.30 pm.
“Mine…” He murmurs against the blonde’s lips.
“Did you know that the Gracias down the street got a divorce?” He questions and Tony just shakes his head. “Married for thirty years and three kids together and she devoted her entire life to her husband and kids. Kindest woman you’ll ever meet.” Steve continues and Tony is still not catching on. “Now she lives in a studio apartment because that is all she can afford after the divorce and is forced to begin working again and she is 58...”
“And as far as I am concerned I have not allowed you to go to Japan! How long will you be gone?! Who are you going with and who are you seeing? I can’t let you leave for another country without some warning. You know that I don’t handle you leaving well!” David calms down to a whisper and sits down on a chair.
Tony’s face went blank. He couldn’t speak, his chest felt tight and his heart was beating fast. Steve will think he is ridiculous for thinking that he could protect Steve. God he was stupid there was nothing he could do to protect Steve even less so when he was hiding out at Steve’s apartment. His sight was getting blurry and his breath was getting shallow. And now he was having a panic attack. Great. Just fucking great! He gripped the doorknob until his knuckles turned white as he was trying to even out his breath and calm himself down. It didn’t help. His chest tightens even more and it seemed like his heart was on its way out of his chest.
Steve situated himself on the left side of Tony’s bed, maintaining a respectable distance between them, while Friday queued up
Clint sighed dejectedly. “They must have brought it out of storage right before we got here.”
He shrugged his shoulders, but couldn’t quite shake the crawling feeling of guilt tickling the edge of his arc reactor.
Steve managed to prop himself up on his elbows as Tony hastily landed next to him flipping his faceplate up, a mixture of worry and annoyance on his face.
Steve nodded solemnly. “You and me both.”
Tony couldn’t tell what he wanted more, to befriend or study him.
“I’m fine! I landed on a bag of fertilizer!”
and let him know we have enough ugly spiders here.”  Sam suggested.
. His body finally caught up to his mind, and his heart nearly jumped out of his chest. He was caught flatfooted, his mind reeling over the past two weeks for anything that would have landed him in trouble.
Tony hadn’t made his way to the kitchen if the untouched coffee pot was anything to go by, so Steve poured two cups and went in search for the man. A quick look into Tony’s bedroom confirmed he was still in the workshop.
“Kid. Make it make sense, pronto.” Tony replied exasperatedly.
As he rinsed the suds from his hair, he reviewed the plan he prepared during his run. He didn’t want to ambush Tony and lay it all on him, at least, not until he had a couple hours of sleep in him. He would have to ask Friday what Tony’s schedule looked like today to see when would be a good time for them to talk, preferably not before something important. God forbid he took Steve’s confession poorly only to have to rush off to dinner with an international shareholder.
“What would I do without you?” Tony winked at him and turned back to the camera, giving them a few more photos without his face covered in condiments. The girls thanked them and ran off, talking with their heads bent close together in hushed, excited tones.
“Steve?” Tony called, turning around to face him.
“Is touch okay?”
“Really? You think I just
Steve stopped mid-step, hand on the door frame, and looked at him. His face was soft and open— eyebrows faintly raised, lips slightly parted. His eyes darted back to Peter’s sleeping form, unguarded worry passing across his features, and returned back to Tony. Steve had pulled him out of his head when he had every reason to leave him to his own devices. He stayed with him to make sure Peter was alright when nothing was forcing him to stay.
“Thank you.” He said simply. He ducked his head, overwhelmed by Steve’s gaze. The two words weren’t nearly enough to express what Tony was feeling.
“Behold your king, spider men! Claim and conquer this land!” The large alien spider bellowed out. The alien spiders began slashing and spitting webs with a renewed fervor, pushing them from their weak offense to pure defense. Steve blocked a thick black web with his shield, ducking his head from the electric sparks flying off the web.
“Anyway, I think I’m going to head home.” Bucky grasped his shoulder and squeezed, “If you break his heart, I’ll personally make sure all your coffee is decaffeinated for the rest of your life.”
“Fight or flight,” Steve elaborated.
That made Steve look up from his book. He stared at him with a furrowed brow for a long moment before he ventured, “Do I even want to know?”
“I think I have an idea.” Peter chirped, sounding as bright as ever. “Mr. Stark, have you ever heard of that old game,
“My sweet Anthony, I’m begging you to give us one more chance.”
Steve tucked his nose into the neck of his armor, able to breath just a little easier.
It had been
A female voice crackled faintly over the comm.
“I’ve got my sources.” Tony shot him a sly, conspiratorial wink. He jumped up from his workbench and started towards the elevator, “C’mon, Cap. Let’s see if you can teach an old dog new tricks.”
They traded blows. Peter dodged. Steve threw a punch with considerably less force behind it than usual. They danced around the gym in an evenly matched fight, the minutes passing in a tense silence only with the occasional grunt from the two men.
Rogers cocked his head at him, a smug smile stretched across his lips, “Is Tony Stark admitting he was wrong? I must be dreaming—”
Pepper only bristled at that. “It’s Ralph Lauren,” She said tartly, and tapped a stiletto-shaped red nail against the newspaper in front of him, “And you can explain
He blinked a few times, letting his eyes adjust to the dim lighting. He gently lifted his head to see Steve, his mussed hair and peaceful features bathed in the soft blue light from the TV, passed out underneath him.
In case the title of this chapter freaks you out, I will assure you right now that the kiss in this part is NOT sexual/romantic. It's a purely familial kiss from Tony, to Peter's head. No lips will be touching here!
“Just in a mild cardiac arrest thanks to bird brain.”
you can do,” Steve said from the couch, not even looking up from his book. Tony shook his head and paced across his workshop.
“Hey! That’s cheating!”
“Stark! Are you alright?” A second later there was a pair of warm hands on him, patting frantically against his ribs and down his sides. Tony blindly swatted a hand and the hands reluctantly retreated.
“I don’t know if you know, but I
! What were you thinking?” Tony crouched down, his armored hands hovering over Steve like he was afraid to touch him but couldn’t help but want to poke and prod to make sure he was still in one piece.
“Steve. Believe me when I say I don’t want anyone else.” He took a deep breath and smiled softly at him. “I don’t love anyone like you.”
With that, Clint sputtered underneath him, drawing in a deep breath and coughed water right into Tony’s face.
“Hey, at least yours looks good,” Clint frowned, running a hand over his wig, “You’ve got that silver fox charm going for you. I look like a drowned John Travolta circa Pulp Fiction.”
With that, Steve left.
Plus, he wasn’t trying to drag Steve’s name through the mud with him. Half of America would be on his front door step if he were to even lay a finger on America’s golden boy.
It was decided, he drowsily thought. He had to tell him. If his reaction tonight wasn’t proof enough that his feelings were starting to get out of hand, then he at least owed Tony the truth. And maybe it would help Steve move on if he laid it all out there. He’d been holding onto this secret for years. It was time he let it go.
That only left a handful of people. He couldn’t ask Pepper, that was an even bigger no-no for separate reasons. Rhodey and Carol were obviously not a choice. Clint was a big no, no explanation needed. Natasha would never agree unless his life were in danger. Bruce, well, as annoying as they were, he wasn’t trying to unleash the Hulk on a bunch of paparazzi. And he wasn’t quite on that level with the other Avengers to ask them to fake date him.
unfazed by the elephant in the room the only sound between them.
Tony was just donning the Iron Man suit as a bright technicolor beam of light flashed outside on the lawn, the branches on the distant trees blowing wildly in the gust of wind. The Bifrost dissipated and all that was left was Thor’s proud form stood atop burnt grass.
They finished the simulation and rejoined in the center of the room for Tony’s personal favorite part of training days. To an outsider it probably seemed barbaric—a little too Fight Club-esque for a bunch of global level superheroes—but the one-on-ones had its benefits. For one, it bred a special breed of camaraderie between them, to watch their fellow teammates beat this shit out of each other. Second, it gave the captains a chance to get familiar with every individual’s fighting style, something to keep in mind during individual training sessions.
“Fine, fine.” Tony mumbled.
Steve blinked. He couldn’t have heard that right, he must have hit his head harder than he thought. He blinked harder but Tony was still there, lips slightly parted, looking half mortified by his sudden confession, half imploring, like he so often did when willing someone to understand a simple concept.
Out of the corner of his eye he could see a poorly hidden paparazzi in the bushes, hiding like the animal they were. Tony had workshopped countless ideas for this moment; they could have a physical brawl in Times Square, a messy break at the top of the Eiffel Tower, a press conference turned screaming match in front of all the press.
Tony nodded, “Right. Just a reactive symptom.”
They finalized the upgrades to his suit just in time to meet the rest of the Avengers in the training facility. Peter perked up a bit surrounded by the heroes, bouncing on the balls of his feet as he animatedly talked at an exasperated Doctor Strange.
On top of all that, Steve apparently had some opinions on the matter.
With a wave of his hand the holograms blinked out of existence. Tony leaned back against his workbench and met Steve’s gaze.
Tony flung open the metal lockers, finding nothing more than a dusty hat in the top of one. Tony scanned the room once more. There was nowhere else for a key to be hidden, he wasn’t strong enough to muscle the gate open, and he didn’t have time to find and knock out a security guard in hopes of finding a key on their keyring. He ran a hand through his hair, tugging at the silver strands in frustration. He whirled back around to the gate, eying the metal bars. It would be a tight squeeze, but he could probably make it. He had to try, at least.
,” Tony half crawled, half dragged himself away from the toothy maw of the parasite, “I’m tapping out. Hawkeye, you’re in.”
Bucky stared at the box and then back up at Sam. “You got me a croissant?” He deadpanned.
“Right, I’m just the glorified GPS.”
If Peter wanted to spend the week science-ing it up with him, then he’d make sure it was the best fucking week of Peter’s life.
Uh...hi. Yikes. Sorry that update took so long. Life was kicking my ass, midterms and November due dates snuck up on me - all that jazz. I promise the next chapter wont take two weeks to be uploaded!
Steve screwed his eyes closed, roughly rubbing at the corners with his knuckles as the image of Bucky and Tony flashed behind his eyelids.
“…What?”
“You and
“Make sure you and the great leader of tomorrow take a lunch break.” Steve called after them.
Steve sighed. This was not how he wanted to broach the topic. “From where I was standing—”
See! Tony Stark can hang out with someone and it’s
He stepped out of his boots and tip toed to a spot clear of acid, not wanting to burn the soles of his feet. He stood next to Thor, admiring his handy work, sliding his gaze from the parasite’s dead body to Steve and further to where a group of civilians and news reporters were standing a few blocks away, cameras out to capture a glimpse at the creature and Avengers milling around.
The spend the drive back in a comfortable silence, quietly humming along to the radio.
“Tony, I—”
He was really, really trying.
“Do you want to move him to medical?”
As soon as Bucky landed the Quinjet safely they were jumping through the small gaps of the webbing and headed into town. The distinct explosion of one of Clint’s explosive arrows was followed by a groan from the archer.
“That’s good. Probably not meningitis.” Bruce mumbled to himself. Tony whipped around to Bruce.
“Careful, Cap.” Sam called.
“Fury’s called in a personal favor,” Natasha repeated, straightening out Tony’s tie. “A hard drive containing classified information on outer world technology and its locations is being auctioned off to some of the world’s corrupt conglomerates.”
with Thor.”
Thor’s kindness and enthusiastic participation didn’t stop once they were out of the limelight. After a particularly long day, Tony came home to the rest of the team gathered in the common room, spread across the sofas and floor, blankets and pillows distributed, watching a movie. Tony felt dead tired, he didn’t have the energy to walk to his room and collapse into his bed, and he was feeling overworked and a little needy for warm, nice, human interaction. He blamed it on his brain, half on autopilot at this point, when he dropped next to Thor on the sofa and curled into his side.
“Shower, food, then bed.” Steve ordered. Tony nodded, and starting going through the motions of undressing and showering. The door clicked shut behind him as he stepped into the hot stream of water. He stood there, leaning against the cool tiles as the hot water pelted into his back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Aw Sam, you’re starting to sound like a sore loser.”
Tony did a double take. “Excuse me?”
Hook, line, and sinker.
Steve ducked his head and rubbed the back of his neck, “And I guess I was a little jealous. I’ve missed you.”
Peter was starting to drag, his kicks getting sloppier and Steve’s fists coming closer. Cap of course noticed it too, and before Tony could really start worrying Steve caught Peter’s hand in mid punch and patted him on the back.
Steve rolled his eyes and dragged Tony through the compound and into the garage, pressing him into the passenger seat of his own car. Steve drove them into the city, the windows cracked open just a bit. Tony closed his eyes, soaking up the sun through the glass and relishing the feeling of fresh air hitting his face. When he opened his eyes again, the car was still and off, parked in a familiar parking complex.
“I’m pretty sure that’s cheating.” Bucky bristled.
a shower,” Bucky said dryly. “His room is starting to get stuffy.”
When he woke up the next morning Friday told him that Peter was still asleep.
“He wants to. Just hasn’t found the right dance partner.” Bucky shrugged, taking a slow sip from the tumbler in his metal hand.
“Pesticide DDT!” Peter replied, throwing one last can for extra measure.
He waited until she was a few feet off the ground to start his rappel down the wall. His chest ached, even more so with his labored breathing, but he kept his grip tight on the rope. It was a less coordinated climb down, more of a slide than anything if the rope burn on his hands meant anything. He tried to center himself as Clint made his descent, but all too soon they were on the move again, travelling through the tall grass towards the front of the estate.
At some point Tony’s breaths started to match Steve’s, and the tingling in his fingers started to fade. Steve continued to run his thumb across Tony’s neck, well past when Tony finally regained his bearings.
He had a funny look on his face, like he wasn’t quite comfortable with his plan, like maybe he wanted to say something but because he was a nice guy he wouldn’t.
Nothing came to mind, which only managed to make him more nervous.
“Fine,” Clint grumbled.
And between all that, Tony had remembered to leave time to eat and sleep. He was proud, to say the least.
Thank you for all the love on the last chapter 💕This one is a short one, mostly due to Bucky's efficiency.
Clint heaved in a heavy breath. "I think I shattered my ass."
“Steve Rogers also took drugs from strangers because they promised him super powers,” Clint chimed from the couch, eyes still focused on the video game in front of him. Steve furrowed his eyebrows, but after a moment he gave a reluctant nod.
When Tony showed up to the next movie night, Steve apparently another no-show, he bypassed the common area and instead headed toward the gym.
He already had his friendship—why couldn’t that be enough?
Rorgg immediately flinched away at the exploding cans, coughing and sputtering as Peter flung more towards him and Tony fired.
“Focus up.” Steve called, waiting for his team’s attention before continuing, “Thor and Iron Man keep the perimeter. Spider-man, I want you to figure out where those..
With his attention in front of him he helped Natasha take down one of the spiders. The two of them joined up with Sam and quickly fell into a rhythm that seemed to be working. As Sam kept the other spiders distracted, Steve and Nat took out the singled out one before moving onto the next. It was slow going and his limbs were starting to grow heavy. Every so often he glanced up, seeing Tony and Bucky circling Rorgg without much progress. Clint and Thor remained quiet over the comms, but the occasional explosions were starting to dwindle, and Steve hoped that meant they were making progress and not that Clint’s arrow supply was running low.
Thor nodded, his hand coming up to cup the back of Tony’s neck. Without preamble, no exploratory fingers or peppered kisses across his face, Thor leaned down and pressed his lips against Tony’s. He kissed him shortly, electric and wet, barely enough time for Tony’s eyes to flutter shut and lean into it. He could practically hear the camera lenses shuttering at an impossible speed.
“Hey Sparkles, long time no see.”
“Let’s get Hawkeye to medical and find Hulk. We can debrief after coordinating cleanup.” Rogers said, effectively ending their squabble.
“He does like supporting a cause he believes in,” the corner of Bucky’s mouth twitched upward in a half smile, “but what he really comes for is the dancing.”
The lights had returned and the heavy footfalls of guards sweeping through the estate echoed. A group of guards exited through the front, passing by the valet and fanning out in all directions, a pair of guards heading right towards them.
Tony paused, unable to see Steve’s face from underneath the car he was working on, but from his tone, even as calmly as he tried to sound, he could tell he was irritated.
Sam shot him an unamused look. “I’m hurt, Barnes. I ran all the way to the city to get you breakfast and this is the thanks I get?”
“I thought you were trying to convince people you’re
Bucky’s hand squeezed his hip. He cocked his head back slightly, his eyes half lidded, a wolfish grin spread across his face. He made an attractive sight.
“Eh, do as I say and not as I do,” Tony waved his hand flippantly in the air, paused, and then amended, “Actually. Don’t do as I say. And definitely don’t do as I do. You know what? When in doubt, consider Cap. He turned out alright.”
So here they were, in Central Park, about to end their one-month old relationship.
“Hey, Steve?” Steve looked up towards the kitchen where Bucky had moved to dispose his apple core, his jacket gathered in his arms. He smiled gently at Steve, and he let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. “Just talk to him.”
a billionaire.” Tony took the invitation and jumped into Thor’s arms bridal style. Thor, always a good sport, laughed and tightened his grip in warning, giving Tony only a second to snap his faceplate down before they were shooting off into the sky.
.” Rogers slipped an arm around his shoulders, and Tony's arm instantly snapped around his waist.
“Yeah, I saw you guys, ah, kiss.”
Predictably, Steve was there, his back to Tony, beating on a punching bag like it had just insulted his mother.
Tony ran a hand over his tired face. He called May the morning after Peter came down with his mysterious illness, apologizing and offering to send a plane to pick her up from her Girl’s Vacation in Rome, free of charge of course. After May had declined—she had been properly worried but expressed her trust in Tony to take care for her nephew—and Bruce had confirmed that it was just a nasty virus, Tony decided the least he could do was make himself available to Peter’s every beck and call.
He ground his teeth and decided it was now or never. He let out a muffled yell and forced himself through the bars, the metal caving into his chest with a pinching pain. He stumbled through the gate and barely kept his footing as he crashed into the electrical panel. The tight pain in his chest radiating with every breath.
He loosened his tie and sunk down onto the couch. He willed his mind silent for a few moments, trying to focus on emptying his head of anymore thoughts, only for a deep curl of jealousy to wrap around him in an uncomfortable hug.
“Hah! There you are.”
His eyes jolted open at the sound of sniffles.
Tony realized that there was barely any space between them again.
Maybe Steve hadn’t noticed. He probably had better things to do than hang out with Tony on his ratty couch.
“I’ll give them what they want and then throw it back in their faces. That should keep them off me for a while.” Tony explained, “I can date someone for a few weeks and really play it up, and then have a very public, very secondhand embarrassing, explosive breakup that not even the seediest reporters would want to touch with a ten-foot long pole.”
Tony flipped up his hood as they entered, following Steve throughout the store. He picked up chicken stock, a few vegetables, all the basic ingredients for soup. He threw in a few bananas, a bag of rice, and crackers in their cart, along with vitamin c and zinc supplements. A warm feeling bloomed in Tony’s chest, unrelated to the arc reactor, and his hand reached up to
Pepper seemed satisfied for the moment, and let out a sigh, “Good. I see any more scandals this week and you’re presenting at the next board meeting for me.”
“I didn’t know,” Steve said suddenly, “That you and Tony—that you felt that way,” He drew in a shuddering breath, “I wouldn’t have, ya know…” he trailed off.
Tony’s mind struggled to recall how they got
“He doesn’t like being paraded around like a monkey in a suit selling war bonds again.” Bucky continued.
He came to an abrupt stop as he crashed into Thor’s arms, covered in ropey, green acid. He looked back at the two halves of the parasite, it’s legs twitched for a few more seconds before it finally stopped moving.
“This isn’t, sorry, this isn’t—let me start over.”
“You wish, Sergeant. It takes a lot more than one dance to win this mechanical heart.”
wait here for my signal.” And with that she snatched the car keys from Clint and drove off towards the front gate of the estate. Tony and Clint watched from the distance through their binoculars, confirming that Natasha made it past the valet and inside.
Natasha continued to scan the room before turning towards Tony. “You’re going to have to create a diversion.”
about to fall on your face?”
Tony twisted enough to glance over his shoulder, greeted by the view of Steve leaning against his doorframe.
Guilt settled heavily behind his arc reactor.
They separated, both panting heavily and looking more disheveled than a minute ago.
Steve retreated to his own room, deliberately not looking at the elevator as he passed, and methodically started getting ready for bed, focusing his restless mind on unbuttoning every button of his shirt, and brushing each individual tooth. He slid under his covers and turned over a few times until he ended up flat on his back, staring up at the ceiling.
“Nope. I’m free tonight and I want to spend it with you and DUM-E. Unless you’re busy?”
Steve sat down next to him and dropped a hand over his shoulder. He started massaging his thumb in circles around the spot where the back of his neck met his shoulder. Tony scrubbed a hand over his face, but slumped into the couch cushions a little more.
“Can you try not to die again? My lungs can’t handle anymore CPR.” Tony wheezed as he began to sit up. Rogers was still hovering at his side, offering Tony a hand. Tony held onto it for a second longer than necessary, welcoming the warmth of his palm against his frozen fingers. Clint made a choking noise that had them both whirling back towards him. The archer wasn’t unconscious on the ground like he feared, but instead staring at Tony with wide eyes.

“Aye, I remember him now. Rorgg, king of the spider men. It has been some time since they’ve tried to conquer a planet like this.” Thor replied.
Steve’s resolve started to crumble as the silence stretched on between them. Tony had looked back up at him expectantly, expression soft and open, encouraging, if not a little curious. The sight of him made his mouth go dry. It was so easy to be swept up in Tony’s energy, he’d forgotten his nerves in the first place. But now, the confession he was prepared to make just a second ago was gathered like a lump stuck in the back of his throat. He was all too aware that this could be the last time Tony looked at him like that—unguarded, warmly, like a trusted friend.
“I think I’m done,” He said, “Sorry.”
of Steve’s thumb against his skin.
Bucky and Nat peeled off towards a few storefronts in search of civilians as Steve ran forward to join Sam. True to Clint’s word, he came face to face with what could only be described as a giant space spider. Thick red hide covered its arachnid body, it’s eight legs as tall as telephone poles. Sam darted between three of the spiders, laying gunfire as he dodged their swiping appendages.
“I heard about the breakup.”
“Lay it on me, Cap. I’ll do anything as long as I get to go home and take a
Tony huffed out a laugh, still sounding a little airy, “It’s a common sentiment—”
“I’d let you sleep in but we’ve been subpoenaed by Cap for training, and we need to finish up your suit.”
Tony rolled his eyes but extracted himself from his blanket cocoon and accepted the pint—
Later, he would blame it on his even more so diminished lung capacity and the lack oxygen.
“I’m just saying, isn’t the point of Spring Break to let loose—go get shit faced on chocolate milkshakes on the beach and sleep in until noon, or whatever kids do these days.”
“Ah, Anthony,” Thor turned towards him with a pleased look on his face. “How have you been since we last met?”
Steve released a breath he hadn’t known he was holding as soon as Tony has Bucky secured in his arms, but in the next second an aching in his chest enveloped him at the sight of them flying through the air together. He couldn’t help but stare at where Bucky’s metal arm rested on the armor’s hip, a similar sight to last night at the gala.
you?” Steve asked dryly, still in slight disbelief and shock.
Steve threw his shield at the one closest to him and let out a huff as his shield bounced off it’s back instead of lodging into its body. The alien spider spun around, and Steve almost dropped his shield as he was met with human-like eyes and mouth.
. Admittedly, it had been some time since he’d gone on a date, let alone dated someone. When he took a client out to a luncheon he brought Thor along, who swept Mr. and Mrs. Pavelski off their feet, and somehow made the business lunch
Tony rolled his eyes, “What, so you can catch me when I fall?” But Natasha was already out the window.
“Boys, play nice.” She chastised, a grunt, and then added, “My bites are useless against these things.”
“Is everything alright? Nat said the Italy mission was a success.”
Yeah. Asking Steve was a big no-no.
But he did agree with Bucky and Steve—he hadn’t left Peter’s room in the past two days, accepting food from whoever brought it—usually Steve—and only left Peter’s side to use the bathroom. His skin felt clogged and his undersuit was starting to get itchy. He didn’t even want to imagine what he smelled like to the super-soldiers.
“—really thankful that you guys are protecting us—”
To say Tony was happy to have Peter over for the week was an understatement. He was
But Thor only wrapped an arm around Tony without sparing him a glance, eyes remained glued to the movie in front of them.
“Come here, Sparkles. Let’s give the people what they want.”
“Great.”
Even though paparazzi never came near the compound, he avoided Thor for three days straight. When he did leave the compound he dragged a reluctant Carol and Rhodey with him to grab dinner, mostly because he knew no one was crazy enough to shove a camera in their faces with Carol at their side, but also half hoping that if they did get pictures then the dating rumors would be squelched.
"You should stop by medical too," Rogers knocked his hand against Tony's gauntlet, but his eyes darted towards the blue glow of arc reactor, "Make sure you don't have frostbite."
Peter ducked his head, “I didn’t mean to worry you guys, is all. Thanks for taking care of me”
“You’ve got to be—” Tony groaned, rubbing his temples with his gauntleted hand. “Steve. Listen to me. There is nothing,
“That is the biggest pile of shit I have ever heard,” Clint laughs as he sits at the breakfast bar, stealing some of Steve’s toast. “You are barely even an adult, let alone a functioning one. Thanks for breakfast, Stevie.”
“No really, I know what grown-up shit means, Bucky,” he grins, “as long as you keep being the fun dad, its fine. I need someone to sneak me chocolate cookies at night and stuff, so if you get to be my third dad that doesn’t mean you become all boring like Steve and Tony. Also, it’s Jurassic World, not Jurassic Island, Old Man.”
“Right, come on then,” Tony wheels Peter down the hallway, Peter is quietly, sleepily humming the Star Wars theme tune.
“I’ll give you the menus now, and you can just yell my name when you wanna order, Mr. Stark,” Mr. Evan Cyprus says to him, slapping Tony on the shoulder.
Lunch started at two pm, and it didn’t finish until well after six. Though no one shows any inclination of going home as they all gather in the living room. They’ve been really patient, barely anyone has mentioned the huge mound of gifts under the tree. Even Peter, who is young enough to be super excited, hasn’t mentioned the presents. But Tony is now shifting with anticipation as he eyes the boxes. Steve laughs as Tony wriggles next to him. Natasha is smirking at them from where she’s curled up on the sofa with Clint’s head in her lap. Lucky, Clint’s dog, is thumping his tail lazily against the floor. Bruce is napping in the recliner next to the sofa where Tony, Steve, and Bucky are cuddled up together. The others are all crowded around Peter’s new game that Tony spent most of November designing. They’d allowed him to have it whilst they were waiting for lunch; it was easier to keep a fifteen year old occupied with a game than it was to try and keep him busy with something else.
“Hot pockets are great food, you’re just old. And sure, have fun on your date!” Clint pushes past Bucky, grabbing his box of not food and bow on his way out the door.
“Wait, don’t freak out-“ Clint starts.
The ride home is quiet, they are sitting in the quinjet in silence; Tony is tapping at his holoscreen, murmuring quietly to JARVIS every now and then, Peter is pressed up against his side, his head on Tony’s shoulder. He’s sleeping, his breathing slow and measured, Tony allows himself to relax just a little; basking in the warmth of his son breathing and alive beside him. Steve is on Peter’s other side, he has his arm around him, his hand is resting on the back of Tony’s neck, playing with the little hairs there. Sam, Clint, and Natasha are stitching up their wounds; Thor is staring out the window, his arms folded, an unusually severe expression painting his face. Rhodey is flying the jet, he's talking to air traffic control, getting the positions of all civilian and military aircraft that could be in their way; his face is set in a grim line of determination.
“You gonna be okay, kiddo?” Tony asks. “Do you need to talk about what happened more?” Tony pats Peter’s head as the boy leans back in bed, snuggling against the pillows.
Tony walks like a zombie down the hall; he stands in the elevator watching the floors zip by as the elevator goes to down to the guest floors. His mind is racing, gears turning in his head; his thoughts are churning, and he can’t breathe. It feels like his lungs are closing in, even as he leans on the rail inside the elevator; his knees are like jelly, and he can’t feel his feet. Tony gasps for air, trying to breathe some feeling into himself. The doors of the elevator open and he steps out into the hallway, his eyes catching Steve who is waiting outside the room. He stumbles forward and into the warm cocoon of Steve’s arms.
“Clint,” Bucky breathes, his eyes widening; Natasha smiled at him, she didn't say anything else. Instead, she just took a swig from the bottle. “How? How does it even work? I’m not sure I feel like that about Tony, I like him, but…” Bucky trails off, taking the bottle from Natasha.
The AI is silent for a few beats. Tony can hear the sounds of battle coming from somewhere else in the building. “I’m sorry, Sir, I cannot find a pulse.”
“No, we don’t,” he shakes his head, not missing the way Steve grabs Tony’s hand and leads them both to the sofa opposite Clint’s chair. “I’m really sorry guys, but Nat recognised the Winter Soldier’s mark. It was inside a spider-“ Clint can see the exact moment Tony Stark falls apart, he can see it in the man’s eyes. The last spark of hope dying as tears well up but don’t fall. “We’re going to try and get them back, we know where some HYDRA bases are and we’re going to run raids on all of them in the next few weeks. We aren’t going to stop, I promise.”
Steve sighs hoping that Tony would. He didn’t need to ask if he was allowed to come over. Something was up with Tony that Steve was sure of. He just continues with his grocery list and just hopes that Tony would stop by so they could talk and maybe clear the air about what is going on.
“Let’s take our usual weekend and have Pepper watch them and when the winter break comes around we can go the whole family.” Tony knows there is no arguing with Steve now.
“Yeah?” David asks.
He hears Tony coming into the room, he hears him laying down things on the smaller couch and then he walks again and he sees the black leather shoes in front of his knees. Before he knew it Tony was kneeling in front of him and pulls his chin up carefully and looked at him with kind eyes. He had rolled the sleeves up to his elbows and unbuttoned the top two buttons showing his skin Steve notes. “Sweetheart I need to ask you something and the choice is yours and you are allowed to say no if you are not comfortable with it.” Steve nods waiting for Tony to continue. “My plan for tonight is to blindfold you and use a gag ball on you.” He reaches into his pocket of his slacks and pulls out a steel ball, no bigger than a golf ball. Tony holds it out between them. “You will hold this in your hand and if you want to safe word you just drop this and everything stops.” Tony explains to him in a soft and kind voice. “But if you are not comfortable with that I won’t use the gag ball on you. The choice is yours and there is not a wrong or right answer here. Whatever you are comfortable with.” Tony assures him knowing Steve wanted to go with the answer that pleased Tony the most even if he wasn’t comfortable with it himself.
David was sitting on the couch when he entered the apartment. His heart instantly begins beating faster, knowing something is about to happen.
“Yes it is! You have been working a month and since you began everything fell on me even though I also work and I probably work more hours than you do!” Tony was screaming at this point. “I will be at SI! I’ll call you later!” Steve doesn’t say anything he just watches as his husband walks out the door. He doesn’t even try to stop Tony because he realizes that Tony is right.
Tony moves away for a moment and is back with the spreader bar. “On all four, on the table.” He orders and Steve obeys. Tony spreads his legs wider before wrapping the leather cuff around his ankles, putting a finger in between the cuff and his ankle making sure they weren’t too tight. “You have to rest on your shoulders so I can tie up your hands.” Steve does as he told and rests his head on the table and puts his arms between his legs so Tony could tie him up completely. He was completely on display for Tony, who could do whatever he wanted with him. The feeling of complete helplessness made his cock twitch to life again. “Color sweetheart?” Tony asks and drags a hand over his spine as he moves to the front.
He sighs and start to work on his computer and turn on his music loudly as he usually does when he plays on his computer but now it wasn’t play it was opening up completely. It took him six years but he finally did it. “JARVIS ask Steve to come up here.”
“Yeah he is great. He is funny, not funny as you but funny and he is a lawyer so you know he is hard working!” Tony informs him and he nods and pretends that he is happy for him, of course he is happy for him but it stung that it wasn’t him Tony was talking about. Steve takes a sip of his coffee as Tony continues to talk about David like he put the sun and moon in the sky.
“I couldn’t risk it Steve. He made a lot of promises to me and trust me he made sure I knew it wasn’t just empty threats. And it may be selfish but if he would hurt you I couldn’t live with myself knowing I was the cause.” It was a slight outburst but he instantly looks down at the floor again like he did something wrong, like he wasn’t allowed to have feelings.
“Sir?” He asks when Tony pulled his dick back into his pants.
He chickens out.
“Tony don’t walk away..” Steve shouts after him while Tony shuts the door behind him.
Tony had been right; the Italian place was good but nowhere close to his mom’s food. He listened to David talk as he sipped his wine and chewed on his lasagna- David had insisted that he should try it because it’s the best in town according to him. It wasn’t and Tony made better in a rush but ate it and pretended to like it, like you do in the beginning of any relationship.
“I had to protect you…” Tony whispers. “I couldn’t live with myself if he hurt you…”
. His heart beat faster. Taking a hand up and feels the new collar, it was thicker and wider than the brown one he had, more metal details, no that alloy he thinks. Because Tony’s suit it made of it. He took a wild guess that the leather was red to. He was wearing Tony’s colors, he belonged to Tony.
“You would be a great dad you know that right?” Steve brings him back to their living room. Tony look at his husband once again. He had told him parts of his childhood but not the worst part since he knew that Steve had liked his father so he tried not to ruin his memory of him.
“Are you sure? Is there anything I can do Tony?” Tony relaxes a little thinking that it probably was a honest mistake from his side and David hadn’t meant to hurt him. Maybe he liked rough sex and simply got carried away. It didn’t have to be a more complicated answer then that Tony decides, or at least he tries to convince himself of this.
He should say something he knows that but he doesn’t know what. So instead he just leaves. Still hearing his mother crying and father screaming as he moves further away from the party. The car was still here and he got in the backseat.
“She looked happy with out him. Like she had her life figured out when he wasn’t interfering with her. She looked normal while I feel crazy and question every step I take.” He says as an after thought.
David took a spoonful of ice cream before speaking. “My assistant didn’t send away my contracts that was supposed to go away last week, then I had a client that didn’t show up to an appointment and then my boss yelled at me for not completing the rapports from two weeks ago even though I did and the idiot had misplaced them but of course it was easier to yell at me.” He complains and Tony listens to him and nods and agrees in a humming tone at the appropriate places.
“Go get him tiger!” Steve fakes a smile as Tony moves over to the older man hoping and praying that he is married or straight or just not interested in Tony! But who was he kidding? The brunette was perfect! He finishes his drink and decides to leave he really didn’t have to watch this! He was not a masochist!
Kudos and Comments make me happy.
It was late when Tony came home. There was a note on the counter that the dinner was in the fridge. He sighs and heats his dinner and basically inhales it, he hadn’t had anything since breakfast. Then he moves to their bedroom assuming that Steve had gone to bed already but when he opens the door the bed is still made from this morning and Pixie sleeping at the foot of it. He walks in and scratches her behind her ears before changing out of his suit and into a t-shirt and sweatpants. Then the search began for his husband.
“He truly sounds like one of a kind Tony.” He takes a deep breath before he says the next part knowing how it will sound. “Just be careful alright? You only met him three weeks ago and I don’t want you to get hurt.” He says softly. Tony had a tendency to rush into relationships, giving too much of himself and later they would crash and burn and he was alone to pick up the pieces.
Then something seemed to click in David’s head and he looks worried and concerned. “Oh my god Tony! I am so sorry! I just got carried away and… you were so good and I am so sorry!” He panics and Tony just smiles and shakes his head telling him that it is okay.
“I am not cheating! You just suck Bucky!” Steve promises as he chuckles and press pause on the game letting the theme music play in the background that would soon become annoying.
“Of course tell me when and where.” Tony assures him.
Steve just look at him. “You.”
But one night after dinner when Adam was at dance practice and Joanna doing her homework he got Steve alone in the kitchen.
“Having a panic attack,” Sam says, “Steve?”
“Steve, I know, I know you would never do that. This isn’t me saying you would, this is me getting sick of you two dancing around each other. Also, the other thing,  you know… the press conference thing, I asked Barnes if he wanted in, didn't get an answer because he ‘young manned’ me but I also didn't get shot down so,” Tony shrugs, “we need to talk about that, and it’d be best if you were there, you know?”
“Hey, Tones,” Rhodey smiles, as he walks into Tony’s workshop. “There’s something you need to hear, something you need to see, buddy. But, they want to make sure you’re in the right place to see and hear this. So they sent me.” Rhodey lays a hand on his shoulder, not even commenting about the shattered cup and computer on the floor; that’s how Tony knows it’s serious.
“Mr Barnes’ condition has not changed, he still remains stable, but critical,” JARVIS responds, Steve imagines that there’s some softness to his tone. “Sir has not left his side since he sent you out. Would you like a live feed, Captain?”
“What did the doctor say, Dad?” Peter mumbles, it is the first time Peter has ever called Tony ‘dad’.
Their legs are tangled in one big heap, flush together, skin on skin. Tony rubs his toe in circles against a calf, enjoying the feeling of down hair; though he wasn't sure who the leg belongs to. Bucky, who is usually stoic and almost grumpy when awake, seems vulnerable in sleep; his brows are relaxed, and his jaw has lost a lot of its usual tightness. Tony can see that he has some of the longest eyelashes he’s ever seen.
“First of all, everyone who went in after you chose to be there, all of us knew and accepted that risk. We are your family, and we look after our own, we care about you, Petey,” Steve makes sure that Peter understands, he can’t bear the thought of someone so young carrying so much guilt. “You’re too young to feel this kinda guilt, Peter, Bucky knew the risk he took. No one died. We train for hours every day to make ourselves harder to kill, even if someone died on that mission, it still wouldn't be your fault. It would be the person who killed them’s fault.” Steve places a hand on Peter’s shoulder. “Do you hear me, Peter?”
Warnings for this chapter: mentions of broken bones, ptsd, and panic attacks.
The only light in the room is Steve’s small bedside lamp; it gives out a soft orangey glow; Steve can’t take his eyes off Tony, his tan skin and soft brown eyes, he perfect hair and the blue glow of the arc reactor. Steve doesn't think that he’ll ever see anything more beautiful than the man in front of him. Tony steps into Steve’s space, he places his one of his hands on the back of Steve’s neck and trails the other down Steve’s face, leaving burning skin in its wake. Tony smirks when he hears Steve’s breathing hitch, but there’s no venom or negative emotion behind the smirk, Tony looks very much like the cat that got the cream. Steve isn't quite sure what to do with himself, he’s forgotten how to speak since they went into his room, all he does is draw Tony close to him. His hands finally work out what to do, and he cups Tony’s face.
“This one,” she traces the star with her fingertip, her body is tense, like a coiled spring; her brow furrows as she rubs the nape of her neck, “yes. This is the mark of the Winter Soldier. I can guess who’s this is,” she whispers as she traces the spider, the spider with the star on it’s back.
“Mister Barnes and Master Parker left approximately five hours ago, they have not returned,” JARVIS answers Steve’s first question, and the next one he was going to ask.
“That’s today? What time?” Tony wants nothing more than to press his head further into the pillow and snuggled closer into Bucky’s chest, but he knows that Pepper has put a lot of work into this, she’s been making phone calls all week.
“Yes, Captain?” JARVIS replies Steve would like to think that there was a slight hint of humour behind JARVIS’s voice.
Four hours later and Steve is banging his head against Tony’s shoulder as Tony tries to explain the selfie Olympics, Bucky watches as he sends Tony more videos of cute dogs. They’ve shifted from their original position, once for a bathroom break and once for popcorn; Steve’s now cradled in the V of Tony’s legs while Bucky has his head in Steve’s lap. The screens JARVIS has in front of them are great, they can show several different sites all at once, Bucky is currently watching a video made up of many different videos of cats falling off things. Steve’s phone is still going crazy with people retweeting his first tweet.
“‘M not sure I can handle so much talkin’,” Bucky mumbles, though the vodka has no effect on him he’s starting to feel sleepy like time has slowed and he’s already dreaming.
“Send a tweet from the official account stating that we might give a press conference in the New Year, if we feel like it. And say that we don’t want loads of people camping outside, campers will be dealt with in the usual way.” Tony smiles, “I’ll give them hot chocolate and ask them nicely to leave.”
“Hey, Barnes, do you wanna go make yourself useful and get us some cocoa, or something?” Tony mumbles burying his face in the cushion next to him.
“Bucky,” Steve chokes out, they’ve stopped moving; Steve desperately wants Bucky to look at him, but he won’t, his long hair obscures the side of his face closest to Steve. “Buck-“
“That’s what I’m afraid of,” Tony whispers, as he turns to Clint, his brown eyes belie everything that Clint has ever thought he knew about Tony Stark. “I can’t fix this one. Not this time. There’s no trace of them; JARVIS can’t see them, he’s scanned the entire globe and nothing. I programmed a whole new algorithm, which probably should earn me another PhD by the way, and still nothing. I re-wrote part of the International Space Station’s code; hacked into NASA, which was easy just so you know it only took me an hour and a half, and. Still. Got. Nothing. Captain Fucking America ran around New York City, talked to the world’s best spy organisation, and the World Security Council, and nothing. I have nothing left to try, nowhere left to look, and no one left to turn to. Even with all my fancy toys, and my money, and contacts, there is nothing left for me to do. Do you know how that feels? I fix things, Clint, it’s what I do; what do I do now that I have been rendered completely useless? Because I can’t fix this.” The last words are gasped from a throat that is closing up; Tony has to stop talking as tears start to well up. He runs a hand through his unkempt hair, sighing shakily as he squares his shoulders.
“Peter!” Bucky calls out, looking around the penthouse, “Peter! Where’re you kid, your dad said we can for ice cream and a flick!”
“It would never be quite warm enough, ‘specially when the weather got worse,” Bucky nods as he walks out the room.
“Sure, he sounds pretty cool,” Bucky smiles, “I’ll have to see what Doc Banner says about me going outside the tower, but as soon as I can I’d like to meet ‘im.”
“Yeah,” Clint nods, “this is not something you can hide, Pete,” Clint says as Peter looks to him, he’s tense and obviously scared. “Just do it, he’s going to find out eventually, plus it’s kinda cool what you can do.”
Upload schedule? I don't know her?
“I guess, I just didn't like the idea of him being in the hospital because I got kidnapped and he had to come after me. What if one of you guys had died? It would be all my fault and wouldn't have been able to stop it happening.” Peter’s lip wobbles dangerously, Steve wonders if Peter is okay, he looks the kid right in his eyes before he speaks. He doesn't want to slip into Captain America mode, so he tries to respond as Steve Rogers.
They’re deathly silent, Tony and Steve, as they take out every Hydra agent in the room; it’s almost methodical the way they work together to deal out blows. It must only take them five minutes to take down fifteen or so men, because, Clint and Natasha have only just started to patch up Ben’s wounds. Ben is breathing, Tony is relieved to see, but only just; the breaths are shallow and short, they seem to be painful too.
“Tomato sauce doesn't count as a vegetable, Clint,” Tony shakes his head, “seriously this isn't a frat house. And can you stop fletching your arrows on the breakfast bar, you’ve left little tiny scraps of shit everywhere.”
“I can’t replace, May and Ben though, they will always have been better-“ Tony stops when Steve turns him around, manhandling him so that his back is to Bucky. Tony shuffles backwards into Bucky’s chest; he silently curls an arm around Tony’s shoulders.
Honestly, Steve forgets if Tony is the child and Peter the adult. He chuckles, but then he’s presented with a small, square box. He looks up. Tony is kneeling in front of him. On one knee. Bucky is grinning, he’s fiddling with something in his pocket. Steve’s throat knits itself shut. Tony is taking a deep breath. The others are smiling as they gather around them.
“Tony,” Bucky says, prodding him lightly on the shoulder. “Tony, you need to go back to bed, you’re gonna get a crick in your neck, man.” But Tony has fallen asleep, he huffs and leans further back into Bucky. “Fine,” Bucky sighs, leaning over the sofa to prod Steve. “Hey, Stevie, we need to go to bed,” Steve seems to be asleep too, Bucky knows that he’s not been getting the best nights sleep for the last few months. It had started in September when the weather turned cold, now the weather is warmer, he had hoped that it would be easier for Steve to sleep properly, but he knows that Steve just hasn't fallen into a good sleep pattern yet. He’s half tempted to leave them like they are, give something for Clint to laugh at in the morning, but a slight wave guilt rises through him. “Fine,” he says again, shrugging his shoulders, “I’m a super soldier, how heavy can you lumps be?” He wriggles out from Tony, lying him gently on the sofa, before pulling Steve into his arms.
“I’ll be there,” Bucky mumbled into Tony’s hair. “I gotta shower though, I smell like sex.”
don't forget to leave kudos and comment, thank you very much guys; this is amazing im yelling.
“They found them,” he whispers into Steve’s chest. “They found them, Stevie.”
“Uh, yeah, thanks Tony, think I ate something a little funky is all,” He relaxes back into the chair, letting Tony get at the part where the arm becomes his shoulder. “And now is fine, might as well, the alarm hasn’t gone off today. How long will I be out of action for?”
“So, this has happened,” Bucky smiles as he comes into the room, sitting across from Tony. “Honestly I think I should get twitter, I wanna see what people are saying.” He looks at the screen JARVIS has just popped up in front of him, all the well wishes that are coming through Tony’s personal account. “Hey look, this World War Two vet has just come out to his family, ninety-five years old and he’s just come out.” Bucky shoots the tweet, from the vet’s son, over to Tony. “Tony, will you help me set up a twitter?”
“Have you had anything to eat, since last night?” He finds himself saying, “because Steve made extra bacon and you know, I don’t know if you like bacon but we have lots of other food if you want. You don’t have to, but if you’re going to be here for a while, then you might as well have food.” He smiles weakly putting the folder carefully on the coffee table. “Can’t go looking for your Aunt and Uncle on an empty stomach.” He shrugs when Peter looks at him with wide eyes.
Your kudos, and comments mean the world thank you all so so so so much, honestly I had no idea this would do so well, thank you.
“Lucky we got you, huh?” Bucky smiles, passing Tony the wrench before he even asks for it, “are you going to have to replace much of it? Only I’ve been thinking of a different color scheme for it.”
“Why? I wanna know,” Peter shifted so that he could look Tony in the eye, “I don't wanna leave you guys in the dark if I can do something about it.”
Steve pads through the living room, spotting the presents under the tree. He’s been prodding at his for the last few weeks but he’s not been able to tell exactly what they are. Natasha’s present to him is probably the most intriguing. It’s a long black box. It has a red ribbon tied around it. But apart from that Steve has no idea.
“Take a breath before you pass out, kid,” Tony grumbles, his voice low and soothing, “we should take this somewhere a little more private, huh, we don’t want everyone here knowing all your business, do we?” He gives Peter a little smile and moves to steer him towards the offices, stopping before he starts to walk. “I have a room here still which we can use to talk some things out, okay?” Tony asks, looking at Peter, waiting for the boy to answer.
>>@sgtjbarnesofficial
Tony leans into the kiss, giving himself to Steve, letting him know that there are no ill feelings between them, hoping that his love translates across. Steve’s other hand comes to rest on his waist, stroking a patch of skin that’s become visible between the hem of his tank top and the band of his jeans. Heat scores every tiny piece of skin that Steve touches. Tony is addicted to this; to the way, Steve kisses him like he is the most precious thing alive. He loves how Steve holds him, how Steve manages to be innocent as well as pure lust at the same time. Thoughts surge through his head constantly, they swirl in his brain; Tony never switches off, not entirely, not unless Steve’s mouth in on his. Steve’s kisses stop Tony’s brain, they make his heart skip a beat.
“Could you get Tony to come here, please?” He smiles a little, not even daring to shift so that his shoulders stopped their constant aching.
@tonystark I’m coming!<<
“Steve, tell me you’ve found Ben alive and well,” Tony pleads over the coms. “May is down; I repeat May is down. There’s nothing I can do.”
“JARVIS, what happened at the press conference?” He asks.
“No,” this time Tony raises his voice, “I fought for so long for him to have a normal fucking life, I did everything I could to keep him from things like this. And I only got a year, that’s not fair, they got longer with him than I did. So if he doesn't remember that, then all’s the better, I will tell him what happened, but I don’t want him to remember it. When he’s been told he can decide for himself. I cannot make that call for him; I won’t make that call for him. But right now, I want to hug my son and kiss Bucky Barnes so damn hard that if you don’t let me go and see them right now, Rhodey, I will suit up and blast past you anyway.”
“Is it possible to love two people, in a, uh, romantic way, at once? Is that, okay? In this century?” Steve asks, he’s slightly worried as to what he’s going to hear from the AI, but he needs to know. “I mean, I know I love them both but, will people-“
“How often does this happen, JARVIS?” Bucky asks, he doesn't dare move Stark just yet, keeping the other man close to his chest.
“That’s right,” he says, collecting himself before he launches into a massive explanation of the intricacies that went into Bucky’s arm. “That is also a conversation for the morning; I think we should let Bucky and Steve get back to bed, yeah?”
>>@steverogers
“Nothing, kid. I’m takin’ you for ice cream and that new Jurassic Island flick, your Dad said we could,” Bucky watches as Peter’s face lights up, “then Clint is gonna watch you tonight, I think he wants pizza or burritos or something, while Tony, Steve, and I go get burgers and talk about boring shit.”
“Mr Stark,” the words are followed by a moan of pain, Tony can barely hear them, but he goes over to Ben as quickly as possible. He snaps the faceplate off so that Ben can see him properly. There’s blood pooling on his shirt, on his chest, Tony presses on the wound applying pressure. “Mr Stark,” Ben gasps, he’s smiling slightly though. “You and I both know there ain’t no coming back from this.”
“You know,” he says quietly, words barely above a whisper, “I never cried over my parents before. When it happened, I think I was too in shock to do much, you know? Then I figured I was better off without them, well, without Dad anyway; so I just kind of dealt with it, I signed off the company to Obadiah and moved on. I just, didn't think about it, and then I was too busy with SI, and the Avengers, and you know the world ending. This is the first time I’ve properly thought about it,” Tony’s voice is soft and full of barely disguised pain. “My Dad, he’d have given Peter a drink and told him to get over it. He was an asshole, but he was still my Dad. I think a part of him loved me in some twisted way.”
T H E  T A L K  I S  H E R E
“Ready to break the internet?” Tony grins up at Bucky and Steve, the others have slowly filtered out the room, most of them heading to the bar. It’s a private moment. Well, as private as it can be with so many people around. “Peter! Have you posted to instagram yet?”
“I remember,” he says, nodding even though Bucky can’t see him; he rounds the corner, only a few seconds away from his friend.
(picture attached)<<
“JARVIS,” he says his voice cracking, “scan for vitals.” He knows deep inside somewhere that even if they find a pulse the chances are May won’t wake. Everything in that moment seems hopeless because if the people here killed May, her husband probably went the same way. He curses again because he’s going to have to be a dad, something he is very much not ready for. All the confidence he was feeling that morning seems to have fled from him.
Steve can't hear the rest of that sentence because he’s being flown higher and higher into the air, Tony doesn't set them down until they get back to the tower. He’s deposited on the balcony of Stark Tower, as Tony’s bots pull the suit off him. There’s something in his face, Steve notices, a glint in his eye that isn't post-battle relief; it looks like anger. Tony’s dark hair is soaked with sweat, there’s a small cut on his cheek, and another on his arm. Steve knows he probably looks worse; Tony has the suit to protect him from most of the damage; there’s acid dripping down Steve’s thigh that has already worked its way through his suit. He can feel it burning, but he doesn't move from under Tony’s gaze.
“Night terrors? From New York, right, the portal?” Bucky’s moving quickly towards the living room; he doesn't even think about it before he’s running silently down the hallway.
“The murder of a high profile Ten Rings member. No trace of the murderer. The room locked from the inside.” JARVIS answers as Tony turns to Clint.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh, Bucky, котенок,” Natasha sighs, if she weren't ever so slightly terrifying all the time, Bucky would have spilt his guts to her earlier, “котенок, if you could see the way he looks at you like you hung the stars and Tony hung the moon. He loves you, котенок, he just doesn’t know it yet.”
“Well,” Steve turns Tony’s face around to look at him, “there are two ex-assassins, both of them ex-spies, one archer, one guy with mechanical wings, one of the world’s best scientists, a god, a girl who is unlike any I’ve ever met before, not to mention a guy who can talk to ants sometimes drops in. Also, there’s me, nearly ninety-five years old World War Two hero; then there’s you, Tony Stark. What was is? Billionaire, playboy, philanthropist? I don’t think those are the only things about you. Yeah, we’re a weird family, but you can bet that Peter is going to grow up knowing he’s loved.”
“Thank you, James,” JARVIS’s voice echoes through the room, even though he’s speaking softly. “Sir’s heart rate and breathing are both back within normal parameters. His brain function is calming significantly.”
“Sir,” JARVIS says, “Ms. Potts is on the line, it is about your press conference today. She is quite insistent.”
“Aunt May said I should go over to my friend Ned’s house last night, just while she and Ben sorted things out,” Peter takes a deep breath, he looks so small sitting on Tony’s couch. He just wants to go over to the kid and make him feel safe. Tony nods shifting a little closer to the boy. “So I did what she said, but I remembered I’d left my school stuff at home because I packed so quick last night. When I got there, the house was empty and I couldn't find Aunt May or Uncle Ben anywhere. I didn't know what to do so I figured I needed to grab the folder and come here.”
rude >:( @tonystark<<
“Try nationwide. We don’t know how long its been since they were last seen in the local area,” Tony says, smiling as he watches Peter try and work out where the voice is coming from.
He speaks to Steph, the veteran who works for the newspaper; it’s an online thing, but they also have a youtube channel, so that his interview can be filmed as well as written down. Bucky’s excited about that, maybe he can find his feet here, fighting for things he believes in without the violence that he’s accustomed to. Tony’s happy too, he watching Bucky talk through the details with Steph; his feet are propped up in Bucky’s lap as he lazily fiddles with some Stark Industries design. This feels far more intimate than anything they’ve done in the bedroom, its a feeling of being closer than they’ve ever been; no matter the sex or lust, Bucky knows that this is what he wants. He can see himself growing old with Tony and Steve.
“SHIELD is saying that you can’t go to school?” Steve hadn’t known that things were so serious with Peter, he feels a wave guilt rush over him as he thinks about Tony working for days in the workshop, feeling like he had to fix his son while Steve hadn't been there to help him.
“Rhodey,” Tony looks up, sitting down in the long-abandoned chair by that sat by his desk. “What’s going on? You guys have been silent for days now; I was beginning to think-“
“Move up, Widow, and remember during missions its codenames only,” Steve directs, “do you agree, Iron Man?”
>>@BarakObama
He does as Bucky says, moving forward and into the secret room on the other side of the panel. Bucky is slumped up against a wall, his hands pressing down onto his stomach; there’s a wound on his leg too. Steve can a small puddle of blood creeping out and away from him, an agent with some sort of gun is lying a few feet from Bucky, apparently dead. Bucky is pale, too pale, but he smiles up at Steve anyway.
“Yeah, yeah, sure Cap,” Tony nods, not taking his eyes off his son, “just lemme get some more coffee, not sure when I emptied this mug but there’s nothing in it and that should be against the law.” He pours himself another cup, lifting the pot in Steve’s direction; Steve smiles a little and shakes his head.
I know, I know I said that the chapters would be bi-weekly but I am terrible and wrote this anyways so here you go. Some warning for this it includes some character death, and violence, and a little bit of gore. It's necessary though, enjoy!
“You aren't dangerous Peter,” Steve wants to punch Nick Fury, he wants to hurt him so hard, he hasn't felt anger like this in a long time. “Fury shouldn't have said those things. There’s nothing wrong with being strong, and there is nothing wrong with you. You are not a monster, and you are not dangerous. I’m sure your dad said that too. You just need to learn to control your powers, that might take some time, but it does not make you anything like dangerous. You are a good boy, Pete, you are kind and generous, smart and big-hearted. None of those things describes a monster. You are a good person who had a bad thing happen to them.”
“You built hand and footholds into your suit?” Steve asks, his eyes going a little wide as he finds the holds.
“Not in the time that I’ve known him, is it broken now?” Tony looks at the screen, he doesn’t know all that much about medicine, but he knows enough to see that Peter’s ankle has been broken and set wrong.
“With all due respect, Sir,” JARVIS sounds serious, “I do not think that would be in your best interest, not until your energy levels are within more normal parameters.” Tony considers this before he passes out on the roof.
“Peter,” Bucky is entirely out of his depth, he has no idea how to explain things to a thirteen-year-old.
“Yeah, kid. Couldn’t have you living in the old room if you’re going to be here forever,” Tony finds his arms full of a sobbing thirteen-year-old boy. “You alright, Pete? You need some time? Actually, it’s nearly midnight; you should be getting to bed, are you tired?” Peter shakes his head, but he’s yawning, Tony smiles. “If you go to bed now, you can have chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast tomorrow.” That sentence gets the desired reaction; Tony shoos the team out of the room as Peter scrambles for his pyjamas.
“Um, it’ll need to be calibrated, so it’s the right weight, and I’ll have to check up on the joint every now and then, but it’s ready to go right now if you wanted to try it out.” Tony smiles, he catches Steve’s eye in the background.
“Yeah, I had JARVIS look it up, it’s not even far from here; I don’t know if you Brooklyn boys would have actually gone there, and it’s had a name change since but hey, it’s supposed to be good.” Tony wraps an arm around Steve’s waist, looking up at him with his big, beautiful brown eyes; Steve is so caught up in them that the whole world seems to halt for a second. “I heard they do the best chicken quesadilla in Manhattan-“
He can see in through the tiny window in the door; this room was made for housing people who they wanted to keep an eye on. Mostly in case someone was severely injured and had to be kept under observation. Bucky looks almost the same as he did, his hair is longer and in worse condition than it had been. Peter had changed so much, so much that Tony didn't want to think about it. He pushed the thought to the back of his mind and opens the door.
“‘Kay,” Peter nods and follows Tony’s lead, he really is a small kid; he’s only about 4’6. Tony could lift him with ease, which he knows isn't normal. Peter moves almost silently too like he’s some cat or spider.
“You alright, Bucky?” Tony asks, tilting his head even as he picks up the wrench and starts working on Bucky’s arm again. His fingers are moving slowly up the arm, “you know I’m going to have to take this off completely if you want the respray done? Do you wanna do that now or later?”
“Nope!” Tony pops the ‘p’; he makes Peter walk in front of him, his hands covering Peter’s eyes. “You alright like that, Pete?” Peter nods and grins, Steve can see him starting to vibrate almost from the excitement. “Okay, come on then.”
Clint resists the urge to bang his head against the desk, he wants a pint of Ben and Jerry’s, a nap, some pizza, and his dog; they don’t even have to come in that order. Mostly he just wants to find his friend and the kid who is definitely family he just hasn't worked out how yet. He is also, very, very tired; he’s barely had a break in the past few days and his body is so close to shutting down. He is completely unaware that Natasha is passing him a five-hour energy until she's pressed it to his palm.
Tony stands behind the glass wall the separates the CT scanner and the computer room; he can see Peter lying in the huge metal tube, Peter looks perfectly relaxed, but his heart rate is elevated, and his breathing is slightly too quick for Tony’s tastes. He wants nothing more to grab Peter and take him back to the tower, to keep him there and not let him leave for anything. He knows that he can’t do that, he knows that Peter needs to see the doctors, that they need to check nothing else is wrong. Tony would rather be anywhere in the world at that moment, his body aches in at least six different places; he’s pretty sure a cut he has on his thigh needs stitches, but he will not let anyone touch him until he knows for sure that Peter is safe.
“I wasn’t jealous of you, dumbass,” Bucky’s voice is barely a whisper now, “probably unfair of me to do this right now but, I’m dyin’ so cut me some slack. I had to tell you that I-”
“There’s a newspaper stand about half a block that way,” Peter says, peering around the street, people have stopped in their tracks and are looking at them intently. Some of them are staring at them in fear; others just weary. When Peter starts moving though, they continue about their way with the usual apathy of New Yorkers. “Bucky, Bucky what do we do?” Peter asks as they stare in horror at the date at the top of the newspaper.
Tony runs out of the court, colliding with Steve, as he sprints; he grabs Steve’s wrist and pulls him through the building. They run out into the back car park and dive into Tony’s car. Tony sits behind the steering wheel for a full ten seconds, before he bursts into incredulous laughter. He officially has a son, a child who is his to nurture, to guide for as long as he needs. Steve watches him as he laughs, Tony looks at him. The sun streams into the carpark, gold rays catching Steve’s hair, shining into his eyes, turning them to the colour of tropical seas. Tension fills the car for a minute building in the small space like a summer storm. Tony cannot bring himself to look away. He’s always been a sucker for beautiful things. Steve is a beautiful man. There’s no denying the high cheekbones, well-sculpted jawline, leading into a long neck and broad shoulders; Tony knows that Steve is beautiful. He is no stranger to the spark of desire that’s pooling somewhere deep in his gut; he’s also no stranger to the destruction and eventual misery that spark can lead to. Without thinking they have drawn closer to each other, he can feel Steve’s breath on his face.
“Language,” Steve says as he finds his arms full of a thirteen-year-old boy. “Hey, it’s alright, I got you. Are you hurt?” Steve relaxes as soon as Peter shakes his head, “we’ll talk about the ceiling thing later, okay?” Peter nods. “Right. How do I get out of this, then?” He gestures to the webbing (?) around his feet.
“Yes, JARVIS?” He looks up to the ceiling, as though that was the AI was hiding.
If you’re reading this, then something has happened to May and Ben and this folder has ended being passed to you by their will. Inside is all the evidence that Peter, who I hope is old enough to deal with this all, is your son. There is a DNA test that Ms Potts helped me to conduct, and a timeline with provenance associated. You are also welcome to add your name to his birth certificate if you want to.
“Bucky,” Steve interrupts, “hold on, I’m at your position, but I can’t see you.” He looks around, but the room looks empty apart from the bodies of the guys Bucky had been taking down.
“Approaching New York at a speed of 2,500 km/h, Sir,” the AI says, “all relevant authorities have been informed of your arrival; Ms Potts has Mr Parker in the rnd lab on the twentieth floor.”
“What’s not a date?” Peter walks into the kitchen from the other direction, through the door that leads down to Bruce’s lab. The kid is covered in marker, different equations, and such pepper his skin, he’s got some sort of dirt on the side of his face, but his eyes are bright and excited in a way they haven’t been since he got taken by AIM.
“Now is a very good time to tell me that,” Tony laughs, stealing another kiss; Steve mentally amends his earlier thoughts. This is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen, Tony’s lips are red, his hair is mussed from where Steve’s hands have ended up in it, and there’s a slight flush spreading across his cheeks.
Steve can hear Tony’s breath catch; he can feel Tony’s hands grip his biceps a little tighter, he knows when Tony smiles and nods, then Tony is back to kissing Steve’s neck. Kissing Bucky is like coming home, a breath of fresh air at the end of the day; it is less weird than Steve worried it would be. He feels like they should have been doing a long time ago, but somehow he knows that it was right for Tony to be the one that gave them the push to do this. Steve also loves how he can feel Tony at his back, stable and warm, and practically vibrating with excitement; Tony’s whispering in his ear, he really hasn't stopped since they got home. Tony is everywhere, his hands are running down Steve’s back, through his hair, rubbing along the waistband of his jeans; Steve breathes in, and he can catch a mingled mess of Tony’s cologne and something that just smells like Bucky.
“Huh, JARVIS, give me a keyboard, I need to reply to a few of these,” he taps out replies to the tweets, ignoring the ones that spew hatred. He wishes those he’s inspired to come out the best of luck while informing them that if things don’t go well, the safe houses are ready to go; they only have to text JARVIS to get the address.
“We could,” Bucky says, he says them like they’re a secret, passed only between the three of them; his tone is quiet and soft, almost cautious. Tony finds that he likes the tone, it sends something through him, straight to his core.
“I’m not gonna lie, Pete, that’s going to take some time. We’ll try and get you back for the next school year in the fall but, definitely not for the rest of this year. Maybe we can sit and talk about it in the spring. We can get you a tutor to cover the stuff you’ve missed and then if they think you’re where you should be, we can see about getting you back to school, how does that sound?” Tony tries to quell his anxiety over sending Peter back to school; he was going to have to sort out more therapy sessions for himself over the next few weeks. “Right now though, if you’re ready we can get you set up in your old room. There are a few people who wanna say hello to you, how do you feel about that?”
“It’s okay,” Tony nods, he moves closer to Steve, leaning towards him. “It’s okay. I get it. You and Bucky, you went through so much together, it’d be weird if you didn’t have feelings for him. And hey, maybe this whole sharing thing could be fun, but we need to talk about it, and you know I don’t do feelings talks without burgers.”
“Yeah, you’re right. Mission first,” Steve nods, he knows that this is Tony trying to distract him from Bucky, but he’s grateful for it. He moves to stand, but not before he presses a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “I’ll get your son; you save my friend.”
“Oh, I know you love me, J but I am starting to hear colour, and that means I need a coffee,” Tony smiles, “Dum-e if you do not put down that coffee pot I will donate you to community college, don’t even try it.” Tony takes the pot from the errant bot and sets it down on the counter. “Its like herding cats around here, J, start the machine in the common room. Also what time is it?”
“Is he there with you? Tony, what the hell is going on?” Pepper sounds a little flustered now like she’s stumbled upon something she really would rather not have. “Please, just both of you get down here, and make sure you look presentable, you don’t have time for hair and make-up now. Presentable means suits; not a pair of jeans without oil stains and rips, Tony.”
“You’re not going to mess things up, and, he’s not straight.” Bucky shrugs, he sees Steve’s raised eyebrow and grins. “No straight man would look at your ass like that.” He says, enjoying the blush that paints itself across Steve’s cheeks and down his neck, disappearing below the collar of his t-shirt. “Come on, the kid’ll be gettin’ impatient, and the others will be wondering where we’ve disappeared to.”

“I know!” Tony half shouts, he looks panicked like someone just poured ice water down his neck, “I know, honestly I’ve been winging it since the kid came in. There’s a paternity certificate in there; he’s really mine, and I never knew, all the time he’s been out there and there’s so much I’ve missed. Now, though, I’m here and I’m going to make it right, you know Cap. This information that I’m his dad is out there, it's in some database somewhere anyway and it would only be a matter of time until someone nasty found out. Isn’t he safest here, with you, Clint, Bucky, Tash, Bruce, and Sam, anyway? Wouldn't you guys keep him safe?” Tony’s babbling, which he only does when he’s scared out of his mind.
