Silence settled and for a moment John didn’t know what to say or think, he hardly breathed for a long moment. He looked to Sherlock and he looked exactly the same as he did when he came in, except for the hope that he might get him back had brought color into the dim hospital room. Into the hallows of Sherlocks cheeks and for a moment he didn’t feel the presence of the ghost of him any longer.
“That’s ridiculous.” Greg replied outraged that Sherlock would even think it.
In a fictional world perhaps.
"To your aunts, I thought that was fairly obvious." Sherlock says slipping into a cab and motioning John to join him. John mutters to himself, annoyed, as he closes the door and gets into the cab.
Sherlock stays holding John close to his chest as one of the nurses injects him with a sedative. Sherlock holds him until his cries turn to whimpers and eventually the sedative takes over and he’s asleep in his arms, that’s when he’s asked to leave.
“Well it’s the best we have right now so deal with it.” Sherlock says standing up straight then taking off his shirt and switching it out for a clean one not bothering with his pants.
“I’m not, one moment.” Sherlock said and stood going into his bedroom and returning a moment later with a small box that he placed in Johns palm. “There’s your heirloom.”
"No, it was everything." Lestrade says with a small smile. Sherlock was extremely happy to have brought them back together, though he didn't show it much he was sure Lestrade could tell.
"I never said that Lestrade, keep an open mind. I have theories five or six actually but I need to see the scenes and the file."
“She wasn’t right for you.” Sherlock muttered looking to the ground as he sat on John’s bed.
"He'll be okay, he just needs time." Greg said quietly as they walked the short distance to the crime scene.
“It’s John.”
“Well no, but-”
“A grandfather clock? Who would ever need a grandfather clock.” Sherlock scowled before disappearing once again. “It didn’t fit in the flat and we already have a clock anyway.”
The storm lasted all night but by the time the sun was up it had cleared. The power hadn't returned and classes were thankfully cancelled. News travels fast in their building and apparently lightning struck one of the power line poles and took down half the blocks power line poles as well. Everything had to be replaced and the work could take somewhere from two to four days. Or if you were Anderson three years.
They thought they were safe but after all the universe loved to prove them wrong. In every way possible.
“Oh, Mr Holmes, back again are we?” She asked and he made his move to stand when she pushed him down by his shoulder and moved to the other side of the bed. “Your fine, I spoke to Martha, it seems your authorized.”
"Sherlock, just listen to my voice, okay? Just follow my breathing. In and out, in and out." John said trying to remain calm while helping Sherlock even though he was freaking out.
"I ignored you. Come on, get up." Sherlock insisted pulling in his arm.
“Yes but I have learned to ignore her you are incapable of that John.” He said going back to his writing as well.
He stared into the eyes of the man he trusted more than anyone, more than himself. He would choose his fate and the gun clicked.
John tried to break them up but he couldn't get a word in edgewise. He sighed exasperatedly and turned down towards the hallway himself, he probably should've just come alone. He started to slowly go down the hallway while the two fought away behind him, if James didn't know they arrived before he did now.
“You kept youw pwomise.” John says smiling brightly up at him even though it seemed tired it was happy nonetheless.
“Wake up.” John repeated softly with a shake of his head and cups the other side of Sherlock's face as well, resting their foreheads together he closes his eyes. “Wake up.”
"What are you doing here?" John asked surprised watching as the man leaned back against his car.
John went to stand up not wanting to give up on finding Sherlock himself and getting to him before something happened. Before it was too late. He’d already failed him, having let him come here and gotten hurt, he wished there was some way to turn back time and fix this.
"Yeah, uh.. We'll pull up the file if you need but they were together five years or so then split around nine years ago. Apparently he tried to strangle her though there weren't any witnesses or anything to prove it. So they got divorced and she instituted a restraining order." Greg relayed the information gruffly, shuffling his feet.
“Do you?”
Past memories fluttered through Johns mind as he stared out the window unsure of what else to do. Anxiety churning in his chest wrapping around his lungs. He forced himself to focus on the contact he had with Sherlock, their hands intertwined between them and on nothing else but that.
“Yes of course now tell me.” She says impatiently practically bouncing in the spot in anticipation.
“I’m sorry.” Sherlock seemed to ignore John coming to stand by his side and helping him the short way to his room, in silence. As they arrived and Sherlock sat John down on the bed, he turned to leave but stopped right at the doorway. He spun around head bowed looking ashamed confusing John once more.
Sherlock was on his laptop at the table in the living room, he was searching through unknown chemicals for the recent case. John was sitting by his side with a plate of food that he picked at and fed Sherlock more than he ate himself.
“I know.” He swallowed a bit thickly before looking towards his father. He never brought up his mother so it was odd now and yet he showed no reaction.
The subject of either of the kisses was never brought up. John understood now why Sherlock wouldn't answer him before, because if someone asked him what the hell he just did he wouldn't know what to tell them.
John was there. His John. The John that held his hand and guided him to bed, the John that called him brilliant and fiercely protected his reputation. The John that created buildings with him and explored his childhood, mapped through his world easily.
“Wait so you’re doing one?” Molly asked sitting up excitedly any notion that she was previously tired out the window.
I am on a really bad schedule of putting up a chapter a disappearing for a month. I’m trying to get out of that. Anyway, I hope everyone is keeping clean and safe. Enjoy!
He would dream alone, in his world, in his last creation. In a place no one could touch but himself. Here he had layers, places where things weren’t so bad as the real world. Here he could move freely and live through what he wanted and what he lost.
‘Greg needs you more than I do, idiot.’
He walked in and she turned immediately from her desk (Where she was reading a magazine on how to lose weight without working out. Completely wrong, all of it.) to see his ridiculous smile. She grinned cheekily and put her arms in the back of her chair watching him slink into the room.
“Just throw something at the guy who can barely stand, nice.” Greg just shrugged.
"Well, this isn't what I wanted to do, it never was. It was the best way to make money at the time to get Dad into the hospital and Harry away from that crazy woman she was going out with." John explains muttering the last bit, lightning sticks outside.
"I take what I can get it's been a slow week." Lestrade said looking between the two of them. John who was silently looking out the window sipping his tea and Sherlock who had opened his laptop and he as typing quickly with a bitter look on his face. "Christ, you two are oblivious." John looked to him questionably and Sherlock snapped, slamming his computer shut again then placing his hands folded on top.
For those reasons and many others he had yet to bring a true thought to, he was driving as quickly as possible to pick Sherlock up and assess the situation. All he knew was that by the time John was a few miles away from Baker Street the CCTV had disabled in that surrounding area as had the tracking device of the car, Sherlock had gotten John's location and was there before anyone else. All he had said was that the car was stopped in the middle of the road and no one was inside.
Sherlock reaches over taking John’s hand in his own and tracing the lines on it idly. John moves over a bit to lean on Sherlock’s shoulder watching Sherlocks hands move on his own.
“He wouldn’t want me to leave you alone.” Mycroft commented although he wasn’t pushing by any means, he didn’t dare. Not now anyway, any other time he definitely would have pulled his hand. Certainly not now though.
“Greg! You know we’ve been friends for a long time you included. I know you know his name!”
"What? When?" John demanded jokingly yet still trying to prove him wrong.
"John, I didn't know you had a boyfriend." She says looking slightly uncomfortable as she shifts on her chair. "So, how did you two meet?"
“I would say I’m surprised but, well, how could I be.” The man drawled as he entered the room, door slamming shut behind him. He pulled over a chair to sit by Sherlock’s bedside the chair screeching on the floor in the silence.
“Could you stop that?” Sherlock asked slightly irritated as he tried to clear his work once again.
"John." He calls wanting to make sure that by some strange turn of events that he couldn't speak. John looks up at him questionably with a bit of attitude it seemed as well, as if Sherlock was bothering him. Going into younger teenage years then, definitely.
Lestrade chuckled amused. “No, I don’t believe you have. Can I get that on tape?”
Sherlock paces in the living room back and forth, back and forth, wearing the carpet thin. He fiddles with his phone idly flipping it between his hands.
Sherlock nodded trying to make out some of the pictures in the dark. “I think they were more than just friends John.” He said taking one of the pictures but the corner and angling it for John to see.
It took a few moments more of driving in anxious silence, alone with his thoughts before Greg arrived at the location. There were other officers arriving about the same time blocking the area off and as such, he managed to get in and spot Sherlock by the ambulance as he parked.
“It wasn’t that bad. It was outdated, that's all.” John tried to reason, wincing as he heard a loud crash and looked behind him to see Sherlock come up from behind the island.
“Othew one is bad too.” John admonishes wrapping his arms around Sherlock neck as he crouched in front of the wardrobe to pull out shoes, not wanting to fall down as he moved,
John shakes his head not wanting to say and have Sherlock panic or something if he realizes he’s hurt. “We need to go, someone is coming.” He says, carefully taking Sherlocks good arm and helping him up.
“A building blew up around you. You’re lucky to still have a head.” Mycroft sighed some and shook his head.
"John." Sherlock waits until John's eyes slide open looking into them deeply. "Who is he?" John has no doubt the question had been on his mind all evening. The detective never waits.
“Sherlock!” He heard her (somewhat) quiet excited squeal as she grabbed and hugged him from behind.
Because when you’re faced with an impossible problem you think of smaller ones, it was an unfortunate human defect that even Sherlock had.
"You're interesting." Sherlock tells him simply and John seems unsatisfied turning back forward with a huff. "I have nothing to fix about you, I was merely going to remove this." He explains tapping Johns forearm lightly.
“Vulnerability.”
“Untested.” He admitted and another breath filled his lungs slowly, the rope scratched at his neck and the box tilted slightly to the left on the uneven ground, he had to force himself not to panic.
"It's nice." John commented distractedly as he ventured around the small flat. It was cluttered and nothing was unpacked though Sherlock had said he'd moved in last year, it was unexpected but also completely expected.
“He’s such an idiot. I don’t care what he says or what reason he comes up with. I’m going to stay angry, I’m done being the girl in this relationship.” Greg huffed out a laugh as they looked through the Sherlock’s room window. Greg still had to hold John up his legs refusing to cooperate with his firm attitude, telling Greg he wasn’t as angry as he let on.
If only he knew all it would take to stop the restless feelings and thoughts  was one realization.
"It was ridiculous and there was no point in buying all that stuff when you had perfectly good clothes just sitting in your closet." John laughed a bit at the ridiculousness of the conversation. Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly and John lost it practically doubling over with laughter because this was absolutely ridiculous.
"Yes, I do as well. Unfortunately not much can be done for it. We can only hope, now."
It was almost like a lake one second it was calm, the waves slowing and it was becoming still someone just had to jump in. Ruining the stillness and creating waves and ripples not allowing it to settle. Creating chaos.
"You have to get ready John. Knowing you, you'll take hours."
A week later people had mostly left John alone. Sherlock won Molly paid up.
“Yep. That’s me.”
“Get your ass over here and find out.” She hung up after that.
When they arrived at Scotland Yard Sherlock pulled up John’s hood and they entered. John sighed happily to himself at the air conditioned building. He was also able to walk beside Sherlock now that he was forced to walk slower inside the building. They made their way into an elevator and up a few floors before arriving at an office.
“Well Sherlock and Molly I’ll see you around campus.”
"Just tell me Molly, it's important."Sherlock almost yells at her.
“I may have just gotten a boyfriend.” Sherlock says failing to hold in a smile at the statement.
That night he didn’t sleep until he could see the sun rays coming in from the small window above his door. Only then with the small comfort that the sun brought, did he fall asleep.
They didn't talk about it for a while. What was the point without words to describe it. Only actions were needed.
They stayed there a long moment well after the area went silent and Greg looked around slowly. It was hard to comprehend what had happened in the moment but devastation was all that could be said for it.
It had been a month now of this, coming back to the flat every Sunday when Mrs Hudson had time to stop by the hospital and watch Sherlock for him. Rationally he knew there was no sense in bothering her with such a thing, he wasn’t going to just get up and leave one day. She never protested, she missed him too and visited him often as she could.
"Our date." John shot up looking at Sherlock in disbelief. It had only been a day well really just a night John had expected Sherlock to take a while to be able to 'figure it out' he said.
“What?” Sherlock asked back, dumbfounded. The thought of going on tour with John was daunting and made Sherlocks heart speed up.
He failed.
Sherlock hummed lightly touching another one of the pictures that also had the sticky substance over it.
"You know we all had our suspicions but after that stunt you pulled at the Landers case I figured-" Lestrade said grinning oddly that just succeeded in pissing Sherlock off more.
“Come on, John. Let’s go.” John heard as someone was shaking him. He identified the voice as the man he had met when he first woke up. He had come back like he said.
“Mmm me too.” John says softly closing his eyes and cuddling close to Sherlock, drifting slowly.
The blood.
“I did. This is certainly nicer than the wine bottle holder that Molly got you. You don’t even drink wine but I know you drink whiskey.”
"That name gives me chills for some reason." John says chuckling slightly as he rubs at his arm.
"Obviously." Sherlock looks to John pointedly with an expression that clearly said get on with it.
"Oh, calm down. She didn't believe a word I said." Sherlock replied waving him off.
Sherlock didn't know how to react, he just stood there opening and closing his mouth like a fish out of water. John eventually sighed and motioned him inside.
"No, we'll just get it fitted. I think this one sums up our relationship pretty well." John smiled- if possible- even brighter as Sherlock did as well and kissed him. "I love you so much."
It became faster turning those slow rips into tears and holes in the fabric. Taking away meaning, thoughts and memories leaving gaping holes of information. It’s maddening yet calming it makes him feel like dying but also like flying.
"Then what is there to fix, do you think?" Sherlock asked looking over at him questionably. He's not surprised he was listening in, he was curious and in a strange environment. Of course he was going to follow the only familiar thing he knew.
If he could find John and maybe touch him that might help to get his attention since he seemed to be the closest to him. The problem was locating his limbs would be an issue, he couldn't seem to feel anything much more than his face so anything more than that would definitely be a challenge.
He was in agony, both mind and body hating every bone in his body that protested against moving. Every muscle that constricted and ached with his movements forcing him to stop every few seconds.
Sherlock pulls the blankets up over himself, shifting closer to the wall where he knew John was laying on the other side. He couldn’t do this alone and John would know how to tell her gently while Sherlock only knew how to be blunt. John was much better with people.
How was he possibly supposed to do this in time?
"Why do you need my blood anyway?" He asks after Sherlock has filled the needle and pulled it from his arm. Sherlock hands him a small circle band aid and he puts it on the stinging spot.
“I made a deal with him. No matter what, I call if Sherlock’s in danger even if that means to himself. He saved my life I owe him that much.” He said it quietly like admitting it was something to he ashamed of. “He can help Sherlock more than we can, he’s gone through this with him once before.”
“Come sit.” He knew he probably shouldn’t, someone would come and he would get yelled at again and forced to leave, but he couldn’t seem to find his voice. So he walked across the small space to his bed and sat by John’s legs that were swaying slightly from side to side.
"All ones I intend to keep I assure you. Just trust me."
“Mistake, John.” Sherlock says standing and moving to sit next to him on the bed. He lauded back against the wall beside his bed looking at John disappointedly
John looked through the wardrobe and found sleeping clothes like Sherlock said but he also found Sherlock's clothes. Vowing to think on it later John closed the doors and changed quickly before flopping on the bed. He lifted the covers and almost as soon as his head hit the pillow he was asleep.
As loud as the voices were there were so many Sherlock couldn't pick it what was being said. He sighed to himself as he leaned against the wall trying to pick out John's voice. He could faintly but he didn't seem to be doing as much yelling as the other people. With another resigned and defeated sigh Sherlock slipped back into his room.
“Is it weird that this isn’t weird?” John asks quietly after a while, he yawned a bit starting to get tired after the events of the day.
That night Sherlock stayed awake thinking of not Johnathan Watson the quickly rising rockstar of the internet. But of John a boy who moved back to London to ‘find someone’. He imagined who John would be off camera and not through a wall but in person face to face, if he would accept Sherlock as the egotistical, sociopath he was. When he did fall asleep he dreamt of a John he could talk with and tease and hug and hold hands and be all domestic with. He dreamt of a John he could kiss which was something he had dreamt of before but now in more depth. His voice no longer disturbed by a screen and microphones but just a wall a very thin wall he was so incredibly thankful for.
“Your Sherlock then?” He was surprised to hear John's voice, let alone his own name and it definitely showed from the answering smile from John. “Mrs Carson told me your name, I hope you don't mind.”
All he could think about was Sherlock and getting back to him trying to find a way out. The only other thing on his mind, polluting his mind was James and his childhood with him.
"Whatever you want to call it. Why?" John mutters then demands ignoring Sherlock's poorly hidden grin.
“I did.” Sherlock grins at the look on John’s face.
There were a lot of things John regretted in their time together and he thought about it all in the time he spent at Sherlocks bedside.
"He's right. You shouldn't be alone, I'll go down first." Greg said not letting either of them go down there and get hurt.
“Pull yourself together before you see him.” Greg’s voice came from down the hall as he walked toward them water bottle in hand. “Thought you might need this.” He threw it to Sherlock who just barely caught it with his hand that wasn’t on the IV stand.
John nodded quietly before leaning forward into Sherlock who wrapped his arms around John’s small frame. John held onto Sherlock tightly needing the comfort for what was to come.
The elevator doors opened traveling the great city in all its glory. London really was a marvelous place at night.
John feels his eyes well up as the man displays such open intimacy, they are clearly some sort of partners of which sort he does not know. What he does know is that even if he does not know him, he feels a connection to this man and does not want to harm him, though he knows anything he does will.
"I will send my team over as soon as possible. And the matter of his..aging?"
He watched closely as the dogtags swung, clinking together on their metal chain and slowly came to a stop over his palm. He placed them back in his pocket with a sigh and sat back in his chair. When he was younger he was naive enough to think he wouldn’t need a totem like others, that his mind was strong enough to tell the difference between reality and the dreams.
"Well yeah but-" Greg tried to protest but quickly got interrupted.
Sherlock realized belatedly he probably should have cleaned the chemicals before cooking with John, he hadn’t much thought of it before but that seemed a bit not good. Damage done, he supposed. There was so much damage done he wasn’t sure he wanted a recount of how much.
“That is what I thought as well, until-“ Sherlock said gravely.
He only stayed a moment or so longer to retrieve a bag for himself with some changes of clothes, a few books and Sherlock's violin. He thought perhaps a familiar item might help to bring him back, he thought the same every week when he brought him something new. Wishful thinking.
"Take a day off, Greg." John said coming to place tea and coffee in front of them both. Lestrade turned to him now.
Sherlock looked behind him as John continued to sob into his dressing gown. He searched outside, categorizing everything to figure out why John was so shellshocked. Looking so intently at small details he did not notice it at first.
-2606 words-
Sherlock slammed his car door shut and ran inside quickly, scanning his student ID card at the door. He ran up the many steps to the fourth floor where their rooms were. He heard what sounded like yelling as he came closer to the rooms and coming to stand in front of John's room.
The sound of thunder on the stormiest day couldn’t compare to the sound of -what must have been- a thousand knives hitting the floor. Defeating anyone who dared to listen to the horrific screech of metal falling all around. Knives scratching the ground varying in size but all falling the same. Three of them hitting Sherlock.
"What do people normally say?" John quickly asked.
"Obviously." He didn't understand why Mycroft was being so trivial about the whole thing and not just doing something about it.
“Dead. He didn’t survive the explosion.”
“You can’t do that, why can’t you just realize what I am?”
"You think I'm not trying to do that?" And so the two started bickering.
“Such a waste, really. On the brink of your career and all too soon the great Sherlock Holmes will be gone. All because of 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦.” Moriarty said the word with such disgust.
I’m back! Fully functional and ready to work. I hope you have enjoyed the story so far and have stuck around through the break I had to take. Finally though I’m back and I hope you enjoy this long overdue chapter.
“I want you to stay.” Jim  insisted adamantly following the blond haired boy to the bedroom.
"Would it be better or worse if we split up!?" John yelled ahead at Sherlock over the rain as he rounded a corner.
“Alright. Well, I told you I took him in. He was with me for a long time almost two years. There wasn’t a place for him anywhere so he got comfortable there, we developed a sort of routine. Uh, around the two year mark I got a call they were going to place him in Ireland, away from everything he’s ever known. I should’ve fought them I should’ve done everything I could, adopted him for goodness sake, anything. That will forever be my greatest mistake.” He took a steadying breath before continuing. “They took him away alone and afraid, I have no doubt he felt betrayed that I let him go. I don’t know how it happened but his uncle got out that morning we never really figured out how. Next thing I know I’m calling everyone I know from the agency trying to figure out where the kid was, no one knew a thing. That’s when someone radioed in the wreck on the M25 half the kids on that car were killed and I thought for sure he was one of them. The feeling of relief sickened me to my core that I was happy to find out he’d survived when so many had not. I tried to forget as I made my way down, too consumed by fear and guilt to pay attention to my radio. When I got there he was missing already a search party out but no one had seen a thing. We searched for hours and came up with nothing until we ventured out of town.”
Sherlock turns in his chair to level John with an ‘are you an idiot’ glare and John shrunk in on himself.
Sherlock leaned back from the door as the lock was undone and it opened. John stood there wearing jeans and T-shirt like he always does with uncharacteristic sorrow written upon his face.
“John? Come on kid..” Greg called as he ventured into the room and as he made it about five steps inside the room before the door closed behind him.
“I love you, you great idiot.” John said fondly as they gasp for air.
"You're not broken why would I fix you?" He replies in a low tone lifting his legs up and placing his arms on his knees. John shrugged again.
"I have time. Just need to get John out then case closed."
"You're absolutely brilliant John." He exclaimed then proved to walk towards the street to hail a cab. "I think it's time we headed home."
"You keep say 'was'. Why? Do you expect to find her dead?"
“You have to suffer with me, you know.” He points out going back to his paper as well.
His room was covered in boxes but he want even looking at that. He was watching John and automatically his mind came up with what he was searching for before Sherlock even registered it. He was holding Johns dogtags on his fingers, swinging in his hand.
"Lestrade if you wish to insult us there are better ways of going about it. Now, if you don't have anything new on the case I suggest you leave." He growled almost like an animal. An overprotective animal. More specificity an overprotective animal over his mate.
He liked John in a way that wasn’t necessarily platonic but liked him nonetheless and wanted him to be happy. So he brought Lestrade to him they clearly needed each other if even just for emotional support that Sherlock couldn’t give. But more for a connection like father and son and that connection needed to be prepared before anything else happened between him and John.
Sherlock had to stop himself from hoping and step away from his computer as it calculated results, taking the rest of the time to thoroughly clean the kitchen up the rest of the way. When he came back to the computer the results still weren't calculated so he picked up around the flat as well and checked his computer again.
"I said yes."
Shit.
"John." Sherlock beckoned him over and the officers around him looked at him like a piece of meat given up to the beast to spare them. In a way he was.
Oh christ it was too early for this.
“Alright, go ahead.” Sherlock answered dropping his hands to rest at his sides.
“Is it actually for us or are you just going to destroy it again.” John asked from his place sitting in his chair taking bites of biscuit and sips of tea.
Sherlock got dressed quickly getting prepared for what may as well be a battle. He smoothed out the wrinkles in his clothes ready to fight for John and he’d have to, he knew it. He steeled himself and goes to his bedside drawer pulling out the gun he kept there for emergencies. -or even just for times of boredom.- He put the SIG in the back waist of his pant line, hiding it within the folds of his jacket.
"Wait Sherlock, doctors have been trying to find a cure for years. You can't just come fix it it's not that easy." John argued. Sherlock didn't blame him he had been stuck here for years without hope of an escape.
“How long has it been since you’ve last seen him?” Sherlock found himself asking. Iwas more than two years he could tell just by the look on his face but needed confirmation and was trying to be nice. Well nicer.
Oh, John. He’d have him back, really back not just some past figure to haunt him of his true absence. John was no longer just his flatmate, he was no longer just his friend, even now he was no longer just his partner, more so he was no longer just his romantic partner. He was all that and so much more, he was his motivation, his drive, his function, purpose. Before John he had very little to work for to drive for, he had found a new spark of life with him and he was eager to have it back. To have him back.
Yes. I have work to get back to but I’ll come back tomorrow. Try not to cause too much of a fuss.”
He didn’t have to. John didn't want to either.
"I'll buy you a real one." He promised wiping more tears from both their faces
Oh, John. How longed for his lover, boyfriend, whatever it was that they were. He never told John anything, not how he’s longed for him or how much he loves him. He never got the chance and he hated himself for not being able to say it back.
They continued that way for sometime taking jabs at each other with words and hands occasionally. Mycroft was just trying to push Sherlock to get better and Sherlock knew that but it was still annoying. When they reached John’s room door Sherlock practically collapsed onto his brother with relief and happiness at being able to see John and finally being able to sit down.
Sherlock opened one eye to watch his expression as he seemed to prepare himself. Lestrade was a man of character, distinct in scenarios yet able to blend in with the rest of the population in other times. He had a commanding presence and wouldn’t take any ‘crap’- as they say -from anyone, he was a man of his own power and will, quickly promoting him Detective Inspector and on his way to Detective Chief Inspector. He is a simple man really, sticking to tradition and opting to marry right out of highschool which came to a tragic end three years later in a divorce he initiated due to her arrey of lovers. He didn’t have any children though he wanted them and anyone who knew him would say he would make an amazing father although he doubted himself and never adopted or tried for another relationship. Or at least he hasn’t to Sherlocks knowledge. He was young, 36, hair only just starting to gray on his sideburns truly in the prime of life yet no attachment except for John of course though he seemed more distanced from him now.His expression when talking about John was saddened as if he believed he had lost him already.
“Yes I am. You can come in Mrs Hudson.” He replied softly still smiling like a mad man. Mrs Hudson let herself in closing the door quietly before walking over and sitting next to him.
“John makes me happy.” He settled for and she smiled knowingly. Must have been the right thing to say then.
When Sherlock opens his eyes again it’s about an hour later the sun just starting to set, orange light filling the room from the window. He must have fallen asleep at some point but looking to John he’s relieved to see he looks the same as before still cuddled up to his chest.
“So how was John today?” Martha asked Terry in the break room late that night. They were some of the only people that came in early and stayed late and were just cleaning up the break room for the night shift before heading out.
"We really" John tried to protest but of course before he can Sherlock jumps up and filers her to the kitchen.
“I will, just give me some time, yeah? I’ll get that file for you.”
The crimson dripped down the walls as a body slid down to the floor.
"How'd you know?"
Something twisted in Sherlocks gut and he shifted, the deep gashes in his back scraping into the floor and he’s once again reminded of the blood loss slowly affecting him. He wasn’t going to last long and the last thing he'd get to see was the maniac standing above him.
“John, get up quick.” Sherlock called suddenly by his side, not a scratch on him as he held John's arms pulling him to stand beside him. His legs deciding now was a good time to actually work.
Hello all, that’s correct I’m not dead. I have returned from the depths of uninspiredness. It’s been a very long time and I do sincerely apologize for that. Now though I believe I can continue this story and I’m so glad to do that, I hope I haven’t lost too many of you on the way.
“And forever.” John replied and smiled right back to him.
Mycroft nods and exits the room swiftly without another word, leaving the two alone once more. Sherlock closes his eyes dropping his head back against the headboard with a sigh. Just two weeks to try and figure this out.
“Furious is a better word but yeah. Sherlock definitely won’t be doing that again, he’ll be too scared to.” Greg said with an amused huff as they started to walk down the hall to the elevator.
"What happened?"
The man seems so peaceful and John suddenly wishes he knew his name. So perhaps he could add meaning to the man that gave him his own name and brought him out from the darkness. He wishes he knew him, clearly he was important to John and soon he would realise John couldn’t remember him and he wouldn't have the same hopeful look in his eyes like last night anymore. He would look sad and disappointed in John.
But where had he hidden them?
"Worse! It wouldn't matter! There are far too many!" Sherlock yelled back, turning back to look at him and almost hitting a trash bin in the process. "Up!"
"I'm always right." Molly said triumphantly then stood to look through John's cabinets
“Are you spying on her? Should I be jealous?” Sherlock asks jokingly grinning as he grabs Johns laptop to type out the final draft of the song to give to his producers.
Sherlock sits back and watches him quietly trying to pretend that this wasn’t his John. That he was watching Mrs Hudson’s nephew and John was just in the other room about to come out and tell him to not give a baby a skull. He smiles at the thought, he’d give anything to have John yell at him.
For a moment there was silence, an awkwardness that wasn’t expected as Mycroft met the eyes of the criminal mastermind. Jim Moriarty and before there was a chance for any words on his end, he smiled a dark mallacing sort of smile. “I’m ready.” He said his wrists coming together in front of him.
“Yes.” Sherlock says simply watching her concerned for a minute. “Are you okay?”
"She loved us both equally of course she did. A good parent wouldn't pick favorites. I remember going out with her and all kinds of stuff, Johnny hardly came out of the house. His head stuck in books all day." She replied sipping obnoxiously from a thermos filled with booze Sherlock could smell.
"Fine. You know the situation now do something." Sherlock replies impatiently turning around and pacing in front of his bed.
Sherlock parked and got out of the car, the power plant was silent- dead silent in a way that was a bit too literal. His mind remarked on the very ‘not good’ bit of his thoughts but he ignored it for now a small pain pulsing around the chest area that he refused to identify. He gingerly stepped around the neat pile of corpses piled at the front gate, they had been there a good few days judging just by the smell.
Sherlock's eyes fluttered open slowly, the feeling of tranquil numbness following him as he woke. How long he had been out he wasn’t sure but he felt so light it didn’t matter. The image of the lush green field and bushy trees still fresh in his mind as he opened his eyes.
John seemed to ponder over Sherlocks expression a moment, sitting back a bit as his smile faltered. “Why’re you sad?”
“First off, to them you are a piece of work to be shown off one with a rather good singing voice. Second, I won’t be going home to my parents. And third-”,
“Come on Sherlock, we have to go.” John urged trying to pull him up again.
“Don’t worry, I don’t plan on it.” John assures with a small smile, fiddling with his fingers idly. “It was a bit wrong of me though, I kinda wanted them to be you..” He admits quietly his light smile turning to a frown.
"Oh.." John says looking at his arm the slow blinking that comes from under his skin. "I'm getting younger.. I
Everything left unsaid,
"John!" Sherlock pounded on John's closed door the next morning. Completely ignoring the sign on the outside that said 'Bugger off Sherlock. You kept me up all night now your going to have to deal with being alone for a while so I can sleep.'
“You both have reason to be ‘that one’ at some point or another. I don’t think it makes you weak if that’s what your thinking.” Greg looked over to him questionably. John was hard to figure out sometimes, he could turn it off then on like Sherlock could. Completely close himself off to do what had to be done. Greg could see it in his eyes, he was done being what he thought to be weak, he was going to fight now for Sherlock. Let him fall apart to put him back together like Sherlock had done for him. Greg didn’t doubt he could do it.
When they could no longer see him they closed the door and fell against it sliding down to sit on the floor.
Oh John, the more he thought about it the more the fire burned inside of him, pushing him to move finster to think quicker. John was well, his everything, he pushed him to do better and would do better and find John and while in some twisted way he admired Moriarty’s genius he’d kill him after today. In a heartbeat.
And eat he did.
He fell and that’s all it took. Just one step and he would be free of this pain.
“Make you a kick ass album.”
"Why do I have to be a part of that?"
That’s when the panic sets in.
“No.”
“Molly about Jim…” Sherlock started but not sure how to continue simply shifted nervously not wanting to tell her.
"I thought I told you to bugger off." John said pushing his face into his pillow.
"I'll figure it out. Promise."
They said their goodbyes at Sherlock’s door and Sherlock headed inside with a smile plastered onto his face. He hoped Molly wouldn’t notice or was asleep. She wasn’t and she did.
“Sherlock..” John looked into Sherlock's eyes, ever changing color and depth. He wanted to say everything he was thinking, everything Sherlock meant to him but there were no words he could come up with to describe it. “Thank you.”
Rewriting this I'm getting serious 'Stuart Little' vibes here, probably not appropriate but can't help it. Just me?
“Baker Street.” Sherlock replied coolly and rested back in his seat clearly not in the mood for talking and Greg didn’t blame him. He simply pulled the car out of the area and started going back towards Baker Street.
“It’s close enough.” Sherlock shrugged and they both smiled. When the soft smiles faded from their faces Lestrade handed over the case file.
“Um, just a question, if you don’t mind.” He asked in a timid voice looking down.
“Sherlock-“ Lestrade sighs as he too stands up and sticks his hands in his pockets trying to claim the picture of nonchalant and failing. “He probably doesn’t even-“
"Well regular like me I don't know about you right now." Lestrade muttered as he does the search on his computer again.
“Yes, I want to know.” John says softly leaning against the door watching him, he didn’t know what was happening with Sherlock but he wanted to help. He was honestly shocked by everything he said and unsure what it meant.
“Okay.” John said happily as she took off the helmet before doing a double take and looking at Sherlock unsure. “O-Only if you want to of course. I wouldn’t want you to if-”
“What happened?” Sherlock asks with a groan not recalling as he sits up not feeling much of the pain yet still coming back to himself.
“Oh my goodness!” Molly yelled into her pillow before turning and jumping up from her bed to hug Sherlock.
This time Sherlock appeared inside the flat, sitting in his chair long caked with dust yet not disturbing a particle of it. His ankle sat over his knee and he stared unwavering into the void of the dark kitchen, his eyes were always vacant and black. Sherlocks irises were always changing color and vibrancy with his moods and expressions, twisting shades almost constantly. It only made sense that this mere photocopy of the man had no such color, he was printed black and white from his skin to his shoes. There wasn’t a spark to be found.
"I need this copied immediately." Sherlock demanded of the guard and they did it without question and he was leaving. He ignored Lestrade's attempt at speaking to him in favor of getting in his car and turning up the radio.
“You wanted to guilt John. He didn’t kill him.”
"Sherlock?" John called as he sat typing out his blog. They just returned from a long case with an Irish diplomat in Ireland and they were both extremely happy to be home.
“This doesn’t make sense.” John said confused looking down the line of photos. “Why are these here? Why Sebastian? Why..” He sighed looking to Sherlock as he heard papers crunching. “What are you doing?”
And so we began.
It was exactly the opposite as he expected. Yes, his mind was greater than others; he was one of the most gifted architects to meet that of the dream world. That was when he could do it. He was wrong. His mind was indeed so great it made him so prone to the limbo state he had nearly slipped there too many times.
“He’s angry isn’t he?” Mycroft asked into the quiet trying to shake the odd feeling he always got around hospitals.
“I’m disappointed, I am. I expected more dear Johnny boy.” James said, crouching in front of them. “Far, far more.”
"So assuming you already came to that conclusion on your own, why get me to say it?" John says slightly irritated looking back behind his chair. Of course Sherlock had already thought of that he was a genius of course.
He couldn’t see. His eyes weren’t open, he felt a bit like a newborn discovering things for the first time. He opened his eyes to the bright world around him, taking a moment for his eyes to adjust to the light. Slowly he was able to see the moon and the stars above.
"I think I'd rather be a doctor. I'd make a lot more money as well, so win win." John explains throwing the empty tub of ice cream into the trash across the room. It missed. "What else do we have?"
The car rolled to a stop outside a building in pieces, broken apart by the years that it had stood empty. The second story too the worse of it all though the bottom seemed to be intact. Overgrown weeds and rubbish littering the grounds around it. Metal fencing around the entire place, warning signs attached to every side.
"John." Sherlock called and John's head lifted a little light in his eyes as he looked to Sherlock. Mycroft stopped talking. "Come on we're leaving." John started to stand but Mycroft put a hand on his arm and he froze. "What?"
John felt so comfortable with his touch and it seemed Sherlock was too. He wished he could remember if he could even just remember this man he’d be fine to forget the world. The world didn’t care like Sherlock did.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
He didn’t let go, someone pulled him out and laid him on the damp grass and John was right beside him. He held his hand and didn’t let go, not even once. When he got the chance he looked to his face and what he saw made him want to murder Moriarty himself. Sherlock looked like a corpse, he was hardly breathing at all and he had injuries over the entire expanse of his body.
“I’m leaving.” Jim said simply as he packed his bag, he didn’t have much to say or many possessions to pack for that matter.
"Mmm yes of course.." Sherlock muttered back still not paying attention as he walked through the street. John watched for few moments as the blinking on his arm started getting faster.
Just Sherlock. Living, breathing right next to him and maybe moving and speaking and smiling too. Just maybe it would be okay.
A noise pulled John from his drawings which he had only just finished the sketching and outlining of. He listened for a moment but the sound didn't come again, it sounded like something metallic hitting the ground. It was so late that all the nurses had gone home and none of the patients should be up. John got up figuring someone else was just as restless as he was and ventured into the hall.
Sherlock came into the room slowly, closing the door behind him quietly and coming to sit on the edge of John’s old bed. John was asleep seemingly peacefully by his facial expression and Sherlock just hoped he’ll be alright.
“Of course. Goodbye.”
"Yes well, I didn't have much time to unpack." Sherlock muttered almost ashamed as he moves things around. John wanders over to the skull on the mantle and looks at it with interested.
“Yes. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.” Sherlock says softly smiling and rubbing John’s knuckles with his thumb.
Maybe he was. It didn’t matter at that moment to him, he just wanted to find Sherlock. Have some hope that he was okay and breathing, that he could find that visual and physical assurance that he was okay.
Hours before he’d leave John, deceiving him to keep him safe. Making John hate him, call him a machine. He never came here but it lived in his mind nonetheless.
Where he’d lost John.
“Sherlock.” They heard and turned towards the voice to find Mycroft sauntering towards them.
“Sherlock. Your mannerism is appalling and mummy would hit you upside the head if she were here. Frankly I’m resisting the urge to myself.”
"Well, sexually." She says frankly putting sauce on pasta strips over a layer of ricotta. John swears he almost cut his finger off. Sherlock says he's exaggerating.
It wasn’t long until the door was swung open, harsh winds pushing the door quite violently forward and coming back to hit the wall with a loud thump, thunder growling in the background. James came into the room dropping his soaked bag beside him, with how wet he was one might think he had fallen into a creek.
“Probably not but I don’t care.” Sherlock replies offhandedly as the people around him stand up straighter in Mycroft's presence. Sherlock makes an effort to slouch.
"I've been wanting to talk to you without Shelrock here for a while by that hardly ever happens." Molly replied with an oddly suggestive smile.
Sherlock didn’t even think as he grabbed both of John’s hands in his own and held them together, pulling them down to the mattress. They both looked shocked by the movement and Sherlock quickly looked to the nurse to see if she would disapprove but she just smiled and continued working. They sat in silence for a minute till the helmet flared to life with a buzzing noise. Mrs Carson pulled a chair over and sat, lifting the device to his head and hooking it to a monitor.
“His last album.” Sherlock informs her as he did his research paper and wrote notes in his ridiculous hand writing that no one can read but himself.
“Amazing it’s been really amazing. Especially the night life don’t get much of it where I grew up. It’s a nice change.”
"Yes, I've already contacted Mycroft to get a team ready. He said they'll be ready by tomorrow afternoon." Sherlock assured quickly to avoid further panic.
Suddenly there were more voices that he could recognize, Mycroft. His voice seemed to be further away than John’s was, his was practically right in his ear while Mycroft’s seemed to float over his head. He realized it was possible he was sedated and coming around, he only hoped that’s what it was. If that was the case if he could signal someone to get him off the sedative he might be able to get out of whatever this was.
He opened the door and stopped through, looking around. It was so familiar, dusty and old but familiar and so wonderful to be around.
“Alright, fine.” Molly says laying back into her bed herself. She didn’t want to push sherlock but she was concerned as to what he was talking about and didn’t know if she’d be able to sleep that night because if it.
He smiled and turned back around to sit in his chair and just watch Sherlock, in no rush or worry with the situation. Unlike the dangling detective who quickly attempted to stop the box from crumbling any further under his weight.
“Well, why are you helping me? We just met, I’m sure you have your own problems, you don’t have to stay.” Sherlock felt immediately stupid he should have realised John would go there, Lestrade had said he blamed himself, he probably thought he didn’t deserve the help. He quickly strode forward and placed his hands on John’s shoulders, causing him to startle and look up.
He made his way down the stairs and back to his room, it was early afternoon the sky slowly turning pink and orange then darkening high up. Sherlock had always loved astronomy, his earliest memories were of his mother taking him and Mycroft on the balcony outside his parents bedroom -which they were never aloud in- and teaching them the names of the stars. She actually named stars after them not just randomly picking one like normal people no she actually bought them each a star, it was brilliantly thrilling to Sherlock to be apart of constellations.
“I like you, John, for what reason I can't fathom. I’m not inconveniencing myself by being here helping you, odd as it is, I actually want to help you. You shouldn’t act like you don’t deserve to be helped or liked. I like you, I want to help you.” John looked as if we might cry but shook himself out of it as Sherlock put his hand out again. “Can I help you, as a friend?”
When they broke apart panting and gasping for air they could help but look into each other's surprised faces and laugh.
John got up and made his way into the kitchen, watched Sherlock pace from his place at the counter. He made tea for the bother them, listened to Sherlocks mumbling voice from the living room.
“Yeah. Sad, I know.” John says quietly picking at his fingernails.
After about two minutes of inner turmoil Sherlock threw the box across the room and flopped onto his bed. The patches were all over the room now taunting him. Maybe he'd visit John, he always seemed to make him forget everything he was thinking.
“Lestrade.”
“I’m just going to sleep.” John shrugged lightly and sat down in the chair opposite to Sherlock, sinking down into the cushions and leaning back. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
The pain curled in John's stomach and lodged deep in his throat. He took a breath trying to steady himself, breathing in the thick air of whatever substance was being pushed into the room. He sighed trying not to let it get to his head, he had to save Greg.
The whole thing seemed fictional and John couldn’t put himself into the place of the man that had shot the cabbie. He couldn’t possibly ever do it, could he?
“No, not yet at least.”John’s says with a grin standing before his bed before pulling Sherlock closer to himself and letting his face soften. Coming down from the euphoric high that they’d had been on to have this more serious conversation. “I don’t want to rush into this, like I have, and I know that you have as well into just about everything else. So it’s a relationship not just a one night stand, you know?”
Sherlock looked forward to the pictures and he hadn’t realized before but there were two people on them all. A boy of probably thirteen with blond hair and another only a little bit older than the other with black hair.
“Sherlock! I’m serious-”
"Oh, that's John. Poor soul."
“In your office, I’d rather he not be here for this conversation.” Sherlock says as he falls into a chair pulling his feet over the arm as he stared at the ceiling.
“Of course, anytime.” Sherlock smiled softly at him before looking over at the kitchen sink where the pan lay. “Now, clean my pan.” He said with no heat and a grin, moving back.
(See the end of the chapter for
He got to the flat as fast as he could. John no longer lived there but John was there today. For some reason he had gone, mycroft had told him he had forgotten to listen. All he was focusing on was finally seeing his John again.
“Didn’t I tell you?” Roger asked from his place not having stirred from his position at all but to glance at his son's state before looking back to the paper.
“What the fuck?” Sherlock yelled grabbing Molly’s arms in surprise needing a stabilizer.
"She favorited Harry. Definitely. They would
A race they had already lost to. Greg watched Mycroft from afar talking to one of his underlings. He felt bad for him, he knew he was a wreck, Greg was too but he had the luxury of showing it. Mycroft didn’t do that and it wasn’t that he pitied him for it, he was just upset he didn’t get the option to show it. Especially with the situation at hand, when he was struggling to contain it.
“Your not doing anything wrong just getting some air. Were going to be on the roof not jumping off of it.” And that’s all it took for John to hesitantly say ’okay’ and let Sherlock pull him into the elevator and go up. As they got closer to the top Sherlock could tell John was nervous from the way his foot was moving side to side spontaneously to the grip then release thing he was doing to the shoulders of Sherlock's shirt, he could tell he was pretty stressed out.
“A week?!” Sherlock asked incredulously and sat up straight, Mycroft pushed him right back down again as the pain came.
“No.”
“Just a song you know, I’m sure.” Sherlock waved her off trying to ignore the music that was in fact very familiar to him as well.
“Scawy.” John says biting his lip as tears well up in his eyes. “I don’t wike it Shewock.” He says fearfully.
"Hmm. Yes well have to work on that." Sherlock muttered to himself before coming to stand behind John's chair. "Let me." Sherlock poised his perfectly manicured fingers over the keyboard and in swift precision clicked the correct letters -John could never go without a sentence before deleting something- and the word appeared on the screen. John smiled slightly abashed.
“Look at you. So human, isn't it sickening?” Moriarty drawled and for a moment as Sherlocks sight settled onto him, he looked like a shadow through his blurred vision. A dark and evil something with too much light around him.
"New Mexico, and I don't mean that as a cliche. In fact a number of ten so far missing parents or spouses in similar circumstances disappeared to New Mexico. This is because the gang 'El Toro De Fuego' is recruiting men and women well informed with cars. Reasons for taking out money probably buying a vehicle and disappearing randomly she didn't want to get a criminal record. It's rather simple when you think of the facts."
"Yes that's what I said." Sherlock looks at John a moment taking in his expression. "Unless of course you don't-"
“I win, you give me a tenner.”
“Because John-“ Sherlock replies exasperated coming closer to him and grabbing his shoulders. “-I like you.”
“Then why are you here, dear?” He sat up to retort but she was already gone. With an aggravated sigh he got up and put on his blue silk robe and opened the door enough to stick his head out.
“It’s Greg.” Lestrade rolls his eyes.
“Tiwed.” John complains walking unsteadily closer to Sherlock leaning against his chest. Sherlock smiles softly at Johns pronunciation of his words finding it rather adorable.
“Why did you pick that one?”
The building went up in flames the second Moriarty was in one of the patrol cars. Greg watched in horror, bits of the building going up in the explosion a burst of colors he didn’t have time to witness. Knowing what came next he looked around as quick as he could spotting Mycroft not too far away.
Things had been hectic which wasn't the plan. Plans never really seemed to work for the two or at least nothing normal on the plan would work.
"Out, you and I. Two people go out and have fun a date type of thing, though that's just how it's been described to me. So-"
"Oh just thinking don't let it alarm you." He replied as he sat up and looked over at the file on his bedside table, John noticed.
“I guess we should get you ready then.” Sherlock said quietly after he finished talking with the man at the door. He sighed softly to himself as John nodded and lifted his arms up to him quietly asking to be picked up. He came over and picked John up and brought him to the bedroom to pack up the things John would need for his stay.
He kept a steady grip on his waist as they slowly made their way to the short wall that led to the edge. They stood their together just staring out into the abyss that was the night sky. The wind was chilling to the bone as neither of them had thought to bring coats but neither cared, huddling up together was enough.
Beep! Beep!
“Really? Funny how that happens.” Sherlock says suspiciously.
“Yes I suppose so.” Sherlock was taken aback when she suddenly hugged him out of the blue. He didn’t mind he never really did with her, Mrs Hudson has and always will be like the Grandmother he never got. He appreciated her comfort so he hugged her back feeling completely at ease with himself like he hasn’t felt in such a long time.
The wind blew a whistling howl, trees rustling in the distance with the moon light overhead. The area was lit but Sherlock was nowhere to be seen just John and Greg’s prone form.
"Yeah, she was doing the car thing for a while. Selling 'em you know. And bikes too. But we were fine with money mind you, we weren't starving or nothing. Me being the good older sister and everything, I did a few things here and there."
“Gregory would not harm him.” Mycroft said following him out the door.
“I’m sorry about your friend.”
His hearing seemed to be coming back more steadily than his sight so he focused on that for the moment instead of the increasingly worrying variables of what had become of himself. He heard the voice of what seemed to be a middle aged woman and an older man, it was very difficult to make sense of what they were saying, despite hearing the words he couldn’t seem to string them together.
“Yes you mentioned something about your hometown, some kind of big news? What’s that about?”
"Maybe, I'll guess we'll find out. Though, I think both of them needed more time in the hospital to recover." Greg grumbled a bit as they stopped beside Mycroft's car.
“I-” Sherlock cut him off, he was almost glad Sherlock had cut him off, he didn’t know what he’d say.
“No, how could you possibly be so oblivious.” Sherlock said rolling his eyes and sighing dramatically. “I like you, like actually really like, like you.” He said slowly so John could understand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tell me.” Moriarty says crouching beside Sherlock, bloodied and broken form. “How does it feel being the sacrifice.”
Sherlock ignored him and left slamming the door behind him he grabbed John’s arm and left the building.
He nodded slowly taking in the information and processing it slowly. “How long?”
"Do you have a last name?"
“He’s not scary.” Sherlock scoffs lifting John up as he stands eliciting a small yelp of surprises from the little doctor. “He’s a bint.”
“Oh, I almost forgot. I grabbed a few more things.” Lestrade said as lifted his abandoned briefcase onto the bed then searched through it. He pulled out plastic containers of takeaway and a case file, Johns case file. Sherlock reaches for it but Lestrade snatched it away so Sherlock scowls up at him from his place on the bed.
“I don’t know…”
He rolled onto his back trying to find a way to breath until he realized what a mistake that was. He screams, screams so loud it rips his vocal chords apart. It burns his throat and his voice breaks off so quickly.
“Oh! Sorry, sorry.” She amended quietly though not entirely sorry and scurried over to where Sherlock was studying. Not school but forensic files.
"He's out there planning something, he left that message telling you to 'send your dog'. He expects you to know where. Think, John."
“I know!” They laughed at the absurdity and heard Jonathan's chuckle from past the wall.
After an unidentifiable amount of time his tears died down and he found himself becoming increasingly tired in the arms of this man. He wanted to stay awake to learn about him and their relationship but the rumble of his voice and the soothing smell of a man he felt he knew so well, lulled him into tranquility. He felt himself dozing until the man's voice strong and confident brought him back.
Then piece by piece a trust was formed that the next piece would always find its home. It may take time to find it and where it goes but the promise still stands. With each piece placed it became clear that so many more were missing.
“I can’t, you know it.” Sebastian tried to reason taking Jim’s hand from his arm and holding it gently between his own. “I have to go.”
"When Roger Moriarty was murdered did you look for other living relatives." Sherlock asked as he examined the blood.
With John’s hand in Sherlock’s own they trudged through the streets of London. John was practically jogging behind Sherlock as his long strides ate up the pavement.
"But I should've-" Sherlock turns to John quickly and tries to say but John cuts him off.
"I-I don't know. I only noticed it when my sleeve came up.. what is it?" John asked curiously though cautious he looked at the blinking in his arm. Sherlock looked at it and prodded at it slightly trying to figure out what it was, when he shifted slightly to see it in the sun it blinked faster.
"Sherlock we found- uh.." Lestrade looked between the two men who were looking at him questionably, John's hand still suspended in the air next to Sherlock's mouth. He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Am I interrupting something?"
“Fine.”
“What are we gonna do now?”
“Photographs. John in hospital the day after.. everything.” Sherlock said motioning to the screen which both men glanced at then looked back to Sherlock with ‘so what’ faces. “If you scroll to the right, John before he was brought home, then John today.” In each picture John looked younger than the last the second there wasn’t an entirely huge difference but with the last it was obvious.
"Shame." Is all John says as he goes to sit in one of the chairs, Sherlock follows him and sits in the other. They lapsed into a comfortable silence both of them in their respective headspace.
"Aren't you supposed to kneel?" John asked smiling like an idiot as he stared into the eyes and the man he loved.
Sherlock pulled a chair from John's small table and faced it towards him. John was leaning against the door and running his hands over his face.
As much as Sherlock was thrumming with the anticipation of a crime scene he could see Lestrade needed to see John first. So he peels his eyes open and looks over to the man at the end of his uncomfortable bed.
At some point time started to blur together and as the sun set the hours bled further. He took turn after turn watching the blinking intently speed and slow each time making adjustments to his course.
“Holy shit!” Molly screamed causing Sherlock to almost jump out of the bed.
That is until they see that they are hurt. Seeing that they are in fact the one with the wound, bleeding out and falling apart in front of their own eyes.
Sherlock picked John back up resting him on his hip and went to the door grabbing his phone off the bed as he goes and pocketing it. He sighs quietly steeling himself for what he was about to face.
“I thought you might need my help.” John said and he smiled a bit in the way he did when he was saying something just to annoy Sherlock. He was joking, as if this was okay to distract him in this way while he was on the job.
"I got screwed over. Christ, this whole thing is my fault if I had just looked for a second I might have seen the goddamned signs." John muttered angrily running his fingers through his short blond hair.
Sherlock comes to flop down on the black chair and John follows sinking down onto the opposite one. When he looks up from examining the odd material of the chair he finds Sherlock with his eyes closed hands in a prayer position at his lips. For a second John thought he heard himself say ‘You and your bloody mind palace.’ Like a whisper it fluttered through his mind fleetingly before disappearing.
Sherlock coughed violently, taking slow labored breaths as he tried to push himself up for the third time only to end up in a heap on the ground again.
"It's alright." Sherlock said soothing, gently taking the torch from John and pointing it down the hall where a door now lay open. "I'll go down first, you stay here with Greg."
"There was absolutely no reason for me to go John! Your lucky you didn't go! You would've been so bored!" Sherlock yelled up the stairs as he pounded off his feet to get off the mud. "I know I was!"
For some reason Sherlock moved and John almost fell -as he had put most of his weight on him- but Sherlock was in front of him pinning him to the wall, effectively holding him up. Then all of a sudden Sherlock's lips were on his and for some reason -John couldn't comprehend- he was kissing back.
He sighed to himself and steeled himself as much as he could before moving down the second hallway. Somehow the yells from down the hall made him feel a little less scared than complete silence, he could think of that rather than the bad things that could happen.
I’m guesstimating 20 chapters it may be more or possible less.. idk. Anyway enjoy!
John stood up and got into the ambulance as he was ushered inside, the doors closed and the vehicle started driving off. A paramedic puttered around him as he sat in one of the seats off to the side, closer to the back. Sherlock had left when he got inside, he was busy, John didn’t blame him for leaving him with Greg. It helped him to focus on what he needed to and to answer the paramedics questions as well as he could.
Sherlock would lay there and brush his fingers through John’s silky blond hair that was just starting to gray about his temples. John would wake slowly, his eyes fluttering open and looking to him with the most angelic smile. But all that was gone now.
Long chapter, yay! Due to unforeseen circumstances I will be traveling far away by car and will not have time to write. So unfortunately I will be going on a temporary hiatus for two to possibly three weeks. My sincerest apologies but things happen and sometimes there is nothing you can do about it. Hope you enjoyed the chapter see you hopefully soon, bye!
“Mycroft.” Sherlock growls looking up to him. “I told you to wait.”
“Tell me, do you have the time of how long it’d take before you’d run out of oxygen?” Sherlock took a breath slowly and nodded as carefully as he could, otherwise staying still.
"You think so?"
Eventually John ushered Sherlock out so he could get ready for seemingly hours. Once he was gone John went to call Lestrade in need of advice and across the hall in Sherlock's room he was calling Mrs Hudson for the same.
“Okay, listen. Before I go blabbering on about someone else’s life- which I really shouldn’t by the way -I have to ask. Why, Sherlock? He’s been through enough already. So If you are going to-“
The rough translation of which he could supply to his brother and Greg would be that John was being held at the power plant and to which they had better hurry in meeting him there. He offered no further explanation and no further was demanded of him.
“You want to know why. You want to know why I lie in bed thinking every night, why my dreams are plaguing me. Why everytime I try to think straight I can’t because one person is messing with my thoughts. Why everytime I see you with someone I have to pull you apart or else I’ll fall apart.” Sherlock says, it all rushing out like a stream, he takes a step back not expecting himself to say that.
Sherlock followed him slowly, watching him sit on the floor in front of the couch again and start picking at his fingernails, apparently bored. John hadn't said a word since his nightmare the night before. Sherlock wasn't sure whether to be concerned or afraid for his mental health, other than that he seemed fine, thankfully. He'd eaten the breakfast Sherlock had made him as well as drank the tea, then sat by the couch and watched him as he thought. He missed his John already and this boy wasn't even close to him.
John lay awake the feeling of unease in the pit of his stomach keeping him up. He was so restless he decided to get up and try drawing to help him fall asleep. He slipped from Sherlocks light grasp and walked quietly to his desk in the corner. He lit a small candle he had set up, liking the firelight much more than artificial lamp lightning.
They sat for a while just eating the rapidly cooling takeaway from down the street. Lestrade was anxious anyone could see by the way his hand was shaking as he scooped noodles into his mouth, it concerned Sherlock more than it should have. Lestrade dropped the fork and put his box aside turn to Sherlock on the bed.
"Did what?" He growled typing furiously.
For the first time in John's extravagant life he felt whole.
Sherlock had to think. This was important, a game and it seemed the prize was John. Whoever this person is clearly John knows him but he wouldn't speak of him now. He's playing meticulously every move paid specific and precise attention to. Sherlock just needed to find a weak point.
“No idea.” John said trailing behind him looking at each of the pictures trying not to appear as freaked out as he was. “I only ever met Sebastian once, I never saw him again after that.”
In the cab ride to the flat Sherlock told John the story of how they met and had John read his blog as well. It was rather fascinating the cabbie, the two pills, Johns apparent limp that suddenly went away. It was fascinating, yes, but it was like reading someone else’s life not his own. The John in the story had killed for Sherlock only a day or so after meeting him.
“I messed up, Mycroft.” Sherlock admitted his voice think with emotion.
“Yoo-hoo. Sherlock dear, are you awake?” Mrs Hudson whispered cracking open the door, Sherlock found himself slightly chuckling.
“I can’t believe you.. You didn’t spare me the pain, so why should I give you the satisfaction?” John pointed it right at his head.
“I’m sorry John.. I love you.” Sherlock said softly and kisses John's head lightly.
"I know. What do you have?" Sherlock avoiding the subject getting back into being the detective again.
“Nooo.” John whines pulling on his shirt weakly his eyes closed unable to keep them open any longer. “Stay.” He peels an eye open to look up at Sherlock. “Pwease?”
“By staying all of us, together.” Mycroft replies as they entered the little coffee shop. All they needed was to stick together and they’d be fine.
"Sherlock you're not even supposed to be here right now I can't just let you-" Lestrade was cut off as Sherlock takes the laptop and flips it towards him.
"It'll be fine, you can still see me with this." Sherlock assured giving him the torch back. "I'm just going to check."
“Wake up.” John said with his voice of silk as he brushes a hand through Sherlocks curls cupping the side of his face. He watched him softly with an expression of adoring, his eyes a deep blue that reminded Sherlock of the ocean.
"Christ." John breathed out as he fell next to Sherlock, he was getting up again.
"'Lock." Sherlock opened his mouth again to accept another bite. That was another thing, one day John had just called him 'Lock' by accident and was embarrassed and started apologizing profusely when Sherlock just said 'I like it'. John uses it almost all the time now. Sherlock gets butterflies every time and has to repress a smile. As John lifted the fork to his mouth again as voice came from the door, John looked behind him at it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s my old school..” John remembered being terrified of going to that school every morning where Jim and his ‘buddies’ would make his life even more miserable than it already was. “He and his friends used to terrorize me there.”
“Concussed, two fractured ribs, first and second degree burns although in minimal areas. Somehow you survived relatively unscathed.”
Concealed. Unnoticeable.
John stared for a moment waiting for an emotion to take over and overflow his features. Nothing came for a short time and Sherlock rubbed Johns back gently in an attempt to make him feel even just a slight bit better. It took a moment but John's features settled to something of determination although there was a saddened tone to the underside. He wasn’t an absentminded child and despite being the young age that he was he was still rather intelligent and empathetic more than anything, recognizing the difficult situation as it was for Sherlock.
They spent years together, in the comforts of Baker Street. It wasn’t so bad. John loved it here, they were together and everything went as they wanted. He could live like this in a place he wanted to be.
missing it now.
There was so much blood and he didn’t know how to stop it. Like everything he’d ever learned had suddenly left his head. He knew first aid, he knew how to survive and he forgot. He forgot how much blood loss was fatal.
“Why would you say that?”
"Thank you, for bringing my family back together." John whispers into the embrace. Sherlock finds himself actually flushing like a teenage girl.
A string hung from the ceiling and another and another. Millions of them scattered about dangling from the ceiling. At the end of each one a paper, taped to the strings and the nimble fingers connected them all, one by one.
“Was that the answer you were hoping for?”
He loved John Watson.
Sherlock sighs softly caving immediately not able to deny him anything. “Yeah okay, I will.” He takes John’s hands gently from his shirt and getting into the bed beside him. After a bit of shuffling and trying to get comfortable both find their positions, John curled up on Sherlock’s chest as he holds him close.
“Shewock?” John says quietly yawning and looking up at Sherlock blurry eyed. He looked sickly which was opposite really. Looking sickly was first and treatment after but apparently this wasn’t the case.
“Calm down both of you, alright. Sherlock can help me with the music and Molly you can.. coordinate with manager.” He says and Molly buys right into his act.
"Why?" Molly nods before asking sceptically.
"I took it from your jacket and I needed your aunts address. I can't deduce everything." Sherlock grumbles to himself as he types quickly his fingers flying across the little keyboard of Johns older version phone.
Clearly John wasn't at that stage yet and Sherlock would have fun embarrassing him. It was partly to get his mind off the fact of his cousin, which it would.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Really?"
"Sherlock." He stared resolutely at the microscope in front of him suddenly unsure and acting the opposite of the cocky confident detective John knew so well. "Look at me, please." He reluctantly lifted his head to meet John's eyes, confidence was nonexistent in his own eyes just doubt with an underlying fear.
"Four days dead, froze, cut after, now can we go home?" John complained lifting an arm for Sherlock to pull him up. As annoying as he was Sherlock would still help him up off the ground, he understood the problem of John's leg pains and helped him. Occasionally.
Sherlock remembers hearing John say that he can be dangerous and lash out if woken from a nightmare so he stands back and waits. He doesn't wait long however not liking seeing John in pain he calls out for him.
"Don't have anything to say." John mumbled quietly, his voice high pitched and far too young to possibly be his flatmate. Not only his flatmate but his lover and as cheesy as it was his boyfriend.
Sherlock shifts slowly to sit back against the headboard as he feels John drift to sleep. He sighs quietly to himself brushing a strand of John’s hair gently behind his ear. He seemed impossibly more innocent and small while sleeping it was cute yes but also made his chest ache terribly.
He shook himself from his thoughts and carefully packaged the correct serum, making sure it was entirely safe and secure before tucking it in his coat pocket. Quickly grabbing his phone to inform his brother of his discovery and demand John to be brought back.
He stepped into the kitchen and looked down the hallway, Johns back just visible, his gorgeous hair illuminated in the sunlight. He took a step and another before eventually he was standing until he doorway.
“Not as perfect as a wine holder.” Sherlock said rolling his eyes and taking up the whiskey bottle again.
“Two swears in a month Molly I’m impressed.” After a moment of taking in her shocked expression staring at the wall Sherlock thought maybe she was going to pass out. “What is it?”
“Fine.”
"And what's the syringe for?"
"Oh that boy. I never know where he is." She waves off the question and stands up. "How would you two like to stay for dinner? Hmm? I'm sure I can whip up something." She offers as she makes her way to the kitchen.
"Could I-" He cut himself off, not sure what he's saying. It was odd the words just seemed to come out of nowhere without a thought to it, even grabbing Mrs Hudson was like instinct. She seemed to know what he was about to say though and looked at him knowingly sympathetic.
"Well first I'd show you around London maybe we'll visit my parents. Then France or Italy for wine and cheese all the gourmet foods. If you wanted we'd travel to America, New York the city never sleeps or Texas where the sunsets would take your breath away.California or Maine to visitor the beaches but I don't think I'd care though as long as I was with you."
“No, well, not that way. It’s hard to explain.”
The Sherlock in John’s mind didn’t have cuts or bruising or stitches or anything, he was still spotless and perfect and hadn’t been put into immense pain because of John. He was still porcelain and had no cracks in his surface, unlike the one he’d hurt still lying in the bed.
We looked all over the town- -the state for Christ sake- - Dad even filed a police report but they found nothing. Then a week later a large sum of money was pulled from her and my Dad's bank account, more than half was taken out. We weren't wealthy by any means, practically living in the dumps so when that happened we weren't left with much." John said solemnly.
Sherlock nods understanding entirely, sobering instantly from their playful mood to something a bit more concrete and serious. “Yes I do and I agree.” He lifts John’s hand and kisses his knuckles lightly.
“Always.” He answered as he had so long ago now.
surprised at his abrupt wording that he hardly ever used. Sherlock was far too sophisticated. Or at least he thought he was.
Blood was all over the floor, so much, it pooled and streaked across the floor. Like Sherlock had been cut open and dragged like some sort of animal, John felt sick but what sickened him most was that Sherlock was nowhere to be found. Just blood.
Sigh.
John reached his hand outstretched behind him as he walked further into the city sidewalks slowly becoming more busy. John smiled to himself as he felt Sherlocks fingers intertwined with his own. John pulled him forward so they could walk side by side and leaned into his side.
"You can't promise that."
"Oh lovely. Hand them to John to be cut up and you can help me make more of this special ricotta." Maggie says taking her pan of pasta and turning to the stove to pull more noodles from the pots.
They both fawned over the boys as it was,but now they were ecstatic at even the thought of them together.
“Say it again. Just once more.” He longingly asked looking to his newly found lover, their eyes meeting dreamily.
The file was morbid in every sense of the word. The uncle's remains and John's wounds all recorded inside. Sherlock instantly switched into detective mode picking out the details although hard in pictures. He ignored the faces trying to block out his feelings like he's always done before with other cases but this was John. No matter how hard he tried he could still see John's face become angry of his wounds and sympathetic to what he had witnessed. There wasn't much of importance or at least not that Sherlock could pick out at this moment too overwhelmed by emotions. He threw the file to the ground his stomach turning.
They were both crying now he was sure of it. Mycroft would tell him he was being sentimental getting too attached but Sherlock couldn't find it in him to care.
"We just need to know where Jim is." John says quickly and Sherlock mutters some unintelligible under his breath. John's sure it wasn't nice.
So let’s just say they had a very Happy Christmas.
“I wasn’t allowed to play in the snow as a child my father feared the cold, we would hardly open the door trying to keep in the heat. I think I’ve developed my own distaste for it. It’s different now, now that I’ve gotten him what he needs what we need, sometimes I think I’ve dreamed the whole thing and I’ll wake up on a springy mattress huddling together with my sister for warmth.” John admitted quietly shuffling his feet on the shiny floor. Sherlock stared at him, his admittance hung in the air and Sherlock felt the need to reciprocate.
“Of course, good.” Sherlock says simply relieved that John was okay.
“Why would I be angry? This is huge.” She exclaims happily moving back and holding his shoulders.
“Come on, let’s get a move on.” John looked hesitant and he slid his bare feet to the floor turning towards Sherlock but still not taking the offered hands. “What is it?”
"I-" John sighed to himself falling onto his back on the floor. "I don't know."
Sherlock thought he was dying, he expected to die. Alone here in an empty school hallway. A complete failure to everyone, he couldn’t even save the person he loved more than anyone.
“Where’s John?” Lestrade asks standing as he enters the conference room.
Their first fight, their first real fight. In which John threw his cup at the wall and was upset for days after, it was Sherlock's fault and he felt guilty to this day. John loved that mug and Sherlock took away that joy. It was so simple and pretty and it seared into his mind.
“What’re you helping him with?” She asks coming to flop on her bed exhausted from lectures.
“Walk.”
It was when he slept, he got younger. Sherlock should’ve noticed before then but he was just so confused by the whole situation he wasn’t thinking clearly. He cursed himself quietly for not seeing it sooner and held John to his chest trying to sooth him.
“John is just a kid, younger than you, you know. And the way he acted, as if it was his fault, fucking messed up.”
The sound of rushing water hit Greg’s ears first though it mustn’t be water for he wasn’t wet in the slightest his mind told him. How could he know such a thing having no real feeling of his body? Beside a stream, he guessed. There weren’t streams near the school.
"Thank you."
“Yes of course I like you.” Sherlock said backing away from him. “I’ve idolized you since I first saw you on the telly. How could I not like you. But-“ He was about to say more when John’s lips were on his own, his arms around his neck. He placed his own on John’s waist and back holding him close and kissing him deeply.
“Really?” Sherlock asks looking over at him curiously. He had just figured he wanted sex or something.
“Well I’ll leave you to it then. Be careful and-” she said as she started gathering the W.A.Y.
“Oh you should've seen him. I've never seen him so hopeful couldn't stop talking about his night out with Sherlock. It really was adorable.”
John sits on the floor watching him tracing him with his eyes. Watching as the carpet flips occasionally at the edges and his socks shift down his ankles as he shuffles his feet.
“Because he is as gay as I am, and as fake as that magazine your reading.” Sherlock grumbled and before she could protest switched off the light.
"Yeah, we can do this."
“You’d actually do all that?” John sniffled into his shirt trying to catch his breath.
The need for something stimulating seemed to drown him, even just a cigarette might do. He needed something, anything that would satisfy him. He vaguely wondered if he could nick a cigarette off of a doctor. He remembered seeing Dr. Anderson using one in the doctors lounge, seeing how much of an idiot he was it’d be easy to pull it from his coat. Perhaps he left a box in the lounge, then he’d just have to get in with one of their cards. Easy.
James’s elegant shoes clicked over slowly, agonizing silence but a shaky breath that was released once he stood over them. Dressed in a crisp suit of black and red, all Sherlock could think of was blood.
“Moriarty?” Sherlock asked after a moment looking up to him.
"I don't care how you deal with it just get it done." Sherlock snapped his patience wearing extremely thin at this ridiculous conversation.
He sighed to himself and uttered a string of curses before turning back to the door. There was a distinct high pitched sound as air puffed into his face, he immediately covered his face with his arm attempting to shield himself from the possibly harming substance.
“No, you’re not.” Roger Moriarty, Jim’s father said not leaving room for discussion, a large man and not a force to oppose. There was an underlying assurance in his tone like he knew he wouldn’t go.
“As much as I would love to hear your ‘don’t hurt him or I’ll hurt you’ speech, I won’t be doing anything of the sort. I hope to help as- though I am loathe to say it -a friend. Shocked as you might be I do have a few.” Lestrade looked at him for a moment, trying to figure out if he was lying. Whatever he saw must have satisfied him.
He doesn’t want to leave, he wants to stay and tell these people to leave them alone, to reassure John and make him laugh again, make everything okay. He can’t, he knows he can’t but it’s all he can think about as he starts his slow descent back to the living room.
The lights flicked on and Sherlock groaned quietly at the sudden light sitting up and looking at Molly through squinted eyes due to the harsh lighting.
Sherlock hung up and started pacing behind John prattling on about something or other. John couldn't keep up.
John's head was in a whirlwind, just when he finally thought some peace would come for his life Jim Moriarty had to come crashing back in. He remembers him from when they were children he met him only a few days after his parents murder, three to be exact. He remembers as he watched from the porch out back as Jim Moriarty skinned a stag he had shot, most likely illegally.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock didn't know where John was otherwise he'd drive to him right now. He didn't want that weird drummer to be around John, he didn't want him to be around Molly either but that wasn't going to change anytime soon. Sherlock didn't know what it was about the man that put up so many red flags to him. He was just too perfected, without a flaw as if someone went over his life with an airbrush.
campus. Next day to my surprise my flatmate is Mycroft and he’s helping me through the process of grief and soon enough became one of the best friends I have ever had. Maybe that’s not saving my life, literally but he definitely saved my life that day in my mind.” Greg finished with a small smile and John couldn’t help but smile too.
"Yes, time can only tell what they'll do. I don't believe Sherlock will be telling us. But perhaps John will talk to you if Sherlock tells him anything." Mycroft suggested as they hit the pavement his ever present umbrella swinging beside him.
“What’s happening?”
“It’s Jim Sherlock it’s not that hard to remember. But it was a lovely date.” She said dreamily standing from her desk to sit on her bed.
“Let’s not forget that. See ya, Greg.” John says sarcastically as he waves goodbye to Lestrade who reciprocates laughing a bit. Sherlock tugs John’s hood up as he leaves and John swats his hand away going to stand in the hall as Sherlock shuts the door.
John turned pressing his back against the door and watching Sherlock go nervously. He looked around the room trying to tell what had just happened with the knife, suddenly being dropped. He tried to see the blade from where he was standing, noticing just barley through the dark the string pooled around it.
“Not necessarily, on Moriarty’s orders any one of his followers could have done this.” Mycroft says thoughtfully also examining the board but coming to stand with Sherlock, Lestrade following shortly.
“The third one from the right. That’s him.” Sherlock says before sweeping out of the room. Mycroft would have assumed he would want to be the first to interrogate him but then again Sherlock did love to surprise him.
Sherlock shook himself trying not to think about it but that was just about impossible with his mind. He pulled out his phone to text Mycroft about the details of getting the tracker out of John and hopefully some progress on a cure.
Sherlock pried his eyes open again a jumble of mixed colors coming into his sight that he couldn’t separate. Just as he couldn’t with the voices either, it came in as too much information that he couldn't find it in him to find meaning to. The voices seemed to become more hushed after he did so though so he knew that they had seen what he had done, that ruled out the being dead possibility. Head injury was becoming more and more likely.
"Because I knew, John." Sherlock said instantly, coming to stand in front of him.
“Just a bit.” John brushed it off smiling slightly. “Continue.”
"I hate when your right." John grumbled even though he was smiling.
For some reason John was drawn to him, this urging need to be in his presence as if he craved the man himself. The feeling ached inside of his chest as he stared at the closed door. It pulled and pushed at his chest at the same time making him wriggle in unease as he tried to satisfy the odd feeling. He fell to his side laying on the bed then lifting the covers to his shoulders while continuing to stare at the closed door between them. Even with the promise Sherlock had left him with he was still uncertain of everything that has happened in only two days.
“Yes. Yes oh gosh I’m sorry. I’ll just stay quiet now.”
Finally, in the dark of the night, hours later it led him to a warehouse. Or at least what remained of a warehouse, most of the structure still intact with some holes in the frame and rusty edges. It stood among a graveyard of other storage units and storage compartments of the like.
"I'll go this way." Sherlock said pointing to his right and Greg nodded, turning to his left. Each man went into their room, the doors falling shut behind them and the slamming sound echoed down the hall.
"Of course. And that business would be?" Before Sherlock can answer John pinches his thigh again.
Sherlock moved before he understood what was happening, rushing down the dark halls following the echo of his shrill scream. John’s voice rang in his mind for a moment, ‘It’s a trap’ he said. He knew that, of course it was but what was he supposed to do. He couldn’t wait, he couldn’t stop for someone to come fix everything, heros didn’t exist. Not even the modern kind, he couldn't wait for the police to fail at their jobs so he had to do things on his own. In the dark, in the empty hollow of this power plant.
“It’s too big.” John whines pulling at the material that just barely touched the floor as he swayed back and forth.
A torch rolled and flickered lifeless from the light of the door at the end of the hall. It sat between the two doors and unbeknownst to anyone but the lonely torch a toothing grin glimmered in the dark before the entrance door shut, consuming everything in darkness.
“Yes. He’s going to piece it together and put it in his armory.” Sherlock said placing the bottle down before going back into the kitchen to get tumbler glasses for them.
Lost. Forgotten.
“He doesn’t have family just his father and assistant and they go everywhere with him. Why would he come back here to ‘visit family like he said in his interview? It didn’t make sense.”
“Greg.” That shut him up and Sherlock knew it would. He always feigned ignorance with his name a long ending joke in a way. Now though it had importance only to be used when necessary. Lestrade grunted in response looking everywhere but at him. Sherlock already knew he would come with him the use of his name was significant and Lestrade couldn’t say no.
"Just a few experiments I was working on. Most of them should be thrown out by now." Sherlock replied coming to stand next to him.
“How do you mean?” Greg asked curious yet carefully looking over to him.
“Stop thinking about your fantasies brother. His safety is more important than your compulsive need to control everything. Caring is not an advantage but a weakness, keeping him here will only prove that. Let me transfer him to a safe facility to find a cure and when that is done I will return him to you.” Mycroft says trying to convince him but getting no response he continues. “You may work on the cure as you please but with James Moriarty still at large I cannot guarantee his safety as you’d like. Believe me, this is for the best.”
He walks up slowly the wood creaking beneath his feet with age and use. His eyes fixed on the closed door a dull orange light coming from beneath the door that Sherlock knows is from Johns bedside lamp. He’d complained about the color not matching the ceiling light before, Sherlock misses it now. He misses everything that used to annoy him now and he hates thinking about it every time.
“No.” Sherlock says glancing over at John a moment before going back to his exploration of his hands. “I think this is how it was supposed to be.”
“Sorry, Sherlock.” John said as he plopped down beside him in the small clearing of grass far away from the snow around them. “I’m serious though, I’ve been thinking about what happens at Christmas break. It's November now you know it's only a matter of time before we have to go home again. Well you’ll probably go home I’ll be all around the world like some kind of piece of work to show off.” John grumbled as he picked at his thin winter gloves.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He was fine. I don't think he cares for me much though, he's always with Johnny. I don't blame him though we just don't get on well."
The colors seemed to be easier to identify, a combination of vibrant reds and blues and Sherlock thought it might have been police lights but the sounds didn’t seem to match that of a siren. It was voices, he figured that out already although none of them seemed to be any of that he was familiar with, he wondered if maybe it wasn't an afterlife but being stuck in his own dead body. Somehow his consciousness remained intact after being killed. Although it was a ridiculous thing scientifically it became somewhat possible when it felt like he was living it.
I’ve been gone a while oop- sorry. Lost motivation for a while but I’m back into it! I’ve upped the chapter thing because I don’t know exactly when this will finish chapter wise but it definitely won’t be twenty.
That's when he found a few more pieces they had fallen to the floor in his haste to put the puzzle together. They had been hiding for so long they were a bit misshapen and warped from their time on the floor.
“First time it was a girl though she identified as a boy.. I’m more attracted to men though. I’ve done both once of that answers your question.” Sherlock explains, neither of them were entirely pleasant and he was high as a kite for the second. He was told it was better with the person you truly loved and perhaps he’d find out if that was true, if they ever got to that point.
“It seems to be a good day, I’d imagine if your up for it you could go for a walk soon. I’m sure Mr Holmes would love to take you.” She told him as her eyebrows went up and gave a mischievous wiggle. Sherlock was slightly taken aback -again- but not entirely opposed.
"Yeah well seems like this one didn't get the memo. There's a uh.. signature as well, you'll recognize it." Greg said ominously as he lifted the tape for Sherlock.
This was a mistake.
“I didn’t know if you’d be jealous or something.” Sherlock says feeling a bit silly for thinking that way now.
“I’m going to speak to your nurse and get you cleared. I believe you’ll recover faster at the flat, then I’ll tell you anything you want to know.” The man promised laying John down slowly to his back, he fell practically boneless, his eyelids seeming so heavy as a kiss was placed on his forehead.
John leaned over and hugged Sherlock mindful of the IV. There were tears in both of their eyes because this was a start. They intended to make it work this time, together.
"Because I care about you and don't want you to worry over it." Sherlock explains digging through his supplies before coming up with a syringe.
“Not quite as perfect as that.” John said with a soft smile. “Bloody close though.”
“Now I’ve packed you a bag of snacks for the Twain and extra-“
"Not without you." John says dramatically. "Come on, we can look at it tomorrow, I'm sure you have it all memorized anyway. He's not going anywhere yet. Please?" Sherlock looks over to him and analyzes his expression for a moment before sighing.
John hit the floor with a loud smack of his limbs against the hard flooring. He shuffled back quickly as James loomed over him threateningly, his back pressed to whatever object was behind him.
“Yes, you did.” Mycroft replied in a much less scathing tone it was almost understanding. “That doesn’t mean your relationship is over.”
“I have to know it’s him.” Is all Sherlock says as he walked to the window.
"Sherlock, John is in Dublin." Molly complained coming out of the shower, as Sherlock started knocking on their wall.
“What is it..?” Sherlock asked quietly reaching over and tentatively taking John's hand into his own trying to get a reaction out of him.
There was a ticking somewhere in the distance As Sherlock slammed his shoulder against the door that stood between him and John. It was silent inside but he knew he was there, he had to be. The last four rooms he had done the same to stood empty behind him. It was the last one and it had to be it.
Smile.
“So, loverboy, how was the date?” She asked teasingly as he fell onto his bed opposite hers. Even with Molly poking and prodding into his personal affairs Sherlock couldn’t get the smile off of his face.
He’s sitting in an a classic interview room with various colors decorating the walls and furniture. The interviewer is a women good status in the media and good enough at her job to get him in her studio. Johnathan Watson sits relaxed lounging in his chair the image of calm. But Sherlock can make out little tremors ruining through his hands and right leg. He’s anxious. But about what?
“Can I help, too?” Molly asks moving to the edge of her bed to give John her puppy dog eyes that according to her no man can resist.
Sherlock groaned his arm hitting the metal door with a dull thud that echoed throughout the hallway.
“Wait Johnathan.” Sherlock said urgently pressing himself to the wall as Molly looked at him questionably. The knocking sound game again along with a voice so Sherlock spoke quickly. “Why did you come here?” You could go anywhere, why pick somewhere you’ve already been.
Now though as he places the last piece into the center he realized it was now filled with Sherlock.
Like reading his thoughts -or just knowing what he needed in the morning- Sherlock brought him over a cup of steaming peppermint tea just like he had made about every morning he could. Sherlock was still on his phone having what seemed to be a heated conversation with the DI. John hummed happily as to not disturb Sherlock's call but smiled at him and got a twitch of the detectives lips in response before he was back to spitting remarks. He took a sip and was surprised that Sherlock didn't put any sugar in it just as he liked it. John was very particular to which teas you put sugar in and don't in others, apparently Sherlock was paying attention to that. It warmed him just a bit more.
~Just small edit~ *not update*
"Hmm. Her relationship between the two of you?"
“I have it narrowed down to the two locations with our limited amount of information, though I do believe one is more likely. You may know better than I do, where do you think John?” Sherlock said gesturing to the two circled pins on the map. John assessed them both looking for a familiarity.
“221B Baker Street.” Sherlock announces as they walk into the flat. John looks around curiously at supposedly their flat. It’s messy, ridiculously dirty and outdated yet John feels completely at home. From the skull on the mantle to whatever those stains are on the floor John feels entirely familiar with everything. It’s how he feels around Sherlock but projected on everything around him.
He relished in the moonlight for feeling he’d been left in the dark for ages. His name being called he could recognize vaguely, hardly but a whisper to his ears in the cold of the moonlight. His hands held suspended above his lolling head, something tugging his wrists intermittently.
“So do you. We do this together or not at all, okay?” John asked, wanting him to know he wasn’t going anywhere.
To John it seemed as if time had slowed down as his eyes slipped closed, like the weight of the world simply fell upon them. His mind was plagued with Jim Moriarty, giving him images of each time he was tormented. John remembers every scar on his body from him and suddenly they burn under his clothing. His hands twitch with the need to itch at his scars, each one hidden carefully yet they were inflicted brutally without a care for mercy.
Sherlock smiles lightly, relieved nothing had happened while they slept. He searches around the sheets for his phone, finding it about half way down the bed with lots of messages from Mycroft. He ignores most of them simply being jabs and remarks but others on updates in the time he would finally get everything together.
"Well, yeah I think so. I'll have to talk to my producers, I'm still contracted for one more album but I'm sure they'll let it slide if I ask." John explains taking another chip from the box and putting it in his mouth before handing Sherlock one.
“Sleep, John.” The man says, his voice is deep and soothing with a slightly commanding tone. His voice is smooth when he says his name unlike when he first heard it, it was harsh and afraid. Now all that was contained and left the most calming presence that John couldn’t ignore. He found himself obeying as if trained to do what the voice told him and slowly his eyes fell shut and he was asleep once more.
Nothing else mattered, they were together again, just the two of them finally one in the same.
“Heartwarming.” A gleaming white smile said in the distance, echoing through the halls over and over.
John remembers with horrifying clarity as he watched the skin slowly be cut away and the blood seeping out. In that moment one second it looked like a deer and the next his mother, bleeding out under his hands. Jim Moriarty smiled sinisterly at him before continuing to strip the skin off completely. He saw it being his mother's own leg and not the stags, he remembers hearing her choke out his name from past the blood in her mouth. He screamed as Jim Moriarty dropped the stag and came up to him grinning madly covered in blood and holding the knife up threateningly. He was dragged by his arm to where the stag lay unmoving, he tried desperately to get away. He kicked and scratched and screamed but it did nothing as Jim was older and stronger. He was pushed down next to the bloody stag as the knife came to his hip as if to be skinned as well.
"What are you talking about?" John stops as well before he bumps into Sherlock. His expression softens slowly looking up into his sincere eyes.
There was no opposing player to Moriarty, only names to be scratched off a list. After he scratched off Rogers, Sherlocks was next.
John scooches forward putting his hands on Sherlock’s head tapping it gently with his small first. “Empty.” He proclaims sitting back to look Sherlock in the eye.
Long awaited, as always.
This is the point where Molly short circuits, she doesn’t move, speak or even blink for what must be over two minutes straight. She just sits there staring into -what feels like- Sherlock’s soul for a lifetime.
“Never mind that just get me the case.”
Sherlock's voice drifted into his ear and John glanced over at him as he continued walking, Sherlock kept pace with him floating gracefully beside him. He didn’t need to ask what he was referring to because he was in his head, he understood him perfectly.
“Close enough. And his -unfortunate- boyfriend, my brother Mycroft.” Sherlock says motioning again to Mycroft.
“I suppose he can. Doesn’t mean I have to like it.” John said much less complaining and accepting Mycroft could help Sherlock a bit more then they could. They sat for a while in silence both thinking of what is to come. “How did he save your life?” John asked quieter more subdued than before, sometime later. Greg just sighed.
That night the residents of Baker Street slept a little more soundly, a little more safely and much more importantly a little more happily. In the morning Mrs Hudson made pies and let them have them for breakfast before dashing off to their next case.
“Tomorrow morning.”
“Careful.” Sherlock chided as John tried to move away from him.
“That's what you are.” Mycroft sighed lightly.
“Let’s just talk about this is in the morning, okay?” Sherlock says wanting to do this with John he couldn’t figure out the words alone.
“Sherlock I can’t believe you! I finally meet someone and you scare her away!” John yells angrily. “Why? Why the hell do you feel the need to do this?”
They had been on a case and John was going to take it to get the glass fixed afterwards but ended up dropping it, breaking the chain and the outer shell. He was devastated as the watch had been in his family for years.
Sherlock shook his head, breathing heavily and fighting to stay conscious. Blood loss affecting his functions.
Officers arrived faster than John could comprehend and soon enough the area was filled with bright and flashing lights with the three of them trapped in the center. None of that mattered though, all that mattered was the detective. His raven haired detective.
He shook his head. “I’m sure they will only confirm it if that’s what you need.” John nodded and Mycroft turned to leave the room, the door clicked behind him.
Until he’s screaming in pain, Then dies in vain.’
"Sherlock! Shut up!" Molly practically screamed as Sherlock complains about being bored for the hundredth time. "Go bug someone else I have to study."
Sherlock had seen the pictures in John's file scanned over them briefly. He knew the second he saw her face.
Sherlock was sure that now he knew the weight of them even more than John did. It had been many years since John had even had them, he had asked once where they had gone. Sherlock hated to think of that day now, all it held was pain and he was determined not to fall any deeper into the levels of his mind.
“Three weeks.”
“I fancy a good one but I don’t think I’ll get it.” Mycroft replied as they started walking.
It terrified him to no end.
“Absolutely not.” Sherlock glared making his point clear. “If your really all that concerned about him then stay.”
"Thank you, I'm sure Molly will be delighted. We'll be there." Sherlock said calm and calculated in his expression. He was a rather good actor.
“Okay, what’s it for?” He asked, hesitantly.
"I love you as well, more than anything." After a few moments of kissing and hugging they collected themselves and John pulled Sherlock to his computer.
Time. Time was something Sherlock didn’t have much of but he needed to stall his inevitable homicide for John to get the police. He didn’t know either of their state but he hoped they were able to get the police.
“Not as bad.” Sherlock decides setting John down and replacing the jumper he was wearing for a smaller one he had found in one of the boxes of baby clothes John's mother made him keep, it was still a bit big not the right age for it yet but it worked better than anything else.
He complained about anything and everything constantly but after about a week and a half John was finally awake and there was no slowing him down. He actually ran to John's room when he heard the news, he wasn’t supposed to be walking let alone running but this time no one stopped him.
"The only someone else I could "bug” is John, and he's with that magazine fake boyfriend of yours discussing "business" or so he says." Sherlock grumbles fiddling with one of Molly's pens that she deemed a 'fancy pen' and was not to be touched. Sherlock didn't really care right now.
“I am. I’d die with you then spend another second in this house.” Jim said completely serious just wanting to be with him. “Please let me come with you.”
"It will." Sherlock assured as John typed in the rest.
out together all the time wasting money left and right, money we usually didn't have."
He would never tell John. He wouldn't figure it out anyway.
“We’ll leave this afternoon.” Sherlock said and went into their bedroom to get ready. Sherlock had apparently had all of John’s few possessions sent to the flat. How John had no idea but he was extremely thankful nonetheless.
“Well if we’re going to do this it is important but I’m just curious really, there are rumors and things you know.” John says sitting on the bed and pulling Sherlock to sit beside him.
Sherlock too, fell against the opposite wall feeling the rough texture of the paint and the ripples in the wall over years of use with his free hand. Clutching to his work with his other. He looked over to John seeing him looking to the floor with slightly glassy eyes.
“It’s incredible Sherlock. Thank you, really this is amazing.” John said in unbelievable awe of how he had done this without his knowledge. “It’s perfect.”
"We are both fine, Mycroft. Thank you for your concern." Sherlock ripped his hand from John's arm and helped him up.
Sherlock holds onto the bottom of the skull as John couldn’t get a proper grip around it. He crouched and sat John gently onto the floor and placed the skull in front of him for John to babble incoherently at and push around the floor.
“Happy Christmas, Sherlock.” John said in return with a small smile, clinking their glasses together lightly.
Too many layers. Sherlock thought as they breached the third level of their subjects' subconscious. He could feel John's presence the further they moved into it, pushing at his mind. Begging for attention, pressing into the corners of his space.
John nodded faintly before pulling himself up out of the chair wobbling slightly and out of the corner of his eye John thinks he sees Sherlock startle, as if he was going to rush to hold him up. John rubs his hands tiredly over his hurting eyes and turns to look behind him. He doesn't know where to go.
“Johnathan Watson is on in five minutes with apparently big news.” She said more subdued. This surprised Sherlock as he had a probably unhealthy obsession with the rising rockstar Johnathan Watson, he kept regular updates of anything to do with him. So it surprised him when Molly knew more about him then he did.
As they walk Sherlock glared at everyone and everything and pushing people out of the way and John apologized behind him as he got pulled along. Sherlock was furious with Moriarty how dared he to inject what very well might be poison into John to make him younger than he went as far as to track him like some kind of animal. Sherlock would be sure he'd die very slowly.
“Yeah cause I bought it. At least she went out and bought something for me you just dug around in the cupboards until you found this. I actually worked hard on finding your gift.”
Also Shelrock wanted to embarrass John in front of his aunt, which he most definitely would.
“We’ll do everything in our power to find him. I promise. Now please go back to get checked over at the ambulance.” The woman told him for the second time, urging him to go back and leave her to do her job in peace while attempting to be as nice as possible.
He wishes he could stay but Molly would throw a fit and John wanted to take it slow so sleeping in his bed with him without his permission probably wasn’t a good place to start. As much as he wanted to go slow and have that experience, another part of him just wanted to go as fast as they possibly could before they burned out and got tired of each other. Sherlock couldn’t tire of John but he wasn’t sure about John’s preferences, then again he knew he had a few trust issues so that probably wasn’t helping his thoughts on the matter.
John shakes his head fondly, so much had changed between them, their whole dynamic had shifted and yet nothing had happened. They were still friends, best friends that teased each other and would hang out and everything but maybe with a bit more kissing involved now. That he would look forward to.
"Stay here." Sherlock tells him before walking briskly down the hall and locking himself in the bedroom. John sits and waits impatiently fiddling with his fingers and looking down the hall Sherlock had disappeared down.
“If you’re still talking about the whiskey I’m going to strangle you.”
For a moment he couldn’t believe his eyes and for another he almost broke out into laughter, of course it was the only one he hadn’t checked so it was correct. Of course it was just on the day that John had left that he had finally gotten it right, of course this is how it happened. It would be just his luck that he got it right the day that John had left.
Sherlock looks to John confusion evident on his face. That seemed to be going around. “What?”
“So why wait? Are you really so bored as to sit here and wait for me to die?” Sherlock asked straight out, he wasn’t entirely sure why it mattered that he was asking. He was alone here, the police had checked the area before they had arrived, there wasn’t anyone coming for quite some time and Moriarty would make sure he didn’t make it out of this situation alive. Not that he thought he would be able to anyway.
“Was it a good idea to leave them together?” Mycroft asks as they walk to the line up they have set up.
“She would be thrilled but are you sure you want her to?” Sherlock asks skeptically going over their lyrics again wanting to make sure everything was perfect from his place sitting on the floor.
He had just gotten comfortable when he heard footsteps across the battered carpet they called a floor.
"You said you wanted to find someone. Who?" Sherlock asked.
When he wakes again it is early- in what he assumes to be -the next day and he is in a new room with more windows and a bigger bed and more furniture. The man is still there with him now on the other side of him, today he is sitting his legs pulled up onto his chair and eyes closed, his hand is still holding John’s. A constant presence that John hopes will stay for a long time.
“Wake him up? Yes I do think so.” Sherlock opened the door and pushed him in then closed it and walked off. Of course he wouldn’t stay the whole thing would be an emotional mess and he didn’t need that. So Sherlock took a walk while they did their thing he took the time to think in depth going into his mind while he walked aimlessly.
Their first case, circling the pink lady’s body slowly and picking apart the pieces of her murder. John’s eyes lit up as he displayed his deductions, the soft words of encouragement, the brightness in his eyes.
Stronger.
They packed the essentials in relative silence, only snippets of conversion shared to ask about what to pack or not. To make John feel a bit better he let him take the skull -Billy the Skull, according to John- with him as well, as he had become rather attached to it and Sherlock hoped maybe it would make him feel the slightest bit safer and less alone with him as his friend. He just wished that there was more that he could do.
James would deny it. He would fight and scream at his father for hours afterwards, receiving some nasty bruises for his disrespect towards him. He’d break the coffee table and curse the world, end up locked in his room and cut his hands trying to pick up the pieces of his mother’s shattered mirror that he’d broken in his anger.
"Maggie Dunn, lovely I know." Sherlock just hummed and continued picking at the wood. "So the women?"
“So you’ll help me then?” John asked excitedly laying on Sherlock’s bed.
He laid with John on the bed for hours just silently comforting him and holding him close. Even after John was quieted again he lay with him because there was no way he was going to be able to do this, he’d run out of time and had tried everything.
Each piece placed came with relief and warmth a feeling of completion as well as security that they wouldn't be moved again.
"Can we not, right now. As much as I'd love to catch up we're here on business." John replies starting to get annoyed.
“A little bit.” Sherlock says smiling slightly at the sight of John’s small figure atop of him. He places a hand gently on John’s back rubbing it lightly, soothingly.
John couldn’t answer, he could hardly formulate a thought past his fear and worry. He needed to get to Sherlock and find Greg, they needed to get out.
"I assume this means I'm forgiven?" Sherlock asked hopefully as they finished laughing and now we're just grinning at each other.
"It's to big for my finger." He laughed still crying and smiling Sherlock pulled away smiling as well.
John silently places his hand upon Sherlock’s head gently petting his curls. He doesn’t know what else to do. Sherlock to John seemed to be a strange man, he’s stoic and complaining about the hospital one second and then crying on his knees the next. John shouldn’t blame him much, as it was John’s fault for not remembering that made Sherlock cry.
“You make him happy as well. I saw you got Detective Inspector Lestrade to come back that was very nice of you Sherlock they do need each other.”
The next day Molly and Sherlock’s talk is forgotten or at least by Molly, Sherlock spends the whole day hoping she won’t bring it up and trying to get a moment alone with John.
“I don’t have to. You’ll come back yourself.”
Sherlock watched John’s eyes slowly drift close with his own partly closed ones. He told John to sleep and stared at the visible bandage on his forearm stretches against his skin, John was still unaware of the marks that were underneath. The marks of a needle plunged into his body as he struggled, Sherlock is almost happy he doesn’t remember it. Remember Him.
"You are smart, albeit rather slow." Sherlock says triumphantly then rushes down the stairs. John quickly puts on his shoes and follows after the brilliant idiot.
“I am. You can’t stop me.” Jim insisted and though he was afraid of his father he wasn’t staying any longer. He couldn’t.
John was so lost in his thoughts he didn’t realize that he was slowly burning the omelette he had on the stove.
"I do, in a way. Though probably not on the level that you are experiencing. At some point you need to do what is best for you, John. I think this is your chance." Shelrock advised walking beside him in the cold, avoiding snow banks as they could. Spending so much time outside John became more accustomed to the snow though he still refused to touch it or even go near it.
Sherlock laid on the sofa thinking idly how many ways he could kill Sebastian Moran. Hearing John open and close the bathroom door Sherlock went to his room to get clothes. He quickly changed in his bedroom and pulled John some clothes as well.
Mycroft nodded and left without another word, John didn’t expect him not to spy on him but he didn’t care. He’d rather have the illusion of being alone than none at all. He waited until he heard Mycroft’s footsteps go all the way down to the bottom floor of the flat building, until he heard the door to the building close and he knew that he was alone.
“Sherlock Holmes.” He took his hand and revealed in the feeling of guitar string callused and ink stained fingers. Sherlock let go reluctantly and liked to think that John did when it dragged on too long. The bell rang (do they still have bells in college?) and John cleared his throat and started walking backwards towards the exit.
“How did you get so good at this?” John asked as they pulled apart again, breathing becoming difficult, unfortunately. “No wait actually ignore that. Are you a virgin?” He asks curiously the question simply popping into his head.
"Now your sounding like Sherlock." She just laughed.
"-Would absolutely love to." He says with dramatized glee as he walks with her into the kitchen. When they're out of view John groaned and put his hands over his face as he slouches into the couch.
“Yes, I’m fine. I’m really sorry Sherlock I didn’t mean to, I swear I only looked away for a second and it just happened.” John rambled nervously, twisting the towel he had been using to waft out the fumes between his hands.
“Molly!” She kinda yelled and the few people that were there looked towards them. He waved them off and the sound continued in the room.
"No, still have to determine something." Sherlock helped lifting John up, then in a flourish started running down an alleyway. "Be back in a moment!" He called back. How he didn't trip is a miracle in itself.
“Seriously? Third day your here and already you have these things.”
“Oh yeah and what do have to ‘offer’ him huh?” She asked sitting up glaring at him, he turns to her and looks at her as if she were an idiot.
Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed! I will be late posting for the next week as I will be traveling by car to Texas and will not have much time to write, but I will do my best.
“Sherlock Holmes.” He answers walking over to the window to stare at the suddenly bleak city.
“I still can’t seem to find them, are you sure you don’t have them In your boxes Mrs Hudson?” Johns voice drifted from Sherlocks bedroom and he gravitated towards it like metal to a magnet.
“Just a good doctor is all.” He said distractedly then pulled his gaze up to his face to watch Anderson’s confused expression. “That’ll be all.” He places a hand on his shoulder as if for a friendly tap on the shoulder but as he walked off pulled out a cigarette and lighter discreetly then placing them in his own pocket. “Goodbye.”
Sherlock fell asleep with John's arms around him circled in warmth and security. He felt completely safe and calm for the first time in a while. He should have known not to trust it.
“If you don’t mind.” Sherlock said as he lay back on the bed lifting his hands together, palms pressed together, fingers at lips. “Somehow it’s easier. From where you left off on the phone.” The file thrown to the floor.
Sherlock gasped, his throat constricted as his lungs refused to take in air. He coughed unable to move any further, having only made it a few yards from his original place against the wall.
“This is going to be easy, okay? We’re just going to go upstairs and you’ll take a short nap than everything will be better.” Sherlock says assuringly rubbing Johns back as he shuffled closer to him clearly nervous.
“John.. not here..” Sherlock shook his head, stepping back once and John followed.
He slept with men, women and everything in between, hoping someone would help him to either get over Sherlock or even just be equal to the feeling he felt around him. No one even compared.
“Fine, tomorrow.” Lestrade said exasperatedly.
"-and the bridge by greenway. That's it." John reads from a list to Sherlock who puts pins on the map. "Can we go to bed now?"
"Completely brilliant."
Or what if John thinks he is faking nice around him just for the case? John has already shown concern that Sherlock will leave home after the thrill wears off and he can’t promise that he won’t. The feeling of uncertainty is terrifying and he wants to reassure John but he can’t. He feels like he wants to stay like he wants to be with John. Amazing John. Who has gone through so much but can still smile, laugh and be genuinely happy. Who makes Sherlock happy and want to be all sappy feelings and give hugs and cuddle for goodness sake.
"I believe it is a tracking device." Sherlock says carefully taking John's wrist and looking at the blinking.
“Is that where that ended up? I was cooking with Mrs Hudson at the time.”
“As soon as he's awake I’ll have him come see you. It may be some time Sherlock. His body needs time to recover; it may be at least a week.” Mycroft tried to tell him as gently as possible.
“See you later.” The resounding click rung in Sherlock’s ears as he lowered his phone to his lap. He felt like he was in shock, he had no idea and that wasn’t even the whole story. John’s family was gone, his own uncle beat him and he still didn’t know how he got his head injury.
The clicking of shoes stopping, as does the breathing and everything goes silent.
"No! No of course not. It's just, it's been so long I hardly expect to find her at all."
