“Stop being so fidgety then and prove it,” John said while he reluctantly let his hands be pushed away, ignoring the telling signs of Sherlock’s discomfort. It didn’t sit too well with him either that he was sending his newly acquired lover into the arms of another man, but for the sake of the cause, he was willing to swallow whatever jealous feelings that might plague him. Mycroft had assured him that it was a completely safe arrangement and John preferred this to sending Sherlock into actual danger without him by his side. Although, John had managed to acquire the menial part of playing waiter so he could make sure that nothing happened that wasn’t supposed to happen, because even if Sherlock was to appear as if he was offering sex, there would be no sexual activities between him and Magnussen.
“Do you really want to bring the police’s attention to your illegal service weapon? Not sure they’re going to side with you as readily as you might think. Accidents happen, triggers get pulled and it is awfully dark out here. Who’s to say who did what when there are no other witnesses around and no one to corroborate your story? That gun is more incriminating to you than it is to me.”
“I got the impression that he enjoyed himself as well. He has a rather rare combination of intelligence and looks. A very unusual specimen if I may say so.
John questions Mycroft over the fact that a man who seems more like an illusion than a real person has been allowed such a prominent position within the organisation, but Mycroft merely mutters that being untraceable and easily forgotten are good traits in this line of business.
Then there are endless feeds of the two of them sitting, lying or standing around silently, minding their own business, taking comfort in each other’s company but content to do so without words being spoken.
John realised that being bitten in the throat in comparison to the way Sherlock had been bitten in the hand was a huge difference and considering the semi-paralyzed state Sherlock had been in, there was a risk that Dr Roylott’s destiny was coming to an end much quicker if his airway stopped functioning properly. Also putting into the equation that blood was now flowing from three different locations on his body made it even more believable that Dr Roylott would not survive this ordeal.
He contemplated trying to turn and face his challenger but did not even manage to take half a step before a voice behind his back addressed him from the shadows.
John got the distinct feeling that Magnussen was suddenly trying to backpaddle out of any previous promises by suddenly turning vague and he had to remind himself to keep his temper while fearing that he had revealed too much and thereby blowing his only chance of getting Magnussen to arrange for a second meeting.
…” He hesitated as if contemplating whether he should continue, drawing out the suspense about something both of them in reality already knew.
“I know you think this is all fun and games having someone like Magnussen by a leach of his own bodily urges while you play him like violin, pretending to focus on finding the vault while in reality dragging this out so you can figure out the identity of that mystery guest you for some unfathomable reason think is more worthy of your interest than the blackmailing Magnussen is doing to innocent people in the meantime. The bane of my life is that I
This was straight forwards, and held all the pleasures of both doling out a well-deserved punishment to his very own insolent boy, as well as enjoying Sherlock's body once more, the way it was meant to be enjoyed, by him and only him and no other man, ever again.
“How droll.... Couldn’t you just for once take things a little seriously without acting like a child of five?”
Even if Sherlock had agreed to explain something to him, he had no idea what that something was or if he really wanted to hear it. Because Sherlock had also made it clear that he was still going to marry Victor Trevor and for John to think anything else had been nothing but foolish.
All he could really do was to continue to keep an eye on developments while trying to blend in and hope for the evening to be over soon enough.
John pretended to consider this, casting a glance at Mr Rudd who was still reading the paper, the comics if the look of amusement in his eyes was anything to go by.
Sherlock was quick to pick up on Mycroft’s temper though and as if by reflex, he reacted by grumpily jabbing at his older brother’s resolve, the way he had always managed to do, willingly or not.
“Well, they never stick around for long unfortunately. I have some hopes about this new one though, he showed signs of some very quick thinking at a very crucial moment. He was the one who called the ambulance and administered the adrenalin shot before Sherlock was taken to hospital. In all likelihood he saved my brother’s life.”
Magnussen who looked very relaxed in his chair, seemed undisturbed by the harshness of Dr Roylott’s tone.
Sure, Mycroft probably does his own share of snooping by watching some of the surveillance material himself, he is just that type of control freak to be unable to resist it from time to time, but the main bulk of it must be delegated to staff, Mycroft simply wouldn’t have the time to spare, busy man that he is.
John opened his mouth to stop him, because had he really alluded to John’s own sister when he had said “your own family background”?
“There is a bedroom at the back if you’re unwilling to return home. I can have someone bring you a sandwich, but other than that I can’t waste time caring for your needs when my focus should be on finding my brother.”
“I don’t confess to know the whole truth about what happened after I left the other night, you were gone when I returned and my brother hasn’t given me a satisfying explanation for your departure, but I’m assuming it had to do with the discovery of his drug abuse, your surprise when finding out was very telling, your displeasure even more so.”
Ever since leaving the Baker Street flat, the picture of Sherlock’s fate has presented itself more clearly with every additional detail presented to them and the threat of despair is tugging at every nerve-end of his being.
“There is no need for you to talk, Sherlock. I think I have had enough of your words actually. I think it might be time for you to simply listen instead.”
He wondered if Mycroft had known of his invitation in advance but if he had, he did not allow it to show on his features. Instead he remained stony-faced and simply nodded in John’s direction, offering a bland phrase of greeting before his attention was directed towards the empty plate in front of him.
Having said that she then turned her attention to her phone and John remembered how easily she was able to dismiss a person by focusing on something else, so instead of wasting his breath on someone who wouldn’t give him any proper answers anyway, he turned his head to look out the window for the remaining time of the ride, fretting over the scenario he was going to find once they reached their destination.
He bent over Sherlock and put his hand close to his mouth, startled to feel an almost normal breathing pattern. A quick check of his pulse confirmed the same. The man wasn’t dead....
“You can’t expect me to simply take the word of a man with your reputation at face value, Dr Roylott. Besides, having been forced to listen not only to you but to Mr Magnussen as well, discussing my brother in a very derogatory manner, I wouldn’t consider my own words too offensive in comparison.”
Mycroft suddenly lashed forward so his face ended up inches from Sherlock’s, his eyes fiery with anger.
All he remembers is the sound of water running from the taps in the bathroom while filling up the tub and then silence until Sherlock emerged almost a full hour later, dressed in one of his silky robes, curls wet, sending rivulets of dampness down his neck and throat, causing John’s own throat to constrict a little at the sight.
Normally Mycroft wasn’t a person breaking social codes by interrupting other people’s dinner parties and as he realised that Magnussen wasn’t alone, he felt like backtracking out of the room again, excusing himself.
As he still failed to see anyone, the tension gradually faded and for a second he contemplated the option that he had simply dreamt the whole thing.
His lips purses occasionally and twitches as well as he recollects certain moments like the argument about strychnine in the sugar bowl that had simply been labelled with the letter D as in “danger”, perfectly logical in Sherlock’s opinion but straight out preposterous not to mention alarming for someone about to pour a spoonful of it into his morning coffee.
He had been jealous of Magnussen from the very beginning and that was partly his own weakness that he had to deal with. But Sherlock had put that weakness under a lot of further pressure by doing things so far out of line that the initial, probably very unfounded feeling, had turned into something very real and that was all Sherlock’s own doing. Jealous or not, there was only so much John was willing to tolerate. Being drugged and lied to, was not in that category. If what Magnussen had insinuated about Sherlock’s behaviour recently was true as well, he didn’t know how to deal with that.
“I like it when you go all military, Dr Watson,” the voice smoothly purred, “It makes even the most badly behaved boys to heed your orders. And secretly I think you enjoy whipping out that army persona from time to time and bring us all into submission….. Just imagine the orders you’re probably dying to bark at me. I can actually feel your pulse beating like a hummingbird inside your chest right now, picking away at your resolve. Let me make it easier for …Ouch!”
John smiled and then he bent his head down again, this time taking the hard leaking cock in his mouth to suck teasingly at the tip before allowing it to go down his throat as far as his jaws allowed him to stretch them.
This day was no different and after having run his fingers through his damp sand-coloured hair he turned his back on the mirror and joined the rest of the men heading for work.
“Go in there and get undressed. Then prepare yourself for a lengthy lesson in obedience by presenting your arse to me to do as I wish with. When we are done you will be feeling the effects of my lecture for days, Sherlock.
Instead he resorted to use a method he actually had considered from the very beginning but still felt slightly hesitant about because once performed, it could possible put him in ever greater trouble than he already found himself to be in. But sometimes situations simply demanded unethical methods and as he had already made a mess of things rather spectacularly, he might just as well continue down that path and see where it led him.
At least John could still hear the sound of shallow rapid gasps coming from the parted lips and he sat down, leaning against one of the dumpsters with the young man’s head in his lap, cradling it with his fingers deeply burrowed in the sweat-soaked curls and waited for the ambulance crew to arrive and take the situation into their capable hands.
Slightly out of breath he made it back to the sofa, supressing a sudden bout of nausea before he arranged himself into a horizontal position once more. Alcohol and nothing to eat all day had not been such a good idea, but on the other hand, the wine had helped him numb his feelings at least a little bit.
But he had no interest in who those people truly were, they were of no interest at all, whereas Sherlock liked to play his “deduction games”, probing so deep it was practically vivisection when he opened his mouth and tore peoples hidden secrets apart. He wanted to reveal, when Mycroft wanted to hide, he thrived in secrecy while Sherlock wanted to expose. They never managed to understand the other’s point of view.
Foolish of him to think that Sherlock would ever change though. People like him didn’t change and why should they, as long as others around them catered to that behaviour without evoking consequences.
The wife had died in a train accident in Calcutta, the details were a bit hazy on the actual event and after her death there had officially been no one else.
“Sherlock has been....well, I guess abducted is the appropriate word even if he possibly went quite willingly and the abductor certainly won’t harm him. But what else would you call a scenario where someone lures another person away with the intent of not returning,
John turned to look at Victor who had slid down on the floor by now, his head buried in his hands while moaning something undistinguishable to himself. The gun was lying discarded next to him on the floor.
As the helicopter finally landed, close to the gates surrounding the ominous building that was Stoke Moran, Mycroft steeled himself for what was about to come.
What about Victor Trevor? What about the marriage? What about the drugs? The secrecy and the lies? What about the fact that Victor had threatened him with a loaded gun tonight?
And for the first time John wondered why the bloody hell he put up with any of this, why he had ever believed that Sherlock Holmes was someone who would reciprocate the love John felt for him, that they ever had a chance of becoming a couple when in reality John knew nothing about the man sprawled out in front of him on the sofa. He had no bloody idea who the person with the bleeding nose, the drugs problem, the lies and the razor-sharp tongue actually was.
How could he have been asleep in the first place, he didn’t even remember going to bed? Yet here he was, feeling more powerless than he usually felt when lying in here, caught by the element of a surprise and unable to grasp anything beyond the sense of danger surrounding him.
Straightening his back as he walked, he made the wow to stay the hell away from Sherlock Holmes from now on and not look back on that decision with any regrets. This had all been for the best anyway and in the sobering light of the morning he realised that he had been deluding himself for far too long.
How Sherlock had ever managed to stomach the company of this whiny idiot was beyond him, it said something about his brother’s adaptable patience, a part of Sherlock’s personality that Mycroft normally considered to be non-existent.
The moon was gone behind the clouds and it was difficult to make out Sherlock’s facial features properly, he looked more like a shadow with his dark clothes on, the hair blowing in the cold wind coming from behind their backs.
“Magnussen isn’t the type of person that is used to taking no for an answer. It’s easier for me to just change the number, that sort of message is far more effective. In the meantime...”
Sherlock softly pressed his lips to his mouth and John allowed happiness to wash over him as the kiss deepened and their bodies eagerly pressed against each other, hands tearing at garments and buttons coming undone.
After a silent moment where he just seemed to take in the whole situation, Sherlock then wiped his lips with his shirt sleeve and looked straight into John’s eyes, not an ounce of shame, regret or embarrassment visible in his features, which considering how he had just thrown up quite spectacularly on his brother in front of John, was rather impressive.
He remembered with a shudder how it was to grow up in a place where everyone had known everyone and to forever be given a part that was very difficult to shed, whether you wanted that particular part or not. He had headed for London the second it had been made an option for him and never really looked back.
But then he rises from his chair nonetheless, his feet a bit wobbly before he straightens his spine, draws a hand across his face and nods.
An old-fashioned lantern was the only source of light available but instead of offering some well-needed illumination it managed to make the place seem even spookier by causing long shadows to dance across the walls as well as the floor, creating the feel of a haunted house instead of a cosy old cottage.
John can tell though that the point has struck Mycroft as well, even if he likes to pretend that it is nothing out of the ordinary.
“What you do to me, Sherlock...” he gasped brokenly, his breathing heavy and his eyes glazed, “it’s going to be the death of me one day....”
Sherlock, not very surprisingly considering his fondness for research, proved to be a very curious and investigative lover and John felt himself rise to the challenge of meeting his need to try things out while enjoying the privilege of being the dominant one between them.
“We’re not done talking about this, Sherlock. When you and Dr Watson are finished, I expect you in my office with a good explanation of yesterday’s events. And do not even consider not showing up, you know I have methods of obtaining you if you defy my orders.”
“Are you always this antsy after sex or are you actually suffering from a guilty conscience like me? It would be highly understandable if you did, considering your engagement” he said and drew a tired hand through his hair.
“Spare whatever you’re about to say, I’m not interested. The last thing I remember is that he told me the Magnussen affair was over and done with. He has not indicated that he has any other cases going. In fact, I thought we were spending the evening together, just the two of us. Should have realised it wasn’t even remotely realistic.”
And yet, there it is, a bit skewed of course, because this is Mycroft after all and this can’t possibly be a recurrent look on his features ,but nonetheless, it’s there and it’s as close to panic as John has ever seen on a person so far removed from that feeling as is humanly possible.
Magnussen immediately turned to face the intruder and by the look of his wolfish smile when laying eyes on Sherlock, it was clear that he was pleased with what he saw. Despite it being the very reason for their attendance this evening, Mycroft couldn’t help but feel his stomach churn uncomfortably at the sight of it.
“I suppose I should offer my congratulations for your ability to turn the doctor to aid us in our cause, instead of leaving you to your own devices. That is a considerable advantage. For now, at least.”
Where had Sherlock gone if not to Magnussen? All his actions up to this point would have suggested that Magnussen was the main target and yet, he wasn’t here, and Magnussen clearly had no idea about his whereabouts.
He is a man who mainly deals in information, the delicate kind, the type that creates scandals, ruins people’s lives, forces those with high positions in society to resign.
“What? Spit it out!” John hissed and the fact that he dared to address his boss in such a manner spoke of how worried he truly was. When anxious, his adrenaline level always rose, and his tone of speech turned agitated. If Mycroft felt offended by John’s military way of barking orders, he didn’t allow it to show though. Instead he continued to look uncharacteristically miserable.
“Oh, I have a few ideas. Why don’t you come over here and sit on my lap and I’ll tell you all about it.”
“Fine. If you think I won’t succeed with this quite boring case you have thrown into my lap, then you can very well deal with it yourself. It’s not as if Magnussen is the most exciting criminal I ever encountered. In fact, it could be argued that he isn’t really a criminal at all, merely a media mogul with a morally corrupt way of conducting his business, and he is hardly the only one being attributed with that trait. The way you use the word
That idea felt strangely unnerving, despite knowing that it didn’t matter in the long run. He would not be around to see who grieved his disappearance or not, he would not be the one left behind forever wondering.
Imaginary-John came closer to his face and this time he could sense his own name being called out, but strangely subdued, as if being spoken under water.
The snake, after having buried its fangs into his hand, simply let go and slithered away, like a killer exiting a crime scene. It most probably didn’t leave the bed but as it was too dark to see, Sherlock couldn’t tell if it curled up close to his feet or somewhere else.
Sherlock seldom smiled, neither in real life nor on photos, he almost always looked very serious and when he did occasionally twitch his lips, it was in a gesture of sarcasm or insincerity.
“You tell me,” Magnussen was heard in the background. “What were your intentions for coming here tonight? Did Sherlock promise you to be a really good boy if you played along with his little scheme, trying to gain access to my home?”
They stared at each other for a few minutes in silence before Magnussen decided to be the one to talk first.
“This might not be my place to say, but as I’m resigning from my position, I’m going to take the opportunity to do so anyway.”
. Tell them that there is monetary profit to be had if they simply cooperate and answer some of our questions.”
“We reserved a seat for you here with your friends, Dr Watson,” Magnussen said and John did as he was told and sat down.
Mycroft noticed that Sherlock was laying it on pretty thick pretending to be a person still in search of a direction in life. Plenty of time on his hands and no goals in life. It was far from who Sherlock truly was, even if he seemingly didn't do much between cases, but apparently this personality trait appealed to Magnussen because he looked very amused.
“Victor calm down. There can be nothing constructive about blaming each other for Sherlock’s decisions. It was out of our hands all along.”
“Nothing important,” John murmured, slightly disappointed that he had failed to get a closer look, but realising that he would probably meet with the man soon enough anyway, or at least see a photo of him while visiting Sherlock.
But there was also another side of him now, the one that had perhaps spent the past couple of weeks considering a thing or two. The side of Sherlock who had had plenty of opportunity to think about actions and consequences, both while being tied up in a bed with a snake as his only companion, but also later, when safely bundled up under a hospital blanket with eons of time at his disposal to recount his recent decisions and the mistakes he had made.
“Take no personal offence, Dr Watson, I’m merely explaining my point of view. If you have nothing to hide there is no reason to become upset. Simply take my words as spoken by a man watchful of his possession. I’m not suggesting anything as long as there is no need for me to do so.”
He looked straight-out terrified and that wasn’t particularly comforting to witness either, but Sherlock assumed that his frightened mind projected his own fears onto the John of his imagination. It was only natural, he was scared himself after all, no wonder his hallucinations would be tainted by this overwhelming sensation.
“You have a lot of nerve sneaking up on me like this! Do you really think I would be stupid enough to fall for your tricks again after everything that’s happened? Or was this a joint collaboration between you and that deranged fiancé of yours? Has the world actually gone completely mad or why is it that everyone is running around in the middle of the night, behaving like lunatics? Who’s next? Is your brother perhaps going to jump out of a bush with a rapier?”
“Well, to begin with; there never was any issue with drugs. At least not to the extent that I made you believe. I never took anything on the night of Magnussen’s party.  It was all just a ruse created to trick him and subsequently you as well, as I needed for you to believe it, in an effort to fool Magnussen.
“Well, there is always that well-proven method where you simply ask a person about what you want to know, instead being all creepy about it, waving a gun....”
But then Mycroft finally spoke and if possible, he sounded even more disinterested than he had previously, as John recount of today’s events had made no impact on him whatsoever. Maybe they hadn’t, maybe he had only worried about insurance or the breach in security.
Mycroft really should hire better people, he thought, but luckily for him, such persons seemed rare to find.
“And is there cause for my concern?” he asked, the hint of a threat in his voice. That had unfortunately seldom worked on his friend before. Sherlock either found his army voice sexually enticing or, sometimes, a bit challenging. When it didn’t result in them ending up in bed together, it always seemed to make Sherlock even more set upon disobeying John further.
After a night of very little sleep John paced in front of the barrack, waiting for the car to pick him up and take him to his new patient.
In hindsight he had difficulty telling if that feeling had really occurred or if he had only felt it afterwards when dreaming about it, but in the end both the real John Watson as well as his subconscious self did not make that fatal decision but allowed the ridiculous figure on the bed to remain as he was.
“Purcell did indeed suddenly fall prey to his body failing him. It was most unfortunate. I will pass on your condolences to his wife when next seeing her.”
That he cared for his brother was after all one of the reasons that he was in this mess in the first place, however much he logically knew that it would have served himself better if he had allowed his brother to suffer the consequences of the situation on his own.
This time he allowed the lack of a response, it was enough pleasure to see the supressed anger in those fiery eyes, so he allowed the younger man to purse his lips into an indignant line, refusing to reply, even if such insolence normally would be met with a punishent.
Books everywhere, different types of magazines and stacks of paper, little knickknacks of strange items like a stuffed bat in a glass encasing, some sort of homemade chemistry set that felt like it should come with its own safety warning and then, to John’s disbelief, an actual human skull residing on what from the beginning must have been an uncluttered white shelf that now was barely visible beneath the mess that the occupant of the room had spread out on top of it.
At the beginning of the journey he had entertained the idea that the car might be headed for Appledore. Because even if the invitation had come from the other man, Magnussen clearly had his dirty fingers in this as well and as they were apparently going out of town, it could have been a plausible destination. A destination he would have actually appreciated as it would have presented him with the option to more easily assess the threat he was now being under, perhaps even managing to find that wretched vault that by now was beginning to feel like an elusive end game he no longer had any control of.
Because as gladly as he received what John gave him, just as readily he wanted to return the favour.
His curiosity about Sherlock’s true state of health combined with the rumours of a falling out with his doctor and possible lover would force Magnussen into action soon enough.
Well, if John was lucky and talented enough to know how to pry some information out of his patient, he might find out soon enough.
He also noticed the use of his professional title again, like these people wanted to make a point of telling him that they knew who he truly was, as if it had all been some deeply hidden secret up until now on his part.
“He became erratic and difficult; we had an argument and he stormed up to his room and locked the door. As he is prone to throwing antics, I decided to leave him to his own devices, thinking that he didn’t seem that affected by dizziness and nausea as he had earlier claimed. Instead I went to my own bedroom and prepared myself for going to bed but no more than 20 minutes went by before a loud crash was heard. I immediately rushed upstairs and there he was, splayed out unconscious on the floor, parts of his chemistry set in pieces around him. He was lucky that nothing was currently cooking in one of the vials or that the Bunsen burner wasn’t turned on. I carried him downstairs and laid him down on the sofa, told my assistant to go get you and here we are, two concerned parties and a drug addict suffering an overdose.”
One detail that did stand out though was that tests for sexually transmitted diseases were performed every couple of weeks and considering that Sherlock supposedly was engaged to be married it felt very unlikely that he would be carrying any STD’s with only one regular partner.
He was having enough bad feelings as it was without adding the sour taste of admitting Mycroft was right for bending the rules simply because he was powerful enough to do so. John hated people with that sort of authority but had to reluctantly agree that in this case it was a blessing.
“Exactly! The problem is that he is far too controlling about his things. He never was prone to sharing, even as a child. Every time he had a birthday, he never wanted anyone else to get a piece of the cake, he wants everything to himself, whatever the subject might be. He clearly suffers from both gluttony as well as greed.”
“Fine, Dr Watson. I’ll allow you until eleven o’clock tonight. My car will take you back and wait for you until you’re ready to meet with me again. For your sake I hope you’re not wasting my time.”
Irony has it that James Moriarty proved useful with his talent for keeping himself anonymous, making him perfect to use as inspiration when creating Sherlock’s imaginary kidnapper.
I fooled you by taking eyedrops to shrink the size of my pupils and a pill to slow down my heartrate, the rest was just theatrics.
After realising our family connection, he arranged to have our paths cross at an event to get a look at “what the fuss was all about”, as he later so eloquently put it. He liked what he saw and decided to put his own spin on the negotiation, without Victor’s knowledge.
Despite feeling confident that he now knew the reason for the man’s severe reaction, he also realised that time might be of essence as it depended on the gravity of the reaction if he was going to survive until the ambulance got here.
“Well, no. Telling his superiors about any of this was not an option we ever contemplated. Stealing plans of national importance is considered treason and will end you up behind bars for many years and that simply wasn’t an alternative for us. So instead, we came up with a plan of our own.”
The fact that Mycroft had remained at the house and the ambulance that supposedly came from a private clinic still had opted to use sirens to alert its arrival at such an early hour of the day, especially in the area where Mycroft lived that didn’t have a lot of disturbing traffic that needed to be told about an incoming emergency vehicle, made this whole situation sound very suspicious.
There was a sound to his left and suddenly light flooded from a door opening and the expected silhouette of Dr Roylott appeared on the threshold.
“Yes.” John indicated a briefcase he had snatched from one of his colleagues while he hadn’t been looking and that had to pose as the supposed proof Magnussen expected to see. Hopefully he wouldn't be forced to open it up as it didn't contain anything of what he had promised.
Carefully he dabbed his lips with a napkin, clearing his throat from any errant crumbs before answering, as neutrally as possible.
“True. But considering that Purcell’s suicide has officially been written off as a cardiac arrest and no move from us has been made towards Magnussen since it happened, he has no reason to suspect that I feel anything beyond my usual politeness for him. We are hardly well-acquainted, we know of each other and meet occasionally, that is all. There is no reason for him to think that anything has changed in that regard.”
Sherlock, with every menial little task that had to do with everything from housekeeping to laundry and keeping them at least remotely fed -  she definitely knew, had seen it from the very beginning.
“This isn’t something that is easy for me to admit!  I’m usually a very rational man who deals with matters of logic, not things to do with
There is a lot of fodder for sexual fantasies whenever Sherlock is the focus of the screen, all those small details that would drive John wild with desire occasionally, causing him to press his nails brutally into the soft flesh of his palms just to prevent himself from staring too obviously.
Mycroft was beginning to feel like he wanted to hide behind the palm of his hands but at least Magnussen did still seem intrigued by the nonsense Sherlock was spewing or at least by the show he was putting on regarding his physical assets.
“None of your business, stop trying to sway from answering my question,” Mycroft answered coldly, not willing to rise to the bait. But naturally Sherlock was not willing to let it go. In a contemplating manner he tilted his head to the side.
As he had poured himself as well as his guest a glass each, he seated himself comfortably in one of the armchairs opposite Victor who had planted himself in the other one and then Mycroft  delivered the very edited version he and Sherlock had agreed upon whenever asked about John’s resignation, quickly followed by the story of Sherlock’s newly developed but seemingly spiralling drug abuse. He made sure to put as little detail into both subjects as possible so there could be nothing for Victor to latch onto and create own conspiracies out of. He also made sure that one issue had nothing whatsoever to do with the other.
He didn’t hear the footsteps come up from behind, too lost in thought and when a voice spoke, his eyes blinked as if coming back to reality after a long time occupied inside head.
His head was dizzy on account of the wine and champagne he had consumed without eating particularly much to ease the impact of alcohol. He knew it had been a bad mistake but frankly he didn’t care anymore and as he rushed up the stairs he managed to snatch yet another glass from a startled waiter who passed him, downing it at once before he dropped the empty glass carelessly on the thick carpet.
With eager hands John spread Sherlock’s thighs apart and then lowered his head to swipe his tongue against the sensitive skin on the inside, ghosting his breath over the wet surface just to see goosebumps of pure pleasure break out, before he continued the journey with his tongue until he reached Sherlock’s testicles.
As Sherlock simultaneously felt relief flushing through his body at this realisation, he also succumbed to the embarrassment for even considering the other rather supernatural alternative he had first assumed. He sheepishly blamed the house and its spooky atmosphere and vowed to never tell about this childish scare to anyone, not even John, if he ever managed to get out of here.
Sherlock snorted at this and Mycroft threw him a warning glare, but Magnussen actually seemed amused by Sherlock’s brazenness. Or perhaps he was too occupied with looking into the younger man's eyes to really pay attention to what he was saying.
“I talked to Dr Watson myself and he was actually the one who told me about it. He didn’t give away any specific details, said I should talk to Mycroft or Sherlock instead and at first I wasn’t fully convinced that he was telling me the truth, you know how I have never really trusted that man....”
If he had been like everyone else, he would probably have settled here with a family of his own eventually. A spouse and a couple of children, perhaps even a cat.
And indeed, as time went by, he became a bit sloppy instead. Wrote the reports with minimal effort and soon omitted anything beyond the absolutely necessary.
Without a word Mycroft turns his back on him and moves away, heavily slumping down in what is officially John’s chair even if Mycroft probably considers it
Familiar because he was actually there in person so he knows the narrative already, but despite this fact he can’t help but wince at the overly dramatic tone his own person has opted for when he watches himself put on a show for Sherlock’s pathetic flatmate.
As the game was now seemingly over and all their carefully plotted plans in ruins, a thought hit him with even more determination than it had earlier and a decision was made. Because with nothing more to lose he was going to follow his initial instinct and do something he should have done when he first realised the significance of it.
But there was actually some comfort in the knowledge that no one would ever again look at that despicable picture. And the hiding place behind it, surely one of these men would realise the significance of that discovery and be able to open up that secret passage now that he had revealed its location?
“I believe I told Mycroft that I’m no longer willing to be your physician and I’m sure he informed you of it as well. So why are you here? If you think I will change my mind.....”
“That’s Sheebah,” Dr Roylott said from behind him, far closer than Sherlock first realised. He must have moved swiftly into the room and shortened the distance between them with quiet steps despite his large frame. “Her successor roams the park surrounding the house.”
Magnussen has been moving in the periphery of Mycroft’s world for years, prodding and poking at the people who run this country, usually with more than one finger in the game when a scandal is shocking the nation. That’s the kind of man that Charles Magnussen is.”
“Coming?” he said, turning his head forward again and smiled as he heard the sound of footsteps across the sand, swiftly approaching from behind.
Sherlock looked at him, eyes hard now, more similar to Mycroft than John had ever seen him before, and he felt the ice in his chest seep out into his system, veins running cold as the harshness of realisation hit him.
John hesitated, because it was really tempting to say yes and it would certainly be an improvement if he ended up landing that position at the research facility within a couple of months.
Sherlock held no illusions about being the only one Magnussen wanted to engage with sexually, and he could easily be replaced if the interest waned. But he suspected that Magnussen seldom was refused what he wanted and that the sort of sexual acts that turned the other man on wasn’t of the normal variety.
John might not yet have all the pieces in order but the picture beginning to form on account of these new discoveries is giving him a feeling of nausea and creepiness already and if he ever gets to see the end of this, he is certain that Mycroft Holmes will have transformed from sinister but impassive spectre to straight-out despicable villain.
There was the sound of snickering from Pemberton and Mycroft clenched his fists in anger. How dared they talk about his brother in such a manner? As if Sherlock would even look at any of them! At least Hawkes had a little more sense, as he wasn’t willing to join in on the laughter.
On the other hand he was not particularly eager to see Sherlock lock lips with someone else, to bear witness to the intimacy that they shared, making him feel like an intruder who lurked in the shadows just to steal a moment of passion from a person he had no business having it off with in the first place. It put his own position with Sherlock in a vulnerable place that he had no wish to be reminded of.
The added pleasure of having Sherlock under his thumb as well with his photos of him, ready to be whipped out in front of anyone he might care about, just doubled the fun.
When the murmur had silenced again glasses were raised, and Magnussen finished the whole speech by raising his own glass as well while declaring:
If John didn’t hate him with every fibre of his body, he would perhaps be able to empathize with the man’s plight, at least a little bit.
People had heard of him of course but few had actually met him in person and this temptation alone would prove irresistible for someone like Magnussen.
John felt something sharp and hard twist in his chest as he once more opened his eyes and the image vanished.
He knows that they are somewhere in the cellar of a nondescript building that Mycroft apparently uses as some sort of surveillance headquarters, most likely not in an official capacity since the surveillance has to do with his brother. Mycroft is as slippery as an eel and probably has other buildings as well that caters to his every need, workwise as well as practicing what he does in a more private capacity.
Magnussen, a known bachelor, infamous for his predilection for young good-looking men, was to be lured into a honey trap that consisted of Sherlock’s magnetic charms, making it easier to gain access to Magnussen’s private rooms and thereby increasing the chance of finding and destroying the vault.
“My brother is in very capable hands. Events taken place in this house tonight has understandably been a great shock to you and I suggest that you allow my driver to take you somewhere quiet where you can calm yourself down and get some well-deserved rest. We will all meet again soon enough.”
There was a pause and Magnussen looked at Mycroft, wondering what he was going to say about the obvious absence of Dr Watson. But Mycroft didn’t say anything about it, simply kept his features blank as he led the way to the familiar room where Magnussen had enjoyed so many pleasurable visits.
Could she be referring to Caruthers who was the one who had hired him? It seemed unlikely, because John had not seen so much as the shadow of that man since he had signed his contract, what could he possibly want all of a sudden?
“Remember how cocky you where earlier this evening? People like you who strut around gloating, more pride than actual sense between their ears. It’s always particularly enjoyable to take you lot down, because there is always a different tone by the end on the evening. Some of you even beg for mercy, in vain I might add, I can’t and won’t do anything to save you. “
Sherlock made a huge show of appearing to be the opposite of his older brother and put on a most disgusted expression at the suggestion that he would even consider folloing in Mycrroft's footsteps.
This needed to be postponed. John realised that he couldn’t strike up any deals tonight, he needed to get in contact with Mycroft who needed to tell Sherlock, or all of this would have been for nothing.
“Depending on what your willing to tell me, even an insignificant piece of information could be useful for a man in my position. I deal with men like Mycroft Holmes on a daily basis and the only way to ever get the upper hand on people like that is if you have some sort of leverage over them, otherwise this country is built like a highly exclusive boys club where anyone from the outside has no chance of ever being invited to sit at their table. And from what I gathered over the phone, you’re not a fan of the Holmes brother’s anymore, so what difference would it make to you why I want your information?”
Not that Victor would be deterred from his amorous pursuits by any of this, he was far too stubborn to let something like drugs get in the way of achieving what he wanted.
He will have to keep the charade going for at least a couple of months yet, but the investigation will gradually diminish until it one day will be turned into a cold case, forever hidden in the archives where no one but John and Mycroft will know of its existence.
Sherlock could hear the other man follow him from behind as he stepped into what appeared to be a salon, more Victorian era than modern day, with heavy furniture and gilded frames around outdated paintings, some very intricate dark tapestry and the light coming mostly from a roaring fireplace and an actual oil lamp.
“Very well, we won’t be doing it in Mycroft’s room again. At least not this particular room. There are plenty of other places where we could be quite inventive.”
“The drug thing was never a serious issue, it was something I did to alleviate my boredom as well as numbing my pain. I’m not a true addict,” Sherlock scoffed and actually had the gall to sound haughty about it.
“To the beautiful Sherlock Holmes who looks particularly delicious tonight, what could possibly be the cause for that becoming flush on your cheeks? Is it perhaps the knowledge of the amount of people around this table that would want a piece of your delectable assets or is it perhaps the presence of that very special someone that sets your heart racing?”
Sherlock had talked very little about Magnussen’s visits to his bedchamber, never going into any specific details, but he had mentioned that Mycroft’s security cameras always monitored them in case Magnussen would slip up and say something they could use against him.
The fingers trailed up and down the arm, then continuing down across the chest and then up again to his shoulders.
“Fine, get on with it then. I got nothing better to do apparently. Like focusing on regaining my strength and recuperating for example. But no, big brother is about to throw a tantrum and needs must it seems.  So do your best Mycroft, unleash all that pent-up anger you’re holding up inside, I’m perfectly ready for the onslaught.”
“Oh just put in the usual nonsense about my deplorable eating habits and the smoking, he loves to read about that, makes him feel entitled to nag about it afterwards. “
John gritted his teeth but made no effort to correct him. To do so would imply that Magnussen’s small jabs got to him and he wasn’t going to give the man the pleasure. Besides, it didn’t matter what name Roylott knew him by, John just wanted to get this over and done with.
The hand holding the gun pressed it further into his back though, clearly having ideas not coinciding with his own at all.
All those feelings he had experienced that night, the shock, the hurt, the anger, the heartache, it had all been for nothing. Injecting the Narcan, Sherlock throwing up all over the place, their harsh words launched against one another and his own angry exit. It had all just been a part of a grander scheme that he had no idea was taking place straight under his own nose. It was quite humiliating to consider that he had been played so easily. He was a bloody doctor for God’s sake, he should have been able to tell!
As he had put the shore behind him, he almost expected to see the shadowy figure to be back, standing on the lawn, illuminated by the moonlight, gun once more aimed at his approaching body. But to his relief, no one was there.
A glimmer of hope ignited in the other man’s eyes and Mycroft made sure to quench it immediately by sticking to the reality as he saw it. No use letting anyone cling to any false pretences of hope when the situation spoke differently. So he continued before John had the opportunity to say anything.
Not long after his departure, John decided to leave as well, before being forced to join the rest of the staff with cleaning duties.
They had never indulged in any powerplay in the bedroom before and he hadn’t really known that such things would be of any interest to Sherlock. But as he now visualised one of them being in charged of the other, preferably him spanking that lovely bottom of Sherlock’s, he felt a jolt of excitement running through him at the idea.
Once he got started the words just kept spewing out of his mouth, almost out of his own control and most likely due to the alcohol, but at the same time it felt liberating to vent what he had been keeping bottled up during the whole evening.
“...the police are out there looking of course, as well as our own men. He won’t manage to get far...”
“No, I imagine he wouldn’t be very pleased hearing about that. Any suggestions then? I didn’t do my job today after all, merely a feeble attempt at listening through my stethoscope. Not sure I was able to hear a bloody thing with you performing that striptease act.”
It suited Mycroft just fine if Sherlock remained quiet for a little while. He had plenty of other things to occupy his mind with.
“Don’t bother, as there is really no need to. I know what I’m doing. You see, behind every powerful man, there is someone infinitely more cleaver who knows exactly what buttons to push to yield the desirable result.”
“Yes, yes, we had this conversation already. In fact, it feels like ever since we began looking for that mysterious vault, we have been doing nothing more than move in circles around the same subjects over and over again. I’m happily washing my hands of this whole mess and leaving you to deal with it on your own!”
He heard Mycroft talk in the background, and he did his best to mute the voice inside of him who continued to accuse him of his carelessness and try to concentrate on what was happening in the room instead. There would be plenty of time for regrets later, whatever the outcome of this situation would be.
Because what he had seen was actually the face of a full-grown baboon, clinging to the windowpane outside, apparently engaged in the scene taking place inside the room and baring its fangs at the perceived hostile situation it saw on the other side of the glass window.
Victor seemed completely oblivious to the growing tension emanating from the man in front of him and continued talking in that airy way that made it seem like he was discussing something completely inconsequential and far beyond John’s grasp of knowledge.
He had read the book as a child and it surprised him that he still remembered it, usually childhood reminiscences were not something he indulged in or made the space for in his neatly ordered brain capacity.
As predicted, the Danish media man immediately seemed to realise who they were going to pick up, as Mycroft shrewdly had counted on, but to his immense disappointment Magnussen didn’t say anything to indicate that he wasn’t prepared to share a car with his supposed rival.
Another pause and Magnussen closed his eyes where he was seated, waiting for the useless prattle to stop and the point of this phone call to be revealed.
This man was a cold-blooded killer, far worse than any of the animals he kept, and he had managed to fly under the radar with his deeds for who knew how long.
Quickly the man opened the briefcase and to John’s utter bewilderment he picked up a large jar with a wasp inside it, angrily buzzing against the glass confinement.
This caused John’s hackles to immediately rise and without thinking he stopped and put his hands around Sherlock’s arms to stop him moving for a second so he could take a closer look at his face.
Did Sherlock really think that he had the right to act the victim here after all the lies and manipulations he had pulled off? After tonight’s revelations of his deplorable drug abuse?
This new behaviour is strange beyond comprehension and John can’t for the life of him figure it out.
As he crashed into bed, the last thing his tired mind remembered was the image of Sherlock perched on top of that crate, with his legs crossed, his elegant hands moving as he spoke and his eyes sparkling with excitement.
“Well. A modified form of tranquilising darts, far quicker in effect than usual, putting the victim in immediate sedation, leaving a minimal punctuation wound. Trevor aimed at their heads, with the intent to kill them, so the tiny darts most likely got lost in the tresses of their hair. Sherlock’s in particular would have been difficult to locate. I have been telling him to get a haircut, but you know how it is with siblings, do they ever deign to listen?”
He didn’t trust the man one bit, he wasn’t even convinced Magnussen wasn’t in on this whole escapade somehow, maybe he and this Dr Roylott character were cooperating somehow.
But in essence, John was everything he had ever wanted and even the idea of not having him by his side anymore was unthinkable, making his stomach tighten nervously when he considered that this situation somehow could result in John leaving him. There were so many "ifs" and "should-haves" he normally never bothered with but now suddenly meant a difference as they could ensure that he would end up alone, without John’s love and affection, something that he, like an addict, actually craved nowadays.
Mycroft had for a second considered casting himself in a different role while tampering with Sherlock’s memory, so the unsatisfactory need of watching him through cameras to get his desired fill could turn into a more physical arrangement. It has always bothered him that their relationship is so fraught with resentment and bitterness. But despite greedily considering that option from every angle, he had settled for not risking it after all.
It was difficult to say what kind of person Victor had been back then as John only knew him as he was now, but it was plausible that Sherlock had been blind to certain aspects of Victor’s personality on account of the happiness he had experienced and he must have done his very best to please his new-found friend by turning himself inside out in every effort to make him stay, never realising that it was the wrong thing to do.
“Tell me, Dr Watson, what method did he use to persuade you into going along with his plan?  I didn’t believe for a second that you would be amenable to sell him out, so strictly speaking I knew you were wasting my time. But this, your face right now, that is priceless! It was even worth the hassle of using my driver to take you on that pointless ride back and forth for nothing.”
Sherlock began to roll his eyes at this, clearly trying to break free from the hold John was trying to have of the situation, but he was immediately met with a swift stroke across his fingers with the riding crop and a surprised yelp escaped his lips as his eyes widened.
Mycroft had been forced to make the call to this person even if it had irked him to do so. But everyone concerned needed to be informed of the newest development.
It had taken him a significant amount of time to guess what Mycroft Holmes’s pressure point was, as he, very much like Magnussen himself, was one of those men who seemed like a blank piece of paper even upon a closer inspection. If not for Victor Trevor, it could have taken even longer before finding out was his weakness was.
Sherlock had done far sillier things in his line of work than battering his eyelashes and flirt with someone to achieve what he wanted. Why this was now suddenly a problem was quite baffling.
“I wouldn’t know as I'm not interested in pursuing a career as a chemist,” Sherlock said when he had swallowed the canapé.
“I don’t know, I woke up from the sound of it arriving. But I guess it must have been the older brother. Possibly his P.A, she was there when I came down. She is usually around when things happen. She was also at the house that time when Dr Watson walked out in the middle of the night, don’t know how she always manages to be around, I have never seen her occupying one of the guest rooms and she certainly isn’t sleeping in the same bed as her employer....”
Mycroft led a very sedentary life, Sherlock always claimed he was the laziest man in London and perhaps, in this type of situation, he would only become hindrance?
“Yeah, about that. What the hell happened? I heard gunshots and then…Well, when I examined the bodies, they were asleep!”
Mycroft didn’t reply and with a sigh John decided to let it go for now and focus on the other questions he had.
He still needed Magnussen’s helicopter to get him home but right now it was very tempting to just walk instead of spending another second with these pricks.
What kind of game was Sherlock playing? Was he being a tease on purpose or was there something else going on here?
He thinks once more about Sherlock soaking in the bathtub, this time with the insight that if there actually was a camera installed in there, whoever was watching must have been given quite a sight.
Magnussen’s nightly visits will stop after the wedding, so there is always that to look forward as well.”
He had no idea where Victor lived, where he might have stowed away the weapon or how he was going to get it back without ending up on the wrong side of the barrel once more, so for now he had been forced to accept that his weapon was temporarily gone.
Heated arguments with Sherlock, botched-up dates, awkward snogging on the sofa with the few women he managed to lure up the seventeen steps to the flat, hot-tempered and very painful discussions with Harry over the phone, lazy Sundays lounging half-naked in his chair watching crap telly, sneaking a look at Sherlock’s undressed form whenever given the opportunity, every bloody fart, bum-scratch or burp he ever let out while believing he was alone and unobserved!
Another pause, this time even longer. Sherlock had turned his face away from John, his face mostly obscured but his profile still visible as he stood staring out into the darkness, chewing on his bottom lip like a child contemplating what his options were. Then a deep sigh was heard, and he turned his head to face John again.
“But then after all, there doesn’t need to be more than just a little bit of bad luck for things to go catastrophically wrong. As I’m sure your former patient could attest to, if you were still on speaking terms. Ready to turn his life into hell, Dr Watson?”
So, Sherlock had not attended lunch then. Could it mean he was so annoyed with Mycroft that he had decided to skip their little plan all together or was there something else behind his absence?
Some naked skin on a hot bloke was not going to divert him from his duties. He had been around good-looking muscly men in the army enough times to not allow himself to be easily distracted.
“Fine, I’ll accept your terms.” he heard himself say and a hint of satisfaction crossed Mycroft’s features for a second, probably the most sincere emotion he had displayed during their entire meeting. John couldn’t help but feel his stomach churn at the sight of it, as if he had somehow walked straight into a trap without realising it. What that trap consisted of remained unclear though.
With Mycroft’s decidedly dashing younger brother as bait, they were going to gain access to Magnussen’s private chambers, find the source of all his knowledge and power in the form of a vault he supposedly had in his home, a vault where he kept everything incriminating that he had on other people to use as blackmail against them. And when finding this vault, they were going to destroy it.
John felt himself caught for a second, unable to come up with a plausible explanation for knowing that little tidbit without revealing that he knew Sherlock far more intimately  than Mycroft had any idea of.
The younger man was splayed out across a large black table in the dining room, his paleness accentuating against the black smooth surface behind him and John couldn’t get enough of the sight of his lover ready and wanting, impatiently waiting for John to claim his body.
After knocking on the door, a butler let him inside the house, showed him upstairs and then into a room that he immediately recognised because of the one item that had caught his eye the last time he had been here.
Even when Mycroft has expressed a sense of worry and concern in the past it has never been accompanied by anything more than a bland expression occasionally complemented by a furrowed brow or some eyebrows raised in slight disapproval.
It had frankly sounded like an excuse to go mudlarking during a time of the day when John much preferred the comfort and warmth of his own home, a microwaved ready to eat-Tikka Masala and the latest episode of “Taskmaster” on the telly.
“You’ve done well, Dr Watson. You have far exceeded my expectations by finding what we were looking for. You saved us all a lot of time and effort.”
“Well, I met with Mycroft. We had a little lesson in clarification regarding who’s controlling who. He started talking about archaic punishment methods, like spanking. I informed him that with the right person, a little spanking could actually be quite exciting. I think my point came across quite well.”
It had been a close call, too close for comfort, and John had done his best to push that thought away despite unable to fully ban it from memory. Sights like this, with Sherlock back to his old self again, still slightly sleepy but decidedly alive did help. It helped chase away the images of his pale face and lifeless body that John still had etched on his mind.
Sherlock tilted his head to the side, looking at the disfigured poker, then he turned his eyes to face Doctor Roylott again.
He took a few steps forward, turning his head to check in each direction, his skin prickling from the chill in the air while his eyes scanned the area carefully.
It had been a surprisingly warm spring that year, hence the rolled-up shirtsleeves on Sherlock. Sherlock always lived in that Belstaff coat of his when out and about, his armour of sorts, he knew he cut a good silhouette in it. But this particular day the weather had been unusually hot, piercing rays of sunshine through that window behind their backs in the photo.
“Not that I know of, Sir. As I said, Mr Holmes went straight to his office and locked himself up in there, haven’t seen him since the ambulance took off.”
“I believe you had some questions for me. Why don’t you start by asking those and then we’ll see if what I have is what you are after?”
As Mycroft swallowed down yet another piece of the food on offer, this time a bruschetta with cream cheese, asparagus and crab fish, reaching for a glass of sparkling wine to wash it down with, he felt himself being watched and as he turned his head he was met by the calmly amused smile of Charles Magnussen who was standing a few feet away, glass in his hand and assessment in the cold dead-eyed stare.
John didn’t reply, because what could he say without revealing that he and Sherlock had engaged in a far more intimate relationship than what usually existed between a doctor and his patient.
“I’m sorry to hear that you have taken a page out of Mycroft’s book and decided that I’m not successful at what I do. Just because I don’t do everything my brother tells me to do, it doesn’t mean that I don’t know what I’m doing. In fact, I’m pretty sure that an invitation to Appledore is very imminent and I hardly need to tell you, Mycroft, that such an invitation increases my chances of finding that vault of yours considerably.”
Their eyes locked in silence again, Victor still looking confident and superior while John was beginning to wonder what this visit was actually all about.
worry about you, my life would have been infinitely easier if that had not been the case. As it is a part of my character entirely out of my own control, and you apparently can’t stop doing stupid things on a regular basis, I guess that situation is never going to change. But for once in your irresponsible life, can you just listen to me, Sherlock? Stop whatever it is you think you’re going to accomplish by taunting Magnussen the way you are doing, because it will backfire eventually. Perhaps not immediately, perhaps you manage to balance this act for a little while longer, lying to John while resuming to lead Magnussen on, but mark my words, it will happen, and by continuing down this path you risk losing more than what you bargained for in the first place.”
Magnussen raised his eyebrows in mock surprise, that infuriating smile still playing on his lips. He looked very smug and it grated immensely on Mycroft’s nerves.
And if John Watson was sleeping this heavily while his brother had gone off on his own, it smelled like a setup, fitting very well with the cunning nature of his brother.
Magnussen had a flat close to Pall Mall and then a larger house outside of London called Appledore, but it seemed unlikely that they had gone there after last night’s events. John calculated that even if they had stayed at the banquet until the very last hour, Pall Mall wasn’t far off and they must have spent a substantial time together already.
“I think we need to spend a little time talking about facts now, Sherlock. As a man of logic I always thought you would prefer that angle instead of wasting time in la la land, but on the other hand, considering what a drama queen you are, I guess I shouldn’t be surprised that you prefer your own fabricated fantasy world to the dreary one the rest of us have to put up with.”
“Not exactly. There was some disagreement and he is no longer in our employment. I ‘m currently in search of a new physician to take his place.”
“Oh, I’m available, Mr Holmes. It all depends on who asks for my attention. Your card allowed you entry to see me, others might not have been as lucky.”
The issue of the photographic evidence Magnussen held over Sherlock’s head would have to be dealt with of course, but it would at least not be
In a way, the same could be said of Magnussen. Not known to the general public but with his hands in most of the outlets that people’s lives consisted of, controlling a large part of media, from petty gossip to actual news, he was a force to be reckoned with. It was natural that two men of such importance should know of each other, they had done so for years. But for things to change the way it had done lately, was an unwelcome development in Mycroft’s eyes.
. Naturally I will do everything in my power to retrieve him. But I’m not ignorant of the circumstances and neither should you be. Whatever criminal foes you two have previously encountered, this is a whole new level of expertise and it would be unwise of me not to inform you of this.”
A part of him still loved him for some unfathomable reason and those feelings didn’t just fade despite Sherlock’s horrible behaviour. They had shared some really intimate not to mention passionate moments, the best John had ever experienced and it wasn’t easy to forget those when evening came and it was time to go to bed and he was left lying awake in his bed, staring out into the darkness with his head swarming with memories.
You can just image our shock when we heard this and realised who it was that had put Magnussen in our path. A man I had a long time ago stopped thinking about, someone so deeply buried in my past that I had difficulty believing the news when Mycroft told me of it afterwards. Initially I even thought it was all just a really bad joke.
“I assume I will need to be prepared to face Magnussen soon enough myself, perhaps even tonight. He will most likely want to see me with his own eyes if he is going to believe what you and John are telling him regarding my ailing health. He won’t be as easily dismissed as Victor.”
“And why would he want that? Did something happen between you last night? Does he somehow think that you are available to pursue?”
Thinking back on his recent failure, he still felt curious about those glasses of Magnussen’s, how did they work exactly? Were they essential to his blackmailing business? Were they one of a kind?
Languidly reclining in a brown leather armchair, legs crossed, hands on armrests, staring straight into the camera, features severe and eyes dark, almost hooded beneath those long lashes.
To make matters worse, Magnussen was clearly sensing his discomfort and did nothing to lessen his embarrassment by breaking the silence that had surfaced between them now that the others were gone. He merely sat at the high end of the table, a small smile on his lips, the cold eyes glittering behind his glances as if infinitely amused.
The rest of the house was almost as anonymous as what he had seen last night and as Sherlock seemed to be so frank when he talked, John decided to be the same way by mentioning the observation he had made regarding the lack of interior details in the house.
He scolded himself for having been so naïve, for having failed to keep his feelings in check, allowed himself to fall under Sherlock’s spell so thoroughly that he had willingly ignored the potential heartbreak this was going to end in for him.
But Magnussen was a different opponent than what Mycroft was used to going up against, and if there ever was a man that had the potential to succeed, it would be Magnussen.
Just as true panic was about to set in, a recognizable scent hit his nostrils, a scent he had felt many times over the past couple of months, one he had inhaled with great enthusiasm every single time and a deep soft voice was heard whispering close to his ear as the arm around his waist ran softly along the vertebrae towards his neck.
“I’ll see you around, John. Maybe a night at the pub soon? Catch up on how things are going for you? The wife’s off to her parents shortly, so I have no one demanding my presence at the dinner table.”
“I received a call this morning informing me that my brother had gone missing. Not completely unusual, as you very well know, so even if it annoyed me, I wasn’t particularly worried at first. The people in charge were not very forthcoming about details but it was implied that some time had passed between his disappearance and them reporting about it to me, a clear sign that they were accustomed to him disappearing off the radar occasionally as well. In an effort to get to the bottom of this, I reached out to the head of surveillance, Mr Jeremy Marcus, to suss out the situation, knowing that if anyone would have some answers, it would be him. But despite many efforts to reach him, no one was able to, and forty minutes after the initial phone call, I received another one, informing me that Mr Marcus was missing as well.”
A small smile spread across the other man’s features, but instead of improving a rather gaunt face it just made him look even more disconcerting with that grin, showing a small glimmer of teeth between very thin lips.
Sherlock had experienced difficulty sitting down for a whole week afterwards, large angry welts covering his buttocks as well as the lower part of his back.
A physical fight between them would be short, he realised that. Dr Roylott was much bigger and stronger in every sense of the meaning and despite the gun, John would easily be overpowered if they ended up in a scuffle.
was somehow responsible for this mess when in reality Sherlock had done his very best to go behind his back the whole time.
“Do you date, Dr Watson?” she said, a quick glance thrown at his left hand, probably checking for a ring in the least discreet manner possible.
The answers he had wanted earlier were suddenly no longer important because it no longer mattered, these people could have each other as far as he was concerned and good riddance to them!
John realised that if he had been summoned here without being prepared in advance, this conversation would by now have gone in a completely different direction, most likely he would not have made the trip here in the first place.
Confused about what to do, he turned back to Sherlock and grabbed his shoulders, as if to  rouse him out of whatever state he was currently suffering from, when the whole room suddenly exploded with activity.
But even if Sherlock was rather thin indeed, the hint of his ribcage actually visible when he stretched out, John could not find any cause for concern.
The other tactic had been to pick a fight, hopefully driving John from the flat out of pure annoyance, but it had failed as well. Too content after the sex they had engaged in, John was possible more tolerant to every annoying effort Sherlock attempted in order to get him to storm out, and eventually Sherlock himself tired of his own game and gave up.
Leaning back in his seat on the tube, travelling back to Baker Street, he couldn’t help but feel a sense of giddiness about this latest move. As far as results went, he was not in any way closer to finding the vault or the identity of the mysterious guest. But this had showed Magnussen what sort of person he was, and the man had been more than intrigued, the bait taken and swallowed, want practically glowing in his eyes at the sight he had been presented with.
“Yes, you indeed never seem to be hungry these says. Not that you ever were very interested in food but this is getting downright ridiculous. Makes me wonder what that doctor of yours is doing if he can’t see that your wasting away.”
Magnussen wasn’t a real issue of his, but Dr Roylott was a business associate to the man after all, Sherlock’s disappearance was bound to be discussed between them at some point.
His performance goes against the personality traits John has been presented with from him before and instead of coming off convincingly it confuses the doctor more than anything else.
He had never  quite settled here, and he didn’t spend much time in the house, preferring the home he had in the city. But this was the ancestral pile of bricks after all, it needed to be looked after occasionally and as he was the only one willing to take that responsibility, he made the effort to visit the place every now and then.
So instead he barges upstairs, packs a duffel bag with some fresh clothes and his computer as well as a toothbrush and his gun. By now, if he ever manages to catch that bastard Jeremy Marcus, John won’t be averse to putting a bullet between his eyes if it comes to it, he feels at the end of his wits and the uncertainty of Sherlock’s fate has been eating away at his resolve. He weighs the gun in his hand before packing it and then leaves again, managing to avoid Mrs Hudson and her endless questions.
He wasn’t sure if bringing a weapon was a particularly good idea, especially considering that John was going to spend some time in the company of Magnussen, who was carrying an envelope of suggestive pictures of Sherlock inside his pocket, ready to be whipped out at any inopportune moment. There could be blood shed before they had even left the city.
Shortly before eight a black car with tinted windows showed up outside the facility gates to take him all the way to London. He still had no idea who the host of the party was or where the event was being held, but as he seated himself in the backseat he noticed that there was a partition raised between him and the driver so he decided that there was no use asking any questions in advance, he would just have to sit back and see where the journey would take him.
He could hear someone answer his call just as the unexpected explosion of a gunshot reverberated through the silence and John froze in his place, cold dread running down his spine as the familiar sound hit him with the same impact as if the shot had actually hit his own body and the phone slid out of his hand, softly landing on the thick carpet while the person on the receiving end called out his name.
While Mycroft made himself comfortable, straightening his trousers from any imaginable creases, John came to life on the sofa and sat up, blinking like an owl while trying to take in the situation more properly.
His eyes were sharp and rather cold when he penetrated John with them, and they were possibly the most distinguishable feature in his appearance. Even if he wore what looked like bespoke clothes in the form of a dove grey three-piece suit, it seemed as if he had put in the effort to look anonymous, just like the house around him, and once again John was  hit with the idea that someone wanted it all to be forgettable for some reason.
After his nightly excursion with John Watson, the true plotting had finally begun, and things had already been set in motion. And once again Victor had been the one to provide the help just when they needed it.
Another hand reached out to take a hold of his hair and as his teeth accidentally scraped the finger he was sucking, a forceful yank made him slow down his pace. He supressed whatever instinct he had of burying his teeth deep into the flesh and bone while the grip around his curls relaxed once more.
It wasn’t his fault that Sherlock was a manipulate, lying, deceitful bastard with a brother who didn’t care how miserable he was and a fiancé who was pathologically possessive of his every move. It wasn’t his fault that no one wanted to listen to his misgivings about the wedding and it certainly wasn’t his fault that Sherlock was now using drugs again.
John clenched his teeth as he got into the car, ignoring the presence next to him. Stoically he stared out the window during the whole ride and once the car had stopped, he was the first to get out.
Torn branches and trampled grass in the area indicated that he had tried to outrun the cheetah and probably believed he would make it.
He walked over to Sherlock who seemed perfectly nailed to the floor, watching John as he stepped up to him until the distance between them was well within personal boundaries.
As he turned around, he found Sherlock standing just behind him, so close John could feel the heat emanating from his body. There was a glint of excitement in his eyes.
If the ambulance had arrived early in the morning and the two of them had separated from the cottage well past midnight, there could hardly have been many hours of sleep. But knowing Sherlock’s deplorable eating-and sleeping habits, that was hardly surprising.
Despite John’s promises to stay in the background and let things take their course, Mycroft wasn’t completely confident that John would be able to stand silently by and see his lover being pawed over, it still remained to be seen if he could handle it for one evening.
“You know, you have a spectacular way of making a person feel even more of an idiot than they did to begin with.”
He has his phone with the manipulated file in his pocket as well as the gun tucked inside his jacket and he is determined to get some proper answers this time. If he doesn't....
Well, he was prepared. Accustomed to playing the waiting game to a certain degree, it was still always preferable to have a quick solution to your problems and if this could end this very evening, well,  it wasn’t a moment too soon.
It was like receiving a blow to the gut to look down at the name, so final, no more chances of anything else, just this. A quiet gravesite with a cold black headstone, nothing more.
“By the way, what is it in that briefcase you’re carrying? Did you put something in there for pretence sake or is it empty?”
If he did, he had never exposed anything the way he did with everything else he encountered, he had never dragged it out into the shameful light, revealed Mycroft’s biggest weakness and that fact alone spoke against Sherlock actually knowing anything.
Dr Roylott screamed and clawed at the snake but it seemed to have buried its teeth quite deep and wasn’t letting go easily.
“Assumingly because pointing a gun at another person in broad daylight would have ended you all kinds of trouble?” John hissed and tried jerking his head out of the firm grip, but to no avail.
“You did. It’s about ten years ago. Watford I think. That triple murder case that turned out to be nothing but some nutter trying to get Sherlock’s attention by staging crime scenes and calling Scotland Yard in order for you to bring your consultant.”
“The only thing absurd around here is your insistence that you do things for the sake of others. For that to be true you would need a shred of compassion and I’m afraid you’re sorely lacking in that department.”
Then he pushed the send button with a content smile before he put the phone back on the table and turned towards the open door that was silently calling for his attention.
Naturally he refrained from doing so, as he knew it wouldn’t earn him more than a look of displeasure. Instead he took a deep sigh before he spoke his final words.
“Oh, and no need trying to make a run for it, that would be a waste of both your time and as well as mine. There is nowhere to hide from me. Just ask dear Sherlock over there, he thought he had been so very very clever and yet...”
“I don’t know what you issue with Magnussen is all about. He told me you like playing games and you did something to him just the other day which whetted his appetite as much as it annoyed him immensely. But his business with you is his own choice, I’m not getting in the middle of it as long as it has nothing to do with me.” His fingers circled the handle of the poker determinedly as if weighing it and its sturdiness. “But he is also a business partner of mine and I was told he sent a little gift of his own in that little delivery that was made to you. Something he said would assure your future pliancy. I don’t know what it was, but I know his methods well enough. Despite this, I don’t trust a rascal like you being turned off by the simple threat of blackmail. You seem far too full of yourself to listens to subtle cautions. I believe in a good old-fashioned warning. So here it comes: Stay out of my business. Don’t even attempt to pursue it any further or you’ll regret it. I’m nothing like our soft-spoken Danish friend with his more refined methods. I don’t want anything from you. I don’t have my mouth salivating at the sight of you. I don’t care who you’re related to or what you do with your life when you’re not trying to ensnare people with the promise of sexual gratification. The only thing I want is for you to stop hounding me, looking for ways to nestle yourself into my business.”
That predatory smile appeared once more on Magnussen lips as he kept walking closer to John where he was standing by the door.
It felt awful to consider being forced to hear Sherlock utter these words to him, that what they had shared had been nothing but a way for him to pass the time, but maybe John needed to hear that to come to a decision himself.
All he could do was to ensure the doctor that he would get in contact with his brother straight away and inform him of the latest development.
“But it’s obvious you did and quite soundly by the rumpled look of your hair and pyjamas, until you woke up rather abruptly. Still afraid of thunder and lightning after all these years, Mycroft?”
“Yes! I was there, I witnessed your struggle, you had trouble breathing, your lips were actually blue! I inserted the bloody adrenaline shot myself!”
Normally Mrs Hudson would take it if he just pretended to ignore the incessant ringing long enough, but apparently she was out as well as the buzzer kept going relentlessly, finally forcing him to rise in anger from his chair, his dressing gown billowing around him as he barged down the stairs, readying himself to to throw the door open and hurl insults at however had decided to disturb his piece.
At least Magnussen seemed momentarily occupied with Sherlock, not putting any focus on Mycroft and his colleagues for now, so even if Mycroft resented the man for indulging in his brother sexually, he was grateful for small mercies. As long as Sherlock kept him entertained, he was not going to launch any attacks in Mycroft’s direction.
He knew John hated when he acted like this. He claimed that it risked scaring off potential clients with this kind of rude behaviour, but Sherlock had long ago learned to hear the difference between the determined signal of anticipation when coming from a potential client or when it was just an idiot trying to get his attention by insisting to persistently use the door bell as a way of luring him out of the flat.
It was possible that a part of him still feared how vulnerable his feelings made him, but on the other hand, he couldn’t change it anyway. He did love Sherlock and so what if the other man knew about it? The biggest question was how Sherlock felt in return...
Finding Sherlock in the state he now was in had been a real schock that was still reverberating inside of John and he knew he couldn’t bare it if Sherlock actually died.
Two motionless, seemingly lifeless bodies, shot mere moments ago and yet not a single drop of blood to be seen anywhere? How was that even possible…?
Sherlock rolled his eyes and let out a histrionic sigh, as if these words were nothing but empty threats and John felt his blood boil at the sight of it. The nerve to act flippant in a situation like this! He felt how he was seconds away from actually interrupting in a fit of rage.
It said something about his own state of mind that the hint of sympathy he normally felt whenever Sherlock displayed obvious signs of discomfort and nerves, didn’t dictate him this evening. Perhaps he was nervous himself even if he would never admit to such a thing.
He let go of the limp hand to watch it fall back on top of the coverlet and then turned his back on Sherlock, ready to leave, now as he had seen what Mycroft had so adamantly tried to keep a secret.
Then it suddenly dawned on him and his eyes widened in shock at the realisation of who the man standing in front of him actually was.
Victor had been right in that there had never been any love lost between them, but they had conducted their dislike of each other with far more effort previously, but just like everything else around him had suffered a tendency to crumble to pieces as of late, so was their willingness to keep up the pretence of cordiality.
“I thought you wanted to listen to my heart and lungs as you actually brought a stethoscope this time? I believe it’s better done without any clothes on” he could hear Sherlock say from the bed, and now he sounded all innocent and oblivious all of a sudden.
He had disposed of the picture of himself, as well as the note and the envelope, but other than that, he couldn’t prepare any further, except steeling himself for whatever was going to happen.
It seemed idiotic to continue playing the part he had been assigned, Magnussen didn’t really seem convinced of his playacting skills anyway, but on the other hand, admitting defeat now meant that their game was over.
Getting himself home had been a troublesome affair involving taking the tube out to the suburbs to cut the costs of a taxi taking him all the way back to the barracks. But sitting on the tube on a Saturday night dressed in a formal army dress uniform with a bunch of teenagers out on a night of fun, the regular drunkards as well as the odd crazy person who was just out looking for trouble got him in more than one brawl along the way, one of them ending with him throwing a punch followed by the unfortunate sound of nose cartilage breaking and blood spurting all over his clothes.
He wasn’t sure anymore but nodded all the same and turned around to follow the other man back inside. Without having to ask he knew there would be a black car waiting for him at the front.
He could only see the backs of people surrounding the vehicle and most of them were co-workers while a few of them wore those white lab coats that were significant for staff members working in the reasearch facility.
“Oh, he’s ignored far more important things than neglecting to show up for a lunch date. Did he actually reply that he was going to attend?”
“I’ll come find you tomorrow morning, Dr Watson. I’m afraid the offer to use my driver has been withdrawn but I’m sure you’ll manage to find a way to get yourself home. You’re an army doctor after all, being resourceful is hardly a novelty for someone like you.”
The difference between him and Sherlock though was that the detective would be able to make a deduction out of it whereas John only saw the oddity but didn’t know what to do with it
Dr Roylott snorted at the same time as John did, and Mycroft arched his eyebrows at the sound, but Magnussen didn’t move a muscle to indicate that he cared about their obvious show of contempt for what he was saying.
John pressed his nails hard into the soft flesh of his palms to divert himself from going any further with those thoughts right now and turned his attention to the conversation in front of him instead.
So he had penned down a small letter, in succinct words, informing the other man what Magnussen had been up to and directing his attention to Mycroft’s surveillance as proof of the validity of his words.
He exits the surveillance room while buttoning-up his waistcoat once more and straightening his tie.
The opportunities were endless and while he had been sitting across the man this afternoon he had entertained himself with picturing the various scenarios he could choose from, the man sobbing in the chair in front of him being none the wiser.
It had been absolutely hateful, and it was part of the reason why he never desired to return willingly.
“Yes, I would say he’s probably due here within two hours at the most. So better get prepared, bundle up in that bed of yours and put your acting skills to some good use. Nice to see that they are finally coming in handy, little brother. We are lucky Magnussen isn’t actually a doctor, though, you won’t need to pull off the trickery you needed to fool Dr Watson.”
There was a hitch to her voice now and John felt alarm rising inside of him that she was suddenly going to burst into tears.
Now that he had figured out the identity of the stranger in the room he allowed his eyes to roam the other man’s appearance more closely, looking for signs that could explain why someone like Sherlock Holmes would go ahead and marry a person like this. So far John was hardly impressed and marvelled over the fact that Sherlock might actually fall for this guy.
To think that John Watson actually imagined himself having a chance at getting this, taking claim over Mycroft’s precious little brother as if it was actually a realistic option. Taking the he only person Mycroft has ever cared for, the only person he can’t allow to be wasted on anyone else.
He bent over and began to do mouth-to mouth again while his mind raced with a million thoughts, fervently hoping that help would soon arrive….
Sherlock was a keen collector himself of all things he found fascinating, no regard to age, functionality or if it matched the rest of his furniture. But even he had limits.
“You know, Sherlock, you’ve been playing me like that violin of yours for weeks on end but the longer the tune the more winded up I’ve become and I tell you, if you don’t start to provide me with some good explanation for all of this, I’m going to snap.”
Sherlock, who had now turned his attention to his laptop next to the microscope instead, simply shrugged.
When they finally broke apart from the kiss, John panted for air and Sherlock’s lips looked swollen and debauched.
The human skull, the  bison with the head phones, not to mention that god awful collection of beetles surrounding the stuffed bat inside a collector’s box, residing on the mantle, were all things Mycroft would never understand why his brother bothered to hang onto, but at least the chair was comfortable, more so than the ancient atrocity that was John’s chair.
He had expected some sort of relief or at least a little gratitude at this piece of news but instead he saw John exchanging glances with Mycroft and not so much as a trace of happiness on neither of their faces.
He tried listening to sounds while standing with his phone in his hand, the charger cord dangling from it like a limp tape worm. He laid it carefully on the now empty bed and then stepped out into the dark hallway.
The most noticeable was his face, a sight to behold even under normal circumstances but tonight he looked spectacular with his eyes huge and dark, the cheekbones sharp and prominent, slightly flushed and John couldn’t help but stare at him from across the table, thirstily drinking in every detail of his lover’s appearance.
“Oh, don’t bother, he isn’t siding with me. He merely wants to have his way with my brother, that’s where his interest both begins and ends in this matter…And convinced as well that he might achieve it. Perhaps he will thanks to you.”
Pain and suffering, if knowing there was a light at the end of the tunnel was one thing. This agonising torture with no hope in sight was simply awful and gutting to realise.
“Probably,” Mycroft mumbled, thinking about the rage in John’s eyes when he had seen him earlier. It was quite plausible that there would be no relationship left by the end of this evening.
This was all down to his brother’s incessant need for control. It was straight out compulsory, and it had always been an issue between them. Better to let Mycroft believe he had won this round and continue with his own investigations under the radar.
“That was rather the question I came here to ask you. When is the last time you saw him, doctor Watson?”
Mycroft on the screen freezes on the spot but the live version by the door does indeed make use of his mobility by forming the most curt twist of his lips, taking in the situation in front of him before his eyes switches to himself on the screen.
As Sherlock would have put it, if he had still been around to pass a comment, how utterly ridiculous.
It was easy to deduce that Magnussen’s driver was probably standing guard at the front, preventing him from using that exit, so the bathroom actually seemed the likeliest option.
“Yes. This particular device makes an unpredictable return. But the outcome will be quite different this time, I assure you.” John said.
The man called Jeremy Marcus has done a phenomenal job it seems. Not a trace in sight of anything regarding his whereabouts, nor Sherlock’s.
“I am sure there is no reason to go that far. But the occasional peck on the cheek is perhaps to be expected and I will try to tolerate it as well as I am able. As I’m sure John will as well.”
“Put the call on speaker,” he demanded. “I don’t want you tipping your mate off what we are here for. I need to hear what you two are saying.”
That he assumed it to be posh was solely based on what he knew of Sherlock and Mycroft, because with their public school way of speaking, the large house, the fact that they had servants and the way they dressed in expensive clothes told him that he dealt with people that belonged to a higher class than the average. He did not really know anything about Victor Trevor but assumed that Mycroft would never allow his little brother to marry some random pauper so most likely he was well off too.
“Sound like someone else I know…” Sherlock muttered and turned his eyes to look at John instead, who gave him a crooked smile in the mirror.
Suddenly he noticed how Sherlock tensed over by the window, his eyes narrowing as he observed something outside.
Carefully folding his coat, jacket and shirt in a neat pile on the floor, Sherlock removed the belt he had chosen to wear for this particular occasion. He usually never wore belts, his trousers were made to fit him impeccably so there was no real need for him to wear one, but for this occasion, it had been a necessary addition to his outfit.
Mycroft decided to rise from his chair, using his umbrella as leverage, ready to excuse himself from this awkward situation He had other, more pressing matters to attend to, rather than watching the cat who got the cream finish his meal.
Sherlock shrugged, as if all his planning had only been about Magnussen. Victor was after all also a tangible threat to his happiness and the initial instigator to this whole mess in the first place, so it was a bit surprising for John to see how Sherlock reacted to his question.
All sorts of images were now swirling around inside John’s head, one more despicable than the next and they all involved Magnussen trying his damnedest to let his hands wander all over Sherlock’s body. Both he and Mycroft had clearly miscalculated this side of Magnussen and if Sherlock hadn’t looked so indifferent about it all, John might even had demanded that Mycroft should apologise for this severe mishap in his plotting. John was so far gone in his own thoughts by now that he hardly registered that Sherlock had continued talking.
If Sherlock wasn’t the victim himself, he would probably be giddy with glee at the thought of trying to solve it.
“He just called and said that I could keep the ring but that he wasn’t ready to take the plunge, that it had to do with him and not me, that he needed time to figure himself out first, making it sound like he was reading straight out of some breakup manual or something.”
Then he grabbed the riding crop firmly in his hand, a jolt of excitement running through his eager body as he marched towards Sherlock’s bedroom and the hopefully repentant person who waited for him in there.
Sherlock snorted at this but Mycroft tugged his wrist so he was forced to take a step forward by following the involuntary movement and their faces came close to one another.
The state of the place did not seem to concern Sherlock though, who came up from behind as John entered through the front door and snaked his arm around John’s waist while pressing his lips to his neck, taking the time to tease the sensitive skin by swirling his tongue in that familiar way that sent a tingling sensation straight to John’s groin and made him go weak at the knees.
In that aspect John Watson was as predictable as most men who happened to find someone a little out of their league and who struggled with that notion just as strongly as they struggled to keep that person under close watch, so as not to lose them to someone more worthy. It was a weak trait to be so jealous, Sherlock would naturally not leave John for anyone else solely based on a comparison of status, especially not to someone like Magnussen. But the destructive combination of feeling like the underdog as well as an instinctive streak of protectiveness was unfortunately a part of John Watson’s personality, and if flaring up too often, it could turn problematic for his brother and his army doctor.
“Don’t even consider rising from that floor or I’ll shot a third hole through your body!” he yelled to the man inside and the quickly redialled Mycroft.
It seems like weeks has passed since then and as he peels his socks off, they actually reek a little bit.
His brother’s lips came close to Mycroft’s ear, his breath ghosting against the skin in a way that made the hairs on his neck stand up, as his brother whispered:
This wasn’t worse than one of his nastiest drug withdrawals, not yet, but it was certainly in the top three of excruciating experiences he had suffered from. And it was probably only going to get worse, so there was still a chance of making it to number one.
Even from a distance he saw that the formerly locked door was now opened and a slightly hunched figure stood leaning against the frame, the gun still in his hand, the hand now listlessly hanging as if all his strength had deserted him.
John whipped his had to stare at Mike. Then he quickly turned his head back and stretched his neck to get a better look.
“That’s idea. Appearances are everything in this day and age, so who bothers with real facts? It’s what we
John had opted for too small and subtle hints so far and the object of his desires had stubbornly remained oblivious, to Mycroft’s great relief.
John couldn’t help but allow his gaze to travel the interior as he walked, certain that Mycroft must be doing the same, despite looking completely unphased.
“That’s a bleak way to put it, but yeah, I suppose you’re right, life can be a struggle sometimes,” John agreed as he kept looking at the other man, not sure what to make of him yet.
He had tried to use his time wisely, thinking over the plan in his head during the long hours he had spent at the place Mycroft had managed to turn into a makeshift private clinic. It had been essential to make this situation look what they wanted it to appear like.
likes to nag about it, not that you should start to do so as well. I don’t eat because digestion slows me down and food is.....well, boring. And I smoke because I have nothing else that can create any sort of high without containing an illicit substance and I’m sure both you and my brother can agree that nicotine is preferable to cocaine on any day.”
The seed about Sherlock possibly suffering from a drug addiction had already been planted earlier and had resulted in Magnussen’s first suspicions at the dinner party. He did after all know about Sherlock’s past as an addict and knew what a slippery-slope such cravings could turn into.
John’s eyes narrowed for a second because why did this keep happening, that people always knew who he was without him having any idea of who they were in return? It was starting to become annoying.
“How did you know about my service gun?” he asked calmly as he had regained enough composure to keep his voice level and even.
It was a conundrum that he was constantly contemplating  at the back of his mind, because now that he had relished the taste of owning both Holmes brothers, the thought of being deprived that pleasure did not sit well with him. But for now, no further ideas had presented themselves.
John frowned and tried to remember if this was something he had noticed as well but could not recall having observed any changes in his lover’s physique.
But despite feeling relatively secure in the knowledge that Sherlock has always managed to get himself out of every tricky situation thrown his way so far, John also knows that
After having realised that the gates to the premises were not only firmly closed but also unmanned, and resolutely shutting down any suggestions from John to simply attempt breaking in anyway, Magnussen whipped his phone out with a sigh.
He decided to focus on Mycroft instead, out of two evils, the one he knew how to attack was the easier choice.
He determinedly put his cup down next to him and then leaned back in his chair, a satisfied smile on his lips.
“That brings me to another area of interest.” Magnussen turned around in his chair to face John again. “I’m not sure you have been informed of the latest development regarding your former patient’s health status? There has been a sudden change of events that occurred this very morning and which has given us all quite a shock. Especially his fiancé, who was not fully updated of this unfortunate deterioration of Sherlock’s health, mostly because Mycroft Holmes had not bothered to inform him of it.”
As they passed the room where Sherlock had taken him the previous time and instead headed down the stairs, John wondered where they were going exactly.
If he was even still inside the flat. There was a risk he had simply left, specially considering his flaring temper.
When this is done and over with, if it ever gets to that point, John is going to permanently erase Mycroft Holmes from his life and never set eyes on him ever again.
He straightens his waistcoat and notices the crumbs on his chest for the first time. His hands waiver above them for a second before he brushes them off and then he turns away.
As the silence stretched on, Magnussen was the one who had to continue talking if they were going to get somewhere.
Big brother must secretly wonder why such an amount of time could pass without John noticing that Sherlock was gone. Tired or not, John always navigates directly to wherever Sherlock is located.
Then he raised it and slammed it down again, even more forcefully this time, creating another tear, ripping the entire figure apart.
He was still angry and hurt of course, whenever his mind touched on the subject of Sherlock, he felt his blood begin to boil and he had no idea how he was going to rid himself of that feeling without allowing it all sink in properly. He hated the idea of dwelling on something that had caused him so much pain, but he also realised that he would not be able to move on if he continued to shy away from thinking about it. The problem was that beyond the hurt and the anger, there was also embarrassment.
The door to the living room was half-way open and even before John had entered he caught a glimpse of the tableau presented in there, with Sherlock sprawled over the sofa, still dressed in his shirt and trousers from the dinner party but the jacket had been discarded somewhere, eyes closed and his face deadly pale.
It was interesting to meet someone who also liked things a little thrilling. He knew he hadn’t been wrong when assuming that this man was far more interesting than Magnussen and his sordid blackmailing attempts. This had the promise of something truly exciting.
John stared at it. It was undoubtedly his, he would recognise it anywhere and he had heard two sharp gunshots and yet…
There had been plenty of opportunities to experience that same scenario over the years and he always felt just as uncomfortable being put through it, because this was a place where someone like him with all the power he had at his disposal still had no impact over anything – he was helplessly in the hands of the medical staff just like everyone else, with no way of predicting the outcome.
Magnussen had a few stipulations of his own as well of course but as Victor had been the provider of the damning evidence, he was the one who made the first demands. The agreement, beyond my hand in matrimony, was Mycroft’s compliance to the whole arrangement as well as being lenient with a few other things Magnussen had set his eyes upon. If anything, I think Magnussen was willing to play intermediary instead of instigator simply because it presented him with an opportunity to finally stick it to the impenetrable Mycroft Holmes. He is otherwise much more in charge of the deals he makes, not working as some sort of middleman.
“There is normally a two-year vetting process to even get considered for a position at the research facility but it could of course be arranged to accommodate you within a couple of months if you choose to accept this offer first and manage to keep my brother under your watchful eye for the duration of time that this service is needed. He is engaged to be married within four months and after the wedding his husband will most likely pick someone of his own choice for the job and you will be free to do as you please.”
“A reasonable suggestion.” He took another sip, watching John over the rim of his glass, allowing silence to stretch as if carefully considering what question to ask first. John knew it for the power play that it was. Mycroft used the same tactic, turning quiet and thereby unsettling the other person with his silence, so John supressed the impulse to say anything until Magnussen had broken the impasse.
Sherlock managed to gather himself sufficiently from the surprising sight and opened his mouth to say something, but John shook his head resolutely and for the second time this evening Sherlock went silent again, without voicing what had been on his mind.
“I find that hard to believe. Not sure my brother likes the idea of anyone ravaging my body actually.”
By the gates he noticed a shiny silver-metallic car pass by, and for a second he wondered if it was Mycroft who had sent a vehicle to retrieve him, dissatisfied with his meagre report.
The other man remains where he is, looking at John, as if he expects further information and John decides to try forming a connection with the people who are working to obtain Sherlock, humanise at least one of them so he has someone he can talk to, to get the information he is sure Mycroft will not divulge if not straight-out asked.
