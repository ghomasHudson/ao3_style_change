Sherlock’s words echoed in the room, and John laughed with him, unable to contain himself. It was then that he moved and surrounded Sherlock in a strong embrace, sobbing like a child, covering his face with one hand to prevent them from seeing him cry. He couldn’t believe his luck. In recent times, he had begun to believe that he would die alone. That his destiny was truncated. That he was condemned to solitude. John cried like he had not allowed himself to do it in years, knowing there was someone who would comfort him. He allowed himself to break into a thousand pieces, because he had someone who had promised to reconstruct him right in front of him, surrounding him with his arms to make sure that he didn’t get lost.
“I’m glad you are enjoying it.” John took another sip of his wine, and after taking a good look at Sherlock, he busied himself cutting a piece of his steak. Behind them, in another room annexed to theirs, music began to play. It was a small band with a pianist, two violinists, a cello, and a harp. The music was soft and low enough not to be a bother when talking.
John looked at the object he was holding. It was one of the weight discs. It was thick and cold but  the only indication that it was indeed, real, were the numbers and brand name carved on it.
It was why that small and short conversation was so important. It was because if Jim had dared to lay his filthy hands on his soulmate, the person that gave him a reason to not end his life and stopped him in killing himself in those first three years of the dictatorship; he would kill him slowly and painfully. If his wolf was one of those people trapped in the hell that Mycroft had to come and go every day, he would then lose his mind.
It happened on a quiet Friday evening, after John had come back from the clinic. Sherlock had been receiving crossed signals from his friend for the last few weeks. One day he was extremely tactile, resting a hand on Sherlock’s hips while crossing by him in the living area. Another time, John was Standing at his back, close enough for Sherlock to feel the heat of his body against his backbone while he had Rosie on his lap. At first he thought it was a parental thing, a way to mark his territory, so to speak. Perhaps to make sure Rosie knew who her real father was.
John felt Sherlock entwining his fingers with his, giving him a reassuring squeeze. He felt his muscles, previously tense, relax at his touch.
“My pleasure,” he answered, dropping a soft kiss on Sherlock jaw. “I think I could get used to this.”
In his sleep, it seemed something completely logical. When he talked, the oxygen mask that he was wearing fogged up.
Sherlock felt the hand clutching the collar of his shirt press harder and heard a soft gasp as John let his head fall to the side, giving him more space for the first sucking bite.
John’s martial steps were beginning to make the policemen that were watching him feel uncomfortable, up to the point that many of them looked away, intimidated.
Sherlock did not want to know the misfortune of all those dystopians. He had long surrendered in trying to empathize with them. He had enough with Wiggins, the engine that was moving his plan. It was what lit his thirst for revenge. "I do not care what that maniac does. He cannot be stopped. I do not want to know."
There were also the tunnels of the sewage system and the pipelines of River Fleet, which entered until they reached to the ‘clean’ area.
There was something worried about the voice, something he had learned to recognise. But the burning was just too much. White noise covered his ears, his eyes, his heart, his brain. It was like navigating across a sea of honey.
He felt Moran's hand taking his arm with a considerable force, shaking him up to get him on his feet. He hissed when he felt the pain of the blows right where Moran was holding him. Slowly rising, he felt the tightness of the chains. Something brushed past his neck, hard and cold, tightening itself up until it made his breathing labored. The tension in his legs disappeared with a metallic clatter, and he did not flee because of the leg cramps, he felt them loose from spending so much time with them unused. He had to use all his willpower in order to prevent himself from trying to make an escape attempt. It would not do any good for him.
It came to him almost like a good friend. The soul’s whispers caressed his skin like a soft kiss, and the memories slid slowly over him like a well fitting coat. Watson hadn’t been a saint, but he had been dedicated to protect and save others, and he had been loyal till the end. Killed in combat, protecting another comrade, saving his life. How fitting to have the name of a broken soldier, too.
John nodded. If it was true that he would not be able to escape, at least it would make life easier for Holmes, who seemed to not enjoy his work at all.
“It is. It gets a bit confusing,” he conceded, softly. Confident John wouldn’t turn him away, he moved to take his left hand and give it a comforting squeeze. John smiled gently and squeezed back in answer, entwining their fingers.
His wings were firmly pressed against his body, both protecting him from the wind and helping him gain speed. When he saw a yellow light, floating in the middle of nowhere, he opened them slowly, controlling the fall to reach the light. When he got closer, the flame moved and he smiled. He chased the light across the darkness, knowing it would take him where he wanted to go.
There were a few gym machines and weight discs piled on one side of the room. John could also see a medium sized grey mat with several shelves around it holding almost any kind of weapon he could imagine.
“...what a shame, Holmes, that you could not see Rose Hill in the light of a sunny day. It is such a lovely place. I am especially fond of the lake. Deep and dark and no doubt full of secrets.” The threat was brutally clear.
“Thank you, William,” I said, taking the telegram from him. “Wait a moment.” I retreated to where my coat was hanging on its hook, reached into the pocket and took out some coins, without even counting the amount. It was Christmas, after all. “Thank you,” I said again.
Our landlady, who had almost reached the door, whipped around. “What? Really? Oh, at last!” She laughed in delight and clapped her hands, before coming to embrace a reluctant Sherlock, who held his bacon-and-honey sandwich safely out of the way.
It will come as no surprise to anyone who reads Watson’s little scribblings in the Strand that I do not enjoy social gatherings. When I commented such to my companion, as we donned our tailcoats and best waistcoats, Watson gave a bark of laughter. “Yes,” he said. “I am familiar with you.”
A text message buzzed on Sherlock’s phone. As he reached for it, he smiled at me. “Maybe it’s a serial killer and I’ll be busy for days.”
He paused. For a moment, just a blink, John thought he saw two figures vanishing into the swirling snow. Two men, almost shadows wearing long coats and tall hats, walking away from 221 Baker Street, arm in arm. They were there and then they were gone.
“The largest floating Christmas tree in the world,” said the ginger-haired stranger  who had slipped next to him like a ghost.
It was still snowing, even more briskly now, and the taxi driver loudly expressed his opinion over having to rush to the airport in such conditions. When the car slipped a bit and narrowly missed brushing against a bread delivery van, that was enough. “Perhaps,” Sherlock pointed out archly, “if you would concentrate more on the actual driving and less on complaining, we might all be better off.”
It was not until they were sitting in the back room of a small, slightly rundown cafe which doubled as a MI6 safe house that Mycroft took the opportunity to study his brother carefully. It was difficult to find any hint of the inquisitive and annoying little boy, the sullen teenager, even the junkie of the past. Instead, he saw a man who had spent too long balancing on a tightrope, tempting death and committing acts he’d never actually contemplated committing. Mycroft did not dare to look into Sherlock’s eyes for more than a moment, because he feared what he might do if he let himself be captured by the naked pain residing there. Like simply grabbing his brother and shoving him onto the first plane bound for London.
It all happened quickly then. Wilkins, after one instant of shock, lunged for a knife on the nearby table and then, as he leapt towards Holmes, I fired. He landed on the lovely Persian carpet and proceeded to bleed all over it.
“Oh, no, dear, thank you. Off  with Mrs Turner to a coffee morning at the senior centre.” She could not resist tidying a bit first, however.
He reached out to pluck a piece of stray greenery from my trousers. “A souvenir from the market,” he said.
Sherlock thought of the gift waiting under the tree, the face of that nameless man, how it made him think of John. And then he fell asleep.
In retrospect, of course, the way the day was turning out should have been entirely predictable. Had he really thought that sleeping with Sherlock Holmes would suddenly turn the other man into a reasonable adult? Did he even
Sherlock scowled at him, fighting the temptation to crawl back into the bed. “You’re a terrible flatmate.”
She poured me tea and rather forcefully put a sandwich on the plate. “He said to be sure you ate when you arrived.”
My bullet, on the other hand, went directly into Biggins’ shoulder and he fell, loudly bewailing his pain and misfortune.
She studied him for a moment, her eyes sharp behind the old-fashioned eyeglasses. then made a sweeping gesture around the small premises. “I think you might find something here, in that case.”
When that one finished, there was a long pause. I thought that my private concert was over and started to rise. But Sherlock raised the bow again. “This one...has no name yet. I tried, but nothing fit properly.”
He lingered, as if in search of conversation. Bored, no doubt, by the scarcity of custom due to the dreadful storm roaring outside. “Mr Holmes has not returned yet?” he said by way of engaging me.
I woke at some point in the last hour before night became dawn, to find the space beside me in the bed quite empty. I rose and walked into the sitting room. Holmes was standing at the window, looking down at Regent Street. “Are you all right?” I asked softly.
I suppose it is a tragedy that someone has died—been brutally slain, in fact—just two days before the happiness of Christmas, but to my shame, I found myself more irritated than anything else. It was cold and the snow had not ceased and I devoutly wished that my dear friend and companion had sent the good Lestrade away when he turned up at our door, cap in hand [at least figuratively] to plead for help with a case in Golder’s Green. I perhaps was a bit curt with him.
It was only a few minutes later, although it seemed much longer, that I saw the lights of a house ahead of me. Rose Hill. I knew, somehow, that Holmes was in there and that he was alive. If he were not, I was convinced that my heart would know. And how he would mock me for the sentiment.
I had actually been brushing down my best suit the previous day, in preparation for the occasion, when Holmes had burst into the bedroom, filled with the kind of excitement only brought on by a case that promised the stimulation his mind demanded. “Watson! Pack an overnight bag! We are off to the wilds of Devon in search of a most cunning killer!”
“But he had charmed them first, I believe.” Considering the matter ended, Holmes closed his eyes then and lost himself in thought for the rest of the journey.
Nothing at Harrod’s. Or Fortnum and Mason. And there wasn’t any reason at all to even try Marks and Sparks.
The city was ready for the holidays, the usual London hustle and bustle multiplied by ten. A light snow was falling, the store windows teased and tempted, the buskers were entertaining the crowds with every vaguely themed Christmas song in existence. It was something of a relief to get to the British Museum, although there was the usual throng of tourists and school groups to deal with inside.
“For tonight, yes,” he replied. “I would simply like to discover the pleasure of sleeping next to you.”
Lestrade looked tired, as if his day had been too long already. “I was supposed to have the day off,” he said mournfully. “Planning to do all my Christmas shopping.”
John didn’t bother to swear again, because over-use diluted the effect, but he did set a second mug onto the counter a little more forcefully than was either necessary or desirable. “You love dressing up and larking about in a costume,” he said then. “
“Oh, pish posh,” she replied, heading for the door. “You should have a hot bath after your tea. It might improve your mood.”
” he growled. John, lost in a cloud of lust and hunger, growled back, frustrated and furious. His eyes were black pools, dark and deep as the ocean.
Sherlock woke up when John’s sandy hair tickled his nose. Cuddled as they were on the bed, with the chill of the autumn air cooling the windows, and early morning sunlight softly illuminating the bedroom, the detective decided a bit of laziness was in order. Comfortable in the security of his husband’s arms, he groaned, turned around so he was facing John’s chest, and lowered himself enough to hide his face from sunlight under John’s chin. As Sherlock rubbed his cheek against the pillow below him to find a better position, he proceeded to raise a leg under the bed clothes, and throw it over John’s upper legs. John twitched in his sleep and, still asleep, tightened his grip on Sherlock’s back, arm finding automatically a better position.
It felt a bit like an orgasm, letting go this way. The swollen tissue behind his fangs was finally at rest, the ache in his teeth stopped, yet shivers ran down his body. He felt suddenly numb, before pulling back and lapping carefully at the teeth marks on John’s neck. His saliva sealing the bite slowly but efficiently, cleaning away any bacteria and helping the blood coagulate.
Human life was so ridiculously short. So he had made up his mind a while ago. He appreciated John enough to step aside and let him have what he needed. Selfishness wouldn’t help.
’s head, gently passing it downwards. He felt his wolf’s ears low, and heard the soft pitiful sounds that he uttered. He noticed that his snout was resting on a tight spot on his body. He tried to sit up and a flash of pain pierced him and brought him back abruptly in place.
Sorry for having gone so slow with this. I had three versions of the chapter and none of them seemed good to me. XD
He discovered the Leader's name when he appeared in an official statement put on the weekly report on the TV. The image barely lasted twenty seconds, but Sherlock was able to remember. And with the name and the face, the bastard's days were numbered. Sherlock was twenty-six years old, and Mycroft was thirty-one.
He had no time to think about anything else before the glass under his fingers shattered  into thousands of tiny shards.
Mycroft made an affirmative sound. His voice sounded distant, even across the always clear and nitid sound the amulet produced. Sherlock heard some papers being moved, and a keyboard being used. His brother was surely checking some kind of report on the matter.
Sherlock swallowed, his eyes itching, and could do nothing else but nod his head in answer. Our daughter. Theirs. Both of them, together. It was the first time John had said that.
“Not really. He got her pregnant with Eurus before they got married and then left again to go back to London. When he came back, Eurus was almost one year old. He kept writing to my mother telling her he was going to marry her when he got back, and eventually he did. The third time he left, mother was already pregnant with Mycroft. And the next one was me. I never knew a thing about my father until he came back one last time when I was four. He had bought a house in Sussex with the money he had made and wanted us to go with him so we could all live together there. Mother accepted and we all moved to England. My aunt had died a couple of months ago. She had been ill for a long time.”
It was strange to see again the streets of London in which he grew up in, in the London where there were green parks and people were cared, where the streets oozed with life, and traffic was suffocating, but steady, it was as if an immense and invisible heart would pump it through the veins of the city… blood made up of metal and gasoline… He grew up in a London where the traffic lights would work and the streetlights were promptly lit when the light left the horizon and weren’t turned off until dawn appeared… Where children played without fear of being assaulted by the authorities.
I'm deeply sorry this took so long! Work and rl have been wild lately, and I got a bit absorbed into the Good Omens thing... seriously, good stuff. Go watch it (or read it).
Sherlock rose raised an eyebrow and gently slid a finger against his hole. He was surprised to discover the muscle relaxed and his finger found wetness before sliding in easily.
However, and, despite the circumstances, he was not in a completely unfavorable situation. John had treated some cases of people from the ‘Lion Den’ which had a closed stomach from the lack of food available, with their bellies swollen but empty of all food. When they reached the mobile stalls of the health care under the bridges, the medics knew that there was nothing that they could do to help them rather than give them shelter until they died.
“I ate before arriving,” Sherlock arched an eyebrow; he couldn’t believe Mycroft stealing food, “Mike gave it to me.”
So there were many dystopics with an avatar that had lost their other half. And that, lately, was not surprising.
Oblivious to the world around him, the man walked across the street. An aura was protecting him from human eyes, giving him a regular appearance. Truly, he looked quite a lot like he did when he was filled with Grace. His horns and the fire they held were still present, and so were his wings. But no human or angel would be able to see them. He was safe.
“Hell, I hope there’s a heaven after all. Maybe I can talk my way in. I’d hate to think I won’t see you again.”
He wished he could do something to reduce the blood loss. His saliva would have been more efficient, but that would not do any good for the internal bleeding.
Sherlock had held John all the way to the Holmes Manor. Mycroft’s car had become uncomfortably quiet after John’s heart finally gave up and stopped beating. Even though he had been able to smell the changing blood inside of him, holding John while he died had been harder than he thought it would be.
Sherlock saw how the strong muscles of John’s arm worked and tensed as he kept the human still, and how his back contracted when, fast as lightning, he bit down right over the marks Sherlock had left for him.
The doors of the lift opened and they appeared in a clean room, full of corridors and secondary rooms. Probably they were in an empty floor of an office building, but with the interrogation room this could only be Scotland Yard.
“I know, John. It’ll be over soon.” Sherlock held John firmly against him as he got to his feet. For the sake of appearances, he usually had to act every time he held John, controlling his real strength in front of other people. But now it was no use.
“I know. The other option is the vampire who changed me could have fled somehow. They could have taken me out to the shore, changed me there, and then somehow they managed to disappear leaving three healthy humans behind. Not bothering to check if I made it.”
The cozy and family-like lifestyle they had become appealing, and he found himself comfortable, and Sherlock found himself comfortable, not at all bothered by the calmness or repetitive schedule of their days. Rosie was interesting enough to have him entertained, and the ocasional cases and even John himself did the trick when nothing else did.
Greg, stunned by the spectacle, tried to get up from his chair to allow the couple some privacy. Suddenly, Irene’s message made sense. Sherlock had felt John’s clinical death as his own, and that was why Adler had called him. Probably Sherlock had experienced the pain of the loss. For a moment, he felt a strong sympathy for the lad. It wasn’t an easy process to go through. Those who were part of the Resistance knew. When Mycroft found out, he was not going to be very happy.
“Good. Look at you. It’s like your heart isn’t beating at all. Guess I’ve lost too much blood. Or maybe you are an angel after all,” he muttered, a smile on his lips.
The house was completely empty, the lights off. And so they stayed. Turning them on would make it possible to know that the house was being occupied when the sole owner was not present. An accusation of trespassing private property would not help him. If the police came and saw that he was there, they would believe that he was a ghost or more likely, they would arrest him and discover his secret. His life would be over, and Mycroft would also be punished for high treason or the closest thing that had existed at the time that what was known, as a betrayal to the crown and country.
Sherlock’s heart gave a particularly painful ache at the words. He shook his head and admitted on a whisper, “We’re not actually together.”
Watson nudges Holmes, who is nearer to her, and the younger man stands to take the tray from her hands to place it on the coffee table. At the same time, Watson drags his chair over to be nearer the couch and gently guides her down in to it, her eyes still fixed on the screen.
“Perfect,” John says, trying to fight off the feeling of nervousness that’s trying to take hold again. It’s just a meet up at a bar, for crying out loud! He can do this, it’s not even remotely close to being a big deal.
Sherlock sniffed, wet tracks dripping over his cheeks and nodded, “I’m not upset,” he explained, obviously bewildered.
“Crass,” Sherlock accused before turning back to his microscope, pretending to go back to his experiment.
“Oh, is this where we're going for the reunion?” John asked, watching as Sherlock nodded in silence.
“They who?” Watson scoffs with a smile, “The scientists inside your Mind Palace who justify your smoking habit?”
Sherlock is in the cab when the mini telly starts to show Moriarty telling a tale about Sir Boast-A-Lot, which ends up being a story about how Moriarty is poisoning the minds of those around Sherlock in to believing that he’s the bad guy instead of good.
Nightmares tend to take more out of Sherlock than most everything else in his life, so when he deigns to sleep with John again the next night, the older man is a bit shocked but accepting.
“Ye-yes, I am aware of that,” Sherlock gulped, attempting to clear the fog in his mind, “I just -- I’m not sure that doing it in a
Sherlock’s breath hitches as his cock responds to the words, filling at the same time as his desire for this man does.
And that’s when John remembers the potion. That’s when he gently pushes Sherlock away and steps back. He had no idea his will power was so strong.
John instinctively wrapped his arms tighter around Sherlock’s torso to stop him moving further, but couldn’t help the disbelieving chuckle that escaped his throat, “In all my life, Sherlock Holmes, I never could have dreamed of being chosen as a best friend by someone like you.”
“I showed him a picture of a man pleasuring himself with his own mouth and then asked him to show me,” Sherlock explained and then seemed to go offline for a moment, “Impressive? Why is it impressive?”
Holmes breathes in deep through his nose, the reminder that his going after Watson was no coincidence. Watson is the heart to his brain, a matched set from the very beginning.
Around the same time, Watson - in an alternate 2015 dimension - returns to 221B with Tesco bags in hand.
Holmes entered the flat looking worn from travel with his suitcase in hand. Upon meeting my gaze, his entire manner became more relaxed as a smile overtook his face.
Greg’s badger leapt over him, a warm presence on his stomach. He had no idea where Garm was, but he felt that he wasn’t far away. He laughed, but the laughter made his ribs hurt. He coughed and stopped, grimacing. Maybe it would be better if he was not that happy for a while.
Escaping from his own mind, John had walked to the victim’s house, where he saw the police officers and a detective speaking with his devastated parents. John listened as close as he could without fear of being noticed. The boy had been acting strange lately. Leaving home with friends, and staying out until the morning. They just thought it was some kind of teenage phase. They were concerned the boy had been on drugs and hadn’t told them.
The blood of his wounds and the tear that they surely had, stained the cotton without dyeing the garments, and it was as if he was going naked.
“Wait.” John stopped dead in his tracks, perplexed. “You ‘got terribly rich during your pirate days’?”
“Thank you,” he replied. He really felt it. His body had grown accustomed to the lack of food (largely thanks to the use of narcotic substances, moving freely in the Lions Den).
Resisting the urge to lick it clean, he carefully passed the boxers over John, being careful not to overstimulate the sensitive area. Once it looked decent enough, he cleaned himself and then threw it the soiled fabric over his shoulder, not caring where it fell.
He rose his eyebrows, moving so he could get to his feet. The man walked, his naked feet sinking into the burning ash of the ground. Enormous wings folded back leaving trials behind him. The milky skin burned with glowing embers, before sticking back again by its own accord. His expression betrayed no feel of pain. He looked at the creature at his feet.
“I’ll drink to that,” he said, finishing the remains of his wine. Then he toyed with the glass, spinning it slowly between his fingers. “I didn't want to lose more time, to be honest. We’ve been circling around each other long enough, and I... I love you, Sherlock. I’m a little scared because I’ve never felt this way, but it’s the truth.”
The detective made a face, trying to find the best way to explain something he wasn’t quite sure about himself. John had seen that expression only a few times, yet he would recognise it anytime and any place.
He was about to lecture his friend about it, when Sherlock took the black sackcloth bag off the man’s head.
John’s hand came up to gently move Sherlock’s fringe away, softly caressing his skin with the tips of his fingers while he did so. Sherlock rested his cheek on John’s hand with a sigh, eyes closed. He allowed himself to press his nose to the warm skin of John’s wrist, taking a deep breath, enjoying the smell he now knew was just for him and him alone.
“That was fast Johnny! Did you miss me?” John grunted and approached the desk, avoiding answering. Jim leaned back in his chair, placing his feet on the wooden desk. He snorted, “Bah! You and Seb are always the same at communicating. Cavemen! There are more words in the dictionary than monosyllables."
But every new detail he learned was an added piece to his image of Sherlock. And instead of making him seem more unattainable, it had made him more human. He had made his fair share of mistakes, had chosen bad decisions, and had done things he regretted. They’d talked about past loves and regrets, but especially about the good things, because there would be plenty of time to wander through them all, and now was not the moment to dwell over sad affairs.
It seemed that the information was not well received, because Jim’s face transformed itself into an angry expression full of excessive violence and madness. John felt that he had just signed his death warrant. The gentle pull of the leash told him that he shouldn’t have said that.
returning down the hall, with a happy trot that he had not seen in years. He arched his eyebrows when he saw him appear, until he saw the ends of a long coat after him, whipping the legs of the one that was following after him in a hurry. He swallowed again when Greg’s badger left his lap quickly, at the same time that a black crow entered his room cawing, flying a few laps around in the air. John’s heart accelerated as he directed his gaze towards the planning bird, tracing perfect parabolas over him, before perching on the shoulder of a tall, thin, pale-skinned man. He could not have been more than thirty years old. He was certainly younger than him, or so it seemed. His thin lips were open, and his clear eyes were staring at him from the hospital’s door.
There was a negative intervention on Earth, that much was clear. He just wasn’t sure it was something so big there was a need for an Archangel to take the job.
“If you want to die, John, there are better and cleaner ways to achieve it rather than insulting him”, said Holmes. He dropped the leash and threw him a ball full of white clothes. “Put this on. Fast. We need to be in Buckingham in half an hour.”
“Well, let’s check what’s wrong, shall we?” Mycroft asked, and the changing sounds told John he had just lifted her from the cot, or wherever she was sleeping.
After a day with no results, and no sight of the Archangel, he decided to stay. The feeling of wrongness hadn’t left him yet. Now he had something interesting to focus onto! He wasn’t going to let go so easily.
He got to a train station, Watson’s memories already filling most of the blanks of his own knowledge of human interaction and recent history, as well as technological developments. The fusion would need time to settle down, as well as his glamour. Flying was no use now.
was too far away from Buckingham, and he didn't remember having received any beating worthy of a transfer to Bart’s.
He took John’s forgotten erection in one hand, stroking in time with the movement of their hips as the doctor started moving against him, too. John’s answering moan was loudest in that moment, and accompanied a bunch of incomprehensible talk that, Sherlock guessed, was all praise.
He heard a soft humming noise and then nothing but the slowing beat of John’s heart. He swallowed and took the knife out with as much care as he could. Then he threw it away, and walked straight to the black car, not even glancing at the unconscious body of the suspect on the floor, covered in mud and other disgusting elements. Anthea lifted her eyes from her BlackBerry to look at him, awaiting orders.
This is why, at twelve years of age —when Sherlock announced that he had dreamed with the sand-colored wolf—, a giant celebration was done in his home. Specifically because it was quite premature. People his age did not have the dreams that early. People his age did not usually have symptoms of dystopia. But that didn’t matter.
The man in front of him was every inch the angel he had once being. Dark, luscious curls, as shiny as raven feathers. He could remember clearly how soft they were against his fingers. His cheeks, pale as always, were covered by a low flush, making him look so innocent. Lips parted slightly, as if he was going to speak and his grey eyes, like thunder, were now almost a clear blue. Like a newborn’s.
Holmes does actually say this in the canon story, but in a completely different context. It’s a nice little surprise for the insiders. There are a lot of surprises in “Shoscombe Old Place,” because about 75% of this episode is extrapolation. In most ways, the extrapolations improve the story, which I evidently found one of the least memorable. “Shoscombe Old Place” is the first of these episodes where the title actually recalled nothing to my mind. I had not even a vague memory of what happens in that story. So I looked it up, and started reading it, and a few paragraphs in I was like, “Oh, yeah, dead sister, OK, I remember.”
("Noble Bachelor" meets "Veiled Lodger"). These are, let's say, uneven. I will include links to all five film reviews, with snippets, in this chapter.
This is important, because it explains Holmes’s growing admiration for Irene Adler as something other than a sexual attraction. Holmes does comment on her beauty, but when an evidently surprised Watson repeats, “A face a man might die for?!” he dismisses it as “a metaphor.” For him, her beauty is not superficial; it’s the outward sign of more intangible qualities. There’s a moment early on when Holmes, disguised as an alcoholic and unemployed groom, is watching Irene Adler’s house and hears her singing. Irene Adler is identified in canon as a contralto. They actually found a contralto to do the singing. Her voice is beautiful, strong, and lower than you would expect; and Holmes is immediately taken by it. When the still-disguised Holmes finds himself drawn into the secret wedding, and she calls him over afterward to give him a sovereign, he is genuinely touched by her generosity–not just in giving him the coin, but in protecting his dignity by calling it a “souvenir.” During the “fire” scene, Holmes (as the poor old parson) has a conversation with Irene Adler about motives in which she rather pointedly tells him that she “cannot imagine” being motivated by a desire for revenge, and he obviously believes her. By the end of the episode, when Holmes says that Irene Adler is “on a very different level to your Majesty,” he doesn’t just mean that she’s smarter; he means that in basically every way she is a
OK, we know Sir Robert, despite being a ladies’ man, has never married; and we know he’s already got a thing going with Carrie. The question arises: just how close did this trio get during the time of the deception?
In case you didn’t notice, Senora Durango is lying the middle of a cruciform spotlight. The candelabra and the black-robed Lucas who’s drawing her blood with the point of his knife complete the whole “black mass” vibe here. The alienation of Murillo is completed when, as he’s leaving the room, he announces that he’s immortal, and catches sight of his reflection:
Why paper specifically? Well, first of all, there’s a lot of it about. Holmes lives in a world where an information revolution is indeed taking place, but the only way people still really have of
The premise of this episode–that Holmes has pushed himself to the point of physical collapse, and Watson has hauled him out to Cornwall to nurse him back to health–tragically coincides with some of the things happening in Brett’s life at around this time. I’m sure that history is well known to anyone who’s reading these reviews, so I won’t rehearse it here. It’s sad watching this and thinking about the fact that at this point, Brett didn’t even have ten years left to live. But that’s part of the story, as this episode tells it: we’re all dying, and sometimes the best thing we can do is embrace that knowledge instead of running from it.
One has the impression that Hawkesworth might have decided, back in the early 80s, to hold “Boscombe Valley” in reserve. It’s a comparatively early story, written back when Doyle and Holmes were still making their reputations; and it’s longer and more complex than many others, so it lends itself better to episodic TV. But whereas delay was, as I’ve lamented, pretty much fatal for
So Eurus is basically half Hannibal Lecter and half Ophelia. I mean the Ophelia connection was always obvious. Not only is her entire life a mad scene, not only does she spend her entire life wittering about in white nightclothes with mad preraphaelite hair (which is supposed to be her own? though she has much shorter hair as John’s shrink?), but she’s played by Sian Brooke, who was Ophelia in the famous Benedict Cumberbatch
The best scene from the Switzerland trip is the conversation after Holmes gets the note telling him Moriarty has escaped. Holmes tries to get Watson to go home, for his own safety. The canon story doesn’t report what Watson says in response, only that this “was hardly an appeal to be successful with one who was an old campaigner as well as an old friend.” Hawkesworth lets Watson articulate, to a limited extent, some of what’s compressed into that line: “I’m not leaving you, Holmes. Not unless you order me to go.” Holmes looks back at him; and he doesn’t give the order. Watson’s just dared Holmes to break up with him; Holmes has acknowledged that he can’t stand to do it. This situation is its own emotional maelstrom; but all we actually
Well, it’s not what it looks like. They haven’t been finally convicted of burglary; they’ve just stepped into an empty cell, while visiting Miss Grace Dunbar in prison, so that Watson can pitch his theory of who killed Mrs. Gibson and how to Holmes. This conversation completely does not happen in canon; it is one of the many little tasty bon-bons offered to the faithful Granada fan by veteran adapter Jeremy Paul’s script. Paul adapted “Naval Treaty,” “Speckled Band,” “Wisteria Lodge,” and “Musgrave Ritual”; and if you look at his track record you can see that he has a healthy respect for the canon stories but is also not afraid to, let’s say, enhance them by making some significant changes (as he does in “Musgrave Ritual” and “Wisteria Lodge”). In his expansion of “Thor Bridge,” Paul gives us loads of what has worked for this show so far: more and better Watson, Holmes facing off against asshole millionaire clients, and–of course!–Jeremy Brett handling paper:
“I should have hit you more,” Watson says serenely, then thinks about how he hadn’t so much as slapped him upon his return and amends his statement, “I should have hit you
Mass texts of “Sherlock lives” and then they’re in a bedroom with Mary and John. Mary is reading from John’s blog as he lathers up in the bathroom. She teases him about shaving off the moustache.
John smiles and continues his journey down, lathering kisses and small sucks across Sherlock’s collarbone, feeling the nudge of the bone which didn’t quite set right when Sherlock broke it and refused to go to hospital for treatment. John makes sure to lick and caress that place excessively before moving down and taking one of Sherlock’s nipples into his mouth.
When John reached down between their bodies to grasp Sherlock’s cock, the younger man’s eyes shot open in alarm.
That's it for this one! You can subscribe to one or both of us to see more works by us alone, or our continued joint efforts. There's already talks of something new, but no real idea of what yet, so no promises on a time. If you have any ideas for something you'd like to see us tackle, please let us know!
Sherlock’s brow furrows as he calms down fairly quick. He seems to be reliving snippets of the nightmare before his entire being sags further in to the sofa tiredly.
“Sherlock?” John asked quietly, not wanting to get his hopes up; he had learned from a life full of disappointments how much false hope can hurt.
He tries to get out again, but to no avail; Sherlock still has him locked in. John attempts to call Sherlock's phone but he won’t answer. There are more noises and John makes his way to one of the empty cages for some semblance of safety, covering his own mouth to try to stop any noises that might attract the hound to him.
"She has no firewood," Sherlock parrot's back grumpily, flopping back into his chair gracelessly, "So I'm soon to be bored
David joins him at the sinks, turning one on and reminding John he still needs to do the same, “He’s a detective; how has he missed that you like guys?”
“Sherlock!” John shouted, seizing up and throwing back his head as his orgasm burst over him and left him wrung out and shaking. Semen glistened on his stomach and when Sherlock pulled back, he did so tentatively before looking at John with a grimace.
“You mean does John, like me, not see the point in getting a license because of all the convenient public transportation that’s available?”
Sherlock’s brow creases in uncertainty, so John slowly moves his face towards his with clear intent, hand still on his chin to steady them both. John is giving him time to realize what’s going on and back away; he’s taking the risk to finally clear things up. It suddenly becomes vitally important to Sherlock that he take an active role in these proceedings to show his absolute willingness, so he surges forward, eyes closed, and relishes the quiet moan that John makes.
“I’m sorry, but,” he chuckles again, smile holding strong, “did you just say you think that watching these DVDs would mess with the space-time continuum?” He finishes, looking as though nothing in the world has ever been funnier to him.
“Oh, it’s just a murder; doubt you’d find it interesting,” he shouts back to them, never faltering in his progress towards the front door. Before either man can say anything more, the door slams shut downstairs.
There's confusion, drama, angst, murder, all finished off with a happy ending somehow. I hope you can make it to that part.
“But I want…” Sherlock trailed off all on his own, still a bit shy in expressing his direct wants at times.
John makes some odd exhaling sound that is neither an affirmative or negative, “In the morning. For now, come to bed.”
“Are you ready?” John asked, cautiously pulling his hand away from Sherlock’s bum and wiping the lube onto the bedding as he stroked up and down Sherlock’s thighs, “You’re in charge; whatever you need.”
we think you’re together? Jesus Christ, you two fit better than most married couples I’ve seen!” Alan adds with a smile that adds a silent
As improper as it was - equal parts folly and blind madness - I reached up to kiss him then. I caught him a bit off guard, this man who misses very little, but within moments he was pressing his mouth firmer to mine as I felt his hands on my back pull me closer.
“Sherlock fancies Princess Anne,” John began singing, high pitched and giddy, “Did you love her? Did you snog her?”
John smiles brightly as he lifts a corner to allow the other man to join him, then does his best to secure said corner under Sherlock to seal the heat in as efficiently as possible. They are pressed chest to chest tightly, noses almost touching as they stare into each other’s eyes and try to deduce if the moment is gone - if the magical world of No Rules forged by the scotch has been lost.
John moved his mouth slowly down Sherlock’s body, pausing briefly to play with his nipples this time, only pausing when he had reached the top of his trousers again. Undoing the flies for the second time that evening, he lowered pants and trousers down at the same time, aiding Sherlock in lifting one foot and then the other to free himself of the cloth.
Sherlock’s confusion causes him to momentarily forget his unwillingness to dance, “Really, John, that makes absolutely no sense.”
“Watson,” the younger man says gently, instinct urging him to reach out and place his right hand overtop the other’s left, “you know how this ends.”
Watson, with sudden clarity, sees that Sherlock is in love with John. For the first time, he allows himself to wonder if maybe that means Holmes feels the same for him as he’s been feeling for Holmes.
And that, dear reader, is a moment I would like to never forget but could never dream of immortalizing in The Strand. I just hope that whenever it is that you are reading this, you can accept the love that Holmes and I have held for each other these many, happy years.
With a slow shaking hand, Sherlock placed the heel of his palm over his cock. The layers of cloth between his skin dulled the pleasure slightly, but Sherlock wasn’t quite bold enough - nor far gone enough - to reach inside to grasp himself. It had been 10, maybe 15 years since he had even
So with a deep breath I move back to the stage and place the sheet music in its envelope, my violin in its case.
In that one moment, my dreams that never even had the chance to become reality were crushed, never to be realized. The dream, above all, that I could hold you and call you mine.
“Good,” Sherlock said around John’s shaft, seemingly talking to himself as he began to stroke the bottom of John’s prick in time with his mouth. He was doing well,
My heart leapt at the endearment and I knew that I could not continue living like this, ever wondering if there was maybe something more between us than friendship.
Neither Holmes nor Watson can look away, entranced by this perspective of one of their most life-altering moments as friends and colleagues.
“Or that some of us no longer run around chasing after danger like you do,” Alan reasons with a knowing smile.
“God, the way he’s put this whole thing together is almost masterful if it weren’t so twisted,” Watson admires begrudgingly of the “show”.
, you arse!” John yells as he stands from his chair to confront his friend, “So you what? Decided you didn’t want to do the mission and off yourself instead?”
“He was trying so hard to give John the clues he needed to piece it together himself, so he wouldn’t need to spell out every last detail and hurt him,” Holmes marvels at his counter-part’s sentimentality.
Back to Sherlock and John in the cab where John is giving him advice, which Sherlock appears to be ignoring.
Drugged Sherlock is back in the motorist crime scene with Irene as she walks through how it must have happened. Then Sherlock appears to be transported back to his bed where, of course, he’s actually been the entire time since she broke in to his room at the flat.
Cut back to Henry, fighting sleep at his house; he’s so exhausted but every time he closes his eyes he gets flashes of the past that startle him back awake.
“Of course, I always take my coat,” Sherlock answers before looking up in confusion, “are you not taking yours?”
In fact, in the few instances through the night where they spoke, Sherlock was the one to initiate the conversations. They weren’t long or overly intelligent conversations, but a distinct back and forth in their sleep.
The words echo those which Holmes had said before Lestrade entered the flat and the two men look at each other from the corners of their eyes briefly.
“Sod this,” John mutters, removing himself from above Sherlock as gracefully as one can in his position, “I’m fucking freezing.”
“That’s why I needed to create this potion. Not to know what love feels like, but to know truthfully if what I was feeling for you was it. Well, it is and I’ll tell you something I didn’t expect: love bloody
With a relieved sob, Sherlock lowers his face to John’s knee and wraps his hands around the outside of John’s legs for support, subconsciously avoiding the new wound on the inner calf.
Holmes turns to look at Watson’s face, but the older man does not return the gesture, simply stares resolutely at the screen. They watch as Sherlock asks John what he’d say if he were dying, the genuine – if quick - look of regret afterwards, Sherlock’s belittling of an entire room as he explains his findings, and then as he follows the murderer out of the flat without so much as a code word to anyone.
over her. He loved Mary, yes, but Holmes is the one he wants to share the rest of life’s adventures with.
“So, at the risk of being essentially turned down once more, I’m going to ask again,” Sherlock starts nervously, but allowing John to see the sincerity in his eyes, “John Hamish Watson, will you accept this ridiculous life we lead over all others and marry me?”
Mycroft sighs before turning Holmes’ chair to face them and sitting down, “As far as we can tell, they’re from an alternate 2015.”
Sherlock is unable to deduce the naked woman across from him; far too little to go on. Irene infers that John loves Sherlock based on the location of his punch earlier. John laughs humorlessly and asks her to put clothes on as a response.
Sherlock confronts the attacker and Magnussen corrects him: it’s not Lady Smallwood. She turns and, inexplicably, Mary is standing in front of him, aiming a gun at his chest.
When Sherlock realizes the position they’re in, he scoots back just enough to look at John’s face. His breath catches as his eyes portray his concern.
“No. No I -- I don’t think it’s for me,” Sherlock said in a hurry, taking another sip of his alcohol with a wince.
John closed his eyes contentedly, smile only growing more fond, before turning his face back towards the ceiling, “You’re an idiot.”
“John?” Sherlock asks, a bit of nervousness in his tone at the thought that John may refuse to continue the experiment.
Holmes used to go through these phases, too, but they have blessedly diminished in frequency over the years. They would drive Watson mad just the same as they appear to do John.
The touch of lips is electric - dizzying. John moves his hands to frame Sherlock’s face and pull him yet closer. It is a kiss full of love and need and speaks volumes of time wasted.
kissed a man; never for a romantic or sexual reason, but sometimes using his looks was the best way to find out information on cases. Not that Sherlock would like to admit that, of course…
insisted,” he said pointing at his mother, “Although I should have known; cross dressing runs in her family.”
John sniffs while moving his mouth in a small circle, making his nose twitch from side to side. It’s adorable, but Sherlock won’t mention it.
Sherlock arrives back in the living room just a few minutes before John discovers him there, pacing.
until right now. I thought Mycroft was just taking the piss with you since you refused to wear pants in Buckingham Fucking Palace.”
“John, please,” Mycroft practically whispered, his voice finally breaking into a genuine emotion, “he needs you.”
Sherlock barely has any freckles on his right arm at all, but he places a kiss to the one midway up the radial bone, then gently turns the arm so his palm is facing the ceiling to kiss the sole freckle just below the crease of his elbow. So close to where needle tracks used to be much more visible. Those are marks that John is not at all sorry to see go. He places a reverent, thankful kiss to the healing area, as well.
Sherlock’s eyes moved rapidly back and forth as he deduced, finally finding the answer, “Afghanistan,” he said in understanding, not even a question.
Holmes looks at him in a considering way, as if he’s overlooked something about the other man all this time.
“Oh, Captain, my Captain,” they chorus in unison, standing at parade rest with shit-eating grins on their faces.
“Mummy will ask questions. Be as vague as possible,” Sherlock warned, turning to look at John, “And don’t ask questions about my childhood, as she will insist on getting the photo albums out.”
When the sun begins to fade (what little was making it through the storm that's still raging), John stands to light some candles, a bit unnerved now that the power isn't back on. He turns the switch on the desk lamp as a guide for them to know when it returns.
“Anything interesting?” John asked, taking a sip of his tea, “You've just finished a case; you can't be working on another already.”
Sherlock takes a deep breath as he turns back to John and announces loudly, to the entire restaurant, “I am in love with this man,” he gestures vaguely to the incredibly shocked John Watson before him, “The truth is I have been for a long time and I refuse to hide it anymore.”
Sherlock realized he was staring too much when John’s smile turned cheeky, and he fought the blush rising on his face.
When the news of a new order reached every corner of Great Britain, John thought it would be some type of trick from the radicals that some old glory would be trying to regain the position and change the things a bit up. When everything began to change and the people began to disappear from the streets, when the dystopians began to get marked and ‘reassigned’ to another area of the city, in his head the ‘Leader’ had always looked like an extremely intelligent adult. However, the person that he had in front of him was… disappointing.
As John moved away, his feet slipped and he fell face first into the bathtub. He barely had time to gasp and get some air before he was… falling inside the seemingly bottomless bathtub.
A sob came from the monitor and he frowned, almost in distress. He was sure that even if he tried the door would be firmly locked, and not even his new vampire skills would get him out of it. So there was nothing he could do to check on his daughter. John was just starting to feel anxious, the sobbing growing louder, when the sound of moving sheets returned.
John didn’t even think about it. Had he done so, he would have probably not done it, but Ethan Scott was getting on his nerves...
On the other side of the room, John grabbed the whimpering man by his neck, raising him from the floor and pinning him to the wall. The man’s face was a mess of drool and tears, the incarnation of fear itself.
Mycroft arrived at night when the street lamps began to light up. If he was surprised to see his malnourished brother sleeping on his sofa, he did not comment on it. He left the briefcase with the reports he had to write for the next morning on the kitchen table and began to prepare some dinner for Sherlock. Luckily, he had eaten something secretly before returning because God knew his brother needed it more than him.
The wolf’s fur was a pale tone, it looked as if it were clear honey; it was sprinkled with white in the tips in areas where it became darker, behind the ears and in the edges of the lower back. The blue eyes of the animal followed all of his movements while it scurried around with its hanging tongue, sniffed the air with his snout, and moved his pointed ears backward and forwards. He observed the wolf from above. His most recurring fantasy was of flying, he always felt comfortable with the idea of rising over everything else. Sometimes, he dreamed that he was a fierce and daring pirate, but he couldn’t compare the freedom of flying with being a fierce pirate that was feared.
There was no need to answer. John’s train of thought seemed to be rather slow at the moment, but maybe the only thing he was looking for was reassurance.
He had sometimes seen symptoms like those, in the shelters of the dystopians which stood in the outskirts of the ‘Lion Den’. They were located under the bridges in the banks of the Thames to assist those who were wounded, but the few that were able to escape from the ‘clean’ side after being captured and separated from their animals. It was the distance, the pain inflicted to their other side or their spirit, which caused the physical pain. And the same thing was happening to him. He wondered what they were doing with the animal of this poor dystopian, and where it was located. And how long it had been there.
Hands were suddenly pushing him away,  fast and efficient, making him disentangle from the body of the Archangel. When his arse hit the wet ground, he winced and opened his eyes.
is. Been here that long?” His tone was suspicious. Had Sherlock been walking around on the Creation for a while now? How long? How had he gone unnoticed? How hadn’t
John’s hand squeezed Sherlock’s for a second before leading the way. The ceiling was covered in white, cold light lamps. They were small, like stars hanging from the intricate structure created by branches full of blooms and white flowers. The room’s illumination was soft, supported by a glass lantern in the centre of the ceiling almost covered by the natural decorations, just enough to avoid direct light to penetrate in the area, and helping create an almost dream-like ambiance.It looked intimate, all tables placed to offer maximum privacy in the small room. There was a stone fireplace, the flames providing both dim light and comfortable heat.
Grabbing John’s head and the hair at his nape and pulling back to separate from him was the most difficult thing Sherlock had done in a very,
Condemned as he was, his body was essentially flesh and bone. His spirit had been bound to an eternal existence inside a human body that could not age or decay. But he was very much capable of feeling pain and pleasure. Which was not very welcome taking in consideration that Hell was made of ice and fire, and there was a giant flame burning at the top of his head.
The suspect was behind John, his taller body pressed against his mate’s back. One of his arms was around John’s neck, pressing but not choking. His phone was on the floor, the screen broken and black.
“I wish I had told you sooner. Maybe you would have left me afterwards and you wouldn’t have died in that alley. You’d be safe with Rosie at some other place.
His tone was neutral, as if he couldn’t care less. John was not as surprised as he felt he should be.
Sherlock’s eyes rolled inside his skull when he felt teeth close around his other nipple, sucking and licking the trapped skin while busy fingers tugged on his shirt and pulled it free of his trousers.
situations. That thought sent a warm shiver down his spine, the tingle installing itself low in his stomach. He growled when John exhaled over his mouth, lapping at his lower lips for a second before taking it between his teeth and pulling. A sudden wave of pheromones hit Sherlock fully then, and he had to focus on how his hands clutched John’s shirt and nothing else because if he didn’t calm himself, they wouldn’t even get to cross that threshold.
A sense of failure descended slowly upon him. How was a murder so hard to solve? Specially a teen’s? Back in the old days, he would have already found the reason behind all of this. John felt like he was broken and defective. What was happening to him?
The police left and he scaled the wall quietly to sneak into the boy’s room. Jordan, as his parents had called him, seemed like any regular english teen, he thought, once he flew through the open window with his wings. There were several football posters around, bands, and pictures of friends. It was cleaner than he thought a teenager’s room would be, but he guessed his parents had tidied it up. That, and the police probably had taken evidence already.
Right now, in the luxurious room, being baroque until it was enough, Holmes had made him have a bath. The simple smell of soap made him want to cry. It was real soap and not soap made up of grease and caustic soda, which was harsh and unpleasant. The water in the bath was also warm, without the need of being boiling against his skin by the heat of the fire, or freezing and being from the Thames, which happened when the gas broke down. And when he was little he never wanted to have a bath…
He could hear Sherlock nearly purring. “Oh, John. You’d look delicious. Had you been on my ship, I would have promoted you to be my Quartermaster. You would’ve been so good, so disciplined. I can only imagine how skilled you’d be with a sword. I would have looted for you the best arms, the finest fabrics. I would have covered you in bloody gold. Everyone would have known about the fearsome John Watson.
John sat on the floor in the middle of the room, legs crossed under him and closed his eyes. He focused on the energy it had, a reminiscence of its previous inhabitant. The explosive energy of Jordan was all around, impregnating every corner. And yet, it was not what John was looking for. He was trying to find something darker. Something dangerous and unsteady...
John nodded his head and slowly lowered himself down onto Sherlock’s cock. The vampire was holding himself in place so John had better leverage to work comfortably and had to muffle a moan when he felt the tip of his head pressing against John’s entrance. John gasped and pressed down harder, and suddenly Sherlock’s cock was sliding inside, the lube smoothing the process. It was fascinating how John’s muscles seemed to suck him in and yet how tight it felt, even if he had double checked John’s readiness first. John’s preparation had been thorough and Sherlock had done almost nothing else besides making sure everything was in place, plus a bit of foreplay.
As they hadn’t been very rich, he had just a few things he cared enough about to keep over the years: some paintings from his mother’s family, his mother’s only necklace, and his father’s hunting knife. The rest had either gone to Mycroft or was lost. He had sometimes tried to cook some of the old recipes he remembered by taste and smell, taking the internet instructions as a starting point. But it didn’t matter how much he tried, or how many different recipes he followed, the food simply wasn’t the same. This restaurant was one of the few places where he had been able to go back to those times again.
When Mycroft was drunk he would not evade the questions. When Mycroft was drunk he answered to all of the questions. And they were usually truthful.
The kiss was tender, sweeter than the last one had been. Any hurry or lust lost the moment John’s hunger had been satisfied. Sherlock couldn’t resist taking a taste of blood form John’s lips and tongue, finding a residual, honey like taste of John’s venom. He shivered, discovering the flavour difference between John’s and his own very telling. While he was acid and almost liquid, John was luscious and thick.
Sherlock turned his head on the pillow to look at John, hopeful. His mate smiled, the soft light coming from the only window in the room made it look like a fantasy. Unreal.
He turned, eyes sharp when he heard John’s ice-calm voice. He was aware, suddenly, of the beating of two hearts. Stupid, so stupid.
He could not stop dwelling over his head, thinking what could Jim possibly want from him. He had heard stories about what they were doing to the dystopians in Buckingham, but he preferred to think that they were just that: stories. Holmes led him to the lift and both were alone in the metal space as they descended to the ground floor.
Oh, yeah. In all those years he had not forgotten the face, much less the name. How could anyone forget one as pompous as him?
After they finished dessert, John insisted on paying for both of them. Sherlock knew John wanted to make a gesture for him, and that he had been saving for this. Which only made his guts twist even more inside of him, desire and affection both terribly mixed.
“You never called me Morning Star. Not even once.  Now, after all this time, all I hear when you call me is the name everyone knew me by. As if I was some kind of stranger to you.”
A lightweight, comforting, settled on top of him, and he felt the familiar shape of his wolf’s head resting on top of his chest. He moved a hand, feeling it heavy and half dead, until it rested on
Morning Start’s glamour began to fade, burned by John’s projected Grace. Little by little, he bared his naked feet, covered in ashes and dust, followed by dark robes and a pair of black horns surging from amongst his hair. A fire blazed at the top of his hair, viciously licking the curled horns around it. He saw grey eyes turn dark and brilliant,wetness filling them.
They held hands waiting for a taxi outside the restaurant’s door, standing as close as they could to each other. The ride to Baker Street was much the same, both sitting close, hands still held tightly, and both whispering softly in the back.
He had spent a whole week locked in an interrogation room from the era where the television in color was invented and tinted glasses were necessary to maintain the identity of spying listeners safe. The room was gray and aseptic. The walls were made up of cement and brick, and in the center there was a drain. He would rather not want to imagine the reason why an interrogation room would need such thing, although he perfectly knew too well the answer to the question. His ash blond hair was long, it uncomfortably stuck to his forehead and began to rub on his irritated eyes as it fell forward. His head itched from the dirtiness stuck to it, which didn't help with him being dead cold. There were air currents that would enter through the vents, through the holes in the wall, and through the small space under the door, which was barely a few millimeters wide. And in addition to all of the harsh environment, he was naked. His clothes had been stripped off his body when he got to this place. He was forced to walk through the corridors as if he were an exhibit, until he reached to the place where he currently was. However, the only part of his body that was covered were his eyes, with a thick plush bandage. He assumed that it was necessary so that he wouldn't be able to remember the path that he was forced to walk, minimizing the risk of him possibly escaping. At one point he was able to inform himself that his possessions had been burned off.
Shinny, polished shoes appeared in his field of vision and he felt the electric presence behind him when the man crouched next to him.
A couple of minutes later, the convulsions turned into shivers and then John’s heart, tired and subdued, simply stopped beating.
With a mess of limbs, adventurous hands, and a single racing heart, they struggled upstairs, kicking shut flat B’s door and managed to fall on Sherlock’s bed, shoes already off, and jackets almost there. They didn’t even bother with the lights, too busy touching each other. The light coming from the street lamps through the window would have to suffice.
He felt the cold of the cotton with medical alcohol cleaning the area of the puncture, and gritted his teeth before he felt the sharp sting in the ear from the needle that contained the locator chip, and a flash of pain that ran down his spine. He resisted the urge to kick Holmes to get rid of him.
The person on the floor had his head covered with a black bag and his hands tied firmly to his back with a lace. The figure (a man most likely, based on the general body features) was whimpering softly, murmuring nonsense. There was something oddly familiar about him, but John couldn’t quite put his finger on it. He hoped the guy was not someone they knew. Sherlock wouldn’t do that, right?
“I think I might take the knight, but you are no princess in distress. Maybe the mysterious apothecary? Or the wise wizard? I’m not sure.”
The high ceilings were  naked grey stone, as were the floors. The latter covered by the occasional rug. It had a similar vibe to the old Scottish castles of the North. He was unsurprised to see that even though most of the lights were electric (including the oldest looking ones), there were some oil and  gas powered ones, too. John couldn’t resist trying to .turn one on.
But there was no disgust in Sherlock’s eyes, but a deep devotion. Everything that had maintained him alive, everything that he had fought for, all of that which made him give absolutely everything of himself. A sensation of triumph and mental peace filled him when he realized that, if it hadn’t been for the demolition of the wall, neither of them would probably be there at the moment. They wouldn’t be looking at each other. Probably the man in front of him would still be held prisoner in Buckingham, and he would remain locked in his lab, working with the
He heard a soft rustling sound, like the movement of sheets coming from somewhere, and he turned his head trying to locate the source. Soon Rosie’s babbling started. It was as if she was right beside him.
John blinked. Overwhelmed by the information, he looked down at his own hands as if they held all the answers to the unspoken questions currently flooding his head in no order whatsoever. Looking at the blue veins at his wrists, he frowned.
A year after entering Moriarty’s service in order to protect his group, the rebels and his own family, John would have felt revulsion for someone in his situation, and because now, after so many years of wear he had reached a point where he had really stopped caring if anything dangerous happened to his body. He sincerely hoped that the situation that he was in would change someday. That the madness he was surrounded in would disappear and everything would go back to how it was before Jim changed him, but he knew it was nothing but a dream. And dreams were for children.
Sherlock rested his cheek against John’s chest and placed his left hand over his belly, fingers tracing random patterns.
The leash went back to his neck, tying him to the ground, however, the electronic shackles didn’t come back. John raised an eyebrow when Holmes grabed a gun, similar to that of the tatooists that are going to insert a piercing, but with a round and flat lid that was colored in black around the trigger.
Sherlock voice was dreamy, eyes looking toward him without focus, as if he was watching something far away. There was such a reverent tone in his words. John felt transported to a place and a time he hadn’t ever had the chance to live in and yet he could picture it now quite vividly.
They had beans for breakfast when they finally woke up. So Sherlock decided, watching as John hummed and swayed as he cooked the beans and made some toasts, to call Mycroft, in hopes that he had a new prophecy for him.
Distressed and worried, he concentrated, almost taking the monitor to press it against his ear. Was something else going on he could not hear?
“Hurt him, and you won’t even have the chance to see the police”, Sherlock menaced, taking a cautious step forward.
The Chinese restaurant owner, a lovely, kind woman, told him he had seen the boy walk in late that night. After having some noodles, he had left, as if in a hurry. She had not called the police because she thought he might be worried of getting back home late. She told him Jordan looked like a nice kid. Not problematic at all.
He got to the last door, which he presumed, led to the bathroom. The kitchen sink water taps had been closed, so the only place he imagined the water could be coming from, was the closed bathroom.
“Jim wants to see you, Watson”, Ethan said, with a certain derision. He carried a rifle on his shoulder. He probably came from one of the lines that connected with the ‘Lion’s Den’.
“Our parents died, a long time ago. Father died first, when Mycroft left from Sussex to London wishing to become a tailor’s apprentice. He was one of the first to die from Tuberculosis. Mummy followed several years later.”
He felt  long legs wrap around his hips. The demon had crossed his feet behind him, talons pressing against his lower back, pushing John against him. He felt something crawl inside him as the soft, tender hands left his arm and wrist to press at his chest, nails scraping softly against him across the thin layer of cotton the shirt provided. Long fingers grasped the braces and pulled, making him hiss.
He still felt a little uncomfortable with the presence of large, friendly-looking crowds. He had a bit of the feeling of a cornered animal, ready to bite. Only that a part of him knew that he should not.
When they made it to the restaurant, John paid to the driver before he had the chance to reach for his card, and then slipped out of the car to open Sherlock’s door for him. Surprised by the gentlemanly behaviour displayed by his friend, he took John’s offered hand and walked to the restaurant’s dining room.
There was one type of food that could probably save their lives, but in London it could only be found in the Royal Hospital, and they could clearly not access it.
He could feel the astral heat from Moran's Tiger at his side, walking with parsimony. Little by little, his vision got clearer, and was hardly aware of the cold metal floor of the freight lift. He waited quietly, watching the indicator. They were on the floor minus two, and they were heading to the tenth floor. He had plenty of time.
John had been a part-time emergency medic in the small hospital posts under the bridge, yes. However, he also was, and above all, a rebel.
John’s stomach contracted. He had been perfectly calm all day. The evening had been a wonderful time, cuddling Sherlock on  the sofa by the flames. They had been talking almost nonstop about Sherlock’s past. Now that there was no need to hide anything, John was eager to know everything Sherlock had lived to see, everything he’d gotten to experience.
When he awoke, Sherlock found himself in the ugly den of drug addicts in which he had gotten himself into a week ago. He was pale, puffy-eyed, and he could easily count his bones by only touching himself. A couple of junkies that gave no signs of breathing at his side were killed by an overdose and kept him company. He blinked, feeling his dry eyes, and could only think about the bound wolf. His soulmate was suffering, somewhere. He could feel it and he knew it.
When John began opening his shirt, kissing every new inch of skin till he finally reached one of his nipples, Sherlock found himself glad he had gotten rid of all of the spy cameras Mycroft had installed in the flat when John moved in. It would be highly embarrassing to find out some of his brother’s minions checked over this.
“It’s good to see you eating this well. Mycroft told me you would like this place,” John observed, smiling softly at him.
When the first dishes were served, Sherlock got caught up in the delicious smell of a perfectly prepared ratatouille, just as his aunt Marie made it when he was young, so many years ago. Surprised by the quality of the food, he got lost in the taste. His memories of old times, when life was different and easier, were all Sherlock had left.
“Da?” There was no answer this time either, so she must have turned to Mycroft because John heard her move and hit something soft (probably Mycroft’s chest or arm), demanding attention.
“Alright, Sherlock. If I discover that you are the one messing around, be sure I’ll fulfil my duty. As I should have a very long time ago. Make sure you get out of my way.”
Sherlock found John’s eyes, the calmness in his body hid the distress in his eyes. He couldn’t move, there was no way out. He tried to reassure him, but he wasn’t seeing an easy way out. He moved to fast, John died. He moved too slow, John died.
It was the nicest of moments, and John would find himself visiting this memory again from time to time, in the future. Whenever he had doubts, whenever he missed them, whenever he felt like something wasn’t enough.
He was good at it, and managed to keep Rosie properly still and distracted while he cleaned her and removed the offensive cloth, but when the smell hit? It was nauseous, to say the least. He learned to have a trashcan just under the nursery changing station they had arranged so he could roll the dirty nappy up fast and dispose of it efficiently. The cleaning and preparation for the new one were much easier. And Rosie thanked him with some giggles, so it was all fine.
Silence took over, only the sounds of his mate’s dying heart and the car’s engine left. Not long after,  John’s chest softly convulsed a couple of times, desperately trying to breathe with a flooded lung and no energy. Sherlock held him firmly against his chest, whispering sweet calming things into his ear, hoping it might help.
“Mrs. Hudson, I'm coming in”, he said, raising his voice. He took a step back, his already waisted shoes completely covered by water. He got his good shoulder ready, and charged against the door.
Sherlock laughed in turn, and buried his face on John’s shoulder, feeling the feverish skin of his directly against his forehead.
Uncomfortable with the question, nearly as much as Lestrade, he decided that changing the subject was more than a welcoming opportunity for both of them so he asked Greg how he had arrived to the hospital.
He sneaked into the building quietly and quickly, avoiding being seen. Officially, Sherlock Holmes had died two years ago from an overdose of cocaine. That was the way his brother had given him some freedom. If someone is dead then, you are not looking after them nor you threaten them. If someone has nothing to lose, then they cannot be coerced. So to some extent, Mycroft had become immune to their Leader.
, who had come through the window, crouched into his chest. He deposited a cluster of splendid purple grapes in front of his face, pushing them with its long ebony beak. Sherlock thanked him, as always, and stroked its chest with his finger. However, this time there would be no one to share the spoils.
He grabbed his Sig Sauer and shot him in the leg, outside of the zone occupied by the bone. The bullet entered and exited cleanly, piercing his flesh. He placed the gun back to his belt and when he entered the living room, he found him at a desk, surrounded by the paperwork.
John gulped. The sweet smell of something was slowly filling the air and he felt immediately hungry, ravenous. It reminded him of Afghanistan and the days when his patrol had to wait at the outpost for supplies from base camp. Days when water was the only thing they had until food arrived and, starving as they were, they still knew they had to ration. This moment was the same, more or less frustrated hunger entwined with gluttony.
John’s voice was soft, almost a whisper. His arms were tight and firm around Sherlock. Whether to offer comfort, simply keep him close, or to ground him to the present while his mind was so far away, he wasn’t sure. The detective was quiet again now and John felt as if he had opened a memory box he should have left alone.
“‘If I’m responsible’? I knew you were slow, John. But I was expecting more from you. You know what you’ve seen. Don’t let your own prejudices stain the logic of the events laid before you. It’s pedestrian.”
Jim brought him to a room where a double bed lay. Morgan’s tiger was lying in a corner, and John looked for him around the room, without success. He would probably not be far off. Perhaps he was standing guard at one of the gate, in case he tried anything. When Jim tied the strap to the bed and then held him, tying his hands on either side of the headboard, and his feet to the legs, when he began to feel something akin to panic. He frantically sought a way out, a way to escape, but all of them went with assaulting Jim if he could even break free, and all of them confronted the security when he would leave the room. He tried to regulate his breathing, remembering the words of Mycroft. ‘
He had always thought that he could be happy. That he would find the a way to avoid the dangers of the world until he could find his other half, but now that the darkness had bitten him, tearing and dragging him to the shadows, he felt as part of it. How would anyone want to love him after that, even if it were his other half? Why would anyone waste their time in piecing something that was so broken that he himself couldn't recognize? He could hear his wolf howling in the distance, expressing his pain.
It was intoxicating, and if his stomach could’ve growled, it would have already. He would’ve loved to close his mouth and pierce John’s skin to have a taste of the ambrosia hiding there. But it was not the time.
“If I didn’t know better, I’d say you just had the best sexual encounter of your life,” he commented, sounding almost bored. A deep sniff made his fangs tingle inside his mouth. There it was again. John reeked of attraction and seduction pheromones. How predictable. Sherlock dropped the pencil he had been chewing, and followed John as he hung his coat on the hook near the flat’s entrance.
A faint trail caught his attention. It was a certain smell of sulphur and ashes he knew too well. Demons were the only creatures capable of such trails. The sweet, overwhelming smell lying beneath, though, was another matter entirely. He had never smelled anything like it. It was like a dying rose.
The rumbling sound of Mycroft came through the speaker, interlaced with Rosie’s cries. It was strange how John was able to separate all of the sounds, as if he was receiving them individually instead of all together from a single source. Even the interference of the monitor was a different tune.
He would then finish his drink and go to bed, rubbing his temples. The days would pass on without any noticeable changes. Sherlock never went to high school or to university. Everything that he had learned was through practice or through the chemistry books that his brother secretly brought from the 'clean' side of the city. Sometimes, Barton Church a science teacher who could no longer teach and who lived in one of the nearby buildings gave him some books. His license and title had been withdrawn for being a dystopian. Sherlock continued learning and asking his brother the same question again and again. However, he only did it when it seemed that Mycroft came in better spirits within his everlasting anger at himself and the world. He never got an answer.
Sherlock growled and ripped the smelly t-shirt from the man’s neck, hearing his whimpers and cries of confusion.
Infinite thanks again to Ami, the loveliest beta in the world. She always finds a bit of time for correcting my disasters <3
He watched everything from one of the branches over the wolf, waiting to see that there was nobody that could attack him. Everything about the place reeked of being a trap. However, the pitiful yelping of the animal started to break him inside, so without thinking, he glided until he stopped on the floor in front of him, studying the chain, looking for an opening. The wolf looked at him and cried, stretching out to its maximum height, begging for his help. The crow pecked at the bonds without success, and only managed to hurt itself. However, he stayed with the wolf, watching and thinking of a way to free him until he woke up.
They remained silent a bit longer, John’s body tense with the effort of remaining still, hands tightly clenched in fists.
After a lovely dinner at a fancy restaurant and a quiet conversation, they came back home and everything went smoothly. John no longer slept upstairs, but shared Sherlock’s bed, and they started the nursery construction on John’s old bedroom. And for three whole months, they were as happy as they could be.
Sherlock took a sip of his wine, eyes never leaving John’s. The wine was good, his taste buds singing from the wonderful offering. Just because he was a vampire did not mean he couldn’t enjoy the wonders of human food, even if it was useless for him. He saw how John’s pupils dilated and his heart raced for a minute.
The taste was bitter, not particularly charming, but it tasted so deeply of John that he groaned in pleasure. At last. Sherlock might not be able to drink from him, but if this was the closest he could get, he would be happy enough with it.
He approached him, walking slowly, at a requiem step, until he reached the blond man. Sherlock had never stopped to think about the gender or the physical aspect of his soulmate. Elements like these didn’t seem relevant to him, but he couldn’t deny that the vision was more than good: a solid body, blond and strong. Young and not too old. Stable. Reliable. Secure. Good. Brilliant. Soft. Royal. Golden. All of that was what his eyesight gave him. He could feel his heart racing too, and he sat on the edge of the bed, never loosing eye contact with his partner. He reached out a hand, unable to contain himself, and brushed his cheek, wiping a tear, feeling as his eyes watered as well. He laughed, unable to contain himself. It was all being so unreal...
John looked at him. Holmes watched at him from his position, alongside a window. His eyes were closed and his jaw was clenched.
He activated his senses all that he was capable of. Then he closed his eyes and concentrated in what he could perceive, cataloguing it in a way that made sense. Definitively, he was in a hospital. The beeping was rhythmic, steady. It had accelerated for a few moments, and then the beat began to slow down. Which this meant, in this case, was: hospital. Definitively.
His mate’s voice was low and came out nearly as a growl. Sherlock bit his lip, resisting the urge to grab John’s remaining clothes and rip them off. He liked how he looked in them too much.
It had been so long since he had wanted a touch like this. Since he had needed contact. John’s contact. John’s touch.
“Now I’m regretting making that reservation. Christ,” John said, breathless. Sherlock could sense his excitement shining out of him like a neon light, flashing with sexual desire. He didn’t need to look down to know John was exhibiting the proudest boner of his life. He smiled.
However, the scariest thing of all was that he had a machine that was able to tell who was the couple of who. And that was making everything scarier lately.
For John, it had always been the battlefield. The place in which he was closer to his core. A place in which he felt so alive and so adequate. Where he could protect humans, especially from themselves. It was not that he approved wars. He despised them. Humans killing other humans was wrong, not what it was meant to be. Still, there was good and kindness, and a protective instinct laying deep inside some of the soldiers. It was something worth protecting against the dark forces involved in feeding those wars.
Sherlock lowed himself, face to face to the man on the floor. He gave a brusque pull, hauling him up from the floor till he rested on his knees. It had been a while since he had taken any blood directly from a human, and even longer since he had taken any kind of chemical-compromised blood. He was sure he was going to get high because of this. John’s system might be able to purge and process the blood without side effects, but his couldn’t.
To both Sherlock and John’s surprise, they found Mycroft talking with a very relaxed Rosie sitting in his lap. The baby was holding his tie softly with her hands, looking at him with a mesmerised expression on her sweet face. Mycroft was telling her some kind of story, but not any average children’s story like
Jim opened his mouth and eyes, as if he were genuinely surprised with the information. As if he had never received it.
He hurried up, pushing the door open with his good shoulder, and holding the shopping bags a bit higher to avoid soaking them.
“We should get cleaned before we end up stuck together for eternity,” John commented. Sherlock growled, making no move to leave the bed or the position he was in, and his mate laughed.
He clenched his shackled hands. His poor wolf had been placed in a cage in the same room as him. The cage was electrified, creating a power grid that hurt his wolf if he tried to push his nose through the wire mesh. The animal was cowering in the small space, whimpering to the sounds of his owner suffering. He knew that he had to give up, he had to obey if he wanted to get away from all of this. However, at twenty-one years, he was hardly an adult in an unfavorable and unpleasant situation, and his youthful instinct told him not to escape in this situation. It told him to fight through it.
“I wasn’t sure,” John admitted. “And remember, I had kicked and beaten you badly and that was the main reason I was leaving. I still don’t believe you forgave me for that, by the way.”
John smiled. “Conflicted as fuck. When you died, I was grieving so badly. My psychologist was very convinced you and I had been dating because it was taking so long and was so intense. I noticed I wasn’t just grieving you, but all the things that could have been and couldn’t anymore, all of the ‘if I’ and ‘I should have.’ I was so close to knowing, to seeing it clearly. But then I met Mary, and it was comfortable and safe with her. And it was no use worrying about the past anymore.”
John had grown little during those seven years, and because of that he had been shorter than the majority of his colleagues working on Jim’s entourage. He was stronger and more agile, and he was able to keep fit by using the little free time that the Leader allowed him to continue training, and it was all as a reward for his work.
But now... with this new information... it looked like more. John’s warm steady hands on his back, on his nape, softly caressing his wrists and inside elbow, as if they were casual touches.
Sherlock started to walk very slowly to the left. If he could move fast enough to grab the arm holding the knife, maybe he would give John the chance to free himself.
When they reached the ground floor, Holmes snapped to attention and straightened up, changing his face. So much that had he not have been looking at him, John doubted that he would have been able to appreciate that under the mask of coldness, there was a man. He stepped forward, pulling the leash around his neck. The policemen that were standing at the entrance of the central parted, careful to not touch John. He couldn’t understand why there were so many objections against them when they wouldn’t have had any problem in throwing things at his head, insult him and push him when he had arrived the first time. He hadn’t seen their faces as he had his eyes bandaged, but he hadn’t moved from building to building in the whole week, so he was pretty sure that none of them had been absent that day.
A large crow, black and with bright eyes landed on his arm, it looked as physical as if it were real, albeit with a slight translucent tint. Sherlock reached into the room and closed the window again. The animal let out a squawk, leaving something with the beak on Sherlock's outstretched hand.
“Master” said a voice, dripping like honey. The woman, who seemed to be made of smoke, formed in front of him.
John gritted his teeth, without losing sight of Moriarty. He did not struggle, he didn’t move. He did not even try to escape when Jim bent down to untie the knot that tied the strap to the ground, and took the leash to pull him towards a pair of white doors on the other side of the room.
He quickly dialed Mycroft’s number, but the call was cut off. Then the phone buzzed with an incoming text.
John was hurting. He hadn’t known he could be capable of that. Not with him. The John he always knew had been a kind, loving soul. Always caring. But now, it was hard to see him under that hard and cold cover. His eyes ran over the Archangel, recognising the marks of past fights and ugly scars on a soul he had once seen as perfect, untouched. It was almost impossible to recognise his John in the being in front of him.
Night fell. John only noticed the passage of time because the light outside had changed again, and because he heard the sound of the gravel outside crunching underneath the tyres of a car. A steady thump accompanied it, and he rose carefully from the sofa, trying to get a good sight of the door.
Deep inside, he knew John would be just fine. The rate of success for human-to-vampire changing was extremely high, especially with vampires who’s enzymes had never been used. Like his. Maybe it was just the anticipation of John’s reaction upon awakening or that he was still altered after seeing him die. Regardless, the feeling in his gut was not leaving him. Not even knowing Mycroft would take care of Rosie helped.
“John, drink. I need you to drink,” he said, speaking softly and slowly, just as he did when Rosie was awakening.
“Not that kind of...” he sighed in defeat, shaking his head with a funny grin. “I think it might be this place. The low light, the flowers everywhere... it’s like we’re in a fairytale.”
After both, wolf and raven, walked together through the snowy forest –the raven perched on the wolf, kneading the hair with the claws without scratching the skin–, Sherlock started to wake up, and forced himself to fly away, wishing to dream again with the wolf with the sandy fur. He flew off, drawing circles as he rose, and he heard the clear howl of the wolf when it raised its head elegantly to howl.
The nauseas came back with more force, at the same time a pang of pain went through him. He grunted, cowering.
John closed his hands in tight fists, feeling the flame inside of him answering, burning strong and waiting an order. How messed up he was. No wonder they had sent him away. After two days on Earth, he hadn’t found anything resembling a disturbance, even though he felt it. Except, of course, his encounter the first day. He would have taken that as some kind of signal, but the demon hadn’t felt the same way as the disturbance felt. A kind of lingering, powerful negativity. A black hole, consuming and magnetic. Almost seductive.
If there was something that he hated more than he could bear, was the hospital smell. It seemed so paradoxical that he himself had worked as a kind of doctor in a time that already seemed too remote. The aseptic aroma, the acid of the disinfectant and the latex were asphyxiating. There was also a smell of plastic. And the air that entered his lungs was too pure. Clean. Even cold. Oxygen.
The wolf continued to snarl, but its threats lowered its tone down until they became muffled warning sounds.
He had learned that information was important, and in return, he had memorized the entire map of London on his head in an incredibly accurate way. Of course, having an eidetic memory helped. Another thing that he had done with time was to trace with a map the underground lines of the city, including the subway lines that connected the two ends of London like veins. Obviously, the underground channels that passed through the Lions Den had been blocked, but they could be easily freed with a little bit of Semtex or classical dynamite.
“I am actually. He was a nice man. Worked hard, cared for us, and never cheated on mummy, which is actually unusual considering how much time they spent apart. He really loved her. But he was irresponsible getting her pregnant like that knowing he would have to leave. He loved us but he... wasn’t very good with children. At least he tried.”
Last time he had bothered to walk among humans, it had been very, very different. Big cities weren’t as such, and there wasn’t so much technology. Humans had still killed each other with swords and shields, and kept simple lives. He had to admit, though, that all of this advances made life seem a little bit more… fun. He might stick around for a while this time.
With John standing on the top step of the entrance they were face to face, and Sherlock could not prevent himself from kissing him. The flood of hormones in John’s veins was affecting him too much, and the closeness of his warm, blood-filled body wasn’t helping at all. The kiss was passionate, their bodies pressed together, John’s mouth still tasted like wine and caramel. His lips were insistent and hungry, and so were his hands, sliding across Sherlock’s hips to his back. Then they slid south and grabbed a handful of his arse through his trousers. Sherlock moaned when John squeezed it, pulling him tighter against his own hips. He could feel a growing stiffness pressing against his own, and heard John growl when he bucked his hips against it. His voice was low and infused with desire in Sherlock’s ear.
The body of a teenage boy was on the ground. It was face down, lips barely open. John lowered himself and searched for a pulse. Dead. He gave a deep sniff, making a face at the smell. The area and the body both reeked of demons. Had the boy been a satanic cultist? Maybe a summoning gone wrong? The lack of signs around the area made him sceptical about it. He was too young to be a cultist, and the residual energy of the body was sending an entirely different message. A strong emotion was lingering, and was barely the inky thing that made it to John’s mind. Fear. Compulsion. The human boy had been scared to death. So deeply that it engraved into his soul and left a mark.
was a very nice place, indeed. It had a floral and lovely Covent Garden atmosphere everywhere. And whoever choose the floral arrangements at the door and the reception area had exquisite taste. Not only were the colours and combinations extremely accurate, but the cacophony of scents was tremendously pleasant, strong, but not invasive, which was quite unusual for a vampire to find, he had to admit. Maybe Mycroft had something to say in the restaurant choice. His brother loved a nice meal in a fancy place like a cow loves grass. It just came with the package, he supposed.
It was difficult. Because he was mad, mad as hell. But every time he saw him reminded John of long, lonely centuries and sadness and regret... but it was also as if no time had passed. Like nothing had happened.
“Damn frogs that don’t know how to behave… I’m leaving. Help him get dressed and take him from here. I want him clean and in my room when I finish the meeting”, he ordered, straightening his jacket. He grabbed John’s face with one hand, clenching his jaw with his nails. “See you later, Johnny”, he whispered in his ear, as if they were lovers and that their big secret. He bit his ear and left.
He blinked, suddenly aware he had been lost inside his mind palace for too long. He wondered if he had at least remembered to breathe while he was in there.
Sherlock could feel his tears choking him. He had wanted John to become a vampire, too, but not like this. When he thought of the future, he could not fathom one in which John was not with him. He wanted to share everything eternity had to offer, to discover it with him. He had planned for this moment another way. He had had a completely different idea, another way of telling him.
“Yeah. That’s the poorest excuse I’ve heard, but let’s say I believe you and you’re not here to cause any trouble. Why now? Why not the other times?”
John coming back to Baker Street the next morning, reeking of sex, stale sweat, come, pheromones, and
John’s voice was mellow, and Sherlock finally raised his head from his armpit to rest his chin over John’s clavicle, looking at him in the eye. With a sigh, feeling himself going soft, he pulled out as gently as he could, taking a discreet sniff to check for blood or any harm. Calmed when he found nothing, he allowed himself to be lulled to rest by John.
episode till the end of times” Sherlock said, turning to look at him. John tried very hard not to react.
Frustrated, irritable and tired, he opened the door to his last clue. A night club that looked like a weird yet functional fusion between punk and fancy. John frowned, feeling out of place all of a sudden. This was not what he was expecting.
Sherlock ran to catch him as his legs finally gave up. John was coughing now, blood on his lips, but his hands, still firm, grabbed his lover’s arm with surprising strength. While lowering them to the floor, Sherlock tried not to press the knife any further within his body.
Normally, he wouldn’t approach the ground in his dreams. There was nothing interesting down there, but that time it was different. He felt an immense curiosity about the wolf; he knew it was important, although he couldn’t remember why.
John cleared his throat, forgetting the laughter from a few minutes ago. His face hurt, and it had only been a few minutes of smiles, he was so unaccustomed to it.
There was a laugh coming from Morning Star’s lips, but it wasn’t any happy sound. It made John growl.
He felt how his feathers puffed in alarm. Something was wrong. Something terrible was out of place here. It felt like a pressure at his chest, uncomfortable and slightly suffocating.
His best friend, Sally Donovan, a guerrilla which was a former agent of the old Scotland Yard which had a panther as an animal, had been engaged in his side in his squad in Northumberland, and more than once she had asked him why hadn’t he engaged to only be a medic, knowing that he still had a chance to change. Sally had joined the rebels when she had learned from a dream that her soul mate had died.
He pulled back firmly but with care, feeling his fangs out and ready. The venom glands were swollen, awaiting release. So he moved down, caressing John’s neck with his lips as he had done hundreds of times already when they were in bed. He took a deep breath, smelling the blood and the perfume of John’s skin, and caressed one sharp  point over the spot where neck meets shoulder, numbing it with saliva.
He remained in silence, throwing glares at the agents who, were supposed, to maintain the order and public safety, seeing for the welfare of the people, and not assuring themselves that they would be captured, tortured and denigrated. Had had the authorities been bribed at the beginning of the new regime it said much about the current state of the government.
Sherlock rolled his eyes  as he put the weight back gently in the designated spot. John frowned, registering for the first time the inhuman abilities Sherlock,
Abruptly, the sweet smell of blood filled his nose, spicy with adrenaline, and the hairs on his arms rose.
“You’ve made your mind up about something. You always have that look in your eyes when you do. May I ask what is it about?
He ate a pair of nuts, which he opened by hitting two loose bricks hitting with each other. It was great. There were five hundred and seventy-six calories in your system for each nut. That would be enough to hold for a couple of weeks.
“Yes. Mummy’s older sister. My mother’s family is all French and when I was young we lived with Aunt Marie
Sherlock’s nose pressed against John’s carotid, high on the smell of blood and sex emanating from his mate’s skin. “Maybe we should take this inside.”
It was not the darkness itself that bothered him. It was the memories of eyes like burning suns, tears falling like stars, and golden blood dripping from the softest of skins as a voice like the purest music sang his name in sorrow. It was the knowledge that once, light had been the only thing he had known. Now, that light was gone. Not for him to see.
The next day, Sherlock seemed more recovered than when he had arrived. He had slept all day, hidden in his stinky room on the top floor of the apartment. It was not until late at night that Sherlock woke up. He had heard Mycroft's footsteps make the old wood creak under his weight as he went up the narrow stairs to his room. This time, they divided the food, bread with cheese like every Monday. While they were eating, Mycroft looked at him. He waited until they stopped chewing the food, they did it slowly in order deceive their stomachs with the illusion that they would have more food inside that would really be. When he spoke, it was soft.
The boy was clutching something in one of his hands. John gently eased the tense, rigor mortis frozen fingers open, and took out whatever was inside the tight fist. it was a  small token, like a keychain in the shape of a football ball, with two dates engraved at the bottom. John concentrated and canalised the memory linked to the object. It had been a present. Something to remember a loved one that had passed away a long time ago... A parent. A father.
So the next time Jim required his presence, he resisted. And the one after. And another and another, until it had been six months that he had gone in and out of the infirmary. When Molly complained about his condition, in front of his face, he decided it was time to stop. So the next month, when he was brought to Moriarty’s Hall, he was obedient. He did everything that he asked him to do and he never protested. When everything finished, faster than usual, Jim released the leash.
If Sherlock wanted to test his abilities, well... a bit of exercise never hurt anyone.Or so he told himself. Sherlock’s delighted look had nothing to do with it, of course.
During the time that he had been working, John had managed to pass tons of information to the other side, although his effort had cost him. And, apparently, his sacrifice was bearing fruit. They had contacted with a young chemist who had managed to move to the clean side of the city, but had not yet given them the address or his name. He signed all of his warnings with an S, and had a brilliant plan to overthrow Jim’s government. The only problem was that they only had one occasion to act, and they had to do it right the first time, which was why the process was going so fucking slow. John could not wait to get out of this hell.
As Sherlock stands to close the distance between them so they can experience their first kiss, John looks down at the ring. It is a cheap child’s toy ring, adjustable, with a metal animal shaped in the middle.
just recently break out of hospital against doctor’s orders after being shot in the chest. So probably not.”
Sherlock and John don’t come to the complete understanding that Holmes and Watson had before the new picture shows up on the phone. It frustrates them both that their other selves are not on the same page as they should be. John pitches in to help anyway, because he cares about the lives at stake more than he cares about proving a point to Sherlock.
It didn't take long to realise something was wrong. Sherlock wasn't where he was when John had left. Pushing through the crowds, John attempted to find Sherlock in the mass of bodies, eventually seeing him outside in the darkening air. Unfortunately, he wasn't alone.
“I knew it,” Watson proclaims quietly, a mix of vindication and betrayal in his tone. While this woman is clearly not the embodiment of his wife, the fact that
“He did make a rather elegant rocking horse,” Sherlock begrudgingly admitted before waving his hands, “Enough! Enough of this.”
Putting the comments together, John suddenly understood and smiled warmly “Oh! Oh you mean you haven’t...right. That’s fine! That’s...we can go slowly.”
Know that I have never been ashamed of my love for him, merely frustrated at the climate we have lived in. It has been a dangerous time to love the way we do, but truthfully? Danger has always been a staple in every aspect of our lives, so why not this, too?
John dropped his left hand down to Sherlock’s curls before offering, “Would you like me to walk you through it?”
“Should we watch the last disc then?” Sherlock asks instead, ready to delete this entire day from his memory. The hope he had felt upon leaving his room has once again been replaced by fear and doubt.
John smiled reassuringly at him as he moved to support him once more. Sherlock was magnificent like this, and John thought it a damn shame that the younger man had never allowed himself to experience this before. He was beyond chuffed that Sherlock had chosen him above all others.
Watson inhales sharply, his left hand reaches out blindly to grasp at Holmes’ right resting atop his leg. Holmes doesn’t even register that his own grips back tightly.
Inn keeper Billy falsely apologizes to his partner Gary for purchasing the meat products, but Greg calls him out on the lie. Gary then tells the truth about passing a regular dog off as the hound to improve their business.
So this is Holmes finishing up Watson’s journey. Watson thinks he’s pulled Holmes back from the brink; but for Holmes, it’s as if Watson’s come back from the dead. Because after all, though the adaptation doesn’t emphasize this as much as the story does, this little stunt could have killed Watson just as easily as it could have killed Holmes. This is Holmes learning that from now on, death is something that comes for
I mean that is the look of love right there. The look that says, I’m sorry my darling, I didn’t mean to take you for granted, let me see if I can make it up to you by making tender love to you. And yes, he is giving that look to a hat. And that right there is the distilled essence and quintessential magic of Sherlock Motherfucking Holmes.
problem in "Empty House” than it would have been in almost any other episode. There is the awkwardness of the Reichenbach reconstruction, for example, where Watson is shot from so far away you have no idea WHO’s playing him, and is also clearly not standing where Burke was during the corresponding scene in “Final Problem.” But it cannot be denied that the main problem is that it would just be more powerful for the viewer if the person who welcomed Holmes back were the person who had actually lost him. Chemistry between actors doesn’t happen overnight; it’s built up over time as they work together and begin to trust and rely on each other. Burke and Brett’s chemistry was cooking at a pretty good clip by the time they hit “Speckled Band.” All that went up the spout, and it can’t be recovered; it has to be rebuilt. It just isn’t there yet for Brett and Hardwicke. Hardwicke is also at a disadvantage in the reunion scene in that he doesn’t have an established character or an established relationship to draw on; he has to
Holmes actually hunts Watson down while he’s in the middle of what appears to be a fishing trip, goes through the performance of asking him if he wants to come, pretends he’ll be OK with it if Watson says he’d rather finish his holiday, and then–once he secures Watson’s consent–reveals that he’s already got their train tickets. Exasperated by this presumption, Watson will be even more exasperated when he discovers that Holmes arranged their accommodations before he even went out to invite him on this jaunt.
Bowen’s primary innovation is to make Lady Frances Carfax interesting. Doyle was a lot more interested in the gruesome details of her near-death experience than in Lady Frances herself. In the canon story, the lady has already vanished before Holmes gets the case. Here, we and Watson get to know and like Lady Frances Carfax before all this hideous shit goes down. All Lady Frances wants is to live an independent and meaningful life. And yet, she is surrounded by men who are trying to stop her–her asshole aristocratic brother, Holy Peters, and this bearded and behatted stalker who, from a distance, looks not unlike the disguised Mr. Carruthers.
He drew me back down to him. I thought, as I unfastened his collar, that I had never really done him justice. I thought that if the shadow of fear could ever finally pass over us, I could paint him with all of my brightest tints, and not only scarlet. Vermilion, heliotrope, cerulean, fuschia. The brilliance of sapphire. The audacity of emerald. The sparkling evanescence of aquamarine. In another world, he could outshine any of these absurdly overvalued objects--scintillating, multifaceted, deceptively transparent, leading your gaze endlessly into his ever more brilliant depths.
Well, I would not say they made it better. They just made it weirder. This has to be one of the trippiest episodes ever.
“Solitary Cyclist” is one of several Holmes stories in which the client is a young, unattached woman who is menaced by male predators scheming to get control of her money. All of these plots are based on the assumption that it’s damn near impossible for a woman in England to achieve financial independence. In England, until the Women’s Property Act was passed in 1882, married women owned nothing; all their assets became the property of the husband as soon as they married. Doyle’s plots still assume that a woman’s income and property belong first to her male relatives and then to her husband. Roylott in “Speckled Band,” Windicott in “A Case of Identity,” and Rucastle in “Copper Beeches” are all trying to prevent their stepdaughters from marrying because that will mean losing the stepdaughters’ income to their new husbands. “Solitary Cyclist” is unusual in approaching this plot from the other angle, with the villains scheming to force the victim into marriage.
, identified by many as the first real detective novel in English, the professional detective exits the story after the first section, leaving the romantic hero to take up the case and uncover the truth. Violet is following the footsteps of
. Most TV and film adaptations cater to contemporary expectations by building up to Moriarty more gradually. I can understand why “Red Headed League” seemed like a good place to do that. The ruse Clay sets up as a cover for his tunneling is so elaborate that it is really hard to see how he could have done it without some outside help. Nevertheless, “Red Headed League” is a very early story–it appears right after “Scandal in Bohemia” in
So let me say, first of all, that for Doyle, what Holmes does with this unidentified white powder is certainly on the edge, but it’s not so far outside the box as to be
The Holmes stories stay up to date with all of this; but at the same time, they pulse with an already-nostalgic love for the handwritten document. These documents conceal mysteries and have to be decoded, even when they are not (as in “Dancing Men,” for instance) actually written in code. From the King of Bohemia’s stationery to the desperate note scrawled by “D” in “Wisteria Lodge,” paper in the Holmes stories is a landscape of mystery and intrigue whose secrets always yield themselves up to Holmes eventually.
the person who wrote it–even if you’re not Sherlock Holmes–in the handwriting, in the smell and weight of the paper, the color of the ink. Whereas with electronic communication–which I am not knocking at all, look at what I am doing with my Saturday night right now–you are restricted to letters, images, and sometimes a little tinny version of what they sound like. And while you can in fact hug a smartphone–PJ does, when one of us is away and calls in to say goodnight to her–it’s still not the same. You can hug a letter; you can kiss a letter; you can press it to your heart; you can hold it while you fall asleep; you can smell it; you can drop your big tears of loneliness onto it and it will absorb them. So friendly and so forgiving is paper.
Years ago, when Mrs. Plaidder and I were still in school, we had a friend who I will call V. V was an outspoken feminist; also, she was unusually beautiful. (By this I mean that her beauty was obvious even to straight men.) A lot of the men who hit on her were jerks. But she had this one boyfriend who really seemed to us like a keeper. He was sensitive, he listened, he understood and supported her politics; we met him and we thought he was great. They seemed very happy together. Then, one time, we asked after him, and V. said they weren’t together any more. We asked what happened. V. said, “Well, I read his journal.”
It absolutely baffles me that Moffat and Gatiss passed up the opportunity to do their take on “The Speckled Band.” It’s name-checked in “Scandal in Belgravia” in the title John gives one of Sherlock’s cases (”The Speckled Blonde”); but that’s all. As a story that feels very modern in some ways but is encumbered with Victorian Orientalism plus whatever it is that explains the 19th century British fascination with “gypsies,” and in which the H/W relationship game is pretty strong, you’d think it would be right in their wheelhouse. Well, never mind; Granada did one, and they did it right. There are of course some production values-related misfires. But the guest star playing Helen Stoner is a cut above; the creepiness is indeed creepy; and most of all, Brett and Burke make beautiful music together. And all of this gets even more affecting if you read “The Speckled Band,” as I do–and as I believe the whole production team does–as another story in which Helen Stoner was in more danger than Doyle was able to tell us about at the time.
while they did the rest of their business, as the adults in the canon story undeniably do. You can see
“But only slightly less well known is this: if you happen to be running an television series that deals in mystery, horror, and suspense, NEVER build an episode of it around animal possession.”
I just imagine these conversations happening during shooting: “How’s Jeremy feeling today?” “He seems in pretty good spirits.” “Great. Call props, tell them to get him some more paper.”
Jeremy Paul addressed some of these problems in the screenplay. As in “Musgrave Ritual,” Paul does a good job of finding and expanding the most dramatically interesting aspects of the backstory; regarding his treatment of the cook, Paul doesn’t change the language used to describe him (poor Edward Hardwicke gets stuck talking about his “negroid” and “mulatto-like” features), but he does suppress the gratuitous “fetish” and the sacrifice in the kitchen. None of that has anything to do with the solution to the mystery; it’s purely an attempt to create the “grotesque” atmosphere that Holmes identifies in the first lines as the keynote to this adventure. Paul made the executive decision that the case plot itself is grotesque enough.
Later, when he describes Cubitt’s appearance to Holmes, Holmes says, “Oh now you can’t possibly know that.”  “Really, Holmes?” says Watson, as the doorbell rings, and Holmes realizes Watson’s just seen Cubitt through the window, getting out of his cab. That little smile and head tilt Burke does as the bell rings and the penny drops is just a perfect drop of pure distilled acting joy. You’ve got your methods, Holmes…and I’ve got mine. And while Holmes is teaching Watson how you solve a cryptogram, Watson’s low-key teaching Holmes some client relations skills. Watson realizes immediately that Cubitt could use some emotional support, and finds many little ways to provide it. There are also several moments at which Watson coaches Holmes about his own reactions. Holmes at first shakes these off–”He doesn’t come to me for sympathy”–but eventually learns to appreciate them (as when, at Watson’s prompting, he asks the poor distraught cook if she would like to sit down during the interview).
Below the cut tag I’m going to talk about what this adaptation does with Kitty Winter, pictured above on the cab ride home from their dramatic visit to Violet de Merville’s house. But I will be talking about all that in the context of what really makes this episode stand out, which is what this adaptation does with the Great Partnership. This is a great episode for the Brett and Hardwicke team–even though, curse my besotted teenage heart of yore, I still can’t help wishing sometimes that I was watching Brett and Burke do this instead.
So my crackpot theory is that paper, for the digital age viewer, is a powerful symbol of what we fear we might be losing during the virtualization of our universe–and much of that involves our own sensory experience. Brett’s Holmes, as the Paper Whisperer, promises to restore to us a fuller engagement with the world of objects and a closer intimacy with what we read. Like Holmes’s decoding work in “The Dancing Men,” or his attempts to reconstruct an entire document from one surviving fragment (“Reigate Squires,” “Three Gables”), or his search for the meaning of a neglected document (“Musgrave Ritual”), Brett’s apparent affinity with paper promises to restore lost meaning to a place and time that no longer even knows how to look for it.
He rose on his knees, lifting his two hands into the air between us, a little higher than my head. I knelt before him and looked up at the circlet of darkness and light that that his hands described, and I swear by heaven that I saw it. I saw, poised in the curves drawn by his fingers, a circlet woven subtly of golden wire, fixing within its labyrinths many-colored brilliants from all the ends of the earth.
Of course, I could be completely wrong. But even if I am, this is still a very enjoyable episode. It’s not a *great* Watson episode, but he does get to contribute to the solution, and Hardwicke and Brett have pretty much settled into a rhythm now. Paul includes a cute little scene in which Watson reverently explains Holmes’s methods to Musgrave, who looks at both of them like they’re nuts (this is dialogue that used to be in the narration in the ACD story, and I just want to point out that it is very much indebted to “The Purloined Letter”). Mainly, though, I have to take my hat off to both Jeremies here for making something fabulous out of what I always thought of as very dull material. Indeed, they have polished that old pile of rusty metal until it gleams like the diadem of Charles the First himself.
The Granada “Red Circle” basically treats the Red Circle as if it were the mob, and in a lot of ways this episode is sort of a bargain-basement
As for the Mazarin Stone plot…it’s bad. I mean it’s not as bad as the original story, in which we are asked to believe that the evil Count can’t tell the difference between a phonograph record and a live performance, or between a live human and a waxwork, at close range. But honestly, I am over it with the stolen jewels, I spotted the Secret Diamond Hiding Place long before it was mysteriously revealed to Mycroft in the mud, and when they started talking about the diamond’s backstory, I thought, I don’t want to hear this diamond’s backstory. If it’s not the actual Moonstone, then GTFO. The final sequence, in which phantom Mycrofts appear to be stalking the Count until he uses up all his bullets, is perhaps a way of bringing in the waxwork replica idea from the canon story, but it’s never explained exactly how this illusion was accomplished (mirrors? waxwork Mycrofts on wheels? Fezzik in a holocaust cloak on a wheelbarrow?). And you know, I like Charles Gray’s Mycroft…but not for an entire hour. It’s a nice theme, but it doesn’t have a whole lot of variations.
it’s Tonga who kills Sholto with the poison dart; Smalls is so mad about it that he beats Tonga  with a rope until he draws blood. Hayes is a lower-class villain straight out of Ruffian Casting; he’s fine with bashing a guy’s head in, but James, the aristocratic and sensitive son of the aristocratic and sensitive Duke, is horrified by it. And yeah, that is Doyle letting his inner late Victorian shine through, and I can see how Bowen would have felt that needed fixing.
So, last night I fetched myself a glass of water and a healthy snack, fired up “Copper Beeches,” and sat back to enjoy a nice little unwind after a somewhat exasperating day, when this happened:
as if he is actually sinking into the water to drown. But right after his head disappears, the angle changes, and you discover that he’s standing in a boat which is being rowed across this little moat thing:
All right, first of all, let me just tell you: this episode is, as I believe the kids today say, LIT as FUCK:
That in itself was partly due to Brett’s extraordinary fidelity to the original text. Brett talked a lot about how he had to fight the rest of the team to keep the show in line with ACD canon. The viewer could be forgiven for being puzzled by that; nearly all the Granada episodes deviate to some extent, and some of them are startlingly divergent. I’ve come to the conclusion that when Brett talked about being faithful to the canon, he was talking first and foremost about being faithful to the dialogue. In the adaptation, at least through the end of the “Return” series, Holmes’s dialogue is usually preserved as close to verbatim as possible. The producers evidently thought he wouldn’t be able to make all that Victorian diction live. But he did it. He inhabited those speeches and transformed them, with all the care and dedication other actors lavish on Shakespeare. In that sense, his whole performance derives from paper–from the book of Doyle’s stories that he read, and
Jeremy Paul’s adaptation fixes two of these problems very well, and does its best with the third. He moves the case into the present, so that the whole thing happens while Holmes and Watson are down visiting Musgrave for the weekend. This helps solve the second problem: all the events which, in the story, are narrated by Musgrave actually happen during that weekend. As for the third problem…well, they tried. For the time, the way they attempt to layer the seventeenth-century history of this case over the Victorian-present-day investigation is sort of cool. At this moment, well, when I see a guy dressed up as a cavalier riding a horse and handing off his bag to a guy who is CLEARLY the actor playing Reginald Musgrave in old-guy hair and makeup with a cloak pretending to be his own great-great-great-great grandfather, it is kind of hard to take that seriously. The most effective strategy for problem #3, really, was showing Holmes piecing together the bits of crown while he explained its provenance and history. Good job with the prop, everyone on the prop team; and A+ job for Brett’s use of Holmes’s natural histrionic talents to make his little mini History Channel documentary compelling. Although it is true that initially, they all completely fail as archaeologists. Of COURSE it’s all dull and dirty, that thing was buried back in 1649. Did you expect it to be shiny after two and a half centuries in a box in a damp cellar?
Anyway, one of my favorite things about “Priory School” is watching Holmes handle everyone. He handles Huxtable beautifully–he manages to get him to say that it was perfectly OK that Holmes basically searched him while he was unconscious, looking for trinkets to make deductions from–and he’s in top form confronting the Duke of Holdernesse as he tries to get Holmes kicked off the case. I love watching Sherlock Holmes reduce an aristocratic jackass to rubble while pretending to be polite and deferential. I think Brett loved it too; as soon as he hears the Duke is on the grounds, he gets this look on his face:
in which Watson takes Holmes to task over his drug use; so before the King shows up we get the “my mind rebels at stagnation” speech. Holmes is pretty explicit about the fact that taking this case is part of his treatment plan.
In the final scene in 221b, however, I felt like I was starting to warm up to Hardwicke. I mean I don’t know whose idea it was to put the poor man in a fez:
but…it’s bad. The whole thing is awful. I mean I laughed, out loud, hysterically, throughout. And I thought, you know what, this one time I wish I could bring in Moffat and Gatiss here and have them do this part, because this hallucinatory mind palace stuff is something they excel at, and at which the Granada team, or at least this particular Granada team, evidently *sucked.*
Yes, Green is a stalker. Bowen’s script makes that clear. Lady Frances is given several opportunities to make it quite clear to Green that she wants nothing more to do with him. He ignores all of them, continues to follow her, and actually tracks her down on a train after her ‘disappearance’ and proposes to her–and is flatly rejected. He does seem to be sincerely concerned about her welfare and he does help save her life. All the same: what do we call a man who refuses to take no for an answer, and keeps hounding the woman who told him “no” because he’s convinced that since she loved him once and he’s “waited fifteen years” she MUST eventually come around if he just follows her around for long enough? We call him a stalker.
* A snake could not climb down a bell-pull. For snake locomotion they need something rigid to push against. You can totally tell this in the final credits of this episode, where the snake is quite obviously NOT crawling down a bell-pull, but rather crawling along the top of something which is really horizontal and probably either concealing or attached to a long wooden rod.
You know, after I finished this episode, I started kicking myself for not having seen it back in 1986. I was 17, I could really have used it then. Why, I lamented, did I let my adolescent fear of change prevent me from the years of enjoyment I could have derived from “The Second Stain”? But then I said, no, do not be so hard on Young Plaidder. She was more prescient than you imagine. Somehow she mysteriously knew, without knowing, that in 2017, you would DESPERATELY need the shot in the arm that these ‘new’ episodes of Granada Holmes would provide–and that this particular episode would come along right at the moment that Cranky Old Plaidder would be most exquisitely poised to appreciate the many, many intertextualities which add zest and deliciousness to this most scrumptious of palimpsests.
So while Skene un-stupids Watson, Brett works on expanding Holmes’s emotional range–and he’s fantastic at it. His Holmes is crackling with energy all the time, even when he’s not moving. In fact, one of the most delightful things about Brett’s physicality in this role is the way his body goes from zero to sixty at the drop of a hat. I particularly enjoy watching him snap out of his reverie to rush into a feverish tidying of the sitting room before the client shows up. But he’s also always quivering with more subtle energies. I’m not kidding when I tell you that I spent some of this episode thinking about how much I love watching Jeremy Brett handle paper.
Watson and Holmes have completely incompatible ideas about what constitutes a holiday. The one time their ideas on the subject converged was when Holmes decided to invite Watson on tour of the Continent, and that’s only because Moriarty was chasing him and he thought he was going die before he’d have to finish it. Since the Return, Holmes has tried humoring Watson–he accepts Musgrave’s invitation to his country estate, he agrees to come with him to the back end of Cornwall–but he can’t make himself enjoy it. (Watson goes shooting with Musgrave; Holmes sits on a bench with his 50 shawls. Watson wants them to enjoy the rugged Cornish landscape together; Holmes wants to take long solitary walks and dig up the remains of dead civilizations.) This perhaps explains why "Boscombe” is the second
his relationship with Watson, who is given the right to confirm or revoke the freedom that Holmes is offering Crocker.
The image you see above is from the end of the episode, while they’re waiting for the notorious Abe Slaney to ride over from Eldridge’s farm in answer to the coded message Holmes just sent him. Inspector Martin has asked Holmes how he figured this out. Watson jumps in and starts explaining. As he goes on telling the story of how they deciphered the messages, the camera closes in and you can see Holmes doing his best not to laugh. He’s smoking, and smiling, and graciously not calling attention to the fact that Watson has learned everything he now knows about codes from a monograph Holmes wrote on the subject. Early in the investigation, Holmes asks him whether he’s read this monograph, and Watson says, “Some of it…I found it rather heavy going.” Later on, as their flat starts filling up with chalkboards and dancing figures, Watson sits down with a paper and surreptitiously slips the code monograph behind it, studying up on the sly. When Watson asks what “ABESLANE” means, instead of telling him, Holmes says, “Watson, if this is ‘E’…”:
Jeremy Paul adapted “Naval Treaty,” “Speckled Band,” “Wisteria Lodge,” and “Musgrave Ritual”; and if you look at his track record you can see that he has a healthy respect for the canon stories but is also not afraid to, let’s say, enhance them by making some significant changes (as he does in “Musgrave Ritual” and “Wisteria Lodge”). In his expansion of “Thor Bridge,” Paul gives us loads of what has worked for this show so far: more and better Watson, Holmes facing off against asshole millionaire clients, and–of course!–Jeremy Brett handling paper.
to bring a murderer to trial is active and not passive. That letting Turner or Crocker or Sterndale go is an action in and of itself–an action that he’s always been too ready to take impulsively, an action with far-reaching consequences that he really ought to stop to consider. Holmes is as lost in his way as the “poor, helpless worm” he’s protecting. God help us is right.
The only thing really interesting to me about this one, in fact, is the number of references to it that
I’m just going to go ahead and say that this has to have been on some level a deliberate fuck-you to the Johnlock contingent. Why else would you invoke this story and all it represents, only to deploy it in this utterly meaningless and entirely ridiculous way? Of all the bait-and-switches that show perpetrated–and there have been MANY–I think this must rank as one of the cruelest.
So it ends with each of them having accepted his own flaws and the other’s strengths. Which would be entirely heartwarming, were it not for the fact that when Watson comes back with the paper, he catches Holmes in the act of rolling his sleeves back down and shoving the syringe drawer back into the desk.
Maybe he’s also jealous of Percy. I say this, not just because I ship the ship (though I do), but because a lot of Holmes’s stranger behavior seems to happen around Percy. When it’s just the two of them investigating, everything seems to click, and there are some wonderful moments–like the scene in Phelps’s office with Inspector Forbes. He comes in bitching about how Holmes uses their information and take the credit; Holmes goes off on him; and when a chastened Forbes asks them where they’re going next, Watson REALLY enjoys telling him they’re going to see Lord Holdhurst. But while they’re interviewing Percy and Annie, and Watson keeps trying to help out by pointing things out on the map, Holmes barely acknowledges him, and seems to be getting more and more irritated. That night, back in 221B, when Watson asks Holmes if he’s all right, Holmes brushes it off. But when Watson gets up to go, Holmes gets positively plaintive: “I won’t detain you any longer from your *legitimate* work,” he says, but he hopes Watson will come to Woking with him the next morning. Watson’s hugely pleased to get the invite, and walks out calling, “Good night, Holmes.” Holmes sits there as the door closes, brooding. And at the end, when Percy offers Holmes his hand, Holmes avoids shaking it by handing Percy his cane instead:
I have done no research on the making of this series, so I don’t know what was in the guidelines for the writers. All four of these episodes so far have been written by different people, all men who were veterans of TV adaptation and had worked in serial television before. However it happened, “Solitary Cyclist” would have been a better follow-up epsiode to “Dancing Men” than “Naval Treaty” was, because it continues the narrative of Watson’s apprenticeship–which, in this story, hits a couple speed bumps. Holmes’s dressing-down of Watson after his first (in this series anyway) solo assignment is a classic moment, in ACD canon and in this adaptation. But Holmes also clearly has a few things to learn. In fact, all the men drawn into Violet Smith’s orbit seem to have a habit of bungling things at critical moments. And yet, despite all this masculine incompetence, Violet Smith is still in real danger, because that’s what life is like when you’re a single woman trying to support yourself and your widowed mother in a world where men are pretty much never held accountable for the way they treat women.
So first, the elephant in the room: It’s very, very, very strange to watch “Dying Detective” knowing that Brett was, while they were making it, dying.
Both Lestrade and Watson are trying to figure out WTH is going on with Holmes’s examination of Pietro’s body, and neither of them can do it, and that’s pretty funny. It turns out to be pretty entertaining to give Watson his own junior apprentice, so they can grouse to each other about what a hard-ass their teacher is and how hard they work–crashing on the couch, going out to Chiswick at 2am, hiding out in a cold gazebo where they can’t even smoke, etc:
And yet, at the same time, this is a brilliant episode for character development, and all three actors make the most of the opportunity. In ACD canon, “The Six Napoleons” marks a major shift in the way Holmes and Lestrade interact. The adaptation takes this farther, finally making Lestrade a real character and laying, one could argue, the foundation for Greg Lestrade’s character and his relationship with Sherlock on
