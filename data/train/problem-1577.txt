Unfortunately, gathering the evidence as to Mary’s real identity had turned out to be immensely harder than anticipated, and more than a few things had gone awfully wrong along the way.
. And until there is a bloody guard, and even after that, someone needs to stay close to him, the only someone available at the moment being
Once they had stilled, and contentedly started to doze off between sweaty sheets, snow started falling outside their windows, covering the world in a beautiful blanket. Like a fresh start; a new page, waiting to be written.
“Er, yeah, well, no, depends,” John replied. Crap. Why hadn’t they come up with some sort of backstory beforehand? “I’m actually from out of town, just staying with my friend here in London at the moment.” That would have to do. “And you?” he asked quickly, in an attempt to deflect further questions.
Everyone sang ‘Happy Birthday’ as John slowly walked towards Sherlock with the birthday cake, a giant smile on his face.
His enthusiasm, however, was quickly dampened by his phone screen staying black when he tried to unlock it.
He closed his eyes, focusing on calm breaths, and slowly, eventually, exhaustion pulled him back into the realm of dreams.
Slowly, his breathing slowed back to normal as the one obvious and perfect plan presented itself in his mind. It crystallised within seconds, bright and clear.
to John in a way he hadn’t experienced before. In the exactly hundred days he’d been with John, Sherlock had determined, finally, that sex was not about taking but about giving. But that wasn’t true either, really. As he moved inside of John, with more care and gentleness than he’d ever known was in him, he realised that good sex was, more than anything, about
John slowly sank to his knees, carefully putting down the gun he’d just fired on the floor in front of him, and hid his face. Sherlock tentatively stepped closer to him and put an arm around him as he kneeled too, letting his head hang next to John’s. “It’s okay. You had no choice. She would undoubtedly have killed Vivian, if you hadn’t acted so quickly. You did the right thing,” he said softly.
By Tuesday afternoon, a day and a half into his new ‘job’, Sherlock had become rather fed up with the senseless banter of the workmen, which distracted him not so much from the case but from being able to meanwhile think about the situation he’d gotten his relationship with John into. Also, his back was aching. He’d been taking as many trips to the loo as he could without arousing suspicion, so as to optimally extend his area of surveillance into part of the Hall, as well as stretch his back and have some quiet moments to himself, and he decided to venture another one now.
And then there’d been Mary telling him ‘neither of us were the first, you know’ at the wedding, when John had been so very engrossed in conversation with James Sholto, much to Sherlock’s chagrin. Which had happened mere days after John’s bachelor party, where he’d drunkenly grabbed Sherlock’s knee with the words ‘I don’t mind’.
John had given a specific time not just so that the doorbell wouldn’t wake up Rosie during her nap, but because he would be away. Visiting Mrs Norbury, of course.
“Jimmy! Don’t forget to avoid Kingsland Road,” the paramedic hovering around John called to the driver.
“Ah. You’re not going to believe it,” Sherlock answered, pulling his mind away from his previous thoughts.
After a minute or two, his brother went over to a cupboard with drawers and took a pile of drawing paper from it. Then he sat down at the table and started drawing.
John lifted his legs and wrapped them around Sherlock’s back. Sherlock, however, appeared startled and pulled back a little. The look on his face was worried, almost alarmed. It hadn’t once occurred to John that Sherlock might not actually want to top at all. Could that be the case?
John smiled at him fondly from below. “Only if you want to, though,” he whispered against his mouth, before kissing him once more.
Mrs Hudson was rather bad at playing Uno. And Sherlock didn’t feel like playing any of the other games he’d been occupying himself with ad nauseam in the past weeks – or the violin, either – so he decided to clear up the game after this round and then start emptying his inbox on his phone.
. And he found Sherlock was a quick study. Before long, their tongues, lips and noses were entangled in a wild dance, which turned out to be the one language in which they could finally declare their love.
As he tossed himself off, his troubles faded and became mere background noise to the reality of his impending orgasm. When it finally crashed down on him, for a short moment in time, nothing mattered at all and there was nothing but bliss and the scent of John’s sweater.
“How about the investigation that was undoubtedly started into Ms Norbury’s presumed activities as a mole, after her false confession?” Sherlock asked, his voice low. “I hope that has been abandoned, by now?”
know, however, was that ever since the debacle with Mary and ‘E’, John had been trying hard to renounce his attraction to anything feminine. Never again to fall for a pretty ankle in high heels, the bulge of perky breasts, or long hair falling seductively over a coyly lifted shoulder. All he wanted, from now on, was Sherlock.
I’m not gay. But it’s fairly evident that I’m not… entirely straight either.” John smiled a sheepish smile, feeling slightly embarrassed. He didn’t want to sound like a sex maniac who was happy to get off with
“It’s only a matter of time before you get better,” Sherlock said, softly carding his fingers through John’s hair. “Patience, John. Listen, Rosie will be here in an hour. Just thought I’d let you know. In case you want to get dressed or eat first.”
“I... er… I wouldn’t know. I haven’t seen her in about thirty years.” He stretched out one arm to pick up the purple ring that was rolling away almost out of reach. “She didn’t want to have anything to do with my dad anymore, her brother.” While he spoke, John kept interacting cheerfully with Rosie, with whom he was building a rainbow tower. “Only about ten years ago did I realise it was because of my dad’s drinking.”
He wore a ginger wig with long, wavy hair, small but thick-rimmed purple glasses, a pink boxy top with a wide, green, coarsely knitted cardigan over it and a pair of his own dark blue skinny jeans and lilac pumps with medium high heels below, which he still had from last time. Furthermore, he wore a set of false teeth he’d remembered he kept in a drawer, and had stuffed bits of cotton wool in his cheeks to change the shape of his mouth and make his cheekbones not stand out as much. On top of that, Hannah had not only added a perfectly natural looking layer of make-up (using lipstick to alter the apparent shape of his upper lips to a more generic kind), but she’d also plucked his eyebrows to reduce them to a thinner line, higher up above his eyes, as women tended to have.
But despite all the awkwardness, John only had to look at Sherlock to see that Greg was right. He was radiant and John probably looked similar himself – although seeing him like that was probably less of a shock to outsiders.
At the same time, he realised he was hard, which made no sense. But he didn’t have the energy to try to resist it.
“Yes, of course Rosie is learning it as well,” Sherlock said. “At this age, they copy everything they observe. The only reason she’s not speaking with sounds yet is that at nine months, her vocal chords have not yet developed sufficiently. But her hands have.”
By the time the batter for the cake was ready, and Mummy was ladling it into the springform, Sherlock ventured to remark, “I’ve visited Sherrinford a couple of times this summer. For the first time in 34 years.”
John had been a total wreck by the time Sherlock regained his freedom and was safely back at Baker Street. John had caught such a bad flu – likely from a combination of stress, sleep deprivation and heavier drinking than he cared to admit – that he’d lain on the sofa at 221B under a blanket, shivering, as Sherlock sat in front of the fire, calmly recounting the D-notice meeting to John in his soothing baritone voice, while eating ginger nuts.
Sherlock smiled faintly, blinking repeatedly. “So you think that there actually is a chance,” he said, hesitantly, “that when we’re old and wrinkly,” – he briefly made a face at the idea of ever reaching this state – “we’ll still be together, like this, as a couple, I mean?”
He sat cross-legged on the floor in the middle of the living room and closed his eyes. He casually strolled through the corridors of his Mind Palace, not sure where he was heading. He stayed away from John’s Wing though, where he’d spent too much time already in the past days. Instead, he opened a door he couldn’t remember being there before.
Thanks to providence, he’d had the guy back at gunpoint within about twenty seconds, because the moron had managed to stumble over the very pipe he himself had thrown in their way to thwart their pursuit only minutes earlier.
John considered for a minute. “Horrifying as that sounds, you might very well be right,” he eventually said, still absorbed in thought about the matter. “Might very well be.” He squinted at another group of similar cottages, which had taken a desolate tinge after Sherlock’s observation, and tried to imagine the hidden wickedness which might go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.
The edge of danger, that was always there both during the act itself and during his confessions, was now heightened. This was an extremely clever man. What if he remembered some bits and patches and would manage to piece them together afterwards? Not that he would have any proof at all, of course.
As he turned another corner, he abided when a couple of elderly ladies uninvitedly peered into the pram and made cooing sounds – much to Rosie’s (and his own) bafflement.
As John cleared away the teacups, his mind jumped back and forth between the memory of having been almost shot at this morning by Eurus sodding Moriarty (for the second bloody time), Sherlock’s revelation that Sherrinford was innocent, and his sister visiting in the afternoon.
“Yeah, I know, he mentioned it, which is why I came all the way here to hand him these personally.” He smiled a bit more to placate her. “It will only take two minutes,” he added reassuringly.
“Haha,” she laughed. “That must be Jonathan White’s little girl, then. She’s probably around your age now.”
Sherlock pressed the screenlock button a lot more forcefully than necessary and marched over to the nurses station. It would probably take over an hour before an actual constable arrived. And how much security could a single copper at the door really provide? Eurus would likely have no problem entering through the window, or disguising herself as a nurse or a visitor, or even a patient.
“Oh dear. That’s what you get for not watching your child, isn’t it? But with some luck, the child will come to the dog rather than the other way round. Look at his cute face!” And she squished the dog’s head between both hands.
-- Tell her that drones have no biological father, just a mother (the queen). They are like half-clones. You have to interest her in science early on. S
He walked up the stairs as quietly as he could, to minimise the chance of Mrs Hudson poking her head around the door.
“Wouldn’t it be much simpler to take out your grievances at the polling station?” Sherlock had jested, confidently.
Lestrade smiled thoughtfully while he put out his cigarette, and nodded. “You know what, you might just be right.” After another pause, he said, “So you’re really happy with him, then.”
But just then, Sherlock’s phone had beeped and he’d quickly punched in some digits, before putting it to his ear. “Can’t you see me? People live here for years and never see it, but if you are what I think you are, it’ll take you less than a minute.”
He considered phoning Mycroft, loathe as he usually was to do so. But desperate times called for desperate measures.
After the revelation of sex turning out to be something that he could most definitely get used to, he now found that having John in his bed with him, fast asleep and looking so peaceful, was a whole new category of wonderful.
Sherlock had never had this level of attention paid to him before, and it was a mesmerising experience. After having covered the area between Sherlock’s nipples and his navel, leaving a subtle trail of cool damp patches on his skin, John continued to move lower, making Sherlock catch his breath. A moment later, John was lying on his side the other way round, now leaning on his right elbow: with his knees near Sherlock’s right shoulder, his head hovering near Sherlock’s half-hard prick.
While the cake was being cut and handed round, John kneeled next to him, petting the puppy’s head. “Shall we call her Pearl? What do you think?”
“Oh, but I do. I spent a whole evening with her.” Sherlock grinned. “We had chips.” He looked down reflectively. “I think she liked me.”
See, he thought he had a pretty good reason either way. He’d cocked it all up, and he would never be good enough for John anyway. There just was no point in trying.
Just then, Sherlock’s phone lit up and a very familiar female orgasmic voice sighed from the speaker. John’s stare intensified, as he furrowed his brow. Sherlock, raising his mug to his lips, glanced across at the phone.
When John’s hands reached the small of Sherlock’s back, he pulled Sherlock more tightly towards him, grinding his cock into Sherlock’s thigh, apparently desperate for friction.
don’t feel inadequate. That’s not helping, you know.” John looked at him intently. “Sherlock, you are the strongest and most amazing person I have ever met. It’s awe inspiring to see the things that you have gone through, both on purpose and unasked for. And this is just one of those things. It proves how strong and amazing you are. It doesn’t change anything. The only problem is that
If John had been unsure about the whole sex-with-Sherlock thing, he had been wrong. It was without any doubt whatsoever the best sex ever. Who needed tits or pussy when you had, well...
He knew it shouldn’t really matter. There were so many forms of sex, after all, that all qualified as such, regardless. But still, what they had done this morning had felt momentous: like he finally, irrefutably was no longer a virgin.
Sherlock nodded and John got up to put the kettle on. Nothing like a good cuppa to have a break and help organise your thoughts. While John was busy, Sherlock sauntered over to the kitchen table behind him, which was covered with papers and pictures related to the case. In a corner, John had noticed a neat pile with the stuff relating to the sadly unsolved Abergavenny case that Sherlock had taken down from the wall. Archive material.
John felt like he might explode from pure joy. Gradually, he saw his feelings mirrored on Sherlock’s face.
It was as if a shadow passed overhead, casting a darkness that suddenly highlighted how misunderstandings could ruin relationships. How silence could change the course of people’s lives.
“Listen,” John said flatly, “I won’t be able to enjoy this if I’m not absolutely sure that it’s not hurting you and the only way to be certain is if you promise to
John had actually managed to make Sherlock come just with words once: whispering both sweet and filthy things into his ear while kissing his neck – and subtly pressing his bulge to Sherlock’s naked cock as he was straddling him, but otherwise not touching him.
“Er, yes, as a matter of fact, he asked for a transfer back yesterday afternoon.” Bob was now eying Sherlock suspiciously. “Did you
“Sherlock, I think I should get going,” he yawned, as Sherlock studied his phone. “Another early morning tomorrow.”
Sherlock was about to tell her to stop it, but realised just in time that it would only achieve the complete opposite.
John’s giggling only increased at this. Sherlock rushed to the kitchen to get a towel to clean them up, a grin tugging at the corners of this mouth at the potential slapstick level of the situation as he awkwardly hopped back to the sofa, where John was still lying helplessly stranded and covered in cum.
, in this funny foreign accent which he couldn’t quite place. He generally just couldn’t put a finger on who she really was, with her ash blonde shoulder-length hair, frameless glasses and her notebook on her lap.
“We have hardly told anyone yet,” John said. “But with you, I can at least be sure that you’ll understand.” He raised his eyebrows.
for one another,” Greg beamed. “He’s always happy when he’s with you, even though he doesn’t necessarily show it, as such,” he conceded. “But without you, he’s a total, insufferable prick. That’s true love, innit?”
John nodded thoughtfully, one corner of his mouth quirking up. “So what are you going to do now? Are you still planning on visiting that goldsmith?”
The sight of his partner lying there utterly relaxed and so ready for him stopped John’s breath for a second. How he adored this man, this strange, self-confident, arrogant, brilliant git of a beautiful lover.
As his eyes fell on the swirly blue line on the packaging of the chocolate chip cookies, his thoughts were pulled back in another direction.
Twitching a smile, Smith straightened. “Here it comes.” He reached a finger to the control panel next to the drip stand and pressed a button twice, making it beep noisily. He then reached to another button, pressing it repeatedly, before slowly walking back around the foot of the bed. “So tell me: why are we doing this? To what do I owe the pleasure?”
, namely the secret to John’s desire – even if its artificial nature did to an extent feed a nagging worry at the back of his mind. When he came back from the lingerie shop that Sunday just after noon, he immediately sneaked into the bathroom to change into his new set, then put his clothes back on over it. He’d gone for the smallest cup size this time, naturally, seeing as he would have to be able to wear the bra under his normal clothes. He’d chosen a light shade of petrol blue, lace again. John seemed to have liked that. The memory of the look of John’s face the week prior brought a smile to his face, tentatively breaking through the general sadness that had been growing in his heart.
It was then that John suddenly spotted a white plastic daisy-like flower behind her ear. “What’s that?”
I just want to fix ALL THE PLOT HOLES!!! Because they still make me angry. Me making up for Moffat and Gatiss’s lazy writing is just a form of therapy for me, I guess. ;)
. It was an awkward way to introduce his plan of drawing something for Sherrinford, but he felt an introduction was necessary, nevertheless. Also, it was important he made this drawing of what he knew to be true with as many details of the surroundings as possible. So he drew Sherrinford sitting next to him and the cats lying on the floor in the exact positions they were in at that very moment.
A couple of phone calls with Janine later, he had an opening date for Sherrinford’s first exhibition.
In order to distract himself, Sherlock casually strolled over to his parents, who were now talking with Sherrinford – using Mycroft as an interpreter. At least they now seemed more at ease with the use of sign language, even though they had still learnt too little themselves to actually apply it in any meaningful way. But in some measure they were trying now.
Sherlock hurried out of the room and informed the officer standing guard that Finnish police should be contacted to stand by when flight AC 9171 landed in Helsinki at 10.45 local time, to intercept a possible child abductor and his victim.
John had no idea how to gauge the odds that the Black Pearl of the Borgias was actually inside that little clump. In a way, it seemed unlikely.
John knew the feeling very well, and not just with women. Hell, with Sherlock, he didn’t get what went on in his lover’s head no less than eighty percent of the time.
“Well. She was shot in the left thigh, from behind. Right through the femoral artery. Distance of no more than ten feet, small calibre gun. She then apparently fell and hit her temple against the pointy corner of one of those metal electricity boxes beside the pavement. Between the head injury and the considerable blood loss from her leg, it was hard to tell what killed her. Either way, by the time an ambulance finally arrived, it was too late. I suppose the traffic must also have been crazy in that area. Soho. On Frith Street. You know how it can get, there,” Molly said.
He lifted his shoulder blades from the mattress to reach between his spread thighs and grab John’s bottom, desperately digging his fingers into the wonderfully firm yet soft flesh, to pull John even closer to him. He ardently longed for John to hit the magic spot and wanted to come under his spell once more, to let his restless mind crash down all the way from the cold mountain tops where it too often resided. He could feel it hovering over him already, like an invisible veil that would trap him soon. He threw his head back, letting the delightful feeling of John moving inside him wash out all other things.
“Naturally. So all we know is the location of one of her safehouses. Most likely one of many. It might be weeks before she returns. Long after Lestrade withdraws the stakeout, probably.” Sherlock sighed.
,” she beamed from the landing. “I didn’t realise you were here. I thought Sherlock was talking to himself again.” She chuckled.
“Aunt Harry, yes, look, there she is!” she then heard John’s voice coo from the landing, as he came into the room with the cutest little baby girl on his arm.
“Hmm. Must there be something? It’s not as if I need an engraving to remember our wedding date or your name, John.”
As he fumblingly transferred some of his nasal mucosa’s secretion to the offered tissue, he thought back to how he’d managed to unearth the vital clue to Mary’s involvement in the Colchester case while texting about it right under her nose, as her baby was being christened. Thankfully the ceremony had managed to keep her focus on Rosie for more than ten minutes, which was more than could be said on an average day. So, although she acted annoyed at him for using his phone at his goddaughter’s baptism, she never suspected a thing.
Molly straightened, abandoning her investigation of the woman’s ear. “Well, that’s strange. Let me think.”
Only a few hours after he’d solved The Three Garridebs case (he thought John would like this title) and he’d finished his short, awkward chat with Mycroft – who was really just trying to be kind and give him some moral support, Sherlock knew deep down (as well as a bag with toiletries he apparently thought Sherlock might need) – Sherlock got an email from Lestrade. Another case. Or really, just a picture of a coffin and a very short question: “A child’s coffin?”
This time, when Sherlock spoke, his voice was quiet and intense. “Serial killing is an expression of power, ego, a signature in human destruction.”
He hadn’t anticipated feeling like that, or having any feeling about anything relating to this case whatsoever. He’d only wanted to see John’s hip. His innocent, pale, smooth hip, with quite the lovely, subtle curve where his hipbone protruded slightly above the dip where his firm, muscular thigh joined his sturdy torso. Without any tattoo of any sort, thankfully.
They wandered around for a couple of hours, lifting rocks and stones and checking out trees, until they made their way to an isolated area of extraordinarily rocky shoreline. Rather than consisting of loose rocks, the shore was in fact one big stretch of rock itself.
“Oh, don’t worry,” Mycroft smiled. “They know already; we have discussed at length how happy you two are together. John is more than welcome.” Mycroft suddenly looked as smug as John had ever seen him.
!” At that, John made a growling sound as he opened his jaws around Sherlock’s cock in a fake bite, before hooking his fingers in the lace and carefully pulling it down Sherlock’s thighs.
It had all caused Jim to increase his obsession with Sherlock, since he had been the reason the phone had fallen into the wrong hands, of course. (Irene herself no longer being a target of his revenge, as she had cleverly led them to believe she was dead.) And with all those flopped projects, Jim had suddenly also had more actual time on his hands to obsess over Sherlock in the first place.
She raised an eyebrow at him, which he ignored. “No tensions whatsoever,” she checked, looking at him askance.
Eventually, they lay down under the covers, still embracing; and soon after, both fell into a peaceful, deep sleep.
“And by the way,” John whispered, “in case you feel like reciprocating, you no longer need to use a condom on me. I just got an e-mail with the lab results.”
“Amy? Nah, she’s alright. Turns to ice when you try to flirt with her, though. I wouldn’t recommend it.”
Sherlock handed her the picture on which a dark bruise-like spot could be seen on the victim’s temple, and she studied it for a minute. “Oh, I remember! Lestrade mentioned that there were some mud spatters that partly got washed off in the rain before they’d had the tent over the body. I think this is probably a mud stain.”
Suddenly, Sherlock was silenced by lips pressed to his mouth. John was kissing him again, just like before: tender, slow and full of…
This was taking longer than John had anticipated. He wanted to get back to Sherlock as soon as possible, copper at his door or not. But Greg wanted to know
Sherlock shuddered, but found he only barely had the energy to care, at this point. It seemed there were simply too many things to care about. He couldn’t do it anymore.
“Alright.” The sooner this was over, whatever this was, the sooner he would be able to get Sherlock back into his hospital bed, where he belonged.
“You practically single-handedly ensured that one of the slyest murderers of our time was put behind bars.” John shook his head. “I almost lost hope so many times. But you actually did it.” He sniffed, his eyes moist.
He wasn’t a virgin, technically, although he wasn’t sure that one time counted. He had been much too young, and it wasn’t anything he had consented to. In reality, Sherlock was still haunted by the fact that he had been stupid enough to let it happen. He had tried and almost succeeded in deleting both his formerly favourite teacher and their little secret from his memory and never thought he’d ever want to do anything like that with anybody ever again. But strangely enough, with John he wanted to. He felt a helpless physical attraction to him, like iron ore to a magnet. It was very unnerving, but – weirdly – incredibly soothing at the same time. Could it be true, after all, that man cannot live without love, like all those imbecilic songs claimed?
He took a sip of coffee, quickly deciding it would be crazy to search the entire area around Trondheim only because of a hunch. Just the city centre, then – even though the chances of finding the gem were infinitesimally small by now. But they had to at least keep trying until the end.
God, would the idiots never stop associating him with that stupid deerstalker? He didn’t stalk deer, that much should have been clear by now.
For a fraction of a second, he considered kissing the handsome, blond, bearded scholarly type smiling back at him, but while he wasn’t sure of their precise relationship status, he definitely thought that either way it would not be a good idea while they were on a case.
“Oh, thank god! Are you alright, sir?” John asked, in keeping with his previous exaggerated manner. He found it easier to act with a persona like that. “Can you sit?”
“She’s going to make you kill one of us, Sherlock,” John said through clenched teeth. “Your brother or me. Just choose me and get it over with.”
Mrs Hudson diplomatically ignored his red eyes. She spoke in a quiet voice. “Hello, dear. I was just wondering if John needed any help with anything whatsoever, regarding the funeral of this family member Hannah said had passed away. An aunt of his, was it?”
“No it’s not. It’s not too late,” Sherlock said aloud, determined, ignoring the surprised look of the nurse, who had apparently returned and was now once again pottering about the room. Then, in a whisper, he pleaded, “Open your eyes. Please, John. I’m here. Can you hear me?” From his bed, he reached out one arm to touch John’s hand. “Don’t leave me. Not like…” He swallowed. “Redbeard.
Now the question was how malignant she was, exactly. This could still be relatively harmless, he told himself. Nothing but an immensely inappropriate prank. No reason to immediately assume the worst.
All she needed to do was get rid of the actual therapist and take her place, and she would find out all about John Watson’s weaknesses and his relationship with Sherlock Holmes in the easiest way she ever could have imagined.
Handing over all control, he surrendered his body to Sherlock, and Sherlock made love to him, tenderly, leaving room for John’s grief over his aunt.
The culprit succeeded in getting up, though, and resuming his flight faster than John could get proper hold of him.
the possibility that anything like this could actually happen. I honestly never...” His voice had been barely audible at those last words, until it died away altogether.
Sherlock sat beside the bed, both hands gripping the arms of his chair. His heart rate was definitely not as calm as John’s.
Sherlock glanced down to press ‘send’ on the text he’d already typed as a draft in the Yard’s group message system beforehand.
Hi guys, sorry for letting you wait over a week in the end, but here's the next chapter, finally. :)
, yes. That’s an excellent metaphor.” He was silent for a bit. “But the thing is, I’ve never really seriously asked myself, let alone
His aunt had made an incredible sacrifice, too, but – as remarkable and amazing as that was – she was, of course, a blood relative.
When he approached the gate, he was already well in character. He casually sauntered up the main driveway, swaying his limbs a bit more than a sober person would. Not too far away, five of the workmen stood huddled around an apparently broken piece of equipment. Perfect. Sherlock strolled over, trying to overhear their conversation so he could chime in.
Sherlock casually looks away to something on the side table, as he pushes his tongue against one cheek.
Better than ever before, in fact, seeing as they’d barely had any of the personal friction they’d used to have regularly in the past. Mainly because Sherlock had stopped putting body parts in the fridge and mould samples in the sink without informing John beforehand. Apparently, as long as he simply
John glanced at him with something of a mischievous smile, or perhaps even a triumphant one. Before Sherlock had time to think any more, John opened his mouth and took him in, making Sherlock’s brain short-circuit. He was vaguely aware of a variety of unfamiliar noises coming from his own throat and this time, when John looked at him, Sherlock was certain he saw an unabashedly victorious grin on the doctor’s flushed face.
Kissing Sherlock gave him the same sensation as seeing fireworks and champagne bubbles and freshly fallen snow and early spring blossoms and the sea, all at once, and then multiplied by a hundred.
Sherlock sounded very unlike himself. Weak. Pathetic. Like when he was faking a different persona. John had seen this little performance often enough.
Sherlock closed his eyes, a slight frown on his forehead as he gritted his teeth in mild frustration.
“Look at me. Can’t do it, not now,” Sherlock said. “Not alone.” He looked away and swallowed, his eyes slightly tearful.
“There’s champagne,” John said, proudly smiling, as they pulled apart. “Hannah had a bottle stashed for the occasion, whenever it should arise.”
Strange, how this Faith woman reminded him of John a little. Well, maybe anyone might remind him of John, because he was all Sherlock thought about, really, when he wasn’t actively trying not to think about him (and even then).
John briefly caught his lip between his teeth and looked down at Sherlock with an awed look. “Oh god, you are so goddamn beautiful, you know that?”
, she might stop breathing, Sherlock. Now is the time to use your magic powers and summon a cab! It will take us there quicker than having to wait for an ambulance.”
Ah, that’s what that big poster and those little figures were from, then. Faintly rang a bell, somewhere at the very back of Sherlock’s mind. He looked around the room carefully, letting his eyes rest on each object individually before moving on to the next. There was nothing specific for which he was looking; it was just a matter of getting a good general impression of this boy, and storing data for future reference. The large number of teddies sitting in a corner of his bed indicated a level of tenderness and playfulness, the pictures of him and his horse just having won a prize showed determination and pride, the Star Wars posters were a sign of imagination.
Sherlock looked slightly puzzled as John continued: “I can’t go to the bloody Louvre like… this. I’m horny as hell.” His voice dropped to an insistent whisper. “I
Worst of all, he had been feeling increasingly unhelpful during their past couple of cases because of all this.
John leaned down to seal the promise with a kiss, gently caressing Sherlock’s tongue with his own in a swirling movement. A wonderful giddiness surged from deep within John’s insides, swelling throughout his body, as it hit him he was only moments away from being
Sherlock gently squeezed his neck. “We’ll figure it out. It will be alright in the end. We just have to find a way to catch
. “Secret door.” Not his imagination, after all. Not being able to tell the difference anymore was starting to get really annoying. But it would stop happening very soon.
The men with the windowpane had disappeared down a little corridor behind the kitchen and could now be heard using various tools. The armed agent seemed to have turned into a decorative statue next to the curtains, keeping his eyes fixed on the street below.
Although Mycroft didn’t join in – obviously – he interestingly didn’t seem to find it awkward either. He just looked on, smiling, openly showing how genuinely happy he was for his little brother – a somewhat unusual state to witness. “Time for the most important present!” Mycroft then called, gesturing to Sherrinford that now was the moment to go and fetch something from the hallway.
Sherlock had to admit it was true that the smell of freshly baked bread did make it feel extra special, somehow – and not only for the anticipation it created of eating the end product itself. Either way, he had decided it was a welcome new tradition.
By the time he reached Baker Street, John felt his hair probably looked like that of a teenager who had put too much gel in it: with little wet peaks sticking out in all directions. He climbed the familiar stairs of 221B with a take-away bag in each hand, exactly as he had done so many times in the past – the resulting series of déjà-vu moments conjuring up a nostalgic smile to his face.
But, sitting at John’s bed, next to the machines that were now in charge of his life, Sherlock made a decision.
Mycroft was probably just trying to soften his feeling of guilt over losing sight of Eurus after Jim’s death. He sat in the other chair next to John’s bed and attempted to look sympathetic.
She’d already called and texted a number of people – Mycroft and Greg, among others – and now the flat was silent again.
Hope that perhaps, their bond could become stronger and better than it had been until now, thanks to him being in a relationship with the odd, posh bloke, who actually turned out to be quite alright once you got to know him a little.
“Well,” John said, when they decided to call it a day and head back to the hotel for the night, “she probably wouldn’t have travelled so far up north from here onwards if she had hidden it in the first village she arrived at.”
“Kids will be getting two of their five-a-day before they’ve even left home!” Smith beamed. He led the crowd into the building and stopped to take a notebook from a woman and sign his name in it. “Breakfast has got to be cool,” Smith explained to the reporters continuing to follow him at his heels like he was the Pied Piper of Hamelin. “And you know what makes it cool when you’re a kid?
Another thing they adapted to was publicly being out as a couple, which was both glorious and a nuisance, as it had led to quite a lot of attention from the media. John had persuaded Sherlock to agree to at least one interview, to the Guardian, to provide some positive LGBTQ representation in a world that could definitely still use some. And Sherlock had to say that, to his surprise, most responses to that article had been very positive.
Harry sat on the sofa and looked from the human skull on the mantelpiece to the dead bat surrounded by pricked up beetles in a frame next to it, to the variety of curious knick-knacks on the desk by the window, and felt a bit like she’d fallen down some surreal rabbit hole.
All he could do was hope he would manage to postpone having to put his newly acquired – but still essentially incomplete – knowledge into practice until after tonight.
On the next floor, in a rather messy and curious looking lounge, five pairs of eyes turned to her, as she entered. There was another fully armed man in AFO uniform, a pretty lady with a small gun at her hip, the odd, posh roommate whose name was escaping her at the minute, and two men in overalls carefully carrying a glass windowpane towards what seemed to be the kitchen.
With red-rimmed eyes, Craig forced himself to look up at John. “Steve is the kindest person you’ll ever meet,” he said, slowly. “He is helpful, and understanding, and sweet, and I wouldn’t know who in the world would ever want to do anything to him,
“You said it didn’t the last time and it wouldn’t with Sherlock, so who was it the last time? Who were you talking about?”
“John, can you please bring me your old walking cane? As soon as possible. Within the hour. It’s important.”
Wait. Why in Heaven’s name was she implying that she was Sherlock’s sister? That was just absurd. He had no sister, just two brothers. One of whom he’d never mentioned to John. For reasons.
A lump appeared in his throat when, upon entering, Hannah handed her to him and he finally held Rosie in his arms again. He carefully sat down on the sofa with her, closed his eyes and pressed his nose against her fluffy hair as he held her close.
Inside, a nurse named Eric came to collect them from the central hall and took them into one of the wings of the closed unit, chattering away all the while. About how nice it was that they’d come to visit. About how lovely the weather had been the week before.
It had to be said John came rather spectacularly hard after a minute or two. Afterwards, Sherlock only needed a few quick strokes to finish himself off, subsequently making them both giggle at the mess he’d managed to make of the both of them in such a short amount of time.
The boy had been missing for a week now. John had spent the entire Monday sitting at home and feeling useless. But above all, he’d mainly been kicking himself for never having realised a thing about Sherlock’s past regarding sex. How could he not have thought anything each time Sherlock had said that he wanted to
He forgot to breathe for a few seconds as he let the words echo in his mind. John loved him. Sherlock wasn’t even sure what that meant, exactly. But once his brain stopped trying to wrap itself around this new piece of information, a relieved smile involuntarily started to spread over his face.
Also, after six weeks of detox, he should be able to do without, really. Even though John’d had a more gradual weaning schedule in mind.
Sherlock pressed his lips together in a smile, feeling ridiculously light and giddy. “Let me just change back into normal clothes first,” he said, “and take all this
So he latched his mouth onto John’s neck and kissed him, tasted his skin and swirled his tongue to the rhythm of his thrusts.
John went through all the motions without feeling much at all. He’d known she would die; it was no surprise. Things needed to be arranged, so he got to it.
Beverly’s eyes widened as if he were seeing a ghost, as Sherlock turned to shake the contractor’s hand – while trying to suppress an even bigger grin. No need to worry about the efficacy of his disguise, then.
“Ah. Yeah, okay.” John closed his mouth, which he realised had been hanging open rather ungracefully, and squinted at Sherlock. “A
Of course, Sherlock let John sleep until he woke up by himself, three hours later (Sherlock having fed Chloe her fruit snack already).
While living and working with Sherlock was certainly never boring, being in a relationship with him was even less so. Although their lives continued to revolve mainly around Sherlock’s
John put a hand on Sherlock’s chest, slowly tracing invisible patterns with his fingers. It felt oddly calming.
With a million, gazillion thanks to Ariane DeVere. Not only the dialogues, but a lot of the descriptions from the show in this chapter and the next four are (almost) straight from her amazing
He had missed him, intensely, deeply, desperately, the past four weeks. But John figured that they could now stop acting estranged, finally. Almost a month had passed, and to the outside world, this case had obviously brought them back together.
Sherlock lifted his head to look at John for a moment and bit his lip in a radiant smile, before dropping his head back on the pillow with a thud.
She’d failed to mention, however, how she had decided to follow one of Jim’s last orders posthumously.
Surrendering himself to John had felt strange and awkward at first (especially without doing anything back), but the way John had looked at him and had kept covering him with tender kisses – as if he’d never seen anything more precious in the world – had made him feel safe in a way he’d never experienced before.
“Well, I’d rather be sick than bored, you know.” She grinned and winked at him. “And anyway, how would I otherwise ever get rid of the stock of honey I’ve got cluttering up my kitchen cabinets, that I got myself talked into at the Barnet fair last month?”
John really shouldn’t have felt relieved about this. He had a past himself, after all. It wasn’t fair. But still he did. As he felt a subtle weight being lifted from his shoulders that he hadn’t known had been there, he saw Sherlock looking away as if he was embarrassed, and it broke John’s heart. “I… I didn’t realise.” He wrapped his arms around his lover. How had they never talked about this properly in two months’ time? “So I was definitely the best Janine, then.”
Firstly, Sherrinford hadn’t given him a present yet, and also didn’t seem to have anything with him, which could mean two things: either he didn’t have one, because no one had taken him shopping (which wouldn’t be entirely unlikely), or some sort of big reveal was waiting…
John thought back to the confusing feelings he had been overcome with the previous afternoon upon seeing Sherlock dress up in women’s clothes. Sherlock was right, of course. He
John did sense that Sherlock was slightly uneasy about not being there for Sherrinford during the holidays, despite his own, rightful argument that he simply couldn’t accompany him everywhere all the time, and it was only healthy for Sherrinford to get used to having to fend for himself a little whenever he was outside the safe confines of the care facility. Even though he would of course largely be unable to communicate. (Mycroft had been very vague as to whether he’d started learning BSL yet. The twat.) But then of course, that was the way it had been for years.
At the start of his hiatus, Sherlock had found out that Jim Moriarty had a sibling. And Sherlock still hadn’t forgiven Mycroft for letting him disappear off the radar. The simple fact that he’d managed to become invisible like that was extremely fishy in itself, Sherlock thought.
“Oh my God!” She gasped and smiled at her father, mouth still open. “Sherlock Holmes!” She looked at Sherlock, radiant. “I
After the revelation of sex turning out to be something that he could most definitely get used to, he now found that having John in his bed with him, fast asleep and looking so peaceful, was a whole new category of wonderful.
Her heart melted. He’d remembered her mentioning that she did crochet. “Oh John, that is so kind of you.”
--Nothing that you will notice, other than that you will most probably stop being stalked. I will explain later. Text me when you’ve done it. SH
During all these considerations, Sherlock made sure he stayed in character, repeating several times where the shop could be found, what it was called and that they definitely had
Apparently, the human mind measures time by the number of new experiences one has in the course of it. She’d read this somewhere, once.
Sherlock took the lube from the bedside table without taking his eyes off John, and carefully smeared some onto his fingers. From there, he applied some between John’s arse cheeks, gently rubbing little circles until John’s moans once more indicated he was ready.
John had seemed to be taking the whole Mary debacle quite well. Better than he, Sherlock thought, lying on the stretcher in the ambulance while he was being examined by Molly. Although you could never really be sure, with John. While he was an open book in some respects, he was completely unreadable in others. He
A few moments later, Smith led Sherlock and John along an empty, bright white-painted corridor, leaving everybody else behind them in the ward.
The intruder had whipped out a pistol and spun around towards Sherlock, who instantly slapped the gun out of his hand. The man swung the large bag he carried up and towards Sherlock’s head but Sherlock managed to grab it and threw it out of reach before punching the man in the face. They traded blows and kicks for some time, until Sherlock succeeded in pulling the man’s balaclava off.
Then, all of a sudden, she’d asked, “John, isn’t there a happy announcement you’d like to make?” She’d beamed a knowing smile at him.
They took it easy, enjoying the scenery, the fresh air and the food, and hurrying only to the extent that they needed to stop looking every afternoon when it got dark. After that, they just sat in their hotel lobby, often next to a cosy hearth fire, either reading – or in John’s case,
It would be but a small consolation for the grieving sister, to have the family pearl back that cost her sibling her life.
He moaned softly as Sherlock pushed all the way inside him, and gasped when a hand suddenly grabbed his cock.
John had seemed so upset when he woke up, believing that Sherlock had lied to him about having a dangerous sister. About Sherlock apparently even choosing to save her over him.
As Sherlock now sat in Lestrade’s office, waiting for the finalisation of the paperwork surrounding his witness statement, and craving a cigarette rather badly, he couldn’t help but think how one of the most baffling features of this whole case had been the fact that when Mary (Rosamund) had entered that clay workshop in Venice last November, looking for a place to hide the Black Pearl that she and her pal Amit Joachim had just stolen, there had apparently been such a large collection of various drying figurines to choose from that she’d been able to pick an actual damned Thatcher bust to hide it in. It had likely been meant as a huge middle finger to him and John, seeing as they’d had a case over four years ago that John had elaborately described on his blog under the title ‘The Six Thatchers’, in which a man had hidden a murder weapon in exactly the same way; inside a still wet Thatcher clay bust. Also a batch of six.
Sherlock held up his hand. “No, I don’t think it was she who took your son. But seeing as the kidnapper apparently chose to use her as a red herring, I would like to know a bit more about her, and especially what information other people might have about her.”
Next, Sherlock let the sex toy slide all the way out, only to push it back in again. Slowly, but impressively deep.
“Hello there,” Sherlock said with faked cheer, although John knew that very few people would recognise it as such. He was quietly pleased to be one of them. “Well, you see, it’s my mother’s brooch,” Sherlock continued. “It’s been broken for years and she’s been meaning to get it repaired all this time, but never got round to it, you see. So I thought I would surprise her by having it fixed for her, you see.”
Of course. After two weeks in hospital, he was back at Baker Street. And he’d slept in Sherlock’s bed. With Sherlock.
Sherlock’s smile widened by its own accord for a second, before Sherlock schooled his face back into a more neutral expression – not entirely successfully, thus sending butterflies scattering inside John’s stomach.
John in his bloody best man’s speech, on top of which he’d referred to ‘the elephant in the room’. What was he supposed to think of that? And furthermore, there had been Sherlock’s cringeworthy, patently obvious jealousy when John had been talking to James Sholto (which Mary had not stopped giggling about for the entire honeymoon), as well as his relapse into drug use straight after the wedding.
He kept looking around. Out the window, where occasionally birds could be seen flying by. At the nurse continually moving about the room, carrying out her duties in cyclical intervals: checking John’s vitals, checking the equipment and tubes, turning the feeds on and off, administering medications, updating the nursing notes, occasionally disrupting the calm with suctioning.
“Sometimes,” Sherlock said, smiling tightly, not quite looking at him. “It sounded a bit like you were in the middle of an action movie. And a pretty scary one.”
Stars exploded behind his eyes as he filled Sherlock, and he kept pressing deeper and deeper into him until his cum leaked out from around his cock.
to be rivals,” she said, grinning. As if this was all just a hilarious joke. “We both have a parent who’s a
“People…” he said, “people seem to think that I am strong or brave, or something. That I have an infallible moral compass. But I’m not the man people thought I was; I’m not that guy. I never could be.” He frowned hard.
Initially, the affair had hardly seemed worth his attention. A girl had come to him because she suspected she was being stalked. But there had been something a tiny bit unusual about it, and Sherlock had been bored, so he had decided to take the case after all. And he still hadn’t solved it to his satisfaction.
Two armed officers had taken up posts at the windows at the front and back, so that she had her hands free again.
“You came to save me, once more, John,” Sherlock said, in front of Molly, Greg, and Mrs Hudson, who had come too. “I never even properly thanked you for that. Still working on my social skills. So this is to say thank you and happy birthday.”
“So did you know him well, then?” John suddenly realised they had switched to using male pronouns, which apparently was okay when talking about the deceased. As if it was only Albert that had died, and not his persona Ally.
A wry smile flickered over Sherlock’s features. After some silence, Sherlock said, hesitatingly, “You could say, I suppose, that I’m indirectly responsible for his death.”
it is. But I’ve never been intimate with anyone, so in a way, I can’t really be sure.” He nodded slowly. “But I really do want to.”
“So, we can hardly do worse, then,” Sherlock said, in an attempt at levity, meant more than anything to suppress his own worry on the earl’s behalf. “I suggest we go to this school immediately, in order to take a good look around.”
mild and slow progressing, they had been harder to recognise. John had been lucky to have realised the cause of it all.
There had been something desperate about John. Something Sherlock had never seen before. Something breathtakingly beautiful: the way he’d muttered an endless string of profanities, the way his breath had hitched, the way he’d cast his eyes upwards, away from what Sherlock was doing to him.
When he and John walked back down the gravel path between the perfectly shaped buxus bushes and bustling workmen to where a cab was waiting for them, with no new clue whatsoever that could lead to the recovery of the boy, and no specific theories to occupy his mind, Sherlock felt a heavy blackness settle in his stomach. John laid a hand on his shoulder and looked at him with concerned eyes. “You alright?”
John thought he saw a glimmer of hope in her eyes and nodded. Of course, he was not a relationship expert by far, but he definitely thought that they might make a nice couple. He could only hope he was not sending her from bad to worse with this move.
Mycroft had had the footage altered and slapped a D-notice on it, because John hadn’t been sure he’d had any will to live left after seeing Sherlock be taken away in handcuffs from Appledore that Christmas night.
John secretly sent out invitations, bought tacky garlands that said ’40!’ and ‘HAPPY BIRTHDAY’ and started stashing drinks and snacks.
And it helped, God, it really did. John hadn’t known he was so susceptible to these kinds of affectionate gestures himself.
In the lounge, she was greeted by the blond woman who had brought little Rosie and her to Mr and Mrs Holmes’s a little over a month ago. (What was her name again?)
“I love you,” John said, proud to finally be able to express the feeling he’d kept bottled up inside for so long. And he secretly adored the way it made Sherlock go all shy.
“I just might, you know,” Sherlock said. “If you compensate by making tea.” He looked at John from the corner of his eye.
He sat back in his chair, as an infinitely sad emptiness crept into him. But even before he became fully aware of it, the void quickly filled with an almost crippling anxiety. Was all this really worth the price Sherlock had had to pay? He and John had become inextricably fused, like two sheets of paper that were glued together and could only be separated with great damage as a result.
“If you exhibit your paintings in a couple of art galleries in London, that can also be a way to get in touch with other painters,” Sherlock explained. “There’s a whole world of art out there.” He smiled.
“I’ll first go and make some coffee,” Sherlock said, as he abandoned John’s lifeless body and left the room.
“Do you know what he did?” Smith asked, looking at John. “He built a hotel, a special hotel, just to kill people. You know, with a hanging room, gas chamber, specially adapted furnace. Stupid. So stupid.”
She took the flower from her ear as she walked towards him. “You looked very sweet. But then...” She bent down and looked into his eyes. When she spoke again, it was with the exact same Scottish voice of the girl on the bus. “... you have such nice eyes.”
On the occasions when John and Rosie came with him to Wantage, John often told Sherlock he was actually not bad. Just not as brilliant as Sherrinford – who was an absolute wizard with paint, obviously. But still, Sherlock did seem to have a certain degree of talent, according to John. Gradually, Sherlock also noticed himself getting better, even though that was not really the point at all; but if you practise something often enough, you’re bound to automatically become more proficient.
“Well, obviously he taught you some of the stuff you use in your work now. Would you even have started doing the work you do, if he hadn’t pushed you like that?”
“Well, even though you can probably ascertain beyond doubt at any given time that those rings are ours, should they ever temporarily leave our fingers for whatever reason – by the size and by the amount and distribution of sebum and so on – for the rest of us it might be useful to include a more specific clue.”
Sherlock, on his end, had the task ahead of donning a perfect disguise, so that Eurus would not recognise him, if she actually did show up. His job during the audition was in turn to recognise Eurus through
Meanwhile, Smith pulled the doll’s head off its body. He smiled up at Sherlock, whose eyes were still fixed on the doll. Smith pushed the head back on and looked round at the kids. “We all love the Queen, don’t we? And I bet she’d love you lot! Money, power, fame.” He paused. “Some things make you untouchable,” Smith added, contently.
“Would you like me to tell you about Eurus? The true version?” Sherlock asked. “Are you ready for that?”
John, meanwhile, gradually slowed down his movements to a casual rolling of his hips, and started planting touchingly gentle kisses along Sherlock’s spine – as if every brush of his lips was a declaration of love, Greg thought. The notion conjured an actual smile to his face, completely against his will, but there it was.
Sherlock sits at John's side in the ICU, Mycroft is not such a rubbish big brother after all, Irene gets a new assignment and Molly feels like she's in a Bond action film.
Seeing Rosie gave him a pang of sadness, that made him realise he’d missed her, too. Such an amazingly beautiful little creature, and so clearly John’s daughter already. He fleetingly considered asking to hold her, before deciding against it.
One day, in Georgia, wherever that was, they’d made so much money (“through a stroke of luck in the workings of supply and demand”, Rose had used to say; something about someone wanting to have what had been exactly within
Without breaking eye contact, Sherlock let himself drop back onto the bed, so John could remove his underwear altogether from his legs. John then stepped out of his and crawled over Sherlock, one foot still on the floor. His cock was oddly hovering in mid-air somewhere above Sherlock’s crotch.
Honestly, the irony of a man going to see someone for his trust issues and his therapist then assaulting him was the harshest turn of fate Sherlock thought he’d ever seen befall someone.
At that instant, however, his attention was drawn back to the table near the window. He couldn’t exactly hear the words, but Violet and Bob’s body language clearly indicated that the moment Sherlock had anticipated had arrived. They were bickering about who had invited whom.
She had asked him some strange, detailed questions about how Mary had died, by way of introduction. He supposed it was customary. But still. He’d simply said he didn’t want to talk about it. “An old lady shot her. It was an accident.”
Experiencing all of these revolutionary little steps together made it feel almost like co-parenting. On top of that, he and John often needed only half a sentence to understand one another, and they were almost always on the same page about how to raise a baby anyway. Despite their own irregular habits, or perhaps because of them, they adhered to a strict schedule for sleeping and eating times for Rosie, setting timers in both their phones for everything. They never let her play with things that weren’t designed to be baby toys (the point of safety regulations having suddenly become a lot more obvious and urgent to Sherlock). And they never,
The rage continuing to swell inside of John was now threatening to become a proper storm. “No need to keep lying about it, Sherlock. Mycroft as much as admitted it to my face! And she told me herself.”
It was not Faith. At least, it wasn’t the Faith who he’d spent the evening with. She looked incredibly similar in height and size; she had the same style and length of hair, although it was a very slightly different shade of mid-blonde, and she was wearing similar glasses. But this Faith looked fancy, happy, wealthy. She was beaming.
in fact the fanciest hotel in the city, of course, established 1897. “You just wanted to make sure we didn’t leave on tomorrow’s flight without properly wrapping up the case with Interpol.” He sighed, throwing John a look. “Rather transparent, don’t you think? We’ll consider it, though. Good evening.”
-- Would like to visit my aunt. But not as myself. Can you maybe let your brother arrange something? (Also, where is she being held?) J
John’s eyes went soft. “If it means I get to see that incredibly cute look on your face when you cuddled her just now more often…
That was hardly proof it had been Mary. (Rosamund.) Not that there was any doubt in Sherlock’s mind.
. Just that I was some sort of agent in the past. Nothing more specific than that. And he never will, don’t worry. You know how I keep my private and professional life strictly separate.”
The horrible realisation then dawned on John that all the people who had been ‘talking’ all this time would now righteously gloat about having been right from the beginning. But then again, it was a small price to pay for what they had now. On top of which, it was actually quite funny, in spite of the bitter edge of irony that everybody had seen what they had both failed to acknowledge all those years.
“It’s Molly!” he called back over his shoulder. And then, in a gentle voice, “Molly, do come in. How are you?”
Nevertheless, in spite of all this, Sherlock still couldn’t quite reconcile himself with his own satisfied and light-hearted mood now that John was alone again. Was he being insensitive again by not feeling sad for him?
. Sherlock had let him strangle him, just so that he could record the proof and get Smith behind bars. Risking his life once more for the sake of justice. But the bastard had been on to him.
, just as I know that you’ve been sleeping with at least two of the other board members and several times the amount of nurses. Also, your cat has galanitis because your wife is against immunisation, which poses a serious health risk to patients with heart failure, whom you could easily infect via the cat’s skin particles on your clothes. Now, if you just let me stay in that room, I will keep all this information to myself. How about that?”
But later she’d been killed for real, in some country far away. Pakistan or Iran, or something. Or so John had told Molly.
emotional context, then?” he asked, gesturing to all of her outfit. As a means of intimidation, he casually took one bit of fabric of her bright green sleeve between his thumb and index finger, and raised his eyebrows questioningly. He then went so far as to touch the bottom hem of her shirt in the same fashion as well, feigning disapproval of her choice of clothing.
and on the brink of losing control. It was a somewhat worrying but beautiful sight and it made Sherlock want to get to know more of this side of him that was now meant only for him.
He promised her that he would. In turn, he made her promise not to tell anyone, for now, which made her giggle, like she was part of a secret pact – just like the one she’d been convicted for, but unimaginary, this time (and for a much cheerier cause).
“I’m not sure. I’ll just open the door a little and peep outside… I can see tiny lights through the windows.” She was whispering almost inaudibly now.
It took John and Sherlock another cab ride to and from the hospital to bring their landlady the things she needed for her overnight stay there. They spoke very little, although Sherlock did attempt a conversation about the various species of Clostridium bacteria and the symptoms they generally caused in humans and different kinds of animals. John just nodded and smiled occasionally. The adrenalin had still not faded from his system.
“You,” John said, hiding a wide grin by looking down as he shook his head. “I think this might warrant champagne, don’t you?”
“Indeed I can’t.” Sherlock put down his knife and fork and looked at John. “I know this is probably stupid, after so many years, but I feel I need to find out the exact truth. Discover what really happened when Redbeard died. Things simply don’t add up.” He shook his head in frustration.
“Surely you of all people must be able to figure out where those two hid the pearl, if you tried,” Molly said to Sherlock, smiling timidly. “I mean, if I were Mary, I would have hidden it at the first location I came to while running. Can’t you… I don’t know… retrace her steps or something?”
The neighbour’s dog had ended up at the vet the next day with toxicosis, and only barely pulled through.
Occasionally, Sherlock still got overwhelmed with anger and frustration at how all of the grownups around Sherrinford had jumped to the wrong conclusion when Redbeard had died, and how no one had bothered to make sense of the broken leash with the missing piece.
“Nothing’s certain; nothing’s written. My old life – it was full of consequences. The danger was the fun part, but you can’t outrun that forever. You need to remember that, so... I’m giving you a case.”
What followed was a frantic search for canvases on which his brother had painted other well-known parts of the world: Sydney Harbour, Macchu Piccu, the pyramids of Egypt. He held them up at his little brother, and Sherlock shook his head at each of them, feeling the lump in his throat grow.
Harry had been feeling horrible about that ever since, but somehow, she hadn’t been able to muster the initiative to get in touch. She didn’t even know how Mary died, except that it had been some sort of accident.
“Never mind. Sorry, I didn’t mean…” He guessed her past profession didn’t really matter. Then something occurred to him. “Of
Then he found an old pencil and a notebook with a couple of empty pages, and started to practise drawing what he wanted to ask Sherrinford.
A warmth filled John’s chest. Ever since Sherlock’s return, John had gotten to know such a different side to him. He wasn’t sure whether the prat had finally learned how to care, or simply learned how to
John, longed for him to take over control and let Sherlock switch off his mind, to dictate all of Sherlock’s bodily sensations, to fuck him slow and deep, to
“Yes. I’m right here,” he could hear John’s voice saying, close to him. He sounded worried. He gently took Sherlock’s hand in his. “I’m right here, Sherlock,” he repeated, softly, not letting go. “You’re going to be alright, you hear me? You will stay in hospital for a while and you’re going to get better now.”
So while IC doctors were busy saving John’s life, Sherlock called Lestrade – who he correctly expected was still at the therapist’s house, having arrived only after the ambulance had left. He paced up and down the hospital corridor as he spoke into his phone. “Greg, you need to arrange security for John. Right away. She’ll come back and try to kill him again. There’s no doubt about it. He can’t be left alone in the hospital.”
“Interesting, isn’t it?” Sherlock said. “I have theorised before that if one could attenuate to every available data stream in the world simultaneously, it would be possible to anticipate and deduce almost anything.” He sniffed and looked down, pondering how impressive it was, in a way, that his mind had autonomously put together the information he must have distilled from various sources into one plausible but fake context.
When he opened his eyes, Sherlock was looking at him with a curious expression, as if he was cataloguing new data. John didn’t care; he’d just had one of the best bloody orgasms of his life.
On top of Chloe’s grumpy phase being a reason to take it easy, John was also organising Sherlock’s fortieth birthday party for two weeks after. That’s when they would have a house full of people already.
“Honestly, it’s the very least I could do, Aunt Viv.” He looked around uncomfortably. “How are they treating you here?” His eyes were full of concern, full of sadness.
Upon entering 221B, it was a few moments before Sherlock realised that there was something different about his flat.
An additional surprise was that he found it gave him an appetite – contrary to how his body would have responded during the previous couple of days.
The small talk part had come surprisingly easy. They’d instantly fallen into a sort of pleasant banter, which had soon led to John leaning in ever closer and amicably bumping his shoulder to Sherlock’s several times. The whole process hadn’t actually even involved any kissing until they’d arrived at John’s halls of residence. And when John had pressed his mouth to Sherlock’s under the unpleasant light of the hall’s fluorescent lamp, Sherlock had been so focused on getting the technique right, that there hadn’t really been any room in his head for other thoughts. Well, only some vague considerations regarding his goal to continue down this path to getting John undressed and to ascertain whether or not he had a tattoo of a bat. Which was the whole point of why he was doing this.
John, pretty much anything was fine – which had been a rather astounding realisation. Information was everything, it seemed. Which made sense, knowing that John’s main reason to see a psychologist had been his ‘trust issues’. There were just certain kinds of surprises he didn’t like. Which was something Sherlock could live with. Quite easily. He would climb the highest mountain to please John, and this had merely been a tiny hill.
Mycroft swallowed, staring into infinity once more. He had always known, of course, that Sherlock and John had something very special going on between the two of them, but seeing now how deep the roots of that relationship had become anchored, Mycroft started to feel a bit like an astronaut lost in space, adrift, slowly becoming more and more removed from the world that he’d known; all alone.
They never held hands in public, because usually they were either trying to keep a low profile while shadowing some criminals, or actually chasing them down in the streets of London. They didn’t often go out for purposes not case-related.
John couldn’t help but grin at the startled eyes in the rear view mirror. “Then again,” he said, more serious as he turned to Sherlock, “there is one motive we hadn’t really properly considered yet, which is one that the fair
John cursed softly. Sherlock was right; he’d completely lost his mind. He rested his forehead against the nape of Sherlock’s neck, taking a calming breath. Then he awkwardly pulled his pants back up over his still erect cock, unable to suppress the impulse to press it against the glittery fabric covering Sherlock’s arse one more time as he continued to marvel at the way the seemingly liquid gold fell across his back and shoulders. The tantalising mix of feminine and masculine was driving him mad. It was as if hitherto separate compartments of his sexual desire were suddenly united, creating new cross connections in his mind that ignited with sparks of a fresh intensity.
This was one of the few BSL signs Sherlock actively remembered coming across during his research into BSL teachers and their introductory YouTube videos, and which he could therefore already understand.
Their eyes met for a brief moment, and John quickly mirrored Sherlock’s ‘It’s Christmas’ expression.
(A slight feeling of embarrassment crept into the corners of his mind as he realised he and Mycroft were basically still acting like children, playing the ‘yes means no’ game.)
Sherlock thought back to all the hours he’d spent shadowing this guy while trying to dismantle Jim’s network (before erroneously concluding he was not involved), and something started to nag at the back of his mind. The androgynous-looking, genderqueer brother, who he’d never seen interacting with any friends or relatives. No sister in sight.
As John gradually started to discern the words, he realised they were customer’s names. This was the bloody sales book and not the purchase book, dammit. He hastily put it back and was about to grab what was hopefully the right one from a higher shelf when he heard footsteps right on the other side of the door. Too late. He jumped to where the desk phone was and pretended to have just put it down, right in time.
“Other than yourself?” Sherlock asked. It seemed that for every minute he spent in the man’s presence, Sherlock’s repulsion for him grew. Such a classic example of a creep craving an audience. But now was not the time for emotions or opinions.
John grinned. “And here I was, thinking you were busy solving a murder.” He raised one eyebrow and one corner of his mouth. Sherlock loved how John had never stopped flirting with him, even though they were already together.
There. That should definitively convince Bob, and indirectly Jack, that there was no point going through with their scheme, as the ship had already sailed.
After that, he waited. It was vital to intercept and delete the replies before Bob and Violet could read them themselves.
“Now, regarding Mummy’s birthday,” Mycroft began, visibly tired. “I’m arranging a little dinner party on 28 October. You will be coming, I presume?” He looked from Sherlock to John.
Beside the calm contentedness that he felt on the one hand, there was, however, also a considerable amount of anxiousness seeping in at every corner, of course; at not only being outside of the house, but being 30,000 feet
Blackbeard’s little tail was beating wildly against her basket, as Chloe was trying to climb in with her.
She shook her head, briefly looking down at her hands, as if this embarrassed her. “No, I haven’t had a boyfriend in... about two years.”
He’d shadowed John for a few days, had gotten to know him quite a bit, from a distance. John Watson was easy-going, sportsmanlike, jovial, quite popular within his small group of friends. Very considerate and gentlemanlike on one occasion (which is when Sherlock first had very much started to doubt John’s possible involvement in the crime he was trying to solve, but of course you should never draw any conclusions based on such hunches).
He quickly put a pillow under his bottom, infinitely grateful for the internet and its inexhaustible source of information.
Five hours later, when he’d satisfied himself that he had all the information he needed (the number of forums about how to have gay sex had proven to be rather impressive), Sherlock started looking for mail order companies that didn’t look terribly dodgy. When he found a rather posh one of the kind he was looking for, the dildo department was only one click away.
That evening, after an early supper, as Sherlock was putting the leftovers in the fridge, John walked up to him and hugged him from behind. “I think
“Culverton’s doing a visit,” she said. “The kids would love to meet you both. I think he sort of promised.”
When he opened his eyes, Sherlock was looking at him with a curious expression, as if he was cataloguing new data. John didn’t care; he’d just had one of the best bloody orgasms of his life.
John jumped into action, crying “Oh my goodness!” while randomly waving his arms about and grabbing his own face, before he stammered, “Should I call an ambulance? I will call an ambulance! You... you stay with him.”
Just then, several police officers came running into the corridor, efficiently capturing and handcuffing the surprised abductor.
“I promise I will try,” John replied truthfully, already having a hard time focusing on the conversation they were having.
“Oh, I sent and deleted a text,” Sherlock added. “You might get a reply but I doubt it.” He settled back into his seat.
over the years. Even Irene had seen that there was something between them, going so far as to insist they were already a couple.
When just a quarter before closing time, they passed a shop with art supplies, Sherrinford stopped to look and made it clear he wanted to go inside. So they did.
Was the dog really for him to keep, though? Maybe the present was that he was allowed to just hold a puppy for a while?
John snorted out a laugh, before turning quiet again. Still wearing his latex gloves, he picked up the ‘Mary Morstan’ passport and looked at the photograph once more.
Each of those options slowly started to conjure a myriad of scenarios in his mind, each more horrific than the other.
A bit later than I promised, sorry! The whole proofreading process always takes more time than I anticipate, and it doesn't help that I'm a bit of a perfectionist. :D
.” He avoided her gaze in an attempt not to let her see straight into his soul. But it was no use. He bit his lip briefly, before quietly blurting out, “I’m so happy with him, you have no idea.”
By the time they had checked into the hotel and were finally up in their room with all their bags and a cot from reception, though, it had become dark – even though it was still only 4:15 pm.
“I love you,” John said once again, his voice strange and raw this time. “And the whole world will know. I will be your husband and you will be mine.” He looked at Sherlock, dead serious now, emotion filling behind his eyes. “Promise me we won’t ever let anything drive us apart ever again. Promise me we’ll stay together forever.”
Sherlock frowned. “But you will never be able to make love to me the way you did before you knew,” he said quietly, looking down at their hands.
Sherlock’s heart started to beat faster, euphoria creeping in: an even stronger feeling than he’d had just now upon finding the lost pearl. He thought back to their first week in Norway. John had still needed to sit down quite often during their expeditions. But not the last couple of days. They had walked for more than an hour on end, sometimes.
After a minute, though, Sherlock pulled away, uncomfortable. He was starting to get hard and would rather die than have John notice. “Listen, John,” he said, sitting up. “I think… I think we should maybe talk about what we want and don’t want out of this… relationship… that we’re in now. Please tell me if there’s, er… certain things you don’t want to happen.”
me, until now. But you could see straight through me from the first day. You see something precious in me that even I never saw in myself before, until I met you.” John noticed his voice was starting to sound funny now, but he didn’t care. “And that is why this is more than just being in love. You actually make me feel good about myself.”
Thankfully, Rosie was in a phase where she could contently occupy herself with a couple of clothes pegs or some pinecones for half an hour easily. When she got bored, John and Sherlock took turns reading picture books to her.
“So tell me, how are you and John? I’m just so delighted that you’ve finally found each other,” she beamed.
Wow, I think this is the fastest I’ve ever produced a new chapter! Also, this is the first chapter beyond series 4, so from here it’s all made up exclusively by yours truly. :)
Sally looked at him defiantly from under her raised eyebrows and silently pushed into his hand one of the paper cups of coffee she’d been holding.
“I think she wants her bottle,” Hannah said with a weary smile, as she headed for the kitchen with Rosie on her hip.
As soon as the cogwheels in his head started turning again, hundreds of slots subsequently clicked into place – like loose ends suddenly connected – and he saw the entire last five years in a different light, making it clear as day that he had been making a wealth of wrong assumptions the whole time he’d known John. It was like unexpectedly landing on a different planet.
The Ledbury indeed was the perfect setting for Sherlock’s set-up. It was modern, with stylish chandeliers and long curtains not quite covering ceiling-high mirrors – and, most importantly, obviously expensive.
John tried to wrap his brain around all these new facts. Had they literally been dancing around each other for years,
And it should hopefully do the trick for the outside world as well. Ironically, there wasn’t even an untrue word in there. Crikey, he should really try to get better at lying. Although, as long as a twisted version of the truth sufficed, he was much more comfortable with that.
He’d had the extraordinary sensation of knowing almost exactly what to do, without the usual apprehension of perhaps getting it wrong, as he had often experienced during sex with women. And then Sherlock had managed to, well... press some buttons in one of his hitherto undiscovered erogenous zones, actually making John consider things he had never been keen on thinking about before – which oddly had been kind of freeing as well in its own way.
“Oh, please don’t go anywhere,” she said. “I’m sure the therapist who actually lives here wouldn’t want blood on the carpet.” She paused briefly, as if thinking. “Oh, hang on, it’s fine. She’s in a sack in the airing cupboard.”
“I’m really sorry, but I’m honestly not authorised to approve that.” From his tone of voice, it was quite clear that the nurse was not in fact sorry at all.
She was frowning. “I’ve never seen you two bring her on any cases with the Yard, though,” she said, thoughtfully. “Were things really going that well between John and Mary? I never actually had that impression.” (It seemed like more of an afterthought than an actual question, thank God.)
“Yes!” he heard Sherlock chime in enthusiastically. “You know, I actually happen to have heard that the owner of the two largest South African goldmines passed away the other day, but they’re trying to keep it quiet, at least for now, because of all the political fuss and power shifts that would ensue. Because there’s so many interests, you know?”
how long it’s been.” He really is more drunk than he has been in at least as long as he hasn’t gotten laid. “Or a simple blowjob; that would do very nicely as well!” he adds, as an afterthought.
Sherlock had deliberately chosen a posh restaurant that was virtually deserted at 10 am to meet up with Mycroft, while John was busy at home with the practicalities of Aunt Viv’s burial.
Sketchy lines quickly became people, and 'people' became familiar faces. With just a few well-placed lines, he created specific backgrounds and settings. The kitchen, the playground. Facial expressions captured perfectly: surprise, frustration, puzzlement.
Sherlock’s face suddenly shifted into a bored expression, his eyes turning upwards. “Yes, Mrs. Hudson, do come in.”
Sherlock looked shyly at the floor, cursing himself for blushing like a kid. Then again, John was blushing as well and it only added to his attractiveness. Good Lord.
John had been so selfish, he now saw, to deny them both this – intimacy – all those weeks. He’d actually, ridiculously, on one level, thought himself so noble for not wanting this at the time, but what good had that been to Sherlock? He was still a sexual being, in spite of everything. John shouldn’t have allowed himself to make the problem bigger for Sherlock by blocking it all out, he realised now.
He wanted to kiss Sherlock, hold him, tell him he loved him – but he just sat there stupidly on his knees, frozen, his whole body as stiff as his prick.
With a quick grin in John’s direction, Sherlock slowly got up and casually walked over to their table.
Sherlock looked at him, apparently puzzled. “No. Not hypothermia.” He seemed to hesitate, uncomfortable.
He’d always hated people who had what they called ‘a perfect life’, but now he was one of them. He had everything. Everything that was perfect to
After a half hour drive through a rather dull and flat landscape, they arrived in a lush, green village.
Soon after, he felt John’s firm hands on his arse cheeks, pulling them slightly apart, before John’s prick tenderly caressed the sensitive area around his entrance, spreading the lube around as he circled it. There were also some teasing fingers – must be thumbs, Sherlock thought – very lightly stroking that mystifying erogenous zone where his buttocks met his thighs, causing a local eruption of giddying goose bumps, accompanied by an impatient whimper involuntarily escaping Sherlock’s throat. He didn't want or need much foreplay and he hoped John could tell.
women, and it will end up all going down the pan again just like it has before.” He looked away, smoking the last bit of his cigarette.
Sherlock let these facts sink in for a second. “Looks like a very attentive kidnapper to me,” he mumbled.
Once Sherlock was back with two lidded paper cups, John ceremoniously put down his untouched beer and they drank in silence for a while.
I have, however, decided to neglect my family a little bit less and not to prioritise this fic above all else anymore, as I have been doing for the past seven months. Therefore, I will aim for two updates a month rather than four, from now on. :)
Mary and Sherlock had each had their own way of tormenting him. In spite of everything, however, he’d always known that Sherlock was a good person, deep inside. Even though, yes, he had hurt John, quite regularly, from the very start. By not always taking him seriously, not involving him in important stuff, not respecting his personal boundaries. And then by not bothering to tell John that he wasn’t actually dead.
“Excellent,” Sherlock whispered, secretly a little grateful to DI Hopkins for giving him something else to focus on, even if just for a few minutes. “Suddenly he sees himself in quite a different light now that he’s dumped the specs,” he continued. “Even has a spray tan. But he’s clearly not used to his new personal grooming ritual.”
So the thing with the conversation Sherlock had with the girl on the plane is, that I left Sherlock’s side of the dialogue virtually intact, because that was what John could hear, so that’s the same in both versions. What the girl replied in this version (‘reality’), however, is different from TFP, because that version is what John imagined she *might* have said during his dream. :)
Sherlock shook his head to expel all other thoughts, like a dog ridding himself of unpleasant raindrops. It worked.
After he put his phone away again, they drank tea in companionable silence for a bit, until John left for the loo.
“Oh.” John nodded and swallowed. “Good. That’s good. That you’re delving into what happened exactly, I mean. Did you learn anything new?”
? Had John just implied that they would inadvertently end up being one of those unbearably dull couples after all? What reason would John
Nevertheless, he felt a fierce spike of adrenalin not only because of feeling Sherlock’s tongue prodding his mouth with such enthusiasm, but also because of shamelessly defying common decency by outright kissing a man in public.
“The case,” Sherlock elucidated. “I predict there will be some discord between Violet and Bob tonight a little after eight at The Ledbury. We need to be there in order to ensure a happy ending.” He got into a half-sitting position and nuzzled John’s neck, adding, with some innuendo, “I think we might just have time for a shower.”
After staring into nothingness for a bit more, he eventually picked up the unfinished crossword on the coffee table and decided he might as well try to complete it now. Not a very spectacular way of spending his last evening before going back to work, but his life wasn’t that spectacular anymore in the first place. And maybe that was just as well.
Wonderfully lost in a boundless universe of eternity filled with nothing but pleasure, the rollercoaster exit suddenly came into view, racing towards him as his senses were being flooded by an overwhelming mix of stimuli.
As Sherlock learnt alongside Sherrinford from Arnold and his DVDs, which they watched for homework, John took the shortcut of learning BSL from spoken YouTube videos, which was naturally much easier and faster, as things were simply being translated and explained. This way, John only needed to invest a couple of hours a week, contrary to the Holmes brothers’ three-times-a-week half-day sessions.
Then a portrait of Mummy appeared from behind a stack. Sherrinford held it up questioningly. He vaguely pointed at her, then at the Red Square painting.
Nevertheless, he didn’t look away. “You, however,” he said, willing himself not to show any emotion and to appear unperturbed, “deliberately shot John in the head at close distance.” But God, he was exhausted, and all but overflowing with an explosive mix of rage and sorrow. “We are
It was only on his way back home, sitting on the train, that Sherlock realised that there was no way Sherrinford could have known what effect opening the gas tap would have. He couldn’t have deliberately killed his fellow residents.
John pretended to think about that for a second, and answered, just before he burst out into giggles, “Let me just wash your cum out of my hair, and then yes, I would love to.”
It was as if they were explorers in an unknown land, mapping each other’s bodies as they journeyed on, as well as newly discovering their own.
There was a thin, powdery layer of snow in the UK as well when they arrived home the next week, well-rested and satisfied with their successful mission.
John snickered. He would not soon forget how he’d eventually cornered the guy in an alley just the second a stag party came out through the back door of the adjacent club. He wasn’t exactly used to having an audience when he was holding people at gunpoint and making them lie flat on the floor.
“Because Mrs Hudson’s right. I’m burning up,” Sherlock said, dryly. Then he stood. “But I need you to know, John – I need you to see that up here,” he said, gesturing to his temples with both hands, “... I’ve still got it. So when I tell you that this is the most dangerous, the most despicable human being that I have ever encountered; when I tell you that this… this
The ride to Priory School in the earl’s private car took less than an hour. During the ride, Baron Beverly, as he preferred to be called, showed them some pictures of his Arthur – a serious but happy looking boy with dark brown eyes – and told them all there was to know about his son. He was eleven years old and had only started boarding this year. His mother had recently left them and had moved to the south of France. “Edith loves Arthur very much, but didn’t cope with being a mother very well. She has Asperger’s Syndrome,” Beverly explained. In spite of these domestic troubles, Arthur was doing well enough at school. He especially excelled in languages and wanted to become a poet. “He has never run off or disappeared like this before,” the earl said. “It’s very much unlike him to make us worried.”
something. Having a purpose. Literally the only problem is I look like a drunk. Is that really so bad?”
It was as if John had all of a sudden landed on a different planet and felt he acutely needed a plan of action to safely explore the new territories. But he had no map.
John pretended to think about that for a second, and answered, just before he burst out into giggles, “Let me just wash your cum out of my hair, and then yes, I would love to.”
The birth of his daughter had at least given him some joy in his life. And loving her had turned out to be easier than he’d thought.
Nevertheless, John had ended the sexting after a few weeks, when the novelty had worn off and the mysterious ‘E’, whom he knew nothing about, had started to become a little too inquisitive about his private life. He was grateful to her for having given him a fix that he’d badly needed, but that was it. He didn’t really want her, in the end. He wasn’t entirely sure what it was he wanted, in that respect – or maybe he did, and had decided that it was impossible anyway – but either way, thinking about it tended to make him crabby.
