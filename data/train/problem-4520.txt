He wished someone else had made him feel the way Evan had. He wished someone else had made him feel the way Dean had. A cold feeling crept through his veins. What if there was never going to be someone else? He was a whore. A sinner and a siren. Who would ever want him for more than a hole?
Her arm spines flexed again. Castiel decided it was in excitement and not anger. She must be from Kuqq. She tapped a code into the panel. "We've been calling this one Dean for short. Its last owner called it De*anlk."
His master scooped him up from the table and carried him to the bedroom. His master put him down on the bed and spread his blanket over Dean.
His grandmother disappeared down the hall with Deidre and came back a few moments later with a clean shirt.
"Okay." Castiel wasn't sure how he felt about that. He didn't enjoy doing this. He doubted he'd enjoy
Castiel laid where he was and watched Dean scramble to get dressed. It was sunset. Dean was supposed to be home helping with the evening chores. Castiel stretched languidly. He'd be in trouble too but it wouldn't be any less if he rushed home.
Terror shot through Castiel. What did he say? What if Daven had been lying? He squared his shoulders and tried to look confident. "Daven said you might have some coins for me."
Qech let out a sad sigh. "Ah. That's unfortunate. They do so much better in groups." He pointed his head towards Dean and his pet. "And you get to watch more of their natural behaviours."
Anna snatched the packet from his hands and opened it up. She inspected the needles carefully and nodded to herself just like their grandmother would. "Do we keep them or ask Gabriel to trade them for something else?"
Dean was his usual grumpy self about being bathed. He'd twist away or chatter darkly at him while eyeing the sanitizing clothes like he wanted to bite them.
At breakfast his grandmother laid out their plans for the day, gathering forest foods and getting charms ready for market. Hannah and Anna added in a few chores that needed to be done, mostly repairs to the chicken coop.
Dean clutched at his master's arm and leaned forward to lick up his dinner. He sniffled and snorted through his meal. His master hissed softly at him and rubbed one huge knuckle up and down the side of Dean's neck. He draped the big dagger tail across Dean's legs.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and pushed as hard as he could. He screamed and swore as the head finally pushed free. He pushed again and then his grandmother was shoving a squalling baby into his arms.
along this twelve feet of corridor. He just couldn't see the damn thing. Either his newest master could see beyond or below his own range of vision or else he was hooked up to the ship. But he knew there was
Dean sat up and looked down at Castiel's mating tail. He chattered and trailed his fingers along where the warming sheath ended.
He was still twelve days out from his next stop and he was spending it torturing himself with pent up sexual frustration. His pet's delicate licks and a barely satisfying warming sheath were poor substitutes for partners.
effective. Dean had barely left his side since after his punishment. He had enjoyed it at first, having Dean eager to sit with him and cuddle up to him, but after a few days of Dean being constantly underfoot it was aggravating.
At the time Dean had been sure then that he was going to get punished for whatever it was he had apparently done but his master had disappeared for a bit then come back and pet him. Dean figured he must have squashed the second tail in his sleep or something but that his master had figured out he hadn't meant to hurt him.
Dean grinned at him. He nodded. He dropped his hand down to give Castiel's cock a few affectionate tugs before kissing him again and springing to his feet.
Castiel looked down when he realized the chattering had tapered off. He hummed in pleasure. Dean had fallen asleep, cuddled against his leg. Castiel finished up his project then picked Dean up. It was rare that their sleep schedules lined up but it was always pleasant when they did.
His master turned around and picked him up. He settled Dean on his hip. Dean wrapped his arms around his master and shook. His master trailed a claw through Dean's hair and started hissing and growling right along with the dragon.
of his delivery service was that it was discreet. He sold discretion as much as he sold efficiency. Crew would talk, they always did.
He curled his claws into his palm and tried to pet it again. This time it was more than happy to let him rub his knuckles along its neck and cheek.
Castiel did as told and was quickly back with a kettle of water that had been left abandoned all morning. His grandmother said it would do.
Castiel sniffed. He knew he wasn't a beta. Before he had been told to leave all the other children at the schoolhouse had made sure he never forgot that.
Castiel looked over the row of cages in dismay. Did he really want a second-hand pet? It would come with all the problems of its previous owner.
"No. This way," Evan said. He crawled onto the bed pushing Castiel onto his back. He knelt between Castiel's legs. "I like to do it this way."
He turned back around and unclipped Dean from the leash and collar. He picked up his pet and carried him to the bedroom.
The priest glowered at them again, haughty and red faced. He took Adam Winchester's hand and dragged him through the small crowd they'd drawn.
"Getting yourself ready should feel good," his grandmother concluded. She grinned at him. "Good enough to do it without them." She pointed at the bowl. "Work some of that inside yourself. You'll feel better in a day or two."
If it hadn't made his master so angry Dean would have thought it was funny. It reminded him of a tv show he had watched as a kid; something about a blue, maybe purple, giant lizard that wanted to teach kids about sharing.
Castiel was at war with himself. Dean didn't seem to understand what his mating tail was. He just seemed to be interested in the new thing his master had decided to do. It wasn't upsetting Dean to have his master's mating tail wrapped around him. But Dean didn't
Castiel spent the rest of the day in his office. Dean spent the day alternating between napping in his lap and wandering around his office while he chattered away at things— a trait Castiel had learned most humans carried. They didn't seem to be able to differentiate between something living and something inanimate.
His master stooped down to put a collar and leash on him. An electric feeling of excitement raced through Dean. His master was going to take him
Castiel stopped in the arch way. His family was staring at him. He stared back in confusion. He looked down at himself. His face turned red. His pants were soaked—
It wasn't Dean's fault that all he knew was what he'd seen through happenstance. Castiel only knew what he did because his grandmother didn't care for propriety and Gabriel was his cousin. He came from a family of sinners an witches. It wasn't something to be proud of but it offered a practical education.
Castiel worked fast. If he could just get through brushing Dean's teeth without incident he'd be happy to praise his pet for a job well done even if his pet had sullenly sat there and glared at him the whole time.
His master rolled a ball the size of Dean's head around in his clawed hands. It was some kind of transport sized sanitizer unit. Dean had seen them before with other masters but none of his previous masters had been big enough to just carry one around like a toy.
Reluctantly, he put Dean's bowl down on the floor and tied Dean off to his pet bed. A well behaved pet was more important than satisfying an urge. He went to his chair and caught up on the local news. Dean whined and chattered at him for a short while but eventually he wrapped himself in his blanket and settled in to eat.
Castiel flinched with pain when Daven pulled out. He felt a warm trickle of come leak from his hole. Daven laughed and ran a finger over Castiel's hole.
Cepheus didn't pay him as much as Daven or Evan but he only ever wanted his mouth and he didn't treat Castiel like a stray to be kicked out of his business or leer at him afterwards.
He squirmed against his master until he had his face shoved into the one soft spot on his master's belly.
Dean just stared. English. Real actual English coming out of a human and not some stupid toy that mimicked him back.
The human inside squeaked then curled into a ball and shivered. Castiel wasn't an expert in human behaviours but there were very few species that did that when they were happy. He moved on to the next one.
Castiel backtracked. He didn't want to offend his host. He already couldn't go back to the pet kennel after the fiasco with the receptionist. He needed to let his pet socialize as long as possible if he didn't want him underfoot every waking hour to the next stop.
Hannah and Anna raced around the end of the cart next, shrieking out Kali's name and yanking her into hugs.
A prickle of fear crept into him. He had posted an ad asking if any human owners on the station would be interested in a play date after his debacle with Uth. Had he accidentally posted it to the personal ads section instead of the pet section?
"What the hell..." Dean stared at the dragon. Maybe it wasn't going to eat him after all if it let a kid just climb all over its legs.
He put up with being shoved around and wiped down but he couldn't take it anymore when they got to the damn toothbrush part. He
"I'm surprised actually," Castiel said. "Dean doesn't usually take so well to having his hands restrained."
Castiel looked up at him from his seat on the bed. A nervous feeling settled into his stomach. He wasn't sure what to do. Daven Hills told him what to do. Evan Fawkes was just looking at him. Was he supposed to do something? Was he supposed to say something? To wait? To go? Did Evan Fawkes even want him today?
He went over to the pile of tools and picked out the one his master was asking for. He didn't know what the long stick thing with a red ball on the end actually did but it was the size of his calf and damn heavy.
He carried Dean to his bedroom and placed him at the bottom of the bed. Dean snuffled, half-awake, and reached for his blanket.
Castiel glared at her but slumped down to the bed. He ignored the probe of her fingers around the rim of his stretched hole. Two contractions passed before she was yelling at him to push again.
"The priest saw me feeding one of Brianne Shields babies." Castiel admitted. "He looked angry but he didn't come over."
Dean sleeping on the floor lasted three nights before Castiel's will broke down. He missed having Dean curled up with him. He hadn't realized how well he had been sleeping with the pet in his bed until he wasn't there anymore.
Maybe the grass was closer to blue than green and rounder than it should be. And the trees looked more like giant broccoli. And those were definitely not ducks in the pond or squirrels in the trees. But it was the closest thing to Earth Dean had seen in ages.
Dean thought his master would either come stomping after him and carry him back to the bedroom or at least growl out a few
Pleasure raced through Castiel's body until he was shaking from the over stimulation. It was too much. It was burning through him and turning into something overwhelming. He clutched at Evan's arms and bore it. He wasn't here for his own pleasure.
Dean knew he must have looked particularly pathetic even after getting fed and cuddled because instead of his master simply leaving the room and telling him to
He found big green and scaly half inside the wall working on something. Dean hoped that something was whatever had been making that godawful screeching noise last night.
Only Brianne Shields ever came to him anymore to feed her babes. The priest had dragged her name through the mud almost as badly as he had Blackdog. If there was another butcher in the village her husband would have went out of business. As it was, the villagers had no choice. They either bought their meat from Liam Shields and his witch-associating wife or they didn't buy meat at all.
Castiel hadn't been thankful that Gabriel had moved in with Kali when he had returned a week ago until that very moment.
The priest looked down at Hannah scornfully. "Are you sure your grandmother didn't sell them to him and forget? She's quite old."
Dean glared at him and made huffy displeased sounds but he did stop squirming. Castiel didn't chastise him for it. He knew when to pick his battles when training Dean. And this wasn't the time. He still had to brush Dean's teeth. He hoped they wouldn't have another incident over the toothbrush today.
Castiel looked over his shoulder to see Sam standing at the mouth of the alley. Sam made a lewd gesture and leered at him. The men laughed again. Sam winked and strolled away with a skip in his step.
Castiel hurried forward, worried something had happened to the baby. Instead he found himself staring down the priest from across the greenway. He looked furious.
He narrowed it down to two. One with striking red hair and seemed eager to get closer to him and another with tiny spots speckling its skin that was curious though reserved.
"Do you admit to seducing an innocent mated beta?" The priest intoned. His breath came out in cold white puffs of early winter air.
He found a personal ad from a Hflip. They weren't particularly attractive by his own people's standards ‒ far too much fur to overlook and too many oddly shaped eyes ‒ but from what he read he was sure they could give each other what they wanted.
His master reached out with his second tail and pushed something on the nearby wall. Dean watched and wondered just how many buttons and signs were scattered throughout the ship that he couldn't even see.
"Cas," Dean whimpered. His hips started jerking forward. "Cas. Cas. I'm gonna...my dick is...I'm gonna..."
His grandmother huffed and rolled her eyes. "There isn't anyone in this room that doesn't know how to put pins in the cushion and what happens when you do." She crawled onto the bed and coaxed Rachel to spread her legs. "And besides all that, you wouldn't rub dirt into a wound."
He might have some social issues from doing long deep space runs alone but he wasn't that far gone that he didn't recognize what people would think if he admitted to what he had been doing. As understanding as his therapist was he doubted he'd be sympathetic to zoophilia.
Mary Winchester took a step back. "No." She clutched the purse close to her chest. "No, I want you take the bride price and I'll take my granddaughter home. She won't grow up in the middle of all this...nasty business. She won't have to know anything about it."
"She's old and tired." Gabriel interjected before Castiel's grandmother could say anything. "She didn't mean it. She'll say she'll curse anything if she can't have a lie down in the afternoon."
His master scooped him up from the table and set him down on his feet on the floor. Dean had a sneaking suspicion his master had only carried him to the bathroom because he knew he hated it and didn't want him trying to get away.
"You pig fucking priest!" Gabriel snarled. His hands settled gently onto Castiel's shoulders. "Come on, Cassie. It's over. We need to get you home."
He pressed his hand against the bread in his satchel. It wouldn't be enough. They hadn't had enough the past two months. Each time they had dipped into the money his father had left behind. They would have to do it again. There wouldn't be a next time.
"Why don't you leave?" Castiel asked him. He still didn't understand why Gabriel stayed. They were cousins through his father. Gabriel was still Gabriel Milton. He could leave behind the Blackdog family and never look back.
His master walked right past the turn for the pet park. Dean's shoulders slumped. He slowed down, lingering as long as he could before his master yanked on his leash.
Castiel eyed the human carefully. It had ducked down and froze at Castiel's quick movements and was looking up cautiously at him.
He flung himself down into a chair at the kitchen table and tried to cut leather for charms but his fingers wouldn't keep still long enough. His first heat hadn't been this bad but his grandmother had said conceiving Deidre had lessened it.
He woke to a strange sensation in the small puffy breasts he'd grown in nine months. He looked down to see his baby with their lips firmly attached to his nipple and sucking hard. He bent down to kiss the soft head. He laid his head back down. He was exhausted and sore. He felt like he'd been crushed by a horse and made to walk up the mountainside.
A quick flicker across the room made him turn his head. Dean's heart started pounding. His master had turned on an outside view.
Castiel gently pushed Dean's head back down with a claw. He said the command again. He could feel his pet squirm with confusion. He pressed his mating tail to Dean's lips and told him to
Brianne Shields dashed away with her babies. Castiel half expected the priest to stride forward and slap him across the brand on his cheek, to sneer
Castiel touched his lips. He looked at Dean. The silence stretched between them. Dean's face began turning his own shade of red.
A deep rumbling growl came through in the jumbled noise his master was listening to. Dean shuddered. The growl drudged up old memories of being snatched off Earth with a bunch of other terrified kids.
Every turn he took came to a dead end. All the corridors were closed off except the ones that led between the kitchen and the bathroom.
He shouldn't have gotten himself so worked up about it. His master might be spoiling him with treats but that didn't mean he was going to get everything he wanted.
"Two loaves of bread," Castiel said before thinking. He fought back a self-deprecating cringe. He could have said more. He could have said
He had thought they were just going to cuddle then go to sleep but his master never gave him toys and left him to entertain himself unless he really was busy.
His master walked through the door like he belonged there. Dean cringed as he followed beside him and stepped across the threshold. He had managed to swallow his fears about the ship doors chopping him in half but this was just some random alien's house. What if this guy didn't keep everything in as good condition as his master?
The door to the bakery opened. Mary Winchester came in with her son Adam clutching at her skirts and her son Sam at her side.
One of Qech's humans wandered in as he thought it over. He watched the human scurry over to Qech and make itself at home, pressed up against a pair of Qech's legs.
He was panting and sweating with pain when Daven Hills finally shoved forward and groaned. The baker slumped on top of him, crushing him to the cot. Castiel breathed hard as the pain started to lessen with Daven's softening cock.
Castiel squirmed on the spot. His skin crawled with desire. He wanted Dean to never stop touching him. He nodded; mouth still open and breathing heavy. He pulled his shirt off his head. He stopped. Dean was staring at him.
Castiel followed behind it and waited, letting it get acquainted with the door. When it had decided the door wasn't a danger it came back to his side and waited patiently.
Gabriel cleared his voice and spoke in a grumbling high pitched tone. "It's not charity, it's payment for putting up with you."
Cold anger burned in Castiel's stomach. He knew his grandmother would say yes. She'd never spite an innocent babe.
Castiel scoffed. Honourable? They were thieves to begin with and now they were liars. He should have never trusted Dean. He should have known better.
For a moment he debated on being outraged that Qech would presume that the liberal sexual practices of Helodem included zoophilic threesomes but instead decided the best course of action was to bolt from his chair.
Gabriel slowly dragged his eyes from the sack. He nodded at the lump on Castiel's chest and smiled. "Is she enjoying her first adventure?"
His master set the sanitizer unit down then reached for Dean. Dean braced himself for lift off. That was something else about having a master twice the size of him, he could pick him up.
And as far as Castiel knew Dean didn't even how to mate like a human, let alone mate like a person. He doubted Dean recognized what the warming sheath was. He was just being a curious human watching his master.
Guilt rushed through Castiel as he tugged Dean back down to the bed with his mating tail. Dean looked up at him. Castiel waited to see if his actions had upset his pet. Dean chattered at him again but didn't struggle to get away. Instead Dean wrapped an arm around Castiel's leg again and nuzzled into his side.
Dean's eyes flicked back and forth between Castiel and his mating tail. He chattered at Castiel again, this time sounding mildly upset. But his lips brushed against the tip of Castiel's mating tail making Castiel shiver as the scales on his back lifted higher with arousal.
"Yes," Castiel said. Dean glanced over at him but quickly decided that he wasn't being called over and went back to his chattering with the other pets. "More than that would be impractical on a ship."
"You're just a curious little pet, aren't you?" He scratched Dean's head. "You'd probably just wondered why you'd been banished to the floor if I ever brought mates to bed."
He pulled up the hood of his cloak and hurried. No one stopped him. No one talked to him. But he could still feel them staring.
His master huffed. The dagger tail slowly drooped down. He made a soft noise Dean had never heard from him before. He crouched down to Dean's level and carefully drew a claw along the blue sticky stuff that had smeared across Dean's sides and stomach. His master made the soft noise again then hissed and stood up.
He read over one profile of a Narsiaan trio a few times, debating on whether he was desperate enough to have sex that he'd agree to being hit with half a dozen love darts from each of them. He quickly decided that while he was desperate he wasn't so desperate that he'd risk a hospital visit for sex. Negotiating sex outside of species was always an interesting task to say the least.
"You alright?" Dean asked, nervously. He stayed frozen how he was, cock buried half way in Castiel's ass.
Dean reached for the bowl. His master pulled his hand away. Dean scowled at him. His master tapped his head with a claw. Dean rolled his eyes. He had learned that the tap to the head usually meant
Dean jumped in surprise when the puffball started making a whistling noise. His master hissed and clicked at it. Dean relaxed as he realized the purple puffball was the shopkeeper or the cashier or something like that.
Castiel did as told. A moment later the baker's weight was settling on top of him. His fists clenched in fear. Daven ground his cock along the cleft of Castiel's ass.
I realized, writing this, that there is no non-human-centric word for anthropomorphize. The best I could come up with was civilize and event hat sounds awkward.
Her arm spines flexed in delight. "Excellent." She tapped out a pattern on the panel of the human's cage. The panel faded to a murky green hiding the human from sight. "Do you have everything you'll need for a human?"
The priest shouted from beside Castiel. The priest bent down and whispered into Castiel's ear. "Scream pretty for me, whore."
The crowd shifted and murmured. A flicker of hope flared up in Castiel's chest, warming him against the cold. The crowd
Castiel snorted at the image Qech was making: a spiny Thwerq chattering like a soft little human while his pets tried to mimic Ipix. He had obviously seen Castiel watching his pets earlier and was making a joke.
Every passerby at market stared. Castiel pulled the hood of his cloak closer to his face. The coarse fabric brushed against the brand making his cheek burn.
Michael Goodson led the way to his home, slowing for Castiel's grandmother. Michael kept looking over his shoulder at them, trying to will Castiel's grandmother to move faster.
But there were no angry growly noises from his master. Instead his master looked down at his blue-stained arms, clacked his claws together, then reached into the box with his other tail and picked up a ball. He offered it to Dean.
His master carried him to the bedroom after and set him down on the bed. Dean gave him a pointed look, took his blanket, and went to the kitchen to sleep on his couch.
His grandmother reached for the chain. She took it and looked it over. She passed it to Gabriel. Gabriel held it up and narrowed his eyes at it. He scratched at it with a finger nail. He turned away and did something at the counter. He hummed to himself. He nodded and turned back around.
Gabriel put his hands up, trying to calm Castiel. "I don't think he's gotten another bug up his ass about you." He pulled a cloak out of his satchel and held it out for Castiel. "But I think it would be better if there weren't any Blackdogs in the village today."
He was two feet from the corridor that led to his master's bedroom when the bulkhead door slammed shut in his face.
"I think that was still kissing." Castiel said. He wasn't entirely sure but he was mostly certain. Gabriel had told him people have sex with their mouths but he hadn't said how.
He stopped paying attention to where they were going ‒ it wasn't the pet park so what did it matter? ‒ so was surprised when he realized that the bustle of the main halls of the station had given away to the quiet residential areas.
"It's not any different from you two fixing things in the village," his grandmother said. She tapped Deidre's nose and made a face at her. "Is it, DeeDee?" She turned back to the rest of them. "Hurry up. The day waits for no one."
"Yeah. Really funny." Dean muttered, fake smile on his face. "Love it when dumb giant lizard monsters just grab me and haul me off without warning."
"What's gotten into you?" Dean asked, leaning into his master as he fastened the collar around his neck. "Not that I'm complaining."
He didn't get out more human food, Dean's food was rationed during trips just as his own, but he picked the bowl up and squeezed out a dollop of flavouring paste into it. He handed the bowl to Dean. Dean snatched at the bowl and dropped it. Castiel jerked down and caught it but at the cost of getting flavouring paste all over his claws and fingers. He grimaced but he knew the paste was harmless.
Dean recoiled, sure he was about to lose a limb. His eyes flicked between the ship and the hall to the station. He wasn't sure if it would be better to make a run for the ship or if he should try to run away and hide on the station. He didn't know why his master was suddenly furious with him. And not knowing why a master was angry was always bad news for a pet.
It wasn't until he was spitting a shirt out of his mouth as his master tried to pull it over his head that he realized he was finally getting some clothes. He managed to wrestle himself away long enough to put his arms through the sleeves on his own. His master seemed content to let him put the pants on by himself after that.
Castiel nodded wordlessly. He started pulling his clothes on. Evan took a bite of his lunch, watching Castiel dress as he ate. It made Castiel's skin crawl. Evan Fawkes had just fucked him until he was moaning and now he was watching him indifferently while he stuffed his mouth.
with his pet. He let Dean lick his mating tail and enjoyed the warm buzz of arousal but that was it. He always stopped before his mating tail unfurled. It
Two days later Castiel decided to move the pet bed back to the kitchen. He had just been over-reacting to an innocent mishap. He had a spoiled little pet that liked to cuddle and nothing more.
Dean's eyes went wide. The kid clambered over the dragon's spikey legs babbling that same bad Ipix the humans at the park had used. "Safe, safe, safe. Qech. Enjoyment. Safe family."
Qech chuffed in amusement. "It's a sign of affection. Bonding behaviour. They like each other." He paused to take out bowls and food for his humans. "It's a lesser form of how he wrapped his arm around your leg."
His master dropped him down onto a table in the middle of the room. Dean flopped backwards, closed his eyes, and let his mind wander. He knew there wasn't any fighting this. He had tried to wash up by himself the first few times but his master had eventually tied him down and done it anyway. If he didn't want to be tied down he had to go along with it.
Dean jumped when a shudder ran through the ship. He pressed himself against his master's leg and trembled. He
Castiel took the rag and wiped the come and slick from his thighs. There wasn't any blood. There hadn't been since his grandmother had told him how to do it right.
Castiel brushed a finger along his baby's nose. He looked up and gave Mary Winchester a predatory smile. "I'm sorry, Mary. I'm a whore and a liar. I slept with dozens of men before I ever slept with a Winchester. I really couldn't say who Deidre Dean's father is."
The puffball stopped halfway down the hall. Dean flinched as a door opened in the wall. The puffball unclipped his leash and nudged him through the door.
"No. Nothing actually," Castiel said. "And I'm leaving the planet shortly. That won't be a problem?"
Castiel had read that isolation was an effective punishment for humans but he hadn't thought it would be
His pet seemed to forgive him for the horror of only getting two treats after it had a nap and another meal.
Gabriel grabbed a crate and swept the protection charms into it. "It's time to go." He carried the crate to the cart.
Castiel braced himself. His grandmother reached out with the cloth and gently pressed it down. Castiel's eyes rolled into the back of his head.
It was the feeling of an imminent orgasm that woke him up. He snapped his eyes open. The dream of perfect mates didn't fade. He sat up to find his mating tail wrapped around Dean and the human nuzzling his face against it, nosing at the sensitive opening that had unfurled in his sleep.
Mary Winchester walked closer to him. She dangled the purse with his bride price in it before him. "I'll give you this. You just have to let me take Deidre Dean home to her family. You won't have to ever worry about her again. We'll make sure she doesn't starve. She'll grow up strong and happy and loved."
Dean didn't know if his master came from a weird species or if his master was just a weird guy all on his own.
"What did it say?" Castiel pulled the baby's basket closer to himself. What if his mother didn't want something but rather, wanted to get rid of something? What if she'd come home but only if they left Deidre out in the woods for the fairies?
"I have to go back to the village after breakfast," Castiel said, trying his best to sound casual. He held up a spoonful of carrot for Deidre. She managed to get more of it on her face than in her mouth. "I'll meet you in the woods in the afternoon."
Castiel looked over his shoulder again. People were still watching. He doubted they'd help him. He clutched the loaf of bread in his hands. He had it. He could run back to his family in the market. It wasn't as though Sam Winchester could come after him and call him a thief.
"I hope so," Castiel said. He hooked the rope handle of the bucket onto the shoulder yolk. "They deserve to be happy."
It was the first time Dean was actually glad his master insisted on bathing him. The blue sticky stuff wouldn't come off. His master resorted to using something Dean had seen him use to clean ship parts and even then the blue staining stayed.
The priest turned to Castiel. "Confess your sin! You seduced an innocent mated beta! You bewitched him! You slander his family name!"
His master snorted ‒ Dean thought it was probably something like a laugh ‒ then started to take out Dean's bowl and the food. He kept his second tail where it was, still rubbing under Dean's chin.
The purple puffball whistled at him and tugged at his leash. Dean stepped forward. The puffball whistled again and started leading him down a hall behind the desk. Dean followed it, wondering if it had hands hidden somewhere under all that fuzzy purple stuff.
His grandmother waved her walking stick dismissively. "Another week or two and someone will be caught stealing or sleeping with their neighbour's wife and the priest will have a new sermon. They'll forget about us again."
He tossed and turned for an hour before grumbling in frustration and giving up. He got up, washed, dressed, and went back to pacing the kitchen.
Dean followed him to the kitchen, bouncing along excitedly by his side. His excitement was infectious.
"Nothing." Castiel tugged at his shirt. He looked over his shoulder to see the priest marching away, the stick up his ass keeping him ramrod straight. Castiel hoped it was nothing. He hoped he hadn't just invited another mob to their home.
Sam gave a short whistle. Adam Winchester slithered out from the shadows. Sam bent down and whispered in his ear. Adam ran down the alley. A moment later Mary Winchester stepped around the corner.
Dean looked at his clothes covered forearms. What was wrong about the blue stuff that his master didn't want anyone to see?
Dean didn't see him for the rest of the day ‒ there was still miles of ship he hadn't mapped out yet ‒ but his master was back twelve hours later. Right on time for dinner.
When Dean woke up and started begging to be fed there was no indication that he remembered in the slightest what had happened. Castiel made sure to keep his mating tail wrapped around himself just in case but after a few days it was apparent Dean didn't care about his mating tail.
Castiel felt his face flush red in embarrassment. He had been so naïve that first heat, he had thought his slick was Dean's come. And he was still a naïve idiot that didn't know how to whore himself right.
Dean lurched forward and kissed him again. He bit at Castiel's lip and licked at the corners of his mouth. Castiel gasped. He opened his mouth wider. Dean hesitated before licking his way into Castiel's mouth.
"I'm a witch and I curse this whole village!" Castiel shouted. He swept a glare over the crowd until his eyes landed on John Winchester. "And I curse
Dean pushed at his mating tail again and chattered. He looked pointedly at the bowl in Castiel's hand. He pushed Castiel's mating tail towards the bowl.
Evan trailed his fingers down to Castiel's chest and stomach. One hand curled around Castiel's hip while the other slid between Castiel's thighs.
Dean gave him an incredulous look. "There isn't much else to do when you're in trouble as much as I am."
The bed dipped down. Dean shuffled over so he didn't get kicked by huge clawed feet. He debated on not curling around his master just to show him how much he hated bath time but he was sure lashing out now would just get him punished.
"You aren't the first Blackdog to get that brand and I doubt you'll be the last." His grandmother told him. "My great aunt had one and so did three of my cousins." She pat his arm again. She looked to Gabriel. "I'm going to take a nap. Wake me when it's time." She shuffled out of the bedroom.
Castiel relaxed into the mattress. Dean wasn't upset about it. If anything, Dean seemed happy to have his mating tail wrapped around him, holding him tight.
He knew it was a terrible idea. Going out during his heat was why he had a brand on his face. And his heat was the only time he could get pregnant. They couldn't afford another mouth to feed because he was being rash.
He stripped down and got into bed. He pushed Dean aside so he could stretch out. Dean grumbled about being moved then wrapped himself around one of Castiel's legs.
More leaked out of him. He grabbed more grass. His heart started to beat in panic when it didn't stop. He stuck his hand between his legs then brought his fingers up to his face, fearing blood. Maybe what they had done wasn't how sex worked. Maybe he had hurt himself.
One handed Castiel helped Gabriel heave the sack into the cart. Gabriel frowned at the sack. He bit his lip. He breathed deep. His face went carefully blank.
He flinched when the first huge wipe glided down his legs. The cold cloth made goosebumps rise up on his legs. He cracked an eye open. "What do you do? Keep them in the freezer?"
Dean leaned into it because that's what pets were expected to do. "Yeah. Thanks. Great. Just don't claw me with those things."
"Shit." Castiel grabbed a handful of grass and wiped himself clean. He knew, of course, that if Dean had come
had fondled his mating tail. He knew it was innocent. Dean didn't know any better. He was just a pet looking for the warmth of his master. But a
Castiel could hear the baker in the back. He called out. The baker yelled at him that he was still closed. Castiel gulped down his fears and went to the back.
"John Winchester is a thief and a liar!" Castiel growled. He placed his hands protectively over his belly as gooseflesh broke out over his skin. "Dean Winchester got me with child and ran off! And now his family is lying and refusing to pay reparations!"
"I did it while she was sleeping." His grandmother said. She turned, a sly grin on her face. "I did it for all of you. She was hopping mad after each one."
Dean picked a ball from the box and absently rolled it from hand to hand while he watched his master. It was weird. His master definitely wasn't busy. He was getting ready for bed. Dean frowned down at the ball. Had he misbehaved so badly that his master thought he couldn't be left alone and unoccupied for more than a couple of seconds?
He flopped backwards onto his bed and stared at the ceiling. That now familiar ache pulsed in his gut. He glanced at the wooden cock on his bedside table. He pressed his face into the pillows and groaned.
A shiver crept through Castiel. He pulled his hood up and looked up and down the street. It was too early for most. Only a few people in the village were awake and those that were, were busy getting ready for the day.
Castiel stood in the road and watched the cart move ahead of him. Gabriel was right in saying that it was pride that had made them demand that the Winchesters pay a bride price or reparations if they couldn't produce Dean. It was their pride that had made them refuse to stop and let the village think he was loose and immoral.
Castiel refrained from laughing bitterly. The pleasant exhaustion faded from his skin. He would have been saved a lot of trouble if omegas couldn't come with their cocks.
He sat up and looked into the box. There was a mix of blueish-green balls about the size of a softball. He glanced up at his master. His master was busy putting away his work clothes. Dean looked back to the box. He flicked his eyes to the bed.
His family came back in the early evening to find him sprawled on the cool stone in front of the fireplace. A wet patch of slick had spread across his pants but he couldn't bring himself to care anymore. Slick leaked out of him faster than he could clean it up. Being an omega in heat was disgusting. No wonder the village shunned him.
He spent the next three days rushing through the paperwork, securing the cargo for a different gravity rating, and scouring the station's personal ads.
He pulled his pants on and glanced up. Daven was staring at him. Castiel did the buttons of his fly up and reached for his shirt. "I won't be long."
Qech's sides inflated as he let out an amused chuff. "I know what you're thinking; this Thwerq has decided to stab himself with his own spines. But they really do understand more than basic commands." He pointed one long claw at the gently swaying horizontal yellow lines on the door to the hall. "They understand Oueyi at the level of a yearling. Not to mention the handful of Ipix words they can manage if you have the patience to teach them."
"We've had some problems with teeth cleaning." Castiel gave Dean a second dental treat. "The cost is worth it. And besides, they're more thorough than I could ever be."
in Ipix. Qech chuffed happily and gave out the bowls. The humans politely took them chorused something that sounded a little like
He understood now why people bragged about their pets even if he was loathed to admit it. Although he hadn't sunk so far as to be taking pictures of Dean and sharing them with strangers.
lived with us all year and locked doors don't keep Kali out." He didn't need more explanation than that.
It took Dean most of the day to figure out where he was. He hadn't been sold to a new master. His master had put him up in a kennel while they were docked at the station.
He pushed open the third door on the left. Evan Fawkes's room was small and spartan. There was a dresser and a bed and room for nothing more.
It was one thing to have someone manhandle him through a bath but something about his master brushing his teeth for him really dug under his skin. He'd never had a master who had thought he was this useless before.
Castiel looked over his shoulder to where the priest had been. He didn't want to ruin Gabriel's good mood by talking about the priest but it would surely ruin Gabriel's mood if the priest led another mob to their home.
Qech looked up to find Castiel staring. He rumbled out several deeps chuffs at him. "I thought Helodem weren't squeamish about sex?" He cast a significant look down at the blue stains on Castiel's arms and then towards the kitchen where Dean had last been. "Any sex it would seem."
He clicked his claws together as thoughts whirled through his head. It was the prickle through the scales of his back that won in the end.
His master carried him to the bedroom. Dean was gently placed at the bottom of the bed. His master sat down beside him and stretched his tails. Dean carefully watched where the dagger tail went.
He said another goodbye ‒ careful this time to keep his hair out of reach from his daughter ‒ then set out for the village.
He didn't try to tug the sleeves down further. It would only draw more attention to his sexual blunder— he had rushed the Hflip through explaining the finer details of their version of sex and missed the part where the mating fluids stained their partner's skin for upwards of a year. And to make matters worse, the sex had only been average at best.
Castiel let out a soft moan. A hint of a smile flicked across Evan's face. Evan pressed harder. Castiel gasped.
"I could come again on market day," Castiel said, setting the empty glass onto a side table. He didn't particularly enjoy the taste of come but he'd rather visit Cepheus twice as much then have to take Evan's coin.
His grandmother led him to a room at the end of the hall. He could hear heavy breathing and whispered prayers from beyond the door. His grandmother didn't knock. She simply pushed the door open and walked in.
The dragon's head snaked down to stare at him. Its tongue flicked out. His master hissed again. The dragon's head angled up. It hissed back. The dragon recoiled its head and made a noise like rolling thunder.
"We got everything, grandma." Hannah informed her. She moved her cloak aside to show her satchel bulging full.
"How much for that one?" Castiel pointed to a loaf that would reasonably feed his family for more than a day.
Dean took the bowl more carefully this time but still licked it clean with gusto. Then without warning he bent forward and licked the paste from Castiel's fingers.
"That's it." His grandmother said. "All you do now is spend the rest of your life worrying over which god heard the plea." She watched the smoke go up. "Not every god is something you'd want favour from."
The only good thing to come from the blue sticky stuff was that his master completely forgot to brush his teeth.
It always unsettled him to walk into the village alone now. The people he'd meet on the road would always stare at the brand on his cheek. It wasn't much better in the village but there was usually something to distract people or he could always turn down another street. On the road there was nothing more interesting than him.
His master hissed something that Dean didn't think was sympathetic then picked up the toothbrush again and finished brushing Dean's teeth.
Castiel marched along beside it; growing more and more certain with each passing step that blood had leaked through the cloth padding his crotch and into his pants. He was thankful for the cloak. His grandmother said he'd bleed for a few more days but that it would stop soon. Castiel wondered how many pairs of pants he'd ruin until then.
A soft little gasp escaped his lips. What if they were waiting for the baker to find him? What if they were going to keep trying to ruin him and accuse him of stealing the loaf of bread?
"Give me your hand." His grandmother reached for his wrist. Castiel let her take it. She pulled out a long silver pin from her pocket. She pricked his finger and squeezed blood from the tip into the brass bowl.
They sighed. Castiel felt himself drop off; wrapped around Dean with Dean buried inside him. He would have been content to stay that way forever.
"They don't scold their children for it where you can't hear them." Anna growled. Despite being younger she had grown protective of him. "And you know they won't do it as soon as you stop making milk or their babies get older."
He turned to find Cepheus Redwood sitting in a chair in the corner of the room. He had a ledger open in his lap. He didn't look up.
"Put it in water and drink it the morning after the new moon. Your breasts will start to fill up as the moon does." Castiel had taken it himself for months now. It was how he could feed his daughter along with so many others.
Castiel squinted at the description. He had read up quickly on the more mainstream sex acts Hflips practiced. Most of it was simple enough; pressing genital patches against each other and secreting different mating fluids to prompt self-fertilization or impregnation. What Uth was asking for didn't seem too outlandish based on that, though Castiel didn't know why they were so focused on his arms. Hflips didn't have anything remotely similar to an arm so Castiel doubted Uth actually found his arms attractive.
He laid in a sweaty heap, come and slick drying on his hands, and tried to nap. If he slept through his heat maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
His master's second tail draped over his shoulder and rubbed under his chin. Dean leaned into the touch. His master made a bunch of pleased hissing.
Castiel glared at him. He tossed the coins down for the smaller loaf of bread and snatched it off the counter. The baker laughed. Castiel turned away. He tugged the hood closer to his face and yanked at the satchel he wore to slide the bread inside.
Gabriel's face turned stony. He let go of Castiel's arm. "Stay here with grandma. Pack up what you can." He stalked away, quickly disappearing into the market crowd.
Castiel glanced over at the woods. He had gone with his grandmother to collect food from the forest before but never because they needed to. It had always been for variety. Or to agitate his mother when she and his grandmother were fighting.
Castiel tugged the sides of his cloak together and breathed deep. He was a Blackdog. He was a witch. He'd be a midwife too, just like all his family before him.
He wrote himself a note to absolutely not pass on finding partners at his next stop even if he thought he didn't need to by then.
"What're you doing?" Castiel asked. His mother had never allowed any of her children to do spell work unless it was making charms for the market.
Castiel could feel the heat before the brand touched his cheek. That breath of a moment before it hit his skin was the longest he'd ever lived. Then the brand pressed against him and pain seared through him. He screamed. His stomach clenched in pain again. Water rushed down his legs. The two men holding him down jumped back. The priest stumbled backwards; yanking the brand with him.
Castiel stared back, confused by his pet's behaviour. Dean flailed his arms and chattered for a few moments before returning to the bed. He stopped in front of Castiel's knees. Castiel tensed as Dean reached out and touched his mating tail. He kept perfectly still, he didn't want to spook Dean from paying attention to him.
Castiel was pinned to the bed, lying in sweat and slick. He didn't care in the least. His thighs were trembling and his heart was still racing. The aftershocks of his orgasm still had him twitching. He could feel his hole clenching around Evan's cock.
"Even though Michael Goodson is an ass." Anna said. She turned to Castiel and looked him fiercely in the eye. "He was mean about Deidre Dean. We went somewhere else." She looked back to their grandmother. "We only had to go to four different people to get everything. And I think a lot of it's better."
In the morning he went on the hunt for his master. When he found him his master made him run through a bunch of commands before carrying him to the kitchen for breakfast.
Castiel huffed out a laugh. He wasn't going to miss having mashed carrot in his hair. He wiped the worst of it off himself and fed Deidre what was left of her breakfast.
Castiel stiffened and froze. He turned to see Michael Goodson and three other men from the village watching him and laughing. They had seen him walk into the alley with Sam Winchester. Castiel pulled at his hood and turned his branded cheek away from them.
Dean repeated the ritual twice more before Castiel realized Dean wanted to be fed again. Castiel sighed at his semi-successful attempt at training Dean then got up to catch Dean and bring him back to bed.
Castiel groaned and clenched his jaw as his grandmother tended to his face and his stomach reminded him of his troubles.
Between securing cargo he managed to send a few messages back and forth to a number of potential partners.
He stroked his pet's back first to ease the tension in him. He acted like this was just like any other time when Dean sat in his lap. When Dean was relaxed against him he brought his mating tail back to his pet's mouth just as he would when he fed him.
instead of keeping him shut up on the ship. It made his chest fill with affection every time he thought about it. He hadn't thought his master would ever do something like that for him. His master had only started remembering to feed him on time in the last few weeks. Now his master was letting him run around in a park with other humans.
His grandmother passed Deidre to Hannah then crouched down beside him. She laid a hand on his head. "Not too hot," she commented. She stood up, her knees cracking.
He dug into his breakfast. Which was the same mush as his dinner and snacks but breakfast was flavoured with something sweet. Out of all the weird stuff his masters had fed him over the years it was as close to a favourite as he had come.
Dean backed up. Fear started pricking at the back of his head. He didn't know a lot about ships but he knew if a bulkhead door wouldn't open it was always a bad thing.
to mark the doors because his master would stop in front of them and read what he thought must be manifests or inventories.
Castiel pressed his head back into the sheets. Pleasure burned through him from his hole and cock. His whole body was tensing up. He was going to come. No one but himself and Dean had made him come before.
Dean's heart sank when his master didn't bring him to the kitchen but instead the bathroom. On the ever increasing list of things he hated about his master's ship the bathroom was up there with invisible doors that could chop him in half without warning.
to his ever increasing list of things to do when he made his next stop. Hopefully there would be other humans there that Dean could play with and get the excessive behaviour out of his system.
He reached home before his family had sat down for breakfast. He put the loaves of bread away then went with Hannah to help her draw water from the stream for the day.
Castiel went back to the cart. Brianne Shields sighed in relief. She held out the smaller of the two children to Castiel. Castiel worked his shirt back open and took the baby. When the baby had found a good rhythm Castiel reached into the cart with his free hand. He pulled out a small packet and offered it to Brianne.
He'd have to get Dean another pet bed and start making him sleep on the floor in the bedroom. He'd move Dean's bed from the kitchen into the bedroom in the meantime. At the next stop he'd purchase a second bed for Dean. And maybe inquire about some of the sterilization techniques that reduced the mating drive. He
His grandmother squinted at the note. She gasped softly. She hobbled over to the hearth and tossed it in.
His grandmother pulled him into a hug while he sobbed. She rubbed his back until he calmed down. When he stopped sniffling against her shoulder she eased him back into his seat.
"I know, I know. It sounds ridiculous but they really can manage some limited speech. It's not enough for a conversation but they can communicate their base needs," Qech said. He opened the door to his lounge and motioned for Castiel to go through the door first, Qech followed in behind him. "They're much smarter than what we give them credit for."
Dean's hand shoved between them. He grabbed Castiel's cock and stroked it like it was his own. "Cas. Cas. I'm gonna... It's gonna be in...
Evan came to the side of the bed and stopped. His eyes travelled over Castiel, lingering here and there. Castiel tried not to squirm under his gaze but he hadn't had anyone really
Dean leaned forward. He felt his master tense underneath him before saying the command again. Dean carefully licked half the mush from his master's tail. He felt his master tense up even more.
They moved through the bustle of the station until his master brought him into a store. It was a weird store. There was only one large room with a few pieces of furniture that Dean thought were probably chairs for things with a lot more or a lot fewer limbs than he had. In the corner there was one big desk with a giant purple puffball behind it.
Castiel brushed his thumb along Dean's cheek. His heart fluttered. He didn't want today to end. It wasn't anything special - he and Dean had spent most of it lazing around on the mountainside - but it was perfect. The rush of the breeze over the spring grass, the sun warming his skin, the blue sky dotted with clouds, and the smell of spring and Dean filling his nose.
He took off at a run in the opposite direction. If he wasn't currently dying then that meant something bad was going on, on the other side of the door and he didn't want any part in that.
When Anna and Hannah had finished their breakfasts his grandmother passed them Deidre. They glanced between each other but didn't ask why. Castiel could feel their eyes sliding towards him anyway. They knew well enough.
"Dental treats? Those can get expensive," Qech said. He rattled the spines of his tail to call his pets over.
Castiel looked it over. It was smaller than the other one. It could probably hide more easily in the ship. Or the cargo. He glanced down the row of cages. "Are there any you think would be more inclined to it?"
Castiel didn't remember screaming like that. He glanced up at Michael Goodson, worried for Michael's wife and child despite his own anger.
His grandmother chuckled at the look on his face. "It'll pass soon. Another day or two." She eyed the wet patch on his pants. "You should drink some water."
The kid tumbled to the floor in front of Dean. She smiled up at him then tugged at his pant leg. "Yellow enjoyment." She laughed hysterically and tugged at his pant leg again. "Door."
He hated having a heat. He hated what he was. He wished he was a beta like everyone else in the village.
Cepheus tucked his cock back into his pants. He waited for Castiel to stand before offering a glass of water along with his payment.
"We can," Castiel said simply. He rolled to his side and reached for his clothes on the floor. He slid off the bed and took out the rag he had brought to clean himself up with. He wiped at the come and slick between his legs before moving on to the come on his stomach.
Daven Hills slowly picked up the pace of his thrusts. Castiel tried to mask his whines of pain for moans of pleasure. It didn't stop hurting.
After Dean's bath he placed the pet at the foot of the bed. Dean rolled and flopped his way into the centre of the bed as he wiggled under his blanket. Castiel chuckled at his sleepy pet then stripped his work clothes off. He went to his dresser and took out the warming sheath. He had gotten used to the slow gentle orgasms that it drew out of him. It was still a poor substitute for mates but it made for a pleasant sleep aid.
At the end of the day he scooped Dean up and carried him to the kitchen for dinner. He watched in amusement as his pet yawned his way through dinner. And was more than thankful that Dean had tired himself out enough to barely complain about bath time.
They chatted about Gabriel as they walked home, painting an extravagant life for him full of adventures that he surely wouldn't appreciate.
at his master he was getting fed or an extra treat between meals. It was a complete turnaround from how his master had been these past weeks.
A timer went off, interrupting his work. It was time to feed Dean. Castiel looked over at Dean sitting off to the side. He'd finished the puzzle toy and tossed it aside and was now staring dejectedly at Castiel.
"Only the finest things." Castiel licked his thumb then wiped at a smudge of dirt on Dean's face. "What were you rolling in?"
Daven groaned and gently rocked his hips up. He settled a large heavy hand into Castiel's hair. "Knew you were a whore." He murmured.
loaves of bread. He could have said anything he wanted. Gods, how had he thought he was anything but stupid and naïve?
"Yes. Very good," Castiel cooed. He gave Dean a few scritches just under his ear. "You're quite a smart little pet, aren't you?"
But did his host really believe that? Humans as visual speakers? The most he had seen Dean change colour was when his lips had paled after sneaking into one of the refrigerated cargo bays. Every piece of literature he had found explaining the colour change had said that it was an entirely involuntary response to cold and not an intentional threat display.
And besides, his master wanted it this way. A good pet did what their master wanted or risked being abandoned, spaced, locked away and forgotten, or
He thought that was probably safe. He didn't feed Dean his dental treats with his mating tale since it was something that had to be chewed— he didn't want to encourage biting anywhere near his mating tale.
Castiel went to the basket and picked it up. He caught up to his grandmother on the path. He followed her inside. She pointed to the table. He sat down, the empty feeling didn't go away.
They looked up to find the village priest. Castiel pulled at the hood and shrunk back. He could feel the priest's words curl into his ear,
Castiel sighed. He knew it was overdoing it. Dean had gotten his reward. But when Dean started chattering away and nuzzling his leg like that it was hard to say no.
He left the bakery telling himself that meeting Evan Fawkes in the Silver Head could only be a good thing.
"It's not supposed to." Castiel panted. He doubled over his stomach again. He groaned until the contraction passed. He gasped when it was over. "How long? How long before it comes?"
Castiel felt his face go pale with shock when his grandmother stuffed her fingers into Rachel Goodson's cunt. She took them out and motioned for Castiel to come closer and do the same.
Deidre's hand shot out and grabbed a fistful of his hair. She yanked hard. Castiel yelped and grabbed for her hand. He tugged his hair from her grip. A few strands of hair stayed behind in her chubby fingers. His grandmother laughed and told him he'd miss that too.
He climbed up his master's huge chair and snuggled in next to him. His master wrapped an arm around him and pulled him in closer.
His master started making grumbly noises at the dragon. They hissed and grumbled at each other. Dean got the drift that his master wasn't too impressed by whatever the dragon had to say.
Castiel laughed softly. Dean was always the one who got caught for their adventures. He was forever confined to his room for the things they got up to.
Castiel clacked his claws together in agreement. He had assumed the way Dean frequently wrapped around him was bonding behaviour but he was glad all the same to have someone confirm it.
Dean started chattering in confusion. He pulled the blanket close to himself. He looked like he wanted to reach out to Castiel but was afraid.
"No," Castiel said. A familiar chill settled in his stomach. It hadn't hurt until after. Not until Dean had run away instead of staying and the village had called him a whore for it.
Dean filled the silence, rambling about anything that came to mind, as huge knuckles rubbed along his spine.
Castiel stood in front of the bakery and tried to imagine bringing home food rather than what the baker's hands would feel like. Daven Hills wasn't a field labourer but he didn't shy away from hard work. Castiel had seen him heft bags of flour as big as Anna and watched him pull loaves of bread from hot ovens with his hands when his baker's peel wasn't immediately at hand.
He honestly didn't know why he was so against getting a pet in the first place. The human was easy to take care of, companionable, and quick to obey. Dean didn't have the same sleep rhythm or eating patterns as him but there was a certain charm in having his pet curl up beside him and nap or get excited about its meals.
Castiel stared down at his half asleep pet. He flexed the claws of his hand that Dean had licked. The sense memory of his pet's tiny tongue made his scales rise up again. He shook himself. Dean was a
Dean sighed. What was the point in agonizing about it? His master wasn't going to let him do it. If he didn't want the metal contraption shoved into his mouth again to pry his jaws open he'd let his master brush his teeth.
She pat his thigh and hobbled away from the alter. "Get little DeeDee there and bring her inside. We've got more to do before you mother comes home."
Anna came dashing around the corner of the cart laughing. Hester gasped in fear. She grabbed her son from Castiel's chest and shoved the packet of sewing needles at Castiel. She pulled her cloak around herself and disappeared into the market before anyone could see her.
Castiel's eyes flicked over to the hallway. He could look into each room and see if Evan was already in one. He could pretend he wasn't there to be a whore.
Daven tugged at his hair until Castiel lifted his head from his cock. He slid down the cot to make room. He waved at Castiel. "On the cot on your stomach."
Dean shuffled over and draped an arm over his master's leg. He wasn't exactly tired. He hadn't done anything all day. But he knew his master liked the physical contact. He'd doze for a while then get up and try to figure out more of the ship. He'd make sure he was back in the bedroom before his master woke up.
"It's not the same," Castiel muttered before biting into the toast. If it was the same he wouldn't have a brand on his cheek.
Her spines smoothed out. She stepped closer and touched the panel that separated the humans from the rest of the store. "Never had one before?"
The second tail touching was new. Sometimes his master had used his dagger tail to heft him up or pull him closer but ever since that day Dean had been jerked awake by his master yanking his second tail away from him the second tail had been kept carefully away.
Evan Fawkes stared at him, eyes flicking back and forth, before he nodded. He closed the door behind him and set his lunch on top of the dresser. He crossed the room in two strides and stopped in front of Castiel.
Castiel bent his head up and pressed a kiss to Dean's lips. He laid his head back down in the grass. Dean turned and stared at him at him in wide-eyed shock.
Dean grumbled as he untangled his leg from him and got up. Castiel rummaged through his dresser and found the sheath. He worked it on over his mating tail then got back into bed.
He slowly took the brush from Dean's mouth. Dean started chattering at him. Castiel ignored him in favour of tossing the toothbrush aside and turning away. He rolled his shoulders and forced his scales back down. The rush of arousal slowly faded.
"Please let it be a station," Dean begged. A station wasn't as good as a planet with real ground and a real sky and real atmosphere but it was a hell of a lot better than a ship.
He watched the first stars dot the sky before sitting up. Walking home in the twilight would be difficult, walking home in the dark would leave his feet bloody. His family wasn't anymore wealthy than Dean's; witches made little more than thieves.
Dean's cock slid over his asshole. Castiel threw his head back and moaned. He had never felt anything like that before. Dean grinned and did it again. Castiel's back arched. Something twinged deep inside him. He moaned again. He rocked his hips as Dean's cock slid over his asshole and nudged at his balls.
"That's the most decent way I think I've ever heard it put about what my cousin gets up to in public," Castiel laughed. The village elders complained to no end that the youngest generation was morally corrupt, and frequently Gabriel in particular. But Castiel's grandmother had taken him aside and told him every sordid detail about the village elders' youths. All young people, his grandmother informed him, were a moral disappointment to their elders. Gabriel was no different.
Castiel clutched at his belly protectively. He looked between the priest and the crowd. He kept his eyes away from the brazier and the brand. The heat of it warmed his bare side.
"I'm always willing to trade." The baker said. His eyes raked up and down Castiel. He leered. "I heard sirens get wet like women."
"My father says they're monsters." Castiel reached up and traced the outline of a cloud overhead. The grass shivered with the breeze. Spring had come early but it was still cool. According to his grandmother early springs were good for the lamb season. He wasn't sure if she knew that, because she was old or because she had seen something.
Dean quickly burrowed into his blanket and sighed happily, apparently having already forgotten how much he didn't like baths.
Rachel Goodson looked up, confused and tired. She glanced out the window then back to Castiel's grandmother. "All morning."
His grandmother cursed at herself again. She stood up and moved to the chair next to him. She sat down, groaning softly under her breath about her knees. She ran her fingers through his hair and pushed it from his eyes.
He watched her find a basin and wash herself from fingers to elbows. She motioned for Castiel to do the same. He picked up the soap without question and worked it into a lather. He didn't remember his grandmother doing this when he'd given birth.
"In a heat, no less!" The priest finished. He turned to Castiel. A hint of a smirk played at the corner of his lips. "And now he bears the fruit of his sin."
Castiel braced himself as Evan reached under him and pressed his fingers along Castiel's hole. Castiel could feel his slick leak out. Evan didn't shove his fingers in.
Castiel picked up the tooth brush with his mating tail. It was too delicate for his claws to grasp. He let Dean see the brush well before he brought it to Dean's mouth.
"I hope were gonna eat this time," Dean grumbled. His master snorted and pet him. Dean leaned against his leg. "Yeah. See? I'm really happy about being wiped down like a baby. Now let's eat."
He was carried into his master's bedroom afterwards and deposited onto the bed. He stretched out while he could and wrapped himself up in his blanket. He sighed into the blanket, it smelled like home. Dean's eyes flicked open. He frowned at the ceiling. He didn't want his current master's bedroom to smell like home. He wanted home to be on a planet with a master who had other humans and didn't forget to feed him.
"She traded needles." Castiel held the needles up. They didn't need them at the moment but they would eventually, or they could sell them to someone else.
"If you see him, tell him I'll be waiting in his room," Castiel said. The words felt like weights in his gut but each one came with a thrill of excitement. He could trade for coins instead of bread. He could put them aside for another day. They could live beyond one week.
He heard the door closing and disappearing behind him but couldn't tear his eyes away from the park.
"For filth," Castiel chuckled. He picked grass, dirt, and a spider from Dean's hair. "And horrible hairy creatures."
Castiel closed his eyes and tried not to fall into the jaws fear and worry. Out of all of them Gabriel was the least likely to pick a fight with the priest and bring a mob down on them. He was very probably just going to find out how much the priest saw. Or thought he saw.
It didn't hurt anymore either. Now it was simply a few uncomfortable minutes where he rocked his hips back because Daven Hills liked when he did that. It guaranteed him two loaves of bread instead of one.
Castiel had the tube halfway back to the cupboard when Dean wrapped around him again. He looked down to see pleading green eyes stare back up at him. Dean chattered sympathetically at him while nuzzling his leg.
"I doubt it," Castiel said, rubbing at the thump of pain on his head. He loved his daughter. He truly did. But he thought he'd
His master carried him further into the house and then cooed at him as he gently peeled him off his chest. His master set him down on the floor and gave him a nudge towards the dragon.
His grandmother and Gabriel had been arguing about this for months. Castiel's mother had refused to help, the girls were too young, Kali was away on business, and none of the other women in the village would come near their home. Gabriel was the only person able and willing to help.
"But Rachel..." Castiel looked over to see Rachel sound asleep. He looked down to the baby in his arms then to his grandmother. "She won't want to. I'm not her mother."
"I‒ I've seen..." Dean dropped his eyes back down to Castiel's chest. He rubbed at his neck nervously. "I've seen animals before but...it's different for people." He glanced back up to Castiel's face. "Right?"
He watched Dean stretch out on the bed. His pet chattered warmly at him, still half asleep, then flopped over and curled back up in his blanket. It was adorable; his innocent speckled pet all sleepy and warm. And he wanted to trick that innocent little pet into licking up come and slick.
The only stumble was when they reached the ship. It jumped in surprise and tried to run when the door to the ship opened. It got to the end of its leash and fell backwards when its legs kept going but its neck was stopped short by the leash.
The baby gave a soft cry. Castiel jumped. His grandmother pat his shoulder and told him she'd show how to breast feed again.
Castiel shook Dean's hands off his mating tail. His pet whimpered at him. Castiel sighed and gave Dean the bowl. His pet stared at up at him in confusion. Dean glanced between the bowl and Castiel's mating tail. He gave Castiel a wary look.
Castiel waited until Dean had gone an entire day without making a nuisance of himself before he thought about resuming training Dean at meal times.
Evan reached down and drew a finger along Castiel's softening cock. He trailed his finger up until he was drawing it through a splatter of come. He rubbed it into Castiel's skin. "I heard sirens couldn't come with their cocks."
The store employee took a few more minutes to finish his bill and pack all his things into a shipping drone. Castiel watched the overladen drone take off with a sense of defeat. He had bought a pet.
Deidre chose then to squirm in his lap and smash her hand into the bowel of mashed carrots that made up her breakfast.
The human made a series of faces at him before hesitantly edging closer. Castiel tapped the floor in front of him again. The human crept closer then sat down on the floor in front of Castiel.
"What's going on?" Castiel whispered. His mind refused to put it together. There hadn't been any alphas in the village in decades and there had never been any
"What does Daven pay you?" Evan asked. He slid his thumb out of Castiel's mouth. He stared down at Castiel, appraising.
Castiel froze in mid scrub. His scales stayed aroused and stuck up. His eyes flicked between his mating tail and Dean's mouth. He shuddered at the memory of Dean's tongue flicking over his hands.
Castiel stared at Rachel Goodson. He knew how big Deidre had been when she was born. He didn't know how something that big was going to come out of Rachel. He didn't know how something that big had come out of
Dean retreated to the kitchen. He went to his couch and grabbed his blanket. He wrapped it tightly around himself. He was trapped. He wasn't dying so whatever was going on was happening outside of the kitchen. But then that meant some kind of ship wide emergency was going on outside of the kitchen.
Dean didn't know what it meant but he recognized a command when he heard one now. Dean shrugged at him. "I don't get it."
"It's always helpful when you're still nursing, a wet nurse can be hard to find sometimes." His grandmother explained without looking at him. "Some mothers don't make milk right away or they're too tired to nurse properly."
Castiel's back arched again when Dean changed positions. He licked up the side of Dean's neck and found that if he worried Dean's ear with his teeth Dean would squirm and gasp.
Dean threw the ball up a little bit and caught it. His master seemed pleased. He did it a few more times. His master was more entertained than he was. It was just a ball. It didn't take any skill to roll it around. But if his master liked watching him toss it around, well, he wasn't going to deprive the guy who fed him.
"You haven't been with a woman?" His grandmother asked. Castiel blushed and shook his head. His grandmother nodded. "Well, when you do, she won't want a day's worth of dirt and grime in her bird's nest." His grandmother stopped and looked up at Castiel. "The same for an omega boy. Clean fingers if you don't want a bout of the itches." She nodded to herself. "And a clean cock if you don't want a love sickness."
His bladed tail twitched in disgust. What if Dean fondling his mating tail was just the beginning? What if Dean was entering a breeding phase and would only become more sexually aggressive as time went on?
He got a single curt message back from the other spur. It was enough that Castiel knew he wouldn't be amicable to sex.
His father sucked in a deep breath. "I told you!" his father burst out at his mother. "I told you the priest was an idiot!"
He plastered himself against the wall and contemplated just how very wrong he had been as a kid and whether his master had been feeding him all those extra treats to fatten him up so he could feed him to a dragon.
Hannah and Anna came bouncing out of the throng of people in the village square. Gabriel was behind them hauling their food staples for the month.
His master clicked his claws and hissed then stripped his clothes off. Dean rolled over to the far side of the bed. It had made him nervous the first few times his master had stripped down in the bedroom. He had heard of masters buying pets for
A soft frown appeared on Evan's face, as if he was thinking some deep thought. He rubbed a thumb over each of Castiel's nipples until they were hard numbs. Castiel shivered. He didn't make milk anymore but his nipples were still sensitive.
Dean took his bowl and went over to his couch. It was practically doll furniture in comparison to his master but it fit him well enough.
He made it inside without getting chopped in half but his heart rocketed into his throat anyway as soon as he saw who his master was meeting with.
better adjusted to space." She started towards the back. "But I wouldn't recommend a kit. They're a handful at that age." She stopped in front of a row of cages. "Why don't you see if you make friends with any of our shelter pets? They're all trained and housebroken. It takes a bit more for an older human to bond with their owner but it's worth the effort."
His master snorted and pet him then went to the counter again. Dean slid off the chair and followed him over. He kept his head down, careful not to look at the emptiness on the far wall.
Castiel stared at the door stunned. After all that they had done for Rachel and Michael had thrown them out like stray cats.
She had pushed him into his room after and left him with the box. He had opened it to find a polished wooden cock. He had stared at it at first, not sure what to do, then his body had flushed with desire and it had all become so very clear.
His hands jerked apart. He dropped the bread to his feet. He backed up faster. Would anyone believe him when he told them that he hadn't been the one to steal it? The Winchesters had made him a liar as well as a whore as far as the village was concerned.
In the morning Castiel fed Dean with his mating tail again. This time he didn't let himself linger on his doubts. It was just a bit of external stimulation. He probably got more stimulation to his mating tail from his day to day work routine than he did from his pet. It wasn't as if he was going to have
The walk back to the market had Castiel's stomach in coils. He knew the reason why people wouldn't sell them things was because of him. Because of the brand on his face that they put there.
Gabriel shook his head. He took a note out of his pocket and passed it to her. "She doesn't want anything."
"The bulkheads were all closed! I thought you were dead!" Dean babbled against his master's leg. "What am I supposed to do if you die and I'm alone on the ship?"
His eyebrows furrowed. He looked over his shoulder to his baby bundled up in a basket a few steps away. He wondered which god had favoured his child. He hoped she had fared better.
Michael shrank back. He gulped. Castiel's grandmother let go of his hand. He pocketed the chain. A tremble went through him. "Please hurry. She's in so much pain."
His master stared down at him with his creepy yellow-green eyes. He carefully balanced the bowl in the palm of his hand. It looked like minuscule surrounded by his master's claws.
Dean breathed hard through his nose and started thrusting forward. He groaned. Castiel cried out. He squirmed on Dean's cock. It was too much but he wanted more. He wanted Dean's cock to push in forever and never stop.
Castiel huffed. He squeezed his eyes shut. He pushed up from the well's edge. His head throbbed to the beat of his heart. His stomach clenched again; more liquid leaked out. He put a hand to his stomach and groaned. His grandmother had told him this would happen.
In fact, from now on he'd do all his resupply remotely. His therapist would hate him for but if it meant never—
Michael held the door for them. It was the first time Castiel had seen anyone act like a Blackdog was an honoured guest. Castiel stepped inside and blanched at the decadence of the Goodson house. From the outside the Goodson house was modest and well-kept like every other house on the street but inside it was a palace.
Castiel's eyes slid away from the baker. He pushed back his hood. "I can't...I can't pay you then." He ran his fingers over the brand on his cheek.
When he reached it he didn't hesitate to pull open the door to the Silver Head and go in. He breathed in relief when he pulled the door closed behind him. He might be there to whore himself but at least the village wasn't staring at him.
Castiel waited for her to finish up with some elderly wisdom. His grandmother sat quietly beside him and watched the people walk by. She hopped down when someone stopped to buy a charm then puttered around their cart, organizing things for the walk home.
"He'll move out," Hannah commented sadly. She filled the second bucket and attached it to the yolk. "I know I should be happy for them. But he'll move out."
His grandmother snorted. Castiel sighed at his own stupid question. His mother only admitted she was a witch when she sold charms.
Dean narrowed his eyes at the brush. Castiel was sure he was going to stubbornly keep his mouth closed but Dean glanced up at him and slowly opened his mouth.
Gabriel kicked the side of the cart. "Three people wouldn't sell us rice today and the baker charged us double." He glared at Castiel's grandmother. "Is vengeance and pride going to feed us?"
candid about sex since he'd had Deidre but he still couldn't imagine doing the things they talked about. He knew what the baker wanted but the thought made his stomach churn.
His therapist had suggested a few different animals that formed close pack bonds but none of them were suitable for long term space travel, he had only begrudgingly suggested he get a human when Castiel had told him that he was thinking about installing a basic AI to talk to.
Castiel paced the kitchen. It was market day but his grandmother had forbidden him from coming. She had gone so far as threatening to tie him down like a goat if he tried. He knew she was right. He couldn't go to market covered in slick ‒ the priest really would form a mob to run him out of town ‒ but the urge to
those damn doors were a safety hazard. He stalked back up to the door and kicked it. "Stupid fucking doors."
Castiel sighed. A warm glow spread through his chest. Virginity was overrated, he decided. This was far better. He could see why even the elders had all been tempted when they were young.
"I don't have to say anything?" Castiel asked. He looked down at the alter and the tiny bundle that contained the afterbirth.
The next time bath time rolled around his master gave him a sharp look and shoved a nasty looking metal thing into his mouth to hold it open.
Somehow it was worse than Daven Hills's gruff attempts at conversation after and then being unceremoniously kicked out of the bakery.
Dean buried his face in his master's hard chest and waited for those huge dragon-teeth to bite into him.
"Be still." Castiel tugged at the leash to get Dean's attention. The leash wasn't tight enough to keep him in place but it seemed to remind him to not squirm so much.
He hated space. He hated ships. He hated flying. He could ignore it if he didn't see it. As long as the gravity worked on a ship he couldn't tell the difference between ground and a flying death trap. But the moment he saw all that black fear flooded through him.
"I couldn't ask you to do that." Castiel wouldn't watch Gabriel and Kali live hand to mouth to support them.
The door in the kitchen opened and closed. Castiel was surprised that his mother would come back so soon. She had barely wanted anything to do with him since his father left.
"It's not your fault," Castiel repeated. That fire between his legs was crawling up his skin. He stroked Dean's arm. "Kiss me again?"
Castiel's grandmother tugged at his sleeve. She led him up a flight of stairs as if she knew where she was going.
Dean tugged his shirt over his head. He bent down and kissed Castiel on the lips. The tension drained out of him. He smiled. "You're gonna get me in so much trouble tonight."
"What about Kali?" Castiel asked. He knew one day Gabriel and Kali would marry and mate. And on that day Gabriel would leave.
"You little thief!" His grandmother growled. She had Adam Winchester by the back of his torn coat. "Give it up!"
He turned his head away. His master hissed and clicked at him. Dean didn't look back. The hissing and clicking stopped.
It was late into the night before his grandmother declared it time. Castiel was sure it had been time hours ago. He was dripping sweat, the bed was soaked, and the pain was joined with anger.
His master brought his tail closer to Dean's face. He said the command again. Dean figured it probably meant
They stayed until Rachel Goodson woke up again. His grandmother explained all the proper things to do, the charms to carry, and the spells to say to keep the baby healthy. Rachel listened raptly and thanked them. Michael showed them to the door and shut it in their faces.
Castiel let her baby drain both his breasts before giving him back to Brianne, the poor thing needed a full meal. Brianne whispered another thanks and turned to go. Castiel was pulling his shirt back into place when Brianne froze. A desperate whimper left her.
"So how's little Deidre Dean doing?" Gabriel said in a burst of joviality that no one believed. He strode over to the basket on the table and peeled back the blanket to reveal the baby inside.
He spent a few hours reading up on human life habits and came away thoroughly amused by how humans had been observed to mate with
Castiel looked across the kitchen to where his sister was holding his child on her knee. His stomach ached with the memory of pain. He didn't want to go through a birth again even if it wasn't his own.
When they got to the ship his master dropped him down onto his feet. His master froze. His eyes flicked over Dean, lingering on the spots where the blue sticky stuff had rubbed off onto him. His master let out a furious growl and snapped the big dagger tail up.
"Oh god. I hope so," Dean muttered. He wouldn't have to get back onto that horrible ship. Maybe someone who lived on a planet would buy him next.
Very slowly he tugged his mating tail out of the warming sheath. Dean watched with narrowed eyes as he moved his mating tail closer to Dean's mouth.
The employee puffed up in worry. "That one might not be suitable to travel. It's something of an escape artist."
The shock of the delicate soft tongue flicking over Castiel's skin was enough to make him freeze at first but once he realized that Dean was putting his
And he doubted he was even succeeding in training Dean to lick his mating tail. His pet rarely showed much interest in it unless it was time for a meal. A little push against his mating tail proved his point.
Castiel dropped his mating tail to the bed, careful to keep it as far from Dean as possible just in case.
Castiel watched them for a moment. There was no more Ipix-sounding chattering. He glanced at Qech. He didn't seem to find the performance particularly astounding. Castiel quietly snorted at himself. Had he really just wondered if a gang of
They had called him a whore and liar. The Winchesters didn't care about him. Mary Winchester wanted something. He just couldn't understand what it was. They didn't care about his silence. No one blamed John Winchester for what had happened. They didn't care about their reputation. No one believed a lying whore.
Qech chuffed again and shook the human off his head. The human started babbling out terrible Ipix and flailing its hands. Qech bumped it back towards his legs. The human squeaked with excitement. It rubbed up against Qech's genital slit.
His grandmother snorted with amusement. She took Deidre from Castiel's lap. "You need to change then. He won't pay as well if you're covered in carrots and drool."
His grandmother swatted his knee. "We talked about this. You stop when I tell you to or you tear open and bleed everywhere."
Castiel bit his lip. Maybe Gabriel had been right. Maybe the Blackdogs needed to swallow their pride first if they wanted to eat. Castiel looked up and down the street. He breathed deep and stepped into the alley.
His grandmother reached up and pushed the hood back. Castiel turned his face away to hide the brand. His grandmother turned his head back.
