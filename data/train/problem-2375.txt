Dean hmphs. He’s got a point—they’ve been researching ancient warding that might protect against divine beings for hours now, and so far, no dice. The chicken scratch on the page is murder on his eyes.
Behind her, she hears a throat clear. A stranger is standing deep in the alleyway, wearing a tattered jacket and trucker hat. The man looks gruff and dangerous, and Anna immediately puts up her protective charms, probing the air for unpleasant spells.
“Hey,” Dean says, swatting at something in the air. “Quit that, Cas. You’re gonna set something on fire. C’mon.”
Castiel’s eyes were a breathtaking ocean blue in the bright lights, highlighted even more by the shiny silk of his cravat. Dean drowned for a moment.
Castiel wiped a hand across his sticky forehead, frowning at the grime coating it before he sat back, looking up at the empty shelves along the walls. “This is thankless work,” he remarked bitterly.
Dean and Sam share a glance and run through the house, out the back door. Two bikes are leaning against the back porch, one big enough to fit Dean’s taller frame, and the other smaller. Both are rusty and look like they might fall apart, but Dean’s smile is wide as he checks them out.
Once they were both seated, Dean carefully walked Baby to Connie’s side and reached across, catching Castiel’s hand and bringing it to his lips in a tender gesture. The teasing laughter lingering in Castiel’s eyes softened into something warmer, a look that caused the air between them to sparkle with possibility—or that’s how it felt. When Castiel looked at him like
Dean helps him to cut some greens and a couple of cucumbers, and they throw together a salad for lunch.
Dean took a breath, then another. “I know...fuck, I know this sounds so selfish with what’s going on out there, but... You're the only one who grounds me, man. Without you here, stuck in this bunker? I'd go crazy.”
“No, you’re ‘the enemy’ because you both like act dicks,” Dean says furiously. “I tried being your friend, but you’re so closed off, it’s like talking to a freaking brick wall!”
The panic rises again, clawing at Dean's throat. How could he have let this happen? He was supposed to be getting Sam away to safety—a clean getaway across the prairie and the mountains, and on towards California. Instead, they've been chased every step of the way, and now a potentially life-threatening injury. If they hadn't run across this place, and if Castiel hadn't been willing to…
Castiel took a step back from the fire, his heart aching more as the distance increased. There had to be something he could do that wouldn’t mean killing him!
“We should get to class,” Castiel reminds him, letting their joined hands swing down between them again.
“Did he take the Mysticism of the Culinary Arts course?” Castiel asks excitedly. “Hannah…er, Doctor Milton, said it’s absolutely fascinating. I’ve consider enrolling myself, though in the summer, since I’m teaching a full course load.”
Castiel’s gaze hits him, full of such heat that when his hand touches Dean’s upper arm, they both gasp. The professor’s hand is long and warm, fingers spread wide and touching Dean’s shoulder, and that familiar phenomenon of electricity courses through his veins.
“Balthazar?” a voice called, making them all turn to look. A woman approached, clad in a fine burgundy satin gown that ruffled as it fell from her slender waist. “Balthazar! You said you were going to introduce me!”
Castiel returned his smile, something warm expanding in his chest at the brightness in Dean’s eyes. He really did have beautiful eyes, even in the fading daylight. He wanted more than anything to be able to touch Dean, even just hold his hand. Even the idea of it sent a shiver up his spine, the delicious anticipation of even the slightest touch had been driving him mad for weeks.
Castiel interrupts him gently. “Dean, come on. We’ve been over this a hundred times. It’s going to work, or we’ll keep trying until it does.”
Krissy looks perturbed again but gives his hand a limp shake. That’s when Dean’s suspicions are confirmed—there’s a racing stream of lay magic flowing through her veins, way too much for anyone to safely contain.
“All right,” Dean says, covering another yawn, unable to help the droop of his eyes. The physical labor of the day has worn him out, and he’s more than happy to lie down beside Cas, letting Cas run his hand down his shoulder soothingly. He adds sleepily, “Wake me up when it’s my turn.”
“Cas, it’s fine. As I said earlier, I don’t mind if you fall apart now and then. Shows you’re human.”
“Yup.” Dean sighed. “I’ve thought of just giving him the money I've got saved and sending him on his way, but…”
The brawlers wriggle in place and shout to be let down with various levels of profanity, but when the laughing and pointing crowd disperses at security's insistence, they’re returned to the ground.
Cas sighs. “That’s what I was afraid of.” He looks back out at the valley, devastation, maybe despair across his face in the fading light.
“We’ll make an excellent Lettersmen of you yet,” Dean quipped, giving Castiel a hearty wink before turning to spare him his blushes.
The house itself seemed well-kept, a brown stone facade boasting two storeys worth of tall windows. This was Dean and Sam’s family seat? Castiel had to admit he hadn’t expected such a grand place—the brothers hadn’t seemed like they were extremely wealthy, at least.
Castiel's heart races in his chest, anger, sadness, and disbelief warring for a place in the front of his mind. He looks to Dean, unable to form words just yet.
Castiel’s face was all love, and awe, and longing; perhaps even an unshed tear or two, as his reddened eyes blinked quickly in Dean’s direction, once then twice, as he sucked in a visible, shaky breath to calm himself. His smile widened as Reverend Shurley drew to a close.
Sam calls from inside the apartment, “Oh God, is this how it’s gonna be tonight? Because I can leave again if you two are gonna be gross the whole time.”
because that isn’t true anymore, is it? Castiel’s hands are wandering around his back, soothing and strong, and Dean is surrounded by a tight embrace.
Dean looks kind of like a kicked puppy. “But I like kissing you,” he whines, leaning in to bite at Castiel’s lower lip, making him close his eyes and will down his arousal again.
As they danced, their hands moved in unison as they made their way through the steps with their respective partners, and it produced a strange effect that made Dean feel almost as if he were dancing with Castiel, instead. They moved together, stepping and turning, and their eyes always found each other’s again on the return.
A smile comes to Castiel’s face, although the hollow feeling in his gut tells him they haven’t really won. There will always be people who want to control magic. Rowena will find another Thaumatech to create her new Well, and they’ll be back to square one.
Cas jerks awake, looking around in a half-asleep panic. His bedroom. He's lying under the covers, in only his underwear.
“Time to get started on the bird. That cajun rub won’t make itself,” he says, excusing himself. Bobby has a bigger kitchen downstairs, one with much more counter space and a large fridge, where the turkey is currently waiting for Benny’s expert eye. Still, he couldn’t be more obvious in wanting to leave the two men alone, and Dean’s already plotting his revenge. Maybe he’ll spell Benny’s hat zebra patterned, or hot pink…
Dean managed to claw back enough of his faculties to murmur, "I'm game if you are, Cas." He tried for a smirk in Cas’ direction, hoping he didn’t look as out of his depth as he felt.
At least, I'm ninety percent sure they are—neither of them will admit it, but they so are. They think they're being sneaky, but let me tell you, friend—I've
“Well don’t sound too excited about it,” Dean says, laughing despite his frustration. He eyes Castiel’s answering smile, still unwilling to leave him without any hope of continuing this later. "Will I see you again?"
He doesn't like it. It feels dangerous. Sure, he'd been involved with lay societies in England. He'd even tutored at a local college for a while during his master's. But here in the states…lay magic is unacceptable for someone like him, at least in society's eyes.
Where have they come from? Dean has no idea where Castiel’s farm actually is in relation to any towns, but there must be something nearby for Azazel to infect. Surely he couldn’t have moved these people far like this. But who knows what that fucker is capable of?
Castiel took a step toward Dean, but then seemed to catch himself, stopping short. “They all look the same?” he asked, his voice tight.
Naomi’s gaze was like the strongest storm current as she turned it on him again. “Castiel, what have you done?”
Castiel can feel Dean’s shock as a shift in his magic. He lifts his forehead from Dean’s shoulder and peers at him. “What’s wrong?”
Cas breathes out harshly, terrified. That had been worse than last night’s—this time he'd been sure his nerves were on fire.
Smiling at him, Dean said, “You can ask, you know. If I thought the conversation was untoward, I wouldn’t have started it.”
Thanks for reading this story! I'd love to hear your thoughts, before you go check out the other great stories posted in the Harlequin collection for this year.
What in the deep was Gabriel playing at? Had Castiel done something wrong already? Castiel forced himself to breathe, trying to unclench as Dean started up a moderate rhythm pulling the oars through the water. It was going to be fine, he just had to keep his mind on the task. This was romantic, wasn’t it?
“Nope, ‘start’ and ‘stop’ are the same button. You probably just kept turning the timer off by accident.” Castiel hums quietly, as if that knowledge is actually interesting, and the timer begins to countdown from fifty. Without a task to distract them, they finally turn to each other.
Dean does the math in his head, totaling up the time it’ll take him to leave campus, put some finishing touches on his thesis draft, and get showered and dressed. “Six-thirty okay?”
“Dean, he’s here! I saw him right before Rosco grabbed me. Ruby was with him, but he didn’t look—” Castiel’s eyes go wide. “Whatever was going on didn’t look voluntary to me.”
Dean couldn’t wait to show Castiel how much this meant to him. He’d always been a family man at heart, even if John’s pushing and title hunting wasn’t the way he wanted to go about things. He certainly never considered that he’d get to have this: marrying for love, even if in a roundabout way.
“Yes ma’am,” he answers somberly, feeling more loved and supported than he has all week. He hasn’t told anyone what happened with Castiel—his buddies figure he’s just blowing off steam this week, Charlie thinks he’s freaking out about teacher observations that are coming up. Sam, who normally would’ve made his brother have a heart-to-heart days ago, has been too preoccupied with his new girlfriend to notice much else. He doesn’t blame the kid for being busy—Bobby’s busy too, apparently. Confiding in Ellen might be just what he needs right now, and he opens his mouth intending to spill his damn guts, when he sees Lisa walk through the door. She’s in a dark peacoat, her hair long and in curls, and she smiles at Dean like he’s as radiant as the freaking sun. Jesus, he really needs to end this now before he breaks this girl’s heart.
Bodies have appeared, and fallen to the cream carpet around the room. There’s Sam, his brother, and Novak, their little redheaded mage friend, and Dr. Macleod. The Boss appears to be the only one conscious, groaning on the carpet, and the other redhead magician rushes forward to kneel next to the prone body of the Captain.
The guy's eyes return to Sam, and Dean sees the slightest softening in his face. He turns, saying gruffly, “Bring him.”
The churchyard stretched away into the night, but it was dark and silent, the breeze moving through the trees the only movement. Still, Castiel couldn’t help but feel exposed, here. Like there was a buzzing undercurrent to his pulse, like he could almost sense...something. He scanned the nearest graves, but the darkness was too close. If only the moon were closer to full!
do well. Charlie’s is imperfect but cool as hell, a carved version of Princess Leia with the twisted buns on either side, though they’re lopsided.
Gabriel glared up at him from the water below, the fins at the side of his face all flared in a way Dean was starting to get meant annoyance.
As he gets out his notebook and pens, to prepare for the lecture, Cas notices Claire yawning and rubbing at her face with her little fists. She’s tired, there’s no doubt. At least he’s sitting by the door at the front of the lecture hall so he can make a quick getaway if he needs to.
“Between the two of us, you’re the one with the princess hair,” he grumbles back, though he takes half the forks and knives from Sam’s outstretched palm, working the opposite end of the table. “Where is everybody?”
He closes his eyes tightly and cries out as it erupts out of him, pouring out of his fingers and down into the earth.
He stood up again, moving away to try to escape, when John spoke up again. "You heading out?" he asked, scowling.
Castiel's smile dropped as he saw the St. Mary's church group among them. Mrs Naomi Tapping's gold-threaded turban stood out among the crowd, and Lady Hester Holmes scowled at somebody standing beside her.
His release came upon him suddenly, building low in him and blasting outwards into his limbs, until he cried out at the stars in his vision. He was aware of Dean pumping his own cock only a few times before he, too, shot his seed all over the bedclothes, and they both slumped to the side, boneless.
“I’ll admit, when I accepted the invitation, I didn’t realise she was quite this well-heeled. I’m not as knowledgeable on such matters as I should be.”
Dean throws back the last of his coffee, wondering once again what she sees in the scrawny blond kid. Six-year-olds are such whirlwinds—he can barely keep up with Claire and her friends and what they get up to. “All right, kid, drink up. It's time for school.”
“The middle Milton boy—or oldest now, I suppose—has been called back from the continent, and his family has made arrangements for him to take up his brother’s place here immediately.”
Charlie with the dramatic entrances again—how is he ever going to explain this? Cas leans back against the brick wall, dropping his gaze to the man lying on the ground, who moans slightly as he shifts. Cas lifts a hand to rub at the back of his head where it struck the bricks—it’s sore to touch.
“Will you show me the gardens, my lady?” Stevie asked Charlie as Castiel stepped away, and she and Charlie headed back to the garden path, arm in arm.
Then off the top hat and cane went, and Dean slipped into the ballroom with Sam still smirking at his side.
Dean’s heart leapt within his chest, but he merely nodded thoughtfully, his heart breaking for this friend along with its joy at this revelation. Before he could reply, Cas continued.
Mick shrugged one shoulder, well at his ease. “What else is there to do at these functions while the women are at their socialising, eh? Apart from drink, o’course!” He raised his cup to Castiel and they drank once more, grinning.
“I can think of much better activities for that ass, but sure, sounds fun,” Castiel says breezily, sliding one hand into Dean’s back pocket. Dean’s pretty sure he’s forgotten what breathing even is, because what the hell, he’s supposed to be out in public with Cas right now while getting teased like
“Her husband was a prisoner of war,” Castiel said suddenly, sounding utterly horrified. “It happens, that we can’t get our boys back, or they pass before they are reached, sometimes—a tragedy, of course, but surely she can’t hold us responsible for—”
“She’s been like this for a few days now. The doctor said it was just a cold, so we can’t do anything except wait it out.”
Dean moans, but pushes Castiel away with two hands this time. "Stop. Cas, I've been preparing for this all week. Let me do it now, okay?"
Dean blushes and grins, throwing his hands up in surrender as Gabriel squishes him between them. It feels even better, once Dean is in the mix—complete in a way that Anna had never expected. She had never thought Castiel finding his perfect person would impact her at all, but then again, she never let herself dream that she could be a part of her brothers’ lives again. But she’s accomplished what she had set out to do—the Stanford Seal is not only gone, the Well is, too—and she can begin rebuilding her life.
“You’ve been unconscious for a while, Dean.” Anael is still looking at him like he might collapse again, but Dean is far too focused on getting to Cas to even notice. “We almost went to the hospital.”
Hoping no one would see either his red cheeks or his bare toes, Dean hastened straight for his bedchamber.
The room was growing darker. Dean had assumed that the sun was setting, but as the noise drew his attention away from Lady Donn directly, he realized that the great floor-to-ceiling glass windows that adorned the whole left side of the ballroom were dim—no, black. It was like night had fallen suddenly, enveloping the outside of Sands House in inky darkness.
"No head injury to explain this amnesia, either," she added, thoughtfully. "He really doesn’t speak any English?”
Castiel desperately wants to know what the hell he’s talking about, but hadn’t Dean just said that Azazel would try to get in his ear? He shakes his head, lining up for another shot, the blood roaring in his ears. He hears another gunshot down the hill.
The boss speaks quietly into the professor's ear, “How is the school warded?” He brings his left hand up to hover over the professor's chest, making him gasp and shake his head.
Cas watches around a broken section of wall as Azazel and several of the Croats come into view, standing on the far side of the vegetable garden. Azazel lifts his arm, pointing towards where Cas is hiding.
“Sorry about her,” Dean grumbles the moment they’re alone. “She takes her role as unofficial kid sister way too seriously.”
It had been a mostly teasing point of contention between them so far; Castiel wasn’t fond of sugary nicknames and endearments, which of course only made Dean wish to call him them all the more. But that one, Dean had noticed secretly during Castiel’s convalescence, he didn’t seem to object to as much as others. In fact—though he wouldn’t say as much aloud—Dean noticed the slight pinking of Castiel’s cheeks at the name, and the way his eyes would dip away almost shyly, and thought that he might even like it a little.
She smiled prettily, leading the way to the chalked section of the floor to join a few other couples, Dean and Lady Antonia Bevell among them, along with Miss Becky Rosen and Miss Rachel Tapping.
Castiel's eyes widen. He tries to strengthen his spell, but he's off-book here—he's never learned a spell to pull manifestations out of an inanimate object before. The voices are slippery and he struggles to hold onto the one they'd just heard, but then Dean lifts his hands and magic slams into Castiel's, and with a disorienting lurch, they're surrounded by a shifting, grey fog. He can’t even see the walls of his bedroom anymore, or the bed that should be just behind where Dean is standing.
Instead, he moved his lips to Castiel’s neck, letting his tongue run rough down the side of it until he reached the fleshy spot where his shoulder began. Dean grinned against Castiel’s skin then, loving the way that Castiel immediately went limp in delight, his head pushing back into the pillow in anticipation. Dean’s hands journeyed lazily down Castiel’s body while his lips and teeth sowed the beginnings of a possessive mark onto Castiel’s skin. He was always careful never to let his lips wander above where Castiel’s cravat would cover in public, but he knew by now that the good Lord Milton loved to go about his day with the tender remains of Dean’s attention still on his body, here and there.
He pumps Cas’ hole full of come and it feels intimate and dirty and right. Then he falls on top of him with a shaky exhale, kissing his neck lazily as he comes down.
Jo's eyes widened in turn as she takes in his reaction. “Oh shit, you guys really are…? Damn, he really did stand you up?"
“I shall go there.” Dean turned abruptly, heading for the front door. “I shall try once more to make your aunt see sense, Hannah. And if that does not work...we shall see.”
"Mmm, I could stay here all day," Castiel says, pulling Dean in again to kiss him with a hand to his cheek, relishing the raw magic brushing his skin.
At that moment, Dean honestly had no answer. His eyes were locked on Lady Donn, taking in her frowning face, the wrinkles at her brow as she scowled out across the ballroom.
It’s a complicated spell, Dean’s not surprised to learn. The hand gestures alone vary into twelve different positions, all minor changes and adjustments that could crash the caster into the wall or even start a fire if not done properly. But Donna is a confident and cool-headed instructor, her years as a nurse really shining through while they’re all in crisis mode, and after a while many of them have mastered it. Cas, Dean, Bobby, and Ellen have it memorized first, with Anna, Sam, Jo, and Anael following close behind. Some of the other lay magicians aren’t trained enough to learn the gestures that quickly, but offer up their own energy to be channeled, which Dean is still grateful for. Dorothy tries to rally, but she can barely see to practice the motions over the tears in her eyes, and eventually she joins the other lay magicians—offering up what supplemental energy she can.
Castiel turned back as he began to unwrap the fabric from his hands. “A compromise for what? The case?”
He tries to soothe Castiel completely, kissing him all over and using his free hand to caress his skin. Still, the moment his finger slips between his boyfriend’s cheeks, he feels a nervous clenching engulf his finger.
"Hey, Cas," he replies with a grin as the instructor brushes past Dean on his way to the front of the classroom.
“I’m sure that’s the case,” Crowley says over his shoulder as he unlocks the cupboard and stashes the keys back in his pocket. “These books are valuable, Castiel. I wouldn’t want anything untoward to happen to my things.” He opens one side of the cupboard and stands back, gesturing at the rows of volumes lined up inside.
When Castiel joins Dean in the bedroom, Sam is just waking with a snort. He props himself on his good side to look at them, rubbing at his face with the other hand.
In an instant, Dean finds his head nuzzled against Castiel’s chest, arms wrapped around his back, the feeling of Castiel’s innate magic swirling inside him as they lie on the sand. It feels mind-blowingly good, but Dean doesn’t want to make Castiel feel obligated to share his magic, so he mutters, “You don’t have to…”
“Go,” Dean said, nodding toward Lady Rowena with a small smile as he retrieved the pencil with which Charlie had marked his page in
Dean threw down his hand. “I must apologize,” he said, “my attention is not all here. Perhaps the Duke’s friend, there, can pick up my cards.”
The admission brings a smile to Dean’s face as he lightly runs his fingers down the curve of Cas’ cheek. He shifts back a little so he can bend down to kiss Cas, his lips warm and soft against Cas’.
Dean and Cas grimace at each other before hurrying out to join the kids. Dean calls, “Whatever you think you saw—no, you didn’t!”
Why write such things down and leave them in a place anyone could read them? Castiel hadn’t understood, and evidently, the shop’s caretaker, Mr Adler, had disagreed with the presence of novels on the shelves at all, preferring to pack them away when he’d taken on the tea room after Balthazar had been too sick to continue working.
Castiel said, flustered, “Naomi! I was just…” He waved his hand at the cavern ahead, then looked down at his tailfin as he trailed off. No excuse was going to get him out of completely missing his father's birthday celebration.
“Yeah, but what…I mean… Who’s after you guys? And why?” Dean feels dumb as hell asking these questions when he’s the only one who doesn’t know, evidently, but he’s got to get some info because he’s in
Dean lets out an unexpectedly chuckle. “‘Young lady’? How old are you again?” he teases, and Castiel rolls his eyes and smiles. “Uh, yeah, that’s her. She’s my student too, and not a good one.”
Sam sighs, not even looking up from Tiktok or whatever the hell the kids are on these days. His mostly brown and gold owl-eyed mask is pushed up on his head, keeping his L’Oreal hair out of his eyes. “Yes, Dean, I’m sure. We need to get into Lady Chester’s inner circle, and this ball is the best time to do it. We went over this.”
He glances back to Cas. Being invited to Cas’ house seems like a dream he’s been wishing too hard for...but the fact is, he and Claire weren’t planning on anything for New Year’s Eve anyway. Dean’s other friends all have plans elsewhere, so this almost seems like kismet. “Are you sure? We wouldn’t want to intrude…”
The third time Cas is in the kitchen and Dean has shifted into cat again, fast asleep on the couch. Cas nearly explodes before Dean wakes up enough to shift and grab him, and when it's over they both realize Dean is naked again. Dean spends the next few hours practicing shifting with his clothes.
Sam lifts his head, his face pale and shiny with sweat. "You k-keep going, Dean. I don't think I can g-go any further."
Dean laughs, his hands soapy from washing dishes. He knows he could magic them clean, but he’s got most of his food prepped now and he likes to keep his hands busy. “Tell her I said all’s forgiven, but just ‘cause it’s Christmas.”
“And you solved it?” The Captain’s eyes are gleaming with interest, and Dean’s not sure what to make of it.
Dean may affect a grumpy mood when faced with the holiday season, but honestly, Christmas is one of his favorite times of year. He loves the decorated apartments and shops, and he loves getting his friends and family gathered, warm and safe and well-fed. It hasn't always been a great time of year for him and Sam, but now he’s determined to make it as perfect as possible for Claire. Starting with this Christmas concert.
He hears the smile in Missouri's voice. "Thanks, Castiel. If he comes to see me, I'll encourage him to give you another chance, just as I hope you'll do the same. Just do a bit of practical study together—I'm sure it'll help."
Rachel’s partner was a young man Castiel didn’t know, and he valiantly tried to step in. “Come now, Miss, let us continue the dance?”
Castiel held his hands out and shrugged. “You liked women. And absolutely not your awkward friend who happened to be in love with you.”
“Damn, and here I was hoping you were dividing up the ladies present and you might have some scraps,” Ketch jested.
“Even more of a reason to take it slow,” Dean says, trying to be reasonable so Cas’ first time is memorable in the right ways.
The demon struggled beneath his hold, as he tried to take stock of what he had. The vial of holy oil—not much use at close range. He needed to get to Lady Donn and stop her before she summoned any more of the creatures, before they could go to London. The knife was his only hope, but he couldn’t use it. Could he? Dean’s face started to blur in front of Castiel’s eyes, and he angrily dashed the tears out of them with one sleeve.
“I’ll introduce you right now. This is my boyfriend, Dean Winchester,” Cas says, stretching his arm out and pulling Dean to him. Dean goes unwillingly, not even trying to hide that he’s in a bad fucking mood, but just being touched by Cas eases some of the tension inside him. He tries to calm himself down by thinking:
“Please, have a seat.” Dr. Novak’s voice is flat and hurried, as if his mind is somewhere else, and Dean feels a pang of disgruntlement at the thought. Whatever the professor is going through, Dean intends to charm him back into a good mood.
They resettled, and Dean began recounting his afternoon out with much more detail than he’d given at the dinner table on the day of his outing, when John had quizzed him on his social engagements.
“You guys are so adorable, I think I’m gonna puke. Get out of here,” she says, heading out of the room.
P.S. It is now our head canon that Crowley would totally watch Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and nothing can change that now haha.
Dean scoffs aloud and looks away, but then gazes back down at his phone, reading the email again. And again.
his forte. He’d much rather be doing something more hands-on, though being in Castiel’s company is enough to make him feel pumped full of adrenaline. “Where’s yours?”
Cas shook his head. "That doesn’t matter. We’ve got Jack back now, and he’s on the way to being able to take Chuck down. You don’t need me here anymore.” He stood up, turning to leave, but Dean reached up to catch him by the sleeve of his coat before he could leave.
“Wait, Anna,” he says, reaching out to her again. “Promise you won’t just…disappear. I thought I’d lost you again today—I…”
She lives on the third floor, so they shuffle up about a million steps before she creaks her front door open. She takes Dean’s hand and leads him straight to the bedroom, which he takes as a very good sign, but after only a few lazy kisses she excuses herself and heads into the bathroom. Dean slips his shoes off and makes himself comfortable on her bedspread, looking around the room for a spark of entertainment but only spotting books and yoga mats and a messy pile of makeup. Feeling slightly bored, he slips his cellphone from his pocket for the first time in a few hours.
Castiel watches Rosco until he slips out of the building, then he quickly follows him across campus towards the library.
Inside the gap between hedges, a narrow path leads to the left and right for some distance. Castiel can feel energy humming around him. He’s never been actually inside a magical construct before. The scale of it is astounding, even though he’s sure most of it is an illusion. He turns, looking back up the hill to see Dean walking down to join him. The fact that he and Dean can actually see each other is interesting—most illusions are keyed to one person, unless they're specifically cast to allow people to see each other. He wonders if he and Dean are seeing the same things—the spellwork required for that kind of synchronization would be much more complex than he's ever…
It was drizzly, as London was wont to be. The early morning smog still hung heavy and thick in the air; Dean pulled his scarf over his mouth, trapping his curling breaths within the wool. It was far too early to be out, especially here. Spring was well underway, but London was begrudging in its admittance of the fact. The sun hadn’t yet risen to warm the air of the docks, and between the smell of fish and the smell of death from the body at Dean’s feet, Dean found himself glad of it.
Dean gets back to shoveling earth over the ashes in the grave. “Yeah, it’s a lot nicer now there aren’t dead Croats lyin' around.”
As usual, Dean finished his ice cream in record time, but Cas appreciated every bite, looking at the waffle cone intently before biting into it.
The next few minutes were lost in a haze, but when he regained his senses, Sam was propping him upright and saying, “Miss Jessica, would you please go and fetch my brother? He’ll already be inside, I imagine. Ask him to meet us at the Tea Room?”
Dean sat forward on his chair. "Monday…I saw him on Monday, I believe. He seemed his usual self, cheerful and keen."
. Dean picks up the sketchbook instead and places it in front of her. "All right, well how 'bout you take this instead, and I'll make a hot chocolate."
He thinks back to the warning Bobby had given him weeks ago. Even if this has nothing to do with the Captain, being cautious is something Dean could use more of…right? So he simply says, “Just Dean.”
. Jo comes to take his lunch order, but he mumbles something about waiting for his friend, too absorbed in what he’s reading. This is the first opportunity he’s had to dig into the book Castiel lent him, considering he’s been knee-deep in thesis planning since his proposal was approved. As excited as he is to have a project he’s actually motivated to work on, learning more about his supposed affinity to Castiel’s magic is also at the top of his to-do list. Thankfully, he still has about fifteen minutes before Cas is supposed to meet him for lunch, so he hunkers down and keeps reading.
Dean handed off the lady he’d been helping to someone at the doorway, and he turned to rejoin Castiel facing the demon incursion.
Still, he wasn’t ready to tell John about any of what had happened since the storm, and certainly not that he had a trade agreement with the merfolk. He might never be.
“Yes, for me," Crowley says, his grin still in place. "The lay folk have had their taste, now, and I must say, it's an excellent vintage—" he pauses, sending a flurry of white sparks up when he snaps his fingers, "—but to get to it, they're going to come through me."
The glow intensifies as they cross the field, dim grey headstones looming out of the shadows around them. There’s a feeling in the air—the same kind of buzzing sensation that Cas had felt in his apartment earlier. Something brushes past Cas, sending goosebumps across his skin even under his trenchcoat, but when he turns there’s nothing there. He hurries to stay closer to Dean.
Dean barks a laugh. “No, Bobby's no Time Lord. It’s just a relocation spell. A powerful one, but Bobby’s the best.”
“Crowley!” Dean shouts, already casting a charm to propel Crowley against the wall—but the sigil is strong and protects them from the outside, the spell bouncing off the walls and making Dean falter. He gets his footing again and grits his teeth, hands in fists the closer he gets to the sigil. “Look at me, you son of a bitch.”
Meg’s silence on the other end of the line meant that she doesn’t believe him. He puts the beer bottle down on the table in front of him, then rubs at his eyes with his cool fingers. “We’ve got a busy couple of weeks coming up. Maybe after the holidays—”
Dean tried to subtly shuffle away from the young guy who’d been leaning into his space. He’d been enjoying the attention, of course, but he never would have…
The watchman made a small choking noise, before backing away. “I’ll get the boys to clear everyone out, sirs,” he said, backing away quickly, suddenly seeming much keener on being elsewhere.
The other thing that feels impossible at the moment is getting said boyfriend to put his phone down and
“That’s an understatement,” Castiel says, with a hint of uneasiness. “But you can say I do have a…personal interest in the mechanics of spellcasting.” He shrugs, as if it’s nothing worth noting, but Dean knows this subject is considered difficult and dense. What kind of mage explores a secondary subject matter just for…fun? Before he can prod further, though, Castiel is tilting his head and looking questioningly at his watch.
Castiel struggled to work out what she was talking about. “An exorcism? In Latin?” As he spoke the words, the memory resurfaced of Dean passing him the notebook that Sam had provided. Latin spells...untested, unproven, but perhaps within were the words for the exorcism? It wasn’t exactly a prayer one learned at Sunday school—Castiel was going to need help with it.
They were gentler, then, though no less passionate. Castiel’s seeking fingers soon had Dean’s shirt off the bed, and his breeches kicked aside. When he’d kissed every inch of Dean’s collarbone he sat up, straddling Dean’s hips, and Dean reverently pushed up the simple white nightshirt that he wore. Castiel discarded it over his head, and for a moment Dean just stared; busy painting into his memory the gorgeous, naked sight of Castiel’s muscled, lightly tanned body in his lap, looking down at him.
“Nothing,” he says nonchalantly, and Sam smirks at him so broadly that he rolls his eyes in response.
“Anyways…what the hell happened with Brady?” Sam asks, mouth partially full of some whole wheat vegan panini crap. Dean is really gonna have to have a talk with Ellen about what
He stares at the street lights, remembering the hungry look in Dean’s eye in his apartment, wondering what might have been, had he been brave enough.
The blood in Castiel’s face seems to have been replaced with fire. “You mean my boyfriend? Last I checked it wasn’t against the rules for colleagues to be romantically involved.”
Benny spies him as soon as he walks into the foyer, hurrying over to clap a hand to his shoulder. “You okay there, brother? Lookin’ a little…” He trails off as an arc of electricity runs up Cas’ arm and crawls its way over to Benny.
Most of the class is rugged up in wooly hats and scarves as they arrive, standing in the doorway as they shed their layers. But as Dean is removing his coat and hanging it on the pegs outside the door, Castiel sweeps in, his tan trenchcoat flapping out behind him like a cape. His cheeks are barely pink from the cold, his hair just as tousled as usual even without a hat.
Castiel manhandles him to the desk, throwing all the papers and folders and trays down in a dramatic sweep. He lifts Dean onto the desk, filling the space between his parted legs as his mouth finds Dean’s again. Dean’s breathing is erratic now, but he can hardly stop and catch his breath. Castiel is beautiful like this—sexy and dominating, single-minded in his pursuit to make Dean feel good. Their kisses turn more frantic when Dean finally unzips Castiel’s trousers and slips his hand into the front flap of Castiel’s boxers, drawing Cas closer to him and stroking their erections together. The shared rhythm feels like pure ecstasy, the weight of both dicks familiar and arousing in Dean’s hand, and they gasp and moan and kiss as Dean’s hand speeds up.
“Sure,” Ruby says. “Nice place you got here. I didn’t know you had any other friends.” Before Castiel can protest, she continues, “Does Dean know the kind of people you’re working with outside of the college?”
“I’m gonna do all that’n more,” Dean promises breathlessly, speeding up his hands as Castiel fucks himself inside Dean’s fist, hips moving rapidly. The drag of Cas’ cock against his makes his breath hitch, his skin vibrating with longing, his magic curling around Cas’ in a powerful burst. “Want to have you in my mouth, Cas. Want to feel your fingers inside me. Want to ride your cock until we’re both screaming.”
Dean knocked politely on the closed door once they reached it, and at a voice from within, he opened it. Castiel could see Bobby rising from his desk, and sitting in one of the chairs opposite it, a middle-aged, dark skinned woman Castiel hadn’t met before.
Castiel agrees easily enough and they head in that direction. About halfway there, though, they’re stalled by a sudden traffic jam. Impatient, Dean moves up a few spaces and stretches out on his tiptoes, trying to see what the holdup is. He finds out quickly that there’s commotion going on, and he pushes his way more insistently through the crowd, wondering if Cas is following him but not stopping long enough to look.
“Really, Cas? Just what am I to you? ‘Cause I gotta tell you, I’m getting some real mixed—” He cuts himself off. Lowering his voice slightly, he takes a breath, and says, “Whatever this…this affinity...bond thing is between us, all I know is, I can’t let you get hurt. I can’t lose you.”
Castiel calls out, “Hey! Stop that!” as he shoves his way forward again. He reaches the front of the crowd, circling the brawl just as the guy beating on Dean pulls a handful of fireball into his fist and winds back to hit Dean with it. Castiel quickly twists his fingers to pull water out of the air to dump on the guy, extinguishing the flame around his hand. He stands, blinking in surprise through his suddenly wet hair for barely a second, before Dean casts with one palm to the back of his other hand and pushes the guy over with a concussive force. Dean looks back at Castiel with a grin, but before he can rejoin the fight, Dean disappears upwards. The skinny guy who’d just been on the ground, Dean, and three of their opponents are held in the air above the crowd, their feet dangling while their arms are held to their bodies. Castiel looks behind him to see security guards casting from the edges of the crowd. Magical security doesn’t really need to get involved, after all—being able to cast from a distance has its advantages.
Ellen’s sympathetic gaze didn’t help his mood. He didn’t want people’s pity—that only made everything worse. She shook her head lightly, saying, “Don’t you pay him mind, d'you hear? You’ll be right as rain and back out there in no time, you’ll see.”
Castiel inclines his head slightly towards Adler in what Dean assumes is thanks, then his gaze narrows. He turns his dark eyes back on Dean, instead. “I have news from Demonside, but I am to deliver it directly to your ruling council.”
He turns around in time to see the boss slam his hand down on the desk, making Inias flinch where he stands in front of it.
In person, there was some risk to showing his opinions on literature, and not just because his opinions were progressive. Some of the fuddy-duddy traditionalists in these parts would consider his level of interest unsuitable for a man; emasculating, even. (And not only his love of literature, but also his other wide-ranging interests: music, theatre, and eagerly devouring all kinds of cultural trends as they arose. Dean didn’t always like them, his tastes were specific, but he kept abreast of the latest trends and could analyze them endlessly with his sharp wit.) According to many, he should be thinking only about sensible, manly things like horseflesh and ale and women, not
“Never a problem when you’re around,” Castiel says, and Dean smiles and blushes pink. Christmas sex just might be the best sex, and they still have a few hours before their guests arrive, so maybe they can take some time together in the shower. Or the bed. Or the couch. Or, apparently, kitchen counter. Really, Dean is fine with any place as long as it involves a naked Castiel.
Castiel tilts his head and frowns, looking genuinely sympathetic. “I’m so sorry, Dean.” He sticks his hands in his zip-up hoodie, looking at the ground. “Is that the…young lady who convinced him to try and break into the Seal?”
Castiel digs into a pocket on the inside of his overshirt, pulling out what looks like a rolled-up cigarette and a lighter. He turns to Dean. "I come here sometimes to, y'know"—he holds up the joint between his fingers—"take the edge off. You mind if I…?" He raises an eyebrow again in question, and Dean shakes his head, surprised. He's not much of a smoker, only occasionally at parties, but he has to admit, the sight of Castiel lighting up and drawing in a heavy drag, then blowing the fragrant smoke out above their heads in a long exhale… It's hot as fuck.
Must be time to get into this thesis project, right? (Aka, sexual tension and pining, with some academics sprinkled in…)
The stall owner buzzed over to him. “It’s okay, sir, please pick something up, have a look! Finest quality…”
He takes care of business, but as he’s heading to the sinks lined up on the opposite wall, he catches sight of his own face in the mirror. Deep circles ring his eyes, and he looks pale and tired as he frowns at his reflection. He’s been stressing about the end of school far too much, but Cas has also been draining him too much to be healthy. He seriously doubts there’s any actual venom involved, although some of the darker marks on his neck, as he inspects them in the mirror, may actually have broken skin. He drops his eyes to run his soaped hands under the water, wondering what he should say to Cas.
Gabriel turns back to Castiel in a dramatic spin, then takes a long look at Dean where he's standing at the kitchen door. "Boyfriend, huh? Guess my baby bro left out a few details…"
“Sounds like Oxford. Everyone getting all worked up, the city practically shutting down over just a few inches.”
“Thank you.” Castiel climbs out of the bed, heading into the bathroom and letting the warm water wash away his doubts. Dean comes in while the water is still running, looking hesitant, but the tiny shower is barely wide enough for Castiel to squeeze into, let alone two. He trades kisses with Dean as they trade places, smiling reassuringly as he runs a hand along Dean’s jaw. He heads out with the towel around his hips to find
If Anna wasn’t in such a precarious situation, she would laugh. Crowley is still arguing that he’s doing this for the
“That’s true, I suppose. How uncharitable to write something like that in the paper, though. She could just as well have avoided the place and kept her thoughts to herself.”
The looming pine trees suddenly feel oppressive, and he quickly steps back up into the RV-slash-house to see Dean waiting for him, an indulgent and slightly annoyingly smug smirk on his face. Bobby must have gone into another room.
Dean can only make a satisfied hum from where his face is still half-buried in a pillow, but he smiles. His ass doesn’t ache like he thought it might, but that’s probably Cas’ doing with his healing demon magic. Of course incubi would have magical cocks.
The demon just laughed, twisting Dean’s features into an expression that Dean would never have worn. “No, this one is very strong, the Lady Donn made sure we would have the sweetest offerings. You’ve failed, holy man. Surrender.”
Five minutes later, everyone except Jess is in attendance—even Ruby, though she’s sitting in the very back with a hoodie covering her head. Between her presence and Adler’s constant goading, Dean isn’t sure he’s going to be able to pull himself together enough to lead the class. As if on cue, Castiel leans against the window and gives Dean a reassuring smile and tilt of the head, as if to say,
“How is it that Charlie—Lady Bradbury, rather—holds the title and such a wealth of land and property, then? She had no brothers?”
Balthazar picks up a bottle of wine and pours himself a generous glass, followed by a second without even asking Castiel. “What’ve you got here, Cassie?” he asks, eyeing off the plate Castiel has just placed on the table, next to a flat platter of butterfly cakes with fluttering wings, and a large tureen of soup that bubbles away, despite not being anywhere near a heat source. Castiel can sense the spell low inside the pot, though—he wonders if it's a new one of Ree Drummond’s. The Pioneer Woman is a genius, even if she must know someone on the inside at the Council to get her spells sanctioned so quickly.
Castiel is surprised when a black cat he met at a festival with his friend Charlie shows up on his doorstep. On Halloween, strange things start happening to Cas, electrical failures, telekinesis. He starts throwing out lightning and suddenly the cat turns into a naked man in his apartment. Turns out, Cas is a witch. They go to Stull Cemetery and help to hold the gate of hell closed with the rest of Dean's coven, but not before a bunch of demons escape. Dean is Castiel's familiar, and he takes him to his coven leader Bobby's RV, which teleports them to his house, where Cas is now meeting other members of the coven and learning a few things about witches and familiars. Pam arrives, and tells Castiel they've been expecting him...
He’d stopped by every day since, whenever he could get out of his father’s sight and pretend to be off doing something far more acceptable to him—evenings at his Club, or trips about town.
He watches the evening steal across the valley from his window, lost in the melancholy of being alone once more. When he finally crawls into bed, visions of Croats attacking him prevent him from sleeping, even as he blows them up in his exhausted half-dreams. When he eventually drops off, he dreams in full color of Croats surrounding Dean, diving on him and pulling him apart while Azazel looks on, laughing. Cas screams out and wakes up with Dean’s name on his lips, sitting bolt upright.
“Everything’s going to be fine, Dean. We’ve got this,” he murmurs into Dean’s shoulder, enjoying the calm that being so close brings.
Castiel knows emotions can affect the way magic feels all too well—he’d borne the brunt of Meg’s magical grief after she’d had a nasty breakup one time. But it sounds like Sam has stuck by Dean over the weekend, and for that he’s grateful.
He’s not sure how to navigate this part of the library, so he lets Castiel take the lead, following him down a twisted hallway. They’re taking an unfamiliar route—all they seem to be passing are a bunch of librarians’ offices, a wing of the library Dean’s never spent much time in. As worried as he is, Dean is soothed just by the reminder that Cas is ahead of him, near him, with him to see this thing through.
“Cas, baby,” Dean pants, reaching up for a kiss, and Castiel brushes their lips together absently, evidently too focused on his cock to do much else. “Fuck, the things you do to me. The things you’ve
Eliza’s back hit the wall of the hallway with an indelicate thump as Dean leaned down to kiss a gentle line up her neck and along her jawline. She gasped, lifting one knee to press against the side of his, and he cursed the fact that she was wearing such a long skirt that getting under it was going to be difficult.
“No, Dean, he does. He’s lost so much—he needs you. Plus, I don’t think I’ve ever seen you as happy as you are here."
Managing a weak, wobbly smile, Dean nodded. “I know, I know…” he murmured, watching the seas in Castiel’s eyes spill over and flood his cheeks.
More lightning crashed down into the water this time, and in the momentary brightness he saw Benny dragging Garth’s limp form, and shouting something across the deck. Dean squinted into the rain to try to make it out.
Dean’s voice carries across the foyer over the hubbub of the bustling people. Castiel’s sure he’d be able to pick him out of a stadium crowd if he had to. “Yep, that’ll be great. And make sure you guys bring some of that eggnog again—that shit is amazing,” Dean says, his face lighting up even further as he looks around for Castiel, obviously sensing him as Castiel had just done.
The girl snarls as her companion falls, and she steps over him and lunges towards Dean, knife extended. Gritting his teeth, he fires, stopping her in her tracks with a bullet between her eyes.
“Hey, now,” Dean said quietly, reaching to grasp Castiel’s hand as it rose through the air, beginning a sweeping gesture of disbelief. “Do
"God, I’ve been an idiot,” Dean sighs, speaking between kisses. He’s addicted to all things Cas, had literally felt off-balance in the time they spent apart, and he’s kicking himself mentally for not going to him the moment he wanted to.
“It’s just water, man,” Dean told Cas with a chuckle. He mimed drinking, watching as Cas tilted his head in what looked like complete confusion. That...was pretty endearing, Dean had to admit. This guy must have been somebody to someone, he was sure—the guy was built, his shoulders filling out the trenchcoat, and the swell of muscle along his legs was doing things to Dean that he’d rather not admit. Even though the guy had just been washed up by the sea, his hair was perfectly tousled, and his grey eyes were warm. He looked exhausted, though.
“Who are these new arrivals, to hold the room in such a thrall?” Lady Antonia asked him as they walked forward.
Dean closes his fist around the amulet, feeling the way Castiel’s magic buzzes within it, stirring his own in response. At the Grove, their batteries will be larger ingots of bronze or steel capable of storing enough magic to power the city. But this one, Dean will get to keep. Replacing the amulet around his neck, Dean thanks the supervisors and leaves the room, Castiel by his side.
Like most days when he’s daydreaming about sex, he has no idea he’s projecting his lust and need and fantasies into Cas’ subconscious until the evidence is pressed up,
Dean hummed in agreement as they lost themselves in each other all over again. Eventually, Castiel slid to one side, his head back on his pillow but tucked into Dean’s side.
Everything is about to change. God, what he wouldn’t give to put Charlie and Sam on a spaceship headed to fucking space right about now. Anything, really, over letting Crowley drag them into the eye of the storm.
“What do you think, halibut? Keeping an eye on your sorry tail!” his brother said, scowling at him as he ventured closer to shore.
Then his front door cracks open, and a soggy Castiel wearing Dean’s sweatshirt comes in holding two coffees from the Witches’ Brew. “Oh good, you’re up,” Castiel says lightly, shutting the door with his foot and kissing Dean’s cheek. He seems to have not noticed yet Dean’s expression of panic, to relief, to lingering fear, and he drops their to-go cups on the kitchen table. “They were out of bagels, can you believe that? Of course, I had to go to the off-campus one, because… Well anyways, this location always sells out of everything so fast, even though it’s barely nine in the morning—”
“You cruel man,” Dean teased, breathless and boneless as he lay atop Castiel—held in place then by both of Castiel’s large palms on his thighs.
Charlie’s face takes on a look of disbelief. "Really? Then why is he hanging around in your apartment with
Lud, he looked beautiful. Dean suspected that Charlie was wholly responsible for Castiel’s outfit—it looked as new as Dean’s, crisp and sleek across his chest and arms, a tailcoat with brocade beneath that almost matched Dean’s, but for the color being a stunning celestial blue. Dean shouldn’t take the lord’s name in vain within his own house, but as long as he only
Castiel smiles, slightly sheepishly. He'd also been surprised by the amount of snow that fell during the night. "My Uber driver was telling me about the weird weather on the way over earlier. It's not quite the whole state, but certainly spread along the coast from here, quite a way."
Sam is still asleep when Dean and Castiel let themselves into the annexe. Castiel quickly crosses to the kitchenette to fill a glass with water, rinsing the taste of sick from his mouth.
He feels their affinity buzzing like high-voltage electricity, the skin-to-skin contact making their energies swirl and combine. It’s like a burst of energizing lay magic mixed in with the most amazing kisses he’s ever experienced, and the whole thing is intoxicating as hell. Like eating apple pie on vacation, or listening to Zeppelin while driving down backroads. Kissing Cas is pure bliss, and now that he’s had a taste, he’s not sure he’ll ever be able to stop.
He takes a breath and turns away from the window, taking in Dean sitting on the floor, his legs crossed. The lurch in his chest at seeing him sitting there has little to do with the spell he just cast, and a lot to do with the fact that he still can’t quite believe that Dean has actually both shown up and agreed to cast a spell with him. He was almost sure after the night at the library that Dean would not be willing to forgive him. But here he is.
“Of course.” Castiel stepped aside, intrigued. He’d wondered if Miss Hannah had a change of heart, after what she’d said to him at Charlie’s ball, but to visit unaccompanied was highly irregular. This must be a dire matter indeed.
He stares down at the paper for a few moments, trying to refocus on the topic for this set of grading, but none of the words are making sense. His magic is rising, buzzing with Dean's proximity.
“Thanks,” he says evenly. He looks at Layla then and offers her a fifty-watt smile—which she returns in spades. The rest of the group begins chattering again, and Dean’s happy to have the attention off him finally. “How come it affected me more than you guys?”
“Yes,” he says, then lets his gaze slowly travel up again, his lip caught between his teeth, “but I can think of a few other things I’d rather do.”
The living area at the back of the building is open-plan and high-ceilinged. Behind the Christmas tree, huge glass windows dominate the wall, revealing a breathtaking view over the town. The sky over it all is slashed with a deep orange sunset.
"Oh.” Castiel can hear Dean fiddling with the empty cup, tapping at it. “So are you still together? She doesn’t live around here?"
Castiel dressed in fresh breeches and re-tied his cravat, trying hard not to rub or scratch at the abominably itchy skin around his new tattoo. He called the valet in to help him finish dressing in one of Michael’s blue tailcoats and his own black boots before he hurried downstairs to meet his partner.
Sam returns with fresh beers and talk turns to other matters for a while, until Sam gets a text and heads out to meet up with Ruby.
He's definitely going to have to chat with Missouri to get Dean's project sorted so they can cast together more often. Because that feeling of staring into Dean's eyes while casting had been incredible, and he wants more.
They spend the rest of the afternoon drinking, chatting, and exchanging gifts. Dean watches Charlie unwrap her limited edition
“It’s just a scratch,” Cas replies stubbornly, waving him off. “Besides—when did you learn a healing spell? They only teach medical magic at the PhD level.”
Dean observed Castiel biting back an odd expression before he managed a polite smile. Once Andrews had departed, Dean couldn’t help but smirk over at Castiel as he began to unbutton his waistcoat. “You’re still not quite used to that, I see.”
“I’m inviting you. Come down off your high horse, Sammy. I had enough of that pomp in London all Season—we’re knee deep in mud and sheep out here, relax a little.”
“I don’t, actually,” Castiel mumbles gently, and he opens his mouth as if he wants to say something more but is uncertain. Dean leans forward, clinging to his every word. “Around you, I find myself doing and feeling…saying things that…I…” He licks his lips and Dean follows the movement, heart beat practically in his throat. “Forgive me. I’m not sure what I’m trying to say.”
He didn’t know how much time they’d have; he wanted to make the most of the time they had. Neither of them were fools, and though they didn’t much speak of it, they knew they were on borrowed time before life inevitably pulled them apart.
“Well I don’t,” Dean snaps, trying to rein in his irritation. They’ve just reconciled and he doesn’t want to ruin it, but seriously, does Ruby have a magic vagina or something? What is up with Sam’s infatuation with her?
“Yeah, Sam mentioned that this afternoon,” Dean agrees, his voice quiet and nearly carried away by the breeze.
“Whatever,” Dean says, rolling his eyes. He turns back to the path ahead of them, as the imposing facade of Strong Hall looms above them. Dean leads Cas through the foyer area and through the wards, and the warlock world springs into being around them. Demons hurry along beside their warlocks, infernals stand guard outside doors, and the magic that is muted by necessity in the outside world runs freely through the building, always making Dean’s body hum. He’s always enjoyed the feeling of being here, feeling the magical pulse of the world. He’d never felt that when stepping into the Grove’s headquarters, Downtown.
“He’s onto me about going to...to Grandport or something, to study to be a law man. I’ve told him over and over, he needs to find himself a nice girl, settle her down in town and get his head in the game!”
Dean’s cheeks burn pink, quickly cataloging all the embarrassing things he said in bed earlier. He opens his mouth to give a suggestive retort, but Cas is already frowning down at his phone again, lost in thought. “Hey, not fair. You can’t flirt with me and then ignore me!”
Castiel leads him away between two tents, and then behind a small hut with a locked door—probably somewhere for groundskeepers to store equipment, Dean guesses. Behind the hut is a small clear area, surrounded by high bushes and oak trees towering overhead, making a green kind of bubble. The sounds of the festival are muted, although still audible through the foliage surrounding them. The ground is scattered with trash, a few cigarette butts and soda cans against the wall.
Castiel doesn’t answer, but instead, after he’s free of the shirt, pushes Dean until he’s lying on his back on the bed. He methodically applies his mouth to Dean’s jaw, his neck, his shoulder, and onwards. Dean lets Castiel’s magic flow, enjoying his thunderstorm scent and his hot, talented lips and tongue as they explore his skin. He gasps as a scorching tongue licks over the crease of his hip, as deft fingers loosen his belt and jeans button. He gasps a second time as strong hands grab him and flip him over. He has to admit, the manhandling is freaking hot as fuck, but he still flinches when Cas yanks on his jeans, exposing his ass to the cool air. He doesn’t realize how clenched tight he is, until Cas places kisses all over his lower back, then moves down to a butt cheek. The tongue is next, driving him crazy with the tingling feeling over his hypersensitive skin, but when Cas licks up his butt crack, he actually yelps in surprise.
The other guy—Dean, he’d said his name was, right?—shifts impatiently. “What’re you waiting for? C’mon, I can help.”
His kitchen is small but neat, his couch gently ruffled and likely bought secondhand, his bedroom adorned in navy blue curtains. Surely no one could blame her for snooping—it’s been years since she’s spoken with her younger brother, the summer before he left for Oxford. After that, she’d dropped in on him over the years, holidays he spent with their parents in Illinois, weekend trips with Gabriel. She had even checked in on him during grad school, when her search for resources had taken her to England, the home of the strongest lay magician community in the world. The things she had learned during her travels had been invaluable, but she made sure Castiel never saw her there…or
Dean chuckles, trying to keep his guilt under wraps. The old man would sniff him out in a second if he let on. "Yeah, somethin' like that."
“Take your pants off,” he says, almost as if he’s asking Dean to pass him the remote or fetch him a glass of water. He’s still trying to feign disinterest, but Dean knows better—he can feel the prod of a half-hard cock against his cheek.
As they move forwards through the crowd standing with their drinks, Castiel notices a shifting pattern across the wall behind the bar. It only changes when he's not directly looking at it, but it changes from a deep blue to a forest green, then while he glances away, it becomes an actual forest, with trees and bushes and sunlight filtering through leaves. He could be mistaken but it looks more like a magical illusion than a screen of any kind.
Castiel’s heart rate has calmed somewhat, but he can still feel the fatigue from casting heavy in his limbs. Dean looks so expectant though, that he can’t delay any longer. He wipes the sheen of sweat from his brow, then raises his hands. “Maybe try a different charm this time? It’s getting a little hot in here, don’t you think?”
"Huh," Cas says, closing the front door against the rainy evening, and follows the cat as it checks out each room of the apartment in turn—the living room, the kitchen, and down the hall to the bedrooms and bathroom. It pads back into the living room and stops on the carpet in front of the radiator, where it sits down and starts to clean its wet fur.
Dean’s first reaction had been a complete rejection of the idea. They’re gonna get caught. This area is protected by all sorts of wardings and spells, he was sure there was no way they’d be able to cast anything without Grove security coming down on them like a ton of bricks. But Charlie had been confident.
Dean couldn’t help but grin as he slapped Castiel on the shoulder. “Enough, from us both, I think. Let’s move this poor lady out behind the mausoleum, so that no unexpecting partygoers will trip over her.”
Castiel nods, sympathetically. “You’ve been running for a long time, Dean. You’re allowed to rest now.”
Dean laughs, and Castiel loves the sound of it. He shrugs one shoulder, moving his hand near the amulet. “I can’t sense it at all. But I literally bound my magic to it, so I guess it must have worked.” He looks back up at Castiel. “Merry Christmas,” he adds with a smile.
—be that teacher who gets romantically involved with his students. Even if the student is obviously interested enough in him to look him up in the academic catalog.
Dean scolds, “Claire!” but it’s too late—Cas appears in the entry hall behind Jack. Dean almost forgets to breathe as he takes in Cas' soft navy sweater, the fitted jeans hugging thighs...
Dean barely has time to process the words before Castiel drops his hands and wraps his arms around Dean’s neck. He pulls Dean into kiss that leaves him so breathless, Charlie eventually shoos them away so “a girl can kiss her own girlfriend, already.”
“Okay!” he called back, surprising himself once again by how his voice sounded. He quickly stood up, already missing the warmth of the water, and stepped out onto the cold floor. He wiped off the water with a large piece of fabric hanging on a hook behind the door, then quickly replaced his coat and satchel before opening the door to find Dean standing there, leaning against the wall next to the door.
Dean's sure he hears Castiel mutter, "Gotta be fucking kidding…" as he gets back to his feet. Louder, he says, "Dean? Get up, quickly." Castiel grabs him under one shoulder and helps him up.
Grimacing, he caught his breath for a few moments, then bent quickly to mop up the mess with the linen. He hoped it wouldn't be too obvious once it dried, although in a gentlemen's boarding house, he was sure this room must see its share of action.
Castiel gave a bitter little laugh, and Dean’s eyes rose again to see him shake his head. “I assure you, Dean is capable of finding his own good evening.”
Bobby paused, looking at each of them in turn before he continued. “I know that I threw the both of you into this case, when perhaps you weren’t quite ready to have a new partner, Dean. You each expressed that you were reluctant to work with the other, and yet you’ve each proven yourselves in this case.” He paused to sip at his tea. “I’d like to offer you both the option of taking on one of our newer recruits, such as Monsieur Roche, perhaps? Or you could act as chaperone on a training case with the young Miss Rosen.”
Castiel sank to the sand, the broken pieces of his heart settling like the shattered treasure around him.
Dean looks relieved. "Oh, good. 'Cause, I mean…it'll really help to be able to see the spells, I guess." He rubs the back of his neck with one hand, and Castiel has to admit, he knows just how Dean's feeling. He wouldn't want to give up their dual casting either, not after discovering their affinity. He smiles and remembers the electrifying feeling of their combined magic rushing through him.
He'd had a stern word with Krissy, and had left the lesson doubting his own teaching ability, and that anxiety had followed him into the week. The only bright spot had been his phone conversation with Dean mid-week—a rather arousing memory that he then had to suppress during a busy day of exams on Thursday.
“Yes, I heard you were looking for me,” Castiel replies, a little tersely, and Dean wonders what Cas has witnessed up until this point. Will they even get a chance to fill each other in—not to mention Anna and Charlie and the coven—without Rosco eavesdropping?
Then Dean feels the familiar rub of carpet beneath him, an uncomfortable burn on his elbows. He blinks, taking in the cream-colored walls, the doors up and down the hallway. Like a few weeks ago, when the dragons had gotten them, the illusion’s been broken and they’re back where they started…staring down at the white door, on the other side of it now.
Cas rolls his eyes. “No need to get shitty with me. Why the urgency if you don’t even know what’s happening?”
Before Dean could open his mouth, Balthazar barreled onwards. “I jest, I jest. Of course I know that you Men of Letters always travel together. I am merely in a playful mood this fine evening, Monsieur! In fact, I already have my eye on some lovely offerings for you both, inside.”
As Dean stirs chocolate chips into the heated milk, letting them melt slowly, his mind wanders back to some of the drawings Claire had produced in those early days. Lots of frowns and dark colors, scary monsters, among the occasional Elsa and Olaf. But more recently, Dean has been pleased to see smiles returning, and a load more unicorns and "badass robots" (her words—the original animated
Inias nods, obviously fascinated, but just as he’s about to say something, Crowley stands up from the side of the room where he’d been observing and says, “Well, thank you for the very informative lesson tonight, Doctor Novak, but I’m afraid that’s all we have time for. Next week, everyone?”
"Sure," Dean laughs, tapping at his phone again. "Damn, none of the photos I took are here." He pulls the notebook out next, shaking his head at the empty pages. "So, we going back in?"
“The ball has more gentlemen than ladies.” Dean couldn’t help but give a tiny, selfish grin. Yes, they had a mission for the evening, even if they were still unclear what that was. But...it was also a ball, where they must blend in.
“No,” he grits out, his voice harsh, raw. He seems to steel himself, sounding firmer as he continues, “No, Crowley. I don't know anything about the wards, and even if I did, I'm sworn to—ahhh!” He throws his head back in a scream as the boss clenches his hand into a fist, a deep scowl on his face. After a few seconds, he releases it, and the professor slumps back down, long, gulping sobs wracking his frame.
Dean nods, still obviously annoyed. "And witches. I hoped we could get there well before now, but you dragged your feet with the whole Palpatine thing—" he extends his hands, fingers crooked, "—so if you could just find me some pants, that'd be great."
The demon eyes the beer, before he flicks his gaze back up to Dean’s. “I do not require human food or drink.”
“You’ll regret that,” Castiel says threateningly, and then his hands are flying, casting quickly, and a much larger wave comes straight for Dean’s head. The impact of the water is so powerful it knocks him off his feet, sputtering as salt water seeps into his mouth, jacket drenched.
“Don’t you want to go back to how you were before these men came to ruin your life?” Azazel tries again.
“Fuck, no, I wouldn’t…we couldn’t…” He removes his hands, his eyes blinking, moisture slipping out the corners of his eyes. “I couldn’t risk that, not even to save magic, Cas.”
Rubbing one hand over his face, he heads up the stairs, then puts his hands into his coat pockets as he walks along the lane towards where his truck is parked.
The Captain hesitates, turning to seek out Castiel. “I’m not actually sure you will, Hester. Doctor Novak, can you suggest whether we’ll feel any effect?”
“It’s an acquired taste. But she’s really very sweet, would you mind…?” Castiel looks down at his leaking cock, held loosely in Dean’s fist, and mutters, “You’re dressed, and I can’t exactly answer the door like this, honey.”
“You listenin’ to me, boy?” Ellen asks, and Dean scrubs a hand against his face, shaken from his thoughts.
Their arrival makes things a party, and soon there’s music playing and gifts changing hands, and Castiel is surrounded by more friends than he has been in years. It’s a wonderful feeling, despite the still-simmering hostility between Dean and Meg, thankfully quiet for now.
Castiel smiles. It might be nice to spend a bit of time with Dean outside of meetings, especially if they're going to start over. "Thanks, Dean. I'd like that."
"Nah," Claire says, taking the snack box and stashing it in her bag. "I've shared cookies with him before. See ya, Dad!"
Castiel steps back towards him, his expression anguished. "I have loved you for years, longer than I should have. I tried not to, I did, but that day…I had to know. And it was so good, Dean. It was everything I had dreamed of, and everything I could never have." He took a shuddering breath in, then released it. “So I ran.”
“Crowley-only access,” Dean finishes, focusing again and feeling sick to his stomach. There’s absolutely no part of this that doesn’t really fucking suck.
Castiel risks a few steps forward, wondering how intelligent the illusion has made the creatures inside it. “We’re not going to hurt you,” he says, gently.
“Well he can go to hell!” Dean bit out, immediately adding, “He cannot make me do this, Cas. Especially not after...not after this summer.”
He takes his time over at the coffee pot, pouring the brew clumsily into a mug and taking a sip before finally mumbling, “So, uh, Cas and I are together.”
Castiel’s nod was slow in coming, but everything in Dean’s chest finally began to relax when he saw it.
He watches her hand motions as she casts the charm—she makes two circles on either hand, connecting thumb and ring finger, and rotates them twice at a ninety degree angle. Once it’s cast, she runs a hand through his hair slowly.
He swipes at the notification on his screen, practically counting the seconds until his inbox fully downloads. And then, he reads:
Dean mumbles, “Jeez, Cas.” Castiel dares a peek at him to see him still flushed and looking down, but a small smile is playing on his lips. He didn’t mean to embarrass Dean like that, but it’s only the truth.
They walked a little further, turning onto a perpendicular path around the back of the large flower bed. It had been some time since Castiel had the opportunity to discuss novels with a friend, and the warm glow in his chest wasn’t only a result of the sunshine and the punch. Charlie’s mention of her friends reminded him of a thought he’d had the last time they’d visited the Tea Room, though.
“I’ll take these down the laundry for an extra good brushin’ then, Sir,” Phillip suggested, “if you’re sure you’ll be alright.”
Balthazar stood off to their hostess’ side, staring. His mouth was slightly open, his face pale. His hand, though, was hovering at his belt, uncertain. A good sign. Perhaps the Frenchman could be relied upon after all.
Charred remains are all that remain of the labels Dean pulls up with the remaining jars, but Cas is able to identify some of the seeds by shape, some even by smell.
Dean knew that Benny was teasing him, but he knew what he'd seen. That merman was out there, and he’d keep heading out to the far fishery until he caught another glimpse. The sight had been replaying itself in his head all day.
Of course, Dean wanted to see Castiel healthy again, more than anything. But he couldn’t lie to himself; selfishly, he wanted Castiel well so that they could be together as much as possible, away from the town on Castiel’s days off and hours after closing, hidden from prying eyes when Dean could slip away from his father and Sam.
“Where they’d go?” Dean demands, heart pounding in his ears, not believing he can even manage to form words at this point.
He sounded so fearful that Dean’s heart broke, and it was all he could do to cling on tighter to Castiel’s fingers and not raise his hand up, not cup his cheek, not press his fingers under his jaw, not rub a thumb under his haunted eyes. Because, Dean knew somehow, that if he did that, he was done. If he touched Castiel’s face, comforted him in the way that he wanted to, so intimately…there was no coming back from that.
Castiel closes his eyes, conjuring up a mental image of Dean standing close like they’d been this afternoon. Dean reaches out and runs the fingers of one large hand down Castiel’s chest, where he’s touching his own skin. He gasps as he finds a nipple, shocks rippling over his skin.
“I can make some more tea,” Castiel says, moving to get up, but Dean stops him with a hand on his arm.
, Cas wasn’t kidding about those wards draining their energy. Dean couldn’t summon his fork to him right now, he’s so tapped out.
As he’d begin reciting the Latin, the demon flinched, cowering behind Dean’s arms as it held them up. As Castiel reached partway into the prayer, though, the flames finally flickered out.
Dean walks home in a daze, head swimming, analyzing everything that’s transpired today—getting past the Seal, kissing Cas and enjoying it way more than he should, realizing the cameras had caught the whole damn thing… What the hell are they gonna do now? Can they alter the footage without anyone noticing?
"For what it's worth? You should keep tryin'." He winks at Dean before Castiel calls their attention to the front, and Dean spends the rest of the class wondering whether Benny has seen something that Dean hasn't, or if Cas has said something to him.
The two men are chatting indistinctly, peering together in concentration, and Dean overhears how they don’t know how to set the timer on his oven. Good—hopefully that’ll distract them long enough for him to grab some clothes and make his escape. But when he takes a single step, his creaky hardwood floors give him away, and both men spin around curiously.
Helplessness washed over him as Ellen left and he closed the door, bringing the laundry inside. He was going to have to find some other way to earn some money in the meantime, but how? Now that he was feeling less like throwing up every time he got to his feet, he was a little more mobile. The idea of visiting town, where everyone could point at the guy whose ship was lost in a storm, made the back of his throat burn…but he had to do something. Had to get out of the house.
His cheeks burning humiliation red, Castiel’s eyes turned back to the ground. “Then you know that I am weak, and feeble.”
Frowning down at the mess of hemp tufts covering the table, he picked up the rope once again. He shoved the long, hollow splicing fid through the rope strands roughly, threading the rope end through and pulling tight.
“Amelia?” Castiel only knew of her from his fishing group, but she hardly spoke to anyone there, preferring to keep to herself. “What are you doing here?”
“Take care of yourself, Jess. Don’t worry about school right now—you’ve got the highest marks of anyone in the class, and I’m willing to bet you’re doing just as well in your other courses, too.” Even under the circumstances, his student blushes a little and nods, confirming Dean’s theory. “Your professors will understand.”
Dean raps on the door, making it rattle in its frame.  A trailing vine has wound itself along the front face, around the doorway.
Castiel saw Dean leave the ballroom from the corner of his eye—how could he not have? This whole wretched evening he’d been aware of Dean’s presence, like a torch burning brightly in his periphery. The horror of dancing, together but separately, their eyes meeting again and again...it was some of the worst torture Castiel believed he’d ever been subjected to.
Castiel stilled his hand, pulling back from Dean to look him in the eye. “Are you sure, Dean? We do not have to—”
Castiel watches him go. He should follow him, make sure he's okay, but when his eyes return to Meg, the anger wins out.
Castiel turns back to the book. “No, there are other signs. Are you able to tell when I’m nearby? I don’t know, Dean, the further away I am from you, it’s like I’m being pulled towards you, just here.” He puts his closed fist on his chest, watching Dean’s look of surprise. “The fact that we made it snow in California—”
But he’s finding it difficult. Especially when Dean smiles at him in the way he is right now—like he’s the only person in the universe.
he’d enthused. Castiel had bit his tongue at that comment—he’d never thought much of Dean’s father, based on the stories he and Sam had told. In any case, this was the first time he’d got a good look at Dean like this in a few weeks. The jacket showed off the work Dean had been doing in the school gym, and... Charlie was waving a hand in front of his eyes. He blinked and turned to look into her incredulous face.
Dean cringes, sure that he’s blown at least part of the classroom they’re using for this examination apart. He’s about to get thrown out of the school, in a big way. Whichever way it’s happened, he’s done it after all, thank fuck.
He'd shown Cas the wardrobe full of clothes last night, and told him to take whatever he liked out of there to wear. It was mostly old clothes of Sam's, but Dean had no idea there were some old clothes of his
Sam grimaces. “You’re going to lose control. Probably a lot. Familiars help to channel magic from the world around us. Without Dean there, you could start wrecking stuff.”
Castiel’s heart expands, as all his love and gratitude for this man fill him. So much is uncertain right now, but at least Dean is with him. He smiles gratefully at him, sending his thanks through a lingering touch to Dean’s arm.
"Shh," Castiel hushed him as he moved further down, kissing along Dean's clavicle and tasting his pectoral, licking his pert nipple and enjoying his throaty gasp. He continued downwards, nuzzling the softer flesh around Dean's middle, then the jut of a hip bone.
By the middle of November, Dean and his students all seem to be in a holiday mindset, counting down until Thanksgiving. Dean is especially distracted today, since Benny texted him an hour ago and he learned that his old, Louisianian flame will be visiting Palo Alto for turkey day. He’s excited to see his friend after several months of missed phone calls, but he’s also aware that
An hour later, Dean pushes open the buzzing door of a non-descript apartment block, taking the stairs with shopping bags in hand. When he reaches the second floor, Cas is standing at an open door down the hallway, a wide smile on his face.
Castiel’s concern ratchets up as he takes in the defeat in Dean’s face, his slumped posture. “What does he want? And how is he able to—”
“Sure.” Charlie turns to regard him for a moment, a frown on her usually perky face. “That’s not what it looked like just now in the kitchen, but whatever, keep your secrets.”
Castiel nearly chokes on the sip of whiskey he's just taken. "Excuse me? As I recall, you were the one who called me a dick."
They've just spent close to an hour driving along a dirt road through a forest, stopping for a break only so that Dean could call Bobby to make sure they were going the right way. The RV is parked off the side of the track, nestled into the trees enough that if Dean hadn't yelled out and Cas slammed on the brakes in alarm, they might have driven right past it.
“We caught a demon, Bobby,” Dean said, without hesitation. Castiel glanced at Mrs. Moseley, but she merely raised one eyebrow in surprise.
“I can’t think of a better way to go,” Dean says flirtily, leaning over Cas’ chest and licking a flat tongue over his nipple. Cas hums, entwining his fingers into Dean’s hair and angling his head up to kiss him deeply. Dean goes willingly, wondering if Cas can taste his own salty precome on Dean’s tongue. A few minutes later, he goes to the corner of the room, searching for his bag. Cas whines impatiently until he returns.
Naomi stared at him, clearly horrified. “Listen to yourself! You’re talking nonsense— you know contact with humans is forbidden. They’re dangerous, uncivilized thugs who’d kill you as soon as look at you.”
Three hours later, he's almost finished the bottle of wine and the shelves are full. One more box remains with a few trinkets and photos, and he opens it and catches his breath when he pulls out a photo in a black frame. He and Meg sit at a table in the Eagle and Child, one of Oxford's most famous pubs. Castiel's arm is around her, and she's leaning her head on his shoulder, smiling. He can't even remember who took it or what the occasion was, but he suddenly misses her. She’s always been his rock when things get rocky in his life.
“How much is the increase?” Dean tried not to snap, but from the way Christian paused, turning to look at him with a raised eyebrow, he didn’t entirely succeed. “Just out of curiosity, of course.”
Cas had the smallest smile on his face, that Dean knew meant contentment. “You can’t distract me from this crisis with kisses and TV, you know.”
Dean wasn’t, however, a good enough man that he could resist a whisper as he pressed past Castiel in the corridor. “Her name is Jo Harvelle, m’lord. You know, in case it comes up in conversation.”
“You guess correctly,” Crowley says, with a wave of his hand. “I would ask your name, but it seems your brother and your lover introduced you just fine.” He turns to Castiel, an overly dramatic frown deepening on his face. “Trouble in paradise, darling?”
Rosco shrugs off his coat when he enters the foyer, heading straight into the security office on the ground floor. He’s pissed at being woken up by this dumb alarm—it’s been months since it went off the last time, and that had actually been someone breaking in. That meddlesome kid, Adam—he’d made short work of him in the end. It doesn’t pay to get on Crowley’s bad side, after all.
“Fuck,” he mutters miserably. Guy tries to join an underground resistance movement, and his personal life immediately suffers for it.
Then, to spare himself further humiliation (because Castiel must, surely, have been able to name Dean’s oddness by now), Dean pushed up off the bench and strode quickly from the room.
Castiel stepped forward now, determined to bring this discussion to a close before Naomi stumbled into a truth that could get them in far deeper trouble. “Mrs Tapping, clearly Mister Winchester has some information that could hurt your family. I do not wish for that to be made public, but neither do I intend to leave this town. I hope that you will allow me to continue living in the place my uncle left to me. Do we have an understanding?”
“I can’t remember how to transition from fourth to first,” a student admits, and a few others nod their heads. Adler is standing close by and perks up to attention, facing Dean with an energized smirk.
If only they could stay here, relaxing side by side, enjoying the flow of pure magic as it swirls around and down towards the maze…
Dean takes a deep breath, holding it in for a few seconds. It's now or never, and there's no failing out this time. Letting the breath out on a chuckle, he rubs the back of his neck before dropping his hand back into his lap.
Castiel led his companion around the dance floor close to the royal seat, but as they passed by the gaggle of people around Her Majesty, Castiel found himself face to face with Dean, coming the other way.
He had to do this, for the good of the country—for the world, even. But his heart ached, like a knife was already stuck through. How could he be expected to kill the man he loved, even if it would rid them of one demon among many? Just like Dean had been forced to kill Benny?
“C’mon, you know you want a snow day mimosa,” she says, eyebrows raised. Dean rolls his eyes, planning to stick to coffee, thank you very much. Charlie’s instantly at home in his kitchen, pulling the orange juice out of the fridge and mixing herself a drink. Then she slides onto the kitchen counter, practically beaming, and Dean grumbles out, “What?”
Relief flows through his tense limbs. Nothing to do with the resistance, then. “Oh? Between some of my students?”
Sam cleared his throat lightly. “Charlie, would you show me the books you’ve told me so much about?”
He’d had no inkling that Michael had been involved in any kind of society, let alone a secret monster-hunting one, and frankly, he was disinclined to believe in any of it until he was faced with one of these creatures himself. But his acceptance of the position meant that he was exempt from having to sit in the House of Lords, an idea that was particularly appealing. Castiel was a man who preferred actions to words.
“Excuse me? Hi,” he says, smiling disarmingly. “Your, uh…’All You Can Eat’ thing is on tonight, right?”
He isn’t sure what he expects to find here tonight, but nothing remains of the ritual he and Cas performed. The grass is smooth and even, gray in the dim glow of the lights around the edge of the clearing.
Dean startles, sitting up straight in his chair. He hadn't even heard the door open. He mutters, “I need to put some kind of bell on you.”
“Ever lost anyone?” he asks, trying to get the focus off of him for a minute. Castiel chews the question over as if it’s a difficult one, though it’s very black and white in Dean’s opinion.
Naomi shook her head, turning her attention to Gabriel and pointing a sharp-pointed finger at him. “You were supposed to be watching him.”
Grasping Castiel by two handfuls of his vest, he lifted him and slammed him against the wall, knocking a pained yell and a huff of breath from Castiel’s lungs. Again and again, he spun Castiel around, bashing him from wall to wall like a ball in a game of Bagatelle. Castiel’s arms flailed, and the blunderbuss on its strap over his arm smacked against the wall beside him.
“Well, I doubt it could ever truly be level. We might not have to rely on lay magic anymore to cast spells, but we still have no resources—no access to education,” Anna points out. After everything she’s been through—forming the resistance group, assembling her own coven, making deals with Crowley and Rowena and nearly dying from them—nothing had prepared her for the aftermath. There’s no clear path for the next step towards equal rights, and she feels a little lost right now, wondering what her future will look like.
“Yeah, I roadtrip with Sam most summers. Just pile into the car with duffle bags and a cooler of beer. We sleep in Baby, or get cheap-ass hotel rooms, and see how far we can get.” He smiles, wistfully recalling their last trip to Lake Tahoe. “Sometimes we camp, though it took a while to get used to the no-fire rule around here.”
“Because,” Cas says firmly, still looking uncomfortable, “I need your help. The magic in Demonside is disappearing. Warlocks are taking too much, pulling too many of my kind through to this realm.” Cas sits forward, looking more animated than Dean has seen in him so far. “I was sent through to speak to the warlock leaders about this. I couldn’t come through alone—to stay in this realm and speak to them, I need to be bound to a warlock. You are powerful, your soul is bright and your magic pure.”
“Dean, I was literally inside of you—” Castiel makes a show of checking the time on his phone. “Three hours ago.”
Castiel bristled at his words—of course he’d noticed that Dean’s legs bowed outwards slightly at the knees, but he would never be so impolite as to mention it to anyone.
Tentatively raising one hand, he brushed his fingertips down the side of Dean’s face, taking in the way Dean drew in a sharp breath, his lips parted. His fingers trailed down over the coarse hair on his jaw to the smooth skin below Dean’s neck, the lack of gills strange. Castiel held Dean’s eyes as he moved his hand around the back of his neck. Gripping lightly, he drew Dean close enough to feel his exhale against his own lips. The evening narrowed to just to two of them, drifting on the water, the fireflies dancing in the air around them.
Castiel toes off his boots and strips off his sweatshirt, down to jeans and t-shirt, and Dean soaks up the view of all this untouched skin. Leading Cas to his bed feels significant, and he has to will Little Dean to calm the hell down and remember they’re just supposed to be cuddling and talking, that’s it. Castiel scoots back onto the mattress, appreciating Dean’s memory foam with a pleasant sigh, and Dean falls onto the other side of the bed. His head cradles itself onto Cas’ chest, arms wrapping around him from behind, and he’s not sure he’s ever quite so warm and content in his entire life.
No, he has to be imagining it. He is, isn’t he? He’s sure Dean had mentioned "ladies" the other day at Bobby’s. It’s been a while since he’s thought of anyone in that way, and the sudden draw towards Dean is unexpected.
Cas merely frowns at him, which Dean has to admit is kind of adorable, even with the demonic eyes and the now almost blinding energy surrounding him. Dean’s smile falters as he takes in Cas’ magical energy, like he’s basking in the sun.
Dean falls back to put his arm around Charlie as they continue towards the D. "Yeah, all right, Sammy. We’ll call for help when we get there, okay?"
Dean smiles, then reaches out to squeeze Cas’ forearm briefly. “Thank you. We appreciate that.” He watches as Cas’ lips part, as though he’s drawing in a silent gasp at Dean’s touch. How long has it been…? “As soon as Sam’s back on his feet we’ll get out of your way, though.”
Cursing under his breath, he shuts the laptop and heads out into the corridor, wondering what Missouri could be after, and why she couldn’t just email him. His thoughts flick to Dean, hoping his latest canvassing trip with the coven is going well—now that his thesis is completed, Dean suddenly has more free time on his hands, and he’s been spending more of it with Anna and her magicians while Castiel is busy at work. He hopes no word of the lay magician’s “resistance” has reached the university—especially not his involvement, or that of Dean or Sam.
“You know what I mean,” Gabriel says, an implication in his voice that Dean clearly isn’t getting. “Did you and Cassie bond before, or after, you boned?”
“Oh please, Lucy,” Becky interrupted. “I’m certain Lord Milton is used to all sorts of extravagant parties, are you not, sir? I’m sure you’re visiting all the clubs and assembly rooms, although soon it will be just too far into the summer for dancing to be comfortable, wouldn’t you agree?”
“Winchester,” he was greeted warmly enough once he caught up to him. “I didn’t get to talk to you much before—that Bevell woman sure can talk, eh? How do you do? Fine turn out for the afternoon.”
“Now you’re shy?” Cas asks, running his hand over the top of Claire’s fluffy hair and sharing a smile with Dean. “Okay, let’s go. I’ll be right back,” he adds over his shoulder as he turns to head into Claire's room.
At Castiel’s nod, he hands the notepad over and Castiel sketches the message as best as he can remember onto the now-blank page while Dean find’s Sam’s contact.
He’s purposely arriving late, hoping that he won’t be noticed slipping into the back of the theater after the keynote speech is over, and thankfully he arrives just as the speaker leaves the stage to loud applause. Castiel isn’t sure who the older gentleman was, but the audience has an excited buzz about it that covers Castiel as he finds an empty seat at the back of the hall.
In front of him, across the Well and outside of the protective warding, Sam is squaring up with Crowley. Anna, Charlie, and Dr. MacLeod watch from a short distance away, Anna swaying on her feet and holding one arm to her stomach. While Charlie looks terrified, Dr. MacLeod looks mostly confused—Castiel is desperate to find out exactly what her connection to Anna is, but he remembers Anna saying something a few days ago in that orchard about “protections no longer being an issue.” If Rowena has been easing their way, it explains how they got onto campus in the first place, not to mention into the library.
. Looking pleased with his choice, Cas slumped down into a chair, breathing out a sigh as he did so.
“Aaron!” Dean said, obviously delighted to see this man. They wrapped each other in a warm embrace and patted each other's backs, then Dean glanced back to beckon Castiel over. “Come on, Cas. Mister Aaron Bass, this is my colleague, Lord Milton.”
Dean’s hands went subtly within his jacket, his fingers checking over the weapons within it while he was disguised in the crowd. From the corner of his eye, he could see Castiel smoothing his jacket down, no doubt doing the same nervous checks that Dean had begun.
“Well, luckily, I’m a package deal,” Dean says with a grin, throwing his hands up nonchalantly before taking a large gulp of his drink. “You’ll have these weirdos knocking down your door in no time.”
