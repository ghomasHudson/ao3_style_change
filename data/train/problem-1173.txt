"I got ferociously sick of my hands smelling of garlic," Sherlock says, "when I was living in Rouen."
Sherlock is quiet. "Does it matter?" he asks, after a moment.
John grins up at him. "Do we deserve some sort of reward?"
himself: gasping, a low and helpless whine. His face is pressed down to Sherlock's shoulder. Even John is too tall for this. It hurts his back they won't be able to even though hard in his trousers but John can't get them open in this position aching all over strung together badly seams digging in like his jeans all of him bound together too tight; and "John," Sherlock says, into the middle. It feels like a key.
"Fuck it," he says, and sighs, and then reaches back to the towel rail for the knickers.
"Can you tell me?" George asks; and John sighs.
Slotting his arms around John's body. Back to chest held tight. John licks at his parched lips heart fast and hard and reckless whispers, "All right."
, Sherlock'd told Mrs. Hudson: nothing's changed. Just. Breathe. Breathe and listen and don't fucking
And again.
"I've got more stamina than that," John says, squinting up at him.
John moans.
"John," says Sherlock, low and rough.
what you're doing," Sherlock says, hot and breathless; and John grabs onto the edge of the bath behind Sherlock's shoulders to drag their bodies together: Sherlock gasping underneath him, hands hot on his back and his thigh. "Fuck," Sherlock says, then groans, long and wordless, as between them John takes them both in hand.
"I." John licks his bottom lip. "What."
"I—" John swallows, shivering head to toe— "haven't, you—"
Sounding curious.
"Given the amount of work he's done for me in the past three years, the two are functionally inextricable," says Mycroft; then adds, "I won't bother to rehash our conversation at the time," which is patently false, since he immediately continues, "but when you moved back to Baker Street I did tell you you'd be foolish to expect anything different from him, and—"
, Sherlock says,
After a moment, Sherlock exhales. Straightens. "I trust that you've kept count," he says, Holmes top to bottom: untouchable, self-possessed; and the cane lies narrow and cool across the too-bent ache in his back and John whispers, "Nine, sir," and the cane whips up:
"I confess, before you called me, John, I'd forgotten all about it," she says. She's got her proper china out, with the blue-and-grey leaf pattern that John happens to know Sherlock and her grandniece had spent a solid eighteen months conspiring to locate and buy back, piece by piece, after Mrs. Hudson had come home from Florida; every year, still, the niece sends him the most hideous Christmas card she can find, inevitably signed
It makes John feel hot. Weirdly defensive. "I mean," he says, too fast, "That's his choice, isn't it? To know—to understand what happened in his own bloody life, and I—I've got to be glad, haven't I, that this—that
"But I can't," John says, finally. "All I can do is. Connect": helpless. "What dots I can see."
"God damn it," Sherlock gasps, and rolls forward, pinning John down—shoving in—and
: sounds a bit ridiculous, but— "Can I suck your cock?" John asks.
He stops. His face tucked in near to John's face.
John nods. Swallows. Closes his eyes.
, John; and then Sherlock'd hung up on him so he wouldn't come while John was in another country, and John'd got up in the morning and put on boxer shorts under his jeans.
Sherlock looks offended; then torn; and then he nods. Pink along the tops of his ears, John thinks. It's subtle. Maybe.
"Sherlock," he asks.
"I think Sherlock might go on a killing spree," John says, finally, "if I took a woman to Rhoda's birthday party."
you": helpless. "I'm not going to leave."
John wonders, a little hysterically, if this'll end, too, with him wanking on his knees on the living room floor.
"I'd better start in on teaching you German, then, won't I," Sherlock is saying, breathless, as he touches him with intent for the first time, really, since he's got the cock ring done up: his hands eager and wet as he rubs against the taut prickling skin behind John's balls, presses two fingers into him, not deep but all at once, a hair faster than almost too slow. John just—just opens for him, vaguely surprised. He is inhaling. It feels—difficult, almost; but it isn't. Very strange. Under him Sherlock is watching him open-mouthed rubbing his slick thumb against the little metal ring at the base of the strap: push-and-pull pressure, wet, pulled tight; an unfamiliar sensation that is bizarre in its unfamiliarity, like a stranger's voice on the phone that you thought, almost, you recognized. John's face is hot. Staring up at him Sherlock is breathing hard, pulling him open, tugging him back. John's hands on the sheets feel heavy, swollen; it isn't until Sherlock is nudging his cock up into him, eyes half-shut, gasping, that John realizes that he is intensely, almost painfully aroused.
Sherlock inhales, very, very slow. Brushing his warm mouth on John's mouth.
, must not be real, can't be true because they are touching where he can feel Sherlock warm and solid through his crisp cotton shirt in an unflattering green and John hasn't fallen over or flown apart or exploded yet, but—
, John thinks, with a pang. "Yeah," Sherlock says; and John says, "All right."
"I can't believe we're the best suited for this," John says.
, still, somehow, to be tucked up back to chest with Sherlock's tight-clinging arm 'round his middle; Sherlock warm and close and present, breathing damply just behind John's ear.
A breath: warm. Sherlock says, "Yeah"; and John swallows.
"You want me to work you open," Sherlock says. "As open as you can get."
"Well," Sherlock says, and then pauses.
"You did
-two-three, in-two-three, out-two-three, in-two-three, out-two-three, in-two-three, out-two-three-
"Sherlock," John says, thick; and Sherlock pushes their faces back close together, panting. Heart throbbing everywhere under his skin sweaty all over. As though he's run.
"Because it's what you do for me," John whispers; and Sherlock closes his eyes.
and then pullsdown slick-sliding tight buried in his—wet hand his
, John thinks, not a joke, but Sherlock is not-quite-smiling, lopsided against him: a half-unvoiced apology, pressed into the corners of John's mouth.
"—like some sort of sexual robot." Sherlock laughs, wild, closer and closer and then says, "But of course, you'd probably—"
"No," he says. He sounds exhausted. "I didn't think I could."
"Or it's more like a compulsion," John says, and then sets his tea down. His face hot. "A compulsion to—to please me," he says; and then, very quietly, "Or"; and then he folds his fingers over his mouth, tight at the corners, pulling down.
"I've done it before," Sherlock says. Breath wet warm close. "With my—not deep. But," and John laughs, ragged, because of course he has, the great bloody idiot. John rubs his face against Sherlock's nape, gets himself in hand. Nudges against him, careful; rubs; and beneath him Sherlock exhales, going loose. Whispers, "Eight," and then presses back.
"I think you ought to tell me," Sherlock murmurs, "all these things that you shouldn't think."
Pushing all his extremely well-minced garlic into a little heap, John nods, then sets the knife at the edge of the board and goes to peel off his gloves, wash his hands. He comes to a stop behind Sherlock, who is zesting the lemon. John puts his hand on Sherlock's spine, feeling his ribs rise-fall-rise as he breathes. Breathes. Breathes.
with it, I'm sodding
"Have you talked to him about wanting that?" George asks.
"So you didn't." Sherlock scrapes his face up John's ear. "Didn't think about what'd really make me lose the thread, did you?"
, Sherlock'd said, John thinks. Or
"Then—it's enough for my purposes to know that he was up here," he says. "If he couldn't get an alias right away, he'd just go antagonize another bomb squad."
She takes a breath, then lets it out in a long, slow stream. Somewhere down the street, a dog yaps twice, then is silenced, then starts up again. "Write, I think," says Marianne. Past the window boxes, a very beautiful boy emerges from a stairwell dangling a tangled lead, a French bulldog whining and wriggling in his arms. "Write
"Why thank you, Sherlock," she says, and John nudges the empty chair out for him. Rhoda says, "Um—I'm not sure if you know—well, you must know Tom and Marianne and Jeremy—do you know Paige?" Leaning past Marianne to look at him Paige gives him a smile, a little wave.
"Bastard," Sherlock murmurs, and John grins, bending to swipe his tongue along the crease of Sherlock's thigh. Sherlock inhales, and John gives him a few loose strokes. Plumping him up. He bends down to lap at him and Sherlock shifts on the sofa, legs falling wide.
"No?" He smiles. "All right. What, then?"
John moans.
"I'm sorry," Sherlock says, very quietly. John shakes his head. Kisses his cheek.
"Yeah," John says. "Re—had a girlfriend," he corrects, "who liked them."
It seems absurd to ignore his erection, so John doesn't. It's an erection; John has one too; the only difference being that since Sherlock's leaving at seven he'll probably fuel his into being a bastard to Chloe while John fully intends to have a furious wank and another shower after he goes, so. John washes Sherlock's erection. He's careful with the soap: best not to sting. He nudges Sherlock around to give his arse another quick scrub, too: John'd probably leaked all over him.
," gasped out as he holds him, panting: forehead pressed to expensive trousers stretched over Sherlock's long, hot thigh. Panting. Pinning Sherlock's big bony wrists and gasping,
"I want to go to bed with you," Sherlock whispers; and John—lets out—breath and heat and sweat all over, thinking—
. "I've met her," John says.
Breathing out. Sherlock nodding. Pressing him open millimeter by slick millimeter, heartbeat loud in John's ears. Holding him tight.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but he does head back into the kitchen. His voice floats back out above the running water: "You know that porcine is the best substitute one can buy, in any significant quantity. I'd've used human if anyone would sell it to me."
"And I—it feels good and sometimes it's—it's c-comforting," Sherlock finishes: a whisper, barely. Face hot getting hotter. Nodding, John kisses his cheek.
"Yes, I—you." Sherlock swallows. "You can keep doing that." He's getting redder and redder while John lets his fingers brush in-in-in against him. Trousers sliding down, down, down Sherlock's thighs as he squirms.
"John?" Nat asks. She sounds worried.
"You like that I've been skipping my runs?" John asks, a little lopsided, and then stops, and Sherlock looks up at him with his wide sharp sky-clear green eyes.
"Edward Vaughan is a second-rate arsehole," Priyanka is telling Ben. Hand still tucked into his elbow. Everyone else leaning, ever so slightly, back. Priyanka's not the sort any of them would cross; she's the sort who turns up to the surgery in cargo pants and Birkenstocks and more or less bullies their patients into getting better, a square stocky woman in late middle age with the sort of brusque, no-nonsense manner that John imagines necessarily comes from spending forty years living with a white bloke with an ill-kempt beard who teaches medieval history and named their son Faramir. "He's still put out he didn't win the Patterson Prize back in 497 B.C.E., and he likes to make sure everyone around him pays the price."
His voice trails off. He can't, somehow, quite manage it. The air thick with them. Entire graveyards, of cut-down sentences.
"Hey," John repeats; but Sherlock mercifully refrains from commenting on his deathless conversation, and lets John tug him into a kiss.
John swallows. Lets him. It feels good: almost shamefully so, a hot-tight-unwelcome knot inside John half-unraveling; remembering, loosing floods. Two weeks ago Sherlock had slapped his face and half-choked him and then made him sweet tea and then coaxed him to drink it, stayed pressed all alongside him on the sofa until John fell asleep. At the time John'd thought it—overserious, almost; rather touching; a pre-planned palate-cleansing sorbet to follow whatever lightly sadomasochistic evening's entertainment might've been to the taste of his companion: the sort of mechanistic Sherlockian ritual he might've equally performed for whatever politely-incurious female sexual partners he'd been shagging in Rouen, in Amsterdam. Maybe he'd read about it, John'd thought, in a book. It'd also been—
"Yeah," Sherlock whispers, pushing back against him. "Eight."
," Sherlock says, and looks him full in the face, his eyes wrinkled at the corners and strangely wide as he says, "I was worried about you"; and John can feel all the air coming out of his sparkling, suddenly-sharp lungs.
"But yeah," John says, "I am." He wants to laugh. "Happy, I mean. Even if—"
John's breath. In—his lungs, and— "Are you," John says, "
"Yeah," John gasps, and then chokes, "k-kiss me," and then burning up all over tilts his face down-down-down towards Sherlock's tight arm until he almost can't breathe.
Sherlock hums. "You like this."
You will note that this now part 31 out of 57. At this point, I am about 95% sure that that "out of 57" is correct, but I do reserve the right to change it if I need to later on—there's at least one scene that I may need to split and at least one pair I may need to combine, depending on how the pacing sorts itself out when I actually write them.
"I don't know about you," John says, "but I woke up to oral sex, so—" and curving their bodies together like the sides of a shell on the white beach of their hotel sheets, Sherlock presses his face into John's shoulder, huffing out a laugh.
Useless, really. All of it. If John'd been there—but he wasn't. Was he.
"Put," John manages, "can you put—your, your fingers—" swallowing, swallowing— "Up," John says, face hot, "my cunt": and Sherlock sucks in a hot unsteady breath and is still.
Sorry it took me like 8 hours after the Tumblr post to put this one up—I was AFK, and then I forgot, and then AO3 was down, so. Wheeeeee.
— "Fuck," Sherlock gasps, smearing salt-slick on "
A smallish sort of silence falls: not too heavy; half, he finds, already broken in. John's never precisely disliked Marianne, but he's never precisely known how to navigate these sorts of awkward half-friendly acquaintanceships that tend to spring up whenever Sherlock's had a case this close to home. She'd been helpful: more than helpful, really, John doesn't know what would've happened back in February if she hadn't rung him up, said,

: across the soft skin just at the junction of torso and arm; into his sparse wiry fur, salty and fragrant and, like his beard, lighter than it seems it ought to be: damp and reddish and brown. Sherlock squirms like a fish underneath him, gasping: "Ticklish?" John asks, muffled.

Sherlock's mouth is tugging up into a little pleased smile. "Just a little?" he echoes, but he's already wriggles up to sitting, knees coming apart.

"Four, I think," Sherlock says, quietly.
"And you want the intimacy," George says; and heavy and tired, John nods, and then scrubs at his eyes.
"It's all right," John says, quiet. Silent Sherlock nods. John presses his mouth to his arm. "No one's watching," he says. Skin under his breath.

"Harry recommended it," John reminds him.

"Get you so soaked," breathed against him, "four hours later you'd still be ready."
He's warm, and—soft, surfacing up through marshmallow, with.
Sherlock bobs up from kneeling on the other side of the bed, looking triumphant. "Landed on the duvet," he says, holding it up, and puts it safely atop his chest of drawers before wrestling the duvet back up and over his tidy hospital corners: smoothing it out, tugging it flat before turning the top corner back. He's naked, still half-hard and damp from the flannel they'd used to mop themselves up, and John has a brief, dizzying flash of Sherlock's body bowed again above him; his hooded half-open dark eyes and the red hills-and-valleys of his throat; arm braced on the headboard, the way the pressure of his body had stuck John's thighs to his sides. John's hands clench on the pillow: it must seem like hesitation, because Sherlock, perching at the open mouth of the bed, holds out a hand; and John goes.
"You'll tell me," John says, scraped up.
"We didn't eat lunch," Sherlock says. "I thought—that salad you like, with the. Lentils."
Next to him Sherlock is breathing hard. The bloke on the screen's got his legs scissored in between and over his partner's, pushing in, a little; in and out: just a bit. Sherlock is pressed all up against John's side, so that when John moves his wrist his upper arm flexes against Sherlock and his rolled-up white sleeves. John can't help the way he's breathing; doesn't want to, Sherlock's face half-turned breath hot. John reaches up, heart pounding; Sherlock's breath hot-cold on the sensitive spaces between his fingers, and then he gives John's palm two thick, thorough licks. John angles his face towards him, gets his hand back on his cock. Tugs his foreskin down with thumb and forefinger, shows Sherlock the flushed-pink head of him, shining for him. Wet. Sherlock swallows: up-down, up-down; John's empty right hand—on, on his balls through his boxers, on the shirt rucked up 'round his belly, on Sherlock's shirtfront. Out of the corner of his eye John can see the bloke kneeling up on the video press his partner's shoulders down towards the mattress for a better angle on their fuck.
, warm everywhere above him Sherlock hot-present breathing in breathing out above him arms around him ribs to his ribs as Sherlock (
I regret nothing.
John hasn't given up on the end of the sentence. He wants, infuriatingly, for Sherlock to finish it out. He doesn't know why; he can't imagine he'll like it. Like ripping off a plaster, perhaps; but ripping off a plaster doesn't make it hurt any less: it just gives you less time to dread it. His hands at his sides are clenching and unclenching, clenching and unclenching. He'd pressed their bodies together, in the kitchen. Upstairs he'd barely brushed the back of Sherlock's bent head. Before that he'd dressed them both in ladies' knickers and let Sherlock fuck him, over and over, kissed him countlessly, put his fingers inside him, rubbed all over him his wide-open watering mouth, so—so what? What now? He can't say it he knows it but he wants to, desperately: what, in fact, will he be allowed?
Following John kisses his throat. The top of his sternum: Sherlock's breath hitches, under John's mouth: it feels— "I want to, too," John whispers. Like a rope, unknotted. Like an unlocked box. Sherlock hums arching to him and John presses his face against Sherlock's skin throbbing just this side of his blood. Unsteady he kisses Sherlock's collarbone: an irresistible, architectural curve.
"You're going to be late for work," Sherlock says, with idle, admirable precision.
John bends back down and kisses the mark up high on Sherlock's neck, where his collar won't cover it, and Sherlock breathes, "God."
So now John moves his neck eyes closed what a
"Yeah, it'll be—just—come on," as John pushes his coat off Sherlock's shoulders, tugs as he pulls his arms free. Sherlock gets up to toss it over the back of John's chair at the table, and when he comes back to stand by the sofa, eyes glittering, looking down, John realizes he's just where Sherlock left him; that an awful lot of the past week has involved him in front of Sherlock, on his knees. His skin burns and shrivels, but he doesn't move, does he. Sherlock toes off his shoes and sits back down on the sofa, body turning towards him in an angled, listing-open "V" as he leans back in with his eyes still mostly open and licks the corner of John's mouth. John slides his hand 'round the back of Sherlock's neck, scratching through his wisps of hair; and Sherlock wriggles his leg up onto the cushions, elbow down hand up, tugging John down over him as John holds onto the back of the sofa lowering himself down, and tries not to let anyone get kneed in the groin.
John is peculiarly aware of his pulse. The steady, slow throb: heavy in the tips of his fingers. Echoed, by the table, back into his hand.
Sherlock used to telegraph for miles. He's got a bit better about that, enough so that even though John gets his arm around his bowl as fast as he can— "Leave it, you've got your own," voice rising, as Sherlock interjects, "You said—," and then darts his chopsticks out. "I said you could have my
"Whenever you want to," John repeats. Helpless he catches the left, kissing it as above him Sherlock gets redder and redder, brushed to John's mouth Sherlock's knuckles curled over John's knuckles, so red: it should feel absurd, really—does, a bit—but then the feeling slithers away, all the way away, slippery-misshapen writhing into—into something else; and breathless John guides Sherlock's long fingers bent over his fingers from his lips to the side of his neck. A half-instant of contact and Sherlock clamps onto the meat of his shoulder, clenching hard:
": John's heart thundering high in his throat while his mouth on Sherlock's warm mouth shivering together as they trade breathless biting—little—licks: "Let my hair down for you," John says, unsteady, and Sherlock groans, pulling at the ends of it; "Take off my bra for you," John whispers, nuzzling at him, and Sherlock gives a broken little laugh: "Yes"; John whispers, "It's blue," and into his mouth Sherlock makes a low hot battered little noise and whimpers, "Yesplease," and John presses their faces flat together wanting rubbing-rubbing at him hot all over and says, "Get undressed with you," and swallows-swallows-swallows as Sherlock gasps, "Yes"; and John says, "I haven't, you know": and Sherlock's breath—
Even with a fifteen-minute head start on his appointments, by the time Brian shows up, John's already resigned himself to spending the entire day two patients behind. At their ostensible lunch break—a cup of tea apiece and the last eight stale biscuits split between the three of them in five minutes snatched at the minifridge-and-kettle fake kitchenette that lurks at the back of the reception desk—John, resigned, asks about Michael and the kids, and Brian asks about Sherlock, and Natalie tells them both to bugger off so she can do her filing, thankfully sparing John from the rest of
John squints up at him. "And you—what, got involved with them and their... bomb-making activities?"
"That's all right," John says, instead.
"I do like sleeping with you," John says, very carefully. "But—I don't want you to feel... trapped, or." He sighs. "Obligated, just because we wound up here," as Sherlock tugs his foot out of John's hand and then turns around, clambering up over him, so that John has to roll onto his back,  Sherlock's knees settling in between his knees, chest to his chest, and then Sherlock's pink dear face tucking down into John's throat.
"Strangely enough,
you considered the Empress Matilda's regency in Italy' and so on, grilling the boy for half an hour on this series of letters that as far as I know hasn't even been conclusively attributed—"
. "Fuck," Sherlock gasps, squirming—harder,
"It'll hardly be dry by tonight," Sherlock says; and John says, "Yeah, but you
"You can't ask me to be happy about someone who hurt you, Sherlock," John says, very quietly; and Sherlock stops.
"No," John says. "Sherlock. Please."
he replies, then tucks his mobile back into his desk, and rings for the next patient: Karen McAllister's second boy, who cries through the whole appointment, screams bloody murder when John tries to examine his ears, and gets snot and tears all over the wrist of John's jumper while Ms. McAllister tries to jiggle and coax him into letting John look down his throat. The older one's listlessly tapping at their mum's iPhone in the corner, face flushed and uncommonly silent:
it, to—to anyone." Sherlock touches his fingers: one-two-three-four. "That you. Wanted me."
John swallows. "Well, since you've been texting me wank pictures at work—"
"Can you." The weight of Sherlock's body is muffled: the sheets. John sucks.
with someone," he says, finally; and then sighs, and rubs a hand over his face.
. A fluency that John, at least, has not ever mastered. Then John—who had spent the four months since Harry'd moved to Edinburgh preferring to sublet her room in their flat a half-mile away to a succession of unreliable strangers rather than give up their overpriced lease and move back into the flat he'd once shared with his entire life and already had for free—had thought:
He slides his arm tight around John's middle, though. Pulling him close: they stick together; lovely. Delirious: body to body. He's so warm.
inconvenient, John," Mycroft replies, low crisp command; "I should hate to have to take the time to locate you again, so stay, if you please, quite precisely where you are": so nodding John presses his skull back to the steady-beside building and breathes in, and breathes in. Why, he can't, it's so—cold today and—why can't he—Mycroft says, "He's just about to turn onto the Euston Road," and then adds, "my goodness, is that a collared dove, on the railing?"; so John squints through the still-squiggling white—silence and then manages, "It's a pigeon."
. "You'll stay?" Sherlock says. "You'll stay down here, I mean."
"I—" John stops. Inhales. Regroups. "Sherlock. Are you... not happy, with... with what we do, or—" and Sherlock says, "Are you?"
"Yeah." Sherlock shifts, restless. "Yeah."
"I haven't got a case," Sherlock says, quiet.
"God." John can barely breathe. "You're really." Pressing slick fingers against the already-soaked too-tender rim of himself, tucked against the jut of bone at the crest of Sherlock's lovely, angular wrist. Looking up at Sherlock's red-flushed face and wide eyes: "Touch me," John whispers, and Sherlock gasps, and then evaporating out disintegrating in Sherlock's lap-arms-bed warm-sheeted and groaning as touching the tendons that pull-shift in Sherlock's slick moving right forearm as Sherlock's clever fingers caress him all over him around him
Sherlock stops. Pulling—
: John is thinking somewhere far deep deep down unjustifiable
"Do you," Sherlock insists, and John shifts, squaring his weight.
His mouth. Soft. Soft, so John makes himself soft. Mouth soft hands soft kissing soft as Sherlock has been soft is wanting—
At his wet skin. Fingers sticking.
Against him Sherlock breathes: a kiss. They breathe. Up close blurred by eyelashes: gentle John slides his hand into Sherlock's thick hair. Breathing in Sherlock slides an arm around John's middle. Snuggling close. As a side effect it lets him more or less hide the knickers by virtue of pressing them against John's body, but John lets him, would let him do—anything, just about. Half-wants to let him do all the rest. John pets at Sherlock's ribs. His sweaty lower back. Lets the side of his hand brush the top of the waistband, and when Sherlock's breath hitches, John slides his hand back up, gentle, away.
I do." John laughs. "Yes, I enjoy having—a transcendently beautiful lover who adores me and is obsessively dedicated to getting me off multiple times a day, what do you
—and John frowns, leaning back in his seat.
John forces his hand loose. "I thought," he says, unsteadily, fucking—watching Sherlock with his idle knees and barely-touching fingers and the line of his cock, half-hard, untouched, plain through the thin fabric of his pajamas. "In fact," John says, "I thought you might rather enjoy it."
"Something," Sherlock echoes: and then swallows. "I thought—you're wearing m—you've got on the suspender belt."
Sherlock inhales, half-sighing; then jerks all his gangly body parts up to sitting, to kneeling, and climbs past John and goes straight for his overnight bag, fishing out a pair of crumpled pajama bottoms and a vest, slightly dingy, that John, standing to slide his boxers on, glances up at; then immediately forgets; then looks back at, a little bit startled, as Sherlock is pulling it down over his shoulders: it is, quite unmistakably, John's. Sherlock gives him a quick, pink-eared look, then bends back down to zip up his bag, still with the LHR tags hanging off the handle. John turns back to the bed, a little off-balance; then realizes what he's really looking at—a night under a pair of unwashed bodies and one and a half hot shags—and leans forward to drag off the duvet. Sherlock comes over when he's halfway through shucking the first pillow and helps him with the other, reaching over the mattress to peel back the far corners so that John can bundle everything up in the filthy bottom sheet and carry the lot to the kitchen, following Sherlock down the stairs.
"Marvelous," John agrees.
, fitting itself in everywhere in the space all around him: a lowdark scraping flicker at—just at—
"I have to—brush my teeth," he says, helpless, "and I have to shave, I didn't this morning, it's scratchy, it'll—
John wakes up because Sherlock is shaking his shoulder, bent close. When John cracks open an eye, Sherlock says, "It's almost half seven," voice pitched low. "Your mobile's dead." He's dressed, but in his clothes from yesterday, perched on the edge of John's mattress. John's still lying on the far side of the bed.
"Do you... get, er." John laughs. "Christ, I can't believe I'm asking you this."
"You like it, huh," he says, very quietly.
My sincerest apologies for the delay: I had a manic episode, I got a job, California was on fire, I crash-landed into a new fandom, you know, the usual...
. John is shaking, pulse pounding all over as he gets up onto his knees: Sherlock's dripping wet, red-flushed and half-hidden, without John's hands to hold him apart. "This is a fucking terrible idea," John says, unsteady, but he's already spitting into his palm, isn't he, draping himself across Sherlock's back. "You know that, don't you?"
John feels—hollowed out. A transparent shell. If the sun were behind him anyone could see right through. "I want you to kiss me," he says, unsteady. If you were me I mean. It has the inequitable advantage of being true. Sherlock leans up and John sinks down: thighs sprawled across his lap. Their bodies touch. Their mouths touch, soft. Sitting beneath him arms around him Sherlock shivers. Makes a high, caught sound and John squeezes his arms around him tightthenloosening again to kiss him, soft. Soft:
John stuffs his hands into his jacket pockets. Hears himself saying, "Do you, now," just—just how he meant it, how he means it, with his heart beating steadily inside the cage of his ribs.
That's it, isn't it? That's the only word for it. Sherlock had been utterly graceless about it. Hasty. Impatient, and clumsy with it: his big angular body that isn't at all awkward—that never seems ungainly—but it
He sets his overnight bag on the foot of his bed and starts sorting it out: trousers for the dry cleaner, shirts and socks and balled-up pajamas and pants.
"Upstairs," John repeats. He wasn't right. He'd misremembered.
"Sensitive," Sherlock says, quiet. Still stroking, higher up.
Careful.
John rubs his palms on his dressing gown, laughs. "I'd've thought—bit unfashionable by your time, wasn't it?"
"So," John says. "This student of your grandmother's."
John takes a breath. Lets it out.
Breathe.
John wants to just—just sink straight into the tightwethot stretch of his body wrap those long long legs tight 'round his hips while kissing and kissing he rolls his body into Sherlock's as over and over they kiss and they kiss and they—
Wild-eyed, Sherlock's ribs jerk. "
"You liked that?" Sherlock asks.
there, and sitting there, mounted on John's laptop, it's easy to forget that it is, in fact, independently important. Like this, it just looks like a hard drive, belonging to John's best friend, which John has not, until today, ever seen: there's—nothing to it. No weight. No swelling music; no ominous warping background tone; no skin-prickling or suggestive sound effects unless John counts the car alarm that's going off, somewhere, faintly in the distance but not, he thinks, on Baker Street; and he doesn't know any of Sherlock's passwords but he doesn't need them like this, does he. He's used Sherlock's computer enough to have a sense of the organizational scheme he likes: top-level folders that divide the contents into people, places, and things; then nested subfolders by subject, subfolders by sub-subject, subfolders by date; long filenames, cross-referenced by means of a liberal use of symbolic links: just to keep up with him, back in 2011, John'd spent six evenings patchily spaced across the better part of a month struggling through an online tutorial on bash; and the point is, with this drive mounted and open on his laptop, John knows his way around, if he wanted to use it. The open picture of Sherlock with his Amsterdam Americans is titled "netherlands_amsterdam_rijksmuseum_adeline-g_cooper-m_chabra-r_adams-a_20130514.png"; and John swallows, because that's—plenty. Probably for mostly anyone with half a brain but
George hums, assenting, and picking at the crust of his sandwich, John takes a breath. "But—but any way I look at it," he says, and then he has to stop, again.

"Are, a bit?" Sherlock kisses his knee.

John blinks. Swallowing. "Are you talking about your—"
The light through the window is bluing grey and wan—too early, still, most likely. Sherlock a warm rangy presence behind him. Everything still. The sheet is tangled up between them, a fold barely tugged across John's hips, his legs and torso bare, oily with sweat all over. It's already too hot. Sherlock is sleeping. John shifts, slow, by stages twisting to see: Sherlock lying rolled away, facing the wall and the window, half on his side and half on his face. His bared spine a shining damp groove. He's more compact, in his sleep: the top of his head and his shoulder are huddled together, mashed against the bottom of John's second pillow. As John watches, his back rises—falls—rises again, slow and shallow and even. The duvet is bunched up down past his feet. John pushes himself to sitting: careful, careful; and the mattress doesn't squeak. He rarely sees Sherlock all the way asleep.
"Yes," Holmes says, "that's eight." He shifts his weight; the line of the cane presses into John's skin.
Unsteady John says, "That." Swallows. "I know I'm not going to leave but—but
"Do you want to," John asks, and drags himself up-slow pulling watching Sherlock's lovely opal eyes fluttering shut. Sharp all over: "Christ," John says; then laughs.
"So—what," Marianne asks. Voice flat. "You want to know if I, too, have families in trouble, or—"
"If I
"And this isn't war," she says, "so—what? Should it be
John touches his forearm. The white bump of his wrist. Rubbing at his belly in circles: when did he start doing that? Sherlock is still holding himself so tightly he very nearly vibrates, otherwise unmoving, until John's hand slides over his hand and Sherlock grabs at it, turning, squeezing-squeezing: so hard it grinds the bones in John's hand.
you know how they go, theoretically." Sherlock doesn't answer, and John fastens the last hook and eye together and then wriggles the belt about himself, with an absurd little hip jiggle added just to make Sherlock bark out a laugh. "Yeah?" John asks. He jiggles again, and Sherlock snorts. "I know," John says, "I, too, find flaccid dangling penises fantastically sexy—"
Sherlock is just behind him, quiet; and so John turns, looking up.
"Yeah. I—of course." John licks at his bottom lip, dumb and stupid. He still feels half asleep. Tongue clumsy, he asks, "Er—by yourself?"
"Kissing?" John asks, and kisses him: Sherlock opening his burning-hot mouth on his mouth. His body all over still— "Or," John asks, "And—"; and Sherlock blurts out, "Keep talking": and then shudders to stillness allover as he moans.
, John thinks, warm and buoyant. His fingers are tangled-untangling with the back of Sherlock's dark hair. It always looks different, after John's been at it; probably no one else can tell. "Six of the best, wasn't it?" John asks, and Sherlock lifts his head up, pushes his spectacles up the bridge of his nose.
, and God.
John swallows. "Hugging's all right, is it?" he asks, quiet; and against him, once, jerky, Sherlock nods; so John wraps his arms around Sherlock's body and pulls him in so close and tight that between them their clothes feel huge, overmagnified. The Great Wall of Sherlock's tight black button-down. The castle moat he'd given John for his birthday, in the form of a pair of well-tailored dark rinse jeans.
John says, "Friday."
—" and Sherlock pulls fingers out smacks him twice-battered sparking moan falling out wet-warm around the back of his clenched crabbed hand, Sherlock shoving slick fingers back into him to rub at him electric-blue aching, pressing his wet thumb hard against his shivering-up burned-open outsides—
"Well, then." John stretches out so he can dig Sherlock's mobile out of the crack in the side of the chair opposite, then passes it up over his head when Sherlock comes up behind him, hand warm on the back of John's neck.
John nods. "Yeah," he says, and then laughs, a little. "Honestly," he says, "I'd probably give you anything you want."
John taps his chopstick against the side of Sherlock's. Sherlock pokes him in the wrist, and John tries to slap him away.
"Do I get hard," Sherlock says. Pale sharp eyes.
"And you can just shut it," John says, while Sherlock squirms, not quite laughing. "It's not at all diplomatic to imply that someone you're shagging—"
, or do you need to—"
Sherlock glares at him: incendiary.
that he hadn't meant to do that, and when he drags his toy out of John's mouth John tongues at the head of it, looking up through his smudging eyelashes: feeling his own mouth wet and slack around silicone taste as he stares up at the blur of Sherlock's flat blank flushed face. Sherlock's just-parted lips. Some strange creature is uncoiling beneath John's ribs: he pulls his mouth off the cock and kneels up and kisses Sherlock's mouth and Sherlock, unmoving, lets him. Lets John part his lips. Lets John lick him open and fist two hands in his hair and then Sherlock's fingertips fall on the shivering small of John's back, and splay.
When John walks into the surgery, Marcus says, "Er, I brought, er, danish, and, er," so John takes one for later, thanks him, and pulls his first patient chart himself. That same bubble of a thought suspended, still, between the back of his tongue and his throat.
Sherlock pushes his wet hair back off his face. "That's clarifying shampoo," he says. "Not more than once a week, it's drying."
"This," Sherlock says. Shifting, a bit: John scratches a little, and Sherlock's head drops forward, arching into his hand. "Sitting," Sherlock says, thick, "in your lap."
"I was thinking I could smack it a few times," Sherlock explains. Hand flat. Stroking up. "Get you nice and pink." Against him John nods, unsteady, and petting back down the hollow of his back Sherlock whispers, "Warmed up for me."
"It's very much
John nods, then says, "How'd you come by the cock ring with a lead ring on it, then?"
, somehow, feeling—mouth full-wet and he sucks at his fingers, kicks his left foot up onto the coffee table. Bared. All of him prickling up too-hot half-cold with his prick
John swallows. Nods, then swallows. Swallows. "You do the food," he says, "and I'll do the tea"; and when Sherlock nods and staggers up to standing, John shoves a hard-pressing restraining hand to his cock.
"Yeah," Sherlock says.
He runs for almost an hour and stops at Tesco's and comes back with milk and tea and eggs and bread for toast and some staples that'll keep, because if the opera thing turns out to be a case Sherlock won't be bored enough to bother with food for the duration but who knows how long that'll be, and rice and veg for stir fry, because John at least will still have to eat. In the street the handles of the bags cut into John's palms. In the flat, he loads everything into the fridge and the cupboards and tries not to pay attention to the sound of Sherlock's hair dryer, just the other side of the wall.
; saying,
"All right," John says.
"You can't hold every conference to the same standard as the BMA," Paige scoffs. "We're all shameless lushes—and I reckon," turning to Marianne and Tom, "your mum told you that medicine was a
"At one point," Sherlock says. Stops. "It made sense," he says. "To. To take on that role."
"R'a little awake," thick. Slots his fingers between Sherlock's fingers. "I'm awake."
He grabs the tea towel and wets it, then goes to wipe down the table. Sugar, John thinks, in his spilt tea. John slides into his abandoned spot beside the sink and starts in on the washing up. He doesn't, quite, finish first. "John," Sherlock says, low, at his side. John rinses his cup and sets it on the draining board with the handle out and turns to face him, then; and Sherlock bends down to kiss him, soft with something not entirely unlike exhaustion.
—mouth—
Sherlock lets out a gust of air, and John pushes up onto his elbows, then kneels halfway up, reaching up for the lube. Between them Sherlock's hands flutter, then settle chastely on John's hips. It makes every inch of John's skin hurt. He bends back down to put his mouth on Sherlock's mouth his lips to his lips and his tongue and his teeth and he bites down on Sherlock's plush bottom lip with his hand clenched around a mostly-empty bottle of Sherlock's posh bastard lube and under him Sherlock makes a low, electric sound. "I want you to," John is saying, into his mouth. Mangled. Incomprehensible, he'd think, except that then Sherlock makes another incendiary little noise, running his fingertips lightly along the crack of John's arse like he hadn't had his tongue halfway to John's bloody tonsils just last night and then he takes his arse in both hands all at once and gives him a squeeze and suddenly in John's mind the image sparks, and shivers, and then
John nods, even though Sherlock isn't looking. "Me too," he says, "it's. Fun"; and Sherlock inhales, straightening, and then pushes back off the sink.

"I'm Harry, but please don't," he said as he began to explain what had happened, going through what he had seen in the alley, to the fact that he saw the man in the hospital and that he was looking for him, "I need to find them, to tell them that I saw him again," he finished softly.

"I think I'm going to have a quick kip before you order," John yawned again.
"Well before I let you unleash your 'dogs of war' speech and cement yourself to become my brother's most favourite in-law, let me talk to him for a moment," Sherlock interjected as he pulled out his phone and called his brother.
Sherlock nodded his head, "Of course, Harry, choose what you would like from the Chinese menu on the desk and tell me. I'll be ordering in about two hours," he said as he turned to Harry.
"He wont say anything, he isn't even telling us his last name. We're having social services come in to talk with him later, but he will be in here for at least another day or two," he told him, "We only just about got his D.O.B out of him, as soon as he realised why we were asking all the questions he stopped answering."
"He didn't come back so don't you worry about that. Now how are things?" Mike asked Harry as he glanced at the two men in the room, who were watching them both.
Thank you for the comments and the kudos, you are all amazing!
"Come and watch over Mrs Hudson for a bit," John suggested to him.
Harry shook his head slowly, "No answer." he snorted adding, "So, now you're trying to take that little bit of peace that I finally have in my life. Well, I'm telling you to just get lost. John and Sherlock have done more for me in the last week, than anyone has done in my entire life before I met them," his voice was shaking but strong as he finished, pulling his sleeves down and standing up from his chair, "Just leave me alone, and don't take your inadequacies and failures out on people that did your jobs for you." He walked up the stairs, Snuffles following behind him.
"Sherlock you need to eat though," John sighed as he went and sat down, "I'll make you something after this."
"That she is, when the CIA came here they were after something. Mrs Hudson was harmed by them trying to get the information out of her. She pretended to be the sweet old landlady slash housekeeper for us and that she had no idea where it was or anything. Worked rather well. She had it hidden on her and pretended to be a weak old woman, but she is anything but," Sherlock smirked over at her as he then looked back to Harry.
"True Sherlock," she smirked to him and then giggled, "oh my husband was a rotter, truly he was, Sherlock had him put away for murder, he was a little bastard."
"Righto, take it away Ernie!" Stan called out to the driver as the bus then shot off at high speed.
John moved closer and looked out of the window as well, he couldn't see, "I can't see anyone out there," he replied with a shake of his head.
Sorry for the mistake in putting the chapter sixteen up and not fifteen. Please be on the lookout for chapter seventeen, I will be posting that sometime tonight.
How is your week going so far? Hope things are well!!!
John smiled as he saw Sherlock come into the room, "I think it would be best if the canine remained with us," was the simple answer as he went to the sofa and sat back down.
"Quite," he nodded, as John came back in with some tea.
"They just started when they said about getting me some clothes," he told her soft as he just watched them.
"What the hell am I going to do now," he whispered to himself.
John looked at Harry again and frowned when he saw that he had begun to shake. He got up and went over. He put his hands on Harry's shoulders, making the teen jump and push him away, "Harry," he said softly, calling to him and getting his attention.
"Baker Street," was the simple answer as he asked the child, "When you have been seen to can you tell us all that you know of what happened?"
"So, may I ask who your house guest is?" Mycroft than asked as he looked at the teen that had taken hold of the dog and was staring at him warily.
Sherlock turned and smiled as John came to sit next to him, he took the older man's hand as they shared a gentle kiss, "Both Harry and I agree that it is boring without you around us. I guess you'll have to quit your job so you can be around us 24/7" the consulting detective concluded with a completely straight face.
John nodded his head, "Yeah, good idea. I'll call Mycroft to up the security, that is if he hasn't already. Then bitch at him about how useless his security is," he groused as he looked from the two in the living room to Sherlock.
"That was unusual most will want comfort after a bad dream," Sherlock said.
"The victim might have let himself be stabbed and killed to protect who ever it was that saw what was going on," John said as he looked to the scene, he couldn't imagine just standing there and letting himself be killed, he would have had to fight.
John settled her down on the sofa and smiled as he made sure she was comfortable, he looked around and saw the message, Harry standing in front of it.
Sherlock got out of the cab, and John was left behind to pay once again. The older man rolled his eyes as he followed Sherlock towards the tape. Donovan was there, but she ignored the two of them as they ducked under the tape and walked over to Lestrade.
Mycroft nodded his head as he watched Harry stand up and walk over to the window. The teen was tense, he could see that. He nodded to himself as he looked at the other, "I shall do my best to help then," he said softly.
Thank you for the wonderful reviews. They are amazing. So happy that you are enjoying this story, I do hope that you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
He yawned as he carried on working, he was making good head way and promised himself that if he finished his next report he would reward himself with a hot cup of coffee and a couple of biscuits. He didn't realise that his body was slowly slowing down. His eyes closed and his head fell against his desk as he slept there once more. The two of them were ignorant to the world around them as they slept.
Diane took the papers and looked through then, "they are official," she said handing them to her colleague to look through.
"He has, as soon as that… that monster saw Harry he went to hit him. John had to restrain him," Sherlock said, a hint of pride in his voice as he looked at John.
Thank you for the awesome comments and kudos, you guy and gals are amazing! Hope you have enjoyed this chapter and the story so far!
John smiled as the two carried on talking to each other and went into the kitchen with Sherlock who had a dark look on his face.
The two of them talked a little as Sherlock the coaxed Harry back down and to order for dinner. It took a while, but in the end Sherlock ordered him something. Harry was quiet during the rest of the night, much to the worry of the two adults that were now responsible for him.
"Who is it you want to talk to?" Mike asked, wondering if there was someone that he would be able to contact to come and see the child to help him.
The ambulance came and Sherlock and John went with him. It was almost two hours later when John and Sherlock were with Harry in his room. Sherlock had organised a private room for the young child, thinking it might be easier for them to talk with him without other listening in. John walked out of the room for a moment to talk with one of the doctors that was treating Harry, he wanted to know what condition he was in.
"But you don't want it to just be temporary do you?" she asked with a little smile on her face. When it came to matters of the heart, Molly was able to see a lot more.
"No you're not," Sherlock said as he walked forwards a little, "What did you see last night?" he then blurted out as he looked to the child.
"Hi, have you seen a kid, black hair, rather messy," he said as he recalled the picture that the nurse had showed him, "My little brother has run off from his room again, wondering if he came to hide here?"
"Ah, no wonder you like him Sherlock," Mycroft smiled .
The dog whined and shook his head as he went a little closer and began to beg for a fuss. Harry chuckled a little, wincing at the pain in his chest that caused, but he stroked the dog gentle.
"Hey Tony," John greeted the man.
(See the end of the chapter for
The dog walked a little close, his sharp nose catching the smell of blood that hung around the teen. He watched as he pulled out a wand and quickly went over and whined at him, crawling on his belly, trying to show the child that he was no threat to him at all. He carried on going towards him as Harry looked to him, wand out, but pointed to the ground.
"I don't know what I'm suppose to do boy," he said softly, "I really don't. I just blew up my aunt and she floated out of the window. But if I go into the Magical world, they'll take me back and I don't want to. I know that Uncle Vernon will kill me if I do," he said giving a painful shudder at what he knew Uncle Vernon would do as soon as he saw Harry again, "I really need to get away from here, Uncle Vernon will try and find me, I know he will," he said a little scared.
"Sign these papers and we shall be gone," he told them as he handed them some forms as John let Vernon go.
"Right so now you can go, it's all right for me to wait a few minutes for him to come, so go," Harry smiled to the two of them.
(See the end of the chapter for
John nodded his head, "No one hurts Mrs Hudson, I know," he said as he was reminded of a certain CIA agent going out the window a few times.
Sherlock nodded in agreement, "I believe a couple of suits would do him quite well."
They went quiet and looked at the door as they heard a knock. Mrs. Hudson was quick to answer it and soon enough three sets of footsteps were heard on the stairs and heading towards them. Lestrade walked in first and smiled at them all. The two women that walked in behind him didn't look happy as they glanced around the room.
I don't own Sherlock or Harry Potter, just having some fun.
"Why have you come here to help me now? Why not when I really needed it. When I was being beaten, starved and made to work so hard that my hands would bleed. Where were you then?" he asked her, his eyes serious and his mouth pressed into a thin line.
Harry nodded and grinned as he went and got ready, grabbing the lead and clipping it onto Snuffles's collar. The two walked out of the flat, locking the door behind them and saying goodbye to Mrs Hudson. They walked to the park and let Snuffles off the lead so he could play with the ball that Harry was throwing for him. Harry had to chase him half the time. Sherlock smiled as he watched, the teen was quick on his feet. Though it darkened his thoughts a little as to why he was quick on his feet.
I don’t own Harry Potter or Sherlock, just messing around.
"Greg, please," John said with a shake of his head as Sherlock stood up and walked towards them.
Sherlock thought for a moment, "we need to get him to see that we are in danger a lot of the time as well, even without him here."
"It's all right, no one will get you," he said, "I'm Mike, and you are?" he asked.
"I can see it's more than that by the way that you are sitting," John told him, shaking his head a little, "I know how to spot injuries Harry, I trained hard to do so."
Sherlock gave a pout at that, but John made sure he kept quiet with a look. John gave in and said one suit, which made him happy. They were soon cleaned up and ready to go shopping. Harry was a little unsure of it, but both men took him anyway.
"That's good, we shouldn't have left him," John said, clenching a fist, he wanted to hit something.
"Look," John said softly, "you are under our care at the moment, that means that we'll be getting you some clothes all right, so no more arguing," he told him, a smile on his face as he tried to reassure him that it was fine.
John and Harry went into the living room as the two talked, "Are you sure you don't want to try and call your friends now instead of later on?" he asked him.
Hello to you all, sorry for being a day late.
"Strange that you of all people would recommend those two Donovan, but yeah, that might work," he nodded as Harry started to wake up, "Can you go and get us both something for breakfast," he asked the woman.
(See the end of the chapter for
"He needs to gather himself, he is basically going to war," John warned as he looked at Sherlock.
Thank you for all the comments and the kudos, you are all so amazing and I adore each and every single one of you!
"The lab at Bart's. Harry and I could do some experiments and I could teach him a few things." Sherlock said, glancing towards Harry, before continuing quietly, "it might take his mind off things. I know he does enjoy it. He is rather curious about things," he finished.
Sherlock nodded, "Yes, though now we have a last name, we might be able to find out what happened and how we can protect him from them. He has told us that he once told a teacher what was going on, but his aunt and uncle were able to make it seem like it was him that was causing the problem. He gave up trying to get away, he has…" he paused trying to find the right word.
I don't own Sherlock or Harry Potter, just having a little fun.
Someone knocked on the door and Lestrade called them in. John walked in first and then Sherlock. It was just past lunchtime and Lestrade had been about to get something for lunch for the two of them.
It didn't take long for Harry to come up and for them all to be sat down. He didn't feel comfortable being with them all, but he just hoped that they would still have him for a little while longer, "What do you need?" he asked them all looking at each of the adults in turn.
"Sherlock?" Harry's voice quivered as he called to the man.
Harry took a breath and limped out of number 4 Privet Drive. He walked through the streets and headed towards the park where he had taken refuge in a number of the time when he needed to get away from his family. Harry winced as his knee gave a twinge of pain as he stumbled a little. He came to the park, but didn't go in, he sat down on the kerb and sighed.
"I'm not their family and I don't consider them mine, to be honest with you. They are people that I had to live with and that was it," Harry replied bluntly.
Mike nodded, "all right then, I'll see about trying to get in touch with them, since I know who they all are," he told him a smile on his face, "now why don't you come and sit down for a while."
"I think it might be best to do that a little later, at the moment I know that Hermione will be on holiday, she goes every summer," he said, though he wasn't sure if she had gone on holiday or not.
"Hi," John said softly, making the child startle a little and grab the dog around his neck and hold him tightly, "it's all right. My names John, I'm a doctor and I work with the police as well," he smiled to him.
"How about we go somewhere?" Sherlock suggested from where he sat at the kitchen table, hoping that it would be able to take Harry's mind from the things that were going on in his life.
"Who is he?" Molly asked, not having heard anything about the teen. Mike and John quickly filled her in, "Ah," she nodded, "you only have temporary custody of him?"
"Thank you," Harry whispered as he heard what Sherlock had said.
Harry nodded his head, "Hello," he smiled to her a little shyly.
"They've found a body, same motive as before. It's our friendly little killer," he said clenching a fist as he felt a thread of anger go through him at the thought of the man that had hurt Mrs Hudson and was trying to find Harry and harm him.
There was a clatter of noise on the floor as the dog came in and settled under the table where Harry was and lay down. John looked to him and smiled a little. Sherlock was doing the same, he had fond memories of his own canine companion when he was a child.
Harry found what he needed and started to cook, he had done it so often that he now did it without the prompt of Aunt Petunia screaming at him to do the breakfast. He cooked what was needed for a Full English for two, not even thinking about doing himself a breakfast, since he normally didn't have one with the Dursley's. He began to dish up as he heard the two men coming to the kitchen.
The man smiled a little, "Names Gary, and you?" hold out his hand.
"Really?" Harry asked perking up at that. He enjoyed spending time with the older man. Sherlock was interesting and took the time to explain things to him when he didn't understand.
"You should go," he told the two of them.
"Fine," Sherlock said as he turned to the teen, "Get up and come with us, we need to get back to Baker Street."
Thank you all for the warm welcome back, love and adore you all.
"My name is Marian, and this is Diane. It has been a while since Harry was brought to the attention of Social Services," one of them said as she looked at Harry, "We have finally been able to sort out a temporary foster home for him to go to. He needs to be properly housed and taken care of by people who know how to deal with a child."
"What do you mean?" Marian asked, her whole demeanor changed as soon as he had spoken.
XxXxX
"Oh Harry, I'm fine, honestly," she smiled to him as she patted his hand.
"Mycroft, what are you doing here?" Sherlock asked as he wandered into the living room and stared at his brother.
John laughed, "Oh that is perfect Harry," he smiled to him, "I think it might be a good thing to make their heads explode, so go change into the suit."
Lestrade smiled at Mycroft, and nodded, "Good, that kid's been through enough by the sound of it."
Well, wedding over and now NaNoWriMo is about to start, be warned, I might not update each week during October and November. I am going to try and do so.
"Your…" green eyes were wide as he looked at them all in turn.
"He's asleep?" Mycroft puzzled as he asked, "Why would he be sleeping, it's the middle of the day?"
John smiled, "Nice to meet you, arry Potter," he said.
"Shut up," he said defensively.
John nodded in understanding as he looked to Sherlock, who was looking at Lestrade shaking his head, "Sherlock?" he frowned.
Sherlock nodded his head and got up, letting John stretch out on the sofa. John smiled his thanks and quickly drifted off. Harry frowned and then began to read the book John had lent him. Sherlock went to the kitchen and began to work on an experiment that he had planned to do a few days ago. Harry's curiosity got the better of him as he put the book down and went into the kitchen and watched what Sherlock was doing.
"Hmmm, shall have to remember that next time I kidnap someone," he joked, relaxing a bit more. He couldn't help but do so, John had that air around him.
"Sherlock!" John called out, giving him a pointed look as Sherlock turned and saw Harry.
"No, I don't need to," Harry said with a frantic shake of his head.
"Don't, I'm all right to sleep here, please," he said with an earnest look on his face.
Thank you for the amazing comments and kudos. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
"This is Harry, he is staying with us for now," Sherlock replied, though there was something in his voice that made Mycroft look at him suspiciously.
John nodded, "Sherlock loves how curious Harry is. And Harry is just happy that Sherlock is willing to explain things to him."
Sorry for taking so long in updating things. Life has been kicking me down for a while, and November was NaNo, which I had fun with.
"I know, but if it makes them explode with jealousy then I am all for it," Harry said with smile, "any bit of payback I can get, I will take it. It's not a nice thing I know, but I have had to stay with them since I can remember and my bedroom before I turned eleven was a cupboard under the stairs."
I don't own Harry Potter or Sherlock, just have some fun while I can.
Sorry for the long wait. Been getting things sorted so I can start updating again. Laptop broke in November. Got it sorted in January, but things were going on. Hopefully I will be back to posting once a week!
Marian straightened up and looked down her nose at Sherlock, "I presume to do so because I know what I am doing. I have been working for Social Services for over twenty years. It is you that has no idea of how to take care of a child," she snorted at him.
Lestrade quickly told Harry that he was going to ask Sherlock and John to take him and keep him safe. Harry was happy inside at the thought, since they had both helped him. Lestrade called Sherlock first and then John when he got no answer. John agreed to stop by at lunch for a talk, Lestrade didn't tell them why he wanted them there. Donovan came back and the two ate breakfast together, with Lestrade going back to work and Harry nosing through a few things, though trying to hide it. Lestrade once again smiled as the thought of the similarities with Sherlock crossed his mind.
"I shall see about tracking them down," Mycroft told the two of them.
Donovan nodded his head, "Sure," she said as she sent a smile to the kid as he looked to her, wariness in his eyes.
"You didn't have too," John smiled and then frowned as he noticed that there were only two plates, "Didn't you make any for yourself?" he asked him as Harry stood by the table.
Harry came out of the kitchen and was watching intently as he saw that John was having a nightmare, he knew the signs as he had seen them in the others boys on occasions. He looked at Sherlock who was calling out to John, telling him he was safe and that all was fine. Sherlock's calling didn't work as John yelled out, sweating, shaking and shot up on the sofa.
Thank you for all the wonderful comments and kudos, you guys are awesome. I do hope that you have enjoyed this chapter.
Mike smiled as he said, "I know, but you're a child and us adults are supposed to make sure that you're safe. I did what I could, now why don't you go back to Sherlock and finish your experiments, it's not a good thing to leave halfway through," he smiled to him.
"Look, Diane, Marian," Lestrade said gaining the attention of the two, "At the moment, Harry needs to be here. We have a serial killer on the loose. At the moment it's quiet, but he is after Harry. Since he witnessed a murder. I know that John and Sherlock are able to protect him and help him with what he saw. So I'm with them, he needs to be here."
Harry ducked his head and then nodded his head a little. John went over to him and knelt down, "I'm really fine," Harry insisted once more.
Harry sat up, Dudley watching him in fear and horror. Harry adjusted the glasses on his face and wiped away some blood that had come from a slight cut on his lip. He stood up, wincing in pain as he moved. He wanted his truck, but knew he wouldn't be able to carry it. His truck flew out of the cupboard from under the stairs as well as the things that he had hidden under the floorboards of his room. All of it flew towards him. He put them in his truck and took out the bag of money he had left over from Second Year. Harry tried to find that ball of energy to shrink his truck. He gave a trembling smile as it worked. He grabbed his wand from cupboard as well and put it away.
Sherlock nodded his head, "yes, the victim is like the others, but this one had time to get away. But for some reason he didn't he remained where he was and was stabbed. He didn't die straight away. It looks as though there was someone else here with him when he died," he told them as he looked to the crime scene once more.
Sherlock smirked and nodded, "Yes, bored, I know, I am the same when John is not here,"
"Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike and I will be your conductor this evening." The man said as he read it from a card and then looked around, "Huh," he frowned as he heard a noise, "Oi," he said as he saw Harry sitting down, "What are you doing down there?" he asked him as he held out his hand and pulled Harry to his feet.
I don’t own Harry Potter or Sherlock, just messing around.
Mike sat back down and pulled out some of his work and started it, making sure that it looked like he had been there for a while. The door to the next room opened and closed and then his opened. A tall man walked in and smiled to Mike.
Sherlock walked over to him and hugged him, "Come away and sit down," he told him as he pulled Harry away.
Harry nodded his head, he didn't really trust anyone. How could he with all that had happened to him? He sighed as he quickly left the room. John and Sherlock watched him go.
John nodded, a flash of something going through his eyes, "Yeah, and only until this case if over with. We have his previous guardians consent to find him a home. So he won't be going back to them," he told her.
Harry gave a small smile back, "I knew he would kill me if he found me," he told him.
Enjoy!
The door to the room opened and the man walked in. Harry watched and waited for the best time and as soon as the man was near the bed. Harry made his move he slipped from the table and out of the still open door and began to run from the room. He went up stairs and through corridors. Not caring where he went as long as he could hide and get away from the man that was after him. Harry couldn't go no further after a while, his body protesting each and every movement. He slipped into one of the room, looking like a classroom. He chose one of the desks at the back and ducked under it and settled down, pulling the stools in front of him so he could remain hidden.
"Can't they deal with it without us going at all, Harry is here alone, Mrs Hudson isn't here with us at all, since she went to go and do a little shopping for us with Mrs Turner," John told him with a shake of his head.
"Yes?" came the almost shrill voice of a woman.
"Harry," he said as he took hold of a hand.
Harry laughed as he was on the floor, "Snuffles, get off," he said as he pushed the dog off and smiled.
Thank you all for the fantastic comments and kudos, you are so amazing!
I've tried my best to edit, as always, but I'm not that good, so sorry for any remaining mistakes.
Harry pushed the arms away as he said, "Sorry, I'm sorry, didn't mean to disturb you. I'm fine," he told them as he pushed John's hand away as he tried to put it on his shoulder, "I don't need help. I'm fine," he said once more.
Sherlock looked to the child and nodded his head, "Yes, four with the man over there."
"Oh you dear sweet boy," Mrs Hudson said as she hugged him tighter. She couldn't help but feel flattered and happy at the words, she had never had children, and only a niece from her sister to spoil. The closest she had got to children were John and Sherlock, and with Harry, to be called grandmother by him, it was wonderful.
"Why don't you go out to dinner and I shall have my men 'redecorate' the living room so that it will no longer be the issue? Make sure to take Mrs Hudson with you as well," Mycroft replied.
"Thank you, I would appreciate it, I have been able to analyse some of the remains on his clothing and I have pinpointed it to Surrey somewhere," Sherlock answered.
Harry nodded, "Okay," he said softly.
Uncle Vernon gave one large kick to Harry and then rushed over to try and keep his sister in the house and not to let her float around Little Whinging.
Harry nodded his head, "All right," he said as he got up, "I'm just going to be in my room till we leave," he told them as he walked upstairs.
"I shall leave him in your… care," Marian said snidely, "But you need to find him a proper home and family soon. If not I shall take that duty for myself." Marian turned and walked out of the room, Diane following behind her as they walked down the stairs and out of the house.
Harry nodded his head, "okay," he said with a little smile, he turned to Mrs Hudson and hugged her tightly, "It's just that when you were hurt it…" he trailed off for a moment, "you are everything I ever imagined a grandmother to be and it was like someone hurt my family and I hated it. I wanted to make sure that you would rest and take it easy and make sure that you were all right," he told her softly, his voice so quiet that the two men in the chairs could only just hear the words.
Thank you for standing by me when I went through a tough time. It means a lot to me to know how patient and understanding you all are, snuggles to you all!
Sorry for not updating yesterday, family were down for most of the day.
"Harry," John called out to the teen as he sat on a chair looking towards the window, an open book that belonged to John sitting on his lap.
"No telling her to go away for a while?" Sherlock said with a little smirk.
"Of course," he nodded his head as someone walked into the room. Mycroft went and talked to them. "Anthea has the footage and she is going through it with several others," he said as the man took the knife in a paper evidence back and left, "The blood will be tested straight away and we will know if it is someone in the database within the day," he told them all.
Hey All
Hope you have enjoyed this chapter and the story so far!
"Vernon!" came the panicked voice of Aunt Petunia.
Thanks go to Madyamisam for the wonderful editing. If there are any mistakes that remain, they belong to me.
Mike laughed and shook his head, he sat and watched the two experiment at one of the benches, "They get along really well don't they?" he asked.
"I do not believe that he has gone to school recently, the things that he should know, he doesn't, but he does ask questions," he explained as he looked at Harry that was now leaning fully against John.
Lestrade smiled back to him and ordered them something to eat, and he went and got it, leaving Harry in the office. They ate and Harry settled down on the sofa, he fell into an uneasy sleep. Lestrade sat at his desk watching him as he began to do a little paper work himself. There was a lot of it, and some for the case that Harry was involved with. He would need to see if he could get the CCTV footage from the hospital and see if they could find the killer on it, get a picture circulated out there and hope someone would be able to recognise him.
This is a bit of an important announcement, so please take the time to read.
"I'll do you something in a bit," John said to the dog as he looked up to him and gave a small woof. John then looked to Harry as he said, "Sherlock and I had a talk last night about Snuffles," he began.
(See the end of the chapter for
I don't own Harry Potter or Sherlock, I'm just having a little fun while I can.
"Morning all," Mycroft said walking inside the living room.
"But Mrs Hudson…" Harry began only to be cut off by a hand on his arm.
I thought I would change this up, there are always so many that have Dumbledore take Harry away from what is now a loving family. Soo, hope you enjoy this little change :D
"I will be going with you, I hope you don't mind. I believe that your suit might be a better choice, show them that you are above them," Mycroft said to Harry.
Lestrade took Harry from Bart's, not signing him out, as he didn't want a trail left behind that someone could trace. He had no clue as to what he should do, Harry was a witness, and it looked like the killer knew about him thanks to someone leaking that there was one to the papers that morning. Lestrade arrived at New Scotland Yard and led Harry to his office.
"I'm sorry, so sorry, you could have ran if not for me. You should have," Harry said as he fell to his knees beside him.
"Then I'll make you some," John said with a shake of his head, he couldn't help but think that this would be normal for the kid, if he did it without even thinking.
Any mistakes are my own, I'm trying my best.
"Yes," he nodded as he got up and walked over to the landing and called out, "Harry can you come up here for a moment we want to talk to you," he told him.
I don't own Sherlock or Harry Potter, just messing around while I have the chance. I do hope you enjoy my fun.
"Come on Kid, getting on?" Stan asked him.
Sherlock and Mycroft followed. Harry was staring at the house, "They are all monsters, they locked me away, make me work all day and then beat me when I can't do what they want. I learned to cook only because they would burn me on the stove if I didn't get it right," he said, he could see people about, able to hear him.
"It will be fine Harry, you are safe here at the moment, Mrs Hudson is going to be here as well and don't forget that you have Snuffles as well," John reassured him as he went over to him, "We also got you this," he said as he held out a mobile phone to Harry.
"Hey," Lestrade greeted the two of them as he gave a small smile.
Love and adore you all!!!!!
"Do you know what else, though. I went to school with burns on my arms," he interrupted her, pulling up his sleeves and showed the few scars that he had on his arms. There were a couple in a circular pattern on his arms. They were faded, but could still be seen., "When I burnt anything while learning to cook, they punished me by pressing my arms to the hob. I went to school with them still hurting and blistered and they didn't believe me when I told them what happened. That my Aunt had called them that morning before I arrived saying that I had put my arms on there and refused to let them take me to the hospital. In reality, I had spent the weekend in the cupboard under the stairs in pain. So I ask you again, where were you then? Where were you when I really needed someone on my side?" he was almost pleading for an answer.
Harry sat in the living room, John was across from him on the sofa and Sherlock was once again in the kitchen, experimenting. Harry had been tempted to go and join him, but he was still feeling nervous about doing so. Even though they had spent a whole night doing nothing but different experiments with Sherlock explaining everything to him. Harry turned a page and smiled as he read his book. John glanced and smiled as he then went back to his own book.
I don't own Sherlock or Harry Potter, just having some fun!
Harry turned to him, eyes wide, "Why would you do that, you don't even know me?" he puzzled.
Sorry for disapering, fatigue plagued me for a week and then a cold, which I am still recovering from.
Harry looked to him his eyes a little fearful as he said, "Please, please can he stay, I know it's a bit of a bother…" he trailed off as John raised a hand to stop him.
"Well, I can't keep calling you dog can I, so how about Snuffles?" he asked wondering what the dog thought of the name. A bark answered him and Harry smiled as he began to limp away from Kings Cross and further into Muggle London. It was almost half hour later that Harry could go no further, he had found an alley that looked safe enough for him for the night and went into it. He settled down at the not that far in and quickly fell asleep with Snuffles sitting with him, keeping worried dark eyes on he teen.
Harry looked up and smiled a little, though it didn't reach his green eyes, "Yeah?"
"I know, but I think you need to do this, you went before and it was all fine," he said with a little smile, he didn't want them to change what they did because he was there, he gave a small cough as he looked to Snuffles, "I have him as well."
"Harry doesn't need you to find him a family, he has seen what family can do to each other. He needs people that will be able to understand what he is going through and will be there to help. I think it is time that people started to listen to him and what he wishes," Mycroft said, "Now I suggest that you leave, you have caused enough upset for one day."
"My name is Sherlock Holmes and I wish to speak with you and your husband concerning your nephew Harry Potter," he said, his voice calm and even.
"We need to go out for a little while, we shouldn't be too long, but we need to go and we can't take you with us," Sherlock said as he looked to the teen. He could see Harry become tense and uneasy.
Hey all!
Snuffles gave a bark, gaining the attention of the whole weird little family. He was happy as he looked at his master and gave another bark as Harry went over to him and ruffled his fur and began to play a little.
Harry shook his head, "I know that, but I know that you have to go, you can't just stay here with me when there is a killer out there wanting to kill again, what if you are able to find out where he is hiding, then you might get him," he started to tell the two of them, "If you don't go then you won't find any of this out and we will still be wondering who he is and where he is," he sighed a little, rubbing a little at his throat.

John nodded his head, he had seen the almost father pride in Sherlock's eyes when teaching Harry something new. John wouldn't mind making the arrangement permanent, but who knew what was around the corner for them. At the moment, John knew that it would be best to keep things the way they were, at least until they caught the killer. Harry was too scared about that to really think about finding a family, and Sherlock and John wanted nothing more that to keep the teenager safe. John sat back and watched the two of them. A happy and content feeling bubbling away inside of John as he, Molly and Mike began to talk again. About recent cases and their current case with Harry, sometimes laughter and small chatter would reached them from the pair working at the bench.
"How much?" Harry asked him.
John smiled, "I know, I'm still the same with them, half the time I do the wrong thing and Sherlock has to sort it out," he chuckled as Sherlock smiled.
"So what did Greg have to say?" John asked him, a flash of irritation going through him.
"Don't you worry about that, grown ups are supposed to care for the kids," he said as his breathing became rough. Harry held his hand as the light faded from his eyes. Harry gave a little sob as he sat there. Snuffles went over to him and pulled at his clothes. Harry followed him back into the alley and settled further in, almost out of sight as he slowly fell into a restless exhausted slumber.
I don't own Harry Potter or Sherlock, just messing around while I have the chance.
"You ran away from home because of what one of them did to you," Sherlock said as he observed the young teen, "That is why you didn't tell them your last name."
"He will be here in around fifteen minutes," he answered him.
Sherlock thought for a moment, he knew that letting Harry go back to them was a bad idea and he didn't want him to end up some home. He looked at John, a silent question in his eyes as the other looked back at him. John gave a smile and a nod, knowing what the other was asking of him.
Hope your week is going well. There are only two chapters left after this one. So close to the end everyone!!!
"I'm going to call Mycroft, have him come here to be with you," Sherlock then said as he pulled out his phone and called his brother.
"Thanks," Harry said as he winced. He made sure to flatten his hair over his scar, not wishing for anyone to know who he was.
"I was in the Army Harry, I know what I can do and what I can't do," John told him a soft smile on his face, "I can really take care of myself as well, we all can, we have all been through things that would have other people cringing in fear," he told him.
John and Sherlock shared a look, they could see that he didn't want them there, "All right, we'll go, but if you do need us for anything, come and get us," John told him as he got up from the edge of the bed and the two went to Sherlock's room.
Harry nodded and then looked to his dog, "What about Snuffles?"
"I don't know either, we have to get through to him that there is nothing for him to feel guilty about," John sighed as Sherlock walked into the room and sat down as well.
"Sherlock," John called from downstairs.
"Would have been a better meeting with tea," John smiled and chuckled.
John gave a little blush, "Things are well. Wasn't in the beginning, but they are now," he said, trying to ignore the look that was on his friends face.
Hello to you all!!!
"What!?" he yelled to her as he stopped lashing out.
"I'll get help," Harry whispered, as he went to try and find someone, but he was called back by a weak call.
Thank you for the wonderful comments and the kudos, you guys are the best ever. I do hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
Harry wasn't that happy about John not being there, even though he was fine with just being with Sherlock. He missed having John there as well. The teen watched Sherlock for a moment before heading over to the table to sit down and watch what Sherlock was experimenting with.
Sherlock gave a little shrug, "Well, I used to think it was the whole 'brilliance requiring an audience' appeal but since I never really cared for others opinions before John that couldn't be it. So, I don't know. He just makes things much more alive and fun."
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock went into the living room, giving Snuffles as ruffle on his head as he stood near him and looked at John, who was sweating and moving around jerkily, "John," he called out, his voice soft and while he wanted to reach for him, he refrained.
Lestrade sighed as he put his pen down and yawned. It was ten in the morning now and he had been awake since six that morning. He had fallen asleep at his desk again last night. He didn't do it often, but often enough that it will kill his back for most of the day. He looked over to the sofa and smiled a little when he saw the teen still fast asleep. The kid had been asleep throughout the night as far as he could tell.
"What ever that freak has done is no business of ours and if you can keep him away from us all the better," she spat out.
"Hey Greg," John greeted and then noticed Harry sitting there, "Hello Harry," he greeted him, puzzled as to why he was there, "Why are you here?" he asked.
Thank you all for the brilliant comments and kudos, you guys are so amazing! (Never ever forget that!)
"Hey, I'm all for it, been saying since the start you two should just get together the UST was killing everyone around you," he grinned as he spoke quietly.
Thank you for the awesome kudos and comments! You guys are the best!!! Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
I do hope you still enjoy this fic even after so long since it was last updated.
"Hello," came a friendly voice as it called out. Footsteps neared where Harry was hiding and a friendly face came into view, "What are you doing here?" he said with a shake of his head, moving the stools out of the way and getting a look at the teen, "I think you need to go back to your room, you don't look well. I'll call someone to come and get you, just tell me your name."
Harry went a little pale and shook his head, "No, it's really not a good idea and it might put people in danger and I don't want to do that," he said quickly.
"No, but I can tell that you are not one to lie down and wait for death, you will fight and I know that my brother and John wouldn't have taken you in if they didn't care, no matter how much one of them would protest it," he said smirk on his face as he looked at his brother.

Hey all, here is another new chapter for you all to enjoy!
Out of the shadows came a large black dog, it growled at those that were there. John moved a little and pulled Sherlock back before he could enter the animals territory. He looked further into the alley and could see a shape of a person, a child further down. He looked to the canine and understood.
Sorry for taking so long, been busy with life and things. I will now be updating every Sunday from now on.
"Bring some of the footage here as well," Sherlock said as he wanted to help, "I don't like the thought of him not being here," he then said softly to John.
Mrs Hudson climbed the stairs as Harry went about dusting and polishing everything around him. She went into 221B and over to the sofa and sat down. John looked at her and Sherlock looked into the living room from where he was in the kitchen.
Hello to you all!!
Sherlock smiled, getting up and the two of them headed into the living room, "Harry," Sherlock called to him.
Hi all, sorry for being away for so long. I ended up with a cold and I'm still fighting a chest infection that really doesn't want to go.
"Seeing my brother and maybe soon to be brother in law," went over to John's chair and sat down, "Is that a crime?" he asked him, the smirk dancing on his lips.
"And he won't give us that if he doesn't trust us to keep it to ourselves," John sighed as he leaned against Sherlock.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I believe we should…" he trailed off.
"John," he said with a sigh, "That kid has been starved, he dehydrated as well. We have him on a drip as you have seen. He has bruised ribs, sprained wrist. His knee on his right side has been bruised badly, so it'll hurt him to walk for a while. Poor kid, being in here on his birthday as well," he said with a shake of his head.
"You will be in our care for a while. I know not ideal but so far Sherlock hasn't started shooting the walls with you around so… good thing for us too, yeah?" John joked though there was a look on his face that Sherlock could easily read.
Sorry for not updating yesterday, I had a bad fall. I’m okay, just feeling really bruised and a sprained ankle.
"He can't trust people," Sherlock said as he observed Harry's behaviour, "He was abused John, before he ran away. We need to find out who they were, we need his last name."
"But John is a doctor and knows that you have to rest a little," he told her.
"Hmmm," Sherlock hummed, "Yes, it might be a problem, I'll stay up tonight to keep an eye on him.""
John smiled with how Harry was trying to keep it all together and not to show that he was scared. He guided over to the sofa and let him sit between himself and Sherlock. Mycroft looked at them and smiled as he pulled out his phone.
"How though, you would think that even without him we are doing the same things as though he was here with us?" Harry asked, puzzled.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Look at me Harry," she said softly as he looked at her, "I'm a tough old bird, and don't you forget it," she smiled.
Sherlock seeing that he was now with the present went to the sofa and gathered John in his arms. John held him back just as tightly. The two of them held each other tightly as Sherlock whispered to him, saying everything was alright. It took a little while, but John calmed down and was finally feeling a little more normal. It was then that the two of them saw Harry.
"Yes, I would prefer if you did, since you have seen the killer here now, I do not believe it will be safe to leave you alone without someone here with you," Sherlock told him.
"Now, I think you need to go and talk to the Surrey office and see what they have to say. Someone messed up somewhere and you need to get to the bottom of it. Sherlock and I are doing well enough with Harry, he is happy and safe. And that is what he needs at the moment," John told the two women.
"No Harry, we brought it for you to keep. You may need it if we are not here, or you want to go out for a bit on your own. Regents Park isn't far," John told him. He had been surprised that the time Harry had been there he hadn't been tempted to leave the flat at all. He was a little reluctant when it came to shopping as well, constantly looking over his shoulder. John didn't think it was just because of what he had seen or what had happened, it looked like a long time habit.
"Thank you Mycroft," John smiled as he looked at Harry as he felt his head lean against him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"But I need to know John, we have a killer to find, he has already killed four people," he said as he looked to his friend who was checking the young teen over.
I don't own Harry Potter or Sherlock, just having a bit of fun.
Donovan walked in and frowned as she saw the hair and the coat on the sofa, she looked over to her superior and asked him, "What's going on?"
"Rather well put," Mycroft said, looking a little proud of the way Harry had handled himself.
"Sorry," John smiled to her, "Oh, and Harry, this is Mrs Hudson, she's out landlady, and she will remind you that she is not our housekeeper," he said, as he looked back to Harry.
John looked over to him and shook his head, "No, Sherlock," he said, frowning, "it would be better to get him something that he could wear all the time, suits just aren't practical."
"That's good. I know Sherlock don't really want anything to eat, we did have breakfast a little later than normal. Not only that, but we are somewhat on a case so he won't eat much on principle. Took me half hour to get him to eat this morning. But I don't really want Harry picking up his bad habits," he joked.
Lestrade nodded, "Right, if you can send that to me as well. I'll have a look as well. I know, I might not find anything, but it doesn't hurt to have it on file either. I'll see you all soon, and take care of him," he finished, gesturing to the stairs.
XxXxX
I don't own Sherlock or Harry Potter. I'm having fun and I might give them back when I am done with them, but no telling in what condition.
"Someone might have witnessed this?" Greg asked the man.
"They pride themselves on being normal, I just let people know they aren't," he said, "petty I know, but my own revenge," he added as he looked at the window.
"Good idea with that one," Tony joked a little as he then left.
"Mrs Hudson," John called out gently as he began to look her over.
"I think that went well, there is still some guilt, but he doesn't feel as bad," Sherlock said as he looked at John as he began to bring things out to make lunch.
Sherlock looked up from where he was sat at the desk in the living room. Mycroft had sent them information about Harry, which he had been able to find out. He had found the family and had been able to survey them over night. They didn't appear at all concerned for their nephew. Sherlock couldn't even figure out how Harry was related to them, as he looked nothing like them. It was mid afternoon and he glanced at his phone as it buzzed.
"It will, I'll make sure of that," John said with a smile as he went into the bedroom for a few moments and came back out, "Now, shall we get ready to go?" he asked.
Harry watched as Sherlock protested taking Harry once again. He felt horrible that once again he wasn't wanted. He pulled his legs up onto the sofa and wrapped his arms around them and made himself as small as he could.
Back from Alcon, and I really enjoyed myself.
"Like Hell, I will you great berk. Someone needs to put food on the table and I do sometimes need a break from you."John chuckled and shook his head, "Although I do understand why that would be case."
"What you asked for, there is someone there, we are trying to track him now," she added as she gave a nod to the two other men, a slight frown when she saw Harry and then walked out again.
John watched Sherlock and Harry with a smile on his face, only to burst out laughing when one of the reactions made Harry jump back in shock. He glanced out of the corner of his eye and could see Molly was still waiting for him to say something, "I don't. It might be hard with what Sherlock and I do for a living. I've not even gone to the clinic to work in over a week because I don't want Harry to be alone in the flat if Sherlock gets called out. I know that Sherlock would be fine being alone with Harry, but with this… this killer after Harry. It could be dangerous."
"Lestrade," Sherlock greeted back with a nod. He then walked past him and over to the body that was lying on the pavement. It wasn't a busy area, but enough that a few people were milling around trying to see what was going on. John went and stood by Lestrade and watched.
"She is all right. I just want her to rest a while, no concussion by what I can see, just a couple of bruises," he answered him.
John sat down and tried to pull him into his arm, wanting to comfort the scared teen, "Harry," he said gently, "It's all right."
I don't own BBC Sherlock or Harry Potter, just messing around while I have the chance.
They could both see that Harry was upset about what he had found and he knew that he saw guilt in the teens eyes as well. Harry went over to Mrs Hudson and sat down on the floor beside her. He looked at the woman and smiled a little.
Harry nodded, "Yeah, I'm fine, just…" he trailed off with a shrug.
Vernon got up as soon as he saw the teen and stalked towards him, he raised his hand about to hit him as John moved and had the fat lump pinned to the nearest wall and none too gently as well, "I believe it would be best if you didn't do such a thing Dursley," John snapped at him as he pushed the arm higher causing him to squeal in pain.
"What about them?" the teen asked looking back at him.
"I think he might be correct, you're not a mother at all, no mother would do that to any child whether their own or not," John said with a shake and then he walked out after Harry.
"Yes," he said with an honest nod. He had some toast, something simple.
Thank you for the awesome comments and kudos, so happy that people are enjoying reading this. I do hope have enjoyed this chapter as well.
Thank you for your kind wishes and such. The October after mum passed away my grandmother passed as well. Both ladies were two that encouraged my writing. So it had been hard to go back to old things.
"John," he took a shuddering breath, "I… he was out there John, outside on the pavement across the road. He was watching this window. He knows I'm here," he whimpered he turned to the window again, he was still shaking but he needed to find him.
John smiled and the two began to talk and not just about cases and politics, but the more mundane things in life. Harry slept on for a while as Sherlock sulked in the kitche, until Harry woke and joined him.
"Boys," came a friendly call as an elderly woman walked in, "Oh you must be Harry, the boys told me about you," she said softly as she walked over to him and then noticed that the two men were arguing with each other.

"Anthea is already going through the last few minutes of footage to see what we can find. We are going to be tracking all that have been near this street," he told them, there was worry evident in his voice and eyes as Sherlock and John looked to him, "Snuffles was hurt, but the vet said he was fine and just needed to sleep things off," he said as he pointed to the dog sleeping in his bed.
Thanks to Madyamisam who went through this chapter, any remaining mistakes are my own.
Hey all, I am sooooo sorry for the long wait for an update. I was only going to take a week off. But things happen and my mind just noped out of everything. I'm only back for a week, as April is Camp NaNoWriMo and I plan to take part and try and use the month to write for the fics that I need to update.
Harry smiled to him and nodded, "thank you sir," he told him, grateful that he would be somewhat safe that night.
"Fine," he huffed as he got up and went back to the kitchen.
Harry smiled back, "I trust you, just don't…" he trailed off as he turned back to the window and looked out.
"I think we do all right," John said as he looked at Marian and took a seat on the sofa, "At this moment in time he is happy and safe, and that is all that matters. Though we do have something that we need to show you," he said reaching the desk and plucking the papers that they had the Dursley's sign, "Here, his guardians have relinquished their rights to us."
"All right then, if you remember a way to contact them then do so, I bet they are finding it worrisome that you have contacted them yet," John said as Sherlock came back into the room. He looked to him and asked, "so what did Mycroft say?"
John thought for a moment, "Yeah, that might be a nice idea. I think he will enjoy it."
"Do I have to go with you?" Harry asked, fear lacing his voice even though he was trying to hide it once more.
Only one more chapter after this..... wow!
Sherlock stood up and grabbed a blanket and draped it over him and sat back down. John smiled at him and made sure that it covered the teen. Mycroft watched them and he could see that the two of them were beginning to care for the teen past just protecting him from a killer. They were beginning to care for him as though he was family. He may have to get involved in sorting things out.
Hello to you all!!!
(See the end of the chapter for
"But they would be better for people to take him seriously, I should know," he huffed back.
"Hey," came a voice from behind him.
Hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well!
Hey all, sorry for not updating last week. I was on holiday and was able to visit Stonehenge, which was amazing!
"So far from what we have seen of him, he is intelligence and has done well in protecting you. I believe that it would be best if he were to remaining with you and protect you when we are not here," Sherlock told him, a small smile on his face as the dog gave a loud bark, making Harry and John both jump at the sudden noise.
"Hmmm," Sherlock nodded, "I think you should contact them soon to tell them what is going on," he said softly as it was the first time that Harry had mentioned someone outside of his family.
They walked back to Baker street and opened the door to a sight that made their hearts drop. John rushed over to Mrs Hudson who was lying on the floor near her flat. Harry looked around, instantly on alert, just as Sherlock was as well.
"Any other friends that you can talk to or tell them what is going on?" John asked him, a little curious as to why he had never mentioned them before.
"I don't know, I can see that this whole case bothers him but with Mrs Hudson being attacked? He feels guilty enough about even being in this situation. He seems to have taken everything that has happened so far well, but with his nightmares and now this? Kids got more issues that you and I put together." he answered him, a worried look on his face.
"Sure, how have things been since Sherlock came back. It's been four months now," he asked him, a little curious as he hadn't spoken much about it during their meet ups at the pub.
He shook his head, "I…" he trailed off, not knowing what he could say.
"You're not going to hurt me are you?" Harry asked the dog, feeling a little stupid about asking, but he felt that the canine would be able to understand him.
"Harry, we decided that he could stay," John said smiling to him, shaking his head a little.
Sherlock looked around the room, "he fought hard," he said as he looked at the disarray. He smiled a little as he saw the knife that had penned letters to the mantle was missing, "Oh well done Harry," he said as he noticed the knife on the floor and saw the blood on it, "Harry cut our dear killer, so far we've had no DNA on the scenes, this might change with this little bit, Mycroft can you get someone to test it?" he asked as he pointed to the knife.
"We shall see if we can get through to him," he told him as they got ready for bed and climbed in.
"Sherlock feels the same, you can tell," she said softly, glancing over to the two, "Sherlock is standing close like he does with you. But it's a little different, more how a father would be with their son when teaching him something," she smiled.
Thanks go to Madyamisam for the editing, all remaining mistakes are my own.
Thank you all for the wonderful comments and kudos! You are all soooo amazing. Hope you have enjoyed this chapter and the story so far!
"Yesterday, the killer we are after targeted him, so I brought him here. I know, I should have contacted social services, but it scared the hell out of him that I gave in and just let him sleep there. I was going to go home and let him have the sofa there, but I ended up falling asleep too," Lestrade said with a shake of his head.
Harry nodded his head, he didn't think he would send them a text, or even call them. He didn't like relying on people, adults especially, since they usually didn't care what happened to him. He looked to the two of them and thought for a moment as he watched them leave, reassuring him once more. They had helped, and tried to last night. Mike Stamford had done the same as well as Lestrade. Harry couldn't help but wonder if he had found people that could actually help instead of just ignore him.
Chapter Thirteen
Harry nodded his head and went back to Sherlock. John watched Harry and Sherlock begin their experiments again. He smiled as he walked over to Mike. John was thankful for the help that Mike had given Harry.
Harry talked with Stan about the recently escaped Sirius Black. Harry knew he would be all right in he Muggle world. The black dog sat next to Harry on the floor, just about keeping his feet as the bus hurtled around London, letting of one or two passengers before they reached Kings Cross Station. Harry got off with the dog.
"Yesterday afternoon the killer went to the hospital to try and find him. Harry had the good sense to run and hide. Mike found him, the killer was going around saying he was looking for his brother. Mike knew he was lying and made sure Harry was hidden when he went into Mike's classroom to search. Called me after the man was gone and Harry came here with me," Lestrade told them quickly what had happened.
"How is Mrs Hudson?" Sherlock asked him quietly.
"How are you able to sleep through all that's just happened? How can you not have nightmares?" he wondered as he heard a soft knock on the door, "Come in," he called out, wincing a little, hoping he hadn't woken Harry.
Harry grinned, "Good, about time people found out that the things that were being damaged around there weren't me."
Sherlock grinned, "Appreciated and in return for the favour, I'll try to convince John to 'not' lambaste you with his brand of Scottish rhetoric during an important Parliamentary meeting." he retorted as he went into the living room ending the call, "We are going to go out for dinner," he announced.
John looked to him and smiled, "We don't need to , but we should. You don't have anything, and you can't keep wearing the same clothes all the time."
John and the other others nodded as they all went quiet.
"Change her back!" Uncle Vernon yelled as he rained punches and kicks down on Harry. Harry said nothing as he tried to protect himself from the blows.
"Yes please," he said taking Sherlock's empty chair. John's usual chair had been taken up by Harry, who had barely looked up from his book.
Lestrade had been kind enough to take them back to Baker Street with the siren blaring away and the lights flashing. Sherlock and John ran up the stairs to the living room to see Mycroft in there talking on his phone. He saw them and put it away.
Thank you for the amazing comments and kudos, I do hope you have enjoyed this chapter as well.
Sherlock came over and saw it as well, he looked at Harry and whispered reassuringly to him, "It's all right Harry," he looked around a little more.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Why have you come by this time?" Sherlock asked him.
Harry wasn't too sure that he would be able to stay with them, one didn't want him that was for sure. The other was nice, kind, he felt safe with him. He looked out of the window and watched as the streets went by. It didn't take long for them to stop by a small cafe and for them all to get out. John paid the fare as Sherlock entered 221.
Harry looked between the two of them as he ate the last of the egg and shook his head, "You don't need to do that," he told them.
"This was never a home, more like a prison with a fat lump for a son and a fat abusive bastard for a husband. I can't even see how my mother was ever related to you, you're a bitch," Harry said, "I have to wonder what my grandparents would say if they could see you, I bet they would be rolling around in their grave," he told her as he turned and walked out of the house.
"I know, but I just can't think of how to do so," she told them both.
Sherlock could see the sadness that clung to the man and he stood up once more and walked around the table. He walked up behind John and wrapped his arms around his waist and pulled him against him, leaning his chin on John's right shoulder. John relaxed into him. He didn't know how to bring up what he was thinking, not knowing if Sherlock would be all right with his suggestion. Sherlock placed a kiss on his cheek as he said, "We shall talk when we have this killer locked up, we have to ask Harry what he wants to do," he told him softly.
John went over and coaxed the teen to his feet, "He'll be alright Greg," he called to the man as they quickly followed Sherlock out of the Yard and to a taxi.
"Yeah so do I," John agreed with him.
I don't own Harry Potter or Sherlock, just having a bit of fun.
Harry looked between the two of them as they argued back and forth about getting him suits or more casual clothing. He was beginning to feel a little nervous as they carried on bickering, their voices never raising over the talking level as they tried to show each other why the other was wrong and their were right. Harry got up and moved away from the table as he heard someone coming up the stairs.
John went over to one of the benches and sat down on a stool. He smiled as he watched the two of them. Chemistry wasn't John's strongest subject, but he still enjoying experimenting when he was in those classes. These days, he enjoyed watching Sherlock. It was twenty minutes later that the door opened and Mike walked in.
John turned to Greg and said, "Can you call an ambulance, I think he needs to be seen to properly, I think he only has bruised ribs and a few others bad bruising, but I think X-rays are needed to make sure," he then turned back to Harry.
"We can only do something when we learn and are told that something is wrong with a family or child," Diane told him gently.
XxXxX
John and Sherlock looked to Harry and the could see that he had been affected by what they had done. They gave each other a glance as John then got up and went over to him.
"Okay," he announced with a smile as he put Snuffles back on the lead.
"Harry," was the childs reply.
"I know, that is what I told Lestrade but he is insistent that we come and see, he said that the body is fresh, so it hasn't been there that long," he told John as he looked up to see Harry in the doorway of the kitchen.
They left the flat and headed to St Bart's, it didn't take long for Sherlock to lead them to one of the labs. Harry's eyes went wide as he looked around, it was the same one that he had hidden in when he was at the hospital. He quickly told them that and they smiled reassuringly, they could see the nervousness and the reminder of what had nearly happened to him. Sherlock began to gather the equipment that they would need and started to set up, explaining things as he went..
Enjoy!
"Oh, did you have lunch?" John asked him, he had mentioned to him to make sure he had something to eat if they didn't get back in time.
They got out of the taxi and walked over to Lestrade, they had only been there for a few minutes when Sherlock's phone began to ring. Annoyed he picked it up and answered it, "What do you mean?" he said making John and Lestrade look to him, "We're on our way back," he then looked to John as he put his phone away, "Harry is missing."
"Hi Mike," John said with a wave of his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock shook his head, "Don't need to," he said as he took one of the many slices of toast that Harry had made and began to nibble on it.
Enjoy the chapter.
Thanks go to Madyamisam for beta reading this, any remaining mistakes are my own.
"Harry, you have a killer after you that has now killed again," Sherlock began to explain, "I do not like the thought of you being here on your own, it could be dangerous for you."
'I will get you, be warned!'
"I know, he's gone now, must have when he saw you come up behind me," he said, with a sigh. Harry looked down to his hands and clenched them tightly, they were shaking. His knees felt wobbly as well.

I wasn't well yesterday, headache and chest pain from over strained muscles. Feeling somewhat better today. So have a chapter!
"About two years ago I had to fake my death, leaving Mrs Hudson and John to think that I was dead. I returned just over nine months ago, they forgave me after a while, but I did it for them. Because of a criminal that I was trying to bring down, he targeted them, would have them killed along with Lestrade if I didn't. It was hard and I did it to save them. And I'm still here and they are still beside me even though I could have caused their deaths," Sherlock told him as he reached out a hand for John, it still hurt John to think about it, even though he had forgiven him, it still hurt.
"How about we take Snuffles for a walk," Sherlock suggested as he looked at the teen.
"She's going out of the patio doors, stop her!" she exclaimed as she tried to pull Aunt Marge into the dinning room once more.
"Sher… Sherlock," he said with a shuddering breath as his eyes calmed and his slouched, still shaking.
"Yes," Sherlock agreed with him, a look of distaste on his face.
Mycroft nodded his head as someone walked into the living room, "Ah Anthea," he smiled as she handed him a disk.
Thank you all for the awesome comments and kudos! I do hope you are all still enjoy this fic!!
Harry looked down to his plate and sighed, "I…" he said as he trailed off, he didn't know how he could tell them that he would be able to get his own when he went back to Hogwarts, or before he went back to Hogwarts.
Harry went with him over to his desk and sat down. He was about to say something when he heard a noise from outside of the room. The door to the next room opened and they could hear someone walking out. Harry's instincts told him that it was the man, and he learned to trust them over the years. He looked around for somewhere to hide. Mike moved and let him hide under his desk, since there was a back to it so no one could look, and it reached the floor so there would be no way to tell that someone was under there.
Sherlock looked to the animal and could see an intelligence there that he had never seen in dogs before, "he will be fine, if he comes to where I live I will make sure that my landlady will leave a little food out for him when he comes."
Hello all, here is another chapter for you to read. I do hope you enjoy it.
Thank you for the wonderful comments and kudos, I do hope you will enjoy this chapter as well.
"Thank goodness they are gone," Lestrade grinned turning to them all, "They were beginning to get on my nerves with harassing me about seeing Harry. Anyway, I heard he saw him again?"
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry walked into the kitchen. It was nearing dinner time, in an hour. Sherlock was the only other person in the flat, though Mrs Hudson was downstairs in her own room. John had been called in to take a shift at the clinic. They were down two doctors after a wave of patients with stomach flu was coming in. Sherlock just hoped he wouldn't bring it back with him.
Chapter Fourteen
John nodded his head and with a steely look on his face marched back into the living room to join the others. Then he froze when the rush of words that came from the consulting detective's mouth registered in his head. "In-law?" he gawped. He turned around to ask Sherlock about what he had just heard but the man was already engrossed in conversation with his older sibling
"I'll show you quickly before we leave," Sherlock said as he stepped towards him and knelt down. He showed Harry how to use the phone, to get in touch with the two of them in case he needed anything. He stood up and said, "Don't worry, we will be back, and you can always send us a text. We will answer it if we are free to do so, a call to us means that you need us right away, understand?"
"There is another family, but I don't know if they will be able to get in contact with me, they can be a little old fashioned at times, I don't think they have a phone and I know that they live in Cornwall somewhere, but not where," he said, not sure what he could tell them about the Weasley family without it seeming like they were odd, well there were by Muggle standards Harry knew that.
"No, he can have mine," Sherlock said frowning towards Harry a little and told him, "Sit down Harry," he then passed the plate towards him as soon as the teen was sitting down.
XxXxX
"Please listen to him Mrs Hudson, I don't want you becoming ill or something because you didn't," Harry told her as he took one of her hands.
Chapter Eleven
"Anthea, please have the CCTV footage from outside of Baker Street pulled. I want to know if there is anyone staring at my brothers flat," he said and nodded a few times, "As soon as possible Anthea and bring a copy here," he finished as he then hung up and put the phone away.
Diane and Marian couldn't answer the question. They didn't know how to answer and made Harry see that he needed to be in a proper home that would be able to help him.
"Why would that be?" he asked, he knew that there was more to it than that.
Chapter Sixteen
Sherlock and John had taken notice of the morose mood and had wondered what had caused it. It was coming up to lunchtime, but food was the last thing on their minds since they had a late breakfast. Sherlock looked at John as Harry walked past them and into the living room. The teen sat down and pulled a book that he had been reading towards him and opened it up.
"He had a nightmare last night, woke up around two, in the end he came down and joined me in the kitchen for a few experiments, though it took coaxing to get him to come in again," Sherlock smiled.
Sherlock went past them and up the stairs, Harry following him, since he didn't like the thought of Sherlock being alone. Sherlock looked around and Harry was doing the same as well. He froze when he saw it, there was a message on the wall over the fireplace.
"Damn," John said with a sigh as he looked to the door for Harry's room, "What about family and that?"
"Boys!" she called out loudly. The sharp word got their attention and she shook her head at them, "You should know better than to argue like that in front of a child," she scolded them.
Harry nodded his head, "yes Sir."
Hope you have enjoyed this chapter and the story so far!
"I have no idea what I should do, social services need to be told," he said to the teen as he sat down at his desk.
Hey all, here is another chapter for you!
(See the end of the chapter for
"I don't know where though. It there anywhere that could be safe for him?" John questioned quietly, turning away from the sink as he dried his hands after washing up.
"We can…" Diane began once more.
Mrs Hudson nodded, "Yes, that might help a little," she smiled.
"Thanks," he smiled to her.
"No, please no, I can't. If I go there then he'll find me, he'll kill me, I know he will. He did it to the others as well," Harry said as he shook his head, begging the man not to call anyone to come and get him.
"He is up in his room, he is going back to a place that has basically been a prison to him for all his life, he needs to gather the courage to go and see them again after what ever it is that drove him away," John told him as he got up and called Harry down.
John nodded and went over to the young teen and looking him over, wanting to make sure that he had done nothing to aggravate any of his injuries, "Okay, you're okay," he smiled to the teen, "Though you really need to take it easy, you need to rest for a few more days before you go running around. Though good thinking on hiding from the guy," he said a smile on his face as he looked to Harry.
John nodded, "I know, I think he is used to doing things alone," he sighed.
This story is finished and I will be updating it once a week on a Wednesday baring anything else happening. There is a total of 34 chapters and we have around 10 chapters to go after this one is up.
Harry had done all the laundry and had even ironed their clothing as well as put it all away. He had been at it since the moment he had woken up. He had to do something to make it up to them for all the danger that he had brought into their lives. Mrs Hudson could have really been hurt, and it would have been all Harry's fault.
Here is the promised chapter 17, Enjoy!
Thank you for all the awesome comments and kudos, love and adore you all. Hope you've enjoyed this chapter as well!
"Let him go and tell us what the hell you want we don't want him," Petunia yelled, well more like screeched.
Donovan looked to the kid that had rolled over a little, the coat falling down to reveal his face. She looked a little closer and saw a scar on his forehead, "Who would do such a thing to a kid," she murmured as she saw that it was too clean to have been caused by an accident.
John nodded his head, even though he knew that they would be staying awake all night he couldn't help but worry, he had noticed that Harry hadn't seemed as bright as he usually was, he didn't seem well. He sighed and leaned against Sherlock. Around them people were coming and going, he dreaded having to tell Mrs Hudson when she came back that Harry was missing. They were busy all night, with footage being watch and people being tracked.
Thank you all for the amazing comments and kudos!!! Love and adore you all!
"It's Harry Potter, he announced for the first time his full name.
"Fine," she grumbled as she opened the door and let them in, "I've heard of you, Mr. Holmes," she glanced at Sherlock and led them into the living room where her husband and son were sitting watching TV, "Vernon, they brought him back," she sneered as she looked at where Harry was standing.
Chapter Ten
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry nodded his head and grabbed his light jacket, he loved the fact that he had clothes that now fit him. Harry would have to get new robes for when he went back to school. He had grown a bit, and would no longer fit. It was another thing that he needed to do. Sherlock grabbed his suit jacket and put it on, it was too hot for the Belstaff.
Sherlock went down and helped John bring Mrs Hudson up the stairs to their flat. John didn't want her to go to her own room as he needed to keep an eye on her. She didn't look to bad a little bruised, but he knew that she had been through a lot more than that.
Hope your week is going well!
Chapter Fifteen
"Right," he replied with a smile. He looked at Harry who was looking between the two of them.
"I can see that you're hurt, would it be all right for me to look you over?" John asked him softly.
“First of all, I don’t think making a stink bomb is part of the national school curriculum either and secondly, are you saying that he doesn’t have any secondary education at all?”
Sherlock almost groaned at the prospect of meeting with his overbearing elder sibling, but instead he gave a sigh, "Mycroft is coming over," he warned John.
Snuffles ears picked up as he heard something disturb the background noise of Sherlock and Harry quietly talking. He opened his eyes as he heard it again. A small slight whimper came once again as he stood up and looked towards John. Sherlock stopped talking as he heard the restless movements and heavy breathing begin for John. He knew what was going to happen and he didn't want to let his boyfriend wake up like that again.
I don't own Harry Potter or Sherlock, I'm just having a little fun while I can.
"Thanks," John said to Mike, with a smile as he sat down on the stool near Mike's desk.
"You don't," John told him, "What Sherlock and I do brings danger into this house all the time. We've had assassins in here a lot, the CIA has turned up once too, and we have all came out of things that you could only begin to imagine," he said with a little shudder.
Harry put aside the tray and looked around the room he was in. He was still surprised to be in there, especially after the police had finished their talk with him. He thought he would be in a ward when everything was over, but that hadn't happened. Harry was beginning to get a little bored, there was nothing for him to do, he wasn't into watching TV like a lot of teens, he preferred to read.
"I can't get him to stop, and he doesn't say anything, just asks if there is anything else, and if I don't tell him he will just go and find something himself, that's how he ended up doing the windows and the laundry," she gave a sigh, she had never known a teen that able to do housework. Sherlock was hopeless at it, and even John didn't clean up like Harry did, and they were both adults.
"Too late for that kid, glad you're safe," he gasped out with a small smile on his face.
"Good," he said with a nod, "because this man has made a serious error of judgement here.".
"John good to see you, and you as well Sherlock," he said as he then saw Harry, "Ah Harry, how are you lad?" he asked the young teen.
Sherlock just nodded to him and lay down on the sofa and disappeared into his mind palace. Harry watched him in fascination. John just shook his head and began to make some lunch, making something up for the dog as well. Seems they would have a full house for a while.
John nodded to himself as he saw Sherlock and Mycroft exchange a silent conversation. He rolled his eyes . Mycroft could tell that there was more to the teenager and Sherlock had just confirmed that something more was going on than him just witnessing a murder. He nodded his head once more as he gave a silent word to Sherlock that he will do his best to help keep him from a family that had harmed him.
Thank you all for the awesome comments and kudos, so happy so many of you are enjoying this fic!

John frowned as he asked, "Do you think that would be wise?"
Sherlock and John were in the living room. Neither of them had slept that well, even after turning in early. They had woken several times, each time they had gone upstairs to check on Harry, finding him asleep, but restless. Harry had been quiet for most of the morning. They didn't like the thought of leaving him alone but they had no choice. They had found a small lead on another case that they had been working on before being called in with Lestrade. They needed to track it down and make sure that they were hearing things right as it might mean an innocent man was being framed.
"I believe I shall go as well, work never stops," Mycroft said as he gave an incline of his head to his brother, "And make sure to take care of those two," he added, getting a smile from John as he left.
"He witnessed a murder at the end of last month, he is staying with us because we can protect him," John answered as he came back in with the tea for the four of them, "The killer is after him, so everyone thought it would be the best solution."
