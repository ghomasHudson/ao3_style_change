Dean gently shook Castiel awake as they pulled into ‘The Delight Motel’ (Dean could already tell from its crumbling exterior that this would
“I don’t see why not, considering it says here that the experiment was ‘technically’ a success… just not in the way this poor lad was expecting…” Rowena tells them, handing the spell back over to Sam – much to Eileen’s relief. “Except…”
Dean reached a hand into his jacket pocket, sliding out his phone and swiping a thumb across its screen to turn it on. The clock on his home screen blinked back
“Possibly. Unless the reason is my second theory; that this is all a result of my diminished grace. The closer I am to being human, the more human abilities I will adopt – senses being one of them. This no longer tastes like ‘molecules’ anymore. I can feel the warmth as it slips down my throat. I can taste the hints of honey and cinnamon and… I believe that may be apple?”
“Don’t be an idiot, Dean Winchester,” Castiel cut him off, but there’s no malice to his voice as he does it. In fact, the small pull of a smile at the corner of his mouth widens to a gummy smile that Dean knows means this is a
dead after making such a confession. Easier to pretend it never happened than confront it – at least, that was Dean’s personal motto. Plus, with all they have on their plates (again….), it was probably pushed to the back of both their minds.
He didn’t wanna die alone. He’s died many times before, countless times if you counted all the ‘experiments’ with Gabriel… but in all of them, he was never alone. Sammy was always there, his last source of comfort as the last of his life ebbed away. A familiar, comforting face. His little brother, whilst understandably distressed,
But that wasn’t enough. Sure, it was of some comfort knowing that the prayer had at least reached Cas, but… but something didn’t sit right with him about that. Besides the fact that what he said is something that really should be said face to face (and maybe sending a message like that over the prayer is the equivalent of sending it over text message or… or voicemail?), Cas’s reaction was just… not what he was expecting. Not that Cas was ever entirely predictable in his reactions, and perhaps basing what Cas’s reaction would be on what
Cas chases him out into the hallway, grabbing ahold of Dean's shoulder and spinning him around to face him. Dean's annoyed expression briefly turns to shock when Castiel pushes him back against a wall, though the agitated look is quick to return once he realises that Castiel is pinning him there.
Actually, he did. It was a park near to Stanford that Sam dragged him to for one of his ‘morning runs’. Dean hated every second of it.
“You don’t have to say it,” Castiel interrupts, that tentative smile back on his face. “I heard your prayer.”
And maybe that’s why… that’s why he can’t take it back. It’s why he can’t just apologize, tell Cas that he didn’t mean it, that it was a moment where he wasn’t thinking right. And that right there was the problem. He
once tried hunting them. One of them managed to get ahold of Dean and it… it shoved Dean into a rebar.”
“Bit of a funny story,” Gabriel said, swinging an arm over Sam’s shoulders. Well, as far as he could reach, anyway. “Why don’t I tell you it over some coffee, hm? My treat. We’ll leave these lovebirds to it.”
“Far from it,” Castiel answered, wondering if Dean was looking at him behind the darkness of his shades. “Not many prisoners get to go on a beach vacation.”
“Hmmm…” Sergei hummed in interest. “I wonder; do you say that as a declaration of accomplishment, or as taking the blame?”
He laughs in that way that almost sounds like you’re crying. Head ducked down, shoulders shaking with every rushed snort. Cas, for the most part, looks mildly perturbed by this sudden mood change; likely wondering if he had somehow managed to knock a screw loose as he healed him.
of us want. But we both know that the crap going down right now is bigger than what you, or me, or Sammy, or
“I’ll give you two a minute,” Sam said through his chuckles, backing out from the doorway and disappearing down the hallway. “Breakfasts waiting – don’t let it go cold!”
“Yeah. Not that I blame him, but… sleeping has never really been a peaceful thing for either of us, you know? Sometimes I can hear him shouting from across the hall on particularly bad nights. All the bad stuff that’s happened to us, memories of Hell… it’s a weird way to escape.”
Claire and Dean shared knowing smiles before Claire unlinked her elbow from Cas, leaning up on her tiptoes to plant a kiss on his freshly shaven face before taking her spot next to Eileen on Cas’s side of the makeshift alter under the willow tree.
This horrifying figure dripping with shadowy sludge that reached out for him, two gigantic and shattered wings unfurling over it’s back, stretching out in what once must have been an impressive display.
Castiels lips move against his own, an invite to actually participate in the kiss he had initiated. The movement at least helps prove to his shell shocked brain that yes, this actually
“Yeah, we… we found the pictures…” Sam says with a wince. “Actually, I have the spell on me right now…”
after working a nine-hour shift at the Gas N’ Sip, but… this was for Sam, after all. They were on the road by nine the same evening, headed down the US-36 East for what Cas knew was going to be a grueling and monotonous drive. Dean was all jitters next to him, his leg constantly shaking on the spot as he stares out of the Impala’s windows, the amber streetlights whizzing past only serving to intensify his anxiety.
"Alright no chick flick moments." Dean muttered after the hug lasted to long. The both smiled at each other before heading into the library.
"I will love you, not starting with your beautiful face, your soft skin, not your lips or your eyes. Not your organs or the sound of you sleeping. I will love and have loved, madly first, your naked soul. You are the poem I never knew I could write, and this life, this story, I have always wanted to tell." He whispered. Cas couldn't hear him, but he didn't care. It was enough for them to be together in this very moment.
Him and Dean both groaned in unison at the first movement and soon Castiel was setting up a pace. Slow at first moving up and down and in slow little circles, grinding himself on Deans hips. Dean sat up to leave kisses on Castiels neck and to nibble his earlobe and Castiel couldn't help the involuntary way his hips jerked with the gesture. They were moaning and whimpering, touching and grinding, panting and sweating for what felt both like minutes and yet like hours. Somewhere along the line Dean managed to flip them over so he was on top. He lifted Cas's leg above his shoulder and thrusted in without relent. In a matter of minutes Dean was pounding into Castiel, practically making him scream in pleasure as his prostate was hit on every thrust. Castiels loved being manhandled like how Dean was don't get him wrong, but his dominant side was persistent as well. Deans thrusts became erratic and Cas felt that hot coil building and simmering so in a quick flip he managed to get Dean on his back for the finale. He practically bounced on Dean panting and sweating as he felt Deans body tense beneath him.
to see Castiel – but he didn’t look particularly happy, either. This was quite the contrast to the smiling figure of Mary Winchester sat opposite him, whose smile held the same warmth she would direct towards her sons.
whilst his other hand came to rest on the side of Cas’s face. It wasn’t exactly a comfortable position –with shards of glass poking at him underneath his shirt and one of Cas’s knees dug painfully in his thigh and a sharp elbow resting on his ribs – but the firm weight of Castiel atop him, pushing into the kiss like he couldn’t get enough of him, more than made up for all that other stuff.
into one. I didn’t know what to feel, and before I knew it… there you were again. Alive, powered up once more… and then you left again.
“Don’t tempt me,” Sam warned light-heartedly, glancing back to the stairs to see Eileen making her way up to them. “Our best bet is just carrying you down in the chair. Can you grab him by the handles of the chair, Eileen? Then I’ll grab him by the front and help steer you down.”
Dean leans forward at the same time as Cas, the two meeting halfway. This kiss is polar opposite from the last; it’s soft and tender, lingering touches where neither seems to want to end it, smooth and natural like they’ve been doing it all their lives.
“Because I knew it would all work out in the end. No matter what Chuck threw our way… I believed in the vision Jack showed me.”
Castiel smiled fondly at the familiar words, tracing random designs on the side of his glass with his fingertip. “This one right here. If I only have a short time left here before… I like quiet moments like these. With you. Whatever time is left, I’d like to share it with you. If you’ll have me.”
After an entire day of tests, tests, and… oh yes, more tests, Dean had assumed he would sleep peacefully for the night. You know, that type of mental exhaustion where you fall into a deep sleep with nothing but total blackness? The one where you blink, and then all of a sudden there’s daylight peeking in through the blinds?
"You know and you didn't...." Dean trails off, and it hurts Sam to see the betrayal on Dean's face. "What the hells wrong with you?"
with Cas. Dean - and he’s sure Sam was too- was preparing for a multitude of questions from Cas about every damn scene. He’d already had a taste of that fun experience with ‘
“So?” Dean pressed, shaking his left arm in an attempt to shake off the ‘wrong’ feeling that lingered. “Find out anything?”
Dean shot awake with a strangled gasp, the last dregs of sleep clinging on tight as he blearily looks around the darkened room. His body is directing him over to his wheelchair before he can fully process it, not entirely sure if the shouts he heard from Eileen were because of something good, or of some sort of trouble within the bunker.
"Why is it so bad for me to?" Castiel asks in return, and Dean is forced to close his eyes to escape the heartbreak on Castiels face, a pain
“Your father shouldn’t have-,” Cas cut himself off with a frustrated grunt, a few octaves away from being a growl.  “You were a
Cas relaxed marginally at this, releasing the tension in his shoulders and taking another sip – albeit slightly larger than before- of his whiskey.
“It was… there was a bunch of vamps and…” Dean tried to describe his death in a way that didn’t sound as lame as it did in his head. “I kind of got shoved into a nail…”
The limited light in the room glints off the angel blade that Memory Cas had raised above Dean, the sight of which made Sam want to look away, to pretend he had never seen what he was seeing.
be, though. It wasn’t fair to this guy. He would be gone before either of them knew it, and he couldn’t just lead the guy on like that. That would just be cruel. And if he was stupid enough to start getting attached to this guy… It was just going to be painful for the both of them.
Castiel wasn't sure what it was he had said, but Dean's entire demeanour suddenly changed. He raised a hand to press into Castiels chest, at first a gentle touch, but then he roughly shoves Castiel away from him, a displeased frown on his face as he attempts to distance himself from Cas.
“I saw him,” Castiel answered simply. Dean and Sam’s heads whipped around to face each other, keeping up the astonished appearance for only a few more seconds before bursting out into laugher. Castiel visibly relaxed at the two’s apparent amusement at his act of violence against their father, even going so far as to crack a smile at the (admittedly) humorous memory.
“I didn’t- Cas said, he – he didn’t think he would be happy, but-,” Jack begins to blubber out, the gears in his head turning away. “The Empty said it wouldn’t come for Cas until he was happy?”
“He will be.” Castiel agreed. “And I’m sure Sam will have many stories of Dean Jr. to share once he joins you here.”
“I thought I’d give it a try. Perhaps make some sense of my thoughts,” Cas says without looking back at him, keeping his gaze fixated on the water ahead. “Try and see why so many are invested in this past time. I suppose maybe it’d be different if I was human, but… I just don’t get quite the same satisfaction.” It seems that, in a blink of an eye, Cas has the fish reeled in and dangling in the air in front of him. He gets the hook out of its mouth just as quick, looking down to the decent-sized carp he held in his hands. “What is it about fishing that makes it so worthwhile to humans? Is it the struggle of trying to reel it in? The sense of satisfaction you get out of pulling this creature from its habitat? Some feeling of power, a
Sam hurried back over to his seat, dropping the paper onto the table and pulling his discarded laptop closer before opening its lid. His fingers tap across the keys, eyes darting across the screen once he hits enter. Immediately, his face drops at what he reads, leaning back against his chair and wiping a hand across his mouth. “No good… she was labeled as ‘missing’ back in fifty-seven… by the Government, anyway. But according to the Men of Letters files-,” Sam turned the laptop around, showing Eileen and Dean an old, grainy, black and white photo of a pile of ash. “-She is officially dead. Taken out by their hunters…”
“Are you going to tell him, Castiel?” Sergei asked. Though his eyes were locked with Dean’s it felt like he was looking straight
“I-I- I don’t know,” Sam blurted out. “His heart is beating fine, right? Is there something blocking his airway or-,”
It was then, he thinks. As the flash went off, Dean stood next to Cas with their best blue steel impressions, immediately cracking up into laughter after and playfully tapping at the rim of Cas’s cowboy hat whilst Cas smiled at Dean like he was the sun that Sam realized…
"Stop trying to make our son choose favorites," Cas reprimands jokingly as Dean stands from the floor, lifting the boy in his lap up by his armpits, getting another giggle from the action.
. He had straightened up as much as his damaged spine would let him, his movements stiff and uncoordinated as he reached out a hand to stop Sam. His voice had dropped a few octaves, impossibly deep in tone to the point it sounded like Dean’s vocal cords were being shredded apart.
“I told you Sam, it’s just not my thing.” Dean followed him into the apartment, making a beeline straight for the couch that was calling his name and flopping down on it, coffee cup still in hand with the last few dregs inside. “The idea of college didn’t appeal to me back then, and it doesn’t now.”
“I don’t think I even want to know what you guys are talking about…” Sam’s voice barely filtered into his mind, almost like background noise. “You’re focusing on Cas about intensely as you focus on porn.”
“You don’t need to thank me,” Eileen leaned back against the map table, bracing her arms behind her as she spoke. “You, Sam, and Cas… you’re my family.”
easier to stay at Sam’s instead of paying for a room every night. If some poor mechanic shop is fool enough to take me on? Then… We’ll see.”
There it was again. That guarded expression on his face as Castiel prodded him for more, and for once Castiel is glad to see it. Because Dean wasn't running away. Maybe, just maybe this was Dean's way of preparing himself. To say what Castiel wanted
A gaze so piercing, he was sure the man in front of him knew all his secrets. He probably did, Dean thinks. He had rebuilt Dean from the ground up. His body, his soul, he had knitted him back together. Dean had been laid bare to him, every part of him down to the last atom.
“Time for what?” Castiel asked the two of them, the question eerily similar to Jimmy’s cryptic wording back in the Roadhouse.
It would be the biggest cliche to say that Castiel had the voice of an angel, which is completely unfair considering the fact that he
“Like I got impaled by a metal pole…” Dean responded dryly, wincing at the pulsating ache that sat within his back.
Castiel gathered up as much of his grace as he could, pulling it all together. It eagerly followed his command, desperate to heal the broken man that had provided them with shelter. Even now, holding all of his grace within himself, he knew…
this time, not Cas. Something was sticking out from the mass, something vaguely arm shaped, and Dean flopped next to the beginnings of Castiel’s body, rolling onto his back on the hard concrete floor and turning his head to the side to face it. When Dean’s eyes flash blue again, Sam knows it is not because of a change in possession. Dean’s ear-piercing scream of agony is proof of that, the horrifying sound reverberating around the large rooms of the bunker as the glow of
Dean’s still smiling face, eyes as wide as dinner plates as they scanned meticulously across Dean’s face, looking for
Dean’s eyes flicked up to the two of them, fiery determination lighting up the emerald of his eyes. “Then we’re gonna find a way to open up the Empty, and we’re gonna drag that dumb son of a bitch of ours back home.”
and then the plan officially began that Wednesday evening, when Castiel returned to the bunker at seven, looking about ready to drop dead after a grueling shift at the Gas N’ Sip.
This was a challenge he wasn’t sure how to approach. Even now it doesn’t seem real, even after all that’s happened. There had to be
“Right. I don’t know about you, but that doesn’t sound like something that should be in the hands of someone with that much power and knowledge. Who knows what he might ask for this time?”
“Oh my God…” The realization hits Sam like a punch to the gut. “Dean, we… They’re all gone. Not just the people from the apocalypse world, not just… God… Bobby, and Charlie, and Eileen, and… Donna went too.”
“I’m clean too,” Castiel told him, lifting his eyes from the condom packets up to Dean. “It’s… It’s been a while since I… Y’know…”
“Lookin’ good,” Dean drawled out, pushing himself up to a sitting position and leaning back against the headboard with a comfortable sigh. He peered up at Cas from the one eye he was willing to crack open, patting at the empty space next to him (which was still warm, he
. Usually with his one-night stands, he didn’t bother with any of this crap. He didn’t let them find him, he went out to find them. A person randomly picked out from the bar, maybe a name exchanged, but that was about it. Most of the time, the other person knew what was to come out of it. In fact, most mornings he woke up to find his partner for the night gone already, and the mornings where he woke up first, he made sure to get out of there as soon as possible.
“C’mon, Cas…” Dean whispers down to his angel. His hand rests on Castiel’s chest, waiting to feel that reassuring ‘thud’ of a heartbeat against his hand. The skin under his touch is firm, but stone cold. Castiel’s heart remains silent in his chest. “I need you to wake up, Cas. Okay? I need you to wake up for me.”
to help people… had a soft spot, you see… Every witch worth her money knows that helping the needy just attracts unwanted attention. She found that out far too late, I’m afraid…”
"Perhaps. Dean looks the same age he does now, so it seems unlikely that this is an event that occurred before we met... The only possibility I suppose is the time Dean spent while you were in Hell, but... This doesn't look like the house of Lisa Braeden... "
happy Cas, and considering how rare he sees that from Cas, it brings him a sense of satisfaction that
car, and not that vomit-beige colored monstrosity of his.” Dean caught sight of Cas’s affronted face out of the corner of his eye. This would quickly turn into another argument if he wasn’t careful. “C’mon, Cas. Let’s get going.”
"No. I'm perfectly sane. But, then, 94% of psychotics think they're perfectly sane, so I guess we'd have to ask ourselves, '
“So what?” Dean said. “You just… strung us along? Pretended that everything would be fine, that you believed there was a way too?”
It had been a yell powerful enough to awaken a fallen angel. A yell that pierced through the minds of every angel, blocking out the multiple other voices on the angel radio with his own. It was the only message that mattered, at least in his own mind. Now, there aren’t many angels left. Soon, there will be one less. Again, he wants to scream to the heavens. He wants to shout to the universe of the wonderful man he has fallen completely and utterly in love with, he wants to yell to a caring God to
Dean chuckled and turned to see the canvas as well. It was still evidently striped rainbow, but the colors bled together like fireworks from where they had both clawed at the sheets. There were a few smudges and even what Dean swore was an ass imprint. He smiled and kissed Cas's cheek.
AHHH! So that's the end of the story. I would like to say a lot of my inspirations came from the fan fictions Painted Angels by WinJennster and riptides by sharkfish, both here on Ao3. Anyways, I hope you guys liked this. I sure know I had a lot of fun writing it. So thanks for reading heller friends!
"I love you two, dearest." Cas said kissing Deans temple. Sam and Eileen both smirked at them and Dean blushed. Dean drew his cards and went round back to Cas who put his final card down with a smile.
"Nothing, just your tattoo. That's- fuck that's hot." Castiel didn't blush or turn from his gaze like Dean would have, he just smirked confidently and turned back around.
Dean wanted to bask in this moment for the rest of his time on this messed up planet, but realized he hadn't slept more than a couple of hours since the night before, and they had already been on the road for so long. A look at the clock said it was now just past one in the morning. The feeling of drifting barrelled into the spark of Cas's closeness.
"Please don't bring him into this." Cas mumbled into his neck, still sucking away. Dean chuckled lightly before breaking out into a groan. Castiels hand wrapped firm around both of them and worked up a slow stroke. If it wasn't for the softness of Cas's hands, the rough friction would almost be too much. Dean couldn't believe the absolute depths of pleasure he felt as the lips of his angel roamed across his body. The pent up lust and longing made them much to needy to spend much time on the slow kisses of foreplay, but as Cas flipped them over and slammed him against the mattress, they got a bit rougher. Dean managed to get quick nips and licks of Cas's nipples and shoulders and whatever else came into contact. As soon as their stiffness aligned perfectly, heads catching on one another in Cas's hand, Dean thought he may come on the spot. The intensity of passion he felt for the man cacooning him against his toned body threatened to rip him to shreds. Cas wrapped a strong hand around them both as he balance himself above Dean. The lust of Cas's grip and the hardness of the other made him feel out of his mind as he watched the thick muscles of the angel's bicep hold him in place. He had drastically underestimated the absolute jaw-dropping hotness of the body hidden beneath Cas's ever-present suit.
"I get it, I get it. Just- come and have drinks with me. Please? I need a wingman. Plus you know all the little French boys love you."
"Cas, I can't stay awake." Cas smiled at the barely intelligible mumble from the man gone heavy in his arms.
"I feel bad that we haven't gotten to do anything since he got back and I want to make it up to him. So we're gonna kick this monsters ass, together, and we're gonna have a little us time." Sam smiled knowingly and nodded.
Another thought popped into his head as he headed towards their bedroom and went into the bathroom. He looked in the cabinet for a moment looking for Deans pills. Soon enough he found the orange pill bottle with his name and everything written on it.
"You should start taking them again. I know it's not my place but I think it could be good for you."
When the night was over, Dean decided to let Cas drive the Impala. Of course Sam had to go on and on about how he never lets anyone drive her, but of course Cas already knew that. Still Dean couldn't help but passenger seat drive a bit to which Cas got snappy and it was adorable.
Christmas Day they only see each other in the morning after spending the night together and then they go their separate ways.
"Dean," Cas moaned and everything snapped into the moment. The sensations catching up with him. The heat of his body, the tightness around him, the fingers digging into his back. It was so good. "Say it."
Because they were not done with their conversation. No where near. Sam was beyond tired by three in the morning, but Dean was sharp as a pistol from the copious amounts of caffeine pumping through his system.
Dean would be lying if he said he wasn't a little scared with where he knew this was going. But damn if he wasn't excited too. He slid his hands up Cas's sides resting them at his hips as Cas slowly, barely ground down into him. Deans breath hitched a little and he captured Cas's lips with his own again. He let his hands roam up the angels sides, feeling the bone of his ribs and the softness of his skin. Skin soft like earth is fused together by different worlds and turned to one. Where they felt destined to grow close and apart over and over again. Dean noticed now more than ever in this heated moment how truly beautiful Castiel is. How much he loves the little lines around his eyes, the soft folds and lines of his stomach, they way his brows furrow when he kisses same as when he's confused. And suddenly, Dean can't hear a thing. Only the feeling of Cas on top of him.
Castiels face shot up in surprise at what Dean said. He opened his mouth like he was trying to say something, but he couldn't get anything to come out. Dean didn't speak again just gave him the chance to say something.
But he could've had it. Dean would've given him anything if he had known. But it was too late now. He sat at the table and forced himself to eat, if not mixed with the alcohol he had today, he knew he'd throw up again. He was peeling the loose corner label off of his beer bottle when Eileen came and sat down in front of him.
"No I do, I just... I know you and I would hate this to complicate things." Dean cradled Castiels face in his hand, taking in his expression. Cas knows him well, but Dean wants this.
"Dean!" Cas yelled. The possessed teenager lurched at him, knocking the shovel from his hands. The boy almost had superhuman strength with the ghost possessing him. David punched him over and over until Dean felt his lip split from the boys ring. Castiel scrambled to help Dean but David somehow threw him with his mind.
Dean had enough to drink over dinner that maybe he shouldn't have driven, but he couldn't imagine going anywhere other than Cas's, and it's not like he had anyone else to drive him either.
"Turn off the light." He gruffed at Sam. He listened as his little brother moved across the room and he heard the -click- of the lamp being turned off. "Thanks." He said leaning back on the wall. His eye lids were like glue from all the tears he knew he had cried. He rubbed the crust out of them and forced himself to blink into the much dimmer room now. Sam walked over to him and was still fuzzy in his vision.
Once Castiel is in a pair of borrowed sweatpants from Dean, the two of the snuggle up together on the couch with Dean pressed in between the V of Cas's thighs. Castiel turns on a show on Netflix but doesn't really pay much attention to it at all. He's vaguely aware that he's read the Outlander books for the show so it's not like he needs to watch it to know what happens anyways. He looks down at Dean and cards his fingers through his still damp hair while Dean watches the show and nuzzled back into Cas's lap.
"You just go right ahead, sweetheart." Castiel chuckled low in his throat and the two began to lazily kiss and grind against one another, still clothed. After the hunt and the trip home, Dean realized that there are things he missed, that he shouldn't really miss. He realized that sometimes he wants what he couldn't, and loved someone he could. Dean kissed Castiel back as passionately as possible in his still sleep clouded mind as the moved with and against one another. "Fuck, Cas." Dean groaned clinging tightly to the other man.
"I have an idea." He said. He bolted for the door leaving Dean standing there confused. When he came back in the warehouse, he dropped to the floor with the duffle bag and started to speak as he opened it. "Remember back when we were in Shoshone, Idaho? There was that hell hound that I killed for the trials. Well, we couldn't see it, so we used glasses," he pulled out two pairs of glasses and the old jug. "And doused them in holy oil. I remember one time, Cas showed me all these sigils guarding a building. I could t see them, but he could. So maybe the holy oil," he said pouring it on the glasses. "Will help us see any sigils. It's a long shot, but it just might work."
"I love it. I love you." He said and grabbed Cas's face and forced their lips together. They kissed a moment before Crowley coughed across the room.
"Well, if you'd like we can go back you your place. I can think of several things we could do to warm you up."
Dean was quiet for a moment looking down at his hands. He stayed silent for a long time and Castiel almost said something else but then Dean answered.
When they hopped out, Dean dried Castiel off and kissed him softly before tucking him into bed. Dean stopped in the living room to grab Cas's stash which was running a little low. He brought it into the bedroom and crawled under the covers with Cas, both of them loose, naked and warm.
"None of us think less of you because of that, you know that don't you, Dean? You're family and we are glad that your happy." Jody smiled.
"Fuck you Dean. You're like my best friend and you don't get to disappear just because you saw something you didn't like."
Everyone was stunned silent. The air was both thick yet somehow thin. Everything in this place was in its contradictory. And Jack felt safe here, which was far from okay.
Dean decided then that he was going to call everyone. He went to his room and dialed on his phone, Jody, Donna, Garth, Bobby, Charlie, Alex, everyone. Most of them said that they would be there Friday at the latest. Just as he was sitting on the end of the bed, he tossed his phone back into the pillow and sighed heavily. There was a slight knock on the door that Dean recognized as Eileens instantly. Her knock was very soft and had a certain rhythm to it.
Dean was in the middle of pulling out a pecan pie out of the oven when there was a knock at the door.
"Good for them." He said quietly. He tried not to think about how much he wanted that kind of relationship. The one person he wanted that with was gone. Again. "So uh, everyone's okay right?"
"Fuck! Oh do that again." Dean whined. Castiel certainly wasn't going to deny Dean anything so he did it again. And again. He thrusted hard and fast over and over until Dean was reduced to a sobbing mess in the bed unable of even kissing back. The look on his face was sheer ecstasy and Castiel wanted to see him finish like this. He moved even faster watching every minuscule shift and change in his expression. Castiel could tell once he was on the cusp of orgasm as he clenched tighter around Cas causing the blue eyed man to shudder. He wrapped a hand around Deans cock to help push him along faster and Dean was writhing with each touch. Then all at once he was coming hot and hard body trembling with his orgasm the final word on his tongue, a whisper like a praise: "Castiel."
"I know, I know, just-" he took a shaky breath and Castiel reached his hand over on the couch for him to take. He mouthed 'it's okay' and Dean looked back to the laptop.
"Dean, I knew you weren't strait. I've known for a long time. And I don't think any less of you for it. You're my brother, and I love you and I want you happy. And how could I not be when your in love with my best friend?!" He smiled. "I'm proud of you for talking to me. Lord knows I've been trying to get you to talk about Cas like this forever."
They rented a motel room to book up for the time being. A place to crash while they tried to find the halo. They set up in the small room together and grabbed things they thought they would need. Angel blades, guns, the colt, and even holy oil. They loaded up the Impala and drove off to the first warehouse.
"Would you shut the fuck up? I'm not still obsessing over Lee, okay? We're done. Me and Cas had some great sex and we're probably gonna hook up again, but I don't want to date right now. And it's not because of Lee, because I am over him. I just... I need to focus on culinary school right now."
"If you're gonna bitch the whole time, maybe I'll just crash her for the hell of it." Cas grinned. Both Sam and Eileen were stunned speechless in the back.
The two of them scrambled out of the covers, both of them getting changed when Sam and Eileen stepped out. The two of them headed to the entryway of the bunker together where Sam and Eileen were.
"Don't be so modest, he's going to be the next up and coming artist. Historians are going to know his name." Cas rolled his eyes. "Seriously, he's getting an all expense paid trip to Birmingham to sell his art. And boy, is he selling."
"Thank you." Cas said nervously. Unbelieving everything that just happened. As soon as he turned back, Deans eyes were wide and there was a huge grin on his face.
When he came back out, Cas was still dressed in his regular navy suit and trench coat whispering to Sam. Dean furrowed in confusion before they both abruptly pulled away when he came into the room. Dean wanted to know, but he just brushed it off and grabbed the keys to the Impala as they all headed out of the bunker.
"I heard a snap. My elbow hurts." Cas hissed. Dean carefully took Cas's forearm,  grimacing in apology as Cas winced. Dean hissed when he saw the blood and the bone peeking out of his trench coat.
"No I can't. I actually don't think I've gone this long without sex since I met you. I might actually die."
"Oh fucks sake." Dean groaned sliding back away from Castiel before grinding back down making both of them groan. Castiel listened after that, and started to thrust his hips slowly and a little unsure, but it felt good.
Cas and Sam were sitting in the library when Dean came in from the kitchen. Dean set down a beer for each of them, standing behind Cas and massaging his shoulders. This was something he could do. Cas carried a lot of his stress and tension in his shoulders, and now that he was human, it was worse.
"Yes it is, Dean. You were a child. No matter what, your father had no right to lay a hand on you... did he ever hit Sam?"
Castiel goes pliant in his arms. He knows he should breathe, to break off for air, but he can't find it in himself to stop kissing Dean. Deans hands slid up Castiels sides rucking up his shirt as he trails kisses down his jaw. Castiel managed to pull his sweater off only having Deans lips off of him for a moment. Deans hands are strong. Thick muscular hands with calloused fingers. They roam all over his body with firm but gentle finesse and it takes Castiel a moment to realize Dean is searching out for his tattoos.
"No. She had to go back to Athens. But I'm not complaining. If she crashed on our couch then I couldn't fuck you tonight." Castiel chuckled.
Once the group had left he was able to get some alone time with his husband. Cas showed no relent or mercy that night making Dean cum nine times before he finally went to sleep. Cas watched as Dean slept, sweaty and peaceful and he sketched him like usual. He thought to himself he could never tire of Dean, because each feeling with him was a religious experience, an epiphany, a euphoric moment he held in his heart. And he knew he still wouldn't ever get tired of calling Dean his husband.
"I know! He's even arranging for me to go to Arles where they will be presented in his art show. Dean," he panted. "This is it. My start. I'm getting my name out there."
If Dean hadn't been coming like a fucking tsunami he would've said yes, absolutely. But he didn't. He almost asked what Castiel meant afterwards but thought he was probably just dirty talking like he does sometimes. But then again when they went to dinner, Cas had been so gentle touching Deans thigh under the table and holding his hand in the car ride home that he didn't know.
Time went on. Dean and Castiel made a comfortable place in their lives. Deans father passed at the end of July and Dean handled it surprisingly well. Especially with Cas to comfort him all the way through it. Dean still couldn't believe that after everything, Cas chose him. Dean got to listen to all of the interviews Cas went on and eventually got over his fear of flying so he could accompany Cas on all of his art galleries and shows. Dean himself was looking on the market for empty kitchens that he could maybe start his own establishment. A little bakery of sorts he thought would be nice.
"You could say that. I'm sorry, Inias. This has been great and it's been nice to talk to you again but... I don't think this can work out."
Castiel sighed his frustration and went into the kitchen to pour himself a glass of Beaujolais. He enjoyed the sweet burn of the wine as he drank it slowly. He poured himself a second glass before going back out onto the balcony. He set his glass down and went back inside to quickly grab his box of sativa. He opened the box and pulled out the small, thin wrapping papers and packed up his roach. He grimaced when he accidentally licked some of the leaf but finished rolling it and lit up. Despite marijuana being illegal in France, his brother Gabriel almost always had some and practically became Castiels dealer. He closed his eyes on the first inhale and held in the smoke as it clouded his mind. He went back out to the balcony and stared at his canvas once more. He slowly started adding more colors as he drank and smoked away. A sudden knock at the door dragged him out of his concentration and he snubbed out the rest of his roach as he walked towards the door. He looked through the peep hole to see his brother Gabriel on the other side. He rolled his eyes as he opened the door.
Cas took Deans hand and dragged him off stage over to a private room. As soon as they were in the room, Castiel kissed Dean long deep and hard. Much like their first kiss last September and it's hard to believe how far they've come. Dean still had tears flowing out of his eyes when Cas finally pulled his soft lips off his enough to speak.
Dean sighed worrying his lip between his teeth and shifting up in the bed for a moment. He opened his mouth like he was about to say something but then stopped and hesitated once more.
He didn't know if he wanted to laugh or cry. Cas was curled up in a ball wearing the trench coat Dean bought him. His hair was tousled and his cheeks were flushed pink. His eyebrows were scrunched together like he was having a very serious dream and he was twitching in it too.
"You must think I am an idiot then, because you are most definitely hiding something." Dean sighed and looked over across the kitchen at the portrait Castiel had given him- a sketch of Deans eyes and freckles- and clenched his jaw.
"Balthazar had a large collection of ancient items. Relics. Some even stollen from heaven. I wouldn't doubt that they've vanished."
"Samantha, for Sammy, since he named Dean after me... Jody, because you're my mom. I don't care about blood, you have been my mom for the past fifteen years. So me and Cas both agreed on that."
Inias and Castiel were each others firsts and at the time it was great. Their relationship was fun and incredible. They snuck out and went to parties together, or they would sneak into each others bedrooms in the middle of the night for some secretive quiet sex. It felt good to be rebellious, after all Cas was the good kid in the family. His brother Gabe had moved out once he turned eighteen and left for Paris to be a film director. Castiel was left being the oldest again which meant he had responsibilities. He went to church every Sunday, Bible study every Wednesday even though he didn't consider himself the religious type like his parents.
"Still beautiful. Still Dean Winchester." Cas mumbled. When Dean furrowed his face, Cas's thumb smoothed over the harsh lines, softening his expression. Dean scooted a little closer towards Castiel and pecked a chaste kiss on his lips, sighing happily as he did so. It felt so right.
He sped all the way to his bedroom and collapsed face first on his bed with a grunt. He forced himself to roll onto his back and at least kick off his boots. He lied in bed staring at the ceiling, his thoughts too loud for his own head. Suddenly the silence was the loudest sound he had ever heard so he grabbed his headphones and turned on some Lynyrd Skynyrd. He was content listening to his music until Free Bird came on. The faint memory played in his mind. It was right before they were going to go fight the devil. Right before Ellen and Jo died in the explosion. That night he kept hitting on Jo, trying to compensate for whatever he was curious about with Cas. Castiel was downing shots like they were nothing. He looked so cute and clueless back then. So innocent. He remembered after Jo and Ellen went to bed, Bobby and Sam were talking on the porch, and him and Cas were left alone in the kitchen.
"Sorry, sorry. But I'm so happy for you and Sam. You guys'll be great parents." She nodded and there was a moment of silence before she spoke up again.
"Afraid so." The demon said, adjusting his large framed glasses. "See, my names Cyrus. Cyrus Stein."
"Last night you said you didn't want to date... but you said you didn't mind me. Are we- I mean did you mean that were-"
Castiel worked his hands into the muscles of Deans back and shoulder blades, up to his neck and eventually his arms slowly but surely draining the tension from them. Soon enough, Dean was fully relaxed and Castiel shifted above him to climb off.
Cas wrapped him into his arms and kissed him deeply before putting on the ring. It was a simple gold band, much too nice and shiny for Deans rough calloused hands. But the ring was much like Cas. Too good for him. He held Cas close and kissed him under the stars until it became too passionate to do outside. They slipped into the backseat of the Impala, making slow love, giving themselves each other. Dean could no longer think of a world where a 'them' didn't exist, and became attached to the idea of always being Cas's. Dean was long lost, but at least he had the courage to lose himself in something he truly wanted. They just fell asleep, messy, sweaty and tangled in the backseat of the Impala, proud to be with one another, to belong. Proud to have rebelled as it got them here.
"I'm honored. You're so amazing." Dean said kissing the top of Castiels head. "I don't know what I did to deserve you."
"Yes. It is a very sexy surprise." Cas said almost conversationally. "But, I warn you, it's going to be very, very messy."
"Neither have I. I simply have a key, not a map. But I know one thing. He is both everywhere and nowhere in here."
But he would also be lying if he said having that part of Cas, so close to him made him feel so incredibly happy.
"Anal retentive? That doesn't sound like my Dean at all." He said with a smirk. John started laughing hard again and Dean pinched Cas. Once John caught his breath, all three of them were smiling.
"I don't mind. Maybe some other time we could practice." He said with a glint in his eyes. He couldn't find it in himself to say no so he simply nodded an agreement before they continued walking.
"No I don't mind you. I just don't want to date him." Castiels eyelids felt heavy and he found himself swaying a bit.
"Well, I don't know. When I find out what true love feels like I'll let you know. But if I had to guess I would say it feels like you're happy and inspired. You want to be the best version of yourself."
"I don't know how but your French sounds even better when you're drunk." Dean chuckled taking off his coat.
"I'm dating you. That should be answer enough." He smiled. "I know. It's too hot for your precious skin, I'll turn it down." He chuckled. Castiel wrapped his arms around him from behind placing open mouthed kisses on his spine. Soft and comforting. Dean leaned back and sighed into his touch. He turned around in Cas's arms and kissed him deeply. Things weren't forced. They weren't rushed. They weren't even that heated, despite the fact that they were both wet and naked in a steel box. They were just being affectionate and loving. Healing is a great way to describe their touches. Castiel washed every inch of Deans body with soft loving hands and Dean returned the favor before they were both so warm and lax, they almost fell asleep standing in the shower.
"I got you coffee and a bear claw. If you don't want that I could make you something, but I'm afraid we're low on groceries. I haven't gotten the chance to go to the store and I-"
"I didn't like the way they made me feel. Made me feel uninterested and uninspired about the things I loved. I mean, Cas had to go celibate 'cause I couldn't even get my libido flowing. I don't want that for him, I don't want that for me, I don't want that for us."
This was easily becoming one of Castiels favorite things. Getting ready for bed together. It was so simple and domestic that it shouldn't be that special, but with Dean everything is. The way he hooks his chin over Cas's shoulder as he combs his hair or the way he sings All My Loving by The Beetles when he showers before bed. It makes Castiel smile and the faint thought crosses his mind that they're building a routine together.
"There's my unicorn." She smiled pushing past Dean to get into the apartment. "What the hell Clarence?"
"Good." Dean stormed back into his small bedroom and turned on the shower willing the water to get hot. Even by the time he stepped under the spray it was still lukewarm. He quickly scrubbed himself clean using cheap mint and cucumber shampoo. By the time he found himself at least suitably clean, the water was already cold so he simply hopped out. One look in the mirror and he decided he could do a little grooming, especially if he was going to see Castiel tonight.
Inias had asked Castiel out yet again, and he couldn't find it in himself to say no. He hadn't seen Dean in over a week and although he texted him almost every day, Castiel still couldn't help but worry that he scared him off by what they did the last time.
"Where's Cas?" Dean didn't want to say it again so he just signed "dead." She smiled sadly and reached over and took his hand on the table. "I'm sorry, Dean. Do you want to talk about it?"
When Dean stepped into the library after Sam, Cas's back was facing him. He felt warmth spread in his chest so he leaned down and kissed the top of his head making the angel smile before sitting next to him. The four of them spent hours talking and drinking, just catching up and sharing random stories from the past. Dean couldn't help the way his heart leaped in his chest every time he saw Cas smile. That beautiful gleam in his blue eyes, they way his eyes crinkled in the corners from age. He was just as beautiful today as he was the day Dean first met him. Even then he was battling between his hatred and attraction for the mysterious angel. Times sure have changed.
"Well, I had Sammy with me. And the school- I uh, I didn't realize that being accepted meant I actually had to go to France. That was until I was on the plane."
"Yeah. It was like from last weeks paper. Thursday's I believe. It talked all about you and your art. People saying you're the new up and coming artist of the century."
"Hot. Feels... warm," he grunted. "And tight, wet. Just good." Dean groaned at the slight dirty talk and moved in time trying to get him to go faster. Cas lost some form of semblance and started to go hard and fast while somehow still being gentle. Dean was moaning and cursing as Cas just kissed him through his thrusts. Dean's hands gripped at the bedsheets, now completely soaked with sweat, and held Castiel close to him as he fucked him. Dean reached his hand in between their stomachs and wrapped a firm fist around his member, hissing in the double stimulation. Cas's thrusts became erratic, hitting that spot inside Dean on every other turn. Dean moved his hand in time with Cas, pulling and twisting trying to get to that sweet edge.
"Jack!" Cas yelled. The sound still muffled like a sound box. The temperature neither hot nor cold. Dark nor light. Silent but somehow still deafeningly loud. The three of them wandered deeper and deeper into the abyss calling out for the Nephilim. But there was nothing. They walked and screamed hoarse for what felt like hours, but there was nothing. Until The Empty was summoned. If Dean had chills about the place before, that was nothing compared to the utter fear that was The Empty itself. It took the molding form of black liquid, forming itself into a human form. Dean almost jumped when he was Meg, but knew in an instant that it wasn't her. The Empty made her voice different, her demeanor was oddly snarky and similar, but it wasn't her.
"C'mon I'm a picture of health. I'm fine. I haven't had an episode in a long time. I'm still in touch with Dr. Singer if I do need them again."
Short thereafter, both of them were pleasantly loose and sated from their orgasms. Deans stomach grumbled loud enough that both of them laughed and Castiel suggested that they order something to eat. It was still far too early to go to bed and too soon to go for round to, so they just talked while they waited for food. Dean had noticed over the past month of sleeping together, he was less and less afraid to touch Cas. Not just sensual touches but friendly and gentle, but more than anything... intimate.
"Who's Naomi?!" Dean asks the same time as Sam, as Memory Castiel folds over on himself, panting in apparent exhaustion, fighting something that Dean and Sam can't see.
“That makes two of us…” Dean mumbled in agreement, fighting back a groan at the thought of even more countless hours of research.
… being the one to marry two dudes in the Midwest, one of which was a former angel and the other a dude who was once a
“Sorry, Cas. Being an idiot is just who I am. Especially considering I was apparently stupid enough to go and fall in love.”
"Yeah well you on the other hand," Dean scrubbed a hand down his face. "Lookin' good. But respectfully I don't feel like talking right now.
"Jack, I don't know what's gotten into you, but we can fix this. Just come home with us." Sam pleaded.
They sat on the couch with their dinners as Dean pulled up his laptop, much calmer than before. He took a dee breath before pressing call. It rang a few times and pixilated before Deans father came into view. Castiel was off to the side, probably not in the camera view he thought.
"Or what?! You gonna kick me out? Throw me out for kissing my goddamn boyfriend?" Dean scoffed before turning around and pulling Cas with him, their book long forgotten. Once they made it onto the street Castiel turned to him.
Castiel was walking on a cloud by the time he made it to the little bistro with Gabriel. Gabe of course got his coffee loaded with sugar and cream while Cas enjoyed the bitter blackness of his own.
The first touch of the tattoo gun was a bit of a shock, but it wasn't painful. It sort of just felt like a vibration poking at his chest.
"I know, I know. I'm just saying we've been here forever. Maybe he just-" they heard a fluttering behind them and both spun in heel to face Cyrus.
Castiel still goes on the date with Inias on Tuesday. The two of them go out for a simple dinner and reminisce about the old days.
Dean looked up at Sam. His hair was mused from tucking it behind his ears so many times, his eyes were soft and pleading with dark circles underneath them. He was always good at the puppy dog eyes but he was not going to win him over with this one.
Sam was silent for a moment, but he didn't seem angry or even shocked. Dean expected more of a reaction if he was being honest. But Sam just contemplated with a blank expression. Deans nerves cut into him so he started talking again before Sam could.
"Goodnight, Dean." He heard the barest whisper of Cas's voice. He shot up and looked around, but realized he must've just imagined it. A gallon of coffee, non stop reading up until four am will do that to you. Still he tried to ignore the ache he felt in his chest as he realized, Cas wasn't there. He sighed and laid back heavily in his bed. He closed his eyes and despite his mind being ready for action, his body was not. It felt like a relief to close his dry and sore eyes from crying. His mind kept racing with constant thoughts, until they started to become random and no longer make sense before eventually, his body slipped off into sleep.
"Want the truth? I'm batshit. I'm mental. I'm manic, suicidal, psychotic, delusional, insane. I'm a goddamn train wreck. And it's not fair for me to put that on your brother."
He nodded and continued to read, completely ignoring his brothers requests. After a few minutes Sam sighed and got up from the table. He shuffled his feet dragging them heavily along the floor before the sound stopped. When Dean looked up Sam was standing in the doorway to the kitchen.
Castiel was almost positive he didn't have any std's so it came as no surprise when everything was negative but he still jumped onto Dean. Deans test came back a two days before so they were both in the clear.
"I do," Cas said hopping off Dean since they were getting some strange looks. "But I would much rather fuck you on your couch."
Castiel kissed Dean on the cheek before stepping into the bathroom. Dean went out onto the balcony to order the pizza after texting Sam and Gabe to come over to Cas's. Within a half hour both Sam and Gabe were over and the pizza came too. Dean and Cas opted for the love seat while Sam and Gabe ate next to each other on the couch.
It was the key to Deaths library. Dean laughed a little bit and then sniffled before he clenched the key to his chest. He didn't even remember having the key in his person then, and on second thought, he didn't. He thought, long and hard of how the hell that key had gotten into his jacket. But there was no answer. Dean had done his best not to touch that jacket since... then. And even still, he didn't have the key to begin with, nor would he have put it in his pocket. Sam could have had they key, but they don't go into each other's rooms. It's like a code. He knows Eileen wouldn't do something like that, so what the hell?
"I do. With all my heart. And I want you here, all the time. Because when you're gone... it's like someone's taken the air from my lungs. And it- it scares the hell out of me, because I can't lose you again."
"I want you to know that I really am sorry. About Inias. It kills me every time I think about it. Not just that but how I treated you before."
"Angel," he panted. "You gonna get out of your clothes?" He smiled. Castiel pulled away and did his best to shimmy out of his clothes quickly while Dean went and started up the shower. He got in first and smirked when Cas hissed at the heat of the spray.
"Not the whole reason. See there is this really hot painter who lives here and he's probably the best sex I've ever had. He's pretty confident and sexy. You might not know him though." Dean joked.
Sam says you've got an apartment now. Or they call it a flat there? Anyways, I hope you finish up school so you can come back here and help at the shop. Lord knows your uncles Bobby and Rufus will chew me out if you don't. Have fun in France and don't catch anything.
"Cas!" He moaned as he came buried deep inside of him. Castiel grabbed his own errection and started moving in time with Deans little grinds milking the last of his orgasm out in Castiels ass. He worked himself quick until he came all over Deans chest with a loud groan. He collapsed onto Dean, burying his face in the younger mans hair as he willed his heartbeat back to normal. His body was numb tingling with many different sensations. He winced when Dean shifted beneath him and brushed his prostate once more. He carefully pulled himself off of Deans cock and they both hissed their disapproval. Dean got up to where Cas assumed was to throw the condom away in the bathroom. When he came back he also grabbed a cloth and cleaned both himself and Castiel off while he still lay their numb in the afterglow. Dean crawled back into the bed and nuzzled against Cas's chest. The two of them laid their in the darkness and comfortable silence for a long time before Dean spoke up.
"You- you feel the same?" He asked shakily, voice faltering with nerves. That hesitation in his voice may have been what sprung him on. Or maybe it was the anticipation, or twelve years of tension, but before he was aware of what he was doing, he got up from his seat and went around to Cas. He pulled the angel up to his feet and before he could protest to his own nerves, he grabbed Castiels face and mashed their lips together.
Once Dean was in his boxers Castiel smiled against his lips and practically threw him into bed. He walked over to his nightstand to quickly grab a condom and some lube before climbing back into the bed.
"Deals a deal. You help me get into the empty, you get Deaths scythe, help me get my," Dean almost said friend out of habit, but Cas is more than a friend. Not that the reaper needs to know that. "Help me get the angel back."
Of course Cas called him. Blew his phone up, but he couldn't answer when he didn't have answers to give.
"Love you." He blushed. They ate in silence for a moment before Castiel asked a question. By the sound of it he had been meaning to for a while. Still he felt a pang of guilt at the way he looked down as he said it.
"I suppose it would be ironic to become Death at the hands of none other than the ultimate killer." He said deviously.
"But he's not... Dead. Just in the empty. We can get him back, death hasn't got him yet. He's just stuck."
"I love you too." He turned towards the audience and tapped the mic. "Thank you for everyone coming out here for my art. A huge thanks to my fiancé and I will see you later."
Castiel had spent the majority of the day cleaning his flat making it presentable for company tonight. Castiel had noticed one thing in the time after Dean left, his inspiration to paint had left him. Maybe he was being superstitious, but he hadn't been able to put anything onto a canvas since he finished the skyline.
Left your necklace at my place. I'll hold onto it for you if you want to come by and get it sometime.
It turns out Inias did get Castiels letter, and claims he still has it to this day. Inias is now a journalist who lives in Paris and is in Compiègne visiting a friend. Castiel is surprised to find himself actually, thoroughly enjoying his company. Inias is nothing like he was when he was seventeen, but that was to be expected. The two laugh and share jokes talking about their lives now. Dinner goes so well that Castiel actually agrees when Inias suggests that they go out again.
"Yeah. Well uh," he blushed as he pulled his sleeve down. "I took a picture of the handprint you left, cause I liked it a lot. Like you marked me I took it in to Pam and she did it for me, even though she's kind of scary. Do you- do you like it?" Cas's jaw was slack and he reached out and place his hand over the mark smiling ear to ear and sighing contented.
Any doubts looming in Deans mind about whether or not he was ready to date again were shoved down because he had an answer. He liked Cas. A lot. They way he touched him gently and soothed away his fears. The way his lips and kisses stole his breath away. The way he draws at night when he thinks Dean doesn't know. His piercing blue eyes full of such tenderness and adoration, yet fierce and commanding all at once. Even the way Castiel smiles, the way it lights up his whole face and makes his sharp nose and eyes crinkle.
Happy 25th birthday son. I hope this gets to you on time for your birthday since you're not getting my calls. Could you send me a letter back just to make sure I've got the right number? I hope your having fun, meeting lots of people and maybe a few French chicks. I can't believe you've already been gone a month. Talk soon.
Death was leaned up against the bookshelf with a book from the J section in his hands. "Well, well, well. Howdy boys. Good to see you again. I was just reading up on your little friend, Jack."
"Yeah." Dean blushed to himself. "Look I'm gonna go shower and then I'm going to stop at Monoprix to get some groceries. You wanna come with?"
Dean groaned as he closed the space between them. "New rule. You can't speak French and wear a skirt at the same time."
The hugged probably even longer than their kiss and neither of them wanted to let go. They wanted to stay there forever in the embrace of the other man they loved.
"Who was that?" Dean asked. Castiel simply jumped on Dean wrapping his arms around his neck and kissing his cheeks.
"Okay..." Dean said looking down. He leaned in next to softly kiss hotly on Cas's neck, still not voicing what he was asking for.
"And you got on me all night for not letting her go." Cas laughed as he sat next to Dean, almost sitting on his lap with the small confine of the love seat. He traced her eyelids softly and Dean watched as he long gentle hands cradled her head in his palms.
"Yes just let me grab my coat. You can come on in for a moment if you'd like." He said. Cas went back into his bedroom to grab his coat that he had tossed on the floor. As he picked up his coat he saw something slightly under the edge of his bed. He pulled it out and smiled to himself for a moment.
Dean let his head fall back to the headboard, his eyelids drifting shut as the back of his head met the old and sturdy wood. Castiel peered at Dean from the side at the movement, smiling tenderly to himself at the sight of Dean so at peace. It was no surprise that this is where the tape picked up from - Castiel often rewound the tape to this song over and over again whenever he could take the time to sit down and listen to it.
“Shuddup,” Dean grumbled, shooting the two warning glares as he slammed his coffee cup atop the table.
“So much so that you sleep through all my calls and texts, and then takes us yelling your name around ten times for you to wake up?” Sam asks, still with that hint of worry in his eyes.
screaming away from Cas’s body whilst Eileen wrapped him up – because if he was being honest with himself, he didn’t think he could do this all over again.
Dean could only hold the eye contact for a few seconds more after that, dropping back down to his lap as Castiel’s words whirled around his head. “Do, uh… Do you even know how long you have left before…?”
“There’s something else,” The doctor admitted. That’s when Sam noticed the clipboard in the Doctor’s hand, recognizing the familiar glossy sheen of an x-ray document. The doctor handed the x-ray over to him, and even without the doctor's intervention, Sam couldn’t immediately see the horrific damage.
“I’m still not entirely sure what it is you’re asking of me…” Rowena sounded moments away from asking them where their nearest liquor cabinet was.
Dean was upright from his bed in seconds, fingers curling around the comforting grip of his pistol under the pillow. The sound hadn’t come from his room, rather somewhere else in the apartment – the living room, perhaps? The kitchen? He slowly peeled off the covers, untangling them from his legs and stepping softly onto the dusty carpet, thankful it would mute his footsteps.
“Holy fu-,” Dean didn’t even bother to finish his sentence, turning tail and swimming back towards the shore as fast as his arms and legs could propel him. His heart thudded furiously in his chest with the thrill, laughing uncontrollably as he swam – something about the way that Cas had taken this splash war just a
Sam pulled his pistol out from his back pocket as he reached the door, cocking it and aiming it in preparation towards the doorway as he yanks the door open.
"I had to try and find a common detail in your most active memories. That is, where there was the most activity in your brain."
“Dean, you know that’s what we’re going to be focusing on. I’m just saying that after we get Cas back and we have another pair of eyes with us… it’s something we can look into.”
“You’ll have to.” Castiel’s tone left no room for arguments. Not that it would stop Dean from trying. “Dean, the Empty isn’t something you can fight.”
“Then why’d you do it? If you knew it didn’t matter, why’d you throw yourself in front of that rebar for me?”
Beads of sweat roll down Dean’s temple as he reaches Cas's side, slipping his hands under Cas’s body and heaving him up onto his lap as he sits up as best he can. The dead-weight of Castiel under his hands has his chest squeezing tight with fear, the seconds that tick by without a response from Cas being the most torturous of his life. His eyes search frantically around Castiel’s face for a sign of life, met with closed eyes instead of the dazzling blue that never fails to take his breath away.
"I know it's stupid, but it just seemed fitting for you." Dean said handing over the item. Castiel took it and unfolded it holding it up.
Deans cooking school didn't have a fancy graduation but there was a small ceremony for him and the other chefs in his class. Castiel and Sam came to be there with him, but when Cas had asked why Gabe didn't come, he just sighed and shrugged. Cas was afraid he made Gabe dislike Dean somehow, but he wasn't going to worry about that today. Today was about Dean.
"You- you did?" Dean just shook his head and stood up, headache still throbbing in his skull. He walked out of his bedroom leaving Sam in there all alone.
Dean had been curious for some time now about all the little noises and faces Castiel makes when Dean fucks him. Been curious about what it felt like. Castiel had offered to let Dean try it and that in itself was exciting last night, but after seeing this drawing... hell he felt downright impatient for Cas. He always craves Castiel, craves him like a drug. Cas is an addiction he can't beat, but this is something raw and new that Dean wants to give to Castiel. If not for himself, than just for Cas.
John looked at him a long moment with an unreadable expression. But then he smiled and that smile felt like a win.
"Dean," he spoke firmly. "You have never disappointed me. How could you even think that? I've told you, your health and well-being is the most important thing to me. And Dean you're not healthy," he said standing up and going over to lift up Deans shirt. "I mean look at you! This isn't healthy, Dean. You don't sleep at night, you're scared when it's time to actually fall asleep. You can't focus and you act like everything's okay. It's not!"
He read until the lines and words and symbols melded together. It was almost redundant, since by the time he had finished a page, his mind wouldn't work and he'd have to re-read it. It felt like it was going no where. They still had no clue as to where they could find a reaper, not to mention Deaths scythe was in the empty with Billie. They only had down three ingredients for the binding spell on Death, and no clue where to get the rest. But the more he read, the longer he read, the sooner they'd figure everything out and the sooner he could get Castiel back.
"You a fan?" He smirked in his cocky tone. The reaper finally turned to face him. He had dark brown hair and eyes and a stall stature. He wore a black suit and pea coat  and pulled out a pocket watch, checking the time before clicking it shut.
I went out to go get us breakfast. I'll see you when I get back and we can talk. I love you and I'm so glad your home.
They all ate their spaghetti dinner, conversing with Jack about how he's fixed up heaven and now it's all together. He talked about how Bobby said to say hi to them, and how beautiful it is up there. But he said he was lonely and missed being around them, said they were like his fathers. Dean felt a little happy and sad at being referred to as a father, but didn't say anything.
"C'mon man," Dean said taking a drag. "Try it." He handed the cigarette out to Allen who eyed him sceptically.
Jack froze for a moment, face furrowed in confusion. He almost looked like himself again, considering and contemplating these feelings. Dean always knew Jack was a little broken, much like himself. But the next words were a little unexpected.
"No. It was absolutely horrible. That's why I came screaming, untouched and probably bruising your shoulders." They both chuckled a bit as they straightened up. Dean pulled his pants and panties back up, smiling once he remembered he wore them. Castiel on the other hand, his clothes were soiled and sweaty so he just stripped bare in the living room before stalking up to the bedroom to change. He smiled to himself once again feeling so happy and content. He collapsed back onto the couch from the sheer exhaustion of it all, before his mind wandered back. Suddenly he heard the humming again and his own voice that wasn't his own asking him.
"Dean, mmm." Cas moaned. The sound of his name on Castiels tongue sounded so beautiful, his body actually shuttered with the syllable. He looked at Cas and almost gasped at that piercing look. Castiels eyes were so blue, even before the light of day hit them. Dean came back to himself a little bit looking into Cas's eyes as his hips stuttered out of control. Dean pulled him closer and kissed him hungrily, licking into his mouth. Castiel tensed up and his body froze as he let out a practically sinful sound. Dean followed short after, reduced to a heaving mess, tucked under Cas's chin.
“I have a name,” Castiel grumbles from his spot by the couch, mostly blocking Claire and Kaia from view.
“Yeah, we do,” Dean answers, turning his focus away from Rowena to the man he plans on spending the rest of his life with. “You want me to go first?”
to exist as nothingness. Billy made it promises she wouldn’t keep, keeping it awake when all it wanted to do was to return to sleep. So when it had dragged us into that place, when I fell into that sleep… perhaps it assumed it would be able to return to sleep. But my dreams, my regrets… they weren’t of the type that any another being in the Empty had. My grace wasn’t settling, it was… it was like an animal in a cage, it was…”
“Eh, well, he’s your kid, Cas. ‘The talk’ is your job.” Dean turned back to the various cupboards behind him, trifling through the depleted looking pantry in search of something to eat. “Hey Sam, you seen where those little cheese cracker thingies went?”
“Well, If I were to guess, you’ve spent nearly a third of your life in bars,” Castiel pulled the barstool out, dropping himself down and leaning his arms on the miraculously non-sticky wooden top of the bar. “It’s almost cheating to assume your brain wouldn’t create dreams of bars without your intervention.”
“But…” Castiel begins with a frown. “What about Claire? I took you away from her. I made you miss watching her grow up, I-,”
“Gotta do something, right?” Dean answered with a shrug of his shoulders. “I mean, if I’m not hunting anymore then I’d just be sitting around all day going crazy.”
Castiel’s brow furrows at the pain that flashes across Dean’s scrunched face, letting his hand rest on the side of Dean's face, wanting to just brush the pain away. “We can’t do this like this, Dean. It wouldn’t… we wouldn’t truly be ourselves.”
“Is it true?” Dean repeated his question once more. “Is your grace burning out anyway? Even when you’re not using it?”
more pleasant to have up your nose,” Dean kicked out his legs, pushing himself back a little bit deeper out to sea and away from shore. “You just gonna stand there and take in the view, or you gonna get out here and join me?”
alright. After a few tense minutes of Dean attempting to pick the lock to the room, with Castiel standing watch and praying that no nosy motel attendants peer out the flimsy plastic vertical blinds, they finally break through into the room only to find…
of Cas’s grace, but… that extra bit of grace from you could be the difference between this experiment failing, or saving Cas’s life. It’s all up to you, okay? If you don’t want to do this, we won’t force you into it.”
“Could always give you a fifth of whisky…” Rowena mumbles behind Dean, stood ready in her officiating spot. “I know that calms
His playthings had lost their appeal when there wasn’t any evil in the world to challenge them, so he threw every shitty situation he could their way and watched it unfold. But now he’s bored of that, too. They weren’t following Chuck’s script anymore, and so their usefulness has come to an end.
"Hey, no." Dean argues, the need to tease vanishing when he hears the dejected tone in his little brothers voice.
And wow, what a way for Cas to say it. Like it was just… a matter of fact. Like he was simply stating what the fucking weather was like.
The doctor cracked a warm smile at his words. It must be nice to be the one to sit down with a family member and give them
The little dot next to her name shifted from green to grey, signaling she was offline. Sam continued to stare down at the conversation, expecting it to vanish from his phone at any second. It was… it was real. Her messages were right in front of him, and yet, the pessimistic side of his brain was telling him not to expect for her to show up. Some sort of hallucination brought on by the trauma of this evening. A semblance of hope for his grief addled mind to cling onto.
"But..." Dean tried to argue, unconsciously trying to move towards the house. "My... My son, I can't... I can't just
"Dean, none of this is real." Castiel decided the best approach was to 'rip the bandaid off', metaphorically speaking. "You and Sam were hunting a Djinn up in Washington. Something went wrong."
, along with that solid wall of force that typically comes from such explosions, throwing them across the room.
“Dean?” Castiel calls out his name at the sight of the empty inflatable. He pushes himself up from his own inflatable as his eyes furiously scan across the surface of the water, feeling the panic begin to swirl in his stomach when he doesn’t see a sign of Dean anywhere. His vibrantly colored swimming trunks should make him easy to pick out within the gentle waves, but all Castiel could see was the endless blue of the ocean that surrounded him.
“I know…” Castiel’s words were meant to be one of assurance, but they were more like sympathy. Building upon the fact that he had long since accepted his fate. Which is perhaps why a few more tears escape Dean’s closed lids, trailing down his cheek, clung to his skin as a painful reminder of why they were there.
Both Sam and Dean jumped in their skin at the voice that had appeared in the room. Sam found his hands searching for a knife in his jacket that wouldn’t be there, whilst Dean was planning the best route to his pistol under his pillow that involved skirting past the stranger that had teleported into the middle of his damn room.
love him. She started opening up once I got to work on the other Universes, giving what recommendations she can, what she thinks Chuck would have done; I’m trying to recreate them as best as I could in his image.”
“I think I’ve found something,” Eileen pants, gesturing with her head for Sam to follow as she continues towards the library.
“And I’m too high on wedding happiness right now to reject it,” Dean answered back, unable to even hug Garth back due to his arms being pinned between them.
He hadn’t really tried, truth be told. After Cas had died, the pain of it was still too raw, and thinking about it only ripped the wound open further. He thought it’d be easier to lock the memory away, keep it out of sight and out of mind and find a way to... to move on. It seemed impossible – to keep Cas in his memory, yet simultaneously try to forget about him. Clearly, it hadn’t worked. He might as well have had Cas’s smiling, tear-streaked face etched into his eyelids.
Darkness… One day, God turned to us and said ‘How about we fill in the blanks?’, and then… it was truly remarkable to see, Dean. It took him
If his heart wasn’t already about to give out, it probably would have anyway at the sight of the creature once it had finally pulled itself free. It must have been eight feet tall, maybe nine. The dark slime-like substance of the Empty was oozing off the form – or was it
Exhausted, drained, and knowing full well he should clean up the cum on his Baby’s seats and off his hands before it dried, Dean slid free from Cas and collapsed onto his back, the one arm hooked around Cas’s waist pulling him down with him. He grunted softly as Cas’s full weight landed on him. He gave Cas a gentle nudge, smiling playfully at the satisfied rumble of laugher from Cas that vibrated through his chest where he laid. Cas slid off him, only giving Dean a few seconds to breathe before he settled on his stomach, nestling in close to Dean with his head tucked under his, half of his body laying on the seats with the other half laid across him.
Dean tries to fight down his concern that Cas isn’t kissing him back. In fact, Cas isn’t doing much of anything other than sitting there frozen like a block of ice. When he pulls away from Cas, he’s met with blue eyes wider than he’s ever seen, and a look of both awe and
“We are… That’s what you said, wasn’t it? I asked what about our lives was real, and you said, ‘we are.’ Oh my God, you meant-,” Dean groans sharply, just barely resisting the urge to throw his head back against the windshield.
“Balit qaa ol om Enochian,” Ash replies simply with a knowing smile before his attention is diverted back to the computer in front of him. “Oh, and the stuff you were saying to Dean in that beach dream? Raunchy stuff, dude.”
“I don’t. He’s not an uncle by blood, but that doesn’t matter. Family is more than blood. Dad was dead set on going back, and there’s no way Bobby was gonna say no to looking after us. He wouldn’t leave us like that. So, Bobby took care of us while Dad was away. And you know what? That was the best damn year of my life.”
“No offense Cas, but damn nearly every time you’ve said, ‘I don’t think we can do that’, we find a way to do it anyway.” Dean jabbed a finger at Cas as he spoke. “If we can find a way to recreate your body, would you be able to jump into it without using up the rest of your mojo?”
“Is Sammy okay?” Deans' first question came in the form of a frightened child’s broken, trembling voice. A boy that was trying to be brave - even in the face of absolute horror.
Cas began pulling him up to his feet, faintly tugging at his arm to get him to stand. Dean followed, getting a leg underneath him, leaning his weight on Cas for support to stand. Cas led him over to the map table, hovering nearby as he waited for Dean to drop himself down into one of the chairs before taking a seat himself opposite.
“That still wouldn’t make sense,” Sam butted in, about to fill in with what was going to be Sergei’s next point anyway. “It should have shown up immediately if that was the case, wouldn’t it?”
It played out just as it had that night. The Vamp’s hands on his shoulders, pushing him back with its unnatural strength. He knew where he was headed… he knew what would happen… but he couldn’t stop it. Within seconds, he’d have to feel the agonizing pain of that rebar sliding through his chest again.
He had been woken up – not by his alarm – but by his brother once more. Though, this time, in the form of an annoying string of text messages. Because apparently, Sam can’t type all he needs to in one long message, instead preferring to break it all up into multiple one sentence long text messages that had his phone vibrating so much that it nearly buzzed right off his bedside table.
Eileen raised an eyebrow at Sam’s hesitation, trying to catch his eye when he kept his eyes fixed on Miracle as he stroked a hand down the fur on her back. “Sam?”
“Ouch,” Castiel deadpanned in his gravelly tone. “How did me ordering you the same thing as your brother end up with our dates being mixed up?”
Dean only had to glance at the screen to confirm that yep, that was their conversation from the other night.
level. Most prayers to angels are of the common ones we get: asking for help, for guidance, for a show of faith. They’re rarely ever
Dean sees a flash of a tan trench-coat reflected in the rear-view mirror, blinking into existence with a rustle of wings that he’s not heard of in quite some time.
Their shadow is the first thing Dean see’s through his blurry vision. Frozen at the entrance to the room, the two of them stood next to the door that had been busted open. They’re only still for a moment before they’re racing towards him. There’s another hand on his shoulder – the right, this time. Not the left, that was Cas’s shoulder…
"You're just jealous he likes me more," Dean retaliates, mischievous grin matching the one on the child sat on his lap.
Dean had slowly lowered the cold bottle of beer from his forehead, his gaze fixated on Cas as he moved towards him with a question of “May I?”, the sudden realization that Cas healed
Sam's sharp intake of breath distracts Castiel from his task slightly momentarily, sympathizing with the pained look on his face.
"He was my kid too!" Dean roared, storming across the room to Castiel, shoving a finger into his chest as he yells
“Hello,” Jack greeted them cheerfully with a wave of his hand. “I wasn’t sure what time the actual wedding was, so I thought it’d be better If I arrived first thing in the morning in case-,”
of my grace to keep you alive. The small amount I have left is what’s keeping me tethered to you. The effort it would take to leave you and locate a vessel that could occupy me, to speak with them and then take possession… the effort would burn through what’s left of my grace.”
If Dean clenched his jaw any tighter, he would probably crack a few of his teeth. But it was all he could do to stop himself from punching his fist through the wooden table, so it would have to do. “How long?” Dean croaked out, opening his eyes and feeling the harsh burn of tears building, fighting to speak past the lump that had appeared in his throat.
Dean snapped at him, directing his frustration with himself at his brother. “I can do this! I’m not going to be some fucking weight dragging everyone down.”
“This one I’m… not too sure about,” Sam says, crossing his arms as he holds the paper out, re-reading the spell. “We need a vial of blood from a relative of the vessel. I don’t really know who we can-,”
Somehow, Cas’s face only got redder. Dean cracked up into a fit of laughter at Cas’s expense, who didn’t look too pleased with being the reason for Dean’s amusement.
“I believe so, yes. My grace was… warped. It’s been through a lot, through the fall… but… I believe it had been different from the very start. Chuck was right, in a way. I was ‘the angel with a crack in his chassis’. Maybe that’s why I was the only one. Out of all the other me’s that exist… I was the angel that began to
“Did I break you, Cas?” Dean asks, waving a hand in front of Castiel’s blank face. “Man, I thought when I told you you’d just say congrats and that’d be that, I wasn’t expecting for you to shut down completely-,”
Dean plucked up the beers from the table – already with their lids popped off – passing one of the bottles to Cas and keeping the other for himself. “Might be dangerous once I do… all that power at my finger-tips… how did you not abuse your angel powers more?”
“Never.” Castiel clarified firmly, a little confused as to why this was something Dean was so caught up on.
“Do you think… this is going to be something bigger? Bigger than just us, again?” Eileen asked timidly.
, Cas. I know what those words should have been when you said goodbye to me. I’m not kissing you because I feel bad for you, Cas. I’m kissing you because I love you. It’s as simple as that.”
“That’s just how it was, Cas. Dad didn’t have time for that shit. By the time we came home from school, he was heading off to his night shifts. That was until…”
“You left the room laughing that day, and it had never been harder for me to be mock angry with you, when in reality I wanted to cheer and celebrate a mission well done. I went to Cas immediately after and told him my idea. Cas fell in love with it, and… here we are.”
"What did you mean the night you got back from Arles? When you asked if I was yours?" It was Cas's turn to look away.
"We didn't prep you. And we're covered in paint and on the canvas now." He sighed. Dean reached up and pulled his neck down into a kiss. Cas readjusted to fit between Deans legs and soon understood what he was getting at. Cas ground his hips down against Deans rubbing his erection in the jut of Deans hipbone. Dean bit his lip and reached a hand down in between them grabbing both of their cocks in his fist. Dean smirked to himself as Castiels knees buckled with the touch. Dean used the hand without paint on it and made a tight grip around both of their members and stroked tightly and slow, toying with the heads on the upstroke. They both groaned and kissed each other through their noises.
There was a bit of silence from everyone and Deans nerves were singing before Bobby came and wrapped him in a hug. Soon after, everyone else came and hugged him or patted him on the back telling him that they're proud of him. Lastly, Cas leaned in close and kissed him tenderly and sweet on the lips.
"Don't even worry about it. Here," he said walking to bring Cas the cup of coffee. "Breakfast will be done in just a moment, why don't you take a seat out on the balcony?" He punctuated with a kiss on Castiels temple.
And just like that he was gone from his life again. Only now there was someone else who may be gone from his life and he couldn't let that happen. Castiel quickly pulled out his phone to text Dean.
"Like hell you're not! Do you know what my life was before you? I was a drug addiction, painter who couldn't paint who was fucking random French boys every weekend to fill the hole in my life-"
"I'm going back to bed." Dean said gruffly. He was not doing this now. He just needed to suck it the hell up like his father told him. Get over it. Sam didn't try and stop him so he just went back into his bedroom.
Castiel pulled almost all the way out before pushing back in all the way home. Dean let out a moan that was more different than Cas had heard before. It was more high pitched, more desperate. So Castiel moved just like that again, trying to get Dean to make those sounds. He kept the pace slow and steady for well over a half hour but Dean was whimpering in a silent request for more and it was getting hard to hold back for himself as well. Without warning Cas leaned down to suck a mark onto Deans pulse and snapped his hips forward.
"First you just want a one night stand, then you want to sleep together. You say you don't want a relationship or don't want to date. They you want to date me but only commit once before not seeing me again days after. I don't know what you want."
"Goodbye, Dean." And just like that he was pushed out of the way and hit the wall. It all happened so fast and then he was being taken. The blackness wrapped around him he knew Billie had made it in and was taken in too but he didn't care. He was gone. Castiel, was actually gone. He could feel his heart in his throat and his stomach was hit with nausea. He curled on to the floor trying to will himself to breathe. With Castiel gone it was like someone ripped the oxygen from the earth. All he ever wanted just happened and it was taken away in the twinkling of an eye. Dean just lost his own world and he couldn't even breathe. He cradled his face in his hands and cried. He cried harder than he ever had before. He lost Castiel five times before. Each death of the angel got harder and harder the more they knew each other. But something told Dean this was final. And the worst part, of all the twelve years he had known Castiel, he died thinking that no one loved him. No one had ever told him that they loved him. The sudden realization caused Dean to sob even harder. Dean couldn't breathe he was crying so hard. His face muscles ached with how much emotion was being forced on them.
Dean woke in the middle of the night to an empty bed. He groaned slightly missing the feeling of Castiels warm body snuggled next to his. He sat up and looked around the dark room in search of him but quickly relaxed when he heard the bathroom sink. Castiel came out of the bathroom a moment later, but to Deans surprise he didn't crawl back in bed. If Cas had noticed Dean was awake, he didn't say anything. Instead he walked around the bed clad in a silky blue robe that Dean found to be quite hot, and grabbed something from his nightstand. He walked back over to the window sill and sat down on the cushioned bench and started sketching away. Deans eyes were mostly closed but he could tell that Castiel kept looking at him. The room was dark, the only lights were those of the city and from the moon coming in through the window which was probably why Castiel was sitting there. He didn't know why Cas felt the need to draw right then and there but he didn't mind. He listened to the soft sound of the pencil scratching and the sound of the paper crinkling when he'd brush off the led. It was calming and grounding and overall peaceful.
"You shouldn't let him dictate your life, you know? You're an excellent cook and you make an amazing gay lover," Castiel smirked. "So no matter what he says to you, you shouldn't let it affect you."
"Dean," Cas said turning to face him seriously. "I will never get bored of what we do. I love everything we do. We could go to gentle hand jobs and I would still be satisfied. I don't want more, I want you. Okay?"
"Not that," Dean rolled his eyes. He bit his lip as he pulled the last of his buttons. "Remember the night with the paint? Where we- uh, on the canvas?"
"Well if you hurry up and eat, maybe I could take you back home and make that sketch come to life." Dean looked up eyes wide but his pupils were suddenly dilated.
"Well, I would like to take him to the prom with your permission." Castiel joked. Castiel beamed when John barked a laugh.
"I would never." Slowly and reluctantly Dean walked into the frame of his phones propped up on the kitchen counter. Dean couldn't look up at his phone, not even to see Castiel because he was so embarrassed. Cas was silent for a long time and Dean flushed an even brighter red.
It started with texting. Dean and Castiel would text nearly every day planning for their next late night rendezvous together. It had been over two months since Castiel took Dean to his place for the first time and they were having sex on a constant. It went from once a week to a minimum of three times a week. It was always at Cas's place because Dean still didn't want Cas to see his place yet. Plus often times Sam and Gabriel were there as well. They spend many nights and early mornings tangled in the sheets, muscles pleasantly sore and minds pleasantly clouded. Castiel wanted to get Dean to go all the way but he was nervous for that still, and Cas couldn't blame him. So Cas just had to learn to deal with a sore ass every day after Dean left.
"Okay... is it like a sexy surprise?" Dean smirked coming out of the kitchen with some freshly made garlic bread.
Deans had one night stands. Plenty. It was never too awkward because he know he was never going to see them again. Even with the other women he's dated, it's never been like this. But he supposes it's not so much the fact that he's a man as opposed to the fact that they've now shared something beyond what he's given to any other woman. Not even with Lisa or Cassie had he ever been so... present.
The man looked taken back by the fact that Dean understood him. So much so that Cas would've laughed if he wasn't so scared as to what could happen. The man simply sighed.
Dean was sitting in his flat watching tv in the living room while Cas slept soundly in Deans bedroom. The sun had just gone down and Castiel had passed out right after Dean gave him a blow job to which Dean just chuckled before going out to the living room. Dean wasn't really listening to the television only the soft sounds of Cas's snoring emanating from the bedroom down the hall. Dean decided to check the mail since he wasn't quite tired yet.
Dean was relaxed into the feeling of Castiels hands and kisses, the sound of his voice that he was floating somewhere outside of his own body. Just then he finally let his finger breach him. Deans jaw fell open at the sensation. He never in a million years would imagine being here, yet here he was. He was taken off guard by the fact that it didn't hurt, didn't burn or sting. It was an interesting stretch that felt slightly uncomfortable and odd, yet he found himself wanting more. Castiel curved his finger inside of him and he nearly shot off of the bed. Dean had been fingered before. An old girlfriend Rhonda Hurley convinced Dean to try all sorts of things. Like panties, makeup, and Dean even let her peg him just once. So he knew what to expect, but still it was never like this. Castiels fingers were both soft and rough at the same time. Dean was panting as Castiel thrusted his finger in and out of him, half heartedly meeting his mouth and kissing back. Castiel added a second finger and started to scissor him open. Dean closed his eyes and concentrated on the the feeling. Concentrated on Cas whispering to him,  thanking him for loving him. Dean was lost. He wasn't in pain as it was, but it was still new and a little scary. He needed that embrace. Castiel just hushed Dean and held him close in the moment.
The three of them talked, mostly about lighthearted things. They talked so long, Cas had to reheat their food so they didn't go hungry. They ate and socialized and overall, Cas thought that John actually liked him which made him happy. John shared some stories about Dean as a kid, and how he sort of always figured Dean was queer. By the time they started to run out of things to talk about it was around nine, and John had to go since it was eleven there. They hung up and Dean sighed back into the couch.
"Drink." He said tilting Cas's head in his hand for him to swallow a bit of the water. After it went down he sighed and nuzzled into the blankets. He felt Deans strong soft hands carding through his hair.
Castiel told himself he was not going to date, he told himself he wasn't going to catch feelings, but right now... Deans head was pillowed on his chest, his hair tickling his chin. His hot breath ghosting over his neck and his soft olive skin touching his. Their legs tangled in the sheets and the still ever present taste of the younger man on his tongue, not to mention being called Angel. Castiel might have a problem here.
"Yeah well," Cas snapped his hips forward making Dean moan loudly. "I've never felt anything like this before. Fuck seemed like a fitting word." He breathed heavily.
"No uh... I have an announcement." Everyone turned eyes on him and he scooted out of his seat a bit nerves getting the better of him. "Growing up... my dad raised me to be a solider. Never love anyone because with this life, hunting, you lose them. The family business always came first. Saving people, hunting things, no matter the cost. I've realized now how stupid that is. We've lost good people... family, all because of the hunt. I always listened to my dad, even when it came to me liking guys... but I realize now more than ever, that I have people I'm not ready to lose yet. Or ever again. Hunting isn't my number one anymore and although I'll always want to help people, I can't do this life anymore. So," Dean sighed. "I'm quitting hunting. I want my apple pie life."
The two made their way back into the bathroom and took a long hot shower together. Dean could get used to the feeling of hot water on his back. But he could get even more used to the feeling of Castiels mouth around him. The two had a long hot round of shower sex before they voted on actually getting clean together. By the time they were done it was a little before ten and Dean quickly got dressed before he left to go to school.
Dean choked a bit on his food before his eyes widened as if he was searching for the lie in Castiels eyes.
"I'll go to him." Dean hung up before he could say another word. He grabbed his shit which was just his book bag, a pair of sweatpants, his meds and the keys to the Impala. He headed to the front desk to return his key before going to baby. It was dark out and the clock on the Impala said it was midnight but Baby was still an hour off, so it was only eleven at night. He started her up and realized he needed to stop for gas on the way back home. Okay maybe he was stalling a little bit, but a fresh tank of gas couldn't hurt. He took the longer route home, mainly planning out what he was going to say. By the time he was in the parking lot, his heart felt like it was beating out of his rib cage. He turned off the engine and headed up the steps to their room. He turned the key slowly to open there flat. The lamp was on in the living room just enough to see as he shrugged out of his coat. He bit back bile when he say the empty wine bottles on the counter and forced down tears when he saw their pictures stacked on the coffee table. Like he was looking at them and drinking his pain away how Dean has done so often. Cas was no where in sight and Dean assumed he must be asleep in bed. The curtains over the glass doors to the bedroom weren't drawn so he carefully opened one to find Cas in bed.
"Of course I feel the same way. This," he gestured in between them. "Is all I've ever wanted. And now it's all I need. This is my happiness. You. It's always been you."
"What, this?" Castiel asked slamming in hard hitting Deans prostate. Dean practically screamed from the sheer force of it. Castiel knows when Dean gets close. His skin gets clammier and his limbs tremble a bit not to mention he clenches down too. Just as Dean was on the cusp of orgasm, Castiel yanked his head back forcefully by the hair making him groan.
"If I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me?" He began to sing the intro. He sang the next lines and altered them slightly, because that what he and Cas used to do together when they'd sing a new song. "But if I stay here with you, boy. Things just couldn't be the same," the chains started to glow brighter each second and his eyes were wet with tears and his lips hurt with his smile. "Bye-bye, baby, it's been sweet love, yeah, yeah. Though this feelin' I can't change, and Lord knows I'm to blame." He sand the rest of the song, the chains getting brighter and brighter with each verse until he was sure they couldn't get any brighter. He looked around, but Cas wasn't there still.
Dean hadn't been as nervous to fly this time around, Cas could tell. They flew in first class again since he got another painting deal that offered him another fifty grand. At this rate he was seriously thinking of buying them a house since he had the money. A lot of it that he didn't know what to do with it. They were nearing the end of his flight and Dean was much more relaxed with some complementary champagne in him. Dean kept shifting in his seat, but Cas knew it wasn't from his fear of planes. He leaned in close and whispered:
He looked across the bathroom and decided to get up and wash his face and brush his teeth. When he looked up into the mirror he jumped when he saw Cas behind him in the reflection. He spun around but he was gone. Must be the alcohol or wishful thinking.
"Dean, you're a grown man. You can make your own decisions. A time ago I would've been pissed, but now I just want you to be happy. Whatever that comes in."
"Look, everyone is coming over tonight. Well, not everyone. But Donna, Jody, Eileen, and Garth are."
"Well, men are kind of... different. Girls are so... just too much. With their perfume and makeup and panties and the hair. Guys are simple. Not to mention have you seen Matt Dillon from the Outsiders?"
"I appreciate you standing up for me, but I just don't want you to get hurt for your obnoxious ego."
"How would you feel about having a key here? It's just that- well those times when you drop by unannounced, there always kind of great. And I don't mind having you around. So you could just come over anytime."
Dean woke up early the next morning. Sam and Eileen were still asleep in the bunker. Dean sauntered off to the bathroom and took a much needed shower. The hot spray against his back did as much good as possible what with the now constant ache in his muscles from getting very little sleep. He didn't take too long since he didn't know when Sam would be up and he didn't want to accidentally flash his little brother, so he stepped out of the shower and tossed a towel around his waist. The steam of the room covered the mirrors, but he couldn't bring himself to look up. Last time he saw Cas, he couldn't stand to see him again. So close, yet so far away.
"For trusting me. I know that wasn't easy to share and I admire you for opening up to me. Thank you."
"You look like shit." Cas said looking Dean up and down. To be fair he did. He was wearing boxers and an old Zeppelin t-shirt with holes in it. He hadn't shaved and only showered after he had to throw up.
"Yeah. He was afraid of moving back to Kansas and not seeing Gabe, so Gabe just told him to move in."
"No Dean, it's okay. I get it. The first time me and Eileen... well, we didn't see each other for a while after. It was awkward for a bit, but it just turned out we needed to... explore a little more. Get used to it."
"What took so long? I was waiting for ten minutes after you texted." Sam grumbled as Dean got in the passenger side.
"He's right." Dean smiled coming out of the kitchen to sit next to Castiel. "But I'm afraid it's not going to be the turkey and gravy meal. More or less you guys taste testing my pies."
Why did it have to be like this? They were supposed to write their own story, make their own ending. Chuck even let them believe it all those years ago.
Cas clearly tried not to smile. "Sometimes." He leaned over and gave Dean a long, soft kiss. "You need to get some sleep. If I leave, do you promise you'll talk to me tomorrow?"
"Oh I almost forgot!" Cas said suddenly as he hopped up from the couch. He came back from the bedroom in a matter of seconds with Deans necklace. "Whole reason you came here right?" Castiel smiled hooking the necklace on for Dean.
"I can sing for you, Dean," Cas smiled. "But you will have to talk to me about these things. So I know."
"Dean, it's fine. We need to take Robin to a hospital anyways." Cas said sitting up. Dean helped him to his feet and they walked across the yard to where Robin was still laying. It didn't take long to realize that he wasn't waking up. Cas looked at Dean with concern and Dean knelt down to check for a pulse.
"Yeah... Sam said we should practice." Dean chuckled a little. Castiel huffed a laugh that vibrated in his chest and ghosted his breath under his ear.
Deans father was just how he imagined. A bit of a crude sense of humor, firm handshake rather than a hug. A little awkward around Cas. But he still made an effort and acted perfectly friendly. Him, Dean, John and his wife Kate went out to a nice dinner together that Cas payed for. Like he said, too much money.
He and Dean hadn't been having sex after he started taking them. And two weeks later, suddenly his libido is back in tact. He had been losing weight, seemed exhausted despite his happiness. And there were those nights where Cas had to hold him and sing to him. He asked if Cas was real. God how could he be so stupid?
"Mmhmm. Could you turn around for me?" Dean complied spinning slowly to show off the mesh back that no doubt exposed the majority of his ass. "Do you miss me?"
The other man had shaggy light brown hair, some might call it blonde but it wasn't. He was shorter than the other man but not by too much. He had strong, sharp features such as his nose and jawline. His lips were plump and pink and so tempting even all the way over here. But that wasn't the most captivating part. The most striking part of this mystery man was his green eyes. They were like beautiful emeralds and summer grass. So placating and beautiful Castiel had to swallow his suddenly dry mouth.
"Yes. Seeing as how we've done this more than one night. Also none of my French boys have ever made me breakfast before. And I certainly haven't let them fuck me on my kitchen island." He chuckled.
Within an hour an a half he had the skyline painted realistically and he was actually proud of how it turned out. The sun was starting to creep up the horizon as he took his painting into view. His eyelids felt heavy again as the exhaustion creeped in. He pulled his still wet canvas and easel inside. He quietly opened his bedroom doors again to find Dean still sprawled out on the covers, a true beauty there. He shed his robe on the floor crawling back into bed naked. The second he was under the covers Dean nuzzled into him mumbling in his sleep. He smiled at how adorable it was but willed himself not to admire the man in his arms too much. This was a one time thing.
