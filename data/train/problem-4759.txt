Happy Saturday!! It had been raining all week but today is sunny and lovely!! So now I am hiding in the shade.
“They're growing?” Charlie asked, confused. “How?”
Dean raised eyebrow. “Well that sounds like innuendo.”
"I'm sorry."
Sammy rolled his eyes and said " Anyways, I will talk to Castiel about getting the keys. I can stop by in the morning with some real clothes for you."
It wasn't until a week later when he was recounting the story to Cas (Dean really liked telling the part where they had told the truth to be labeled crazy) that Cas found out how close Dean had been to dying. They were alone in a hotel room; Sam had gone to a bar to do some pool hustling.
If Dean didn't like future him, he really didn't like future Cas, albeit for very different reasons. Future him was a dick, and future Cas was a womanizing stoner. He was also apparently basically human. That last part didn’t really matter to Dean but it was weird.
Dean’s tone still had a bite when he asked, "how was it?"
Cas's POV
"I'm so sorry, Cas," Charlie kept repeating as she surveyed the damage. "I had no idea that would happen. I'm so sorry."
Castiel patted his shoulder in sympathy. “Dean never forgets.”
When Lucifer heard Dean’s prayer he quickly finished his meeting with Gabriel; they had been making plans for the end of the apocalypse. After the last two times he had ignored his future mates, though, he didn’t want to keep them waiting. Gabriel told him to say hi for him as Lucifer flew off.
It was Cas who convinced him to go. He had listened to Sam, Gabe and Dean's arguments, then quietly said, “I would like to have another drink with you.”
Dean exchanged looks with Sam. Finally Sam said “why doesn’t Cas meet up with her to be on the safe side. If everything is fine then we can all meet up and try to help her.”
“Goodnight Meg,” Gabe sang as he walked away.
Dean ignored the snickers he heard from Sam and Gabe, focusing instead on the eggs in front of him.
Sam’s face lit up then it quickly fell to his normal concerned look. Dean could tell he was ready to find a reason why he couldn’t so he quickly spoke up, “Just think about it. Maybe talk to Bobby. We can’t really do any big planning until we know for sure the apocalypse is over.”
Dean looked over to see Meg standing in the street. She tried to convince Sam to go with her to see Lucifer and when they declined she revealed the trick up her sleeve: she had hellhounds with her. Dean hated hellhounds.
He managed to pull his eyes away when Dean sat back on his heels and looked over at him. He was sure his face was bright red but Dean either didn't notice or was polite enough not to say anything as he said, "Well, there is a lot of damage. If you just want it fixed quick and cheap I can have it done in a couple days. But if you quality it's going to take me a couple weeks, maybe a month."
Epilogue
Cas nodded and moved away so that they could both strip. Dean made sure to toss the clothes for enough from the nest that they wouldn't catch fire later. Once naked he grabbed the bottle of oil and lay back in the nest. He opened the bottle and coated his fingers with the oil. Then eyes locked with Cas, who was standing just outside the nest, Dean pushed the first finger inside himself.
Cas strode past them and stepped in front of Gordon. He stared a moment then said something in a language Dean had never heard before. The air around Gordon lit up briefly. Cas then joined Dean to walk to the house. A look over his shoulder revealed Gordon being led away by Donna and Bobby. They would probably stay with him until this time for him to leave town.
Dean started his apology by handing Sam the demon killing knife. Then he started his real apology. He told Sam that though they might be each other's weakness, they also kept each other human.
Bobby looked at him and raised an eyebrow, waiting for him to finish.
They stayed like that almost an hour before Sam came in. He saw them and tried to back right back out but Castiel called to him, “Come in Sam, it’s alright.”
Dean grinned. They might fight sometimes but he and Sam were brothers and had each other's backs. He only hoped his kids were as loyal to each other in the future.
“We could open you up wide and have you together, maybe?” he paused to nip at his mark again and asked again, “What would you like Dean?”
Luckily he heard footsteps a few minutes later. Sam came bursting through the door followed by Cas and Gabe and shouted, “what's wrong?”
“Why don't you just stop by his office during his office hours?” Charlie suggested.
She was able to help them get into the ground of Crowley mansion. They thanked her and she stayed to keep an eye out while they went to find crowley.
"I think I'll set up a stall in the market. Sell a few potions and protective charms. Hopefully I'll be able to find a few more serious clients," Sam said.
(See the end of the chapter for
"The omega!" Sam exclaimed, a look of epiphany on his face.
Cole swaggered forward. Behind him Balthazar was rolling his eyes. Cas thanked years of discipline for keeping him from reacting. While Cole took a seat Castiel studied him. He was handsome, not really Cas's type but he had a rugged appeal. The biggest problem, that he could see, was that arrogance seemed to seep out of every pore of the man. Cas was no stranger to arrogant men in his employment. Balthazar and Gabriel, the other man in the room, were examples of that. But they worked with him and knew the line. Cas wasn't sure if Cole did.
“Yes. Absolutely.” Cas agreed. “But not just food. Everyone seems to be starving for something: Sex, attention drugs, love.”
Cas and Gabe being brothers for your enjoyment!
"Like War and Famine?" Sam asked, "just being in proximity to them had an effect on people." He paused and looked thoughtful. Then he looked back at Dean. "That's pretty smart. I can start looking into it. Maybe the CDC has something I can track?"
Stay safe out there!!
They finished with Cas and Lucifer stepped forward to switch places. As Cas turned to face him Dean happened to look down and froze. He gave a whimper and felt a fresh gush of slick escape him.
He had told Dean about seeing his father, of course. Dean had immediately called Sam over to hear what Cas had to say. Cas had given them all the details he remembered including that he had a girlfriend and a son that was studying to be a doctor.
Dean walked her to the door and gave her a hug. She hugged him tight and told him that she would check in on him over then next week. Then Dean spoke for the first time in two days.
Sam's 18, Dean's 22, and Cas is 28 (kinda young for a doctorate but he's smart)
Cas rushed forward in a low tackle to Sam’s stomach. Sam had height and even weight on Cas but he was no match for the alpha’s strength. Dean watched as the two men grappled for several minutes until Cas managed to pin Sam down. It was really hot to see.
Dean headed towards the door then stopped. "You coming, Sam?" He asked his brother.
Cas's POV
Dean gave it a look over then unwrapped it and took a careful bite out of one corner. It tasted fine so he happily munched away, muttering “awesome.”
“I can’t believe he’s human,” Lucifer confessed.
Lucifer's POV
“That’s what Dean said,” Shepherd told her. “I still haven’t heard the man speak or anything but when I almost called him the nickname Dean had given him, Cas, he glared at me until i said his full name.”
Gabe smiled. “This is perfect.”
“I don't think he's human,” Jo told him conspiratorially.
Dean glared at Sam but in the back of his mind he was already making plans to talk to Charlie. Charlie was good with computers. She could do something to make Becky’s life miserable. The idea cheered Dean up.
It was a little after 10 when Gabe finally made his way to Dean’s room. The omega wasn’t in sight but the room stunk of panicked omega. He wrinkled his nose at the smell.
She laughed and went to get him something. While he waited Dean looked around the room. It was full of familiar faces, either townsfolk or travelers, such as merchants, hunters, and mercenaries. As a blacksmith, and the only one for several towns at that, Dean met most of them. So when he spotted a man sitting alone at the table he had to ask Jo what his story was.
“I'll go get our blankets,” Dean said in response. He turned to head back to where their stuff was Cas stopped him.
Dean laughed. “You know, you are a pretty funny guy Cas.”
"Thank you Dean," Cas said, looking the cup over. He looked up to see Dean rubbing the back of his neck, looking slightly embarrassed.
Dean gave him a look and took another sip of his coffee. He knew Sam couldn’t help himself, he had to be nosy. Sam waited but when Dean didn’t answer he continued, “Cas said something about you being upset that Lucifer hasn’t come around?”
Being in a relationship with Cas was surprisingly easy. They had been friends for so long they already knew each other's annoying habits. That didn't mean they didn't have any problems but it was the same as with any new relationship.
"It hasn't even been a month," Dean jokingly chided him.
Lucifer had to give him that. It wasn't like anyone really knew that Lucifer had decided not to participate in the apocalypse. He wondered how he was going to explain it to Micheal. He knew at some point they would have to meet.
In the back of his mind he realized this was likely not a good place to start a courtship but he was so angry.
When they got there Dean took the lead. Mary didn’t want to talk to them but when John came over Dean introduced him and Sam as Mary’s cousins. It got them in the door. Sam was a little weird seeing younger versions of their parents, but Dean figured given that Sam never knew their mom it was understandable.
Louder but still hiding his face in the glass Chuck said, "He has to get mated."
Dean really wanted to have a talk with the angel. They hadn't had the easiest relationship so far but the dude had helped him out when he had needed it the most. Plus he wanted an answer for the message he had left in Dean's head. It had sounded an awful lot like a goodbye.
He sent a prayer to Lucifer and heard his wings as he landed.
Lucifer nodded. He thought he knew where Gabriel was going with the conversation.
It had taken him so long that he barely made it through the door before Cas was handing him Claire and rushing out after Sam. Dean juggled his basket of food into the kitchen so he could set it down and turn his attention to Claire. A quick inspection showed that her diaper was dry and clean and she didn't seem hungry. Satisfied, he put her on a blanket with some toys, checked the other two who were still asleep, and quickly chopped up some meat and vegetables to throw in a pot for dinner.
"So who did you chicken out of asking out this time?" Dean asked, keeping his voice casual and light.
Dean watched him take another pass and suggested "how about a movie?"
Gabe smiled and stuck out his hand to shake Kate’s. “Nice to meet you. What’s made you think about coming here?”
This time Dean did let him off the hook. He gave him a small smile then hit play of the movie he had been watching. Sam took the peace offering for what it was and settled in to watch the ending of Batman Begins and drink his beer.
The path had been widened and the ground was smooth out so Dean wasn't at risk of hurting his feet. They walked in silence. Dean couldn't even imagine what was going on in Cas’s mind.
“What did he mean by it’s too late?” Sam asked when Lucy and Cas gave their report of defeating Pestilence.
The movie was fun. It wasn't one Dean or Sam had seen before even though it was several years old. It was called Willow and was surprisingly funny for a movie that was really about two men and a baby.  Dean and Sam especially liked the Brownies. It was no Star Wars or Indiana Jones (both also by George Lucus) but it was one Dean could see himself watching again.
Lucifer apologizes!
I hope everyone is having a good week and looking forward to an awesome weekend.
Lucifer smiled at him. "Thanks Gabriel."
Sam was also smiling but Bobby looked confused and annoyed. “What is going on?” he demanded. “What is done?”
Sam nodded and backed up enough that Dean could get out of bed. He went back to his own bed and pulled out a book to read while he waited. Dean shook his head at his brother, grabbed some clean clothes from his duffle and made his way to the bathroom.
It was still too early to go to bed so Gabe grabbed his laptop and a book. He settled into the nest, sinking into the still fresh scent of him and his brother. It smelled like family.
more worried about Sam. Dean watched as Sam either died or passed out (he was hoping for the latter) and Anna advanced on Mary. Anna apologised but wasn’t going to stop.
Castiel gave a slight nod, "apparently my work is not done yet." He looked over at the window, the same one he had died in front of. Then he turned back to Chuck. "What is this other way to stop the apocalypse?"
Castiel was waiting for him when he got there. He had changed into pajamas as well and had pulled out some of their softest blankets to add to the nest. That was something normally reserved for when one of them was on the edge of feral so Gabe took it as an indication of how bad Cassie was.
"Raise the shield," Elizabeth ordered, somewhat unnecessarily as the technician had already done so.
Castiel considered this. Finally he said, “For most of our brothers and sisters one of the trio being out of touch for even a few years would not be a big deal. We live forever and there are very few things that can kill us. But that’s not the case for us. Even if Dean wasn’t human and we were all normal angels, we are in the middle of the apocalypse. Angels and demons are at war and there are casualties on both sides. We all need to be better at keeping in touch with each other.”
Again Michael spread his wings to fly away. Before he vanished Dean yelled “don’t forget to give us our brother back.”
Dean opened his eyes to see the sexiest thing he had ever witnessed. Lucifer had lifted up his fingers to taste Dean’s slick then he offered it to Cas. As Cas licked Lucifer’s fingers Dean couldn’t take it anymore and came.
She smirked. “But oh what a way to go.”
She had more questions but she put them aside as they watched Sam Winchester enter the room where the man, Castiel apparently, was sitting.
The next time he woke up it was in the same place but it looked like a war zone. When he went exploring he was almost attacked. He got away only to see writing on a wall announcing "croatoan".
Two warnings before you read the chapter: 1 there is some sexual content. 2 I'm not super confident in my writing of sexual content. I hope it's ok. Also Dean's sex toys get to feature in this chapter (see I didn't put them in the story for no reason).
"If the omega is the one you were looking for and you choose to court them, you have to stop the apocalypse." Castiel stated.
“I'm there now.” Cas said into his phone, even as they stared into each other's eyes.
Now Dean was really confused. "Then why am I here?"
Cas got a crestfallen look and asked "are you two…?" He trailed off.
She was surprised to see Sam Winchester's name listed on the team's roster for AR12. She read further and learned that it was the team's second visit to the planet and when there last time they had discovered ruins covered in Ancient. Upon their return they had requested a second visit with a translator. Elizabeth had agreed then promptly forgotten it.
Cas started to move and Dean couldn't help but moan. It had been a while since he’d had anything other than his fingers or toys inside him. There was something about someone else controlling the action that let Dean relax and enjoy.
They looked around for Cas and didn't see him. Then Dean heard a voice he had hoped not to hear again say " There you are."
Gabe wasn’t sure what he was expecting when he met Sam Winchester but it wasn’t this nervous giant, pacing the waiting area. He knew that Sam was a beta, Cassie had told him and he lacked an alpha scent, but he didn't know betas could grow that big. If it wasn’t for the beta woman by his side and the fact he was related to Gabe’s patient, Gabe would be all over that. He sighed inwardly, what a loss.
“My mark,” Cas explained. He lay his hand over it. It spread a warm, content feeling through Dean. “My mate,” Cas stated.
Dean had never liked Uriel and was not happy to see him again. He backed up to see Anna standing in the house as well. He and Sam exchanged a look and, knowing it was useless, took the offence. It did not go well. As Uriel beat on him Dean saw Anna send John flying out of the house then stab Sam with something. Dean didn’t care that Uriel had him by the throat, he was
Dean grinned and launched into his tale. For some reason he knew Cas wouldn't care that Dean's ex was a man so Dean gave him the true tale and not the fiction he normally shared. Cas seemed confused by the idea that loving another man would cause Dean to be driven out of town.
That was good news but Cas was still annoyed. It had been a year since he and Dean had started dating. He was talking to Gabe again, though not as much as before. Part of the problem was that every once in a while some demon, or other creature attacked Cas. It acted as a reminder of why Cas had stopped talking to him in the first place. Gabe had been trying to make amends any way he could. Mostly this seemed to be through candy arrangements. Cas didn’t have the biggest sweet tooth but Dean seemed to find it funny.
"I'm going to head out early," Dean informed Benny. "Lock up for me?"
Dean grinned at him. He looked over to Gabe to see the archangel looking at him closely. Dean raised an eyebrow. Gabe looked a little sheepish and said, “There is something different about you. I don’t know what yet.”
He actually sounded a little annoyed and Cas felt worse about the damage.
Cas would know what to do. Plus Dean really needed a friendly face. A small part of him just wanted the alpha (his alpha, he secretly thought) to tell him everything was going to be alright. Maybe he would even know where Sam was.
Cas set the glass he'd been holding down and sat back. He didn't think this partnership was going to work out. It was easier for him, and better business to partner with someone with an existing trade than to start one from scratch. But in this case…
When school ended Castiel stayed by Dean's side while they waited for Dean's family to come get him. Castiel could have left at any time, he normally waited for his daddy in the principal's office; he didn't want to leave his new friend though. All the other kids had left before anyone came to pick up Dean. Castiel had noticed Dean was getting sad so he lent him his favourite stuffy to hug and also held Dean's hand as they waited. They waited so long Castiel started to think no one was coming.
Meg nodded, understanding.
They watch Lego Batman. Dean loved it. Castiel thought it was funny but he mostly liked it because Dean did. They sat close together sharing a bowl of popcorn. Castiel was so happy he barely knew what to do.
Dean and Cas had met with her and Sam not long after they started dating and told her that everything was forgiven. Even with that it took a bit of time for the two men to warm back up to her. But Sam loved her so they made the effort and now they were all getting along great.
“How do you know they're dragon’s eggs?” Dean blurted out dumbly. He could kick himself for how  stupid that question was and how much it hid nothing.
Dean put his untouched beer on a table and turned to leave. He knew he should say something, or see if Cas still needed a ride but all he wanted was to get out. He heard his brother say his name but he ignored it. He could talk to Sam tomorrow. He couldn't talk now if he tried.
Gabe was barely listening. He was stuck on the fact that Sam hadn’t talked to his omega brother in four years. If that happened to Gabe, if Castiel stopped talking to him, he would have gone feral in a matter of months not years.
It wasn't long before Dean's phone rang again. "I followed him. It's not far, but it's layered in Enochian warding magic. I can't get in." Cas sounded frustrated.
Sam shook his hand and gestured for Castiel to sit down even as he stared. This was the man his brother had called adorable, clueless and a baby in a trenchcoat (at least the trenchcoat part made sense). Nothing about the man now sitting in front of him fit with what Dean had described.
"Did you hear what he said," Sam asked. Dean nodded dumbfounded. "Thus might be our best chance."
He looked rough, like he had been in a fight and Dean desperately wanted to check him over for injuries. Without mean to Dean let out a low whine. Instantly Sam enveloped him in a hug. They stayed that way for several minutes before Sam managed to coax him back to the bed. Sam tried to distract him by talking about his school work and the interesting facts he had learned about alphas and omegas. Dean half listened.
When he raised his head again, he saw that Ellen and Bobby had taken Kate and Adam under their wings off to the side. Benny was putting the BBQ away with Jo helping and taking stuff into the kitchen. Meg caught his eye and waved goodbye before disappearing towards the front of the house where she would have parked. Sam was talking quietly with Gabe and Balthazar. Cas thought he heard something about a restraining order. He would ask Sam later.
"Meeting him after class," Dean told him.
“They said the fight might get hairy. But it is the devil. So we gotta stop him.” Adam answered.
Babies were cute, evil creatures, designed to deprive you of sleep and sanity, Dean decided. it seemed like there was always at least one awake needing a bottle, diaper change, or just cuddles. Luckily Cas was still living in the smithy with him, so they took turns sleeping. Sam, Gabe and Charlie were also big helps. They brought food and entertainment to the smithy.
Dean's shoulders slumped as the anger seemed to leave him. "Alright. Let me get my tools and we'll see what I can do about those holes before someone steps in one and breaks a leg."
He and Cas hung out for several more hours, drinking and talking. They switched from hard liquor for getting drunk to beer, a most social drink. Before they parted for the night, Dean told Cas to stop by his smithy anytime he wanted to hang out. Then they went their separate ways.
"Maybe," Dean replied, noncommittally.
Dean was close to panic and both Cas and Sam were looking at him in concern. Cas walked over to Dean and patted him awkwardly on the shoulder. It was as if he’d seen a picture of the action but never experienced it. It did startle a laugh out of Dean. Cas looked very pleased with himself.
John Winchester arrived only ten minutes or so after he sent his text. He walked in with a swagger and confidence like it was his house, not one he was visiting. Cas could almost admire that if it didn't come off as arrogant (and if Cas didn't already hate him). There was a falter to his step, though, when he saw Cas standing next to Kate and Adam.
“The cave is bigger than I had thought,” Cas told him excitedly. “I think we'll do nicely as a nest.”
Dean wasn’t happy. Sam confirmed that Cas was still breathing and together they dragged him to a hotel. Sam left Dean to deal with it and Dean booked Cas five nights up in the honeymoon suite. Telling the manager not to disturb him. The manager, a beta, had given him a knowing look and asked if he wanted to buy some dope.
Gabe went and checked in on all his other patients while they waited for Castiel to get there. While he was gone Sam showed up. Dean told him that Cas would be by in an hour or two. Sam was happy for him and did his best to keep Dean distracted to help the time pass.
Gabe figured he had a couple minutes and right now he smelled of stressed omega, carrying both his and Dean’s scent. He went and had a quick shower, changing into new scrubs when he got out. He had to put back on the same lab coat but he figured his scent was muted.
On a side note, I hope everyone is still enjoying this series. It has a special place in my heart as it was the first one I started writing. I hadn't written anything, besides a couple fairy tales for kids, in years and this is what got me back into it.
They found Sam and Bobby in the living room.
Cas gave a slight shake of his head then strode towards Adam. “I know one thing for sure. We need to hide him. Now.” He put his hand to Adam’s chest and it glowed as he burned sigils onto his ribs.
Dean shrugged and went inside.
Gabe explained that smelling Dean in distress had almost put Castiel in his own feral state so he had to keep away until Dean was at very least awake.
Then Castiel seemed to notice something. "Dean, you do not have any kind of drink," he said.
"No, I took the day off. I knew Sam would be a nervous wreck and I don't need to screw anything up because I can't concentrate." Dean told him as he finished his own coffee and went to join Cas near the sink.
Dean still didn't answer verbally but he turned his eyes to stare at Cole. Cas felt a wave of rage wash over him as he remembered what Cole had said about not being "a fag" and "dealing with it." Cas gave Dean’s knee a little pat to indicate Dean should move. Dean got up gracefully and moved so he was standing behind Cas's chair. The ease with which he moved showed that he'd definitely been exaggerating his injuries.
As soon as dinner was over Sam descended on him. “Dean, can we talk for a minute?” Sam asked, his tone making it more of a demand than a question.
They had saved the world. He figured that planning out everyone’s future, getting paperwork to declare Adam and his mom alive, and anything else that could come up, could wait until after dinner. They had the rest of their second (or more) lives to figure it out.
Sam looked thoughtful. “Do you trust him?”
Walt seemed startled by what Dean had said. He sniffed the air and gave a humorless laugh. “I didn’t know Dean Winchester was a bitch.”
So I know in this chapter and the last it was mentioned that Sam was there for the meeting then I never had him appear. That's because Sam is smart. As soon as he saw Dean he knew how things were going to play out so he decided to stay out of it. Because Sam's smart.
“Hey Sammy,” He greeted his brother happily.
“Well,  I read your medical case study, the one about the feral omega, a couple years ago and it got me interested in feral care. You and your team are the best in the country and I’d like to be part of that.” Kate replied. “Plus my son is thinking of going into medical school, also focusing on feral care. He graduates this year and I thought it was a good time for a change, one looking to our futures.”
I hope you are all having a great weekend!
Cas looked back at him and said "Because then he might stop the apocalypse."
The reception went well into the night. Sam and Jess’s plan was to stay up until it was time to leave for their flight (they were going to Hawaii) then sleep on the plane. Neither Cas or Dean really wanted to stay up until 3am so when they saw that people were starting to slowly leave they made their way over to the happy couple.
Dean agreed and Gabe couldn’t help smiling. The two really did seem like characters in a fairy tale.
Dean nodded. He liked Jess fine but he was glad Sam had told her no. Beyond the obvious reasons why he wasn't ready to see her, she had also never experienced Dean in one of his mute phases. Introducing her to them in the middle of one that she had caused seemed like a bad idea.
Castiel gave a nod of acknowledgement.
Finally he told her “Anna, we've been through much together. But you come near Sam Winchester and I'll kill you.”
“Awesome,” Dean said again.
“What’s up, Doc?” he asked a slight smile on his face. Sammy rolled his eyes but the doctor  laughed. It was a warm laugh. Dean could tell that he was going to get along with this doctor just fine.
Dean gave her a hard look. “You better not be sharing your opinions with everyone,” he told her sternly, with a significant look towards the table of hunters. “Poor guy doesn't need trouble just because he can hold his liquor.”
So yeah, I'm emotionally exhausted.
Dean was already to go by lunch time. Sam had moved all his stuff to his car while Dean showered and changed from his hospital gown to real clothes.
(See the end of the chapter for
Meg nodded and helped him set up so Dean could receive visitors in a few hours. Once they were done and out of the room again she turned to him and said “You never answered the question, you know.”
“Well,” Dean started slowly, “if we want them to seem human to hide them from hunters, we should probably give them normal human names. But,” he added, after seeing Sam about to argue, “it might also be good to give them each a dragon name. then, when they are older, they can choose which to use.”
Dean looked at Sam and Bobby. After a moment where no one seemed to know what to say Dean turned towards the kitchen. "I need a beer."
I had alot of fun coming up with the ceremony in this chapter. It was kinda my favorite thing.
This shocked Castiel. "Who?" He asked.
He handed the Colt to Sam who asked if he knew where Lucifer was. Crowley had a date and location for them then dropped a tidbit of information that shook Dean.
“Where was the last cluster?” Dean asked. Castiel always admired how quickly he switched to the job on hand.
Raphael made the case that it was Lucifer since he needed all the rebellious angels he could find. It put a seed of doubt in Castiel's mind but even so it didn't sound like Lucifer to him. Raphael seemed to have forgotten that Castiel knew Lucifer better than most.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I've been talking at him," Sam stated. "He never answers. We don't even know what language he speaks."
Dean and Sam stayed in a group together but were joined by three other people; the girl who had been staring at Sam earlier Becky, a cheerful redhead Charlie and some douchebag named Bartholomew. Dean might have been a little biased against Bart because the man kept making eyes at Dr Novak. Becky, meanwhile, gave him the creeps. She kept staring at Sam and trying to touch him. Dean just hoped she didn't end up being a stalker. Charlie seemed cool.
“So Doc, when can I get outta this bed?” Dean asked Gabe, interrupting his thoughts.
Anyways have a great day out there!
Everyone stared at her, Jess with horror on her face. “No,” she said quickly. “They got together because of how they felt about each other. All I did was almost wreak a decades old friendship and even my own relationship. No thanks is wanted or expected.”
Silence greeted that question, until Gabe broke it by laughing, Dean grinned at him and offered him the plate. Gabe grabbed two and passed one to his mate before stepping back. Dean just kept up the act of good host, offering dessert silently to everyone standing there.
Dean was working at a garage in the area. The plan was to save up money, gain skills and when Sam was all done law school they would all find a place to settle. None of them really wanted to be stuck in a big city long term. But those decisions would be made together. Once they decided, Dean wanted to start his own garage.
As soon as Dean woke up he prayed for Cas to meet him. He also woke up Sam. Once Cas was there he told them both, “So Anna just visited me in a dream.” He looked over to Cas, “Is there anyway to keep everyone out of my head. My dreams don’t need an audience.”
“Yours,” Dean immediately agreed. “All yours. Always.” Then he felt his balls tighten. “Gonna cum, oh god. Cas!”
Now she was looking forward to meeting the brothers when she did her personnel reviews. She wanted to check in with everyone, particularly the newcomers. This was to keep on top of any problems that might arise as well as determine if there was anyone who would benefit from going back to earth when the Daedalus returned. There was no room on the mission for anyone who caused problems or couldn't handle the work.
Sam looked interested. “I wonder what goes into a nest?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Lucifer nodded then added, "i like this nest. It is quiet and secluded."
They said their goodbyes and hung up. Cas sighed and rubbed his face tiredly. One of these days he was going to be able to talk to Dean without being tongue-tied.
Dean frowned. He had just woken up, had no idea where he was or why and now had been called an “idjit” twice in less than 5 minutes. Normally he could just brush it off but he was feeling vulnerable and he could feel his lower lip tremble in a pout. This also annoyed Dean; he didn’t like being the stereotypical emotional omega.
Dean listened as Sam and Bobby kept asking Cas questions. He started to tune them out but was brought back to the present when Bobby asked, "So what would a courtship involve?"
When Dean got to Bobby's he wasn't there. What was there was his wheelchair with a few bullet holes through it. He searched the place and found a photo of Bobby, Cas and some others at a camp.
Dean glanced at his clock. It was almost midnight. He knew from Bobby that the marks appeared when you were asleep. It didn't matter if you stayed up all night and day, if you were meant to have a soulmate, the marks would appear the first time you slept after your sixteen birthday. Partly to stop delaying the inevitable and partly because he didn't want to be a wreak the next day Dean closed his eyes. Eventually he fell asleep.
“It is strange to think how easy it was for me to admit that to myself once I started examining our relationship. It was if, like with Beatrice and Benedict, the knowledge of your feelings allowed me to see you in that light. When I did, I realized I have been in love with you for years. All those dates I ‘chickened out’ of,” he used air quotes again, “was because I would get the tickets, make the reservation and suddenly I would be thinking about how much more fun it would be to take you to the event than the women I had originally planned to. Next thing I would know I would be calling you to see if you were available. Even when you weren’t I could no longer bring myself to invite out the originally intended recipient. Subconsciously I seem to have been trying to court you for years.”
He was also hoping Cas would stick around. Dean wasn't sure if he was interested in men, or even humans, but he wanted to find out. Even if Cas wasn't interested in him, he could always use more friends.
He felt Cas's light touch tracing the feathers of the wings. "Incredible," he said quietly. "I've seen mine in pictures and mirrors but it is amazing to see the detail up close."
“You too, Dean.” she replied before throwing him through a window. Dean got knocked out and woke up after Sam had banished Anna. Sam later told him how awesome their mom had been. How she had held her own against Anna.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Trust me, pal, take it from someone who knows, that is a dead-end street.”
Dean would fight anyone who insinuated that he was in a relationship with Sam. He had way better taste than that. So he understood where Cas was coming from.
Sam opened his mouth to protest but Gabe cut him off. "No, really. When you first got here you knew almost nothing about omegas but you have put in an effort to learn to help your brother. That's something."
Dean shook his head and pushed his face deeper into Cas’s chest. He heard a chuckle, maybe from Lucifer, then Cas spoke again more firmly, “Dean you need to get up. Your heat is starting.”
Dean was surprised. He hadn’t really thought he was getting anything. Luckily he and Sam had enough money that it wasn't really an issue.
“Have you tried talking to him?” Charlie asked, her tone slightly sarcastic. Dean glared at her; she knew the answer. “Just talk to him!” she said exasperated. “Go up to him and say ‘Cas, I like you and want to have your babies.’ “ Her voice was pitched low in mockery of him.
"Big," Dean confirmed. "They seem to cover my back and even wrap around my shoulders. Have you ever heard of anyone having two soulmates?"
Everyone laughed at that. "I will see about getting you some food." Gabe told him. "Before that I need to introduce you to a couple people."
"I heard a rumour about you and I came to see if it was true." Castiel told him.
The same student rolled his eyes. "People just say that to feel special. A soulmate mark is a soulmate mark no matter the size or place."
Lucifer leaned down to take Dean's mouth in a hard deep kiss. Dean moaned into it and Lucifer smiled. Dean was already squirming, looking for relief so Lucifer wasted no time. He knelt between Dean's legs and once Dean gave him a slight nod thrust right in. Dean was still loose and soft from taking Castiel's knot.
He scoffed at that. Why would an omega, a human one, need to hide from angels?
Then Sam asked the question Dean had wanted to but couldn't, "Cas, were you really dead?"
Throughout the day people stop by. Some brought food, others brought blankets and baby supplies. The last was most useful; everything they had burned in the fire. By the time evening came their house was cluttered with food and stuff. Dean appreciated it all but it was a lot. It was nice to know that no one was lining up to chase him out of town.
So has anyone else been spending a lot of time in their gardens? By the time this social distancing/ self isolation is over my garden is going to be awesome!
Once they were out of sight, Dean looked over at Cas. he suddenly felt shy and wasn't sure how to proceed. He knew he had to take the lead, Cas was a virgin after all, but he didn't want to be too eager or rush Cas into anything he didn't want.
“Who did?” Dean asked, a sinking feeling in his gut.
Dean and Cas climbed back into the impala, with Cas in the front seat this time. Dean watched Sam give a final wave and headed into the airport. Dean watched him go. Cas gave his hand a squeeze and Dean felt that everything was going to be alright. He put the car in drive and headed forward to his future.
Dean made a sympathetic sound then said "in that case I'll talk to Jody and see when she can release the scene."
“How could we have set this up as an ambush?” Dean calmly asked. “We are having a BBQ in our own backyard. We had no idea you were coming or even where you were. It’s not like you’ve been stopping by regularly. Hell we haven’t even talked in seven years.”
Dean felt himself slick a little and gave a barely audible whimper. Both Lucifer and Cas were staring at him intensely and Sam was looking like he regretted being there.
Cas was jared from his thoughts when the doorbell rang. That’s strange, he thought, most of their friends knew to just walk around to the backyard.
He ignored Sam’s glare as he got up. He pulled on some pants, fixed the blankets covering Cas and checked on the eggs. Then he led Sam outside.
He had tethered him by the time Sam and Dean made it to him. With a few words in Enocian Castiel commanded the cupid to appear.
The rest of the day was spent playing with the kids, feeding them when they were hungry and changing them when they were dirty. Claire and Emma were little balls of energy. They couldn't crawl yet but they loved rolling over again and again. Jack, meanwhile, was happy to lay there gumming on his toy. It was fine and fun now but Dean was dreading what would happen when they were mobile and outnumbered him and Cas.
Dean laughed. Cas was a funny, and really hot, guy. “It's about the symbolism,” he explained. “I got chased out of town for loving men. Despite being my lover, he got to stay because he found himself a girlfriend. Plus he told them I bewitched him. Anyways the gift is meant to remind him, and maybe his wife, that he used to love my dick. Also telling someone to go fuck themselves is considered an extreme insult.”
Castiel went to find Gabriel.
With all the extra hands moving in took no time but no one left when the stuff was. Instead they split up to set the house up. Ellen and Jo took over Dean's new kitchen and soon were cooking up a storm. Jody, Donna, and Charlie took Dean and Cas's bedding to get the rooms ready. Jess and Sam arranged their sitting room. Bobby led a group of men outside to split and stack firewood. All Dean and Cas had to do was hold their babies and watch.
“They're not incontinent.” he told Dean.
"I made a reservation at Milton's," Cas informed him.
“I won’t be gone long,” Cas assured him.
"What are you doing out this late?" He asked.
Sam was just starting to stir when Dean walked back through the door. The smell of the coffee seemed to wake him even faster, especially when Dean waved it right under his nose. Sleepy hazel eyes met Deans bright green ones.
Dean frowned. He hated the idea of losing Cas way more than talking about his feelings, and he hated talking about his feelings. Plus from what Sam was saying it sounded like Cas was all for having a relationship. “Alright, I'll talk to him,” Dean said with a sigh.
“I have all the paperwork ready. You should be out tomorrow.” Gabe looked at him closely. “How are you doing?” he asked quietly.
With a touch Dean found himself back in a motel room with Sam. They were just packing up when Cas appeared. He looked even worse than before. Dean grabbed him before he could fall and said “I’ve got you, you son of a bitch. You made it.”
Sam seemed startled by the question and answered “fine I think.”
He heard Sam groan dramatically over Dean's fussing as he left the room but knew the sandwich would still be appreciated. Sam ate like a horse.
the thing that always stuck with me in supernatural when Micheal and Lucifer met was how sad they seemed at the idea of fighting each other. I hope I was able to convey that in this story.
“Cas, can you get that?” Dean asked “then get Mary ready to go outside?”
Dean explained “I figure none of this would have happened if Lucy had just answered either mine or Cas’s calls.”
He noticed a girl had been watching Sam and seemed disappointed by the exchange between Sam and Dean. Dean caught her eye and mouthed “brother”. Her eyes lit up and she looked at Sam with renewed interest.
Lucifer nodded and Castiel flew to where Dean was, honing in on his prayer.
Gabe hadn’t been listening since Sam spoke but he was suddenly aware of Castiel’s scent. It was full of righteous anger. Gabe lay a hand on his arm and Castiel responded by tugging him closer so they could scent each other. Gabe hadn’t realized how tense he was himself until he breathed into his brother’s scent gland.
Castiel was busy setting up a nest in preparation of Dean’s heat. They knew it would be soon. No more than a week away. Castiel and Lucifer had found an abandoned cabin in the woods on an island in Canada. They were working together to make it as safe and comfortable as they could.
Lucifer stepped forward and greeted his brother, "It's good to see you, Michael."
Before they left Dean pulled out his wallet and rummaged through it. He pulled out $100, about half of what he had won last time he had hustled pool. He handed it to Sam saying "happy birthday Sammy."
He heard the swoosh of wings behind him and turned to see Gabriel, a lollipop in his mouth. "Hey Cassie, whats up?"
Raphael made his arguments asking if God would let the world go the way it was if he was around.
“Humans normally exchange rings,” Dean said absent-mindedly as he thought about what Cas had said. He found that he didn't really mind the idea of being marked as Cas’s. That decided, he smiled at Cas and said, “maybe I could make a ring for you? Mark you as mine the human way.”
This story was quite the labor of love. It took me over a year and 76 pages of paper to write. I may revisit it in the future to add time stamps and such but for now, this story is closed.
Sam looked around. "It's over then?" He asked. Then he spotted the dead demons. "What the hell!" He shouted.
When it came time to make dinner Dean ran into town with Cas and got the makings for hamburgers as well as grabbed a large pie to share. Cas insisted Dean buy organic products even though they were more expensive. Normally Dean would have protested but they had just saved the world. He even got Sam all the rabbit food he liked.
"We have any chance of surviving this?" Dean asked with his characteristically false bravado. His scent gave hima away though. He was scared.
‘Maybe,’ Dean responded. ‘I just remember someone promising to distract me this afternoon.’
"Don't kill anyone." Castiel warned him. "It would upset the omega."
Dean managed to get all the floor holes fixed or at least covered by the end of the day. Before he had left he had told Cas that it was probably going to at least a couple more weeks to finish all the repairs.
Dean grinned back at him then brought the conversation back on track. “so penetrative sex. Do you know which role you want? to be the one putting it in or the one taking it?”
"Confused." Dean told him, "And really hungry."
He wasn’t going to stop Kate, though. It was her life and, given that John paid nothing to live there, she got to decide if she wanted to sell her house and buy a new one in a whole new state.
Castiel was not sure if Sam was aware of the irony of his statement but he let it pass.
Sam gave a small laugh too. "I've just been going over interview questions and answers with Jess all morning. At this point I don't know if it's helping or making things worse."
Finally they reached a room from which the diseases seemed to emanate. A demon in nurse form opened the door, a smirk on her face. It quickly fled as she realized that instead of humans weakened by illness, she was facing two angels. She smoked out immediately.
Once he was alone Dean made his way back to his couch. He loved his brother but for now he just wanted to wallow. Wallow, eat pizza, drink beer, and watch Batman beat up bad guys.
"Tingle?" Dean whispered with a laugh. It was a funny sounding word. Sam gave him a quick bitch face.
He had set up his bed and was just turning the eggs again before going to sleep when he heard a noise outside. Dean pulled his hand out of the fire and stood still, listening. The sound came again, closer this time. It sounded like someone was stumbling towards the smithy. He grabbed a knife from the pile of weapons to be sold and headed outside.
“You all might have treated me like a fool, but I am not useless.” he said angrily. “I can draw a damn whatever it is.”
Lucifer agreed.
Adam gasped and woke up. He sat up quickly and Dean could see panic in his eyes. ”Where am I?” he asked.
Bobby just laughed and said he could handle it.
When Sam came into their hotel room and tossed him a hex bag he learned to make from Ruby, Dean took the opportunity to check in on Sam. Sam said he was fine. Then he got the sad puppy dog look and tried to apologize again. Dean didn't want to hear it. He knew they both carried a lot of guilt. Sam may have released Lucifer by breaking the last seal but Dean had broken the first one. Plus there was no point keeping score when the apocalypse was starting.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel led him to the living room. On the coffee table stood a box for a 24” tv. Next to it was a box for a small dvd player. Gabe turned to look at his brother who was nervously shifting from foot to foot.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean gave a one shoulder shrug. “I’ve been better, but I’ve been worse.”
“Is this why people say that dragons sleep on piles of gold?” Dean wondered.
"Heya Cas. What's up?" He said as he answered the phone.
Lucifer raised his hand and casually snapped once. The demon disappeared in a mist of blood. The other demons stared in shock.
Adam seemed to think about it. “They never said. I guess I just thought they meant alive.”
She shrugged. “I mean you already have the kids anyways. Now you just want the rest of the happily ever after. But you need to tell him that.”
Lucifer watched him leave then set about bringing all the humans back, just like he had been asked.
"Of course not,'' Michael said angrily, "I love him. He's my brother."
Gabe climbed into the nest and settled into his brother’s arms. Castiel stuck his nose right next to Gabe’s scent gland and breathed deeply. Gabe could feel him relax as he did his best to make his scent as calming as possible.
Sam gave a small smile of thanks. Gabe gave his shoulder a squeeze before he turned and walked down the hall.
Dean thought that was strange but before he could think about it more he had to worry about answering a question in Japanese to prevent his balls getting smashed. He played the game, answered correctly and they transferred to another tv spot.
“I don’t know,” was Sam’s reply.
Love you all, stay safe out there!!
He was watching the one that looked like it was ready to go when, with a crack and a snap, the one next to it opened up to reveal a little baby girl. Dean stared in awe. He had seen newborns before and they were normally gross looking like they had lost a fight. This baby, on the other hand, was perfect with little blonde curls and blue eyes.
Elizabeth nodded and turned to Shepherd. “I think we should put him in the guest quarters and I want a guard stationed outside. I don’t want an unknown wandering around Atlantis.”
Castiel made a note to heal Chuck's liver damage before he left then asked, "how do we prevent Dean from becoming a vessel? If he dies they will just resurrect him."
His little brother Sam hadn't forgotten that it was Dean's sixteen. For the last month he had been pestering Dean as only a little brother could. He wanted to know how Dean felt about having a soulmate (answer: shrug), what kind of mark did he think he would get (shrug again), where did he think his mark would be, and what kind of soulmate did he think he would have (same answer for those questions too with an added "shut up Sammy"). Sam had been doing research into what the placement and size of a mark meant and constantly sharing what he learned with Dean. He was careful though. He never said a word about soul mates in front of their dad.
Gabe watched as Sam moved to get up and Jess motioned for him to stay. Dean also seemed to pick up on it and asked who she was. Then he asked if she was in charge of his sponge bath.
“Dragon’s lay eggs no matter what form they are impregnated in. Females lay their eggs in their true form and will often choose to stay in that form until after the eggs are hatched and the hatchlings are a year-old. This is because our true form is generally considered the safer form to be in. It is larger, faster, stronger, more impervious to harm, and we can fly.
“If what you thought was Castiel reacting to an omega in distress, then yes. He probably would have been fine staying outside the room but when Meg came out she was carrying Dean’s scent. It put Cassie in a protective state. It is similar to a feral state,” Gabe explained, mostly for Sam’s benefit.
"What is he looking for?" Ellen wondered out loud.
"Well played, boys. Where'd I screw up?" The trickster asked.
"Don't forget, she's a princess, Princess," Bobby added.
Stay safe out there and have a good weekend!
Cas's eyes darkened and he licked his lips as he nodded. Dean smiled. “I was imagining that the toy was you thrusting in me.” He paused, letting his words sink in before hitting Cas with the final blow, “I think we should make that daydream a reality.”
Gabriel smiled up at him. "It's good to see you too." He looked around the empty campground. "So Castiel told me that he's bringing an omega here for you to meet. Does this mean you are giving up on the apocalypse?" He said it casually but Lucifer knew he was serious and worried.
Bobby stayed up with Castiel a little while. He wasn't going with them so he figured he needed less sleep.
In the end it was Sam and Lucifer who figured it out. Sam had seen a news article about a pharmaceutical company getting ready to ship out flu vaccines in preparation of a larger than normal flu season. Lucifer heard the name of the company and remembered some of the demons he had interrogated mentioning it when he had been looking for Pesty. Sam put two and two together and realized the Croatian virus was in the vaccines.
Sam made a face, he didn't exactly approach Dean hustling at pool but he nodded.  Dean promised himself that he'd get Sam the money as soon as possible. The kid deserved it.
Sam agreed.
Dean slid off his lap and followed Cas outside to his car. He knew that soon a cleanup crew would arrive to dispose of the body in a way that couldn’t be traced back to them. As they drove off Dean started thinking that he might have enough energy for another round when they got home and cleaned up. Something to show Cas how much he appreciated him. Dean smiled. He loved his life.
Dean felt arms around him again. The scent of his pup was all around him and everything seemed perfect.
Lucifer was ignoring Castiel, or at least trying to. He had been spending time in all his favorite spots on earth, although some of them were gone since he had last been on earth. He had also spent a lot of time trying to think up courtship gifts for Dean.
Dean explained that he was going to make some knives. Cas seemed interested so Dean found himself explaining the whole process and how he planned to eventually plate at least two of the knives in gold.
Dean nodded and went back to his pacing. Bobby made his way to a chair and pulled out a book.
“Not sure why you’re so nervous Sammy,” Dean teased. “It’s not like she’s going to run. We all know she’s in this for the long haul.”
Damn angels, Dean thought. Sam was staring at him expectantly so Dean relented. “I told Cas that I was worried that Lucifer was planning on ignoring me till my heat.” Dean could feel himself blush as he spoke. “Cas promised to have a talk with him.”
To distract and calm himself Cas pulled out his phone and turned it back on. Quickly he was flooded with texts sent through the day by Dean, Gabe, and even Sam. He quickly scrolled through, making sure he hadn’t missed anything important. It was mostly reminders of the bbq they were planning for the next weekend and Gabe being nervous for his date. Cas stopped at a text with a picture of his sleeping pup with the caption “Goodnight Daddy.”
Cas fixed his amazingly bright blue eyes on Dean and said, “tell me more about why you are drinking.”
Silence met that confession. Dean peaked with one eye to see his alphas looking at each other with slight puzzlement. Then a compresending look came over Cas. He pulled Dean close and said “Alright, I’ll give it to you now,” before taking Dean’s lips in a deep kiss.
Cas went back over to the forge and looked in. He tilted his head the way he did when he was confused but in this case it appeared like he was listening. Finally he said, “I do not think it would be wise to try to move the eggs at this time. They are very close to hatching. It will also take me time to find an appropriate nest location. For now I think it is best if they remain in Dean's care.”
He had just gotten the upper hand when another angel came from behind. Before he reached Castiel, though, Lucifer appeared in front of him, and with one touch of his finger to the angel’s forehead, he put him to sleep like he would a human. Then he went over and did the same to the one Castiel had been fighting.
“Something strong,” he told her with the wink. Okay he might just see her as a sister, but Dean was still a flirt. Plus he had a reputation to maintain. He didn't want to be chased out of another town.
Sam and Dean were surprised by this, even though Castiel wasn’t. The cupid explained that John and Mary were set up by heaven to be the perfect couple. That they needed to be together so Dean and Sam would be born. When the cupid started to sing that they were a match made in heaven Dean punched him. All it really did was hurt Dean’s hand but it caused the cupid to fly off. Castiel put a hand on Dean’s shoulder and let his grace heal him.
"And Castiel and Lucifer are both alphas," Sam realized out loud. He looked over at the alphas then looked back at Gabe, a confused look on his face. "Wouldn't Lucifer just win? He's an archangel."
Sam looked down as he answered “almost four years.” He went on to explain that he had changed his number and forgot to give it to his brother.
Dean felt his heart drop. keeping his emotions out of his voice and trying to just sound interested, he asked “why’s that?”
“Yeah one time they took away Sam’s lungs and gave me stage four cancer,” Dean stated. He sauntered over to Castiel and put an arm around his waist saying “Luckily Cas here chased them off.”
Sam nodded and put the radio in his pocket. "Follow me," he said to John and started walking quickly down the corridor. John shrugged and followed.
Dean agreed and Sammy texted Castiel about the keys. Dean really wanted to get Sam to text Castiel and ask if he liked Dean but that was a little too needy omega. He would just have to wait. Man he hated waiting.
Tags updated to include Crowley, Jo, and Ellen.
Dean gave a small laugh. Sam always insisted on calling Dean's fire immunity magic, even if it was all Dean could do. “I don't think so Sammy,” Dean said. “I don't think the guy’s even human.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean shrugged. “He heals when burning metal hits his skin. He knew they were dragon’s eggs at a glimpse. I'm inclined to believe him.”
If he hadn't known who the man was meeting or how it was likely going to turn out, Crowley would have tossed the man out on his ear. He had no time for people who put their hands on his dancers. And Dean had a special place in his heart. Besides being one of his stars, he had been the one to take Crossroads from just another strip club to The strip club.
So for a moment of whining... last night I stepped on a nail. It was a short one, only thumbtack length, but man it hurt. I cleaned it all out and bandaged it up (I'm up to date on my shots). Most of my work, though, has me on my feet and I'm not really looking forward to it. Plus it hurt!
Lucifer lifted his head and looked into Castiel's eyes. "You should be able to rely on me. That's why we mate in trios. And I haven't been very reliable."
Cas was pleasantly surprised by how nice Kate and Adam were. At some point basically everyone had introduced themselves and both Kate and Adam had seemed happy to meet everyone. It was almost too bad they were associated with John Winchester.
“That was so good,” Dean said with a happy sigh. “Why haven’t I been getting you to pay me with pie instead of money?”
They had gotten drinks and Cole was having a good feeling about the whole thing. He had started to tell them all about the incident with the lap dance when that very dancer had just walked into the meeting like he belonged there. He had even sat on Castiel’s lap. It had been disgusting. When Castiel had asked if he’d hit Dean, Cole had lied. He wasn’t sure what was going on but he was pretty sure he didn’t want to be known as the guy who hit one of the dancers.
After Castiel was gone Gabe decided he would also go and give them some space. “I’ll be by to check on Dean in about half an hour,” he told them. “Call me if you have any problems.” This was directed at Bobby with a significant look at the handkerchief.
Dean caught him staring and leaned over to give him a kiss. They held hands as they listened to their friends and family recount their friendship and awkward courtship.
"I spoke to a prophet of the Lord," Castiel told him. "He said there was another way."
Lucifer scowled. It was hard picking nest locations and Castiel's requirements were going to make it harder.
By that point the syllabus had made it to the last student. Dr Novak seemed to notice and he said “please open your syllabus so we may go over the expectations of this class.”
Dean and Sam hadn't been so lucky. They ended up fleeing in the night after someone set fire to their house. Sam's teacher Gabriel had left with them. He hadn't needed to but he said that he would never be able to look at the town the same again. As they stood on a hill looking down at the town they had left, Dean had heard him put a curse on it. He'd been grateful for the support.
Cas, Sam, and Gabe were still staring at him. Then he realized that all his future planning throughout the day he’d forgotten to talk to one major player. He turned to Cas and said, “unless you don't want that. Hell, I wouldn't blame you if you want to take the kids away from here after what happened last night.” He felt a pang in his heart at the thought of Cas taking the babies away. He looked down at his mug to avoid the pitying look he knew was on Sam's face.
Dean spent this morning doing some chores and bill paying. Cas, Sam and him shared rent on a three bedroom, two bath apartment. Sam had been spending the last few nights at Jess's place but normally it was just the three of them. They had turned one of the bedrooms, the one in the middle into an office. It made lots of sense given that Sam was a student and Cas a professor. The real reason was to give Sam a one room buffer from having to hear Cas and Dean get it on.
As soon as they set down Lucifer turned to Castiel. “So how much trouble am I in this time?”
“It is a natural hot spring,” Cas explained. “The water rises from the earth already warmed. I also think there may be a normal freshwater spring running through one of the other paths.”
Speaking of family, neither Dean or Sam had heard from their dad since they had left for college 4 years ago. Bobby still had some contact with him and could at least tell them he was alive but that was about it. It didn’t matter, he had never been much of a father. Bobby was more of a dad to them than John ever was.
"Cas? Are you awake?" Dean asked quietly.
He was also starting to dread the end of the repairs. Once Dean was done Cas would miss their lunches together. Sure he would see Dean when he inevitably needed repairs done to his house or other handyman work, but it wouldn't be the same.
Now Adam was a smart kid, maybe even as smart as Sam. John never said that though, mostly because he had never told Kate or Adam about Sam and Dean. He had wanted to keep one piece of his life free of the shit the rest of his life was. When he was with Kate and Adam he got to sleep on clean sheets in an actual house. With Sam and Dean it was dirty motels the whole way.
Castiel had to look over and admire this brave and foolish omega. Here he was facing an alpha, one of the most powerful in creation and he was making jokes. Not only that but jokes only him and Castiel would understand. Castiel decided that he might actually love Dean, not just admire or desire him.
The next morning they headed to the hospital room of Raphael's vessel. As Castiel poured to oil in a circle around the man he explained to Dean how it worked. Then he whispered in Enochian to Raphael then he said it again in English for Deans sake, "I'm here, Raphael. Come and get me, you little bastard."
Meeting in the middle Dean lay the blanket on the ground to symbolize their nest. Cas took his hand and led him to sit down on the blanket. Once they were settled Cas offered Dean a fork and they both dug into the pie. With Dean helping out they made it through the pie quickly. Once they were done Cas set aside the pie plate and forks. They sat there on the blanket holding hands and staging into each other's eyes.
Cas scowled at his phone and said, "I might be but my house isn't."
One of the walls was on fire with huge holes from the fireballs he had avoided. His couch was a pile of wood, cushions and flames. All his art seemed to have been hit. And the one window in the room was broken.
Castiel looked around. No one else seemed to pick up on the exchange. That was probably for the best.
From the look on Gordon's face Dean could see that he had forgotten that bit of information. Sam saw it too. “So you did forget,” he announced so the crowd could hear. “So what? Dean made you mad and instead of talking it out like adults or even having a fight, you decided murder was your best option? And you dragged your buddies into it. Did they know you were planning to murder him?”
Dean saw Lucifer nod in understanding and rolled his eyes. Angels. At least Luce was starting to get better. Cas never seemed to have that problem.
Dean fell asleep feeling warm, comfortable, and strangely taken care of.
“You don’t get to talk to him like that!” Dean had lost his cool. "Hell don't even look at him."
Dean looked at his mate. He was dirty and disheveled and perfect. It was hard to believe just months before Dean had been tired and fighting feral. Now he was more alive than ever, had found his mate and had overcome feral. His life was awesome.
Sam made a face at him but stopped his pacing.
“Why are you doing this?” Castiel asked him.
"I don't know." Castiel replied. "I just looked her in the eyes and told her it wasn't her fault that her father ran off. It was because he hated his job at the post office."
Dean paused, it was a sore spot, then just said "Me and Sam are taking separate vacations for a while." Then he changed the subject, asking if Cas had found God yet. Cas said no then asked for Deans help finding an archangel.
Dean took another sip. “That had been the plan. But now I've got someone interesting to talk to.” The man looked confused so Dean clarified. “You. I'm talking to you.” Then he held out his hand. “Dean Winchester, local blacksmith.”
The man stared at his hand like he didn't understand the gesture. Given the way he asked questions about humans, he might not get it. But he eventually held out his own hands saying his name, “Castiel.”
He stared at Cas, sleeping so peacefully. Dean normally loved the idea of a handsome, naked man in his bed. This time all Dean could think about was how close Cas had been to dying. He barely knew the man but the idea of him gone upset Dean.
Anna seemed nervous staring at his blade. Then said “Sam Winchester has to die.”
Dean wanted out of the town. He was feeling weird. His emotions were on edge and whenever Cas stepped more than two feet away he wanted to pout. He felt a strange need to be in contact with him.
"Over my heart," Dean confessed, then grew silent. He wasn't sure why he didn't feel like telling Sam about the other mark. He thought he would wait until he had talked to Bobby. Until he had more of an idea what was going on.
"How do you know the way so we'll?" He asked as they made another turn.
“Oh he knows you exist,” Charlie said with a grin.
"No. He exploded, like a water balloon of Chunky soup."
“Why are we meeting here, Castiel?” he asked.
Dean reminded himself that Sam was under a lot of stress and didn't snap back. "Hey Sammy. I was sitting at home having a quiet morning when suddenly my heart started racing. After checking myself for signs of a heart attack I realized it's not me, it's you. How's your morning going?" Dean deliberately kept his voice light and teasing. He wasn't upset with Sam, he was just worried.
Castiel sat stiffly and knew his eyes were wide. Dean leant over to tell him to relax.
Dean rolled his eyes and looked back to see how his mates were reacting. Cas had a smile on his face, he was probably happy to see the congratulations, and Lucifer was laughing his ass off. He turned back to the room. Sam handed him a beer and Dean lifted it in acknowledgement.
“Not where. When. It's 1978.” Castiel informed them.
Cas had shaken his head but also reminded his omega that they had barely talked. Dean had been a bit subdued for about a day before throwing himself into planning the “best god damn BBQ ever!”
“And if they wake up? Do you have bottles ready? How do you plan to get them out of the forge?” Dean was trying and possibly failing to sound calm.
Dean watched as Sam packed up his bag. It had been almost a month since Dean had been released from the hospital and it was time for Sam to head back to Stanford. He wasn’t going to be away long, just a week to finish his exams. Then he would be back for the summer. He would be bringing Jess with him.
“Well, your people call them cupid.” Cas told them.
Thinking about Cas always put his mind on a dangerous path. Dean had always avoided male omega stereotypes. He slept with beta women exclusively, he drank, swore and was more likely to lead then follow. In fact most people who met him, and could not tell his subgender by scent, assumed he was either an alpha or a strong beta. Dean was pretty sure even Sam forgot he was an omega at times. But Cas brought out the omega in Dean. There was something about him that made Dean's instincts call out "mate". He ignored it though. Dean was good at ignoring problems; plus Cas had never shown interest in him.
Lucifer's POV
Castiel shrugged. “You might, in heaven, or you might not. It will be fully dependent on what Micheal decides. He might like having a vessel and not let you go.”
He dipped his hands in the oil again and Lucifer guided him to the other wing. As Dean worked he heard a low sound then he realized Cas was purring. Dean started purring in response and a moment later Lucifer joined them. Dean had never heard his alphas purr before and the sounds was somehow both soothing and arousing.
“Samuel Winchester?” a deep voice asked, startling Sam from his thoughts. He looked up to see a tall man standing by his table holding a cup of coffee.
But there was Sam, holding his laptop and looking like a student who had been sent to the principal's office. She sighed and radioed Shepherd to join her in her office. She gestured to Sam to follow her in and cleared a space for him to set up his computer.
Kate and Adam were full of questions for Dean, Gabe, and even Sam. Cas mostly stayed quiet unless they asked him a question directly. Dean had moved so that he was tucked into Cas’s side. Cas could feel the tension in him and absentmindedly ran a hand soothingly over his back.
Kate's phone chimed and she looked down to read a text. "My partner's on his way back. Should I just tell him to come around back?" She asked.
Castiel flew behind her,  “Hello, Anna.” He greeted her.
"Another pickup line?" Shepherd asked with a grin.
Dean quickly got bored watching Sam, Adam, and the two archangels discuss Adam’s demands from Micheal and how to word them so he wandered outside, Cas following close behind. He decided that since they were going to be there a while and he wasn’t sure when he would get the chance next, he was going to give baby a tune up. He rolled up his sleeves and went to work.
Finally Dean couldn’t hold it in any longer, “Cas, why hasn’t Lucifer come to visit? It’s been over a month. I know I was out of touch when I was hunting but at least you have called and visited.” Dean was rambling a bit but he didn’t like talking about his feelings and insecurities. “I thought he was supposed to be courting me? Is he planning on ignoring me until I go into heat? Then he thinks he will just get a piece of this ass?” Dean was starting to get angry. “If that’s what he thinks he has another thing coming.”
Dean's POV
“How about being what humans think angels are, protectors and healers, not dicks,” Dean suggested, his voice dark.
He also spared a brief thought to the fact Sam kept referring to Gilda as Charlie's friend. They had been dating for almost two years. He thought that he would bug Sam about it later, when he was feeling better.
When the food was gone and they were both sipping their coffees Sam broke the silence. "I saw Cas last night. How's that going?"
"He'll get over it," Dean said dismissively. "Cas is here to lay out what happens next, courtship-wise."
Gabriel laughed as Lucifer stared at him in astonishment. Then he seemed to realize he had just lost the contest. Lucifer raised his wings high but when Castiel raised his as well, Lucifer's wings dipped slightly in submission. Lucifer scowled harder as Gabriel kept laughing.
Dean nodded. Then remembering Bobby couldn't see him he said "yeah."
Finally Dean couldn't take it any more. "How you been?" He asked, trying for casual.
“Cassie!” he called as he got close.
Nurse Masters was already there as he strode in. “What do you know?” he asked.
Castiel looked at him puzzled. "Yes."
“Is that why humans drink? the man asked, his head still tilted.
Sam stared at him, slack-jawed. Dean felt better about his own reaction now. Even someone as smart as Sam was speechless.
“Did you hear the gossip?” she asked Dean excitedly.
Sam was smiling at him. Dean could tell he liked the idea. “You could even go back to school,“ he suggested.
Gabe wagged his eyebrows at him and Dean just laughed. “See you in the morning,” He said to Sam before standing, turning to Cas and saying quietly, “Take me somewhere private.”
"It's a surprise," Cas replied.
"Why, you got somewhere to be?" Dean asked, teasing him.
"Rise and shine, Sammy" Dean coaxed. Sam opened an eye to glare at him and Dean waved the coffee under his nose. Sam groaned but stuck a hand out to take the coffee.
“He’s gone feral!” John shouted. “We need to subdue him before he attacks us.”
Dean was asking Cas for an explanation. Lucifer listened as Cas explained how the man, Adam was it, was of John Winchester's bloodline and Sam's brother. Dean didn't seem to like that but it was Sam who turned to Adam and said, "Now, Adam the angels are lying to you. They're full of crap."
“Well, here I go.” And Dean stepped through the hole into the open air.
Famine stared at him a moment then started to laugh his wheezy laugh. "You think you can stop me." He laughed again. This time one of the demons laughed too.
Dean smiled. The question was casual but, just like the day before, Dean knew he was checking in on him. He just wanted to make sure Dean was alright and not being taken advantage of. Basically Bobby was being a good dad.
Sam walked over to the mini fridge and pulled out a beer, holding it up in silent offer to Castiel. Castiel shook his head then slowly detangled himself from Dean. He lay a hand on Dean’s forehead to make sure he stayed asleep. Then he walked over to join Sam at the small table across the room.
Castiel told him he was there for an amulet that burns hot in God's presence. Bobby didn't know of anything like that, which Castiel knew. He looked significantly at the amulet Dean was wearing. Dean didn't want to give it up but he did. He told Castiel not to lose it.
Cas's POV
Dean was feeling uneasy again. It made sense, they were trying to kill the devil, but something told him that wasn't it.
"Why not?" Cas asked as he stood there letting Dean put the spare badge in his pocket.
The end
Dean threw another bundle of herbs and grasses into his forge. As the air grew sweet and fragrant, Dean was again thankful the dragon's weed was only addictive if consumed through food or drink. Otherwise he would be a raving, drug-seeking lunatic by now.
“I’m sorry,” Sam said as soon as he reached Elizabeth. “I can tell that he is listening but he doesn’t seem to want to talk.”
With the eggs so close to hatching and Cas living in his smithy, Dean closed his business for visitors. He was still working in his forge, partly to keep the eggs warm, partly to keep himself from going stir crazy. Honestly with the money he had made over the years and what Sam made himself, they could both live the rest of their lives on what they had. But they both enjoyed their work.
Dean had this feeling in his gut like something big was about to happen. It was weird because realistically lots of big things were constantly going down, it being the end of the world and all.
Cas nodded so Dean left him in the smithy and made his way to the house.
(See the end of the chapter for
John stepped forward again, “You don’t get to talk to me like that! I’m your father. I raised you and you don’t get to disrespect me like that.”
Cas shifted again and the blankets moved lower. Dean gulped. No, he thought, we are not going to be that guy. Ignoring the picture before him and his growing hard on Dean called, “Cas? time to wake up.”
Dean tried to think of what would  get her to believe. “Our names are Dean and Sam Winchester. We're named after your parents. When I would get sick you would make me tomato rice soup because that's what your mom made you. And instead of a lullaby you would sing ‘Hey Jude.’ That's your favorite Beatles song.”
Dean put back on his shirt, feeling self conscious. He looked at Sam and saw that he didn't look mad. His expression was something closer to awe. Dean smiled tentatively at him. "Yeah."
"So what are you watching?" Sammy asked, gesturing to the tv.
Epilogue
Finally Sam said, “I am so sorry. Jess is too. She didn’t even remember what happened but Charlie’s friend Gilda was there and recorded the whole thing. She sent it to Jess this morning. She was horrified when she watched it.”
“What if we just gave him what he wanted?” he said with a tone of someone having an epiphany.
John had so many more questions but before he could ask they reached their destination. The door automatically opened as they approached and John was suddenly staring at what looked like a cross between a science lab and a mechanic’s workshop. On one table weapons, like a Wraith stun rifle and a Goa’uld staff weapon, were laid out. Some of them were whole but others had been taken apart, their components laid out neatly next to them. On another table was something that looked suspiciously like a still. And in the middle of the room was Dean Winchester and the man John had been searching for.
Gabe sighed. “I know.” He paused trying to think of the best response. “I think that Sam is clueless.” Meg scoffed but Gabe continued, “No, honest, I don’t think he has any idea what’s going on. Cassie, me and his girlfriend had to explain what feral meant.”
Dean's POV
“Smells good.” Dean insisted. Sammy’s beta nose probably couldn’t pick up the scent.
He made his way through the tavern to where the man was sitting. The man didn't look up when Dean slid into the seat across from him. Instead all his attention was on the drink in front of him. Up close Dean could see that he was very handsome with dark hair and blue eyes. Just his type.
“They’re awesome,” he breathed. The alphas both relaxed, then smiled.  Dean realized that they had been worried. He didn’t understand why. He meant what he said when he called them awesome.
“That's great,” Dean enthused.
“You all ready for Dean to be released tomorrow?” Gabe asked.
His chores and bills didn't take that long and soon Dean was bored. He almost regretted not going into work, but he had needed a break. Plus it could be dangerous working on cars when he was that distracted. So instead Dean pulled out his Star Wars movies and settled into the couch.
I hope you are all doing well. Stay safe out there!!
