Cas mumbled something into his pillow along the lines of, “That’s great, Jack.”
Dean winks at them. “You know me so well.”
“How did you come up with the name for this place?” he asks, watching Castiel.
“The what?” Sam said.
“Operation Fangirl,” Charlie said, as though it was obvious.
Cas took another drink, smiling. “You love me for it.”
“Right,” Dean said. After shooting one last glare at Cas, he asked, “So what have we got?”
“Yes. They’re fascinating, and incredibly important to the environment,” Castiel says. “They’ve been here for about thirty million years. There are roughly twenty thousand different species.”
“They’re also incredibly intelligent— some honey bees have proven themselves somewhat proficient in numeracy, and research has shown that they can recognize human faces after prolonged and repeated interactions.” Castiel holds out the coffees.
Holy shit, hellers. It’s been six months. This still feels like a fever dream. How the fuck is it cannon.
Dean opened his mouth to retort, but she was already refocusing her attention towards Cas, an incantation rolling off her tongue.
because Castiel has no reason to be jealous. It’s not like they had a chance with Dean anyway.
It wasn’t a long drive to Donnie’s; less than fifteen minutes later, the four of them were sitting at the bar, drinks in hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Won’t the look on Sam’s face be satisfying enough?” Cas asked.
They don’t have time to give it more than a few moments’ thought before Dean appears, red-faced and flustered.
“Why don’t you take a break, then?” Sam suggested. “Charlie and I were going to head out to pick some stuff up. You could come with, get some fresh air.”
“Make sure it’s a room with a camera. Maybe in Dean’s bedroom,” Crowley said, thoroughly amused, before disappearing.
“But if it’s Chinese cuisine, then why is it an American food? That doesn’t— oomph!”
“Why not?” Charlie asked innocently.
So this is really fucking weird. I can’t believe that I’m posting the last chapter of this. For me, this fic was about distancing myself from 15x20 and creating an ending where good things do happen. Because maybe, if these characters that are broken and battered and bruised, if they can find happiness, then maybe I can, too. Maybe we all can.
Because Dean is definitely not okay.
Jack was right on Dean’s heels as he led them back to his and Cas’ room.
There was a slam.
“It’s my birthday!” Jack declared.
“‘Morning, Daddy!” He pointed towards the coffee machine. “I helped Dad make you your coffee. He let me sit on the counter!”
“Do mine ears deceive me?” he said dramatically. “Is Cassie finally going to educate themself on pop culture?”
Dean doesn’t fight them. Instead, he nods, and when Castiel comes back with his coffee, he offers a barely passable smile.
They don’t admit that, instead they say, “Not like that.”
Cas looked between the two of them curiously. “Is Elvis not a good artist for a ‘montage?’”
“I’m gayer than you. Maybe it can tell,” Dean said, determinedly not meeting anyone’s eyes, “I could go. Just in case.”
“Oh, yeah,” Charlie said. “This is totally going to work.”
It’s an unavoidable fact. They’re falling for Dean Winchester.
Dean bore a striking resemblance to a deer in headlights. “Sure thing, buddy,” he said nervously. “Let’s, uh. Yeah. Okay.”
“Um. Yes,” Cas said. “Yes, I would be— amenable to that course of action tonight.”
They were close enough that Charlie didn’t really need to make conversation during the drive by launching into a description of her dream girlfriend for the night then abruptly asking, “What about you, Cas? We all know Dean likes dark hair, layers, and a sexy voice. What’s your type?” but she did anyway, looking far too amused.
Charlie sighed. “Fine. No Elvis.”
“Guys,” Sam tried again.
“Well, let’s not keep ‘em waiting,” Charlie said brightly. “Get in, losers.”
Dean laughs. Castiel is surprised by how pleased they are that they got him to laugh.
“Three,” a woman said from inside. The door unlocked and opened easily.
he’s hot,” Dean shoots back.
The door creaked quietly as it opened. There was some rustling as Dean shifted through its contents, then—
“Alright,” he forced out. “‘M gonna…. Bye, Sam.” He hung up, then looked across the kitchen to Cas.
Chewie is.”
Charlie is right; there is a line. Kevin is waiting patiently behind Dean. They don’t want to ask Dean to leave though, because talking with him is enjoyable.
“Ooh, Dean!” Gabriel said, looking positively gleeful. “Who’s this Dean? Is he the reason you’re watching Star Wars?”
“I refuse to give up on my OTP,” she announced, despite lacking conviction. “I won’t be doomed to a life of fanfiction forever.”
Sam clamped his hands over his ears. He still heard Cas’ confused answer of, “Yes, I suppose that I can… ‘dig Elvis.’”
Castiel nods.
Castiel wanders over to them and picks up a record sleeve at random. Before they even get to read the title, Dean is pulling it away and sticking it back on the shelf.
yes cw I’m still holding a grudge. fuck you. let dean and cas fuck, please and thank you <3 for sam and charlie’s sakes
“Alright,” Dean said. “Let’s let Daddy sleep now. You ready for those pancakes?”
No major TWs for this chapter.
Castiel has to agree, the muffins are delicious. All the baked goods are.
Cas rolled his eyes. “You do realize that if they knew, they wouldn’t be trying to set us up.”
Dean choked.
“What?” Charlie demands while Dean crows triumphantly. “I love Han as much as the next person, but really?
Charlie shrugged. “Sure. Why not?”
It’s a slower day for business. The morning passes without any real hassle. The customers’ arrivals are spaced out enough that Castiel gets to talk with Meg a fair bit between them. She’s making fun of them mercilessly for the bee they attempted to make with latte art last night after closing (there’s a reason Meg does those orders— Castiel is not an artist) when the bell above the door chimes and Dean walks in.
“I know,” Cas said, and he held him.
Castiel hesitates, then reaches slowly across the small table to lightly touch the inside of Dean’s wrist.
What had his life come to?
Charlie geeked out with Cas for about half an hour before she said out of the blue, “You know what would be great right now? Coffee. There was a coffee shop on Main Street I wanted to try while I’m here. Would you mind doing pickup, Cas?”
thank you so much to those of you who leave comments and kudos. you guys brighten my day :)
They try not to think about that too much. They accepted a long time ago that Michael, Luke, Hael, and their mother will never accept them. The sting of it has dulled over time, but it’s still there. Castiel knows what Dean is going through. They wish they could do more.
The woman blinked, footing lost. “Oh.” She only looked lost for another moment before she regained her equilibrium.
They were all quiet for a moment before Cas put his own drink down.
(See the end of the chapter for
“How?” Dean asked brokenly. “How am I supposed to do this?”
“Sammy. He’s a pain in the ass sometimes, but he’s great.” His tone softens from joking into something proud. “Just a couple of years younger than me, off in college. He’s studying to be a lawyer.”
With one last squint in Dean’s direction, Cas complied.
Nothing.
Castiel shakes their head fondly and takes the bills Dean offers them.
Thank you so much to everyone who’s commented, left kudos, or interacted with this story! I’m always thrilled to hear if you’re enjoying it :)
“Thanks.” Dean doesn’t move to leave right away. Instead, he considers something for a few moments before asking, “Hey, does she ever make pie?”
With Dean, that could mean any number of things. Before Cas was able to wonder and figure out
Dean doesn’t.
Dean was white knuckling his beer when he elbowed Cas and hissed in his ear, “She’s flirting with you, dude.”
Still no response.
That set off another fit of giggles.
in large rounded letters.
“Gabriel?” Dean prompts.
Dean grins at them. “Bye, Cas!”
It’s been two months, Castiel reminds themself as they smile back. But they can still see themself being able to fall in love with green eyes, freckles, and a smile that lights up the room.
They duck into the small shop and instantly Castiel is struck by how incredibly
Castiel’s arm moves of its own accord and starts rubbing circles against Dean’s back.
The invisible pressure lifted, and they fell back to the ground.
“They’re pretty badass,” Charlie says, “and cute. In a fuzzy teddy bear way. But that doesn’t answer the question!”
Dean was lounging on the bed, eyes following Cas as he traded his jeans for soft frog patterned pajama pants and his shirt for a band tee that was haphazardly draped over a chair in the corner.
thank you so much to everyone who leaves comments and kudos!!
seven, eight, nine.”
Before Dean could respond, Cas walked in, carrying a duffel bag. “Oh. Charlie, how was yours and Sam’s case?”
“Huh?” Dean said dumbly.
“He has my blessing,” Gabriel declared. “Can I officiate at the wedding?”
It takes time before Dean is back to normal. Or at least, as back to normal as he can be. He comes to the coffee shop more often, now. Four to five times a week. They don’t get to talk for as long as Castiel would like everyday, but Castiel can tell that Dean is… accepting it, it seems. Dealing.
“Daddy! Dad, guess what?”
When they get to the shelves, Dean doesn’t let go. Not right away.
Castiel doesn’t think about it; they greet Dean with their usual, warm, “Hello, Dean.” The slightest bit of tension seems to drain from his shoulders, but by no means does he seem completely comfortable here like he usually does.
“Because they have taste,” Dean says. “Obviously.”
“Well, sweetheart, then we’d better get going, huh?” There was a teasing note to Dean’s tone. “How do you feel about takeout?”
Charlie is watching their entire exchange with an odd expression on her face. She seems incredibly entertained, and there’s a glint to her eyes that Castiel can’t quite interpret. It’s almost like she knows something they don’t.
Every time Dean comes in, they learn something else.
Dean ruffled his hair. “Go ahead, kid. Make a wish.”
quiet.
“Of course,” Castiel tells him. They’re not sure what exactly Dean is thanking them for, the pie or the bee fact. Or something else.
“Aw, Cas, did you miss me?” Dean jokes, as though he knows what they’re thinking.
Ten minutes later, Cas had left with a list and address, leaving Sam and Charlie alone.
“Lemon. And I meant ‘how’s it going.’” Dean leans forward against the counter. Castiel would tell off any other customer for that. With Dean, they let it go.
the next
Dean’s smile softens into something more fond when he trades Castiel bills for the pie.
“Subtly,” Charlie decided.
“Well, then I’ll be your Chewbacca,” Dean said. “I’m a pretty good wingman.”
The four year old considered it, then decided, “No.”
“Asshole,” Dean said.
There’s music playing in the background— they think it’s Led Zeppelin, which fits, considering they’ve been subject to at least two separate rants about which album is the best. Vinyl records line the wall behind the counter, their centers painted with scenes and images; there’s one of a sleek black muscle car, another that shows a night sky lit up with fireworks. Castiel does a double take when they come across one with a disposable coffee cup that looks like the ones Dean always leaves Busy Bee Coffee with.
“Dean,” Castiel repeats.
Thank you so much to everyone who’s left comments, kudos, or interacted with this story!! It makes me so happy to hear you’re enjoying it :)
It’s something about Dean’s smile when they greet him with a bee fact, something about how his enthusiasm is contagious and the way he says their name. Dean is just— well, he’s Dean. He captivates Castiel. They find themself wondering what it might be like to kiss him. Meg catches them looking up to the door when the bell rings, and being slightly disappointed when it’s not him.
Later, guys.
Dean poorly attempted to conceal a laugh when Cas accepted defeat and replied, “Of course, Jack.”
Cas smiled, only a little bit smug.
“So, uh. You, um,” Dean said. “Lost the coat, huh?”
Castiel shakes their head, moving towards the windows. “I can’t.”
Dean’s eyes are drawn to their chest. “Nice pins,” he says when he looks back up.
They’ve only ever talked, only ever seen each other here, at their coffee shop. They haven’t even known each other for that long. It’s only been about two months.
“Online dating?” Charlie suggested half heartedly. “Get them to match with each other? I could hack those sites in my sleep.”
“Damn,” Charlie said, nodding in approval when she saw Cas. “Looking good, Cinderella.”
“Awesome!” Sam said. “Okay. Cool! So, uh, Charlie and I will just go back to the motel, and you and Cas can do that here.”
Rowena rolled her eyes. “Skin to skin contact, not sex, Winchester. Of course, I’m sure if you were offering—“
She grinned and shot him a thumbs up.
Dean laughs and takes a bite of the muffin. “Sammy did that to me once, but with that one song from— holy shit, Cas, this is amazing.”
“What else are we supposed to do?” Sam said. Short of nearly killing one of them (as though that didn’t happen enough), he was out of ideas.
“Were you… getting coffee?” Cas looked between Dean and the tray.
“Bye, guys!” Sam said, and before Charlie could say anything else, he dragged her out the door.
Castiel takes the coffee from him and Dean raises a hand to lightly touch his lips.
“Serves them right,” Dean said almost petulantly. “That’s what they get for trying to set me up with my boyfriend.”
“I think they’re just oblivious,” Sam said. Or— “Maybe they haven’t figured out that they like each other like that.”
Dean usually comes in on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Those quickly have become Castiel’s favorite days of the week. It’s rare that he comes on the other days that they’re working, so when Dean comes in that Saturday, Castiel isn’t expecting him. He’s never come in on a weekend before.
“I told you I had a good feeling about this one,” Charlie said.
“Dean,” Castiel says, then stops. They’re struggling for something to say besides
Charlie grinned. “Hell yeah, he does.” Her smile faded slightly. “But if it’s not that he’s in the closet, then what’s keeping him from making a move?”
thank you so much to everyone who leaves kudos or comments!!
Charlie waved him off. “Nothing.” She raised her voice and directed her next words to Sam. “You can uncover your ears, Sam!”
Dean could still hear Led Zeppelin playing faintly in the kitchen. She had loved that band. They were her favorite, better than—
“Plus,” Meg adds, “I want to be invited to your wedding, and you two aren’t gonna get married if all you do is stare at each other.”
“Okay,” Castiel says, frowning. That order doesn’t make a lot of sense.
“What’s the favor?” Castiel asks.
“Open!”
“Claire is cute with Kaia a lot,” Cas said, winking conspiratorially.
I had a lot of fun writing this chapter— I hope you enjoy it!
Castiel is well aware that that’s a pickup line, but they don’t acknowledge it. “Yes. I opened this shop, actually.”
Between forkfuls, Jack launched into a story about how yesterday at school, they found a frog under the slide and named it Toad. Apparently, their teacher let them bring the frog inside to keep as a class pet.
“Can I tell you a secret, though, Jack?”
“Oh,” Jack said, nodding seriously. “If we make him his coffee will he come in for birthday pancakes?”
“No,” Castiel says.
“Yup,” Charlie grinned. “It’s foolproof.”
“So,” someone behind them said, “I overheard you that you’re gay.”
“This Charlie would be correct,” Castiel says, lips quirking up in a small smile. “Our honey macchiato is one of my favorites. I’m partial to the Bumblebee Iced Mocha as well.”
“I thought you were done with all this crap!” Dean said.
“Don’t listen to Claire,” Dean said, moving back towards the stove. “She doesn’t know what she’s talking about.”
“Wouldn’t one of them have to be a barista for the coffee shop AU trick to work? or strangers?”
“Dean isn’t going to talk if we’re listening,” Sam said reasonably.
“Meg made those this morning,” they tell him as Dean outright moans.
Castiel leans fluidly across the counter and kisses him.
“They’re so cute, aren’t they?” one woman said dreamily.
Dean sighed contently. “Yeah. Yeah, I do.”
Before Dean could put his foot in his mouth further, Charlie hastily changed the subject.
“Of course,” Castiel tells him. Of course for Dean.
“So,” she said when she pulled away, “where’s Castiel? Is McDreamy here?”
What were they doing wrong? He and Charlie had tried almost everything— coffee shops, bed sharing and fake dating, locking them in a room together.
Dean’s eyes widen and his grin is radiant when he catches sight of the pie sitting amongst the muffins and pastries.
Cas turned his head to squint at her. “Is there a problem with my clothes?” He looked down at himself a little self consciously.
“Oh! Hey, Cas!” she says brightly. “How’s it going? Did you come here to buy something or to tell Dean that you’ve settled the debate and that Chewie is the coolest wookiee to fly the Falcon?”
Castiel can’t wipe the smile off their face. It’s still there several hours later when Kevin comes in for his red eye.
Sam wanted to slam his head against a wall. Those two idiots. How could they have that much UST and not do anything about it?
“It’s alright. Very rarely does anyone say it right the first time,” Castiel says, accepting the bills the man passes them.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say, Professor. When there’s a honey bee apocalypse and they end the world ‘cause they don’t need sleep, I’m gonna tell you
“I know,” they say quietly. “My family didn’t take it well, either.”
“Yeah! So, you know, it’s not like anyone will hear anything or anything,” Charlie added.
Dean dropped the hat onto Cas’ head. “The birthday boy is right,” he said, evidently pleased. “Now we’ve gotta get a picture.”
“Later, buddy,” Dean assured him. He slung an arm around Cas’ shoulders. “Let’s wait for everyone else before that.”
“Sam?” Dean repeated dubiously.
“Yup!” Charlie said. “Anyway, you’ve gotta wingman for Cas. Who knows, maybe he’ll find the Siobhan to his Kristen.”
“Um,” they say awkwardly, “would you like your bee fact?”
not gonna lie, I’m kinda in love with Darius. Darius, my beloved, my favorite oc demon.
I hope you guys have enjoyed reading this as much as I enjoyed writing it. Thank you so much to everyone who’s commented, left kudos, or interacted with this story in any way. It’s been amazing to get to share this with you :)
The man offers him a grin. “Hey. Uh, could I get—“ he looks up at the chalkboard. “—uh, a caramel latte, and…. Charlie says you guys have a good honey macchiato, but I don’t trust her. Can I get your professional opinion?”
“So,” Sam asked, after he was… sitting in the front seat? Why wasn’t Dean pushing him to the back and having Cas sit up next to him? “So, Cas, how are you feeling?”
“Yeah,” is all Sam can say in reply. He’s too busy rearranging all the pieces of the woman he loves into this new picture. Nothing makes sense. He looks at Jessica Moore, the woman he’d entertained hopes of marrying, and he sees a stranger in her place.
Naomi sighs impatiently. “Please don’t feign surprise; it was you who insisted upon honesty. We both know that eventually you will cease these childish tantrums and choose the path which is best for you. One day, you will see that everything I have done, I have done for you, to improve your life, to help you rise above what your biology has dictated. If it weren’t for me--”
“Okay, let me handle this okay?” He looked over to his brother, imploring him to listen. "Oliver is skiddish and may not be willing to help us again. I don't need you going all batshit and scaring him off.”
“When did this happen?” Sam asked as Ben’s frown settled back into a small smile.
“Yeah, I guess I do. Sorry.”
“I know,” Dean whispered. “I know.”
“Dean, sweetheart!” An older woman called from the sliding glass door. “We’re ready for you.”
“I don’t know,” Charlie shrugged. “I think Social Services are being called.”
Two more strong, quick bobs up and down, and another swallow, and Castiel is coming down Dean’s throat. Castiel’s hips roll into Dean’s face as he comes, and Dean swallows what he is given.
Mr. TDB only tried to hide his amusement momentarily before smiling up at Dean.
Dean’s smile grew big again. He picked up one of his French fries and tossed it in Charlie’s direction.
Dean had his
Sam found Cas standing in the library, his head slightly cocked to the side and his eyes staring at the back wall where it met the ceiling.
Dean was startled by the comment and didn’t know how to respond to it. He stumbled around his words. “Cas, it’s fine- I’m not…it’s not like I don’t understand. I do. I get it. Inias was-“
“Well, I guess you do need some sleep then.” Castiel yawns into a soft sigh. “I’ll get up.”
“We are not going to engage him in that way,” Castiel replied.
“I’m fine, Anna.” Castiel told her, “Don’t bother.”
. About six months ago she sort of disappeared from their social circle. She said she met someone, but Castiel never knew who.
Michael frowned, but didn’t reply. A snicker came from behind them, where Luke had taken up residence against the bookshelf again. Dean kept looking back towards the ex-con, anticipating some sort of attack. When Gabriel handed Dean his drink, he sucked it down quickly.
He had always been the friendly type, not at all socially awkward. Normally, if he felt like he wanted to strike up a conversation with a stranger, he just did it. But something about the man across from him, made Dean more nervous to just go for it..
“I’ve got a few free days,” Dean replied. “Should work out alright.” Dean let out a sigh. “Man, we’re getting really close to Thanksgiving, aren’t we?”
“You cant know that.” Metatron taunted.
He was just so...Dean.
“Hmm,” Castiel replied. He kissed down to Dean’s belly button, flicking his tongue around as he squeezed Dean’s sides. “Better?”
“It's not pink and fluffy, is it?” Dean complained.
Hell, God is giving it the green light.
“Sorry, it’s none of my business.” Dean said with a wave of his hand.
Dean stood up from the bed and then he had an armful of Castiel. They didn’t speak—and
I hope you enjoyed that emotional rollercoaster ;)
“Of course not,” Castiel told him. “I think Charlie just wants to make sure that you’re not too invested. It’s important to keep some distance here.”
“Dean, I…I don’t know how to address this,” Castiel sighed. “Losing Inias was…it was the most difficult thing I’ve ever been through. I can’t tell you how much it means to me that you are so worried about putting me through it again. I…” His face crumpled slightly then he leaned forward and kissed Dean again. His voice was soft when he spoke. “Thank you.”
Their eyes were locked on one another again and Dean found it nearly impossible to look away, but he did. If he wanted to go limp, he would have to nix the eye sex right now. He didn't know how long he could get away with sitting in bed with a pillow over his junk before Cas began to suspect something.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Anything?” Dean asked and pulled away just enough to look in Castiel’s eyes. He brought his hand to Castiel’s jaw and rubbed his thumb across his cheek. Castiel smiled weakly.
The silence is back for another round. It lingers the time it’d take to play a hand of poker.
But then he’ll be shipped off to the barracks and the Ranchers, that’s sort of the default setting, the farms and the fields always need more- more drones. Sweet lord… Or… there’s the middle ground in this disaster: he could be with Adam and Bobby in Makers. He’s good with his hands and all, he could swing it. And, well, then he’d be with Cas too. Maybe help him write his book… The thought is like a lifeline Dean clings to when he feels his whole life slipping under freezing dark waters.
It was still short of the midday meal, and Castiel was already exhausted, but he was on track for his duties and all the extras involved in welcoming their guests this afternoon. As long as there were no sudden catastrophe-
“It’s this bit.” Dean takes a discreet breath, hoping his middling-to-slow reading skills are not about to humiliate him. ”The human re-pro-duce- reproductive system was most affected by GF32, in large ways and small.”
“What is she going on about?” Dean mutters, advancing with the bottle. He gives the undulating witch a wide berth in case it’s contagious.
“It was painful. And the human was lost. It didn’t impede me, though.”
“This is more important,” Castiel says, and can almost imagine Hannah materializing near the footboard to say it certainly is
The room felt immediately lighter once the door slammed shut. Everybody breathed out.
Cole stands there with his fists up and a stupid look on his face. “Huh?”
“A leader- lord help us, I think it’s the antichrist! The end of days! They felt him step foot on the earth last year and now they’re looking for him to- to- serve and protect him until he can- can- ... I- I- why did this happen to me?! I never hurt anyone! I sell insurance! I go to church every single sunday s-s-since-”
“Oh. Oh,” Castiel repeated with a frown as the import sunk in. Humans needed to eat, particularly when they were expending this amount of energy on a daily basis. But Castiel could not call forth food from the Machine without linking to it. “Is there anything to eat out here?”
“Nope.”
...When had he become so desperate to understand humans that he was searching for meaning in their choice of furniture? He felt like some ancient augur looking desperately for guidance in the flight of birds.
“Okay. Okay.” Dean looked from the tablets in his arms to the mechanism. Think, Winchester! This was - was a mechanism (- no it’s not, it’s
(It occurred to him that he could ask Rufus about it, he’d lived through it. Holy hannah, Rufus had lived through the apocalypse and the crazy decades after. Dean kept thinking of things he wanted to ask the old man, and then would ponder how badly Rufus would kick his ass for being a nosy bastard, and Dean wouldn’t blame him...)
At the tense, stern tone in Dean’s voice, Sam glances up from where he’s fiddling with his glass.
Dean should be heading to his bedroll. Ginny has already dashed ahead and is turning around and around on the end of it, trampling out her spot. But Dean’s feet insubordinately take him past her to where a familiar brown coated figure putters around camp supplies. Ginny huffs a sigh behind him and follows.
“That is what you told Castiel here loud and clear not two months ago. You said you’d rather be dead than stay in the prison of Paradise. Or never been born, to be more precise, but I can’t arrange that unless I monkey with time, and my tools for that are still coming online. That seems a bit extreme, anyway, and also counterproductive. If you had never been born, this current reversal of fortune might not have happened, which could lead to a paradox. I just got rebooted, I don’t want half my subroutines spinning wheels on that, thank you very much.”
“I gave you my word I wouldn’t harm him,” Cas said quietly. His eyes hadn’t even flicked towards the ax waving a foot from his face.
“What?”
“I’m sorry, what did you say?” he has to ask for the second time.
“That’s a reach,” says Crowley with zero amount of surprise in his tone. “Who told you that?”
Castiel’s wings furled in tight in the higher spheres. He forced them to relax, even though Dean could not see the defensive gesture. “There can be... oversights in the system. But if there are issues you should refer them to an advocate like your brother.”
Balthazar smiled dreamily up at the ceiling as he tipped back in his chair. “Something you need to learn, brother of mine, Zachariah’s pettiness knows no bounds. If we could weaponize it, we would have decimated all our enemies eons ago. He wrote this thirty minutes after you left his office - probably the time it took him to realize he could do this and what would happen. It’s not half as dumb as his usual plans. Dean was a highly ranked soldier, he’s been called back to the Hunters several times over the years, nobody would have reason to find this particularly odd. Yank him away and put him at the front line, you’d be bound to follow, right? Hey presto! No more Seraph in Zach’s feathers.”
“Dude, fifteen years on the front line, I know the score.”
Dean wove around a bunch of visitors (Nova Scotites? Halifaxians?), accepting that most of them, girls and guys alike, immediately spun around to look him in the eye, hoping he might be The One. Dean was used to it. He’d been beating visitors off with a stick since he was sixteen, well, bar those times when he wasn’t, ah, available, thank you Heavenly Host. Though Visiting Days made him nostalgic for the front line - or damn, even solitary Penance, forced to live in a shadowy splinter of the city with nobody else around for a week or two until the angels deemed he’d learned his lesson. There were more severe punishments, but Dean was careful to avoid them all now. He had better ways of fighting back than the minor peccadilloes of his youth, and he could do his job best if he remained free of all notice, good or bad.
“I am on earth, Sam,” Castiel says with a distracted frown. “Oh. Sorry.” It seems they have arrived. Sam has already climbed out of the car.
“Yeah, but you’re here now, and anyone tries to burn anything of yours in Winchester, you just point me at ‘em, okay? Calm down.” Dean catches Cas’s gaze over the board he’s holding, trying to project authoritative calm like he’s seen John and Vic do.
“Nah, he can’t remember it.”
There was still someone in the library lobby, putting things away. Dean jogged up to her.
I should be posting two chapters this week, today and Thursday, as this chapter is short, and next chapter is where Dean and Cas finally run into each other and sparks, predictably, fly :)
Clancy whines and sits down again. Twenty seconds. Then his butt starts twitching again, and little whimpers erupt from his throat.
“Or?”
...Explanations were going to be skull-fuckingly complicated as well as boring, Dean was sure of it. Good thing he’d decided to bypass them in favor of torture time.
“Worry about yourself, Cas!” barks Dean, rushing towards him. “Quick, get those off and get in a shower!”
Dean said nothing. John Winchester would be proud.
“Yeah. If you don’t mind.” It’d be like spending the night in Ellen’s room. Just plain weird - weird-uncomfortable rather than the plain weird-weird of Dean’s room materializing all around them once more.
It’s the look on Dean’s face that arrests Castiel before he can reach down and heal him. Hardly the expression of a man happy to see his lover coming to the rescue. Dean looks like he’d rather have that demon dig out his entrails some more.
“No, it’s different.” Cas seems a bit hesitant to elaborate. “Each compound is too close not to be under one ruler, and they’re too small to be self-sufficient. The whole has to be cohesive. As to how he maintains control… “
Castiel was rummaging in an oleander bush nearby, its blooms sending up sweetness and tiny bursts of pollen onto his hands when he plucked a few twigs. He put them where the granite stone had been, poking them straight up in the dirt.
Step back. I can give you assurances I will not harm you. But you have no idea of the consequences of what you're about to do.
“What do you mean?” John asks, curious and intent.
“He speaks to Michael,” Cas said. Something was shaking at the back of his voice.
Dean’s said what he needs to say about the road they’re gonna take tomorrow and he’s hoping they can now go back to camp for some chow, but from the way Sam’s looking at him sideways and then away again, the discussion is gonna head down a rabbit hole once more, Dean just knows it. What now?
“Talking about those horrors violates several decrees,” Castiel admitted. “‘The old ways are done.’ Revelations.” And the angels shouldn’t have to raise bogeyman and feed fear in order to get people to appreciate
“Most of us become betas at puberty as a result of societal pressure, when your pack’s need for another beta combines with your own physiology and mentality. Then you go about fulfulling your desires and biological imperative of finding a mate by having sex with everything in sight, which also aligns your rank in the betas of your pack at the same time. But I think… I have reason to believe there’s a lesser-known imperative other than societal pressure that can make you transition to beta, when you-... ah, when you’re an omega stray who could never be bothered with people much before, but you… but you get to know this beta who’s the nicest man you’ve ever met, simply put, smart, down to earth but still forward thinking, and awfully easy to look at as well, and who is
Thanks to Dean’s recognition and personal interest in Castiel’s career a year ago, the fallen angel avoided becoming a foot soldier lost in the rank and file. His tenure in the Hunters proved him to be faster, stronger, tougher than most humans of this age, and he’s had a few billion years of experience commanding small military units and fighting demons, so despite all his oddities and his newness, everybody approved Dean’s decision to promote him in Victor’s place. Castiel has been leading this motley crew of humans for the past half year, and they’ve become his pride and joy too, come to think of it.
“Ah. Lemme guess. You got stuff outta the basement earlier, maybe left the door open while you headed to the attic… by any chance, did you go and close the door just before you put the lasagna on the table?”
with it?! You brought back such- such a vile and indiscriminate weapon?! You- They- they attacked us! Injured my friends, nearly killed Vi-”
With a flicker of thought, the coin vanishes from his palm to reappear on a gold chain around his neck. But since he’s only just signed the book, he doesn’t yet have a regiment, orders or a notion of who does what here, so his next step as Dean’s brand new soldier is to find his liege and go on from there.
“Do you think he’ll ever find her? We sure she’s not one of those in our care? She must have been right in the thick of it. Maybe she breathed in that poison.”
Sam’s eyes go wider than Castiel has ever seen them and his jaw sags. Castiel waits for the surprise to abate, unsure what emotion will follow. He and Sam are very close, despite past mistakes, but Dean is Sam’s only family, and the brothers are extremely protective of each other.
Dean looks at mister ‘I refuse to speculate’ curiously, wondering if the library, or Dean’s effort to bring him here, are giving Cas a free rein he normally doesn’t allow himself. “It’s not?”
“No, no.” Castiel shakes his head and swats at Dean’s hip. “Your son has staged a nerf gun assault outside your door this morning. I suggest you be clothed when he attacks.”
“Ya know,” Dean replied quietly. “Those African sticks.”
“You say that Cain has revealed the man’s fate already, that he is living Cain’s life in reverse. If that is so, then you should expect for him to kill the enemy first, then the lover, then the brother.”
“A little bit of everything. I write. I went on a few open call auditions. I even took an art class recently. I just haven't found anything yet that really speaks to me, you know?”
And then they were falling.
Sam took in a breath and let it out forcefully. “Look, I cant speak for him. I don't know exactly what's going on in his head because he wont talk to me about it.”
He was about to spend the weekend at his boyfriends house, and despite how tired and grumpy he felt, Dean was positively giddy about it.
Dean shut the door and turned around to face them, his face the complete opposite of the happy tone he had just exuded to the party guests. With his hands on his hips, his bare legs, red mask, and flowing cape, the firefighter looked like he had just stepped out of a comic book. Castiel tried to push down the amusement he felt at the sight. It wasn’t hard to do, considering how entirely pissed off he was with his brother.
“Cas?” Dean whispered, looking out at nearly rotted fence that trailed the back part of the yard. It was broken in several places. “You can’t be serious.”
“Our little secret.” The man said simply, still not looking at Dean.
Castiel smirked back at him, mimicking Dean’s position as he wound his arms around his boyfriend. “I’m sure you’ll find something.”
“Do you want me to put my hands on your ass?”
Castiel walks quietly into their bedroom and stares down at Dean for a moment before waking him. He liked to do that sometimes, watch Dean sleep. Dean said it was creepy, but Castiel didn’t care. He liked to watch the soft rise and fall of Dean’s chest and the slow steady pulse under his skin. Castiel liked to count his freckles when he couldn’t sleep, even though Dean continues to hate it.
“Hello?” The woman said, waiting for a reply. “Hello?”
“Surprise, Cassie.” He said it like the surprise was a good one, but Gabriel’s eyes said something else. Caution.
The car ride to the psychics house was quiet but there was a thick tension that radiated around its occupants. Dean kept his hands on the wheel, gripping it tightly until his knuckles blanched, doing his best not to steal glances in the rearview mirror at Cas in the backseat.
“Hey.” Dean called to him.
When their food came, Castiel got an idea he was sure would make Dean break the silence first.
Three minutes later, he tried again, this time leaving a very strangled sounding voicemail where he hoped he at least mentioned his name.
With Dean, Castiel had to remind himself sometimes that they weren’t already engaged. He saw his future with Dean so clearly already. He wanted to marry him. He wanted a house with a big backyard and a porch swing.  He wanted to adopt kids with him and raise a family. Castiel wanted to grow old with Dean. He wanted to hold his hand on evening strolls around the neighborhood and go to dinner at four in the afternoon. With Dean, Castiel already knew he wanted it all.
“I will literally stab you in the eye with these.” Dean held up the tongs and made a stabbing motion. “Don’t think I won’t.”
“Cheer up buttercup, it’ll happen for you too.”
“Yes.” Castiel flicked his tongue over Dean’s Adam’s apple and enjoyed the shiver it elicited. He rolled his hips against Dean’s and enjoyed that reaction even more. “You know, there is another part of our first night together that I think we’ll end up re-creating.”
“It’s Michael.”
Cas let out another breath in irritation but began speaking Enochian. He placed his fingers to Metatron’s forehead as he finished.
Dancing with Dean was a lot more fun than moping over his ex.
In the bathroom, Castiel psyched himself up for the rest of the night.
Dean couldn't hear him through the scream of the Mark. He couldn't make our Cas’ words because they muddled together under the sound of rushing blood in Dean’s ears. He stepped forward robotically and threw another punch into Cas’ face, this time hitting his eye and splitting open Cas’ eyebrow.
“Don’t call Uriel.” Castiel finally said, when the three friends stood and began walking off the beach. “I can find my own date.”
Castiel shrugs. “You wanted to be the one to sleep in today.”
Castiel grinned at his brother for a moment, and then his smile fell. “Did it get better or worse after we left?”
“Okay, Cas,” Dean replied, smiling. “No problem.”
“Of course.” Dean said, looking affronted. “Twenty bucks says I’m successful and happily married in six years.”
“Yes, he comes in once or twice a week usually.” The woman answered, angling towards the door to greet another person. “You just missed him actually.”
“You’re not talking?” Castiel asked, returning the smile. He forgot how easy it was to be around Dean, how fun it could be just hanging out with someone.
When he didn't find the support he was looking for, Cas turning back to Dean and stepped closer.
“Like hell.” Dean retorted, turning his body to face Cas. They were standing so close Dean’s crossed arms were almost brushing against Cas’ chest. “I’m coming Cas. Aint shit you can do about it.”
“He did some sort of spell Cas.” Charlie’s voice was behind Castiel's and he turned to face her. She had stood up and moved closer to the angel and the hunter. Cas saw Sam on the floor behind her and felt concern welling up inside of him before recognizing the sound of the youngest Winchester’s steady breathing.
“Yes.” Dean nodded. “But she knew going in what it would be like. Lisa started her own business a couple years ago, so she knows what its like at the beginning. It takes a few years for things to get settled down and stable.”
Dean grimaced.
Castiel’s own smile fell slightly at that, but only for a moment. It was a blink and you’ll miss it kind of thing, but Dean didn’t blink, so he didn’t miss the anxiety that floated across the doctor’s face.
Dean closed his eyes, but as soon as he did, he saw things he didn’t want to see. Eyes that were closed forever. He swallowed back tears.
“I’ll give you a blow job if you wake up with the kids this morning.” Dean whispers into Castiel’s ear.
Trigger warning for homophobia and homophobic bible verses.
“About how my brother will terrorize me for the rest of my life? All of the time.”
“A year ago I might have taken you up on that,” Dean replied with a sigh. “But now…”
Castiel’s hands traveled up into Dean’s hair and began massaging his scalp, forcing Dean to flutter his lashes in ecstasy. The doctor’s fingers were long and strong, sliding between Dean’s tresses and eventually grabbing a fistful and pulling lightly. Dean went willingly.
“Uh huh.” Dean said, eyes on the road. His mind was working overdrive on how to get Castiel out the funk he had been in, ever since he saw his ex-friend with his ex-lover.
Castiel shook his head. “I don’t have a date anymore. Isn’t that kind of the point of New Year’s Eve parties?”
“Cas,” Dean whispers eventually, his lips grazing the shell of Cas’ ear. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t say anything—I couldn’t—”
“You won’t,” Castiel promised. “No matter what, Dean, I’m not going anywhere.” Dean nodded and Castiel kissed him. “I’ll try harder, I will—“
“I just met a very interesting woman who is definitely going to chew that one up and then spit him out.” Dean pointed out the mating dance taking place across the room. Castiel let out a little breath of laughter as he bore witness to Bela’s little game, and then leaned back into Dean and placed his lips against his neck. He kissed him once, twice, and then pulled back just enough to whisper, “How do you feel about a blowjob under black lights?”
Cas nodded slightly, starting to understand Dean’s reaction. “So you wish for my feelings to be used for another purpose?”
Dean let out a soft groan, and knew that when he felt the loss of one of Castiel’s hands, it was because that hand was now giving the doctor’s cock a firm stoke.
Dean.
“Wh-”
Dean could feel tears welling up behind his eyes and he sniffed unconsciously, still looking down into the floor.
Reaching into the bedside table, Dean grabbed the lube and threw it down towards Castiel’s hands, just as Castiel licked a long stripe up Dean’s cock.
“It’s not a ‘fuck or die’ spell,” Cas said. “She said that sex was unnecessary.”
“Sleep well, Sunshine?” Dean pressed a kiss to the side of his neck.
“Perhaps,” Castiel allows. Before Dean can say anything else, they redirect the conversation. “You have a very interesting way of organizing.”
“Charlie?” Cas was standing in the hall. “I didn’t realize you were here.”
Cas grumbled something into his pillow. He loved Jack, but it was far too early to be awake.
“I hate them,” she repeated without venom. “They’re idiots.”
“How— what happened?” they manage.
Rowena was waiting for them in the lobby.
“With Sam,” Cas said. “And Bobby and Ellen and Eileen and me and everyone else.”
Happy Easter to everyone who celebrates that, and an equally happy Sunday to everyone else!
“Gabriel is dead,” Sam reminded her.
Charlie grinned.
Very rarely is Meg quiet.
“This isn’t working,” he said.
“What is it?” Sam asked.
Dean and Cas shared a confused look.
“Obviously not,” Charlie argues. “Han couldn’t pilot the Falcon without Chewie! Not to mention how
They kind of want to see them.
“Alright,” Charlie said. She popped an Oreo into her mouth, then cracked her knuckles. “Let’s do this.”
“That’s my name, buddy,” he jokes, though it falls flat.
They did not kiss. They came out, clothing all in place, Dean grumbling about fucking witches and being locked in the kitchen without his fagottini, and Cas thoroughly exasperated. No messy hair, no hickeys, no nothing. Just thick enough sexual tension to build a goddamn bridge.
“I’ll take one of those, then,” the man decides. He pulls a worn leather wallet from his pocket then looks at Castiel, eyes flickering down to their name tag. “Both of them to go. How much, Casteel?”
I come bearing a god-awful gay pasta joke today. apologies in advance. sorry folks, I have a terrible sense of humor and you all have to bear with me.
Castiel’s treacherous brain reminds them of Winchester Records. They very pointedly ignore it. They don’t have anything to offer Dean except for coffee and themself. Right now, they’re his friend, and Castiel thinks that might be enough for them. At least, they’re trying to convince themself of it. Being more, though? They shake their head. Wishful thinking. It’s all just wishful thinking.
Dean looked a little pained. “Yeah. Sure thing, Cas,” he said. “Well, I’ve got… stuff. So, just wanted to bring you some coffee but. Yeah.” With that, he turned and walked away.
“Cas?” Dean says nervously. “Say something, buddy?”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says, giving Dean their own smile. “Did you know that bees have two pairs of wings?”
I’m gonna tentatively say that there *may* be a time stamp or two in the future. There are a few scenes in my head that didn’t make the cut for the main fic, but if I get around to writing them, I’ll throw them up here. Until then...
Dean flushes and looks away from Castiel. “That wasn’t— we weren’t—“ He looks helplessly back at them.
“Yes,” Cas said.
“Anyway, we’ve gotta go,” Charlie said. “I want to watch them kiss!”
They say there for a few moments, as though expecting a sign.
Sam considered it.
“I don’t know that song,” Cas said, “but I trust yours and Sam’s judgement.”
“Thanks, Cas,” he says.
“Yeah, well, un-Spider Man him, alright? Maybe we’ll let you live then.”
He looks surprised, but pleased. “Yeah. Took a hell of a lot of work to get it off the ground, so I can appreciate the dedication you’re putting into here.”
“I’m your friend, aren’t I, Clarence? Can we rename black coffee to ‘Shit In a Glass?’” Meg looks up from the table she’s wiping down to flutter her eyelashes imploringly at them.
Dean was standing outside the coffee shop Cas had been about to walk into. He held a cardboard tray of coffees in one hand, and the keys to the Impala in the other.
“Guys!” Sam cut in. They all looked towards him. “The case.”
“The best,” Dean agreed. He leaned into Cas even more. “It’s not fair.”
The story went on until after they were all finished eating and Jack hopped up from the table. Bouncing with excitement, he asked, “Can I open my present now?”
Sam bit back a groan.
Sam did his best to look surprised. “Nope. It’s good to see you, though, Charlie.”
Both Dean and the redhead look horrified.
Cas was looking at him hopefully.
Dean just shakes his head. “Came out to my dad,” is all he says.
“I’ll bet you do,” Lucy guffawed.
Sam and Charlie exchanged triumphant glances. Yeah. This was totally going to work.
“I’m gay, Dean,” Charlie deadpans.
“Castiel,” Castiel corrects. “And that’ll be ten dollars and fifty three cents.”
Cas frowned at the book. “I suppose,” he said.
Sam turned towards the window to hide his grin, but not before taking in the way Dean’s hands were clutching the steering wheel a little too tight, or the faint blush that had spread across his face and up to the tips of his ears.
Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. Sam was going to cry about this later.
“That’s just down the road, right?” Castiel says, starting on Dean’s drinks.
Castiel gapes at Dean. Did Dean just—?
“Okay.”
Sam grabbed his laptop off the library table and made for his room.
“You ready, heller?” Charlie smirked at him.
Learning that Dean isn’t straight shouldn’t make Castiel this happy. It really shouldn’t. (It does.)
“You know what? I should make burgers,” Dean said.
Thank you so much to everyone who has interacted with this story! It makes me so happy to hear you’ve been enjoying it so far :)
Cas wasn’t quite sure if he believed him, but he nodded. “I can see that.”
There was a dull thunk under the table.
Cas looked up from his research. “Thank you, Dean,” he said, accepting the mug Dean wordlessly passed to him.
When he leaves a few minutes later, Castiel now knows that his favorite kind of pie is apple, and they’re thinking that maybe it wouldn’t be such a bad thing to add to their menu.
Castiel shouldn’t be so pleased that Dean considers them not only a friend, but a best friend.
“Oh, no,” he says. “No way that you’re gonna listen to that. The good music is over here.” Then, he grabs Castiel’s hand and leads them over to
Sam closed his eyes and breathed in deeply through his nose. “Okay, first? Gross. Second? You’ve gotta figure this shit out, Dean. I can tell something is going on between you two, and I don’t think even you guys know what it is, but I think you know where to start.”
“You’d…” He paused, then gathered his nerve and continued. “You’d consider having kids with me?”
His heart jumped in his chest as he saw their local hotel on the screen, flames roaring in every direction. The reporter was too far away from the scene for him to make anything out except for the flames that licked the sky and several fire trucks blocking the view from the ground. Castiel scrambled for the remote and turned up the volume.
“The back of my hand. I jumped out of the way fast enough, I think. Just some splatter on my legs and feet.”
Castiel hung up then fell back down on the couch with a huff.
This was going to be great. He and Ash had been talking about this meeting for weeks, and he was sure they were  going to blow the investors away. He strutted up to the counter.
“Okay, but why?” Dean pressed. “I mean, Cas- I lo- I really care about him. I’m not going to give him up just because-“
The dark haired guy pushed the blonde away and pulled a duffle bag onto his shoulder.
“The, 'I can’t smile because then he’ll know how cute I think he is' thing you used to do.”
Dean pressed the button next to Sam’s front door that signaled his arrival to Eileen and Ben, then walked into the house like he always did. He walked in with the weight of the previous day’s tragedy heavy on his shoulders and the stress of keeping things from Castiel burdensome on his mind. It must have been written all over his face, because as soon as Ben saw him the little boy’s brow furrowed.
He let out a labored laugh. Castiel wasn’t so sure Meg was right. It’s not like he had given up on love or anything, but he wasn’t exactly brimming with excitement about potential romantic partners.
“Yes.” The woman answered. “
“Can’t help it.” Dean said, still trying to stay still but failing as his blood rushed downwards.
Sam could see Dean’s eyes darken so intensely he wondered if they would flick to black. Sam blinked a few times before swallowing back the fear that threatened to surface.
The question wasn’t delivered as harshly as the words struck him, but still, Dean felt compelled to nod vigorously before fetching Bobby a cup of coffee.
Dean held up is hands in surrender and rolled his eyes as he exited the car.
Dean took that as a good sign and pulled the chair in the corner closer to the bed. He sat down and crossed his leg at his knee. He winced slightly as his bad leg groaned against the position. He adjusted, then looked up to find Alex staring at him again.
“And what type would that be?” Gabriel asked before Dean had a chance to. “The kind that run into burning buildings? Or the type that could easily bend you in half and take your ass for a spin?”
“A little lower?” Castiel asked playfully. “Do you think that will help your nerves?”
Still no answer.
“Ha. Ha.” Dean scowled at his brother but didn’t deny the claim. He tried to busy his hands with seasoning the steaks, but it was like moving through sand. Another thing that Sam was sure to notice.
“I mean, mommy and daddy never liked your love for cock, and Michael either pretends it doesn’t exist or openly mocks you for it, but
It was a split second, blink and you miss it feeling, but for just an instant, right as someone’s plastic tray hit the ground, Dean thought he had taken his last breath. The clatter pushed a rush of adrenaline through his body so hard and so fast, the rest of Dean’s body was shocked into paralysis. His muscles tightened, his body grew stiff. His eyes went wide as his breath caught in his chest and refused to be released. Unless someone was watching him closely, they wouldn’t have noticed Dean’s reaction to the innocuous event, but someone was watching. The redhead across from him.
“If I remember correctly, you hired someone else to clean up.”
“That’s not what this is-”
“Oh!” Dean laughed and Castiel let out a sigh of relief. “Right, my ducks!”
The stranger’s lips were curled into a grin. He only waited another beat before joining Dean in his conversation with himself.
Ben gave his uncle a confused look, then answered,
Dean stuffed in four more.
“So, can we get off the roof now? Cas has this thing about be and jumping out of houses, so I should probably put him out of his misery soon.”
Dean stares. Inhale. Exhale. Smile. “Well alright then.”
This was their first step to
was in return. What happened tonight couldn’t happen again.
“Fair enough,” Charlie replied. “Cas aside, why do you think you’re reacting so strongly to stuff now? I mean, you’ve been a firefighter for years. Has anything like this happened before?”
Jack’s eyes move slowly between them, frowning. It’s obvious he’s struggling with something, which Dean finds weird because Jack’s God now and God’s shouldn’t look so out of their depth.
He drifted his hand slowly up and down Castiel’s arm as the doctor spoke, listening carefully and asking questions when he didn’t understand.
“Um,” Dean stalled, not entirely sure how he was going to answer yet. “I don’t know, Cas. What are you thinking?”
Castiel shook his head. “Oh I do. They make me very happy. But too much of a good thing can be bad for you.”
Even without his switch dimmed down the way he liked it to be, Dean sprung into action. He could hear Donna pounding behind him with the medical equipment as he raced for the girl. His eyes picked up points of interest across the scene as he went.
“Because I know my brother,” Castiel replied, not looking at the man in question. Castiel liked to pretend Gabriel didn’t exist often enough, it wasn’t hard to do now. “If we start this ‘war’ as you call it, we will never get out from under it. It will never end. I’ll be arrested for little packets of baking soda that somehow made it into my lab coat. You’ll open the door to your apartment to find all of your belongings glued to the walls. We will be fifty years old and Gabriel will be recruiting our children into putting mayonnaise in our toothbrushes.”
“Well, not to be the callous subject changer or anything,” Jo interjected, “but are you and Cas ready to party tomorrow night?”
“Save it. I’ll tell you the same thing i told him. I am not going to have this conversation.” Dean walked closer to his brother, his chest puffed up in an attempt a bravado despite his deflated heart. “So you can take your pink elephants and any little insightful comments you’ve got planned and shove it up your ass.”
“No.” Sam rolled his eyes and ran a hand through his hair. “Of course not. Its Dean.”
“Shh.” Dean laughed through his chastisement. “My neighbors are the ‘call the cops type.’”
He picked the receiver of his telephone up and took a deep breath, his fingers ghosting over the number pad.
Castiel barely heard her, the roar of the waves drowning out one of his closest friends but amplifying his own self-loathing.
Dean pouted in a way he knew would make Castiel laugh.
Looking over Cas’ body, Dean could feel himself going hard and wondered if they could get away with having sex in the ocean. Dean squeezed Cas hand in an attempt to get his attention but realized that Cas had fallen asleep, his sun hat tipped slightly over his face.
His response is correct. It’s true. They’re in Heaven and they are happy. Dean is happy.
But that didn't mean Dean let himself explore those emotions more thoroughly.
“Why are you skulking in the shadows?” she asked. “That’s creepy.”
Dean nodded curtly before stepping closer to his brother with his finger pointed into Sam’s chest.
Castiel laughs. “How romantic.”
“You don’t think you will?”
Castiel nodded. “I’d add an office space and an open floor plan to the list, too.”
And then, the darkness flickers.
An eight year old boy dead, and Castiel Novak said
Cas’ text thread is his most recent, and Dean opens it up. Cas’ last message
“Well… Cas helped.”
One of Dean’s eyes twitches open, bright and amused, so he’s clearly been awake for some time.
chest, which sends
glad we’re all here,” Ava says, eyes flashing with irritation. “Yeah, this whole situation sucks ass in so many different ways, but if I wasn’t here, I never would’ve met any of you, and I wouldn’t have found out my fiancé was a dickhead until after I married him.”
Pamela frowns. “I could try and up the dosage on your current prescriptions, but doing so would have severe side effects, both on your mood and your functionality. There’s the risk of a loss of appetite, migraines, mood swings, and depression.”
Sam’s expression goes soft when Jess meets his eyes for a moment before focusing back on the windshield. It stays that way when he looks down at Cas, sleeping peaceful as a newborn in Dean’s lap. “I’m happy for you, jerk,” Sam says, then turns back to face the front.
“I know,” Castiel answers, cupping Dean’s cheek. “I heard your prayer.”
“Seraph! Would you like to comment on the crime waves sweeping through downtown?”
“What?” he hears himself say.
. He doesn’t sneak off.
The sounds become clearer as he creeps forward. His untrained ear can pick out the sounds of Latin, but there’s not a hope in hell of understanding it. On instinct, Dean glances back at Cas, who’s mouthing the words, his forehead knit in concentration.
is the one he most wishes he had.
Dean has never enjoyed hospitals.
Dean wants to argue, wants to demand answers now, but he knows from painful experience that talking back to his dad won’t get him anywhere. “Alright. Where d’you want to meet?”
He’s had that charm for years, ever since he first went to live with Bill and Ellen. He would wake in the middle of the night from screaming nightmares, convinced that the same demon who had killed his family had managed to creep into his skin. He would howl and tear at the sheets, feeling his hands ripping through his mother, his father, Alfie…
“Cas?” Jack asks. “Will you help me?”
Everything is spinning out of control and the only person he has to blame is himself.
Sam shakes his head. “Still not talking.”
Gabriel shook his head. He traveled to the trunk of the rental car and knocked his knuckles against it. Castiel popped the trunk as Gabriel laughed again. “Oh, Cassie. Life has never been easy for you, has it?”
He’d assumed Alex had come up here to hide from them, but it’s entirely possible she came up here to do something else. She’d said some things that had worried Dean when he visited her, things that made him want to remove sharp objects from the hospital room. With fear now coursing quickly through his veins, Dean climbed faster to the top, his eyes flying over the roof in search for the girl. He saw nothing at first, but the eave prevented him from seeing the other side, so Dean carefully climbed up on the roof and crawled his way to the top.
Dean began to laugh again, but the sound that came out was immediately dampened by the next sound emitted from the speaker system.”
There was one feeling he was sure of though, the longing. Dean longed for Cas to return to him in that moment and Castiel had felt incredibly conflicted. On the surface, he knew that Dean would never say such a thing out loud. He had only admitted his dependence on Castiel during the most distressing of times, and Cas was fairly certain that the conversation they had upstairs would not qualify.
“Alright?” he asked. There was a twitch to his lips. A smile held back.
It hurt, looking at photos of him.
“It was just a hard day Cas.” He turned to the doctor, who placed both water glasses on the counter and faced Dean head on. “To be honest, I don’t really want to talk about it. That okay?” Dean asked earnestly, gently. He didn’t want to rock the boat here, not when things were going so well between them.
Dean just stared at her, mouth agape. Eventually he whispered, “Dude.”
“Don’t worry about that right now, sweetheart,” Donna responded. “Just concentrate on your breathing.”
“As touching as this moment is,” Gabriel said after a moment. “This reunion isn’t what I’ve brought to you, Cassie.”
“I don’t know,” Sam says and Dean freezes. Sam looks guilty, conflicted and… tired. He suddenly looks so tired. “I just…” Sam turns to Dean and sighs. “I already had this whole life. I mean, just because it was an alternate reality doesn’t make it any less real. I loved my wife. I loved my son. I was happy. I had a really good life, Dean.”
When he turned around to head back in the other direction, there was a picture in the art gallery’s window that caught his eye.
Cas smiled for a just a moment before the fear of actually having the conversation began to take hold. “Thank you Sam. Is Dean still awake?”
“Alex,” Dean inserted.
“Not even a little bit,” Charlie replied, finally getting back to her soup. “Don’t worry, it’s nothing bad. You’re going to look kick-ass.”
“Life.” Dean said simply, shrugging.
What Castiel saw there, made him want to throw up.
“Dean!” Cas’ voice yelled out to him from across the room. His vision was getting hazy as Crowley finished speaking and by the time the King of Hell backed away from him, Dean felt a fire burning through his body.
! You are an absolute peach! :)
“Crowley?” Sam repeats, incredulous. “You brought back Crowley?”
Dean rolled his eyes. “I ain't going to become that thing again just so you have a playmate Crowley.”
“See you soon Castiel.”
“Are you uh- ready to eat?”
“Who’s that?” Alex asked, looking back at Dean again.
“Yeah.” Dean answered. “Just finished with the meeting. Everything went well. Should hear back soon.”
Dean hated the idea of Alex spending the holiday alone. He knew the nurses would make it nice for her, but Alex would probably prefer to sleep through it. Even though she had eventually agreed to play Exploding Kittens with Dean the other day, the girl was still closed tight, filled with rage and sealed with sorrow.
They didn’t know each other, aside from their airplane escapade, and yet Castiel had spent the entire day with Dean. Not to mention whatever it was that possessed Castiel to get down on his knees for the man in the first place.
Was he ready? Was Cas ready?
“He dumped you then.” Dean said confidently, then stuffed his hands back in his pockets.
Castiel moaned around Dean’s cock, his own dick leaking fluid over Dean’s leg. The feel of it just pushed Dean even closer to his edge, knowing that Castiel was so turned on from blowing Dean.
They walked from Dean’s car to the restaurant. Dean’s car was incredibly gorgeous, and Castiel was reluctant to remove himself from the soft leather of its front seats. It was shiny and black and Castiel was pretty sure people called a car like that a muscle car, although he hadn’t a clue what that meant. It’s presence reminded him of something, and Castiel was finally struck with something interesting to talk about.
Cas snaked his hands up the back of Dean’s shirt and pulled his hips closer to his own as his tongue dipped inside Dean’s mouth.
“Yeah, but maybe Alex doubled back. But even if she’s not there, maybe we can pull a Sherlock and deduce where’d she go if we do a bit of snooping. Bela left the key under the doormat.”
Dean couldn’t help but laugh again. He raised his hands in defense.
He grabs Dean’s hand and puts it on his stomach, covering his fingers in his semen.
“You framed my picture.” Castiel said soflty. He was touched that Dean not only had the picture printed, but that he framed it too.
“Yeah,” Dean replied. He looked down at his now soggy cereal. He felt the blush rising to his cheeks and wished he knew how to shake it off. “I know what it would mean for us. I guess I just…” He trailed off. He didn’t know how to say this part without accidentally proposing to him.
Right?
Castiel can feel themself blushing, too, but they ignore it.
“So, The Cab sound good, Cas?” Charlie said, ignoring him.
“Your usual?” Castiel guesses.
“I think cake sounds like a good idea,” Cas agreed.
“They’re idiots,” Sam declared. “Both of them.”
Sam met Charlie’s eyes and cleared his throat to cover a laugh. “So. Uh, when are we getting you guys dates?”
Dean rolled his eyes. “What is it, Jack?”
“These clothes work,” Cas said. “Is that not the purpose of them?”
“Han, obviously. Right?” Dean’s relaxing a little bit, the awkward way he’s holding himself turning into something more natural.
“But seriously, Cas,” Gabriel says after a minute. “Meg has pictures of the two of you staring at each other. It’s pretty obvious that he likes you.”
“I’m Dean,” the man says.
Dean was blushing, eyes roaming over Cas until he seemed to catch himself and looked away suddenly.
Dean wants to go on a date with them.
“Come on,” Cas said, crossing the room to slowly take his hand. “We’ll clean up in here later.”
Castiel nods. “Yes. You frequently complain about having cat fur on all your clothes.”
“Bring your laptop into my room,” Sam said. “I’ll meet you there.”
Sam stuck the bags into his cart, lodging them between a few loaves of bread. He went back to looking for kale, tamping down an already triumphant smile.
Charlie mumbled something unintelligible.
Sam really hoped so.
Any snarky remark Dean was about to make back was lost as he watched Cas awkwardly climb into the backseat. He swallowed before opening the driver’s door almost mechanically.
“I can’t believe she’s gone.” The words came out hollow.
Castiel thinks as they watch him go,
“Cas. Can you or can’t you?” Charlie prompted. “I need answers! Cover your ears, Sam.”
“I see that,” Cas said, moving towards the coffee, but not before giving Jack a small smile and saying, “Happy Birthday.” He was in the midst of pouring himself a mug when two arms wrapped around his waist.
Dean very quickly has become one of their best friends, too, despite the fact that they only ever see each other for a few minutes at a time.
“Han Solo,” Cas said. “The character you said you would marry if he didn’t have a wookie.”
“It totally is,” Dean said. “I’ve never seen a mobile as pimpy.”
Cas gave Dean one of his just-there smiles. “I drove myself. My car is parked down the street. I can’t leave it. But if Charlie sends us on another coffee run, I would gladly ride with you,” he said sincerely.
“He should start showing symptoms within the hour.” Rowena crossed the room, picking up an already packed bag. “Best of luck, boys, Charlene.” Her heels clicked briskly as she left, the door shutting behind her with a snap.
Now, they just have to figure out what they’re going to do with their newly acquired vinyl, seeing as they don’t have a record player.
“Hello, Dean.” Castiel offers him a small smile.
Dean’s eyes widen. “Seriously? Dude, that’s awesome!”
“Oh, yeah!” Charlie nodded. “Yeah, Dean would marry him if he could. Personally, I’d go for Leia, but Dean has a type. Dark hair. Badass. Looks hot killing people. Wears layers.”
told her.” Dean turns his pleased gaze from the pie to Castiel. “Alright. Gimme my bee fact, pie, and coffee.”
“Good,” Dean said. “Ladies, have a good lunch. Steve and I have, uh— stuff to do.”
Dean starts unwrapping his muffin while he asks, “You close with your siblings?”
“Chewie, obviously,” the redhead behind him says.
and Castiel likes him. As a friend. Plus some. Dean doesn’t like them. No way. They don’t want to make things awkward between them.
Charlie was peeking out from under the table, watching the exchange.
disclaimer: I have never seen Star Trek (yes, I know) so if kirk and spock met in a coffee shop, my apologies.
Charlie looked across the library table at him.
They stand there beaming at each other for another few moments before Castiel remembers that they have to finish the drinks for Dean. When they set them down for Dean to grab, he pulls a black sharpie out of his pocket and scribbles something onto one of them. He picks it up and holds it out to Castiel.
Castiel shakes their head. “Like I said, we’ll see.”
“I can’t believe them,” she said, voice muffled by the blankets. “Why haven’t they kissed yet?”
Charlie was beaming, practically bouncing up and down with excitement as she scrolled through her music.
Yes, I did spend the lord’s day sneaking off to read gay fanfic and eat copious amounts of chocolate. Yes, I am probably headed to super mega turbo hell. No, I have no regrets.
Crowley considered it for a moment, then said, “Fine. You have yourself a deal. Moose, Ginger—“
Charlie coughed her way around a laugh.
“Text me?” he asks.
A look of understanding flashed across Lewis’ face.
Charlie squealed. “Oh my god! We’re gonna give you a montage!”
“I remember when I first met your mother,” Cas said softly. “It was winter break, our freshman year of college. You asked me if I wanted to come home with you. When we got there, she was waiting with a plate of cookies. She forced you to get our things inside before you could have one but she practically dragged me to the kitchen.”
“Yeah!” Jack agreed. “Close ‘em!”
“My type?” Cas repeated, brow furrowing. “I don’t think I, uh, have a ‘type.’”
Unbeknownst to Sam, Charlie, or the legions of hellers outside their room, Dean and Cas were very much canon. Canon when Dean fell asleep to Cas’ fingers running through his hair. Canon when they shared stolen kisses in the Impala, on hunts, in town. When Cas stole Dean’s fries and Dean grumbled at him.
“Can I give Daddy a kiss, too?”
“So then what did those people do?” Cas asked.
“What?” Sam peered at the screen. “Charlie? You there?”
Jack’s eyes widened. “Really?”
printed in pink, purple, and blue. Like Meg, he takes note of the flag in the window right away and grins.
At first, they’re pleasantly surprised. And then Castiel sees the tense set to Dean’s shoulders and his heavy walk. He gets in line for Castiel’s register, now mostly obscured by a cluster of college students that are waiting behind the patron Castiel is making a honey cappuccino for.
“And Charlie— uh,” Dean fumbled for an explanation as to why Charlie couldn’t be naked with Cas. “She’s, uh— she’s a lesbian, and it would really suck if she was uncomfortable being naked with a guy all night, so—“
Sam offered him a small shrug.
The bell chimes as the door opens.
I’m also just gonna apologize in advance, so...
Charlie whipped out her phone and started typing hurriedly.
“I can help carry the coffee,” Cas offered. He reached out and grabbed the tray from Dean. “The Impala doesn’t have anywhere to put it, and you don’t have anyone to hold it to keep it from spilling.”
“Damn. That’s a lot of siblings. And I thought I had it bad with only one.”
“It sure is, kid,” Dean said. “How old are you again?”
“Bees,” Dean repeats skeptically.
“That can be arranged,” Castiel says and they get started.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas said sincerely. “I appreciate it greatly.”
Jack shook his head vehemently. “No! You hafta keep it on so we can show Uncle Sammy!”
“They’ve given up,” Cas said, pulling the shirt over his head. “Sam didn’t want to involve tentacles and Charlie is out of ideas. They’re both very disappointed.”
When Dean next comes in, a few days later, he’s… fidgety. Almost like he’s nervous. It doesn’t look like he wants Castiel to mention it, so they don’t.
