‘Come on,’ Dean encouraged. ‘Hit me.’
‘And what?’
A yellowish green liquid that smelled strongly of petrol gushed out of the envelope over her hands.
‘Yeah… cool…’ said Harry, ‘because Venus is in the twelfth house.’
Ron said scathingly.
Cas bit his lip but nodded. He took a deep breath and slowly swung his legs over the side of the bed. He planted his feet on the ground and stood, hissing through his teeth. He swayed slightly, but grabbed hold of Dean to keep himself steady.
Dean snorted. 'Trust me, McLaggen will
‘I was born on a Thursday, so I was named after the angel of Thursdays. If you pray to Castiel on a Thursday, he will guide you through any upcoming journey you may have.’
‘Wha-? Oh, oh right.’ Ron jabbed at his bullfrog so hard he poked it in the eye. It gave a loud croak and jumped off the desk.
'That's not what I said!' John said hotly.
‘Don’t worry, Dad,’ said Fred ‘we’ve got big plans for this money, we don’t want it confiscated.’
‘Don’t rise,’ Hermione whispered, ‘it’s what he wants.’
Professor Umbridge was standing in front of the marble staircase, arms folded, smiling sweetly at them ‘Ah, there you are, Mr Edlund. I missed you in my class this morning.’
John snorted. He’d barely come into his power at all the last time he’d seen Lupin. ‘Unfortunately.’ John took a sip of his tea, and another man came through the front door.
Cas frowned. 'I don't understand.’
‘-we never knew the names of every one of our fellows - he alone knew exactly who we all were-’
‘They couldn’t find who it was, and even though Winky didn’t do it, Mr Crouch fired her anyway,’ Hermione frowned.
‘Well, to be perfectly honest, Mr Watson, you seemed quite disoriented and I didn’t want to make it worse. I doubt you were likely to believe me at that point in time.’
‘Ravenclaw Tower,’ Cas said, stretching out his long legs.
Cas shrugged. ‘Professor Umbridge is watching me.’
‘Yeah, who does?’ Harry asked, slightly desperately.
Hermione, who had chosen to watch their snowball fight rather than join in, told them she was going back upstairs to get ready for the Ball.
John closed the door and went to stand next to him.
he told himself.
was the word Sam would use.
‘The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?’ it repeated.
‘Or ours,’ added Zacharias.
On the morning of the thirtieth of October, they all went down to find that the Great Hall had been decorated overnight. Enormous silk banners hung from the walls, each of them representing a Hogwarts house. There was a larger banner behind the teachers’ table that bore the Hogwarts coat of arms. John and Sherlock were the first down to breakfast.
‘This is such crap,’ Dean said bitterly. ‘Don’t worry, I’ll take care of him.’
‘What?’ Harry gasped.
Dean did as he was told, closing his eyes.
'What do you want?' John said shortly.
‘Looking forward to tonight, then?’ John asked.
Okay guys, really sorry for the long wait, I'm still kinda sick, so I've not been writing as much. I got my very own assistance dog, in fact! I do eventually want to increase my posting frequency to what it was, but I can't make any promises. Thanks so much for being so patient with me if you're still here! I hope I see you again soon.
‘Oh, hello!’ Hagrid smiled, having located the source of the noise.
‘A bit of
'And our friends would probably be fine with it. They all still hang out with Hagrid.'
The portrait hole closed, but Dean waited behind it with bated breath. Finally, he heard a gentle knock from the Fat Lady, and he shot back out again. ‘Thanks,’ he called to the Fat Lady, and sprinted almost all the way back to the bronze door knocker concealing Ravenclaw Tower. He knocked on the door, and the knocker said, ‘The more you take, the more you leave behind. What am I?’
'Second year,' Ron interrupted, 'you killed the Basilisk and destroyed Riddle.'
‘Don’t remember asking you to join us, Malfoy,’ Harry said coolly.
‘Do you need to go to the Shrieking Shack?’
‘Assuming they can understand you, of course,’ said Malfoy loudly.
‘My Lord, I must speak! All through our journey I have gone over the plan in my head – my Lord, Bertha Jorkins’s disappearance will not go unnoticed for long, and if we proceed, if I curse- ‘
‘I don’t really fancy having an episode in front of the whole school, thanks.’
Cas’s eyes flicked up to the door and back, and he nodded.
said Malfoy. ‘D’you want to be spun around in mid-air? If you do hang around… They’re moving this way, and it would give us all a laugh.’
‘It’s one of my favourite books,’ Dean told him. ‘My mom used to read it to me. I brought it with me, ‘cause you’re helping me read, but I haven’t tried it yet. Can I read it to you?’
Cas rolled up Dean's essay and got to his feet. 'Here.'
‘Thank you all,’ said Dumbledore. ‘You may go back to your lessons now - or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner, as they are about to end-’
‘Filth.’
'It seems that way.'
‘Take them away!’ he roared at the Dementors. ‘Take them away, and may they rot there!’
‘Since when do you even care?’
‘You said he mentioned his son?’ Sherlock said. ‘John?’
servant will have re-joined us- ‘
‘What in the name of Merlin was
‘When was the last time you saw me with a quill?’
‘It’s all right, you stay here and rest, I’ll tell Arthur you said hello.’
‘So what do we do?’ Hermione asked, her voice small and high-pitched.
Dean sighed. ‘He says he’s not going. He’s apparently just going to sit in his dorm all day.’
‘Cas…’ Dean prompted as Cas avoided looking at him. ‘You’ve gotta tell me what happened, you know that right?’
She flung her arms around Mr Weasley’s neck and the paper fell out of her had. As it fell, the headline became visible: SCENES OF TERROR AT THE QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP, complete with a twinkling, black and white photograph of the Dark Mark hanging over the tree-tops.
None of you have had to face him, have you? You think it's just memorising a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you're in class or something? The whole time you know there's nothing between you and dying except your own - your own brain or guts or whatever - like you can think straight when you know you're a nanosecond from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die - they've never taught us that in their classes, what it's like to deal with things like that - and you sit there acting like I'm a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up - you just don't get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn't needed me-'
There were about fifty of them, all wearing plum-coloured robes with an elaborately worked silver ‘W’ on the left side of the chest, all of them staring down their noses at him.
A warm glow filled Dean’s chest. ‘You really think so?’ he said. ‘Even though - you know - this stuff is hard for me?’ He gestured at the papers in front of them.
‘Yeah. Fine,’ he said, though he felt a painful pressure in his temples. He sought out Sherlock’s concerned eyes and gave him a feeble thumbs up.
‘That must be painful,’ Hermione said sympathetically.
‘I’m going for it!’ Fred hissed down the table.
Dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment, then he sat down smartly and looked alertly at Professor Umbridge. Other members of staff were not as adept at hiding their surprise. Professor Sprout's eyebrows disappeared into her flyaway hair and Professor McGonagall's mouth was as thin as they had ever seen it. No new teacher had ever interrupted Dumbledore before. Many of the students were smirking; obviously this woman did not know how things were done at Hogwarts.
'What is it?' said Sherlock.
‘Even still,’ said John. He popped open the top of Dolly’s tank next to his bed, pulled her out and held her in his lap. ‘A person shouldn’t have so much power. Seeing into other people’s lives feels… wrong.’
Dean gently lifted Cas’s chin. ‘I really do,’ he said. ‘You’re worth it.’
Dean sat miserably at the Gryffindor table on the morning of the match, poking at his bacon with a fork. Cas wasn’t there, but Dean hadn’t expected him to be. Opposite him, Ron was staring down at the dregs of milk in his bowl of cereal, looking as though he were seriously considering drowning himself in it.
Fred and George went to find their own compartment, and Dean sent Sam off to find some other first-years to make friends with.
‘Witness for the defence, Mycroft Holmes, Head of the Department of Mysteries,’ said Mycroft. ‘Must we go through this again, Minister? Surely we all have more important things to be doing.’
Sherlock picked it up and opened it, then rolled his eyes and tossed it at Mycroft. ‘Friends of yours,’ he said.
'And here all the way from Egypt, our referee: acclaimed chairwizard of the International Association of Quidditch, Hassan Mostafa!'
‘That means chief,’ Dean whispered to Cas.
‘You watch your mouth!’ shouted Ron.
He sat up and rubbed his face tiredly. He knew he wouldn’t be able to get back to sleep for a while, so he quietly shuffled out of bed and tiptoed downstairs. At least he could sit in front of the fire, but when he got down there, he saw Harry asleep at one of the tables, his homework still in front of him, and John was curled up on the sofa, sniffling quietly.
John nodded. ‘That’s a tough one. There’s not a lot about Seers in the library.’
‘Of course.’
‘Your Lordship is still determined, then?’ Wormtail said quietly.
Sherlock pulled his hand away, then sighed and rubbed his forehead. ‘I’ve never told you this… They weren’t able to reverse the Memory Charms he put on me. I still don’t remember most of our second year.’
‘Before you both got lost in my thoughts, you had something to tell me?’
day? But you –
Dean bit his lip. 'So Madam Pomfrey knows about this?'
‘Er- what?’
‘Really? That’s ingenious,’ said Sherlock.
‘What’s he doing?’ Dean asked immediately.
She was half right. At the very last moment, Viktor Krum pulled out of the dive and spiralled off. Lynch, however, hit the ground with a dull thud that could be heard throughout the stadium. A huge groan rose from the Irish seats.
‘It’s not
‘Never mind. It’s not relevant.’ John rubbed his eyes and followed Mr Weasley out.
John blinked in surprise. ‘You can’t remember?’
‘Come on,’ he said to Dean, leading the way back out of the kitchen.
‘It is,’ Cas said in disbelief.
Hagrid glowered at Karkaroff. ‘Maybe I’d better stay here, Headmaster…’
‘How does everyone know this?’
Umbridge spent the first half an hour making notes in her corner, then got up to ask Snape some questions.
The Hogwarts staff, demonstrating a continued desire to impress the students of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, seemed determined to show the castle at its best at Christmas. During the final week of term, decorations more magnificent than any they had seen before appeared around the castle. Everlasting icicles hung from the marble staircase, and the twelve trees brought into the Great Hall were bedecked in every decoration imaginable, including real, golden owls that hooted as you walked past. The suits of armour had been enchanted to sing Christmas carols, but they kept forgetting the words, and Peeves the poltergeist had to be extracted from them several times, when he made up his own, rude versions of the songs to fill in the gaps.
In unison, the witches and wizards along the right-hand side of the dungeon of the dungeon raised their hands, and the boy began to scream.
Melly smiled at him.
‘Oh, yes, I’m fine. Just reading this book Professor Moody gave me.’ He held up a copy of
‘I’m going to class.’
‘Are you okay?’ he asked the moment he saw Cas.
‘You recognised
'But I disagree,' Hermione continued.
‘You did well, you know,’ Sherlock said as they approached the Fat Lady.
‘Canary Creams!’ Fred shouted. ‘George and I invented them - Seven Sickles each, bargain!’
'I didn't. It's mostly instinct, I suppose.'
‘No,’ John mumbled, slurring slightly. ‘People will panic.’ He planted his feet more firmly on the ground and stumbled slowly on, keeping one hand pressed to his forehead and the other holding Sherlock’s arm.
‘Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment, and drop it into the Goblet,’ said Dumbledore. ‘Aspiring champions have twenty-four hours in which to put their names forward. Tomorrow night, Hallowe’en, the Goblet will return the names of the three it has judged most worthy to represent their schools. The Goblet will be place in the Entrance Hall tonight, where it will be fully accessible to all those wishing to compete.
spotted, would you?’ He nodded at John and Hermione.
'Well - learn Defence Against the Dark Arts ourselves.'
‘What?’
Castiel was conspicuously missing from the Hall, as was Gabriel, a fact that was not lost on either Sherlock or John, or Dean when he came down, scanning the room while he shovelled bacon into his mouth.
‘I was hoping to hear from Dumbledore today. But I suppose it’ll have to wait now.’ He sighed and took Dolly and her tank from Sherlock. ‘Come on. Let’s finish our lunch, then we can go over to the Weasleys’.’
‘Hello?’ called Harry.
He thought so loudly it reverberated across their link, and Sherlock finally woke up.
‘Never heard of it,’ said Ron.
Gabriel appeared at the table, but Dean didn’t take notice of him until Cas’s hands were covered in the paste.
‘Sherlock knows French, doesn’t he?’ Dean asked John during Herbology.
'Wait, there's more,' said Hermione.
It was late, pitch black outside but for the street lights, and John stared out of his window into the darkness. There was magic nearby. He slowly stood up, his bare feet touching the floor without a sound. He focused in on the magic, and gasped as he saw the white masks of three Death Eaters. They drew out a map, and one of them pointed at his house on it.
tested them?' Dean asked.
the killing curse.’ He put his hand back in the jar and pulled out the last, frantic spider. He put it on the desk, raised his wand and roared, ‘
'I forgot,' said Harry.
‘”Spew”?’ said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. ‘What’s this about?’
‘Where’s Bill, Charlie and Percy?’ said George as he entered the kitchen.
'I don't see why you shouldn't,' Sherlock said. 'Who would know?'
‘He does.’ He blushed at both the smile on his mother’s face, and the fondness coming from Sherlock.
‘Yes,’ said Harry. ‘I didn’t see Madame Maxime anywhere, though,’ he added, finding it pointless to pretend they hadn’t overheard, ‘and she’d have a job hiding, wouldn’t she?’
He left the others behind, running almost all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. Cas wasn’t there, but that didn’t deter him. He turned around and hurried over to Ravenclaw Tower instead, letting himself in. Again, no Cas. Losing momentum now, Dean went as fast as he could to the Shrieking Shack, Immobilising the Whomping Willow as he went. No Cas there either. Dean spent the rest of the day scouring the castle and grounds for Cas, but there was no sign of him.
‘Are you okay?’ John said to Sherlock.
‘It’s not just that,’ Dean protested. ‘He didn’t take any of his stuff with him. Said he didn’t need it.’
‘Ah,’ said Moody. ‘Yes, the last and worst.
'Sam?' Dean said in disbelief.
‘I now ask the jury,’ shouted Mr Crouch, ‘to raise their hands if they believe, as I do, that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban.’
Wormtail flung open the door and John felt disgust curdle inside him.
‘Three,’ said Mycroft. ‘They Disapparated before I could apprehend them.
Sherlock grimaced, unable to reassure him.
Sam raised his eyebrows.
They passed several heavy doors, all with iron locks, and all with numbers on.
‘Enough,’ Dean said firmly. ‘We - we
‘John, are you all right, dear?’ Mrs Weasley asked concernedly.
‘Like what?’ John said incredulously. ‘This seems like more of a job for Cas to me.’
‘I’m sorry, my Bulgarian is limited,’ Cas said to him, lowering his wand slightly.
Not long later, the old woman came back out of the courtroom.
John took a small sip of his potion at a time and his had gradually cleared of the screams and pain, though now all he could feel was a bone-deep weariness that made it difficult for him to lift the phial at all.
'Very well,' said Umbridge, making a note, 'you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days' time.'
‘I don’t know how much I can help, Sam. I’m not exactly good at it.’
‘You seem awfully confident that Magical Creatures is going to be an easy lesson.’
Outside, John was immediately pulled away by Fred and George.
‘Oh, no. With stuff like – where there are stronger feelings – it’s really hard to tell what’s going on.’
use Transfiguration as a punishment! Surely Professor Dumbledore told you that?’
John nodded, though it was almost indistinguishable from his violent shivering. He closed his eyes. ‘I saw them,’ he stammered. ‘All the other Seers he…’
‘Anna is short for Anabiel, the angel invoked to cure stupidity.’
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to hhhellcat for the comment!
‘He’s exhausted, Mr Weasley,’ said Sherlock.
The group focused its attention on her.
Cas smiled at Dean and sat down near one of the bookcases.
‘I grow tired of this Minister,’ Mycroft continued, then raised his voice so it filled the courtroom. ‘As you all know by now, Clause Seven of the Decree states that magic might be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances, and as those exceptional circumstances include situations which threaten the life of wizard himself, or any other witches, wizards or Muggles present at the time-’
John blinked. ‘I think you might be right,’ he said.
Hi everyone! First chapter of Order of the Phoenix is up and ready to read!
The stranger sat down in the empty seat beside Dumbledore.
‘Pass it over,’ said John, holding out his hand. Ron gave it to him and he frowned, turning it over. ‘Nothing,’ he said, giving it back to Harry.
‘Ah, “not well”, my primary facial expression,’ John joked. ‘But really, Hermione, I’m fine.’
‘Eurgh’ just about summed up the Blast-Ended-Skrewts. John peered into one of the crates and saw a clutch of what looked like deformed, shell-less lobsters. Horribly pale and slimy-looking, with legs sticking out at odd places, and no visible heads, there were about a hundred of them in each crate. At about six inches long, they crawled over each other, bumping blindly into the sides of the boxes. They gave off a very powerful smell of rotting fish, and every now and then, sparks flew out of the end of a Skrewt, propelling it forweard several inches.
She hugged him, much to his surprise, then gave John one last hug. ‘Keep yourself safe,’ she said.
‘But we’ve got an oven,’ said Ron. ‘Why can’t we just-‘
John repeated him as quietly as he could, and ducked behind the counter again.
John watched Harry go, the tension clear in his hunched shoulders. He understood Harry’s concern, but the warmth in his fingers coming from the parchment gave him the feeling that Sirius would be just fine.
Sherlock took advantage of the noise. ‘Don’t let it control you,’ he said to John. ‘It’s your power.
‘We’re allowed,’ Dean said. ‘We have notes.’
They went downstairs and paid, then went to stock up on their potion ingredient before taking a break at Florean Fortescue’s. John was examining their equipment list. ‘Dress robes?’ he said. ‘What do you reckon that’s about?’
‘We’re still waiting for Castiel, then we’re going over to the Weasleys’,’ said Sherlock. ‘We’re staying the night with them. It’ll be easier and they’re closer to the Portkey.’
‘I don’t understand.’
had been in the Forest more than he had. He immediately made plans to rectify the situation. No way did he want to be seen as the
'Is that what that is?'
‘I won’t ask if you don’t,’ Gabriel said, hovering protectively.
'How come?'
‘You’re JOKING!’ Fred Weasley said loudly.
They all nodded and Harry said, 'I wouldn't mind.'
Dean hissed. 'What are you doing?'
‘Perhaps not.’
‘Says who?’ Harry said grumpily, taking off his shoes and emptying them of water. ‘Hope they hurry up with the Sorting, I’m starving.’
‘What happened with Ron?’ John asked.
‘Blimey, this is heavy,’ Lee Jordan said, lifting it from the table Harry had set it on. ‘Open it, Harry, go on! Let’s just see what’s inside it!’
They finally arrived at their stop, and hurried out, almost getting swept away by the tide of morning commuters carrying briefcases.
‘Okay, come on.’ Dean reached behind him and Castiel emerged from the tent. His eyes and nose were red and Hermione passed him a cup of tea. He sat down and stared into his tea without a word.
‘I’ll go and see if I can find him.’
Hagrid paused for a moment, thinking hard. ‘That’s next lesson, Malfoy,’ he said. ‘Yer jus’ feedin’ ‘em today. Now, yeh’ll want ter try ‘em on a few different things – I’ve never had ‘em before, not sure what they’ll go fer – I got ant eggs an’ frog livers an’ a bit o’ grass snake – just try ‘em out with a bit of each.’
‘I like Ludo,’ Mr Weasley said mildly. ‘He was the one who got us such good tickets for the Cup. I did him a bit of a favour. His brother, Otto, got into a spot of trouble – a lawn mower with unnatural powers. I smoothed the whole thing over.’
Chuckling, John went over to Sherlock, who was standing by Castiel, smiling in the sunshine.
‘See ya,’ said Anna, leading Alfie away.
Sherlock was already pulling out a dark blue suit, but John had no idea what to look for.
‘I really don’t know about this…’
‘Yeah, except this time people think I’m in on it,’ John sighed, picking up another bulb.
‘Get off! I’m eleven now, Dean, I don’t need your help,’ he grumbled.
‘What sort of accident?’
Sam’s face lit up. ‘He sure did. You know, I think he’s seeing the
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas inhaled sharply, rubbing his arm.
The words were no sooner out of his mouth than the doors of the Great Hall opened again, and silence fell. Professor McGonagall lead a long line of first-years up to the top of the hall, so wet they appeared to have swum across the lake rather than sailed it. All of them were shivering with a combination of cold and nerves as they filed along the staff table and came to a halt in a line facing the rest of the school- all of them but the smallest of the lot, a boy with mousey hair, who was wrapped in Hagrid’s moleskin overcoat. His small face protruded from over the collar, looking painfully excited. When he had lined up with his terrified-looking peers, he caught Colin Creevey’s eye, gave a double thumbs up and mouthed, ‘I fell in the lake!’ He looked positively delighted about it.
Dean pressed his hands over his eyes. ‘Hogwarts,’ he croaked out eventually.
‘It’ll be all right,’ Sherlock said. ‘Mycroft won’t let him get whatever it is that he wants.’
'Why not?’
Dumbledore took out his wand, and tapped three times upon the top of the casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumbledore reached inside it, and pulled out a large, roughly hewn cup. It would have been entirely unremarkable, had it not been full to the brim with dancing, blue-white flames.
'Mundungus, of course,' said Sirius, and when they all looked puzzled he laughed. 'He was the witch under the veil.'
‘Well, I was never that smart.’
‘That won’t be necessary. I won’t sleep tonight anyway.’
stated in the paragraph twelve of the
‘I’m sure I can take it.’ She swallowed some of her own tea. ‘So… Sherlock?’
Cas nodded.
‘These names are?’ said Mr Crouch sharply.
John jumped. ‘Melly, you scared me.’
‘He’s on duty tonight, isn’t he?’ Sherlock said, turning pale.
‘You are further accused,’ bellowed Mr Crouch, ‘of using the Cruciatus curse on Frank Longbottom’s wife, when he would not give you information. You planned to restore He Who Must Not Be Named to power, and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong. I now ask the jury-’
‘Never mind, Amos,’ said Mrs Weasley. ‘Sure you won’t have a bit of toast before you go?’
Ron put an arm around Hermione, leading her away, and soon the only ones left were Sherlock, John and Sam.
'Gabriel's?’
‘What?’ John said.
‘Sorry,’ he said. ‘Do you need more time to rest?’
‘For the first and last time in your life, Weasley.’ Draco Malfoy had appeared in the doorway, accompanied by Crabbe and Goyle. Evidently the conversation through the compartment door, which Seamus had left ajar.
‘Our family are renowned for collecting knowledge,’ Sherlock explained. ‘A pastime I quite enjoy, though rarely get the time for.’
‘He should be here any moment,’ said Dumbledore. ‘Would you like to wait here and greet him, or would you prefer to step inside and warm up a trifle?’
John was walking slowly around a small kitchen watching an elderly man in his pyjamas limping around, preparing a hot water bottle. Over the summer, he’d gotten a lot better at realising when he was having a vision, and this is where he was now. He knew because the man couldn’t see him, nor hear him, but the broken hearing aid that John spotted may have ruled that out anyway. In truth, he had no idea why he was being shown an old man, but he tried to memorise as much detail as possible. At least that way, Sherlock might be able to figure it out.
he whispered, then, '
will forgive me for giving a short explanation, and allow their attention to wander freely.
‘That sounds… difficult,’ said Hermione.
Looking supremely unconcerned, Professor McGonagall addressed the class once more.
‘Dead,’ Hagrid grunted. ‘Died years ago.They told me.’
Dean considered him for a moment, then said, 'Wait here’, and ran back into the Great Hall to find Katie. He explained the situation to her. 'You can dance with someone else, if you want,’ he said to her. 'I know I'm being a terrible date, but I'll make it up to you, I promise.’
Mrs Weasley placed a bowl of porridge in front of John, and a couple of slices of toast down for Harry.
‘What are you working on?’ Harry asked.
‘Like what?’
The lightning had illuminated the man’s face. It looked as though it had been carved out of weathered wood by someone who had only the vaguest idea of what human faces were supposed to look like. Every inch of skin seemed to be scarred. The mouth looked like a diagonal gash, and a large chunk of nose was missing. But it was the man’s that made him frightening.
John closed his eyes and reached out for Sherlock. It was faint, but he got the impression across. ‘He’s busy…’ John mumbled. ‘Somewhere cold… Sweden? No, Norway… He’ll be back in a couple of weeks…’
‘What does that feel like?’ Sam asked.
Bagman was sitting at the table, talking to a witch in magenta robes. Viktor Krum was standing moodily in a corner, not talking to anyone. Cedric and Fleur were engaged in conversation, while a man holding a large black camera watched.
Half the crowd seemed to have realised what was going on. The Irish supporters screamed their Seeker on, but Krum was on his tail, then drew level with him as they hurtled closer to the ground.
'Fool,' moaned Mr Weasley. 'Krum was feinting!'
John sighed, disappointed. ‘So, you’re saying that I won’t be able to see whatever Voldemort doesn’t want me to see?’
‘Yeah, make it up. It’s not like she’ll know. Throw in a bit of misery and she’ll love it.’
‘Yeah, yeah, all right,’ said Ron, starting up the stairs again.
'On your bedside table.'
Sam’s expression softened. ‘Yeah, I’m fine. You have a bad dream again?’
‘Yes, Dean, it doesn’t hurt. It is a shame about this shirt, though.’ He emerged wearing a fresh, indigo jumper. ‘I bandaged it. It shouldn’t leak now.’
It wasn’t until the next morning that John felt well enough to walk across the village, and only after he’d eaten a large bowl of porridge.
There were noises of surprise from almost everyone gathered.
'Mr Filch, the caretaker, has asked me to remind you that magic is not permitted in corridors between classes, nor are a number of things, all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to Mr Filch's office door.
There was a murmur around the benches. Some of the wizards and witches were surveying Karkaroff with interest, others with pronounced mistrust. Then they heard a  familiar, growling voice from Dumbledore’s other side.
‘Sure.’
Harry, Ron and Hermione hung around at break to talk to Moody, and see if he had found Mr Crouch.
The music subsided and the Veela stopped dancing. Hermione pulled Harry back to his seat, tutting loudly, and there were angry shouts from around the stadium. Ron was moodily shredding the shamrocks on his hat and Mr Weasley took it from him.
‘I think it’s stopping,’ John said, voice barely more than a whisper. John sank further into the chair and shakily attempted to wipe away the tears quickly trickling down his cheeks. ‘I never want that to happen again… it was so awful.’
‘Dean,’ John sighed.
‘Wet,’ Harry said eventually.
Sam positively bounded up the stairs, followed by a grinning Dean. John and Sherlock were left downstairs with Mrs Weasley, while she set up a camp bed in the living room. She left them plenty of blankets and bid them goodnight, putting out the lights.
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to hhhelcat for the comment! See you again soon :)
‘We have to get out of here,’ said Cas. He too was extremely pale.
‘Yes.’ Lupin’s eyes briefly flickered up at Mrs Weasley, then back down to Dean. ‘Somewhere in Snowdon, right?’
‘Not bad,’ Sherlock said approvingly. ‘How are you feeling?’
Cas looked up at him, surprised. ‘Of course,’ he murmured.
Lucius's lips curled as his eyes wandered over Hermione and John, but he didn't dare say anything in front of the Minister. Instead, the three of them continued on down the row.
‘Well - I thought it was a good idea,’ she said uncertainly, ‘I mean, even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets, there’s nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon, is there? But… well, if you don’t want to use them - ‘
‘Who are
‘She was the one who started it,’ said Harry. ‘I wouldn’t’ve - she just sort of came at me - and next thing she’s crying all over me - I didn’t know what to do -’
‘Are you okay?’ Dean asked at Cas’s continued silence.
His revival seemed to give Ireland a new heart. When Mostafa blew the whistle, the Chasers moved into action with a skill unrivalled by anything they had seen before. After fifteen more fast and furious minutes, Ireland had pulled ahead by ten more goals. They were now leading by one hundred and thirty points to ten, and the game was starting to get dirtier.
'Yes, you can,' Dean said firmly. He carefully poked his head around the stairs, but Umbridge's hand was still swiping around in the fireplace, trying to catch hold of Sirius's hair.
Cas nodded, working through his panic.
‘Yeah, I know,’ said Angelina, ‘but she’s pretty good, actually. Nothing on you, of course,’ she said, throwing Harry a dirty look, ‘but as we can’t have you…’
Sherlock, however, had not noticed, and John found him in a corner, staring into space.
John sighed and nodded. ‘Thanks. How are you?’ he asked, not moving from his spot on the floor.
'Who?' asked Hermione.
‘Apologies, sir,’ Melly squeaked as she reached up to take the bowl.
‘What in the world-?’ said Dean.
'No, you're my date, Molly,’ John insisted.
‘That would make sense,’ John nodded, giving Harry the letter back. ‘I don’t see him getting caught though, if that helps.’
‘Mum-’
‘I don’t think he’s well,’ John said.
‘Still alive…’ he said slowly. ‘But that makes it sound…’
'Sherlock didn't seem too happy about it,' Sam grimaced. 'I'd better go see if they're okay. See you later.'
'No,' Cas and Dean said immediately, and everyone stared at them.
‘How then? Broomsticks?’
and Dobby the house-elf appeared in the middle of the room, Hedwig on his tiny arm. His large, pointed ears were sticking out from underneath what looked like every item of clothing Hermione had made.
Cas nodded. ‘I think it’ll help you if we get a quill that’s shaped more in the way you’re used to. It’ll help your handwriting and make your own work easier to read.’
He always got detention, but Cas’s help with his homework meant he never fell behind, though the words ‘
Cas looked down and John and Dean caught each other’s eye. Both were aware of the circumstances of his mother’s death.
Fred and George choked on their own mugs of tea, then looked up at Percy, huge grins on their faces.
‘I don’t know,’ Sherlock mumbled tiredly, not taking his eyes off John.
‘Ah, what evidence is zere of zat?’ said Madame Maxime, throwing up her huge hands.
‘That’s not really our area, John.’
‘And what?’ Sam had pulled out a quill and fresh parchment.
‘It’s okay,’ Dean whispered reassuringly, before knocking on the door. ‘Hagrid, it’s us, let us in,’ he called as loudly as he dared.
Harry hesitated. ‘Well, we can’t just take you without asking,’ Harry said to her.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. ‘It might be the only way to find out what's going on.’
‘Cas, if this were any other kid, would you blame them? Say if something like that happened to Sam, would you say it was his fault?’
Dean’s stomach sank, but he shook it off. ‘It’s fine, come on,’ he said bracingly, helping Cas up off the bench and grabbing his bag.
‘That’ll be Cas,’ said Dean, stuffing a sandwich in his mouth. ‘I’ll go get him.’ Dean wiped his hands on his jeans and sauntered down the hall, but when he pulled open the door, he was greeted by the sales witch from Magical Menagerie.
‘I don’t know, you’re the smart one,’ John sighed.
He opened it up, and inside was a pair of glasses.
Hermione got up, tiptoed to the compartment door, and slid it shut, blocking out Malfoy’s voice. ‘So he thinks Durmstrang would have suited him, does he?’ she said angrily. ‘I wish he
He was way more forceful with it than he should have been since Sherlock had annoyed him, so the book shot at him. He ducked just in time, and the book smacked the wall behind him, breaking apart. He glared at Sherlock, who gave him a smug smile.
‘I’m -I’m not ready for - that - yet,’ he mumbled. He hesitated, then grabbed both Dean’s hands and squeezed them tightly. ‘Is this all right for now?’
'Just me,' Cas said in disgust.
'Sorry,' said Dean, climbing up the steps to the Entrance Hall. 'Meet you for breakfast tomorrow?'
Sherlock knocked on the door, which opened on its own. He took that as their cue to enter, and pulled John inside a large and beautiful circular room. It contained a number of curious silver instruments that were stood on spindle-legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls were covered with old portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses. There was also an enormous, claw-footed desk, behind which, the Sorting Hat and the sword of Gryffindor were sitting on a shelf, and Dumbledore was smiling at them from his seat behind it.
Mr Crouch raised his eyebrows at Bagman. ‘We agreed not to make any announcements until all the details-‘
As dusk fell, John's temperature began to drop back down to normal with help from Castiel, and several, almost frozen, blankets that Cas tucked around him. Now satisfied that he would be okay, Cas turned to Sherlock and handed him a goblet of water. Sherlock took it but didn't drink it.
‘Yes, of course.’
‘It’s Ron’s dad,’ Harry said. ‘He’s been attacked by a snake and it’s serious, I saw it happen.’
‘Let me get that for you, dear.’
‘All right, fine,’ Dean sighed. He began to walk away.
‘I keep seeing someone being attacked by Nagini, but I can’t work out who it is,’ John said.
‘A twenty,’ John corrected gently.
Dumbledore watched John patiently.
‘Winky was there too,’ Hermione said. ‘Crouch’s elf. She didn’t seem quite as pleased about working at Hogwarts as Dobby did.’
safe here, Dean,' Cas murmured.
‘Here, drink this,’ said Sherlock, holding a glass of water to his lips. It was pleasantly cool and made him feel marginally better. Soon, though, the adrenaline wore off and John fell forward. Sherlock’s hand on his chest prevented him from hitting the table, however. He carefully leaned back in his chair, trembling. ‘How long?’ he asked.
A man was standing in the doorway, looking out at the tents. When he heard their footsteps, he turned his head to look at them.
‘I better go do homework too,’ said Dean, standing up.
‘Aye, I would,’ said Mr Roberts. ‘And who’re you?’
'Mum, shut up!' Ron yelled. 'It's okay!'
Cas nodded.
She squeezed his shoulder as she placed a fresh mug of tea in front of him. ‘It’s all right,’ she said. ‘I’m not angry with you, I just want you to feel better.’
'Well done, Dean.'
The Great Hall rang with applause as the Sorting Hat finished.
‘Do you mean to tell me,’ said Mrs Weasley, her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitors were scurrying for cover, ‘that you have been messing about with Muggle remedies?’
'Me too. All right then, it's settled. If Dad asks, which he won't, we don't know anything about it, and we're not involved, got it?'
Cas shrugged, and Dean nudged him.
‘Not messing about, Molly, dear,’ said Mr Weasley imploring, ‘it was just something Pye and I thought we’d try - only, most unfortunately - well, with these particular kinds of wounds - it doesn’t seem to work as well as we’d hoped - ‘
‘Tell me,’ he whispered.
‘Thanks, Mrs Weasley,’ John mumbled, sinking faintly into a chair. He struggled to pick up his fork, but felt much better as soon as he managed to eat something.
‘Well, I… I don’ know why that’d be…’ said Hagrid, tugging nervously on his beard and again glancing towards the corner where the others were hiding. ‘Erm…’
Dean sat in Charms thinking hard the next day, hardly even attempting to Silence the bullfrog sitting on the desk in front of him. He and Cas had left the Shrieking Shack early that morning, and he had tried to convince Cas to take the day off, to no avail. Having two attacks in the same day had clearly taken its toll on Cas, but he was intent upon not missing anymore classes, so he sat quietly beside Dean, pretending that he wasn’t shaking the whole way through the lesson. Dean planned on asking John and Sherlock to keep an eye of Cas for him, but neither of them looked up to doing much either.
Mycroft crumpled up the letter and made for the front door. ‘I need to speak with Dumbledore. You’d better pack your things,’ he said.
‘Harry, Fred and George got banned from playing,’ John said. ‘They jumped on Malfoy in front of Umbridge.’
Then, John's time ran out. He'd kept the Death Eater in the kitchen silent momentarily, but the one that had gone to check the living room, came out and saw them.
‘You don’t look so good, dude,’ Dean continued.
John looked around at the others in the room, all pretending not to be watching him with interest.
Dean nodded and found them a table deep in the library, so they wouldn't be disturbed. He got back to work on his essay, but no matter how hard he tried, he just couldn't focus on it any longer.
'Madame Maxime was with him, we've been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home - but there's he's hurt or - well, nothing to suggest he's not perfectly okay.’
Fudge strode up the ward, Snape and McGonagall close at his heels.
‘Hi,’ said Cedric, looking around at them all.
Cas nodded, lip wobbling. He reached inside his robes and pulled out his necklace, then closed his eyes. ‘It’s been a long day,’ he said. ‘I want to go to bed.’
Cas put away his wand, seemingly satisfied with John’s condition, then went back to Gabriel without a word.
If you follow the plan, Wormtail, the Ministry need never know that anyone else has disappeared. You will do it quietly, and without fuss; I only wish that I could do it myself, but in my present condition… come, Wormtail, one more obstacle removed and our path to Harry Potter is clear. I am not asking you to do it alone. By that time, my
‘I think the goal here is to keep him alive,’ John said.
coin, and because I’ve put a Protean Charm on them, they’ll all change to mimic his.’
Mr Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change. ‘Never been this crowded,’ he said suddenly, looking out over the misty field. ‘Hundreds of pre-bookings. People usually just turn up…’
‘Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, ghosts, and - most particularly - guests,’ he said, beaming around at the foreign students. ‘I have great pleasure in welcoming you all to Hogwarts. I hope and trust that your stay here will be both comfortable and enjoyable.’
‘Yeah, we’ll come too’ said George.
‘George!’ Mrs Weasley said sharply, and they all jumped.
though, is he?’ said Fred. ‘I mean, I know he’s a genius and everything…’
‘What was that?’ Seamus gasped as Harry slammed the egg shut.
‘I see,’ said Umbridge. ‘I will expect to see the both of you back in class tomorrow, or we’ll see about whether or not you belong at this school.’
‘I’ll leave Fang with yeh, Headmaster,’ Hagrid said, still staring menacingly at Karkaroff. ‘Stay, Fang.’
Cas took another shuddering breath, shifting himself into a more comfortable position. ‘I wasn’t supposed to come back to school this year,’ he mumbled. ‘G-Gabriel always convinced him to let me come, but - but now he’s gone…’ He pressed his lips together, stalling. ‘I ran away. I shouldn’t have, but I w-wanted to see you.’ He was trying so hard to hold back tears that it was constricting his already hoarse voice. ‘But I couldn’t stay forever. I had to go back and he was so
‘Not yet, but I’m sure I’ll think of something. Let’s go and pay for these, you look like you could do with some fresh air,’ said Sherlock, touching the back of his hand to John’s cheek. ‘Are you all right?’
‘No, he’s still not feeling well. He’s gone to the hospital wing.’
‘Don’t forget to send me a copy of that,’ Cas said as he left the room.
‘Yes, I think so too.’
‘We met a few people,’ said Ron. ‘Have you not got the fire started yet?’
‘Breakfast?’ John whispered.
‘They must go to Beauxbatons,’ said Hermione.
as she and Harry had to drag him away by the arms.
Dean held John up while Cas ran his wand over them. ‘Cas?’
Sherlock eventually went back to his own dormitory, and the rest of them stayed up well into the night to enjoy the party.
‘Usually the texture of the cover, the inlay used for the title and the amount of gathered dust tells me all I need to know.’
‘We do not practice wizard’s magic here. I confess, I do not know how to break any curses.’
‘A week? Wow. Yeah, that’ll do it. Who was it?’
‘I don’t know. Normally I can feel when he’s scared, which is a lot of the time. It’s sort of his base emotion, but now there’s nothing.’
Dean walked a lap of the lake, getting his fill of fresh air for the day. He knew that he and Cas would be spending most of their time in the library, so he wanted to have at least a glimpse of nature before they were shut up between the dusty shelves. When he was finished with his walk, he grabbed some toast from the Great Hall and climbed back up the stairs to collect his books. He opened his mouth when he reached the Fat Lady, but the portrait opened and Cas stumbled out. He too pushed past Dean and hurried down the stairs.
'Right then, everyone listen closely - Dean Thomas, if you do that to the mouse again, I shall put you in detention - most of you have successfully Vanished your snails and even those of you who were left with a certain amount of shell have got the gist of the spell. Today, we shall be-'
‘You won’t let go?’
'Yeah, Ron, it'll take hours to make you look any good,’ George added.
Sherlock smiled and left John to sleep. He sat down outside and leaned against the tent.
Sherlock was scribbling on a scrap of parchment. ‘I was assuming you wouldn’t want to be woken up again,’ he said, showing John the “Do not disturb” he had written on it.
‘Here we are!’ said Mr Weasley, opening the door. ‘Might be a bit of a squeeze. After you.’
Dean peeked at the fire again. 'Okay, it's clear, come on.'
Moody nodded. ‘LEAVE IT!’  he shouted.
John cleared his throat, wondering where to begin. He shuddered as the image of Voldemort flashed through his head.
‘But that… that’s NEWT standard, that is,’ he said weakly.
Hermione said sharply, drawing everyone's attention to the top table.
Dean was already there with Castiel, getting his help on his Astronomy homework.
But she disappeared. Does this mean she’s back?’
‘It’s good, isn’t it?’ Luna said happily. ‘I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin, but there wasn’t time. Anyway… good luck, Ronald!’
'Yeah, centaur politics doesn't sound like something you want to get involved in.'
‘Yeah, you will be,’ said Ron, ‘we’re seeing the Skrewts again on Monday. Okay, Tuesday,
‘I wouldn’t have believed that of him.’
'D'you know if there's going to be anything about Dumbledore in the
‘Okay,’ John nodded, sitting down next to Cas. ‘Listen, Cas, everything’s going to be all right.’
Sherlock paid for the owl treats and they made their way back up to the Leaky Cauldron.
‘Dean, stop,’ Sam complained, struggling to get the straps of the bag over his shoulders.
Cas’s eyes fell on him. ‘Wrong fireplace,’ he mumbled. He fell forward and Dean caught him, one hand pressed to his chest.
‘You need to practice.’
‘I’ll go with you, Father,’ Percy said importantly. ‘Mr Crouch will need all hands on deck, and I can give him my cauldron report in person.
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to SolangeloNeverDies and S Ketelsen for the comments!
‘Oh, then you’ll find out.’
Sherlock jumped and scanned the room, confused when he saw no one.
But Castiel said, ‘What do you mean “at one point”, Hagrid?’
Moody was looking at him very intently, with both eyes. Meanwhile, John was wracked with shivers and his bones began to ache. His eyes flicked around for a feasible means of escape. He could just leave, like Castiel had.
on the door.
Moody got to his feet, opened his desk drawer, and took out a glass jar. Three large, black spiders were scuttling around inside it. He reached inside the jar, caught one of the spiders and held it in the palm of his hand so that they could all see it. He then pointed his wand at it and muttered, ‘
Dean uneasily checked his watch, unwilling to get Cas out of bed before he was ready, but he knew Cas wouldn’t want to be late to lessons.
Firstly, he passed by Sam and Dean. Sam was pacing around Dean, reading out the notes he’d made about John, and Dean was throwing a misshapen Quaffle up and down, looking thoroughly bored. Then he moved over to the Weasleys. Most of them were outside, playing Quidditch, and he saw Mr and Mrs Weasley in their kitchen, talking and looking worried.
‘Barty!’ Bagman exclaimed.
Sherlock looked up.
to raise them?’
‘You spent too much time away from it.’
‘Forty-seven minutes precisely. Your longest so far.’
And moments later, the silver-ringleted witch had reappeared in her picture too. She sank, coughing, into her armchair and said, ‘Yes, they’ve taken him to St Mungo’s, Dumbledore… they carried him past my portrait… he looks bad…’
John made himself and Sherlock a strong cup of tea, and sat next to him, blocking him from Fred and George’s view.
‘Enough,’ John interrupted, squeezing Sherlock’s hand. ‘You’re amazing. Even if you’re “slow”, you’re still a hell of a lot quicker than most people. You’re far from useless, and you
They were all given an essay to do by Professor Flitwick, and Harry and Ron had extra homework to practice the Silencing Charm.
John repeated him as quietly as he could, and ducked behind the counter again.
‘Alfie!’ he said happily, picking the boy up. ‘You’re so big!’
He waited for a moment, then Sam’s face appeared in the mirror. His hair was sticking up on one side and he glared at Dean.
‘I can and I have. I’m giving you both a week of detentions.’
Dean waited until Cas had disappeared behind the painting and wandered back to Gryffindor Tower, whistling with a spring in his step.
‘No,’ said Harry, ‘no, okay, I know I did bits of it without help, but the point I’m trying to make is-’
‘Don’t be silly,’ she said. ‘I’m fine.’
Also, I realise that this is like the third or fourth John going off on his own tangent but I really enjoy writing him so idk, I hope you like it.
‘Who’s there?’ said Harry.
‘Are you aware,’ Umbridge said loudly, interrupting him, ‘that the Ministry classified Thestrals as “dangerous”?’
‘It’s nice to meet you,’ Cas said politely, shaking her hand.
‘You know, what his deal is.’
'There's gotta be something you like about it.'
'What are you doing?' Cas asked, holding Dean's wrist tightly.
‘What?’ he grumbled, shoving a pillow over his head.
Rita Skeeter and her photographer friend had just emerged from the Three Broomsticks.
‘Why do you even care? Surely you have better things to worry about than my feelings?’
‘I’m still sorry. Can I help you with anything?’
‘He didn’t see anything,’ John heard Sherlock say. ‘It’s all right, Cas.’
‘No, no, it’s not about the toilet, they’ve changed the time and the venue of the hearings today - the Potter boy’s one starts at eight o’clock now and it’s down in old Courtroom Ten-’
'Thank you, Headmaster,' Professor Umbridge simpered, 'for those kind words of welcome.'
Sherlock tucked the crystal ball away, and helped John get comfortable. ‘I’ll be right back,’ he said, climbing out of the fort in search of more blankets.
Sam stopped to catch his breath. 'I wanted to see if John had water visions and, well, they fell in the lake. Actually, John fell in and Sherlock jumped in to get him.'
‘Right.’ Dean stared at him for a moment, then grinned. ‘Come meet my brother, he’s just in the kitchen.’ Dean led him through the door, leaving John and Sherlock outside.
Disgust rose up in his stomach, as he looked down at the squat, toad-like face of Professor Umbridge.
So, here we are! Nearly six years in the making, and we finally made. Thanks to all of you that have stuck with me so far, and I hope you stick around! See you all again next time!
Cas gave him a sympathetic look.
‘Say something in Welsh.’
‘I live on a mountain, Dean. Cold is relative.’
John lost his battle and passed out, Sherlock and Dean catching him before he hit the ground.
‘What?’
Sherlock shook his head again. Thinking about it hurt. ‘I’m sorry,’ he said.
‘What’s happening at Hogwarts, Dad?’ said Fred at once. ‘What were they talking about?’
Dean bit his lip. ‘I guess we’re not going to the library, then.’
‘The purple one?’ Dean said, passing the potion to him.
Sherlock stayed with them for most of the evening, filling the time by practising the charms he and Cas had come up with for Dean. It proved to be a good distraction for Cas until he started to nod off.
‘Double Divination this afternoon,’ Harry groaned.
A pair of blank, white, shining eyes appeared through the gloom, followed by the skeletal body of a great, black, winged horse emerging from the darkness.
‘Maybe I fell out of your pocket when we were running?’ Hermione said anxiously.
‘Yes, it’s me,’ said Cas, lowering Alfie to the ground.
Then Harry, Dumbledore and Rita Skeeter returned.
‘That doesn’t count,’ Dean puffed, also arriving on level ground. ‘You know I hate being up early, and besides, I’m carrying more weight. I got the tent’
‘See you guys at school,’ said Gabriel, following him out.
Ron tore around the table and dived under the Cloak with Harry and Hermione.
John nodded, closing his eyes. It was easy for him now. As soon as he reached for it, the vision of the dark corridor came to him. Pitch black as always, John found himself watching Nagini slither across the floor. He shivered involuntarily, but forced himself to look at the door she was sliding towards, rather than watching her as he usually did. Now that he knew what he was looking for, he searched for a disturbance in the air, a cloud like the one that concealed Barty Crouch Jr at the World Cup. He went closer to the door, and the edges of the cloud shifted in the dark. ‘I see it,’ he muttered.
‘Hey, Sammy,’ Dean whispered.
‘What?’ Then Dean hiccupped.
‘You-Know-Who’s snake? I would say so,’ Sherlock said.
Jo?’ Dean called.
With the first Quidditch match of the season rapidly approaching, the meetings began more and more difficult to organise, as Angelina insisted on almost daily practices for the Gryffindor team.
Dumbledore seemed to notice their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, ‘The casket, then, if you please, Mr Filch.’
‘My dear Madame Maxime, if you have an alternative, I would be delighted to hear it.’
‘Not doing nothing!’ Peeves cackled, throwing another balloon at some fifth-year girls. ‘Already wet, aren’t they? Little squirts!’ He aimed another balloon at some second-years who had just arrived.
‘John, you’re rambling,’ Sherlock said.
Whitby, Kevin!’
'Don't panic,' Cas said gently. 'I have control of the broom. Try again.'
‘What’s MACUSA?’ said John.
Cas nodded, blushing.
Dean started. He’d heard the stories about Professor Quirrell, of course, but it had all seemed so distant and unconnected to him at the time. Hearing it again now that he personally knew everyone involved was like a slap in the face.
'Looks like you're taking care of everyone tonight,' said Gabriel, looking around at all the occupied beds, and chairs.
‘Okay, I think that’s it, Bobby,’ Dean called.
Cas shook his head, but there was no other choice.
Cas caught him, Dean took off his shoes, and they both lifted him onto the bed next to John. Cas then drew the curtains around them. 'If these potions work as they should, he should be able to sleep through the night. He'll recover.'
‘Screw her,’ Dean said angrily. ‘Getting better is more important than her crappy lessons.’
‘I’ve heard that you have different sorts of visions. One kind that happens on its own, and another kind that you make happen, is that right?’
John passed his over first and the wizard dropped it on a strange brass instrument that was almost like a set of scales, only it had one dish instead of two. A narrow slip of parchment came out of a slot at the base of the instrument.
‘Oh, you know that, do you?’ Dean scoffed.
‘Why would you do that?’
‘I assure you that Hagrid will be well up to the job,’ Dumbledore smiled.
‘I’m fine. Stop.’
Dean’s marks in all his lessons improved dramatically as soon as he started wearing his glasses. He could finally start focussing on the material he was reading, and even got a rare smile from Professor McGonagall. The only problem came when he was working in Defence Against the Dark Arts, and Umbridge came over to his desk.
Everyone around them began shoving each other to get out of the line of fire. Above the, Peeves the poltergeist took aim, his wide face contorted in concentration.
‘Eurgh!’ squealed Lavender Brown, jumping backwards.
Dean stopped John again on their way to lunch to ask if Cas was back yet. John shook his head no, so Dean grabbed as much food as he could carry before hurrying down to the Whomping Willow.
Ron sniggered, and Hermione tutted.
‘He does?’ Dean asked, throwing one at Harry, whose sharp Quidditch reflexes allowed him to duck just in time.
‘Greg is already out on a delivery,’ Sherlock said apologetically.
John slapped his palm to his forehead and pointed at Cas again.
‘A couple of people?’ Harry said hoarsely. ‘
‘She - She - er -’
‘Oh, no, I didn’t. Why?’
The two of them trod carefully through the house. Though John couldn’t make any noise, he couldn’t help himself. They went upstairs and a little light escaped from under a door that was ajar at the end of the hallway. Frank and John edged closer to the door and looked inside. A fire had been lit inside the grate and Frank stopped as he heard voices inside the room. His hearing aid must be working after all.
Several hands rose tentatively into the air, including Ron’s and Hermione’s.
Sherlock dropped down next to John and wrapped him in his arms, rocking him gently. 'Shh,' he whispered as John sobbed into his shoulder.
‘John.’
‘It was only a dream,’ said Ron bracingly. ‘Just a nightmare.’
Everyone at the table looked at John, who fidgeted uncomfortably. ‘Erm, yes, I suppose I am.’
‘From here?’
‘Were they okay?’ Harry asked, startled.
Dean helped him the rest of the way and sat next to the bed. 'Telekinesis, huh? That's pretty cool, but what's with the glowing?'
‘It was my fault,’ he said, curling up even further, his cheek pressed against his knee.
By Monday morning, Dean was fidgeting in his seat excitedly, running through his favourite spells in his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
'That sounds dangerous,' Cas frowned.
‘So, what did you think?’ Dean asked him.
‘There were Death Eaters in my house. They wanted to kidnap me.’
'Do what ourselves?' Harry said suspiciously.
Dean gave her an incredulous look. ‘You do see him lying in a hospital bed, right?’
‘I know.’
‘We need to know what happened. You need to see the Goblet, so we have to go in there.’
to immobilise him, without alerting the others.
Cas looked down at the table. 'I can't.’
The spell hit Dean full force and threw him into the air, spinning into one of the bookcases and falling to the floor with a thump.
Give me a little while to write a detailed timeline for Order of the Phoenix, and iron everything out, and I'll be back soon! We'll be revealing lots of secrets in the next one, especially with Castiel, so I hope you all stick around!
Cas managed a nod.
‘Maybe the cloud that was following her did it,’ John mumbled sleepily, one eye half open.
'Erm…' John blinked rapidly, grabbing hold of Dean. 'No, he isn't.'
‘You’ll have to be more specific, I’m right about a lot of things.’
‘Expecting what?’
‘Wow, I must be good,’ John teased. ‘But I really want to go, and I’d rather you were there too.’
‘You - you fought a Demon?’
‘You can do it,’ Sherlock said softly.
‘Yes,’ said Harry.
They all went back down to a very ill-tempered Mrs Weasley.
‘You know, sometimes I just want to feel like a normal human being, okay?’ he snapped. ‘It’s not life-threatening, it’ll heal on its own. Goodnight.’ He stalked off alone. Once in the common room, he remembered the Divination work he had to do, so went up to the dormitory to get his copy of
‘Sorry,’ John muttered.
‘I’ll explain once everyone’s arrived,’ Harry said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas nodded and tipped his bag to show Dean that it was almost filled with glasses. ‘I learned a few things from Gabriel.’
‘Oh. Is he your boyfriend?’ Alfie asked.
'You know I'm right. Go to sleep.'
Dumbledore considered him for a moment. ‘I’m very sorry, John, but I have to ask you to look again.’
‘Where did you get that?’ Cas said, spotting the brownie in his hand.
‘…Father actually considered sending me to Durmstrang rather than Hogwarts, you know. He knows the Headmaster, you see. Well, you know his opinion of Dumbledore – the man’s such a Mudblood-lover, and Durmstrang doesn’t admit that sort of riff-raff. But Mother didn’t like the idea of me going to school so far away. Father says Durmstrang takes a far more sensible line than Hogwarts about the Dark Arts. Durmstrang students actually
‘Well, at least the Skrewts are small,’ said Ron, as they made their way up to the castle for lunch.
‘No. He was already gone when I woke up.’
Cas’s head snapped up. ‘No, Dean, you can’t. He’ll come for me, he’ll hurt you-’ He winced and rubbed his chest, and his hand came away bloody. ‘I can’t let him hurt you.’
Fudge looked bewildered for a moment, then he suddenly seemed to understand. 'You'll be the Watson boy who thinks he's a Seer, then?'
‘Well… yeah…’
Mrs Weasley beamed at them when they entered the kitchen.
‘What is it?’ John asked.
‘Unfortunately, we are unable to substantiate
‘We would never,’ George grinned, and the two of them ran off to their room, presumably to stash the parchment somewhere.
‘Weasley… what is
White hot fury surged through both of them and Sherlock flew at their ex Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, fists aimed at his face.
know my dad?’ said Ron.
‘Yes,’ Cas said, without looking up from the book he was reading.
Harry shook his head.
‘What’s all this?’ John asked, going over to him.
'Nope, you're staying right here. You're too sick to go back up to the castle.'
‘It wasn’t your job to save him,’ she said quietly, pulling away and looking him in the face. ‘It was everyone who was in charge of that stupid tournament’s job to protect him. Dumbledore’s for hiring that nutcase in the first place.’
John scrambled away, wrapping an arm around the tree trunk. ‘I can’t. Don’t make me.’
‘A bit slow, but still the best,’ Roger Davies said with an approving nod.
‘It is not of import. Madam Pomfrey will fix it.’ Cas ended the conversation by picking up the book he had been reading on advanced human anatomy and hiding his face behind it.
‘Don’t,’ Dean said. ‘He can’t take it right now.’
Cas watched him go, waiting for the shaking in his legs to subside before he went to his lessons.
‘It’s fine,’ John shrugged. ‘I never know what’ll trigger it anyway.’
Cas’s wand flew out of his hand and Dean reached up to catch it, passing it back straight away.
The Yule Ball was announced just before the last week of term, but the only one that seemed remotely happy about it was Dean. He immediately asked Katie Bell to go with him, who agreed.
‘No reason,’ said Fred airily.
‘Then I thought that I could maybe do it about Seers.’
'It'll be good. We can talk at a normal volume here without Madam Pince tearing us a new one. I'll be right back.'
‘Hedwig, dear?’ Mrs Weasley said distractedly. ‘No…no, there hasn’t been any post at all…’ She then went into the kitchen to stop the twins and Ginny eating everything.
'Oh, I just wanted to see how you were getting on. Have any visions lately?' she asked innocently.
Melly lit a fire for them and Sherlock picked up an ornate, silver box from on top of the fireplace.
John hugged her. ‘Harriet will be upset when she finds out you gave it to me.’
‘What?’
‘You were listening?’ said Dumbledore.
'Ha ha,' Hermione said in a bored voice. 'He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he didn't, and he was in the final year of Durmstrang.'
Half an hour later, each of them had been given a complicated circular chart, and was attempting to fill in the position of the planets at the moment of their birth. John filled his in easily enough. Without the need to consult timetables or calculate any of the angles, he was finished fairly quickly.
They began walking further down the alley, but John stopped outside Magical Menagerie. ‘They’ll have owl treats in here, right?’ he said. ‘Closer than Eeylops.’
‘Another old friend. I’ve been looking forward to a chat with old Snape… come on, you…’
John groaned to himself, only realising once Sherlock was gone that he was being a touch grouchy.
Mr Weasley and Harry set off at a brisk pace, and John took a moment to catch up, stumbling slightly behind them.
The speed of the players was incredible. The Chasers were throwing the Quaffle around so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names.
‘Ginny Weasley,’ said Katie.
John didn’t need telling twice. He swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the dungeons, behind Colin.
Cas nodded and raised his wand once again. ‘
Sherlock huffed. ‘Suit yourself,’ he said, getting up and walking towards the portrait hole.
But then the flames inside the Goblet turned suddenly red, and John shuddered violently as a tongue of flame shot into the air. A charred piece of parchment fluttered out of it, which Dumbledore caught. The flames turned back to blue-white.
Molly looked sceptical. ‘You don’t know?’
Dean had also been looking around the room for Cas, so Sherlock waved him over and they went up to Gabriel together.
Harry, please just take off your Cloak for a bit. No one's going to bother you here.'
‘It’s real,’ Dean said, passing the phial to Madam Pomfrey.
'You know, I never think you're a blubbering mess.'
They spent a little time in Honeydukes, but Hermione snapped as they came out.
Hermione gave each of the DA members a fake Galleon. ‘You see the numerals around the edge of the coins?’ she said, holding one up for examination. ‘On real Galleons that’s just a serial number referring to the goblin that cast the coin. On these fake coins, though, the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting. The coins will get hot when the date changes, so if you’re carrying them in your pocket you’ll be able to feel them. We take one each, and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he’ll change the numbers on
I've had this chapter in my head for so long I'm not sure how to feel now that it's finally written. Also, fun fact, I would have been born during this chapter in 1996.
‘What rules?’ said Fred and George.
‘And helped him do it,’ murmured Moody.
‘Okay, we’re gonna start with the basic Shield Charm, and then if we have time, I’ll show you the Stunner.’
them.’
Dean picked up food from the Great Hall again and hurried up to the hospital wing. Cas was already there, sitting with his legs crossed on the furthest bed from the door, bent over a book and a piece of parchment. Before Dean reached Cas, he could tell from the tension in Cas’s shoulders and the tightness in his mouth that he was in a terrible mood.
‘Let’s just keep moving,’ Ron said nervously.
‘What’s going on with you, Cas? You can tell me, I promise.’
Cas nodded. ‘I just need some space,’ he said apologetically.
‘He is,’ Cas agreed.
'I can't, they're not
‘Yes, Professor?’ he frowned, looking up from his book.
'My sister,' Cas finished for him.
'It's not meant to be funny, Hermione. Honestly, he's the least of my concerns right now, and I'm not about to waste my energy on someone who refuses to be convinced.'
‘We’re all fine, no one got hurt,’ said Fred.
‘And it hasn’t been seen for thirteen years,’ said Mr Weasley. ‘Of course people panicked… it was almost like seeing You-Know-Who back again.’
Everyone else came in and crammed into the living room, except Hermione, who went to make Mrs Weasley a strong cup of tea. Mr Weasley insisted on adding a shot of firewhiskey to it. Bill then handed Mr Weasley the newspaper, which he scanned with Percy looking over his shoulder.
‘What’s going on?’ Dean asked, sitting on the sofa with Cas.
Dean blinked in surprise. ‘I - I guess.’
Sam pouted and folded his arms.
Harry nodded and addressed the room. ‘Well, we’ve been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and - er - what, Hermione?’ he said, noticing Hermione’s hand in the air.
‘Right,’ said Harry, crumpling up his first attempt and lobbing it over the heads of a group of chattering first-years into the fire. ‘Okay… on Monday,
Sherlock said incredulously. ‘You never cease to amaze me.’
Cas nodded, and Gabriel lowered his hands. Gabriel then gestured over to Dean, who squeezed through the crowd over to them. ‘Dean’s here now, and he’s going to help you.’
‘Did you-?’
Cas smiled. ‘All right.’
Umbridge did not follow Professor McGonagall around as she had Trelawney; perhaps she realised Professor McGonagall would not permit it. She did, however, take many more notes while sitting in her corner, and when Professor McGonagall finally told them all to pack away, she rose with a grim expression on her face.
Cas nodded, but fear was clear on his face.
But the door opened, and Dumbledore came sweeping up the ward.
‘Er, yeah.’
‘Not really, but I recognised some of the sigils. Demons use them sometimes, to leave threats and stuff.’
‘I don’t know, I just touched it and…’
'The hospital wing. I'm just getting some Murtlap essence for Harry, I have a feeling he'll need it.'
‘Thanks,’ Dean said, getting to his feet.
Mr Weasley then came back in with his robes on the right way round and dragging a comb through his hair. ‘Have a good term, everyone,’ he said, throwing a cloak over his shoulders. ‘Molly, are you going to be all right getting everyone to King’s Cross?’
‘What’s that supposed to mean?’ Sherlock said thornily.
John smirked and looked over at Fred and George, whose identical dumbstruck expressions turned into pure glee.
‘I bet some of them put it in last night after we’d all gone to bed,’ said Harry. ‘I would’ve if it was me.’
Dean sat with him until he fell asleep, then carefully got up, laying a blanket over him. A wave of fury washed over Dean as he noticed Cas holding his own hand in his sleep, the one that had been cut open by Umbridge's Black Quill.
‘Thank you,’ Cas gasped. He swallowed all of it, and his expression smoothed as soon as he’d finished it.
‘This is the dilemma we’ve been stuck in for a while now.’
‘Yes, it’s me. I’m here.’
‘You tripped,’ she repeated coolly.
‘Where’s Crookshanks?’ John asked Hermione.
Ron shrugged.
John rubbed his temples. 'I think he's… In France? Maybe? He's too far away for me to see.’
‘Summon it,’ said Sherlock.
‘I’m really good at impressions,’ said Dean, narrowing his eyes.
‘I don’t think so,’ said another wizard, who came forward, revealing himself as Mr Diggory. ‘Our Stunners went right through those trees. There’s a good chance we got them.’
Then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the table and a scroll of parchment fell with a thud onto it, accompanied by a golden phoenix feather.
'I know you do, but you're so smart you could make any potion you want. We just have to get you more comfortable with the actual making part. We'll do the ones you like first and get a good base to work from.'
‘You will milk her before we retire, Wormtail. I will need feeding in the night. The journey has tired me greatly.’
'Do not speak to me about that woman!' cried Trelawney, leaping to her feet, her beads rattling. 'Kindly continue with your work!'
‘Doesn’t mean I don’t have to do the homework,’ John pointed out.
John snapped back to himself, light-headed and laughing giddily. He waited for the spinning to stop, then climbed to his feet and made his way up to the Owlery, where Sherlock was waiting for him.
Welcome back everyone! Thanks to Because_We_Match and hhhelcat for the comments!
‘You don’t have to-’
champion out of action! I smell double-dealing and corruption in this whole affair, and you, Dumbledore, you, with your talk of closer international wizarding links, of rebuilding old ties, of forgetting old differences - here’s what I think of
‘We’d better go,’ Sherlock said, after a few minutes of silence. ‘Have you packed everything?’
‘I’m okay.’
‘Please keep your voice down,’ Cas said, looking around anxiously. ‘I understand, Dean, but I just can’t miss any more. Not until she stops watching me. I’m a prefect, I’m supposed to set a good example, not skip classes whenever I feel like it.’
‘Do you?’ Harry said quietly.
‘Yeah, thanks,’ said John, taking back his hand. He left with Harry and Ron, trying to ignore both the fluttering sensation in his stomach and the tingling where Sherlock’s skin had met his.
‘Of course I do,’ Hermione said at once. ‘But more than that, I want to be properly trained in defence because… because…’ she took a great breath and finished, ‘because Lord Voldemort is back.’

A headache formed behind Dean’s eyes as his focus was split between his parchment in front of him and Cas behind him, and everything was blurry by the time Umbridge finally allowed them to leave.
Dean sunk down on the end of his bed, but nervously bounced his legs. ‘I have a bad feeling,’ he said defensively, ‘and so do they.’ He pointed at John and Sherlock, who were both already sound asleep.
'How could he leave me like this?' Cas snapped off another branch and hurled it at the Forest treeline. 'It's not fair.' Cas suddenly stormed towards the Forest and Dean chased after him.
John chuckled. ‘You hated Divination. You should go to Herbology.’
Madam Pomfrey had cleaned the sheets and dressed Cas’s wounds, though they were already bleeding through the bandages, and she had adjusted the bed so Cas was resting upright. She pulled a screen around them as soon as Dean had sat down, arranged some potions on the table beside him and lit a candle.
‘Fine, maybe I do miss you,’ he muttered, to the sound of laughter in his head. ‘Shut up, you’re making me look mental. Yes, ha ha, I look mental already, you’re hilarious.’ He leaned back against the brick wall he had sat in front of, and watched the clouds until they started to form shapes. He didn’t know what they meant, and he didn’t bother trying to interpret them. Instead, he just watched until the sun touched the horizon and he finally decided to go home.
