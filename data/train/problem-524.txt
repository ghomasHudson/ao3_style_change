“John, I can tell you are very committed to this; you are clearly a capable person.  The changes you need to make in order to be able to manage your anger are relatively small ones but they will have a huge impact on your life.  You can do this.”
“Sherlock, John and I are having a little bet.  I think that Peter Sutcliffe was born in 1942 but John is absolutely sure it was 1948. Can you clear it up for us?”
I move through the haze that has become my life.  He moves to pull the blankets up over me.  I stop him with a firm grip on his wrist.  I can’t handle being covered up, not past the waist.  Not since I couldn’t get free of the blankets.
He hangs up without another word.  I turn my full attention back to Sherlock.  His eyes have started to drift shut again; he doesn’t look at all well.  His colour is terrible.  I take his vitals again.  Nothing is too far outside the norm, but he is deteriorating.  Just minutes ago, he was sitting up and japing about where I had put my iPad and now, he is struggling to stay conscious.  He has even stopped supporting his injured arm, and he is clearly in a lot of pain.
I haven’t spoken about the details of what happened to me in Serbia.  I know that if I tell him what I cannot face, the implications of what I was subjected to will be clear to him.
“My partner, he told me, I don’t think it is fair to go into details, but he recently told me that he has been through something really terrible.  It’s done him a lot of damage.  I think that has been weighing on me too.”  My voice shakes as I say this.
I don’t know why she is bothering really; they haven’t got much in the way of definitive answers from him.
“Did you get a chance to see the sun today?”  She asks.  “It was so nice to have a day that wasn’t dreary.”
“You need to stay away while this works itself out.”  I say flatly.  “Don’t bring Rosie here either.  Or even better go and stay with Sholto.  His place is as private as they come.  There is always the chance that they will connect you with me.  It has happened too many times.”
“That was bloody amazing.”  I tell him.  Even after all this time; the creativity of the Holmes brothers is startling.  I kick myself for not thinking of a better way to assess Sherlock.
“Would you like some water?”  John asks me.  I had not noticed him there by my side, but I am comforted by his presence.
John comes back, he takes my shirt off and wipes me clean with a warm cloth.  Then hold me tight against his chest while I lose my mind in swathes of guilt and shame that don’t belong to this moment.
“I asked him to bring Rosie in.  That’s my little girl; she was crying. I don’t think he heard me, I’m not sure, I think he was distracted or maybe he was just being obtuse, he does that sometimes.  I ended up shouting.  I dropped a mug and it broke.  It was an accident.  It wouldn’t have been a big deal, but he got a fright.  A bad fright… I think he thought I was going to hit him.  He totally shut down.  I can’t do that to him again.”  I sigh, knowing that I am not explaining any of this right”
“I’ve been thinking about all the things that were said.  I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it all.  How I said that I needed to work out the feelings that I have… about you.  Well, I umm… I do care about you.  In fact, I care very much.  Probably more than it is normal to care for a friend.”
I think he is already asleep but when I climb under the covers next to him, he says, “Tomorrow night just come up here, don’t wait until the middle of the night.”
What the hell.  It’s probably a case.  If I read it, maybe we can ponder over it during dinner.  It will be nice to have something to talk about that is a bit lighter.
Rosie has jam on her face when I pop back in to relieve Mrs Hudson from childcare duties.  She is a saint, that woman.
If you are over at HolmesCon 2020 this weekend, say hello and thank you to Sandra.  Without her this story would never have happened, both because she prompted me to write it and because without her it would have been an unreadable mess.
You'll have to wait for next week for the next chapter though (and it's a doozy).  No amount of begging will make it happen sooner.
“He is, he keeps unsociable hours, has no concept of privacy, has no verbal filter.  He lives at a million kilometres an hour or doesn’t get off the sofa for days.  Living with him is madness.”
About a week after John moves back in, I am staring at the crystals I have set up under my microscope when he says something to me.  The crystals are from a new formula I have been trying out; sodium magnesium oxalato aluminate.  They should come out perfectly clear and neatly geometric but the formula is twitchy and so far, I am not having much success.  John says something else, I must filter it into background noise, because I don’t process what he says.  None of us slept well last night.  Rosie had been cranky all day yesterday and she woke up in the night with a fever.  This seems to add to the tension that has been slowly building for days.  Something is bothering John; something I cannot quiet recognise.
“However you react, it’s fine.  We can stop any time.  Just don’t wait so long before you ask me to stop, tell me as soon as you are uncomfortable.”
Of course, we have kept the rooms at Baker Street; it is far too valuable to have access to convenient lodging in London.  Plus, it will be perfect for Rosie next year.  She has plans to study medicine at UCL next year, it should only take her a few minutes to walk there from Baker Street.  I have a strong suspicion that rather than following in John’s footsteps, she will pursue Molly’s.  She has been like a surrogate mother to Rosie since the earliest days after Mary’s death.  Now they are even closer still, acting more like best friends than mother and daughter.  It is not unusual for Molly to travel out here so that they can spend hours shopping or going out to movies together.  Inevitably, they end up back at the cottage for dinner.  Usually, bringing with them a ridiculous dessert of some sort or another.
I shake my head, but he grips my wrist and gives it a threatening tug.  It seems I will end up in the bath either way.
I understand then, the depth of the feelings that Sherlock has held for a very long time.  I am shocked that he killed a man for me and my wife, I always have been.  There have been few moments in my life that were more shocking than watching Sherlock shoot Magnussen in cold blood.  That heart freezing moment will stay with me forever, but I am even more shocked to learn that he did that when he did not even think it was worth it to dish out this same treatment to someone who has made his life an absolute misery.
“Come on, tell me what your name is?”  The doctor says more firmly at the same time he leans and uses a trapezius squeeze.  Standard practice to get a patient’s attention.  It is such a simple act, not truly painful, just a way to cause a little discomfort, enough to get a simple reaction but Sherlock’s reaction is not simple at all.  His eyes shoot open and look wildly around.  He is trying to push himself further up the bed, flailing and kicking, pushing the blankets away.  His left arm moves weakly but he is still moving it far more than he should considering that the joint was reduced only a few hours before.
“Sherlock,” I call out, “you know what will happen if you get pneumonia again.  Don’t make me go through that.  Don’t make Rosie go through that.  Not again.”
“During the day there were two of them, sometimes others too, but mainly the same two guys.  They took turns to ask the questions.  Real amateurs, but they knew enough about causing pain.  It was easy at first to keep my identity from them.  I lied, and I avoided, and I antagonised them.  That was stupid.
I smile back.  The water is already edging towards the top of the old deep claw foot tub that Sherlock insisted on getting installed.  He makes no move to turn it off.  Leaving it for me to do.  Would he have left it to run down the stairs if I hadn’t come in?
But as time passes the thrill of solving cases diminishes.  Criminals become boring as their inability to do anything at all original seems to increase exponentially with every year.  The cases I would have once classed as a seven or even an eight, now fail to raise my heart rate.  Private clients still provide occasional thrills and Mycroft sends me something titillating every now and again.  Like that little exercise in America that ate up two years of our time, but mostly I am not as enthralled by the work as I used to be.
or does it all sound rubbish and you really want to read something else.  I don't really do prompts, but you never know where inspiration will strike.  Inspire me you clever souls.
“You don’t even charge for most of them.”  I scoff.  I get up and pull my dressing gown on.  The floor is freezing against my feet.
“Really?”  I ask surprised.  No so much surprised that he has plenty of money as surprised that he thinks of it as mine too.  But, not for the first time, I wonder just how much money he really does have hidden away.
“That is pretty much the entire database.  I cannot get all that to you tonight.”  Lestrade tells me.  “Come in early tomorrow and we will go through it all.  Ok?”
Now, I've been tinkering about in the background with a bunch of other stories.  There must be more than twenty unfinished works in my Sherlock file.  To help me get inspired to finish some I thought I'd ask what you want to read next (or at some time down the track)?
While I'm tapping away here, I'd like to thank the little crew of readers who are supporting this story so strongly.  I love your comments and I love that you are here each week.  You help make this all the more fun for me.  Kudos to you lovelies.
I take his hand and direct it to the little indentation below my collar bone.  His warm fingers manipulate the dimpled scar.
“What things would we avoid then,” he asks, haltingly, “if we to ever, you know, um, I don’t know, fool around?”
I stand at the table and look down at the cover of the book with the cartoon boy and the train.  Hesitation warns me.  Warns me to walk away, to stop this madness.
He strides out of the laundry stark naked.  Thin and lithe as ever.  He quirks as eyebrow at me as I stare.
“She started it.”  He tells me like a petulant child.  By the time Rosie gets to this phase I should be an expert.  Or I’ll have two of them to deal with.  I sigh and inject the anaesthetic into his brow as gently as I can.
I turn to shove the plate in front of him.  He is flipping through the paperwork that I deposited on the table as I come in.
“I haven’t been with anyone since Mary.”  He confesses.  “I’m an idiot; when I was with her, I was nearly tempted to step outside our marriage and, now that she is gone, I feel like I would be betraying her more somehow.”
I get Rosie ready for day care in a haze of despair.  The only thing about today that is going well is that she seems to be feeling better.  Although if she was still off colour, I would have a decent excuse to skip work.  I don’t really want to go in today, but I know I have to.  I had purchased the clinic with the money that Mary left to me.  It is an investment so that Rosie will be financially supported, no matter what.  Because it is mine, I can take off as much time as I need.  Also, because it is mine, I rarely take time off.  The sense of responsibility towards my patients means I turn up even when I really don’t want to.
I crane my neck to see through the front window of our little cottage and I am treated to a glimpse of Sherlock coming down the path in the crisp morning light.  I have been waiting for him to come home, waiting all night.
I had been with Lestrade all day and we visited seemingly every taxi company in Greater London.  None of the employees had schedules that matched up with his attacks.
I know that the days are dragging because I am worried about Sherlock.  This has been hard on him.  The concussion has caused him to be in a state of unnatural confusion and that confusion seems to have plagued him with anxiety.  I’ve seen him agitated in the past but never for so long.  It was usually a fleeting emotion, not a consistent state.
He runs his left hand along my right arm, the one closest to where he kneels beside me.  I tense at the soft touch.
I go to shut the album knowing there will be nothing else inside.  I pause.  One of the photos is missing.  In the space that the envelope took up.  It is the one with the deer and the rifle.  I shudder but I shake off the feeling as I snap the album shut.
I am startled by a nervous little rapping at my door.  I close my eyes for a moment, try to centre myself, before calling out, “What?”
“Not yet.  The doctors want to keep you in overnight to keep an eye on you.  You were a bit confused earlier.”
I pause to consider this.  “I don’t know really, I guess being ignored.  That is what set me off yesterday.”
I lay down in the soft blue glow that fills my room.  I watch the jellyfish as they drift around their tank in the soft luminescence that keeps me from losing my mind.  I do my best to look like I am asleep
I can hear John talking but he sounds far away, and the words don’t have any meaning.  I will my brain to come back online.  Then John is gone.  I roll on my side, still shivering, and curl up in a ball.
The next night he does not bother to come down, he just rings my phone and when I answer he mumbles, “come up.”
The bathroom door is wide open, so I don’t bother to knock.  I just announce myself by calling ‘tea’ loudly over the sound of the running water.  As a rule, I try not to creep up on him.
“The water, they, did they?”  He pauses to collect himself.  “Waterboarding, is that what they did to you?”
“It doesn’t matter who started it; I heard what you said, and it was uncalled for.  Stay out of other people’s relationships.”
“Well, it’s not like we had any leads; he is a ghost.  A year and a half and even I have nothing to go on.”
“Oh, no.  I just didn’t make a habit of it.  Too many messy emotions.”  I say.  “Since then, I haven’t felt… inclined.”
“Yeah, forensics were done there last night.”  He reaches into his pocket and takes a business card out of his wallet.  He hands it to me.  “Give them a call, they are the crowd we use for the messy jobs.”
The resulting lesions on his lungs mean another bout of pneumonia could be deadly.  His lungs are ruined.  The things that happened in Serbia, Mary’s handy work, years of drug use have all combined to equate to some pretty serious health implications.  It is fair to say that I worry.
“I knew something they didn’t; it was my last desperate attempt at a reprieve.  I knew who he was, the guy with the car battery.  Who he really was.  A double agent; I had seen his file on Mycroft’s desk once.  It took me a long time to put it together, to remember why he was familiar, too long.  I told them.  They killed him.  Dumped his body somewhere.  That’s how Mycroft found me.  He is hopeless in the field; you saw what he is like at Sherrinford.  I had to do half the work to get us out.  Then he expected me to thank him for it later.  He was there, undercover, for almost twenty-nine hours before we could escape.  He watched them beat me, he chose the tools they would use on me, twice.  He knew what was happening at night.  He knew from the first glance.  He waited, stuck to the plan.  He needed to, I know that, but it was my lowest moment.  That was the only time I felt truly broken.  Knowing that he knew and did nothing.”
“You’re lucky she missed your eye.”  I tell Sherlock, referring to where Constable Jane Boden’s engagement ring has gouged out a deep furrow just above his eyebrow.
It had taken weeks of antibiotics and pleural drains and he had still come away a shadow of what he had been before.  He’d coughed so much he had broken two ribs, he had lost ten kilos and he had barely been able to stand up without assistance.  It was like watching a skeleton mope around Baker Street.
I can’t be sure because I am already drifting back to sleep, but I think he presses his lips to my forehead before he leaves.
“No, no, I won’t, I can’t let anything like that ever happen again.”  Especially after what he has told me about Serbia.  “I don’t even want to shout again.  I want to do better.  I feel awful about it.  That’s why I’m here.”
“I thought that was my job.”  He is standing now, the newspaper fluttering to the floor.  He is angry because he feels left out.  I look up at him from my chair.  I realise that I have hurt him, but I don’t know a way back from here.
When I come into the cottage just after sunrise the next morning shivering and coughing, John is furious and berates me for my foolishness.
“Enhanced interrogation techniques.”  John says slowly.  “That’s the bullshit term the Americans used for the shit that went down at Guantanamo.”
“You know as well as I do, what the cost of taking a life is.  You know how it can stay with you forever.  He was not worthy of that action.”
Sherlock reaches out across the chasm between us and takes my hand.  “Stop thinking.  I need to sleep.”
“Do you think that, in the future, maybe, you might like our relationship to be a physical one?”  He asks me with a clumsily formality that tell of his rehearsing this.
I consider looking at the letter, turning it over in my hands.  Sherlock will be back soon.  He was booked in for a check-up this morning and he planned to catch Greg afterwards to give the statement he had been putting off.
Here is a short one to make up for the rotten little cliffhanger I sprung on you.  I was just pausing to change perspective.
Except I do.  It is too close to home.  The whole case makes me uncomfortable.  The things that happened to me in the shithole military base in Serbia have changed my perspective.  Even after all this time I cannot work sexual assault cases objectively.
I have to sit down for a few minutes to quiet my mind.  Just pack some things, that is all I need to do right now.  Rosie’s things first, they are more important.  Clothing and nappies and toys and the little jars of mushy vegetables that smell like farts when you take the lid off, all go into the nappy bag that Mary bought because she liked the giraffe on the front.
“Yeah, I know, but we need you right now.  Bring the cavalry.  He came here.  The Ambush Murderer.  I killed him.  Sherlock is hurt.  An ambulance is on the way.”  My voice is steady, but I know the news I am delivering is shocking.
“Hello, John, is that you?”  Clara asks me in a bemused voice.  I can’t call Harry; we are hardly talking at the best of times.  Clara has always been kind and level-headed.
“Ok good, I’ll send you a phone number.  They do good work there; I send a lot of my rehab patients to them, the ones with anger issues.  Call them John.  Do what they say, commit to it.  He sounds like he is worth it.”
While John is still bathing Rosie; I slip in to brush my teeth.  He is using the suds in her hair to give her a mohawk, while Rosie tries to turn her rubber ducky into a submarine.  They are both absorbed in chattering in a dialect I neither speak nor recognise.
Someone grabs my wrist.  I try to fight.  I see them inject more drugs.  I fight that too.  I’m not allowed to sleep.  I know that much.  I force my eyes open.  Bad
I go slowly back down the corridor to Sherlock’s cubicle.  He is waiting for a room to become available and until then we are stuck in a holding pattern in the emergency department.
When he is happy with the arrangement he starts talking.  I expect him to lower his voice.  To talk in a soft tone, the way most people do in hospital settings, but he sounds just as he normally does.
My breathing is a bit more controlled by the time the doctor comes in.  She is young and has two cats and a girlfriend she doesn’t get to see much because she works too many nights.
“There was a lot that led up to it.  It was pretty soon after my wife had died, I was, I was grieving, I guess, and I blamed him for what happened.  I hadn’t seen him for months; I needed the space.  Then he just barged back into my life and dragged me into his chaos.  He was high, not at all himself, he attacked someone else, I intervened.  I took it too far.  I know I did, but I had to stop him.”
“This is different, Mycroft.  He is scared.  Irrational.  I am worried he will hurt himself.  They are talking about putting him in restraints.”
John promises to come back in the morning.  Hesitating at the door as if he means to say something, but he just says goodbye and smiles.
“Yeah,” it hurts to admit this, “we have.  He is not an easy person to get along with, he is even less easy to live with.  We have known each other for ages.  I recently moved back in after living apart for a few of years.”
“It is hoped that the addition of the consultant, who was presumed dead between the years of 2012 and 2014 after sensationally faking his own death, will assist the police force in tracking down the person or persons responsible for the three home invasions over the past year and a half that have left seven people dead and one seriously injured.”
“Who?  Which one?”  I can hear anger in John’s voice.  He hates the people who hurt me as much as I do, maybe more.  It is still raw for him.
“Not all that much.  It is just release.  I find it hard to stay in the moment, especially since...”  I admit, hot with the embarrassment of these revelations.
She scoffs a little laugh.  “Um, I just knew, I guess.  Why, John?  What’s going on?  Having a sexuality crisis?”
“Let’s walk down to the sea before he comes,” he suggests, as if we don’t walk there every afternoon.
It is so natural in that moment to lean in and kiss him.  The kiss is soft and warm and slow.  For a moment everything is all right.  I want this to last.
“You a nurse or something?”  The young one asks me.  His naivety is somehow endearing, and I am almost embarrassed as I tell him that I am a doctor.
“Do you always think about me all night?”  His voice is as teasing as the light touches that circle my slit.
“She wouldn’t think that.”  I say, leaving the cliché ‘she’d want you to be happy,’ unsaid, knowing it would sound too cheesy.
“Explain exactly what happened last night.”  Mycroft instructs me when I stop swearing.  He doesn’t give me a chance to ask any questions and going by the look he gives me, I suspect he will decline to answer them anyway.
His hand moves more quickly, the rhythm just right and the water ripples and splashes around his grip.
“Not if you don’t finish telling me what is so important to you.”  I can feel his grin against my neck.  He knows full well the way he is tormenting me.
“You get my point, though, right?  It’s not all about genitals; no one loves someone just for their bits.  If you love him, it doesn’t matter what equipment he has.  You’ll figure it out in the bedroom.  I’m sure you have practiced with a dick and balls before, you’ll be fine.”
As much as the injuries have taken their toll and as traumatic as the night-time attack had been, I get the feeling that these are not the sole causes of the distress.  Not even the primary cause.  Increasingly it seems that they are just the catalyst.
Horrified, I step away from John, from the fridge.  I lean forward to cough; I gag once before I can pull myself together.
They go through to process of initial assessment, trying to get Sherlock to respond to them.  I am concerned to see his consciousness slipping further.  He still responds but he is increasingly confused and combative, trying to clumsily knock their hands away as they try to fit an oxygen mask and administer pain relief.
“Let’s assume that he doesn’t have a serious head injury for a moment.  What would the ideal response look like?”
“All of it.”  I admit.  I wasn’t planning on getting into this, but it all just spills out.  “It’s complicated but we have known each other for a long time, and we have just decided to try to make a go of things.  It hasn’t been easy.  Yesterday I got mad; he thought I was going to hit him…  He thought that, because I have done it before.”
Rosie comes tearing back in with a book in her hands.  She plonks down in my lap and says “read” in a clear demanding voice.  So, I read out loud from the Wonky Donkey as John takes the stitches out and we share his beer.  I feel his fingertips linger on my scalp.  I know that they have found a scar that is not new.  He moves on silently to the next set of stiches.
He stops when he sees the letter and the photograph in my hands.  Without a word snatches it from my hand and calmly folds it back into the envelope and puts it back where I found it.  I flinch as he stabs the knife savagely back through it.
I turn to the article about his assailant.  I know that he will roll his eyes at the headline that pronounces in capital letters – HOLMES SAFE, and I am not disappointed.  I carry on with the article anyway, “Consulting Detective Mister Sherlock Holmes was injured in a violent home invasion late last night.  Holmes, who has recently been working to solve the Ambush Murders, has been admitted at a prominent London Hospital after receiving head injuries during an incident at his Baker Street address.  He is expected to make a full recovery.  Another man at the scene is believed to be deceased.  New Scotland Yard have declined to comment on the incident, stating that it is part of an ongoing investigation.”
The best years are the ones after I talk John into selling his practice.  Well, he advertised it, and I bought it.  Not that he knew that at the time.  I was a good choice, it provides us a modest income and if he ever grows tired of being my blogger, he can go back to it.
“Seriously?  After all that?”  He says almost mockingly, but he takes my hand and stops me from stepping away.  “I won’t be able to sleep if you sit there watching me.”
“Sleep a few hours.  Greg is coming for dinner, I’m sure we will all end up sitting up late.  Get some rest.”
I very rarely dream about what happened there.  Even when the wounds were still fresh and I could hardly sleep a wink, it wasn’t dreams that kept me awake.  It was just that I was systematically, and cruelly trained to stay awake.  It was simply a physical reaction to the act of falling asleep, every time I started to drop off my eyes would leap open and my heart would beat a
I have hardly slept for days, a week nearly, just dozing occasionally while I wait for him.  All his attacks have occurred after one am, he breaks in during the day, hides himself and then attacks once everyone is sound asleep.  There is no reason he will break that tradition if he comes here.  Plus, I am sure that I will notice the signs of his being here if he was here.  He might have been able to hide from them, but he won’t find it so easy if he comes here.
His room looks nothing like the rest of the house, it never has.  The furniture is all relics from when he used to live here.  Nothing changed when he moved out and it was spared from most of the damage when the patience bomb detonated.  The only change is that now there is a fresh coat of paint on the walls to cover the water and smoke damage.  Plus, a cot and an armchair have been moved in.  Things for Rosie for when they both stay here.  It is all simple and modern.  He isn’t materialistic.  Army life, I guess.  Ready to leave it all behind at a moment’s notice.  I wonder if he wants to leave; if this is getting to much for him?
John pauses, eyebrows scrunched, then ploughs on.  “It’s just you’ve been a bit distant and I was…  I was just… I thought you might be avoiding me after our conversation the other night.  You weren’t put off by that?”
I take the syringe from between his fingers.  To my relief he lets it go without any resistance.  I let out a breath as I take it with me to the bathroom.  The contents I squirt down the drain, the needle goes into my sharps container.
“I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t have pushed you.”  I say, although the word sorry is too feeble.  I stagger back to sit on the chair, on the edge.  My legs feel weak.  I grab the towel off the floor and wipe my own face.  The water leaves pink spots on the towel.
I put my palm against his cheek.  He leans into it and raises his head at the same time.  I have never seen him so dejected.
All in all, I really didn’t want to go into work today.  All day I have been distracted.  There is nothing special about today, so I’m not sure why it is bothering me so much.  I have repeatedly told myself that he is an adult, a very intelligent one at that, and that he will be fine.  Mrs Hudson will have checked on him regularly, just like she has been doing every day.  Yet, I just cannot shake off the concern.
I feel his chuckle against my back more than I hear it.  Slow feather light touches speed up my breathing.  The water feels hotter, but I know it’s my temperature that has changed.  I run my hand along the outer expanse of his long thighs, encouraging, coaxing, teasing.
“I’ll be fine here tonight.  I’m not going to sleep anyway.  I have some composing to do.”  I know it sounds like a dismissal.  John does too.  He leaves without a word.  I hear the front door slam.  I hear him swear loudly from the street.
“John, I was wondering when you would call.  The red flag for his admission notice came in six and a half hours ago.”  Mycroft answers his phone with the usual sneer in his voice.  “How is my dear brother?”
He is too smart to fall for my hopeless apologies, but I try to ring him on the way to work.  I need to explain, to apologise again, a hundred times over.  He ignores my calls.
I lay back on the pillows as John traces over the pitted and raised sections of skin.  I cannot tell him they were earned on one of the worst days of my life.  He would ask what the others were and I cannot bear to tell him that he featured in all of them.
I am surprised when she turns up with two other cleaners in tow.  A bald man with only two front teeth, who looks like one of Sherlock’s Irregulars and a young guy that looks like a college professor.  I had assumed that they would give me a quote and leave, only to return tomorrow if I was very lucky.  I had half expected that they would decline the job, leaving me to try to sort it out.  I had visions of trying to clean the roof with a mop and bucket.  Thankfully, they save me from that task and begin at once.
He woke up screaming an hour later.  He wouldn’t talk to me about it, but instead of telling me to sod off like I expected him to; he let me sit up with him on the couch.  We sat in silence until the shaking died down to intermittent tremors.  Eventually, the sleeping pill and the exhaustion caused him to sag down until he fell asleep with his head against my shoulder.  I wrapped a blanket around him and let him drool on my shirt until shards of morning light pierced through the drapes neither of us ever bother to close.  He woke up suddenly and self-consciously and excused himself to the bathroom.
“This is not the right answer.”  My voice sounds tight and I stop myself.  My instinct is to shout, to shake him, to tell him how stupid this is.  To remind him of where this ridiculous habit has led him in the past.  But he looks so desperate.  I start again.  I try to keep my voice as soft as I can.  “You can talk to me.  Tell me what’s going on?  Is this about the other night?  There is more to it, isn’t there?”
I nod again, smiling.  I need him to lead, to take the initiative, I can’t do it.  I am too locked up in my fear of my past and apprehension about the moment to do much more than be guided through this.
Settling back, I watch his silhouette through the stained-glass windows in the front door.  He leans on his cane to unlace his boots.  Bending down causes him to start coughing so taking his shoes off takes longer than it otherwise would.  He places them on the edge of the step where the sun will shine on them once it comes all the way up.  Turning back, he opens the door slowly and quietly, slipping his thin frame through the smallest gap.  He must not realise I’m waiting for him in the sitting room.  He must think I’m in bed asleep.  He thinks that he has gotten away with his all-night escapade in the fields.  Not very often, but sometimes he is wrong.
It isn’t Doc that comes though.  I am starting to realise that I must be mistaken.  My back doesn’t hurt, and I can remember Mary.  That came after Serbia, right?
“Open his eyes spontaneously or at lease on command, answering simple questions like what day of the week it is, and perform a simple motor task such as squeezing a hand.
I return to him balancing a glass of water, his pain medication, and the sleeping pills I picked up at lunchtime.  He needs to rest.  I had anticipated the exhaustion and after the debacle the other night with the Nytol, I took it upon myself to fill a prescription for Zolpidem.  I’m hoping that is can him enough that he can get a good night’s rest.
This chapter has fought me all the way.  Hence, it being later than usual.  Don't blame my beta for any mistakes, I just finished rewriting the bulk of it, so she hasn't seen most of it.  Please let me know when you spot the inevitable pesky mistakes.
“Listen to this, you made the headline.  Sherlock Holmes joins the hunt for London’s Most Wanted.”  John reads aloud from the paper the moment he notices me enter.  “Controversial Consulting Detective, Mister Sherlock Holmes was yesterday confirmed to be working in conjunction with long-time colleague Detective Inspector Gregory Lestrade of New Scotland Yard on the Ambush Murders.  The investigative team have so far failed to find any solid leads on the identity of the person responsible for the series of violent home invasions in and around central London.  The murderer in these incidents takes considerable amounts of small valuables.  London residents are being warned to keep valuables out of sight and to lock them up where possible.”
He absently runs his fingers in circles on my waist.  It feels nice.  I want more.  But I feel so self-conscious.  I’m so sick of being a coward though.
It was at that point that she had punched him in the face.  Greg had dragged her away and I had pushed Sherlock out of the room.
“It hasn’t been easy.”  I admit.  Janette lets that hang in the air.  I know she is waiting to see if I have more to say.  I’ve done this before though, between past therapy and living with Sherlock, I know how to sit in silence.
“So, you lived together in the past, but the relationship is new, is that right?”  Janette asks.  I can see that she is baffled by my life.  Why wouldn’t she be, I’m baffled by it most of the time.
Slowly, I fold the photo back into the letter and slide the letter back into the envelope.  I stand automatically, take the letter to the mantelpiece, and drive my knife through the centre of it.
“Umm.”  I say.  Then realised I’m not exactly sure.  I look around feebly for clues.  “Not much.  Mrs. Hudson made scones.”
“I don’t know exactly.  I went there to grab my iPad and heard a commotion.  I went into Sherlock’s room and this guy was sitting on him and throttling him.  He was trying to bash his head in with one of those heavy security torches.”  I suddenly feel shaken by the whole ordeal.
I follow him; of course, I do.  I always follow him.  But only once the kettle has boiled.  I take a cup for myself too.  Who knows what chaos he is creating up there?
“Good to see you’re keeping up John.  We need to take a different approach.  Explain the test to me.”
It has gone on too long.  It is getting harder to look at the victims.  I have never struggled with that in the past but now, these ones, they are getting to me.  The victims of the crimes I investigate have always just been clues, problems to solve.  These ones are different; I know their brand of pain.  I know their brand of anguish.  I know their brand of fear and I don’t want to look at it anymore.  That is why I decided to try the newspapers; to make a subtle suggestion to him that I might be a suitable next victim.  I hate it.  I fear it.  I have danced around it for months and yet here I am waiting for him.
Natural light wakes me next time.  It is pleasant to sleep this late.  I almost never do.  John is still beside me.  Must be Sunday.  He only sleeps late on Sundays; so conventional in his habits.
I never come in here, with the exception of the occasional snoop in the early days, just after we moved in here.  Stepping through the doorway feels like entering another dimension.  It doesn’t feel like part of Baker Street.  It doesn’t feel like part of my life.  It feels peaceful.
He indulges me and my body pumps pre come in response.  Both his hands pump my cock of three or four divine strokes, root to tip.
Giving the statement takes hours.  Every detail is poured over time and time again.  My back aches from sitting in the same position on the same hard chair.  I am buzzing from too much instant coffee and not enough sleep.  My eyes sting from the harsh fluorescent lights.
His curls, still raven dark everywhere but at the temples, are damp with dew.  So are his boots.  His cheeks are flushed with the morning cold and his breath causes bursts of cloudy condensation.
He ignores me haughtily for a few moments and I settle deeper into a chair and shake out the morning paper.  It is only a few moments before boredom gets the better of him.
“I’m not sure.  I don’t know how I will react.  I want us to but... last time…”  What remains unsaid is how I had pushed him away and sat naked on the edge of the bed having a minor panic attack.
I should just leave it, but in the world of Sherlock Holmes privacy and ownership are elastic concepts.
It has been awkward as we both feel our way through our own personal challenges.  I know John struggles with the challenges of navigating a male body rather than a female one and everything that that means.  I can tell it still makes him feel a little strange.  I struggle with the tendrils of guilt and shame that intertwine with sexual arousal.  If anything, they get even worse in the wake of sexual climax.  Something I suspect will continue to haunt me for a long time to come.  John is patient and considerate; always puts the breaks on whenever I need a moment and I never feel any pressure from him to do more than I am comfortable with.  If anything, he slows me down when I push too hard the boundaries that I wish I did not have.
Perspective will shift back a forth between Sherlock and John.  I'll always let you know who in the chapter title.
“Oh god, I know how bad this is going to sound.” I said with my heart in my gut.  “The last one; I put him in hospital.  Can I explain a bit?”
He climbs over the playpen rail and sits down beside me on Rosie’s blanket, close enough that our shoulders touch, close enough that I can smell coffee on his breath.  He brushes the blonde hair back from Rosie’s forehead.  She doesn’t even stir.
While I wait for my body to sort out its internal dramas my thoughts wonder to John.  How is he coping with the things I told him?  It was a lot to take it.
“She said ‘the little one is quite good looking; I’d have a crack at him myself if he wasn’t so busy bumming the freak.’  Even Donovan had the respect to look guilty.”  He voice is bitter and flat as he tells me.
“Brother mine.  It’s Mycroft.  You are in the hospital.  You are going to be just fine.  You really should look at this though.  It’s the most singular piece of anatomy I have ever seen.”  He has a photo on the screen of his phone.  I don’t see it, but I can only imagine how strange it must be to gain that level of the Holmes’ attention.  “It has been newly documented out of North Korea.  Very hush hush.”
It is then that I realise that John has held an aura of tension these past few days.  I had been so caught up in my own revelations and with feeling discombobulated that I had not stopped to notice.  There is something that he needs to say.  I know that with instant clarity.
Of course, he asks a question rather than giving an explanation.  “Is Sherlock usually combative, under normal circumstances?”
“I’m going to have a bit of a lie down, don’t bother with the tea.”  There, that should keep her away a while.  I need a moment.
I shake my head.  I feel defeated.  Before I even check my phone.  I know I will see the sent message there, yet I have no recollection of sending it.
“Nope, a nursing home, with nothing for company but cheap nurses and a photo album to remind him of his hateful father.”  He stops suddenly, as if has said more than he intended.
John pats me on the shoulder to signal that he is finished, and I tip my head back to look up to him.
“You sure?  There was something important you had to say.”  He teases, but he doesn’t stop the blissful movements this time.
Each time I have to choke down fear to tell her that I am 42 years old, and that the chief of police is Stephan Williams, and that it is September 2019.  Or some such rubbish.  I am suspicious of these questions.  They are very specific.  Who has worded them up, why are they not asking standard things; like my name and what day of the week it is and who is the sodding prime minister?  This has Mycroft written all over it.  Or am I being paranoid?
John does the only natural thing and the worst possible thing he could have done.  He uses the towel to wipe the water from my face.
For the past three days, as soon as John gets home, I force him to check the stitches on my head.  I am dying to have a proper shower.  To wash my hair.  Each day he tells me not just yet, maybe tomorrow.
I flinch when John waves his hand in front of my face.  How long has he been here?  Had he noticed how unhinged I am.  I blink at him and for a moment I wonder if he is real.
We are almost the same height when we are sitting down.  He reaches over to me, his hand on the back of my neck, his thumb brushing the back of my ear.  His movements are slow and careful, and I try hard not to tense up.  I look to him and see the worry and doubt in his eyes.
“I know but it is practically an invitation when they print it like that.”  John says with more than a hint of frustration.
“While I was away.  When you thought I was dead.”  God no, why does everything come back to that God-awful time?
Frustration burns like a bad itch.  I am getting better at controlling it now, channelling it and not letting it overcome me, but Jesus, Sherlock tests me some days.  Part of controlling it is not letting it build up.  So, I blurt out, “you could try to be a bit nicer to the new ones, if Greg ever retires, they will be the ones we are stuck working with.”
I hardly slept thinking about the things that might have happened to him.  Sherlock is one of the bravest, stubbornest, most composed people I have ever met.  What had he been subjected to that caused him to lose it like that, years later?  When had it happened?  Why had he never mentioned it?  How long was he held for?  My mind whirls through all the possible things that could have happened for the hundredth time.  All the obvious things come to mind.  All the stuff we were told about in the army; food, water, and sleep deprivation.  Is it even possible to deprive Sherlock of those things, he doesn’t seem to need them?  Did they use stress positions?  Did they hood him?  He’d hate that, I’m sure.  Taking away his ability to
“Thank you, John.”  He says with a sincerity that is unusual to him.  “You have helped me to understand what is going on here?”
I didn’t see what had led up to the incident, but I did see it happen.  I had left to use the loo and I came back into the main office area at the yard to hear Sherlock destroying Jane with his familiar deductive tone.
“It’s been a long time since someone touched me without... violence.”  I say as I lay back down on my stomach.
“Bloody hell.”  John says as he comes at me with the blanket snatches off the back of the couch.  “Your teeth are chattering.”
“You were right, was a mess.”  John tells me, his voice sounds hollow as it bounces around the sink.  “They really should have washed it for you at the hospital.”
can’t move.  Scared.  Of what?  Where are they taking me?  Where is John?  Dizzy.  Spinning.  I wish they’d stop.
I flip open the cover.  I cringe as the spine creaks, but lightning doesn’t shoot from the pages; rocks don’t fall from the sky.  The photos look exactly the same as I remember them.  It’s almost disappointing how mundane it feels to look down at them.
“Greg, hi.  Sorry, I know its late, um early.”  I say into the phone.  “We are going to need you at Baker Street.”
One day, around the time I unpack the last of my boxes Sherlock asks if he can come along.  We walk the streets and parks of London and he points out all the things that I don’t notice.  It is like the first days of our friendship again.  I feel the wonder and awe in his abilities in a way that I had almost forgotten.  This becomes our daily habit and it has become my favourite part of the day.
“I’m not sure.”  I say.  It’s evasive, but not untrue.  I don’t know where to begin.  I roll so that my back is to him.  He shuffles closer to me.  I don’t really enjoy his chest being pressed against my back, not because it is him, but because of the last time someone was that close, but even in the dim light I don’t want him to see my face.  I don’t want to see his; I don’t want to see disappointment there.  Or the disgust, when I say more.
Just like we do on most afternoons, we take a walk down to the ocean.  On weekends and school holidays Rosie brings Silver Blaze out and they pop over the stone walls as John and I walk hand in hand along the farm tracks that lead to the beach.
I take one of the best showers of my life while John puts Rosie to bed; he has shifted her to my room since it is closer to both the kitchen and the loo, and since I have appropriated a space in his room.  I wash my hair twice.  It feels wonderfully good to have clean hair again and to be free from the itchy stitches.
Then he stops again.  Hand one hand still around me, the other playfully trying to keep my hips from jerking up.  “I really feel like you have more to say.  I don’t think you are expressing yourself to your fullest capacity.
He watches me so carefully, waiting for me to break down.  His scrutiny is almost too much.  I pull him down by his open shirt and he bends to kiss me.  Our cocks brush against one another for the first time.  Soft skin over hard heat.  I roll my hips.  The movement involuntary.  “I’m alright.”
Today we are alone though.  The wind is strong and the sky a steel grey and it is threatening to rain by the time we reach the rise, where we can stand catching our breath from the walk.
“Just nipped out to the bank.”  I brush past her and up the stairs.  My head is pounding.  The letter feels like a lead weight in my coat pocket.  My shoulder is complaining that I went out without the support of the sling.
“They got impatient and when they ran out of ideas, they got an expert.  He brought in a car battery and some electrical cables.  I have never known pain like that.  I thought I would die.  It was too much.  I had to tell them something.  Something to make them stop.  Just a bit of information.  That’s the balance.  Tell them enough to stay alive.  Not so much that you are no longer valuable.
I turn his hand over slowly and gently.  I’m aware that his shoulder must still be sore.  I see the marks on his arm.  Six or eight of them, where he has dug under the skin, trying to get a useful vein.  His hand is cold.  The tubing has been on for too long.
He sounds frustrated when he replies.  “When exactly?  When you were trying to cope with your wife’s secrets?  Or when I was assigned to a suicide mission?  Or when you had a newborn?  Or when I got Mary killed?  When I drugged myself up to the eyeballs?  Or, when my homicidal sister resurfaced to terrorise us?  There was never a good time.”
I don’t open my eyes when he runs the water back to temperature, I concentrate on breathing slowly.  John uses the mug to carefully rinse out the soap.
He is in the doorway when I speak.  I don’t know why I start.  I don’t know how I make myself start, after weeks and months and years of not wanting to and not knowing how to.  It just happens.
“Yes, that is a very recent development.  We were just friends before that.  We just shared an apartment.  There has always been a chemistry between us, but I never considered that I might be interested in another man, and he was always adamant that he didn’t do relationships.  Basically, we both thought the other wasn’t interested.  He was injured recently, I moved back in to help out, it has turned into a permanent arrangement.”  I can feel my skin prickle with heat as I talk.  Janette just nods as if this is the most normal thing she has ever heard.  She must hear some messed-up stuff if this all seems normal to her.
My palms are sweating as I wait for her to answer.  I realise that we haven’t spoken since she came to visit me in the hospital after I got back from Afghanistan.  It is really not fair on her to ask this of her, not after all this time.
“Yes, I think about it every day.”  He says, and any anger he had seemed to be harbouring slips away and is replaced by a look of deep sadness.
“You should try going home to your fiancé at night rather than staying at the Radisson.  Radisson is expensive, isn’t it?  That’s ok though, your chubby lawyer friend pays for it, doesn’t he?  Met him on a case is my guess.  How long until hubby finds out?  Before or after the big day?”  Sherlock had been snarling at her as I walked into the room.
But is it the same kind of love?  That is the question that has been grating at me for weeks.  If I’m honest, maybe longer, maybe months, maybe even of years.  And that right there is the thing.  The thing I cannot seem to get my head around.
“I don’t know, Sherlock.  You’re still a complete mystery to me.”  John says, then realising that I haven’t really grasped what he is driving at he continues.  “Do you like it though?”
“Bloody hell.”  I mutter as I grab the blanket off the back of the couch and wrap it around him.  “Your teeth are chattering.  You need to be careful, Sherlock.  Being out in the cold for so long is not a good idea.  The lesions.”
“Oh,” he sighs, realising his mistake, then continues almost flippantly, “apparently, I don’t remember, but it would hardly surprise me if I did.  The thought of coming home to you was the only thing keeping me going.”
For three nights I lay in bed waiting for him to come.  It is the same each night.  I make sure the lights are off and the drapes are drawn and that I am tucked up in bed like all the good boring people of London.  I want to get up and tinker with the experiment in the kitchen.  I don’t really need to do anything to keep the crystals growing.  I’m just bored with waiting, but I know if he is going to come after me, it has to look convincing, so I lay in bed waiting, with boredom grating against my nerves.
In some ways, I feel like this is the chapter I needed to write the most.  I hope I have done the themes in it justice.
“Who cares?”  He mumbles, and it occurs to me that even without a head injury he might not actually know.  It’s not the kind of thing he keeps track of.
“Let’s get this off.”  I undo the slip knot and try to massage the circulation back into his arm.  He doesn’t respond at all.
More footsteps are followed by the sound of the door shutting quietly.  To my relief a very real John comes and wraps a woollen blanket around my shoulders.  He sits down beside me, and I extend the blanket so that he can wrap it around himself too.
I am glad for the distractions; They stop me from thinking about everything from the last twenty-four hours.  I just want him safely back at home again, but for now and not the first time I am glad that I know Sherlock’s credit card details.
I quickly Google the date of birth of the Yorkshire Ripper, I very much doubt Sherlock is wrong, but it is still some relief when Wikipedia tells me that he is bang on with his information.
John reaches up to the shelf above the sink and fumbles the mug he had been reaching for.  He moves fast to try to catch it as if falls.  He has good reflexes; that is one of the things that make him so valuable to work with, but the movement catches me off guard and I flinch away.  The mug shatters across the floor.  More facets than my pointless crystals.
Looking out at the sea.  Watching the foaming white waves roll in.  With the cold wind in my face and John’s hand warm within my own.  This is where I am at my most content.  Knowing that all the sacrifices I have made are all worth it.  I am able to recognise the gifts I have been given.  So many second chances.  The chance to watch Rosie blossom into a strong capable young lady.  So many thrilling chases.  So many good friends.  But the biggest, grandest gift of all is that I am loved by the man that I love more than anything in this world.
His vitals are stable and normal.  There is no elevation in his heart rate that would indicate that he is still in a great deal of pain.  The discomfort seems to be mostly mental.  To be honest that worries me more than the physical problems.  Those I understand, those I know how to fix.
He recoils like he has been struck.  Then he just looks at me blinking rapidly.  Then his gaze clears, and his gaze scans me, registering that I have a bag for him.
I lay there staring at the roof, contemplating whether the kiss means there has been a change in gears in our relationship, when John climbs into his side of the bed.  He rolls towards me and slowly places his hand on my chest.  He is careful when he touches me, and I appreciate it.  I think we are both scared.  Scared of what it means, of how it could go wrong, of how I might react.  I wonder if he can feel my heart rate quicken.
The letter with the knife through it catches my eye.  It wasn’t there the other day and it was not among any of the other mail I have brought up.  Sherlock doesn’t bring the mail up.  The writing on the front of the envelope is messy, just Sherlock’s name and no address.  I wonder how it came to be here.
“Even this is… confronting.”  I gesture to indicate our position, causing him to withdraw instantly, leaving just his hand on my side.  The cold air between us feels worse than his presence did, but I cannot tell him since I just sent him away.  I scrunch my eyes closed and continue as best I can.  “Wet kisses and all the sounds and smells associated with sex are triggers.  There is so much I don’t remember clearly that there might be other things that I don’t handle well.  I’m really not sure if I’ll handle anything well.”
I snort a disgusted laugh.  “I don’t actually know.  Imagine that, me not knowing.  It was more than two weeks, less than a month, I think.”
He puts his hand around us both and moves slowly.  Squeezing and rubbing at all the right moments, places.  His hips thrust in time with his hand.  I put one hand on each of his hips.  And I push up into his grip.  His hand moves faster.  The slide is slick with pre come and sweat.
“Nar.  Too early.  I’m going back to sleep.”  He dismisses me with a wave of his arm, and I dismiss the idea of quitting just as easily.  But it drifts back to me throughout the day.  With every patient who wants a medical certificate to explain a work absence because their boss is too much of a prick to take their word for it, or because they got drunk last night, I am more bored.  That has me drifting in the imagination of a better life.  One where I don’t have to get up to the same droll routine.  I wonder again just how much money Sherlock has stashed away.  It would be nice to spend more time with Rosie and less time with paperwork and rosters and inventories and haemorrhoids.
She helps me realise when I begin to feel angry and she helps me work out strategies for dealing with that anger.  Slowly I find that one of my old favourites works best.  When I start to feel the tension in my jaw, I do the breathing exercises.  If that doesn’t work and the tightness in my shoulders starts, I take a walk.  Sometimes alone, sometimes with Rosie.
I cannot help but to smile a little as I ask playfully, “just quite, is that all?  Not very good looking or incredibly good looking or…”
“Again, I just need to ask.  This is not an accusation.  Do you ever worry that you might harm your daughter?”
“I was going to the loo, just needed a bit of a sit down on the way.  Got dizzy.”  I confess, embarrassed by this revelation.
“I love you.”  He breathes into my ear as he works me through the paroxysm of ecstasy, prolonging it.
Maybe I need to know that it is real, unlike the spacey quality of the dreams and flashbacks.  Maybe I need to know he is real and that, and unlike my dreams, he was beatable, and that he really is gone from this world.  Maybe I need to remember that his life was hard.  Maybe I’m just a masochist.
“By the time the guy with the car battery came for a second time, I couldn’t take anymore.  I was so worn down by it all.  I was sleep deprived, injured, hurting all over, dehydrated, starving, I had pneumonia.  I was desperate.  I was scared.
“I don’t... I can’t...” the false starts irritate me, so I rush to get the words out.  “I won’t be able to perform fellatio, and anal penetration is out of the question.  I will struggle with any hand contact on my cock, even my own is too much sometimes.  No soft touches, almost anywhere.  He liked to pretend it was consensual by being gentle, even though he was excited by me being chained up.
John and I are happy and content here.  We still bicker sometimes.  During our most mild winter to date, I spend a night watching the hives.  A small number of Acherontia Atropos have finally come to our hives to steal some honey from the bees.  I had planted a whole field of potatoes in hope of encouraging them to reproduce here.  The five beautifully marked individuals that flutter into and out of hive number four are enough to keep me riveted in place all night.  I jot notes in my book about their exact descriptions, how frequently they come and go, how long they spend inside the hive and what time they leave.
I ring the City Therapy Rooms and make an appointment for a session with an anger management counsellor.  A cancellation means there is an appointment available this evening.
All night these questions and concerns scrolled through my head and despite the hours I involuntarily committed to it, I have gained not a single answer.  All those sleepless hours have just allowed me to collate a list of worries that seem to be hellbent on pointlessly repeating through my brain.
“They don’t have anything to do with Hannibal, or that movie.  It was stupid anyway; in the book it was Erebus odora pupae.  They only changed it in the movie to be flashy.  Dumb.  You should have seen them, John.  They are the perfect burglars.  It is the perfect crime.  They release pheromones so that they are undetectable, the bees had no idea.  They can steal all the honey they like.  They are magnificent.”
“Yeah, I did actually.”  I reply as she leads me into her office.  “I took my tea break outside this morning.  It was hardly bright enough for a suntan but much better than last week.  I thought it would never stop raining.”
He props himself up on an elbow.  Looks at me seriously.  When he speaks, I hear self-doubt and fear and a tinge of cheeky hope.  “Do you want me to, you know?”
The other EMT, a woman, is clearly the more experienced of the two.  She looks over to where Sherlock is slumped on the ground just past the end of the bed.  She snaps her fingers twice before her partner follows her over to us.  I immediately recognise her as someone who has seen some shit in her life.  It is her that I direct the handover to.
How will work out though?  How can it possibly work out?  I have no idea what I am doing.  I have no idea how to be in love with another person after Mary, and I especially have no idea how to be in love with another guy.  I have no idea how to raise a child.  I have no idea how to raise a child alone, or in a relationship.  I have no idea how to redesign my identity.   I have no idea how to look after someone who has faced the kinds of trauma that Sherlock has.  I have no idea how to be with him, but worst of all I have no idea how to be without him.
It is almost lunchtime when I wake again.  I am surprised to have slept so long.  I feel a bit better for it.
Another fit of laughter makes me pause again.  At least the anaesthetic has really kicked in by the time I am composed enough to work.  Sherlock allows me to concentrate, lying back and shutting his eyes.  I don’t want him to have any more scars so I take my time and do the finest stitches I can manage.
He fiddles with the control panel on the bed and it sits me up.  My muscles complain at the movement.  He holds a plastic water bottle to my lips; my hand covers his to control the amount of water.
I sit.  The chair will put me at an awkward angle and the back will make it hard for me to lean back over the sink.  I turn the chair sideways so I can get a bit closer.
Over the next few weeks, I discuss everything with Janette.  My inability to process anger and hurt, Mary’s death, her lies and betrayal, the difficulties of raising Rosie without her, Harry’s drinking, my premature and forced discharge from the army, Sherlock’s lies and the grief they caused me, what happened to him and how I can support him, and the big one; our relationship.  And everything that comes with it, but mostly my inhibitions.  Despite the rumours and innuendos of nearly everybody, I really did think that I was immune to Sherlock’s charm, based on nothing more than his gender.  How wrong I was.  It is good to discuss it with someone impartial, Janette listens without judgement and helps me to sort through my emotions.  She helps me to realise that love is often not convenient.  She helps me to find the courage I need to admit to myself that I need to let go of some of my preconceived ideas about who and what I am.  She helps me admit that I need to stop thinking so much and let myself feel things; allow myself to feel hurt and scared and sad and abandoned and let down.
“Not reluctant, just checking.  You know?  After everything you have told me tonight, I don’t want to make you feel uncomfortable.”  I’m not sure if my denial of reluctance is entirely truthful.
The psychologist calls out to me in the waiting room.  She is a small woman with curly brown hair.  She introduces herself as Janette.
Jesus, did he really need to say that.  I rub my face as the lift takes me down to the lobby, hoping that this all just goes away.
All in all, it doesn’t take long for us to decide to move.  We had never told Janine about our change in relationship status; not a deliberate oversite, she had just slipped out of our lives after Mary had passed away.  I had not even known she was ill.  I certainly hadn’t known that I was included in her final will.  But I suspect she would have been pleased to know that John and Rosie come with me when I move in.
“I just need to know that she is safe.”  Janette says, “I have to ask this too, were you ever violent with your wife?”
Sherlock comes into the kitchen as I am microwaving the second plate.  He slumps down at the table with a groan.
So much has been said tonight, so much has not been said.  Questions swirl in my mind.  How long was he held there for?  How did he survive that?  How did I not know?  Are the people who did that to him still out there?  I want to ask it all, but the moment had past, and I am too afraid.
“Are you still insisting on keeping your front door unlocked?  I saw another article in the paper today.  If he is reading that tripe you are feeding them, you are surely asking for trouble.”
“Caught in the act.”  He chuckles softly, before becoming fully animated.  Practically bouncing as he tells me about the stupid moths.  “They came.  There were five of them at the hive by the creek.  The one sheltered under the big tree.  Perfect specimens.  Large and bright.  Two males and three females from what I could tell.  I could hear them squeak.”
By the time natural light comes through my window I am exhausted, uncomfortable, and irritable.  I don’t know why after all these years the things that happened are back to haunt me.  I had dealt with that shit.  Buried it.
I didn’t sleep well last night.  I cannot stop thinking about it.  I thought I was past reliving every moment from that hell hole in Serbia, but I’m not.  It is all back again with a few additional interruptions.  This time, when I dream about being waterboarded it is blood they are pouring over my face.  It’s Magnussen that has the stapler and the car battery.  It is not Claire’s death I am trying to avenge, but Mary’s.  It is John who sits there and watches while they beat me, while Rimac rapes me.
“It is a standard Glasgow Coma Scale.  There is a basic scale for eye response, motor response and verbal response.  Each is marked, depending on the level of response.  Basically, all he needs to do is stay calm long enough for the doctors to assess whether and how well he can follow the basic instructions.  At the moment it is impossible to tell whether the problem is neurological.”
John opens the door slowly and comes in; he is wearing his pyjamas.  He hasn’t put on his dressing gown.  It’s cold, he must have rushed.  I must have yelled out in my sleep.  Embarrassing.  I don’t remember the dream, not properly, but I know it was about the Nightman.  Oh god, I must have called out for John.
I am laughing outright now, and I have to put down the suture kit.  “How could you possibly know that?”
I idea stirs something akin to arousal within me, but arousal sit too closely to shame and fear to have any of the positive appeal it once might have held.  Pausing, I contemplate the best ways to say what I am thinking.
“Nope.  No screens, you need to rest.  I have a toothbrush and some pyjamas and a change of clothing for when you get discharged.”
By the end of the next week the surgery has a healthy offer made on it.  By Christmas it is all settled, and I am free to spend my days as I please with Rosie and Sherlock.
“It’s ok.  It doesn’t matter, it’s ok if we never do anything.”  He says, clearly alarmed at my list of limits, then he continues hesitantly.  “I shouldn’t have asked.”
He leads me into the kitchen and pulls a chair up to the sink.  The legs scrape on the floor and I wince at the sound.
“We will get it all cleared up, but we are going to need a statement from Sherlock too.  When he is well enough, of course.”
After a monotonous half day at work, I pick up Rosie and we stop by our place to pick up a few more things.  She is grizzles as put her in her playpen; holding her little arms up, wanting me to pick her up again.  I suspect that she is both grumpy and tired after a morning session at day care.  I distract her with my iPad.  The upbeat music and songs I reluctantly know all the words to form an odd soundtrack as I race around throwing things in a bag.  I am impatient to get back to Baker Street.  It seems that I don’t want to be away from there for even a moment.  The offer to move back in permanently came as a welcome relief but in a fashion that is so typically Sherlock.  He did not seem concerned with any of the details.  Just brushing it off when I asked how much the rent would be, and where Rosie should sleep and how we would child proof the rooms and if I should sell my place.
Bright lights in my eyes.  Some cruel bastard holding my eyelids open.  Hands shoving at me.  Moving me.  Taking my clothing.  What do they want from me?  Why
Then there are the other questions that I don’t know the answers to.  What is going on between us?  Do I love him?  In what way?  Do I want a relationship with him?  Is it even possible?  Would he allow it, participate in it?
“Hello Sherlock, it’s late, this better be good.”  He sounds tired.  I glance at the clock.  It is after eleven.
I am surprised to see it is a bit after six when John come in juggling Rosie, a nappy bag and a package of fish and chips.  I hadn’t realised it was so late.
I don’t let either win.  I simply pick my way out of the room, stepping between the broken shards of ceramic mug.
I am so hard it almost hurts.  My hips twitch in time with his touch.  He runs his tongue along the back of my ear.  My breath is sporadic and ragged.  His strokes long and fluid, but light, so light, almost too light.
I think back.  “Talking to Lestrade.  He told me it was too late to get the files I wanted.  I went to bed.  I must have fallen asleep waiting for…  Oh.”
“I hate those fuckers.”  He mutters under his breath.  He hasn’t connected that he is one of the ones who has hurt me.
I can hear John in the kitchen, muttering and sweeping up.  Rosie snuggles closer to me.  I count the freckles on her cheeks.
I pause, immediately aware of my extreme over reaction.  John to his credit, just stays where I have put him.  I gulp air.  A wave of exhaustion sweeps over me.  I lean my head forward until it is resting between his shoulder blades.
“Oh, good.”  John sounds relieved, then surprised at himself.  “No, not good; actually, I think you should go in and get checked out again.  Just to be sure.
I try, I really do; it’s boring but it’s not even the boredom that gets to me.  Whenever it has a chance my mind wonders to places that I really don’t want it to go.
“At night one of them… he would sit beside the light.  Every time I nodded off, he would shuffle across to me and slap me in the face.  I learned not to fall asleep, I learned to snap awake if I started to fade.
“Careful, you need to be more…”  I lose my train of thought as he pulses his hand around me.  My stuttering echoes around the bathroom walls.
I am surprised how secure I feel beneath him as if under the protection of a weighted blanket.  He works his pants down too.  His cock springs free and bobs up against his belly.  He gently guides my hand towards him.  He groans as I cup his balls, rolling them.  Emboldened by my own arousal.
John comes back in with the shampoo and a towel.  I tip my head back over the sink as best I can.  The cupboard above has nothing to hold my attention, but I try to focus on it.
I get home around eight.  It has been a long day and I feel completely rung out.  Sherlock is asleep on the couch.  I have never seen him sleep so much; the concussion is still healing.  I know from experience how tired it can make you feel.  I slept for a month when I got brained playing rugby in the under sixteens.  I’m so emotionally exhausted I feel like I could sleep for a month now.
“I’m telling you now.”  I roll my eyes.  “I was going to ring you when I got home, warn you to stay away.  I was planning to be home earlier, the flight got delayed.  Terrible weather.”
“I couldn’t tell them who I was.  That would have put you in danger.  And Greg and Mrs Hudson.  Molly too if they figured that part out.
I answer his questions and by the time he is satisfied my eyelids are drooping.  I am unbelievably tired.
Sherlock, predictability, is not able to resist.  He’s eyelids flutter a few times, then he blinks as if to clear his eyes.  Finally, he squints at the phone that Mycroft holds close to his face.  He can’t keep his eyes on it for more than a moment before his eyelids fall closed again.
Eventually the questions come to an end and I am allowed to leave, something I had begun to doubt would ever happen about halfway through the interview.
“Ok, ok, give me a sec.”  I flick forward to the next page and start reading about a service station hold up.  He seems less bothered about what I read after that.  After a few articles I shuffle through the paper to find the sports section, more as a joke than anything, I know he hates it when I read that out.  When he doesn’t protest to my reading a section on the upcoming Friday night grudge match, I glance up and I’m not surprised to find that he is asleep.  I fold the paper quietly and leave it on the edge of his bed, where he can reach it.
“I might just put her in the tub.”  John suggests as Rosie wins the battle to escape and runs on wobbly legs towards the kitchen.   He throws the baby wipes into my lap and says “you might want to take care of that” as he gestures towards the side of my face with a grin.
“He is going to hate me for telling you this.”  Mycroft pauses for a few seconds as if he is still making up his mind.  Or trying to find the right words.  Neither is characteristic of him.  His speech is proceeded by a small shrug, as if he has reconciled the anger that Sherlock will bring down upon him.  “Sherlock was once subjected to questioning under duress, I suspect that this is bringing back some unhappy memories.”
I get dressed and go out.  I don’t really know what draws me to there, but I go to the bank, to the safety deposit box that holds the musty photo album that tells the sick, miserable story of the Rimac family.  I have not opened it.  Not since the day I sat on the stained carpet in Rimac’s house.  When the mailman delivered it to Baker Street straight from the nursing home where Jovan Rimac took his own life, I brought it here to the safety deposit box.  I never even took it upstairs.  I could not let its presence infect my home.
For a man who asks for help with every meaningless task in his life - fetch my phone, get me a pen, grab some milk while you’re out, bring home some soil from the corner of Wild and Keeley, can you order dinner, and so on and so on, he never really asks for anything, certainly never for any form of comfort or support.  There is no way I could refuse him now.
Despite all the cameras and checks he died in his cell without anyone noticing for over half an hour.
“Sell it.  Sell it so we can sleep in every day and take all the cases we want.”  Sherlock says into the pillow.
Heed the tags on this chapter and if you feel that something may be triggering please make safe choices.  However, if you have followed this series so far, you should be fine with this one.
“Well no,” I admit, “but we all know that this isn’t about the thefts, and, more importantly, if he thinks that I am after him, he might come here.”
“Half seven,” he tells me, then realising I would have no idea which one, he continues.  “in the evening.”
“Hang on, you need to hear this.”  He says, before reading on.  “A source close to Holmes claims that he has already made progress on the case, a surprising revelation as Holmes has not been seen outside of his Baker Street residence since agreeing to take on the case yesterday.”
He pauses for a few moments and I almost turn around.  I want to go to him, but I don’t want to break the spell.  I wait, wondering if he will say more.  Time stretches on.  I should have moved sooner, now I have waited too long.  Then, to my relief, he starts speaking again.
John turns to leave.  I roll onto my side to watch him go.  He flicks off the light switch by the door.  Only the light from Rosie’s night light illuminates the room in a soft glow.
“It was the man that kept me awake every night.” Sherlock continues as I go through a massive internal crisis.  “I don’t remember it.  I wasn’t even conscious of it happening.  But I knew when I woke up.
“I’m not against it, exactly, but there are so many awful memories, they are so close to the surface.  I don’t know what…”  My voice trails off.
As an afterthought I fold up Rosie’s playpen and take that too.  At least we can confine her until we child proof the stairs and the kitchen laboratory.
It's a whopper by my standards and I probably should have chopped it in half, but you, my beautiful souls, deserve it in full as thanks for your patience.
I try not to thrust into his touch.  My legs shaking with the effort.  My fingers gripping his flesh.  The twist of his slick wet hand wrings a spasm from me.  It has only taken moments but, I’m so close to the edge.  I want this to last.
It is while we are walking that I realise that I want to spend the rest of my life with Sherlock trying to make up for the time we have lost and the hurt we have caused each other.
“How did you know you were gay?” I ask in a rush.  It must sound blunt.  I wince at my own insensitivity.  Calling out of the blue to ask something so personal is a dick act, but I have no one else to ask.
There have been too many times when I had entered the room to find him staring into space.  Not in that mind palace way of his.  I know because when he notices me watching him, he becomes self-conscious in ways he never has in the past.  He isn’t sleeping well either; I hear him pacing sometimes and I the light from the sitting room invades the staircase beyond my door.  He looks exhausted.  Two nights ago, I gave in to my instincts and went downstairs; I gave him a lecture on the importance of sleep for post-concussion healing and a Nytol.
I can’t though, it is too dangerous to answer.  I know what it will cost.  Not just my life but Mrs. Hudson’s
His skin feels warm against my fingertips.  I fight to keep myself in the moment.  His hand pushes up my t-shirt as he traces ribs and scars with a delicate touch.  I feel a pleasant ripple beneath my skin.  My cock yearns to be touched in a way I thought it had forgotten.
Now it is back every time I shut my eyes, every time I hear a noise, every time I try to fall asleep or when I wake up.  It’s in every thought.
John is putting the groceries away as I make a lap around the kitchen table making aeroplane noises as Rosie squeals with delight.  I see a smile sneak onto John’s face.  I am still making laps when he slumps down into a chair with a beer in hand.  He looks worn out.
“Yes, well, how often do I have to tell you not to make a judgement without all the information?”  He scolds, but there is an undertone of amusement in his voice now.
When my hand stills on his shoulder, I notice him staring at the scar on my chest.  He reaches out and his finger brush along the length of it.
Greg steps in the door, saving me from thinking about it further.  He looks rumpled as he surveys the room with tired eyes.
“You deserve better.  Both of you.  I’m going to do better.”  He nods once to himself.  The decision is made.  I know his apology is genuine.  I know that once he sets his mind to something, he will follow it through.  We both know it takes more than a decision but that it is also where things begin.
“Don’t stop.”  I moan.  My rapid breathing makes the water undulate and I can feel it along my entire body.
Mycroft continues.  He manages to sound almost conversational.  “Who was the first victim that died?”
It’s a fumble of limbs and angles and swearing and laughter but soon I am reclining between his stupidly long legs with my head rested back on his shoulder.  Bubbles spill over onto the floor.
“You ungrateful sod.”  I hiss, as he reaches out for it anyway.  “I was hoping you’d take a nap.  I thought tea might be a better idea.”
My concerns prove to have some foundation when I see him.  He is in his chair, but he is a picture of absolute dejection.  He is bent forward at the waist.  Forearms across his thighs.  Head bowed.  His hair, more unruly than ever for its neglect while the stiches hold his scalp together, is obscuring his face.  It is the piece of rubber tubing tied above his left elbow that gives me pause.
“Yes, I do.  I saw it.  The moment you thought I would hit you,” John pauses as if he is struggling with something, “again.  It tore my heart out.  I deserve that though.  I have no right to your trust.  Not after the morgue… after everything I’ve done.  I’m so sorry, Sherlock.”
Out in the street again I am glad for fresh air.  I dial the number on the card and arrange to meet Linda, the gruff sounding head cleaner, at Baker Street in half an hour.
His earlier foolishness still grates at me and won’t let me relax fully.  Watching him struggle for every breath when he got ill two years ago had been hard on all of us.  It wasn’t long after we got back from working a huge case in America.  He had run himself ragged for months to close that case.  He had slept for most of the flight home, then fallen asleep on the couch almost immediately after we arrived.  I went to the store to grab some groceries and when I returned home, I found him collapsed on the kitchen floor.
I roll over to face him.  He undoes the buttons on his night shirt and pushes the fabric aside.  Even after all these years I have never seen it.  He is always fastidious about keeping himself covered.  I had expected a little puck mark like the one on my chest, but my eyes are drawn to a jagged scar splayed like the open petals of a red lily.  Exit wound, high velocity, large calibre.  A surgical scar runs the length of his lumpy clavicle.
Sherlock sinks down in his chair.  Rosie is still calling to him and waving her arms to get his attention.  Sherlock doesn’t notice.  He is looking into the empty fireplace.
“Sometimes it’s just the usual bickering that people do, um, sometimes he can be quite inconsiderate of other people’s feelings.  He has lied to me, we fought about that.”  I can’t talk about how Mary died right now.
The envelope is light, business sized, smells musty.  I pocket it.  There is no way in hell I’m opening it here.  I have my suspicions about what it holds and none of them are things I want to deal with in public.
“I know I pushed you away after the trouble with Euros; told you to stay in your own place.  When I told you that it was because I couldn’t deal with Rosie screaming at night.”  He pauses and, in that pause, all the anger that I had felt when he had rejected the idea of me moving back in swirls around me.  Until he continues and then all that anger is blown away and replaced with heartbreak.  “It was a lie.  It was really that I didn’t want you to deal with me screaming at night.  I was embarrassed, I didn’t want you to find out about any of this.  I was going to take it all to my grave.  Now that you know, I would like you to move back in, properly, permanently, if you want to.”
“You need to make sure you take care of your health.”  I gasp as he runs a single fingertip up my inner thigh and directly over my balls.  “Staying out all night is not taking care of yourself.  You didn’t even rug up.  You didn’t even, oh god, you didn’t even tell me where you were.”
“Morning, Sherlock.”  I call out from the doorway.  I don’t want to startle him, not after how agitated he was yesterday and especially not after Mycroft’s revelation.
The surprise of the heat and pressure of his palm along my clothed cock make me arch my back.  I accept that this reminds of the Nightman’s touch, but I ground myself in the sight of Johns flushed face and his pleasant scent.
I am stunned at Mycroft’s outburst.  I watch Mycroft walk out into the hall, leaving no question that Doctor Pawson should follow.  I wonder what it is that he has to say that he wants to hide from me, but I don’t have time to really mull it over.  Sherlock is still visibly upset.  I go to his side.  I tell him he will be ok, take his hand and talk nonsense to him until he calms down a little.  I tell him to breathe slowly and thankfully, he listens.  He seems to recognise my voice.
The morning drags on and I don’t dare look at my phone.  I don’t want to see a message that says, ‘I don’t want to see you ever again.’  I couldn’t handle that.
John is concentrating on the job at hand, so I don’t think he notices my impending panic.  God, I hope he doesn’t.  I get a reprieve from the stress when he turns the tap off.  He opens the shampoo bottle, the little click it makes as it opens causes me to start.
For a few long moments he pauses.  I’m not used to the cogs of his brain moving so slowly, it is off putting.  His voice is thick with emotion when he speaks.  “I don’t want to be alone.  Could you stay here, with me?”
“When you’re ready, I’ll listen.”  I see the tightness around his eyes.  He looks so tired.  “Do you have a headache again?”
He stands up slowly and motions for me to lean back.  He reassures me that he will be more careful with the water.
Then there is the bequest of the man’s own father and all the guilt and shame that apparently comes with him.  I wonder if even someone as strong as Sherlock can shake off the power of that suggestion.  Sherlock has quite enough to deal with, without adding more to his problems.
Sherlock solves it within ten minutes of walking into the room, but it takes him three days to find the person who sold the ivory.
I follow John, as if on auto pilot.  I assume that he will lead me to the couch again, but he goes out the kitchen door that leads to the landing.  Through the fog in my brain I realise that he means for me to sleep in his room.  I am too tired, too emotionally drained, to question his wisdom, so I just follow him up the stairs.
I get it then; it comes to me in a flash.  “He’s dead.  The dead uncle.  The phone call, that day in the antiques shop.  No wonder you were so shaken.”
My hand shoots out to grab his wrist.  The movement is without any forethought or planning.  I’m just reacting now.  I have him pushed up against the fridge, his arm jammed up behind his back before I know what I am doing.  Water drips from my hair and runs down my face.  I am choking, then coughing.  My shoulder protests, my head feels like it is in a vice.
Doctor Pawson leaves us to check on one of his other patients.  Once we are alone in the hallway Mycroft gives me a look that is simultaneously questioning and smug.
“There were plenty of times.”  I say feebly.  He is right though; I never gave him time.  The tears fall down my face faster, and I wipe them away angrily.
“Sherlock.”  I say to get his attention.  The wounded glace he shoots towards me cuts deeply.  “The letter, is it from the Serbian man, the one who assaulted you?”
“Squeeze my hand.”  I tell him, putting my free hand, the one not holding the towel to his bleeding scalp, against his clammy palm.  It takes him a few moments for him to rally his energy and focus toward the task, but he manages a feeble grip.  “Ok, you can let go now.”
“No, please no.”  Sherlock says, his face contorting as he speaks.  This has been the routine.  Since they put him under to reduce the dislocated shoulder, we haven’t had a moment’s clarity from him.  Before that he was confused and irritable, but since then he has been anxious as well.
I pause because I know what I am about to say will change everything.  I know that every time John looks at me, he will know that Rimac put his filthy hands all over me.  I know John will refute it, say it doesn’t change anything, but I also know that that can’t be true.  I have already changed things, already set wheels into motion that cannot be stopped
I have sent Mrs Hudson away.  I gave her a few nights at a nice little place by the beach.  Somehow the apartment seems to be quieter than normal, too silent, but I couldn’t stand the risk of having her here.
“No, no, no.  Leave me alone.  Don’t hurt me.  I’ve already told you everything.”  Sherlock’s voice sounds desperate.
He introduces himself to Mycroft, explains the basics of the assessment that they have been trying to do.  “I will ask him to open his eyes, do a few simple motor tasks and answer some very basic questions.  He has become very agitated each time we do this, and it has meant that we have had to sedate him.  I want to break the cycle of sedation, but we need to be able to monitor him without the agitation.”
“Yes, I apologised, told him I would get help, I promised it would never happen again.  I need to keep that promise.”
When John comes in my hands are steady again, and Rosie is asleep.  She looks most like John when she is asleep, yet when she is awake it is Mary that I see.
“He probably won’t come here, Sherlock.”  John says, as he contemplates it.  “He never targets apartments, only homes and people with much more money.”
He is sitting up now with his knees to his chest, staring at the empty fireplace.  He doesn’t blink.  Just stares with fixed eyes.  I hold the mug of water out to him.  Still no response.  I clear my throat.  Nothing.
“Don’t be stupid.  It was just a dream.  I don’t believe any of the things my brain cooks up to torment me.”  It doesn’t stop them from feeling real though.  I should be used to this by now.
“The light was so bright.”  I say.  He freezes in place with his back turned and his hand on the doorknob.  “It was on all the time.  Day and night.  They wouldn’t let me sleep or even lie down.  I was kept standing up but hunched over so that I was never able to get comfortable.”
“Oh yeah, and I think you should admire my discretion at declining to mention that her lawyer friend likes to wear her frilly undies.”
“When was this?”  I ask him.  My voice shakes.  I need to know this; how could I be his closest friend and not be aware of this happening to him?
“Open your eyes for me.”  Again, he squeezes his thumb nail, this time holding Sherlock’s wrist gently to prevent him from pulling his hand away.  He squirms trying to get his arm free.  Sherlock mumbles something.  It sounds a bit like go away or maybe no way.  It’s hard to tell.
Two EMTs enter a few moments later.  I turn to greet them and see their faces register the horror show that is Sherlock’s bedroom.  They both struggle to tear their eyes away from the dead man on the bed.  One fails completely; I suspect he might be relatively new to the job.  At least new enough that he stands staring at the hole in the back of the man’s head.  It’s a shame he can’t see the front of his head from where he is standing.  That would really give him an education.
“I need records.  Burglaries, fights, assaults, car jackings, all sexual assaults, everything where the violence was exaggerated; was more than necessary to commit the crime.  Head injuries especially.  I need records from the past two years.  He didn’t begin with breaking in and bashing people’s heads in.  He started somewhere else.  That is how we find him.  I don’t know why I didn’t see it before.”
I am just tying off the last one when he speaks again.  It surprises me; I thought he had dozed off.
so bright.  I try to cover my face.  The skin on my had pulls.  Catheter.  That’s how they keep drugging me.  I reach to take
The scent of sex meets my nostrils.  A breath shudders out of me.  I tense.  John notices.  I grip his shirt.
“Hello Sherlock, how was your day?  Yes, mine was good too.”  He says in his most facetious voice.  “The traffic was a nightmare.  Work was busy, a twelve-year-old threw up on me.”
I am not surprised by his refusal.  Nor hurt.  I expected little else.  He is so rarely interested in his own pleasure.  I will never be sure whether it is the disinterest in sex that he has always claimed, or a residual symptom of the abuse he suffered in Serbia that makes him refuse.  He is still an enigma to me, even after all these years.  It would be unfair to pry though.  He gives me more of himself than he gives to anyone else.  To ask for more would be simply rude and I fear it would drive him away, make him even more reluctant to participate.
“I’m just a bit jumpy these days; it’s not just about that day.  You know that.”  I whisper back, not trusting my voice to say steady at full volume.
The poor doctor doesn’t know whether Mycroft is being serious or not, so he laughs politely and after a glance at me, which I can only answer with a raised eyebrow.
The gate at the end of the path clangs, the noise waking me from where I sleep lightly in my faithful old armchair.  Like us, it has seen quite a bit of action; there is a tear in the arm rest and a bullet hole through the back of it.  There is a singe mark too, from one of Sherlock’s experiments gone slightly wrong.  I don’t mind the holes or the stains; it is still as comfortable as it has ever been.
“Yes, best thing that could happen is that he comes here.”  I don’t mean it though.  Him coming here is not the best thing that could happen.  It would be a bloody disaster, but it would be over, and I am desperate for that.  A year and a half of thinking about this has worn on me.
“I don’t care about your bloody Hannibal moths.  Look at the state of you.”  I say, half to wind him up and half out of exasperation.  The result is that he then proceeds to tell me all the reasons why his precious moths have nothing to do with any block buster movies and why they are so incredible.
“You did this on purpose, didn’t you?”  He is angry now that he has realised.  “You rang the papers, you are using yourself as bait to catch him, aren’t you?”
I laugh a little.  Then realise that it is an entirely inappropriate time to be laughing.  That makes me laugh a little more.  Thankfully he joins me and doesn’t throw me out of the room.  The tension drains from us both a little.
The letter needs to be back in the safety deposit box now.  That is the single-minded thought that consumes me until I have the opportunity to get out of the house, to get
I go to Rosie.  I step right over the rail of the play pen and sit down on her blanket.  She stumbles towards me crying and throws herself into my lap.  My hands are still shaking as I hold her to my chest and smell her hair.
She sends me home with a wad educational of papers to read, a business card with our next appointment time, and a sense of hope.
“Yes, John but do they say anything interesting?”  I ask over his reading.  I pluck at the violin strings absently.  This feels like old times.
He scoffs.  Knowing that it is my way of agreeing.  Then he whispers, “please don’t let there be any more.”
“No, he didn’t.  He just let it happen.  I think that he thinks he deserved it.  Thing is, he could, he is a black belt in judo or something, and a practiced boxer, he could wipe the floor with me, but he just let me hit him.”
“Yeah, only if it’s not raining though, forecast is for showers.”  I pull back the covers and he discards the towel wet towels onto the floor and drops into the bed.
I sit in the waiting room staring at an apparently soothing landscape of stone walls and country lanes.  I am a mass of nerves.  I try to rehearse what I will say.  It all sounds too stupid.  What do I say?  I am angry because my best friend killed himself in front of me and then, two years later he came back to life in the middle of my proposal to my wife and then incited such anger in her that she killed him again.  Don’t worry though, he came back to life yet again, only to put his life at such risk that she died to save him.  Now I think I might be in love with him but I’m not sure because I’m not usually gay.  Doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, does it?
Since he started.  That is the key.   He wasn’t born fully formed.  None of them are.  He didn’t start with this.  No one just begins with home invasions that are motivated by rape and violence.  Sure, he takes some valuables but that is not what he is all about.  It is about the killing and the sexual assaults.  Something must have come first.  That’s the key to this; to finding him.
Reflexively, the questions I cannot ask, start again as I stand, unnoticed, in the doorway.  Seeing him bruised and impassive, while I wonder what happened to him, is like a kick in the guts.
My alarm goes off for the early shift and I reach out to silence it quickly.  Sherlock had been up until all hours composing something haunting and now that he is finally asleep, I don’t want to wake him.
I am still rooted in place with my back turned to him.  The shock of what I had just heard paralyses me.  I knew something serious had happened to him.  Mycroft had indicated that at the hospital, Sherlock had said as much when I had spilt the water on him, but I had no idea that he was… abused to that extent.  I still fear that moving will break the spell.  He never talks like this.  He is never this candid about anything outside of a case or an experiment.  In the silence of the room I summon up the courage to turn towards him.  I need to be closer to him, I need to offer him some comfort.  I am glad for the darkness of the room that hides the tears that are streaking down my face.
“People with head injuries can be quite combative, he hates being poked and prodded at the best of times.”  Great.  Now Mycroft is a medical expert as well as being an insufferable snob.
“Thank you.”  I say as he leans in to grab the beer bottle from me.  Then as if it is the most natural thing in the world, he presses his lips softly against mine.
“What did you do today?”  he calls over the rattle of plates and cups.  I don’t know why he bothers.  I’d eat the chips straight out of the paper.
It is completely forgotten by the end of the week.  We get called in to assist with a locked room mystery that features a dead prisoner in one of the Scotland Yard cells.  The man, clearly an idiot, breached his parole and every law and moral by trying to buy a chunk of ivory.  Then he got caught because he bragged about it on his Facebook page.
“Oh, no sorry.  She’s fine, I think, it has been a while but, no, I have another reason for calling.”  I pause; I should have thought this through more.  “Can I ask you a question?”
“Why did you go there again?  And with all this happening?”  John asks.  He is exasperated, he doesn’t like it that I still see Eurus.  He is still angry about the trick she played on him and about what happened when we went to Sherrinford.
“What the hell was that about?”  I ask.  The only way to handle Mycroft is point blank and even that doesn’t work most of the time.
Thank you for being the ones to leave the kind words, the kudos and for lurking in the shadows.  This would not be as much fun without you.
Our sexual encounters have been limited.  And they have had varying degrees of success.  We are like two fumbling teenagers who don’t know what they are doing.  Mostly, I cannot calm the chaos in my mind and have to stop.  Then, I find myself frustrated at my lack of control.  John is excellent and always gives me the space that I need, but I can tell he is frustrated that he doesn’t know how to help me through it.  Surely, he must be sexually frustrated as well.
“How else could her pants get so stretched?  All day she was pulling them back up.  The elastic must be shot.”
Another twisting stroke and my orgasm overtakes me.  Gasping and gritting my teeth, my legs shake against his hold; every muscle is taught.
“Oh, of course.”  He says absently, then scrunches his eyebrows as he notices the scars partner.  “Jesus.  There is another one on the other side.”
I wake up sitting upright and breathing hard.  My mind feels fuzzy.  I try to remember, what did I take?  How much?
“Just get in the bed, John?”  He says, but there is tension to his voice.  I suspect it is caused by uncertainty I am feeling.
“I get it.  I was also saving myself, so you were right in a way.  I didn’t just leave for you.  But I did come back for you.  That was the only think that kept me going in there.  The thought of coming back here to you.”  He pauses and then adds, almost as an afterthought.  “To your friendship.”
I know I should be excited for him.  He has been hoping that the moths would come to the hives, but I am mad.  I am mad because I am scared.  I sigh in exasperation.
“Right here, Sherlock.  How are you feeling?”  I ask him, not really expecting an answer.  I don’t get one.  I wait until he settles and pull the blankets back up a little.  His temperature is a little low, but he keeps pushing the blankets away.
And here you were thinking I was going to leave you hanging for a whole week.  What kind of a monster do you think I am?
The thoughts don’t stop circling in my head.  How could I have been so stupid to not realise that I was part of the problem?  I have spent years blaming Sherlock for all the things that have gone wrong in my life and failing to recognise that I am one of the things that have gone wrong in his.
The scars are almost invisible these days.  They have faded to inconspicuousness much like the emotional ones.  They are still there.  If you know where to look.  If he is prepared to let you see.  He shows them to me and for that I feel humble and honoured.
“I never said a word.”  He says with fake innocence that is completely undermined by his ridiculous grin.
His slow movements hardly cause a ripple on the surface of the water, but they make me spasm and squirm.  One arm reaches around my waist and pulls me back against his chest.
Awareness again.  Clarity.  Ambulance.  Oh good.  That means hospital.  Maybe they can fix this.  I can hear Johns voice.  He will make it alright.  He usually does, in the end.  He takes my hand and tells me to be still, tells me that I am ok.  I’m not sure whether to believe him.
Sherlock sits up suddenly, he meets my eyes for the first time; he looks so hurt by my words.  “Why?  Why would you think that?”
“That’s not necessary.”  John begins.  “In fact, it should be the other way round, you should not be staying here alone.”
You asked and you received.  It won't be a regular thing, but you have all been so jolly nice that I couldn't help myself.
“Good, start with that.  First sign of any anger and I want you to choof off for a stroll.”  She says with a smile.  “We have a lot to work on, John, if you are willing I want to see you once a week so that we can work through some of the things that are bothering you and so that we can make a plan for how you are going to deal with challenges in the future.  Does that sound acceptable.”
I’ve rejected four inquiries that are just cheating spouses, and one flirting housewife, and two kids with lost pets, when Mrs. Hudson taps on the door.
“Nothing.”  I concede as my hips jerk involuntarily, seeking friction, touch, pleasure.  The tip of my cock breaches the surface of the water.  The contrast of the warm water, then cold air, then warm water again it beautifully alarming.
He strokes my cheek with is clean hand.  I cannot answer the questioning look on his face right now.  I shudder runs through me, then another.  My skin is overheated and prickly, but I feel icy to the core.  The smells of sex surround me.
“I shot him in the back of the head.  Sherlock had almost stopped struggling; he was running out of time.”  I rub my eyes with both palms, exhaustion is catching up with me.
Rosie had been heartbroken.  She nearly failed two classes because she refused to leave the hospital for more than a few hours at a time.  It wasn’t until he pulled his oxygen mask off and told her to ‘piss off home,’ in a barely audible whisper, that she finally went and got a whole night’s sleep.  While she was gone, he told the nurses to enforce visiting hours.  I’ll never be sure if it was that he was trying to do Rosie a favour or if he just didn’t really want us to see him like that.  Either way, it allowed her to scrap through a passing grade.
Still nothing.  When I touch him on the knee, he nearly levitates.  I jump too.  Water runs down my fingers.
“Of course.  Of course, I do.”  I roll to face him.  I bury my face in his chest.  Listen to his breathing.  I tuck my foot between his calves in an effort to get closer.  He pulls me in and holds me there.  His steady comfort lets me calm down and eventually drift back to sleep.
I sit up to hitch the leg of my pyjama pants up to show him the raised welts and deep notches where chunks were torn from my right leg.  They are by far the worst of the scars from Serbia.  “These were made with a pair of pliers.  Mycroft picked them from amongst a selection of other tools.  He was not expecting them to be used with such enthusiasm.”
I don’t know.  I hate not knowing.  Why do I keep forgetting?  My mouth feels dry.  The blue glow from the jellyfish tank that is usually soothing, just reminds me of the attack now.
His voice had turned bitter and tight as he spoke of his brother’s involvement.  When he paused, he took a deep breath.  His voice was flat again when he continued.
He is thoroughly too smug.  I undo the top few buttons on his shirt and lean in to take his nipple between my teeth.  Lick at it with the tip of my tongue while I hold it in place with my teeth.  He moans softly.  This is my favourite way to see him.  It is worth the stress of intimacy to see him like this.
“There are still chunks in it.  It is revolting.  I think I can even smell it.”  I exaggerate my look of disgust.
As Greg walks me the elevator, he tells me “It was a justified shooting, John.  Don’t get worried about all the questions, we are just doing our job.”
I shut my eyes for a moment, I didn’t want to get into this so soon.  “Yes, there is someone new in my life, well not new, we have known each other for ages, it’s just the relationship that is new.”
I realise I am dozing off and I’m too bored to care.  I doubt there will be any problems tonight; it is after three o’clock.  I would know if he is here already and if he does change his MO and come now, I’m a light sleeper.  I can thank my experiences in Serbia for that.
“It got harder as time went on.  I was getting tired, worn down, and they were so persistent.  They must have done some research on interrogation techniques; just stuff they could find on the internet probably.  They were predictable especially in the beginning; they would just beat me when I refused to tell them what they wanted.  Predictable was good, in a way.  It was manageable, for a time at least, but the combination of it all, the waterboarding, the sleep deprivation, hardly any food or water, the stress position, the humiliation of being left to shit and piss myself, It wore me down, not that I would have admitted it at the time, not even to myself.
“The nurses were too busy flirting with you.”  I joke, trying to deflect, I don’t want him to know that I told them not to.
John looks out for the town’s folk by doing house calls.  He is usually home by lunchtime.  He is writing a book in his spare time, but he won’t let me read any of it just yet.
“I didn’t know how.  I was embarrassed, ashamed of what happened.  Scared of what you would think of me.”  He admits.  “Who I am, who everyone thinks I am, it is all just because of their perception.  I couldn’t bare for that to change.”
I gasp as he pinches my nipple and rolls it between his thumb and finger.  I feel him smile against my mouth.
I wake up heaving like a racehorse.  Teeth clenched. Muscles clenched.  Fists clenched.  John mumbles something; reaches out to me.  His hand ghosts across the scars Mary gifted me.  I push his hand away, but keep it gripped tightly in mine.
“What time is it?”  I ask as I suppress any thoughts about the other intended purposes for the torch.
I know where she is going with this, it’s hard not to be defensive.  “He is clean now, has been since then. He’s great with Rosie.  He works with the police; he isn’t some junkie.”
As they talk, I am doing the mental calculations.  2013, late 2013, that was when he was… dead.  Oh.  How did I not know that had happened?  It must have been shortly before he came home in January.  Why did he never mention it?
Mechanically he takes them, and I sit across from him while he finishes his drink.  His hands are shaking.  I have never seen him like this before.  Never so quiet and introspective.  It scares me.
Our life is simple and comfortable there.  The fresh air agrees with my failing lungs in a way that the London smog could not.
I take a deep breath, knowing how much he resists my nagging, but…  “Sherlock.  You need to me more careful.  I don’t want to lose you.”
Sometimes he does want more, sometimes he even seems to enjoy it, other times he stops and draws back into himself.  It’s been years since he has had one if the full-scale declines into a shaking, sweating and heaving panic attack, but I wonder, while the physical symptoms have abated, to what extent the mental struggles continues.
His hands don’t falter at the scars though.  They carry on until they find a knot in the tight muscles.  Then he works at it until the knot crackles and fades beneath his firm touch.  Then he moves onto the next one.  Soon I feel heavy and relaxed.
He goes quiet and I am almost going to suggest we go somewhere warmer, maybe even get a cuppa, when he starts talking again.
He gives me an odd look as he comes back in balancing the plates and cups.  “Yeah, you sent me a text.”
I consider for a moment, trying to work out what Mycroft is driving at.  Then I get it.  I understand why Sherlock is reacting so badly to the situation.  “He feels threatened.”
“Exactly like that.”  I say dryly.  I see the moment he realises, wide eyed, that the person he is about to cart off to hospital is the bloke he had read about in the papers.
By the time Mycroft comes back, Sherlock is more settled.  He is curled up on his side with his eyes crinkled shut.  He won’t allow me to pull the blanket back over him properly, but it is covering him to the waist at least.  I’ll try to get the heating turned up a bit.
“I don’t care about you bloody Hannibal moths.  Look at the state of you.”  John says with exasperation.
Only moments after we say goodbye my phone buzzes with a text message; it is the number Clara promised me.
He gently pushes me on to my back.  He lowers my pants until they are down my thighs.  I lift my hips to help him.  I suck in a breath as my erection is freed from the confines of my pants.  He rubs both his hot palms up my thighs and encircles my erection.  His touch is electric.  His movements practiced but so different from my own.  I am paralysed by pleasure and by other emotions that I push away.
When John wakes me with up a warm hand on my shoulder, he is dressed for work.  He has a mug of tea and a packet of pills for me.
“I need you to open your eyes for me.”  Doctor Pawson says loudly.  Still there is no response.  He rubs Sherlock’s forearm, trying to get his attention.  He waits for a moment and then moves onto applying increasing pressure to the nail of his right thumb.  Sherlock jerks his hand away but does not open his eyes.
I enter the room when I get no reply.  I look closely at his face.  He is still, his face is pale and motionless, but something flickers behind his eyes.  I’m not sure which is worse.  When he was agitated, it was like there was something of himself present, at least.  Now, despite being in possession of himself, it’s like he is not here at all.
The four official letters I throw onto the desk and the final one I place on the mantelpiece next to the knife.
“I struggled so hard against the electric shocks that I shattered a molar.  I heard my wrist crack.  They kept going until I passed out.  At least that saved me from telling them something I shouldn’t have.”
“Did you love her for her vagina?”  Clara asks point blank.  It is my turn to be surprised by her personal point-blank question.
“I know,” she says, waving me into a chair, “I lived in Palermo for a few years, all last week I wished I was back there.”
I hold the open notebook out towards him, showing him the notes.  He is not at all interested in any of my scribbles about the moths.  He can, however, be convinced to take a bath with me, so all is not lost.  Once I am warm again, with him reclining against my chest, I even manage to short circuit another lecture on the dangers of having another bout of pneumonia.  All it takes to distract him is a writhing, leg shaking climax that I create for him with slow strokes of my slippery hands.  He offers to reciprocate but my enjoyment really lies in witnessing his own.  Now that he is quiet and satisfied, the warmth of the steamy room is making me dozy.  I suggest that I might nap for a while; being up all night has done me in.
I didn’t have time to appreciate the moment for too long though.  Doctor Pawson enters again with a smiling hello to each of us.
“Why didn’t you say anything?”  I am gutted that he felt he could not confide in me.  I step close to the bed where he lays curled on his side.  He looks small.
I am not prepared for what I find inside the envelope.  My eyes flick between the disturbing photo, made all the more unsettling for the knife wound that is now through the neck of the Sherlock effigy.  It is clear who the cruel words are from.  My heart is pounding against my ribs as I read through it and realise all the implications of what is said.  The holding a piece of tangible evidence of the continued indignities Sherlock has suffered at this man’s hands brings everything home with a sense of shocking reality.  The knowledge that his rapist witnessed him calling out for me in desperation cuts deeply.  I flush hot and my skin prickles with fluctuating quantities of rage that I understand clearly and embarrassment that I don’t.
I sigh and frown at myself, suddenly more unsure than I have ever been.  I am forced to make an admission.  “I’m not exactly sure.”
“The blonde one was cute.”  John laughs a little.  I don’t remember the blonde nurse, but I laugh anyway.  The absurdity of the situation suddenly getting to me; a grown man getting his hair washed in the kitchen sink like a toddler.  That is when the water spills down my face.
“Did I keep you up all night?”  I ask him as I burrow back into the pillows.  He looks tired.  I am worried that I disturbed him as I tried to escape more haunting dreams.
“John, you can take it from here, I trust?”  Mycroft says.  “I have a diplomatic situation to take care of.”
It’s a guess though.  I know she said something about scones, but did she make them?  Did I eat some?  I hate the memory loss.  I had thought I was getting past it, but every time I think that, a new gap appears in my recent past.  Every time I think I am better it is only because I realise, I was worse the day before than I had appreciated at the time.  But what does that mean for how bad I am today?
“When you’re ready, I’ll listen.” John tells me.  “Any time you like.  You can say as much or as little as you like, and I will listen.”
He nods and I run my fingertips over his skin.  The textures change from soft and warm to smooth and tight, almost like plastic.  Ripples of hard-fought healing beneath the skin.  I trace a line from the exit wound across the top of his shoulder in search of the entry wound.  The depression that I am looking for is lower than I expect.  It must have gone through his scapular.  He lets me explore without complaint.
I cannot see his hands beneath the bubble that glisten on the surface of the water but I can certainly feel it when both his hands drift down and encircle my cock.  Barely touching me.  A whisper of a touch.  Blood and arousal flow faster than his movements.
