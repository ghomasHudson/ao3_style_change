“And why don’t you stop flashing my card at every locked gate you encounter? My name is not a get out of jail free card, Sherlock.”
“Um, Sherlock, right. I’ve told you I don’t remember anything useful. I’m not gonna be much help. And I thought you said you weren’t with the police?”
As soon as Sherlock turned around, John strolled out of the kitchen and into the sitting room, rubbing at his eyes as he threw Sherlock’s coat off his armchair.
“You should hear him in class; always correcting the professor, telling if people had been shagging the night before, that sort of thing. So you two are friends now, then?”
John gave Sherlock’s shoulder a light squeeze before backing away. He couldn’t help but stay for just a few moments longer, admiring the way the moonlight filtered through the slats in the window and illuminated Sherlock’s sleeping face.
“You should know that I tend to pace rather rapidly when I’m thinking and I’ve been told by various people throughout my life that I talk in my sleep. Would that bother you?”
John nodded sullenly. He looked down at the floor, then back up at Sherlock who was staring unfocused at the side of John’s bed. “But you found me.”
John slowly started to make his way to Sherlock’s room, hearing Sherlock follow him into the kitchen as he went.
The man said nothing, and for a quick second, John felt relief when one of his arms was released. Unfortunately, with how weak his vision was around the edges, he didn’t see the fist come flying right at his face.
not now that the people around him were all hammered and likely wouldn’t let him hear the end of it if they saw what he was hiding.
“Just give me a minute here, alright? This is all just coming back to me now. He was an older man, white hair, shabby hat. Glasses. I dunno what he was wearing, an old jumper, maybe?”
It took the better part of an hour of Sherlock digging through skips in the nearby area before he found a metal cane half buried atop a mountain of trash. He grinned wide, his breath coming out like smoke in front of him. He examined the cool metal with gloved hands, and smiled even more when he saw what he needed; fingerprints.
“I’ve been summoned. Detective Inspector Lestrade seems to think he’s found a lead. I might be long; make yourself at home. And yes, I want you to stay here. I know you live alone and I don’t want you heading home in this state. Mrs. Hudson will be up; she’ll make you tea and stay with you.”
“I hope you enjoyed that, because I am not playing another one of those ridiculous songs for at least the next century,” Sherlock said.
John looked away and nodded curtly. “Right,” he said, his voice ragged. “Well, I’m not an idiot either, Sherlock. And I know you only said those things to upset me so that I’d storm off and leave you alone. But I’m not doing that. Because what I just heard you say is that you think I only wanted to be your friend so that I could fix you. But you’re wrong.” John swallowed hard and steeled himself before facing Sherlock again. “I wanted to be your friend because I
Sherlock groaned and sunk his head deeper into the cushion. “If I’m this bored on day three, I doubt I’ll make it to Christmas without losing my mind entirely.”
“Very funny,” John said, clapping Sherlock playfully on the shoulder.  “But yeah, I know you’re right; I need to just take it easy, I guess. I’m sure I can figure out a way to get things done without driving myself mad.”
John licked his lips and shook his head fondly. “It’s- god, you’re gonna think I’m a right sap when I tell you.”
John could tell that there were words forming at the tip of Sherlock’s tongue that he wanted to say, but he was holding himself back. John was glad for it, though, because the last thing he wanted to do at that moment was talk. Not only because talking proved a painful experience, but because he wasn’t even sure what to say.
“It means that you don’t mix up your socks. It means that you always type up your blog no matter how tired you are. That you don’t trip over yourself and you don’t get mugged in an alley and you don’t fumble and break teacups and for the love of god, John, what on earth is going on with you?” Sherlock let go of the shorter man, and slumped his shoulders uncharacteristically as he caught his breath.
John wasn’t even entirely sure what had brought on this sudden bout of insomnia, but he supposed it was to be expected when one lead the sort of life he did with Sherlock. Or perhaps his therapist had been right about the PTSD after all, but either way, he hoped that whatever unseen force that was disrupting his sleep would be remedied by a few days spent in the quiet countryside.
John stopped. He closed his eyes and sighed, letting the tremor run its course through his hand. The shaking would always start around his thumb, causing it to almost vibrate back and forth, and the wave of movement would travel through the rest of his fingers and seize control of his hand.
“Well, this is important,” John declared. “Culturally,” he added pointedly before getting up to rummage through his DVD collection.
He listened for a while as the soothing sounds traveled through the air. It was oddly apt, John realized, that Sherlock should start playing such a calming melody so soon after John woke from a night terror. John furrowed his brow, thinking back to the hazy memories he had over the past few months of Sherlock’s violin playing coinciding with his insomnia.
Right in the middle of the dusty wooden floors lay a shorter man, dressed in a casual jacket and jeans, sprawled out helplessly.  Sherlock knelt down by him immediately.
For a moment, he and Sherlock stood silently in the middle of the pavement as people walked by and got on with their days. John hoped they hadn’t made much of a scene.
Sherlock didn’t answer, he simply furrowed his brow and closed his slack jaw. John could practically see the wheels turning in his head, struggling to formulate something to say. He was probably trying to figure out how to say something without offending John, but to no avail, apparently, for he cast his eyes downward to avoid looking at John.
John reached out to take the scarf from Sherlock’s hold, but was surprised when instead of handing it to him, Sherlock stepped into his space and wrapped the scarf around his neck himself. All of the air seemed to escape John’s lungs at once as he felt Sherlock’s fingers deftly adjusting the garment around him, felt the warmth practically radiating off of him.
John swallowed hard, attempting to ease the unexpected tightness in his throat. He’d never actually said the words out loud; even Mike only knew that there had been some kind of fight with Harry, but he didn’t know the details.
“So you understand then?” John asked hopefully, looking to his friend who had thankfully long since come back into focus. His vision seemed to blur at random intervals, and he breathed a quiet sigh of relief that this recent bout of blurriness was over.
“No thanks, mate. I’d really rather not be sick in the morning,” John said. He’d only had two drinks so far, but the company of his friends and the joy of exams being over seemed to be more than enough of a natural buzz.
“He'll be fine, don't worry. Why don't you go in my room and...look through my things,” Sherlock suggested.
“Shh, s’okay. Breathe, John. I’m right here, you’re safe,” Greg reminded him in a gentler tone. He nodded and noticed that his legs weren’t shaking nearly as much now.
“Is papa okay?” He asked, his worry evident in his eyes. Sherlock should have known he’d want to know exactly what was happening.
John smiled. “Maybe I do, yeah.” He turned his head away and bit his lip, suddenly very nervous. He had to do this, though; deep down, he
“You wash your hands a lot, and you go outside often. The cold air dries out your skin and you don’t take care of it.”
Sherlock moved the tea closer to John and got up to look through the selection of DVD’s. Once he found the bee documentary that he kept at John’s house just in case, he popped it in and turned all the lights off.
Sherlock and John were deep into the woods, following a dusty dirt path surrounded by thickets and aging trees, the branches like claws silhouetted against the night sky.
exhausted, don’t think I don’t notice. It’s been getting worse and you know it has. Why do you refuse to give yourself a break?”
“Hm? No, go ahead.” John shrugged. Watching Sherlock play would likely prove more entertaining than the fireplace.
He reached out and fisted his hand in the blanket, holding it like he wished he could be holding Sherlock.
Sherlock sighed. “I’ve told you, John, I use a specific memory technique in order to ensure that all important information is kept neatly organized for ease of access at any given time.”
“But you’re not comfortable with it,” Sherlock blurted out. He quickly shook his head as if mentally chastising himself. “No, sorry, that was…not good.”
“I believe so. But you must understand what I’m saying as well. I don’t intend for these situations to cause us harm, and yes I will endeavor to be more careful in future—“
“I didn’t, actually,” John admitted. “Maybe I should. It’s been ages since I’ve talked to her. And I do miss her.”
Sherlock practically stormed into the sitting room after leaving his bedroom, finding John to be hunched over in his armchair, looking very much like he hadn’t moved from that spot for hours. He didn’t look up at Sherlock when he came in, only continued to clutch his shoulder.
“You’re sure about this?” John asked, his fingers frozen at the top button of his shirt. He was sat by the headboard of the bed with Sherlock perched on the edge of it. He didn’t have to do this, he knew, but it’d been months since they’d begun a sexual relationship, and putting it off any more would only continue to build up the anxiety.
Without even thinking about it, John put his hand in the middle of the seat in a silent request. Ever since the night that Sherlock showed John how he could use his sense of touch, holding Sherlock’s hand had become a sort of way of grounding him, bringing him back down to earth, reminding him that he would never truly not be able to see.
“Oh, Christ.” He shot back to the sink and turned down the water, having to let Hamish scamper into the sitting room behind him.
John licked his lips in thought and folded his arms on the table, leaning in slightly to speak quieter.
“John?” Sherlock frantically shook John’s shoulders, but he already seemed to be at the cusp of unconsciousness.
“I asked John a question but he wasn’t answering, then I look up and the poor man looks like he’s seen a ghost.”
John rushed to the door to see who it was and immediately let out a huge sigh of relief when he saw Sherlock stepping back inside, large duffle bag in hand.
John groaned in frustration, wishing that Sherlock would actually look at him instead of subtly trying to inch ahead of him.
It had taken about another month before John was no longer able to clearly make out faces. That had been a rough day for everyone at Baker Street, especially Mrs. Hudson, who made John a tray of his favourite jam-filled biscuits, and cooked a wonderful dinner that even Sherlock sat and ate politely.
When John reached the entrance to the sitting room, he stopped dead in his tracks to stare at the image of Sherlock in his deep red dressing gown, facing the window and swaying lightly as he expertly pulled the bow across the strings.
“Oi, let me sit down first, yeah?” John said. He set his books down on the only space that was devoid of papers and pulled his jacket off his shoulders, letting it fall onto the chair before sitting down. “Right. What’s so urgent, then?”
“Your socks always match. You’re almost obsessive with it, making sure they stay in faithful pairs and folding them neatly in your drawer.”
John watched as the end credits rolled lazily up the television screen, but all he could focus on was the warm weight of Sherlock’s head resting on his shoulder. He almost wanted to keep letting the credits roll so that Sherlock would stay where he was for just a little bit longer, but he knew that sleeping in that position would only lead to a very sore neck in the morning, so he would have to wake him to up eventually.
“You always leave a DVD lying around after you watch one. It’s hardly a challenge to work out what your current obsessions are.”
John ignored him in favour of wiping the sweat from his brow and headed straight towards his gym bag.
“Yeah. Just Evans and I think Bennett got out. I had to see to Evans’ injuries.” John’s voice trailed off, and he turned his head away from Sherlock.
Sherlock stretched his arm out to reach the change of clothes in John’s bag and yanked out a shirt to lay on the ground and rest John’s head on it. John’s brow was furrowed under his sweat-soaked fringe as he mumbled incoherently, and Sherlock could see that his face had gone from pale to a sickly grey colour.
“Oh, no, none of that,” Sherlock said decisively. He walked over to the sofa, gathered up John’s pyjamas and practically shoved them into John’s arms. “Go get changed, forget about your schoolwork, and come watch terrible films and eat takeaway with me.”
“Oh, none of that. I don’t need interesting conversation; I’m not your date. Here comes Angelo, just order tonight’s special since you can’t seem to decide, and it’ll all be on the house since he owes me a favor."
“Oh, right!” Mike said, pointing a victorious finger in the air. “What was he doing fighting a bloke twice his size, anyway?”
“I was not peeping. It's not like the door was locked, or closed for that matter. But I’m just saying, I couldn’t look away because, hell, I’ve never seen you handle anything with such…such—“
“Sherlock, I’d just walked in the door, you tossed a full suitcase at me and manhandled me into the car!”
“Look,” John said, “I know there’s more we should talk about, but whatever pain meds they’ve got me on must be making me drowsy because I’m almost definitely about to fall asleep again. But just…stay here with me, please? After feeling like you weren’t even there the past few days I just…want to know you’re here.”
John gripped the edge of the counter and took a deep breath. “It’s fine. It’s not like I want to be around them, anyway.”
“Hooper,” Sherlock repeated, steepling his hands under his chin in thought. “Does your mother happen to work in the mortuary at St. Bart’s?”
knife wounds, but the malice and the damage was still there. We got them out, but two of them, two of them were—“
“Wait hold on, why’d you need to know that? Are you—are you typing up the case on my blog?” he asked, his voice high in pitch with concern.
John pursed his lips in thought, thinking perhaps joining in on another case would be a welcomed distraction from his distress. He knew that his vision was going to do nothing but worsen, and at a faster rate, due to the fact that he was older. And so at that moment, he decided that until it approached the point where he would need assistance, he would try to enjoy his life as normal, or at least as normal as things got around Sherlock. He didn’t want the extra concern, the pity, the classic look of half sympathy, half cluelessness on someone’s face when they heard the news. He didn’t want any of it, at least not yet, and so he got up out of his chair and headed over to his friend.
“One coffee, one Earl Grey, and two honey scones,” John said, placing Sherlock’s mug in front of him. “Black, two sugars, yeah?” he asked.
“I got a new book about bees that I was gonna show you, but since I can’t I’ll just tell you some stuff I learned,” he said.
washed, right? And oh, Sherlock was there too, leaning on the door with his arms folded, watching John race back and forth.
“Damn it,” John swore under his breath. He was seconds away from abandoning the blog post altogether when he heard familiar footfalls on the stairs.
“John,” he said hesitantly, “you should know that while I’m flattered, I’m not exactly looking for—“
“I know, John. I know you have trouble admitting when you have a problem. You’re incredibly stubborn.”
“Sherlock!” he tried again, his voice already losing steam. “Sher—“ John gasped sharply as his foot slipped on a sheet of ice, sending him hurtling forward and landing directly on his left shoulder.
Upon returning to 221B, John breathed a bit in relief at not having to go to the store. He looked around their humble abode and licked his lips. For a moment he just stood and, for what felt like the first time, actually looked at the entire room.
“No, no,” John assured, despite the fact that he looked like he just might spill his guts all over Sherlock’s jeans.
Sighing heavily, John opened the door to he and Sherlock’s flat, wanting nothing more than to melt into his bed and sleep for an entire year, but he knew that he still had work to do.
He settled down onto the sofa, figuring that Sherlock was most likely gallivanting off to who knows where, doing who knows what type of research. John was beginning to feel more impatient than relaxed, and almost wished he were back in London, sprinting across rooftops and running down dark alleyways. At least there he had something to do, and someone who needed him.
John cleared his throat quickly and turned his gaze back to the newspaper he was supposedly reading.
It was silent for a while as John glossed over the menu and Sherlock went back and forth from texting and glancing out the window. Sherlock noticed that John was beginning to look around nervously, searching for something to say.
“Greg, what are you doing?” John asked. His voice was shakier than he would’ve liked but he was not about to just sit while the thunder got louder. What the hell was Greg thinking?
The ride was silent for a beat, and John focused on the soft rumbling noise the car made under his feet. It was strangely calming, and he found himself becoming entranced by the sound. He was wavering on the edge of sleep when Sherlock’s deep baritone snapped the silence in half.
He licked his lips, sunk his head back into the pillow and tried to get more comfortable. He was too tense, trying too hard. He needed to relax.
“I do hope you realize that the only reason I agreed to come here is for the scones,” Sherlock said.
By the time they made it back to 221B, it was nearly evening. Sherlock hadn’t bothered to notice that they’d wasted half the day away chasing cabs and questioning drivers on a wild goose chase. Sherlock was planning on discussing the next plan of action to John as soon as they’d gotten back, but to the detective’s utmost dismay, an overly posh black car was parked outside Baker Street.
“And I’ll have to get there before my shift ‘cause if I don’t, it’ll be closed by the time I leave work, which means—“
“Good. That’s settled, then,” Sherlock said before turning on his heel and rushing back the way he came.
John followed him into the sitting room and stopped short, seeming hesitant to go any further. He cleared his throat and looked up at Sherlock.
John was smiling to himself when he heard familiar footsteps behind him. He turned to look at Sherlock, who was dressed in an oversized jumper and what looked to be a pair of John’s pyjama bottoms that came up a little short on his legs.
That’s odd, Sherlock thought, John would always come and unlock the door for him. Hesitating a bit, Sherlock pulled the door open and stepped inside.
“I’ll get you your usual, then.” John put down his newspaper and picked up his mobile. He knew by now that if he simply put food next to Sherlock, eventually he would eat it, whether he noticed he was doing it or not.
“I don’t normally play for people,” Sherlock murmured, lowering his violin and staring out the window.
“Oh yeah!” Mike exclaimed. “I’ve got chem with him. Bloody hell, he’s gonna get beaten to a pulp out there, isn’t he?”
The last two weeks of the break had been filled with binge-watching films, solving a few small cases, and performing a variety of makeshift experiments on whatever Sherlock could find lying around the flat.
“John!” Sherlock shouted in greeting. “Where are you? I’ve got Andrews. He may or may not be conscious. Lestrade’s on his way.”
But now he’d be lucky if he woke up in the morning and saw Sherlock next to him let alone after a nightmare. He was almost beginning to get used to the empty space to his left. Perhaps he should’ve seen this coming, should’ve known that Sherlock was never partial to routine and would eventually move on to something new.
Sherlock listened to the thumps of John coming up the steps. He had a new cane, his footfalls sounded slow and uneven, obviously an adverse effect of his near death experience.
John looked down at his pocket where his mobile was tucked away. He looked back up at the speaker, still only slightly aware of what he was saying, and decided to give in to temptation and take out his phone.
“It’s okay,” John said slowly. “I need you too, you git,” he added, his mouth forming a smile. “I need you…us, to be safe.”
John smiled bitterly, sighing and folding up the newspaper in defeat. “Look, Sherlock, it’s fine. However you feel about my…it doesn’t matter. I’m fine.”
“Oh, right,” John mumbled, looking at his chair and finding the remote wedged between the cushions. He flicked off the TV and went back to staring at the fire.
Sherlock smiled at the thought as he hopped up the steps to John’s front porch and tapped on the door. He was biting his lip trying to contain his excitement.
“John, this is...these are…extraordinary,” Sherlock breathed. He held his hand close to John’s shoulder, not touching, just ghosting his fingertips over his skin.
“Sherlock, there’s nothing I can do about my hand, so just let me write the stupid blog,” John snapped.
Sherlock waited until he saw the black car pull away to go and fetch John. When he came back up, the doctor hobbled right to his usual chair, and Sherlock absently noted it was becoming a sort of understanding that they sat in their respective spots. It was as if John belonged there, like he’d been there all along.
“A good one. But he wasn’t the same, after, I mean. And I know you’ve seen some pretty gruesome wounds in your job, but it’s different when the person you’re examining is alive, and in pain, and a…and a friend.”
John approached the table slowly and slid his bag off his shoulder, sitting down across from Sherlock without the other man so much as glancing up at him.
It was later in the evening now and John and Sherlock were sat in the sitting room in front of the fire, enjoying another cup of tea. Mr and Mrs Holmes had retired to bed, leaving the two of them to sit in companionable silence.
Sherlock was lost in Mycroft’s questions, he suddenly felt thoroughly ashamed of himself - Mycroft was to the point, he surrendered to his lower body now, doing nothing all day long but sex, his mind was wasted. At first, he thought this kind of rebellion could provoke Mycroft and got his revenge on him. But his over-indulgence in it now had long been beyond a mischief, wanting to humiliate others, but the result was just more to be ashamed, Sherlock now reduced as a sex addict, even lost himself for the game.
In the following week, they almost had not left the apartment, or more specifically, their bed. School holidays were already started, Sherlock no needed to go to school. During this period, John only left to report his duties in the army twice, the rest of the New Year holidays were spent with Sherlock.
"I really love you." Sherlock hugged John, their panting chests pressed against each other, intoxicated with the lover's smell.
The phonograph was playing a slow dance, John and Sherlock snuggling together, dancing barefoot. John was so intoxicated, very satisfied with the arrangement of this two people’s Christmas Ball.
Sherlock could fight back an offending speech to insult them as a response, to defend John, but he chose to be silent - because he knew that John would prefer him to shut his mouth up.
As dusk fell, Sherlock walked back to the dormitory, on the way he casually glancing towards to the fence, did not see the car.
"Would I?" Sherlock was looking for John's silhouette in the dark, but his face almost melted into the shadows. Sherlock watching the lighted cigarette had moved closer to him, so he opened his mouth and sucked it again.
"Yes," John closed his eyes and swallowed. When he opened his eyes, he saw Sherlock's burning gaze, and could not help but knead his hand, "should be going now..."
Sherlock looked through the clear water and found James. James looked at Sherlock with his eyes wide-opened, his face indignant, but remained a deserted calm underwater. He was like a beautiful specimen, an evil and pretty black spider specimen, was quietly nailed to the ground, slightly shaking with the moving water, as if dancing.
Sherlock had been thought that they might have a semester of time before saying goodbye, but it seemed that this winter holiday was their end.
John sighed, looked at the walking cane which leaning against the bed, his expression became gloomy again.
Sherlock shook his head, but squinted for a moment, explained, "Obviously, the restaurant owner doesn’t like the young man, thought that he would affect his business. It indicated that the young man was not coming for eating, he might want to sell his own business here. But he doesn't look like a snacks seller. If he’s not a competitor, why the restaurant owner was so angry? What business is he doing? Moreover, he is so young..."
"What?" Sherlock's eyes were shining - he really needed the job and it was his ideal job to help the police to investigate the cases.
During these days, Sherlock lived on the streets as a vagrant and met many of the lowest class of London, those beggars, prostitutes and tramps taught him so many things that the orthodox education would not teach him, like how to make a living on his own. As a result, he was now very familiar with how to use human nature to carry out illegal activities. He crosschecked all the things he learnt from the streets and from the books, complemented each other, that enhanced his ability to deduce on crimes. All this was really funny, much funnier than the boring school education, and let Sherlock's brain fully exercised and no longer depressed in boredom - except at some points, during his free time, he could not find a method to prevent John Watson invading into his mind.
"Don’t you want to get into university?" Lestrade asked, "It’s not the same as the secondary school, where you can challenge the existing knowledge, and even can develop your own set to replace it, just so long as you are justified, it’s not the game of obedience anymore. And there have so many interesting subjects: chemistry, physics, criminology, psychology..."
The apartment did not have shower facilities. John contained a large pot of hot water for Sherlock, let him stand in the dish, sprinkled him with a water spoon to help him washing his body clean. Out of the doctor's habit, he checked his opening carefully, to make sure Sherlock had not been hurt.
"Just want to add a little spice. Let's try once for warming up, otherwise, how could you know which part you'll miss me most when we separate?" Sherlock felt that James's tongue slid over him again, those hands climbed on him and undid his buttons one by one...
Sherlock stepped forwards curiously, stopping at the fence and staring at the man. John Watson opened the door and came out, looking at Sherlock who just bit his lips subconsciously but had not looked away from his gaze. John moved forwards and came to the other side of the fence.
"I have." Lestrade nodded. "He is my superior... and my friend. He has always been very concerned about you."
"You two were secondary school classmates and roommates in a boarding school." Sherlock continued to tell the facts he knew. "I had been studying in a boarding school, I could quite understand what happened between you. Did my brother abandon you for his career? That wouldn’t be completely unexpected, to know that he is in cold blood and ruthless, he can sacrifice anything for his work and the country! But you didn’t need to abandon yourself to find a woman you don’t love and got married, or you did it because of the secular prejudice? "He scoffed and continued, "Or you’re so great that finding a cover for him so that you two can continue your affair and doesn’t affect his career? Is it a political marriage so you and your wife can have affairs separately? No wonder you don’t care about your wife eloped with another man. I know Mycroft have many dirty tricks in the political field, but I don’t know he is so shameless even in his private life... "
He thought Victor was not here because the lamp was not lit, and he thought Victor would be embarrassed to see him so Victor would try to avoid him. But he heard some noise coming from the neighbouring bed, some friction sound of the fabrics, and some heavy rapid breaths - a total of two breathing sounds, two people were lying in that bed.
There would be a war? So John would go to the battlefield? The first thing Sherlock could think of was John making him more angry with himself.
They tried hard to accommodate each other, with desperate hunger and thirst, asking for the deepest resonance, and they reached their climax together.
Sherlock pouted and went back to the dorm, just wanted to kill Mycroft and Victor a thousand times in his mind. He wanted himself focus to be angry and kept cursing those two bastards, then he would have no time to think about John, to think about the chaotic and unlawful relationship they were having, to imagine they would part in a near future.
Sherlock felt inexplicable - he was never easy to make friends or to be said that he did not have friends - but John was a total stranger who tried to talk to him, and Sherlock did not feel disgusted with it.
Silence reigned in the little room, no one moved to tidy up the clothes, no one cared the mess they made, but rigid to maintain such a position, close to each other, but felt their partners were so far away.
Why Mary's looking becoming more and more like mine? Because "Mary Watson" is "marry Watson"? - Marry Watson, my most frightening thought, afraid that one day a woman will appear and marry Watson, this idea is so painful like shooting my heart.
They just stared at each other, the stunned feelings were all hidden behind their sophisticated masks.
"Are you confusing to be or not to be Mary's husband?" Sherlock still laughing, "You can choose, no one stops you. You never loved her, why be engaged with her? Her baby is not yours, why should you marry her? If all of this has nothing to do with love, why would it confusing you?”
After dinner, Sherlock found a black car had been parked near the school gate. It had been a long absence of, Sherlock thought John might want to give him a surprise - since they had been met up at the apartment regularly, the black car was seldom seen, John was not a man who liked abusing his position after all.
"This is the principle of leverage, it’s clever." Sherlock practised with chopsticks to pick, push, clip, screw, poke and other usages, John was amazed.
“Interesting.” that person turning the book pages, said with a creepy tone, "Hi, I'm James, the same university with you, major in Maths." he turned to stare at Sherlock, with two big and childlike eyeballs.
Sherlock pushed him away at the last minute, stepped back. "Don't know what you mean." He clenched his fist, did not dare to imagine that he had almost kissed a person other than John - that thought had let his stomach aching twisted, feeling so sick and disgusted.
John explained the Labouchere Amendment in the volume that could not be heard by the nearby tables, that how male homosexuals would be prosecuted by the crime of gross indecency in the United Kingdom and its colonials, no matter that sexual relationship between the two men had an agreement or not, had or hadn’t involved money, be done openly or privately, all would be prosecuted as serious crimes, and would be sentencing to punish once found.
Jealous John unbuckled Sherlock's belt fast and violently, pulled his trousers and pants down to his thighs, and then turned him over, released his own cock from trousers immediately, and pressed against Sherlock’s bottom. Although John’s prick was sliding upon his gap, Sherlock still stayed silence, so John pushed the head inside it, even under the unprepared situation, Sherlock still shut his mouth up and suffered the pain when John pushed into more. This was the first time John treated him so rudely, but he was so angry that he just spit some saliva in his hand and roughly prepared Sherlock, and then thrust into him with his whole length cruelly. Sherlock bit his lip to endured the torment, did not say a word nor made snorts, just let John fuck him hard to vent his rage, to prove a point - they had been shagging only to vent their beast-like lust, without a trace of emotion.
They both knew their relationship could only be carried out secretly, there was no future for them, so they did not talk about that by understanding, just had anything they could have now. Otherwise, they could discuss each other’s state of love life and marriage status in a more relax way.
"The failure of my marriage is not related to Mycroft. After graduated, we have been just ordinary friends and nothing more." Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "Now we only have a connection in work, he is not my direct supervisor, but count as my superior officer. That’s it."
"Police?" John looked at Sherlock in panic, not waiting for him to answer, covering his face with the blanket and turning to face the door.
In the dormitory room, Sherlock was lying in bed, head resting on arms with empty eyes staring at the ceiling, feeling bored. His roommate Victor broke into the room in a hurry and accidentally stumbled on Sherlock's luggage and things.
"Of course, it's just in private, in public they are just coworker," Sherlock took John's hand and caressing him gently, in a way that suggesting something, "like us, now we can tell others that we're flatmates." Sherlock smiled at John and wishing it would be their future relationship - lovers in private, flatmates in public.
"Um," Lestrade's voice showed that he did not believe a bit, but he did not argue with them. He only told Sherlock, "A new case. You go downstairs to me when you get dressed." then he left and closed the door.
He was very angry. He had locked it away in the deepest and most subtle corner of his mind palace. Why did those memories attack him time after time? Like the enemy bombers, why suddenly attacked our country, destroyed a town and killed hundreds of lives in just a moment?
"I am the network." James's hand continued to linger behind Sherlock. "If you join, we'll become the brain of the network. We can make fun of those stupid people as playing a nest of ants, how fun that would be?" He came closer to Sherlock's neck, smelt his smell. "We'll come up with a lot of great ideas, to play with the idiots of Scotland Yard, so much fun."
He hung the clean clothes, pulled the shower curtains, opened the shower-heads, and let the water slide down from the top to his body. This moment was the time he spent in his mind palace.
Sherlock could not help but think of what happened in the car seat: the gentle hand which was good at caressing, the hunter’s smile, and those incredible blue eyes. He remembered John Watson the stranger. Thought of the feelings when he touched Sherlock, the raising temperature inside the car, the reaction Sherlock made at that moment...
"He's sick," John tried to explain, "I'm a doctor, so he sleeps here to accommodate me take care of him."
Sherlock did not understand, repeatedly thinking about John's words - "I don't want to continue that kind of relationship now", "You knew about the letter...", "a relationship without love doesn't work"... "without love"... The premise was: John had told Sherlock he love him, but Sherlock never made the same declaration; John did not know that Sherlock had read the letter, but if Sherlock had known that before Mary appeared, that John was willing to cancel the engagement for him but still had not said a word, John would have thought that it was because Sherlock did not agree with John's decision; John had proposed to run away with Sherlock after Mary appeared, Sherlock rejected him; on the contrary, Sherlock proposed that they could continue the sexual relationship, saying that's no big deal... Deduction: John thought that Sherlock did not love him, that was why he agreed him marrying Mary; John thought that Sherlock only wanted a sexual relationship, no matter in the past or this moment he kept the same mind; "that kind of relationship" that John did not want to continue was a purely sexual relationship; John still had feelings for Sherlock, that was why he still wanted to keep the hug even though it broke his previous decision... Conclusion: "The same" meant "a relationship without love" - John on the premise that he did not love Mary and Sherlock did not love him, and John's premise is wrong.
“All right, thank you, Dr. Sherlock.” John rolled his eyes. Sherlock was glad to hear John’s familiar sarcastic tone return, as opposed to his frighteningly weak voice back at the pitch.
John stopped. He squinted at his screen. The words seemed to blur in and out of focus for about the fifth time that day. He looked back at the keys, which were out of focus too, and rubbed irritably at his eyes.
John gasped for breath as his eyes snapped open. He sat straight up and put a hand to his chest, attempting to get his breath back.
“And what about yourself?” Sherlock asked. “Any definitive plans? Aside from being a doctor, obviously.”
The doctor sat back in his chair and folded his arms. “What would you do with me, Sherlock? A blind doctor, how could I help you? What good would I be on cases? Think about it for Christ’s sake don’t make me keep spelling it out.”
John was so lost in thought that he didn’t notice how eerily close he’d been standing to the edge of a deep ravine, and his next step forward sent him slipping on the snow-covered ground and tumbling down the jagged, rock-riddled drop.
“No, you are not doing this right now. Why don’t you stop using your position in government to work your way around a diet and use it to accomplish something of importance?”
John nodded. “You’re right. You are an idiot. But…” He slowly reached out and grasped Sherlock’s hand, holding his long fingers in his smaller ones. “But I need you. And these past few weeks, I thought maybe the feeling wasn’t so mutual anymore.”
John laughed softly and wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s neck, pulling him in close. “I love you, you bloody git,” he said. He gave him a quick peck on the cheek before heading to the loo to change.  “And the movies are not terrible!” he shouted.
The one thing that John did know was that he was exhausted. The sleep that he’d had in the hospital was fitful at best; being awoken every hour or so from an ache or pain, or to take more medication. It left him feeling groggy and worn out, and all he wanted to do was have an obnoxiously long nap.
John reached an arm out and sluggishly grabbed his mug, taking a few long, slow sips before putting it back.
“Hm, I’ll give you that, yeah. You’re not going to comment on every aspect of the film as we watch it, are you?”
“Oh, er, we met at a bar last week- long story,” John said. “I asked if he wanted to come to a match the other day.”
John bit his tongue and stared daggers at his so-called friends before taking one hesitant glance up at Sherlock, who was stock still and staring in awe. Fantastic; the man who couldn’t leave a pile of cigarette ash alone because he wanted to study it was now seeing all his tattoos and probably would never stop asking questions about them.
He watched as John’s mum made John sit up and patted his back until the coughing stopped. Then she helped him drink water, and then she stuck that horrible thermometer in John’s mouth. Sherlock knew John hated that.
“I must have gotten at least a bit drunk.  I remember not being able to walk right. And I…I might have gotten a cab? No, I don’t know. The next thing I remember is being face down on a wooden floor, knowing I was about to die.” John’s voice had cracked a bit towards the end, and he brought his palm back to his face and stared at nothing in particular. His breathing was becoming a bit labored, and he began scratching nervously at his hair and tugging at his shirt sleeves.
Sherlock looked half shocked and half confused, which John supposed was better than angry or disgusted. His mouth was hanging open slightly, and for once it seemed that Sherlock Holmes himself was speechless.
“Well, you two enjoy. It was so nice to meet you, John,” Mrs. Hudson said, giving his shoulder a small squeeze before walking away.
“My bed. You should sleep in there for the first week or so. It’ll be easier on your ankle. Not as many stairs involved.”
John waved a hand dismissively. “The deduction thing. Keep ‘em to yourself right now eh? S’been a long day.”
But this, John thought, this melody was soft. Soothing. A drifting, lilting, subtle sound that flowed effortlessly through the air and into John’s ears. Perhaps Sherlock had made a breakthrough in the case and was celebrating, or perhaps he was simply playing to help him think, as he was wont to do.
Steeling himself, John got up from the floor and didn’t look at anyone as he snatched his shirt out of Tom’s now slack grip and stomped to the door.
“Well stop being sorry. We can still spend all night together. Even if you’re asleep, I’ll be here. Now, have you eaten?”
In the end, John’s team had lost by just a few measly points, and while the rest of his teammates stood around kicking their gym bags and bemoaning their loss, John couldn’t find it in him to feel bad, because it had been one of the most enjoyable games he’d played since he’d first started back in secondary school.
John was leaning up against the cold brick of the flat when Sherlock stepped outside, breathing heavy clouds of smoke into the evening air. The doctor had planned on hailing a cab for he and Sherlock, but decided against it when he realized how incredibly difficult it was to spot a black cab in the almost jet black veil of night. He knew, in the back of his head, an appointment with a doctor was an inevitable necessity, but instead he scolded the logical side of his brain and pushed those thoughts aside.
“I will actually kill you,” John said, swatting Mike’s arm with a stray takeaway menu. “Go watch your crap telly.”
The old cab driver stood stock still in the middle of the dank passageway, clearly out of breath. He held his hands up in front of him in surrender, because at the end of the alley was John, holding a pistol steadily with two hands. John had a stone cold look in his eyes, like if the cabbie were to take one half of a step closer, he’d shoot him without batting an eyelid.
“That’s not what this is about and you know it. Face it, John, you're getting older and your eyesight is not as crystal clear as it used to be. And if you don't want to keep squinting at things and stumbling over cracks in the pavement then I suggest you get over whatever little crisis you're having and
It had been a few days since John had seen Sherlock, and he couldn’t deny that he was still interested in getting to know him, despite Sherlock stubbornly refusing his help.
Sherlock continued his ministrations, massaging the sides of John’s palm, being careful not to press too firmly.
John let out an exasperated sigh, reminding himself to pick his battles. He went over and helped Sherlock to fit the laptop into the bag by simply moving a few things around. As he was zipping up the bag, he noticed Sherlock’s violin case sitting nearby.
“Sherlock! Wait!” John called out in a desperate attempt to let him know that he was falling behind. Sherlock had promised to stop going into dangerous situations without him, he’d promised not to leave him out of things like this anymore, but at this point, John doubted that Sherlock would slow down enough to allow him to catch up.
“Enjoying the view?” Sherlock’s deep, cutting voice was suddenly right in John’s ear, and he jumped back a good distance in surprise.
Another half an hour had passed with not a peep from Sherlock, and John’s anxieties about the previous night were starting to get the better of him. Thinking that he’d simply go and ask Sherlock if he’d like some tea or breakfast just to make sure that he was okay, John walked down the hall to the bedroom. He lifted his fist to knock, but found the door to be already opened slightly.
By the time John joined Sherlock in the sitting room, the taller man was already back on the laptop. Sherlock sat at the cluttered desk, tapping his foot anxiously as he typed. John stared at Sherlock for a moment, narrowing his eyes at him.
Just as John had taken another bite of chocolate and cream, there was a frantic knocking on his door that had him coughing up his mouthful of food in surprise.
Not long after John sat down, he heard Sherlock’s footfalls as he slowly made his way down the stairs. He felt Sherlock sit down next to him but made no move to look at him.
“Well, I am a doctor, in case you forgot, and you have basically just told me you haven’t eaten in a number of hours. Forgive me if it’s my instinct to do something about that.”
“You thought I’d forget about you. You thought I would forget you’d gone out, or remember too late.”
His friend didn’t respond, instead he started tossing and turning while harsh coughs continued to wrack his small frame. Sherlock was beginning to get worried when suddenly he heard footsteps hurrying up the stairs.
The look of realization that dawned on John’s face couldn’t do anything but make Sherlock smile. The detective insisted that he knew the limp was all in John’s head, and the doctor just laughed and sat in his armchair. Sherlock smiled at that too, seeing the shorter man’s hazel eyes light up as he rolled his head back in amusement. John Watson didn’t look like he wanted to leave any time soon, and Sherlock wasn’t sure he minded.
Everyone in the room was looking to John, who was still giving his medical assessment of the situation. He seemed to be taking longer than usual, and was squinting his eyes desperately at the body of the woman in front of him.
It was perfect; John’s parents were out for the night and likely not going to be home until at least midnight, and his sister was staying over her girlfriend’s, which meant that he and John had the house all to themselves.
“Oh he’s fine, dear, just a bit shaken up it seems. Didn’t finish his tea…” Mrs. Hudson trailed off sadly.
The army doctor took a deep breath and let it out as an exasperated sigh. “I can’t see you, Sherlock.”
“I’ve tried. Clearly he’s in a lot of pain,” he said, the pang of worry in his chest seeping through his voice.
John was officially at his wit’s end. He and Sherlock were going to sit down and have a talk if it bloody well killed them. It had been far too long since they’d acted like an actual couple and John was done being quiet about it.
John watched Sherlock as he slowly slipped from reality and sank into the caverns of his mind. The fire was warm and cast a soft orange glow around the room. John joined Sherlock in closing his eyes and letting his mind wander for a bit. He was somewhat loath to admit that he was actually beginning to relax. Their previous week had been full to the brim with clients, experiments, and one too many late nights filling out paperwork at the Yard. Perhaps it would be nice to take a breather for a while, after all.
The detective snarled, whipping his dressing gown angrily around him. "I was simply putting in those details about the dissected rabbit that you chose to leave out for some odd reason."
Instead of answering, Sherlock just let John have some silence. He looked at his friend and could see the hurt in his eyes, could tell he was quietly recalling the event.
John, still a little unsure of what was going on, complied and brought his legs up to mirror Sherlock’s position.
“I know you’ve got a limp, rely on the use of a cane, most likely wounded in action. I know you’ve got a brother who’s worried about you but you won’t go to him for help, maybe because he’s an alcoholic, maybe because he’s just left his wife. And I know you’re an army doctor, trained at Bart’s.”
It was a few days after John’s trip to the hospital, and he was racing around his room like a madman as he got his things together for rugby practice. He needed his uniform, his socks, his shoes- god, where was the
“Yeah, sorry, mate,” Mike said. “Well, you know where I am if you need me. If you ever need to talk or, y’know, gush about his eyes—“
John didn’t say anything. Instead he just fiddled with a stray button on his cardigan and swallowed hard.
John made a noise that sounded like he was in pain before going into a louder coughing fit, grimacing even more.
“No, no, it’s okay. I get it,” John told him. He haphazardly did up about three buttons before deciding it was good enough and hauled himself up from the bed, sending Sherlock scrambling after him.
“John?” Sherlock’s muffled voice snapped John out of his thoughts and sent a rush of hopeful excitement through his veins. He didn’t expect him to be home until two in the morning at the earliest.
“I’m at the morgue; Molly promised me ‘interesting feet,’ and I’m about to find out exactly what that entails,” he answered, sounding eager.
be more careful,” Sherlock corrected. “Though I fail to see why it matters whether we get a few bumps and bruises along the way, so long as we solve the case. That’s how this works.”
“Alright, thank you for that. Forget I asked.” John breathed. “I think I want to sleep now.” He said lazily, already closing his eyes.
Sherlock leaned his head back against the sofa and stared at the ceiling. “Oh, my family couldn’t give a toss who I sleep with. In fact I’m fairly certain my parents knew about me before I did,” he said.
“Oh my god,” he breathed, “this guy says he’d had a vision of a murder and then saw it happen? You’ve got to be kidding. Have the police spoken with him?”
Sorry if this is a bit OOC, I started writing this a while ago and have been adding to it on and off, so I'm not sure how well it will read.
And so Sherlock got his music in order and began to play. John watched him for a time through slightly hooded eyes, Sherlock’s body swaying swiftly with the music. The song sounded familiar, he must have heard Sherlock play it before at one point or another.
“So, um, anyone have any holiday plans?” Molly asked the group. “I’m just going home to see my parents.”
John stepped wearily into the tiny kitchenette just off the entryway and tossed his heavy bag carelessly onto the floor. He began rummaging through the cupboards immediately, desperate for something quick but filling so that he could eat and start his work as soon as possible. He was so wrapped up in digging for a suitable snack that it wasn’t until he turned his head to shout at Sherlock about their lack of proper food in the house that he noticed all the changes in the sitting room.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said, holding John’s gaze. John could have sworn that he saw Sherlock’s eyes flicker down to his lips, but it happened so quickly that it could very well have been his imagination.
John just grinned and took hold of Sherlock’s hand, giving his fingers a light squeeze. He led them to Sherlock’s bedroom where the two got comfortable under the duvet, quickly finding their preferred spots with Sherlock spooned up against John’s back.
And you may not believe me, but I do need you, however much my actions might lead you to believe otherwise at times. I would never want to intentionally cause you harm, physically or…emotionally. I’m sorry, John.”
John had never actually been to Sherlock’s flat before, and he was admittedly a little curious as to what Sherlock’s place looked like, mainly wondering whether or not there were various experiments bubbling away all over the flat.
Contrary to the usual cold climate in London, Hong Kong was hot and humid in summer. People became irritability intolerable because of the annoying weather. At the end of the summer holidays, Sherlock no longer needed to stay in that damn house which he did not want to stay one more minutes. He did not want to see his big brother Mycroft ’s face again.
"Sherlock ~" John shouted and moaned. Their pantings and groans resounded in the room, no matter they had already naked, still felt like it was hot as on fire.
Sherlock had already deduced John's situation - if he had any relatives, why would he find a total stranger to share the flat? It could imagine that in England he had no "home" anymore - but John's indifference still surprised Sherlock. Had the affectionate, romantic, responsible John Watson been destroyed by the war?
"It might be good for you to have some experiences, but don’t take it too seriously, just for fun," Mycroft smirked with a hateful expression.
They stared at each other, not willing to turn the eye. John struggled to crush slowly into Sherlock’s virgin opening, it was tight, and he could feel every contraction inside his body. Sherlock could only try to hold John’s back, stroking his arm, and stretching his legs as wide as possible, he had no effort to do other things.
This day, Sherlock came to the shower at non-peak hours as usual - he just did not like the crowding during the rush hour, the lack of privacy was unbearable and disgusting.
Sherlock lied back in bed, leaning towards the heat of John. John hugged him in the sleep and Sherlock clung to him, they held each other tight, kept warm in the winter with each other's body temperature.
Mary weakly looked at John and then Sherlock, with her pale face, "you..." she suddenly clung to John's arm, painfully said, "you two..." then she fainted away with cold sweat covering. John immediately held her weight and then carried her to bed.
"No, John," Sherlock smiled bitterly, "you love your country, so you becoming a soldier. You love life, so you saving lives by becoming a doctor. You love your family, your parents, so you will not hurt their feelings. Because of love, you will not betray those things, will not do it just for one person, just for me. If you did that you are not John Watson, and the rest of your life you will not be happy.
Someone who could get along with him - Sherlock thought of John for granted. Sharing an apartment with John had used to be his dream, but... Sherlock shook his head - no more daydreaming, his teenage days had passed for a long time, and now John's son would be soon a youngster... Yes, John was already someone's husband and father. Sherlock was saddened at the thought that they had not seen each other for years.
Sherlock struggled helplessly, and he did not know what was happening, just felt that John was dedicated to suck his soul, and his body was pushed by John to the bed and stumbled on the bed. John immediately covered him, with his elbows to support himself, staring at Sherlock closely, indulging in his enticing green eyes.
"You learn very fast! I practised almost a month to have learned it, and the posture even not standard."
James's voice was just like a lullaby that totally controlled and attracted Sherlock, cursed him to be a softie, and he had presented a seemingly interesting future blueprint that made Sherlock's boring life have a little bit fun...
John laughed. He looked around carefully and then used his most light voice, "Have you heard the crime of gross indecency?"
"No, it's lucky for me that they're safe, otherwise I would blame myself too. It's just... they're not my family anymore. Before Japanese occupied Hong Kong, the military received intelligence, so that a group of British Chinese soldiers disguised as civilians, mixed with the public to avoid unnecessary sacrifice. Mary and the kid disguised and withdrew with them, an officer has been taking care of them, and he is more competent than me to be a good husband and good father. When I was released and back to Hong Kong, Mary told me everything, so I divorced her, let them be together officially. Mary and her child finally found their happiness. "
Sherlock gave up to please his only brother a long time ago. On the contrary, he did anything Mycroft banned, the more Mycroft did not want him to do the more he wanted to do it. Mycroft was completely enraged and thought himself incapacitated to teach Sherlock anymore. He sent Sherlock to the most stringent boarding school, hoping that the strict discipline would tame the unruly Mustang.
When Victor was back to home on vacation, John tried holding Sherlock in his arms and sleeping with him in his dormitory’s single bed. That night, John woke up by the heat from his lower body, he found that his prick was wrapping around by Sherlock’s warm wet lips, Sherlock 's fingers already painted with paste and wanted to touch his buttocks.
"Schools are boring, I already learned all the things they want to teach me." Sherlock rolled his eyes with disdain.
Just like Mary Watson's hairstyle has changed, changed to a curly one just like mine. Even her clothes have been more and more like my style.
"We can move in right now." A gloomy desperate male voice sounded as if he was the Grim Reaper, had been back from hell, and every living thing on earth annoyed him - it was this man arguing with Mrs Hudson.
Followed by the wedding invitation is to take care of a drunken Harry. She said Clara was deceived by the bad guy and they only get married because he got her pregnant. Harry said it just like she was dating a ghost. She can't understand how the sweet good old days were gone, and her partner disappeared suddenly, only left her in the memories and cannot move on.
"Bye." Sherlock's voice did not reveal the slightest emotion. He turned to the dormitory doorway, did not turn around ever again.
Sherlock forced the moistening fog to stop, he looked up at the ceiling, hoping those tears would flow back to his eyes. Then he found that John had been slightly trembling, and his chest was wet - John was crying.
"Sherlock." John did not know what was so funny - they had just been broken the law and caught by the police. "Who's he? Why's he looking for you?"
One day they did not confess, one day they could still pretend, and kept the improper relationship as a game, easy to deal with. But when the confession was told, which meant that they had to face this relationship seriously - to choose between went together or separated. Frankly, it could only have one outcome, because living in this era, living in such a society, they could not go together as lovers.
He almost tried all drugs on the market. Like his body was just a test tube, could be poured into different chemicals, mix and match, to experiment. He did not like those made him more excited and out of control, he preferring those made him calm down and lazily lay down, then he could feel a warm dizziness - like John, like John hugging him, like them sleeping together...
It might due to the helpless feeling that I don't have any power over your situation even though I am a doctor. Let the person I've valued the most being controlled in other people's hands -  it's so threatening that made me think Dr Magnussen is a powerful man who dominates other people's lives and deaths, whose decision would affect our destiny.
"Don’t think that only you can observe, your roommate is smarter than what you imagine. At the beginning, there was a black car which would come to pick you up, then you carried on truanting and sneaked out alone, did not go back to sleep in the dormitory at night... when the dormitory was unmanned someone would come to accompany you, and would leave some blonde hairs and a 'dog tag' which only for military personnel." Mycroft stared at him coldly. "Look, the emotion would make a real mess of your brain, the proudest part of you now turned into shit."
Sherlock climbed into bed and slid under the blanket, hugged John from behind, kissing his hair and sweaty neck, hoping his own body temperature and heartbeat would comfort John.
"Indeed, many soldiers really doing this, but not included me." John smiled and looked at Sherlock, "I don’t use money to buy sex."
He might be magical, he might be a criminal genius, the star of tomorrow of London's dark forces. He had illegal intelligence, he had expanded his criminal network, he even wanted to attract Sherlock to his business. He thought he would become the new mystery that even the Scotland Yard and the British government could not solve. However, he could not predict the biggest mystery that made for him by fate - the war would rewrite one's destiny in a moment, it was more frightening than any crazy criminal, even if you were a genius still could not survive from the joke of the era.
"You go to the classroom first." Sherlock simply left a command and walked away.  With a stamp of his foot, Victor could do nothing but go to the class on his own.
"I don’t want our first Christmas - " John paused and swallowed, "perhaps the last one, would be ruined by this way."
Busy Mycroft was diligent and almighty, working all day long. Although lived with him, Sherlock might not see him once in a day. As clever as Sherlock, he learned to be independent early on, learned to solve his own problems, because his guardian is always absent when he needed him. He also thought his precocious would earn a little appreciation from his brother. But when his brother appeared, he never showed a little friendly attitude, always only severely criticized and reprimanded, as if Sherlock was an idiot. No matter how perfect Sherlock performed, in his sage brother's eyes, those were just kindergarten student’s nonsense. He just could not do anything to catch up with Mycroft’s standards.
It was then that he noticed that John had slowed his pace to a walk and was limping slightly. By the time he got to Sherlock, his head was down and Sherlock could hear his heavy, uneven breaths.
John rubbed the back of his neck nervously. “You- you didn’t have to go through all this trouble for me. I don’t—“
“You can borrow it anytime,” John joked weakly. “Well, I’m glad you’re okay. See you around, I guess.” John nodded stiffly and walked away, wondering why Sherlock’s words had stung quite so much.
John just shut the drawer and went back to his task. He came back into the sitting room a few moments later with a small plate and sat down in the opposite armchair.
“Hey, there’s been another one. Brixton, Lauriston Gardens. We haven’t been there yet, on our way right now. Will you meet us there?” Lestrade didn’t wait long for the reply, and smiled bitterly as he hung up the phone and started the car.
John shrugged and shook his head. “Nothing, just, normally this is the part where you take over and tell me exactly what I’m thinking.”
“Mycroft, he sends me away when he thinks I’m…overworked. Or for fear I might return to…old habits.”
It had been over a month since he’d been mugged in the alleyway, and he’d had to go for two more doctor’s visits, as his deteriorating eyesight was worsening at a faster pace. He could now see a sort of smallish oval of visual information in front of him, the rest clouded up and unclear. And more recently, he was starting to lose his colour perception, feeling as though someone lowered the saturation level on his vision.
John pulled back and rested his forehead against Sherlock’s, feeling comfort with those soft curls tickling his skin.
John felt as if all of the blood had suddenly drained from his face. He swallowed nervously and clenched his fists at his sides, his words caught tight in his throat.
John looked at Sherlock for a moment, confused. He’d thought for sure that Sherlock would have been going home for the holiday.
Sherlock had slowed down a bit, knowing John would be on the other side, but when he turned the corner, the sight that awaited him was not what he expected.
John could feel the weight of tacky, dried blood in his hair and down his right cheek. He moved to bring his hand up to feel around for a wound but was stopped short by the burn of rope tied tightly around his wrists.
John sighed and let his head fall into his hand. He could feel the cool sweat from his forehead on his palm as he willed his racing heartbeat to slow. This was the third time he’d woken up in such a state that night.
The detective’s head perked up like a cat’s after hearing the inspector’s yell, but he only rolled his eyes and went back to examining the blood splatter on the dry, cracked wallpaper.
“All right, just sit here and I’ll hail you a cab, okay?” John said, walking to the curb and holding his arm out.
“So, was that your brother, then?” John asked as he stretched his bag leg out and tried not to look pained.
“But you don’t acknowledge me. I mean, you do, when you need me, but you’re so far off in your own head sometimes, it’s like I can’t even reach you. And when I was lying there, at the bottom of that hill, I thought—“
John twitched a little in his sleep, his face scrunching up minutely. Maybe talking to him really would work.
At John’s words, Sherlock’s entire demeanor seemed to melt off of him. His eyes flickered back and forth as if searching John’s face for evidence of a lie.
Lestrade just rolled his eyes at Sherlock’s antics and turned to leave as he finally backed up past the threshold.
Wincing slightly as he pulled himself up, John quickly downed the pills and grabbed his crutches so he could start getting ready for the day.
“The chicken parmesan, please,” Sherlock interrupted, quickly snatching away John’s menu afterwards. “Thank you.” He handed the menus back to the waiter and gave him an attempt at a friendly smile.
It was a week later, and John, Sherlock, Mike, Greg, and Molly were all out at the bar, having a drink to celebrate the end of exams. They were all crowded around the bar as they took turns ordering another round of drinks.
“Yes, I do,” Sherlock said, scooping up a small handful of icing sugar and tossing it onto John’s face.
Instead of gently waking the doctor, Sherlock got his violin and played a shrill set of notes that was vaguely akin to a cat scratching a chalk board.
“What’s not to understand? You’ve been working an ungodly amount of hours recently and it’s making you miserable. I wanted to help. Is that…not good?”
John stepped into the café with Sherlock trailing slightly behind him, immediately spotting his friends all huddled in a booth by the window.
“I don’t like this feeling; s’not good,” Sherlock went on. John tried to ignore the lingering smell of vomit and carefully placed his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.
Sherlock silently cursed his brother and placed one arm underneath John’s neck, and the other underneath his knees. He lifted him as carefully as he could, cradling him close as he looked for an alternative way back up.
Sherlock was still determined to be helpful, it seemed. Despite his previous anger, however, John was grateful and feeling much better compared to the day before. His jaw didn’t ache nearly as much and it would probably be a lot easier to talk.
“Oh you were, were you? Then I guess you won’t mind if I test the same hypothesis on you,” John said before picking up his own handful of sugar and flinging it onto Sherlock’s face as well.
“And it was a bloody good thing you did, too. That man was doing a lot more than petty theft, I’ll tell you.”
Sherlock just let out a dry laugh and looked back at his notes. They sat in companionable silence for a while. John nibbled on his food and Sherlock scribbled on his papers and marked up crime scene photos. Eventually the doctor finished and went so far as to wash his dishes and set them to dry. Sherlock looked up at him when he sat back down again.
John looked down as if he hadn’t noticed them. “Oh,” he breathed, examining them. “Well, they’re signs of a struggle, certainly.” He concluded, scratching nervously at the sleeve of his jacket. He was still squinting a bit, and was continually trying to rub his eyes with his forearm.
“Wasn’t it?” Sherlock put his computer aside and got up to pace around the small space between the chairs. “You wouldn’t have been hurt as badly if you hadn’t been running so fast. Why were you running so fast? To try to keep up with me. And why were you doing that? Because I’d decided to bolt ahead of you and not look to make sure that you were still with me,” he said quickly.
And so Sherlock spent the rest of the afternoon whispering various facts about bees to John and thinking up all sorts of things they could do on their next pirate adventure. And after a while of talking, Sherlock noticed with surprise that he wasn’t bored at all, not even a little.
“I’ll allow the obvious avoidance of my question in this instance, only because I believe I’ve solved the case.”
He entered the dimly lit sitting room and had to squint a bit to see that yes, Sherlock was indeed reading his old medical textbooks from Uni. He shook his head in annoyance and shoved off his shoes. Before he could so much as ask Sherlock what on earth he was doing with his books, the detective shot his head up and gave John his famous once-over.
details, like the type of soil that was on the suspect’s shoes, not the name of the cat that was following you around in the victim’s home.”
Sherlock didn’t even get to the end of the post before he had to stop, unable to think about anything other than how much pain John must have been in as he typed it, and the fact that he’d tried to hide it. He set his laptop aside and was just about to go check on John when there was a tiny, almost inaudible knock on his door.
“That’s a yes. Come on.” John supported Sherlock’s wobbly frame as they walked to a stall. He set Sherlock down slowly in front of the toilet and kneeled by him, placing a hand on his back in support.
John took his hand and gave him a reassuring squeeze. “What do you think, then?” He gestured to the dance floor. “D’you want to dance?”
“See there, inspector? All it takes is a little provoking.” Sherlock smirked, and lifted his friend up a bit more as he came back to his senses.
“Look, I don’t want any trouble, alright? I’ve got no money, I swear to you, now please unhand me before I’m forced to make you.” He said, smoothly adopting his curt military tone.
The sun was just beginning to set when they arrived at the café. They sat down across from each other in their familiar booth by the window before John volunteered to go and order for them.
Lestrade had his arms crossed patiently across his chest, Sally had her hands resting on her hips in anticipation, and Sherlock was crouched next to the body of a recent murder victim, steepling his fingers under his chin, and looking at John.
“Oh, for the love of…” John trailed off as he carelessly tossed the useless phone aside. He reasoned that even if it hadn’t broken, there wasn’t a chance in hell he would have gotten a signal anyway.
“And…you probably wash your hands ten times a day ‘cause of all your experimenting, though I’m usually not around for that. And, oh, you’ve got a scar, right underneath your thumb.”
John rolled his eyes. It was just like Sherlock to spring plans on him the moment he got home from a long day at the surgery, but he had to admit, a quiet weekend in Sherlock’s cozy family home did sound rather nice.
Out of all of John’s symptoms, the one that he couldn’t quite skirt his way around was the difficulty seeing at night.
John noticed the way Sherlock’s long, spindly fingers would tighten minutely around the magazine when he seemed to be having a thought. He saw the detective actually brush stray strands of his chocolate brown hair away from his face. He ended up becoming a bit entertained with trying to determine the exact shade of blue or green that Sherlock’s eyes were. John was knocked out of his trance when the secretary told them that the therapist was ready to see Sherlock. The taller man plopped his reading material down and strode purposefully down the corridor.
Sherlock eyed John for a moment before slowly handing it over to him. It took John only a few seconds to press a button or two before he handed it back to Sherlock.
Lestrade’s heavy footfalls crunched on the pathway as he came closer. He flicked on his torch and shone it on the two of them, sucking in a breath when he saw the state John was in.
John watched Sherlock shuck off his coat and untie his scarf, wanting to argue, wanting to tell him that he didn’t need to do that, but he just didn’t have it in him. He was far too tired, and he knew that Sherlock was right, anyway.
“I need a scholarship if I’m gonna go to med school, that’s why. I had one bad day, and I’m fine now, okay?”
John clambered back down the stairs of his flat and onto the steps outside. He sat down on the cold concrete and rested his head up against the metal railing.
John changed into his PJs with a smile, thinking that this evening was exactly what he needed. But his smile soon faded as he thought about the biology exam he had coming up on Monday, and the extra shifts he’d been given at work, and the paper that he’d only written about a third of. There was still so much to do, and he only had so much time to do it.
“That’s entirely beside the point.” Sherlock reached out and slowly closed John’s laptop. “Come on,” he said, holding his hands out for John to take.
“Oh, just about every overdone, sickly sweet tradition you can imagine. Hanging small, breakable things on tree branches, covering every available surface in tinsel, decorating anthropomorphic biscuits made of gingerbread, the whole bit.”
“John.” Sherlock stopped him, sensing that John was well on his way to working himself up. “It’s all right. You’re exhausted. We’ll just watch a film and I’ll make you some tea.”
“My jacket?” John turned around to face it, finding nothing in particular that would’ve given away his relationship with his sibling.
The fire was glowing bright, sending warm orange lights flickering off the walls. John sat himself down in front of it, crossing his legs and staring into the heat.
Sherlock gasped and jumped up in surprise when John’s lips made contact, accidentally pushing John away. “Oh! Sorry. You startled me,” Sherlock said, panting.
me?” He demanded, sounding more affected not by John’s condition, but by the fact that his friend hadn’t confided in him.
And the jacket itself isn’t even that old; I’ve seen that style in shops only about a year ago, and yet it already has that much wear and tear? You wouldn’t treat an item of clothing like that let alone own something in such a state, and yet you keep it; sentiment. It’s been given to you by a close family member, my guess would be an older brother seeing as how it’s slightly too big for you.”
“Prick,” John joked, not even surprised that his friend could deduce his injuries just from how he was breathing.
“I can see the tag from here; it says ‘Harry’ in permanent marker,” Sherlock explained, keeping his voice low as if he could tell that he’d hit a sensitive subject. “And Harry could be anyone, of course; a cousin, an uncle, you could’ve gotten the jacket at a charity shop, for all I know. But it’s not been very well taken care of; the fibers on the tag are fraying, there’s small rips around the shoulder seam and multiple stains on the lapel.
After the anger coursed through John’s mind came the usual worry that something had happened to Sherlock, so he bit the inside of his lip, picked up his phone and called him.
“Seriously,” the man mocked, suddenly dragging John’s smaller form into the nearby alley and shoving him against the rough brick wall. “Gimme all you got,” he demanded.
“Hm? Oh, didn’t take long. Once I narrowed down the area it’d be in it was simply a matter of hunting and pecking. An object like this, it’s small, barely noticeable, the cabbie wouldn’t waste time burying it because who’d be looking for it if you were dead?”
The doctor sitting at the desk in front of John had a head of short brown hair and donned a pair of weathered glasses. He was scribbling something on a legal pad as John licked his lips in apprehension, and tried not to shout at the man to speak up already.
“I think I’m gonna call it a night, actually,” John said, patting Sherlock’s ankle before getting up from the sofa. He placed his mug in the sink and walked over to the hallway. “Leave some biscuits out for Father Christmas, yeah?”
It’d been in the loo of Scotland Yard, actually. Just a quick, desperate sort of thing, both of them too keyed up to kiss properly, their hands stroking each other with sloppy, jerky movements in order to get off as quickly as they could.
It was almost midnight by the time they got back to the flat. The adrenaline rush had long since worn off and John was ready to fall straight into bed.
John and Greg are on their way back home and John tries to hide an impending panic attack. This is Johnstrade because there's a special place in my heart for those two <3
“You’re hurt. I can tell by your breathing and speech pattern. Where are you?” Sherlock asked quickly.
John didn’t even bother actually looking for firewood as he trudged through the trees, barely paying attention to where he was going and muttering to himself along the way.
“Mm, we’ve all got that part hm? I only wish, Dr. Watson, that you’d come to me sooner. You’re already displaying signs of tunnel vision and night blindness.” He said as he checked over his notes.
“You should’ve said something. I’d rather not have to walk into rooms to find you clinging to Lestrade for dear life.”
Mrs. Hudson wasn’t in the kitchen, and before Sherlock could call for her, she was walking out of Sherlock’s bedroom. The detective said nothing, feeling a strange urge to keep quiet so that John could sleep.
to sleep in your flat, not to mention buy him dinner. Might we expect a happy announcement by the end of the week?”
The case had taken them to a stakeout at a billiards room, a chase through an abandoned warehouse, and a pile of paperwork in Lestrade’s office.
“Erm,” John opened his eyes a bit and looked down guiltily. Sherlock took that as meaning he hadn’t eaten anything.
Eight o’clock came and went, but John gave Sherlock the benefit of the doubt and waited a few more minutes.
As the movie went on, John’s eyes grew pleasantly tired, and he sank into an almost dreamlike state where there was nothing but soft and warm and calm.
Sherlock heard a small gasp from the kitchen and looked up in an instant. John was standing over a drawer, staring at something in disbelief.
Sherlock reached over to the coffee table and grabbed the first movie on the pile before getting up to put it in the player. He waved the DVD case behind him to show John as he was setting it up.
“It’s fine, I’m sure we’ll work it out. Eventually.” John sighed. “But what about you? How does your family feel about everything? If you want to tell me, that is.”
“That one’s for my mum, actually. I know I told you how she left when I was six, so I don’t remember her much, but she’d always tell me I was brave, usually for something silly like sleeping without a nightlight. Used to call me her little lion all the time.”
“Sherlock, I don’t…look, just drop it, alright? I’m knackered and Harry’s gonna be here soon and I’ll need all the energy I’ve got left just to deal with her, so can we please not have this conversation right now?” John sounded like he’d used all his energy just to get his words out, so Sherlock figured he may as well let the topic slide for now and let John get his rest.
By the time John reached the final step to the flat, he was exhausted. The bag over his shoulder felt like it was filled with cement, threatening to weigh him down completely if he didn’t continue moving.
John just shook his head and gathered up his dishes. He put a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder to help keep his balance as he got up, though he disguised it as a friendly pat. “Yeah well, don’t forget you’re one of them too," he said.
“Yes, we have what you might call a difficult relationship,” Sherlock said, sarcasm laced in his voice.
I wouldn't put it past Sherlock to do ballet on the dance floor lol. But anyway, I really hope you guys enjoyed this, it was a bit different for me so I was a little unsure about it, but thank you so much for reading and for leaving such lovely comments, and thank you again to notjustamumj for kindly looking this over for me! *hugs you all*
“Right. One question at a time, and I reserve the right to not explain something if I don’t want to,” John said.
John chuckled. Sherlock turned his hand over so that his palm was facing upwards and pressed both of his thumbs into the center of John’s palm, massaging slowly and gently. He then moved on to John’s fingers, where he rubbed small circles on them from top to bottom.
He pulled out his phone and held it off to the side of his thigh, trying to not make it too obvious that his attention was elsewhere. Once John saw who the message was from, he eagerly opened it and tried to keep his laughter under his breath.
"That's no excuse. My blogger is slacking, this is unacceptable!" Sherlock chuckled on his way out, "Come John, I came back early so you could make me tea."
“Come on, let’s get you out of here,” John said, holding out a hand to him. “We’ll go back to mine and get you cleaned up, yeah?”
“Does he always talk to you like that?” John pressed. “I mean I knew he was a prick but I didn’t think he sank that low.”
“I’m sorry, Sherlock, okay? I should’ve done this way earlier,” he motioned to the sitting room, “come on, sit down with me, use your inside voice,” he joked, “and I’ll, I’ll tell you everything.”
“Oh, er, it’s not bad. Guess I should’ve told you they tend to start roughhousing when they’re drunk. I just thought they would’ve been a bit more mature by now, y’know?”
“Well, clearly it’s not just about getting glasses. You’re not the type to fuss over your appearance, and even if you were, there’s always the option of contact lenses. So it’s a deeper issue, then.” He paused, carefully thinking over his choice of words. “You’re…insecure about…getting older, though I fail to see why,” he finished.
John hadn’t realized how it would feel to have someone who he cared about watch him play. He had caught himself looking to the stands multiple times throughout the game, and even though he hadn’t even been able to properly see Sherlock, just knowing that he was there had rekindled something in Johns’ chest and he played with a passion that he hadn’t done in years.
“No, it’s alright.” John got up and stretched his limbs, trying to hide his face that was now flushed red. “I think I'm gonna head off to bed anyway. Will you be up late?”
The next morning, John woke to the sound of Sherlock playing his violin. He couldn’t quite pinpoint the song in his sleepy haze, but after a moment or two of listening closer, he recognized it as one of the Christmas songs Sherlock had played the night before.
Sherlock didn’t answer and was about to rush up the ancient stairs when he was stopped by an authoritative hand from Lestrade.
“Come on, Sherlock, that can’t be true,” John said, almost to himself. A part of him simply didn’t want to think about Sherlock being alone, didn’t want to imagine him feeling lonely or isolated.
“Bit not good, yeah,” John agreed. “You’re right, though. I only really came to terms with it this year. Decided to tell my family, as well, which was a bloody disaster.”
“He forced me in with a gun to my back. I don’t really remember the stairs. There was a lot of flailing, I think. He might’ve dragged me. We got to that tiny room. It was…dark. There was some light from a window. Then he—“
He thought for a minute, realizing he must have fallen asleep to the telly the previous evening, and remembered just how tuckered out he was after they’d returned from Scotland Yard. He was usually at least awake enough to make it to his own bed, but he supposed their last case had just tired him out more than usual.
“This programme is dreadful,” he announced after watching for two minutes, not really expecting a response from John.
“That you are. C’mon, let’s go to sleep.” John lifted up the covers and let Sherlock wriggle his way under before wrapping his arms around his middle and holding him close. “And I love you too, you absolute idiot.”
“Who does?” But Sherlock already began to run off. “Sherlock! What mistake?” Lestrade yelled after him.
“No, but she does a damn good job of making me feel like it was. I mean, maybe she’s right. Maybe I should’ve—“
The doctor worried his bottom lip before answering. “I’ve got tunnel vision that’s becoming exponentially worse. My perception of colour has already begun to fade. It’s hard to focus. Sometimes things blur in and out.”
John was sat up in his bed, hand clutching his heaving chest as he tried to calm his breathing. It was just a dream, he tried to tell himself. Or maybe he was
“’Course I can walk!” Sherlock asserted. He quickly jumped up from John’s embrace and stood before fumbling like a penguin slipping on ice.
Sherlock and John danced around each other in an uncomfortable silence for the rest of the night. Sherlock made dinner, deciding to forego the pasta and make soup instead since it would be easier for John to eat.
The first touch of Sherlock’s hands to his caused him to let out a short gasp. Sherlock’s hands were warm and enveloping. The lotion smelled faintly of bergamot and made for a smooth glide as Sherlock moved his fingers along the back of John’s hand.
“You do that thing with your lips.” Sherlock tried to imitate the gesture with his own mouth but only ended up looking slightly pouty.
John turned his head to look at the chair next to his bed. Hanging over the back of it was Sherlock’s coat, Sherlock’s phone charger was plugged in to the wall, and there were two empty coffee cups sat on the counter. Sherlock must have been sitting with him all night.
going wrong whilst chasing a suspect through an incredibly dark alleyway on a frigid winter night with patches of ice littering the pavement.
Right before the larger man was finally pulled away, he landed one solid punch to the smaller man’s nose, sending him flying backwards and crashing to the floor.
“A sound observation indeed, but I want to get this information when it’s fresh in your mind. Now, tell me.”
Panic seized him at the sound of the voices, but immediately dissipated when he recognized the unmistakable timbre of Sherlock’s voice, and the ever-exasperated tone of Lestrade’s.
“Right,” John said decisively. “Right, okay.” He stoically held back any forming tears as he started to pull his shirt back on. “It’s fine. I understand,” he reassured Sherlock, in case he was even listening.
“I know you’ll be looking for a flat share. And I honestly wouldn’t mind a little help with the rent. Also, Mrs. Hudson
“John, please listen to me. I was trying to say that had I tried to go to sleep, but I hadn't realized how difficult it would be without you there. I had gotten so used to you being there, that I didn’t- I never thought that- what I’m saying is, I see now what I’ve been doing to you. For a self-proclaimed genius, I can be an absolute idiot, and I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” Sherlock’s voice was shaking slightly, and John looked to him to find his bottom lip quivering, his eyes watering.
“I mean, hell, I’m—“ John stopped himself, but the words were already out of his mouth before he could even think.
human bones in that drawer. Sometimes I don't talk for days on end, other times I don't shut up. You'll be seeing a lot of blood, violent crimes; you'll be exposed to an incredible amount of violence and action. So, what do you say?”
Sherlock let out a full-bodied laugh at that, his face lighting up in a way John hadn’t seen before. John took a moment to appreciate the sight, being careful not to let his gaze linger too long.
John laid his head back on the pillow and sighed, his ribs aching slightly with the action. There were a myriad of questions swirling around in his head, but before he could gather the mental strength to try to remember what had happened, the door to his room swung open and Sherlock strode in, stopping short when he saw John.
When the investigation-cum-therapy appointment was over, Sherlock and John flagged down a cab and hopped in, grateful for the warmth inside that combatted the chilled air of winter.
Sherlock couldn’t deny the growing worry that crept up on him after following the footprints for almost thirty minutes and not seeing nor hearing any sign of John.
He sat down in an adjacent chair by his flatmate. “You haven’t finished your blog.” He said. “I believe the next thing that happened was that dog following you around, remember? Just like that cat. Evelyn, was it? Bit of an odd name for a cat.”
I don’t know why I always keep these two accounts so separate, but my tumblr is bbcbluebell if anybody wants to come over and say hi!
John was just relaxing even more into the sofa when he felt Sherlock shiver next to him and saw him cross his arms over his chest. He was clearly starting to feel somewhat chilly, which made John realize that he was actually feeling fairly cold himself.
John stared at his phone screen for a few more moments in anticipation of a reply, but when none came he assumed that Sherlock had already dashed off to the kitchen and was hard at work experimenting with butter to sugar ratios.
“Well you were mugged, obviously. Your watch is gone. You never go anywhere without it; your father got it for you for Christmas two, no, three years ago, and it was stolen tonight. But the real mystery here isn’t how you got roughed up but rather why you couldn’t defend yourself. Clearly this thug wasn’t trying very hard or he would’ve snatched your phone too. But how did he catch you off guard? Normally you’re so—“
John only covered half of his face with his hand and closed his eyes. “I said not right now, Sherlock. Can you switch off for one night, just for me, please.” His voice was barely a whisper by the time he’d finished.
John opened his mouth to retort but stopped when he saw Sherlock simply roll his eyes and let out a tired sigh.
Sherlock kept his eyes cast downward as he spoke. “I thought I might get that out in the open now in case you disapprove of such things.”
Sherlock entered the dilapidated room with a rush of adrenaline, high on the fact that he was the first on the scene, finally ahead of Anderson. He leaned the thin fluorescent lamp in the corner and flicked it on.
Sherlock’s eyes fell gently closed as he played, and the lines on his face softened, giving him an air of contentment that John had never seen in him before.
Sherlock’s return to the sitting room snapped John out of his wandering thoughts, and he watched as Sherlock set down a small bottle of lotion and a flannel onto the coffee table. He had taken his suit jacket off and rolled up the sleeves of his dress shirt.
John turned on his side to face the wall and closed his eyes tightly as if he could force himself to sleep just by closing his eyes tightly enough. But John’s face quickly softened when he heard the tendrils of music flowing up from downstairs. Sherlock must be working on those compositions, John thought.
After a good forty-five minutes of spotty conversation and barely eaten alfredo pasta, Sherlock saw a black cab slow to a stop in front of the restaurant. His eyes widened, and John looked out the window behind him. They both tried not to stare at the cabbie at the same time.
“Did I ever tell you about the time when I was five and a golden retriever stole my sandwich?” Greg asked, throwing John completely off guard. He tried to take another deep breath and focus on what Greg was saying.
“Yes, alright.” John absently rubbed his thigh and stared unfocused at the fire. “Let’s just…move on now, yeah? Mostly because these pain pills are wearing off and I’m bloody starving to boot.”
It was the middle of the night, sometime around three in the morning, and Sherlock had just finished one of his favorite pieces on his violin. He had needed to think, and the instrument was doing a wonderful job of clearing his head, of course until he heard what sounded like pained screaming from upstairs.
“And finally, on ten, open your eyes.” Sherlock waited a moment, not only for John to take another deep breath, but to make sure that Lestrade sensed that was his cue to quit prying.
, remember?” He snapped, shaking his head before Sherlock could answer and retreating back to his tea making.
“Yes, my parents weren’t exactly pleased with my disinterest in the holiday considering their rather large obsession with it.”
Lestrade entered the room in a bit of a tizzy, seeming slightly dazed as he noticed how neat the place was looking. Before the man could get a word out of his mouth, Sherlock put a finger to his lips, telling him to shush. He stepped forward so that he could talk to Lestrade quietly.
“Give us a minute, yeah? Okay, I dare you to take off your shirt, and leave it off ‘til you get back to your flat!” Greg said, chuckling and basking in the laughter of his mates.
He sighed wearily and sat himself down on the sofa. He really should have just gone to bed, but he supposed that there was no way of avoiding Sherlock’s questions about his tattoos, so he might as well get it over with now.
John was gently feeling around her arms with latex gloved-hands and filing away the information he gathered. He felt the absurd amount of gaudy jewelry on her wrists, her most likely diamond necklace, and the fact that she had no wedding ring. He then felt the material of her clothing, recognizing it as silk, high quality, if he was right. She had earrings in, her hair felt smooth, and most importantly, John could smell a perfume on her that he recognized. He was certain he’d been with at least three women who wore the same smell out on dates. He sat back on his heels and cleared his throat.
The sun was going down outside the windows of the flat, but John was determined to finish the blog entry, even if it took him all night.
Please read: Because every chapter is completely unrelated to the previous one, I'll be putting the trigger warnings for each story in the chapter summary so please be sure to read those beforehand.
“I love you as well, John.” He moved in closer until their legs were touching and this time placed his whole hand on top of John’s heart, the heat from his palm spreading fire through his chest. “But I never thought you felt the same. How did I not see it?”
The last thing on John’s mind that night was sleep, it seemed. He stayed up and stared at the discoloured ceiling, only vaguely aware of the time passing. His old bed was smaller, so it didn’t feel as empty. He thought that maybe he should sleep in there more often.
“You are many things, John Watson, but boring has never been one of them,” Sherlock said, looking him straight in the eye. And before John could get another word in, Sherlock was swooping in to kiss him.
After a long and arduous trek up the stairs to the flat, John headed straight to his armchair to rest for a moment. He leaned his head back and closed his eyes, trying to ignore the residual ache in his chest and the scrapes on his wrists that still stung somewhat.
but it didn’t come out. Were Sherlock’s hands so cold that he didn’t want to at least hold him? Put an arm around him? He used to do that at the beginning, didn’t he?
John tried to hold back a nasty frown in front of the doctor. He knew these things already, of course, as part of his loathing of being a patient was constantly being told things he already knew.
“Wow, that’s…yeah.” John sighed. “Me and Harry don’t get on, never have. She’s always been a bit of a wild card.”
The army doctor managed to get in a few jabs then, while the man was distracted with tucking the watch away. His hits weren’t very effective, however, and it only sent the man into another fit of rage as he got up and pelted John in the chest repeatedly with his heavy boot-covered foot.
It’s ridiculous to think about the murder plot at the wedding. Would anyone plan to kill by such a stupid method - a blade that delays bleeding? But if it is a metaphor, let someone got into your heart when you didn't realise, so when that person pulled out, you would hurt to die - that sounds reasonable. (So that is a romantic relationship?)
James dropped the book, jumped down from the table, came to Sherlock and invaded his private area without hesitation, he put his hand on Sherlock's shoulder casually and whispered to him, "I’m your fan, I know you solved several cases for Scotland Yard - those were the kind of puzzles that most people can’t solve.”
This... was really a surprise! - Sherlock never liked Christmas, because his home did not have a little festive atmosphere, his family treated Christmas like a routine, just better than none, but could not count as happy, let alone have surprises.
"Sherlock... " When John's pants were pulled down, he trembled with the temperature of the air but then immediately felt how moist and hot inside Sherlock's mouth. John's hands helplessly clutched the sheets and groaned. "don't……"
Sherlock was hooked on this psychedelic feeling, which allowed his mind to relax, not thought about John.
Sherlock suddenly felt a burst of fury, he held his breath, only to avoid a bruising encounter broke out immediately. After a deep breath, he reluctantly got on the car. As far as the door closed, Mycroft sneered.
“God, having an affair with a soldier, Sherlock? Are you kidding me?" Mycroft said with his favourite dramatic mocking tone.
John was still taking action. He spread his palm, fingers flirt into Sherlock's fingers, so that their fingers intertwined closely, full of sexually suggestive kneading. Sherlock swallowed, closed his eyes, listened to the sounds of the outside environment in the high-speed traveling.
When Sherlock losing in the upside-down world, John’s fingers retreated and replaced by his cock, and thrust inside Sherlock hardly. The two connecting bodies tangled on the floor, John’s pounding draw the momentum of them moving from the doorway to the centre of the room. John buried himself hard into Sherlock, harder and harder in every thrust as if he were going to get into Sherlock's heart, to become one with him. Sherlock braced himself for the pounding, the pleasure made him forgotten the hard cold floor behind him, he only felt the breath and the heat of the man who laid on him, and the dazzling sense of satisfaction because of the deeply connection they were forming.
Rio put his clothes on and accepted the money, "thank you," he kissed his partner, "call me next time!" he winked at Victor, left the room and closed the door.
Sherlock was a little bit absent - too much, it’s too much of a sudden. He did not know where he is, now what to do - as if this is not a deal? John borrowed Sherlock’s body to meet his sexual needs, he borrowed John's body to do sex experiments, this was fine, this was fair, easy to deal with. But now, what were they doing now?
"How could he be? He has no friends!" Victor replied quietly, then suddenly turned and asked, "Sherlock, would you mind?"
Sherlock cuddled John from behind, pressing tightly against him, hoping John would be warmed by his body heat. "What happened to you?"
"What?" Sherlock suddenly remembered the letter that John wrote to Mary to get rid of their engagement - if John had not destroyed it before he got married... "She discovered the letter?"
The car was finally parked in front of the Peninsula Hotel which was full of Christmas decorations, the driver opened the door for them, and Mycroft led to the hotel lobby at once. Sherlock and John were following him but fell behind on purpose, when they had a distance with Mycroft, John hold Sherlock's hand quietly, but Sherlock immediately broke it, and then coldly glanced at John, speeding up the pace to catch up with his brother.
A woman had a child and an unhappy marriage, who was blonde and cheating her husband. The baby is a girl and the name started with R.
"Why did you trust me?" After everything was done, Sherlock was staring at Lestrade on his way home.
Baker Street still the same as you are living here. Of course, you maybe wake up anytime. If you come back and find something wrong or missing here, you would be furious and I'm afraid I or Mrs Hudson would be blamed, and our poor wall most likely would suffer again.
"Sherlock," John helplessly looked at Sherlock, his eyes watery. "You wouldn't want me... the present me..." He closed his eyes. "I can't even walk without the cane."
"So here is the famous red light district, maybe the soldiers’ favourite place?" Sherlock disdained and scoffed, "Lonely soldiers far away from home, seeking prostitutes to comfort their lost souls."
The puff of one student reminded him of John Watson. He began to fantasize that the moaning one is himself. Behind the shower curtain, hugged doing the ulterior affair, he and John Watson.
John was under him with a red face, voicing out an erotic sound caused by his thrusting, Sherlock saw the vulnerable John the first time, through John's eyes he saw the fragility of his soul - for preventing Sherlock's wound worsened, during this period, John let Sherlock be the top, which made Sherlock see a different scenery, he saw the predator John Watson’s weak side. John was not always omniscient, always the experienced one, in the field of sex he might be, but in the emotional field, he was easily injured, he would be afraid and at a loss.
The car had been driven onto the car ferry which bound for the Kowloon Peninsula slowly - It was the opposite route of Sherlock and John’s first met, and the day now turned to the night, their mood also formed a huge contrast with the previous one - the flirtatious chatting now became embarrassing silence, and the curiosity and kindness now only left to be cold and strange.
Hong Kong was a hot and humid place, often had storms, and it was really not a good time to had it now - in the evening which Sherlock and John made an appointment.
Too many unlikely things. Such as the lost train and the terrorist attack on the abandoned station, both would be too stupid to plan. Heart-shaped bomb with a simple switch to turn off the explosion? it sounds like a prop from a reality TV show. And the countdown stayed at 1:29...
"Sherlock!" be slapped across the face, Sherlock forced himself to open his eyes, he had injected heroin and slept past in a dirty lane next to trash cans.
And the fictional Abominable Bride - why with a gun? Why wearing a wedding dress? Why is her image overlapping with Mary Watson in my mind palace? Why did I finally find out that the "bride" was played by multiple women?
taking drugs because the Scotland Yard would not use any clues and evidence provided by a drug addict.
"It doesn’t matter, do it according to your usual habits, as you do to other women or men." Sherlock looked at John with a proud and unyielding expression.
"Sorry, I am so excited to meet my fellow countrymen here, perhaps make you feel presumptuous." The officer smiled a little shyly, somewhat less in tune with his majestic uniform. He even seemed a little bit lovely childish when he smiled. "Especially young people like you are very rare. Most British come here to work, about business or political, all are wily old birds, seem so nasty.”
They tried to borrow a car from John’s troop and drove it to the barren landscape of the Peak, lying on the picnic rug, shagging under the starry sky. Being a part of the universe, covered by the sky and leant on the earth, Sherlock was fascinated by that primitive feeling - as if back to the beginning of the Genesis, everything in the primitive state, the first time humans discovered the fun of shagging; as if it’s a scientist’s field trip, he supposed to be here to observe the behaviour of the stars and other objects in space, but he took the time to make love with his lover instead.
Mycroft, nasty Mycroft. Always so well-dressed and polite, made you think that he might be a saint who would never make mistakes. All times business-ridden, as if missing him the world will stop running - maybe this was true.
Walking with the crutches was still a tad awkward, but John got in the door just fine. And it might have taken him a lot longer than he would’ve liked, but he managed to make it up the stairs without a hitch, as well. And Sherlock really hadn’t needed to watch him as he climbed up. Honestly, it was just a sprained ankle and some bruises; it wasn’t that big of a deal.
“He’s nobody. I’ve only just met him. He’s helping me solve this case and then he’s going home. Is that quite alright with you, Mother?”
John chuckled and got up to move to the sofa, patting Sherlock’s ankle in a silent request for him to move it.
“How would you know?” Seb sneered, a smug grin plastered on his face. “What, have you gone gay as well? You’re on his team now, are you?” he goaded.
“Oh, my god. That was…that was insane,” John chuckled. “This has honestly been the most interesting week of my life. Jeez, I actually…I actually think I want to write about this, in that god forsaken blog my therapist keeps ranting about.”
Slowly and carefully, John turned himself to lie down on his back and fished his phone out of his pocket with his right hand. He pressed Sherlock’s name and prayed that he would pick up, thinking that Lestrade would be his next best option if Sherlock failed to answer.
John took Sherlock by the hand and pulled him onto the dance floor, earning a few winks from his friends as he went.
John’s heart sunk in his chest at the sight. Sherlock must have left while John was still sleeping. Perhaps Sherlock could read minds, after all.
“Go check on Hamish,” John deflected. Sherlock knew that John loathed to be seen in such a state, but he would have to deal with it for now.
When moments passed without even a gasp of shock from Sherlock, though, John had to swallow back his fear and raise his head to look at him.
John looked up to the ever-blinking cursor on his computer screen, feeling almost as if it were taunting him. He had been attempting to type up his and Sherlock’s latest case for almost an hour, but the return of the tremor in his hand had been impeding the process the whole way.
John looked back down at his hands after Sherlock left the room. His left hand was staying still in his lap, his fingers curled inward. He knew that if he kept his hand in this position, it wouldn’t shake, but if he were to uncurl his fingers, the trembling would start almost immediately. He thought that maybe it’d somehow be easier to learn how to use his right hand for everything rather than struggle to control his left one.
“Apparently Sherlock had made some kind of…deduction about the man cheating on his girlfriend, which I don’t think he took very well,” he said. He settled on some slightly dodgy leftover takeaway and sat himself down at the table, listening as Mike pushed himself up from the sofa and joined him in the kitchen.
John made a ‘hmph’ noise and pushed himself up into a sitting position. He rubbed at his stiff neck and stretched his back, eliciting a series of satisfying cracks that he knew always grated on Sherlock’s nerves.
John pressed play on the file, already having a hunch as to what it was, and his suspicions were confirmed when the sound of Sherlock playing his violin came through the phone.
“Didn’t know you liked sport, unless you just came down here to stare at a bunch of blokes’ arses, eh?”
John figured Sherlock must have gotten Mycroft his absolute favourite type of cake, because he was swiftly set up with everything he needed to learn braille, along with a collapsible walking stick, and even a very expensive braille display system that could be hooked up to his computer, enabling him to navigate it on his own. The fact that he’d still be able to update his blog and read books online lifted some of the weight off his shoulders.
The doctor licked his lips in thought and figured he may as well give it a try. “Okay, uhm,” he started, feeling the dry, cracked skin of Sherlock’s palm. “well your hands are very dry, that’s really bad, there’s moisturizer for these things y’know,” John noted.
Surprisingly, Sherlock went about making his own cup of tea as the shorter man sulked at the counter. The detective pointed to the pile of glass still sitting by John's feet on his way into the sitting room.
The acrid smell of blood filled Sherlock’s nose as he turned John’s head as gently as possible, making John let out a low groan. It was clear that John had hit his head when he’d fallen, and Sherlock sincerely hoped that the tacky blood sticking to John’s hair made the injury look much worse than it actually was.
To John's surprise, Sherlock ended up coming home about ten minutes after their call. He practically scared the daylights out of John who had begun to doze off in his chair, when he came pounding up the stairs and bursting through the door.
“John,” Sherlock tried again, poking his shoulder lightly. “John, I wanna play pirates,” he told him. “Stop being sick so we can play,” he said grumpily. Maybe if he kept talking to John, eventually he would wake up.
“I heard your bed squeaking, which could have meant that you were either masturbating or having a nightmare, but given the circumstances, I—“
Sherlock had gone out on a case in the morning, one John hadn’t been able to join him on because of work, but he’d told Sherlock to swear that he’d be home by eight o’clock at night.
John had just left his last lecture for the day and was on his way back to his flat to get a bit of revising in before rugby practice when his phone buzzed in his pocket. He shuffled his books to his other arm and fished out his phone to find a text from an unfamiliar number.
"John... " beside those endless kisses, Sherlock used his hands to touch and caress John, plus the friction their body rolling against each other, he needed to turn John Watson on.
When Sherlock saw the great despair in John's eyes, he knew it was all his fault and he hated himself. He wanted to kiss away the sorrow and wrinkles on John's face, so he started kissing John. He needed to kiss the despair and helplessness away from John.
"Call me John." John smiled and pulled the chair for her gentlemanly. Sherlock was disgusted at the way John tried to please his family.
But he still followed Mrs Hudson into the apartment and have a look around - a large kitchen for him to do any experiment with, two armchairs in the living room with a warm fireplace, elegant and comfortable home layout, just like his dreaming apartment 221b, the only fly in the ointment was... the one who supposed to live with was gone.
It was not the first time that Sherlock encountered this kind of things. In the past, he was extremely disgusted with such activities, only found it unclean and dirty, thought it was a beast-styled unwise behavior. He would wash quickly and sharp left at the time, as he had no interest eavesdropping someone else private affairs. But today, he looked down at himself and found he half- erected.
Seemingly, Mary just found that there was another person in the room, stunned, and then so frightened that she needed to hide behind John. "Ah, you have a friend here? Sorry, I don’t know..."
Chatting was disconnected into silence when the car suddenly bumped a bit in a narrow and steep road, the two were thrown while exclaiming together, then their hands both fell on the seat. With an unexpectedly rapid heartbeat, Sherlock had a dizzy feeling - he tried to focus on the window and found a pair of hot gazes staring at himself from behind by the glass reflection. Sherlock felt John's hand moving closer on the seat, his little finger stuck to his, waiting for a while, his two fingers swept the back of Sherlock's hand, lingering the gap between his last two fingers, swept into the deepest, and then slowly gently penetrated into it, as if implying another body part, doing a very taboo behavior. Sherlock did not move, just looked at the window outside.
Sherlock took in a deep breath of the bitter, chemical-laden air of the hospital room and wished that he knew what to do. Muffled, tinny voices were coming from the small television hung in the corner of the room, and Sherlock looked up at it for the first time since he’d been there, hoping it would serve as some sort of distraction.
John sighed and bit his toast a bit more aggressively than was necessary. “D’you want the truth, then, Sherlock?” he asked.
“Well, I was gonna join to help pay for uni, but then I got a scholarship here, so it wasn’t really an issue anymore.”
After having a quick shower and skipping a shave for the time being, he carefully got dressed in some jeans and a comfy jumper and padded into the kitchen for some breakfast.
“He’s not answering!” Hamish told him. This was why Sherlock was hesitant to let Hamish help; John could get either extremely quiet or extremely swear-happy when he was in pain, and he wasn’t sure he wanted Hamish to be around for either of those possibilities.
“Wait, so he’s the murderer then? The man you just sat across from, he murdered that man in the alley because Terry had visions of a man being murdered in an alley?”
“No, I love it,” John reassured. He looked around the room, biting his lip and looking at all the effort and time that must have gone into planning this evening. “I guess I just…don’t understand.”
John happily tucked into his meal and proceeded to give Sherlock an enthusiastic play by play of his rugby match in between bites of shrimp and noodle. Sherlock told him that one of the players on the other team had had a weak knee and that one of them had recently gotten over an ankle injury of some kind, which was of little use now that the game was over, but was still interesting to hear how Sherlock had worked the information out.
“Or the night before that?” Sherlock asked as he reached for the case file and a pen and settled into his chair.
. And don’t think ‘cause I’m indisposed that I can’t nag you to eat dinner. I can order Chinese right from my chair, y’know.”
“John,” Sherlock repeated, his voice coming in louder that time. He must have still been sitting across from him this whole time, John thought.
John shook his head. “Nice try. It’s a little late for that, though.” He got up and walked past Sherlock, heading for the stairs up to his old bedroom.
“No, no it isn't. Just don't go chasing after any armed criminals today, okay?” he asked, turning around to face the other side of the bed.
John shifted awkwardly in the sad attempt at a comfortable chair and clenched and unclenched his fists.
After a quick dinner and a shower, John went to gather his things from upstairs as it was almost time for he and Sherlock to get going.
“Well, these aren’t gonna finish decorating themselves.” John motioned to the slightly misshapen biscuits scattered across the table.
Then, John began to stir even more; maybe he was finally waking up. Sherlock smiled, but John began to cough, short little hiccups that made him groan quietly in his sleep.
Sherlock and John had spent almost the entire day together, and Sherlock hadn’t acted any different than usual, making all of John’s anxieties from earlier that morning seem to fade away, and he ended the night feeling more relaxed and content than he had in a long time.
John hadn’t felt Sherlock’s lips on his in what felt like ages, and he couldn’t stop himself from eagerly kissing back, taking in the taste of him as if for the first time all over again.
The doctor immediately looked up to find the form of Lestrade outlined in a fuzzy blur. “Yes, fine. Allergies.” He lied.
He narrowed his eyes. “I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. My guys did a sweep of the place while we were upstairs. There was nothing.”
“Lestrade,” he greeted, only then realizing that he’d been breathing heavily. “I’ve got your suspect, handcuffed to a tree, in fact. I’ll tell you where he is and you can send your team to go and fetch him. I may need your help getting John back to the inn.” He looked down with a grimace at his friend. “And I’m going to need you to phone an ambulance.”
“Well, I’d actually rather not talk about—“ John started, but was cut off when the alarm on his phone started to go off. “Shit, practice starts in ten minutes,” he said, scooping his things into his bag in a flurry before practically jumping out of his chair. “Thanks for, y’know, helping me revise and everything,” he said as he slid his jacket back on.
Even with John’s quick reassurance of his stability, Sherlock helped him up from the floor and wrapped a supporting arm around his waist.
“I’m so tired, Sherlock. I know tonight was…we were gonna, y’know,” John mumbled, looking guiltily at the floor. “But I can’t. I’m so bloody knackered.”
“Yes, but he hasn’t got much time. The poison must take a certain while before it sets in. God, this is brilliant.”
“This had better be important, Lestrade,” he bellowed to the empty air as he approached the door, “I was right in the middle of—“
The ride back to Baker Street was quiet. John focused his weary eyes on the buildings floating by outside the cab window while Sherlock tapped his foot incessantly and fiddled with his phone.
“I’m not. Technically. I’m a consulting detective, only one in the world, I invented the job. Which means when the police are out of their depth, which is always, they consult me.”
“Hey, um, sorry about Seb, by the way,” John said, his voice low. “I really didn’t think he’d say any of that stuff.”
He opened up his eyes when he heard the telltale thump of a glass being set down on the coffee table.
John’s smile quickly fell from his face when he turned to see Sebastian Wilkes making his way toward them.
Without words, Sherlock sprang up from his chair and went into the kitchen. He filled a glass with water and set it down in front of John. He then took the afghan from the back of the armchair and started setting it on the doctor’s shoulders.
“Anytime, John. M’glad you’re okay. But if you ever need help again, I’m just a call or text away, yeah?”
John worried that by the time Sherlock realized something was wrong it’d be too late. He worried about hypothermia. He worried about the pain in his leg. He worried about the cut on his head. He worried until he lost consciousness completely.
John padded over to the small kitchen and rooted around in the fridge in search of a proper dinner, finding nothing but a disappointing amount of empty shelf space.
“Sort of, yeah,” John sighed. “I want to show you, but Sherlock, I..” he trailed off, looking Sherlock in his ice blue eyes. Those gorgeous eyes stared back at him with such innocent curiosity, and in that moment John decided to hell with his doubts and fears; he would have to tell Sherlock eventually and there really wasn’t going to be a better time than right now. “Okay, you can see it, but just let me explain. No deducing this time.”
“I'm sorry, by the way, about earlier," John said. "I didn’t think talking about what happened would set me off like that. It’s just…”
“All right, all right, now get off!” John released his hold on him and Seb scrambled to push himself off the ground. He brushed himself off and stared daggers in Sherlock’s direction.
Sherlock looked to John and frowned at the deep purple and red bruising that crept along John’s jawline, leading up to the now bandaged cut near his temple. The bruising made it difficult for him to move his jaw, making it a challenge to eat and speak. The worst of John’s injuries, however, was his ankle, which he’d severely sprained when he’d fallen. He was going to have to wear a brace and use crutches for a solid few weeks, which Sherlock knew John was dreading since John loathed inactivity almost as much as Sherlock did.
Swallowing hard, John left the room and made a beeline for his phone with the intent of texting Sherlock to ask him where he was or if he was okay, when suddenly he heard the sound of someone coming in to his flat.
“I’m really sorry. I normally don’t do this,” John tried to reassure, with his voice shaking a little.
Sherlock sat down in a cross-legged position in the middle of the sofa and motioned for John to do the same.
But no, that wasn’t it. He was fine, Sherlock was fine; there was nothing different about the two of them sitting together now than when they would sit and watch telly together. Well, except for the fact that John was about to take off his shirt.
John narrowed his eyes in frustration as he tried to make his way down the more dimly lit streets surrounding the flat. The areas with the shops and restaurants were obviously easier to navigate, but once the lights faded, so did his ability to make out shapes and figures.
John didn’t look like he wanted to argue, so he pulled he blanket a bit tighter around his shoulders and sat back.
Sherlock nodded and motioned for John to take a seat in one of the armchairs. John winced a bit as he sat down, still looking around the place in wonder.
Lestrade let out a frustrated sigh and zipped up his blue plastic suit, following in Sherlock’s footsteps.
John heard the sudden crack of bone on bone and immediately ran around the corner to see Sherlock on the ground holding his hand to his nose while Seb stood over him with a still curled fist. John didn’t even think as he rushed in and tackled Seb to the ground before he could land another punch.
Sherlock didn’t answer. Instead he completely ignored John’s outstretched hand as he got up and walked away.
Greg, Mike and Tom were already more than a bit tipsy, and John could tell that Sherlock, who was sitting reluctantly next to him, was not amused. Sherlock hadn’t really wanted to join them, but John promised if he tagged along just this once that he’d let him keep one extra body part in the fridge that month. What he hadn’t mentioned, however, was that he really just wanted to spend as much time with him as possible, since he’d be leaving for the army in just a year’s time.
“Well, you were severely dehydrated, which caused your veins to be significantly smaller, thus making it harder for the nurse to find a good place to insert the IV, which of course—“
Sherlock’s retort was cut off by a loud groan coming from the sitting room. Hamish let out a short gasp and was about to run off to John before Sherlock caught him and held him back.
John was only half listening to the rest of the detective’s slew of deductions, as he was too busy smirking at the fact that Sherlock had actually said ‘us.’
“Well, when you saw the car you weren’t afraid, you looked more annoyed. So it wasn’t anyone threatening. Then you called whoever owned it nosy, and no offense but you sounded a bit childish. The fact that you didn’t want me to meet them, so, something personal. I could hear your muffled voices and then I knew it was a man, and to be quite frank it sounded like immature bickering. Also he’s got a fancy car, and by the way you dress you seem like you come from a pretty well off family, so yeah.”
The line rang out a few times, making John wonder if she was going to answer at all before she finally picked up.
“Are you, I dunno, are you…okay?” John asked. He couldn’t help but notice the large, plum-coloured bruise that painted Sherlock’s cheek.
John knelt down on the floor and reached his arm under his bed. He pulled out a small box that was wrapped in brown paper and tied up, somewhat messily, with string.
“Yeah, I know,” he chuckled softly. ”But you get the idea. I can’t help it, Sherlock, these thoughts just happen, sometimes.”
It took close to fifteen agonizing minutes for Lestrade to finally reach them, in which time Sherlock had attempted to get some sort of response out of John, but it was to no avail with John sluggishly drifting in and out of consciousness.
whose love for hurt!John always inspires me to write! You guys should go and check her blog out too! ^^
John quickly wet a nearby tea towel and held the side of Sherlock’s face in one hand to keep him still. As John carefully wiped away the remaining sugar, he suddenly couldn’t help but notice the sheer warmth of Sherlock’s skin beneath his palm, the soft brush of his hair as it curled around his fingers, the shape of his lips that were even more unique up close.
“What good would I be to you, Sherlock?” He asked, his voice quietly shaking. “When five, ten years from now you’re still running around like a mad man and I’ll be trailing too far behind, not able to keep up with you. I know my limp was psychosomatic, but my leg still aches from time to time, and the pain in my shoulder, I swear it gets worse every few years. I just…” John looked away, tears welling reluctantly in his eyes, “I don’t want to hold you back.”
“Difficult?” John shot back, suddenly taking on a tenser undertone. “I’m going bloody blind, for Christ’s sake!” he practically shouted, his voice breaking a bit at the end when he realized that was the first time he’d officially stated his situation, having not even admitted it to himself. He squeezed his eyes shut and put a palm to his face.
“You’ve had exactly four shifts in the past week and a half; that’s not exactly the dictionary definition of ‘swamped,’ as you put it.”
The sound of soft knocking on the front door broke Sherlock out of his thoughts. He didn’t even have to think about it; it was John. Sherlock could always tell who was at the door based on how they knocked.
John was sitting in the lecture hall, leaning back against the creaky wooden seat and twirling a pencil in his hand. He was only half listening as his professor continued to repeat the same few points he’d made earlier but in a slightly different way.
John’s mum rushed in and then it was a flurry of activity that sent Sherlock jumping out of his chair to stand by the door.
"Oh, right, 'cause that's just what our readers need, you plowing on about all the things my inferior mind missed."
“That you’re not going to be able to focus if you’re running on three hours of sleep,” John answered.
John turned his head and let out a breathless laugh. “Jesus, Sherlock, I’m not twenty years old anymore, okay? And yes, ‘obviously,’ I know, of course I know that. But this...it’s like a flashing reminder that pretty soon it’s not gonna be just my eyes, it’ll be my shoulder or my leg, or my bloody hand that still shakes sometimes, and then—“ he stopped short, putting a hand to his forehead and taking a deep breath.
John laughed and shoved Sherlock playfully, feeling an almost childlike glee that he’d forgotten was even possible to feel.
“Yeah, good. Much better,” John said weakly. He had been in the hospital for a few hours but had only been awake for about one. “This bloody thing hurts like hell, though.” He motioned to the IV stuck in the crook of his arm.
There wasn’t much in the cupboards save for a few bags of crisps and some biscuits. The refrigerator held more promise, however, and John managed to put together sandwiches for the two of them. He cut his sandwich in half and Sherlock’s into fours, because after living with him for so long, he realized that Sherlock was much more likely to eat something if it was small and could fit in his hand.
“Oh come on, you with your bloody bee studies all over the place, your chattering on about how you’re gonna keep bees when you retire, not to mention the amount of honey you—“
“Tell me again why we needed to do this as soon as possible,” John said as he followed Sherlock on their way to the first shop he wanted to check.
John laughed under his breath, feeling his mood lighten despite the heavy workload still ahead of him.
John did let a small chuckle escape, then, earning him a disapproving glance from the girl sitting next to him. He tried to think of something Sherlock could do to relieve his boredom, and if he weren’t otherwise occupied, John would have suggested they hang out for a bit. Although, John thought, his lecture would be over in just another twenty minutes, and he really didn’t have much else on for the rest of the day.
Mrs. Hudson frowned and turned to John. “John, you’ll tell me. What’s he gotten himself into this time?”
John had spent the entire rest of the afternoon at the café with Sherlock. They had talked about everything from Sherlock’s interfering brother to John’s overly strict rugby coach, and John had only left when he realized that the sky outside was beginning to darken, and that biology report of his was not going to finish itself.
Sherlock grit his teeth in irritation. “What happened?” he snapped, stepping in a little further. “And where are Anderson and Donovan? This is a crime scene, not a romance novel. I hope to god they didn’t sneak into some broom closet. Lord help us all if—“
mad, and I missed it." the doctor grinned to himself. "What’m trying to say is, I hate that I can’t see you. I never realized how much I relied on your facial expressions to tell what you were thinking. Sometimes it’s like you’re not even there.”
John’s tunnel vision had worsened a bit over the past day or so. It was now incredibly difficult for him to see out of his peripheral, but he learned to adjust, turning his head around at just the right angles so he could take everything in. He began to stare a bit at his friend, who had been eyeing the same magazine page for a good thirty minutes by then.
“He was a Norwich terrier called Norrie,” Sherlock said. “Even if dogs could commit crimes, I doubt he’d be behind any of them.”
“It’s all right, Sherlock. We’ve definitely got some more talking to do, but lucky for you I’m knackered. And I’m not letting you out of this bed, either,” John said matter-of-factly, wrapping a possessive arm around him.
John couldn't help his grin as Sherlock wrapped an arm around him and pulled him in close. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist and nuzzled into his chest, feeling more relaxed than he had in weeks.
“Must I do everything?” Sherlock muttered to himself as he placed the water down on the night table.
John gripped him back, just smiled. They stayed awhile, then Sherlock got up put on the dressing gown, going downstairs to change his clothes.
"Now she's going to compensate, Sherlock," Mycroft frowned, "She will arrive the day after tomorrow, and will take you back to England when your semester ends."
For a moment, Sherlock wanted so much to join John, to lie with him, to act as this was not bullshit, to pretend it was a viable option. But he smiled weakly and looked at John shook, "no."
On the deck, Sherlock leant against the railing, one foot on the iron branch, looking at the distance, just like the day he first met John - but now, behind him would not appear the warm smile and laughing blue eyes, his John.
It turned out that Anderson is attached to you and your great mind just like me. He built a forum called "The Empty Hearse", remembering you with other Sherlock Holmes fans by discussing some fictional details about you.
Sherlock stroked John's hand, they rubbed against each other, "the more the better." He turned and let John kiss his cheek, and then he led John's hand sliding on his body and reached to his half-erected. John's hand rubbed and caressed it above the sheets, and then he left Sherlock's hand to stroke his thighs, to uncover the thin sheets above his skin. Sherlock hugged him and let him kiss his lips and neck. John's hands were not idle, kept touching and playing with Sherlock's legs, separated them and laid between them.
Sherlock came to Baker Street and standing in front of the door with his luggage, frowned when he glimpsed the "for rent" sign still hanging, thinking he should ask Mrs Hudson to remove it immediately. He knocked on the door knocker at 221b impatiently, but no one responded.
Sherlock kissing the sweat on John's skin, thrusting in and out more forcefully, made the sound of flesh collided with flesh getting louder - such sounds and tastes might not be experienced again after backed to London. Sherlock doubted he would ever have sex with anyone other than John, for him a similar experience had once was enough. Moreover, he doubted there would be anyone like John that would make him willing to tolerate, or even be interested in?
The new nurse named Mary looks very cheerful and talkative, quite smart too. Do you like her? When I was playing the crossword puzzle this morning, she commented me with your tone suddenly, which surprised me. I just thought, if I met her before I had known you, maybe I would like her. Maybe because I can capture on her, a little bit of your shadow?
They ripped off each other's clothes with the fastest speed, then the two flesh rubbed against each other with kisses and strokes. John's skilful hands teased over Sherlock's sensitive nipples and then slid down to his thighs and turned to Sherlock's buttocks. Sherlock’s prick crushed against John’s, that rubbing made him groaned and stood unsteadily on his feet. John took the opportunity to put Sherlock down on the ground, pressed against him and reached for the bottle of ointment which was inside his bathrobe’s pocket, then slid his fingers with ointment into Sherlock’s delicate buttocks and massaged into his opening which made him crazy. Sherlock gasping while be twisted around by John’s little finger, John kissed Sherlock’s prick while pounding inside him with excitement, that made Sherlock trembled and whimpered. John watching the flush climbing up Sherlock's cheeks, seeing him struggling to breathe under his sweaty messy curls, he just entangled with Sherlock’s body and did not release him while Sherlock seemed struggling backwards to try to get away from John's trapping.
Mrs Holmes was so happy to see her and hold her hand friendly, "Miss Adler, are you dating Mycroft?"
James laughed happily. "I get it, that you think I'm funnier than them, so to deal with me is a funnier game. Yes, you're right! It's a great game!"
John felt a moist feeling behind his back, right at where Sherlock leaning against him - did Sherlock cry? No, it was impossible. Even when they broke up, he did not cry, but laugh instead...
Sherlock did not fall asleep at all. He got up quickly, put on the dressing gown, walking fast towards the source of the sound.
"Do you know that the war between China and Japan had been broken out for some time ago? The war has been spreading and may come to Hong Kong."
All patriotic, honest, healthy men had been gone to the battlefield. Only left the old and weak remnants, cowards or corrupted elites who could not face the turbulent times, seeking methods to escape. Although Sherlock did not reach the legal age to join the army, nor he was a patriotic fanaticism, he still thought he was useless at that moment, when his brother and John were closely related to the battlefield.
"Oh, it's so late, I'll leave you two here then," Mrs Hudson said hastily. "I still have the stuff to do."
John angrily turned Sherlock over to face him, deadly stared at Sherlock, and Sherlock stared back with a look of disdainful and arrogant.
"Both maybe, and counting my mother," Sherlock kissed her violently, in the middle of the dance floor, kept kissing while dancing with her.
"You..." John froze. "You knew about the letter..." His voice was very bitter and gradually lowered. Then he struggled out of Sherlock's hug, retreated to the bedside and turned his back to Sherlock.
Terrible shouts destroyed the quiet night. Accompanied by screams and struggles from hell, there were some painful moaning and nonsense from dreams.
John hysterically laughed, "really, Sherlock? With only these words, you know what happened?" He nervously grasped his hair, still madly smiling, "Up to this moment, I still don’t understand what is happening!"
Is Mary Watson an enemy or a friend? She shot me at my heart, but end up was shot dead by the bullet which aimed at me...
Sherlock found himself and John both like that feeling - they both addicted to thrilling adventures, that’s why John became a soldier and Sherlock was a bad student who habitually played truant - a taboo relationship got their adrenaline going, to challenge the social norms excited them so much and made them more indulgent to this relationship.
Sherlock’s hand retreated and sat up, looking at the window. Then he saw John, who climbed inside from the window - under the moonlight, John looked terrible, deep dark undereye circles, depressed haggard face, an expression of losing hope.
"Are you taking drugs again?" Lestrade frowned and folded his arms across his chest. "I do not work with a drug addict."
When Lestrade came back from work, Sherlock decided to talk to him. He coughed to draw his attention.
"Oh..." Sherlock made a slight groan, and he let himself be pushed to the edge of the table, and let the man touch and kiss him casually.
"Have you ever been here?" John watched Sherlock absorbing the fresh things around him curiously. "Seems you haven’t."
James was also panting, he angrily staring at Sherlock, as if looking at the world's most difficult mystery. "You refuse me, no one has ever refused me!"
"I only bring a willing person into my bed." John led Sherlock across a road, turned into an alley, left the lively main street. "l took you here, just happened to be my room nearby."
"But an accident happened, my big brother was dead." John swallowed. "I received the telegram last week, be informed that he was drowned, drunk drowned in a puddle on the roadside after heavy rain," he had a mocked and twisted bitter smile.
They just naked laid in the mess, thirsting for the salvation of oxygen, no one could say a word for a long time.
Sherlock stared at the distance, mouth like a machine gun when answered him, “You arrived here about a year ago, stationed in the Victoria barracks, is a military doctor. You just went to the Kowloon Peninsula for the local dignitaries visit. It was not your job, but by political reasons, the task was pressured down by your superior, and the patient was extremely troublesome, that’s why you are now full of grievances." Just glanced at the officer's expression, Sherlock satirically smirked and looked away.
When John and Sherlock left, it was so late that already no transports could get back to Hong Kong Island, so they went to a nearby hotel. John violently grabbed Sherlock’s hand and pulled him into the small room, they had not talked since the dinner finished, John locked the door, and brutally threw Sherlock into the bed. Sherlock just snorted, avoided to look at John.
“Fuck off! You dirty thing son of the bitch, Such a shameless sissy! Don’t even try to sell your service in my restaurant! Get out!”
Sherlock was shocked, he never thought of that his John might be unable to come back from this, and at the same time he could totally felt his parents' pain - if he had received the notice of John's death, he could not imagine how would him become, would he lost his courage to live...
"John~ " Sherlock still touching his thigh, "You can have casual sex while you’re engaged, why can’t you do the same after married?" He touched John's rounded ass and rubbed it. "Before I leave, we can still do it." His hand wrapped around John's cock and kissed his shoulder.
James left Sherlock, let him be flooded by the coming water. Sherlock nearly lost consciousness, only felt be surrounded by the cold water, floating around. The cold water made him suddenly awake, he was so weak that even unable to swim, just tried to keep his body soft so could keep himself floating, and beware to avoid obstacles or sink to the bottom of the water.
"Hello, I'm the flatmate he's going to introduce to you." Sherlock reached out his hand. "Sherlock Holmes."
When the medical team trying to save you, I prayed for God to give me another miracle. I begged you to not die, for me.
Pedestrians became more and much more complex than in daytime while most were going to visit the red light district, visitors included traffickers, pawns, sailors, soldiers, rich guys and dignitaries, mixed with the smells of smokes, sweats and colognes, made Sherlock frowned. John glanced at his expression, smiled and held his hand, pulled him out of this mess by running away with him.
"I'm sorry." Sherlock put down his hands and tried to sit up, but John's hug had not loosened a little, therefore Sherlock stayed in his place. "I heard you having a bad dream."
I can't remember when their images had been changed no matter how hard I tried. Just like being in a dream, although everything seems so real, you can't find the way how you got into the situation - it started from the middle of the scene, you can't find a hint what happened at the beginning.
"I need an assistant." Sherlock rolled his eyes, pouting to Lestrade. "You know I can't get along with Anderson."
John was so excited with his eyes wide opened, could not help but applauded. "It's amazing! Your observation is awesome! Are you going to be a detective after graduated? I need to be your first client!"
James was holding Sherlock's cheek, staring at his Cupid's bow, whispered while he almost touched those lips, "Don't you want to stand on the other side? Obviously, hell is more fun than heaven..." James continued to lean forward, his lips almost rubbed Sherlock's. Sherlock slipped back slightly and crashed into James's arm which waited behind him. "The only rule here is the violation of the rules..." Sherlock looked at James confused, his lips parted slightly, and James was fascinated by it and leant forward again, getting closer to the pair of seductive lips...
Sherlock sneered, turned back, ignored Victor. A thought was rising on his mind - could make the family sad? It would be a lot of fun - could he have a chance to sell his body, to provoke Mycroft? Sherlock was so excited with the idea running through his mind that could make Mycroft furious, he was so eager to try.
His hand stroked his cock tentatively, feeling more pleasure, but at the same time desired more. He stroked himself with those two’s panting rhythm, and closed his eyes to pretend that it was John. He would let John touch him, let him caress his private parts, let him give himself a thrill of excitement, let him release his hidden desires...
"I wouldn't let you down, my love." James smiled and came closer. Sherlock felt only shaky. "Chasing is fun. We have a lifetime to play this game, our love game."
During the London Blitz, many tube stations in the city became air-raid shelters. Among this period, Sherlock was forced to hide in a station in the vicinity of the university, together with a crowd of professors, students and other citizens, waiting for revocation of the air raid siren, but the day seemed never come, did not know when the classes could get back to normal. There were an old professor intended to continue his class in the air-raid shelter, to avoid students abandoned school too long, but while most students were anxious and worried they were hard to concentrate on learning, and finally left only Sherlock still asking questions and demanded to do experiments, made the old professor eventually decided to give up.
"What price did my brother offer you, I'll give you double." Sherlock said to her neck, looked like he was kissing her.
"Kids at your age should be going to school," Lestrade said, "don’t you think you are wasting your gifted brain for dropped out school so early?"
Sherlock had a headache and started a little dizzy - what if that weird smell did not come from the aftershave, but a drug...
Sherlock wanted to help in this situation, he got to the doorway and carried Mary's luggage inside, then he stood aside did not know what to do.
Sherlock was far away from a bad mood, just feeling a little bit floating above the ground, perhaps it was because under his foot was the ocean, perhaps it was because of the seasick he felt...
Through those eyes, Sherlock realized that John had regretted marrying Mary just out of pity and guilt: he thought his parents might not die if Mary and the kid stayed by their side; he thought Mary would be happier if she had not entangled with him; he thought himself was useless, only messed things up...
"Your wife is cheating on you, has been cheating on you a long time ago, and she secretly had sexual relationships with so many people, not just one.”
"As always, your grades are the best of the class." Miss Woodhouse looked at Sherlock with great excitement, returning the last week's test paper to him, still revelling in the fantasy of vanity that the good performance of Sherlock was a result of being her student. It was such a relief for Victor that Sherlock had not been punished anyway.
"You might have thought that you could force him to compensate his fault - replaced you to marry Mary, to take care of his own child - but at this point, you found him dead." Sherlock went on, “In order to conceal the family scandal, you must lie to your parents; in order to save the baby’s life, it’s a Watson after all and your brother's own child; and for Mary's reputation, a poor innocent girl, a woman you should take care of, but suffered a lot because of your playful character. " he paused, "You feel obligated to take all of this. So you will keep your promise of marriage, to marry her before everyone can see Mary’s belly has begun to swell." Sherlock smirked, "You should act fast - according to the voyage from the British to Hong Kong, she is now probably two or three months pregnant."
Sherlock just not used to it. "You... seem to be very happy. Don't you think you're offended? Don’t want to shut me up?"
"It's our name in Chinese," John said, touching his own ring. "I have checked, Holmes and Watson, translated into Chinese is 福爾摩斯 and 華生, inside the rings were engraved separately with 福 and 華.”
John released inside Sherlock's body with a moo, and then fell down on Sherlock’s back, calming his breathing and anger. When John pulled himself out, Sherlock could not help but hiss painfully. John lowered his head to see the swollen wound made by his anger, his stomach twisted of aches, he stroked gently around it with his fingers, and Sherlock trembled with pain.
