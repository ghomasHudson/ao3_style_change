“Three months is a very long time. That doesn’t help at all.” Bruce sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. “We’ll have to research all that we can on this if we are going to get any headway on helping Steve with this.”
mommy and daddy have to. But just because someone's mommy and daddy end up getting separated, it doesn't mean that it happens to everyone. Doesn't mean it would happen to you, baby bear." Steve soothed, petting Peter's hair.
"I've been so bad lately, m'sorry Sir," Tony breathed, grinding down onto Steve's lap, "Been so naughty--"
"He's probably the calmest one right now," Tony muttered, head shooting up at the sound of the curtain opening.
"He was always big on family, believe it or not. But I'm surprised he's thinking about it." Steve answered back, resting his hands on Tony's hips.
Tony buckled Peter in, kissing his forehead before grabbing his milkshake from the front cup holders.
He grinned, pulling up the rounded driveway of his dream house. Steve gawked out the window of the car at the house, absolutely smitten already with just the outside. It was an older house, but it wasn't deteriorated by any means. It looked well taken care of.
"Tatii, you did a lovely job!" Raavi praised, unclipping the bib that caught Steve's hair and removing it from the blond. "Its going to go well with some of the outfits I picked out, too. Its like you read my mind."
"It will cost you your voice and your brawn. But you will get to explore with the human for the 3 months of summer." He stated darkly. "But in this time, if you cannot find a true reason to keep you on land, then I'll get to keep your voice, brawn, ... and
"Yet you still need more convincing?" Steve smiled back gently, moving to kiss at Tony's tattoo. "I'll always be here with you, Tony. For you. Whenever you need me. You're my home, my soulmate, and I sure hope that I'm yours."
Steve nodded happily, leaning with the touches Tony left on his skin. He loved the idea. Absolutely loved it. Sounded perfect. Maybe on their anniversary. It would be summer then and warm. It'd be perfect.
"He might, but not because he's mad. Just because he likes chewing." Steve mumbled, finally opening his eyes. "He'd never be mad at his bubby."
Tony jostled Peter on his hip, smooching his forehead. "We know you're sorry, baby. We forgive you."
"Yeah, but not if it’s by accident. It should be controlled if I'm a little rough." He murmured softly.
"Ah--! Damn it..." He said under his breath with a small wince, waiting to adjust to the feeling. Once he did, Steve rocked his hips down onto Tony's fingers.
." Peter groaned before burying his face in Tony's chest. "It’s only two questions. It’s not dat hard. They won't take long." The boy huffed.
"I guess that's true. Don't need him worrying, too." Steve hummed, pecking Tony's lips lightly. "I hope he’s being okay over at Bucky's. Haven't heard from them yet."
"It’s okay, love. It’s okay. I'm sorry." The blond whispered, rubbing at Tony's back. He moved them down gently so they were laying on the bed, petting at Tony's hair.
"Yeah. Yeah, lemme just-- here--" Steve leaned up with a soft grunt, scooping Tony up as he stood and settling him down carefully on the bed and under the blankets.
"Daddy's too old for kissies," Tony joked, taking his time to lay down on the floor next to them, "And too hurt. I think I pulled my back from sleuthing, Watson."
Steve looked up at Fury, a small huff in acknowledgement. Although the merman had many rough edges, he looked out for Steve like a father. He simply wanted what he thought was best for the youth.
"Of course." The man hummed, toying lightly at the underwear as he leaned up a bit. "Hell, I'll wear the whipped cream myself. Let you satisfy your sweet tooth a little bit."
"Hope I didn't say something stupid," he groused, putting on his glasses to read the drip bag, "Always the heavy stuff to make me loopy."
"Pretty eager, aren't we?" Steve grinned, trailing kisses down Tony's chest and past his navel slowly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"I'll get order in for paint, and I'm also thinking of getting a few things hand-made by a guy out west--"
"You feel so good, Tony." Steve praised. "And you're so good to me. Y'take such good care of me. So sweet."
"Never expected you to be forward like this." He voiced quietly, face growing warmer against his wishes.
"That's the thing, I'm NOT okay, Steve. Talking with my dad brought thoughts up that I didn't want to admit to before, and now I don't know what to do. I mean, I haven't gotten any decent sleep all week, I've got things and feelings I'm trying SO freakin' hard to ignore, and my plan is going to shit. There are so many things I want to tell you about but I'm not even sure of what it all is that I CAN say--".
"Relaxing, taking our time... I haven't mapped your body out in so long, I miss it," Tony murmured, stealing another kiss, "God, I can't wait."
"What's wrong, Tony?" Steve asked softly, an apologetic look to his face. "Can you tell me about last night?"
"JARVIS let me in. He called for me to help, said that your vitals were changing to the way they do when you have an attack.".
"Well that makes sense of why you have a nice, tan body, too." Steve chuckled, wrapping arms around Tony. "I'm Irish. So that explains why I'm so white." He laughed.
what gets lodged up there sometimes? You were a bit like that yourself, before I went off. Your stubbornness buried your real feelings, and it wasn't until James and I found you sobbing--"
"I'm sorry, munchkin. Things were starting to get a little inappropriate for your age." Steve explained softly. "Plus Uncle Clint and Bucky did something that wasn't very nice. They'll be lucky if Santa is nice to them after that so close to Christmas."
Steve nodded, running off to find the hair tie. He looked around in the bathroom, finding a white one. Thankfully it wasn't pink, otherwise Peter might question it later.
"I think he sees us doing it, and Peter, and he wants to do it too," Tony laughed, sitting down with Sammy in his lap, "He'd got about a month before he'll start to crawl, then we'll have to reinforce everything and everything with corners."
"Oh my god, Steve," Tony groaned, picking Steve's hips up to thrust deeper, "Y'feel so good, baby, all loose f'me--"
"I love you. So much." Steve said in reply, giving him a quick kiss back. "Eventually... Maybe we can use the mirror. Just not yet."
"Don't care if I get sick now, you'll be better in a few hours," Tony grumbled, sucking up Steve's warmth.
"Yeah, probably wanted to go sleep with his blankey," Tony murmured back, barely able to return the kiss.
"If you need anything, we're a phonecall away," Tony added, rolling his eyes at Bruce's glance, "Alright, alright. We're going. Jeeze."
, since I wrote the paper," Tony pointed out, tugging Peter's hood off to ruffle his hair, "And you know better, smarty-pants."
"Daddy said y'were gonna teach me how t'draw," He said pointedly, scooting his sketchbook over to Steve.
Tony slid off the stool to crouch down next to Peter, smooching his cheek before taking him into his lap so Steve could finish making dinner.
"Mm. C'mon, we're gonna go now. I'm gonna make a list, drink a cup of coffee, and then we're gonna go. I want--I want to get you something before we--yeah," Tony flushed towards the end of his sentence, stealing a quick kiss before getting off Steve with a grin.
"If you sing that song, you both are getting put in time out with no dessert," Tony interrupted, shooting Steve a glance, "Also, you and I have talked about
"You're so good t'me, Sir," he murmured, pulling his own boxers off before standing up, kissing at Steve's collar, "I'd appreciate a good fucking, Sir. I think it's well needed to counteract my behavior in class."
"Mmm, make up for it at the cabin," Tony chuckled, wrapping his arms around Steve, "C'mon. Sleep before munchkin gets here."
"Horror movie sounds fun. And it’s the perfect excuse for one to hold the other if one of us gets scared." He grinned, kissing the tip of Tony's nose. "And then I know this pizzeria we can have dinner at, if you like pizza?" He asked. "I'll go call in and order tickets for later."
Tony waited for Steve's breath to even out before pulling his hand back, leaning down to kiss Peter's cheek as he laid down himself. He smiled and curled an arm around his boy, easily drifting off.
"Noooo! It’s too much! Imma turn into a monster, toooo!!!" Peter wailed dramatically, falling quiet and pretending to be dead. A moment later, he jolted back 'alive' with a monster roar, smooching the men back on their cheeks.
"I'd like that if it helped with that." Steve whispered, looking up at Tony softly. "I don't want you to hurt any more than you may already, love."
"Dunno how you do that, but y'make me feel like you were just handing me my mail all those years ago," he mumbled.
He brought it over with cream and sugar, setting in on the coffee table. Tony backed up and curled up into his chair, watching Steve and Peggy chatter away.
"It’s alright, Tony. You don't have to apologize for that." Steve soothed, giving Tony a light smile. "It’s a big thing. Emotional. You don't ever have to apologize to me for crying, okay? Everyone does it. Has their moments."
Steve smiled to himself as Tony travelled up the stairs, finishing up his cup and collecting his wallet and keys as he headed towards the car. Tony rifled through his desk, checking for anything he might have missed; some things he needed to replace anyway, but it all looked alright.  He grabbed his wallet and jogged back downstairs, smiling to see Steve waiting for him in the passenger seat.
"I got a few other things to take with us," he drawled, smirking, "I have a small-ish suitcase full of stuff to use. We're gonna have a really good week together."
"Well, I won't leaving you wanting. Not after what you pulled off last night." The blond smiled, moving down to mouth at the tip enthusiastically.
"Whaaat? I thought we were past the bathing-with-him stage," Tony joked, smooching Steve's temple, "I don't mind, bambi. I won't melt."
He gently ran a hand down along Tony's front, stopping around the man's crotch and starting to palm him slowly.
The blond rested his head against Tony's as they sat and waited, ignoring the looks the receptionist was giving them. They had their share of looks from people like that through the years, and he has learned it best to ignore them.
"Only for a second, Tony. I gotta... Y'know." He pointed out, slicking himself up before moving to pick Tony up again. "Keep things running smoothly, baby."
"I went home at twelve and a half. I never got beaten again, on the promise I-- the sex thing. If I kept doing that until I got to MIT. That's when I went off the grid, and moved into the apartment with my three degrees. It's all history from there."
“I know who you’re talking about, and I hate it.” Tony groaned, running his hand over his face in exasperation. “Why is it he’s the only one we can go to when weird shit like this happens? He’s kind of— scratch that, not ‘kind of’— is a dick.”
Tony then caught whiff of something; like the smell of something getting a touch too crispy in the oven. That smell... What was that smell? Oh, it smelled like slightly singed...
"Someone seems to like the idea." He hummed, helping wiggle out of his boxers and holding on to Tony's hips gently.
"Hm." Steve hummed slightly, looking up at Tony. "It sort of tastes like a Tootsie Roll with the form of a Fruit Roll Up." He admitted.
"Mmm, definitely. That'll be a honeymoon night. Slow love-making and I kissing every inch of your body, and mapping every mole, scar, freckle, and love spot on your body." Tony hummed appreciatively, placing small smooches on the top of Steve's head.
Steve listened intently, still a little confused on how a robot could be personified, but he was amused by the thought at least.
He grinned and dashed into the house to do a quick perimeter sweep, waggling his fingers at Bucky as he looked around, sighing in relief.
Tony blinked in surprise, but sat down, picking up the blue marker. He idly sketched out some schematics for a new phone design, occasionally flicking his eyes up to smile at Steve. Steve would smile back as he sketched up Peter's face the best he could with a marker, winking over at Tony a couple of times.
“Babies cry a lot, honey," Tony explained further, "They don't know how to talk yet, so they can only express what they want through cries and other noises, but more commonly cries. It's nothing you did, sweetie. I promise."
"At first, it was all words. Of course, at that age, he might as well have hit me with a baseball bat. When I turned seven-- it got sexual. It was even
Tony groaned loudly before a smirk slowly spread over his face. "Desks don't require sheets," he hummed, nosing at Steve's chest.
Steve clung to Tony protectively, absolutely fuming with wetness prickling at the corners of his eyes. He was silent for the moment, the voice of that...that
, mister." Tony rolled his eyed again and leaned up on his tiptoes to kiss Steve, gently pushing him back toward the bed.
"What if at the classes, they have us practice with those animatronic babies like they give out for a week in high school parenting classes? The ones that cry until you find out what is wrong?"
He was learning every day, the simplest things to a few more complicated subjects being covered (although the latter was far and few between). When Tony would explain something in question to him, Steve in turn would tell him about his life under the waves. It was a constant exchange of curiosity and intrigue, and Tony-- Oh man, Tony; That man had the patience of a saint when it came to Steve's questions. The blond knew the most he would ask about had to be things so simple and mundane to the other, but Tony explained it so calmly and thoroughly without batting an eye.
"God, you're amazing," Tony groaned, kissing him back, "I'm gonna hop in the shower and I'll meet you downstairs, 'kay?" He grinned, grabbing a change of clothes before heading to the bathroom.
"There's only slightly six. I'm built more up top. Plus I think eighteen is impossible naturally. But thank you for the compliment." He grinned.
pressured. Hell, you're gorgeous babe, I wish we could have sex every single hour of every single day. It's more of.... I dunno. It's kinda like when you get used to having this great thing all the time, and then when it gets rationed, it doesn't seem as great as it used to be? No, that's not right-- ah, more like-- it feels like sex, and not like making love. That make sense?"
"Everyone has them. Nothing wrong with it. Hell, I have a reoccurring one. It really hits me hard in winter." He explained softly.
"Yeah, okay. It's a real tail. And you're a real merman." Tony laughed, stopping as he felt where the crease would be. Would be, being the key word. It was one solid connection; skin to scale with no stop in between.
"I can clear myself. I'm Tony Stark," he teased, flitting back over to Steve and smooching his cheek, "Not drowsy. Pretty good. Hopefully my passed out self wasn't too much of a burden."
"Okay. I'll be back." Steve assured, kissing Tony back gently before heading to the kitchen. He made up the coffee and some oatmeal for them to eat real quick before coming back into the living room.
Steve shrugged softly. "I don't think I'd mind it too bad, honestly. At least if I was exposed to it enough." He hummed in thought. "As long as people don't invade our complete and utter privacy." He said, giving Tony's hand a squeeze.
“Ooh, you turn me on, Stevie," Tony growled, nibbling on the blond's neck, "Let's go see this movie before I jump you in the parking lot."
Tony turned around, body rigid and a none too amused expression on his face as he looked back from Steve, to Dodger, then back to Steve.
"I know, but--it's worth a shot, right?" Tony hummed in content at the attention, happily breathing in Steve.
"...And this guy had to of saw Steve. He was looking for him." The purple shirted guy was saying to another with...Was that a metal arm???
"Getting all ready to eat, I see?" Steve grinned as he looked over, oven mitts on his hands. "It'll just be a couple more minutes, then we'll let it cool off a bit."
"Not a chance. I'd prefer you stayed." Steve grinned back, glancing up towards their headboard. "Besides, we haven't gotten to make use of our mistletoe, darlin'-- only have a few hours left before it doesn't count." He chuckled, kissing at Tony's face softly.
"He was joking," Nat rolled her eyes, "No strippers, nothing. It'll be the ladies and you, the lads and Tony. That is, unless he's wearing the white tux."
, among other things. My homework is to make two lists: one of how I perceive myself, and the other of how others see me. So I wanted to knock that second one out of the park, since you guys are all here."
Tony smirked, still petting Steve's hair. Steve hummed in amusement at the sound of it, rolling back over to look up at Tony.
mmh hm." Steve hummed in understanding, holding in a groan and trying to keep from moving back on whatever Tony was using. He hadn't looked back to see this whole time, and now he definitely wouldn't know if he wasn't supposed to move.
"That's my responsible boy," Tony praised, smooching Peter's head, "Why don't you go pick out some stuff to do with your baby brother while your Papa and I get stuff arranged?"
"Hmm, I'll have to make sure you get more used to compliments, then." Steve responded with a smile, grip careful around Tony's cock as he began to slowly pump the other in his hand. "Because you treat me so well that compliments just want to leave my mouth all the time."
He waited for Steve to get out of the car before locking it, taking his hand to lead him inside. As they headed through the door, Steve couldn't help but gap at everything as they walked in. It really
"You wrote 'TonyStark' in for that love and affection question," he said aloud, turning in time to see the blush creep down his partner's neck, "Subtlety was never your expertise, Rogers."
"I'm glad y'here," he whispered weakly, closing his eyes and curling into Steve's warmth. Tony sniffled again, trying to stop himself from crying too hard; Steve's shirt was wet enough, as it was.
"Hold on, squirt, lemme get you a napkin," Tony rolled his eyes and handed Peter his plate of sandwich squares, stuffing a napkin into his hand, "Don't make a mess."
"Don't gotta beg, baby." Steve smirked, kissing at Tony's spine as he pulled out his fingers and worked to slick himself up.
Peter sighed at the medical talk, impatiently tapping his foot. Tony looked down at the boy and squeezed the boy's hand comfortingly, turning his attention back to the nurse.
"Peter," Steve coaxed gently. "Your father apologized. Don't you think you have something you need to say to him?".
"You gonna stay, dough?" Peter asked sleepily, snuggling deeper into Tony and shutting his eyes. "You make it easy to sweep..."
The blond bit his bottom lip for a moment in thought, bracing himself for what was sure to be a scolding.
"Mhm. I'm immune to pouting, Steven," Tony grinned, ruffling his hair, "You get ten more minutes, then I'm dragging you out if I have to."
The semester was about 2 days away from its end. Tony hadn't spoken with Steve since the ordeal with his father. Hell, he barely even spoke with Bruce if it didn't have to do with help on some work. Being basically banished from school by your father because of rumors that you were in love with a guy doesn't really put a person in a great mood. Then he basically blew up at Steve about it, trying to break it off knowing he wouldn't get to see him again after the semester. That doesn't make it any better.
"I just-- I wanna make a good impression, y'know?" Steve said with a deep breath. "I don't... I don't want her to change her mind because she thinks something bad of us."
"You turned me into a sap, cheeseball. I was happily unemotional before I met you," Tony laughed, rubbing at his eyes, "Oh my god, mixing post-orgasm raw emotions with this was not a good idea, oh god--"
Shutting off the water, Tony quickly applied salve to his hand and bandaged it up before attempting to work again. His movements were clumsy and his work did more harm than good, at which point he stood from his worktable and padded over to the futon to lay down. Tony tugged a blanket over himself and cradled his hand, allowing himself to dip into that little pit for only just a moment: not enough to burst into tears, but enough to feel sick.
about that phase. Lord knows it's gonna be me giving him the talk, and I'd rather not think about it," Tony snorted, "Focus on how little and innocent he is now. Okay? Okay."
"So what if I happen to like the guy? You wouldn't have bothered or cared either way if it didn't have something to do with your image as Dean. That's the only reason you ever pay attention to me when you do, is when it has something to do with how YOU are seen. Hell, people had to come and TELL you about a situation like this because you sure don't ever bother talking to me, let alone attempt being involved in what's going on in my life!".
"Silence means happy tummies. Usually." Steve hummed, handing a napkin to Peter to wipe his face when he would finish.
"You did so well with the comic, it's--I love it, Steve, and I know Pete does too," he murmured, lacing their fingers together, "You know, I bet--"
While Tony worked in his workshop, Steve and the boys started to play in the living room on the floor. Sammy was crawling around like crazy, using Steve as an obstacle from time to time as the man laid on his back.
"I think I wanna hear yours outside of the bedroom." He smirked back. "You have such a lovely voice when you do.”
Steve thrust a few more times, feeling Tony clench around him. It didn't take much more before he came with a gasping moan, head resting on Tony's chest as his hips stuttered to ride out the pleasure. Tony clung onto Steve, eyes rolling back in euphoria; he groaned as he felt Steve fill him, breathing his name into his neck.
Tony really had to think of a way to show the senior how thankful he was..oh yeah! He almost forgot about that.
Tony jolted from behind the door as he heard the knocking continue, The brunette frowned in confusion as no one ever came knocking on their door. Tony and his parents were still new to town so they didn’t really know anybody yet. And most of the neighbors were never home during this time. With a confused look Tony cautiously opened the door to take a peek, hazel brown eyes going wide as he watched in horror at the teen standing in front of the door looking absolutely pissed.
Steve grinned at that, tightening his grip on the trembling dick. "Do you love me enough to bend down for me in front of the whole kingdom?"a small choke escaped the Prince as he sobbed knowing very well Steve already knew the answer to that was still a no.
“Where’s Peter? I haven’t seen him all day?” Steve asked when he finally realized that one of his children was missing. “He’s with Wades again...you know those two can’t be separated..” Tony answered as he placed some mashed potatoes on the middle of the table. Steve gave a small frown at that which made the tiny omega chuckle. “Oh Steve...they’ll be fine...Wades a good boy...” Tony said as he gestured for his husband to sit. Steve obeyed but still had the frown on. “And a teenage Alpha..” he added. Tony gave him a look at that “ all the more reason why i feel Peter would be safe with him...” Tony defended. With a huff Steve shrugged in defeat, Tony was right..and he couldn’t control who his omega son hang out with. He just felt that he’d much preferred if Peter hang out with his siblings instead.
Moments like these were always Steve’s favorite, as he got to be much closer to the billioner genius.
Steve couldn’t help but feel himself get hard at that. 19 years of being bonded together and having kids and Tony still knew how to make Steve hard as a rock. Or and most especially made his heart flutter. 19 years...and forever was never going to be enough as he captured Tony’s soft lips again.
He inhaled as he glanced down at the sleeping blond who for once since he’d found him last night, looked absolutely peaceful. He looked younger and more cuter now that his face wasn’t covered in a scowl. Unconsciously he traced a finger on the tiny blonds hair, twirling a strand as he took in the adorable sight in front of him.
Wade didn’t miss the way the older man’s grip had tighten on Tony’s waist for a few seconds. “You can thank me later…”Steve grinned as he tried to sound casual infront of the two teens.
When it was all over, Tony couldn’t help but smile at his alpha as he panted heavily. feeling absolutely Sticky and wet while Steve’s tentacles continued to wrap around him. The blond also smiling widely when Tony had nuzzled his head tiredly against Steve’s chest.
steve went completely still at the shorter teen’s words. Tony could tell he had successfully struck a nerve at the way his brother’s face morphed into that of hurt before going completely unreadable. Tony was about to say more when Steve had suddenly pulled him out the door more harshly, making the shorter teen yelp as Steve dragged him across the street where a car was parked. Steve quickly opened the unlock door of the car as Tony tried desperately to get away, until his eyes widen in shock once he saw who was inside the car.
“Alright, break it up! Break it up you two!” Clint frowned as he carefully pulled Natasha away from the two male hybrids that had seemed to loose interest in the cake. And had started growling at each other, trying to impress and woo the read head. Steve sat perfectly still at the center not really minding what the other’s were doing. “Come on you two...no fighting...gosh, sorry..you know how male hybrids are around females” Sharon sigh as she patted Bucky’s shoulders. “Yeah..it’s Understandable..three males and one female together in one room..it’s just instincts really” Bruce assured. “Steve doesn’t seem to mind though..” pepper said as she glanced at the unfazed blond. “Well..his never experienced getting aroused near a female before.. not even when Nat’s in heat..never once bothered him that made him wanna jump at her” Tony shrugged as he took a bite of his cake.
On the middle of the highway Steve drove fast as he felt his heart bounce frantically inside his chest. He felt himself sweat as he glanced back every so often to look at the unconscious omega laying on the back seat. Hands and feet tied together as a small piece of clothe was wrapped around his mouth. He just couldn’t do it. He couldn’t leave Tony to marry with an alpha who he knew Tony didn’t love and didn’t love Tony in return as much as he did. Because damn it No one loved Tony more than Steve did.. he had always loved him, since the day they Were introduced to each other as brothers..he hated it that he couldn’t tell Tony how much he wanted to be the omega’s alpha. How much he wanted their pretend weddings to be a real one day. He had even started going out with other omega’s just to get his mind off of Tony but it was no use. Tony was the one for him. But Tony had made it clear that they would just be brothers, that he only thought of Steve as his brother. It had hurt the alpha so bad that he ended up taking a job offer at another state just so he could be away from the omega. And when he had finally thought he was over Tony, when he had finally started going out with someone..Tony had called him and told him that an alpha had asked for his hand in marriage. The whole thing literally messed him up as he tried desperately not to think about it. But he couldn’t take it.. he never could when it came to Tony.. before he knew it he was on a plane and headed back to their home where he saw the beautiful omega smiling warmly at him. That night when he had laid in bed with Tony again, all the feelings just came crashing down on him as he finally felt brave enough to show Tony how he really felt for him. The omega once more had made it clear that they couldn’t be together. Shattering Steve’s already broken heart again, making him think that he should really let go of Tony once and for all.
He slowly let go of Sammy's hands and backed away to the other side, holding his hands by his waist. Slowly, Sammy took a tentative step toward Peter, then slowly shuffled over to him, tiredly collapsing in Peter's arms with a sad whine.
"I'm not used to talking about this stuff," Tony complained, trying to get the embarrassing blush off his face, "Excuse me for being shy over this."
The other man just shrugged, a smirk on his face as he walked up to the doorway to retrieve his arrow.
"He's six, and I'm the more lenient parent," Tony laughed, stretching his back, "If I was the strict one, he'd be trotting at your heels."
"We should take a vacation. Just the two of us. Take a couple days off to go to a cabin somewhere, and do nothing but go at it like bunnies." He grinned, trying not to laugh.
It’s been a week together, and a week since the nightmares started to subside. No longer did the broken radiator in his apartment make him more susceptible to the reoccurring flashbacks of his time overseas. Rather, he had his own personal heater now.
Steve suppressed a groan at the motion, waiting to hear little feet patter away before speaking at a whisper.
The next couple days, Steve and Tony hadn't really saw each other. Contrary to popular belief, college isn't all parties and frat houses. It actually involves work and that can keep anyone busy. It was now the weekend though, and they had planned for their first drawing session today.
Tony huffed a sigh and forced himself to relax, melting into Steve's arms. "Okay," he mumbled, taking steady breaths, "If I can handle Clint, I think I can handle being romantic with my husband. Right?"
"Of course, love," Tony mumbled, picking up the washcloth. He gently scrubbed Steve down, kissing his forehead before letting the water drain. "Let's get you into some PJ's and we'll take a nap, okay baby?"
"YAY!" Peter cheered as he stood to get out of the tub. "Pizza! Pizza! Pizza!" He chanted, nearly running off with nothing but his towel.
Peter. And he adores you." Steve said soft and sweet. "You've been doing so good, babe. Don't you ever doubt that because I will let you know it’s not true."
"I'm not a ding dong," Tony complained, "That was mean. Real mean. Maybe we'll just go to a motel in downtown Jersey for that comment." He grinned, ruffling Steve's hair.
Steve jumped a bit at hearing the younger man speak again. He straightened his posture and stated his name.
"That's what's wrong, I don't want Peter to see that, Tony." He said quietly, seeing the sheets. "I'm gonna fix you up then we are changing the sheets before Peter is in here. We will talk about this tomorrow, okay?" Steve hummed, brushing back Tony's hair lovingly.
Tony could only nod, voice lost in shuddery breaths and hiccups. He sniffled, trembling slightly against Steve's chest. "I love you," he croaked, pressing his nose into the dip between Steve's collarbones, "I love you so much."
of self control with you, if I am being completely honest." Tony admitted with a soft look, running comforting hands up along Steve's slender legs. "We'll get further if you end up wanting to, but for now we're just gonna help with your friend there."
"There he is. There's our sweet boy we missed." Steve smiled softly, smooching the boy's cheeks, "We are still going to talk though. Right after dinner, all right? It's important."
He took Steve's hand and led him upstairs to their bathroom, taking a quick breath before grabbing his razor from its spot, giving it to Steve.
"I know," Tony licked his lips, "But I can't apologize. At the time-- it was all I took to hold onto Steve, let alone call you guys. That, and I don't ever want him to feel inferior, or like I'd pick you guys over him. He knows what I need, not saying that you guys don't, but Steve's my
Tony woke up to a small warm body pressed up against him, rubbing his face with his hand a bit, he yawned as he felt the other nuzzle even closer. A wide grin spread on his face as he rumpled the small blonds hair near his chest. The tiny blond had put up quite a fight last night when he had told him to take a bath, claws marking his bathroom door and shampoo bottles scattered all over the tiled floor.  He’d have to clean that up later when they’d done away with visiting the vet.
Both staring at each other’s lips before carefully pressing them together, Steve’s entire mind and body shivered with delight at how soft Tony’s lips were. unable to hold himself, he began to glide his tongue out, licking lushes pink lips as he closed his eyes, feeling the sensation melt him inside out as he begged and demanded for entrance, which thankfully Tony obliged. For a few short moments their tongues twirled around each other, playfully meeting and sliding against each other till Steve felt himself get stiff down his pants. Regretfully he pulled away from the panting brunette, A strand of saliva connecting both their mouths together as he did. “Wow..” Tony breathed as he tried to regain his breathing, panting as he stared with soft eyes at Steve. The blond couldn’t help but smirk at that as he too couldn’t breath properly.
Tony sigh as he watched his blond hybrid stare daggers at the other hybrid that had settled comfortably on his lap. Which by the was usually reserved for Steve when they were watching their afternoon shows.  But since Thor was their guess and was probably feeling homesick Tony had smiled and patted him gently when the big blond had sneakily crawled over to where he was sitting and settled his head over his lap. Steve had just entered the living room at that moment with a hot cup of afternoon coffee in his hands for Tony. The hybrid knew the brunette always liked to have a cup of black coffee during this time. Wide brown eyes stared in horror as a crack appeared on the side of the cup. (His favorite cup by the way) Steve was shaking a bit as he glared at the hybrid on Tony’s lap. As he tried and failed to get Thor off him all the brunette could do was sigh as he whistled to get Steve’s attention, Which was unbelievable hard since it seemed as though all Steve could see and hear was Thor right now. He didn’t even realize the coffee leaking from the cup he was holding as it was starting to break. “OH MY GOD STEVE! YOUR HAND!” Tony yelled as he carefully maneuvered Thor away from him. Immediately jumping to get the broken cup from Steve’s hands. When he had taken it he cursed as the liquid dripped, burning his skin. That seemed to get the hybrids attention as Steve quickly  jolted from his spot and ran to the brunette’s side who was currently running through the kitchen.
The blond was eagerly excited to buy his little demon a few things before they went home. Thankful that Natasha had thought of giving Tony to him before considering anyone else. He didn’t know if he could take it if he saw Tony being owned by his other friends. The incubus was just too cute to pass up and god damn he had to give Nat something really nice now as a thank you.
Clint laughed as Tony stuck out his hand to give him the middle finger before waving off to Steve who ran up a bit to wave back. Two whole days without Tony Steve sigh as it began to sink in on him. Nat unexpectedly jumped at him from behind and had wrapped her arms and legs over Steves body.
Tears pouring down his cheeks as he tried to steady his breathing. Steve was kissing her, kissing Peggy..it shouldn’t hurt like this but it did. Steve was out all night with her and had kissed her. It hurt so much that Tony had to curl in on himself to stop himself from shaking. A few seconds later he hears the door downstairs close, a minute later the engine of Bucky’s parked car outside started running and he could hear them drove off. Leaving the house finally silent and empty for some reason. In all his years after his parents had died Tony had never felt this hurt and lonely before. When his mom and dad had died Steve was there for him. Now that Steve was going to be with someone else no one was left to be there for Tony anymore. With tears still trailing down his face he curled onto a little ball as he tried to disappear.
Tony frowned as he glanced at the clock on the wall. It was already ten at night, a school night in fact. Steve still hadn’t come home yet or even given him a call. He hated this feeling he had right now. his insecurities rising up at the thought that Steve could actually live with out him. The blond had said when they were younger that he had wanted Tony to be with him forever, but his actions recently were telling Tony he was probably having second thoughts on that. Ever since Steve had started his senior year he had acted more distance towards Tony. A year ago they didn’t really kiss or even hold hands anymore in public, yet the blond had still made sure to go over the brunette’s locker. He had always made time to walk pass his class and wave at him, even eat lunch with him from time to time. But now Steve was all of a sudden too busy to notice him walking in the hallway, in too much of a hurry to wave at him whenever he pass by Tony’s class. even at lunch Tony would find Steve sitting in a full table with his friends not batting an eye at him. It was okay really, Tony didn’t mind. Steve after all had a life of his own. He didn’t need to always hover over Tony like Tony was some little kid that needed to always be taken care of. But it still hurt when Tony thought about it. When he was finally alone and had no one to occupy his mind from the blond’s recent actions. And now Steve had been coming home later on most nights which was really starting to nag at the brunette. What Tony hated most though was the fact that whenever Steve would come home he would act like nothing was wrong, like he hadn’t been distant at all. He would place soft kisses and pamper Tony, making the younger teen feel better and forget all the bad thoughts right away.
Stupid Alpha’s...they really needed their brains check if they thought that Steve would ever chose them and their stuck up self centered egos over his sweet and gentle Tony. Speaking of Tony...Steve‘s face drew tighter when he realized that the stupid alpha’s interference had given another omega a chance to go and flirt with his innocent alpha, who as always was oblivious to the omega’s advances. God he hated how everything had been going with him and Tony since he got back. Thanks to his new new physical appearance all types of alpha’s were trying to get it on with him leaving him a bit occupied to chase them away. In those tiny moments Steve noticed the omega’s that had been waiting for their chance to be with Tony had grabbed those moments as their opportunity to get his alpha’s attention for a little bit. It was frustrating to say the least. Steve had to guard his precious alpha even more now. With an irritated look Steve marched right on up behind Tony who was facing the annoying omega. the omega’s face instantly fell the moment she saw Steve glaring death daggers at her. His muscles flexing as he stood on his full height, looking absolutely intimidating.
Said hybrid quickly swallowed and looked absolutely defeated when Tony took out the giant muffin from inside his coat’s pocket. He quickly tore it off the brown paper bag it was in and lifted it up in the air for the blond to see.
Back to the present Tony was chuckling as Bucky sent him another GIF of a dog running around covered in marshmallows. For a week now he had been steering towards the other teen as he didn’t really want to keep thinking about Steve which was absolutely hard since they lived together. He really hated how he still craved the blond’s attention and wanted Steve all to himself. He decided it really wasn’t really healthy what he was feeling towards Steve ever since he had realized how he really felt for his brother when he had seen him kissing someone else.
"Steve please..." he whispered through thick fingers that traced his face. "Husshhh...my Love" Steve whispered as he carefully placed Tony on his lap. "But Steve...there are innocent people there...children..." Tony begun as he clutched at the muscular shoulder. "They did not seem all that innocent when they all spat at you." A growl rumbled from the Hydra King's chest. "Th-they didn't know any better...Steve.." the prince pleaded as he wrapped his slender arms around the hydra kings neck. Showing as much submission as he could, The larger man only smiled and shook his head at the beautiful prince. "They don't deserve your mercy Tony.. they never did!" He growled angrily before he kissed the other's nose and leaned on his head. screams could be heard as the city Tony once knew burned to ashes. Weil's and screams from men, women and even children echoed out to where Steve and Tony were settled
With a sheepish grin Tony leaned up to give his big adorable hybrid a small kiss on the cheek. Startling the blond, giving him a quick escape as Steve’s arm’s had gotten lose. By the time Steve had snapped out of his haze Tony had already started walking a meter away. Winking at the blushing blond as he told him to be good and play nicely with Thor. Steve frowned at that but waved goodbye to the other as Tony waved back at him before closing the door. With a sight Steve turned to go inside the living room where the rest of the hybrids were settled.
Steve sigh as he waited for the brunette to arrive. Yesterday he had seen Tony without his glasses again for the second time after the football incident. Tony was so beautiful in front of him..with his big beautiful brown eyes underneath thick long eyelashes. The blond couldn’t even breath as he tried not to lean on down and give the other a kiss. He’d swear never to let anyone else see those beautiful eyes..they were only meant for him from now on. A creak from the classroom door had jolted him out of his thoughts as he saw Tony coming in with his textbooks wearing an adorable baggy turtleneck. “I’m sorry..did you wait long?..i had to go over mr. Fury’s office to get something and then-“ Gosh was Tony cute when he rambled. With a cough Steve stood up as he reassured the other that he didn’t really wait long, even though he waited for 30 minutes inside the empty room. The brunette smiled at that which gave Steve butterflies inside his stomach as he tried to act normal.
Loud slapping noises echoed out into the hallway as small sobs grew into wanton groans and moans. It was hard not to get a hard on when the Prince's seductive voice filled the hall, and the smell of hot messy sex drifting off into the air that they breathed. The two Guards simply stood in silence as they cursed the king for giving them unwanted hard-ons.
Before he entered the dark forest, he stopped to give his new mate a chance to say goodbye to his old life as they would now begin their new one together in his lands. Tony merely glanced at the now distant village before glancing up at the larger creature carrying him. Smiling and nodding that he was ready to leave his old home behind. Steve smiled at that, bending his neck a bit to lean down and give his new mate a kiss, loving how his tiny mate leaned in to it. It was just a quick kiss. But enough to reassure him that Tony  was taking all this well. And a wide grin on his blushing face. Steve finally sprinted into the forest, ready to start his and Tony’s new life together as human and beast.
Steve stirred from the pokes, grumbling softly. Without yet opening his eyes, he flopped down onto Tony's chest, snuggling at it.
"Tell me what doesn't feel good, bubba. Papa'll try and fix it, okay?" Steve whispered gently, continuing to rub the boy's back.
"Shhshh, no sweetie. You don't have to feel that way. I'm sorry." Steve whispered, peppering Tony's face gently with kisses. "It’s okay, love. It’s okay."
"Seven letter word for severe mental or physical pain. Wow, today's puzzle is depressing." He murmured.
"Well, if you tell me what you have in mind, I can help you find the store we can find it, Peter." Steve offered warmly. "I think it’s nice you want to get Daddy a present."
"Jaws? Really? Now our son is a shark?" He chuckled, smooching Peter's nose once he got close enough.
"So, what did you think?" Tony asked as they walked to put the bags into the car before they would continue back out for their day on the boardwalk.
"Take care, yourself. It was very nice to meet you." Steve said with a smile and a wave, squeezing Tony's hand back as they headed out to the car.
"Get cleaned up, I want you to be able to detox from the heat so I can take your temperature," Tony grumbled, already in the process of cleaning himself up.
Steve looked to him softly, giving a small sigh. "Tony, I didn't mean that." He said softly. "Honestly, there isn't anything that I hate about you. At all. I don't like that you aren't able to see your good qualities, but I know that isn't really your fault."
"You may have doctorates, but you aren't a medical doctor." Steve said softly before catching on. "Wait, do you not remember what we talked about?"
“Yes. I’ve checked our entire floor, even the kitchen in case she might have been hungry and went there for a snack,” Tony explained, “You know she’s been known to try and sneak into the berries and Poffins.”
Only a few chapters left! p.s: i really don't know how fertilization works with a donor, so please have a state of suspended belief for this chapter.
"Don't let that happen. You and I both need your heart." The blond chuckled quietly. "Plus Peter might think you mean it. But he is adorable. He knows it too. Like someone else I know."
"He called you sex on legs, and Clint and Nat are a package deal," Tony laughed, moving to clean up the shot glasses and cake pan, "They'll be great together. I think Bucky will be able to keep Clint in line, and gives Nat someone to speak to." He paused. "He
Steve whined softly from the hit, but mewled as Tony kissed and soothed the mark. He felt another smack, a small moan escaping his lips then.
"Yeah. Scientists know to treasure their specimens," Tony teased, grabbing the other half of the bassinet, "And it'll take us two seconds, love."
"He loves you so much, Peter." Steve smiled, reaching up to card fingers through Peter's hair. "Sammy loves his big brother very much."
'Did you wanna watch a movie before bed tonight?' Steve asked softly, looking up at the other with those blue, puppy-dog eyes that Tony wasn't sure Steve knew he did. A lot. 'I know you had a long day, but maybe it'll help you relax? I tried to watch one earlier, but it just... didn't feel the same without you watching it with me.'
"Water it is." Steve said in amusement, setting one of his hands further up the table and hoping Tony'd play along. "And we should get some of their breadsticks too. They're
He grabbed Tony's hand as they settled into the car, taking a deep breath before they started to leave. Tony gave Steve another reassuring squeeze, turning his head to back out of the driveway and head off to the highway.
"Oh. Right.Uh--" Tony said flustered, glancing at the bot and its circuits. "Well, there isn't a name yet, actually. I usually save the naming until I see how it--"
"Good thing I'm not walkin' much tomorrow," Tony murmured, gently kissing at the bite mark on Steve's neck, "Sorry about that, I really didn't know how else to silence myself."
, and I don't wanna hear you two banging all night," Clint drawled, flicking his eyes over to Steve, "
"Minutes? You expect to get me off that fast? I'm impressed by your brevity, Stark-Rogers," Tony purred, tilting his neck to give Steve more room, "Take all the time you need, baby. You know I like it rough."
"Howard found out about our plans. On my twelfth birthday, he beat me with a whiskey bottle, and when that broke, resorted to his own fisticuffs. He kneed my sternum, snapped it in half, and sent bone shards into my heart. Clint found me almost bleeding out, and got me to the hospital for emergency surgery. I was submitted under an alias, and healed for the next three weeks. Mama never knew."
"I honestly don't know what'll happen," Tony mumbled, standing to grab the remote. He clicked on the television and turned to CNN, watching the DOW run across the bottom.
"We can do that real quick before we get you settled into bed, okay? We'll take his bandaids with us."
"Yep. Definitely still a little tired." Steve chuckled softly, coming over to sit with them. "And you are definitely at least part sap now." He chuckled.
"Not telling. Not until the day we leave," Tony hummed, "And don't try to weasel it out of me, otherwise I'll change it to a different place. And I know you'd like to go to this place." He sifted a hand through Steve's hair, shifting slightly under him.
"I dunno if I should, you being bad but you enjoying this." He purred, going to slick up his fingers and warm the lube up before tracing it lightly against Tony's entrance. "I think I should tease you a little--".
"Did you seriously quote The Losers?" Steve whispered as they headed downstairs. "We can worry about all that after Christmas. But I can't wait for the alone time." He hummed wistfully.
"All right. And I'll make sure you see the pictures, okay?" Steve said fondly, walking over to grab the book.
"Nonsense, you have no idea how I organize," Tony grumbled, grinning triumphantly when he pulled out the book he was looking for.
Steve rode him out as Tony fell from his high, taking him a bit longer before he came as well. He left open kisses along Tony's spine as he fell himself, running gentle hands along Tony's skin soothingly.
Steve packed up into its case the shield that had protected him through so much; that had held his legacy as Captain America for all these years. Once he knew it was settled and knew exactly what it was he wanted to do, he made a call. He called Sam and Bucky, telling them to meet him at the park. Just saying that, they would know where he meant; What he meant. They would know it was important.
Steve took in Tony's presence happily, touching at skin lovingly. "Hopefully that way with odds will be true for the Stark-Rogers’, as well." He smiled softly. "Let’s get back to bed, hm? Your leg will probably get sore soon."
"See what Daddy thinks about what?" Tony poked his head into the living room, drying a plate with a towel.
"Good to hear." Steve nodded amusedly, glancing inside. "Well, I'm making breakfast, so if you could round up everyone for me, that'd be good."
"Well," he drawled, more in a whine than anything else, "Yeah. You're right. But it's stuff that could be set off by
Steve grinned so big, he was practically beaming. He nearly let out an excited squeal before bringing Tony into a deep and excited kiss.
"Shhh, we don't want to--ah--wake 'im up." Steve gasped quietly, grabbing onto Tony's hips and pounding into Tony. He wouldn't last much longer at this rate.
"In here, peep," Tony called from his bathroom, adjusting the water temperature, "I got your clothes all ready for you."
"Peter, don't be so hard on Daddy. He was just playing." Steve assured, rubbing the boy's back. "He might have took it a little far, but he wasn't trying to be mean, munchkin."
"He's a kid, he's always tired," Tony laughed, pulling his boxers on, "I'm gonna go cover the shrimp, then shower."
After just a few seconds however the door clicked and Steve’s ears perked up instantly. jumping to his feet Steve ran and greeted the brunette who smiled tiredly at him. “Hey Steve..sorry I’m late..had to go over at Clint’s for a bit..” Tony said as he tiptoed to pet Steve’s head. The blond leaned down for him to make it easier, ears and tail up in a straight line. Happy to finally have his owner home safe. “It’s okay..i made lasagna..I’ll heat it up!” Steve offered as he tilted his head to Tony’s touch. “No don’t bother! I like it cold either way...too hungry to wait..” Steve nodded at that with a smile.
“WAIT!” Steve screamed as he tried to pry the door open, immediately sliding his left leg on the doors open space. Tony was shaking a bit as he let the blond open the door. Not use to how rough the other’s voice was at the moment. The blond was still staring at him when he had successfully pried the door wide open. “ why didn’t you go to the science lab like i asked?” the shorter teen had immediately frozen at hearing those words. “I...i-you..you wrote that?” Brown eyes wide with shock. Without an answer Steve had let himself in, closing the door behind him as he lifted the small notepad out of his pocket. Making the brunette swallow hard as he slowly backed away from the intruding blond. “Yeah...and i was so upset when i saw you running away from school when you passed me by the hallway..thought you were braver than that..” steve huffed as he cornered the shorter teen against a wall.
Steve winked as he smiled warmly at his brother. Tony could only gape at him in shock. Pressing his hand at the metal tag hanging around his neck. Before he could manage to say anything Steve had leaned down to press a kiss on his lips. Hazel brown eyes going wide as he felt the alpha slide his tongue inside his mouth. Taking advantage of the brunette’s surprised  as he Dove his tongue in and started exploring once more. “Mmm...Ste-steve...we can’t were brothers...remember?” Tony gasped as he tried to free himself from Steves delicious tongue. “Step-brothers Tony...please don’t forget that...” Steve breathed as he palmed the omega’s blushing face and pressed it closer to him. “Shit Tony...you know i only want you to be happy...” Steve whispered as he bit the omega’s bottom lip, making Tony whimper. “...but are you happy with him?” He finished when he let go of the now swollen lip. Leaving Tony panting a bit as he stared at him. Tony wanted this, wanted Steve so bad..he had always wanted Steve but it just couldn’t be..they were brothers..and he had told himself that time and time again. He wasn’t going to ruin everything between them. Steve would find himself another omega and He would marry Killian...that was it that’s what he had told himself these past few weeks..he wasn’t going to destroy what him and Steve had. And so with a heavy sigh he answered a yes. “Yes Steve i am happy with him...and you’d be happy with someone else too..”
Once he had drank all his coffee and eaten half of the donuts. Tony’s eyes widen as he’d realize that his shirt had been unbottoned halfway down. When did that happen? Steve wasn’t kidding..he could get preoccupied. Before he could even ask. The blond had whispered that Tony had felt so tensed..that maybe opening his shirt would help him more relax. Tony couldn’t really argue on that as he felt 10 times better. On that note, he decided to closed his eyes shut for a bit. Head falling agaisnt his chair as he melted away to those expert hands.
He had always hated the bitch. Always hated how close she would lean and whisper words in Tony’s ears while he was still at Stark kingdom. He wanted to crush her skull with his own bare hands every time Tony and her seemed too familiar with each other.
There was a few seconds of silence as Tony stared at each avenger in the room with him. Heart thumping loudly in his chest as he tried to think clearly at those words.
“Why don’t you join us in the small living room, as we tell each other stories of ourselves my friend!”
Steve wasn’t like all the others Tony had ever seen before. His species were always more lean and fit, more bulkier and taller compared to him. Yet he was certainly Glad he had found him last night while walking home. The poor guy looked absolutely beat up, tired and hungry.
Steve couldn’t help but smile as he walked across the city streets with the small incubus by his side, the adorable demon was openly glancing around as he held his new master’s hand tight. Clearly enjoying the little stroll as much as Steve was. His little wings that didn’t seem to be meant for flying flapped cutely from behind him. It was a sight to behold really.
Making the other roll his eye at the joke before grabbing a fistful of peanuts. Eyes trying not to stare too much at the big blond as he obviously stuttered in between awkward laughs in front of the girl he was standing next too. Tony scowled as he really shouldn’t feel hurt at the sight of Steve flirting with someone. Especially since Steve and him were such good friends.
“Okay...and remember if anything goes wrong..like you wake up in the middle of the night and I’m not there..I’m coming home..” Tony said seriously as he got his bag ready. Steve just rolled his eyes before smiling warmly at him. “Bye Tony..have a safe trip..” Steve said before giving Tony a soft lick on the cheek making the small man blush before coughing. “Okay...well see you on Thursday..Clint! Nat! Please take good care of him” Tony waved before being pushed inside the cab by Clint. “ go on Romeo...pepper’s gonna be pissed if you miss your flight again”
But no matter how much he wanted Steve he felt embarrassed with himself. The thought of taking advantage of their situation was enough to turn him off as he didn’t want Steve to only ‘be with him’ cause he had too. He cursed as he bit his lips as he trembled in his release.
“So..ugh what do you wanna do now? Tony asked as he felt Steve’s hand wrap around his fingers that were busy combing him. Steve hadn’t answered right away as he continued to gaze at Tony. “ i wanna kiss you...” Steve blurted out with the softest expression he could give before his eyes widening in horror at the realization of what he had just said. Tony blinked at him a few times at what he had said. “A kiss? So soon?...well i guess there really isn’t much after holding hands..i never kissed anyone before...so this really could be a big help” Tony thought out loud with a blush as he placed one of his hand over his mouth which made Steve redden as well.
Tony didn’t hear the last part as the part where Bruce had said that anyone could of spotted Steve, that anyone could of done something with him. The thought alone made him want to vomit as he stared at the tiny awkward hybrid sitting in the chair. Hating how anything could of happened to the small blond. He was snapped out of his thoughts when he heard Bruce repeat his name. “I’m sorry what?” He asked as he snapped his head to look at the vet. “ i said if you want you can leave him here and I could help find him someone to take care of him”
Steve frown at that, his ears dropping low in concern. his face just looking undeniably adorable, Tony swore his heart forgot to beat at the sight. “I’m fine Steve...” he assured the worried hybrid. “You don’t know how glad i am Steve’s here Tones...he’s been helping out here with Nat’s heat real good!” Clint said as he patted Steve’s broad shoulder. Tony made a face at that, making Steve Blush at realizing what he might of been thinking. “I mean with the apartment Tony...Steve here had done his best taking care of everything while i got busy tending to Nat..it’s really hard sometimes when she gets into her heats..i practically cant do anything around..” a faint smile appeared in the hybrids face hearing the praise from the other blond . “I’m sure he’s done good over there..” Tony winked before yawning a bit. It was already late in L.A, glancing a bit he saw Pepper already laying on her bed tea forgotten on the coffee table near her bed. “Well..i better Hit the sack now..Peppers already snoring..” a slipper was thrown right beside his head at that “you three take care now..see you on Thursday Steve I’ll bring you some caps here for your collection” Tony smiled tiredly when Steve beamed at that. “Love you, bye!” Tony said and made kissing noises “bye Tones..Clint said with a blushing Steve waving at him before ending the call.
Nat and Thor boomed with laughter and applause as Clint sang out loud to i will survive while standing on top of the bar table where they were seated at. Bruce chuckled when he had sat down next to Thor, smiling in thanks as his friend passed him a bottle of beer. Grabbing it right away as to not get hit by Clint’s wobbly legs.
Once out of sight he couldn’t help but smile at how the office had smelled of him and Tony’s scents mixed together. He knew it wouldn’t go away for atleast three days…Pepper would have a hard time for the next hour. But really, Steve didn’t care.
Tony giggled as he watched the blond join his team in the field again. Bucky was there too, all charm and smiles as always, and Tony would stare at him with dreamy eyes. But every so often he’d find himself glancing back at Steve who was busy shouted and running with the rest of the team, looking all sweaty and happy as he passed the ball to another player. A small blush would creep up the brunette’s face whenever the blond would look at him, grinning like a cute little kid that had a lollipop.
The two didn’t stop not even for air, Steve only gasping in shock when he realized that Tony’s hand had started traveling down his thighs. “T-Tony?” Was all the omega could manage as he stared lustfully at the blushing alpha. Confusion on his face as Tony had never been this brave before.
Holy Crap..it was Steve Rogers, the star quarterback of the football team, Bucky’s seriously scary best friend that kept giving Tony those weird looks, kinda like what he was giving him right now. Tony resisted the urge to squirm in front of the blond’s intense gaze while he tried desperately to maneuver himself away from the massive teen that was towering over him. “Steve...your scaring him...” the voice from earlier called out making the blond and Tony snap their attention away from each other. Oh gosh it’s Bucky! Tony internally squealed as he turned bright red. Heart thumping fast as the sweaty senior came up to them with the most charming smile. “You okay there doll?” Bucky had asked him with a wink as he got closer. Tony could only nod as his words had seemed to get tangled inside his mouth. “Sorry bout that Steve here can be a real monster with the ball..” the blond teen had frowned at that and had said something but Tony was too busy staring at Bucky to actually hear what the other teen had to say. Even though the taller brunette wasn’t actually looking at him anymore as it seemed Bucky was waving at some of their teammates that were still on the field.
When Thor had finally released Tony, the engineer coughed before smiling widely as he said with a fond look that they were going to have a swell time together. Steve staring annoyingly at him as he grabbed the other hybrids arm and lead him to their kitchen. He didn’t Think he was going to have a swell time..
Tony was practically radiating with joy when he strolled through the airport. in about half an hour from now he’d soon be with his darling hybrid. He was sure Steve would right away cling to him and never let go as soon as he’d step foot in their building. Pepper was smirking as she stared at the goofy smile Tony had across his face. “Thank you again for going with me Tony..i know how much you missed Steve the whole time we were away..” Pepper mused as she placed a kiss on the engineer’s cheek. Tony just gave her a look saying ‘anything for you’ with a mix of ‘you owe me more coffee and donuts’. The red head just grinned and quickly called for a cab headed their way. Immediately once the cab pulled over, the cab driver got out and helped them with their lag-gage. Pepper getting in right away as she started typing on her phone. Tony was about to get in too when he suddenly spotted something from across the road that made him look twice and stop what he was doing.
Fuck! This wasn’t what was supposed to happen. He was supposed to be happy today of all days but now all he could think about was Steve. Maybe he shouldn’t of said it like that maybe if he had-what? Oh god he was a mess..he really really hated himself right now. “Hey Tony! Hows-ugh you feeling okay?” A red haired beta ask as he came closer to him. “Not really...i think i might have the jitters Pep..” Tony said as he tried not to vomit. Pepper frowned at that “oh...i know things like this can be overwhelming sometimes but-“ before she could continue Tony had held his hand up in front of her “hold that thought-mmmm” “oh my god...” Pepper wince as she watched Tony disappear into the crowd looking like he was about to poke. Well could be worst...She thought.
But no matter how much they cared for each other the two didn’t always see eye to eye on things, especially when it came to Steve. Tony was head over heals for him and yet Pepper had always been a little on edge ever whenever the blond hydra was with them, whispering to Tony she had a bad feeling about the man but Tony had brushed it off as he was so infatuated by the Hydras charm and pleasing personality. He was like a knight in shining armor ready to rescue Tony from whatever prison he was in.
“Clint!” Nat whimpered as she gripped on the bed sheets, her ass high up in the air with her tail twirling around impatiently for her owner. “I’m here! I’m here Nat...sorry..” Clint rushed to her side kneeling beside her on the bed whispering soft praises. Steve had seen them before during Nat’s heat the first time when he couldn’t do anything. But the scene and smell were always overwhelming. He swallowed hard as he watched Clint gently push a finger in her. How he whispered soft praises while placing kisses around the back of her neck before biting her harsh. Making Nat tremble and moan in pleasure. He wondered if He and Tony could have that. Could experience what Clint and Nat were experiencing. It looked so much more intimate than simply hugging or licking. But it seemed a bit far fetch as Tony never went into heat as a human. And as a male Hybrid as well he didn’t have heats like females did..a male hybrid would only be triggered sexually when smelling a females arousal. Which for some reason he never got from Natasha. But Tony always got aroused he thought. Maybe..if he could just corner the brunette maybe he could- “Ohhhh Clinnnttt ahhhh” Natasha’s loud moan cut him off his thoughts as he realized he was still standing there stupidly watching Clint tend to his needy hybrid.
“Thats Tony, and your right...I can’t really keep two. One of them might starve if i cant feed them both enough...clearly it’s gonna be this big guy since he’s so protective of his lil brother..” Natasha trailed as she gave the incubus sitting by her side a gentle pet. “That’s why i called you here...I’m giving Tony to you!” She then turned with a wide smile. Making Steve’s eyes widen. “W-what?!! you’re giving him to me? W-why? I don’-“ Steve stuttered as he wasn’t sure he would be able to take care of a demon. The red head rolled her eyes at him before giving him a look. “Look Steve...you’re over worked. You have no fun. And your a total kill joy to be around when you don’t get laid which is always..you need him, Tony could really help you out!” the blond couldn’t help but scowl and blush at his friends words. Mouth opening and closing as he didn’t know if he should defend himself or admit that he was all those things.
Tony tried to hide his growl with a strangled groan. Unsure of how to reply with such an alluring voice. “Um…i..y-yeah i kinda did…” Tony confessed as he resisted the urge to growl again when Steve had hit his sweet spot. Ohhh how great it was to have an omega on the team. “You should have some of the donuts i bought…their freshly baked…i got those jelly filled ones you liked.” Steve mused as he gently traced his hands up and down the apha’s arms. Before running back to his shoulders.
“Happy birthday Steve..” Tony said with a charming grin. All the Hybrid could do was smile and purr in happiness as he dropped the box next to him and crawled towards his generous owner. He stuck out his tongue as he started to lick and nip at the Brunettes face and neck.
As he started to cradled the smaller man resting on his lap, the throne room doors opened with one of his men telling him his guest had arrived. The king nodded as he snapped his finger's for one of his servants to bring warm water and a cloth for them to clean them selves. chuckling when he saw the prince get red as a tomato at being seen by his people in such a shameful state.
Tony swore he felt his heart break at the soft way the omega was begging for him. Eyes all big, distress scent filling his nostrils..all while Steve tilted his head to the side, exposing his neck submissively At the alpha.
Tony blushed as he stared dazed at the handsome adonis he had just shared his first kiss with, That had been the most amazing feeling he had ever had in his entire life. He hadn’t known kissing could feel that good. His mother had always told him that kissing only felt good when you did it with someone you loved. Boy was she wrong..because Steve was no Bucky, but damn it that had felt amazing. He wondered what it would feel like when he was doing it with Bucky. If it felt this good with Steve, it would probably feel like heaven with Bucky. A frown had suddenly appeared at the blond’s face all of a sudden making Tony wonder what was wrong for a moment. “He might not think the same way as you since he’s kissed more than enough people to actually make it feel special for him anymore” Steve said with a scowl, which made Tony’s eyes open wide. Crap, did he actually said that out loud for Steve to tell him that?
“Where’s Tony? Wheres my bride?!” Killian demanded as he glanced around. “Has anyone seen Tony?” Maria asked worriedly, a few mumbles and whispers now filling the room. “I saw him earlier...he looked really sick..like he was really nervous” a guest said from the crowd. “ i did too...he looked a bit overwhelmed...he was about to poke last i saw him..” Pepper admitted with a frown.
Maybe it was because he just wasn’t use to seeing his friend hitting on a random stranger in the middle of a bar. And what if he was, it wasn’t like they’d end up together. Steve and him had promised each other that they’d both wait for their soulmates and never go on dates with other people until then. Call them hopeless romantics, ( which they really were ) but they really did believe in waiting for the right one. For the perfect match that would finally make them whole. Yes, they read the books..and the old stories Steve’s ma told them about love at first sight. Sparks flying in the air and wrist suddenly feeling like their getting pulled towards each other. And boy did they want that. After hearing the stories, both young men swore to never have distractions as they’d wait for the one that was meant for them.
And Tony couldn’t stop the growing grin from his lips at that. Ignoring the dull ache he felt inside his chest again.
Right now though there was no point in hiding what he was feeling as he continued pressing his dick harder and faster against the sleeping brunette. Moaning and gasping as he smelled Tony’s arousal ger stronger.
“ a trip to L.A??” Tony asked with a worried face. “It will only be for two days ...” Pepper promised as she begged him to say yes. “But what about Steve? I cant leave him alone...you know his never been on his own in the apartment..” Tony said as he folded his arms across his chest. “Then get someone to sit him...Clint’s just a couple of feet away..and is good with Hybrids..I’m sure he wont mind Natasha having company” Pepper pleaded as she tilted her head and gave him a puppy dog face. Tony rolled his eyes as he gave up. “Fine..I’ll ask Clint later if he’ll sit for him...seriously pep...your good at your job, even almost as better as me...almost..” Tony mused as Pepper playfully punch him before giving him a big hug as a thank you.
After that incident the two hadn’t had anymore further physical contact than touching and kissing inside any of their houses. Their parents had made it their sole purpose to interfere with the two teenagers as much as they could. Steve eventually easing down on his advances as most of the omega’s had gotten the hint that he wasn’t backing down for no one. Only a few brave souls would try and flirt with the alpha by the end of the school year. Not caring if they’d get a broken nose from the tiny blond. It also helped that Steve actually gained a bit of meat in him, it wasn’t much but at least he wasn’t as thin as when he and Tony met. On the last day of school though Steve had to remind a few omega’s again that Tony was his when he had spotted them smothering the Alpha with hugs and letters ( that Steve immediately threw away ) The said omega’s threw him the old stink eye as he stomped his way between them and his flustered alpha. Giving them hard looks before going soft when he turned to his alpha who was already clutching at his side. The poor rejected omega’s crying in the hallway when Steve had left victorious once more.
Bruce nodded at that. There was no hating on a person who had finally found their destined match. Even if that person was a prick. people only tended to date for the sake of not feeling alone until they finally found their match. It wasn’t uncommon for the one’s who haven’t found their soulmates yet to feel a little hurt once the other had left them.
“Wow a royal hybrid...I’ve only seen them on TV..” Nat gushed as he watched with curiosity at the new hybrid. “There’s nothing really special about him... they aren’t even really royals...just that their ancestors where the hybrids of the pharaohs back then...” Steve muttered as he glanced at the two humans who were busy talking about the other blond hybrid. “Yeah but still...his the type of hybrid that humans actually buy...I don’t know it just feels like his worth more than us if a human actually spent so much money just to have him..i bet his owner’s really proud to have him...” Nat trailed. “Heck any human would be proud to have a hybrid like that...bet Tony’s freaking out right now...he sure looks like it” Bucky smirked as he finished grooming Nat’s ear, Nipping   at it a bit just for good measure.
There was a glow to the younger teen as he sat on the diner Steve had taken him to, the brunette was practically radiating with excitement as he sat across the table from the jock. Eyes big and beautiful as he finished ordering his food, cheeks pink as a rose as his mouth curved into a smile as he glanced up at Steve from the menu.
Coming back to this morning Tony cursed as Steve woke up startled and alert at hearing A loud beeping. “It’s okay, its okay..it’s just my alarm clock...I’m sorry” Tony tried to calm him as he stared at the brunette who got up to turn off the loud annoying beeping. “ wanna get breakfast? I make a mean omelette” Tony offered with a charming smile as he helped the hybrid off the bed. Steve just simply tilted his head as he didn’t seem to understand what Tony was talking about. Tony made a gesturing movement with his hand and mouth. Steve’s face light up as he realized the other was offering him food again. Tony swore he’d get a nose bleed at the adorable sight.
When the pancakes and eggs were served Steve had leaned very close to the brunette and offered him more of his pancakes. Tony being a man who could never resist anything his hybrid had to offer immediately leaned closer as well before opening his mouth and taking in the delicious treat. Moaning as his eyes sparkled from the taste. “I swear Steve I don’t know what I would ever do without you!” Tony said in between bites as he stabbed a fork on his pancakes. Steve beaming at his owners praise, glancing ever so slowly at the other hybrid who was busy stuffing himself as well. “Yes! He certainly is a good cook! My master would love your cooking too! Thank you for this wonderful breakfast Steve” Thor smiled as he gobbled his sunny side up. Steve smiled wearily at that, not expecting Thor to say that to him. Maybe Thor wasn’t so bad after all-. “Dearest Tony..i see you love the pancakes so much...as a thank you i shall give mine to you..” Thor offered as he got up and gave his pancake to the engineer. Tony smiling brilliantly at getting more of the delicious breakfast. “You know i cant say no to that...and you know what Thor? your really something aren’t you...you even have this funny way of talking..tell me, are you a royal blooded hybrid? You look like one but i wasn’t really sure at first...” Tony asked with fascination. “Indeed i am..i was bought by my Master for twelve hundred thousand dollars from my parents owners..” Thor boasted. “Oh my god! Your owner must be very wealthy to have that much money to buy a hybrid...god! And a royal blooded one!” Tony gawked as he didn’t even notice Steve stabbing him with a fork anymore. The engineer and the ‘royal hybrid now busily talking about his background’ a vain had popped on Steve’s forehead as he watched Tony get so thrilled at hearing more about Thor. Okay...he takes it back Thor was BAD!  BAD! BAD NEWS! with a pout Steve stood up and left the table as his tail swished irritably behind him as he listened to the two talk.
This chappy is full on raw unedited..so I apologize for any mistakes you might see..I’ve been updating most of my stories now so i’m sorry if i’ve missed anything
And right on cue the omega emerged from the bushes with a large basket in his hands. Steve immediately smiled at the beautiful sight before standing up to greet his wife. “What are you doing here?...how many times do i have to tell you it’s not safe walking on your own here...remember how i got this scar?” Steve said as he lifted his left arm up. Tony bit his lips at that before putting the basket down and pouting adorably. “That was one time and it happened five years ago...plus i know you’ll always saved me” he said with a chuckle as he leaned up with his tiptoes to kiss the alpha on his chin. Steve shook his head at that as he leaned down to let the omega kiss him.
Tony’s thoughts were interrupted when a knock came through the door. “Doors open” Tony called out. “Heeeyyy Steve...happy birthday!” Bruce greeted as he opened the door. “I got you a little something...” Bruce smiled as he tossed his gift at the giant blond who instinctively caught it. Smiling happily as the other hybrids gaped at it. “It’s a new pair of sneakers..i know how much he loves to run” the smiling vet said as came near Tony who gave him a slice of cake. “Thanks, I’m sure he’ll love it!” Tony smiled as he watch Steve unwrapped the present. Sharon and pepper had given Steve a pair of shirts while Rhodey had bought him a bunch of new video games that he knew the blond liked. While Clint had bought him a small bag of catnip that Steve didn’t seem to appreciate since he didn’t really know what it was. Tony tucked the bag away for safe keeping thinking he’d probably make good use of it someday.
As he walked to his locker he thought of a couple of things he’d like to buy later after school. Not noticing the small note that was placed in front of his locker right away. When he did noticed it though, his eyes widen as he read what was written on the small piece
He was pathetic. He really shouldn’t be wasting his time waiting for his brother who was probably out getting a girlfriend right now. The thought instantly left a huge ache in his chest. Which confused the teen, he really didn’t know why it hurt to even think of Steve kissing someone else, let alone asking them to be his girlfriend. Steve was his brother and their kisses were of brotherly love, or at least that’s what he tried to tell himself.
Tony couldn’t help but to give the man his thanks for saving him from a broken leg or nose.  The man had smiled at that as he as held the Queen a little bit tighter, too awe struck of how beautiful Tony was to realize that a certain king was standing behind them. When Steve had cleared out his throat to get their attention, Tony had beamed instantly as he jumped off the servant’s arm as he ran to give his king a warm hug.
Tony nodded at that, not minding the small blush that had appeared on the blond’s face. He must really feel awkward with Tony doing something like that. “So what do we do then?...how are you going to help me and Bucky get together?” Tony asked curiously as he tilted his head. A smile had appeared on the blond’s face at that, making Tony go red a bit. He had not expected to see the blond smile like that at him. Steve really was handsome, especially if he was smiling..especially if that smile was directed at him.
The three remaining girls instantly looked at one another as they giggled at the little scene before them. They would never admit it to the blond cheerleader captain. But they actually thought the two earlier looked absolutely cute together. Their giggles turned into laughter as well after thinking how Sharon would be so pissed once she’d get out of the restroom.
The first time Tony had seen his chosen Omega he had hid behind his father, clutching nervously at Howard’s side as he tried to hide his blushing face away from the grinning omega whose eyes seemed to sparkle at him. His father patting his head reassuringly as he talked with his business partner and old friend Joseph Rogers, Co-Owner of SHIELDS agency. One of the top leading security agencies in the world. Howard, proud owner of Stark Industries got most of his security teams from them as well. The two weren’t really close but when the two were given the chance to have a small conversation regarding their son’s. Howard was pleasantly surprised when Joseph had offered him his omega son to be Tony’s future mate. Howard had been a bit worried when Tony had presented as an Alpha but didn’t seem to have the alpha traits one needs to find a suitable mate. Tony was already 13.
oh dear sweet God, he repeats..he was eternally grateful to have Steve. Beautiful, Sweet, considerate and unselfish Steve. The Alpha right away obeyed his omega as he closed his eyes and leaned into Steve’s broad shoulder. Completely unaware of the unconscious Alpha being carried away by a few beta’s from behind them. as well as the omega from earlier sulking on the corner of the bleachers, staring longingly at him.
“Tony’s right…you don’t need to go home. If you want, i got an extra room next to the master bedroom…you can take a rest there if your tired.” Steve offered with a warm smile. “I’m also talking bout your friend here of course.”
The flinch didn’t go unnoticed as the omega frown at him. Tony redden at the realization as he didn’t want Steve to think he was actually scared of him. It was just that he was so unused to seeing Steve so strong that he’d instinctively flinch when Steve had just finished punching another alpha in front of him.
They were the same fingers he had fed Tony with. And the alpha couldn’t help but stare for a bit. Not realizing how rude he must of looked at that moment. Steve must of seemed to noticed as he turned his head at that and gave the alpha a sultry smile.
The blond stared at him as he sulked, staring at the untouched food. “I’m sure she’s alright...” Steve had tried to say as he leaned closer to the younger sibling. Tony glanced at him at that with a weary smile. “I know...she’s a tough girl...that’s why i love her...” the words didn’t seem to go well with Steve as Tony realized the blond’s expression had changed a bit. “Do you..?” Steve unexpectedly asked making Tony raise his brows at him. “What?” He asked a bit confused. “Do you lover her?” The blond repeated, tone serious as ever as his blue eyes watched the brunette. For some strange reason the way Steve was staring at Tony had made him want to squirm, Steve had never looked that way at him before. His eyes were full of intensity that Tony had never seen, Full of emotions Tony couldn’t read as well. Tony swallowed as he realized that the blond was waiting for his answer. “Yes...” Tony answered as he glanced back down his food. Not liking how Steve still held his gaze at him.
By Sunday Pepper’s uncle had arrived at their doorstep asking for the young teen to come home. With a frown Pepper had gave Tony a hug and a kiss before grudgingly going inside his uncles car, Tony frowned as he watched his friend go before closing the door and startling when he realized Steve had been standing there behind him. “You okay Tony?” The blond teen asked as he placed an arm around the shorter one. Tony just nodded as Steve guided them to the kitchen, it was already dinner time and Steve had finished making some spaghetti.
The thought had instantly vanished from his head though when he had noticed that the tiny incubus actually looked like a fucked out demon who had just been molested mercilessly. The blond couldn’t help his arousal as Tony looked at him tiredly. Crap, he really should feed Tony later. Looks like the bonding spell was too much for him. With a croaked out voice Steve asked Fury if everything was okay. Thankfully the man answered yes as he handed Steve the demons paper. Like expected his name sudden appeared and Steve beamed that Tony was really his. With a genuine thank you, the three went back to the front as Steve began paying for everything. A wide smile plastered on his face as he glanced down at his newly owned demon.
Tony could only stare in awe as Clint and the rest of the gang shouted in surprise as they stood up to openly gawk at the transformed omega. No...no..no...this wasn’t Steve..Tony tried to convince himself, Steve was small, skinny and not at all a giant, towering over most of their friends. And then The omega had stared directly at him with the same sweet smile he always gave Tony when he sensed the alpha getting uncomfortable. Oh my God...this was Steven.
When Tony had leaned into the kiss he had shared with the older brunette, he couldn’t help but to closed his eyes as he had let the sensation and alcohol take over him, moaning as he felt himself get excited at the thrill of kissing his older brother’s hot best friend who had always been there for him whenever the other wasn’t. He had tried pressing closer when he felt his heart begin to beat normally again, as if the thrill wasn’t enough to keep his toes curling as they always did when Steve would kiss him. Even the lightest brush of their lips would be enough to leave the younger sibling gasping for more.
“I’ll take care of you Tony...I’ll always take care of you...” he trailed before kissing the brunette passionately. Moaning as Tony deepened their kiss as he clung to him. Before long the two were clashing their tongues together, battling for dominance before Steve was able to push the other’s tongue back inside his mouth. Making the smaller sibling tremble as Steve bit and sucked his  pink appendage greedily. Hips bucking against his as the two started to pant and gasp at feeling each other’s bulges. “Mmm...Steve...s-stop...we shouldn’t...” Tony moaned as he let his head fall against his pillows, allowing Steve to suck on his neck. While strong hands started crawling underneath his shirt, pinching his nipples lightly as he did. They had always done this many times..but they had never took the next step, too afraid of what would happen if they did. Tony moaned as he arched his back at the blond’s touches. So good...it was so good...he wanted more, more of Steve...more of his brother.
“What’s all this?” He asked as he gestured to the large basket on the ground. “I thought we could have a picnic...after all it is our 19th bonding anniversary” Tony said with a smile. Steve froze at his tiny omega’s words though as he had completely forgotten it was their anniversary. He was never good in keeping track of these things. Tony seemed to sense this and immediately reassured the large hydra that it was alright. “But I didn’t get you anything or even-“ Steve was cut off as Tony pressed a finger on his chin. “You don’t have to do anything Sweety...you’ve already given me so much that I don’t know how i could ever show how thankful i am to you...” Tony said with a warm smile as he tried to pull his alpha down to his level. Steve thankfully obliged as bent down to Tony’s level. Blue eyes staring at brown ones before Tony pressed his lips onto his. The alpha moaning into the kiss as he felt his wife’s tiny hands palm his face. Their kiss lasted for a long time until Tony finally broke away for air. Panting hard as he stared lovingly at his husband. “Happy anniversary Stevie..” he whispered with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
"Handsome means you're good looking. Like if someone says a girl is pretty or beautiful, for a boy you would say they are handsome."
"Thank you." He said softly, then shaking his head. "Gosh, I'm sorry. I have to brush my teeth. Can't believe I kissed you with my morning breath."
They duo stood and shook hands with Rogers before gathering their things and leaving the two men alone once again.
"Yes, they are heels," Tony hummed, hands by his sides, "You wanna take off the robe, or want me to do it all by myself?"
"Still got nine months to go," Tony laughed, wrapping his arms around Steve's waist, "But yeah, I wanna see Pete. We should have group snuggles tonight, yeah?"
He ran his tongue along the underside a few times before sinking further, reaching down to cup Tony's balls carefully as he continued.
"Yes, sweetie, it will," Tony hummed, pushing reassurance through their bond, "Just concentrate on driving."
"Peter Benjamin, you know the rules for that computer." Steve scolded lightly, unsure of the extent of Peter's search.
"I see Peter managed to coax you up for blueberry pancakes, huh?" He said with a light chuckle. "Pull up a chair, I'll get you a plate. Coffee's brewing, too."
Steve looked at Tony carefully, wringing his fingers together carefully as he walked back over to the brunet.
Peter nodded softly, following Tony to the seats and settling on his lap as Steve headed inside the delivery room. The time seemed to go by so slow in the waiting, but eventually the waiting paid off as Steve came out of the room with a crick in his hand and a smile on his face.
"I would tell you if you hurt me, love. I have an insane pain tolerance," He reminded gently before starting his scratches again, "You gotta trust me on this stuff, babe."
"You're being good now, baby," Tony hummed, picking up the ruler from the desk, "I want you to tell me how it feels."
"Peter, no. Baby, we didn't lie to you. C'mere, sweetie." Steve soothed, scooping up the boy in his arms.
"You better hurry up," Tony muttered, trying to roll his hips onto Steve's fingers, "I need you so bad, Stevie,
"I'm sorry, Papa... Sorry I yelled and made you sad." Peter apologized, nuzzling into Steve's stomach.
"Everyone, need a quick meeting in the living room, please." He called, grabbing pen and paper and beckoned everyone towards the living room and scooping up Peter.
He chuckled softly, nosing at Steve's hair before kissing his brow. "I love you too, sweetheart. More than you know..."
The blond hummed contently, flopping down beside Tony and crawling to the other's side, kissing at his face gently.
noise come up, their knocking is startling the dandelions," Tony Stark sighed, looking up at Steve from his place, upside down in his armchair, "And make sure you hang up their coats. I don't want the Southern dust on my hardwood floors."
"Sounds good." Steve hummed, leading them into the kitchen. "I never thought things could be moved and delivered so fast in my life, though. It’s amazing." He grinned over to Tony, happily and started unpacking pots and pans.
"That's nice of you. I know he'll love whatever it is." Steve chuckled, starting to unpack the stuff. "He always loves stuff from Uncle Buck and Auntie Tasha." the blond grinned. "We'll get it out after the bed is assembled."
Steve smiled back softly. "Yeah... Yeah they are. We'd do anything through hell and high water for our babies."
“Pair Cap’s Super Soldier senses with a wolf’s? His senses are insanely heightened.” The billionaire pointed out “He could tell exactly what Bruce was bringing to breakfast and that it was Bruce bringing it here almost a minute out distance-wise. And through the chamber, no less! Its really fascinating, honestly.”
"Anything and everything," Tony grinned, sitting on the edge of the desk with his legs crossed, "Whatever you want, babe."
The title screen to the movie started to play, following Paramount's dance of stars over a mountain; Peter started to relax back into Steve's chest, quietly singing along. Steve hummed along with his boy as the movie played, keeping Peter snuggled to him as they watched.
Tony groaned loudly, gasping as pain and pleasure skyrocketed up his spine; his breath was short, but he managed to whine at Steve, turning his head to nip at the pulse on Steve's neck.
"Wish I could try walking sometime." The captain hummed, before shaking his head in frustration. "Oh, what am I doing? I am not supposed to be talking to you or any other humans for that matter."
"I'd believe it. And we will open them in private because I doubt the will be kid appropriate." Steve said, cheeks a bit pink as Tony was basically feeling him in front of everyone.
"Yeah, we're good. Won't make you watch it." Steve noised softly, running his fingers along each inch of Tony's skin slowly.
"I suffer from what you'll most likely diagnose as depression, PTSD, or something," Tony continued, "You've probably seen the tape from the 1999 scandal. That tape is very much real, and much worse things went on in the home."
Steve stood there blinking for a minute after the door shut, fingers brushing over his lips as he tried to process what had just happened. He snapped out of his thoughts when he heard his watch beep. Shit, he was going to be late!
“Never said I was happy about it. Just happens to be the only option for now.” Steve admitted, huffing out a soft breath in response. “Best thing to do is try and deal with it as calmly as we can. Stressing about it isn’t going to help, y’know.”
"Oh my God, I thought she still had another week." Steve said a bit dumbfounded until what Tony had said clicked. "Right! Baby bag! Just gotta add a few more things to it and its ready to go." He stated, running around like a chicken with its head cut off.
"I bet. Peter is probably going to get onto you, though." Steve warned softly, coming over and kissing Tony's temple. "You are the one who first told him that swearing was bad."
Tony seemed to be busy zipping everywhere getting everything else ready, so Steve though that he could make small talk with Bruce. Before he could say anything though, Bruce beat him to the punch.
He groaned at the thought and rolled his hips down, nails scratching red lines down Steve's back as he tried to keep himself from coming too soon.
"What's the matter, munchkin? Ya full?" Steve asked as they headed in the kitchen. "Wanna save the rest?"
Peter made roaring noises, which Tony quickly captured on his phone, smiling at the tiny boy stomping toward them in his teddy onesie.
He quickly switched positions with the blond, scooting down to mouth at his cock through the boxers. Steve made a soft preening noise at Tony, wriggling a bit under the attention.
Sammy babbled back happily, sticking his hand in his mouth to chew on while he carefully watched Steve flutter around the room.
"Well, that's good you don't ache as much." Steve hummed, walking over and smooching Tony's cheek. "Speaking of aches though, Bucky was the one hobbling around this morning. Which I found hilarious." Steve chuckled, hugging Tony from behind the chair.
"I can't each much, I'll throw up," he mumbled sadly, tucking his face into Steve's chest, "m'sorry."
Tony looked up from his pillow, giving Peter a look until the kid sighed and hopped off the bed, trudging back to his room.
“I have failed to reach Doctor Strange, sir.” JARVIS replied a moment later “His assistant Wong was there to speak with and wishes to inform you that Strange is away dealing with other dimensions extensively, and may not return for upwards of 3 months.”
The female student looked back at the woman, semi-accepting the sudden permission. The woman extended her hand towards Tony, which he graciously took in a handshake. The woman smiled at Tony and spoke again.
"I'll be able to tell you some of my would-be additions later," he hummed sweetly, lacing their fingers together carefully.
All Tony could do was whimper, only lasting a few more seconds before coming in Steve's hand, completely coating it, his chest and the bed in white stripes.
"Consolation is a big word, buddy," Tony laughed, shaking his head, "But thank you, baby. It means a lot to me."
"Okay. Okay..." Steve repeated, looking down at the blade and back up at Tony. "You just want me to put it somewhere? Not just...get rid of it all together?"
"Honey, we'll be on a regular exercise routine by the end of the week," Tony hummed, stuffing the breadstick in his mouth and grabbing another slice.
"If you say 'vampire', I'm making you be a naughty nurse," Tony grunted, scraping his teeth down Steve's neck to his collarbone.
"I wouldn't quite say 'startled'." Steve said nervously, rubbing his neck. "And you were moving around a lot. I sent a few letters at the beginning, but never got replies so I assumed you didn't get any of them." He said sheepishly.
The blond tried to lean up on his hands, faltering a little and causing Tony to grab him in reaction.
A small hand patted at Peter's leg in a consoling manner almost, Sammy having manage to move himself over to his older brother.
"I look forward to it." Steve grinned, slight heat on his cheeks. "I'll be sure to fit it into my work schedule. But when it’s warmer out, we're going for a run now and then."
"That sounds even more like science fiction than the previous thought." Steve hummed in reply, glancing back at the man. "People don't do that normally. That thought suggests Mr. Wilson had some form of extreme mutation."
"I'm.....I'm not hungry. I'll eat later." Tony pushed the food away, going to back to his phone. It was only a minute until his stomach growled, eliciting a sigh from him.
"You are gonna be terror on two feet when you really start walking, kiddo." Steve hummed, eyeing his two boys as they played.
"Thanks for taking care of him," Tony called over his shoulder, carefully strapping Peter into his booster seat.
"Tony, you can trust that there is no way on God's green Earth that I would ever intentionally try to hurt you in any way. I care about you too damn much...".
When Steve was done fixing up a sandwich for Tony and grabbing his medicine, he say down on the couch beside Tony, setting the goods on the coffee table.
Steve chuckled softly. "Yeah, we can watch Ratatouille." He answered "Don't talk with your mouth full though, baby."
Tony couldn't reply, too busy slipping his tongue into Steve's mouth, trying not to bite himself at Peter's screams of desperation from inside the sweater. He pulled back, hooting with laughter as Pete scrambled out, shooting them both dirty looks.
Peter nodded and grabbed three bags of pretzels before putting them onto the counter and trooping over to the fridge to grab three apples and a bag of carrots.
He stopped to grab the pajamas and new underwear for the boy before heading to the bathroom, setting the kid on the floor.
Sharon scoffed lightly as she set the bottle aside. "Well, sorry buddy, but you're permanently vacated."
"That sounds absolutely wonderful, thank you. Imported, you say?" She said curiously, bouncing Peter on her hip playfully. "Must cost a pretty penny to have it imported here." She hummed.
"Mmm. I have coconut balm you should use," Tony murmured, a smirk tugging on his lips, "There's other ways to keep them from getting dry, though."
He sighed happily at Steve, starting to relax when a foreign object started to press into his belly; Tony burst into laughter, putting his hand over his eyes.
It took some convincing, but Steve was able to assure the other he would be okay by himself for a few hours. Not that there was much trouble the merman could get up to, anyways. JARVIS kept a great eye on the mansion and kept everything on lock with passwords and selective access, so even if Steve wanted to try anything, it wouldn't be very possible.
"Mmm, I come up with good ideas sometimes," Tony laughed, kissing Steve back, "Okay, so I have an idea for Pete's birthday--"
"Tony... What is all of this? Why-- how did--?" The blond was so surprised and a bit lost that he couldn't get out a straightforward thought in the process.
"Not a chance." Steve told him, smooching the boy's cheek with a grin. "But it is winter break, so you get a break from homework for a while, okay munchkin?"
"If we don't like it, it goes in the box of things to never touch again," he hummed, putting it in the cart.
"You had done so well, Tony." He said softly. "Well, at least it wasn't with the razor blade." The blond said softly, lightly kissing the bandaged area.
"Whenever you want. It's only a half hour drive there, and being the nature of the store, it's open twenty four hours," Tony grinned, "You tell me when, and we can go."
"We're going to watch the Walt Disney adaptation of 'The Little Mermaid' so you understand a bit of what I have been talking about." Tony explained as he settled next to Steve on the couch, having JARVIS bring out the television from the wall and set up the film. "I also want you to tell me what all inaccuracies there are from your perspective as an actual merperson. If you are up to it, anyway. I think it'd be funny."
Tony sniffled and nodded, wiping his face again before settling down, trying to focus on Steve's body heat. "Love you," he mumbled.
"As long as you come up to bed at a reasonable hour, all right? I know how you work, and coming up to bed to sleep is rare for you when you work."
"Alright you, with me," Tony hummed, eyeing a wall of crops across the aisle, "Are you thinking of anything particular you wanna try? Or just pickin' things that suit your fancy?"
"I'm going to assume that if Clint knows about it, it probably is something from childhood. Which would be better not to talk about until later." Steve agreed, reaching to run fingers through Tony's hair soothingly.
"Just remember to do that only when we've stopped the car." Steve grinned, offering up his hands to hold as they headed into the hospital.
"Okay, okay, okay, calm down, Tigger, lemme unlock the door," Tony laughed, barely able to turn the key before Peter barreled into the room, gaping.
Tony shook his head fondly, leaning down to take Steve's cock into his mouth again before swallowing deeply, relishing in his taste before pulling off with a quick breath, nipping at the tender skin.
"Such a naughty boy, aren't you?" Tony cooed, "Getting aroused from a punishment?" He shook his head, gently running his fingers over Steve's cock through his panties. "All the better to give you a spanking, then." Tony held back a grin as he started the swats up again, switching back to his hand rather than the paddle.
"Is this one of those parenting blocks? Where we don't want our child to hate us?" Tony mumbled, leaning down to kiss Steve's forehead, "Good cop bad cop isn't a good look, but I really don't want him to feel like he can't trust either of us."
"Shut your face, Mister Stark-Rogers," Tony grumbled, easily swallowing the pills and glass of water, "When I can walk again, I'm going to make
"Uh, yeah. Yeah, I do." The brunet said simply, shaking his head. "I'll worry about it in a bit. Right now we need to get you--"
"It's okay," Tony mumbled, "It wasn't you, really. The video-- kinda set me off. It just pushed me over. It really wasn't your fault, lovie."
"Don't freak out on us, sweetie," Tony laughed, smooching Steve's cheek, "We can yell in excitement later, okay?"
"'m not mean. Just how things work." Steve hummed, leaning in to kiss Tony's lips gently. "I've planned things today, so good things come to those who wait, baby."
Tony smooched Peter's forehead, letting his lips rest against his skin, and for a moment, he knew everything was going to be okay, one way or another.
Steve came back in with toast and tea for everyone, setting it on the coffee table. "Thank you guys for coming. It really means a lot right now."
“Alright, cheeseball," Tony laughed, turning his head to kiss Steve's cheek, "You better go back to your place and get ready. It's bad luck to see the dateé right before the date."
"Mmm?" Pete looked up, effectively smearing blood over the front of Steve's khakis. He reached a hand up, blinking as he pulled it back, stained slightly red.
"Maybe more diapers, now that I think of it. Just be careful and drive safe." He smiled gently, leaning up for a kiss to Tony's cheek. "Love you."
Steve smiled softly at how big Peter was acting today. He was progressing great. But still, he didn't want the boy to grow up too fast too soon.
"Yeah!" Peter squealed happily, bouncing on the couch. "I've been pwetty good 'n Santa's gonna come and visit! He always leaves good t'ings when 'm good--"
"Peter, I can't have a baby. Only ladies can have babies." He explained softly. "I just haven't been able to work out as much as I used to, so I guess I'm getting a little... chubby."
He raised an eyebrow at the man and smirked triumphantly, flopping down beside the blond on the bed.
A tiny smile flickered onto Tony's face and he went back over to Steve, smooching his forehead. "Good. Get some sleep," he murmured.
He smirked and sped out of the driveway, one hand on the wheel as they made it home in no time flat.
"Oh yeah, you know something? Yeah, I may have a thing for this guy. But you probably had no reason of worrying about this whole situation. I'm pretty confident the guy is as straight as a ramp.". He yanked the door open and made sure to slam it as hard as he possibly could.
"Psych. First therapy appointment," Tony clarified, "Pep got me in....earlier than I expected. She nearly kicked my ass when I asked her to find a guy."
"Okay. Not looking. Wouldn't want to ruin the surprise," he hummed, laying back on the bed and silk sheets happily.
"Switch tactics, Rogers. Perhaps we have a Mary Shelley on our hands," Tony mused, flicking on his eyeglasses to peer at the arm, "Yes, it appears that some tendons and ligaments have been carefully cut away from the shoulder. Perhaps we
"Maybe it’s got me paranoid," Tony muttered, turning to bury his face into Steve's stomach, "Either way, I'm not leaving you, Steve. Whether you like it or not, you're stuck with me."
Tony tiptoed upstairs after he'd cleaned up the kitchen and flicked off the lights, smiling softly at his baby boy before heading to bed. He collapsed on his side, snuggling up to his pillow.
"Hmm... I think a break today would be good." He hummed thoughtfully, remembering how Tony had felt before sleep. "In the mood for kissin', cuddlin', and movies. After our guests are gone, of course."
"Well I didn't know if you could reach it quite yet. Didn't want it falling high up on your head or something." He murmured, picking up the basket and packing their lunch up.
"Don't worry about him, he's okay," Tony chuckled, turning his attention back to Steve, "And I'm talking to my robots. Great."
"You are very adept at teasing, Mr. Stark." Steve murmured, looking at Tony and leaning with the touch. "Almost as good as you are with sleuthing."
"When I find the time, we will talk thoroughly about it." Steve said seriously before turning back to Peter. "Now then, how about we watch us some Saturday Morning cartoons?"
"Tatii here is going to give ya a nice wash and cut for your hair while I go looking through and picking out some outfits for ya." Raavi explained, winking before scurrying off towards another area of the salon.
"Oh my god, he has one of those beanies," Tony whispered, picking Peter up so he could see, "Sammy's the one in the back row, second to last on the right."
"I know, honey. You're gonna be sore for a couple of days." Tony smiled apologetically, sitting down carefully as not to jostle Steve. "I'll get you more pain meds if you need them, but you'll have to get up eventually," he laughed.
Steve made a short hum, moving to wash Tony off carefully.  "Still. If they happen, I guess they'll happen, but I won't purposely hurt or bruise you."
"Yeah, yeah," Tony rolled his eyes, taking the baby into his lap, "I think you should go down for a nap too, Mister."
"We had to change him and clean him up. His other clothes are in the washer." Natasha answered as she followed suit into the room.
"Anything, babe," Tony murmured, "Toy Story? A Bug's Life? Ooh, we haven't seen The Little Mermaid in a while." He patted Steve's hands to unwrap so he could stand, grabbing his quilt from the end of the bed.
"This is quite a bit, Tony. Plus with the room? Kid can't ever say we don't love him." Steve chuckled, wrapping up another shirt. He leaned in with a kiss on the lips, nuzzling Tony's shoulder when he realized his hair was still damp.
"Mail. Like letters," Tony grinned, "We should put our tattoos in it, then. Whole reason we're here, right?"
"Yes, sir..." The boy said quietly, still not quite looking at Tony. He was nervous of the punishment to come.
Sighing happily, Tony fell asleep against Steve's warm body, a tiny smile on his lips. Steve hummed at the kisses, letting his eyes shut as Tony settled. Once they were shut, he was out like a light, emotional exhaustion of the past two days taking him under.
"We can sleep a little longer though. Sunrise is early, but you just looked so gorgeous in the dawn light, I couldn't help it." He hummed happily.
"It’s okay baby, I love that you're bigger," He purred, laughing and kissing Steve's cheek, "Yes, please."
"Yes, dear." Steve chuckled, soothingly petting Tony's hair. "Since you are laying on me, I'm sure you'll know when I know anyway."
Steve gave a soft nod, thoughtful and a bit sorrowful. He didn't know what these dreams had meant, but he knew they were important. Near the end though, as much as he didn't want to think about it, Steve
Steve made a surprised gasp as he was lifted up in the other's arms, but was too tired to complain about being manhandled. He let Tony carry him to the room he has been occupying, sighing contently as he was settled on that comfy bed he was really starting to love. He heard a quiet goodnight from Tony and a hand pet softly through his hair before he drifted asleep, a warmth and comfort enveloping him as he fell and awaited what would happen in the days to come...
Steve hummed at the touches contently. "We really did. Such a sweet boy. A lot has to do with how we raised him. How he learned being around you." He grinned.
The boy thought about it for a second before nodding carefully, hopping up to his feet. He held his hand out to Tony for him to take on the way to the bathroom.
Peter only cried harder and stuck his tongue out at Steve, shoving himself to his feet to toddle over to his bed, struggling to climb up onto it. Tony looked helplessly over to Steve. Steve looked back with a sad look to his face. He walked over to the bed and helped Peter up.
"We can start just like this; Just some kissing, probably a little making out here on the couch. We'll see how far it goes and what you're comfortable with for now, okay?" Tony supplied, looking Steve straight in the eyes as he did. "Do you trust me?"
"You would never end up like your father, love. You are far too good a father in your own right already." He hummed. "You are great raising Peter and you will be great raising the baby when we get the surrogate business settled."
"Better. A bit heavy, but better," Tony snuffled, eagerly slurping down the soup, "I guess I freaked out pretty bad last night. Sorry. My anxiety gets the better of me sometimes. I tried to warn you.”
The two went about plating up their dinner, settling down at the table to eat when Tony spoke up again.
"Non posso esprimere quanto ti amo, Steve," Tony panted, still keeping a slow pace, "la mia anima gemella, il mio vero amore, un marito di essere e un protettore e
He flicked an eyebrow up, forgoing the paddle to first see what played out; he hiked up Steve's skirt, clicking his tongue at the lacy panties and garters that barely covered his ass. "You know this type of undergarments aren't allowed, Steve," Tony clicked his tongue, "What do you have to say for yourself?"
Tony sighed and nodded, placing a quick kiss on Steve's cheek before kicking his shoes off and heading over to Peter's room. He knocked on the door and tried the handle, not surprised to find it locked.
Steve knocked on the door again, although Tony had said the door was unlocked. It wasn't polite to just waltz into someone's home.
"Your eyes aren't even open, how could you know munchkin?" Steve chuckled lightly, smooching the top of Peter's head. "Plus it’s under you, not in front of you."
"Only trouble you really cause is running that pretty mouth of yours." Steve smirked, running the belt lightly up Tony's bare backside slowly. "Need to stay quieter sometimes."
“Sorry buddy, but ya gotta do the time for your crime of passion.” The blond chuckled, earning a whine from his Pokémon in response.
"Other students have been complaining about your rude behavior in class," Tony threw out, "And today I got a complaint from one of your teachers regarding your attitude and language towards them. We do not tolerate such disrespect here, do you understand me?"
Steve sighed softly, watching Tony go. He wasn't going to let Tony leave down there by himself right now. He's done too much of that lately and it was the holidays, more or less. Time for being with loved ones.
"It's Steve." The blond said as he appeared. "You have quite a bit there, huh?" Steve gave a careful look.
"I'll say." Steve panted, limbs twitching as he lay and fell from his high. He turned and left lazy kisses across Tony's face. "That went a different direction than I thought it would. In a great way, wow."
"Show me." He asked, gazing up at Tony from where he was sitting. "If you show me somehow, I'll believe. And I'll keep my job with you."
Tony took a quick breath before pulling the box out of his pocket, setting it on his chest over the scars across his breastbone. Steve's heart skipped a beat for a moment, eyes fixated on the little, black box on Tony's chest then glancing at brown eyes.
"Woah, woah, kid. Gotta get you gowned up and sanitized first," Tony pointed out, "Can't just go running in, sweetie."
"No, don't, I'll get your toy in a minute," Tony sighed, taking Sammy's thumb out of his mouth in exchange for his binky.
"He might need a change and something to eat. It’s been a while." Steve whispered, looking to Tony. "You feeling up to helping me out?" He asked with a soft smile.
He grinned, taking Steve's hand as he started walking again. Steve respected Tony's wishes, giving Tony's hand a squeeze as they continued walking. They made it to a small park, walking down the path as Steve heard someone playing music. A mandolin, of all things. As the music was starting to be heard better, he got an idea.
"Well hi there." The blond grinned, looking over at the man beside him warmly. He wriggled a little closer and started to trace small shapes along his torso.
"He's just away for a few minutes." Steve smirked, smooching Tony's lips and trailing soft nips and kisses along Tony's jaw. "You wanted me to play, so that's what we're going to do, sweetheart."
"I'll get you some more if you want, Peter." Steve chuckled, getting up to refill Peter's bowl. "No need to steal Daddy's food. Just ask for more, son."
With each bandage, he left a small kiss on top sweetly. "There. All done, Daddy." He proclaimed, snuggling into Tony.
"He thinks I'm good looking. He's quite the charmer." Steve grinned. "Daddy's says 'Twenty-Five Dollars'. When I first met him, he had on a scarf to hide his tattoo and the price tag was still on it. Why he spent $25 on a scarf still confounds me to this day."
"I don't see how chewing on fingers is like me, but I can see the determined part." Steve smirked, letting Sammy chew his finger.
Tony could only whimper in response, eventually crying himself to sleep in Steve's arms. His snores were louder than usual, accompanied by the occasional whine. Steve tried to fall asleep with Tony, just feeling the man exhausted in his arms. He nuzzled the other's cheeks gently, wiping away the leftover tears before finally being able to drift off.
Peter whined softly and nodded, shakily holding his arms out for Steve. Tony passed him over, smooching each of their heads.
Peter nodded and settled against Tony's chest, ducking his head into his father's neck before closing his eyes, trying to drift off to sleep. Steve petted Peter's hair until he felt the boy fall asleep, sighing gently as they waited.
"He sure does, baby," Tony replied softly, sticking the straw in Pete's juice box before handing it to him, "I bet you're going to get a lot of gifts this year, since you've been so good for Papa and I."
"I don't want to pick one DNA over the other," Natasha replied carefully, earning a laugh from Clint.
The boy nodded and laid his head back down, yawning as he watched the nurse bring out a small bag--a gift from the hospital, Tony noted-- and Sammy in her arms. Tony
“I do too. It’s one of those places I never could even dream of having. It really is beautiful." He said wistfully, kissing the top of Tony's head.
"M'fine," Peter garbled through a mouth of cereal, taking a moment to chew before swallowing, "Can I take my Batman pajamas?"
"Speaking of talking, I have something I need to talk to you both about a little later in private." He murmured.
"Yeah. I like it tight," Tony murmured, tugging it again before unclipping it and putting it in the cart. He grabbed a second one--a brilliant red--and added it before moving on down the aisles, dragging Steve to the lingerie section. "Look for ones without the crotch," Tony told him, smooching his cheek, "Sounds weird, yeah, but it means I can fuck you without taking the pretty things off of you. Or me. I don't
"I am still checking you over, love. Burns can be very serious." Steve insisted, finishing up his plate. "I would've found out eventually. You can wear a shirt forever, Tony."
"Well--" Tony bit his lip. "I wanted to buy the right house. With my soulmate. Didn't want to get it, and then have them hate it." He chuckled softly, a sigh on his lips, "It has three fireplaces. One in the living room, one in the master bedroom and one in one of the spare rooms. A gorgeous backyard, enough room for a garden, or swing set, and we can get a dog and fence it up--"
"It’s no problem. No problem at all." Steve smiled back sweetly, smooching Tony back and nuzzling into the touch.
"I love that you do, though. It's a good look for you," Tony purred, watching him hungrily, "It's gorgeous."
“You and Tony had a sleepover?” Bucky asked the blond, smirk of amusement still on his face “Was it anything like our sleepovers when we were younger?”
"No need to be upset, munchkin." Steve said calmly, petting Peter's hair with one hand and playing with Sammy's fingers with the other. "You did okay, buddy."
"I hope you like it," Tony mumbled, hand on the back of his neck, "I wasn't really sure what to get." He tugged at the pajamas he'd changed into, a shy blush on his face.
"Tony, good god," Clint wheezed, "You and Steve been workin' out? I don't remember you havin' this much strength--"
"It’s okay, love. We'll make you a sandwich and some tea to try and keep down, okay?" Steve murmured, helping Tony sit down before working quickly around the kitchen.
"The Star Spangled Man With a Plan. Standing up for people and freedom across the nation! Unafraid to sock ol' Adolf on the Jaw!".
Wiping his eyes, Peter splashed water on his face and tucked his feet under himself before calling out to Steve.
The man let out another groan in reply, letting out a soft whine as Tony teased and ran his thumbs over his nipples, driving him mad. Steve's hands ran along Tony's sides slowly, taking in each inch he could with touch.
