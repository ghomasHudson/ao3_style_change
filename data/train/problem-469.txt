“Hope you don’t mind- Sherlock asked me to come.” He scratched his neck, embarrassed to still be doing Sherlock’s bidding twenty years on. “And retirement’s great, but it’s nice to be needed.”
John went down to the hotel early that morning, wanting to get a head start on the centrepieces. He had taken the week off work, which hadn’t been an issue. His schedule was slowly edging its way into retirement, and he had already been taking a handful of days off every month. This week, he had deliberately made his way through his extensive checklist of wedding to-dos. Planning a wedding was a hell of a lot of work, and despite having had one himself, he didn’t remember doing half of this stuff last time around.
John looked away, fiddling with the seat-back tray and clicking it back into place. The glass of scotch sat empty and a bit mocking in the seat cup holder. He mumbled, “It usually does.”
He needed a release. On a day that he hadn’t had a chance encounter with Molly Hooper, or walked by St. Bart’s, or ridiculously suspected Sherlock had been sending him coded messages through the
“We took a case in Paris that summer,” Sherlock said, deciding this was a story worth reliving.
John chuckled into Sherlock’s chest, vibrations echoing through his upper body like a bee’s shaking pollen onto itself. John looked squarely at him as he ran the length of his tongue slowly, slowly over his peaked nipple in lieu of answering.
The artist friend nodded along, clearly still more drunk than the other two. Watson’s face fell. “Can I stay with you guys?” she asked. “I don’t want to be alone tonight.”
The inside of the house was an eclectic mix of styles. A thin entryway lined with floral wallpaper gave way to a large, surprisingly modern space, where the living area and the kitchen flowed seamlessly into each other. John recognized the mirror from 221B, as well as a few other items scattered about, but the decoration was remarkably different. Sleek marble countertops, hardwood floors, and fancy appliances were made softer by worn-in furniture, a cozy rug, and an exposed-brick fireplace with a familiar skull on the mantle, where there was already a fire burning. Earl settled herself right in front of it.
“Your dad’s old things?” Sherlock asked, feigning indifference.
He offered to take Elaine and Yasmin’s luggage up to their rooms out of pure selfish interest. “What were those looks about, then?” he asked when they were in the lift. “When I mentioned my wedding.”
“Possibly a soldier/civilian roleplay. Preferably in uniform,” Sherlock’s eyes gaze appreciatively down John’s body, as if imagining him dressed in camo. John conjures an image of his own; dog tags slapping against his chest as Sherlock rides him. “Doctor/patient could be interesting, too.”
It was so good, the tight feeling of filling John, becoming part of him in this state of openness.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, unable to quite believe that the man in front of him was real. His voice was embarrassingly revealing, but he was too wrecked in his current state to care. John smiled sadly back.
The next morning, Mrs. Hudson makes them a full English to celebrate John and Rosie’s official moving in, her boys back together.
“Yes,” Sherlock breathed, nodding emphatically, thrusting up to meet John’s hand again. John was brilliant, perfect, incredibly intuitive- he knew Sherlock would need an outline, a methodic way to approach sex.
It had been years since he’d seen this, having tucked it away in the attic after a particularly nasty bout of drinking and reading and re-reading the entries ten years ago.
Sherlock stood to his full height and brushed off his suit. “I shudder at the very thought.” The pity written all over his face prickled the hairs at the back of her neck. What was he not telling her? “It was rude of me to press you like this. Forgive me.”
He let out a huff. So impractical. “Not to worry, that’s not on the agenda for tonight. Or any night.”
Sherlock took him into his mouth and pleasure coursed through John’s body. John’s fingers stroked Sherlock’s curls as his head rocked back and forth. John leaned his head back in awe that this was happening. That Sherlock was here, and wanting, and fulfilling John’s years’ worth of fantasies. “Oh my god,
Sherlock must’ve been there, when Mum died. He was THE
The grounds of the National Palace Museum were decorated for the grand opening of the Imperial Porcelain exhibit, banners and signs hung tastefully around the sprawling entrance. The museum building was massive against a green backdrop of trees, built to make anyone standing at the base of the steps feel the power of its grandeur. On any other day, Sherlock would have loved to explore the expansive museum grounds and devise a plan to break into one of the heavily-guarded, temperature-controlled vaults where the museum’s most valuable items are kept. Today, however, they had other business to attend to: finding Edward Shih to confirm he was the target for the tea, and discovering who had stolen it from Xiaowen on the Alishan train.
John notices the new items on the nightstand- lube and condoms. Sherlock must have picked them up today; the price stickers are still on.
“Setting up a cheese plate is
“This breakfast is shit,” John said bluntly. “And Mr. Let Me Know If I Can Help You With Anything gave me oolong tea, not black. This is a flight from London- he should know better.”
Sherlock begged for John to come, and with a physical confirmation that John would do anything Sherlock asked of him, he did.
She ran a frustrated hand through her cropped, black hair. She’d recently cut it in a more masculine style, easy, no-nonsense. One less thing to worry about. She shoved her mobile back into her coat pocket and held a little tighter to her backpack straps.
A bead of precome leaked from the tip, and Sherlock licked it clean before it could drip, wanting to taste it straight from the source. It wasn’t delicious by any means, but the fact that it was John’s arousal, distilled into a viscous substance available for his consumption, went straight to his head, making him dizzy.
“Fuck off!” he yells across the street to the couple. They give him a dirty look and start walking faster down the pavement.
I really tried to make it up, I wish I understood
John must have been smiling goofily as Sherlock rolled on the condom and stroked him with lube, because Sherlock blushed. “What, John?”
John kissed him, soft as velvet and slow as summer. “Good.”
John cleared his throat, as if retelling the events was harder than living them had been. “I saw the desk drawers had been messed with, so I thought the Ketamine could have been there. I was right.”
“Iris Lyu has dual citizenship in England and Taiwan. Her specialty is Chinese antiquities, and she was a historical consultant and curator for the Imperial Porcelain exhibit,” Sherlock read from Mycroft’s report.
Dad had done nothing but fuss about the weather on the train ride from London, but Rosie had been glad of it. The rain might serve to hide the sheen of unshed tears in her eyes. She and Dad had traveled outside of the Isle on holiday, and it wasn’t her first time in England, but aside from music camp for a week last summer in Geneva, she’d never spent an extended period of time away from Dad and Mann.

His suit is folded neatly on the chair next to Sherlock’s dresser, but he doesn’t bother with it. He opens Sherlock’s bedroom door, bracing himself for a sulking Sherlock, but the flat is empty.
“I’m s’posed to give this to you.” Her voice was raspy and harsh.
John.” John buzzed at the undeserved praise.
John kissed him, quick and hard. “You’re art, and I get to keep you this time,” he whispered into Sherlock’s ear, stroking him like a paintbrush on canvas.
They could improvise- he had oil in the kitchen, but that would damage a condom, and they hadn’t discussed their status- had Sherlock been sleeping with other people before he came here? Or-
Rosie turned onto the A5, past a row of posh houses and a painted puffin on a mailbox that reminded her of Stella; they were her favorite bird. God, Rosie was so abominably besotted that only two weeks apart had made her romanticize a puffin, made her skin ache to touch Stella again, to wrap her arms around her other half. But Rosie had also loved being home, surrounded by familiar comforts. The album was turning out to be a shocking success, and Rosie wasn’t used to this level of public attention. In London, she couldn’t go to Tesco’s without a teen girl coming up to her to ask for a photo. She was flattered by the attention, and loved her fans, but she was finally beginning to understand why Dad retreated to Manx all those years ago. She had wanted to be a musician to make music, not necessarily to be beloved in the eyes of the public. She only wanted to be beloved by a small, select group.
Later that night, Rosie laid awake in bed, Stella sleeping soundly beside her, fixating on Dad’s Angelo impression.
Watson’s sleeping. Stay there. I’ll come to you.
John opened his mouth to ask, but Sherlock cut him off. “There’s a dead woman, John. No time for pleasantries when there could be a murderer among us.” He had the glint of curiosity in his eye only ever reserved for cases. And John, in a time past.
Sherlock deflated, slumping back into his chair. “Yes.” He forced eye contact with John, meeting his angry, disbelieving stare. “I think you’re a good enough father to realize that Rosie will be in perfectly good care, funded entirely by Mycroft, for a week. I
“I don’t believe we’ve officially met,” Rosie tried, catching Sherlock’s eyes glancing awkwardly at her outstretched hand. They were beautiful, his eyes- layers of blue and green and grey. She inherently trusted them.
John snorted. “‘Unbearably grumpy’? Nice of you.”
Sherlock declined.
“Goodnight, John.”
Sherlock smirked. “She was a cleaner- she was supposed to deliver the water to the room. But she got thirsty. The murder device never made it to the intented target.”
Stella was a vision in a three piece suit. The coat and trousers were a black that perfectly matched her hair, with a white double-breasted vest and statement bowtie underneath. A thin line ran down the side of Stella’s trousers, emphasizing her stride as she made her way down the aisle to the arch. Dad had always warned her that sentiment was a dangerous game, but Rosie was so desperately in love with the woman at the altar, Stella could hold her at gunpoint and she’d thank her for it.
Stella bit her lip. When she spoke, her voice came out shaky. “What
John yawned, and there was a knock on the door.
He’d always thought this kind of thing- John being in love with a man, confessing it openly- would be a bombshell for Rosie. It was a topic he’d managed to stay far away from all her life, effectively hiding that part of his identity from her so as not to challenge what she knew about herself and her family. But as always, Rosie surprised him in the best way. She knew.

John thought), he moved his hands more deliberately. John relaxed further into the touch.
It had stopped raining by the time they arrived at the Grand Hyatt hotel near Taipei 101, but the weather did nothing to clear Sherlock’s dark mood. It was already late evening, and traffic in Taipei had been at a standstill, exacerbating the uncomfortable tension in the cab from the museum to the hotel. Their flight was arranged for the following morning, despite Sherlock’s best efforts to find a route that would get them out of Taiwan tonight.
There’s more, but John has to stop scrolling. His heart is beating out of his chest. Everyone knows.
“No, my God, Sherl-”
“You calculated that Magnussen would use the fact of your involvement rather than sharing the information with the police, as is _______”
John hummed his agreement, looking around at the to-do list of stacked chairs and tables and decorations around the room. It was all he could pay attention to, as of late. Unfinished business.
He blinked several times. She thought he deserved better than what John Watson could give. Oddly, the thought had never crossed his mind. He always rather thought it was John who deserved better.
, intense, and he needs more. He takes Sherlock’s hand into his own and readjusts them so their cocks are touching, leaking onto each other, rubbing against one another. John takes them both in his hand and squeezes.
“Time to get married,” she said with finality, and slipped from his grasp.
Sherlock swallowed, toying with the idea of throwing John out and having a well-deserved strop, but he was weak to John’s requests and his own curiosity. “Fine.”
They already had, and John was still desperate to see him.
- they have their hands all over each other. Sherlock slots their cocks together and thrusts, and it’s brilliant. They kiss, and kiss, and John eventually slows the pace so it’s sweet and attentive.
“He wants us to be how we once were, but so many things have changed.”
Even Sherlock paused his ridiculously long strides down the hospital corridor to listen in. “Rosie?” he answered, trying and failing to keep his anxiety out of his voice.
She glanced around at the tour group, who had quieted a bit since the train started moving. The two chatting on the other end of the carriage chatted about the weather in undeniable southern Taiwan accents, likely from Kaohsiung.
“No.”
He hadn’t meant to say jealousy, to bring that issue to the forefront under the current circumstances.
again!” Rosie shouted abuse at the mirror, staring wide-eyed into the reflection of her and John. Rosie looked so much like him when she was angry. When she smiled and laughed, it was as if Mary was pulling her lips. But right now, Rosie was livid, and she was very much his own daughter.
“Likewise,” Sherlock reciprocates. “I didn’t say yesterday, but that dress looks exquisite on you. It’s no wonder you pulled.” Clara laughs, and a spark of jealousy rises in him, completely unjustified, but provoked, nonetheless.
hungry, now that the tantalizing smell of fried food and white pepper clouded his nostrils and judgment. He popped one into his mouth and closed his eyes in pure enjoyment. Xiaowen noticed. “I told you so.”
at the edges. Sherlock moved his hands to cup John’s face, his thumb smearing a dab of wetness across John’s cheek.
She smiled like an idiot. She was star struck, and the hundreds of things she had wanted to say to him, to ask him, lodged themselves in her windpipe. Sherlock had always existed as an entity, and while she had spent time imagining what he was like, she hadn’t really considered that Sherlock was a complicated human person with a story separate from the ones she had read in the pages from Dad’s blog in his journal. And in her adrenaline-fueled, half-baked plan to invite him to her wedding as if she were John Watson, she hadn’t given weight to the very real possibility that she would actually meet him. The initial twinge of panic was rapidly spinning into a raging storm in her chest at the thought of revealing her ruse. The consequences of her impulsiveness were waiting just at the edges of her perception.
Rosie had driven her to the Crown hotel from hospital that morning, asking about a hundred times whether Stella felt well and recovered enough for the wedding after the previous night’s scare.
“A gardenia,” he recognized, taking the flower. The white petals felt smooth and cool to the touch.
Sherlock nodded vigorously, a bead of sweat from his forehead dripping down into his mouth at the exertion needed to fulfill John’s request.

John turned and burst into a wide grin.
Dad insisted on helping Elaine and Yasmin bring their luggage to their room, leaving Rosie and Stella to go to their own. They had booked the room for two nights- God help them if they had to spend the wedding night at Dad’s house. Just the thought of
Happy solving!
“Faster,” he managed, his entire being concentrating into the sensation of John’s strong hand stroking him off. He thought he may black out.
A cocktail of emotion churned in his stomach, threatening to spill. Why the hell was Sherlock here? He had no business showing up like this, the day before Rosie’s
Sherlock nods and lets out a moan that makes John shiver. John undoes the belt and zip and slips his hand inside Sherlock’s trousers to palm his erection over his pants. It gives John a rush, confirming Sherlock is as interested in the proceedings as he is.
“Anything to drink?”
, perhaps.
Her eyes welled. “But what if...what if I mess up?”
The next few days pass without John experiencing them. The first day, he sleeps. The next, he drinks. And drinks. John protests, but Sherlock stays on the couch. On the third night, Sherlock dumps John’s liquor. John weakly tries to fight him off, but Sherlock stays anyway. Rosie stays with Mrs. Hudson. Clara deals with Harry’s arrangements.
Sherlock willed himself to speak directly to John, “Pass me my phone. It’s on the desk.” He didn’t trust himself to say John’s name aloud in this emotionally heightened state. He feared saying John’s name would add a full kettle of boiling water to a teacup already filled to the brim, and he would spill over years of skirting around the unasked question.
And the words came so simply. “I love you, too.”
“How do you know about George?”
Dad came downstairs to greet them in a similar state to Sherlock’s, but Rosie didn't dare say a thing. It was his birthday, after all. Dressed in a worn, cozy jumper thrown haphazardly over a sleep shirt and jeans, he looked the same as ever. He smiled wide when he caught sight of her, wrapping his arms around her in a tight, warm hug that sunk into her bones. She was home, and Dad was happy. Truly, genuinely happy. She handed him the bottle of wine with a subdued “Happy birthday, Dad.”
“John, I,” he started, but was cut off by a sharp wave of pleasure as John slid his hand under Sherlock’s trousers to take his erection in hand.
And the
) Italian accent, rubbing Sherlock’s shoulders suggestively. “Sherrrlock you look-a gorgeous as ever. Would you like-a some ehspaghetti? Mamma mia!”
John’s lips curled into a smile, and he tightened his grip on Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock let his legs spread further apart, relaxing for the first time since he got into the car. With the movement, John’s hand slid up further, making it difficult to focus on anything that wasn’t the placement of John’s fingers. “It did, didn’t it?”
She couldn’t imagine why the two of them never sorted it out.
“I didn’t know I could,” John tried, and it came out small. A pathetic defense.
John nodded. “We had a close relationship. Or at least, as much of a relationship as two officers can secretly have in the army. If you’re asking if we had sex- yes.”
The answer was
one arm wrapped around Dad’s waist, one hand holding a glass of champagne in a quasi-toast to her.
Rosie smiled.
“Actually, I was hoping you could help me with my hair.”
John.” Somehow, this softness was far worse than a screaming match. John leaned further into the back of the chair. “You’ve lived an entire life since you left Baker Street. You’ve made a career. You raised a child. She’s getting married, and you actually helped plan it.” The ‘getting married
Rosie let out an exasperated sigh. She only wanted assurance that Stella was alright. “Tell me what’s wrong, now.” The ‘
John made the tea while Sherlock had a quick shower and changed into pyjamas. By the time he emerged from the bathroom, John’s teacup was almost empty. He was sitting in his chair, a fire lit, the very image of home. Sherlock joined him, sitting in his own chair. He spread his legs long, inching his foot close to John’s. He could smell the light floral hints and the muskiness of oolong permeating the room. John’s face was entirely too readable and open. Sherlock’s stomach did a flip at the possibilities with this pliable John.
But there had always been an edge of guilt that seeped into the pores of his relationship with Rosie, raising her without a mother. He’d half-heartedly tried to find a potential partner, dating a few women casually, but his heart hadn’t been in it. He raised Rosie alone.
Clara perks up at the sound of John’s voice and gives him a small wave. She makes her way to a chair across from where John and Sherlock are sitting and crosses her arms. She’s wearing leggings, a cozy mustard jumper, and large, bold earrings covered in colorful geometric shapes. She looks more casual than John’s ever seen her. When he knew her well, Clara always sported clean, expensive trouser suits and simple jewelry. John likes this new look on her; she exudes the same, business-like confidence, but it’s relaxed, effortless, even. She and John are the same age, but Clara looks much younger. It makes John self-conscious. “I should’ve known the wanker having the time of his life in the A&E was you, Johnny.” She smiles. “It’s good to see you. Shite circumstances, though,” she gestures to the bright red Emergency Department sign hanging above them.
Sherlock nodded, adjusting to a state of semi-consciousness. Sherlock never did anything in half-measures, so when he slept, it was a deep slumber. He needed a minute to reorient himself.
Like Sh’s face when he realizes the vaults are Magnussen’s mind palace
Outside, Sherlock presses John into the white stone wall and throws a cup of cold water on his face. The cold blast catapults John into the current moment. “Jesus, what was that for?” John spits, wiping his face with his suit sleeve. He doesn’t have anything left in him to give. If Sherlock wants to scream at him, or punch him, or tell him he never wants to see him again, or throw more water on his face, John doesn’t care. He wants it. He’s itching for a reaction.
Reception to follow
inside the man was enough to elicit a sharp moan.
John threw his hands behind his head. “Did you know you wanted to be my friend? When you first met me, I mean.”
1. Watson to Holmes in the ASiP case
Rosie bit her lip and closed her eyes, trying desperately to hold back her tears. He loosened his grip on the steering wheel, his own posture sinking in sympathy. Rosie was impossibly skilled at regulating her emotional response for an eight-year-old. She was holding back her own tears for John’s sake. He wondered, with a tinge of guilt, if she had learned this skill from him or
“Did you fuck George just to prove to yourself you could’ve fucked me?” The words hit John like hot tongs on his skin. He didn’t know where to begin with the wrongness of Sherlock’s deduction. He had fucked George because he missed Sherlock; it was a cheap way to pretend he was still in his life.
Sherlock sees all of it. “I know, John. But you already are.” They kiss again, languid tongues and gentle, rhythmic rocking of hips.
They stood like that for some time, in an embrace in the middle of Sherlock’s kitchen, just taking each other in, until Earl started to yip at their feet.
Stella’s connection to Moran had likely made her the target of the arsenic attack, but he hadn’t the faintest idea of why someone on this island would go after
out loud was liberating. He’d be casually slipping that one into conversation for the foreseeable future. He slid his hand down Sherlock’s neck, to his shoulder, to his forearm, resting it comfortably on the soft fabric there. Sherlock eyed it hesitantly. “‘Course I want to shag your bloody brains out, but I don’t want you to feel like I need that to be happy with you. I just- I just want to be around you, always.”
These being the words he was holding onto made Sherlock question his hearing. “John. You really don’t need my approval for every-…”
“She loved you so much, Clara. She did. She’s an idiot for ever leaving you,” he mutters into her hair. Sherlock looks at him from his chair wearing an expression of sad understanding. He’s thinking of when he left John for two years. John’s thinking of the time after Mary’s death.
It was all he could say.

gesture as loving as possible.
“Cute!” Weixian said in English. “Thank you, Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson.”
“Thank you.”
“As she should. As you should, too. Sit, please.” Sherlock gestured to a brown leather loveseat with a shag throw on top.
“Yes.” Sherlock’s voice was quiet, but John could sense the same desperation he felt in that word.
Sherlock was spinning in a whirlpool of embarrassment. He had been wrong; he hadn’t even considered that the seemingly innocuous wedding invite could have been sent under false pretenses. The air in the hotel hallway had suddenly shifted from stuffy to suffocating. Rosie had sent the wedding invite
“The tea is the truth, and not everyone wants that kind of power.”
John groaned. “What I want you to say next: six letters,” he emphasized the clue with a roll of his hips. Sherlock’s hands moved to John’s hips, encouraging the movement.
Dad pulled Rosie back involuntarily.
“John.”
“Indeed,” Sherlock brought his streamline attention back to Dad. “John, this morning, you said ‘one of our men,’ which reminded me that there was a man who gave his life for information about that bomb. After a bit of digging, I discovered it was the man to whom Jacqueline was
“Is it?” John risked stretching his foot to touch the side of Sherlock’s, pushing lightly. Sherlock’s tea-stained lips parted, and John smiled. Sherlock didn’t move his foot away. “People have been trying to set me up with Jacqueline since I moved here, but we’ve never even been

After the tension dissipated over more fried chicken, the three of them discussed the plan for the next day, agreeing to take the High Speed Rail back north to Taipei for a trip to the iconic National Palace Museum, where they hoped to glean some information about why the truth tea had been served on their flight.

“I...oh.” This was possibly the
Stella turned, her usual sharp, intense gaze soft and sparkling.
She opened the door to a very awake, very dressed Sherlock Holmes offering her a hot latte.
John sniffed, livid about the entire situation. This was John Watson’s worst nightmare: being chemically induced to talk about his feelings. Sherlock saw the thought cross his face of reaching for the gun in the security guard’s hand, but in his current state, Sherlock worried he would be far too obvious about it. John seemed to come to the same conclusion.
John looked at her through the rearview mirror. “But then, you can’t be in the orchestra.”
With some effort, John stood from the chair. “Get up,” he ordered. Sherlock’s eyes darkened as he stood. John took his hand and led him toward the stairs, but before they could get up the first step, they were kissing messily against the wall, Sherlock pressing into John, working steadily on finishing with the buttons on John’s shirt.
Two texts came just a few hours later.
“You’re so lovely, Sherlock,
Sherlock would know instantly, especially since John was still affected by the truth tea. He didn’t know which was worse.
“This is no insult to your cooking, John, but if you’re trying to be Angelo, it’s not quite working,” said Sherlock over his wine glass.
John wakes early the next morning with a mouthful of curls. He’s disoriented and groans internally at another headache pounding on his temples. He shifts, and unsticks himself from the person in front of him-
“Can’t say.”
Sherlock would argue, but he knew John needed to eat. The abrupt change in climate, time zone, and language was already wearing on him. He needed sustenance.
“I’m going to give up drinking,” John declares. “For Harry. And for you. For Rosie. And for me.” He can’t let his sister’s death go unlearned from. Harry died because she refused to confront her problem. John won’t.
John had lived the majority of the last twenty years without a spark of unexpectedness, and he was going to make up for it now. He was feeling reckless, the chaos of the last 24 hours manifesting into his own personal tornado.
John snorted. “With Mr. Let Me Know If I Can Help You With Anything serving the tea, he could have been looking to target
“Oh, I’m sure she--” He caught Rosie’s eye in the reflection of the vanity mirror, and his breath left him. Rosie wasn’t just gorgeous. She was luminescent, heavenly, the center of his universe. He didn’t know why he thought he’d be immune to the inherent sentiment attached to seeing his daughter in a wedding dress, but the sight was arresting.
hanging between them. He could take John to his hotel room (the one he hadn’t canceled after the first night, as he had so pompously declared he would to Watson upon arrival) and have him in bed before the band started playing a ghastly version of the Nat King Cole song that spells out the letters of l-o-v-e. Sherlock would be licking John’s neck by L, opening his mouth for him by O, getting him vocal by V, and wrapping a hand around his erection by E. But was that really how he wanted John on their wedding night?

Another choked sob escaped from Jacqueline, but Rosie had not an ounce of sympathy. That woman was despicable. She nearly took the love of her life away from her. She tightened her hold on Stella’s shoulders.

They kissed until the fireworks had long ended, until the stickiness on Sherlock’s chest was becoming uncomfortable for both of them.
Xiaowen was distracted, and Sherlock followed her gaze past a glass case of Tang Dynasty porcelain statues to the back of a woman’s head adorned with two black-haired buns. It was clear Xiaowen knew her, and was surprised to see her here- it had to be the girlfriend (Annie? Alex?).
“With the suspected dosage, it took a few hours for the arsenic to take full effect. Upon returning to the hotel, after Diana collapsed, I saw Jacqueline spiraling out- not a reaction of shock, but
Sherlock tilted his head in sympathy, but Xiaowen rejected this.
“You should try to sleep, John. We’ll have a full day when we arrive.”
12:43pm
Sherlock turned away to send the driver off. John couldn’t stop staring.
Oh, god. This is it, then. He puts his phone back on the counter, wishing he could just toss it in the bin.
“Sherlock, stop,” John commanded in the best Captain Watson voice he could muster in his distracted state. Sherlock did, and John, still leaning heavily into him, steadied himself a bit and looked Sherlock straight on. “What do you mean you’re an experiment for me?”
Sherlock considered, slipping off his shoes, lying down, and plopping his feet onto the bed. It was a bit short, so his feet hung off the edge. He had replayed the exact moment of their meeting in his head extensively, trying to analyze what had drawn him to John. “I wouldn’t have admitted it at the time, but I was lonely. I knew you were, too- it came off of you in droves.”
He was going to give in. She could tell. He sat back in his desk chair and gestured for her to come sit on his lap. A spark of hope bloomed in her chest.
When John pulled away, his cheeks were flushed and his eyes were alight with inspiration. “Let’s go, then.”
John watched her complete a mental checklist of everything she needed while he hummed the lyrics.
Sherlock moved his fingers that weren’t wrapped around John’s cock back to play with the fragile skin on John’s bollocks. The platinum band around his ring finger shimmered in the moonlight through John’s window. He started thrusting involuntarily.
A familiar, and yet very unwelcome, flame sparked in John’s stomach. “You think you’re dangerous, then?” He cocked his head, challenging. Sherlock met his gaze face-on.
“What the hell are you laughing about?”
.” He knew it was bordering on pleading, but he didn’t care. He shifted onto his side to face John, their noses nearly touching. “Baker Street isn’t complete without you, John.”
years ago in the army, he’d appreciated a slow, full prep. Currently, his efforts were being rewarded with quickening breath and low moans that were going straight to his groin. He was aching with the thought of his cock replacing his fingers inside this inexplicable man.
“I wuv you!” Rosie calls from her chair, to no one in particular.
Delia gave John a sympathetic smile, and he had to look away. One thing (among many) that he missed about London was privacy. It seemed like the entire island knew who he was and where he’d come from, and he couldn’t stand being coddled for being a widowed single father. “I hope you don’t mind, Dr. Watson, but Rosie here insisted. I gave her a pink streak.”
“God, John, I mean it. You’re so
“The TD-12 makes everything foggy. The truth tea helped for a bit, but most of the time I feel like I’m living two separate timelines simultaneously, the one in my head and the one in reality.”
Sherlock winced. It would have taken less time to list what was right. “I’m sorry, John, I don’t know how that happened,” he tried with as much neutrality as possible. Of course, he knew exactly how it had happened: Sherlock had never fully recovered from the last time John had walked out on him ten years ago, on their life together at 221B. The two of them had been thrust into each other’s orbit for the first time since then, and with their inhibitions weakened by grief, they stumbled into a pastiche form of comfort in the shape of sex. Stupid, needy sex.
“When I was...away.”
It had helped his generally surly mood these last few months to put his energy into something joyful. It was possible he was overcompensating, but then again, he had raised Rosie overcompensating for some parental lack in almost every way, and she had turned out alright. More than alright. Lovely, wonderful, perfect. Unprecedented in the history of children.
There was Sherlock, scolding John for butchering Rosie’s curls and magically wielding the scissors himself. Sherlock moving her into the dormitory for the first time, verbally ripping her roommate’s family photo collage to shreds. Sherlock standing with Dad as she came out to them, telling her he’d known for years.
John opened his mouth to disagree, but the pleading look Rosie shot him in the mirror stopped him. “Fine. Let’s take you to Ms. Delia’s, yeah? I bet she can fix it up.”
John couldn’t bear to sit and pretend like his worldview hadn’t just been shaken in a snowglobe. “I just- I need a moment.”

Sherlock shot a quick text to Mycroft asking for details on Iris Lyu.
Stella took another drag on her pint, considering. “Would you consider an affair?”
“No need for dramatics,” Sherlock chided. “I’ll take a cup.”
Sherlock waved him off. “That’s besides the point.”
Emil eyed Dad cautiously. “Do I take it the wedding is canceled?”
The taller friend was looking at Watson with concern. “I’m sorry, Mr. Holmes, Rosie’s had a really tough night. We’re just gonna…” she pointed her chin to the lifts, but Watson protested, standing her ground.
As he closed his eyes to sleep, he heard a low groan of pleasure over the run of shower water.
If John was going to propose, he needed to do it properly. He knelt down on one knee.
John met this with enthusiasm, guiding Sherlock with his hands and mouth down onto the bed. He slotted their legs together and ran his left hand down from Sherlock’s cheek to his neck to his chest to his stomach. This horizontal position, well. This was good.
Not a single facial hint of surprise crossed Mycroft’s features. He had expected this request, then, but obviously hadn’t offered it. “Do you think that’s a good idea, little brother?” The question dripped with patronization.
“Yes, alright, okay.” John runs a hand through his hair, exasperated. Sherlock is awake and sitting up, now, bare chest exposed and distracting. John’s eyes linger on the scar there, and he feels a pang of regret. Sherlock notices, of course, and quickly pulls the blanket in around him. “Give me a minute, I’ve got to get Rosie up. You can send Clara up, though. She can wait in the sitting room.” Sherlock leans back against the headboard, clearly disappointed with the turn of events. John kisses him on the forehead, and he seems slightly mollified. John hears steps in the sitting room and groans, wishing Clara had popped by just an hour or two later so he and Sherlock could have woken up properly.
Right. Sherlock told John himself that he had all but written off him and his
His gut reaction was a resounding
John more than he would care to admit.
The pang of anxiety about all of his unread notifications hits him in the gut. “I didn’t see the video, but I know about it. A reporter called Stimson texted me for an interview. There might’ve been more, but I didn’t get that far.”
“I am.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “I believe that’s simply a Watson family trait.”
John growled. “I want you to come for me, Sherlock.”
An odd expression crossed John’s features at Sherlock’s display, one he couldn’t read. “I have about 1,000 questions I could ask you,” John said, playfully, but Sherlock suspected he meant it.
Sherlock swallowed. “I’m not sure she knows, Watson.”
“I love you too, Rose,” Stella replied, notes of anxiety playing in her voice. She was so beautiful, with her soft skin and her sharp jawline and her eyes like infinity pools. In the end, it was so simple. All she needed for clarity were a few choice words. Now, Rosie knew exactly what she wanted.
He turned on the hot water and let it seep into his skin, which was a bit stretchier than it had been when John wrote A Study in Pink. As he lathered his lavender shampoo into his curls, he let his mind wander to thoughts of John running his fingers through his curls on Christmas night, the fire crackling. He thought about how John would have reacted had he turned over and taken John’s first and second fingers into his mouth, tasting them as he sucked. How John might have slid his third and fourth fingers past Sherlock’s lips, one by one. How he might have used his wet fingers to untie the knot on Sherlock’s dressing gown, then smooth them over Sherlock’s stomach and under his pants, and- oh god
John clutched the flower.
going to think about where Sherlock was going to find said lube. The likelihood that he would even find any in this house was incredibly low, and at this point, John was willing to improvise. He’d used yogurt in the army, once. He was not above that.
John doesn’t want a fight, anymore. His scattered energy has channeled into pure arousal. When Sherlock hands John the cup, perfectly steeped and milky, John’s fingers brush over his, imagining how they might feel brushing over the skin on his chest, on his neck, on his thigh. John sips. It’s hot, and it burns his throat going down. It hurts in a familiar way. John runs his tongue over his bottom lip and stares, open and wanting, at Sherlock's mouth. It parts. John scans his eyes down Sherlock’s body to catch the hint of a growing bulge in his trousers. John smiles victoriously. Sherlock lets out a shaky breath, and the atmosphere shifts. Sherlock wants this, too.
“Child’s play,” Sherlock scoffs, and John raises an eyebrow. “Literally, John. He’s a nursery teacher. Picked it up from one of the walking petri dishes we call toddlers.” John chuckles, and for a moment, he forgets he’s not supposed to be enjoying this.

Sherlock followed suit, sitting on his bed to take off his shoes. “Yes. You of all people know I go in for that sort of thing on occasion.”
“So, you say you want me in your life. Moving forward, I mean.” John was buzzing.
Iris dodged the question. “Oh, this and that. It’s mostly what other people are going to do with it. Bargaining chip, mostly. Don’t forget, I’m asking
Sherlock nodded, understanding. Upon telling Molly about the new development in his relationship with John, she had forced a heinous Internet quiz onto him about “love languages.” To add interest to the mind-numbing series of obvious questions, he took the quiz as if he were John and discovered that John shows love through acts of service. Which, obviously, he was able to identify before the quiz. The quiz had only given it a name.
It seemed that neither of them knew the right thing to say. Molly opened and closed her mouth a few times. John flexed his right hand. “You haven’t lost that habit, then,” Molly started.
Sherlock pushed John onto his back, climbing over him to run those large hands over his chest. He unexpectedly slipped down his body and wrapped his lips around the head of his cock, and John cried out.
Chiayi was a typical Taiwanese city, streets crowded with a mix of cars, buses, taxis, and scooters. The buildings were low and unassuming, and many storefronts had a display of their products outside. A few taxi drivers approached them, asking if they needed a car to Alishan. Sherlock scanned the station for Xiaowen- Mycroft had texted a picture- she was to pick them up from the station.
Knowing what the tea had made John say, the leaves in his pocket carried a slight flavor of resentment, now.
The Frenchman’s moans in “A Study in Winning”
“Yes.” John ran his tongue over his bottom lip, and the spark of warmth in Sherlock’s stomach evolved into a hot flame of need. A need to know that John was saying what Sherlock so desperately ached for him to say. A need for John’s mouth to form around a confession. For John’s lips to consume him.
“I checked the drawer above it, too- that’s when I found the tea compartment.”
But as usual, Sherlock’s deduction came to fruition, and Rosie sauntered over to their table with an overeager grin, carrying a rectangular wrapped gift in one hand, holding Stella’s with the other. The pair of them looked happier than John had ever seen them, and the besottedness radiating off of them quelled his anxieties about having taken over their wedding prematurely. This was what they wanted, clearly.
“Sherlock.”
his brain insisted, despite his efforts.
“I know better than anyone how emotionally stunted he can be, so he might need a nudge. But I’m sure of it, Sherlock. He. Loves.

The icy bitterness of the last few hours was slowly being thawed by the warmth of hope.
She tipped her head back in laughter, her grey hair messing even further, sweaty from dancing. She looked her age, but there was a natural youthful spirit about her that John decidedly lacked. “Well, would you imagine that: a man with five bloody names in this family. How did Johnny manage that?”
57. Test needed to travel, these days
“Redbeard.”
John winced. It was true. “I wasn’t good for you! I was…a burden.”
Xiaowen bit her lip as she studied Sherlock. She had been in the room, so she’d heard John’s conversation with Iris. She was keen as to why Sherlock was on edge.
John had to admit, now: this, being completely enmeshed with Sherlock, inside him, above him, in perfect rhythm, was an amalgamation of all of that, better than anything he thought he could ever miss.
23. Pimple, informally
John clutched Rosie closer and sighed heavily. “Yeah, okay. Fine. I’ll consider it.” He couldn't read the answer in John’s face. Sherlock was exceptionally skilled at reading John Watson’s face, which could only mean John truly did not know his answer yet.
“Not you, it’s-
have noticed- John must have grabbed it while Sherlock was using the loo. It was a case. A navy blue, velvet case. A very specific kind of case, and not the kind Sherlock was used to.
“Sherlock,” John says, taking his arm off of Sherlock’s shoulders to cross it over the other across his chest. The man in question sighs.
“The need is always there, but I’ve been trying to...take a step back, recently.” Sherlock took a large piece of prosciutto from the board and instead of eating it, fed it to Earl, who yipped in approval.
The afternoon was filled with Earl’s walk, on which Sherlock enumerated a grand total of six thriving beehives and five poisonous plant varieties. When they returned, Sherlock started a fire and poured a glass of wine for each of them. They sipped and watched the fire on the matching brown leather recliners as Earl kipped.
Rosie raised a brow. “Oh?” She had been instantly drawn in. It was her dark clothes from head to toe, the easy confidence that came with being a few years older, intense eyes that looked like they were reading her.
Stella: https://imgur.com/a/el3pF5C
“So, in fact, you. Love me,” Sherlock states. The pure factuality of it pulls John from descending into a whirlpool of self-hatred. Warmth pools in his stomach.
,” Sherlock pleaded, turning his head as far around as it could go, his eyes echoing the statement, blown fully dark. That look did it for him.
“It’s obvious you didn’t stay at your Taipei apartment last night. You’re not a morning person, and there’s no way you would have made it here in time. Amy lives just one MRT stop from this station. Your clothes are not yours- neither the style nor the size is correct. The way you’re leaning your body weight to the left side suggests that you spent the night lying on your right, your arm likely underneath another person. You usually sleep on your left side, so your sleep was agitated.”
When the train doors finally opened, the three of them sprinted out into the crowded station and up the left side of the escalator.
They were flying with a relatively new airline offering the first direct route from LHR-TPE, Jinmen Airways, and the flight crew was eager to impress.
“Not everyone is constricted by the gender binary, John.”
It was only eight by the time they finished, but even Sherlock had to admit he was exhausted. The jet lag weighed on his bones. As he was getting older, his humanity more often made itself known. He couldn’t survive on an hour of sleep for four days anymore. He had to eat and drink. He had...needs and urges.
“Hm?”
John tensed. This case was a sensitive area- the TD-12 had apparently fixated on this memory. Sherlock intervened, “Did you really? Shame. You could have saved me the effort.”
John saw it, too. “My god, that’s…”
Sherlock had been so confident downstairs, but some of that turned into palpable nervousness when they entered his bedroom. “It’s okay,” John assured, and kissed him gently. “We can do whatever you’re comfortable with. It’s just me, Sherlock.”
John was a better sport. “Good luck.”
He paused and read the clue again, not for a lack of comprehension but because he was taken aback by the familiarity of the story. He knew this answer quite well: OHARA. He had threaded the tale through his retelling of the Six Thatchers to make the lies marketable. Sherlock had said it was a “nice touch” (but of course he would, the dramatic bastard).
In his state, he somehow managed to slip his own hand into John’s jeans (bought in 2010 after landing his job at Sarah’s surgery, his brain pinged), and wrap his fingers around John’s (perfect, extremely stiff, thick, leaking) cock. His fingers stilled for a moment, just absorbing the sensation of John against them. He thought he might ask John to take off his trousers, but that would mean taking his fingers off of John for a second. Unacceptable. He started stroking, rubbing his thumb over the head.
Stella softened, and Lisa pulled her close. He wished Rosie had answered her mobile.
Dad took a long swig of his pint before answering, his eyes never leaving his mobile. “Yep.”
1:25pm
It had rained like mad when Rosie moved into Clarke Fine Arts Academy on the first day of her first year. She was eleven, and she was making an international move to the English countryside, to an idyllic town that looked like it pandered to postcard painters.
“You kept it.” John looked up from the bowl to meet Sherlock’s eyes. There was sadness there.
John made his excuses and made his way to the hotel bar for a pint. The bartender took pity and bought him one. The cold ale tasted of relief on its way down his throat.
John rubs his brow. He doesn’t want to face this. Lately he’s felt like a Jenga set, with critical pieces slowly being taken out, leaving him increasingly unstable. One more piece and he’s going to topple. His life was only just starting to feel normal again, as if the pieces were gradually being returned to their slots. John took an online anger management class and started therapy again, and even Sherlock is seeing a therapist specializing in drug addiction. He has a nice place, with Rosie. He and Sherlock are finally on solid ground. He thought he could keep going like this without shaking the blocks. Childish. God, he could use a drink.
He couldn’t make noise or get out of the closet now. It would only escalate the situation and potentially place John in more danger. Sherlock worked on loosening the knots around his wrists behind his back while he observed.
It wasn’t the Dr. Watson she knew. Rosie had a feeling that they all knew a different man than the one who solved crimes with his flatmate in London and blogged about them for the world to see. She explained that at first glance, the journal was rather innocuous, but in the last few pages, there were notes all along the margins in her dad’s familiar scrawl.
There was an unspoken agreement between them that they didn’t discuss the TD-12. They had a lot of those, apparently.
Molly cursed herself. For reasons completely unknown and frustrating to her, Molly’s filter had always evaporated around John. “That,” she said, pointing to his hand. “Your nervous tick.”
but he hadn’t made it very far. Despite his efforts, none of it made any sense. Sherlock would have cracked it instantly, he knew, and John cursed himself for being an idiot. He needed coffee.
“I won’t beg. You have some time to think about it, but not much. Mycroft needs an answer by tonight,” he said, all business. Maybe if John saw this as more professional than personal, he could justify it. John nodded once, stiffly, reaching down to pick up Rosie. He hadn’t even taken off his jacket or shoes upon arrival, so he was ready to escape. Sherlock’s chest ached a little at the sight.
49. Gun, as an engine when Mrs. Hudson drives
He turned back to Watson. Sweating. Mouth pinched. Anxious? No. Afraid. Ridiculous. Was she afraid of him or was she afraid of his exit? The latter was looking like the appealing option at the moment. Sherlock certainly couldn’t face John, not under these circumstances.

“Sherlock,” she whisper-yelled into her mobile, turning away from John. It felt wrong to say Sherlock’s name in John’s presence. She rather thought John didn’t deserve to hear it. “Shut up. Now. I’ve got to go. I’ve got to, erm, talk to someone.”
29. Grows weary
She had a casually likeable air about her that made it easy to agree. Sherlock came up with no retort, and threw his carry-on suitcase in the trunk alongside John’s.
The fire crackled to life, and the smell of burning wood mixed with the Manx sea air that seeped through the windows.
“That’s it, come for me, I want to see you come,” John huffed, a low mantra urging Sherlock ever closer.
Sherlock slides his bum up to encourage the movement. “Can I touch you?” John asks with a kiss to the angle where Sherlock’s neck meets his shoulder.
. It wasn’t that he didn’t have the money, it was the principle of going to someone else to pay for something he could do himself.
“The arsenic was in the complimentary water bottle,” Sherlock declared, rolling his eyes at the blank stares from his audience. “Jacqueline, here, cut off the water to Watson and Stella’s room in hopes that Stella would drink it. Quite sloppy, Ms. Mann.” He shook his head disapprovingly. “Not how I’d have done it.”
With the effects subsided and John back to stepping on the truth and shoving it in the deep recesses of his mind, Xiaowen drove John and Sherlock to their homestay for the night, accommodation just a five minute’s drive from Xiaowen’s family home. After the tea-fueled outburst, John, Sherlock, and Xiaowen made a plan to take the High Speed Rail back to Taoyuan in the morning to investigate Jinmen Airways. For now, Sherlock and John would enlist Mycroft’s help to gain access to records of passengers and staff who had been on their flight.
Right. Right! There was dampness on his cheek, and he realized with horror that he had been crying.
Sherlock hummed his agreement. If it weren’t for the fact that he could tell John was holding onto words, that he wanted to say something else, Sherlock would have drifted off to sleep. But even as his fingers rubbed relaxing concentric circles over Sherlock’s Baxter nerve, Sherlock could sense that John wanted something. He quietly asked, “What is it, John?”
“What, exactly, should happen next?”
“Sh’lock.”
Rosie pulled back, letting John and Sherlock breathe. Stella was shyly holding back a giggle at the absurdity of her partner and her new family. “Really?”
There was a steaming cup of tea in front of him.
a bloody teenager. She had always felt guilty about her father never seriously dating. She thought, maybe, he hadn’t wanted to disrupt their small family, or replace her mother, or was too busy being a single dad to commit. But seeing Dad earlier, clinging to Sherlock like he was an illusion that could disappear any second, she realized she’d been wrong. Apparently, he’d always been in love with someone else. The realization was something of a comfort, actually.
. Lord Moran was facing life in prison, somewhere.
to think of himself that way. Sherlock, a father to his child- it’s a ludicrous fantasy he best not dwell on. He cocks his head and takes a step towards Mrs. Hudson. “Surely, you don’t mean-”
Feeling smug enough to let the conversation dissipate, Sherlock finished his tea and decided a Mandarin Chinese refresher in his Mind Palace would be useful for the upcoming trip.
She scanned the audience, only able to see the backs of heads aside from the bridespeople and the best man gathered up front around a delicate flower-covered arch. Jacqueline was ushering, seeing the late arrivals to their spots. There was no sign of a detective’s carefully styled curls, but she smiled when she caught sight of Aunt Harry’s frizzy mane hurrying to take a seat, arm draped across the back of a new girlfriend. Harry was a wildcard, but Rosie inwardly cheered that she’d made it; and just in time, apparently. Even sober, she was guaranteed to be the life of the reception.
Sherlock scrambles, nearly tripping over himself to get his pants off and into bed. When he does-
“Sorry,” Sherlock conceded, and he saw John’s eyes bulge in surprise at the utterance in the rearview mirror. “I should’ve made John do it- that’s more his area.”
Sherlock produced a condom wrapper from the nightstand. John raised his eyebrows.
This was absurd. Sherlock, married. He couldn’t have imagined being in this position only twenty-four hours earlier. But Mind Palace John was right; he did want this.

in critical condition. It’s only natural to be concerned.”
John tugged at the waist of Sherlock’s shirt. He was nearly panting. “Come on, upstairs.”
She liked to mess with them, a little.
“Please don’t lie, Daddy,” she’d pleaded. “I’m nine, and I think it’s important I know about my family.”
“Turn over.”
all in black today,” Sherlock leans over to smooth her curls.
He pulled away, taking Sherlock’s hand and leading him, surprisingly pliant, to the edge of the hall, through straggling guests and a maze of messy tables.
27. Severus of Potions class
He couldn’t see Sherlock’s face, but he knew he was smiling. John pulled out as carefully as he could, rushing to the loo to grab a flannel. He soaked it with hot water, and back in the bedroom, he took time to clean both himself and Sherlock, basking in its warmth.
keen made the entire situation hopelessly more pitiful.
John eyed at the difference in the scribbled numbers on the paper key holders they were each holding. “Two rooms?” John asked, and the undertone of disappointment Sherlock undoubtedly heard was like turning a knife in the wound.
“Watson?” he asked the question so quietly that it seemed more for his sake than for Rosie’s.
“He had far too many annoying habits to finish listing them by closing time,” he tried to joke, but truthfully, the question was so overwhelming, he wanted to bolt out of the restaurant and speed back to London.
Yasmin’s perfectly shaped brows shot up. “So does this confirm our long-standing Dr. Watson-Is-Bi theory?” Yasmin asked, referring to their lengthy discussions about Rosie’s father’s potential closetedness as two queer teens with nothing better on which to ruminate.
They set up on their beds, fired up their laptops, and with Mycroft’s access, began background checking individuals that were on their flight. After two hours of sorting through their personal information, two people seemed to be suspicious: the first was Edward Shih, a renowned artist known for once holding an exhibition of what he claimed to be Chinese artifacts from the Tang Dynasty that were actually all his own recreations. With the launching of a new exhibit on Imperial Porcelain tomorrow at the National Palace Museum, there could be a connection- he could have been the target. The second was indeed, Mr. Let Me Know If I Can Help You With Anything. Andy Wu, as he was also known, as a flight attendant with another Taiwan airline, had apparently been known to give far too many drinks to customers in whom he was interested. It wouldn’t be too great of a leap to think he may have shifted to using tea. However, Sherlock doubted that Andy would have gone to the serious lengths of knocking out Xiaowen on a very specific train to the top of Ali Mountain to steal the tea. It would have found its way into his hands another way.
Shockingly, Watson smiled fondly around a chip. He wished he could find it endearing. “Where did you go, just then? Was that your ‘mind palace’?”
“No,” said Sherlock flatly from behind the microscope.
Sherlock stopped mid-sip to look at him. “Hm?”
It wasn’t so much that John froze, but that his surroundings stopped their momentum in time. It was as if a foreign object had slipped through a wormhole, skewing John’s timeline, forcing the continuation of this dimension to hinge on the object’s very existence.
It seemed he couldn’t stop confessing.
“Stella’s alright, I take it?”
Sherlock breathes heavily into John’s neck and shifts his hands from John’s hair to his trousers, rubbing at his bulge. The touch is
“Go change into scrubs, John. You’ve got a patient to treat.”
“How happy I am,” John whispered, placing a steadying hand on the roof of the Vauxhall and leaning back to study him. John was beautiful like this: eyes lit only by the shine of the stars, hair deliciously mussed, bespoke suit a bit rumpled but still gently hugging his chest and hips, lips swollen into a small smile and thoroughly kissed. This was John, happy.
gave this to me.”
She followed her gaze. Dad was sitting at a table with all relatives of hers and Stella’s engaged in lively chatting, and Dad clearly wasn’t hearing a word of it. He was snickering at something on his mobile, and it didn’t take a consulting detective to deduce what he was smiling at. He

“I have a small wedding gift for you,” said Rosie, handing John the parcel. It felt sturdy, like a book under the wrapping.
“Yeah?” John added another finger, and placed a guiding palm on the small of Sherlock’s back. His skin was smooth, but John could feel the tightening and loosening of the muscles just underneath. The sensation was sending him into a sort of frenzy. “God, Sherlock,” he breathed, leaning down to place a kiss over the contracting back muscles.
“I could help you with that. Try to…distract you.” John palmed at the swell of Sherlock’s crotch, and his mind tripped, giving his body a distant lead.
John feels a surge of arousal from deep in his stomach, and that’s all it takes to increase the intensity between them. John places a pillow underneath Sherlock’s hips, and John reaches for the condoms and lube, but Sherlock stops him.
“Still married to your work, then?”
Upstairs.
John chuckled at this, so casually for a man holding a gun at the guard. “Makes sense, doesn’t it?”
“But I think it’s important that you know, there has never been a time in my life that has not been made better by you.”
“But I can tell you’re still exhausted, and so am I.”
John kissed him, and Sherlock reveled in the taste of sweat and tea and sex.
Rosie beamed. “I’ll play tonight. But I’m serious about guitar, Daddy.”
John was taken aback by the honesty of it. “Oh, uh, right, then.”
John’s hand said. He was starting to appreciate this unspoken language of sex- it was like an entire untapped form of communication and connection between him and John.
John stirred, and Sherlock’s fingers quickly slipped out of his shirt lest John come to consciousness.  He didn’t, but instead pressed his nose closer to Sherlock’s underarm, nuzzling it a bit. “Sh’lock,” he mumbled in the clouded quality of mid-dream speech.
“Goodnight,” he nodded, and the three friends stumbled as a single unit toward the lifts. It was rather sweet.

“You stomped around for months after I came back, lauding my fake death over me. But I came back. I was always going to come back. But you? You left me to rot. You
“Yes or no?” John’s eyes are wide and pleading, staring down at Sherlock from the armrest. Clara watches the proceedings with interest.
He’d put the kettle on as if he hadn’t seen anything. “Tea?” he had asked, so nonchalant as to be dismissive.
Sherlock turned to him with a brilliant smile he hadn’t seen in ages, and John nearly forgot what he had been asking about. “It was arsenic.”
? John’s jaw clenched as he involuntarily flexed his fingers. Old army habits die hard, and John valued clean efficiency in all things, including appearance. But when Rosie excitedly whirled around to show off the dash of pink in her blonde curls, John’s heart warmed. She loved it.
He nearly laughed upon stepping inside. Aside from the sheer amount of space, it transported Sherlock directly to John’s bedroom at 221B. He still had the same trunk in the corner, the same dim desk lamp on the nightstand, the same tedious and inefficient way his shoes were lined up in the closet. Similar smells, too: pine, musky deodorant, John’s lavender washing powder. There wasn’t much on the walls aside from a few pictures of him and Watson.
John glanced at the clock and turned to him, smiling. “Happy New Year.”
Our Sherlock marched right down the wedding aisle, and all heads turned to him as if he was the bloody bride. He stopped at the first row, where Jacqueline was standing off to the side. “Lestrade, arrest this woman,” he commanded, grabbing her forcefully by the shoulders. The scruffy man pulled out a pair of handcuffs. She heard several gasps from the audience, one of them her own.
Iris’s voice was far away. “I have to say, I’m surprised. You don’t love him?”
John didn’t need to drink the truth tea for Sherlock to know it was true. The sincerity radiated from him, and Sherlock had to wonder how he’d ever been unsure about the John Watson Question when now, it was so glaringly obvious. He melted into John, the words shifting his brain chemistry so that all he could think was
John stopped breathing. Sherlock wanted him in his life again. Sherlock wanted him, after everything. He stood, bridging the space between them, and dropped to his knees in front of Sherlock. John delicately placed his hands over Sherlock’s, where they rested on Sherlock’s knees. This close, John could smell Sherlock’s expensive lavender soap mixed with the lingering hint of tobacco. He wanted to drown in it.
John rushed to label the top of the crossword A-U, and the sides 1-21. He checked the first pair, I21: H. The second, D5: E. A2: L. The kettle boiled. He ignored it.
“I love you too, John.”
Sherlock leans back to stare incredulously at John. “God, no. We’ve had quite enough of that.”
The previously repressed wave of nostalgia came up with force. The return label. He knew it. It  was John’s address.
“I will if it means I can get my mouth on you sooner.” John was pressed so close, he could feel Sherlock’s voice rumble in his chest.
John chuckled. “He means well. That’s him trying to relate.”
Rosie woke to an insistent rapping on the door of Elaine and Yasmin’s hotel room. Both of them were still fast asleep, dead to the world after the chaos of the previous night. The thick curtains were blocking out any sunlight that dared to enter at-- 5:54am? She rubbed her eyes and checked her mobile again. Yep. 5:54. Yasmin’s arm was curled comfortingly around her waist, and Rosie had to resist the urge to fall right back to sleep.
He was taking her pulse, the sly bastard. It was racing, like a drum pounding out the rhythm,
And like that, they fell into a kiss.
The night moved like a chorus into a bridge, flowing from one beating dance floor to the next hypnotically. Rosie finally spotted Stella at their last stop of the night, their friends who had been separated all night coming together at last. Rosie made a beeline for Stella, but she could sense something was off even from across the dance floor.
“Good,” Sherlock breathed, only capable of one syllable words at the moment. He closed his eyes, tracking sensations as the ability to do so slowly came back to him. John’s fingers in his hair. John’s duvet underneath him. John’s hip pressed into his side, his leg thrown over Sherlock’s.
Rosie’s stomach dropped. It could’ve easily been her instead of Diana, yesterday. She clung tighter to Dad, who must’ve had the same thought, because he gave her a comforting squeeze.
He left out the part where he had woken up in John’s arms, having traversed the space between them during the expository pre-dawn hours.
Sherlock bites his lip like he’s trying hard not to say something. He strides confidently into the kitchen and puts the kettle on. “I’m making tea. Then I’m sending you to bed.” His voice is steady. John hates it.
And oh, it really, really was. “It’s been too long, Greg.” He gave the former D.I. a familial slap on the shoulder in greeting. It felt like old times.
) with his fingers.
“你們是美國人嗎 (Nǐmen shì měiguó rén ma)?” the hat-wearing cashier asked.
John stood. “She was poisoned?” He had suspected some sort of toxin had been involved. But arsenic? That was malicious, foul play. And antiquated. It was like he was in the middle of a bloody 20th century play.
John’s squirms settled. “I’ve missed you,” he whispered, and the raw emotion behind it scratched at his walls, but they didn’t let up. He needed to make John leave before he pinned him deeper into the table and spilled the fantasies on his tongue.
She didn’t miss a beat. “It was a pleasure, solving a real case with both of you.” She reached her arms out to give John a hug. He begrudgingly accepted, his arms stiffly hanging by Xiaowen’s waist.  “And you two should enjoy your last night here- it’s New Year’s Eve!”
The bastard rolled his eyes and tapped his foot like he was waiting to speak to a representative at a bloody insurance company. “Get her here
John threw his face into his hands and Xiaowen gaped. “I…”
It was manipulative and wrong but it felt so familiarly
at him.
He was on his knees in the hotel storage closet, searching for the arsenic supply. In the past, this was the kind of duty he’d give to John on a case, but now, he did his own grunt work. Unfortunately, with aging knees and a tiring heart, he assigned most physical field work to the homeless network these days. Although, it was hardly fair to call them that anymore. He’d come into some money after the death of Uncle Rudy, and he made it his mission to provide stable housing for all the members of his homeless network. It paid him back tenfold with their loyalty.

, Sherlock.” John realized he was speaking far too loudly for breakfast conversation. With effort, he lowered his voice to a forced whisper. “Did you know, then? That you- that I- that
“Our Sherlock,” Dad breathed incredulously, but something seemed to click. He said the words again, slower, like he was trying them on for size.
John narrows his eyes. “Nice of you to stop by on your walk of shame.”
that Rosie had questions about. Did he have a different life he wished he’d chosen?
“And then…” Sherlock swallowed. Was he getting nervous? “And then, I want to feel all of you, John. I want your cock in my hand, then my mouth.” John whimpered.
Elaine laughed, a sparkly sound that reminded Rosie of the rightness of her chosen profession. “Well, then. This ought to be an interesting wedding weekend.”
Dad closed his eyes and drew in a breath. “She was an assassin,” came out on the exhale. “She shot Sherlock. Nearly killed him.”
Rosie laid in the hotel room for a few minutes afterward, soaking in the significance of the weekend without Stella’s unbelievably potent distraction of a presence. The room was a large suite, with a jacuzzi spa, a balcony, and even a small kitchen attached. A painting of local scenic spot Castle Rushen hung next to a sizable television. It was perfect. Not too extravagant, but lovely for the two of them. Sweet, even.
“I’m sorry,” said Watson. Sherlock blinked, not expecting the apology. “For sending the invite like that. I found some of my dad’s old things, and I got ahead of myself. It was none of my business, doing that.”
Jacqueline instantly burst into a sob. “It was my husband, Alex,” she snorted through heavy tears. “Alex Mann.”
You can also use the clues and corresponding word counts, written below the image, to write down the answers.
“Puffinus puffinus,” Sherlock muttered, eyes still closed, voice low and rumbling. He turned into John, throwing an arm over his bare chest and nuzzling into his neck, inhaling deeply, his wedding band glinting in the sunlight. John shivered, willing himself not to squirm, with the way Sherlock’s breath was tickling his neck.
Sherlock closed his eyes, imagining exactly what he wanted to do to John. What he wanted John to do to him. “I want to taste you,” he said, willing his taste buds to manufacture a replica of the sweet mix of John’s sweat and semen. He reached for John’s pants, gasping at the feel of the hard swell there. He was salivating.
12:42pm
He nodded, and thankfully, she left the two of them, heels clacking away on the marble tiles.
Sherlock was astounded. John knew, even then, that a part of him had always wanted this for them. Before Watson. Before Mary. Before Paris. He’d let it go unsaid for so long. A note of sadness sung in the air, of regrets and time lost. Sherlock held out his left hand, and John knelt to place the ring on his finger. It fit perfectly.
22. Like one with a long coat and a short friend
12. Words before distance or disadvantage
John’s heart bursts. It’s the first time Rosie has ever said those words. They were so effortless. So simple and true. John can tell Sherlock is moved by it, too. He blinks a few times, looks back at John, smiling earnestly, and turns back to Rosie.
Was this the kind of behavior her dad had dealt with for years? She tried not to gape, standing in one of Elaine’s baggy pyjama t-shirts that went down to her knees across from a man in a designer suit. “Is everything alright?” she asked, worried for the welfare of a man who was knocking on hotel room doors before 6am. “My friends are kind of...asleep.” Like most normal people at this hour on a Saturday. “Could we go somewhere else? My room, perhaps?” She heard the annoyance creep into her voice.
“Hi, John,” the doctor greets, and pulls him aside to a more private corner. She has a naturally kind face, and in this situation, John finds it hateful. “I was told you spoke with Nurse Haverhill on the phone?” John nods. “So you’re aware Harriet experienced severe trauma to the head, as well as incurred broken ribs and a punctured lung in a car accident?”
19. Like Moriarty in Sherlock’s data
Right, yeah. ‘Puffinus,’ like puffin. “Sounds dirty.” His voice was rough with sleep.
you!” She walked briskly down the hallway to meet him, but once she was a few feet in front of him, she didn’t know what to do with herself. He certainly wasn’t putting out “hug me” energy, and waving felt obvious and trite. She held out her hand. “It’s lucky I ran into you- I think the hotel is having water issues, fair warning. Maybe it’s the pipes.”
“I’ll stay the night,” he conceded. Damn him for not being able to resist mysteries that tangentially involved John Watson. One night should be plenty of time to gather data. It had to be. “But I’ll be off in the morning.”
“She betrayed you and cheated on you. I hope you know you deserve better.”

He cried Sherlock’s name as he came.
Sherlock stifled a groan. “Illegal?” he pressed, propping his head up on one elbow. “How so?”
John shrunk in his seat like a chastised child.
Then John shocked him. He turned around, dropped to his knees on the tile, and licked the length of Sherlock’s cock.
It was ridiculous. Just a head. Just a shoulder.
John chuckles, rewarding him with a particularly hard squeeze. “Yeah? Where else do you want me to touch you, then?” He smirks, not expecting Sherlock to answer. But the detective is as keen as ever.
her, sure, but when it really came down to it, the only reason John had ever interacted with Molly was Sherlock. She knew that now.
“Ta,” John says, taking it with coffee.
John drops the pencil and leans against the moulding, breathing heavily. Rosie looks up at him, the way her nose scrunches reminding John so much of how his equally precocious sister used to look at him when she thought he was being ridiculous. “Buck up, Johnny!” Harry would tease.
He wasn’t following. “Need I remind you today is your wedding day? Secrecy isn’t really the point.”
The train tracks snaked closer and closer to Sacred Tree Station.

Sherlock climbed over the seat in one smooth motion and wrapped his arm comfortingly around Xiaowen’s waist. He urged her into the aisle, where the line to the door was getting longer. “Excuse us, my wife needs to go to the hospital,” Sherlock repeated to each new person in line in his best Mandarin, with his most sincere apologetic face. They let the fake pregnant couple by without question.
A lump formed in Sherlock’s throat. He couldn’t find a snarky response.
.  John got out of bed,  turned on the light, and found the slip of paper in his jacket. He reached for his glasses and a pen, grabbed the crossword, and decided he would sit at his kitchen table until he figured this out.
Sherlock kissed him, because John had deduced correctly, and because he could. “Yes,” Sherlock murmured against his lips. “Please.” They kept kissing, neither of them inclined to stop.
"Make your fingers soft and light
: words John Watson never thought he would use to describe Sherlock Holmes. He was wearing a dark green knit jumper with a hole in the sleeve- fancy Sherlock Holmes with a hole in his sleeve!- and a pair of faded jeans, cuffed to the ankle. His hair, once a full, dark brown, now had plenty of grey peeking through. His hair was longer than it had been the last time John had laid eyes on him, and it reminded John of their early days. His face had a few more wrinkles, sure, but to John, he looked younger than ever. Sherlock’s eyes crinkled with a smile at the sight of him.
Rosie had always been rather private about her unreleased music, ever a perfectionist about her work, so it was a rare occasion when she offered to play for him. For anyone. When she was growing up, it always took multiple pleas for a small preview. “Wow, that’s- yeah. Now?”
John opened his mouth, and shaped them around a single, cataclysmic word. “No.”
Xiaowen put on her horrid British accent again. “
“I do,” John admitted, and Sherlock’s suspicion was confirmed: she had given John the truth tea.
Sherlock glanced down the hall, and Rosie’s nerves spiked. What was going on? She really couldn’t take any more surprises after Stella’s poisoning scare last night nearly gave her a heart attack. “It’s rather urgent,” he insisted, shoving the latte at Rosie’s chest and gliding past her into the dark room. He pulled her into the loo and shut the door.
Clara scoffs. “Don’t think Harry’s that type of person. I’m not sure how much the Watson siblings actually have in common.” She fidgets with the ends of her scarf. Has Sherlock touched a nerve, there?
But the thought of his daughter marrying a woman who wasn’t who she said she was? It was a spooky sense of déjà vu. “Why? Do you think Stella was targeted specifically, or was it random?”
did he want?”
John wanted Sherlock to engulf him. To be engulfed by him, and Sherlock had no choice but to oblige. He wrapped his lips around the head of John’s cock, pulling him inside, and John cried out.
John now has no doubts that Clara still loved her, in the end.
Sherlock is affronted. “Please do me a favor, John, and never say those words in my presence again.” John musses his hair even further, calming him.
The weasel sighed. “If I recall you saying, ‘There should always be a spectre at the feast.’ You won’t deny the good Dr. Watson this. You already sent your RSVP.” He was dangerously close to mocking, and that would not stand.
“I assure you, I do.” Rosie babbled in her playpen, reminding John of exactly what he would be missing. He started to walk towards her, ready to leave and be finished with this conversation, but Sherlock stopped him. “Please, John. I need you. You know I need you,” his voice came out as a shout that faded to a whisper.
The likes of me abide
“I promise, it won’t harm you in any way,” Xiaowen assured, and Sherlock couldn’t help but believe her-
John sat down to watch, unsure if his unsteady legs would hold him through this performance. The soft acoustic picking started drifting through the room like a warm fire through an autumn breeze. Then, when Rosie started with the lyrics, the flames burned through his remaining composure.
John’s achingly hard. “Want to see you, though.” He turns Sherlock over so he’s laid out on his back, blissed out and prick standing rod straight.
Sherlock sniffed his cup of tea. “I can’t differentiate the smell, either.”
John bites back tears. He can’t get emotional before this whole memorial process even starts. “Come on, then, lovebirds, let’s go. Harry’s waiting.”
He needs to get himself together. Harry’s dead. He has responsibilities.
John feels the words rather than hears them. The last Jenga block is pulled, and he falls with a clatter.
“Dad,” she’d pushed. She needed to tell him. It felt big, important that he knew. “Look at me.” He stopped putting around the kitchen, took a breath, visibly steeled himself, and looked up, his expression annoyingly unreadable. It frustrated Rosie endlessly, the way Dad was so practiced at hiding his feelings. She wore her heart on her sleeve, revealed the entirety of herself with every note she played.
- Sherlock gasped as the outline of John’s hard cock grazed his inner thigh. He groaned with the need to touch John, catalogue him, make him do more of whatever he was currently doing with his mouth against Sherlock’s neck.
“But what? I want to give this to them. Watson made this happen, today. I owe her my heart, and Baker Street is the best physical representation of it I have to give.”
He felt his body responding to the weight of John atop him in a delightful way. He had sported an erection more than once in John’s presence, quite often because of him, but had always hidden it skillfully. Embarrassment was largely Sherlock’s association with any sort of bodily reaction, but today, he needed John to know just how much he affected him. He pressed his growing interest experimentally against John’s thigh, and both of them groaned into each other’s mouths.
“God, Sherlock, make a deduction. ‘Why waste a good wedding?’ I thought that bit was obvious.”
A different guard from the one who had tranquilized Sherlock held a gun to his head.
Sherlock looks between John and Clara and hesitates. “John, I don’t know if-”

Whatever news beckoned at 5:54 was never good, so she carefully extrapolated herself from Yasmin’s grasp and hurried towards the sound of insistent knocking.
The memory fueling his agitation, he turned back to Sherlock with a bite. “Why did you do all that?”
6 letters. TARMAC.
“Have you seen the Twitter video yet? Some arse at the funeral must’ve sold it to Daily Mail.”
John takes Rosie from her cot upstairs, changes her nappy, and dresses both of them. He prepares sliced bananas and small pieces of peanut butter toast for her breakfast. When she’s finished and fussing, John gives her the pop-up book she loves to play with, hoping it can buy them some uninterrupted time. He, Clara, and Sherlock sip on tea and munch on chocolate croissants.
in the bridal suite when she’d sung her song. She could probably count the number of times she’d seen Dad cry on one hand. It could have been that the stress of the last few days- preparing for the wedding, greeting family and old friends,
The two of them circled each other for the remainder of the proceedings, never quite letting the other out of earshot.
I’m really sorry, Johnny.
She was a smart girl, and she caught on. “It was my pleasure, Sherlock. Truly.”

“We’ll be in touch, Xiaowen. Thank you for your help.”
He seemed to come back to himself. “Right, yeah. Okay. Good. Fine. It’s all fine.” He squeezed his eyes shut, knowing it was the wrong response, and Rosie cringed. “I mean to say- I’m happy for you, Rose. I want you to love whoever makes you happy. I just- yeah. I want you to be happy.”
Sherlock was so direct, commanding and pleading simultaneously, the words were like an electrical fire in John’s synapses, shorting them out before consuming them.
62. Menu at un café
“Yes,” Sherlock breathes. “
John opened his mouth and closed it and opened it again. “I want you,” John said, his voice low. Sherlock nearly whined. “And,” he turned, so he could move the hand from Sherlock’s waist to his cheek. “I love you.
Clara properly scolds John for dipping out of the reception, but assures she won’t hold a grudge. She asks him how he’s holding up, and it’s hard to say- he’s over the moon about finally moving things forward with Sherlock, but his sister’s still dead, and his fingers still itch for a drink every time he thinks about it. He could be better.
“Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Dad, happy birthday to you!” Rosie sang, hoping Dad would hear her singing as she rang the doorbell to 221 Baker Street, holding a suitcase and a bottle of red with a ribbon wrapped round.
Sherlock took it, but looked away. He replied so softly it was almost a whisper. “How do you know?”
“That is the general idea, yes,” Sherlock drawled, and John reached a finger to the prostate to shut him up. Heat pooled in John’s belly at Sherlock’s reaction, his mouth open, eyes closed, body arched.
“I’m never going outside
Sherlock sat up slowly, mesmerized by Rosie’s decision process between playing with an unsolved Rubix cube and a cuddly bee.
Japanese hot pot (x2)
He stands and strides over to the doctor, whose face betrays nothing (as far as John can tell; Sherlock would probably disagree). “Hi, yeah, I’m John, Harry Watson’s brother. How is she?”
He heard the footsteps, but he needed
Now, he stroked John’s cock, eased by an expensive tea tree-scented body wash. John’s head was leaning back into his shoulder, having given into getting pleasured in this way.

They rode the rest of the way in silence.
Sherlock 12:10am
Stella’s eyes widened. Rosie reached for her, but Mrs. Liu held Stella back from Sherlock like his announcement was equivalent to attempted murder.
Xiaowen turned towards him with her eyebrows raised, and Sherlock was grateful John couldn’t see her expression. “There’s a huge fireworks display at Taipei 101 at midnight. You two could check that out.”
He only blinked.
John cleared his throat. “Not like that, no.”
Xiaowen took out her mobile, starting to dial her girlfriend. “I’m going to call her, sort this out. This is just a misunderstanding.”
Specks of dust sparkled in the soft beam of morning sunlight as John finally
The fire crackled in the silence between them.
John’s curiosity got the better of him, and he stepped out of the bar onto the marble tile of the lobby. His footsteps felt like reverberations through the entire building.
“Can I help? Dust off my crime-solving skills?”
Something like
High mountain tea.”
Stella’s mouth opened and closed. She was fighting with herself over the right thing to say. She clearly didn’t like Rosie’s plan, but it seemed like she wasn’t going to question it; Rosie couldn’t ever be stopped from doing what she wanted.
“H-Hello?” greeted the voice on the other end, a little shaky. Rosie nearly dropped the wine out of pure adrenaline. Sherlock’s voice was not shaky by nature.
what he was serving, and it wasn’t the tea,” John was getting heated about it, now.
Sherlock? Out of London? “Quiet life”? It seemed so wrong. Sherlock thrived on the bustle of the city. Sherlock was a painter, and London was his studio. Sherlock so deeply understood the city in a way John knew he never would. He tried to picture Sherlock living in the country- posh suit and styled hair dirtied by a garden, shined shoes muddied along a country path. John let out a low chuckle.
Might as well follow suit. “Wine. White,” Sherlock ordered for himself. He saw the flash of recognition in the flight attendant’s eyes and quietly hoped he wouldn’t say anything. It would only irk John further to remind him what they were to each other- an inseparable duo in the public eye (entirely
“They caught me just as I had changed it out. They walked in with a hot cup of water, and Iris steeped the imitation tea in it, thinking it was the real thing,” John explained, finally making eye contact.
The drive out to the countryside was beautiful. As they ascended into the mountains, sprawling tea farms and small villages colored the green, grey, and blue landscape of trees, mountains, and sky. The brightness of it was shocking compared to the greyness of London December- the saturation level had been dialed way up. A stark contrast of palm trees and maples lined the roads.
Rosie remembered. Lestrade was from Dad’s blog journal!
Stella leaned in, her still-raspy voice from the previous night more like a purr in Rosie’s ear. “We’re still going to be that into each other that much at their age, right?”
Sherlock hated seeing John like this, and needed to steer the conversation back to tea. “So you got bored and started experimenting.”
“屁眼 (Pìyǎn)!” Xiaowen scolded, smacking the back of Sherlock’s head with a clothing item of John’s repeatedly. He turned around to find it was John’s blue underpants. New ones. “I’ll be your pregnant wife in hell!”
A sigh of relief from Watson. “Goodnight, Sherlock. Sorry, they’re right. It’s been a long night. But. Thank you.”
Missed Call (3)
********
John looked pained for a moment, and Sherlock instantly regretted it. But John’s expression smoothed and he reached a hand out to wrap around Sherlock’s lower back and rest at his hip. It was grounding.
“You’re so good with her,” John says when he recovers from his laughing fit.
“Mm.” Sherlock keeps typing.
- my mind,” he choked out, finding speech more difficult with John’s lips pressed into the rather sensitive spot where his shoulder met his neck.
When he burst into John’s hand in a series of hot spurts, coating John’s hand and his own chest, John groaned and fell into Sherlock’s lips, licking inside desperately.
“Yes,” she beamed like a proud parent, “Guaranteed to make you tell the truth. Well, at least what you absolutely believe to be true at the present moment.”
Clara asks about the press coverage.
Rosie decided to take the group on a quick tour of the reception hall before heading up to their rooms. Stella had already seen it, of course, but with the late morning sun flooding into the giant windows, coating the wooden beams in a soft golden glow, the venue looked magical. She could picture the reception: the affair was going to be intimate, only about sixty guests made up of close friends and family, dancing to a live band of a few old friends from boarding school and Manx neighbors. The room was currently in a state of organized chaos, with floral arrangements and undressed chairs and tables grouped together in the corners. Rosie warmed at the unexpected sight of her dad, dressed in jeans and a green button-up, sitting on the floor in the corner, cutting ribbon for the centrepieces.
Mrs. Hudson sounds relieved. “Oh, dear. I’m sorry to wake you, but you’ve got a visitor.” A visitor? The only visitor that came round at this hour was Mycroft, and he wouldn’t have Mrs. Hudson call up. “Clara’s here. Said she rang with no response. Just wanted to make sure you’re alright after- after-”
A pause. Shuffling.
“Christ, don’t you?” John asks, rolling Sherlock’s trousers up so he can move his fingers to Sherlock’s calves. Irene’s (Moriarty’s?) “The Virgin” nickname flashes in his memory, but surely, things have changed since then?
No, this kiss was much, much better. It was a slow, soft promise of love, the healing pain of loss, the joy of redemption, a lick of intrigue for more to come. Sherlock kissed like he wanted John to picture what they’d missed out on in their long-winded separation: the curl of his fingers every song he’d composed, the pull on John’s lower lip every cigarette he’d ever had his mouth around. He kissed like he was making twenty years’ worth of memories. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s waist, pulling him close, digging his fingers into the man’s sides just to prove he was real. Sherlock let out a soft gasp, and his own arms reached around his shoulders in an embrace that assured he was.
“I know.”
Stella and her mom, Lisa, arrived at the hotel then, and John rubbed his face in an attempt to look like he hadn’t just worn out his entire body giving chest compressions to a dead woman.
John’s voice was heavy with sleep as he spoke, “Goodnight, Sherlock Watson Holmes.”
Sherlock grabbed tight onto John’s chest. “I’m so close, John.”
“Your dog. Redbeard. Redbeard was your
“This is where you’ve been experimenting with the tea,” Sherlock noted for confirmation. Xiaowen nodded, gesturing for the three of them to take a seat at two benches behind the house, facing the tea fields. Xiaowen and John sat on one, Sherlock on the other. From afar, the oolong tea plants looked like giant green caterpillars stacked on top of each other up the mountain, but it was rows and rows of 高山茶 (

to take this case, specifically. “I’ll take the case on one condition: John comes with me.”
It was a bit of a squeeze, but Sherlock, Stella, and Rosie sat down to eat at the table. But as soon as Dad went to serve, he stopped himself. “Be right back.”
In the memories we share
It was tricky business, though, conflating crafted memories with reality. Especially when they concerned John, who was already living in a corrupted world of muddled memories.

Mycroft sighed and turned toward the kitchen. His age was really starting to get the better of him, and he leaned heavily on his umbrella. “Must it always be this difficult with you?”

“Imagine the other way round. You never would’ve let me on the lease,” John laughed. “I’d just been sent home from the army. I’d made some rejected male advances in my time there, I knew how to play it off.”
He desperately hopes he hasn’t ruined everything. They’d come so far before John had to go and shout his love from a podium and basically try to fuck Sherlock like a horny teenager (he certainly came like one).

“Come on, then.” John nudged his nose against his cheek. Sherlock refused to turn. “What about this proposal? Are you going to ruin this one, too?” he teased with a massaging of Sherlock’s ring finger, and the question was like a record scratch.
“Why are you here, Sherlock?” After the initial shock of seeing Sherlock dissipated, John obsessively started formulating theories. Did he receive a tip that a woman would be killed? Unlikely. Was he here for a different client? Possible, but improbable. Did he figure he’d pop by for a visit, deciding he missed John? Most definitely not. The most likely theory was also the most obvious: he heard about the wedding and couldn’t help snooping. John just needed to hear him say it.
John smiles. “Sounds like my type.”
Sherlock had already moved down to John’s neck, and the sensation of those lips nipping and licking that sensitive skin was extremely distracting. “Mm?” Sherlock started to rub at John’s nipples over his undershirt, and it became even harder to maintain a train of thought. But John wasn’t going to let this go.
Sherlock’s phone buzzed. Mycroft.
Sherlock would not give him the satisfaction, especially not after his brother so rudely interrupted his afternoon sulk. “I’m not going.”
“I was hoping you might have some background information.” Sherlock’s voice chilled his anger a bit, but only exacerbated his other urges.
“Sit,” John ordered, motioning the gun to the ground and back up to the guard, who silently followed. He was used to taking orders.

“Attention Watson wedding guests,” Sherlock spoke into the microphone, unwelcome feedback bouncing off the speakers at the shift in volume. There were confused murmurs coming from the small crowd. The group of uninvited spectators on the side had whipped out their mobiles to capture the spectacle, showering the crowd with flashes. “There is a murderer among us.”
Harry raised an eyebrow at him. “The most unexpected part about this whole thing is that it’s twenty-five years late, love. This was always going to happen; I’ve been saying it to Johnny since he met your sweet, arrogant arse. It was all the separations and returns, the questioning,” she waved a hand around dramatically, “and the marrying other people parts that only delayed the inevitable.”
She always knew that Dad wasn’t the best with people, but the two of them understood each other. Trusted each other. Did Dad not trust her enough to make her own judgments about who she was marrying?
Ah. “When you were dead.” He concentrates on keeping his movements steady on Sherlock’s legs, pushing into the muscly flesh with his thumbs. He thinks of Harry, faking it as some macabre joke. It pains him. “Why? Why just once?”
Our last summer
The ache was quickly replaced by an odd sense of grief over missing out on the key years of Watson’s life. Sherlock had thought he would be a parent-of-sorts to her, once. Now, he barely knew a thing about her (aside from the occasional, detestable update from Mycroft and Sherlock’s own light surveillance).
She pulled Elaine into her circle of light, and the two of them shout-sang Rosie’s newest single to each other. “See that girl, watch that scene, digging the dancing queen!”

About an hour and a half outside of the city, the driver interrupted John’s chain of thought. “Dr. Watson, you’ve arrived.” John could feel the car on the gravel drive before he stepped out onto it, and it felt comfortable and familiar beneath his feet. Earl leaped out of the car and started yipping excitedly, exploring the newfound space. The rain was lighter here, but still drizzling. He was struck with an odd wave of nostalgia and awe at the two-story blue cottage that stood 10 meters in front of him. An elaborate garden lined the front of the house. Even with grey skies and the days reaching late into September, the flowers looked impossibly bright.
? Is that seriously M’s name?”
“‘eel so good, John...you can do it harder,” Sherlock bit his lip, and John couldn’t hold back. With one, two, three thrusts he could already feel himself getting close. He had waited years for this, and he couldn’t hold out any longer.
“Shut
He steeled himself, gave the microphone back to Sherlock, and took Rosie’s hand that wasn’t tied up with Stella’s. The audience was looking around at each other as if they’d watched an entire series just to be stripped of the finale, unable to hear the next words without the microphone. Rosie didn’t care. The only people she cared to see were Stella and Dad. “Your mother did some very bad things,” Dad started, and Rosie was sent back in time to when she was nine years old, asking questions about Mom.

Sherlock mouthed as John’s ear as he softly stroked John to completion for a second time. John came with a low groan, this time in small, separate spurts. Sherlock was uncomfortably hard and completely untouched.

He rolled his eyes. Such a ridiculous man. He said it anyway. “I love you.”

of walking away.”
“I’m not nine anymore, Dad. You can be honest with me.” She squeezed his hand in encouragement. Stella squeezed hers in support.
Openly declare (at John and Mary’s wedding)
12:50pm
Sherlock wasn’t sure if it was the false confidence of the imitation tea, or the excitement of being so few words away from solving the John Watson Question, or the mere impatience after years of wanting, but he stood, coming into the space between John’s legs, resting his hands atop John’s well-worn jeans on his thighs. And when John looked up to meet his gaze, he finally,

“You should go with him, Dad.”
John’s fingers are practically burning holes in Sherlock’s hips with how hard he’s pressing into them. The sight of him, flushed and sweaty, bouncing up and down on the pillow is nearly enough to send John over the edge. Not yet, though. “Come for me,” John pants. “Come all over yourself with me inside you.”
John scrambles out of Sherlock’s lap and rushes to her. Her deep brown eyes are glistening with emotion: grief, jealousy, anger, sadness. He pulls her into a hug, and she slumps against him. Both of them know, now, what it’s like to lose Harry Watson. It’s heartbreaking, and tragic, and Not Okay, but they see each other’s pain. The solidarity of it is comforting, only just.
It wasn’t like the desperate, hungry, rushed kisses they’d shared during their tryst ten years ago, the ones that had dug holes into the recesses of John’s mind with how often he’d thought about them on lonely nights.
“I hope Rosie didn’t inherit my knack for cocking things up with the one person that matters,” he said with a sigh, returning his hand to the spot on Sherlock’s thigh.
too good at this.
John did this to him. He’s done it before, too. God, he doesn’t want to do it again.

And then Sherlock opened the door in a sleep shirt, a silk dressing gown, and pyjama bottoms on backwards with the tag sticking out. His hair was a complete mess, going up in every direction. He looked- Rosie gulped- thoroughly shagged. That would explain the strangeness of the phone call and the lurch in her stomach.
“What’s so bad about orchestra, Rose? I thought you liked it. You have that big solo tonight!” John tried his hardest to be encouraging, though he could hear the edge in it. He wasn’t about to let his daughter quit right before the show without an explanation.
John took his turn with the tea towel and discarded it in the sink, reaching again for Sherlock’s lips.
“Changed my mind. Want you now.” John slumped against the wall in acceptance as Sherlock kneeled in front of him, working on undoing John’s belt.
“Hi. Call me John,” John said, reaching to shake Xiaowen’s hand.
His partner stilled. John started to panic for a brief moment, worried he’d gone and said the wrong thing like an idiot. He pulled away, beginning to apologize (Sherlock was no kept man, after all), but instead, he was met with darkened eyes and an intent gaze.

Sherlock nodded. “We didn’t get that far last time,” he said, the image flashing in his mind of his cum- and tea-stained black Armani shirt, and John’s fingers faltered on the first button. Should he not have brought up their last sexual encounter? He didn’t see why not; John
Sherlock stuttered. “I…” His fingers felt frozen, and he absently calculated the odds that full motor function would return after hearing John say he loved him. “John, I…”
The surgery was utterly unbearable the next day.
“No! No.” There must have been something in John’s tone that made Sherlock know not to continue, because he tightened his lips and nodded. “The last few years have been-- difficult. And at first, I blamed it on Mary, on the baby, on you, on the drugs. I thought that if you were out of my life, all of my problems would disappear. It should have been obvious, but it took years- years, Sherlock- to realize that I drove you away, and I
) lapping at his exposed nipple, Sherlock would call himself from half a day ago a complete and utter idiot.
“It will come as no shock to you that I was taken aback by your speech yesterday,” Sherlock starts, still staring out the window, avoiding eye contact.
“That was brilliant. Heartbreaking, but absolutely brilliant.” He wiped at his embarrassingly damp eyes with the heels of his palms. “Thank you.”

“You did.”
I promise. I want to be married to you as soon as possible,” Stella assured with a raspier voice than usual, squeezing Rosie’s fingers.
When he emerged from the bathroom in pyjama bottoms and a soft cotton t-shirt,  John was gathering his own toiletries from his suitcase. Sherlock was grateful for John’s distraction- he didn’t want to look him in the eyes after his furtive bathroom proceedings.

Sherlock considered. He pulled on John’s hips, pulling them even closer to his own. John could feel Sherlock’s hardness under his jeans. “Fuck me.”
John closed his eyes, and let Rosie’s clear soprano wash over him. By the end of the song, his cheeks were stained wet.
Watching Sherlock succumb to sleep with his own fingers smoothing his curls, John decides, no, he truly doesn’t mind. He doesn’t mind at all.
In the early days at 221B (before the Fall), Sherlock had listened with interest (that he knew now was more than scientific) to John getting himself off. The shower was a common John wank locale, where Sherlock could discreetly lurk by the door and categorize John’s sounds and deduce his stroke speed.
“That’s it, Sherlock, come for me. Please,” he encouraged, sinking deeper to hit that
12:51pm
It was John’s turn to wince. “Don’t apologize, Sherlock. This was good. Bloody brilliant, actually.”
Somewhere in the push and pull of lips and teeth and tongues, John managed to shimmy Sherlock out of his trousers. John led them to the edge of the bed, and maneuvered Sherlock onto it, climbing over him. John’s sheets engulfed him in his smell. It was heavenly. This was all more intense with the lack of clothing, even with their pants still clinging on. There was a huge amount of sensory data input of skin on skin, of tiny hairs and bumps and bones.
Greg sighed. “She’s not exactly your biggest fan, mate. You know. Her and Sherlock talk...” the man looked deeply uncomfortable, finishing the sentence with a noncommittal wave.
“They’re not after Edward, then,” John stated, pouring a cup of tea for himself in one of the intricately designed paper cups. Sherlock smelled the robust simplicity of the tea, and could recognize it anywhere as regular black tea. John confirmed this with a sip.
John sets the cup beside him on the counter, not breaking eye contact. There’s an intensity between them that’s raw, and deliciously anticipatory. John places his hands on Sherlock’s hips and squeezes.
, in a minute, it was going to be downright indecent to be in such a state in public.
“John, what’s wrong?” Sherlock asked, a little too forcefully.
Rosie looked up from her fingers on the grand piano to lock eyes with Sherlock

John had leaned in for what was supposed to be a quick kiss in the hotel car park, but it had rapidly devolved into a full-on snogging, so by the time they sauntered into the Crown’s reserved dining room arm in arm for the wedding brunch, he and Sherlock looked guilty of more than just tardiness. The crowd was a motley assortment of impatiently hungry and hungover wedding guests- a few of Rosie’s friends John barely knew the names of were still stumbling. Nonetheless, they were greeted with polite applause and one wolf whistle- he shot a dirty look at Harry for that one. Rosie wore a smirk, shaking her head and sharing a knowing glance with Stella and her bridesmaids.
Xiaowen scratched her head. “John, with all due respect, I really don’t think you did. The flavors of oolong are deeply complex, and could easily be mistaken for another kind of high mountain tea.”
“For my mum, it’s all about the not-having-kids thing. She’ll come around,” Stella had told Rosie, when they started becoming a serious couple. And she had- Mrs. Liu was not quite at the point where she was welcoming Rosie into the family with open arms, but she accepted their relationship, and for that, Rosie was grateful.
John swallowed. “Right.”
He spares a glance at Sherlock, who’s all but saying “

Sherlock bitterly thought that if she just slipped the girlfriend some truth tea in one of the gaudy imperial porcelain knock-off paper cups, years of partnership would be over remarkably quickly.

Sherlock returned to the Crown Hotel with Watson a little over an hour later. He could tell, instantly, that something was wrong. The hotel staff in the lobby were ill at ease.
At that, John had to keep his knees from buckling and voice from cracking. “God, yes, but if you keep talking like that, it’s going to be over a lot quicker.”

. John grunted, thrusting into Sherlock’s fist, spilling over Sherlock’s black Armani shirt. If he had the ability to form thoughts, he might have considered this to be the most beautiful John had ever looked. Sherlock kissed him. John languidly kissed back.
She looked at him like he was a fascinating foreign species- not dissimilar to the way John had looked at him after he spouted deductions at their first meeting. Her phone vibrated on the table. She ignored it. Not Stella, then. Was it John? He wished she would answer it. He had a rather discomposing desire to listen to how the two of them interacted. “Tell me about him,” she implored. “You and Dad. A case, how you met, an annoying habit of his—anything.”

Xiaowen had unexpectedly come to meet the two of them at the MRT station where they would take a train to the airport.
She was convinced she had pulled every piece from Dad that he was willing to give, until this morning.
She’s sitting in Sherlock’s chair, biting into a pastry, wearing the same black dress she wore to the funeral yesterday. She gives him a cheeky wave. “Nice of you to join me,” she greets, leaning over dramatically to get a glimpse into Sherlock’s room. “
John finally turned to look directly at him, a softness there that hadn’t been there moments earlier.
Thankfully, Watson and two of her friends burst through the hotel doors to interrupt, and Connor shoved the sign away, standing straight. Watson and her bridesmaids walked with a gait unsteadied by alcohol, but the weary expressions on their faces looked dead sober. The night had taken a toll on their appearance, with questionable stains on their clothing and stray pieces of frizzy hair circling their heads. The wind had picked up after sundown, and Watson looked like she could catch a chill at any moment with the tiny dress she was wearing. A tacky “bride” crown sat askew atop her curls.
“Sherlock?” John’s voice was thick with worry. Bugger, this was not how this was supposed to go.
John chuckles, pulling out and padding to the loo to dispose of the condom. He wets a flannel with warm water for Sherlock. Once they’re clean, John wraps his arms around Sherlock from behind and kisses his shoulder. They settle into comfortable silence. John tries to make his mind go blissfully blank; his body is sated and calm, but in the back of his mind, there’s still the one nagging thought, a constant low thrumming for the past week: Harry’s dead. He feels safe and so
The smooth lighting in the restaurant made everyone in attendance look a little more beautiful, and Rosie could not take her eyes off Stella. She was wearing long, intricate earrings with a colorful pattern that accentuated her neck, partially hidden by the tight high-necked black dress she was wearing. In Rosie’s pleasantly buzzed state, she found the whole ensemble to be quite distracting.

John leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms, taking the information in. Sherlock’s eyes widened.
John filled the bowl, placed it in front of Earl, and sat down in the loveseat as she ate. Sherlock soon brought out the tea and sat across from him in the matching chair. It felt so strangely like old times. The last time John had sat across from Sherlock like this, he was monitoring Sherlock so he wouldn’t start using again. Now, John was the one who was shaking and feverish, as if he were the one with withdrawal.
John had found Sherlock in a losing argument with the staff at Noble’s Hospital over access to the lab. Luckily for him, however, John was friendly with the head of hospital; in fact, Dr. Burke owed him a favor. The hospital was dreadfully short-staffed, and Burke continually pleaded with John to pick up volunteer shifts in the emergency department every so often. With John vouching for him, Burke coalesced to Sherlock’s demand to use the lab with a warning that he would be paying for any broken or misused equipment. John made sure to cut Sherlock off before he could make a snide comment about the “misused” part of the sentence.

“Drink,” Iris commanded. It was a threat, and the word heated the low simmer of hatred for this woman into a raging boil.
“It’s lovely, Sherlock. Thank you,” she said, taking the flower in her hands, “But why are you concerned about Stella’s family history? Is there something I should know?”
Sherlock echoed the sound, lifting his arse and flexing. “Then do it,” he said, ever an impatient mind-reader.
He discarded the dirty flannel on the floor, and his husband burst into low, steady laughter.
“I’m so happy you’re back, Rose,” Stella panted once she fully made her way over. She and Watson hugged. With Stella being linked to a known bomber, Sherlock had to stop himself from physically recoiling when he saw the embrace.
