“The picture had something on it, it's on my fingers.” Sherlock said with a disgusted face rubbing his fingers together before lifting them to his mouth. John quickly grabs Sherlocks wrist, stopping him from tasting the strange substance.
He made his way down the stairs and back to his room, it was early afternoon the sky slowly turning pink and orange then darkening high up. Sherlock had always loved astronomy, his earliest memories were of his mother taking him and Mycroft on the balcony outside his parents bedroom -which they were never aloud in- and teaching them the names of the stars. She actually named stars after them not just randomly picking one like normal people no she actually bought them each a star, it was brilliantly thrilling to Sherlock to be apart of constellations.
Molly crosses her arms over her chest, assesses him a moment before making a sort of ‘ah hah’ noise feeling very pleased with herself.
Greg held up his hands. "I'm just here to make sure you guys are safe don't worry about me." He said before getting into the driver's seat.
It was when he slept, he got younger. Sherlock should’ve noticed before then but he was just so confused by the whole situation he wasn’t thinking clearly. He cursed himself quietly for not seeing it sooner and held John to his chest trying to sooth him.
“Ah you finally see. Now what’s it for?” James asks rhetorically practically twirling, a dance of his own excitement. Trotting over to the main computer and powering it on, that corner of the room momentarily basked in light.
“This doesn’t make sense.” John said confused looking down the line of photos. “Why are these here? Why Sebastian? Why..” He sighed looking to Sherlock as he heard papers crunching. “What are you doing?”
Sherlock sat on the ground in front of his door and popped open the pens. He pulled out the ink cartridges and used them to pop the lock. He sat for a few moments fiddling with the lock till it opened with an audible click.
“And why’s that, dear?” Sherlock pondered this for a moment he knew why but it was a bit odd to say I’m happy because someone else is happy.
He walked in and she turned immediately from her desk (Where she was reading a magazine on how to lose weight without working out. Completely wrong, all of it.) to see his ridiculous smile. She grinned cheekily and put her arms in the back of her chair watching him slink into the room.
Or what if John thinks he is faking nice around him just for the case? John has already shown concern that Sherlock will leave home after the thrill wears off and he can’t promise that he won’t. The feeling of uncertainty is terrifying and he wants to reassure John but he can’t. He feels like he wants to stay like he wants to be with John. Amazing John. Who has gone through so much but can still smile, laugh and be genuinely happy. Who makes Sherlock happy and want to be all sappy feelings and give hugs and cuddle for goodness sake.
“Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes. I’m a consulting detective at Scotland Yard.” The man- Sherlock - said with a carefully blank expression, though somehow John could tell he was sad. John nods to himself as he thinks for a moment.
The city's power went out within a few moments of him sending the text and a silence followed that London hadn’t experienced in a very long time. The car buzzed around him and he pushed the gas in response. It was only early morning the sun had yet to rise, he was alone on the streets and the further he drove the less vehicles he encountered.
“Probably not but I don’t care.” Sherlock replies offhandedly as the people around him stand up straighter in Mycroft's presence. Sherlock makes an effort to slouch.
The car rolled to a stop outside a building in pieces, broken apart by the years that it had stood empty. The second story too the worse of it all though the bottom seemed to be intact. Overgrown weeds and rubbish littering the grounds around it. Metal fencing around the entire place, warning signs attached to every side.
John carefully pushed himself up off the ground and on shaky legs moved to a crouching position. He looked around the room carefully trying to find the fastest way out ignoring the pounding of his heart.
“I was wrong.” He snorted at that, even through the phone Sherlock could tell he was rolling his eyes with bitter laughter.
When there was nothing left for them to for them to do a silent conversation passed between their eyes. Sherlock took hold of John’s hand gently and together they went downstairs. Something neither of them expected awaited on the sidewalk.
That is until they see that they are hurt. Seeing that they are in fact the one with the wound, bleeding out and falling apart in front of their own eyes.
John reached his hand outstretched behind him as he walked further into the city sidewalks slowly becoming more busy. John smiled to himself as he felt Sherlocks fingers intertwined with his own. John pulled him forward so they could walk side by side and leaned into his side.
The room was empty he figured out after making his way around the edges only to find one single chair in the middle. The doors locked and he had no way out.
“To an almost perfect present?” Sherlock asked with a raised eyebrow as he poured a small amount of whiskey into each of the glasses for a toast.
"Should we make it official?" John asked as his hand hovered over the enter button. As confirmation Sherlock placed his own over Johns and hit enter they kissed again as they looked at the screen. Soon enough people would be blowing up his inbox asking hundreds of questions but for now it was peaceful and they were together.
"Oh, he's been talking about it for weeks you know. All nervous about what he should cook he practiced downstairs in my kitchen. First time you should've seen it smoke everywhere black char in my new pans. It was dreadful." She prattled on about how she couldn't get the smell out for weeks.
After a few minutes of silence Sherlock sighed and rubbed his hands over his face, scrubbing at his eyes.
He’d chosen the wrong room and now he could only hope that Sherlock found John and they would be okay.
"Absolutely." They both giggled like school girls about it for awhile. It was extremely childish but neither could find it in them to care too high on happiness.
He was woken by the sound of something hitting the floor without even opening his eye Sherlock could tell it was a metal platter hitting the linoleum. Sherlock shifted slightly hearing the door open and close softly he opened his eyes slightly to make out Johns blurry figure walking away. Figuring he'd check the noise then be back Sherlock readjusted himself then tried to go back to sleep.
Meanwhile Sherlock was suffering, watching from the sidelines as John went around dating anything that breathed. He could practically feel his life force slowly being sucked away with every new person John brought back to his room.
“Setting up a surprise for you.” James said with a grin before he disappeared behind the computer screen again.
"Reckless and stupid is what it was." Sherlock said putantly with a small smile forming. He stopped quickly so he wouldn't run into John and tried to conceal his smile.
John moved immediately to get into the car not having a problem with this arrangement in the least. Sherlock on the other hand didn't budge not letting go of John's hand therefore not allowing him to get in the car.
John chuckled softly and went to scrape off what he had burned and try another attempt at cooking. Sherlock made everything better and he felt more at peace with himself knowing that he would always be right beside him.
An hour or two later Sherlock was back in his room yelling at Mycroft through his phone receiver trying to get answers on his progress. He was also trying to get him to come earlier than that night, or at least he was until he heard a sharp cry from the living room.
“I love you too, I love you....” Sherlock whispered into the linoleum his voice cracking and breaking off. Tears roll down his cheeks, the pain of not being able to tell John that was worse, that’s what would kill him.
On some level he wasn’t sure that he wanted to but since the beginning he knew he had to pay more attention to this thing to understand it. He had made the mistake of being so thrown off guard that he forgot what this whole thing was really about. It was about the war between the two men, a fight of intellect that Greg had no part in fighting. He should have been more aware but when John went down, he forgot about the pips.
Sherlock watches John sleeping peacefully on the couch, bundled up in a thick blanket and a very large jumper that practically drowned the small boy inside of it. He still couldn’t believe it, he felt like he was going to wake up and John would be by his side in their bed just like every morning before.
“I’ll take that as Sherlock for ‘yes, your right.’” They continued to watch on. “I bet you he’s gay.”
John lay awake the feeling of unease in the pit of his stomach keeping him up. He was so restless he decided to get up and try drawing to help him fall asleep. He slipped from Sherlocks light grasp and walked quietly to his desk in the corner. He lit a small candle he had set up, liking the firelight much more than artificial lamp lightning.
The sound of thunder on the stormiest day couldn’t compare to the sound of -what must have been- a thousand knives hitting the floor. Defeating anyone who dared to listen to the horrific screech of metal falling all around. Knives scratching the ground varying in size but all falling the same. Three of them hitting Sherlock.
"I need to go out." Sherlock said grabbing his coat he wasn't actually dressed properly but he didn't seem to care. John couldn't find it in him to reprimand him, he was far too happy.
Even though he was trying to hold in his smile to at least keep some of his pride as John leaned back and smiled at him he couldn't help but smile back. Lestrade was looking at him with a look that screamed 'Self proclaimed sociopath my ass.' Sherlock just ignored him though he knew he was right. After the smiles faded and the silence sets in (except for some TV noise)John spoke up.
“Just you and me.” Sherlock says raspy and tight, the tears flowing so freely he couldn’t even contain it anymore. Tornadoes and storms tearing everything apart around him, the wind was so loud no one would hear his sobs. “Against the rest of the world.”
“Successful?” Sherlock asks swinging his legs off the couch and standing swiftly his eyes already trained on the doorway that led to John.
It fell open under his weight and he hit the ground, looking up, recovering as quickly as possible although he found nothing but an empty room. It couldn’t possibly be. It was the only room left he had gone through them all, every one and nothing.
"Aren't you supposed to kneel?" John asked smiling like an idiot as he stared into the eyes and the man he loved.
“I’m not sad. See?” Sherlock said and in a truly pathetic attempt to keep Johns attitude cheerful he tries to smile past it all. Even with his many years of experience in acting through cases and family events he still couldn’t seem to put on a convincing smile for John. When it really mattered, he couldn’t seem do it.
“Really?” Sherlock asks looking over at him curiously. He had just figured he wanted sex or something.
“Making breakfast!” The smaller of the two pronounced with a bright smile. He knew well enough that Sherlock needed a distraction, that food was a good thing for everyone and he was hungry himself.
They drove for what seems like ages during which they explain everything they've figured out so far to Greg. Lapsing into silence after there's nothing left to say the only sound the hum of the engine and tires against the pavement.
"You're going to poke me with that thing aren't you?" John says disliking the idea but putting his arm out to Sherlock.
“Okay.” John said happily as she took off the helmet before doing a double take and looking at Sherlock unsure. “O-Only if you want to of course. I wouldn’t want you to if-”
“Oh shoot, you’re right. I had completely forgotten.” John says worriedly stilling what he was doing and running his fingers through his hair. “She’s going to flip.”
“Are you going to introduce yourself?” Molly asked excitedly leaning on her clasped hands. They were sat at a cafeteria table lucky enough to have the same lunch period as John. (Sherlock was practically giddy at being able to call him that even just in his head.)
“Sit up.” The women said and Shelrock obliged hiding a wince when it pulled uncomfortably at his stomach and throat. She was trying to determine if there were any side effects but Sherlock already assessed himself and he didn’t have any.
“Always, John. Always.” John heard him answer from across the room before the sound of a door closing. What he didn’t see was the growing shine to the man’s eyes
This time Sherlock appeared inside the flat, sitting in his chair long caked with dust yet not disturbing a particle of it. His ankle sat over his knee and he stared unwavering into the void of the dark kitchen, his eyes were always vacant and black. Sherlocks irises were always changing color and vibrancy with his moods and expressions, twisting shades almost constantly. It only made sense that this mere photocopy of the man had no such color, he was printed black and white from his skin to his shoes. There wasn’t a spark to be found.
"Why aren't you talking?" He asks simply just wanting to know at this point. John just shrugs again and went back to his fingernails. Sherlock sighs to himself, annoyed and moved to sit beside John.
Sherlock reaches over taking John’s hand in his own and tracing the lines on it idly. John moves over a bit to lean on Sherlock’s shoulder watching Sherlocks hands move on his own.
He stood up with a determined nod to himself and took both of Greg’s hands starting to pull. Dragging him as fast as he could out of the room. He couldn’t go very far, he wasn’t strong, he could hardly pull him at all.
“Call Mycroft to hold them there.” With that Sherlock hung up and dropped his phone on the table before falling onto the sofa.
“No, he wouldn’t be. I can protect him just as well as you without the poking and prodding of your laboratory dogs.” Sherlock says firmly looking up to Mycroft in the eye. “He needs me as I need him, so leave us be.”
“I’m doing just fine on my own, you don’t need to be here.” Sherlock said and he couldn’t help but smooth the harsh edge in his tone. It wasn’t John but it was and he couldn’t be harsh to John, he found it so hard still to this day to let him go.
“Sherlock I can’t believe you! I finally meet someone and you scare her away!” John yells angrily. “Why? Why the hell do you feel the need to do this?”
So he hauled himself up out of bed and made his way to the chair in the corner where Lestrade as left most of his stuff. Digging through it he found the box and slapped one on his arm. The relief was instant as always but he was itching for another.
Turning to John slowly Sherlock looked him in the eye. He wanted desperately to tell him everything he was thinking right then. How when he looked at him his stomach twisted into knots and when he thought about him he got this ridiculous grin on his face. How no matter how much time he spent with him and even when he’s right next door, when he couldn’t see John he felt like ripping his hair out. How he was hopelessly in love with him and couldn’t do a damn thing about it.
Maybe he was. It didn’t matter at that moment to him, he just wanted to find Sherlock. Have some hope that he was okay and breathing, that he could find that visual and physical assurance that he was okay.
Sherlock leaned back from the door as the lock was undone and it opened. John stood there wearing jeans and T-shirt like he always does with uncharacteristic sorrow written upon his face.
"Because I care about you and don't want you to worry over it." Sherlock explains digging through his supplies before coming up with a syringe.
“No, no. Not that, the other one.” Sherlock amends quickly and John nodded understanding very relieved of the fact.
“Yes and you’ll suffer through it here. You forget you still have to recover yourself, little brother.”
The elevator doors opened traveling the great city in all its glory. London really was a marvelous place at night.
“I suppose he can. Doesn’t mean I have to like it.” John said much less complaining and accepting Mycroft could help Sherlock a bit more then they could. They sat for a while in silence both thinking of what is to come. “How did he save your life?” John asked quieter more subdued than before, sometime later. Greg just sighed.
We looked all over the town- -the state for Christ sake- - Dad even filed a police report but they found nothing. Then a week later a large sum of money was pulled from her and my Dad's bank account, more than half was taken out. We weren't wealthy by any means, practically living in the dumps so when that happened we weren't left with much." John said solemnly.
“Stop thinking about your fantasies brother. His safety is more important than your compulsive need to control everything. Caring is not an advantage but a weakness, keeping him here will only prove that. Let me transfer him to a safe facility to find a cure and when that is done I will return him to you.” Mycroft says trying to convince him but getting no response he continues. “You may work on the cure as you please but with James Moriarty still at large I cannot guarantee his safety as you’d like. Believe me, this is for the best.”
John had to shake himself from his own thoughts needing to focus on Sherlock and keeping him from bleeding out. He quickly took off his jacket, first aid training kicking in as he wraps it up and ties it around Sherlocks bicep as a tourniquet. He removes his over shirt as well, pressing it to his back needing to keep the bleeding down. He had to stay calm and keep a level head if he ever wanted to get out of this with Sherlock alive.
“From what I remember, and I remember that one well, trust me. It started as a call, just some domestic violence the neighbors heard shouting and called, it was a poor area the house was a trailer in a trailer park, and I was the closest so I called in first. This was six years ago but I still remember it like it was yesterday.” He stopped for a moment to take a shuddering breath, Sherlock waited frozen. “I could hear the yelling from outside as I got out of the car, it was just me as my partner was away on her maternity leave, anyway. When I tried to open the door it was locked so I knocked, everything went eerily silent, it was creepy to hear screams go immediately quite. The door opened to an older man fifty’s or older I’d say, I asked him if I could come in, he asked why and I said cause the neighbors called and he shut the door on me. The yelling started again and I could hear a kid screaming for help but I couldn’t get in, I called for backup the fire department got there first and broke open the door. They helped restrain the man as I looked for the kid,-“ he paused again seeming to choke on his words, Sherlock couldn’t blame him, he already felt like throwing up and he hadn’t even heard it yet. “Oh god, the state I found him in. He was beaten on the ground locked from the outside, in a room in the back. I picked him up and brought him out, by that time an ambulance and more police officers were there so we got him to the hospital. It wasn’t anything that could permanently disable him but the man, who turned out to be his uncle was arrested and the boys parents were killed a year before so I offered to take him in for a while.” He paused again but it didn’t seem like he wanted to continue.
"Sherlock, just listen to my voice, okay? Just follow my breathing. In and out, in and out." John said trying to remain calm while helping Sherlock even though he was freaking out.
“What happens when I’m not anymore?” That Sherlock hadn’t thought of, John was interesting he was compelling and complex, what does happen when he loses interest. What happens when he cracks his code, solves him, will he be just like everyone else? He didn’t think he could lose interest but he couldn’t know for sure.
Their first fight, their first real fight. In which John threw his cup at the wall and was upset for days after, it was Sherlock's fault and he felt guilty to this day. John loved that mug and Sherlock took away that joy. It was so simple and pretty and it seared into his mind.
Mycroft's annoying face greeted him, he could think of better things to wake up to. Although it was somewhat odd to see him so disheveled from a night stayed at the hospital, clearly to watch over him. It was touching in an appalling sort of way.
The second time he wakes he can open his eyes there is still a hand holding onto his own but it is almost quiet now. It’s dark and the only sound is a simple beep in tune with his heart. He looks to the new space around him and identifies it as a hospital he figures he must be someone important being able to get such a nice room with no one in it.
“Screw my father!” Jim exclaimed quite loudly, grabbing Sebastian's arm and pulling him to face him quite roughly.
Sherlock quickly walks up to him and untangles him from the sheets. He shouldn't be surprised at what he sees, but he is. He stares shocked for a moment before quickly pulling John into a hug and he starts to sob into his chest.
“I still can’t seem to find them, are you sure you don’t have them In your boxes Mrs Hudson?” Johns voice drifted from Sherlocks bedroom and he gravitated towards it like metal to a magnet.
John disappeared in front of his eyes, he felt his soul break into pieces. Emptiness flooded him and he had no idea if it would be enough but he didn’t want to live anymore. He was alone. John’s dogtags heavy in his pocket as he stood on another rooftop.
He walks up slowly the wood creaking beneath his feet with age and use. His eyes fixed on the closed door a dull orange light coming from beneath the door that Sherlock knows is from Johns bedside lamp. He’d complained about the color not matching the ceiling light before, Sherlock misses it now. He misses everything that used to annoy him now and he hates thinking about it every time.
“Well it’s the best we have right now so deal with it.” Sherlock says standing up straight then taking off his shirt and switching it out for a clean one not bothering with his pants.
"It was ridiculous and there was no point in buying all that stuff when you had perfectly good clothes just sitting in your closet." John laughed a bit at the ridiculousness of the conversation. Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly and John lost it practically doubling over with laughter because this was absolutely ridiculous.
He relished in the moonlight for feeling he’d been left in the dark for ages. His name being called he could recognize vaguely, hardly but a whisper to his ears in the cold of the moonlight. His hands held suspended above his lolling head, something tugging his wrists intermittently.
“What do you think then?” Moriarty asked as he turned around and it should have been a moment of stupid vulnerability but it wasn’t, it was calm collected assurance that Sherlock wouldn’t fire, couldn’t. “Am I all you thought of me to be?”
"Come on." Sherlock grabbed his arm and they were off again leaping over rooftops almost slipping in the rain, this time hand in hand, holding each other up in a way. They dropped down into another fire escape and ran down a few flights before falling against the wall. Sherlock places a finger to his lips and John made sure to keep his heavy breathing quiet. They heard the gang run past over them and when they were gone both sighed in relief, John sagged onto Shelrocks side completely worn out. For some reason they both just looked at each other and lost it they just started giggling and couldn't stop. Probably some kind of hysteria from escaping death.
"Maybe that's why I want to." Sherlock said bitterly before taking on a more subdued expression. "John I am a ridiculous man as you already know, I wreck the flat, put body parts in the fridge and I do experiments on your belongings. I am the most unpleasant, rude, ignorant and all around obnoxious arsehole that anyone could possibly have the misfortune of meeting. And yet you John Watson seem to be the one and only constant presence in my life, for what reason I can not possibly fathom. I have been horrible to you John and for some reason I have only just realized. I am truly sorry." Sherlock hung his head ashamed refusing to look at John's eyes.
Two days later the bet was ongoing. They were both trying to prove he was or wasn’t gay just for the sake of being right for Sherlock and Molly wanted to prove him wrong. (She also wanted new shoes and buying them with some of Sherlock’s money would make her feel better about overpaying.)
John was devastated as well as his sister and father who had loved this woman more than anything. John had expressed that as much as he was devastated he was relieved she was put where he always believed she belonged. They would help her. Harry didn’t share his sentiments and left without a word.
“No, I can’t.” Sherlock said resolutely, leaving no room for argument. Lestrade sighed on the other side of the phone once again and most likely rubbed his hand through his hair.
If he could find John and maybe touch him that might help to get his attention since he seemed to be the closest to him. The problem was locating his limbs would be an issue, he couldn't seem to feel anything much more than his face so anything more than that would definitely be a challenge.
“Well, I like you to.” John says confused as to why Sherlock has told him that after everything he just said.
"I'd better get Molly, she doesn't like to be alone during storms." Sherlock says as he taps around the room to get to the door.
John nodded faintly before pulling himself up out of the chair wobbling slightly and out of the corner of his eye John thinks he sees Sherlock startle, as if he was going to rush to hold him up. John rubs his hands tiredly over his hurting eyes and turns to look behind him. He doesn't know where to go.
In the dark of the night, the sun having just set not too many minutes ago. It would hardly be considered a tranquil environment with harsh winds and rain, hail starting to fall outside. One of the worst storms that the area had experienced in quite a while.
“I wasn’t allowed to play in the snow as a child my father feared the cold, we would hardly open the door trying to keep in the heat. I think I’ve developed my own distaste for it. It’s different now, now that I’ve gotten him what he needs what we need, sometimes I think I’ve dreamed the whole thing and I’ll wake up on a springy mattress huddling together with my sister for warmth.” John admitted quietly shuffling his feet on the shiny floor. Sherlock stared at him, his admittance hung in the air and Sherlock felt the need to reciprocate.
"I'm forgetting my manners. Who have you come with?" She asked as she sits across from them in a plushy brown chair.
"Yes, I've already contacted Mycroft to get a team ready. He said they'll be ready by tomorrow afternoon." Sherlock assured quickly to avoid further panic.
It took a few moments more of driving in anxious silence, alone with his thoughts before Greg arrived at the location. There were other officers arriving about the same time blocking the area off and as such, he managed to get in and spot Sherlock by the ambulance as he parked.
John stood at the door and stared at the wood blankly, willing himself to take the handle and go inside the building that would surely bring back the memories of a life he no longer could attain. He pushed the door open and stepped in regardless and the place was silent.
"What?!" John yelled following him around another corner to see Sherlock scrambling up a fire escape. "Oh." John breathed rushing up as well, halfway up the some of the gang showed up pointing their guns at him. Sherlock grabbed his arm and yanked him up the rest of the way, just barely avoiding a bullet and causing the fire escape to flip up and hit one of the guys in the face. John in the back of his mind thought it cheesy and rather comical. Sherlock vaulted onto the roof and John tried as well but couldn't quite make it, being as short as he was.
“Fourth, actually.” Sherlock corrected instantly as if a reflex, then turned to the voice. “Ah, Lestrade. Impeccable timing as always.” He drawled sarcastically. He looked down taking notice of the briefcase he had dropped.
“Isn’t that the question we’re all asking. It shouldn’t be possible.” Sherlock growls dropping the marker and turning around to run his fingers through his hair
“I know. Thank you.” Jim said and smiled softly, he kissed Sebastian just a light press of their lips. “We‘ll meet by the big tree tonight?”
Oh, John. He’d have him back, really back not just some past figure to haunt him of his true absence. John was no longer just his flatmate, he was no longer just his friend, even now he was no longer just his partner, more so he was no longer just his romantic partner. He was all that and so much more, he was his motivation, his drive, his function, purpose. Before John he had very little to work for to drive for, he had found a new spark of life with him and he was eager to have it back. To have him back.
"He'll be okay, he just needs time." Greg said quietly as they walked the short distance to the crime scene.
"Yes, of course. I'm so sorry about her. She's the worst, I'll get rid of her then we can talk." John rushed from the room to extract his sister from Molly. He came back five or so minutes later thankfully Harriet Watson free, but also Molly free.
“Seems like we have a musician in the building. Wonderful.” Sherlock replied sarcastically closing his eyes again.
He didn’t let go, someone pulled him out and laid him on the damp grass and John was right beside him. He held his hand and didn’t let go, not even once. When he got the chance he looked to his face and what he saw made him want to murder Moriarty himself. Sherlock looked like a corpse, he was hardly breathing at all and he had injuries over the entire expanse of his body.
“I like to watch you dance, you’re such a good dancer.” He seemed to purr and Sherlock felt something in his stomach turn, for all the genius he knew Moriarty to be capable of he had the ability to also be truly sickening on the most simple levels really. Maybe that was his problem but he was inclined to blame the criminal nonetheless for the current predicament was certainly his doing.
“Othew one is bad too.” John admonishes wrapping his arms around Sherlock neck as he crouched in front of the wardrobe to pull out shoes, not wanting to fall down as he moved,
We’d do anything to have them fight again, not with him as some sort of parental figure over John who did as he said without question. He needed his John back, more than anything.
He laid with John on the bed for hours just silently comforting him and holding him close. Even after John was quieted again he lay with him because there was no way he was going to be able to do this, he’d run out of time and had tried everything.
“Because he is as gay as I am, and as fake as that magazine your reading.” Sherlock grumbled and before she could protest switched off the light.
Mycroft is sat in John’s chair spinning his umbrella beside him in a clear sign of impatience. Sherlock strides over, keeping confident and strong in his demeanor sitting on his own chair across from him and arranging John on his lap accordingly. John shys away from Mycroft, still keeping as close to Sherlock as possible but keeps an eye on him as if watching for danger.
“What?” John turned infront of him. The hall was empty and nearly silent when John’s hand slipped from Sherlock’s. He felt the loss of warmth practically pulling away all his own warmth, chilling him to the bone. “How could you..?”
John's calling his name but it's drowned out by the sudden ringing in his ears. His vision is tunneling and he can't feel his legs as he collapses into John's arms. He can't breathe, his throat is constricting and the air is so thin, it's not helping. He tries to clutch at John's shirt but his arms won't move as his body shakes with tremors.
“In your office, I’d rather he not be here for this conversation.” Sherlock says as he falls into a chair pulling his feet over the arm as he stared at the ceiling.
“Well he’s a kid so I talked to him. He’s the same kid I met in uni twenty years ago, it wasn’t that hard.” Lestrade explained with a smile while Sherlock scowled and got up. “Sherlock, quite being an overbearing mother and just be his friend.”
"Sherlock, it's better this way. He can help us." John tried to persuade him, tugging at his arm insistently.
“How long has it been since you’ve last seen him?” Sherlock found himself asking. Iwas more than two years he could tell just by the look on his face but needed confirmation and was trying to be nice. Well nicer.
"Boyfriend." Sherlock says extending his hand and she chuckles a bit nervously shaking it. John blushes and pinches Sherlock's leg as but he ignores it as she introduces herself and shakes his hand before letting go.
"Alright I'll get some candles and you guys can just grab some blankets and sleep here if you want." John offers making his way to the small kitchen to search through the drawers for a candle and lighter.
“She does have a multitude of witch like qualities.” They laughed again a much less controlled fashion. Sherlock found himself laughing more and more lately, smiling as well.
"Sherlock! Shut up!" Molly practically screamed as Sherlock complains about being bored for the hundredth time. "Go bug someone else I have to study."
John was far too shocked to do anything but stand there looking at the place Sherlock had been, arms still up where he was holding the consulting detective up just moments ago. He turned his head tentatively over to the side to see the whole MET just stood there staring at him and some at Sherlock with shell shocked expressions. Sherlock paid them no mind and got into the cab.
“Well if we’re going to do this it is important but I’m just curious really, there are rumors and things you know.” John says sitting on the bed and pulling Sherlock to sit beside him.
It pushed him forward, made him strive to make things right. To fix his mistakes although his body protested every move.
Sherlock too, fell against the opposite wall feeling the rough texture of the paint and the ripples in the wall over years of use with his free hand. Clutching to his work with his other. He looked over to John seeing him looking to the floor with slightly glassy eyes.
"Why do you need my blood anyway?" He asks after Sherlock has filled the needle and pulled it from his arm. Sherlock hands him a small circle band aid and he puts it on the stinging spot.
"Clearly you're smarter than most as you've got the attention of two geniuses." Sherlock smirked a bit.
The power came back the next day but by that time it was the weekend so they didn't have classes. John was fighting with himself on the matter of staying a musician.
"What are you talking about?" John stops as well before he bumps into Sherlock. His expression softens slowly looking up into his sincere eyes.
“I’m not. I’m making it easier. Won’t you just stay here, we’ll deal with anything else later.” Jim said following him, taking his arm again.
Time ticked on far too quickly for Sherlocks liking and soon it had been thirteen days and he’d come up with nothing. No answer no fix, nothing. He’d not gotten any further than he was two weeks ago.
“You are in no such thing. I’ve told you before they are having activities every night that you could partake in. Even specific ones for recovering-“
Sherlock pulled himself up again grabbed his silk robe and left to go across the hall. He peeked through the window before entering, they were both awake watching something on Johns TV in the corner of the room. They looked the happiest he's seen either of them in a long time. He smiled to himself at his success to bring them together before schooling his features opening the door and walking in.
Like reading his thoughts -or just knowing what he needed in the morning- Sherlock brought him over a cup of steaming peppermint tea just like he had made about every morning he could. Sherlock was still on his phone having what seemed to be a heated conversation with the DI. John hummed happily as to not disturb Sherlock's call but smiled at him and got a twitch of the detectives lips in response before he was back to spitting remarks. He took a sip and was surprised that Sherlock didn't put any sugar in it just as he liked it. John was very particular to which teas you put sugar in and don't in others, apparently Sherlock was paying attention to that. It warmed him just a bit more.
‘Still thinking about me?’ Sherlock asked from the window sill staring at John cooly as the wind drifted through him from the open window. The white curtains billowed around him in a heavenly way.
“No, you’re not.” Roger Moriarty, Jim’s father said not leaving room for discussion, a large man and not a force to oppose. There was an underlying assurance in his tone like he knew he wouldn’t go.
"John." Sherlock calls and he goes limp whimpering underneath the blankets. One word and the tangled mess is stilled, John must remember him on a subconscious level more than he realizes.
Doubling over John took a moment to catch his breath. “We did it.” John said turning around to face Sherlock with a smile that slowly fell away from his face.
“You should be grateful you arrogant sod, or you won’t get any of these.” Lestrade chided as he held up a box of something. Nicotine patches, oh heaven. Sherlock quickly grabbed them from him.
“Fine, I have no musical experience.” Molly admits and sits back annoyed crossing her arms over her chest. “You don’t have to be such an ass about it.” Before Sherlock can retort John steps in.
Sherlock sighs softly caving immediately not able to deny him anything. “Yeah okay, I will.” He takes John’s hands gently from his shirt and getting into the bed beside him. After a bit of shuffling and trying to get comfortable both find their positions, John curled up on Sherlock’s chest as he holds him close.
Neither of them could hold in the scream and didn’t care when they could practically hear the sound of Johnathan Watson moving away from the wall. The noise deafening to even their ears as they screamed till their voices were raw.
Each piece placed came with relief and warmth a feeling of completion as well as security that they wouldn't be moved again.
They had both been underneath the knives and pictures if they hadn’t have moved they both would have been killed. Sherlock had saved John really, by going ahead and seeing what the noise was before him. John would never forget it, that is if they ever got out of this alive, he’d spend his whole life repaying it.
"Don't have anything to say." John mumbled quietly, his voice high pitched and far too young to possibly be his flatmate. Not only his flatmate but his lover and as cheesy as it was his boyfriend.
“D-Don’t.” Sherlock stuttered out as he saw the shine of his knife in the dim hallway the pain sparking up his entire being as he tried to move. To keep John safe. To protect him at all costs.
Hello all, that’s correct I’m not dead. I have returned from the depths of uninspiredness. It’s been a very long time and I do sincerely apologize for that. Now though I believe I can continue this story and I’m so glad to do that, I hope I haven’t lost too many of you on the way.
“What are you so excited about?” Sherlock asks smiling fondly as John reaches him. He closes his laptop and stands taking a few of John’s bags he catches his breath.
“Jim, don’t make this any harder.” Sebastian pleaded quietly, moving to the window with his small bag of personal belongings.
“Yeah, okay. Good luck.” As she left with the equipment a silence fell upon them. It wasn’t necessarily an awkward silence but it also wasn’t a comfortable one. Sherlock got up and came around the bed to hold his hands out.
“You wouldn’t understand John.” Sherlock sighed annoyed at himself and the situation. He couldn’t tell John it was because every time he saw him with another person he felt like he was being ripped apart.
Greg made his way over to Sherlock and helped to extract him from the paramedics and bring him back to his car without a word. They both sat in the car for a moment just watching the mess that was in front of their eyes. He wasn't sure what to think of it all but he was sure that Sherlock was already ten steps ahead of him on this entire thing. Although really he should be chiding the man for not telling him what a mess it was here, demanding that he explain immediately but he couldn’t seem to find the strength to do so.
“Got to get to rugby. I’ll see you around.” John never took his eyes off Sherlock even when Molly said goodbye. He only did when his back hit a bookshelf and he ran out with the librarian chasing him down the hallway for knocking over books. Both Molly and Sherlock chuckled at the sight.
“It’ll be alright.” He said soothingly and it certainly wasn’t just for John this time, maybe it never was but he tried to convince the both of them with it. The small doctor nodded silently and leaned forward to hug Sherlock and to which it was returned readily, the last one they’d share here like this.
John sat with a small smile he could picture Sherlock all frustrated not being able to do something so simple. It must have driven him up the wall. And he did it for John. How he didn't notice John has no idea. Though in Sherlock's words he was an idiot.
John followed, his face heating up significantly and ignored every person staring in favor of trying to figure out what the hell Sherlock was thinking.
“No it’s not nothing. It’s definitely something just tell me.” John said glaring up at him hoping to gain information from the ridiculous man in front of him. He wasn’t angry at him he was just fed up with not knowing.
"Out, you and I. Two people go out and have fun a date type of thing, though that's just how it's been described to me. So-"
"I take what I can get it's been a slow week." Lestrade said looking between the two of them. John who was silently looking out the window sipping his tea and Sherlock who had opened his laptop and he as typing quickly with a bitter look on his face. "Christ, you two are oblivious." John looked to him questionably and Sherlock snapped, slamming his computer shut again then placing his hands folded on top.
"So you're taking my case then?" He asked timidly, sitting back on the pillows. Sherlock couldn't help but notice again how small John looked on the bed and next to Lestrade a full grown, strong adult he looked extremely small.
“A little bit.” Sherlock says smiling slightly at the sight of John’s small figure atop of him. He places a hand gently on John’s back rubbing it lightly, soothingly.
“Jim, be quiet. He’ll hear you.” Sebastian whispered, practically scandalized by it, sliding his hand overtop Jim’s own loosening his grip.
"Yes. Did you enjoy it?" He said casually as if he didn't care either way though the underlying of vulnerability struck John where he didn't think Sherlock could.
Sherlock watched the car go numbly from the sidewalk unsure what he was supposed to be feeling, it was easier not to know, to step back and turn around before the car was even out of sight and go back inside the flat with a renewed purpose. To bring John Watson back.
John seemed to ponder over Sherlocks expression a moment, sitting back a bit as his smile faltered. “Why’re you sad?”
”And I told you to call.” Mycroft replies coolly watching in amusement as John squeales quietly and gracelessly stumbling off of Sherlock to hide behind him. “Oh he’s afraid of me, how quaint.”
"Thank you." John smiles to himself and even though he can't see him, knows Sherlock's is smiling as well.
Sherlock tries to call John as he gets into his car and pulls out his laptop form under the seat. He checks the news and finds John is on BBC News with his band. He curses himself again as he gets out onto the road it'll take an hour or so but Sherlock could meet him at the ferry.
“John..” he started and John raised his gun to him and Sherlock dropped his, it clattering to the floor loudly
"No one is getting hurt, not any of us." John said firmly before opening up the door and getting into the car pulling Sherlock with him.
“He’s very clingy to you, even more so in this form.” Came a voice from the door and Sherlock rolls his eyes before raising them to meet Mycroft’s own. “You are becoming attached, brother mine. Perhaps it’s best if I move Dr Watson-“
"I do, in a way. Though probably not on the level that you are experiencing. At some point you need to do what is best for you, John. I think this is your chance." Shelrock advised walking beside him in the cold, avoiding snow banks as they could. Spending so much time outside John became more accustomed to the snow though he still refused to touch it or even go near it.
He fell back into his pillow and after thinking for a bit fell asleep, for the first time in a while.
A race they had already lost to. Greg watched Mycroft from afar talking to one of his underlings. He felt bad for him, he knew he was a wreck, Greg was too but he had the luxury of showing it. Mycroft didn’t do that and it wasn’t that he pitied him for it, he was just upset he didn’t get the option to show it. Especially with the situation at hand, when he was struggling to contain it.
John nodded quietly before leaning forward into Sherlock who wrapped his arms around John’s small frame. John held onto Sherlock tightly needing the comfort for what was to come.
"Grab my hand!" Sherlock yelled, putting his hand down to him but John hesitated a bullet hit the wall next to his head. "Now is not the time for an identity crisis, John! Grab my hand, now!" Sherlock screamed and John grabbed on and Sherlock pulled him up on as another bullet hit right where he had been standing.
Past memories fluttered through Johns mind as he stared out the window unsure of what else to do. Anxiety churning in his chest wrapping around his lungs. He forced himself to focus on the contact he had with Sherlock, their hands intertwined between them and on nothing else but that.
Time passed slowly, far too slowly for the two as they finished with the food and ate. Both wanting to get this over with and dreading it entirely, after finishing they cleaned up in silence both stuck in their own thoughts.
“Your grandmother would be proud.” Sherlock’s grandmother had died a police woman and even though Sherlock's mother was terrified of it happening again, she knew he had to do this.
"Sherlock you're not even supposed to be here right now I can't just let you-" Lestrade was cut off as Sherlock takes the laptop and flips it towards him.
“Photographs. John in hospital the day after.. everything.” Sherlock said motioning to the screen which both men glanced at then looked back to Sherlock with ‘so what’ faces. “If you scroll to the right, John before he was brought home, then John today.” In each picture John looked younger than the last the second there wasn’t an entirely huge difference but with the last it was obvious.
"Of course, brothers always watching." He replied bitterly, silently cursing his brother he moved to the door before stopping to look back at the other boy. Mrs Carson was propping him up on pillows and messaging his neck, prattling along about nonsense but the boy was still looking at him with his glassy eyes. It was still unnerving and chilling as he seemed to be staring right threw him. That's when he realised he was actually trying to stare threw him, at the window in his own room, when he was pointing at the wall with his toe he was pointing at the picture of the sky on his wall. That made much more sense. He quickly moved across the hall to his own room to open the blinds for his window, then looked back over at the boy whose answering smile could light a room. Admittedly it was small and tired but extremely happy nonetheless. He sat on his bed and looked out as well.
"Could I-" He cut himself off, not sure what he's saying. It was odd the words just seemed to come out of nowhere without a thought to it, even grabbing Mrs Hudson was like instinct. She seemed to know what he was about to say though and looked at him knowingly sympathetic.
“Nah it’s alright that was so many years ago.” He shrugged. “I’ve had time to get over it and people to help me. Sure I still miss him and think about him some days but I still have many people who will help me on those days, one of them being the British government.”
“Amazing it’s been really amazing. Especially the night life don’t get much of it where I grew up. It’s a nice change.”
“Didn’t I tell you?” Roger asked from his place not having stirred from his position at all but to glance at his son's state before looking back to the paper.
The Sherlock in John’s mind didn’t have cuts or bruising or stitches or anything, he was still spotless and perfect and hadn’t been put into immense pain because of John. He was still porcelain and had no cracks in his surface, unlike the one he’d hurt still lying in the bed.
I only just realized how OOC the characters are. I apologize but I can’t fix it now so.. whatever just roll with it XD
He didn’t think about it until this happened but this was it, the last of the pips, the hardest one of them all and it was a jibe at Sherlocks only weak spot that a lot of times was more strength than weakness. His heart.
That night they slept together in John's darkened room curled around each other on his bed. Greg and Mycroft had left for the night each going to their respective homes promising to come back in the morning. Sherlock fell asleep quickly from so much activity after surgery and a small dose of sleeping medication put into his IV. Without him knowing of course.
“Shewock?” John says quietly yawning and looking up at Sherlock blurry eyed. He looked sickly which was opposite really. Looking sickly was first and treatment after but apparently this wasn’t the case.
“Molly, John may not say it because he’s kind but you cannot offer him anything that would actually help.” Sherlock interferes looking over to her momentarily before looking back to his papers.
“Greg.” That shut him up and Sherlock knew it would. He always feigned ignorance with his name a long ending joke in a way. Now though it had importance only to be used when necessary. Lestrade grunted in response looking everywhere but at him. Sherlock already knew he would come with him the use of his name was significant and Lestrade couldn’t say no.
A sob wracked John’s frame as his hand fell from the mans face. The man sat there in what seemed to be shock before gathering John in his arms and holding him to his chest murmuring comforting words into his hair. John found the smell, feel and sound of this man so enrapturing and calming he wished he knew if he had discovered these things already. If he had experienced the overwhelming amount of love pouring out of this man.
“Sherlock..” he breathed softly before his lips met Sherlocks and his hands cupped his cheeks, sherlock melted into it immediately. It was new and locket and Sherlock never wanted to leave the warmth of John.
“If you don’t mind.” Sherlock said as he lay back on the bed lifting his hands together, palms pressed together, fingers at lips. “Somehow it’s easier. From where you left off on the phone.” The file thrown to the floor.
Mrs Hudson was with Sherlock today and so John stood alone in the building now. He stared up at the stairs and couldn’t find the will to move up the stairs. He could already feel the pressure setting in on him, the weighted silence making his chest hurt.
“I can’t do that with you. Your a mystery to me John, one I want to crack. That’s how you make me stupid. You and I what we're doing right now, small talk, its mundane I don't do that, I find it dull, but with you it’s interesting. That’s how you make me mundane. I don’t feel the need to beat you or disagree with you like a do with other people who are annoying with their everyday things. But you are different, your complex an enigma, I want to know about the everyday things you have to talk about. That’s how you make me nice.”
“I’m not, one moment.” Sherlock said and stood going into his bedroom and returning a moment later with a small box that he placed in Johns palm. “There’s your heirloom.”
John tried to break them up but he couldn't get a word in edgewise. He sighed exasperatedly and turned down towards the hallway himself, he probably should've just come alone. He started to slowly go down the hallway while the two fought away behind him, if James didn't know they arrived before he did now.
"No there's no point to this anyway. We shouldn't both have to waste time with something so dull." John was going to point out that identifying a killer shouldn't be considered dull but was silence when Sherlock place a kiss on his forehead and started walking back towards the door. John just sort of sat there dumbfounded. Since when did they become so domesticated? "Breakfast is on the stove and there is paracetamol on the counter if your shoulder is hurting you. I'll be back as soon as I can." With that Sherlock was gone.
Molly looked over to Sherlock in shock and mouthed ‘Is that?’ and Sherlock mouthed back in equal shock. ‘I think so.’
“You’re just going to leave me?” His voice was harsher and Sherlock felt his throat tighten as he swung his legs out of the window.
“Just a song you know, I’m sure.” Sherlock waved her off trying to ignore the music that was in fact very familiar to him as well.
John was asleep in Sherlock’s bedroom, the fact that he could finally allow him to sleep without having to worry about his age was a huge weight off his shoulders, already growing heavy with the weight of everything else. Time was ticking by and the days were blurring together as Sherlock worked on.
"John, I'm going to go talk to Lestrade." Sherlock looked to where his brother was standing by the detective inspector and beckoned him over with a look. "Mycroft will come sit with you alright?"
“Then walk slower.” Mycroft tried to reason with the aching detective who was holding onto his IV stand like a lifeline. Sherlock gasped as he took a step his insides lurching uncontrollably. “You should have taken the medication.” Mycroft said as he held Sherlock’s hand and elbow that wasn’t on the IV stand.
“Yes he does. Come on.” Sherlock says again more forcefully. “Your being more of a child than I usually am.”
"That won't happen." He assures looking into John's eyes and feeling his heart ache at the expression on his face.
“I like you, John, for what reason I can't fathom. I’m not inconveniencing myself by being here helping you, odd as it is, I actually want to help you. You shouldn’t act like you don’t deserve to be helped or liked. I like you, I want to help you.” John looked as if we might cry but shook himself out of it as Sherlock put his hand out again. “Can I help you, as a friend?”
"You two are shagging aren't you?" Lestrade asked almost in a pleasant manner which confused Sherlock further.
"Shh." Sherlock says as he takes his left hand in his right. John went silent immediately quickly looking out the window and slouching in his seat a bit. Sherlock smiles smugly to himself as he texts Greg that they're safe and heading to the aunts. Out of the corner of his eyes Sherlock sees John's blush and small smile.
“Just a good doctor is all.” He said distractedly then pulled his gaze up to his face to watch Anderson’s confused expression. “That’ll be all.” He places a hand on his shoulder as if for a friendly tap on the shoulder but as he walked off pulled out a cigarette and lighter discreetly then placing them in his own pocket. “Goodbye.”
“Don’t you realize?!” She screamed jumping up and running to sit next to him on the bed then stared at the wall. “That is Johnathan Watson’s song ‘Pretender’!”
The door opens and as Sherlock steps through John stands about to ask him where he went but when two other men follow him into the office he takes a step back.
Most of the lights were off except a few select lights where there weren't any doors. John imagined them to be flickering like some horror movies he'd seen, they weren't but he couldn't get the image out of his mind. He shivered to himself and rubbed up and down his arms in an attempt to calm himself. He just succeeded in freaking himself out more when he thought he saw a figure standing down the hall. He blinked and it was gone.
“Is it weird that this isn’t weird?” John asks quietly after a while, he yawned a bit starting to get tired after the events of the day.
After that he sat there looking out the window doing nothing, it was dreadful. John’s door had been closed all day so he figured it was a bad day, then again he never asked. It was odd he wanted to see John again, it’s not like they had some deep conversation or anything, he walked in spoke to himself practically and got caught. But for some unknown reason the feeling remains.
“We’ll leave this afternoon.” Sherlock said and went into their bedroom to get ready. Sherlock had apparently had all of John’s few possessions sent to the flat. How John had no idea but he was extremely thankful nonetheless.
To John it seemed as if time had slowed down as his eyes slipped closed, like the weight of the world simply fell upon them. His mind was plagued with Jim Moriarty, giving him images of each time he was tormented. John remembers every scar on his body from him and suddenly they burn under his clothing. His hands twitch with the need to itch at his scars, each one hidden carefully yet they were inflicted brutally without a care for mercy.
"Why are you so interested with what I have to say?" John asks back turning so he's facing Sherlock enitirely.
Moriarty hadn’t advanced according to the tracker though it’s steady blinking was starting to seem like a bomb slowly ticking down. Sherlock watched it everyday between working periods or while he was waiting for samples to process. He dreaded the day it sped up if even just for a moment, not ready for it.
Mycroft made a vow -the only one he would ever make- to be there each and every time for his brother, his baby brother.
“Do you actually idolize me?” John asked giddy as they pulled back for breath after another long kissing session.
"Okay first, I'm not a popstar, nothing of what I write is even considered pop. Second, what does that even mean? Is it a requirement to know that?" John is even more confused than before.
"I think so." John replied taking a breath before stepping forward Sherlock walking beside him as Greg follows behind.
His father clapped a hand on his shoulder and led him to the car. They both got in and drove away while Mrs Holmes stands in the doorway with tears in her eyes.
Sherlock pulled a chair from John's small table and faced it towards him. John was leaning against the door and running his hands over his face.
“Why would you put that in your mouth? It could be poisonous. You’re such an idiot.” John huffed exasperatedly, forcefully wiping off Sherlocks hand on his shirt.
He would dream alone, in his world, in his last creation. In a place no one could touch but himself. Here he had layers, places where things weren’t so bad as the real world. Here he could move freely and live through what he wanted and what he lost.
When he figured out he liked John he didn't do anything about it for a while. He didn't just say it like he thought he might be able to, he was nervous and uncertain. Now that he knew- even if neither of them ever just came out and said it -that John likes him the same, he wasn't so uncertain. He wanted to be forward and able to display his affection for John openly, which he did.
That was until he picked up his phone. It buzzed in his hand restlessly with new messages coming in every minute or so demanding his attention but it was all focused on a singular message. The very first message he had received, a singular text from John among a multitude of calls from Mycroft. Although it was only John’s text that concerned him at the moment, just one message, his location attached. Something was very terribly wrong.
John sits on the floor watching him tracing him with his eyes. Watching as the carpet flips occasionally at the edges and his socks shift down his ankles as he shuffles his feet.
There was so much blood and he didn’t know how to stop it. Like everything he’d ever learned had suddenly left his head. He knew first aid, he knew how to survive and he forgot. He forgot how much blood loss was fatal.
“Boy or girl? Or both?” John asks scooching back to lean against the thin walls that were supposed to be their divide and had now brought them together. He didn’t care much if Sherlock was a virgin or not, it didn’t affect their relationship or how he viewed him but he was just a tiny bit glad he wasn’t, it would make it easier when the time came.
“What I mean is questions arose as to the origin of the problem. As you often say the ‘who, what, when, how and why.’” Mycroft explained to Lestrade who suddenly looked haunted
"What?! Why would I- I wouldn't- even if we were- We aren't-" John stutters over his words dropping the knife and spinning to face her.
They came to stand at the tree where at the best now lit with big industrial lights a message. Scratched into the base and laced with blood it said- 'Johnny boy I've become bored without your company. Send your dog to entertain me. Or I could just collect you myself. Your move. -Jim Moriarty.'
"Sherlock." John said irritated and afraid, as he stops suddenly causing Sherlock to pull him slightly as he was pulled to stop by John's arm.
It became faster turning those slow rips into tears and holes in the fabric. Taking away meaning, thoughts and memories leaving gaping holes of information. It’s maddening yet calming it makes him feel like dying but also like flying.
“Plan..?” He asked instead of anything else as he wearily started the car. In all honesty he was tired of this nonsense. Tired of running around and worrying over the people he cared about, he often considered leaving his career altogether but at the same time it was something he wanted to do. He wouldn’t leave people when there were so few who could do this job like he had.
“Sherlock. Sherlock.” John whispered trying not to panic as the sound got closer, he shook a bit harder in vain. “Come on.. wake up. Please.” He begged shaking him desperately, it was the only way.
Occupying the mind is a difficult task, especially the mind of one consulting detective Sherlock Holmes. As time moves at a snails pace all he can do is tap his fingers to the tune of the clock. Waiting for something to happen, something to change unlike the repetitive movements of his fingers of his mind asking a single question. ‘When?’
He smiled and turned back around to sit in his chair and just watch Sherlock, in no rush or worry with the situation. Unlike the dangling detective who quickly attempted to stop the box from crumbling any further under his weight.
After that they didn't speak of it or John tried and Sherlock made excuses and/or ignored him. That was getting on John's nerves, Sherlock was never quiet unless he was in his mind palace even then he would still mumble. So John found it very unnerving when he wouldn't talk to him unless it was about a case or tea. He kept trying for a few days then another case rolled in and it was forgotten in the hecticness of it all.
Officers arrived faster than John could comprehend and soon enough the area was filled with bright and flashing lights with the three of them trapped in the center. None of that mattered though, all that mattered was the detective. His raven haired detective.
“Okay.” John pouts a bit before plopping down onto his bum to wait for Sherlock, picking at his shirt disinterestedly.
Sherlock was sure that now he knew the weight of them even more than John did. It had been many years since John had even had them, he had asked once where they had gone. Sherlock hated to think of that day now, all it held was pain and he was determined not to fall any deeper into the levels of his mind.
He paused at John’s door having been looking forward to this moment for so long now, somewhat anxious at the thought of it now. He had built it up in his head so much he was worried now what he was supposed to say and do, what if things were different now, what if John didn't love him.
"Don't care." Mycroft sighed irritated as Sherlock walked off with John. As Greg came up he looked to him questionably holding up his hands in a 'what happened' way. Mycroft just shook his head and sighed again, one of the paramedics actually asked if something was wrong he just waved them off. He stood and walked to Greg.
John felt tears trickle down his cheeks at the thought of simply forgetting something so important. He couldn’t bear this any longer. “I’m sorry..” John choked on his words as his throat closed up. The man lifted his head and John’s hand fell to the side lifelessly as he looked into those ever changing eyes. The man moved closer to the bed and sat up looking at John questionably as tears fell from his eyes.
"You're not broken why would I fix you?" He replies in a low tone lifting his legs up and placing his arms on his knees. John shrugged again.
"It wouldn't have mattered Sherlock. It was already too late when I let him into the band." John says softly as he leans back into the sofa and looks into Sherlock's eyes. "It doesn't matter much though."
“Please, you have to find him. He’s hurt and alone-” John begged the police officer that was trying to keep him away from the old school grounds and especially away from the search party about to leave.
“Oh, aren't they sweet! Sherlock seemed much the same, though he doesn't talk much. You could tell though, his eyes always give him away.” Martha said giddy.
John is younger, again. Much, much younger. He's eight or nine at most though John's always looked small for his age -according to the baby pictures he's seen- so he might be ten or eleven. Sherlock holds him to his chest as he sobs and he thinks about what he's going to do.
The wind blew a whistling howl, trees rustling in the distance with the moon light overhead. The area was lit but Sherlock was nowhere to be seen just John and Greg’s prone form.
