It was barely seven am. The morning had started out in a dark mood—quite literally, since they had awoken to no electricity. The day was proving itself consistently worse as it progressed, and Dean hadn’t even left the loft yet. A fast-moving front had barreled through the city overnight, dropping a good two feet of snow on those inhabiting the Big Apple. It was now an apple generously coated in wet, heavy dendrites, which had led to a number of power outages across the metropolis—their building included—effectively throwing the city that never sleeps into chaos. The power had finally come back on at daybreak, but there was still no hot water. Dean had been trying to get through to someone at the building’s Property Management Office for the last hour to let them know of the issue, to no avail.
“Hm?” Castiel turned and looked up at him, smiling.
“Then we will figure out a way to make it work,” his angel replied.
Dean went back out to the dock to fish after breakfast was cleaned up. Not because they needed more fish, although hey—
Castiel made a strangled noise in his throat, eyes dropping to Dean’s lips. He leaned closer and for a second the rest of the room faded away.
Dean lets out a long-suffering sigh and places a hand at his forehead. Something tells Jacob that he’s used to dealing with this sort of thing.
“Shit!” he cursed, righting the mug—which had begun to tip precariously—and surveying the damage. There was a large coffee-colored stain right over the front of his lounge pants that made it look like he’d wet himself. Dean set the mug down and grabbed a napkin from the tray he’d brought, attempting to wipe up the mess.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean said, “’M too tired to argue. Next year we’ll get the six-footer like you wanted, I promise.”
“No, Sam, I’m not,” Dean admitted with a sigh. He took another drink.
“I asked her to consider a career in music but she doesn’t believe it is a possibility given her situation,” Castiel told him. He sighed. “I wish I knew what to say to convince her not to let go of her dreams.”
“Yeah, ours isn’t exactly what I’d call a ‘customary’ situation,” Dean mumbled. He flipped a few of the pages of the book he had been attempting to read back and forth, frowning. “Cas, I know you meant what you said, but listen, I…don’t think you really get what that means down here. To a human.”
“Enough to drown a pirate,” Dean answered her. “You should take it easy.” He glanced at Cas, who was on his second or third cup as well. “You too, Ducky.”
“I remember you,” she said, but that was all she said. She sent Dean one last sharp look and shuffled away.
“It’s not a
Jo shot her a strange look at that.
“Let it go, Dean,” Castiel said softly, breaking into his thoughts.
“Not me,” Dean said with a shameless grin. He swallowed down the glob of masticated cookie with a little difficulty. “I want something, I go get it. Simple as that.” He peered at Castiel, serious for once. “Life’s too short for anything else.”
Dean just grinned and pecked him on the cheek. Castiel turned and gave him another look, this one still squinty but much more adoring than the last. He couldn’t help but smile as Dean swooped in for another kiss, this time on the lips.
Claire scowled at him for a long moment, then wordlessly deconstructed her tower of battleships and gave Jack a curt nod.
The first, shorter man was golden-tanned and dirty blond with strong, defined cheekbones, sculpted lips and bright green eyes. He had on a leather jacket and washed-out jeans, black tee underneath and a pendent hung around his neck.
pissed off. Finally Dean drew his knife, holding it firmly in hand as he faced off against the creature. Maybe a blade through the heart would do the trick.
Castiel hummed and sat up, looking at him in adoration.
“Two hundred,” Dean said, beaming at him, “But technically 40% of that is mine for spotting you the cash,” he said, “You know, finder’s fee.”
“Will, darling—” Helen started to say, touching her husband on the arm to calm him. William jerked it away and spoke over her.
Castiel shifted, looking a little uncomfortable. He hesitated for a long moment before answering in a low, almost-too-quiet-to-hear voice.
“Dean! Your briefcase!”
“You try anything, Zach, I swear to
He rushed it a little, speaking quickly in his self-consciousness. A low chorus of

“I’m not ready,” he says bluntly.
Castiel heard Dean exhale a sigh of relieve next to him and mutter a,
“I’ll be in the library,” he says.
Claire groaned in frustration.
“Because it’s none of your fucking business, that’s why.” Dean slammed the bottle down on the table.
“So like…” Dean slowly licked his lips and shifted his eyes quickly to Cas. “Could he like… keep it?”
“Pretty sure that was my mom’s but it should be around your size,” Dean told him.
“I will just throw it up again,” Castiel complained.
“Okay, okay! You win! I’ll go 80-20.”
“Yes. I mean, no,” Castiel replied, distracted. He nodded to the book propped up in front of her on the piano. “Practice that section one more time and then you may go. Watch your tempo. It was a little fast.”
Dean scooped up a handful of pie guts and spread the whole thing over the length of Castiel’s cock. He followed it with his mouth.
SO I didn't think I had a chapter to post this week. Jack kinda decided last minute that he wanted to be a part of this and I gotta say I was nervous adding him in when I just added Claire in and have a whole plot planned for her too... but as always I give my characters what they want. The chapter ended up being longer than expected as a result and I decided to put Castiel's Christmas concert to next chapter.
Brian stood off to his side, frozen in shock. Dean moved directly in front of him to block him from the demon’s sight. The last thing Dean wanted was another fatality tonight.

amused by the nickname and rolled her eyes.
Castiel’s gaze shot to Dean, who’s eyes had widened considerably. He seemed to be holding back laughter. Damn him. He was a terrible influence, and Castiel was clearly picking up on his bad habits.
Dean pats him on the shoulder as he walks by, chuckling at the way Castiel blinks dazedly at the shortening of his name. “Maybe I’ll see you here again sometime. I promise to hit you back if I do,” he says. He lifts his coffee in salute.
They continued around the store, Dean sampling liberally when his back was turned to the store attendant. Many of the bowls he revisited when she wasn’t looking, and when he could he grabbed as much as he could play off as ‘one sample’.
“Holy fuck, I think I just aged about twenty years,” he blurted. He felt dizzy. The room swelled around him and he took in another deep breath to keep hold of his bearings.
Dean’s gaze shot up to meet his. He blushed furiously and growled a little as he insisted, “I didn’t
feel like shit. “Can you do that for me?”
There’s deafening silence from John as Dean looks up. John blinks at him in shock but says nothing. That’s good, because Dean isn’t finished. He draws an even breath and continues on a little stronger.
They ate in a blend of content chewing noises and slurps of soup. Dean had his forearm propping him up on the table as he leaned over his plate, feeling the exhaustion of the day sink into his bones. The meal heartened him, though, and so did Castiel’s smiling face sitting opposite him. Charlie chattered next to him, telling him all about some show she’d just finished watching that Dean could
at the bar besides poor pathetic assholes—sipping a glass of whiskey almost as fine as he rated himself. Or the man who had just walked in.
“I volunteer Sunday afternoons at a soup kitchen nearby,” Castiel said, interrupting Dean’s less-than savory thoughts. His blue eyes flickered up to Dean’s bright, green ones. He hesitated before asking, “Would you care to join me?”
“Take care of him,” was all Cas said.
“I am sure,” he replied offhand, like he didn’t care either way and his
“Nothing. It’s nothing,” Dean insisted.
Dean rounded the corner to see a bare-chested, muscular-built man smothering a smaller-framed man with a kiss. There was a clawed hand wrapped around the man’s neck, and he seemed to be flailing pitifully against the larger man’s assault. He was getting weaker by the second, as a blue light illuminated his cheeks from the inside of his mouth.
It took Dean a long time before he was able to focus back on his work.
gets hurt, huh?” he joked. Then he was clambering to his feet and pulling Castiel along with him. “You good?” he asked, and at Cas’s nod, said, “Awesome. Follow me. Watch your—er…I mean, be careful not to trip,” he said.
“My favorite so far,” Dean declared.
“I will let you know how the rest of this conversation goes,” Castiel told her. He drew the woman into another tight embrace. “Thank you, Deanna,” he said emphatically.
“Is that so?” Zach responded politely. His voice and eyes were angry though. He checked his watch and shifted the briefcase around in his hands.
Castiel is still for a long moment.
“How long do we have before Sam gets upset?” Castiel asked.
“I’m sorry, Dean, I—!” He moans again, his words muffled by his hands. “It—it’s not you, it’s just—the adrenaline and—t-this body. I’m sorry, I—I don’t have much control over this.”
“It seems you were telling the truth about it being unwrapable,” Castiel said, sounding a little nervous. Dean smirked a little at that.
“We’re meeting them and your father after for dinner, correct?” Castiel asked, “I imagine Ellen and Jo will be joining us as well?”
“You mean you haven’t—” Sam broke off, gasping in disbelief.
! My goodness, I—I’ve never ridden first class before,” the woman on the phone stuttered, “
every night, I don’t think I’ll be missin’ a thing.”
The walk out of Salisbury Plain is long, but it’s a surprisingly nice day and hey, he’s alive, so Jacob’s not really worried about it. He’s a little sad to have left behind such good friends, but he’s robot-heads-over-the-moon excited to be back home.
“I’ve got a lot of stomach,” Dean replied. He resettled his gaze on the pie.
to do this thing without you. I need you, Cas.” Dean paused and drew a breath. “I love you.”
“Sure, Cas,” Dean answered. Castiel frowned at the non-committal tone of his voice.
you!” Deanna rose her hand, but rather than make good on her threat, she merely pointed in earnest at the door. “Go get washed up,” she ordered, “Dinner is in five minutes.”
“Anytime,” Dean said, chuckling. “Call ahead if you want. I’m there all day.”
“You are thinking about the pie,” he said. There was amusement in his voice.
Castiel noticed the direction of his eyes this time and turned to see for himself. Dean didn’t mind so much—they were almost there, and the rest of the surprise would still be hidden from view.
Castiel mimics his movements and brings his gloves up to his ears. He takes a deep breath and then nods to Dean to let him know that he is ready.
“But I’m cold,” Dean whined at him.
Marlene showed them to a small auditorium the group home used as an alternate meeting room. There was a standard piano up against one wall and a couple dozen chairs stacked against the wall opposite it. In between was a wide empty space where the chairs could be arranged in a circle for group meetings. Marlene showed Cas how to adjust the temperature in the room and then left them alone together.
Castiel’s breath came out in a little huff. He almost sounded irritated, but Dean knew that was just a symptom of the anger that still thrummed under his skin. Dean readjusted his grip and drew Castiel in closer.
,” Dean gasped, nearly losing his balance. He shoved his pants down around his thighs and felt the rush of cool air flooding the trapped heat where his cock was fisted in his hand. “Gonna come, Cas—you ready?”
Dean went down hard, his ears ringing. Cas’s face was suddenly very close to his. He was saying something, but the words were muffled. He thought he caught the words
a reporter of the truth, or so he claims, so he may as well come clean.

“One day I want to find someone like that too,” he declared.
“Can I come in?”
Was he just trying to embarrass Castiel in front of everyone? Trying to get under his skin?
“You know I can handle things tonight if you want to go ask her out.”
“And the right time was almost becoming djinn chow?” Sam reprimanded.

“Dean.”
He was so wrapped up in his thoughts of domestic bliss and the faint smell of Dean coming off the soft fabric of his borrowed PJs that Castiel didn’t register the low murmur of voices coming from the foyer.
going to dress up and go out cruising for chicks, but…” The redhead grinned. “A fancy party? Sounds fun.”
“Dean, do you know where my coat is?” Cas asked him.
“I’m not going to tattle on you to the cops,
“It is not an easy topic to bring up,” Castiel said, looking down at the ducks in shame.
Dean grinned and decided in that moment that he liked being a boss. He was also liking the fact that Ed and Harry were now Charlie’s problem and not his.
“Uh, just so you know,” Dean said abruptly, “This isn’t like a—a n-normal date. I just—I thought it might be nice to …I dunno, enjoy the nice weather while it lasts.”
“So, uh, did you want to dance some more?” he asked, breaching the awkward silence.
“How the hell…?” Dean murmured, confused. He furrowed his brow, trying to piece it all together through the stabbing headache. He vaguely remembered leaving the motel room to join Sam on the hunt. “So then…the club?”
Dean’s silent for a long moment, soaking that in.
Castiel pulled back, peering at him with intense blue eyes that seemed to go right through him. Then he slowly loosened the knot around his neck, drawing the fabric taught between his hands. Dean trembled as Cas reached forward to cover Dean’s eyes with the silky blue fabric. Dean let out a harsh breath as he felt Castiel carefully loop it twice around his head and then knot it in the back.
“Not true. We had a number of…
“You are not dreaming,” Castiel replied. The angel took a long breath, as if tasting the air between them. “I would know it if we were. You feel different to me in the real world, Dean,” he said, “It is why I could not be satisfied with our dreams alone.”
This time Castiel let out the chuckle that rose up when Dean pointed to it.
There was plenty of time to have a different kind of rod between his legs later.
Saturday dawned bright and early. Autumn had rolled in overnight with a powerful will and had brought with it a heavy layer of frost and even a few mutinous flurries. The day heated up quickly however, as the sun rose up over the red and golden hues of the trees lining Broadway. Dean could see the mosaic of them peppering the park from his bedroom window, great tall oaks in shades of brown contrasted by the fiery red-orange of sugar maples and the bright yellow of ash and birch. Some trees still clung to their summer green, reluctant to part with their foliage and turn inward for their winter hibernation.
“I should get going anyway,” the older Winchester declared, rising to his feet and downing the rest of his drink. “Need to get to the office early in the morning, take care of a few things.”
In the dim morning light, a few stray flakes of snow drifted down from the heavens, alighting on their brothers far below in the city. A hush fell over the metropolis, as the weight of the snow muted the normally busy streets. Now all one could hear were the sounds of the large, snow-melting trucks that had been deployed in light of the Empire State’s first serious winter storm of the season.
for that pie.
“All the things we could do with strawberry cream pie,” Dean just said, licking his lips and wiggling his eyebrows.
Dean just laughed and wandered off into the kitchen to get the dessert.
Dean comes up behind him with another ball and hands it to him.
Justin grabbed the pot with his right hand and Em’s order with the other and sauntered over.
“Cas here wants to be an opera singer,” Dean supplied, grinning at the man. “What’dya think guys? I think he should go for it.”
“Dad, listen—” Dean started to say.
“He has a point,” Castiel said to Claire, no longer able to keep quiet, “I could help you to study, perhaps. I—”
to tell you himself. So. Good luck with that.” He clapped the guy on the shoulder and then followed after the stretcher, feeling just a little bit better. The open goldfish look on Jesse’s face was totally worth it.
“Jesus—oh fucking Chr—” The string of profanity was bit off by a rough kiss and an eager tongue. Dean moaned and kissed Cas back—a rush of teeth and tongues and mouths that just couldn’t get close enough.
He guessed he’d figure it out soon enough.
“Alright, let’s get this party started,” Dean said, throwing on his Christmas rock-and-roll playlist. He began by helping Cas take everything they’d purchased—tinsel, beads, lights, the
Dean laughed.
Dean laughed a little and then slowly nodded, eyes flickering back to Cas. He allowed Castiel to grip his hand and pull him into the dining room.

one too.
“Ah, n-no. Not yet.” He snapped the menu shut and set it down on the table. “Excuse me, I need to use the restroom.”
“So that time at Bobby’s?” Sam asked, ignoring him.
“…if only so that you may call me a
Castiel hummed blissfully and pulled Dean closer to him, reaching down between them. He found Dean hard and eager beneath the sheets.
and I felt something…familiar so I checked it out. It seems twin souls resonate on a similar wavelength and I picked up on yours.” He says this directly to Jacob, then continues speaking to the two brothers, his voice dropping. “It seems The Empty is out of my reach now that I am who I am. I believe Jacob may be able to succeed where I have failed.” Jack looks between the two Winchesters and smiles brightly. “I’m afraid I’ve got to fly. I’ve roughly seven hundred billion worlds to piece back together after all.”
Castiel slaps the sponge on the windshield and shrugs.
“Just open the damn present, Dean.”
“Next round is on me,” Dean said, setting down the cue. The bar was starting to get busier at this point—they had been playing for a while.
Castiel grunted and shrugged.
There was a beat of silence in the mostly-empty corridor. He felt Castiel shift uncomfortably behind him.
When Castiel turned to him, Dean could have sworn his face brightened a little.
After work at the kitchen ended, they said goodbye to Charlie and then headed back to Castiel’s apartment so that he could pick up a few things. Dean felt as though his entire body buzzed with excitement. Getting to spend all day
Dean groaned when the company car pulled up to the trucking parking lot and he saw the rows of car trailers parked neatly next to each other. His eyes scanned the lot for the glossy black of the Impala, but it must have been parked in the back because it was nowhere in sight. He covered his eyes.
“Yeah, I’m good,” Dean said. He took a breath. “Okay. So… I go in there.” Dean said this while meeting his own gaze in the mirror, in a failed attempt to bolster his flagging courage. He glanced back down at his brother. “Then what?”
“Hey, you’re the one who brought him home,” Dean replied. He nudged Cas again. “Come on, kid made bacon. And coffee.”
In the distance, he could hear the faint chiming of church bells signaling the hour.
“We agreed it would be best if you had your own place,” Castiel explained.
“Yeah, no kidding.” Dean turned away and paced a few steps, running his hands through his hair. He was going to have to say it.
Dean covered his ears with his hands and squeezed his eyes shut.
“That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard,” Dean said. He sighed and pulled out his cell phone. If he wanted the website up sometime this century then there was only one person he could turn to…
the way those pants fit your ass? And that red coat. I dunno, there’s something about it…”
“Shoes,” Dean said, pinning Cas with a look, “Socks too. I’m gettin’ hot just looking at you.”
“Yes, ah…I’m afraid I learned my lesson last night,” he said. He glanced sideways at Dean, his blue eyes soft. “I learned a couple of lessons last night,” he amended.
“Yeah, I have, and like I said, I think it’s bullshit,” Dean argued, “People want things all the time, sure. And yeah, maybe they change over time and turn into different people who want different things, but what if…what if they meet someone and they want to change to be better for that person? What happens then?” He trailed his fingers down Cas’s arm, grasping his hand lightly in his. “Jesus, Cas, I wouldn’t be sticking around if I thought any less of you. I want this.”
“Get off me,” he bit out. This time when he tried to move, his body listened. He raised a hand and slapped away the Cas-imposter’s hand.
“I see,” Castiel said, seeming pleased with his answer. “Perhaps I will give it some more thought.”
The weeks to Thanksgiving passed in a slow but steady turn of time with Castiel slowly on the mend and Dean hard at work both with the company and making sure he was taken care of. Their days became punctuated by the small domestic moments between them. Dean had since returned to working at the office, and most nights came back to find Castiel already in bed waiting for him, either reading the book his father had given him or watching something on TV. His knowledge of pop-culture had much improved over the past couple weeks, and he was actually starting to understand some of the references Dean often made.
Jo smiled and tucked her hair behind her ear.
Dean shrugged.
“So it is. I suppose you would like to come with me tomorrow,” he surmised.
Dean just laughed.
“I don’t care,” he said. “I like you, and I’d like to buy you a meal, get to know you better.” He gave Cas the once-over and noticed as the man stiffened a little. “Come on,” Dean said, “Live a little.”
Charlie thought to herself. She gave Cas an exaggerated eye roll behind Dean’s back.
? No thank you.” Jo rolled her eyes and continued eating.
Castiel’s brow furrowed in confusion.
He could have taken a cab himself, but he wasn’t much in the mood. The walk would give him the space he needed to seriously think about what his next move would be.
“Yes, what was I thinking?” Castiel replied. He was grinning though, blue eyes bright as they looked up at Dean.
“Oh. This is a test, isn’t it?” he said. He took a breath and set down the notepad, straightening up in the chair and squaring his shoulders back. “To see how I work under pressure. Well, you can’t break me, Mr. Winchester. I’m tougher than I look.”
Dean sucked in a breath, then let it out slow. Probably not a good idea to tell Cas the news when he was all drugged up like this. It could wait. Dean could wait to tell him when the time was right—about his father, and about how he felt.
Sam glanced at Dean, who was still working on his mouthful of lemon bar and thus banned from answering. A calculating look crossed his face as he considered Deb, who was standing with her fists on her hips waiting for an answer.
Castiel’s breathing became uneven and interspersed with quiet moans and sighs of pleasure the longer Dean went at it, until finally he squirmed out from Dean’s embrace and turned around to face him, pressing a hard kiss at his mouth. He dragged Dean’s lips open wide and rutted against him, Dean’s hand still under his shorts, a low and hungry grunt forcing its way into Dean’s mouth. It was followed soon after by his tongue. Castiel scooted up and tilted Dean’s head back, fingers framing his jaw as he pushed hungrily into Dean’s mouth.
“Well according to their website, Nat King Cole calls it the Cadillac of burgers. I’m more of a Chevy man myself but… for this I can make an exception,” Dean said.
“Marlene set up a schedule with those who wish to learn piano,” Castiel said, “The first three lessons went very well. All of my students seemed to very much enjoy my tutelage.”
“They may be hurting, but they seem a hell of a lot happier to me than most,” Dean said. He took Cas by the hand. “Come on, let’s go back inside.”
Dean continued down the hall, inching his way along the dreary corridor with his gun raised in defense.
“Then what was it?” Sam asked. He seemed genuinely perplexed.
“You really like him that much?” she asked. It wasn’t meant as a question, but Dean answered it anyway.
“It was not your face I was drawn to,” Castiel murmured, turning a little red.
Dean gulps.
cheating.”
Castiel looked down again and smiled softly. His cheeks felt warm at Sam’s words. In fact, his entire body did. Especially the space in the middle of his chest.
, and immediately he felt like the biggest asshole to have ever walked the Earth, Chuck included. How he ever gained the talent of saying the exact wrong thing at the worst possible moment would forever be a mystery to him.
“When would you like me to put in the order for the wedding cake?” he asked.
“You did,” Dean replied with a smirk, “I’m like you, I guess. I just don’t listen.”
It had been a long, trying day, and to be honest Dean’s patience with his dad—and pretty much everything else—was shot. They’d flown in early from California for an immediate meeting with some bigwig uptown. The airline had lost his luggage which had been an added headache to the morning. After an hour of arguing at the customer service desk, they finally located it—in
“Jack? You did this?” Blondie blurts out.
They had just turned down another alley when it happened—they hit a dead end.
” she told Dean bitingly.
“That was my mom’s idea,” Kevin rushed to answer. He shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “She…thought it would give me a unique perspective on social-economic prejudices.” He answered. “And college is expensive.”
When they arrived Cas took the first opportunity to slip his hand into Dean’s. Dean caught his eyes, and the adoration shining out from them made his stomach flop.
Castiel watched the screen, riveted.
“Well…yes. I do know what you mean. But I wanted to hear you say it.” Jack looks straight at him and leans in a little. “You can’t get what you don’t ask for,” he says.
and anyway we can always wo—” Dean suddenly remembered there was a teenager in the room and broke off. “Uhh…heh. We can um…you know, work out, uhh…harder afterward. And um...l-longer.” He couldn’t help it. He laughed toward the end.
“I spent some time in
“So, how’s the new place?” Sam asked. That snapped Dean out of his thoughts.
Another smothered cry echoed in the street.
Still, it’s better than being dead.
Dean felt a jolt go through him as soon as the words left his lips.
“It’s okay,” Dean breathed. “I don’t think anyone noticed.”
Brian scoffed. “I’m not dumb enough to pick up a
Dean felt it when he came. His hips jerked forward at the sudden clench around his cock and he shuddered, letting out a loud, grating moan as he was forced over the edge. He rode the high as long as he could, then collapsed over Castiel’s back, panting heavily.
“No, small would be an
Dean, who she hadn’t realized was listening from her side, nudged her arm.
“What happened?” he asked, alarmed.
Dean felt a warm glow in his chest and then a sense of grandness filled the bar. He pulled back instantly when he realized what it was.
“I am happy to be your friend,” Castiel tells him, and it’s the truth.
“I’m telling you, it’s not like that,” Dean said, frustrated. “Damnit, why can’t you just believe me for once?”
Castiel hummed.
“Hit me up next time you’re in town,” Brian said, looking up at him from under a forest of dark lashes and a Grade-A Kinney smile.
“We’ve done all the usual tests but we haven’t found anything,” Sam said, missing the exchange.
Deb glanced to the kitchen window, then back to Sam and Dean.
“Sorry,” Dean said to his brother, depositing himself onto the kitchen stool with a heavy sigh, “I meant to call but it’s been a long couple days.” Dean passed a hand over his face. “Cas is fine. We’re both fine.”
tried for a dick. It came out looking more like a duck than all the others. Go figure.
“You’re one of the family, now,” Deanna said. She looked over at Dean, a canny look in her eyes. “Ain’t that right?”
he did it, but he did.
Sam sat up at that, shoving the covers off his face. He reached for the coffee on the nightstand.
The angel stepped forward, set the coffee down on the nightstands and then sat on the bed in front of Dean. Then he reached into the brown paper bag and came out with a donut—and not just
“Company car,” Dean explained, holding the door open for her, “Comes with the territory.”
He finds Dean in the kitchen nursing a beer, his phone out on the table in front of him. There is something bubbling away in a large pot on the stove that Castiel suspects is for their dinner later and he sniffs to see what it is. He detects a hint of cayenne and the nutty aroma of slow-cooked beans and concludes that Dean must be trying out another new chili recipe, and if that is the case, then it won’t be ready for another couple hours at least. This means Castiel will need to find something else to sate his hunger in the meantime.
Dean was just starting to feel that nice warm glow under his cheeks and in the center of his chest. There was a pretty good glow coming from further down as well which he was tempted to do something about as soon as possible, but he could learn a lot about Brian from a game of pool.
Castiel nods his agreement and takes the offering.
Dean pushed himself to his feet. His face was
“I…Dean, this is…I don’t know what to say.”
runs the full length of him. Castiel freezes immediately and his eyes go wide. He can feel where his hardness is pressed up against Dean’s inner thigh, and should the hunter move…
Thankfully, Dr. Roberts seemed just as eager to leave as they were after
Helen nodded, lifting her eyes to the ceiling as her thoughts drifted into the past.
“What the hell is LARPing?” Dean asked. He shook his head. “No, don’t answer that. No time. I’ve got an internet problem here. Think you can show a couple of computer dimwits how to fix it?”
Castiel’s hand was suddenly around him, moving fast up and down to stimulate his own climax.
—hi. Are you Mr. Gray?” Dean asked. He licked his lips, which had suddenly gone dry. “William Gray?” There was no way this wasn’t the case, but it was still polite to ask.
“Pull who out of what?” Dean mumbled. “Cas? What are you guys talking about?”
Dean tooled around the store for another half-hour or so, trying samples to the things he hadn’t tried yet. He hit a section of dried squid and other ocean-themed goodies which were
“Shut up, Sammy,” Dean snaps at his brother. When Sam doesn’t, Dean yanks off one of his socks, balls it up in his fist, and lobs it at his brother.
He dipped down for another kiss, stealing it off Castiel’s lips as he tried to push Dean toward the kitchen. Dean succeeded on the second try and broke away with a victorious grin.
It wasn’t working.
“You never asked,” Castiel pointed out.
“Well damn, let the poor man speak for himself,” Emmett said, sipping at the shot. “Especially with a voice like that. Besides, it’s not like he’s got his mouth full.” The queen grinned and made eyes at Cas.
Across the room, Dean heard John clear his throat. He glanced over, then back to the clerk. Her eyes had followed his, and seemed to put two-and-two together.
Dean flicks at his ear blindly while he’s got his lips firmly pressed against Cas’s mouth and receives a smack in the head from Sam. He grins into Cas, feels the rumble of laughter in the angel’s chest, and somehow the moment is perfect—he doesn’t know or understand
Dean held the plates high over his head and announced in a loud Lumière impression, “Dinner is served!”
“Is what done?” Michael was asking.
“You’re…happy?” Dean asks him, cautious to believe it. There’s a tension of fear from the amulet that suggests the hunter might break should the answer be no, and behind that, happiness simmers tentatively, as though unsure whether it has permission to step into the foreground.
“Claire, this is Castiel. He’s our new music teacher.”
“It is not what you think,” Castiel replied. “I work here as an usher and therefore have special backstage access to the shows.”
“Sorry ‘bout that,” Dean apologized, pretending he hadn’t heard anything. He sat back down and reached for his own mug. “Long flight. I don’t do so well on airplanes. Cas says I worry for nothin’, cuz the chances of dying in a car crash are a lot higher, but—uh…” Realizing he was rambling, Dean trailed off, then felt compelled to finish his sentence lest he sound even more suspicious. “Anyways, I’ll take the open road to the skies any day, but Cas, he insists on flying anywhere more than a day’s drive away,” he finished.
,” Debbie said. She gripped Castiel by the face and told it to him straight.
“I guess,” Dean said with a shrug. “If you
“If I win…you must dress up as a French Maid,” he decided.
“I will meet you across the street,” Castiel replied, “In front of the park.”
“Goin’ somewhere special,” he said affectionately, “You up for a bit of a walk?”
Castiel shook his head.
“Sam, what—?”
“Excuse me,
“Yes, apparently that is a serious nerd
“Oh thank God,” he says, hurrying toward them. He waves and calls out. “Hey! Can either of you tell me what’s going on here?”
“I have a feeling the poor cab driver who gets stuck with me will not appreciate the state I’m in,” Cas noted, looking down at his shirt. There were large splotches of oil and noodle sauce all over it. “And I am not sure this will wash out completely.” He frowned deeper as he realized something. “This will get on my coat.”
Dean’s been teaching him all week how to impersonate the guy, and the more he learns about this
“Cas!?”
. He was not doing this. Oh hell no. But, hey, his hair did look pretty good. He gave his reflection a bit of shrug and a sexy smile and made for the door.
“Drink?” Dean asked when they pulled apart.
“Ed, how many times do I have to tell you!?” he said, “
“Excuse me,” he said. His voice shook with barely controlled rage. Dean was sure he had never seen Castiel this angry before, and for the first time he realized how truly fucking
He couldn’t get to the end of the quote before breaking off into hysterics.
“Yes, very much,” Anna said. Her brow furrowed. “Your costume is…interesting,” she said.
“So I did,” Castiel replied with a curt nod. “Now, if you will excuse me.” He turned away.
yeah, that was what it was called.
Castiel’s hand slipped into his.
“Dean. Your boyfriend. You must love him a lot,” Jack repeated.
Castiel finds the joke he wants to use.
“Next one is us,” he said. He wiped at his mouth with his fingers and grinned softly. There was a look in his eyes that said he would gladly miss it to continue their
“You are not just a pile of atoms to me, Dean,” Castiel insisted. He still looked confused. Perhaps bewildered was a better term for it.
“What is this, the stairway to heaven?” he joked, out of breath.
“She got in a few swings before someone grabbed her off me if I remember it right,” Dean said, chuckling, “And it wasn’t my noggin she was threatening to cut off, just for the record.”
Jo shrugged. “I dunno. Needed a change of scene,” she said. “Mom and I…well, you know how she can get.”
“What are you saying, Cas?” Dean asked him.
Dean cast about the bed for what he knew was there, and then found what he was looking for. He dragged the end of Cas’s tie out from under the rumpled bedspread and twisted it between his hands.
“Don’t go ruining your appetite,” she warned, flashing Dean a smile and walking back toward the kitchen.
“You ready, Ducky?” Dean asked him. He heard Sam snort at the nickname and kicked his foot toward the sound in revenge. He heard a soft curse that told him the blow had hit his shin and grinned, turning his attention back to Cas.
suitcases) and started toward the elevators.
“Dean, I’m sorry for how I reacted earlier,” he said, his voice strained. “I just—”
“What happened?” he asked fondly, a softness to his expression.
“We were fighting.”
“Dean,” Castiel said, stopping him. Dean looked up at him timidly. “How long have you been wanting to ask me that?”
Dean opened his eyes. He was standing on the shore of the lake. For once his serene dream world was stormy, the clouds rolling overhead a deep purple-gray. The wind was whipping in his face and the deep blue water looked almost black. Whitecaps crested over its choppy surface as the wind beat across it.
awesome,” Dean said aloud this time.
He leaned in for a kiss, slowly caressing Castiel’s lips and dipping his tongue inside to taste him. He pulled back with a flirtatious smirk.
The clerk handed his room keys to the bellboy, who slipped them into his front pocket and then grabbed the two suitcases by Dean’s feet.
“You do not need to explain it to me,” Castiel was saying, “I only mentioned it as a courtesy.”
showed up…”
Dean dropped his shoulders, the tension draining out of him now that the drama with Zach and Uriel was over. Castiel stood silently by his side, and Dean found his face unreadable when he turned to look at him.
“Well if that’s how you feel, perhaps you wouldn’t mind proving it,” Brian goaded him, but much of the tension in his voice and in the line of his jaw had disappeared.
Bobby, however, didn’t. The older hunter narrowed his eyes at Cas.
“And I’m pretty sure Cas told you we’re happy to help you out, kid. You didn’t have to do all this, but I gotta say it looks damn good,” Dean told him. He reached for the bacon and dumped a good third of it onto his plate. “Hey, what’s say we eat up and then go open presents, huh?”
Fuck him, it’s definitely door number three.
the fireplace roaring when he got out, as promised, which did a lot to dissolve his sour mood. The other man was just hanging up the phone when Dean approached him with a towel knotted about his hips. He made a needy grab for the coffee.
try and go out on an actual date, she talked a little too much about Harry Potter and…well, she hadn’t gotten a call back. But if the girl couldn’t handle a forty-minute discussion about her favorite HP character, then was she even worth it to begin with?
“As it turns out, yes, but I didn’t like it very much,” he replied.
. It was mostly theory.”
Cas let out a yell, jerking forward and trembling a little at the roughness of it. Dean stilled, waiting for the intensity to pass, for Cas to get used to him being inside him and then moved again, pushing in deeper. He knew Cas was ready when the angel pushed back into him, letting out a long moan of pleasure. Dean rolled his hips in response, getting a rhythm down, then grabbed Cas around his front and began stroking him.
Dean just laughed and gripped the sides himself, attempting to steady the boat.
“Um, can I…can I kiss you?” Dean asked.
Cas blinked and seemed to come back to himself.
Naw, what he had in mind was much,
“I like those shorts,” Castiel says suddenly. He blinks, surprising himself. He hadn’t meant to say that out loud.
Castiel blushed a little at that.
He thought Castiel might argue the issue further, but then he seemed to come to an internal decision (possibly realizing the futility of arguing with Dean) and said, “Very well,” in resignation. Dean grinned at him and dropped a kiss on his lips.
“Forget it, you’ll never find it,” he said.
“I’ve known Castiel for a long time. When he makes his mind up about something, it’s almost impossible to change it.”
“Watch out, Dean,” Jess said, grinning. “That could come back to bite you.”
doing that.
Dean was glad his dad hadn’t insisted on dragging him along to the next meeting. John sometimes joked that he would fit in better with a bunch of mid-western drunks than in a roomful of businessmen, and Dean had to agree with him. He’d take beer and shady games of pool over stuffy suits and sleazy businessmen any day.
“Do you take credit?” Dean asked him, holding up his card.
Going in early meant Cas got out early, so they made plans to meet up for a late lunch before Dean had his final meeting with Mr. Chen. Dean headed over to Castiel’s apartment before heading in to work himself, taking a few minutes to check on how the place was drying out with all of the equipment running overnight. The mattress was still damp and would need at least another day, but everything else seemed fine.
“Claire!” Castiel yelled after her, to no avail. She was already around the corner and in the other room. He heaved a heavy sigh. “Jack, that wasn’t exactly helpful,” he reprimanded lightly. He knew Jack didn’t do it on purpose, but sometimes the kid had a tendency to be brutally honest at times where it may or may not exactly be appropriate. Castiel pinched the bridge of his nose, feeling already the headache rising from the thought of going and speaking with Claire. He turned to Dean. “Perhaps you had better start on dinner. This could take a while.”
“R-right,” Dean replied. The irony of
“Room’s off limits!” he called back over his shoulder, leaving behind a very flabbergasted Castiel.
, exactly?” Castiel demanded, slamming his fork down on the table. His voice wasn’t loud, but it cut through the room with a powerful authority. Dean was sure he wasn’t the only one who felt a chill run up his spine, and he could swear the temperature in the room dropped a good five degrees.
“Well
He gave Dean a short nod, regardless.
Dean nodded. Seemed about right.
He made a quacking-kissing noise over the phone and then hung up.
“Right. That’s right,” Sam said quickly, looking up. He immediately went back to staring at his food.
Cas made a pleased sound in the back of his throat and leaned into him again. Then he took Dean’s hand and pulled him up the hill to the country cottage that was nestled among the trees.
Dean must have been thinking along the same lines, because he smirked a little when he folded the pamphlet of hand exercises in half and slipped it into the bag with Cas’s cast in it.
Castiel made a weak sound that was embarrassingly close to a whimper and swallowed past the sudden cotton on his tongue.
“Uh…” Dean glanced back at Cas, who nodded. “Uh, yeah, I guess we are.”
“You’re losing some serious boyfriend points here,” Dean told him dryly.
Castiel’s blush deepened. Sam snorted and rolled his eyes.
“Heh, your priest buddy said the same thing to me this morning,” Dean said. “’S what happens when you skip church to hang out with me.”
“Just drive the fucking car, Sammy,” Dean snaps at him.
“Picture time,” he said, holding up his phone.
Dean relaxed and sat back in his chair with a goofy grin and a laugh, leaning a little into Castiel’s side as he watched the spectacle unfold.
“Good luck,” Dean said. He pulled the phone away and hung up.
Cas half turned back to him, tilting his head and looking at Dean with the slightest narrowing of his eyes.
“I made out with guy number three at Pride last year,” Emmett cut in, raising his hand.
“That so?” Dean said, intrigued. He leaned forward with his cup.
—please, I—I want you too,” he pleads.
Castiel’s face was suddenly in his line of vision, gripping Dean by the sides of his head.
—please, it’s too public,” Castiel pleaded. Dean hummed, smiling against his skin. He pressed one last, slow kiss to the crook of his neck and then pulled back. He rested his forehead against Castiel’s, noting the color in his eyes had deepened, as if the blue waters of the lake had melted into them.
“I know,” Dean declared, “We’ll pop your cherry with some Jackie Chan.”
“Where is Jack? I thought he’d be here,” Charlie asked, mostly to remind them that they weren’t the center of the universe, regardless of how much their life resembled trashy fanfiction, but also because she was genuinely curious. She liked Jack. He was a good kid.
Castiel actually flinched away from him, and Dean dropped his arm as though it were on fire. Cas’s blue eyes looked up at Dean, wide and unsettled.
Castiel smiles at him giddily.
” Sam started to say.
Dean gave him a half-shrug.
“I say…throw in a real meal and you’ve got a deal,” Castiel replies.
“Wow, I…that was…” Dean laughed a little nervously. “That was pretty fucking amazing,” he finished. It really didn’t do the kiss justice, but then he was more known for his actions than his words.
from his father to go and greet him and felt his stomach flop over as he strode up to the man.
Castiel rolled his eyes a little at that but he also blushed so Dean knew the sentiment hit where he wanted it to.
“Dean…”
“The tools are to fix your sink,” Dean told him. “The other one is a surprise.” He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively. “For later.”
Dean’s head swiveled to look at him, surprised by the edge of bitterness in his voice, but Cas’s gaze was cast away to the side, staring off into the bushes. The memory of what Castiel had told him the other day floated to the surface of his mind. His ex—Balthazar. What exactly had happened between them for Cas to still be so hung up on it after so many years?
“You want like…help cooking or whatever?” she asked awkwardly, fiddling with the handle to the pitcher instead of looking up.
“I decided it was time,” he said, “Time to let go of the things that are holding me back. I wanted…” His eyes snapped up to lock on with Dean’s. “I wished to start the New Year over fresh. With you. In our
“Come on, you know what I mean,” Dean said, sounding a little exasperated by Castiel’s obtuse answer. He turned his hand over in his lap—the one Castiel’s was covering—so that he could grasp it in his. He took a breath and tried for a smile, but it fell a little flat. “I thought…” He trailed off, ashamed to admit it.
“Yes, alright. My break is almost over,” Castiel said, “I will see you tonight, Dean.”
him. He’s like a completely new person…and he’s
“Well, you seem like a bright young man,” John told Cas, “Dean can use more friends like you.”
Castiel tilted his head and thought for a moment, then nodded.
“I don’t know.” John dropped his gaze and shook his head. He passed a hand over his mouth, contemplating the question. “After what happened with Carmen I expected you would be angry, but instead you seem…more relaxed. Happy, even.” John snorted, amused. “Don’t tell me two weeks in a relationship was too much for you, son,” he said.
“Pretty much,” Sam said with a sigh. He clinked his bottle against Em’s and flashed the queen a grim smile. “Cheers.”

“Who the
“You don’t really seem the type to be a bellboy,” Dean said. He caught himself. “No offense,” he added.
“Is this where we are eating?” Castiel asked, noting the change in direction. He was familiar with this place, if the rise of his eyebrows had anything to say about it.
“Cas, we’re in the middle of absolute
The loft was warm and alive when they arrived. Dean pulled Castiel into him as soon as they crossed the threshold, kissing him with all the feeling rising up in the center of his chest—excitement, exhilaration, eagerness, and an intensely sharp happiness that he’d never felt before. The kiss grew deeper, slower, and when he finally pulled away a hush had fallen over the entire apartment. Not even the constant cacophony of sirens and car horns outside could be heard in the small bubble of perfection between them.
“You okay there, Ducky?” he murmured.
thinking, you certainly aren’t doing it with your upstairs brain,” Castiel finished. He grinned crookedly at Dean, blue eyes cast up under his eyelashes, head still tilted toward his coffee mug.
Dean froze with his own fork in midair as he waited for the verdict. Castiel swallowed and glanced up at him.
“Yes, of course,” Cas said. He touched a hand to Dean’s cheek. Dean closed his eyes, taking a deep breath of relief as the pain washed away.
“What? How?” he blurted out when he remembered how to form words.
“She’s not answering,” he said.
As Dean is attempting to mentally account for all the places his lost wallet could be, the man behind him in line steps around him and starts to order over him.
“Cas,” Dean breathed against him, voice raspy and thick with desire. “Cas…
“What’d you take angel Viagra or something?” Dean asked, laughing lightly. He didn’t pull away, just ground their hips together. Cas grunted at the friction of their two cocks dragging against one another through the double-layer of fabric.
“Am I—? Am
The older man reached under his cart and came back with a bag of squished, slightly moldy hot dog buns. Castiel thanked Marcin and handed him a ten dollar bill, to which Dean raised an eyebrow. He could have bought about four hot dogs for the same price. What was going on? He listened to the pair chat easily for a few more minutes about Marcin’s daughter and Castiel’s continued plan for college.
The boy, Jack, nods. He looks at Jacob as he answers.
This chapter feels like such a milestone for me! This was one of the first things I wrote when I started this fic back...oh, 3 or 4 months ago, so it's friggin' crazy to me that it got stuffed back to chapter 8 at over 100 pages! There's so much important backstory in this chapter AND the scene inspired from the title so I'm super excited to finally be posting this one.
Castiel just glared at him.
He flushed as he realized he’d just implied there would
“Nice, bet she was happy about that,” Dean said. He shot Sam what his little brother referred to as his ‘jerk face’—a nod with a wide smile stretched out across his face like a girl had just flashed him her tits. He followed it up with a dirty chuckle.
When his brain cells started firing again, Dean dragged out his phone and made a short call to Kevin to let him know what had happened and how to handle the meeting with Mr. Chen. It was already past the time he was supposed to meet with the man, but he couldn’t worry about that at the moment. He trusted Kevin to take care of it. The kid had more than proved his salt over the last week.
“I learned Spanish in school. The others I taught myself,” he explained, “I wanted to be able to understand what they were saying.”
Castiel looked down and blushed a little, suddenly feeling shy at the memory of what he’d said.
“Yes, that has a nice ring to it,” Castiel said to himself, ignoring Dean’s violently shaking head.
“’M sorry,” Dean said awkwardly. He didn’t know what else to say.
There was a heavy beat of silence following the clear, bell-like ring of his voice.
Then Emmett leaned in and said something that had Sam grinning and blushing, and suddenly Dean bristled, a surge of protective older brother buzzing under his skin that demanded to know what the hell they were talking about.
“And Kevin?” Dean said.
“See that hill? We used to race Go Carts down that hill. Nearly hit a parked car once. And over there is the comic book store where Sammy and I would go on Saturday mornings. Course, when I got older I would skip across the street to the convenience store and look at the…uh,
Dean shrugged.
“Hell yes,” Dean replied. Hey, in work like theirs, there wasn’t time to beat around the bush.
,” Castiel struggled.
“No kidding,” Dean said, mouth finally free enough to speak. “We’re FBI. Agents Halford and McQueen.”
“Yes, very much so,” Castiel replied, “Thank you for the card, by the way. It was…ah…very generous of you.”
“I see. I get angry whenever I feel trapped and powerless,” Jack said. He looked up at Cas. “I’m sorry. You’re helping me, and I reacted like you were my father.”
gossip has dried up since you met this sweetheart of yours.”
They gathered in the living room after breakfast for gifts. Dean set his coffee mug down on the bar, where three Christmas stockings were tacked to the edge and filled with goodies. He handed one to Cas and one to Jack, the last one being for him. This he took and sat down on the floor next to Cas, pulling him into his side.
“Why not?” he demanded, “Because it’s disgusting? Because it makes you look bad? Newsflash dad—I don’t give a shit. It’s my life, and I’m done living it according to
“No, you are not,” Castiel told him, slipping off the counter while still keeping a hold on his arm, “You are going to finish cooking before that devil thinks up some new torture for us.”
The small creature curled up in Dean’s ribcage stretched and fluttered again. It spread heat across his chest like a wildfire, right down to the tips of his fingers. It had to be a mystical creature for him to be feeling like this, Dean decided, because love couldn’t do this, could it? Love wasn’t a tiny dragon setting his heart on fire…right?
Dean laughed a little breathlessly. He wasn’t trying to take away from the moment, but he felt a little weird about all the credit Cas was giving him. It was just an apartment. It really wasn’t anything special. Okay, yeah, so he’d gotten it with this in mind but… why was Cas making such a big deal about it? He had been living with Dean for the past month already.
Dean blinked, looking a little surprised.
“Since I have seen them all, thanks to Metatron, I will leave the choosing up to you three,” he says.
!?” Bobby admonished him. “I ain’t getting any younger. I swear you’re gonna be the death of me.” Bobby paused and took a breath. “And since
Ellen glanced over at Jody and winked.
Castiel twisted in his seat to look at him a little better, surprised that Dean would be interested in doing something like that with him. The look on Dean’s face was quickly becoming embarrassed again, his smile fading and the crinkles around his eyes falling back into the skin around them at his rising uncertainty. Castiel sent him an affectionate smile and thumbed back to the front of the book.
future. A
Dean plans on telling his dad about Cas, if he can just get the words out.
“That is illogical,” Castiel said in between the press of his lips. “It will not fit through the door.”
Dean broke the tension in the elevator by pulling Castiel in to him by the collar of his trench coat. Castiel made a small muffled sound of desperation and then his mouth yielded open, allowing Dean’s tongue to slip over the rough, half-chapped threshold of his lips.
“Cas!” Dean whispered shrilly, a warning to his voice.
“It’s one stupid meeting,” Dean snapped at him. He took a deep breath and ran a hand over his face, then held it out between them. “Look, I sent Kevin over with a bottle of scotch and my personal apologies. It isn’t anything you wouldn’t do. What about when Sammy broke his arm? I seem to remember you canceling all your meetings for a week to be there for him.”
“Cas, what—?” Dean started to ask.
“I didn’t lie,” Dean said in a short, clipped tone, “I just didn’t tell you. I would have, when the time was right.”
pillows? Seriously? Don’t you think that’s going a little overboard?” Dean said.
“Cas, no. Just…no, okay?” Dean rose up from the table, avoiding eye contact. “Yeah, this isn’t going to fly. Sorry. I…” Dean shook his head. “I just can’t, okay? I’m sorry.”
“Helen? There is someone here to see us,” Mr. Gray called down the hallway to his wife, “A friend of Castiel’s?” He said his son’s name with an upward trill on the
“What? Romeo and Romeo?” Claire grumbled, heavy on the sarcasm. She scoffed and rolled her eyes. “Please.”
“This is Jody,” Dean introduced for him—rather unnecessary since Castiel had already figured out who she was, but he appreciated the thought.
anymore?” Brian shot back, laughing at him.
Castiel’s eyes dropped in sudden shyness.
Jacob laughs at that.
He felt the bag of moldy hot dog buns hit his back as Castiel looped his arm around him and pulled him closer, breathing into him and pressing back eagerly. Dean opened his mouth a little wider and Cas’s tongue slipped in, tasting and exploring and seeming to ask questions that Dean didn’t have the answers to just yet.
“You know… ’s gonna be hard to find a job without a GED, at least,” Dean said, “You might want to reconsider that.”
“Yeah, okay,” Claire said finally, giving in, “Maybe you’ve got a point.
“How was work?” Castiel asked him as he gave the pan a good shake.
It was like passing into a different world. The sun had set fully, twilight hovering around them like a thin blanket. Dean pulled the oars again, turning toward the small glow of fairy lights that marked their destination.
“Oh. Uh, can’t,” Dean said. He gulped, hoping the blush that worked up his neck wouldn’t reach his face before this little chat was over. “Date tonight. And I’m not cancelling again. I already made reservations.”
“Heya, Sammy,” Dean replied. He was already grinning and he didn’t really know why until he remembered with a jolt that
Dean felt his stomach do a bit of a flop.
Dean worked diligently all morning, learning everything there was to know about Mr. Chen, his business, and how he ran it. He took a break around three to fuel up with cookies from the lobby. He kneaded at his forehead on the elevator ride down. He had a slight headache starting, possibly from all the stress and responsibility hanging over his head. That or hunger. He hadn’t even stopped for lunch.
“Really, Cas, it ever occur to you that my happiness is with you too?” Dean tells him.
“I’m nervous,” Castiel said finally, “About the future. All of my dreams are coming true, Dean.”
They headed back uptown after that, grabbing the subway just in time to catch an express train to Fifth Avenue. The sun was setting by then, its last golden rays sinking behind the tall skyscrapers while they were in the shadow of the subway station. When they emerged it had winked out of existence and the city was abruptly transformed into the soft yellow of street lamps and the dusty grays of the trees lining Central Park.
“I really don’t know,” he replied.
“You’ve just demonstrated that isn’t true,” John said, throwing Dean’s impulsive business decision back in his face. Dean winced. His father was testing him, daring Dean to fail and prove him right.
Castiel chuckled.
They made out in the foyer for an obscene amount of time. Sounds of soft grunts and murmurs of pleasure echoed in the modest entryway. Castiel’s hands slid up the back of Dean’s shirt, palms pressing him into the other man’s chest. Dean had one hand on Cas’s waist, the other on his ass, doing the same. With one last slow caress of his lips, Dean tilted his head back and looked down at Cas from underneath thick blond lashes.
“Dean, it’s just a car. Chill the fuck out, dude,” his brother said.
“Actually, I flew—” Castiel began.
“I will see what I can do,” Cas was saying.
Dinner was later than promised by almost an hour, but what it lacked in punctuality, it more than made up for in flavor. Dean had dredged each small filet in panko breadcrumbs and then fried them to a glistening golden brown. There was a number of bowls and salsas arranged on the table along with the platter of fish and a small plate of warmed soft-shell tortillas, with the guacamole having been scooped into a smaller bowl so that it could also be used as a topping if desired. Dean left the chips on hand for the table to snack on with their meal as well.
