“I never agreed”, Sherlock tries to appear haughty, but then John is throwing a blanket over his lap, and so his feet, too.
She’d never understand. Her one-sided view of the world would never change. It’s of no use. Anger boils inside his gut once again.
John takes a step and settles in the nearest chair.
“Would you like me to make anything?” John speaks after him, taking a sip of his tea in the process.
“John. A word?”
“Not much for it.” He mumbles to himself, gets his hankerchief out and wraps it around his palm with a small shrug of the left shoulder, already itching in tense pain.
Sherlock waits for John to freshen up a little, and then transfers Honeybee into his arms. With John upstairs to put her to sleep, Sherlock fills the cupboards and fridge with the groceries. John has equipped them with armfuls of vegetables and fresh fruit –and a heap of oranges; Sherlock has a nasty feeling about where this is going.
Sherlock frowns, swallows, and scrapes his throat raw. A
Sherlock breathes.
Taste of tea, scratch of stubble. Wool and baby powder, and silver hair, deep-sea eyes and that easy smile, his, all his, as he kissed him.
“Yes, of course. I trust yesterday went well?”
‘Hang on a minute.’ John shoots Sherlock a confused glare.
Oh, he was selfish, wasn’t he? Needing time for himself. Needing space. Needing to come to terms with everything while everybody else had to tolerate him being stuck. And now that he didn’t need that anymore, expecting everyone to be ready; to talk. To spend time together.
“Moderately.” comes the delayed response.
He’s barely slept, but there’s no telling John that. Last night when they decided to finally go to bed, they had done so on the mutual promise that they would try to get as much sleep as possible. Before that, they had stayed on the floor by the fireplace, each under his blanket, until John complained that his back had started protesting, and as the ‘old man’ that he was, he couldn’t ignore it. They moved to the couch. No telly, this time. They just sat, side by side, blankets draped over their legs, and watched the silence of the night crawl by. Lastly, they had drifted to the kitchen for their customary late-night cuppa. It’s a relatively new find; John brought home a new, soothing chamomile tea last week. Said he hoped it would help them get some sleep. It normally did, but not that night. Sherlock’s eyes could not stray away from John for long each time. And though their eyes did not always meet, Sherlock felt John’s gaze on him, like a second embrace above that of his dressing gown’s. The words of John’s confessions and apology still hummed between them, comfort in their aftermath. They nestled under Sherlock’s skin, John’s presence beside him more solid than it had ever been before.
“What ‘what’?”
“Shhh shh… shhhh hush, Rosie, please…”
“Ah. Yeah, that was my sister. Harry. We… figured things out”, he balances Honeybee on his hip, as she mumbles ‘awaa’ to a doting Mrs. H -who nonetheless raises an eyebrow at John’s words. Sherlock can guess what she is thinking: the sister that was absent from the wedding, the sister that was absent from the christening, the sister that I have never seen around and about whom you don’t speak, how lovely.
She has eaten so he guesses she’ll be alright for a while, play freely on her own, without any looming fears regarding him. He turns to the corridor, taking a breath. He needs to check on Sherlock. It’s not late and John is overreacting but he needs to know. He needs to take care of them both. If he fails one, it’s quite possible he’s failing the other at the same time. Sherlock might as well be sleeping and if he is then John can relax and let him be in peace.
Also, here's a reference of Rosie's baby seat:
And then there was that last one. Yesterday. More like a dream. John hoped it wasn’t real. ‘Please, God, let it not be.’
He mustn’t see. Not after that. He must manage to ignore and avoid. Because he can’t look. He just can’t. He needs to see. But no. Please. There are consequences he’s not ready to deal with...
Blue eyes blink at the speed of a hummingbird’s wings.
“Here. Drink this.” The baritone intervened.
“I know.” He frowns, just so. “Rosie needs it. Balance. In her life and the people she interacts with” His voice trails off.
“I don’t want to see you walking around barefoot again. Your poor toes are freezing”
Rosie has eaten most of her pea puree by then and is attacking the carrot one.
John waits, sees the eclipses, a sign Sherlock’s typing. A knock sounds at the door. John startles.
Sherlock jumps to his feet and rushes to the bathroom. He hits his shoulder against the door in his haste, almost knocks the med kit off its shelf before he can catch it. His breath has turned into something he has to chase, something he can never catch.
"You can have fifteen"
TW: please be aware of some graphic self-harm and suicide ideation again in this one. as well as alcohol abuse. Love you all <3
“You don’t have to”
And John grieves and misses. Misses
*drumroll*
John carries their mugs to the table and is ready to settle, when a quick glance of his own informs him of what Sherlock was hoping he wouldn’t notice.
He needed a drink.
We're back! With 19k words of a chapter! Hope that can make up a little for the delay in updates!
Eventually all their belongings gathered, all their lives packed away. John called the cabbie, feeling like doom itself. Didn’t even say goodbye to the house he -mostly- shared with his wife and daughter. Three boxes. Two suitcases. The cabbie gives them a sour look but doesn’t mind. They get in.
‘Utter, utter cock.’
“Yes. I-I still don’t feel I do my best but… I’m working on it.”
He likes it. He can’t stop it. He enjoys it.  It’s not like he’s the one doing it all the time. Sherlock usually does. Fussing and tea. He’s the one knowing how to treat best the precious herbs, soothing chamomile from the Mediterranean. But John gladly takes on the calming routine, inhaling the soft vapor of the hot liquid, remembering the healing properties of the tiny dried flowers. Sherlock should be up soon. John tries to time it, wonders if he should wake him himself. Sherlock would hate to have his tea cold or re-heated. Because warmed up old tea is
“You don’t have to”, John said instead, calmly. He indicated the half-full spoon Sherlock was holding. “It’s alright. Just… If it’s heartburn, I think I have something for it”
way, is he? A junkie and a psychopath but brilliant and not dirty, not soiled, God’s child, not a sinner-”
John looks at him, expression open, heart open to be enlightened. Somehow, he feels they have slid into another conversation in need to be had instead of the one Sherlock was stirring up.
Sherlock knew why she was crying; she is afraid of water, of being alone in its warm mass. The first time he had to bathe her because she had gotten her breakfast all over her torso and face, was the second day after John had moved back to Baker Street. When he and John were barely talking, barely acknowledging each other.
“Fuck.” He breathes, looking away and swallowing. “We just- we just need to get this done.” He tries.
What was there, suddenly, that Sherlock was worthy or able to possibly offer?
He steps out into the kitchen.
“Can you pinch me?”
“Rosie… my little girl, please, let me…” He whispers as in prayer, lowering them both down again.
her. He had been overwhelmed with therapy, addiction, Sherlock rejecting his care. The John with his feet firmly planted on the ground would not have snapped even then.
“Hello there” He clears his throat -and his mind; banishing the ruminating worries of the past. Momentarily.
His little girl. There she was. For the first time in days, he... he
‘She’s in good hands, isn’t she?’
Not that he’d ever be able to afford it.
“Because you are you.”
“Home…” Sherlock’s face is pale.
She pats a hand near her bowl of food petulantly, stealing him away from his thoughts. He raises the spoon again and this time she opens her lips, willing.
“She always loves it, Sherlock.”
“Come on. Let’s get to you to bed” John grunts a little as he has just lifted her up and her weight registers on his tired muscles, “-there we go. Say ‘goodnight Sherlock’!”
I understand that he’s your friend. But is that reason enough to pick him over your
As always, thank you for reading and bookmarking and WOW, this story passed 200 KUDOS!!! We'd love to see your wonderful comments as always and thank you to each and every one who is enjoying our story!
John almost screeched before starting to giggle. Not only Sherlock remembers one of his favourite shows and knows when it is playing on TV but he tried to tell him while holding a spatula in his mouth. Sherlock’s deep rhythmic ever-increasing laughter soon follows John’s own.
He talks of the trees, the park around the corner with the huge playgrounds and waterslides. She starts to smile and turns her little head to watch. Her baby elephant forgotten inside John’s biggest pocket. It’s tentative at first but as he whispers of little dogs and flowers and secret gardens on the back of those houses, right there, Rosie, see?, making up adventures and mysteries on how to find hidden keys and pirate treasure as he goes, she looks over at the black wooden doors, white entrance frames and elegant columns with wide eyes, wondering what they could be hiding.
He had memorised how the lines of his face changed when the moonlight gave way to sunrise. How sharp shadows turned mellow and soft just when morning dew set on the windowsills and the streetlights were bright only under brick shadows of high buildings. How the perfect bow of his lips was swallowed by the grey light of those early hours, finding them together beside a dark fireplace. John’s feet always sock-clad and warm, hesitating in his need to reach and place them over Sherlock’s bare toes; long and bony and freezing against the carpet.
“Sherlock doesn’t think she has any hearing problems at all and frankly, I agree, she understands everything I say even.” He paused, bit his lip. “That’s what worries me the most. If I have said or done something -or many things- that she understood without me meaning to… If she’s…”
“The hair. Your hair”, John explains. “You’re done already. ‘Course. Got it”. John smiles.
The tall slender man stands at the door, perplexed.
“Here. We better wake her up for a moment. She needs to take this. As soon as possible.” John puts the ibuprofen on the table, their gazes catching. He contemplates. “How long she’s been sleeping?”
“I should have…” John stops, sucks an inhale of air through his teeth. “I should not have ended up needing them”
from his lonely hospital bed. Of course, the scandal he watched always differed from the mangled nightmare he had lived. Until Christmas, the news was flooded with reports for the fall of the serial-killer tycoon and speculations for the unknown fate of the previously fake detective, the one who was admitted in hospital, after being diagnosed with kidney failure, borderline liver poisoning, severe drug addiction, a cracked ribcage, and a broken nose. The one who-had-faked-his-death some years ago, remember him? And then they would unearth that story and start again. They did like to linger on the details. And on adjectives. Piling them up like balls of hay, like a magpie’s collection of tiny, shiny, stolen things.
John repeats the doctor’s qualifications in his mind. One with each step. He has memorised them all. The second-best way to soothe his anxiety on the matter; Sherlock being the first. He keeps whispering light words to his little girl as they turn the last corner and another traditional street of Maida Vale comes into view.
In the kitchen, he sets the kettle to boil, then leaves the tea to brew. Every movement is calculated and precise.
“You don’t know him.” He growls, stern.
John inhales deeply, and Sherlock can feel him mustering courage. It makes him nervous, too. “So… Was this… Was this alright? Me, hugging you? Would that be an okay thing to do, sometimes? And by sometimes, I mean, when you want it?”
His hands move with measured movements as he dresses her and she’s too weak to protest. She falls asleep there and he stays silent, soaking wet, looking at her. He would give everything he has to know what is wrong with him, to know how to fix it, to know how to… She doesn’t deserve his mess. She needs someone better.
John falters. “Happy? Okay, yeah. Something happy it is”
.” The words fall heavy like stones and quick as lightning bolts. “Your makeup is not the correct hue for your skin tone and yet you have applied copious amounts to it; it is required of you but you
“We’ll be there. Very soon. Hush, little Rose.”
The kitchen is silent. Sounds non-existent. Sherlock is listening. Tuning in. Maybe searching for John’s sounds around the flat, just like John does so many times every day. Constantly, in fact. Having lived in an empty Baker Street, with not a pip of sound from Sherlock’s then crazy and manic moods and character, is the worst John has ever lived through. His body is attuned to make sure it’s not all happening again. Programmed to check that Sherlock is there. Alive. Breathing air. The same air John does.
John swallows.
John falters a little in checking Rosie’s bag is packed with everything they may need -and extras, before he looks. “Yes. Yes, of course”
and as always #comments_feed_our_plot_piranhas
Sherlock is angry. He wants to pull at his hair, hard enough until his eyes sting. He wants to break it, this stupid transport, what he has become. But this transport is unnervingly still, and for one otherworldly moment he is sure he has lost any control over it. He can’t move.
“It’s alright, little flower. Greg is a friend, remember? He puts criminals in jail, just like Sherlock, mm?”
Sherlock shook his head.
“I want you to know that there will be sessions focused purely on her or on you and then your individual relationships with her.”
“Not at all. I’ll remind you.”
Sherlock remembers her text, spiky and angry. “She has her reasons”, he replies. They were never friends on a proper basis after all, and she was right; he abused her kindness, in no way can he amend the harm he’s done. He regrets most of all that this is keeping Honeybee away from her godmother. The two were close… He decides to text her later, that if she wishes to pass by to see Rosie, she only needs to text him when and he will make himself scarce.
He wants to scream. Join the voice in his head screaming at him to fight back. And he tries. He tries to muster all his courage, hang on with teeth and nails by every argument, but he’s losing. He’s already lost it.
Oh! That’s efficient. John nods towards Sherlock, reassuring him. The genius returns his full attention to Rosie, taking the spoon in his mouth as she coos, without realising he has stains over his short stubble. John paces to the window and looks outside just to restrain himself from bursting to laughter.
The voice was there. John blinked, needing to make sure the physical presence was real too. There he was, as he hoped. The man himself. Blue was the only colour John could see, his eyes still clouded over. There was deep blue, silken, taking him in its waves, guiding him home. The nightgown transferring him to secret chambers, well-hidden memories of the old times. Happy ones. Of blue eyes, shining rainbows like diamonds. Crystal clear and sparkling with excitement. Laughter.
John strides to their sofa, smiling in reassurance. He takes a handful of pillows and two warm blankets and returns, splaying them between their armchairs, pushing them nearer to the fire. He hands a blanket to Sherlock.
“Yes. Thank you”
“That good?”
A pause. It would never be simple…
care!”
‘Dr and Mr Watson’
Snap him out of it.
Sherlock’s head falls to the headboard with a small thud. John jerks. He’d been phasing out, hadn’t he? The bony profile looks exasperated. Of course, he would be. Ordinary people always were too slow for Sherlock’s mind, and right now John is hitting it off with the worldwide record of the slowest start at an important conversation.
And even though Sherlock hasn’t said ‘yes’ yet -or even if he says ‘no’- John is all the happier for it -boy is Ella going to be proud of him.
!”, he exclaims with a loud ‘boop’ kiss to her nose. She giggles and boops him back, and he is already up again, in a flurry of messy curls and blue dressing-gown, rummaging the drawers of the desk for something to write on -something must have survived Mycroft’s stupidity in this house. “Eureka”, he grins, pulling out a journal with John’s initials embossed -routine gift from the clinic for the holidays, most probably, to note down appointments and the such. Finding a pen is easier -Mrs. Hudson keeps some in the top kitchen drawer for her crossword puzzles.
He hears Sherlock swallow.
“Yeah, I’ll be there.” He takes a breath.
John swings his legs out of bed. He had kissed Sherlock Holmes. His head is in need of clearing and he’s not about to let it win by sulking in bed all day. He had kissed Sherlock Holmes. Whatever happens thereafter, he can tackle it. He had kissed Sherlock Holmes.
. He remembers flicking through it that night, absentminded as he was, a bottle of scotch in hand.
It is then, he realises in himself the pride of a soldier born again, his mind elevated with the dignity he always carried in battle, his body recognising the cautious and fair judgement over the use of his power, being returned.
John came to it then. Admitted it. The truth. His truth.
Sherlock kneels on the ground to be on the same level as her in her smaller baby chair. She does not raise her gaze to him, studiously sticking her tongue at her artwork with concentration. Her newfound fascination with her colored crayons has been going on for half an hour now, and Sherlock has been most amused by how she is trying to refine her fine motor skills to grip the crayons better, how she has been focused on a single activity for quite so long on her own, and how she really seems to be enjoying this; giggling as she tests out different colours, as she discovers the freedom with which she can make them flow and clash and transform on the paper.
But if he admits now, one or both of the truths that plague him with the vicious need to be both revealed and concealed at once, the end will only come faster. Sherlock is not ready for that. He is not ready to face the events his truths will unleash.  As much as he may try to excuse himself, at the end of the day, he
‘High-functioning sociopath’
“Sherlock?” John’s fingers curl and twitch and stretch, nervous. This isn’t- it’s not- Sherlock isn’t-…
he can help. They are friends again, alright, but now this is being tested for the first time, and they had set no boundaries, no guidelines for cases of emergency like this one. But there is nothing to it; there are things, achievements, progress that are at stake if that fire is allowed to burn and destroy as it wills. All these days, Sherlock’s mission has been to provide John with a steady home to go back to, a stable environment, safe for healing. This peace is being threatened by whatever has become enclosed within John like an atomic bomb. The least Sherlock can do, is help him diffuse it. He doesn’t know a way. So what? He’ll find a way.
“Hey...” A gentle whisper. “Couldn’t sleep?”
Their relief is palpable in the air, tangible and real. John giggles into Sherlock’s collarbone and it is then he finally feels Sherlock’s arms come around his own torso too. It’s then he gasps -and one could think it was the excitement or the rush but it wasn’t, not at all- when Sherlock’s lips rest imperceptible over his forehead, close to his hairline, making the spot burn as if scorched, making John memorise it while holding Sherlock so so close, closer than ever and in desperate need to just memorise all of it, all of
Why get up? John will be fine without him anyway. (No, he would be
(maybe a little less mustache on John and please see Sherlock with his actual hair xD )
That’s all it was now. A world of coping mechanisms. A world of avoidance. And not just for John.
Of course, the strongest point he ignores is himself. They pass by to check on
A bar. ‘Let’s find a bar, then.’
Hey there darlings!
And it’s gone.
“So you’ve said”
He rubs a palm over his eyes. They’re sore, as if they’re puffy, and they hurt when he presses them.
“It’s just…. Important. To me. I…”. His throat constricts, and his voice gets strangled to a whine before he can continue. “I want. You. To be well”
“I didn’t know.” Sherlock smiles, hesitant.
“I could’ve sworn I had seen it there.” Sherlock presses the power button, surfing through the channels for a while.
Sherlock wonders how come Ella let John try so many things at once, when he has a full-time job, and Rosie. It is a demanding program, a freight train of one. But John seems to cling onto it, to need it. Sherlock tilts his head to the side, observing him. John is nervous putting it into words, even though he has waited for some days to speak about all this with him, has had the time to think his decisions over. Yet with every word he winces, as if he were admitting his faults, his wrongdoings one by one, all over again. Sherlock does not doubt that John has taken up the ‘getting better’ cause like a flag-bearer in war. But he can’t help but worry that some part of John’s urgency stems from the same anger that had him pulling at his hair, striking his head, then speaking of his condition as if he were a leper, and had to be blamed for being one in the first place.
Sherlock looked up, a fed and changed Honeybee in his arms, trying to press the keys on the laptop in front of him when he wasn’t looking.
“I guess… I want to know what is wrong… so I can help him better… But I am reluctant to suggest…” He indicated between them.
‘Not you too.’
. From that first day, he has always seen it. Along with the silence from the other front. Her godfather. Unresponsive in front of John.
He approaches the bed careful to catch any sign of accusation from the piercing grey gaze, flickering back at him. Instead he thinks he gathers resignation. He’s not sure, he can’t be. Not now. He wants to be. John’s knees give slowly, situating himself seated at the edge of the bed. The mattress dips almost reluctant at his weight. Sherlock is eyeing him, more with confused curiosity than anything else.
okay”. His volume has risen.
“It’s a mess. A bloody mess -there’s so many things I’ve never…. I’ve never said, so many…  Things that don’t make sense, I know, so many things I could never give you… Even if you say no… But could I… Could I tell you? Now? Little by little, day by day? I want to… I want you to… to know me. All of me. I want… I want to be… I… Please… Can I try to at least give you that? Please… Will you listen?”
angry with him”
This is their home. Honeybee’s home. John’s home -even if only temporarily. And Sherlock has sworn to make it a safe haven, a nest of stability, where they can heal, free from harm. Harriet is as out of place in 221B as a hawk among sparrows.
John looks up at him sharply, gaze hopeful. He hadn’t known. Rosie had been kind of better with him for less than two weeks.
As if she has understood, Honeybee noms her elephant’s ear and mumbles a few definitely possessive syllables for good measure.
Sherlock watches as John tries to reason with their Smart TV, to little avail, at first, feeling that he does not need to reply to get avenged on his point.
“It’s alright.” She hums as if amused.
‘All well.’
He is bleeding a lot. John bites his lip. He has to stop that first. Then they can resolve the reason as well.
“Indeed, it has.” She’s not pressing but he knows she is expecting his answer and progress.
He hates that this is not any better than what
John settles Rosie better over his arms.
“What?”, she cackles drily. “What? You can’t even bear to hear the word, can you?” Her voice has softened.
His fingers flex. He’s standing upright, in attention. Phone pressed against his sweaty earlobe. Any thought of reconciliation vanishes. He’s burning from within. What infuriates him the most is how she’s playing him with words, how she doesn’t even seem affected by the conversation, how she’s reminding him he’s the angry one, the uncontrollable male, the one in power, able to do anything he wants. Privileged. He hates how she makes him be what he hates. How she makes him believe it.
“Sherlock. Is. Family.”
Something tells him Sherlock would never do that to any doctor’s office or hospital. It’s a deduction John knows he should be able to justify but doesn’t. Not now. He must stay well away from triggering thoughts. Must remain calm. Must keep Rosie quiet as they wait, even if that’s the last thing he wants. The last thing she needs. Must appear a particular way, must think, must be kind, smile, show excitement to be here. Must. Must. Must.
John had been afraid… afraid Sherlock will take it. Whatever happened. He would take it and still believe he deserved it and still absolve John of all blame and still believe in his ‘noble’ John Watson. John had seen it happen. In his head. Countless times. He had seen it again and again until he was left raw and hurt and empty. John sees it now. He can conjure it up if he wants to. But…
They look at each other and their grins reach their eyes. It’s only a matter of seconds before they start giggling, Rosie chiming in with small bursts of high-pitched laughter. John rests his palm over Sherlock’s elbow, steadying himself as they walk and Sherlock’s blush goes unnoticed as John’s eyes close with his wrinkles gathering at the edges, customary of his continuous chuckling.
“Why won’t you say it already?”
John checks the milk and, satisfied, adds it to the sippy-cup, going round the table and leaning over his little girl, hoping she’ll soon stop crying.
“So… What of the therapist, then?”
“Oh.” Sherlock’s expression shows exactly how much that makes sense and John can’t help but smile with a small shrug.
“It’s just… I’ve been reading on it and childhood trauma… it can be anything, any small detail someone wouldn’t notice, and it might never go away…”
“Johnny... please, listen”
For once, John doesn’t doubt him. Doesn’t demand why. He stares at him, boring into his eyes so hard Sherlock could topple over. But he holds his ground, not knowing what it is John is seeing, John is taking, but giving and giving and giving it, for as long as John needs. Then he smiles. A small smile, but it’s there. Sherlock smiles back, and he can breathe again.
“You’re Rosie’s father. It’s your right to choose who you let into your daughter’s life”
“Actually...” John settles back, swallowing a mouthful of egg and toast, taking a split-second decision he’d been meaning to for days. “I have some news.”
Sherlock tried to keep things as they were between them, letting John’s small confessions to him be the only change. He did not want to press, overstep, do something Not Good,
Sherlock stops holding him.
“John, I-“
fine.
He is tempted to sneak downstairs in Hudders’ kitchen and rummage for something of the sort but knows it’s a bad idea. It could offset him. And his body would be unable to handle another relapse.
She kicks a little, and he can see the tears beginning to build up, her eyes glassing over, and any belief in him that he can do this, fades. Desperately, he does the only thing that has never failed before; presses their noses together. “Boop”
“It is?”
Still, this presence of John has left behind an imprint Sherlock can’t fill. He almost did not want to see him leave for work, despite the fact that it meant his time with Honeybee would then begin. He can’t help but anticipate him. Clinging to it, to the wait to see John at the door again as if he were returning home -had he not said so, that Honeybee had found a more permanent home? Perhaps John could feel the same too- kept the endless droning on of his mind at bay, helped him stay afloat. It also makes him restless.
John can’t take this. He can’t and he knows it and he doesn’t have a choice. But he knows he’ll snap if he can’t have one moment to himself. He knows his mind will be run over so much that he might lose it and let her fall down and he can’t bare it, not even the slightest possibility of it. Of hurting her. He’s overwhelmed. He needs a break.
“Yes. Yes, I do.” He sighs, looks at his shuffling feet.
He starts to sing her a small made-up song about the tiger pirates she usually likes. It’s a good sign her eyes are not clouded over anymore and she’s not too tired even if still recovering. He hears a small grumble in his neck where she’s nestled and realises she’s asleep again already. He stifles a hopeful laugh and waits until the thermometer beeps.
“John, backtracking can happen with any mental illness, no matter what help one gets, right?”
“Um. Brought tea”, Sherlock raises the cup a little. The fingers holding it are numb and throbbing with heat.
John exhales. Sherlock is… He is smiling. A sun. A beacon of hope.
Sherlock could only jump. Abandon. Survive.
He felt like an insect, trapped within four walls, aimlessly fluttering from one to the other, smashing against all of them in turn, not giving up until it dropped, exhausted. Dead.
They settle on
. That he is compared with her, and she is found wanting.
Silence.
“Sorry.” An apologetic smile.
They're there. John pulls at his sleeve again, exasperation in his eyes as he urges him on, and they get off, and then there's an escalator, and another, and another queue and scanning and they're out, out, and there's sun and the scent of the earth after the rain and it's vast and open and no hordes can come at him here, they can disperse, and scatter and he can breathe-
. Always.
“Me and Sherlock-”
John steels himself. Feet obsessively steady and slow as he steps up the stairs. The flat is quiet. Yet, he is tense. The impression of a soldier waiting for a grenade explosion. Only he doesn’t run
Sherlock doesn’t answer and John frowns.
“John, I... I do believe repetitions are both needless and tiresome”, Sherlock sighs. There’s something about the way he says it that hurts.
Teeth washed, he dragged himself to bed, crawling under the covers in its middle and curling up. How probable was what was happening to him? One day ago he had thought it was impossible. John was not interested in being his friend again, there was nothing but a burden he could ever be to the other man. And quite rightly so. The last half of the previous year, Sherlock had been banned from John’s life. He was at fault. A vow-breaker. A little more than a month ago he was a liar. A liar worthy of broken ribs and yanked hair, a cracked cheekbone and blooded eye. What had changed? -assuming anything had. And why?
A scoff, bouncing off the walls, piercing John’s ears.
“Bond? Alright, alright, I’ll find something else. Even though, for the record, it’s not one film, and definitely not horrible”
Instead, he resists and aches and sweats, ended up on a feast of sweet food. Biscuits, cake, scones, chocolate. It hasn’t really helped but… in a way, it has. John grips the sink hard.
“Eight”
Sherlock blinks.
to me. I was fine. I
“Talk me through it”
*drumroll*
John stops only a step away from him. His eyes are storm-set seas, his face lined and lined.
“Didn’t have much to do. Take your pick.” The hiss of the hard brush against hollow metal continues.
“Yeah, don’t do that”, John shakes his head. His lips are slanted into a fed-up grin.
He hops down the stairs, elated, after settling her in for sleep, wrapped up warm in blankets and safe with her plushies. He’s sure she’s having wonderful dreams and he can’t wait to tell Sherlock when-
“I would keep this one.”
He tries to contain the joy residing and growing from his chest cavity, making all his limbs tingle in appreciation of such a feeling. If he closes his eyes he can feel seven years younger, can see the incoming text on his phone while he sits on his miserable bedsit, barging in whether convenient or not, changing his life with bright iridescent eyes looking right through him and seeing him all the same. His thumb presses the text clumsily.
Taking stock. Protecting, in that subtle but ever-present way. To be seen, to be included… After he got used to having John’s attention, Sherlock felt alive every time it happened.

Hudders purses her lips to a thin line, the vertical lines around it deep, and black, and spidery.
He’s not going to look up. He’s only looking inwards. Trying to. The words are choking in his throat.
John smiles as his fingers reach and brush through lush curls, from Sherlock’s temple to the back of his ear, settling a stray tuft back in place, brushing over Sherlock’s scalp. Over a tender patch of skin; bare. A scar. Causing an imperceptible shiver to rush down Sherlock’s spine.
“Done with that.” She has already reached back to her desk and scribbled something down, a reminder maybe, because she doesn’t extend the paper to them. “So, your main reason for visiting me, however, is that her late-talking is connected to her psychology?”
“I just want to be sure you… You have what you need. To heal”
(See the end of the chapter for
Are they so past it? Past the point of no return…
‘Don’t. He’s not you. You’re just me’.
No reply.
There’s a grumble under the table as John tries to find it among the chaos that always is Honeybee’s belongings.
One obvious conclusion.
He sets his phone down to the sound of the front door opening and closing with a thud. His ears perk up. Mrs. Hudson wasn’t out, and she wouldn’t go out. Unless she made plans, but no, this is not the way she closes the door behind her. Then the footfalls on the stairs follow, and he has shot upright, pulling his dressing gown on.
“Doesn’t it?”
His phone buzzes. His fingers are itchy; it has not done so for a while. With a glance to make sure Honeybee is okay in her baby park and will most probably not need his attention for a little while, he retrieves the device from the pocket of his dressing gown, passes it from shaky left hand to impatient right one.
“Not here to judge you, John, as always.” she smiles. “I know you’re at a point where you can manage this on your own.”
Sherlock watches Honeybee play as he waits for him.
An image of bloody pavement appears and John is taken by impulse. Physical impulse. Heartfelt. Impulse that has him reach. Reach a hand. He cannot fight it, of course not. He cannot resist it. He can’t allow uncertainty and fear to push him to assumptions. He needs to- to…
As the kettle was flicked on, Sherlock’s eyes took in the table; two jam jars, bread, butter, the plates set out. Bee was pretending to ignore the grown-ups, but when her gaze locked with Sherlock’s she would give an adorable little pout. Oh. She was sulking. He’d have to fix that, when her father went to work. Until then, realizing there were plenty of things left for him to do, he began to butter a slice of bread.
“Sorry, sorry.” John rushes, palms up and hands beside his head in a placating action. He’s lost his breath. His mind is repeating the flinching image again and again. He takes a shaky breath and points at Sherlock’s head. “Just- temperature.”
‘For fuck’s sake, why can’t you just be
Keep away, all the signs said. And so Sherlock did. And then this. What happened this morning.
Sherlock’s chest warms up.
“This is our better, then”
John hums, unable to reply. Unwilling to explain. It’s all a giant mess after all.
memories
“So… What do you think?”
The smile that blooms across Sherlock’s face is soft and easy. He nods. John grins in reply. “Unless you’re sleepy”, he adds.
Sherlock does not know if he did good, or not-good. He does not know what else to do, what else he should have done. The overwhelming urge to close and lock all doors, black out all windows, create a cocoon of the warm, familiar darkness of 221B, of what 221B used to be, preserve whatever traces of the past he can find, is consuming him. But the traces are rusty and unreliable. Over five years old. Memories blurry and black-rimmed at the edges.
John has asked him to hold her
‘You berk.’
At the hall, one can hear the ventilator bursting little gusts of air into the building. Greg stands firm, eyeing John up and down, carefree composure gone. Discarded for a much more serious, calculating stance. John fidgets, one leg to another and back again. Weight distribution. Alleviates tension. After all, one of the last conversations he has had with
He crawls onto his bed numbly and curls up, arms and legs tucked into a ball as small as he can get it.
. They need to talk.
John had turned around sharply, and Sherlock’s eyes fluttered away, away from the frightened pools trembling still.
“Walk me through what you feel about it.”
And John doesn’t know. Can’t know.
He has not been bored all this while. On the one hand, he was hardly at a state where he could think logically, let alone productively. His mind was swamp-dark, and without his Mind Palace, without a way for storing and retrieving information, there was no joy in the thought of using it anymore either. On the other hand, Honeybee’s care is a responsibility and privilege he is grateful to have. If he was made to choose between her and a crime scene, there is no doubt in his mind about which he’d pick. She is fascinating, and clever, and precious, and Sherlock has already lost too much of her life, too many moments, too many smiles. Then, whatever time was left, it was all devoted to John. There are no regrets about that, either.
“So do you”
“I will see you tomorrow?” It was the only thing Sherlock could find to say that would not trivialise or exaggerate the situation. The only way he could find to keep John with him for a little longer, to catch his gaze in his, offer what solace he could, if he could.
“It is just… Not fair, is all”, John exhales. Slowly.
“I know… I know you’ve said that romantic entanglement is not for you. And I respect that. I do. And I also know that… there’s… Things I’ve done that will never,
“I did not want to-“, he started. His voice was gravelly, but clearing it more only gave a layer of coppery tang to the back of his tongue. “-Trouble you. Or miss breakfast”
Sherlock eyes shift from mug to mug, from teaspoon to teaspoon. He shakes his head to a courteous nod. John doesn’t mind. He doesn’t want to breech the subject either. He pops his shoulder and goes on to bring them biscuits and scones and jam and butter. It’s a sweet breakfast today. He will make sure Sherlock eats something salty later. A ham and cheese melt toastie maybe? They’ve bought a grill he can make it in.
“Yes. I know.” John’s eyes sparkle with fondness at Sherlock’s matter-of-fact tone of pure belief in him. “Ella is no expert on that field but she suggested going to a child and speech therapist if it would make me feel more at ease. That way we can also be sure...”
John surveys the room. Indeed, there are scattered toys everywhere and the floors are made of polished wood, easy to clean and efficient. Easy to evaluate too, for any mistrustful parent.
He didn’t love her.
“I don’t want to see either of you getting hurt again.”
“No. I am not.” Sherlock repeats for the third time, steady as ever.
The cases he and John had solved together that required them leaving Baker Street to stay someplace else overnight were only a handful. But each and every one, Sherlock would find himself falling asleep by counting John’s even breaths. It never failed to persuade his mind to rest, truly rest. But now the time and place don’t match his memories. His eyes finally agree to open, and at once go to the watch on his left wrist. No, it’s all the same; he’s
It turned out that nothing changed, and yet, at the same time, everything changed.
“Good.”
He hears it though. The screams. The terror in the deep baritone voice. His name. The relief. And again. ‘No, no, no, not again, not again, please, I don’t- I don’t want to again!’ he pleads and struggles but the streetlights can’t keep him close to reality enough for him to take control. Hands on his head, blocking his ears shut, he has to slow down. He’s shifting and struggling but he can’t move, can’t speak, can’t reassure or scream back. It’s distorted, and his eyes are wide as the fire builds and consumes him and a tall figure falls into it with intent, unwavering. Wanting to burn, to sacrifice its own self in order to save... save John from under the logs of the torturing campfire, from under the void...
Let's just call ourselves out for a minute. Hereby declare us both guilty of watching that TLD scene we shall not name for science during the creation of this chapter. It's like the a hundredth time maybe? Pfft...
He stops five steps from the landing. His eyes lock with a tall figure, waiting in the darkness of their stairs and corridor. John pauses, breathless. Sherlock is there, perched on the railing, waiting eagerly, worried instantly by his pause most probably. John’s eyes adjust to the semi-darkness quickly. It wasn’t much different in the room upstairs. Sherlock is looking straight at him, swaying on his toes, fingers on his lips, aching for the news.
Sherlock doubts John catches how he faltered, there. He is looking at his hands instead, right wringing the left over and over. The atmosphere has grown more serious, as if John’s bent head has been gathering storm-clouds. But as soon as Sherlock is about to sit up and give in to his instinct to worry, John looks up again, and the skies clear.
They got back to 221B after that. Him and Rosie. Moved in. Needless hassle. Sherlock let them move back in, actually. John doesn’t even remember the look on his face when he showed up with the pushchair and the boxes. He was ashamed, looking at his feet. What an idiot. Coward.
Everything? Together? Friends? Whatever way Sherlock wants them to be? He doesn’t know. He doesn’t even know if Sherlock will understand his meaning completely, but he wants to try. Deep down he always wanted. He wants Sherlock to know him. To have him. He’s got a second chance. He’s not screwing it up.
“Could we talk about this?”
No. They are looking back now and John wants to turn away. But no. Invisible hands make him stand there. Above the fallen figure and look. Look. Truly look. He struggles to fight them off and his breaths are ragged but he can’t move. Not pavement. Not a roof. Just a morgue. Just a floor.
What does it matter, if sticks are all he has? There is no question to what he will do. There never was.
She nods. That’s why it was different. John’s mind strains to process it. That’s why he felt totally lost. Like her. She was actively protesting, putting her foot forward and telling him ‘no’, instead of whining, reluctant or staying utterly and unambiguously silent, closing off.
“So, you have my answer, I presume?”
Sherlock’s throat working around a swallow.
He has startled her to silence. When she returns her tone is full of confrontation and irony, laced with danger, fuelled with hatred.
Sherlock is looking at him. Just looking. Staying. Staying.
“Thank you”
‘Do you
like that.
A boulder to lean against, to take refuge beside. That’s what he wants to be; the shadow of the boulder than makes John feel safe.
“Great”, John had breathed. He had stepped over the mess and bent down to coax Honeybee from her hiding spot, like plucking a kitten up from a bush. She had been swiftly strapped back in her baby chair, which John pushed to the side of his armchair, safely away. “Why can’t you just stay in one place for a while?”. It had been almost ironic in the small huffed breath that followed it. Louder than it should have been.
Always more than a landlady, more than a simple owner of the flat he used to be allowed to call ‘home’, more than a housekeeper, always more
He gets shouted at.
But even if there will be a smile, it will be on a different face. There will be no more cases together, or 'us against the rest of the world'. There will be a baby to take care of. John will be grieving. The things that happened will not be undone.
“Been here before?” John is still a little out of breath.
about what people
“Everything alright?” John repeats.
“Of course you did”. He has stopped looking at her and has focused on Rosie once again, praising her with more kisses when she goes for another big mouthful -her cheeks puffing out like that of a chipmunk- before she swallows.
Rosie had wailed when her father had stepped away without another word. John had ignored her, kneeling down to pick up shards and breakfast and cutlery. The wind through the leaves growing, sharpening. It wouldn’t stop. It stirred into Honeybee’s belly with painful tingles -Sherlock knew the feeling-, made her coil into herself and wail louder. John’s had knelt down, picking the tablecloth up as one big bundle, and placing it back on the table again. Every wail had made him wince as if it was a physical blow. And then, as he had begun to pick up the rest of the broken pieces of plate and glass and mug from the floor and throw them in the sink, the wincing turned into murmurs and growls, drowned exclamations and hissed curses.
He wonders if John remembers these times, too. And what he thinks about them, if he does.
“She’s babbling again”
“She had started babbling away around the expected age. But then she- she stopped.”
There is a knock. He would have missed it was it not for every ounce of his alertness being bent on what could be outside. Sherlock takes the first step down the stairs hesitantly. There comes another knock, louder this time, as if decided. Or perhaps, resigned. It draws him closer.
“Hudders.”
"I could help", he says, and his voice sounds strange to his ears. John's eyes snap to him, finally, not entirely comprehending. Sherlock indicates Rosie with a soft tilt of his head. Willingness expressed, he should now give him a way out of it. A choice. "If you need me to".
“Want to give it a go?”
Ella hums in agreement. “
But what exactly does
She has been brooding all morning. John brushes a stray curl behind her ear and she kicks her little legs excitedly, not rejecting it. ‘Well, that’s progress.’
He shifts her weight to his other hip and lowers her to the carpet. He fetches her toys and stuffed animals from the baby park, and she happily begins to play with her colorful cloth blocks –the ones that have numbers, letters, and cartoon animal faces on their sides. Sherlock sits beside her. Honeybee stacks three blocks, one on top of the other – a little messily- and tries to place another one above them. The small tower topples over. He praises her on her effort, asks her how many she would like to stack, if she is perhaps trying to match them by color. She babbles to him, explaining, points to the numbers and animals she wants in her new tower. Still she doesn’t speak. Not a word.
“Sherlock..?” John’s eyebrows raise. Sherlock huffs, looking down, mouthing at his lower lip with newfound intensity.
“What happened?”
Sherlock strains his neck to look over his shoulder, lips pursed insistently closed. John would think he’d be excited but instead there’s a tiny wrinkle between his light eyebrows.
It hits. It’s there. Staring at him. Yet, his brain keeps telling him it shouldn’t be. Defence mechanisms scream at him. Close the walls, they say. Protect yourself. Break them apart, logic says. Get out. Out.
“Every day. I know how you hate it. But trust me. The next blood results will definitely be rewarding. These oranges were the sweet ones, I promise” John turns from the sink towards him. His voice is how one would coax a scared puppy from under a car. “I even double-checked. Come on. Bottoms up”
“You? Slept well?”
Away.
But for John that’s impossible to believe and has been since forever.
He hums and lifts his head from his phone to meet John’s eyes. Honeybee is asleep, and so Sherlock had not been expecting John to return downstairs, tired as he had been from the day at work and from his appointment. But here he was; and there was a weariness in his features that had not been there for the previous days. Or which he had been hiding; Sherlock is not sure.
John just needed the raft of his better self; chances to be who he truly was, and who he wanted to be. It would work. It could work. In the morning, after their talk, things had been… if not normal, then better. Of course, John had been sick, and his body was worn with hangover, his eyes sunken in his face, the skin of his eyelids bluish as if beaten up, his face ashen, thin lips a pale line. But they had eaten lunch together, leftover chicken and rice, sticky and too-hot from the microwave. They sat side by side, and for once, Sherlock did not feel that shame-hot need to talk, to cover that chasm between them; John did not pity him. He was not expecting anything from him. He just wanted to be able to be John again, and Sherlock only had to let him. And he would. Of course he would. Somehow, just when he’d thought all was lost, he had a use again. Not only was John not pitying him, but Sherlock could be
But the door has been closed in numerous occasions by now. Leaving John to stare at it aimlessly for hours. Its meaning never crossing his mind.
He wants to say it, to tease him, to joke, fall back into their playful banter of the first years, the first oh so perfect moments of their ‘association’ as he liked to call it in his own writing. For him, as he quite realises now, better than he did before, it was affection he was trying to mask under the formal title. Love. His knees creak when he gets up to gather the shopping back to a decent state.
But apparently there are so many worse things he is entitled to do…
doesn’t, for one.
‘There will always be a gap’
Sherlock meets his gaze. His iridescent eyes emanating worry and encouragement both.
Was this what the loss cost Sherlock? The loss of their balance? The loss of John? Was there -maybe- a last twinkling hope holding it all together? Or was it -for the most part- acceptance of loneliness? Acceptance of the end? The end of the joint lives of these two men?
“Yes, of course. John, your relationship was going to be a work in progress since the beginning. That’s fatherhood. It’s important that you want to make it better and it is very good that you’ve thought of this already and have been working to achieve it.”
The tone is determined. Sober. John’s eyes snap, look away, then slide back again. He knows what’s coming. It’s only logical.
Perhaps, even
“It’s my pills.”
“There he is. You two have a lovely day, mm?”, John coos to his daughter, before leaving her in her baby park -which has taken up permanent residence beside the desk and is flooded with toys and stuffed animals. Sherlock bites his lip, tries not to smile too much, not seem over-eager. John pulls his jacket on. Sherlock is looking down at his hands.
I’m delighted to announce that after an incredibly long and highly collaborative editing process, this monster of a chapter that we eventually divided in parts (stay tuned for ch.6 next week) is R E A D Y!!!!
The voice does not return.
John serves the dinner in the living room, guessing Sherlock wouldn’t want to move at all from his duty -and he was right- and so they eat in silence, counting Rosie’s small even breaths. There is a whizzing sound coming from her nose now and then and John wakes her a couple of times to clean her up a bit. She catches on with his attempts to teach her how to push air out of her nose to clean it when she feels a bit better, at which point they check her temperature again.
“Sherlock” It is guttural, drawled. A warning, but without a sting at its tail.
He doesn’t remove his hand. It seems permanently glued there, on Sherlock warm and now flushing nape. Flushing? A moment passes.
John shakes his head, and Sherlock can see a self-mocking grimace of a smile ghosting over his lips.
How had it been for John?
“What…” Sherlock frowns, appearing to be choosing his words carefully. John licks his lip. “What you did… it was good.”
It’s affecting her. She could never stomach his reputation and any thought of being under scrutiny by anyone at all, let alone the great Sherlock Holmes. It unnerves her. John sees it in her clammy palms, pressed together over her lap, a nervous tick they both had adopted from their mother at a young age. She knows she’s losing ground. She knows John is not leaving. Never again.
He had reached Honeybee’s side. Her cheeks had been blotched with red, her curls bouncing wild on her head. He had stood frozen with the rage that burned a few feet away, scorching everything in its vicinity. A knot had climbed from his stomach to his chest.
Sherlock looks at him. And when he overcomes the surprise at being interrupted, he truly looks; looks at the way his left hand twitches, how his jaw is clenched, his eyebrows drawn together.
Sherlock blinked at him in confusion. John caring was not new; all these days John had been caring for him indeed. But it had been distant. Not in a negative way; in a neutral way. Sherlock did not doubt the noble drive behind John’s actions but saw them as just a natural part of who John was. Ever the good doctor, trying to find his footing, do the right thing. It had nothing personal to do with Sherlock. Sherlock encouraged it anyway, encouraged John’s confidence, no matter how little it did to quench the need inside him, the need he couldn’t stifle. This, however, was
Just as he had begun to retreat, John turned to face him again. His features had set. “Sod this”, he breathed. The fine hair on Sherlock’s arms rose.
“Maybe because of what my hell of a sister said?” A shrug. He can’t really know, as he didn’t know back then… as he’ll never know… But it doesn’t matter, right? Sherlock said he’s not leaving. He said it… He… He promised?
A deep breath.
And then this happens, and her sodding know-it-all fuckery, and-“ John sighs, his eyebrows knitting together. “Because she has no right to do that. I’m not… I’m not who she thinks I am, okay? I’m not like-“ He stops, realizing maybe he has said too much. Sherlock pushes back a chair and sits, palms cupping each other over the table. Who is John afraid of being like?
“John…?”
John follows him, letting Sherlock have some time to himself.
Sherlock’s eyebrows dance at the little wobble in John’s voice.
He can see him now. A faint darker shadow, curls highlighted by a thread of light escaping between the curtains behind him. John offers a glass and Sherlock takes it, eyes more used to the dark than John’s. He keeps a nightlight in his room upstairs for Rosie and has the heavier curtains always drawn open, not to mention Sherlock’s some years younger advantage and constant training to spot everything he ever needed in the dark.
(See the end of the chapter for
John startles.
“Yeah”
He remembers standing. Rigid. His old cane in hand. He remembers Sherlock. The bruises he had inflicted. He could see them, count Sherlock’s ribs under the hospital gown and guess exactly where they were by the way he breathed. His chest, weak and thinner than ever, trembling or stopping whenever encountering pain. The changes so abrupt, one could wonder if Sherlock needed life-support. John had watched him. Endless time stretching above them. Begging, hoping he wouldn’t have to leave. Ever again. But knowing he should. Convincing himself he should.
Surprisingly, they both look up from their plates at the same time, both thinking about little rose, peaceful in her cot. John smiles and gets blinded. Because Sherlock’s answering smile is small but powerful. Bright like the sun. Or as he would say if ever commented upon:
“A leaf. In your hair” John smiles, Sherlock is not sure what for. “Must have stuck when… Oh well. Don’t move. Here. Let me”
‘People are stupid’.
Sleep refused to be of assistance that night. Sherlock lay on his back, his hands collected over the hollow valley beneath his diaphragm. His chest was first heaving, unevenly, like a bird’s wing beating viciously against the wind. Then it eased into the low sighs of full-bellied waves. And last it was barely moving at all, and quivering.
“What did she say?”
He just shrugs but he does feel better. Masking it is one of his defend mechanisms. Afraid the world will see he is starting on a better road and crush him. Because that’s what fate does. That’s what the world is. Unfair. Cruel. Lurking.
“There’s definitely more vitamin C to be had from tablets. I can prove it”, Sherlock whines. It’s before he can wonder how he would do that, since there is no trace of his old equipment left in 221B.
Slow.
“Sherlock? Was that the bell?”, John calls.
“Shh-shhh… shhh…” He tries to calm his shaky reassurances, focus on his breathing but it’s too tight, too hot in here.
“Yeah, and they’re rubbish” God, is he whining?
Ah. John’s gaze falls to his clenched hand. He forces it to flex, with even more tension than when he’d held it into a fist. Sherlock waits.
“Yes, sorry, yeah. Ta so much, Ella.” He already misses the sight of the two people he loves most in the world. He scans the window in front of him. Maybe a reflection…
“You and your big brain”, John repeats, chuckling. “I only meant that whatever you need… I will help with. If I can, however I can” He smiles reluctantly.
“Yes, John, of course.” Sherlock eyes him, taking a deep breath. “Startled, is all.” He mumbles.
Thaaaanks for reading
The sharply cold edge in his voice catches even him by surprise.
Sherlock puts a cup of coffee in his hand. Takes a step back.
“I will if I have to”
He is swimming, kicking, pushing his body forward, he is jolting half-awake, and the light that assaults his eyelids makes him want to close them again, even though where he will go the struggle will melt his muscles into pain and acid.
“You?”
Sherlock nods. Silence envelops them once again. The tension is evaporating, even though Sherlock knows John’s negative thoughts will not disperse quite as easily. He wants to say a lot of things about that. About how John is so, so much better than his sister gives him credit for, that she is outright wrong, of course. But he knows pressing John into anything doesn’t work.
"Um... Top cupboard to the left".
! Sherlock, who let his chances pass by one after the other and doesn’t care. Sherlock, who is meticulously stubborn on not having any emotionally charged human contact at all. Frankly, John was sick of this. He couldn’t let him do that anymore. So, he told him so. Multiple times. The damned genius just wouldn’t listen.
Talk, then. That’s what they’ll do. Just talk. Nothing unusual. Not for them. Not for the ‘real’ them.
“Will you… Please tell me what you want? You won’t be pressuring me by expressing it, I am just not… Um… If you will be relying on me to discern some nonverbal, nonexplicit cue, I won’t, so… I do not want communication to go awry because of me”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes. Just ah-… Are you- are you okay? Hearing all this?”
“Yes.”
John glances up, mouth agape a little, which leads in a muffled yawn. A snorted little chuckle follows. “Ah. Right. Hair”, John points to his own hair for emphasis.
He is…. Fussing. John is fussing over him. Like a…
“Most certainly.” John smiles and moves the eggs around. Scramble-scramble and flip. Scramble and flip. “In fact, I think we should give her a good bath a little while after her breakfast.”
“Not in need of a case so soon, surely?”
“Ah, the fever’s down. Looks like all’s well”
John should have respected Sherlock’s space. He won’t make the same mistake again. He also left Rosie to sleep alone. Not that it was too unusual for a toddler of her age but John hadn’t done so for more than a month. It spiked his insecurities just enough.
“We can run some. Just in case. I’ll prescribe the tests to you and refer you to a trustworthy clinic.” She tilts her head, waiting for confirmation.
The bearing is hunched now, the stride impatient, the breaths shallow. John is heaving at the door, left hand clenched into a stone-like fist, lips drawn inwards, sternly pursed, jaw muscles bulging and disappearing like bubbles poking at the surface.
Sherlock starts to slump in his arms, knees weak. John quickly guides him to a chair.
John’s lips break into pieces.
“What for?”
Sherlock's next breath dissipates.
This is so familiar he doesn’t know if he should laugh or cry.
He sits on his armchair -is it still his?- and waits with a mug of milk warming his shaky palms. He’s not hangover. Not today. But they’ll shake for a while. He purses his lips in contemplation. He doesn’t like it. One more thing he has to change.
‘Fu-‘
He has bled, and bled, and yet for it he will bleed until there is nothing left of him.
“Of course”
“No. You don’t” The words are soft this time.
Sherlock sounded… ‘A tad cross?’
Sherlock looks up from the kitchen table, where he is gathering Rosie’s spoon and two bowls into a small heap.
Her sing-song voice drills through his brain and makes him see stars. He stops walking. Let’s the rain seep into his clothes. His nape of neck wet.
When she does, she breaks in a shy smile. And what he does is smile more widely for her, reflecting her expression like clearwater, magnifying it. It does not feel quite as strange a thing, now. Smiling. Not that it was difficult with Honeybee. But now his face feels chiseled into his laughter lines, and the transition does not come with the pain of the thorn in his side, that thorn that reminds him just how much he does not normally smile.
Something like ‘oh hush, your father needs—yes, I’ll find the bee alright, let’s—’ following. John turns it off and leaves in on his bedside again.
Not enough. Never enough.
“That’s it!”, he whispers, eyes wide like a child’s faced with a present.
“John, it’s alright to let this go. Whatever it is.” A smooth tone. Not the one he wants, needs to hear. The deep baritone one he longs for…
Yet again.
By some stupid trick of evil fate, orange juice is one of the few things that does not upset or offset Sherlock’s stomach, unlike the much-hated pills and tablets, and as such is one of the things John has been insisting on having him drink every morning.
John flinches and screws his eyes shut, the upper and lower lids meshed in a riverbed of wrinkles and lines and blue circles.
He looks at his phone screen, divided. It has to happen at some point. He can’t keep his phone on silent indefinitely. Sherlock might need him. Rosie might need him. Mrs Hudson- The screen lights up. ‘Fuck.’ He answers.
John had spoken as if his addiction was his fault and he could actually control it, its difficulties and outbrusts, as if he were to blame for the darkness he faced, as if his presence was a burden. And Sherlock wouldn’t have that. No bloody way.
Sherlock stands, on careful feet, without making a sound. The tremor of his left hand he hides with disgust in the pocket of his dressing gown.
“I want to take care of you. If you… If you’ll let me”
“Thanks.”
Rosie blinks at him and then tugs at the lapels of his nightgown, pointing at her pink elephant -perched on the back of his armchair, over his shoulder- with a whine. Slow at first, his hands clumsy, he gives it to her, watches as she clutches it tight. Said elephant is almost anatomically correct -if tusk-less, cartoon-like and pink. It normally decorates her bed -John must have forgotten it here last night. Sherlock wonders if she has named it, and how, and whether she tells it, in her way, babbling like an impatient warbling bee, what she sees trough her eyes.
He ignores the so real, so tender voice in his head and rushes to kneel by his Honeybee, taking her tiny palms in his. That’s it! She is it! Her speech! Her fricatives, vowels, obstruents, approximants. The pattern to her syllables, their frequency, transitional probability!
It’s John through and through, seething, more beneath the surface than over it. And yet it’s rough and undefined all over. A molten mass. Sherlock dislikes it at once, what has John feeling like this. What stands between John and his daughter, John and his recovery.
How to interpret that could have been easy, if the other mistake wasn’t made. The other…
"Hello, Rosie", he murmurs, keeping his voice low. "Long time no see...". She giggles, and pats his cheeks with her palms, before she gives him a loud, childish kiss on the chin, mwah sound and all. It makes him smile. "How are you? Hmm?" She looks at him and pouts even more before hugging his neck tight with a whine. Long fingers trembling, he presses her closer.
“Sod. Off.”
John’s hands trail upwards again, and Sherlock can feel a palm hovering over his hair. “May I?”
“We’re here. She’s alright, she’s here, see?” He reassures. Simple and to the point.
him. Friendship is not such a big compromise after all: it’s what John has given him before, it’s something given to him in place of nothing. No. It’s not a compromise. It is a gift, and he
He waits. If John wanted to avoid him he would hear the creak of the second flight of stairs -as John would make his way to Honeybee. And Sherlock wouldn’t care. As long as John was home, he wouldn’t care; it’s been hours, stretching over him, each a dark-feathered crow, a cacophonous addition to the whirlpool his mind has become. At least John will be
“Well, why is that a problem?”
John fights the urge to squeal. He doesn’t care. He doesn’t know. There’s only one thing he wants to scream out loud and he has to fight it.
“Sherlock?” His hand hovers over Sherlock’s cheek. He doesn’t think his voice is even audible but he’s leaning close to Sherlock’s face, making sure to disturb his field of vision. “Sherlock, I need you to sit up for me, could you do that?”
Be someone Sherlock might actually deserve at some point even when the possibilities are non-existent.
“Please, we’ve… We’ve resolved all that, now” Sherlock’s voice is kind, almost coaxing. As John would sound himself when trying to appease a Sherlock that was being particularly stubborn.
The flashes under his eyelids slowly come to a stop and he can finally smell the faint scent of brewing bitter lemon tea and honey. All scents of home. Familiar. Safe. He’s home. ‘How did I get here?’ On the couch, he feels. The leather scratching his nape, sticking to his skin with all the sweat. He’s sweating. Too much. He doesn’t want to try and remember last night, lest all the hell comes back. It will be something embarrassing anyway.
He bent to pick her up, and she flung herself to him, little arms and legs seeking to wrap around him, her face and sniffles buried in his neck. He rubbed a palm soothingly over her back. “It’s okay, Rosie… It’s okay… It’s okay…”
He decides to wrap John with the blanket that is usually folded at the back of his red armchair, and then places a pillow -the Union Jack pillow- beneath John’s head, too. All he has to go on is instinct. Guesswork. John mumbles at being moved.
They stop at an intersection, John pursing his lips in thought, looking over the street names.
“I didn’t… ah… Overstep or… or anything?”
And that is why the contact is there, John’s hug, his hand on his hand, his nape, his chin, his hair, removing the leaf, the small, stray leaf, brown and bewitching. Because it is not about
‘I won’t. I can’t.’
The thoughts won’t
a moment. I need a moment. Just a moment”.
“God, sweetheart, please.” John tries in a mumbled whisper.
“I’m… I’m so sorry…” He’s embarrassed.
But he was wrong.
The indigo eyes waver as they look at him, two glassy mirrors of his own. They mellow the tide in him, ease the cacophony of confusion. They’re the focal point. And he wants everything they would ever wish to give him.
“Feeling better?”
“Look!” Sherlock panted and pointed at Rosie’s penguin on the floor.
“I’ll be alright”
“I only wanted to... To make up for this bloody mess”, he continues, before Sherlock can chime in. “To try, anyway. Because what I said -what I told you- I meant it. I care. I want to. I want to care. Like… Remember?” and he smiles more, feels his very heart wanting to pour into his face, his words, his hands. Because why not? Because why couldn’t they have this? Make this real? Naïve and cheesy, yeah, of course, but… “But I....I make a shitshow out of showing it -repeatedly- so I guess there’s no point. It would truly be better if... If I-”
“It’s okay. It’s me, it’s me, little love. It’s okay. It’s going to be okay”
I understand now, John. I’m sorry.
They are breathing in sync. The water shifts under John’s scalp. He dares a glance sideways. Sherlock has untangled from his tight ball into a more agreeable position, taking up some more inches of space; more to the normal scale for a person of his height.
“S-sneezing. No coughing, so far”
John fixes his gaze on his hand on the table, a few inches away from Sherlock’s, debating.
But he was asked to decide, wasn’t he? To say how he wanted
Sherlock takes in the press of the warm, calloused palm, its roughened skin. He wonders if John can feel it, every shiver, every moment Sherlock ached for this and thought he would never have it. “Yes” John’s thumb strokes over his stubble, scratching just that little bit.
“Sherlock you... You can’t possibly be serious”.
John’s fist clenches around the sink’s rim. “Livid. Totally livid”
He ends up waiting behind the door. He did attempt the alternatives; paced the corridor until his vision blacked out, settled into his armchair until stillness turned eerie and the silence weighing down on him nearly crushed his sternum. Well, he did not have that many alternatives, after all. 5.52 am, according to the watch on his wrist. Sherlock tries to count the seconds. At first it is soothing, something simple enough to do but needing enough of his mind to keep him busy.
It’s like missing a beat.
John does not take long to join them. “Look what I have, Rosie! That should make you feel better in no time!”, he exclaims, presenting her with her washed clean pink elephant. At once she whines in recognition and tries to stand on Sherlock’s chest to reach for it, until her father hands it to her with a kiss. “There”
John freezes. Sherlock’s words come from somewhere far away. As if trapped in another dimension of this god-forsaken universe. Is he blaming himself for Harry’s outburst? Or is it something else? John comes to kneel in front of him on the floor.
He knows bits and pieces from random conversations of course, but there were mostly about past cases, no clues on how Sherlock lived back then. What brought him to want to move at that particular time, for example? Besides, it would be impossible for John to remember them all. A plus would be that John has met Sherlock’s immediate family. Most people haven’t. But still… He didn’t even know his birthday up to a month ago.
He shoves his keys in his pocket, his wallet, and phone. Pauses. There is one more thing he has to do.
He feels Sherlock take a shaky breath. John pulls back enough to look at him, truly look. Sherlock casts his gaze low, hiding its light away. ‘No…’ Two fingers under his chin and he guides him to bloom again, to let the bright skies of his eyes free.
The moment of clarity passes and John breathes, reining it all in, keeping the guilt inside once more, saving it for later where he could ruminate at peace, resolve it in his seminar today afternoon. Now it is time for joy, even if he is feeling quite sappy at the same time. He raises his thumbs and types, slow and careful, auto-correct and word-suggestion set to “ON” of course.
Heat. Sun. Guns. A gun. He’s at the bottom and he can’t move again. A gun is pointed right at him. A bride on the other side of it. Smiling. Long, messy, yellow -almost white- hair framing the wicked face. A flash. A transformation. The dress now black. Every bit of skin covered, hair hidden.
Please consider leaving us a comment, darlings, we would really appreciate it, and we love seeing your thoughts and interacting with you! ^^
John looks at his screen for a minute or two before buzzing the next patient in. He stays efficient and focused until he bids them goodbye too and then he scrambles for his phone.
Sherlock aches. He aches for her to have that. And he longs he could share his love for her too, with someone who could multiply it, someone who already felt it. He wants to boast about her, to praise her in the company of someone who will agree with the praise, to talk about how incredible she is with someone who sees her as a wonder too. He wants to be allowed to do that, to be recognized as able to do that, as worthy enough to do that. It’s funny how both joy and pain are difficult to carry alone.
John’s breath catches with the accusation in Sherlock’s voice.
Don’t see it. Don’t talk about it. And it won’t exist.
(now's the time for that tag we almost forgot!)
“No!” It’s strangled.
Their gazes lock and there’s such unchecked sadness in Sherlock’s that John fears he’s going to drown for real this time.
Sherlock shakes his head. John places a glass of water in his fingers.
“But, John-”
Cold. Frozen. John Watson muffles another sob. Rosie still asleep at the cot beside his bed. He knew the next part all too well. The desperation of wanting to feel. To surrender. For someone. Anyone. No. Not really… Not exactly
He ran up stairs. Miles and miles of stairs. Always fixed on one spot. Fire right behind, scorching his feet. Not again. Not again. Not again.
The previous night’s outburst had made him feel transparent, pretentious; he had acted as if he were whole and solid, when in truth under his skin he was only hollow; What else could ever be expecting anyway, so that he had the right to refuse what he was being given? John was not the John he always carried with him, whispering in his ear to lull him to sleep, countless gentle breathings of his name, little moths spun of silence and the night and the raw wound of his heart. John was real, and he was flesh and blood, and he was in pain, with the tide that rises and falls inside him, the failure and the duty. That was the John Sherlock had been called to save. Not the treacherous, smiling voice of his mind.
At least he has kept the leaf. He snatched it from John’s saucer just as they were ready to leave the café. It is in his small pocket of his wallet now, next to the Rizla papers, a tiny lavender sprig, and John’s old, worn photograph. Sherlock had taken it randomly, in the first year they’d met. They were on a terrace in the City, investigating a triple homicide. He had accidentally caught John smiling while taking a photograph of the evidence. The setting sun was bathing John’s face with its lush light, and he was squinting against it, just a little bit, his golden hair windswept. The photograph lived on in his phone until it was printed, a little while before the fall. To travel with him, in an inside pocket against his chest, to beat to the rhythm of a frightened heart on the run.
Sherlock pushed a finger in slowly. John was so incredibly warm. He stretched him slowly before adding a second finger and scissoring them.
Updates are not going to be remotely this frequent, so enjoy it while it lasts. Have I mentioned that I have an extremely short attention span and no free time because of school? Fortunately, I do find the time to role play with reflectiveless, which is how all of these stories came into being. I just need some encouragement to get me to format/edit and upload them. *cough* Comments are very encouraging... *cough*
John gasped. It hurt so very much for such a short time and then it was so wonderful...
call him by his first name?" he demanded suspiciously.
Smaug kissed Bilbo's forehead, "Then I'm yours as well."
Bilbo moaned louder, his head falling back against the wall. He was very hard at this point. He had absolutely no idea when he first entered Erabor that Smaug was
John chuckled. "I'm very glad you did," he said, kissing Sherlock's forehead lovingly.
Sherlock felt his small cat body go limp, did John just...? God, John was getting overly attached to him being a cat; that was the only possible explanation, of course... But it was heaven. His eyes closed for a moment, wishing John was stilling kissing him, even if it was just the top of his head. Perhaps he could take a few liberties himself... He attempted his 'cutest' mewing sound and licked John's nose.
desperately wanted to be inside John already.
Our first (posted) smauglock! If I've forgotten to say this before, the beautiful reflectiveless is generally Sherlock and, in this case, Smaug. I'm John and Bilbo for the most part. Occasionally we switch, but not this time.
"Shall I devour you?" Smaug asked, withdrawing his hand from the thief's trousers and smirking at the whimper the action elicited from his newest treasure. He picked his thief up and carried him off to where he slept at night when in human form. He dropped the burglar onto his bed, quickly ridding him of his clothes as though he was unwrapping a delicious present.
John nuzzled Sherlock's neck. "I suppose we were both just blind idiots." The affectionate nuzzling soon became gentle nips, licks, and kisses. John knew that he would never get bored of this.
Still possessing his senses, Smaug sniffed and smelled an unfamiliar scent. It was similar to dwarf, but not quite the same. He drew closer to the smell, still not seeing his target. "Come out thief or I shall set the whole room on fire," he growled, eyes narrowing.
John's jaw dropped and he crouched down next to the kitten. "Sh-Sherlock, you... You're a cat... Why are you a cat?" His brain was not cooperating, following its own path that disregarded what one should probably think and feel when one's flatmate turns himself into a cat. Sherlock was so small and adorable... He reached out to pet his flatmate's tiny head. He was so soft. "You're so cute." He had the urge to pick up his tiny detective and cuddle him.
"Hey, don't say that!" John commanded. "You are
"You... you do?" Sherlock's eyes widened in shock. How could he? He had given John every reason to hate him. His purring intensified as he pushed closer to John's face and licked his soft fleshy lips. Damn his cat body for not letting him hold John. "I... I love you too John."
Sherlock hesitantly untied him. Logically, he knew John would stay, but his subconscious wasn't too kind to him.
John bit his lip. "I think I'd rather like to see you pleasure yourself..." he admitted shyly.
Smaug hissed; there were far too many tight corners he couldn't access in this monumental form. He drew nearer to where he thought he'd heard the footsteps, shifting his form to a more humanoid shape. "I'll find you, little creature, and when I do, I just might devour you."
Bilbo kissed back. "You would have killed me if you were a monster," he said.
Sherlock groaned. He was so deep inside John... He began thrusting in and out, speeding up as he went.
"Looking at me, thief?" Smaug purred, his eyes glazed over. He was proud that the hobbit was looking at him so keenly. He lightly flicked his tongue over Bilbo's length.
Bilbo ducked behind a column, trying not to panic. Maybe the dragon would just give up if he stayed invisible long enough... He knew that the likelihood of such an occurrence was extremely small, but a small hope was far better than panic and hysteria.
John burst into the bathroom. "Sherlock?" He could not see his flatmate anywhere, but his clothes were in a crumpled heap on the ground. A crumpled... moving... heap. John dug through the pile and found a little black kitten. "Sh-Sherlock?" Oh god.
John winced at the intrusion, but the pain was forgotten as Sherlock said the words John so desperately wanted him to say. "I love you too, Sherlock," he whispered, grinning like a loon.
"You're far more valuable to me then these gold pieces... why is that?" Smaug's brows furrowed. He wasn't a very socialized creature.
"I think I rather like that nickname, Jawn," Sherlock purred against him, trying to suppress his lingering insecurities.
"Mmmm... John... you know... ah... how I am with sentiment...." Sherlock replied.
" He said the last word particularly possessively. "And I don't like you going off with women at night; you've been a very naughty husband, John."
"You've no idea how long I've wanted to say them," John replied. "I didn't because I thought that you would deduce my feelings for you and, since you didn't say or do anything, you didn't feel the same." He did not want to admit out loud how much the possibility of Sherlock rejecting him scared him. John had been rejected and heartbroken before, he could not bear it if Sherlock rejected him too. He loved Sherlock too much.
Smaug rubbed his cheek against Bilbo's hair. "I think I would have given all my gold for you. To think, you merely walked in for me to take. My Bilbo..." Smaug purred sleepily.
Sherlock felt the same twinge of pain as before shoot through him, causing him to arch his back. "Me too..." He sucked in a pained gasp, feeling his limbs weaken. He realized that the chemical could finally be wearing off.
Of course. John really shouldn't be surprised by Sherlock's logic by now. "Why today, Sherlock?" he whispered, sounding defeated. "I've had a crap day and you choose today of all days to do
Sherlock frowned, that was not the response he was hoping for at all. Oh, how he wanted to curl up on John's lap and fall asleep, but "not gay" John would certainly have none of that. Maybe showing concern for John's health the wrong tactic. He would have to reverse things. "But John... it is so very cold... and I..." had his voice just hitched? "That is, we coooould keep each other warm..." His voice grew more nervous as he spoke.
"I love you, my amazing Sherlock," John murmured.
John smiled sleepily, closing his eyes and covering both of them with the blanket. "Goodnight, Sherlock," he mumbled, already half asleep.
John shivered with steadily increasing pleasure. "Need you, 'Lock," he moaned.
A tear fell from John's eye and he held Sherlock closer. "Untie me, love," he murmured gently. "I swear I won't leave. I'll be here with you in the morning and every morning from now on. For the rest of my life, I'll stay with you."
Sherlock's unconscious body let out a light moan of approval, his head naturally seeking out more warmth rested in the crook of John's neck as he occasionally muttered things in his sleep. Sherlock had admittedly dreamed of John before, but it was usually running through the streets of London with him after criminals. Tonight it was how his lips probably tasted of honey and jam. He did not know that his own lips had parted and gently sucked at John's neck.
John shivered. Sherlock was making it hard to think straight. "I... Um... I mean..." He tried to think of a way to talk himself out of the corner he had backed himself into with that stupid slip. "I um..." Was that moaning sound coming from him? His blush deepened.
"You've no idea for how long I've wished you would say those words," Sherlock said, smiling. He had watched John from afar for so long, he did not think this moment would ever be possible, or that he had missed his chance long ago.
Maybe they could stay for a bit... "Oh John... you're so amazing... so perfect." He never wanted to be out of John's embrace again.
John's words went straight to Sherlock's already hard cock. He gently bit John's shoulder as he pressed a finger to his entrance. "Have you done this before?" he asked against John's skin. "With a man instead of a woman?"
. He crouched lower, still just above the creature's height. "And what shall I do with the little thief, I wonder...?" he mused. It had been quite some time since he'd taken a lover and the thief was very aesthetically pleasing... He looked him over again. Yes, he would do nicely.
Sherlock cocked his head. He wanted to know what John was about to say, but he seemed so flustered by his actions... It was too good an opportunity to pass up. He pressed up against John's chest, tail flicking away teasingly as he propped his front up so he could reach John's neck and licked at it. "hmm?"
"He does with Greg," John said. "I've seen Mycroft smile
Sherlock struggled to stand, but his legs wouldn't cooperate, so he helplessly fell over again and again. He finally accepted that he had to be on all fours. Why had everything suddenly seemed so large? "John? What's happening?" His ears went back in agitation.
John chuckled. "I'm well aware, but I'm amazed you're able to deduce anything right now." He glanced pointedly at Sherlock's neglected cock.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. "Why would
following the same path as Sherlock's. "Sherlock!" he cried even louder than before as he came between them, coating both of their stomachs with his seed.
There was no way Sherlock would ever grow tired of snogging John. Just like in his dream, he had a faint, sweet taste like honey. Sherlock's right hand glided down John's chest until it reached his waist, taking John in hand.
"You're perfect," Sherlock sighed happily. He snuggled up against John with a small yawn.
Bilbo smiled, snuggling against the dragon. "You would?" he asked. He'd heard how much dragons loved gold. It was unbelievable that Smaug would willingly part with all the gold of Erabor for a simple hobbit like Bilbo.
John felt his heart beat faster. Sherlock only did that because he was in cat form... Why did John's heart sink at that thought? "Sh-Sherlock I l-" What?! Had he been about to tell Sherlock that he... No... He was not gay! He did not think of Sherlock that way... His mind replayed Irene's words. Maybe... No... His internal protests were getting weaker. Oh hell.
"Y-yes..." Sherlock barely breathed, grabbing John's arm and practically pulling him into John's room. Once inside, he pushed John onto the bed.
Sherlock grinned wide. He loved how John called his name. Removing John's trousers completely, he cocked his head to the side, hands running up John's thighs. "And what is it you would like me to do now?"
Sherlock kissed his inner thigh. "And I you love." He pressed his mouth to the front of John's pants and lightly kissed him before pulling them off. It felt freeing for John to be rid of his pants, though his blush deepened further since he had never expected to be without his pants in front of Sherlock Holmes. Sherlock smiled. John was stunning with a blush. He had been to war, saved lives, killed for Sherlock, but here he was perfect and exposed for him with a blush. "You're incredible and I love you."
John nuzzled against Sherlock's neck. "I'm so glad that you're
looking like it's physically painful."
Sherlock's smile widened. "I'll have to ensure that it was the last time you ever have to make such a mistake, then."
them...
"Why thank you, love," John said, grinning. He closed the door behind them.
Sherlock hummed in agreement, kissing John's chest. "I don't even know why I got in the tub," he admitted after a while. "I suppose I was just tired of not being with you."
John adjusted quickly. "Ahhhh... Sherlock!" How did Sherlock learn this through the internet?
John wished he could kiss away Sherlock's tears, but as he'd already learned, he was unable to move. "I love you more than life itself and I intend to spend the rest of my life with you."
Sherlock bound both of John's ankles to the bed posts with the rope, grinning at how it forced him to spread his legs, which gave him quite a lovely view. John felt himself getting even harder, though he refused to admit how much Sherlock's display of dominance and predatory gaze turned him on. Sherlock ran his hands up John's lean body before grasping his wrists and handcuffing them together. He fastened the handcuffs to the headboard of the bed and admired his handiwork. John whimpered. He was so hard it hurt, but he couldn't do anything to give himself friction. He was completely at Sherlock's mercy.
"Anything."
Sherlock hated when John would leave for
"I'm afraid I might have to at some point, just to see whether or not you're lying."
Sherlock snuggled into him, hiding his face. "It wouldn't be the first time someone did," he mumbled.
mine," he murmured.
John bit back a moan at Sherlock's deeply resonant voice, which had not changed with the rest of him. He obliged, of course, and continued to pet Sherlock. His mind tried to talk him out of it, but his body apparently had no intention of stopping. Before he could stop himself, he had scooped Sherlock up in his hands and brought him up to place a kiss on his head.
"You're gorgeous." Sherlock knew he could never love anyone else, just the incredible man beneath him. He uncapped the bottle and slicked his fingers, gently brushing them against John.
Oh, that was a lovely visual. "Call her the wrong name?" he teased.
"Even like this," John confirmed. He leaned forward and closed the gap between their lips. Sherlock's lips were so soft and wonderful... One of John's hands made its way to the back of Sherlock's head, holding him even closer.
"V-Victor..." Sherlock breathed, his voice unsteady. He hated even thinking of the name. "I know you are aware of some of my past... " John's first day at the flat involved a drug raid, after all. Stupid Gavin... "He was how that came into my life. I spent my trust fund on drugs for us, when the money was gone, so was he."
John grinned and slowly dragged his teeth across the skin of his neck. "You'll always have me there."
John laughed. "Oh this is brilliant! I know something that
"What?" Sherlock gasped in shock. "No... no, that's not possible... I mean, the chemical I injected in me did have some feline DNA... but that shouldn't have..." Sherlock had unconsciously rubbed up against John's hand. "Why does this feel so good?"
"I think I rather like you being needy," Sherlock said with a smirk. He briefly pecked those beautiful lips of John's. "Need you too." He carefully withdrew his fingers and pressed the head of his cock against John's entrance.
Sherlock moaned, his black silken tail pricking up against John's hand. "Seducer you are..." He licked playfully at John's neck and ears.
"I'm making sure you stay the night," Sherlock yawned, referring to the ropes.
John bit back a moan as his blush deepened. He knew Sherlock well enough to know that he was lying, though for the life of him, he couldn't figure out why.
Smaug had been slumbering beneath his gold for quite some time before the soft pitter-patter of tiny (especially when compared to those of a dragon in its full, reptilian form) feet roused him. His eyes snapped open menacingly, recognizing the meaning of the sound immediately. There was a thief in his midst. Silently, he lifted his head out of the gold — well, not quite silently, since there was an audible jingling as gold coins fell from his rising head onto the pile of their brethren — and cast his gaze around for the intruder. "Where are you thief?!" he half-purred, half-growled, his sensuously deep voice reverberating throughout the cavern. There was no response, so he continued. "I can hear you.... smell you... sense the very air you breathe... Come out or I shall incinerate you where you stand."
John bit his lip. Sherlock was enjoying watching him suffer from lack of friction far too much. "Lawk... need you...."
was a delicious sound... Smaug's eyes fluttered shut as he began to suck on the base of his intruder's neck, hoping to leave marks that would signify that this man had been
Oh, those words in that voice were impossibly sexy. "J-John!" he shouted as he came across John's midsection. John came into Sherlock almost immediately after. Sherlock got off him and snuggled up to John's side, kissing his chest. "My John," he sighed. "I love you." John really wished his arms were free so he could hold Sherlock. "I should probably release you now..." Sherlock undid the handcuffs, but left the rope in place.
"Of course I will, love!" Sherlock exclaimed, snogging him.
"Mm, I think I could get rather use to this," Sherlock purred in his deep, resonating voice. He pulled the offending jumper over John's head and flung it to the side, kissing John passionately again. John moaned. Heaven itself could not be more wonderful than this. He worked on removing Sherlock's jacket.
"I would be more concerned if you weren't so cute and fluffy," John replied, "but you're rather distracting." The thought of having Sherlock in his lap as a human crossed his mind and his petting faltered. What?! Why was he thinking things like that? He was not gay!
"SMAUG!" Bilbo cried, coming hard into the dragon's mouth. Smaug drank him down, cleaning him up — chocolate and all — with his tongue. Bilbo panted on the bed. That was without a doubt the best orgasm of his life.
Sherlock's eyes lit up. "Really?" he squeaked, clearing his throat to bring it back down to its regular pitch. "Of course!" He clung to John tightly.
Bilbo froze. Shite, he'd awakened the dragon. He quickly slipped on the ring, vanishing from sight.
"It should seem so." Sherlock gave a low grumble at the excess amount of clothes John was wearing, it was cold... but he was sure he could think of an alternative method for warmth that involved fewer articles of clothing. He began removing John's jumper.
John's heart nearly stopped for a moment. "I'll never leave you, Sherlock," he promised. "Ever. You're finally mine and I've wanted you for so long. I could never leave you even if I tried."
Bilbo's eyes widened as his breath hitched. Surely Smaug meant to actually eat him, not... His eyes wandered down to the dragon's very prominent erection and he let out a small, unintentional moan.
Sherlock felt utterly helpless. "I thought you were suppose to be the level headed one." He tried wiggling free again to no avail. Finally, John's stroking had found a particularly nice spot on him and a low rumble spread through his body from his chest. "Wh-what is that?"
"Yes," John moaned. He had fancied himself in love many times, but he had never loved anyone as wholeheartedly as he loved Sherlock. He knew he would never love anyone else again.
Sherlock moaned, parting his lips for John. "I love you so much."
John's heart began racing as Sherlock came nearer to him. A blush spread on his cheeks. He looked away from his flatmate, trying to calm himself. Sherlock just wanted warmth, he did not want John. John swallowed. "I... um... I should probably... probably be g-going soon..." he said, wishing his voice did not give away his feelings quite so much. However, he made no move to go, instead staying exactly where he was. Any minute now he would get up and go to his room... He could not quite manage to convince himself of this, though...
"Come for me, Sherlock," John purred. He wanted Sherlock to orgasm first.
amusing..." he growled sarcastically. "
John's heart beat faster and he swallowed dryly. "I thought you were married to your work?" he asked.
“But she doesn’t”
John probably came to check on him last night. He must have been exhausted so fell asleep without meaning to.
It must seem weird. Him, asking. He hadn’t asked any of the previous days when he walked in after work.
“You alright, mate?”
“The big ship sails on the ally ally oh, the ally ally oh, the ally ally oh.” John’s raspy voice sounds tender and the tune gets carried through 221B in the quiet hours of a winter London evening. The noise and constant engine hum of the rush-hour gives way to a tentative start of an intense nightlife in particular neighbourhoods while Baker Street itself belongs to the easy and normal closing hours, to Madam Tussauds’ visitors dispersing through the surrounding streets since 4pm, to taxis driving lazily past Speedie’s in an attempt to avoid any late traffic and big roads filled with buses, bursting with people from all ethnicities, looking for potential customers in alleys and late-open pubs.
“You okay? Sherlock? You okay?”
“Oh, thank you”, John’s eyes crinkle at the edges and he presses his lips to little flower’s forehead. “Hello, sweetheart. I missed you” Honeybee reaches for him, and Sherlock waits until John’s hands are free to hold her securely before he lets her clutch onto John’s shirt.
John coughs, trying to get his attention, the remote already in his palm. He waves it towards Sherlock in an exaggerated movement.
“Oh! Nice to meet you, Rosie.”
“I do not care what you did with your ill-behaved relative, John -she was even worse than you two”
John follows with a step of his own a moment later, dragging one of the suitcases behind him. Sherlock holds the door open. Tearing his eyes away from Honeybee is painful, but he does not want to push his luck. John seems oblivious to this, shifting nervously from one foot to the other -one planted inside, one outside- and glances briefly around, toward the quiet, dimly lit corridor. Perhaps John did not expect to see him. Maybe he did not want to. But then why has he brought his daughter, and five pieces of packed belongings onto the doorstep of 221B? '
Sherlock finishes the last of his tea. For the first time in a long while, the emptiness in the flat is not absolute. It is the emptiness that will be lifted at the end of the day; with a small smile that will appear at the door, with the deep-sea eyes that will look at him, and
John doesn’t object to the break in their walk. He dumps Rosie’s bag onto the bench and stretches his arms over his head.
“Shit” he mumbles. He forgot. Damn.
He braces. It is more difficult than it used to be, calibrating the world in focus, and guiding it
Their whispers are soft as morning dew. John lets his gaze linger on Sherlock’s eyes.
Two mugs in the sink, the sounds of someone else sharing the space and the silence. But the more they share it, the more they drift apart.
my problem!”
“But, John-”
“Not that I’m aware of. Maybe Hudders is”
But to who?
He clutched her close. She pushed him away. Little weak fists against his chest. He held tighter.
“If you… Want to rest or anything we can do it tomorrow-” John’s voice wavers, and he rubs at his arm.
“I have?”
But he can’t move. It’s as if the gear is all in place and there is no key to turn the ignition, no gas to run on.
Please don't hate us, #we_feed_on_comments, hope you'll be looking forward to next week <3
“There you are, then.” Ella said when he told her. “I dare say you are already doing so.”
When Sherlock does, John gets up and picks Rosie too. She goes willing, nestling at the crook of his neck; sleepy.
By the time John brings her downstairs, his phone rings.
“Mm?” Sherlock’s eyes widen, focusing on him again, then relax, appearing normal. “Um, yes, yes, I’m good.”
Left to his own devices, Sherlock would have planned this scene out in a very simple, straightforward way: John would realise something was not right with him. Sherlock just had to cause disruptions, to upset the balance, to set John back, just as things were getting better. Sherlock could not be grateful, could not be happy. John would see that, all of that. See right through Sherlock’s mask, right to the core of how he was just a fake. John would be apprehensive, possibly indignant, and to any questions he might have, Sherlock would be unable to provide the right answer. So, John would go away, again, and take Honeybee with him; take the decision that would be better for the two of them.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock cleared his throat and tried again. “I am perfectly fi-”
“Sherlock Holmes, you are forbidden from deducing my personal life!”
“ ‘course”
She raises her palms to him and he brings one in front of his chest too. Her nose scrunched up in concentration and then she rested both her little hands against his in double high-five.
“What?”
“Jooohn, she threw it away again.” A frustrated whine from the living room.
He pulls his coat from Its hanger and puts it on with a flourish. It still falls right over his body as it settles, hugs his shoulders as it used to, wings fluttering and then folding over his back.
“Mrs. Hudson, thank god”.
“Early bird?” He goes for a smile, feels he can breathe again.
We hope you enjoy and as always comments and kudos are much appreciated.
“Will you eat for Papa, little rose?” he waves the spoon around for a moment. It’s been an hour and she has been refusing to eat since Sherlock left them on their own -which is from the moment John walked it with her.
She coos softly, her eyebrows joining together, a child’s drawing of a seagull, two curves joined in a pointy line; this one is golden. Before he can soothe it away, she is pressing her elephant against his chest, and then hugs it, so that the little stuffed animal is sandwiched between them, her little hands splayed onto Sherlock’s chest, not big enough to be able to circle around him in a proper hug; but he knows that that’s what this is.
pain.
“She’s been better. With me.” He mumbled, apologetic of not speaking directly about this particular bit before but she didn’t show any signs he should have.
“You okay? Sherlock? You okay?”
Mrs Hudson’s voice reaches him as if he were underwater. His head is a whirlwind, he can see doom marching his way, can feel its hand close around his throat. He has to tell John. Has to call John. Who is at his appointment. To tell him that his daughter has a fever, and that it’s possibly serious and that they might need to go to the hospital, and ask him what to do because he has no idea, or rather, does not trust himself to do anything at all. He is going to be a problem again, nothing but a problem, and he should have taken care of her yesterday, and thought about how to protect her better from a cold or flu or whatever this is -please not a flu, please not a flu!- and he has failed, oh god he has failed Honeybee, and if something bad happens to Honeybee, then…
“It’s alright, Sherlock.” John places the tray on the round coffee table before sitting. He takes a sip of his tea, nodding for Sherlock to reach for his cup too, which he does.
“I know she was Rosie’s mother. But I know a bad person when I see one, Sherlock” She tuts, and kisses Honeybee’s golden head. The little one has all but fallen asleep on her chest, making soft, sleepy noises. Mrs. Hudson takes a deep, composing breath. “I know the face of my husband even when it is not on him. It was unfair that you have been punished because of the likes of her”
He knew it was good. He was nineteen days sober. It wasn’t everything well and back to normal -the normal that hadn’t existed for years- but it wasn’t a small feat either. He didn’t crave it anymore. Not like those first days. He suspected things working out with Sherlock was helping him too. He was in constant movement. Like waves.
John huffs in disbelief.
John hesitates once more. Shifts his weight from one foot to the other, pinches the bridge of his nose. Sherlock holds his breath, feels John’s flow through him.
Silence stretches between them. It weighs on his chest, freezes the soles of his feet, sweats his palms.
Sherlock walks closer. With every impact of fist on metal his ears feel as if they are flinching, but the rest of him is still, immovable. He has faced a raging John before, a John that tried to hurt himself, that growled and trembled like a beaten, stray dog.
Thank you for reading! Comments, kudos etc. are much appreciated!
“Nno… It was…”
The next time he wakes, it’s to the straight, sharp light of noon falling from the windows. The curtains are drawn and he feels a weight lift when his eyes open to find Sherlock in his armchair, cuddled up, face turned to contemplate the unlit fireplace. John’s mind can find and pinpoint the last time he’d seen him like that, with the trembling shadows of a winter fire on his sharp features.
“Are you?” John stares at him, eyes like an owl.
He stops trying, sitting back on the carpet, lost like a child, biting his lip. One look from his daughter and he’s sure she’s imitating his hurt expression. He relaxes his muscles and tries a smile again. He knows it’s important and he wants to do right by her, but Sherlock…
“She’s babbling again.” John smiles at the thought, gazes still locked.
And then off to hom. Home.
“Nauseous?”, Sherlock manages to ask.
building.
His insides coil into knots.
Sherlock’s insides are tied into a knot. A tight, angry knot.
He groans, curses under his breath. Brings both palms to his face and squeezes until his vision has swimming black dots inside, tiny tadpoles in the blurriness that fills his eyes.
John consumes the words of Sherlock’s small, reluctant caption in seconds and presses the download link with trembling fingers. A grin has spread all over his face and he can’t stop it, nor does he want to.
“Well, all the best to you, then!” The waitress says, when she can catch no pair of eyes from neither of them. But she doesn’t sound like she minds. “Happy Valentine’s!”
The scene unfolds in all its glory as Sherlock -always with jam on his auburn-covered chin- opens and closes his mouth in the air, trying to catch the spoon again -filled now with buttered up scone- that Rosie waves towards him like an airplane. John bursts.
“You mean it?”
“I, uh, there’s… more, downstairs?”
“We?” a raven’s feathers brushing over John’s skin.
“Sherlock, you know how I hate to meddle-“
His calmness only drives John further.
“You aren’t. It isn’t. But I know you will”
She doesn’t like being constricted, even for so little. Her eyes are huge when she looks up at him, and he can see the strain in them, the trust she is putting in him, by letting him do this. Her fear twists inside him like a blade.
John serves their food, pleased with himself, ruffling Rosie’s hair and hums their little melody as she keeps waving her spoon around like a proper little maestro. ‘Look at that!’
“Hudders, she needs proper care, and lots of it, not pity”
“I am getting cold, is all.”
That was what Sherlock expected, nothing more, nothing less. That was not to say he would be prepared for it; he had come to understand that in the matters of John Watson, he never was truly prepared for anything, after all. But at least it was a familiar scenario. He would know how it would feel, broadly speaking.
“Mm… ‘s alright.”
Sherlock was expecting Honeybee to cling to him, afraid of the new space. But when he looks down, she has already begun to explore the playground, timid at first, like a little fawn, and then with increased interest, all baby fox as she peeks from behind colourful obstacles and tries to crawl on the slide. The pressure around his abdomen decreases.
Keeping the thought and noting down the urgent need to discuss this with John, Sherlock checks the watch on his wrist. 17.00. So… John will be back in two hours at most. In Rosie’s schedule that means that she will have eaten dinner and will be ready for bed.
“O-kay… Other symptoms?”
As expected, she thrusts her spoon in his direction. John pretends to eat a mouthful and thanks her.
John looks out the window, watching the daylight diminish to a red fiery hue, falling against grey and red bricks, reflecting over windows, flickering behind passing clouds. His fingers brush over his teacup’s rim, feeling the smooth texture, broken only by the bulges of traditional blue and okra coloured shapes, of lilies, sunflowers and citrus trees. He glances down, watches the light play over the shining material as his thumb moves.
“What?!” He’s confused. This is too far.
John’s face falls a little. He leans close with care and kisses her pink chubby cheek.
“Yeah?” John breathes.
He doesn’t stop to think what it means. Doesn’t linger to ask. He only wakes the sleeping beauty beside him when Rosie signals her dinner from the monitor. Only helps a half-asleep figure crawl under the covers of his bed. Only lets him rest as John feeds his little Rose, telling her how proud she made him, for being brave at the doctor, for being a wonderful daughter, the best there is, and then Rosie exhausted sleeps again and Sherlock has stirred and called for a glass of water and John places her in her cot carefully before getting one of his books with him, without being sure why, just having the urge to read. To someone. And Sherlock thanks him for the water and smiles and John sits beside him. It only takes a few gentle words from there. It only takes a memory of “will you stay”s. All the times he didn’t and all the times he couldn’t. It only takes a glance over bleary eyes. Silver, not blue. Bright, not menacing, after all. To look up at him and start to close. It only takes John opening the ludicrous spy novel and starting to read, starting to narrate aloud and add his own interpretations and thoughts -so much practice with Rosie on the road hadn’t gone unused in the end. It only takes the pale face of an Angel from the Moon and the urge of the Sea to touch, to lick with wanting waves over the fragile surface and nestle inside.
Sherlock rolls his eyes in agreement and is about to turn the screen off, when a weird curiosity gets the better of him. He sits back in his armchair, with his free arm bracing around his ribcage to ease the movement, and checks his messages. His lips are pressed, pulled inwards a little, his forehead creased. Turns out there was no need to be prepared; nil. Zero. Nothing at all, an empty list, save for one unread and unanswered ‘good morning’ from a few days ago, when John blacked out at breakfast. Sherlock huffs.
His arms stretch above his head, legs left to float once again, and the movement pulls him down,
John breathes, relieved. He wasn’t sure Sherlock was listening so intently, but of course he was. Always. Anything. For Rosie. John’s heart flutters.
“Mine doesn’t prickle.”
Sherlock -to John’s utmost disbelief- flushes red, looking away. John doesn’t even know if they were thinking the same thing! It’s quite possible, they weren’t, and John is becoming crazy. ‘Fine.’ They’ll deal with that later. John takes a deep breath, looks over at their therapist again, reminds himself why they’re here. He clears his throat.
? For matters as serious as where you’ll live, and you will do with your daughter, with life? If you hold my alcoholism against me, fine, but he is a junkie, barely out of rehab. I have been clean for three years, Johnny.
There is no telling if John has noticed, but if he has, he doesn’t show anything as he gives Rosie’s bag to Sherlock and helps him sling it over his shoulder.
Sherlock must have realised John is in no condition to stand and give him space to finish with his bath because he doesn’t ask for it and appears to be trying to sound casual, as if they’re only sitting by the fireplace. John bites his lip and raises his head, tipping it forward over his bent knees. Drops of warm water trickle down his spine and he shivers.
He feels that gaze on him, and yet it does not make him shiver with the ice at its core. There’s an intensity to it. It’s Sherlock looking, seeing, observing. Looking to deduce? Something’s off? John almost smiles when he registers Sherlock’s perseverance as the confusion it is. Sherlock looks away, lips pursed in a way that might indicate a bitten off smile or anger; both.
They eat the last of the leftovers –and a large bowl of salad which John leaves on the table between their plates with no explanation but obvious expectations. They are a little crammed, sitting so close, and their knees almost bump or brush a number of times. Sherlock is the first to notice and move his lanky legs away each time.
John’s home. Why is he home? No. Not home. He’s just back. Back from the shift. Right. Must be six already. Sherlock’s been drifting in his horizontal state for hours, but John can’t see that. He pushes up, palms on the duvet, lips pursing, supressing a grunt. His back is stiff, makes his ribs stretch, pulled steel ropes lodged into his flesh. Inconvenient.
John’s eyes are begging him for an answer. And Sherlock is tired of causing more pain.
“Until two days ago.”
And Sherlock has been starved of having a home to return for so long.
Melodies played on a polished violin. Stradivarius. The best sound if wielded by a master. And what a master indeed Sherlock was... Vivaldi, Bach, Paganini, Mendelssohn... John remembers. He longs. For the sweet transformed notes by Sherlock’s hands to guide him to sleep. For the nights he wasn’t afraid because Sherlock would be downstairs scribbling a composition. His repetitions lulling John deep under, well past the point of dreams.
The problem is just one, staring him in the face; he can’t do this anymore. Sherlock was never good at this, anyway. Picking the words, avoiding. He could pretend, until his bones shattered. But not this. Not now.
He doesn’t even consider it. He knows he can do it. He only needs Sherlock by his side. The need has never been more crushing and intense as right now and from now on, it’s only going to grow.
fix it. Kept pretended all was fine. He should have known though… He should have remembered the moment Sherlock got out of Mrs Hudson’s boot and the doctor couldn’t even tell if he was faking drug addiction or not. Evidently, not.
John breathes, grateful he didn’t point it all out right there and then.
Rosie has fallen quiet, eyes wide, fixed on Greg. All bundled up restrained curiosity. She has been doing so much better, but she needs some prompting with people she’s not daily accustomed to. He presses a palm at her back, brushing circles. Just like with Sherlock. John smiles privately, glancing back to his grumpy detective.
He feels guilty for treating Harry the way he did. After all… Her fear he could understand. Perhaps it was a, strictly speaking, irrational fear, given her brother’s character. Or rather, it was a fear cultivated from outside as well as from inside. But that did not make it any less palpable, or valid. On the contrary; it would never be only her fault for being poised to find adversaries at every turn. Even in her own family. For this he regrets hurting her further.
“May I have a moment?”
Sherlock Holmes never listened to him anyway. Not when something important was at stake. John is glad this time the value has shifted from criminals to watching over their little girl. Contentment raises in John’s heart and he wants to croon. He can see how Rosie has sneaked behind all those walls and pretences. He can see how Sherlock cares for her. Humanely. Whole-heartedly. With all he has. He can see Rosie always was since the moment she was conceived and always will be important for Sherlock. John is proud of him. And grateful. Even if he is also guilty of not appreciating it as he should have before now, but he hopes he can make up for it. He will do anything in his power to do so.
“Yeah, like-”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ah.”
"You okay?", he pants, a hand leaving Honeybee to hold Sherlock’s arm.
“How is he better than me, Johnny, mm? Why him?”
His throat is tight. He can’t speak, as if in a dream, and the night scenery of a normal busy street is flashing, exchanging its existence and aura for the whiteness of his mind and the transparent fire on a screen in front of him. He knows this is all familiar, he knows he should recognise the place and time and what’s about to happen, but his mind is quiet, only able to fight the vision for enough seconds to carry his body one foot forward at a time.
She’s content to pick up interest in her other toys scattered around her little table in no time, starting to draw over the plastic with some Crayola markers.
“Boys?”
Sherlock tenses. John merely smiles.
It’s too much. Too much joy. Too much. John wants to, needs to let something out.
John looks up. The scents of fresh breakfast and tea have brought some semblance of colour on Sherlock’s cheeks, although his voice is rough with disuse. He’s pleased to note the dark cloud hovering over his friend’s eyes has eased. He just looks tired now. Resigned.
“I will”
“It doesn’t erase progress.” He interrupted.
“Mmmmm…” John hums. The fajitas are delicious. “Extra’dinary”
A small hesitant giggle rings in the air. John enters the living room, hands full with a bundle of his little girl. He sits on his armchair, getting them both comfortable and grins. His eyes shine as if his daughter’s happiness fills the air with sparkles, creating a halo of light around her bouncing sunny curls.
"Stay. Please"
‘I want to go back...’
“Like Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. Remember him, Rosie?” John’s been reading her stories. Like he used to. She squeals.
Now there’s something different all together happening. The broken pieces are back, returning to place, and Sherlock’s lips are tugged, tugged, tugged. Into infinity.
“Goodnight”
John's eyes widen. Imperceptibly, but they do. "Thank you".
“Sherlock?” he blinks.
of January 2017. He shouldn’t have bought the whole bottle at that cake place Molly got them to celebrate the happy day. Oh, so happy day. The legendary consultant’s birthday.
“Shhh... shhh... Papa’s here, little one... I’m here...”
To his surprise and delight, he was allowed to take care of Honeybee, as he had been doing the past few days, and there was no other mention of the previous day’s incident. Problem was, she seemed to be entirely indifferent to him, or at least to try to be. He had to work his way back to her affection with makeshift little tunes he hummed softly, tickles, hugs, and three different fairytales. Which she rejected all, along with any other plushie or toy he tried to tempt her with. She just kept babbling to her pink elephant and stabbing him with accusatory stares, when she could be bothered to stop turning her face away from him. ‘Stubborn as her father’. He smiled and reached for the small booklet John had left with him yesterday. ‘Chemistry for babies’. If it was as silly as it sounded… He turned the soft fabric book over in his hands. He had felt it yesterday, but now he truly saw it for the first time. A bright green cover, with an image of a test-tube fizzling with colourful bubbles. He sat cross-legged on the carpet beside her and began to read. If she paid him any mind, he was not sure. But after a while, she fell asleep with her head pillowed on his thigh.
John waits for the maps app to come up before he jerks his head in a nod. Sherlock hovers close, face turned at any passers-by, his frown from inside the tube returning over his delicately shaped eyebrows. Rosie kicks again. John grunts.
It’s a bolt of electricity coursing through them.
If John Watson would just go on and be that man. Because he could do that. Because Sherlock believed he could. What the hell was he waiting for? Why hadn’t he got on with it already? Why hadn’t he given in to those blue irises full of promise? Why?
weirdo, weirdo!
He hates it. Plucking at his hair, John Watson contemplates how much he hates it. Himself. Everything.
There is that peculiar numbness rising in him. And as always, he realises it is here again only too late. It has already caught his feet, his legs, his hips, begun to pull him under. Maybe if he kicked, if he moved again, he could still have time get away. He doesn’t. And it keeps rising, like a dark wave, from inside, and he can see it, and he knows every spot it will go for next. It’s almost like an old friend.
John’s hand retreats, and they are apart again, the bridge between them gone. Only then does it truly down to Sherlock in all its magnitude:
“Hmm?! Yeah. Yeah, okay”, John smiles back, as if to say
John avoided to point the blame at her at the time. He hadn’t chosen this either. They hadn’t talked it through. He understood. He tried. He wasn’t made to be a father but he could give his best shot. He would. For Rosie. Her mother had made it clear though… she wasn’t planning to do so herself. Nah, not for her. And then she went and all of a sudden, everything changed. She threw herself in front of a bullet, something John would swear she was incapable of doing mere hours ago. Why the change? Why the sacrifice? Why… He couldn’t understand it. Even now. Couldn’t map it out.
“Yes. I promise.”
“Yeah…” He swallows. “How was, um, Sherlock, today?”, he tries.
And just like that, the tether snaps. John’s eyes widen and his whirlwind of a mind clears again. Like it did yesterday.
On the lips. A second time. Mouth murmuring goodnight, moonlight-soft against his.
“Because...” John can’t hold that gaze. He shuffles, stunned. “It’s important. To me”
“John, no.” Sherlock tries to reach him, takes a step closer. But John is sinking. Sinking. Nothing can reach him.
“Goodnight, John”, he murmurs. He takes a step back, toward his bedroom, and closes the door between them.
“I don’t?...”
Sherlock has gone mute, suffering her pain, watching, holding.
A cocoon of black space folds around him. The ocean is gone, its lilting waves being sucked to the centre of his brain. His eyelids remain stubbornly sealed together, but at least now there is no danger of drowning.
Even if with this and that John had also forgotten.
“You okay?”
He uncoils and lies on his back, hands steepled under his chin -not that this now means anything at all. Not without a mind palace.
He should get up. Swing his legs off the bed, reach for his dressing gown, tie it at the side. He should walk to the bathroom, splash water onto his face, wash his teeth, comb his hair. Make his way to the kitchen, wait for John, if John is not there, or greet him if he is. They will have tea and breakfast as they do every morning, Honeybee will be changed, fed. In his mind he can see every movement, every detail, orchestrated to perfection. But when he instructs his limbs to move, none is willing to. Roots might as well have sprung from his vertebrae, tying hm to the mattress. Or perhaps he truly did sink, his body hitting the ocean bed, with its colorful corals and plastic bag body of jellyfish. Is that how it would be in reality? Not that he really cares. Even if he did, finding out implies moving. Moving is impossible.
Sherlock is in withdrawal for a drug he’s never had.
John had not given any indication that he would want to move back in. Perhaps his brother pressured him. But no, John would never do something he did not want to do, would he, stubborn as a pack mule. Especially given the way he treated the prospect of seeing Sherlock again yesterday… Grim chances. Not choice, then. Need. Short on money? John
Sherlock nods, his stomach a helium balloon. “Thank you. I appreciate it”
They say it is supposed to feel like fireworks. Like an explosion of feelings, colour, sensations. Maybe it is. Just not now. Now, all it is, is… quiet. The layers of the world fall away, one by one. Sounds evaporate, a crowd falling silent with the first lights that fill a stage. His focus calibrates only on the point of contact between him and John. The rusty mechanism of his mind is irrelevant. There is no questions or doubt, time stops. Truly stops. His chest is light, as if he has breathed in the vastness of a clear night sky. It’s the missing piece slotting into place, the elusive solution found, the end of an ordeal. And for once Sherlock is here, and now, not in what could be, what should be, what hasn’t been. He feels at peace.
“Did Sherlock have a problem with it?”
to feel?”
"Hm?"
Sherlock tilts his head.
a problem and I will solve it, but… It’s not a cause. There’s… other things to deal with. Deeper than… Than that. I can’t talk about all of them now, I don’t even know all of them-”
Rosie takes a careful step towards John, but his heartbroken tone makes her stop and kneel to crawl back to Sherlock instead, bulky, tiny fingers clinging at his trousers. Sherlock appears to have found no reassuring use of his hands now that Rosie is gone and so he takes the chance to reach and brush her hair as she sits on his shoe, his face serious and muscles stretched at the corners.
He guides Sherlock to sit down, palm rubbing small circles over his back. The man huffs. Yet again.
Rosie coos and stands, her pink elephant plushie held tight to her chest. Sherlock can’t help but smile, and gets up. “Good morning, Honeybee”. He walks to her, lifts her up into his arms with a grunt at the strain. Her laughter is worth it, so he spins her around until he is dizzy and panting, and has to sit on his armchair, and clutch her tight to his chest.
“I’m sorry… for leaving her with you like that, it was-”
broke it”, he corrects ruefully. “And it wasn’t me, Harry. It wasn’t me”
“Yes.”
The tub is almost brimming. Sherlock turns the tap off. The last stray drops dive, and their plop landing echoes in the now silent bathroom.
‘Yes but… I didn’t know he noticed that’
John knows. He doesn’t usually come knocking, does he? Yes. That’s probably it. He knows moving back in was a mistake now. He knows Sherlock was a mistake.
“Good. So, let’s start with the basics, shall we?” She clasps her hands together -somehow managing it to be quiet, not to startle Rosie- and rests them on her knees, leaning forward. “Leave Rosie get acclimatised for some moments and tell me what is the reason prompting you to ask for assistance?”
“If you want us to name things like adults, John” he says, his voice calm, but not patronizing; stating the facts, not explaining as he would do on the cases. “You have recently developed a mild addiction to alcohol because of a number of difficulties and struggles-”
He cups her face, strokes her sun-kissed curls with calloused fingers.
it. At the very least it hides the circles under your eyes, how tired you are. You are not used to the high-class profile demanded of you, but you have no alternative, given the massive debts you have accumulated over the years. I suppose this alone would be enough to make you just as unfit as a candidate by the social services, don’t you think?”
Her temperature wasn’t rising again. That was good.
“Thoughts?” Ella smiles. The affection is pure in her voice. Of course, she has come to care for his little girl.
“Yes?”
“What was it?”
Sherlock Holmes. Always a mystery. John doesn’t mind. Never did. Even if it brought him to the edge sometimes. It wasn’t only Sherlock’s fault. It was their lack of proper communication. They have that now. So, what could possibly go wrong? Besides, Baker Street has proven to be the perfect place for them, time and time again.
A small fist gets tangled with the curls at the back of his neck and accidentally pulls, as Honeybee snot-weeps into his tee.
The flash comes up unexpected. Skin colliding with the knuckles of a fist.
Not to John, certainly. It could tip the fragile balance between them. Besides, John is at work; the last thing he needs is seeing a message from Sherlock and worrying that something might be wrong with Honeybee (Why else would Sherlock be contacting him). They are not what they used to be. And even when they were, more often than not his messages were unwanted annoyances. Especially during the last couple of years. Invariably answered with “what do you want, Sherlock”. He had soon learned to want nothing. Nothing at all.
Sherlock stands, slowly. He doesn’t like John’s anger, how it crumples him, shattering his features as if they were a reflection on a broken mirror. How he shuts himself in it, as if it were a cage for a beast.
“’Course”
Sherlock feels raw as he bends to pick her up and nestle her into his arms. “I am proud of you”, he says, out of breath. “I am very proud of you, Honeybee”
“Sherlock? Wait, hang on a minute, I-”
It’s no use. He knows.
“Okay.”
When he had downed it, shaking his head ‘no’ to the question of whether he could manage more bites, John cleared the table of plates, and Sherlock waited. His eyes took in the emptiness where chaos used to reside, until he could take it no more, and they darted away. Where he was numb with shock and surprise maybe with a sliver of hope too, doubt begun to break through the surface, with its cold, dark hand ready to pluck his heart.
“It’s just... you seem a bit off, today?”
“Um, no. No, absolutely not”
“Can’t… do this…” John’s breaths heave for a moment.
Honeybee yawns and sighs. “Sleepy, are you, little love?”, John coos.
“It… It wasn’t his fault. What happened. I am certainly accountable for my actions and-”
“Don’t worry about it.” He pauses, pursing lips as he examines his handiwork, straightening up, hands on his hips. He must make such a sight. He ducks back into it.
‘Together.’
“Mmm, divine.” He contemplates.
“Um… so…”
Family?
John dropped a heavy palm on his face, muffling a groan into it. Everything seemed too loud all of a sudden. What had he done? The drinking and- Fuck.
This chapteeeer. Easy peasy. Pfff... no, seriously, this chapter goes a tad darker. Just a tad. Not too far. Just heed the warnings dear wonderful readers and you'll be just fine ^^
He can’t move. He struggles. Scrambles.
was the one who wanted, needed, this,
be different. It must. It should.
So back to it. Keeping at it. Silent treatment. Because he’s selfish. Because he’s useless. Because he’s broken. But he cares… He wants to. He wants so much. He wants too much. He can’t do this. But he must do something.
Sherlock looks away, over the window behind her office.
John can’t deny that putting Sherlock out of his own loophole of worrying and worrying and worrying had been weighing on him as well. Since yesterday, Sherlock had been calm and for all eyes quite happy, even if shocked sometimes at John’s almost instinctive advances, but John still worried over both of them. Rosie and Sherlock. He needs both of them to be okay in order to function. He really, really needs some good news.
Instead, he leans forward and gently presses the tip of his nose onto hers. "Boop".
“We know. We know. Just…” John breathes in. “Her mother has not been loving, then has been absent and then gone for good through a timespan of months.” He pushes out in a single, quick exhale.
Please heed the tags. Repeating here, just for extra safety measures, that this chapter contains, in particular: panic attack, depression bout, self-harm ideation, self-hatred. And more.
“I don’t want her to be right. Okay?”, he says, his teeth grinding.
So small, yet it means so much.
‘Nno. You’re just an idiot’
At the very least, now some of the pain will be eased. He used to look down and see only his empty hands, and a second hole through his chest. Now his hands can hold Honeybee, and the hole in his chest is worth something enough to grant him relief.
“I am so sorry for this morning, flower, I shouldn’t have behaved like I did, please, will you forgive me?”
“That’s a brave decision. Knowing what kind of help to ask for and feeling confident about it is a big step forward.”
Sherlock puts his laptop away and joins them. “Well… We have just… said some things that needed to be said. And… That is pretty much all”
“You could-”
John shrugs out of his brown parka and sits himself down. He reaches to place a kiss on Rosie’s forehead but she recoils, curling into herself. Maybe it’s the music, the people -even if quiet and calm and of course significantly fewer than inside the tube-, the lights or John himself. John doesn’t know and this is no time to find out. He knows what she has been asking since that intersection.
“Sherlock found me in the kitchen. Helped me to rest, and regroup, a little. We talked this morning.”
As if she was an afterthought.
Estuary: The part of a river that is affected by tides. The region near a river mouth in which the freshwater of the river mixes with the saltwater of the sea.
Knowing Sherlock is capable of such a state... Half-dead, unmoving, ignorant of any stimuli... Depressed, as John had denied he was himself when confronted with it in therapy - as he is denying again now...
John reaches for a light switch when the shadowed figure doesn’t move nor answer. He dares hope this is not a dream. That he’s not back... back when anything resembling this would most certainly be a dream. Back when Sherlock was-
They could have parted much earlier than 3 am. But neither of them seemed to want to drift away. Perhaps neither could. Sherlock remembers that it hadn’t been an option in his mind, at least.
“No, yeah. Quite right.” John lets him have it, smirking. He can’t deny the man anything. Sherlock’s changed energy quite catching. “Have you made them before?”
“Sherlock!?”
“Aaa---chooooo”
said.”
John hums, amused, as Sherlock curls his feet up and drums his fingers on his knees, an easy smile settling over his features once more. The golden button is pressed by a judge and Sherlock gets his wish as both contestants stay in.
“Rosie…”
“All is fine, little rose, Papa is going to check on Sherlock, okay?” he brushes her cheek and she nods, making his eyes go wide.
They had just finished dinner but were still on their usual spots on the kitchen table. John is writing down a list of pills and various medicine they were running out of, Sherlock idly pushing a piece of chicken around his still half-full plate, wondering whether he could go for another bite.
“There!”, John finally says, triumphantly, as he sits back down. Sherlock’s spine is tingling, and he wishes he could be the forest floor itself.
Phototactic: Moving in response to light
“I’ll be right back. Breathe.” John squeezes Sherlock’s shoulders and searches for their closest first aid kit supplies, a hidden batch on the high cupboards mainly to put to good use for kitchen related accidents; extra anti-burn supplies.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Already?” John’s voice is all soft-sleepy surprise.
“Oh?” John approaches, inquisitive.
‘Maybe he trusts me too much for his own good.’
. So real, painfully real, begging for Sherlock to reach and grasp them, just there, in front of him… But when John had pulled back he just let him go, had not tried to take more than what he was worth, more than was his share.
back. So badly. I didn’t want to divert my anger to you for all the wrong reasons anymore, I didn’t- I-... You didn’t deserve that.”
“Yeah?”
“Do not worry dear. She had not been outside in a while, she must have caught some little bug or other. It’s alright”
They both stay silent.
Round and round and round.
“I mean… I’m here anyway. And… It’s… It’s a pain. Pills and physio and a diet and… I know it’s fucking dull, Sherlock. And it’s… It’s, yeah. It’s what I want to do”, he mumbles, and then clears his throat. His hands twist, palms rubbing together, then his left hand curls over the right and squeezes.
“How do you figure?”
Everything. Crumbs fell down, shards shattered to smaller pieces.
“There, let me see, let me see it, please.”
“Yes, she is. She’s not staying quiet when in distress.” Sherlock’s tone sounds proud.
“Sherlock?”
“Good”
“He’s… really been there for me.”
She answers with a high-pitched hum. His ears almost perk up like a dog’s. What was that? Is she singing? ‘Oh, thank god for that!’
He scoops up some of the cream in a bowl, finds a green baby-safe spoon, and sits on the chair beside Rosie’s. “Time to taste-test?”. He places the bowl and spoon in front of her. She eyes it suspiciously, but her puffed up cheeks make her pout; a hungry hawk chick. Demanding. He can’t help but smile, as she clutches the spoon, and brings a small mouthful to her lips for a catlike taste-lick. He waits past the necessary stages of making a face, whining, and then licking again, for a second try, his head pillowed on his forearms against the kitchen table. “Hmm… Not good?”
There it is. The look. That damned look… Sherlock pining him to the spot with his eyes. Speaking without words. Accusing without accusation. Still believing. Still holding on. But now actually asking for an explanation. An action. A relief. Reprieve. Something! As if all this could be erased if John just would…
“Thank...” John pauses, taking a careful sip, scrambling for time. “...you”
“Why can’t you just
“And you can… You can touch me too. If you want”, John adds, but it sounds like something he has been practising how to say.
‘She thinks I’m sad.’
Sherlock fills his lungs with air and dives. He swims into a cold current, does not open his eyes as he kicks and pushes and strives to move forward. He does not question where he needs to go; he just needs to move, to not remain here. The water weighs him down, there are bubbles breaking through his lips. He breaks to the surface for breath, his hair slicked back, away from his face.
That man. That broken tone. Gravel between his toes…
“Hey.”
“Sure?”
He still remembers: what he has been through, what has been said, and done. He remembers his life. But not much else. All other information he had painstakingly collected over the years, and the ability to pick pieces from it and slot them together into a case-solving puzzle at lightning speed, the ability to read people like open books, is gone with it. He can make new memories, can remember reasonably well. But not everything. And not nearly enough. He forgets, and does not know what to do with any information he collects, so that he will just keep forgetting. If he tries to build, not a new wing, just a new room, he fails, and whatever he has put together has crumbled by the next morning.
“I… I meant it. It changes nothing you don’t want to change. Okay? And… And you don’t have to decide now, and, and you don’t have to decide at all-”
‘Damn, don’t I know.’
“Later. Yes. Thank you”.
A bullet to the heart and all crazy, loud, overwhelming honesty came rushing in. And John let it all happen, hadn’t he? As much as he tried to block it, blame Sherlock for it, everything found a way back. A way
A lean and a tug and John stretches as much as his body allows, tiptoeing, bringing both palms to frame Sherlock’s face and… he’s there.
“Alright. Your way, little brother”, she says, as if this is a sacrifice not worth making. With her next exhale, she murmurs “I have only ever wanted what is best for you”
"Okay. Give me ten"
Another giggle resonates in the space between them and the sparkles turn into fireworks. John beams, back at Rosie. His sole purpose to be the instigator of that sound again. He’s missed her so much. Missed her happiness. Missed opportunities to make her smile again.
“Yeah, uh… she is.” John looks over with eyes gleaming wet, his mind racing to what he has to say. What he has to live through again by saying it, admitting it. “Her life has been… upside down, most of the time. She hasn’t lived in any steady, loving environments until… until now…”
He knocks. A subtle rub of two knuckles against wood.
“Food okay?”
Sherlock nods and as Rosie keeps reaching, he reaches to press a soft ‘mwah’ at her forehead. She’s precisely at his height right now, on John’s shoulders, while her father himself feels small as his face gets almost mashed into Sherlock’s chest.
Even if he wanted to, he could never again be Sherlock Holmes, the only Consulting Detective in the world. He has outlived his usefulness.
John’s eyes close with a groan as Rosie whimpers. He can’t. He can’t. He can’t.
“Beg your pardon?”
“To say goodbye.” John squeezes out. “I came to say goodbye.” He repeats, slower.
Words. Echoed. Faded. Revisited a thousand times between lonely nights and a glass filled with Brandy. He didn’t love her. It’s true. He never did, in fact. Maybe at some point, in his darkest of days. When the revolver in his desk would rattle and call him to open the damned drawer. Maybe, then… She might had been a sliver of light pushing through the clouds.
‘I threatened to kill him.’
A car door slams, and Sherlock pauses mid-stride, ears perking up like a startled cat's. He is holding his breath, and a small frown forms above his eyes. It softens when the engine jerks into life, and soon has unceremoniously carried the vehicle away.
“How is she?” Sherlock mutters.
John checks with Sherlock first, making eye contact. Rosie is climbing down his long, stretched legs now and he struggles to keep them and her steady until she reaches the floor, safe.
“Make sure you eat half of that until we come to join you, please?” His cheeks are hurting. He’s beaming. He wants to burst to laughter. His heart is filling. Sherlock is looking. Wide eyed. John smirks. “Be right back. Promise.”
Breaking the stillness, it was now murmuring softly in his ear.
“I doubt he ever stopped”
It’s all gone the moment he walks into an alley, avoiding the main street. The memories, the intrusions in his mind, the flashes, the sounds. Stressful day, as Ella would say. Particularly triggering. Should battle through it, face it, not stay home. Not that he’d have a home to stay to, without it being triggering as hell.
John gets down to his knees, arm around his friend without a second thought.
here?”
He could have sworn Sherlock must have calculated this effect at some point because he used it non-stop. It can’t be just instinctive, can it?
He’s right. Of course he’s right. Sherlock props his cheek up on a fist and watches as John, now in a crisp white shirt and dark blue jeans (which Sherlock is sure he hasn’t seen before), is squeezing the four halves of the oranges, one after the other, into their hideous juice.
He needs a drink. Just one. A drop of alcohol. Just one. He would give everything to damp it all down. Just a bit. A tiny bit. Tesco at the corner by the clinic had been a challenge. But he didn’t budge. Wouldn’t. Couldn’t. Not today.
He’s a step away from his door. One more step and he’d be gone again. Like yesterday. And the day before. One more step and the door will close.
‘That’s my man.’ He bites his lip to contain it for sure this time.
“No. Not for… Not for Rosie, I’m not… I’m not keeping them apart because…. Because she’s…” Alcoholic? Gay?, Sherlock’s mind supplies. Both? “-It’s just because she’s Harry. Because we never went along, and I can’t… I can’t deal with her, right now. I can’t deal with Rosie dealing with her, with her dealing with Rosie. I can’t. I just can’t. I don’t want to. I don’t want to do that”
Sherlock's heart stops. He whirs his head left, right, feels breaths clog at the base of his throat, turn wet like condensed steam.
‘The two of us…’ John almost murmurs it, shapes it in his mouth, wants to try it out.
Sherlock’s attention snaps to them again.
He can’t get enough of them together, either. John’s soft voice and gentle encouragement, his steady way with her. He had watched from the couch, smiling, his eyes leisurely taking in John’s silver hair’s swoop as it turned into a fringe, the salt and pepper beard, the strong, mature face. He could look now, look and observe and no one told him not to. The way John’s eyes shone, waves sparkling with the setting sun, when he laughed was what mesmerised him the most, even after all these years.
“Yes. It’s important”
It takes a moment to register the words, and another to reply.
“-What are we
Scratches. Hurts. Face looking down the abyss.
“It’s been a week.” He mumbles, fingers tangling together into impossible knots.
“Mm?”
John hates crying.
He keeps it light-hearted, soft. No resentment or hate over this one. Not anymore. It’s connected with some relatively good memories now. Memories to do with… who else?
“As I said this morning.” John sniffs. “I am glad you are.” His cheekbones and nose feel hot by the pressure of emotion and unshed tears.
“You think I pity you?”
She’s unphased by his tightly closed knees and tense arms. He’s sitting as if on attention in front of a high-ranked officer.
“You seemed to be getting along better”
When first he’d heard John’s voice, in Serbia, it was when an iron rod was slammed down his back, to warn him of what was to come; of when the same rod would be dipped in fire and fed with flame, to melt away his skin. Frustrated barking crowded him, like a pack of hungry wolves, with eyes burning yellow in the dark. And the voice had only been one thing. The one thing he had not heard for what seemed like forever, amidst dirty alleys, and half-collapsed hide-outs, and people without faces or name. One word.
owes me an apology”, Mrs. Hudson demands, like an exasperated schoolteacher.
He is hollowed out, a sack of skin and bones. He is barely within the desired BMI range; he was only released from the hospital in the first days of January when he had stopped being underweight. But some twenty days later, there is not much in the way of extra mass on him. He hasn’t been that thin in years; not when he was using the first time, not when John and he had met at Bart’s. Maybe when he was just too small to have been any different, elastic limbs and a tiny tummy over stick-like legs. Now he thinks he looks oddly scary, in his gangly, stern way. He snorts, turns his head the other way, lowers it, scowling at the mirror beneath stray curls of hair over pale eyes. And then it hits him. ‘I am thirty-seven years old’. He shakes his head, the ghost of a laughter’s grimace over his features, turning them even more gaunt than they are.
Home. He needs to go
“Sherlock…” John pleads. “You’ll freeze.”
It made his stomach twist with guilt of his own. John should not feel this way.
“Of course. But if she doesn’t want coddling, please don’t pressure her. Her pink elephant is in the washing machine and she is in a bit of a stroppy mood today”
It’s not. It simply is not.
“Please”
Sherlock’s lips part, eager to add something already said and for which John is grateful for, to the bottom of his heart, but has to gently stop it from being uttered now, because it doesn’t matter. Only Sherlock does.
“Can’t remember where they are?”
“Thanks.”
John. The old John. The one that rebuked him with a roll of his eyes and a snorted chuckle. Firm, but kind. It was not their every day. Even before the fall. But when it was…
Sherlock has never seen John be cold with Honeybee. He can imagine him being withdrawn out of fear of hurting her, or so exhausted and wasted that he could not bring himself to look at her in the eye.  But even if there have been ample times where he could lose his temper -and any other parent might have- John only snapped once, when Rosie had accidentally pulled the tablecloth and caused all the contents of the table to spill across the floor. But even then, he had not shouted
Sherlock’s eyes flickered and he went loose. Looser than before, when he was ready to collapse, looser than ever. John watched with silent surprise as his shoulders sagged and his body reached and leaned and rested. Over John’s beating heart.
“It was just… too quiet.” He admits finally. “The house. Now. I was scared.”
John blinks at him as if hypnotized. And then his jaw sets. “I have no idea what you are talking about, Sherlock”, he says, very, very slowly. His voice has lowered.
and not care about the world? Just hold and love and live? Why?
“Yes. As far as I know. Has regular appointments, a good support network”
“Oh dear”
“Yes, yes. Alright.” Is the hushed reply and Sherlock leans a tad forward and the moment is gone.
!” His voice, unrestrained now, bursts free, booms in the flat, slamming from wall to wall, making Sherlock’s bones rattle. He thinks he understands now.
Sherlock’s cheeks are flushed red and John hopes it’s from the newly-made fire. His lips are a soundless ‘oh’ of disbelief as he takes his offered blanket and settles, resting his back on his armchair. John does the same. Their feet meet halfway as they stretch a tad, the distance too small for their knees to not be bent. Toes, huddled under blankets, stop moving, examining the contact of each other’s with thick fabric between.
‘Is this... is this what “not easy” means?’
Distorted voices, nightmares. Commands and pleads. Red. Red. Red tile… No. Blood.
He presses the red button with force, widening his stride. He was there for her whenever he could, whenever she let him, but now that she is ‘all-better’ herself, she can’t even let him choose how he needs her to help.
“You didn’t eat breakfast, did you?” John simply asks, voice flat, unassuming.
Sherlock is up beside him in an instant, helping him get their little rose clean from any remaining shampoo, washing her with precisely selected temperature water once again. He doesn’t probe for more. He respects John opening up like that. Slow and incidental, whenever he needs to, wants to. John towels Rosie carefully but she’s not even grumpy, satisfied to be outside on dry land finally, he bets.
He found himself smiling. He had passed through those thoughts again and again, ruminating, and only Sherlock could instantly see when he did that. She had learnt to do it after years, but Sherlock… John would bet he could do it since the beginning. God, that man…
There were times when she
Not done then. John straightens up, returns Sherlock’s piercing gaze with his own. He can deal with that. Yes.
Molly. The name stands out, almost beckons. Sherlock knows she’s not pleased with him, knows he has let her down (four slaps too many, the message got through). But it will just be a text. Harmless. He just needs the safety of the reply’s ping, the knowledge there is someone at some other end of the network and that the two of them are connected a lighthouse’s beam in the dark. She was one of the people who would come check on him, during his first days out from the hospital. Maybe she will understand.
a variety now." He kissed the top of John's head before dropping the towel and leading him out of the bathroom.

"Of course it isn't," Bilbo said, nuzzling against him.
John snogged him thoroughly. "Do you, now?" he asked playfully.
"Since I started studying your dating habits and researching what to do via internet. Strangely, Lestrade refused to teach me." He took off John's shirt and threw it to the other side of the room, not caring where it landed in the slightest.
"Alright love," Sherlock yawned, kissed John gently, and used his chest as a pillow.
Smaug licked his lips, pinning the thief to the column wall. "I think I might just eat you up," he purred, his eyes glittering with anticipation and his intention clear from his quickly hardening cock. He leaned towards the tiny man and licked up the side of his neck.
John's heart broke for Sherlock. "What happened?"
"I love you too," John replied, sliding his tongue into Sherlock's mouth. He moaned when their tongues met. God, it was perfect. Sherlock's hands were occupied with holding his sheet around him, but he would much rather be holding John instead. No longer caring, he pulled John close, wrapping the sheet around them both. John's hand slipped from Sherlock's waist to his perfectly shaped arse. He was so tempted to just carry Sherlock off to his bed. He probably would soon.
John reached into his bedside table and retrieved a small bottle, handing it to Sherlock. He was blushing a light pink. "Never know when you'll need it..."
"Smaug!" Bilbo moaned, arching his back. No one had ever done this to him before and it felt amazing. Smaug took more of him into his mouth, swirling his tongue around him as he massaged at Bilbo's thighs. Bilbo moaned again. The dragon had a very talented tongue and a very warm, wet, and wonderful mouth.
John felt his control crumble, his thoughts
Smaug lifted up from him, licking up the hobbit's chest, "I think you could use a bit more sugar..." He captured Bilbo's mouth with his as he grabbed a large stash of chocolate from just beyond the bed. Bilbo kissed back, not seeing what Smaug had gotten. All he knew was he wanted more. Much more. The chocolate melted quickly from Smaug's hand onto Bilbo, dripping all the way from his neck to his cock. "Now there's a dessert..." he purred, grinning. He began lapping the chocolate up.
"Cute!?" Sherlock hissed. "John I'm a cat! I don't even have opposable thumbs!" Sherlock got a better look at the flat from John's lap, realizing how big everything was now. "I'm... I'm tiny..." He hunched back down into John, afraid of falling off the chair.
"Sentiment... not really my strong suit John." Sherlock thought his own actions had been loud enough. Had he not taken the jar of eyeballs out of the microwave for John? Gone to restaurants despite not being hungry just to be with him? Run off all of John's 'girlfriends'? Clearly John was bad at picking up on his hints.
Sherlock stretched out against John. "Your jumper reeks of jam, if you were unaware," he stated matter-of-factly. His tail swished back and forth. He had not realized that he had started snuggling his head against said jumper.
"My very own dragon," Bilbo said with a grin.
"Someone broke my heart very badly..." Sherlock reluctantly explained. "I haven't trusted anyone since."
"You naughty little thing; you would try to defy me like that," Sherlock reprimanded playfully. He grabbed a glorious handful of John's arse and sucked passionately at his neck.
"Yeah... thought you.... were supposed to be... a genius...." John managed to tease between moans and gasps of pleasure. "Oh Sherlock...."
After a few minutes of intense snogging, John spoke again. "We need to go ring shopping," he mused, his hand lazily trailing along Sherlock's spine.
"You said last night in the tub that you consider us married," John recalled. "Would you like to make it official?"
Smaug took him in completely and hummed around him, his hand coming up to tease Bilbo's entrance. Bilbo cried out in pleasure. It was so wonderful.... Absolutely bloody perfect.
Bilbo gently caressed Smaug's cheek with his hand. "Because I fell in love with you," he whispered.
"And you really are," Sherlock said with awe in his voice. He smiled, kissing his John deeply.
"There's nothing I want more," John replied. "Nothing but you." His tongue slipped into Sherlock's mouth. He had never felt as at home as he felt in Sherlock's arms.
Sherlock practically ripped John's shirt off, his hands glided down his smooth torso slowly to the top of his trousers, playing with the belt. John followed suit and removed Sherlock's shirt, albeit more carefully than Sherlock had his, and threw the shirt off to the side. His hands ran along Sherlock's pale chest.
Bilbo's hand fisted in Smaug's hair. "Smaug.... I'm... ah.... c-close...."
," Sherlock argued.
Sherlock sighed deeply. He didn't want to think about the events of so long ago; he just wanted to lay there with John and learn to trust him. "It was a while ago," he muttered. "It doesn't matter now."
Sherlock's tail wrapped around John's waist as he drifted off to sleep. He would finally be waking up in John's arms like he had dreamed of doing so many times.
John laughed. "You asked Lestrade to teach you?" Sherlock could be so naïve sometimes...
"I love you, John," Sherlock told John. He wrapped his arms around his doctor's sleeping form, falling asleep to the beating of his heart.
Sherlock closed his eyes, imagining he was in his normal human body again as he sat up in John's lap licking and nipping him. His eyes shot back open. Oh god, had he really just thought that...? He looked up, having heard John's moan, and noticed the simply delicious shade of red he was turning. He felt a sudden spike go through his spine and down his tail.
John grinned. "So you'll marry me, Sherlock?" he asked, wanting a definite answer.
"If I... must..." Sherlock sighed, not sounding nearly as put out or reluctant as he intended. He had a hard time pulling himself away from John. He grabbed a few items from his closet. "Rope or handcuffs?" he asked, holding up both for John's inspection.
