John rests his forehead against Sherlock's before nuzzling his nose closer, and then their lips brush and Sherlock's mind...stops.
"Then what is this, exactly?" Sherlock asks, holding up a small bracelet between his gloved fingers that matches the bracelet seen in a couple of the photos in the man's wallet. "Come, John. We have other matters to tend to," Sherlock says, beginning to walk away.
John's hand slipped to his nape and tangled into the curls at the back of his head, and then his mouth was opening wider, gently wrapping Sherlock's upper lip with his two, then the bottom lip, and then there was a warm tongue gliding across the seam of those bow lips and Sherlock opened abruptly, wanting to welcome his doctor. His fingers fisted into the jumper at John's shoulders, holding on for dear life as John's tongue slipped softly into his mouth, and this was
A fall to save a life. Three lives, really, but only one that mattered. Only one that left him cold and empty and
Sherlock retrieves another glass from the kitchen, then takes the bottle from the floor and pours himself a generous amount. "Yes."
John caught his eyes starting to roll back in his head and forced them instead on the huge blueish eyes staring up at him.
"Yes, but fortunately," the apparent leader of the trio says with a wicked grin, "we don't need you two alive. Our boss would like to remain missing."
This whole situation reminds me briefly of a case we'd been working before the…well, before the Fall. We'd been in an ordinary and rather lively bar, inquiring after a suspect, when one particularly
With a frustrated cry, he slams his fist against the driver's side window with too much strength for his fragile bones. He lets out a pained sound and cradles the arm to his chest. Daft bugger probably broke his own wrist out of anger.
By the time I've dressed myself and am ready to go, Sherlock has taken to pacing with his hands behind his back. At least he waited for me.
As I write this, I've decided to leave out the dull days, the ones where nothing pertinent to this story occur. There are far too many of them to count, and considering you all have busy lives, I'll just cut to the chase.
And then there is that new type of morning that starts slowly, warmth enveloping you when you open your eyes to see that face you adore to the tips of your toes.
And I can't take it. I can't handle these thoughts; so instead, I gently calm his frantic movements before lowering the taller man against the sheets. His breathing steadies out as I continue to alleviate him of his shoes and socks, then slip his trousers off, my touch whispering against his smooth skin.
Your eyes follow his hands as he softly undresses you, quiet touches marking his progress. He pulls your trousers off in agonizingly slow movements and you let your head loll back against his pillow, catching a whiff of John Watson embedded there.
This is nothing that needs to be taken further today. It's not demanding. I can hear Sherlock's soft noises as he moves his lips against mine, still not much more than a chaste brush of lips. And it doesn't need to be.
"I…it just…" He stops and rubs a hand through his hair. "There's nothing. Why is it so quiet?" His hand tugs in aggravation and his voice had risen in pitch on that question.
The cold air hitting my bare skin wakes me up abruptly the next morning. Popping open my eyes, I glare up at Sherlock who still holds the covers he's pulled off of me.
Also, I apologize if the Moriarty stuff is just really getting over-milked. I promise it's not going to be all Moriarty-centric like this. :) -C
Finished with my examination, I motion for him to button his shirt back up. "What? Of course you did." How could he forget something like that?
The detective is sitting up, hands braced behind him, breathing heavily and panicked. His legs are twisted tightly in the sheets and his hair is sweaty and disheveled. It's hard to tell in the dark, but for a disorienting moment I think he's shaking. His head jerks in my direction when he hears me.
I blink away some of the fog and look out the window. Multiple cars, all engines running, in an enclosed garage.
John thinks his eyes are about to come out of his head as there's suddenly a very firm grip around a certain part of his anatomy. Slamming a hand against the wall of the shower and trying desperately to avoid collapsing on the floor, he grips the wrist above the assaulting hand. "
He's unhinged, not really making any logical decisions. There is no need for the face bashing and the knife slashing. Or the bitterly cold water.
"I have to do this, Sherlock. Believe it or not, you'll breathe easier, which is what you need right now." I'd really left the wrappings on too long already. He lets go of my wrist and I pull the last bit away, sucking in air as I see the deep bruising and discoloration dotting the detective's chest. "Jesus, it wasn't this bad last night," I say dumbly.
until you nearly scream with pain. He immediately stops and begins to pull back, but then you're really,
"Very," I say sarcastically, looking towards the mantle, which, in fact, is missing its usual resident.
My tossing and turning has moved me to the far side of the bed, so he climbs on his hands and knees across it until he's hovering above me. His lips are soft but cold when they meet mine, and a touch to his hand reveals that they aren't the only part of his body that's cold. He's freezing.
"That's it! John, you're brilliant!" Sherlock suddenly exclaims, jumping up. He runs to the door and grabs his coat and scarf, throwing them on before continuing out.
His eyes drill into mine, silent, staring. Just as I start to get uncomfortable, he murmurs, "Thank you, John."
been like this. There had been no kissing. Scientific observation didn't require the emotional connection kissing brings. It's new. He wants to take it further than just lips pressed against lips, but is that socially acceptable? Must one ask for permission before the process even begins?
"Caring is most assuredly not an advantage, as I've told my bother." He shifts his umbrella into the other hand and swings it around once before continuing. "But with you, John, I don't believe I'd call caring a disadvantage for Sherlock."
This chapter gave me hell. Without the help of dancingtomumfordinmymindpalace, it wouldn't be nearly where it is now. And I'm still not happy with it. Writer's block be damned.
I decided to update early since school starts next week, and Chapter 1 was really just an introductory chapter. Once school starts, I'm still planning on updating every Saturday night.
Suddenly, the fact that they have all the time in the world doesn't seem to matter to the doctor as he desperately attacks the buttons on Sherlock's trousers. The detective manages to get John's belt unbuckled in the same amount of time it takes the smaller man to leave Sherlock's trousers unzipped and ready to be removed.
Sherlock has somehow contorted his body so he has one foot firmly on the floor with the other leg slung precariously around the shorter man's hip. He's shivering and shuddering and it's all John can do not to purposefully slam Sherlock onto the slippery shower floor and take this to a completely different level.
The most miraculous thing about it all is the fact that he seems almost nervous about it. Whether it's the proximity or the embarrassment of actually being injured (which is ridiculous because I'm a doctor and have seen pretty much every stupid injury there is to see), he refuses to make eye contact, and barely speaks.
The heat blazing between you far surpasses what you felt the first time. It's different. Carnal and desperate, yet burning tenderness and the grace that could only be given to you by John Watson.
There are mornings where your alarm clock goes off hours too early for you to be ready after you just spent the entire night chasing bad guys around the streets of London with a madman.
Suddenly, a guy sitting at the bar makes eye contact with Sherlock as the detective walks towards him and jumps up. Before I can blink, we're chasing the man out into the dark streets. Sherlock had a bit of a head start, so I push myself to catch up. Despite this, his dark coat flaps around the corner to an alleyway, still in hot pursuit, leaving me behind. Before I reach the opening to the side street, I hear a loud grunt, fueling me to hurry. Sherlock is lying on the cold ground, trying to stand back up, but it looks like his ribs are killing him.
I'm closer now, pressed firmly between the other man's thighs, and I can feel his breath dancing across my own skin. A hand comes to rest on the side of my neck.
I jog to catch up, nearly missing the cab Sherlock had hailed, and enter. "You know, sometimes it might be nice if you waited."
The cab pulls up to the curb outside 221 Baker Street and we exit. Mrs. Hudson is just inside the door, waiting. "Sherlock, you have a guest."
The detective allows himself to be lowered gently onto John's bed, the doctor's hand softly cupping the back of his head. Fingers with medical precision begin slipping buttons loose on his oxford shirt, and a warm mouth returns to his.
He guides your hands, and you're relieving his body of the uniform with slight tugs and pulls. You reveal the scar and rest your thumb there. It is rough and rigid, not at all your John. It is its own entity. The bad that has happened to this man in front of you. And you hate it. But you don't want John to think you are repulsed by it, and so you lay your mouth there, pressing your lips against it in several brief kisses. Because you can do that now. You can.
I feel him move beneath me, pulling us further up the bed, and then his legs are bent and open, making room for my hips, and we are finally pressed together. I gasp into his neck and he lets out a cry into the air as he throws his head back into the pillow.
be completely over him leaving. He was gone for almost three years before he showed his face again. In that time, I'd done my pathetic part in moving on, no matter how difficult it was. I was working, dating (if two awful, hour-long dates count), and pulling my life back together. It had been horrible, considering the first time I was in need of putting myself together was when I had met Sherlock. He had been the thing to bring me back to life. Hell, he had
—and you twist so you can wrap your arms around his shoulders, burying your face into his soft, soft skin and breathing him in.
wanting, for the longest time. How could he convince John that he wanted to do this because this was John and he...cared for him? That didn't feel like the right word usage. He highly doubted there was a word in the dictionary of all languages that could define Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.
Back in the loo, I study the room we have to work with. The toilet lid was destroyed in one of Sherlock's less…successful experiments, so that's out as a location for him to perch. The sink is low and has a small counter, so I gesture towards it. The angle's a bit awkward, but I think we'll survive.
What he's said suddenly sinks in for me and I find the whole thing ridiculously amusing. I can't stop the laughter that bubbles up.
When he kisses you after, you can taste yourself on his tongue, and once he cleans you both up, you kiss his hands, his arm, his chest, his hip, his ankle, anything you can reach as he crawls back over you and pulls up the covers.
Sherlock's face was tight and pinched as we walked into the dark space opposite the interrogation room. He had refused to wear the splint any longer, and looked slightly pained. He was silent as we waited for them to bring in the men, and when they did, the detective glanced at me before telling Lestrade "Yes" and then whirling out of the room.
and refusing to be ignored. He pushed the dressing gown off of boney shoulders and started at the dress shirt's buttons. Sherlock tried tugging at the hem of his jumper, but at this point he was pretty much useless for the undressing bit and John worked quickly and gently to get them both out of unnecessary amounts of cloth. When they were both down to just their pants, John softly brushed Sherlock's blatant arousal through the material.
This has to be the poor girl's murderer. He smells like Mrs. Hudson, too, although I don't know what that means. Sherlock must have figured it out before rushing out of the flat earlier.
"You need to take it easy. Just for a couple of days. He at least bruised your ribs." I stand up, heading to the medicine cabinet to get pain relievers.
"John." He whispers it so silently it's a miracle I even heard. His large palm is resting against his forehead, covering one eye, and the other is closed.
About a half hour before, I had loaded him up on painkillers I had on hand and they were starting to take their effect on Sherlock. He actually chuckles a couple of times as I adjust pillows around him.
I move his legs from my shoulders and he hooks his ankles together behind my back as I reapply another generous amount of lube to my hand. It's a relief when I finally touch myself, letting a little of the pressure that had become nearly unbearable ebb away, but it's quickly not enough. I line myself up before grabbing Sherlock's trembling wrist.
You watch intently as John straightens the sleeves on his old uniform. He's going to an army friend's wedding. Their entire unit is dressing in uniform. You think it's ridiculous.
"Sherlock." My hand strays to the curly mass in front of my face. "Sherlock, wake up. I need you to breathe for me."
Still holding the warm towel to his face with his injured hand, Sherlock crouches and opens the cupboard below the sink and retrieves a mug, handing it to me. I fill it with hot water and place the brush in it to soak.
He was well aware that his hand was incredibly unsteady as he reached up to press John's hovering hand to his own cheek. Letting his eyes slide shut, he felt the callused palm of his doctor graze the smooth skin on his face. He held back a shudder as John's thumb brushed lightly over his cheekbone.
I'm surprised when, a few moments later, I hear the bustling and clatters that come with preparation for a fire.
John comes violently and abruptly, without warning, shouting Sherlock's name and spilling into him. He's blinded by the white that clouds his vision for a moment before he realizes Sherlock had come as well.
I'm not sure how long, because I'm honestly too worried about Sherlock to pay attention to trivial things such as time. He has the more severe case of poisoning between us.
This is when I notice his lack of enthusiasm. Normally, a case brings the light to Sherlock's eyes and he becomes the animated version of himself. Delighted Sherlock, if you will.
Sherlock has his head leaned back against his chair, his injury prohibiting him from assuming his usual prayer-like state of rest. "Those five seconds are important," he says, voice low.
The next morning as I leave the flat (after waking up to find Sherlock gone), there is a black sedan waiting in front of 221. Sighing, I climb in and watch the passing scenery as the driver takes me to another abandoned factory. Anthea taps away on her phone, not even looking up as I exit the vehicle. Mycroft greets me with a cold, feigned smile, umbrella in hand.
Sherlock's hand flailed wide and John caught it and brought it to his chest. Sherlock began rubbing his hands experimentally all over the rough scars of John's sternum. It distracted him enough for John to finish preparing him and then he was there, ready. He really didn't want to break Sherlock but he was afraid he would. And it was too late.
Tilting your head back, you're relieved when you feel his fingers thread into your hair, and you shift your weight and lean until you can rest your head against him.
Sherlock wakes up with a splitting headache and finds a glass of water on his bedside table, along with a bottle of paracetamol.
Ten minutes later, he's pounding on my door, yelling for me to hurry up. I've made do with a few smaller items of clothes I'd fit in before the army, hoping that subtle was good enough in this case. When I open the door, however, I realize Sherlock has
I stand near Lestrade as Sherlock goes about his usual observations. It's unusually cold out today and my fingers are all but numb in my gloves. I'm extraordinarily grateful when Donovan comes over with two cups of piping hot coffee. The steam from the cup creates a foggy barrier between my eyes and Sherlock's as he glances up. His eyes narrow briefly, then he's back to studying the victim, Abigale Rochester. He probably doesn't even recognize the biting cold that is turning his nose and ears pink.
You're not slow now. You're needy. Your hands move insistently to slip the t-shirt he has on up and over his head. He helps and throws it far away before returning to relieve you of yours.
Grappling for the condom and lube, John slowly moved back to position. Sherlock's legs immediately wrapped back around him. The detective was reaching for him with long fingers and John allowed himself to be pulled to Sherlock, who planted sweet, delicate, desperate kisses all along his mouth, face, and shoulders.
I hit his prostate again and the reaction is overwhelming. His entire upper body lurches off of the bed and he grabs me, wrapping his arms around my ribcage and keeping us both vertical, forcing my knees further into the mattress.
He doesn't care about such things, the man with the turned up collar. The one with the military bearing seems the opposite of his companion. Quiet, steady, with a touch of steel strengthening his spine, one would rue the day they crossed this man, and yet he maintains the persona of a friendly sort.
Sometimes, when he's speaking, saying something dull and normal, your mind locks the words in a loop inside your head, mulling over and embracing the honeyed phrases until you can feel yourself drowning.
I glance up from my bowl of pasta. Sherlock is sitting in his usual seat at Angelo's, looking out the window at nothing in particular. He's vacantly fiddling with the corner of his napkin, lounged in his chair in a way that shouldn't be possible for legs that long. He hasn't stolen the tomatoes on my side salad yet.
John notes the slightly slumped posture of his friend. There is no way the deep cut in his shoulder isn't giving him a hell of a lot of pain. "Yes. Brilliant. But I don't really have the most desirable tools or location to take care of this." Carefully, he begins cleaning the wound. The detective's breath hitches, but otherwise he remains silent under John's hands. "Knife?"
He still makes noises when he kisses, even if it's slow. I can hear and feel the soft snuffs of his breath as his hand tries to tangle into my short hair. His hand is so large it nearly cups the entire occipital and parietal parts of my skull, and even though it should be
John chuckles and goes to get his keys. This is the mad bastard's way of apologizing. Plans for a walk forgotten, he tucks his gun into the waist of his jeans. Time to play bodyguard.
Outside the wall is an assortment of people from different walks of life. There is a mother herding her children away from the scene, a tall man from a higher social class, reporters from every news channel around, and a group of young people with camera phones eager to see the gruesome sight.
Sherlock mounts the stairs steadily, not rushing up as he often does. I notice, and am a bit wary. The taller man pushes the door open and steps inside.
Sherlock was sure he was breaking in half. He opened his mouth to tell John, but all that came out was a choking sob.
I study Sherlock's still form. He's been like this for the past day, unmoving and unseeing. It is now a familiar posture for me to observe, but I worry about my flatmate. Where a usually passive expression resides on Sherlock's face, it is a slightly distressed one there now. A worry line creates a crease on his smooth forehead.
Being the one lying here, getting the privilege of actually watching Sherlock Holmes at his most vulnerable state, is overwhelming. It starts in the pit of my stomach and grows until my entire body is infused with warmth.
John pauses in his ministrations to hold the heated eye contact. "I had to wonder when you stormed out of the flat
I hope this chapter was okay. Very soon, the rating for this fic will be changing to M (and soon after that, to E), so here's your fair warning. :)
I don't get to see him until much later, when he's hooked up to oxygen in a bed with a hospital gown that makes him look small, fragile, and childlike. The
Sherlock mirrors John's movements, and leans against the back of the sofa, drawing the doctor with him. The new position causes John to shift in the taller man's lap and Sherlock breaks the kiss with a gasp.
Grabbing a bottle of whiskey from the kitchen, along with two glasses, I make my way into the sitting room. I find Sherlock lounging on the sofa. He's not in his mind palace, I can tell, and he has his hands folded neatly on top of his flat stomach. When I get closer, he raises a hand and I hand him the tumbler. I sit on the coffee table and begin filling our glasses.
I did all my research about shaving with a straight razor online since I am, in fact, a girl and don't know anybody that uses one. So once again, any errors in that department are the internet's fault.
My lips tug at his bottom one and his mouth opens, a hot tongue tentatively brushing against my own mouth. He whimpers and moves closer on the counter, long legs still firmly linked behind my back, but amidst the wiggling he had scooted to the edge of the sink bowl itself, and, with one misplaced move, he falls into it.
Chuckling lightly, I look up and meet his gaze. His eyes are barely crinkling around the edges with amusement. "Wanker," I say fondly.
John quickly went and got a damp cloth and cleaned them both up, then pulled Sherlock upright until they were in their previous position, long legs wrapped languidly around his waist. Sherlock leaned forward and pushed his nose into John's neck. John had an arm wrapped around the bony frame, holding his...lover?...upright, and a hand in the luxurious curls.
I try to pull some air into my lungs as the laughter fades. Motioning in his direction, I say, "You're just so worked up. I thought there was a death, or Moriarty was back, or something equally as bad." I chuckle again, a hideous sound that's entirely too girly for my liking. "And it's all over your…your…
Presently, John realized his eyes had drifted closed and the noises from kitchen had stopped. Jerking back to attention, ready to dodge flying body parts if need be, he stared right into two impossible eyes.
He caught Sherlock's head before it could slam into the wooden floor as the detective let out a sound that made John glad Mrs. Hudson wasn't at home. Sherlock's brow was furrowed, forming a distressed little wrinkle above his nose. He pushed in a little further, looking for the one spot...
I look up from where I had been studying the dark contents of my cup. We haven't talked much since his outburst the night before. Fortunately, Lestrade had texted us this morning about a new case before the tension between us could explode in our faces. "Hm?"
For long minutes, he holds you and brushes his wise, wise hands across your skin, calming you until a few of the shattered pieces have found each other again. You don't want him to leave—here, now, then, tomorrow, a year, a lifetime,
. But that doesn't bother you, so this time you do kiss him on the mouth. His touch is like fire, lighting you up and incinerating you with every stroke, brush, taste. His tongue invades your own mouth and you respond in kind.
I snort and continue scratching out details of this case on a notepad, trying to make my doctor's handwriting legible despite the movement of the train.
You feel it building. You're suddenly standing on the edge of a cliff about to jump, and the feeling is so completely
I hold out a hand for Sherlock before stepping into the warm shower, pulling him in behind me. I position him so he's getting the majority of the heat, never letting go of his hand. After a few moments, I reach for his shampoo.
Your hands have begun to explore, running cautiously over his chest, past the slight hardness of his nipples, down his soft middle.
There are mornings when a certain DI barges into your flat telling you that your flatmate has, once again, gotten himself into a shit-load of trouble.
So far, the only connection between the two are where Sherlock's hand is touching and John is gripping Sherlock's wrist. "You, with your fucking inordinately protective deeds and singing in the bloody damn shower. What did you expect?"
That should definitely be annoying, but it isn't. It's comfortable. You have lived with John Watson for three years, six months, and fourteen days (you don't have the hour memorized because you're not
You hum in response and turn further until you are practically kneeling into the cushions beside him. You lift your head and blink at him. Eyes that were once riveted to the screen are now completely focused on you, dark and needy in the dim flickering of light coming from the television set.
As for myself, I'm afraid my nerve endings are about to combust. The feeling of being inside him with
Here's Chapter 1, like I promised! This story is basically following the progression of Sherlock and John's relationship from friends to lovers as I see fit to write it, so if that's not your cup of tea, turn back now. :)
Taking a deep, calming breath through my nose, I sniff the girl's wrist. "It smells like Mrs. Hudson," I say, surprised and a little disconcerted.
"It's so much," he's whispering. Our chests are pressed together and I have both hands on his face, stroking the dark skin beneath his eyes. "Everything is just," he waves an arm helplessly, "
Tonight when I get home, he has an experiment going. I have absolutely no idea what it is, nor do I care to know. Something boils on the stove while he studies a slide on the microscope, so I decide the kitchen will be out of commission for the evening.
Standing, I pull off my own clothes, aware of Sherlock's heavy gaze on me as I strip until only pants remain. Then, slowly, I kneel down, doing my best to ignore Sherlock's quick inhalation at my new position.
Sherlock's brow is painted with a light sheen of sweat and he shoves his mop of hair away from his forehead as his breathing begins to even out again. "Bloody hell," he mutters, staring at the ceiling.
I hear him moving, and this is just another step in the natural progression of things. Just another thing we've never gotten around to doing, because that time in the bathroom doesn't count. Not really.
Sherlock is still in the same position he was in last night—sitting on the floor and facing the fireplace—before I'd drifted off to dreamland.
Chuckling ruefully, I take a pull on the burning liquid. "I'm not even sure I was going to successfully move on." When I look up, Sherlock is staring at me with an unreadable expression. I sigh. "I just… Sherlock, are you okay?"
They're close now, the air between them charged. There's a step between them neither is willing to take, not tonight. Perhaps not ever.
as he normally would. He had phrased it a bit more like a request. Though that request still brooked no argument, it was unusual wording for the man.
Sherlock barely says two words to her as he examines the body, his back stiff. Lestrade stands next to me and we give him space as he scuttles about the corpse, a bit like a ghost crab.
John appears much more accomplished in this area and soon has Sherlock reduced to a mound of groaning, clutching flesh, John's poor self sorely abandoned. That's when the detective finally seeks out John's mouth, and then they're kissing.
He follows me, holding that towel to his face and looking absolutely ridiculous in an endearing, boyish way. He sits at the table and watches me move about the kitchen. The man's skin is probably well enough prepared to go under the blade, no matter how gruesome that sounds, but he doesn't say anything. I don't make him a cup, and only take two sips of mine before setting it back on the counter.
"We'll make do," he pants, moving his hands all along my upper chest now, cataloging and categorizing despite the splint, pausing only slightly when his thumb brushes my scar. His eyes lift back up. They would be sad if he decided to show the emotions behind that flushed face. "Is it not good of me to be grateful for the bullet that did this?" he murmurs.
"John," he says desperately, throwing his head back and exposing his throat. When I see his face, I nearly choke out a sound myself. His eyes are wide and shot full of desperate need, want, hope,
uninteresting. Complete with the sheath (if that's what you could call it) of their own skin clutched in their hands. They had been brutally murdered, really. Mutilation was a very light word for what had been done to those poor souls.
My fingers seek out his shirt buttons quickly, making quick work of the first two before straying, as Sherlock's own hand moves to my hip. His grip is fierce and will probably leave bruises and I think to myself:
Slowly, not wanting to alarm the terrified detective, I wrap my hand around the delicate wrist close to my body.
"Sherlock, look at me," I say firmly. His eyes are open and pure and heartbreakingly honest. I gentle my voice. "This is different than a few fingers. It's going to be tight and a bit uncomfortable. If anything hurts,
Sherlock's breathing is much more labored than I'd like it to be as I reach out and gently pull the injured arm towards me. I cradle it because reality has set in and this is precious. "Sherlock, it's okay."
But then John's moving. Sherlock is looking directly at him as he slowly makes his way across the room, but the visual input isn't computing with his swimming brain. It's as if the transport and the mind are completely disconnected.
You wait for it to fill you, the release of the crushing pressure against your chest that threatens to tear you apart, but it doesn't come.
Oh, but he wanted to. He wanted to so. Very. Badly. He struggled for a moment before John leaned forward and captured his mouth in a searing, deep kiss that took what little air he had left right out of his lungs. And when he pulled away, he pushed further in, easing against the detective's prostate, and Sherlock fell apart.
Somewhere in the recesses of your mind, perhaps the bit that isn't built into your mind palace—the sentiment?—you realize that tonight is different. Different from all nights prior. John is different, and you are different. London is different. The stars out of the reach of your vision are different. Everything, everything, everything.
"Every time you go out on one of your mad dashes without me, I wait until you get home before going up to bed." Now he does put down the paper, meeting the detective's sharp eyes. "I can't sleep without knowing you're okay."
The next day had been slightly tense at first, almost as if we were both trying to feel each other out. I had been up for several hours before Sherlock snuck out of his room.
John seems to regain some use of his vocal cords. "What the hell do you think you're doing?" It comes out with much less force than intentioned.
His head drops and our cheeks brush, his curls tickling my forehead and ear. I turn my head to say something, but…
He's sitting low, knees resting lightly against the seat in front of him. His injured arm is cradled against his chest, and he looks so very breakable that my throat aches. He's made of a deceptive form of glass—seemingly strong, and for the most part
I'm tired. Bone-weary, really. My skin hums with the need for sleep. The heat from the fire gradually seeps into the room, casting a warm glow over everything, making the skull look ominous in shadows, and it doesn't take long before my body has melted into my chair.
The drug had made my limbs heavy, but I still join the search of a way to get out. Sherlock, too, looks as though his arms and legs are weaker than usual. He kicks at a window, but there's not enough force behind it.
It's rough, not at all tender, as if he's trying to meld our mouths together. He doesn't try to take it any further than lips against lips, and for a brief moment of clarity, I wonder if he's ever kissed someone before. It's sloppy, uncoordinated. Everything Sherlock isn't.
Tonight, however, Sherlock Holmes is hunched over. His head hangs low, elbows braced against his pyjama-clad knees. He's found Mrs. Hudson's hidden cigarette stash. I can smell it in the air. The glowing end of the cigarette is dimming as it rests loosely in his graceful fingers.
His shoulders shudder, curls quivering against his forehead. It takes me a moment to realize he's laughing. Bitter. Empty. Hollow.
It takes a little time, but soon John is fully sheathed in the tight muscles of Sherlock's body. They both moan, and when Sherlock involuntarily bucks his hips, he lets out a rough sob.
"At least put on some bloody pants," I grumble, falling out of the other side of the bed. Belatedly, I realize I'm in Sherlock's room, so I stumble my way to the stairs and up to my own room, where I throw on a fresh pair of pants and a pair of pyjama bottoms.
So now, I sit on the edge of the coffee table across from Sherlock as I wrap his ribcage. Sherlock is mumbling gibberish about how long it takes ribs to heal and isn't it
Thank you to anyone who ever commented, favorited, or followed Turning of the Tide. Also, thanks so much to everyone who supported me so kindly during my hiatus.
I stare, unblinking, at the man in front of me. What does he mean by this? "What are you saying?" I ask quietly.
something that flatmates do (especially when said flatmates are two blokes), but at some undefined moment I had looked down at the clothes in my hands as I unloaded the washer and realized the pyjama bottoms weren't mine. I don't really mind. Most of Sherlock's clothes go to the cleaners anyway.
John presses a warm kiss to your neck as he pulls you impossibly closer, still whispering calming assurances, and it's almost enough.
He leaves and I relieve myself before letting him back in. Silently, he moves about, collecting his straight razor, cream, brush, and a flannel, which he soaks with hot water and squeezes out before wrapping it against his face.
Sherlock leaned down until their foreheads almost touched, his dark curls tickling John's brow. "No."
Now, several years later and a lot more water under the bridge, I find myself in a similar situation, albeit in reverse. Unsurprisingly, Sherlock is quite attention-grabbing for others in the place, and he has to thwart several efforts before I take matters into my own hands, literally, and link our fingers before dragging him to a semi-secluded table in the back of the bar. I push him toward the chair that has a better view of the entire room and claim the other myself.
Sherlock wasn't sure what he had expected. He'd never really kissed someone before. Not the way he knew John was going to kiss him. Pecks on the lips, cheeks; that, he was used to. He'd never wanted anything more. But as John's lips brushed his, he wanted
I hold myself up on shaky arms, both of us panting and breathing in the same air as we try to recover. I hadn't climaxed like that in ages, more from my partner's release than from my own, and it is
You are trying to eliminate the scenarios that are the least likely to have success (bursting into the bathroom as he relieves himself, walking into his room while he's undressing, waiting until he's asleep and then sneaking up into his room and watching him until he wakes up), when you feel a light brush of fingertips against the curls at the nape of your neck. He murmurs a
It feels as if his entire body wraps around me then as he pulls me so that my back is against his chest. We're sitting on the cold tile floor, both soaking wet and shivering, and I have absolutely no desire to move. Not sure I can, really.
A large part of me is inclined to believe it was just the prospect of losing me hitting Sherlock hard in the face with a frying pan that caused him to lip-assault me like that. But honestly, Sherlock Holmes
If there's anything to say about Doctor John Watson, it's that he has the incredibly unexpected talent of connecting notes and sounds together in a form that is not only pleasant, but
Again, after Sherlock was gone and I found myself alone, things had been in gray scale. I had once more convinced myself there would be no going back.
I got the title for this chapter from the American novel of the same name written by Alice Walker. The title is the only thing they have in common, however. :) I apologize for the brevity of this one.
Sherlock glares daggers at me as I lean down to help him ease into a standing position so he can walk to his room. I had been right; the walk to his room isn't fun
I begin walking him backwards, guiding him blindly to the wall beside the doorway to his room and pressing him against it. His breath staggers and he throws his head back, exposing that—
had been more or less monumental. And horribly revealing, I believe. It also left me awfully confused, on so many levels. Where do I even start? Straight man, previously assumed asexual man, near-death experience, last-minute rescue...
Neither of us moves at first, but I can feel Sherlock's toes flexing beneath the blankets and know it's only a matter of minutes before he's ready to get up.
The detective was on his knees in front of the doctor, hand on John's thigh, looking up into his much darker eyes. "John, I'm bored."
he lets out a mirthless laugh, "and then this morning I wake up to find out I used you as a human pillow last night, and my
John's deep blue irises stare into Sherlock's for a long moment, in wonder. "And people think you can't be romantic," he whispers.
Shaking his head, Sherlock tangles his fingers with John's, not really knowing how to convince him that he doesn't mind. "You took a knife wound done in anger and stitched over it with care. You changed that scar from a mark of failure to a mark of John Watson, and it will always be there. Part of me."
I'm tired and it's been a long day and I am in no mood for Sherlock's half-baked responses. Marching to the coatrack, I put on my own jacket before pulling down Sherlock's coat and scarf. Returning to the detective, I pull the scarf around his neck and throw the coat over his head.
Greg nods as he bags the bracelet Sherlock has discovered. He's used to Sherlock's abrupt exits by now.
What he saw on that beloved face crippled him. Wonder, relief, hope, innocence. It was all there. Every last drop of emotion Sherlock kept from the outside world was bleeding into every pore of his skin in front of John, rapidly letting the walls fall away until he was just a man, until they were two men sitting in their living room floor about to do something that would shatter the walls of friendship.
I glance up from my laptop. Sherlock has his legs crossed, resting the bow back across his shoulder as he cradles his violin. "I think any fancy for it was effectively extinguished at the pool with Moriarty." I shake my head. "Gottle o' geer isn't quite so amusing anymore."
For one terrifying moment, John thought he was going to be sick. A kaleidoscope of feelings slammed into his chest, making it difficult to breathe. This man. This gorgeous, arrogant, brilliant man was sitting in his lap, looking at him with a gaze so heartbreakingly pure that he was forced to face how blatantly
What happened to the John Watson that ran through the streets of London, chasing a cab with a person he barely knew, for the thrill of it?
Sherlock pulls off my shirt with his good hand, grunting in frustration when the cuffs catch against my wrists.
"Yes." He presses his palm flat against my abdomen where I have a dark bruise from being shoved over the edge of the tub.
I open my eyes to be faced with the plain white expanse of the bed beside me. There's a blanket and sheets and the escaping duvet, but no curly-haired detective. The glaring numbers on the clock beside my head tell me it's barely three in the morning as I push back the thin sheet covering my legs and pull on my pyjama bottoms before shuffling out of my room and down the stairs.
I have a rather dull name. John. So many people have the name John. It's not a special name. It's not very memorable. I would have liked to have a better name if my mother had let me choose.
The stroking becomes more insistent and you ease yourself into a steadier pattern of breathing. Your hips stutter a brief moment before you inadvertently thrust forward. John gasps and pulls you closer with his other arm until you can feel the bulge of his cock beneath you.
I wake up the next morning to find him smoking. He has the window cracked, and breathes out into the crisp city air. His dressing gown drapes over his skeletal form as he lounges against the window, and his cheeks hollow out as he takes a deep pull on the clandestine cigarette.
He doesn't make a sound as he climbs the stairs, just a silhouette in the doorway as he steps in. I haven't slept at all, and it's nearing on midnight. I can see the shadow of a cheekbone as the moonlight drifting in reflects off pale skin.
At last, he gets up and pulls on his coat, fixing his scarf the way he likes it as well. I flip off the stove and he glares at me, but I don't let it scare me off. Sherlock Holmes is just a thirty-something-year-old bully.
There's a long moment of silence, so I glance up. He's staring at me blankly, almost as if he's trying to pick apart a puzzle of some sort.
Sherlock sits near my feet with his arms wrapped around his drawn-up legs. At some point, he had scooted close enough to rest his head on the edge of the chair, and his back is barely brushing my calf.
I keep my touch gentle as my fingertips lightly brush against the underside of his jaw, urging his gaze up until it reaches mine again.
This time, a sob does escape, and you cling to John so fiercely, you're afraid you'll injure him. You're pretty sure this isn't how you are supposed to feel after sex. Wrecked, broken,
to face, I'm not entirely sure we fully realize they are there. But our dynamic has changed. The atmosphere surrounding us has shifted.
He turns to me, finally. He looks agitated and restless in a way that could lead to a much worse night than it is right now.
His muscles are stiff and unyielding against my loose embrace. Despite his relaxed appearance, he is tense to his core.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. "I'm naked, standing next to you in a shower, with an erection of monumental standards. What does it
He's quiet for a very long moment as he stares at our fingers. "You…" He pauses and clears his throat. "Yes." It's a whisper, almost awed.
"We have a case, John. Get up." He tosses the covers onto the floor and walks out before I can pull my gun on him.
He shivers as my fingers slip down to the band of his pants, and I bring our mouths together in a hopefully calming kiss. We're pressed together, his naked arousal to my clothed one, and his trembling is worse.
John wasn't sure Sherlock realized how much noise he was making. Gasps and whimpers and cries and little kitten-like mewls that made John more protective than anything.
But the bad days? Those are the most difficult times to watch him. His mind devours him, tortures him, flings him around in a tornado of thought and mercilessly drops him onto a bed of spikes. There isn't much to do about it, hardly any way to relieve it. Usually, he either lies on the sofa curled up, or locks himself in his room. Sometimes, if I'm sitting on the sofa myself, he'll curl up beside me with his head against my thigh. That doesn't happen often, but it seems to placate him in a way that nothing else does. It's flattering, in a horrible, I'm-quite-flattered-but-it's-not-worth-seeing-you- like-this kind of manner.
Inhaling deeply, I turn on my side, simultaneously pressing Sherlock over and onto his back. He lets out a quiet sigh as I nose the sheets lower until I can nuzzle into his smooth belly. I press my lips there lazily, tasting the slight tang from our activities the night before, and then rub Eskimo kisses into the velvety skin until he begins to squirm. With a smile, I move back up and press another kiss to his shoulder.
The detective glances at the mess at my feet and then up at me. "Mycroft's condition has made the inevitable, tangible."
Days pass with very little said. John goes to work, and Sherlock stays home. Experiments are dormant, and the Belstaff abides on its hook. The blog is left inactive, and the telly remains off.
On the fourth day, while John is still at work, Sherlock receives a text from Lestrade and leaves the flat without a second thought.
The walls of 221B echo with your combined noises—gasps, cries, keens, moans—and you barely have the presence of mind to hope to
"You would have gone first, you daft wanker!" I grit out, because this is too much. Today has been too much. This past
There's more curse words in that sentence than John has ever heard Sherlock speak at once, and he wonders distantly if a filter has been shut off somewhere.
Sherlock picks up his wine glass for the first time that night and drinks a good portion before pulling it away from his lips and studying it. "Mortality."
"Stop talking," I grit out, reaching for the fastenings to get him one garment closer to being naked.
"No, John. Listen." He takes a sip, then sits up, swiveling until we're almost knee-to-knee. "Everything has been different since I came back. I know that. I threw the proverbial wrench in your plan for moving on—"
No. Nope. Taking a profound breath, I quickly shove that day away into the deepest recesses of my mind.
Pulling his skin taut with my right hand, I begin the tedious task of removing facial hair with a blade.
You become aware of those very eyes on you in that moment, concern etching different lines into his face.
Sherlock is silent as I poke and prod at his ribs once more. I fear at least one of them might be cracked again. He still has an angry red print from the man's boot on his pale chest. He has sensitive skin. The stupid purple shirt had been a bloody pain to get off of him without hurting too terribly, and the idiot wouldn't let me cut it.
the consulting detective hadn't suffered from any injuries. By the time he was "completely sure" nothing was wrong with his friend, Sherlock was burdened with the first appearance of the Problem. Thank God for long coats.
He moves to shift positions and clasps a hand against his head. "Dizzy." Some invisible thing snaps as he slumps into the seat, nearly boneless. Resigned.
When he returns late that night, John is in his chair with a tumbler of whiskey held loosely in his fingertips, the bottle sitting on the floor beside him.
Sherlock has an arm wrapped around my chest, and with my free hand I grip his forearm tightly. "Sherlock," I breathe, panting in deep pulls of air. "Sherlock." There's not really a reason to say his name, but it grounds me, helps me realize the severity of the situation and all that could have been lost. I say it simply because I still can.
"You two doing okay, then?" Lestrade asks suddenly, pulling my thoughts away from comparing Sherlock to crustaceans.
but he'd gone and gotten three of his ribs broken. He sounds awful, his breathing wheezing slightly, but he had refused to go to the hospital. He insisted I knew how to do it well enough and I could take care of it myself.
"I'm sorry, Sherlock," I murmur, because it's my turn to apologize. "I am so sorry." Sorry for everything.
I gulp down some wine, wishing I could take back what I had said and wipe the hurt expression off of Sherlock's face. "
"John," he breathes. Nothing more needs to be said. That's the way things are with Sherlock Holmes and John Watson. Understanding doesn't always come in the form of verbal communication.
By the time I've made it to the bathroom, Sherlock has done what I've asked and is wearing a loose pair of pyjama pants, slung so low on his hips that a slight V is visible. Where the man's muscle comes from, I've no clue.
Angelo's is quiet when we arrive, as we've preceded the evening rush. Angelo comes out smiling and places a candle on our table (as usual), something I've given up protesting. Without asking, he brings what we always order, and Sherlock barely eats a bite of his own food (as usual) and picks the tomatoes off my side salad instead (as usual).
We're in the back of a Land Rover, parked in a large garage as far as I can tell. Sherlock has already clambered up front and is messing with the doors frantically.
Without hesitation, the watcher jabs a needle into the man's arm and watches as the startled expression relaxes to one of confused disillusionment. "I believe you can, doctor."
"I'm fully aware!" I say as I head back towards the front door. "We're going out, Sherlock. I'm not taking no for an answer this time!"
I look at him a moment, then, instead of responding, I reach behind him and wet the same flannel he used before with cool water before patting his face with it. Aftershave is next, and the man smells
I realize I'm holding his hand. More importantly, he's clinging to mine. With a gentle squeeze, I rest our twined hands on his knee. "But it's good, isn't it? Isn't it nice to have a rest?"
With a jerky nod, he holds his arms up and I let myself be pulled closer by the lanky man beneath me. His bones are small and fragile beneath my touch as I place a hand against his hip. And then…
Sherlock clears his throat and takes a deep, painful breath before continuing. "I never apologized for leaving you the way I did. I let you think I didn't care, that I was so selfish I couldn't live with being seen as a fake. That it meant more to me than any person."
The ride home is inexplicably tense. Neither one of us says one thing, but I can feel the agitation radiating from the lithe man beside me. His right hand is in a splint, the sling abandoned as soon as we left the hospital.
I cry. Not often, but I do. I cried when the nightmares of Afghanistan were too much. I cried when Sherlock took the plunge off the roof. I cried at his gravesite and I cried after he returned. Now, I don't usually have reasons to cry, but that doesn't stop me from waking up in the middle of the night with a wet face after re-living the day from hell, when I watched Sherlock's lithe body lean forward, arms spread, and plummet to the hard concrete. I almost always cry with those dreams. Messy, ridiculous tears will stain my face and dampen my pillow. I rarely make a sound, that I'm aware of. (After all, I'm sure if I cried out in my sleep, Sherlock would be sure to alert me to such behavior with a rude
I straighten and flip the lamp off, the only light in the room being the silvery pathway coming from the crack of the door. "Okay. Call if you need anything."
Sherlock shifted so he was now sitting cross-legged on the floor in front of the sofa. "That's not it, John."
And maybe this isn't the time or place for grand revelations, but I realize that every day pushes Sherlock closer and closer to the time that he really
There's the sound of feet on the staircase and then the door opens, revealing a short man with graying hair and smiling eyes. "Can I help you?"
You come entirely too quickly, with a tiny whimper, and you're embarrassed. You bury your face into John's neck so he can't see your burning cheeks and how much of a wreck you are.
It's what they've been telling me for the past several…hours? minutes? days? I hadn't believed a word, not even Mycroft's. Not until I could see him myself. And he is okay.
Slowly, I make my way further into the room. I notice the pack of cigarettes lying at his feet, contents spilled out as if it had been brutally torn apart by a desperate creature. My gaze slides back to Sherlock and I know this to be true.
In retrospective, you and John have only done the bare minimum of sex. Nothing past one night of alternating between hand and mouth.
I am SO sorry this is so late. I got home late last night and didn't have the energy to post. Hopefully this chapter makes up for the delay.
habit of his and you turn to snap a lashing comment at him when he stands on tiptoes and presses his lips to yours. In the four seconds that your lips touch, you hear the silent exchange going on between the two of you.
The smaller man continues his journey until he's standing between Sherlock's legs, and, without hesitation, gently straddles the detective's hips.
For days, you simply study him more than you ever did before. You watch his habits, his movements. You watch what he eats and what he says. You take notice to what he likes and what he doesn't like. You notice when Lestrade says something ridiculous and the lines on John's face strain against laughter. You observe how John watches out for Mrs. Hudson, checking in on her every night. You see how John tries to make Molly feel good about herself after you insult her.
John thrusts again, deep. Once, twice, three times and then he's more than inside you, he's a part of you.
"You are welcome to think whatever you like about how I remember that time, but I will tell you now, nothing about it was
You hear a door click shut in the echoes of your mind and realize John has left. Bringing palms together beneath your chin, you stare blankly and continue analyzing all that had happened in the past week.
Setting down the drinks, I clap a hand over the stranger's shoulder. "Hey, mate. Sorry, I beat you to him."
His free hand finds your cheek and tilts your head up, but he doesn't tell you to open your eyes, and you're glad. He's letting you keep the darkness and that's nice.
mind, he decides that if he's getting off at the hand of his flatmate, he might as well return the favor.
During the night, I had turned away from Sherlock, so now I slowly move to bury my face in the soft curls beside me. Eyes sliding shut, I breathe in the scent of this madman I've entangled my life—and now body—with. The arm pressed into the mattress by Sherlock's body has easy access to his smooth shoulder, and I spend idle moments stroking the soft skin there, resting in the honeyed morning light.
Sherlock blinks. Raises his head. This is the most John has spoken past "Pass the knife" or "Where's the jam?" in several days.
John makes a noise and it takes you a moment to recognize your own name again. His breath is quick and slightly labored as his hands now turn to guide you and then you're seated in his lap, legs straddling his hips, and he's looking up at you with such open adoration that you think to yourself
"Yes, John,"he utters quietly, neck arching and breath catching as my fingers lightly dance down the expanse of his chest.
I don't expect him to look at me. I expect him to huff and brush off my question like every other time I've asked. But he doesn't.
"It stopped again. Oh, god. John, you stopped it again." He lets out a breath on a dry sob and cradles my head in his arms as he wraps them around me.
The detective gasps at the action and feels as though he's melting into the mattress beneath him. The buckle on John's belt bites into his hip bone as the doctor leans up to kiss him in a slow, intimate movement of lips, teeth, and tongues.
"It's okay, everything's fine." I place a hand over his shoulder, try to push him back, but he won't move. "Sherlock, we're fine."
Instead, you watch as he leans across you and begins rummaging in a nearby drawer. Your mind is foggy and slow and it takes you an embarrassingly long time to realize what it is he is reaching for. Now, it's blatantly obvious as he slicks his fingers.
He shrugs delicately, swallows his tea. Smug bastard hadn't spilt a drop during our bout of near-hysterics. I, on the other hand, hadn't been so fortunate. "Nothing as of yet. Perhaps Lestrade will call with a case."
"John." He heaves in a breath. "John, talk to me. I've never…" He drifts off as I press more tiny kisses below his ear. "I don't know what to do."
The detective pulls in air slowly and painfully and my heart sinks at the pained expression on my flatmate's face.
I shake my head slightly at the expression on his pale face. "That's not a good way to treat this whole thing. You destroyed my life after you left. You can't just act like it's an annoying little occurrence in the basement of your mind palace." I sigh and pour my tea. It's the middle of the night and not the time for this conversation.
I've just made it to the end of my drink when Sherlock abruptly stands up and throws his coat back on, shoving the scarf in his pocket. "That's our man."
"It was the pink nail varnish, the sodding pink nail varnish. How could I have missed it, how? It was right there,
You realize your other hand is fisted into John's shirt, slightly gripping the skin beneath. But he doesn't complain.
The looks were quieter, the giggles deeper, the mood more sober. The post-case high was still there, but in a different form. Words were spoken in slight touches of a hand to a shoulder, or a visual connection between blue eyes and fathomless ones.
But then his hand falls away from you and you don't understand. You brush your own hand against his swollen flesh and he groans, so you do it again.
John just grins and begins unbuttoning his own shirt, watching Sherlock watch him. For the detective's expression, a person would think John was giving him a strip tease. Once he has this shirt off, Sherlock all but rips the vest off of him, and then they're almost,
Startled and self-conscious, John stands with the water running over him, mouth still poised to release the notes coming from his throat—
"John, I am quite capable of unbuttoning my own trousers," he forces out, panting and barely writhing as my knuckles brush a severely low patch of skin on his stomach.
"We both have them now," John says, almost sadly, placing a warm kiss over the angry skin. "I'm sorry I couldn't prevent the scar."
He glances around the room quickly, tension radiating from him. "My head. The flat. The street. Everything. John!" His eyes snap up to mine. The panic I read there does nothing to calm my nerves. "What's wrong with me?"
It's extremely early and the sun isn't even up yet. I've only been asleep for a couple of hours, but waking up to the sight of Sherlock curled on his side, face slack with sleep, makes the lack of rest worth it. Those bow lips are plump and pouty, pale skin nearly translucent in the delicate light making its way from the fading moon. The fingers of one hand are barely brushing my side, just his fingertips pressing against my skin, and that's all the contact we have. It seems like Sherlock. Not one to cuddle, but in need of maintaining contact. It's rather lovely.
than flatmates. At least, conventionally. There has been an underlying feeling of connection since that first day in Barts. Or sitting in Angelo's with a candle flickering between us for the first time. Or when I shot a man threatening to end the genius I barely knew but knew I wanted to know, if that makes sense.
"John. John! Are you alright?" It's Sherlock. His voice is panicked, even more so than the day by the pool. "Answer me!"
She smiles. "Hello, John. Sherlock. Greg." With a quiet movement, she pulls the covering off of the man on her slab to allow Sherlock to examine it.
"Do you, John? I don't think you do." Sherlock's face is the most serious I have ever seen it. The gravity of what he is saying strikes me with such force I feel as if I'm the one with the broken ribs.
I force my eyes open, blinking to see Sherlock sitting up in the bed beside me. He looks as though he's been awake awhile, propped against the headboard and staring at the opposite wall. Afternoon sunlight is bathing the room in warm tones, making his skin glow with orange light.
"For god's sake, John. How do you ever say anything at all?" A cab pulls up in front of us and he opens the door and gives me a once-over before meeting my eye. "
The detective has absolutely no idea what to do with any of these emotions flickering across his flatmate's face. In all honesty, they actually scare him for a minute.
no matter how female that makes me sound. The silk of his skin glides under the roughness of my palms as I unnecessarily skim my hands over his shoulders.
With a heavy sigh, he curls his other hand into the shirt above my hip. "You didn't need to check on me."
"John…oh god. John, I—" He cuts himself off as he jumps to his feet and flees the room, leaving me to prop myself against the bathtub to keep from falling over.
You are just stepping onto Baker Street an hour after John left when he arrives at the bottom of the steps. You blink at each other for a moment before you continue down the stairs and turn to go the opposite direction he came from.
The hand in his hair pulled quickly, dislodging their lips and tilting Sherlock's head back, exposing his long throat. The detective whimpered at the loss of contact and absolutely shuddered when John's lips caressed the base of his neck. The doctor made his way up with open-mouthed kisses that left heat searing through Sherlock's body, through his mind. He gasped and writhed and it wasn't enough and John had barely begun.
woman had decided she fancied me a bit. Sherlock, who had quickly disappeared once we'd stepped inside the building, had suddenly appeared at my side, grabbing my hand and making it painfully clear to the poor girl that I was
I remain quiet, waiting until he's dropped into his chair across from me to set aside the paper. "Sherlock, this, what you're describing, is friendship."
I mentally throttle myself. "Sherlock, I'm sorry. That's not what I—" Cutting myself off, I rub my face with my hands and look back at my friend.
"I know I said I don't know why I waited up for you," John says, skimming his lips across his chest to the other nipple, "but I think it had something to do with this."
Eyes narrowed, Sherlock begins pacing, dismissing the brief interrogation. "It's the skull that's missing. Isn't it obvious?"
I look down at him, stretched out and naked, and can't get over how very fragile he looks. The splint on his slender wrist only furthers that belief.
When the doctor gently peels back the Belstaff and pulls the scarf from the wound, he sucks in a breath. "
The first time I see Mycroft since I found out, he looks fairly normal. Perhaps a bit paler, and Sherlock has no reason to tease him about his weight anymore, but overall, good.
going to finish it." The detective is now standing in the shower, just as unashamedly nude as the other man.
and you should be completely overcome by the case at hand. It isn't every day you get a locked room mystery with multiple mutilated bodies. Instead, your entire focus is on the slight scuffle of a shoe against the rough concrete floor.
I give him one of my disbelieving smiles. "No, Sherlock. Don't do this. Not to me. He obviously said something that upset you."
They are small details, most of which would probably be unnoticeable to everyone except Mycroft and myself, but they're also a big deal. Sherlock doesn't let his body slow him down. I know his injuries weren't so bad that he'd let himself be handicapped. So what in his mindset has changed to allow small signs of weakness to peek through?
Neither of us says more than five words while we're there, and once we have left, I'm more than ready to go home and go to bed. Sherlock stares pointlessly out the window and my wishes change to hoping Lestrade calls with a difficult case so Sherlock pulls himself out of this mood.
Warnings: This chapter contains brief mild torture. Nothing really graphic, mainly just remembering it.
He shifts from foot to foot in my peripheral vision. Recognizing his nervous (You say: Sherlock Holmes,
Sherlock fiddles with the straw of his drink, but doesn't take his eyes from the room. "Not at all. In fact, that's the reason I brought you along."
" I interject, finally pulling my hand through that silky mess covering his head. "Tell me what you want to do."
I move to the edge of the chair, one leg kneeling in the gap between Sherlock's back and the Union Jack pillow, while the other is still braced on the floor. Slipping my hand gently to his fingers, I take the cigarette and drop it in an empty mug nearby before returning my hand and curling my fingers into the gaps between his. He doesn't fight it, doesn't even move. Grazing a hand across his shoulders and onto the bicep furthest from me, I nestle my face in the space where his shoulder connects with his neck.
Reaching out a fingertip, I brush a loose curl from his smooth forehead. His nose scrunches up momentarily at the contact and he shifts his feet so that one is pressed against the bottoms of mine. I smile.
There's a moment. A silent one, both of us barely breathing. I can see in his eyes everything that's roiling deep in my stomach. Anger, frustration, despair, confusion, fear, pain.
tea and the ridiculous blog titles and this infuriating habit he's developed of tugging on the cuff of your coat when he's trying to get your attention.
You lean back, pulling him with you until he is stretched across your body, and despite his shorter height, you feel completely encompassed by him as you press together, skin-on-skin.
