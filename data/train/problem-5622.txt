Tony stared at Steve before staring at the woman, just realizing that he didn’t even see her enter with Steve while also realizing that they were there together, like possibly on a date.
Bucky sighed as he motioned toward the room. “Sam, he almost killed Steve. You can’t be okay with that.”
As soon as he was freed from his shirt, Steve pressed downward into Tony, rubbing himself against his body, causing Tony to moan uncontrollably from feeling Steve again. He could feel Steve getting hard through his pants, so Tony reached down to unzip his own before tackling Steve’s zipper.
“You know, I seem to remember an encounter that sounds a lot like that. And like you said, it was late.” Tony tried through the smile.
Pepper tilted away from Tony to smile sweetly at him before turning to face the breakfast table. She pilled some fruit and a pastry onto a plate before handing it to Tony. Tony meekly accepted the plate, reaching for a piece of fruit on the plate, taking his time chewing before addressing her again.
Shuri nodded before turning to face Steve. “I’ll see you at rehearsal, Steve.” She said with a smile.
“Two conventionally attractive people hanging out with each other, yeah people are going to let their imaginations fly. Some have the decency to keep it to themselves.”
“That was nice work.” Fury motioned behind himself at Agent Hill and Agent Coulson, both nodding sternly.
Tony’s eyes lit up. Sure, Steve was probably just being nice, but it was a cute little reply to ruminate on as Tony drifted off to sleep thinking about Steve instead of dying alone.
Tony looked up at Steve; he was sure Steve could read how shocked he was, thinking Steve was only there to end things between them.
“Weren’t you the one who gave me a hard time about the failsafe, Rogers?” Tony asked, making sure to convey to him that he was only teasing, yet curious to hear Steve explain himself.
Peter stopped mid conversation as he recognized that he was being called. He spotted Steve and smiled.
They gazed at one another for a second or so longer before Steve shuffled his body from underneath Tony to sit up a bit.
Loki sighed; he looked downward at the floor before looking upward at Tony. “Dr. Thanos. He used to work here ages ago.”
“The law student, right?” Tony dropped a file on the desk before leaning into his shoulder resting on the armchair. He watched Rhodey closely investigate the file.
Steve’s brow furrowed with determination. “Of course, Tony. I wouldn’t say that if it weren’t true.” But that didn’t seem to help either. The statement only made Tony groan some more.
They stood silently in the lab for a moment longer before Tony walked up to a console and pulled up some equations. He pointed toward a table across the way.
Tony laughed before easing Steve onto his side as he removed his finger. He rubbed Steve’s chest, unzipping his own pants, before leaning forward, rubbing Steve’s now exposed cock a few times before using his mouth, taking his time feeling Steve with his tongue.
Loki broke away from Thor’s grasp as he straightened himself out. “My brother isn’t aware of how strong he is. Fortunately, he has other positive qualities.
Steve felt too awkward to articulate a response to Tony, embarrassed that he had found him like that.
The first few months were a little bumpy, but after a while Tony and Peter began spending more time together, effortlessly clicking on anything related to science and technology. Eventually Peter grew attached to Tony and vice versa. Tony had vowed upon adopting Peter that he would never treat him the way his dad had when he was a child.
“Wanna have dinner tonight? I had promised Peter I would stop by when back in town.” Rhodey continued to examine Steve’s file. He made a few pleased-sounding noises as he flipped through page after page.
“Well,” Tony clapped his hands together as he squiggled with delight in his seat, “this trip should be interesting.” He turned to grin at Steve again before reaching for his coffee mug.
Steve shrugged. “I know you like the more fancy drinks once in a while, but it’s Sunday and I figured you would probably want the usual…”
The comment forced Tony to stare at Steve. His eyes were already red from the small pool of tears forming.
Tony shook his head as he straightened up in his chair. “No, Rhodes. He basically ran out of the penthouse the morning after. Wouldn’t even let me drive him home.” Tony sank in his chair with grief.
Loki looked over at Thor before facing Tony. “I don’t want him anywhere near me if I tell you.” He said quietly, referring to his irate brother.
“It’s more than that Buck,” Steve straightened up, “I really don’t want to get into it, but Tony had a rough time growing up…and I should have talked to him instead of going behind his back…”
“Peter,” Steve leaned forward some more, “why don’t you pull the car out and try again,” his tone was a calm as possible, “because unfortunately, your dad is right—”
Tony perked up at the question. It should have been a good sign that Steve seemed interested in his personal life as it related to Peter, but Tony was still hung up on Steve not being completely honest with him.
Steve shuffled around to get more comfortable, still holding onto Tony. Tony leaned forward a bit to kiss him as he rocked his hips. He began to moan as he kissed Steve, his hips rocking steadily. Steve kept his eyes on Tony as he pushed upward. Tony pushed downward into his body before easing.
Steve gasped, having trouble trying to keep control over himself, as he pushed back onto Tony’s finger. Tony squirted lube on a second finger, entering that one in slowly as he used his free hand to hold Steve still. Steve moaned more as he felt both fingers, eagerly waiting for Tony to hit that spot again, reacting to Tony feeling inside of him.
“I meant everything I said to you the last time I saw you…but I should be honest with you…” he paused, “I had asked you to go with me on the trip because I miss you so much…and you’re right…I don’t think I can be friends with you either…”
As Tony approached the lab, he saw Steve working at one of the consoles. He took a deep breath before entering the lab.
Hammer rolled his eyes but ordered anyway before turning to face Tony directly. “So, what do you want to know, Stark? You already poached a few of my people and don’t think I didn’t notice that you managed to convince the sister of Wakanda’s King to join your team.”
“Okay, Rogers,” Tony pointed at Steve, “you and Thor are going to go to this thing next Wednesday then. Hopefully, we’ll be able to find Loki.”
“This should give the board something nice to ruminate on while we do our work in peace.” Bruce clapped Tony on the back as he followed Thor out of the hospital room.
Thanos sighed as if he were already bored with the conversation. “Unfortunately, Mr. Stane failed in delivering us the device and its vibranium core, but I found a better use for him—”
Tony turned to face Steve more directly. “Why don’t you relax a bit?” He reached out to rub Steve’s arm.
While Steve was explaining, Tony tapped a few times on this phone. He laughed hysterically as soon as he found the thing he was searching for.
“…and let’s try not to alarm everyone while we’re here, shall we?” Tony concluded, before pointing to Steve.
Tony nodded, also annoyed with Sam’s boss for not letting a needed mediator mediate between him and Bucky.
Instantly, Tony felt horrible inside; it never occurred to him that Steve would even care about meeting Peter, but of course he wanted to. Tony had been too wrapped up in his own shit to really assess whether Steve would even want to meet Peter.
He then spun around to get back to the bedroom without hearing a response from Steve. Tony quickly saved what he was working on before finding something to wear. He could hear Steve’s voice draw nearer to the bedroom, telling him about their dinner plans, but Steve stayed out of the bedroom.
“…I never got the closure I wanted and I’m trying to deal with it in my own way, if that makes sense…?
Steve nodded before joining him on the couch. “I’m sorry you’re having trouble trying to sleep, Tony…” He offered as soon as he made contact with the couch, now sitting very close to Tony.
Tony then flipped over onto his back as Steve rubbed some lube on himself before squirting some onto his fingers. He kissed Tony softly, helping him to get comfortable before he used a free hand to position Tony directly in front of him. Steve rubbed Tony’s waist as he leaned forward, and Tony lifted his body and his legs for Steve, moaning as Steve’s fingers entered.
Tony shuffled around awkwardly, his mind racing with trying to make sense of everything that was happening in the moment.
“No, Tony. You don’t get to do that. I’m basically walking on eggs shells around you. I don’t really know what you want from me…”
The robot’s arm interrupted Steve by almost breaking the table in half. Steve and Tony rolled out from underneath the broken tabletop, spotting Peter who was on the other side of the auditorium with Ned.
“That’s you.” Tony pointed to one of the figures, “I think he said something about Captain America. Something super patriotic, of course. Totally fits, doesn’t it?”
He turned around with the plates to join Tony at the island who looked to be drained from last night. As he sat down, Steve wasn’t sure if he should bring up what happened last night.
Tony clapped his hands as he motioned for Steve to avoid an incoming projection of the Synergy device so it could display its vibranium core once more. Steve nearly hopped out of the away, realizing that he almost missed his cue. As he turned somewhat to face the crowd, the holographic image of the device began generating specs for various items to be replicated.
“Well we know that it can handle the energy generated by the vibranium core and that it doesn’t take much to construct a core.” Tony slid the image of the device to the side as he pulled up an image of the vibranium core, complete with a dimensional scale. Steve leaned closer toward the image. He was completely captivated by its color and intensity.
“Here it is, Mr. Rogers.” The technician handed Steve a bag before asking for his insurance information. Steve gave the technician the information, but just as he was about to sign his signature, he felt a hand squeeze his shoulder.
Steve lingered before trying to walk past Tony to the bedroom door, but Tony held out his arm again; he would only let go if it felt like Steve sincerely wanted him to let go.
Tony kissed Steve back before Steve let go to turn around. Tony massaged Steve’s backside and hips once more before spreading Steve apart, pushing into him slightly. Steve felt Tony enter and immediately his body tensed up.
Tony kept his eyes on the road as he smiled, albeit timidly. They sat in silence for a while longer; Steve figured that Tony would talk to him when he wanted to so he kept the conversation to a minimum and would only contribute if Tony initiated.
Both stared at each other before quickly looking away at the beach. Steve inhaled and exhaled sharply before looking over at Tony who was now looking everywhere else except in his direction.
“Okay, I’m back in…maybe I can use a coin or something…” Tony searched around the room as the device continued making the horrible sound.
“Okay, we got the codes and the building plans. I’m sending the equations now, Stark.” Natasha called, handing the tablet back to Clint who slid it into the inside pocket of his suit.
Steve rolled his eyes as he crossed his arms. “I’m fine now, Tony. I was just getting used to being out of the bed on my own…you know that…”
Steve struggled to sit up in the bed, but then he gave up. “It’s probably because I’ve been lying in this bed for days. I really just want to go on a run…”
Steve nodded to indicate that he understood where Tony was coming from; he could feel the energy between them becoming serious. Tony shuffled so that he was now on his side, facing Steve more directly, this time with a smile that seemed so abrupt from the previous tone.
Tony sighed as he rolled his eyes. He patted Bruce’s hand on his shoulder. “Banner, chill, okay? I’m fine. It’s probably heart burn or a panic attack or something.” He waved his friend off before walking back to his console to retrieve his tablet, but he could feel Bruce staring him down.
“Well…hopefully…” Steve kept his eyes on Tony, “I’ll get to do some pre-summer things with the two of you before you head out…”
Strange chuckled before grabbing his things to head out. “Anytime, Tony.” He answered as he patted Tony on the back before turning to leave. He stopped briefly at the office door.
Tony groaned as he leaned forward to place his head in his hands. “It’s been a while…but I knew being here would fuck me up…” He wiped his eyes but kept facing downward and away from Steve.
Tony rested his hands on his hips. “Well, Steve has his own life and sometimes he’s doing that instead.”
Tony laughed as he joined Steve on the bed again, reaching over carefully to kiss him, and not long after, there was a soft knock on the bedroom door.
“Look, Steve. I know how you feel about Tony. You brought him along because you want to get close again, like it’s
Dr. Selvig fidgeted some more before walking briskly toward the entrance of his lab. He looked around anxiously before motioning for Natasha to following him to one of the consoles nearest to the back of the lab.
“Okay, that might be something that I do, but I rather not cause friction between the two of us. I’ll be the bigger person.”
Tony was sitting next to Steve at a table that nearly took up most of the room. Their chairs were close enough for their legs to touch. Sensing Tony’s anxiety, Steve knew his lab partner’s sigh was mostly directed toward Obadiah and the board than at Clint.
“Yes, indeed. Tony Stark and his Synergy team swooped in at the eleventh hour to save a visiting diplomat and needless to say, the country possibly avoided
“Okay,” Tony clapped his hands together to get the team’s attention, “actually, before I start, I should mention that it’s great seeing everyone again.” Collectively, the team happily responded back to him.
“Uh, Mr. Stark?” The intern looked around the room as his voice trembled with intimidation, “I-I need your signature…”
Steve took his time approaching him. “Tony…we just saw him. He knows you went on a trip for a couple days…”
Thanks for reading! Stay tuned for the next installment to this series, the much-anticipated sequel to the first installment:
Tony smiled as he unstrapped the robot. “We might need to take the arms off, but it should be good. I made sure to measure the width before we moved forward.”
“Look out for the reports…and keep an eye on that newest team member, Steve Rogers. He may be useful…”
Although he had told Steve to leave him alone, Tony thought Steve would have at least tried to call him. It got to the point to where Tony would turn his phone off during the day yet impatiently check it in the evening, thinking Steve had finally called him or sent a message. But as each day passed with no word from Steve, Tony fumed and now Obadiah was making moves to take control of Synergy.
“Yeah, I know, but we have to switch elevators to get up to the penthouse.” Tony smiled sweetly at Steve, caressing his cheek before dragging them to the opening of the elevator.
Tony shook his head as he proceeded to walk around the lab, pretending to be surveying the remaining damage.
Tony felt Steve’s hand let go of his shoulder. “Okay, I’ll see you later. I’ll let you know when we’re about to leave to visit Clint…” He answered softly.
“You didn’t know that, Rhodes. But thank you.” Tony smiled as Rhodey wished him a good night. He walked back to the table to find Steve paying for the check.
“See. I told you I knew what I was doing,” Tony straightened out his shirt, “and I couldn’t secure a proper foothold, Rogers.” He added the snide comment before storming out of the arena, referring to Steve using his body weight to keep Tony from knocking him over. The living room scene pixeled as he exited the program.
He straightened up suddenly as he continued. “I woke up thinking about Tony, you know…,” Steve made a few gestures with his hands as if that explained he had woken up to humping Tony’s mattress, “J.A.R.V.I.S. is also programmed in his room. Ugh. J.A.R.V.I.S., Sam?! I’m so embarrassed.”
Tony moaned as he rocked forward, keeping his hands on Steve’s chest as his body bobbed up and down with every motion. Steve opened his eyes slightly to look at Tony; he had never seen him like this before and he couldn’t help staring.
Steve whimpered as soon as Tony’s hand made contact with skin. He rutted against Tony as they continued making out heavily, gasping for air. Tony panted as he could feel himself pressing against the fabric of his pants. He then reached underneath Steve to get to his zipper, but he stopped short.
Steve blinked a few times as his eyes adjusted to the darkness. “Tony? What’s going on? Are you okay?”
Obadiah blinked a few times, hearing a voice call his name, but instead of responding, he tightened his grip on the briefcase he was holding.
Tony nodded, taking a moment to sit up. He breathed heavily as he hunched over. Peter sat down on the floor with him, patting him on the back.
Peter’s facial expression turned determined as he took his time pronouncing the word the way Tony had.
Steve kept stroking, taking his time replacing his hand with his mouth. He licked Tony as he took him in slowly, using his hand to stroke the base of Tony’s cock as he sucked.
“Really? What’s the hold up then?” Tony could tell that Rhodey was trying to walk the balance between being happy for him and concerned.
Steve shook his head quickly as he backed out of the bedroom. “Tony, it’s fine. I can just camp out in the living room—we’ll barely be in the suite anyway.”
T’Challa had prepared multiple planes for the bridal party and friends to travel to the resort. Steve and Tony were sharing this plane with Sam and Bucky, along with a couple of T’Challa’s bodyguards and two in-laws.
Tony stared impassively at Steve before frowning. “Surely, you’re joking, Rogers. Don’t you remember almost dying in a lab explosion caused by the Synergy device not too long ago? I really don’t want to have anything to do with it at the moment.”
Tony waited before it became clear that Steve had ended the call. He nearly dropped his phone as he looked hurriedly around the kitchen, not really sure what to do next as he tried to process what he would say to Steve once they saw each other. Without really thinking, Tony ran to his bedroom, ruminating on whether he should change his clothes, but decided against it. Tony then jogged back to the kitchen, thinking he should probably prepare some sort of a snack plate for the two of them, but then decided against that as well, telling himself that such a move might make it look like he wasn’t taking the moment seriously.
Tony looked over at him, now waiting patiently for Steve to continue although he wore the most painful-looking expression on his face.
Tony cleared his throat before trying again. “I, uh, had a nice time with you tonight. Thank you for having dinner with me.” He glanced over at Steve who was looking back at him.
Steve watched Tony rush out of the room. He wasn’t sure if he should follow him or if he should leave the party. He sighed heavily as he sat down on the edge of the bed, hanging his head low, admonishing himself for not being straightforward with Tony.
Tony and Peter scooted out from underneath the robot to join Steve at the console. Both hummed and posed thoughtfully as they studied the numbers.
Tony swallowed a lump in his throat as he tried to process this information. “Yep, uh, can I help?” He asked awkwardly.
Tony turned slowly to face Steve again, but he didn’t respond. Steve sighed as he searched for better way to explain himself.
Bruce shook his head again as he turned to face the group directly. “We embedded new scaling configurations into this newest version of the reactor…so long story short, it’ll let the device emit a reactionary blast if compromised before self-destructing as a last resort, but we’re having trouble trying to control the extent of the possible damage…the original schematics aren’t entirely helpful…so we can’t do much without completing the installation of the newest safeguards. The core keeps the device stable enough to use it for its original purpose, but as we’ve seen in the past…”
Steve laughed as he listened to Tony and Peter race each other through the penthouse. After a moment, he exhaled heavily to himself, looking around the bedroom, irritated that he still needed help moving from the bed to the bathroom.
Silence reared itself again as both Steve and Tony tried to focus on the mission, but both were incredibly confused by their awkward conversation in the lab. In the helicopter, Tony maneuvered them away from the Tower as they headed toward the precinct.
“And this is Clint Barton.” Fury pointed toward the man still lounging in his chair. Clint only waved at Steve before crossing his arms behind his head.
Something about the conversation slowly relieved Tony. He decided not to read too much into it; Steve seemed willing to take him as he was, an overworked parent, but that didn’t necessarily mean that he was interested in him. He would only say something if something came up. Otherwise he would just leave it alone. If Steve were interested, he would have said so by now, right?
Tony shook his head again, turning to face Steve. “It’s okay,” he began as he sighed once more. He reached out to caress Steve behind the ear. “Thank you for offering though, baby.”
“Hey, everyone!” Sam called from the upper level of the yacht, “we’re doing the bridal party photos now so everyone can rest before the party.”
Steve walked over to the table Tony had assigned to him yesterday. He pulled out his sketchbook and notepad.
Bucky shrugged. “You know him better than I do, but from the way I saw you two before you broke up and the way I see you guys now…there’s something…” he took a step toward Steve, “don’t give up just yet, Cap. Give him some time.”
Steve sighed once more as he tapped once on his phone to pull up Tony’s number. He waited for what felt like a century until he finally tapped on the icon next to Tony’s name to call him. It rang twice before a weary sounding Tony answered the phone.
Natasha nodded as she walked over to settle next to Bruce. “That’ll give S.H.I.E.L.D. some time to sniff out any boogies.” She looked at Fury.
Steve closed his eyes, now more enraptured with seeing Tony enjoying himself. He kept moving his hand as he licked up and down Tony. He took his time, taking in more of Tony’s scent and how great he felt, letting out a few gasps and moans himself as he worked.
Natasha sighed as she walked over to Steve and Tony, attempting to deescalate the tension, but before she could say or do anything productive, one of the interns barged into the room with a knock at the door.
Tony sighed as he backed away from the microphone. He looked over at Steve before continuing. “The trams to Manhattan stop running in an hour—”
Tony glanced over at Steve again. He mouthed the words “I’m sorry” at Steve who shook his head, mouthing back “it’s okay”.
Steve groaned, knowing that such a statement from Tony was the best he was going to get as some sort of reassurance.
Steve nearly turned a fair shade of pink from how confident Tony appeared to be in him. Also, that was maybe the seventh or eighth time Tony had either touched him on purpose or by accident. But Steve wasn’t really counting.
Tony’s eyes widened as he realized his friends were once again talking about his dating life behind his back.
“My team is experienced. What do you have that they don’t?” The officer inquired with her arms crossed again. She tapped her sunglasses against her folded arm.
Tony was in the lab working a little later than usual to keep his mind occupied before the dinner with Steve later that evening. Steve had left about an hour before to get ready. Needless to say, the two men were awkward around the other the entire day; both made sure to convey their sincerest enthusiasm for the dinner without sounding too desperate.
“Uh, you can also stay over…if you want…no pressure…” Tony added quietly, trying to sound jovial, yet he was annoyed with himself because he had been repeating the same line for several days now.
They were silent the entire walk over, yet still holding hands. As they entered their building, Tony accessed the elevator to their suite, stepping to the side to let Steve in first. Steve stepped inside the elevator, turning to hold the door open for Tony.
.” He teased once more, before moving one hand to hold Steve’s waist and the other to grab the base of Steve’s cock.
“Sharon? Why would Sharon be here?” He took a step toward Tony as he spoked, causing Tony to quickly move to the side.
Tony scrunched up his face, thinking quickly before placing his hands on his hips. He tapped his foot a few times before looking back and forth.
Hours later and both Tony and Steve had finally arrived at some ridiculously oversized mansion not too far away from the beach shore.
Steve chuckled as he reached over to pull Tony into a hug, feeling Tony hug him back, holding on tightly. They hugged each other for some time before Tony broke away, looking away from Steve before returning his gaze. Steve smiled at him, tilting his chin downward to a degree to kiss Tony. They kissed each other, the kiss moving deeply and slowly like it had countless times before.
Peter furrowed his brow as he scrolled through some data on the tablet. “Okay, what about this then?” He showed what he had found to Tony who smiled.
Steve squeaked a small noise as Tony felt around through the fabric of his briefs before taking his time pushing the fabric down. Steve made another noise as his hardening cock sprung out, almost smacking Tony in the face.
Obadiah grinned back at him before taking his time rising from his chair. “I need full reports on the new safety procedures and whatever S.H.I.E.L.D. is doing in the interim to find this attacker.” Obadiah spun around before walking to the office door.
Bucky and Steve were standing out on the balcony attached to Steve and Sam’s apartment. The space was more of a little extension, part of an old fire escape, but Steve and Sam often hung out on the extension on warmer days during the year.
Tony nodded. “Yeah, well, his aunt watches him mostly, but when she needs to work Rhodey usually helps out when he’s in town. Sometimes Bruce and Pepper are free.”
Steve nodded, still looking a little worried. “We have to do the…thing...now?” He waved his hand aimlessly at the device.
“She always gave me really good advice…but that time she told me that I need to listen as much as possible…sometimes I struggle with that…” He admitted; his expression was stern, but he was trying to smile.
“Nope. You’re doing a fabulous job. Please continue and don’t mind me.” Tony lounged. He glanced around the room before settling in his chair. He quickly acknowledged everyone but lingered the longest as he looked over in Steve’s direction. Steve remained undaunted, but there was something about Tony, like after his final interview, that Steve found a bit captivating. Tony grinned before facing forward to listen to Fury finish the presentation.
The object flickered, causing the people standing near him to back away, terrified, while Thanos stood in place.
Steve shook his head again, bracing himself against the desk before responding. “Where does everyone else stand on this?”
“Um, tell me if this is too forward…I’m not really asking for anything suggestive I promise…” Tony began.
Tony kissed Steve before reaching for the bedside table. He almost toppled over again as Steve caught him before reaching for the table himself, finding a tube of lube and a condom. Both Steve and Tony looked at each other simultaneously, perhaps silently signaling exactly what they wanted in that moment.
“Destroy it.” Tony firmly responded before Bruce could get a whole sentence in. Both Bruce and Shuri expressed their confusion at one another.
Tony waited, looking at the message until he finally turned his phone off. He turned over onto his other side to face the pillow Steve was lying on, grabbed it, and held on it tightly before surrendering to sleep.
Steve traveled through the aisles until he reached the pharmacy. He walked up to the counter, looking around anxiously for a free technician.
“Remember the scene with the device that smooches Tom Cruise’s face so he can get back into Precrime undetected?” Tony sat back in his chair, looking pleased with himself, “well, I have invented one of those.”
Steve leaned against the door, listening for the shower to turn on before turning the door handle to discover that Tony hadn’t locked the door. Steve smiled as he pushed the door open, finding Tony in the shower humming loudly to himself.
“Are you always this nosy? Jeez.” Tony lightly quipped, but he walked ahead of Steve so the latter wouldn’t see his hurt expression.
Tony groaned loudly without verbally responding to Bruce, but the conversation wasn’t lost on Steve who stood up swiftly to glare at Tony.
“…I just—I’m not good at this...” Tony sighed again. There was no way he was going to tell Steve how he felt. He knew he would be rejected.
“Okay…” Steve responded as he waited for Tony, slowly dragging the word out, clearly fearing the worst.
“Just tell me, Pep.” But Tony knew he would never be able to fully brace himself for whatever shit was about to hit the fan.
The various items disappeared as Tony sauntered to the center of the stage. “Be on the lookout for the device in the future. I can truly guarantee that Synergy will not
Tony scrolled through some data on the tablet, seemingly unaware that he had grazed Steve’s hand. Steve waited patiently for him to speak.
Tony grinned as he accepted the box from Steve, opening it quickly to see that it was a journal with a felt cover.
Tiberius shrugged with a huff. “Actually, I received a personal invitation from Obie…but it would have been better coming from you, Tony.”
As soon as the doors opened, Steve exhaled as he stepped out into the hallway. He looked to his left and saw two glass doors with the words “RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT” embossed on the glass. Steve easily pried open the otherwise unnecessarily heavy glass doors before walking up to the receptionist desk.
Tony wasn’t sure how to proceed. Should he continue? But before he could dwell on it any longer, his mouth had other plans as he began rambling.
Tony made a pleasant-sounding noise of approval. “Good idea, Rogers. Let’s avoid any unnecessary danger while we’re at it.”
Not only had Tony screwed up the equations during the board presentation, he now had his friends taking over his parental responsibilities more often so he could chase a crush. And how much of that chasing was actually working, again, Tony couldn’t be so sure.
“I’m not asking, I’m telling you.” Steve had turned slightly to face Tony. His hand was near his, and Tony could feel Steve’s warmth from it. He could sense from Steve’s stern expression that his lab mate wasn’t planning on letting up about the trip.
Steve laughed as he turned to follow Clint. “Of course, I’ll see you at the island.” He then jogged down the hallway.
Tony nodded before continuing. “Peter’s parents…they were good friends of mine. They used to work at Stark Industries before they died…the same way my parents had…I think one of the reasons why I felt like I needed to take Peter in was because of the way he lost his parents. He could have easily grown up the way I had, but I couldn’t allow it…”
Tony shook his head with a laugh. “Okay that and nothing else. Excuse me for a sec.” He smiled at Steve before walking a few feet away from him as he dialed Rhodey’s number.
Tony, feeling himself losing control over his anger again, shook his head as he tried to steady himself and not confront Obadiah for purposely curating a confrontation while using Pepper.
“No longer will the average citizen have to wait to see change. We can do all that with the Synergy device.” Tony pointed behind himself again as the pieces of the device continued to swirl around the auditorium. Steve immediately clammed up as soon as he realized he was about to go on.
“Eh, I’ve had more eventful days.” Shuri answered casually, prompting Bruce to dipped his eyeglasses with curiosity.
Steve rutted up against Tony, breathing heavily as he placed a hand behind Tony’s head, kissing him as he pushed downward. Tony kissed Steve back, but gasped for air as the kiss grew even more intense.
But instead of giving Tony a hard time about it, Strange kept smiling at Steve. “Well, I’m glad Tony’s capable of kind word,” he grinned before turning around to reenter the room, “but, he’s not so bad either.” Strange’s last statement prompted a loud groan from Tony.
Steve struggled to prevent himself from grimacing as he accepted Loki’s hand. There was still something about Thor’s brother that threw him off.
Steve watched Tony’s expression change slightly before he finally smiled somewhat. He nodded as he hopped of his stool before walking to the counter.
Obadiah paused before grinning at Tony. The two men stared at each other before Pepper finally appeared in the conference room.
And without really considering the ramifications of his decision, Steve thought there was something in that diary that could help him understand and calm Tony’s emotions during their stay. Steve knew that Tony’s reaction was based on the initials “H.S.” etched into the cover of the diary, but Steve was determined to find any clue to Tony’s relationship with his father.
Tony braced himself against the table to stop blathering on about his personal problems. Something about being around Steve had made Tony relax even if he wasn’t entirely sure how Steve felt about him. However, going on and on about Pepper was a huge mistake; Steve was definitely going to bolt now.
“Rhodes, it’s more than fine. I know that,” Tony shook his head a few times as he interrupted Rhodey, “and Banner is a fine substitute.” He tried, half-grimacing as he thought about the upcoming weekend.
Bruce leaned up against the side of the console to look at Tony and Shuri “…the most we know about Thanos’s weapon is that it’s emitting gamma radiation of some kind…”
Tony laughed again as he pulled Steve along with him. As the three went through the backstage, they found Happy standing at the end of the hallway, holding off a hoard of press agents.
Gamora turned slightly to look down at Obadiah who still looked terrified. “Figure out that notation or you won’t even see us before we kill you. Got it?”
Steve bobbed his head in the water as he tried to focus on relaxing. “Tony, you’re more stubborn than me.”
A holographic image of a device appeared in the middle of the conference table. Everyone crowded around it to get a better look.
Steve relaxed as he realized that his tone caught Tony off guard. “I don’t have an issue with Pepper, Tony. I actually really enjoy her company…” He sighed before settling to stand directly in front of the bed as Tony faced him from the door, “…the point is that the two of you used to date, but now you’re friends. I’ve never gotten physical with Bucky, but I can’t be trusted? That makes absolutely no sense and you know it.”
“Mr. Stane, I’m going to try to say this respectfully, but you have no idea how much work Tony’s put into ensuring the team’s safety.”
Tony thought, but he couldn’t even say out loud or even silently mouth. He shook his head, feeling his chest restrict with pain so much to the point that Tony thought he was about to have a heart attack. Tony clenched his chest before slumping to the floor again, trying to convince himself that he could be vulnerable with Steve.
Tony attempted a chuckle as he ran with Steve toward Peter. “So, I was joking when I said this will be ‘a science fair project that will end all science fair projects’.” But of course, the joke was lost on Steve.
Mr. Beck laughed. “You probably don’t remember.” He leaned back in his chair, still smiling in the strange way from before.
“Dr. Blake, you’re with Stark.” Thor nodded in Tony’s general direction. Tony shoved his hands into his jeans as he barely nodded back.
Tony stopped for a second as he watched Steve walk ahead of him, feeling the slight sensation in his chest but he managed to will it away before catching up with Steve.
However, Tony was also struggling with how great Steve had been up until that point. He got along well with Peter and he was understanding when it came to past relationship issues and family trauma. Yet the thing with his dad’s diary was something Tony couldn’t seem to get past.
When he walked into the space, Steve could hardly believe his eyes. He had only really seen something like this on TV, like in a passing
Tony shook his head. “Everything is fine, Rogers. We’ll have it under control before the fair.” He reached over to pat Peter on the back who nodded back vigorously.
Obadiah grinned before laughing to himself. He crossed he legs before resting a closed fist on top of the table.
Bruce sighed again, shaking his head. “I don’t think that’s a good idea. If Tony’s right and the missing link in this whole thing is Obadiah, who knows if those two are still working with him.”
Bucky nodded again as Sam motioned for them to reenter the room. Tony had stayed in his chair next to the bed, trying to do work, but mostly watching Steve.
“Goodnight, Steve!” Peter nearly jumped on Steve as he gave him a hug before running into his bathroom to get ready.
Tony sighed before hanging his head. “Yeah, well, at least it’s for a better reason this time…” He joked.
“You know, Tony. I’m going to have to reevaluate our friendship if you keep ignoring me.” Bruce turned to face Tony directly, but Tony was too involved in ogling at Steve to really notice. He grunted a non-committal reply.
Obadiah tapped on his desk with one finger as he leaned back into his chair. “…I’m aware that Howard’s schematic notations are difficult to understand…the man was never transparent…I’m sure your father’s team of scientists are more than capable—”
“Tony, you can lie down if you want. I know it’s getting super late.” Steve offered as he pulled the covers back on his side. Tony look at Steve then the bed, then Steve again before looking back down at the bed.
“J.A.R.V.I.S.,” Tony shifted his mental energy into work, “could you give me a rundown of my schedule for the next few weeks, please?” He leaned backward in his chair, clicking a pen as he swiveled from side to side.
Steve nodded furiously while Tony, still holding onto to Steve, answered that they were fine. As soon as the waiter walked away from their table, Steve pulled his hands away from Tony and coughed. Tony felt an even more aching, sinking feeling as Steve ran a hand through his hair, eyes darting in the direction of the restroom.
“Hold him down.” Thor said to Steve as he let go of Loki to get to the trunk of his car. He pulled out two sets of jumper cables.
However, when they broke up, Tony had made it clear that he and Steve weren’t right for each other. Steve had truly thought that he and Tony would get married and become a family and it hurt thinking that everything they had gone through didn’t appear to mean anything to Tony, especially with the way he had been so blatant last night.
As he worked, he replayed the first assignment in his head. Tony had confidence in the team, sure, but the first mission had gone far better than he had ever hoped. It helped that their individual personalities and professions lent toward their specific tasks, but Steve had impressed Tony the most. He had never seen anyone who was a self-professed luddite take so easily to complicated tech, especially in its beginning stages.
“Actually, Tony…” Steve interjected as he continued rubbing Tony’s arms, “I haven’t been with anyone since you…”
“I’m impressed that she managed to comprehend some of my dad’s more esoteric notes. I’ve been pouring over those for a year now.”
“Hey, Peter. Come over here and meet Steve.” Peter turned around with a huge smile at the sound of Tony’s voice. He then jumped down from the ladder, running up to Steve before stopping short to salute him.
Tony panted as he felt Steve, running his hands up the length of Steve’s backside, moaning from every movement. He slipped his hands underneath the hem of Steve’s boxers.
Tony sighed as he took a second, knowing that he needed to remain calm. “Bucky, please. I really just want to make things right with him, okay? Please just tell him that I came over to talk, all right?”
Steve shook his head. “Every time we speak, I end up saying the wrong thing…that’s why I wrote him that stupid letter…”
much fun, Cap.” He patted Steve on the shoulder while sporting that goofy grin. Steve knew what his friend was referring to but managed to not make a show of it, especially with Tony standing so close.
In one of the nicer conference rooms, the team listened to Thor explain his brother’s possible whereabouts. Thor was standing at the front while everyone else was sitting in a chair surrounding the conference table.
Tony felt his face flush as he smiled back at Steve. He was surprised that their conversation at dinner hadn’t erupted into the explosive dumpster fire he had expected; actually, something about talking to Steve in such an intimate setting made Tony miss Steve even more. Yet, as he continued to watch Steve from a distance, he was still confused by Steve’s intentions.
“Hey! When did you get in?” Steve asked with a broad smile as he set Peter up at the island to toss ingredients into the salad.
Steve chuckled. “I forgot that I told you that…,” he waited a bit before rubbing Tony’s cheek, lightly caressing him, “but I sincerely hope that my love life ends happier.”
“Fury, Thanos is trying to use Synergy to build a core similar to the vibranium one. We have to cease operations before he can get his hands on it.”
Instead of responding, Steve continued to stare down at Tony. Tony shuffled around underneath him, trying to get comfortable, hoping Steve would just take the answer he had given.
“Come on, Tony.” Steve begged, trying to turn away from Tony again who managed to prevent him by holding onto his arm.
“…I, uh…understand, Steve…” Tony started, trying to remain calm, telling himself not to give up, “but—”
Steve sucked in a breath of air, biting his bottom lip as he turned to face a smiling Tony again. He noted to himself the change intimacy as he resettled. He scooted closer toward Tony who did the same, looking at each faintly for a second or so before moving closer, so close that their faces were only an inch away. Tony breathed deeply before reaching out a hand to caress the back of Steve’s neck. Steve closed his eyes as he accepted a kiss from Tony.
“Loki…I know…you had something to do with the lab explosion…” Thor explained quietly, never taking his eyes off his brother.
Steve joined Tony at the console as they listen to Fury finish explaining their assignment. His heart started to thump with excitement.
As he heard the shower turn on in the bathroom, Tony thought about Steve possibly being embarrassed that they were getting so close. If so, why wouldn’t he say so? Tony had never been so hung on someone before and it was totally nerve racking.
Tony patted Steve on the shoulder from behind before walking over to the built-in bar where Thor and Clint were in the process of pouring themselves some more shots.
Steve couldn’t stop his face from expressing terror as he clearly heard the invisible quotation marks around the word “friend”.
Steve limped to the side of the bed he usually slept on, removing his shirt and his pajama pants before carefully sliding into the bed. Tony watched Steve undress before doing the same. As he met Steve’s body, Steve reached out to draw him in.
“I closed down the resort for the wedding, so it’s just wedding guests.” T’Challa stopped at the front desk as he motioned to get the attention of one of the members of the resort staff, “could you give everyone their keys to their suites?”
Steve let out a satisfied sigh as he walked away from the stove. He had finally finished cleaning up the kitchen from making dinner for his family and Ned. Usually, Tony would help Steve out with the cleaning, but the former had been working later than typical. Steve didn’t mind; he had gotten used to Tony’s working schedule ever since he moved in before they were married.
The team stepped back to let the doctors hook the ambassador up to the machine. Without a minute to spare, the ambassador’s vital signs immediately returned to stable. All the doctors and nurses present in the room audibly sighed with relief and gratitude.
“Steve…,” Tony began. The serious tone was evident in Tony’s choice to address Steve by his first name.
To Steve, Tony appeared astonished that he was willing to dance with him. Steve thought it was cute but was wary of making Tony feel more insecure about it.
“You know, the nice thing about this device is that it’s durable, but lightweight.” Tony quickly changed the subject as Bruce sank even lower in his chair.
Steve waited next to their seats as he pointed to the window seat. “Would you like the window seat, Tony?”
Tony tried to keep his expression pleasant, but the guilt of having Rhodey stay so late with Peter and his failure from trying to figure out Steve made his face fall back into agony. He could tell it had so from the way Steve was now expressing concern.
Obadiah sat in complete disbelief as he watched the two women who met Tony and Steve at the event that evening bicker in front of him. He still had trouble comprehending that tech crime seemed to run in Thanos’s family; the two women, Gamora and Nebula, were also the scientist’s daughters and they were aggressively debating with each other on how best to wreck the Synergy device once the team went back into the field.
Loki had installed a special encryption program on his tablet to receive emails before the agents at S.H.I.E.L.D. could geotag his communication. He deleted the message and wiped its traces from his server. Loki had been cooperating with S.H.I.E.L.D. only to distract the Synergy team from tracking Obadiah so he could deliver the Synergy device to Thanos, but Loki didn’t think Obadiah would resort to trying to blow it up again.
the best it will be at the moment,” Tony responded mid eye-roll, “I’d rather stay positive about the project than sow seeds of doubt.” He then looked around himself to indicate to Rhodey that he was referring to Obadiah who was in deep conversation with some board members and Fury.
Steve winced as his friends fell over each other at something he didn’t find that funny. Tony Stark barely seemed like someone he could get along with, let alone date. Besides, he probably wasn’t the man’s type anyway.
Steve sighed. He had accidentally overheard Tony’s conversation with Rhodey which led Steve to believe that Tony was close to going home before anything got physical between the two of them. Steve, through a surge of desperation, thought maybe letting Tony rest in his bed would lead to something, but Tony seemed awkward and timid.
Steve’s jaw hardened as he looked intently at Tony. “Tony…” He slowly pushed himself away from the island as he approached Tony. He stopped short as he crossed his arms, “…you gotta talk to me…that’s the only way this will work…”
“Uh, do you think…” Tony began, turning around to lean up against is his console, “…I should invite Steve to the thing I’m having at my place next weekend? That’s not desperate, right?”
Tony laughed as he ruffled Peter’s hair. “Yes, of course. I knew you were the smarter one out of the two of us.”
“Okay, Tone,” Rhodey was pointing behind himself as Tony looked around anxiously, “Pep’s going to get everyone’s attention before you go up…”
Pepper nodded again as she rubbed Tony’s arm. “I appreciate the concern, Tony, but I’ll be okay. However, please look after yourself…please don’t run off and play spy again without telling me, okay?”
Tony calculated the equations then read the solutions to Steve who quickly entered them into the device. The device began generating spec by spec. Everyone on the railing, this time including Obadiah, gazed down, amazed with the vibrancy of the device.
“Okay,” Tony started as he turned to exit the balcony, “I’ll admit you’re right, Rogers.” He said as he reentered the hotel room. Steve waited before following; he watched Tony walk over to the space in between the two beds, crossing his arms with a weak smile.
“Hey!” Loki struggled against Natasha, attempting to wiggle free but she was stronger than he had anticipated, “I’m trying to help! I swear to god I told you all what I know this time!”
Tony nodded again, uncrossing his arms as he walked over to his desk. He knew he shouldn’t have left Steve at the resort reeling from rejection, but he needed the space to think, this time being more assured about what he wanted from Steve.
“That’s wonderful, Tony!” Pepper nearly exclaimed, although Tony knew she was already aware of his relationship with Steve.
Tony backed off as it became clear to him that Steve was hesitating. “Or not. I’m not going to pressure you, of course.” He smiled before turning back around to talk to Bruce.
Steve handed Tony the tablet back. “Although I’m concerned for our safety, I don’t think Obadiah would put himself in danger. I think when it comes down to it, he would look out for himself over anything else.”
Hey! Trying to get myself to engage more than just posting and leaving it. :p So my apologies...I'm nervous about being annoying! But I also wanted to thank everyone who's been reading so far, you all make my day :)
“Hi, J.A.R.V.I.S. Didn’t know you lived in Tony’s penthouse, too.” Steve grinned, now used to addressing the computer as if J.A.R.V.I.S. were human.
Tony nodded slowly; his expression oscillated back and forth between pained and faked content. “Oh well, I probably would have asked you, too. You do have that sort of ‘face’.” He joked, making quotation marks with his fingers at the word “face”.
The group chatted for another hour before Steve excused himself to find Tony. He spotted him over by the temporary bar talking to the man who was with Bruce and Pepper earlier. Steve smiled as he approached, taking note that Tony had noticed him making his way over.
Tony would joke around with others, especially Bruce and Natasha, that occasionally verged on the flirty side, so Steve wasn’t sure if it was just his way of getting close with someone. Although it did feel different than what he had witnessed between Tony and others, Steve didn’t want to get his hopes up. He liked Tony and their working relationship; he was nervous he would ruin it with his personal feelings.
Tony meandered through the restaurant, instantly spotting Rhodey at their table. Tony waved as he walked over. The two friends were meeting for breakfast at one of the resort’s many and diverse restaurants.
Steve smiled. He appreciated the kind message along with a note of expected arrival. He sat up to type back a reply.
“Sam, you know Rogers’s friend—not the friend he grew up with, his roommate—told me something that might mean I have a chance…” He slowly began. Bruce turned to give Tony an emphatic nod.
Steve sighed as he turned to lean his back up against the railing. “Tony…I really do miss you, I meant that when I said it…”
“…well, actually you might be fine,” Tony cleared his throat, “…because you know…your build.” There again was that hint of hesitancy in Tony’s voice as he finished his statement, but Steve brushed it off.
“Relax, Richard III. We should proceed with caution.” Tony had his arms crossed as he played back the cleaned-up security footage on a console above the conference table. The team watched the night Loki assaulted Clint in Tony and Steve’s lab.
Tony chuckled, however before he could tease Steve, he instantly began to wonder if this “guy in college” might have been Bucky. Tony thought quickly; he could either interrogate Steve about his love life before him, ruining an otherwise perfect moment of intimacy he had been dreaming about since he met Steve, or he could just let it go. Besides, he figured Steve would have told him if he had slept with Bucky.
“Well thanks, Rogers.” He paused for a second as he walked to sit on the edge of the bed on Steve’s side.
He began picking up the dishes left in the living room. “You know, it’s not really lost on me that I may never get this close to another celebrity again.”
Tony moaned and whined as Steve continued inside, feeling himself coming close. Steve held him down into the bed, his body also shaking from the feeling. One of his hands traveled up Tony’s body until Steve was near Tony’s face. He brushed Tony’s lips with his thumb, rubbing them gently until Tony stuck out his tongue lick Steve’s thumb. Steve moaned as he pressed his thumb inside Tony’s mouth before entering two fingers, watching Tony suck on his fingers as he fucked him.
Tony couldn’t stop his face from forming the same goofy grin that appeared when Steve told him why he had kept the chip. He felt his cheeks redden, remembering Steve saying something like that to him a long time ago before they started dating. Steve continued to smile at him, reaching for his hand. Tony accepted Steve’s hand, rubbing it gently as Steve moved inward toward him.
Tony unhooked himself from Steve before entering, knocking on the door before announcing himself. The room was just as ornate as the hallway; lavish statuary and drapery on full display. The two approached two women standing next to a desk. Both women looked unamused and extremely intimidating.
Tony chuckled. “I know I’m not Queen Bey famous, Rogers, but I still get recognized on occasion, i.e. your graduation, if you recall.”
Tony wrestled with himself. Something about his facial expression must have caused Steve to take notice.
Obadiah nodded as he followed the staffer inside one of Middleton University’s main buildings connected to the roof helicopter landing pad. Roosevelt Island included an extension of the university’s campus that focused on technology and innovation, and it was also the site of the international tech conference that would officially begin that evening.
As he finally reached his lab, Steve spotted through the glass façade Tony working at a console. He smiled to himself before entering the lab.
Clint sighed. “All I remember is trying to find those damn numbers before my legs gave out.” He looked at Natasha before looking up at the ceiling.
Steve’s mind dwelled on the memories until he was interrupted by a soft knock at his door. He flailed around trying to delicately hide the chip in the desk again before answering the knock.
“Yeah, of course, Tone. I figured I would end up doing that anyway.” Tony could feel Rhodey’s grin through the phone.
“Oh yeah sure. But we need Tony to negotiate with the blond wizard first.” Bruce added, now glaring at Tony who was still not paying attention to the conversation.
“Okay, so we need to use the codes to generate this thing to open the door. Think you can handle that, Rogers?” Tony teased.
Tony wondered to himself, debating whether he should even open the email whose subject line read: “PLEASE READ! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU'LL EVER READ!”
Steve nodded before looking over at Tony. Tony smiled back wearily. He could tell that Steve had taken notice.
“Tony, I told you I’m worried about you. Let me check my calendar and find some dates so I can go with you.”
, Obie.” Tony shot back. Part of him wanted to jab Obadiah about accusing Steve of an inappropriate relationship with a superior, but thankfully he managed to contain himself.
“—I know you’re just being nice.” But Bruce had barely missed a beat from Tony and Rhodey’s sing-along.
Steve inhaled as he took a hold of Tony’s hand and squeezed gently. “Sure…that would be nice, and I know how you feel...”
“Whatever we find goes through Pepper then to you. You’re a sucker for chain of command, Obie.” Tony mocked, although he managed to sound not as nasty as he had intended.
Steve was standing in line with Sam, waiting to buy tickets to see a movie they had both been dying to see. Both friends had been too busy to see it when it came out opening weekend, so Sam made definite, non-negotiable plans with Steve that week, calling for an emergency “Tête-Bro-Tête”: Sam’s nickname for their solo outings that Steve wasn’t particularly fond of. Well, actually he didn’t mind it;
Tony sighed deeply. “I’m sorry, Steve. But I have to use most of the weekend to sort through this fucking mess,” he pushed away from Steve but held onto him, “maybe we can have dinner on Sunday?”
“…I had a meeting with him this past Friday in his office. He left for a second to place a phone call, so I…ended up looking through some of the files on his desk…” She sounded so embarrassed.
Steve carefully turned onto his back. Tony began snoring loudly, squirming a little until his body went completely still. Steve watched him settled until he turned his head to stare at the ceiling. He scolded himself once more before squeezing his eyes shut, trying to succumb to sleep, feeling dejected.
“I’m going to just hang out for a bit before ramming the shit out of you because ‘a’, you’re soft and cute and ‘b’, it won’t be fun for either of us if you get hurt. But mostly it’s because you’re soft and cute.”
Steve watched her as Sharon leaned in close. “The people working on your project are really nice. Tony seems more down to earth than you give him credit for.”
Steve nodded. The two were facing each other on their sides. “…during my last relationship…I don’t know…we really didn’t do much…
The end of the receiver went silent before May responded. “Steve, Tony’s a good dad, I just wish he would believe it himself…he calls…a lot when they’re apart…he’s done it less since he started seeing you, though…”
“Poor Peter. He begged me to come along. I ended up promising him that we could spend an extra month or so out at the house in Malibu for the summer…well hopefully anyway…who knows with the end of the world looming over our heads.”
“Okay, whatever. I don’t want to make a fuss about it because this is supposed to be about Sam and Shuri, so I’ll just sleep out in the living room area.”
He then walked back toward his apartment, dropping his keys a few times before he finally reached the door. He turned back around and waved once more before closing the door.
Tony nodded back as he let Steve hold onto him. Steve held him tight before relaxing, staying awake until he was sure Tony was asleep.
“I’m taking my lunch break now.” Tony said with a wink, untangling himself from Steve before breaking out into a sprint toward the entrance of the lab.
my brother. I’m adopted and it was clear from the very beginning that he was always our father’s favorite.”
Steve’s facial expression grew even more concerned. His brow crinkled with indignation as he approached the stairs to confront Tony.
Obadiah was sitting at his desk in his office, fidgeting around in his chair as he was having an extremely frustrating conversation on the phone.
“Good to go.” She answered as she and Clint maneuvered around one couple to get closer to another, which was their intended target for the evening.
However, before their conversation could go any further, Thor burst through the conference room door, nearly knocking both Tony and Steve over. Bruce and Clint piled out of the room to chase after him.
Steve laughed quietly as he watched Tony slide underneath the sheets. Tony couldn’t stop himself from smiling at the sight of Steve in his bed as he leaned over to kiss him, taking his time before readjusting himself.
“Ugh, I really shouldn’t get into the middle of it.” Sam looked around before returning to directly face Tony.
Tony breathed deeply as he pulled the diary out of the desk, turning it over a few times. As he slowly cracked it open to the first page, Tony recognized almost immediately the date of his nineteenth birthday.
Yet, despite all of this, Steve remembered the good times with Tony which outweighed anything else. He also never felt close to anyone like he had with Tony; Steve could be vulnerable with Tony. Tony was there for him when he needed him. They had always been there for each other.
Obadiah flinched, but Pepper’s expression never wavered. He then looked past her to see Agent Coulson standing off to the side, waving at him with a slight grin on his face. Obadiah then turned to look at the press pool again, smiling weakly, before turning back to face Pepper. Pepper was still staring him down, indicating that he really had no choice. He coughed, trying to regain enough composure to readdress the press pool.
Tony winced; he knew everyone was reacting to the fact that if he had been in the lab with Steve, the explosion would have definitely killed him. Yet that wasn’t the thing that was bothering him the most; he was too focused on Steve’s well-being to fully process that outcome.
Tony shook his head again as he crossed his arms; he was close to tears. “You should’ve told me when I invited you.”
“I’m sorry, Dr. Banner, but it looks like the board’s wanting us to consider these options and they’re unfortunately leaning toward the open contract…”
Rhodey turned around to acknowledge Tony. Steve looked back and forth between the two as they sang along, amused by the scene.
“Tony...” Steve whispered, almost like he had upon waking up mere minutes ago. The thought made him feel so stupid.
“See, this is why I keep you around, Parker. Is Rhodey here yet?” Tony asked, making sure Peter didn’t see him looking distastefully at the stripped shirt as he straighten up to study it.
Tony looked at Natasha before giving Pepper the envelope. Pepper looked through the files as Tony leaned back in his chair, visibly upset by the new information.
Soon after, the three of them walked together to one of the docks where T’Challa kept one of his private yachts. They found Sam and T’Challa with a couple bodyguards, already on the yacht chatting.
They stayed out for a few hours before returning home. Steve had his phone on silent the entire evening and hadn’t glanced at it. He remembered, as soon as he said goodnight to Sam and entered his bedroom, that he was supposed to call Bucky and update him about his day. He figured he could do so first thing in the morning before going into the lab.
Steve was fuming. He knew working with Tony would be challenging, but that was just ridiculous. There was no need to get so upset over something so insignificant.
The group mumbled collectively in the affirmative before people began to exit the room. Tony stayed near the front.
Steve walked into the foyer as the doors opened. He walked through the suite until he found Tony standing out on the balcony, sipping from a glass of water. Steve took in two deep breaths before walking out onto the balcony, stopping short at the entrance.
“Jesus…fuck, baby.” Tony groaned. He stopped stroking Steve to reposition himself and Steve quickly reached downward to feel himself.
“Thank, god!” Tony was on his phone emailing while Steve was talking, rolling his eyes as he leaned toward the bedside table to grab something from the drawer.
“Please don’t tell me that the government couldn’t afford our troops their own beds?” Alluding to Steve’s military service; the question didn’t sound stupid or awkward, which Tony was immediately thankful for. He proceeded to slowly undress, first fumbling with his jeans before making a whole show of sliding them off. He heard Steve still giggling from the bed.
Riri nodded slowly as she approached Tony who held the chip out for her to take. She looked at Tony before carefully taking the chip.
Fury sighed as he crossed his arms again. “We don’t know the full details yet. He’s at Mount Liberty, though. Strange is his main doctor and I’ve been told his vitals are great and he’ll be okay…”
Steve remained looking at Tony. “Of course…that felt really good. I never felt like that before…” He answered quietly.
Obadiah inhaled then exhaled deeply, closing the briefcase before carefully placing it on the floor to slide into the niche. He locked the secure look on the briefcase before straightening himself out and calmy walking out of the room.
I made a mistake…ending things with Steve…” Tony leaned back into the chair. He looked everywhere except at Bruce who had placed his tablet back on the console.
“Okay, team. Let’s roll out.” Fury motioned to let everyone know that the meeting was over. Clint nearly fell of the desk but was saved by Thor, who grabbed the former by the collar of his shirt before he faceplanted onto the floor. Bruce rushed out the room, nearly tripping over Steve’s chair. Tony briskly followed him from behind, so Steve hung back in case they were discussing something personal. He felt a hand pat his back a few times. It was Natasha.
After eating, Tony, still wearing the mask, announced that it was time for Peter to work on his homework before going to bed. Peter had asked Steve to assist Tony in helping the nine-year old with his homework, although it was clear that Tony was playing along. Finally, it was time for Peter to get ready for bed which allowed Tony to finally take the mask off.
“Wait a minute, wait a minute…” Clint interrupted, appearing to add something profound to the conversation, “what about Shuri’s wedding?”
Tony reached for a tablet before walking around Steve, tapping on it as he inspected Steve’s suit. Steve’s face reddened as Tony looked all around his body, tapping on his tablet as if being this close didn’t bother him.
After a few minutes, the elevator chimed with arrival, opening the doors to reveal Steve. Tony waved at him, timidly, almost blushing from his nerves.
Steve laughed quietly as he stopped rubbing Tony’s arms to squeeze them tenderly. “Tony, don’t you think we should work on our friendship first before all of that? It’s important to me to make sure you and I are good…”
“You’re fine when someone thinks you’re messing around with Bucky, but you flipped the fuck out when it was with me? Okay.” Tony ultimately concluded.
“Tony?” He heard behind his back. At this point all Tony wanted to do was to turn to Steve and hug him as tightly as possible. He began to regret what he had said.
Tony’s eyes went wide with surprise. He had come to terms with never getting Steve back or even being friends again, but the argument with Steve confused him.
Steve continued to wait. Tony could tell that Steve had sensed that something was wrong, but Tony wasn’t sure if Steve had caught on that he was about to break up with him.
“Please, I would like for you to meet a few of Stark Industries’ board members!” Thor chuckled before pulling him over to a group of people. Steve went along, but he wanted to crawl into a hole and die.
Steve chuckled with a shrug. “…well I was kind of…thinking about it, too…because, you know, we haven’t seen each other for a while—but we don’t have to, of course.” He gestured with both hands, before placing one behind his head, clearly embarrassed.
“…can we please get back to work? We got things to do, Banner.” Tony sighed before launching his body out of the chair, appearing as if he didn’t just have a heartfelt conversation over someone he knew he was in love with but was still too afraid to admit.
Steve nodded again. He kept his eyes on Tony before walking back to the table with his workbag. Tony sighed with relief, thinking Steve was on the verge of bringing up the breakup again.
Steve rubbed a hand through his hair a few times. “Uh, well I think a combination of both. I was thinking we could walk around a bit, maybe relax by one of the pools…later Sam wanted the bridal party to take some pre-wedding photos…and then I think T’Challa’s throwing a huge party for everyone later tonight.”
After cleaning, Peter got ready for bed and Steve helped Tony tuck him in. After putting Peter to bed, Steve and Tony took their time walking to the master bedroom. Tony opened the door for Steve; Steve smiled back at him as he approached the bed, unbuttoning his shirt.
The three of them took their time walking over to the commencement area reserved for the law school and chatted a bit before the ceremony started. Tony learned more about Steve’s military service and heard some personal stories. The ceremony itself was a little too long, but it was nice being a part of something memorable for his lab partner, even if Tony hadn’t known him for that long.
“…I know someone or multiple people at Stark Industries are helping him. That’s the only way he’ll get away with this, but…” Tony cut himself off.
“Tony, if we’re going to be friends again…I need you to give yourself more credit, okay?” But Steve backed away to stand nearer to the island instead, “whatever happened between us in the past stays there, okay? That’s only way we’ll be able to make this work.”
Loki grinned as he then tapped on the access panel of the lab, using the codes Tony was forced to give to executive committee after learning more about Thanos. As the lab door clicked open Loki slipped in, relieved that no one noticed him.
Tony counted to himself while breathing deeply, wiping his eyes as he turned slightly to exit the bedroom.
Tony couldn’t handle the anticipation. He turned his phone off before placing it downward on his bedside table. He laid down in the bed with a dramatic sigh, tapping his fingers on his chest while staring up at the ceiling. After wading through a minute of anxiety-producing torture, Tony looked over at his phone. He scrunched up his face before letting out a groan as he reached over to turn his phone back on.
“So, how about this, eh? Not too bad, right?” Tony held his hands out as they walked into the space.
Tony scoffed before turning around to look over the balcony again. “Then I guess we don’t have anything to say to each other.”
“Enjoying yourself, my young friend?” An empty smile plastered Steve’s face as he turned to face Thor who was beaming at him.
“I know Steve sent you that letter, but…” Bucky started up again as it appeared that Tony was taking his time speaking, “…are you going to be calm enough to have a conversation?”
However, Steve managed not only to be there for him, but also tried to calm him through the situation. That had to mean that Steve—
Steve wrapped a hand around Sharon’s shoulder as they waited for Tony to say something. Tony gritted his teeth, knowing that he needed to project some sort of composure instead of yelling at Steve for not even telling him that he might be seeing someone else. Tony slowly looked directly at Sharon, flashing his most practiced PR smile all the while his insides were decaying into ruins.
Tony took his time rejoining Steve at the island, and they ate for some time before Steve took a moment to speak up.
Suddenly, both heard a sharp buzz, like a notification from a cell phone, emanating from the floor. Steve looked downward to see Tony’s phone laying face down next to the bed.
“…if more than half the things I’ve learned today are things Tony doesn’t know, then he has to wear the mask of shame.”
Steve sighed. “I’m not going to press it…” Steve waited as he wondered if he should continue, “…it sounds like Tony’s got a lot going on.”
“Be on the lookout for the device in the future. I can truly guarantee that Synergy will not only save lives but will also make this world a better place.”
carried away,” he winked at Steve which earned him a hearty laugh, “anyway, I forgot that my parents were planning to come back to the house before driving back to the city, so they found the living room and the kitchen nearly torn apart…I also won the competition, but I guess that's beside the point.” Tony grinned.
he thought back to that moment in the cocktail bar which quickly translated into a goofy smile, relieving any weird feeling he had about his serious conversation with Pepper.
Tony nodded again, keeping his back facing Steve. After a moment, Tony sensed that he was alone in the lab.
“Yeah, I don’t trust him either, Rogers. I’ve got Pepper on it.” Tony answered him with confidence as if he could read Steve’s mind.
“I’ve just changed my mind about the teams. I want Rogers in your lab.” Fury directed with his voice a little low.
Steve drown Bruce’s voice out as he began securing his safety uniform. He felt someone grab a hold of his arm.
Steve watched Tony glance over at him quickly before looking back at the road. “I’m sorry…I’m rambling…”
“Steve,” Tony slowly pushed Steve away so that he could look at him, “…I’m…not a good person…” He let out quietly, turning his face to the side.
“Uh, sorry…” Tony quickly picked up the clothes and the tablet, tossing them into his suitcase before motioning for Steve to lie on the bed. Steve looked at Tony then the bed before looking back at Tony again.
“You hadn’t said anything since then, so I thought it was off the table. I’m glad it’s not.” Tony looked at Steve before moving inward to kiss him. Steve eased up and kissed him back.
Rhodey laughed. “He sent me a message last night that it went well and they’re planning for round two in the near future. He didn’t send you anything?”
Tony made a whiny noise. “What? Why? I thought he was going with Bruce?” Although Tony had been impressed with Steve’s resume, he didn’t feel like hand holding the newest team member, especially with all the background shit going on at Stark Industries and in his personal life.
“What’s…is it…what time is it?” Tony mumbled, trying to wake himself up fully. He sat up halfway in the bed, slowly moving side to side as if he were stuck in quicksand.
“Uh, no, not really…” Tony quietly admitted, and thankful that Steve was alone, “I can’t sleep…also Peter’s over at May’s, so I feel like I’m being crushed by utter loneliness…” He laughed, but it hurt.
“Tony said I can look at it when it’s stable.” Peter chimed in, slightly stumbling over the word “stable”. He was bouncing in his chair as he listened to Bruce explain the project. Bruce was really trying to have a conversation with Tony, but his friend’s attention was occupied elsewhere; Tony was holding his phone underneath the table while facing slightly away from Peter and Bruce.
Tony continued to smile at Steve as Steve continued to rub his arm. They looked at each in silence for a moment before another word was spoken.
Steve barely responded as he carefully stacked the papers to the side to retrieve the diary. Tony continued to give instructions as Steve stood up with the diary, carrying it over to the kitchen for Tony to assess.
Fury looked directly at Tony and Bruce. “This can’t happen again,” he wagged a finger in their direction, “just fix it expeditiously
After finishing what they could with the Synergy device, Tony, Bruce, and Shuri piloted one of Tony’s helicopters to Roosevelt Island, radioing ahead to request permission to land on one of Middleton’s landing pads. As soon as the helicopter landed, they were met with an excited gang of conference staffers who hadn’t expected Tony to appear at their event.
When it came to shaking hands with his interviewers, Steve had taken the time to politely shake Tony’s, although he had been a little irritated with the latter’s attitude during the interview. Steve thought that if the guy didn’t have the time or will to interview people for such an important project, then he should have just stayed out of the process.
Steve smiled at Peter who was now turning red from the attention, but before he could contribute, they heard the front door unlock to the apartment.
Obadiah grimaced at Fury before smiling back at the board. “Follow me and I’ll show you all the simulation suite.” Obadiah beckoned behind himself for everyone, except Fury and Bruce, to follow him to the suite.
Tony laughed as he motioned with his hands to settle Peter. “Yes. I don’t know when he’ll stop by, but you might get to see him for a bit before going over to your aunt’s. He knows you’ll be here.”
Thor sighed loudly. “I have never seen two hearts pine for the other as I see in those two, and this includes how I feel for my dearest Jane.” It was obvious that he was still upset with his brother, but now Thor was clearly annoyed that Clint had been so oblivious, despite having been in the hospital.
Steve’s eyes widened; Tony had never seen him looked so terrified. “Tony…” Steve shook his head, “…why didn’t you call me?”
He turned once more onto his back, thinking about everything before remembering that Steve had told him he could call him if he needed anything. Tony knew Steve was most likely referring to Synergy, but it felt like after spending more time together again, Steve was also offering in terms of rebuilding their relationship.
Steve nodded as he watched Tony pack up his things. He then looked up at Steve with a coy expression.
Steve turned pink again. He wasn’t sure how to respond, especially with Tony standing not too far away.
“Tony’s doing a great job with the team.” Pepper offered to the board members in their circle. Rhodey nodded as he patted Tony on the shoulder.
Riri looked at Tony before looking back at the image, hesitating before reaching out to manipulate the image with her fingers.
Fury walked up to Steve to pat him gently on the arm before shaking his hand. “It’s good to see you up and about, Rogers.”
After looking through some items in the dining room and the living room, Tony and Steve were sitting in the middle of the living room next to the fireplace, eating a pizza they had ordered.
Steve paused before nodding. Tony nodded back again, forgetting for about half a second the weird tension between them.
The thought had come so easily to him, but he wasn’t entirely sure where it originated. Okay, so he and Tony would spend the night together and sometimes get dinner, but besides work, the two would only see each other a couple nights a week, if that. Would Tony even want to spend more personal time with him? Especially since the talk Tony had given Steve about needing to be more responsible? Steve hadn’t even met Peter yet, which had been bothering him a great deal lately, so why would Tony even want to go on a ride with him?
Steve blushed slightly from the attention. “Oh well, he’s easy to be around…,” he scooted closer toward Tony, “so are you…” he finished softly.
Tony smiled back at Steve before leaning forward. He held up the device. “Four hours until we get to the hotel, about two hours to get ready and possibly scout out the place, then that would give us the rest of the evening to gather any information we need on the buyers.”
The comment shocked both Steve and Tony as the two looked at each other before facing Mr. Beck again.
As the band and Tony continued on, Bucky bumped into Steve, smiling ridiculously as he tried to get his friend to dance with him. Steve sighed as he moved with Bucky, motioning for everyone else to sway or dance as Tony sang.
Steve swiveled around in his chair, mimicking the call to attention that was given by everyone else in the room at the sound of Tony Stark’s voice. Tony stood in the doorway of the room, wearing a grey blazer with a Black Sabbath band t-shirt underneath, complete with jeans. He was fiddling with a pair of sunglasses in his hands. Steve hadn’t meant to stare, but he also didn’t think he would see Tony again until later in the project.
“What happened at the police precinct in New York won’t happen again. The device is more robust than ever.” Tony added with skillful confidence.
They entered the building and walked up the stairs to Steve’s apartment, continuing to chat about work. As soon as they entered, Tony couldn’t believe that he was finally alone with Steve in his apartment. He stood awkwardly in the living room, watching Steve fumble around in the kitchen for some plates. He thought maybe he should sit down but waited until Steve joined him with their slices of cake.
Steve waited, although he was sure he looked completely terrified. Pushing himself beyond his usual dating limits was turning out to be the worst thing he had ever done. He wished he had taken his time like he had done in the past. Now Tony sounded more upset with him than about the kiss and he feared his actions might not only ruin their personal relationship, but also Project Synergy.
“Yeah, you should try anyway, Peter.” Steve answered as he waited for either Bucky or Sam to appear in the living room.
“Barton was attacked last night…he was doing some work in your lab before someone assaulted him.” Fury coolly explained.
“Jesus fucking Christ…” Tony said out loud, rubbing his chest, thinking about every inch of his body Steve had either touched or licked.
“Holy shit!” Clint shouted, nearly dropping the binoculars from excitement, “he made it! And he has Stark!”
Steve had also learned during the tour that Tony was a recent adoptive parent, which came as the biggest shock of the day. He overheard Bruce asking Tony about someone named “Peter”. Steve had figured it was either a colleague or another friend of theirs, but Tony answered by mentioning Peter’s aunt and his middle school art class. Natasha then had the decency to whisper to Steve that Peter was Tony’s adopted son.
“Why aren’t you as drunk as I am right now?” He leaned forward as if the move would help him further investigate as to why Steve was the most sober person at the party.
With a bit of a withdrawn smile, Steve looked over at Tony who was grinning. “Well it helps having a great partner. Nice to meet you too, Colonel.”
“Tony, I understand…” He moved his hand up the length of Tony’s arm, “honestly, I don’t think I would be lying in your bed right now if I thought you weren’t a good parent…” He smiled back at Tony, noticing that the other appeared uneasy.
“Hopefully this won’t mess with your move-in plans with Bucky.” Tony said as Steve slowed down next to him. He had meant for the comment to sound like a joke, but his tone came off deeply sarcastic instead.
