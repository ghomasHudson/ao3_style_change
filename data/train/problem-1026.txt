“All right then,” Sherlock said. “Do you care if I ask my parents to just drive us there? It seems stupid to waste money on a taxi."
John went up to his room and put on a pair of soft flannel pajama pants and un undershirt. He brushed his teeth and headed into Sherlock's room, smiling at the vase of flowers in there as well. Sherlock had really gone all out. John would never have expected this.
"Yes, it was," Sherlock said. "Which is why I've added it to the list of thing you owe me." He took a sip of tea. "I didn't get a single thing done."
John carefully opened the gown and barely held down the curse. "You've got to be more careful --" He stopped as Sherlock's gaze cut to Mycroft. Right. He'd been lectured already. He tied the gown again and stepped back. "They're right. You have to rest so this bruising can heal. The colours . . . well, they're probably deep so it'll be good not to stress them too much," he added.
“I’ve always liked you more,” Sherlock confessed. “I mean, I’m not sure I knew it was . . . the kissing type of more, but you’ve always been different.”
“Do what you like,” Sherlock said. He punched his pillow a little and stuck in behind his back as he leaned up against the wall. He glanced at the window. “My dad’s home. Good -- it won’t be long until they go to bed. Should I start the film?”
He stepped into the bar which was already louder and more busy than he wanted it to be. He looked around and found John almost immediately. He moved through the crowd and stood behind John. That was the moment he realised he really wasn’t sure what he was going to say, how he was going to explain how or why he’d gone to so much trouble to find him.
John watched Sherlock's face as he came--he was gorgeous lost in pleasure. John kissed his mouth and let go, coming into Sherlock's hand and moaning his name against Sherlock's lips.
Once they were nude, Sherlock fell onto John again, kissing his mouth roughly as his hand slid up John's side and slid under his arm to grip his shoulder. John moaned in surprise, kissing back just as hungrily. His hands moved down Sherlock's waist and back, gripping his hips to tug him close.
“So good,” Sherlock moaned. His hips rocked with the movement of John’s hand, and it was almost hard to breath. He knew it wouldn’t be long until he did explode and the kiss became even more urgent.
John kissed him more enthusiastically, his hand in his curls again. Sherlock lifted his hands to John’s head, tipping it to deepen the kiss. A small moan escaped his lips as his body slid closer to John’s.
"That's what they all say," Sherlock said. He wanted a cigarette. "Why here? Why not somewhere else?"
Unless he went out . . . then he could be on his own for a bit. Well, not on his own exactly, there’d be people on the street, but they’d be busying themselves with their own lives and would give Sherlock space. Which is what he needed right now, at least for a short time. This had nothing to do with John – to be honest, Sherlock was surprised to find how much he’d liked being with John since they’d started living together. But Sherlock still liked being alone, especially after such a long sleep. He stood up and decided not even to bother changing out of his slept-in clothes. He opened his bedroom door and walked stridently to the door to slip on his coat, calling, “I’m going out!”
“It is not,” Sherlock said. “It’s the 22nd of December. I believe that Christmas is three days away.” He glanced over at John for confirmation and also, if he were honest, some help.
“Maybe,” Sherlock said. “I do intend to keep drinking, though, so I recognise that I should have some food in my stomach at some point.”
John stood up and took Sherlock's hand, pulling him into the sitting room. He backed Sherlock to his chair and pushed him lightly, so he fell back into it. There was no going back now.
Sherlock fell onto John’s bed, pulling him down on top of him. He kissed his mouth hungrily. He hadn’t thought a lot about this part of being together -- mostly he’d just been hoping to be around John all the time -- but this all felt so good, so urgent.
John pulled Sherlock's pants down and licked a long stripe along the shaft. He took the head into his mouth before starting to bob slowly. Sherlock let out a low groan as his hand moved from John's shoulder to rest softly at the back of his head. John bobbed steadily, gazing up at Sherlock as he moved.
John closed the book. He leaned over a pressed a quick kiss on his lips. "Thank you," he said, looking away quickly and focusing on his pastry.
John's phone buzzed in his pocket, and his heart sped up even more. They looked over at him. Amanda came over and pulled the phone from his pocket. “It’s your boyfriend,” she said sarcastically.
His mum broke the tension by coming out to the garden. Sherlock quickly dropped his cigarette into his lemonade glass.
“We came a couple times when you were a baby,” his mum said. “Back when we were young and thought it was fun to sleep on cots. Then we realised beds were a million times better, and we stopped coming.” She winked at Sherlock’s dad.
Saturday John slept in and woke up excited. He pulled his phone close but resisted texting Sherlock just yet. He went to his desk and worked on some paperwork and paid his own bills  before making breakfast. Finally he decided to send a quick text.
“Yes, it’s all right with me,” Sherlock said. He finished his tea. “Can I ask . . . did you come over here just to ask me to dinner?”
"Is that what you got out of the story?" John asked. "The hero saved the day. He chose his help and that's important."
Sherlock pushed John off him and then sat up. He unbuttoned his shirt and threw it onto the floor. He started taking off his trousers. “Are you going to as well?” he asked.
Sherlock crinkled his eyebrows for a moment, annoyed that Lestrade seemed to not care about his accomplishment.
"Does it involve me getting naked because it's too cold to be naked, John," Sherlock said. "Normally you complain when I'm not dressed properly but now that it's freezing out you want my clothes off? This weather has turned you nasty."
In the taxi, Sherlock sat quietly for a few minutes. “Perhaps no kissing while we’re working,” he said.
“Yours,” Sherlock said, pulling him up the stairs. He pushed him onto the bed and crawled over him. He slid his hand into John’s jeans, wrapping his fingers around his cock. Then he dipped down and kissed John hungrily.
John was pacing in the lobby, two of Mycroft's men keeping him out of the hall. "I need to see Sherlock," he said for the hundredth time. They simply stood there. He growled in frustration, eyeing the men and considering fighting his way through, but the other people in the hospital didn't need that drama.
John left the computer open now, checking the blog every time he happened to pass. The count was slowly going up -- only a couple new readers but he felt a spike of excitement regardless. People were sending cases through, but John didn't take all of them. He wanted to start slow. He didn't even know if he wanted to properly 'start'. He wasn't a detective. In fact, at this moment, he didn’t even know what he was. This was just passing some time. He wanted to acknowledge every comment that came through, though, and he noticed the newest one.
Sherlock set his mug down and then tentatively started to stroke John’s hair. “This okay?” he whispered.
“Well, I’ll leave you to it then,” Sherlock said. “I want to start early in the morning. Night then.” He stopped into the bathroom and then disappeared into his room.
“It was fine,” he mumbled and then realised that probably wasn’t enough. He glanced over. “It was good, and you looked very beautiful.”
"It’s for the stupid ritual -- the dark makes it special," Harry teased. John glared at her. “I heard you talking on the phone,” she said with a smirk.
"You win," Sherlock said. He pushed the door shut and stepped in front of it. "You hide now." He closed his eyes even though the room was quite dark. "Go."
She turned back to the sink. “Fine,” she said. “When I’ve finished cleaning up your mess, you can come downstairs and help me.”
By the end of the week he agreed to go out for a drink when they closed the surgery.  She was easy to talk to. They tried to stay away from talking about work. They talked about school and their training. John told her a bit about his plan to move closer to work. It was a fun night. At the end as they waited for her taxi, she leaned in and kissed him. John pulled back.
“I’m an excellent dancer,” Sherlock said. “Perhaps if I get another drink, you might get a chance to witness it.”
“Good,” Sherlock said. “Yes, it’s good.” He took another sip of tea. “Do you need any help with anything?”
too much to type out . . . every thought of John was so big in Sherlock's head right now. He wished he could head home right now to see him, but it was late and cold out, so then he considered just offering to pay for a taxi to bring John here, but that seemed equally ridiculous. Perhaps he should just simply blame the thoughts on what his mother called 'the holiday spirit', but deep down he knew John had changed him.
"Hmm? Oh, I just meant showing up every day at the bookstore might start looking odd so it's a good idea to skip a day."
Another difference: they hadn’t been talking about work. Had Mycroft been right? Sherlock didn’t believe his brother’s orders were really been about working -- Mycroft Holmes would never discourage work. Was this whole thing just about separating John and Sherlock?
“You wanted it to be easier, didn’t you?” she asked. “Coming back -- you were hoping everything would be the same.”
John cleaned himself up and looked around. "I doubt it," he said. “It’s too dark for them to see anything anyway.”
He woke with a start. The room was bright with the morning sun. He was on the sofa, and his back hurt. He pushed himself up and stretched. He didn’t quite feel rested -- he wasn’t sure if the dream meant something or if it was just a reminder of his awkwardness.
“I can see that,” Sherlock said, deliberately staring at John’s body without meeting his eyes. “But I asked you to come sit by me.”
John counted to fifty before standing with a slight wobble. "Ready or not, here I come!" He moved towards the kitchen first and looked inside, then moved to the hall to check the bathroom and shower. "Oh Sherlock . . ." he sang playfully.
“I did,” he said. “I mean, we do -- I just solved my part quickly, and now I too am bored.” He got two mugs from the cupboard.
Sherlock woke up. He was shirtless but still wearing his trousers, socks and shoes. He pushed himself up off the mattress and dragged himself to the bathroom where he splashed his face. He went back to his bedroom and got into his pajamas before going into the kitchen to put the kettle on.
“Well, before you, I rarely ever had meals,” Sherlock said. “At first it annoyed me, but I’ve got used to it. I’ve had to get used to a lot of new things.” He glanced over at John and gave him a genuine smile. “All in all, though, I’m glad we’re together.”
But there had been no skill, not like Sherlock. It was sheer chance that John figured it out. The point was that it was done, and he had found the answer.
"You can't keep evidence -- you'll be in trouble," he said. "You could call them and examine it at the station with them."
“I won’t -- you know how I am,” Sherlock said. He pushed the stool back and stood up. “Come on, I should go wash these things.” He picked up the bucket.
John pressed him into the wall and pressed against him as they kissed, his one hand tangling in Sherlock's hair.
Sherlock turned on his side to face John. “You make things better,” he said and then leaned in to kiss him again.
“No, John,” Sherlock said. “I wanted you to come. I wanted you to help, but I didn’t give you the chance.” He turned his head a little to avoid meeting John’s eyes. “I’m not good at this -- at thinking of others. That’s why I stay on my own. But you’re different . . . I don’t know why but I know you are.”
Sherlock felt warm, good --better than he had in such a long time. “I’m home now,” he said. “I’ll be here tomorrow morning and every morning . . .”
Harry sat in John's chair. "You tell me. I want to see you in action. And anything John has told you doesn't count so it's like you say to your clients: don't be boring," she smiled.
“I’m just tired,” Sherlock said. Then he confessed, “It’s my back -- I got hurt.” He was glad the lights were off.
John nodded, sliding his hand into Sherlock's hair. He glanced at Sherlock's lips before closing the space and kissing him softly.
After about an hour of sitting in the quiet, John got up to make tea in the now tidied kitchen, pouring one for Sherlock as well and then going to his room. He knocked lightly and let himself in with the mugs.
Sherlock lifted his hand to his head again. He tried to remember what had caused the fall. “Rehab?” he asked.
“You can have the big bed in the my parents’ room, if you want, and there are two beds in the one I’m sleeping in. You can sleep wherever you want.” He set his mug down. “I just wanted you to be comfortable since you helped me,” he added quietly. “It’s all right if you want to lie down here.”
He heard nothing back that night or the next day. Fair enough -- perhaps the client was done with it. Or maybe he didn’t want to believe it. John understood that impulse.
"It's not sudden," she said. "It's just . . . I want to get to know him better now that you two . . ."
Sherlock sat back down to close everything up. He'd liked that touching, and John seemed okay with it. Hopefully this was a good sign. When he finished he got up to move over to the sofa.
"Just give me one second to finish answering this," John said, typed up the last of the response and then stood up with a stretch, moving to the kitchen to start the kettle.
“It was good,” Sherlock said, giving John a sly smile. “Which is why I might be interested. However, I’m aware that frequently people who did what we did also do other things . . . like spend every moment of the day together or nag each other or want clear answers to every single question asked. Any thoughts on those things?”
"We're not going out to a fashion show, John," Sherlock said. Then he unbuttoned his shirt and set it next to him on the chair. He pulled off his socks before standing up, turning around and taking off his trousers. He quickly sat down and then threw his clothes over to John. "Hurry," he said. "I'm really freezing now."
"Hmm, I don't believe that," she said. She moved on to the bookshelf, then turned towards Sherlock. "Who put the headphones on that skull?"
When John woke up Harry was sitting at the end of the sofa, eyes red and puffy as she looked down at her hands.
“Your hand smells funny,” Sherlock said quietly. He swallowed awkwardly. “I didn’t really do anything . . . with Ellen. I didn’t know what I was supposed to do . . “
"The . . . physical part. I mean, if that's the kind of love you're talking about," Sherlock said. "I have to admit, after thinking about, it is the kind I'm talking about it, but we don't have to do that if you're not interested -- it's not mandatory, for me, I mean."
"No, it didn't scare me. I mean there's no sexiness to scare me," he corrected poorly. "It was just a dream. Drop it."
“I’d rather . . .” Sherlock said. He sat himself up properly and reached to hold John's cock again. “I’ve got condoms . . . do you have lube?”
"What? Of course I'm being normal," John said. He didn't look at Sherlock as he took off his coat. "That sounded like an interesting case Greg was telling us about."
John moved down lower, sucking one nipple and playing with the other. Sherlock's cock twitched which only made John's even harder. He pressed his hips to Sherlock's thigh so he would feel it.
Sherlock shook his head. “Just trying to figure out how much I’d need to use if I wanted to poison a flatmate who came home in a sour mood,” he said with a smile, handing John a cup. “What’s up?”
“They wouldn’t be adventures without you,” Sherlock said. He laced their fingers together and squeezed John’s hand.
Harry laughed again. "Spot on, detective!" She turned to John. "Hid yourself away when you came back, didn't you? Is that how you won him over then? Playing that no one would help you so he'd take you in?"
John smiled and reached out to touch his face, but Sherlock kept talking. “We’ve made a mess of your bed, I’m afraid,” he said.
John laughed. "They were all sport games!" He finished up his tea. "Just show me where the stuff is. By the time you finish making the rest of dinner, I'll have a nice fire going for the meat."
Sherlock moved and bent down, sitting on his knees between John’s knees. He pushed John’s legs further apart and began rubbing John’s thighs, massaging the muscles and separating them even more. He leaned in and rested his head on one of John’s legs, reaching up to unbutton John’s jeans. “I missed your taste . . .” he whined softly.
John shook his head. "Maybe a shower, though. I think that will help." He folded the paper and put it down. He grabbed his robe and paused on his way to the bathroom. He opened his mouth, then thought better of it. "Be back in a bit."
“This is a change,” she said. “Up early and doing something nice for your parents.” She lifted his cup to thank him.
When John didn't hear anything back right away, he closed the computer and went to make himself something to eat. He wasn't sure if he was going to type this client’s case up at all. It wasn't his best work. For a second he smiled, remembering Sherlock being upset when John posted his unsolved ones as well. The smile faded just as quickly as he looked around the flat and felt an ache in his chest. The client’s hope brought back a feeling of emptiness.
"I know that," John said. "I was just saying. I mean, a lot of people aren't really listening and it’s going to make this last longer. I'm glad you yelled at him."
John blinked and took the bag from him. He smiled slowly and looked up at him. "Thanks," he said. “This’ll be enough.”
Sherlock wasn’t unaware of what going on obviously. He and John had watched the Prime Minister announce the lockdown, but there was a small part of him that thought it wouldn’t quite apply to him – whether he was assuming he’d be working for the police, or maybe his brother would have some influence, Sherlock hadn’t thought out the details. Perhaps he was just trying to avoid thinking about the whole thing. It was much easier to pretend that this was one of the little games he and John sometimes played – John would nag him and Sherlock would fuss, but they always worked it out. He’d promised to stay home while John was at work today, and in many ways it hadn’t seemed much different than any other day.
Sherlock steeled himself -- he was going to have to have a conversation with her. "What do you mean? The milk's here," he said, holding up the bottle.
"Yes," he said. "I'll make it." John took a sip of tea and got up, stretching again before going into the kitchen. "You like eggs and stuff, right?" he asked.
Sherlock started to move his hips, slow and steady, focusing on making this last, despite the urge to thrust and the ache to come. He pressed his chest against John’s back and whispered in his ear, “I missed you so much . . . I hate when you’re not with me.”
“Does that mean you told her about what happened?” Sherlock asked. “I’d assumed you’d be using some discretion.”
John smiled softly as he kept petting Sherlock's hair. "Why are you always so mean to me?" he teased.
"I suppose in the past I've tried," Sherlock said. He reached over and turned John's head toward him. "Don't forget this, all right?" he said. "Inevitably, I will annoy you - I know I have and I will again, I'm sure. When I do, though, remember this moment, all right?"
"I was thirsty," Sherlock said. "I'm not a cheater." He kicked off his shoes. "There." He scooped up the cards. "I'll deal," he said, shuffling the cards a few times and then dealt out the cards. He looked at his. All hearts. He kept his face straight.
"I've quit. That's why I'm here -- making amends or whatever that step is. Come on, John. I don't mind the sofa. Please? It's just for a few days."
Sherlock did his best not to sigh. "I am testing some chemicals," he said flatly. "I'm not particularly interested in explaining it to you, and I doubt you'd find that explanation interesting anyway. You are in London, the least boring city in the world. Don't you have something else you could be doing?"
"I already knew what addicts are like," Sherlock said. "But you know who Harry is, how she was before. It's logical that you want to help her."
Sherlock stared at the text. This did not bode well. He tried to think of everything he'd done in the last 24 hours that would have upset John, but nothing came to mind. Recently, he'd actually been trying to be extra good -- John had really helped on their first case, everyone knew it, but only Sherlock knew John had saved his life. So he'd been trying. But now John was cross at him, and he had no idea why.
Sherlock was confused by the interaction, but maybe being here was useful -- perhaps his knowing what she was doing would help ensure she treated John well and, more importantly, ensure she'd leave sooner.
John came in drying his hair with the towel and saw the two of them looking a bit awkward. "Everything okay?" he asked.
“He said you said to give him forty pounds,” John said, groaning when he saw Sherlock shaking his head. "To be honest, I thought for sure that car was going to be Mycroft. Does he know about this visit? He'll lock me up next."
John followed, stepping out of his trousers and pants. He took his shirt off then went back to Sherlock's clothes, climbing over him. "You're so sexy," he said as he peeled off Sherlock's shirt.
“Unlikely,” he laughed. He held the door open for her and said, “I’m going to finish this out here. I’ll get us drinks in a moment if you can manage to wait to start on the liquor.”
“You solved the case and you’re alive -- not stupid at all,” Sherlock said. “I suppose you’ll just have to admit you’re as recognisable as I am. Perhaps we should get you a hat?”
Sherlock slipped off his shoes and then grabbed his book, dropping it near the head of his sleeping bag. He still felt quite hot so he lay down on top of it instead of getting inside. But it felt a little prickly, almost like something was stinging through his t-shirt, so he couldn’t get comfortable.
“Keep looking,” Sherlock said. “Are you going to tell me what the problem is or are you just going to behave normally? Those are your two options. Choose one.”
John followed Sherlock, in just his pants. "Me too," he said. He pushed off his pants and almost got into the bed. "I should get something for us to clean up with first," he said.
John just smiled and then poured a bit of lube on him. He rubbed the spot and pushed his finger in as he bobbed his head.
“It’s nice,” Sherlock said quietly. He looked over at the television as his hand continued to move. He let his fingers drift down the side of John’s neck, tickling the skin there.
John rolled his eyes and huffed a soft laugh, embarrassed he'd misinterpreted but relieved by the break in tension. "Sherlock . . . I thought you were being serious."
Sherlock lifted his glass and then stopped as if he was thinking. "Oh yeah . . . I remember now," he said wistfully, raising the glass to his lips and starting to tip it. He stopped before the wine spilled into his mouth, and then set the glass on the table. "Just kidding," he said. "But for a moment, you were incredibly curious, weren't you?"
Sherlock closed his eyes and just let the pleasure take over his mind. He kept his hand moving on John, but his body rocked with John’s hand’s rhythm. “What do you want now?” he asked, finally opening his eyes.
"Good," John said. He took his temperature and focused on his breathing. "My temperature is normal and I'm breathing fine."
Sherlock walked up to John’s room and tidied up the bed. He wondered if they’d sleep in his room tonight. He went downstairs and lay down on his bed. He looked over at the pillow next to him, picturing John’s face there. It made his heart feel nice, but it was quite exciting as well. Maybe they could have an early night.
“We’ll always have to deal with him,” Sherlock said. “I don’t need him to take care of me. I . . . I can do better and maybe you can help me.”
Sherlock knew that was as good as he was going to get from his brother, so he focused on that as he packed his things.
"Well that's all I can ask, really." John checked the time. "I'm going to check my temperature before we go to bed. I'll be right back."
John stopped for a minute to think. Sherlock loved him? He slid up against Sherlock, spooning him. “Maybe I feel the same,” he said, putting a kiss on his back.
Sherlock immediately made a mental note to identify the noisiest boards and be sure to walk on them more frequently. He stood there for a moment, trying to listen through the door. What was John doing in there? He’d been in there forever.
"How come . . . I mean . . ." John tried to get his thoughts together. "Why me? Why am I different?"
John flushed lightly. Sherlock was all of those things for him as well. All this time John was dating girls thinking his first time should be more . . . traditional, but he realised now that was stupid. He was attracted to both, why couldn't his first time be with a boy? Especially a boy he already liked?
Sherlock set the mug on the table and sat down on his chair, taking a sip of his own. "It'd probably be best if you listen to John and go to bed," he said, trying to sound calm.
“I think you’re the knight because you’re handsome,” Sherlock said. “Didn’t you say the knight was handsome?”
“How about not getting dressed then?” Sherlock asked. “It’s three in the afternoon and I’m still wearing my pajamas. Is that really so bad?”
“Will you come with me tomorrow?” Sherlock asked tentatively. “I want to go see the other bodies . . . I could use your medical expertise.”
“Thanks,” she said, blushing a little. “I am happy, Sherlock. I had a beautiful wedding, a lovely honeymoon and now I’m married to a wonderful man for the rest of my life.”
Sherlock set his phone on the table and took a few more deep breaths. He had absolutely no idea how this was going to go, but he wasn’t going to turn back now.
John wasn’t entirely sure he was serious, but asked, “How long is this story? I don't want to sleep on the sofa another night.”
"I wasn't lying. I just wanted to be sure. This memory thing is a bit worrying," he said. He sat down again and kept watching Sherlock closely.
Sherlock woke up quite early on Christmas morning. He couldn’t hear any noises downstairs, so he stretched out and just lay there for a little while. The bed wasn’t as big as the one at home, but it was comfortable. He decided he wanted to talk to John, but before he picked up the phone, he realised  John was probably still sleeping. There wasn’t really a reason to wake him.
Sherlock had just finished shaving and was getting dressed when he heard John come in. He emerged and saw John. He looked extremely handsome and Sherlock felt like kissing him, but he looked quite engrossed in whatever he was reading and he didn’t want to irritate him.
“Thank god we’ve got some work,” Sherlock said. “You were starting to drive me a bit mad, if I’m honest.”
Sherlock kissed John’s mouth and then moved a bit to reach the drawer, pulling it open and grabbing the box and bottle. He pushed John down onto the bed and crawled over top of him. He grabbed John’s hand and pulled it toward him. “Keep going,” he said.
John let his knees fall open even more as he groaned softly, feeling every inch of Sherlock as he was filled. His hands held Sherlock's arms, squeezing lightly.
“But I thought . . .” Sherlock said, now genuinely hurt. “Fine, that’s fine. Go out. I don’t feel like being around someone who is behaving like an idiot.” His voice sounded meaner than he wanted it to. “I’m bored with this conversation.” He flopped onto the sofa and tried to go away into his head.
Sherlock had his eyes closed as well. “Once it started getting dark, John suggested they head home to the cave. The whole way back John complained about being hungry. He could not stop talking about it, which was quite annoying. Sherlock offered to cook up the bird he’d dissected, but John said no. Finally Sherlock suggested they go see a guy who could help.
“I see,” Sherlock said again. He wore a sly smile. “And where would you like to be not tired tonight? In the bedroom perhaps or right here at the sink?”
Sherlock lined up and slowly pushed inside. “God, John,” he moaned. He dropped his head and kissed John’s mouth. “You okay?” he whispered.
Sherlock turned his body, lifting a hand to the side of John’s head. He felt his fingers in John’s hair as he pulled their faces closer. His heartbeat quickened and he wanted to get his body even closer. John pulled away from his mouth to kiss along Sherlock's jaw and down to his neck. He nipped the skin lightly, licking those spots.
“You’re right,” Sherlock said. He unbuttoned the rest of his shirt and slipped it off. “There I feel better,” he said. “But I’m cold now. Can you pass the blanket?”
Sherlock helped his parents carry their bags out to the car. "Are you going for a month?" he asked as he climbed into the car.
"It's okay," John said, using the shirt as well and tossing it off the bed. He scooted closer to Sherlock and just stared at him, admiring his flushed face.
"I mean, even if I was acting differently it doesn't really matter! There's nothing wrong. We have work to do. "
John whined when Sherlock stopped, his cheeks flushing at the sound. He stood up and moved quickly to the kitchen, hoping Sherlock didn't hear.
“There are books at the cottage, I’m sure he can find one to read there,” Mycroft said. “He’s taking a break from work and you, I’m afraid, represent work.”
“I’m not that kind of man,” Sherlock said, glancing over and giving him a wink. He tugged John’s arm lightly to turn them down an alley.
“Fine,” he said looking over at John. “Eat well tonight because apparently we won’t have anything to eat while we’re away.”
“There’s no rules about grieving, John,” she said. “But it has been six months . . . he wouldn’t have wanted this. I know he didn’t understand love, I know he didn’t understand the grief that would come . . . but we have to figure out a way to live again.”
"There's tea," his mother said as he walked by. He made a grumble and went to the kitchen to pour himself a cup. She followed him. "If you want to ride with us, you'll need to be ready by nine."
John tilted his head lightly and nodded. "Okay, sure," he said. He stood up and excused himself to Mrs. Hudson, walking with Sherlock to the bar.
“Thanks,” he mumbled. He’d been hoping to be on his own for the ride back to school. He glanced over and she was still looking at him, which he knew meant he should say something else. “Your part was good.”
Sherlock kept himself from smiling. “All right then,” he said. “Last question and then I promise we need never speak of this again,” he said, leaving a pause too short for John to interrupt and stop him. “What is it about me you find so disgusting?”
John let them in and immediately remembered the last time, pressing Sherlock against the door. He smiled wider as he faced Sherlock who kissed John roughly as his arms slid up John’s back, pulling him even closer. John moaned into the kiss, and Sherlock pushed back against him, sliding his hands to begin undoing John’s belt. John started moving them towards the bedroom again, keeping as close as he could. Sherlock continued to try to get John's clothes off as they moved and then gave up, starting to take off his own.
John stuck his tongue out before going to the bathroom and getting ready for bed. He came back and climbed in. "Don't kick me like last time," he teased.
"Why does everything have to be so stupidly complicated?" Sherlock sighed. "Getting the ingredients was pain enough and . . . no matter, noodles are not going to ruin our night. We can order in and eat the salad while we wait. Have you tried the salad? You don't have to boil parts of salad first, right?" He took a quick bite. "Yes, that's fine -- what should we order?"
“It’s romantic,” Molly corrected him. “That’s all that matters. To me, at least -- I know you don’t feel the same.”
She watched him thinking. Eventually he said, “You’re right, I suppose. But if something goes wrong, will you come pick us up straight away if I call?”
"A little bit, but I think it's because I did it with you," he said. He shifted a bit. "It's a good different."
John grazed his teeth over Sherlock's neck, down to the nape where he bit and sucked a light mark. "And yet here you are," he said softly, smiling against his skin.
Sherlock reached around John and took over for him, stroking his cock firm and steady before picking up speed. His hips followed and began to move a bit faster, pushing deeper. “God,” he said in a deep, low moan. “You’re so good . . . it’s so good,” he mumbled.
Things were going really well until he started talking to his mum about it. She wasn’t upset about any of it, but a conversation they had put doubts in John’s head he couldn’t shake. She didn’t seem surprised at all that John was dating a boy. When John pressed her on it she admitted she assumed Sherlock and him would end up together. It surprised John -- he had never thought about Sherlock that way but then again they had been really young. When he went back to school after the weekend and kept seeing his boyfriend, he couldn’t stop seeing Sherlock, comparing them. They fought and eventually things ended.
Sherlock lifted himself off the bed, taking his shirt off and throwing it to the ground. He lay back down and reached to pull John on top of him.
Sherlock exhaled loudly against John's kiss as his body adjusted to John's intrusion. He wrapped his arms around John's back and squeezed him, wanting him to be as close as physically possible -- closer than he'd ever been to another person.
“Because you wanted something to work on,” Mycroft said. “And I wanted to see how well you worked. Since you’ve gained your new ‘partner’ I’ve been worried you’d be distracted. Yes, I know you’ve done a few private clients, but I’ve yet to see anything . . . serious, shall we say? Exposing adulterers may be useful to the public, but if you’re going to be useful to me, I need to know your intentions as well as your skills.”
“This is the first thing I’ve eaten really,” Sherlock said. “But I knew you were coming so I wanted to have something.”
"God," Sherlock said, pulling off John and standing up. "I need you to touch me." He pulled open his own trousers, letting them drop to the floor and grabbing at one of John's hand, leading it to his own cock. He then gripped John, starting a smooth, slow stroke on his wet, warm cock.
John didn't say anything at first. "Look," he finally said. "Some things were said last night, but it was after all the chaos so I don't even know if it's real."
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said, getting up and moving over to the sofa. “It just seems like this whole part of your life excludes me –- you leave the flat all the time just to find someone new to like because liking me isn’t enough for you. I knew this would happen really, but . . . I don’t like it. That’s my business, though, it doesn’t mean you have to stop. I just wanted to say I don’t like it.”
Sherlock handed John a cup of tea. “Thank you for coming home,” he said and sat down. He waited for John to do the same.
“I thought --” John started and then looked over at him smiling. He nodded, moving back to lean on the pillow against the headboard. "Okay," he said and patted his thigh.
"It's just us," Sherlock mumbled through their kisses. He reached down and slipped his hand inside boxers, letting his hand explore John's cock.
Sherlock sighed and looked out at the woods. “You know you said you’d like to live out here? I still don’t know if I could, but if I had to, you’d have to be here,” he said.
"Oh -- Sherlock, God . . . " John moaned, gripping his curls. His head fell back against the wall as he tried to keep his breath steady.
John shook his head, willing her not to keep bothering Sherlock. "Just . . . sit down and tell me how you got here. I mean, in the programme you're doing," he said.
Sherlock shuddering lightly, closing his eyes. "It's so much already, John . . ." he moaned softly. "It's like I've been waiting forever. . ."
"That's awfully romantic of you," John said softly. His hand, without his really thinking about it, now traced Sherlock's jaw and neck lightly.
John came between them, moaning Sherlock's name over and over as his other hand gripped Sherlock's arm.
When they arrived John paid and moved quickly to the door. He let them both in. As soon as the door was locked, he pushed up on his toes and kissed Sherlock's mouth.
A few moments later, Mycroft came in. “You’re ready, I see,” he said. He looked at John. “You’re not coming, you know.”
John reached out and touched his arm to stop him. "Hold on. You know if you call, I'll be right here," he said. “Now stop fretting -- of course you’ll solve this case because you solve everything, right?”
John closed his eyes. "We don’t need to act like there's not something here . . .something between us..." he said.
"Don't bother," Sherlock said. "You can see it whenever you'd like now." He got up and went to the kitchen, grabbing two glasses of water before returning. "Here," he said, crawling back into the bed before taking a long drink of water. It felt good going down his throat -- his body suddenly felt tired but so relaxed.
Back at the flat, Sherlock was seriously worried. It was getting dark and, besides the stupid note this morning, he hadn’t actually heard from John all day -- it could not be right. He picked up his phone again. He’d call. He prayed John would at least pick up -- if Sherlock was interrupting something, John could tell him he had the wrong number, but at least he’d hear John’s voice, which would be better than sitting here alone. He rang John’s number.
John licked his lips. "Going from a one night stand to living together?” he said. “Seems like we’d be skipping a few important steps.
John went to bed not long after Sherlock, making sure all of the food was put away before he went up. In the morning, he came down dressed to go out.
“Fine,” Sherlock said, pushing himself up on the bed. “I’ve rested -- surely that means I’m ready to go home.”
“Don’t be like that,” Sherlock said. “I was just checking -- we’re partners, right? It’s just a change, isn’t it?” He stood up and put the kettle back on. “I mean . . . you don’t think things seem different already?”
“I don’t begrudge you a little time off,” she said, sliding a mug over to him. “That school was hard and you did very, very well.” She tousled his hair a little and sat down beside him. “That said, I’ve never known my son to do nothing for very long. You should make plans for the summer.”
"It’s buffet style so we go up there to get what we want," John said, pointing to where the employees were lighting the small heating fires.
John looked him over and nodded reluctantly. "Okay," he said. He sat in his own chair and started on his food, putting the news on for background noise.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I’ll be in my room,” he said, grabbing his bag and disappearing up the stairs. He dropped his bag on the bed and then moved it to the floor, lying down and staring up at the ceiling. Like he’d done so many times before. Already he felt like a child again. He hated this feeling. He also knew it was ridiculous really -- he wasn’t a child, but an adult. He got out his phone and typed a text to John.
Sherlock snuggled against John. "I've changed my mind about the cold," he said. "Today's been my favourite day in a long time, all because of it."
“That’s a relief,” Sherlock said. “Well, I guess we’ve made it through Day 1 – things haven’t been that bad, have they?”
"I mean I like boys sometimes too, as well as girls," he said. "Maybe you do too, maybe that’s why you didn’t like the girl kissing you. It might not be, I just mean, it's okay if you do."
Sherlock looked over at John. He was so glad he was here. He leaned over and kissed his mouth softly. “Sorry,” he said, but didn’t step away.
Sherlock’s hips were rocking now against John’s hand. He did his best to keep moving on John as well, though he could feel his muscles coiling in need of relief. He leaned in and kissed John’s mouth roughly.
John pushed off of the table. "Now you're just making things up. You haven't dreamt about me and I'm sure I won't again either. It was just random. Trust me, there's no secret desire or want or anything like that. I'll prove it." He moved over to Sherlock and without thinking too much about it, he leaned in and kissed him. John kissed Sherlock hard on the mouth. "See? Nothing," he said.
John laughed softly. "I don't want this to be just a one time thing. I'd like this to be how we are now."
Sherlock grabbed one of the sleeping bags and threw it to John. Then he lifted his bag and started unpacking. He left his clothes in the bad, but grabbed some books and toiletries. There was no real place to store them, so he set them on the little table at the side of the sofa.
“I don’t know -- Mycroft said it’s done, so I’ve decided to believe him,” Sherlock said. “As for right this moment, I don’t know what happens. As far as London is concerned, my calendar is empty for all eternity.”
“I don’t want to,” he said into the phone. “Please -- I’m asking you to please not make me do this. I didn’t lie. I told you the truth about it, and I told you I don’t want to go. Please.”
“That might help with awkwardness,” Sherlock said. “Let’s change the topic for a moment. Why do you think Molly did this?”
Sherlock laughed out loud. “That makes it even better,” he said. He stretched a little and then moved closer to the wall to give John more room. “If you need anything during the night, wake me up or just go get it yourself, okay?”
He went over to his desk. Still no email from that client. He deleted the original email. He read the news and got lost online for a bit and then closed his laptop. He moved to the sink and washed up the dishes and then went into his room, lying down on his bed and trying not to think about anything.
When Sherlock woke up, his body aching. After a moment he remembered why. It’d been a long time since he’d done anything like that, but it’d been fine -- it was a wedding after all, ‘romance in the air’ as Mrs Hudson would say. He did have a bit of a headache, though. He got himself up from the bed and took himself straight to the shower.
Sherlock wiped his hands over his face again. “We should tidy this up,” he said, getting to his feet. He pushed the box to the side. “Let’s go to the shed for a minute, okay?” he said and nodded toward the shovel.
He just liked having John around. That was unusual, yes, but it was painfully true. In truth, when John would talk getting a job, Sherlock had deliberately thrown out distractions to keep him from any attempts. But now it seemed that John had still been applying and now he’d probably get a job and would lose interest in working on cases. Worse yet, he was out on a date which meant he was losing interest in being at home with Sherlock as well. Sherlock no longer felt agitated or angry or even calm. He felt sad.
“You can take care of it,” Sherlock said. “I will take care of John.” A taxi pulled up. “Give me the address.”
He leaned back and closed his eyes again. “One day John had just finished all these incredibly heroic things and was slowly making his way back home. He had to cut through a wooded area. It was dark – don’t get scared – but John thought he heard a noise behind a big oak tree. He froze. He heard the noise again. Who’s there? he called, but no one answered. John took a few steps and tried to peek around the tree. He could see a dark figure, bent over. It was doing something but John couldn’t tell what.”
“Not if you mean going out to stupid films and restaurants like you have been doing with the girls,” Sherlock said. He got up to put the kettle back on, leaving the room in silence for a moment. When he passed John to return to the sofa, he said quietly, “You know what I’m saying.”
Sherlock was at his desk, trying to focus on the article he was struggling to read. It wasn’t very interesting, but it could be useful at some point and he had nothing else to work on at the moment. However, he’d already forgotten what he’d just read, despite having read the same paragraph four times. He was starting to get frustrated and needed someone to blame. He lifted his head and saw John across the room. John would do.
Sherlock got up and looked into the oven. The timer was nearly down to zero, so he looked in the oven and saw that the cheese was melted. "I think it's done early. Are you ready to eat?" he asked as he lifted the dish and set it on the table.
“Good,” Sherlock said. “That’s what today is about.” He glanced over at Mrs Hudson, who looked back at him approvingly.
Sherlock thought for a moment. This visit home had felt different to previous ones, and he was pretty sure it was because John was in his life now. He thought he’d feel better if John were here with him. That seemed silly -- since John had never been here with him, so clearly it was not about the place but about John. Why? John was right actually: it was hard to explain.
Sherlock had not been awake long enough to deal with this. “I don’t smoke in the flat,” he mumbled. “But if you insist, I will.” He slipped his coat off, keeping his cigarette packet with him. “Why are you being so controlling today?” he asked.
Sherlock went back into the bathroom to shave and then slipped into his pajamas before tidying the flat and putting clean sheets on the bed. Just in case. Eventually he got dressed and then headed out to the restaurant.
"The questions keep going until the person guesses it correctly. Your turn went wrong because you cheated and got it before we could really start," John said.
"Of course he did," he said. He fished out his wallet and paid the driver. He got out of the car and looked up at a small cottage. He started walking up to it slowly. He couldn't help feeling this was still some kind of trap.
“Excellent,” Sherlock said with a grin. He moved to grab his phone and said to John, “Come on, get dressed, we’re going out.”
Sherlock exhaled loudly and then slowly opened his eyes. “Well, that was more entertaining than that band downstairs,” he said with a smile. He lifted a hand to wipe away the hair that was stuck with sweat to his forehead.
"Yes, I liked the twist at the end," John said. He yawned even though he had no real reason to be tired.
John looked up at her and sipped his tea. He didn't want to say it, but he knew she wouldn't go if he didn't talk. "I don't want to."
Sherlock smiled. “Well, it’s probably crime-based as well, if I’m honest,” he said. “However, we’re not staying around long enough for anything like that.” He directed John out onto the next street. “We’re headed over there,” he added, pointing to a path surrounded by trees.
They headed out and Sherlock got them a cab. They rode to the restaurant in silence. When they headed in, Sherlock sat at their regular table.
Sherlock stood up and stretched. “You still all right staying the night -- I can get you a taxi home if you prefer,” he said.
Sherlock moved over and sat down on the edge of the bed, but then he was faced away from John. So he shifted a little and moved to sit next to him, but not too close. “Things are different . . . between us, I think,” he said softly.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “Fine,” he said. He leaned forward and told John all the details -- about where he had to go, how he put things together, and the results. He explained the euphoric effects of the drug as well as the gory details about what it can do to a person’s mind and body, especially in extremely high doses. It wasn’t quite the same as if John had been there with him, but it was good to talk it through and things felt a little more normal again.
"Of course, I did," Sherlock said. "I'm glad you did -- I know you could have been doing stuff with other people. . .I'm glad you came with me."
"Did you forget about the shouting?" John asked teasingly. "I've been sleeping . . . well, not great. I just keep thinking about everything going on, if I'm honest. What about you?"
Sherlock moved a little away. “I know your life has been interrupted and you’ve suffered, but my life was interrupted as well . . . I don’t know how to be here now . . . who I am, I guess.” He wiped his hands over his face and stood up abruptly. “Tea?” he asked, trying to change the subject as he moved into the kitchen.
Sherlock moved to the window and watched him walk away. He’d quite enjoyed that. He took the mugs to the sink and moved to his desk to start working. He wrote up notes for the rest of the afternoon and had just finished when Lestrade called -- not to solve a case but for Sherlock’s input on the logic of a case they’d already solved. Still it was something so they arranged to meet the following day. Sherlock went out for a walk, feeling good about the day.
John pulled off of Sherlock's cock and pushed in another finger. Then he shifted to sit up, reaching for the box of condoms in the drawer. Sherlock’s hand immediately went to his own wet cock, stroking it as he watched John roll on the condom. John poured a bit more lube and lined up. He looked up at him again and pushed in slowly, groaning softly.
Sherlock pushed past the guy at the door and rushed over to John. He untied him and lifted him into a hug. “Thank God, you’re all right,” he said.
“You did not,” John said and pressed a proper kiss on his shoulder before continuing down and swirling his tongue around Sherlock's nipple.
“I hadn’t thought about it,” Sherlock said honestly. “I hadn’t expected what happened upstairs to happen.” He looked over. “Is that what you want to do?”
John put the shovel against the house as he followed Sherlock inside. Everything was exactly the same as he remembered it. "When did you start smoking?" he asked softly.
He went back to his bedroom. “Get the stuff,” he said to John. “We’ll need to go out to the shed for bit, but then we can get to work.”
“I have some news about John,” Sherlock said. “Did you know he’s got some kind of date with this woman tonight?”
“Are we though?” Sherlock said from the kitchen. “You didn’t seem all that interested in my discoveries . . .”
“Sit down,” she said and Sherlock did. “I know being away from home is hard. Have you made any friends in the last year?”
“I have noticed quite a bit, but I was prepared to accept them on a part time basis,” Sherlock said. “However, if we are going to have to be in each other’s presence 24-7 . . . “
Sherlock disappeared into his room. He stripped himself of his clothes and lay down on the bed, but didn’t get out a book. He closed his eyes and tried not to think about the case or about drugs or about John’s special assignment.
“You’ve always liked me,” Sherlock said. “I guess I’m asking, do you mean your feelings are like you had for that boyfriend?”
As Sherlock dragged himself from his sleep down the stairs, Sherlock’s mum smiled and said, “It’s nice to see that you’re alive.”
John lifted and moved down again, going a little further each time. Sherlock tasted good and the sounds he was making -- they were driving John crazy. He lifted his eyes to look at Sherlock's face as he moved.
Sherlock sipped his tea as he stared at the screen. As the film was coming to an end, he looked over at John whose eyes were closed. It was clear he was asleep. For some reason, Sherlock smiled -- there was something quite nice about the sight of a totally relaxed John Watson. He finished his tea off, and then said softly, “John? It’s time to go to bed, I think” as he reached over and touched his arm.
“Are you going to want some dinner at some point?” Sherlock asked. “Despite going to bed early, we both slept quite late.”
Sherlock got up and put his pajamas back on. “Why don’t I see if I can find a takeaway to order? I think they are some who deliver,” he said. “Just to save you the trouble of cooking.”
"I've been thinking and I feel . . . I mean . . ." John took a deep breath and swore softly. "I love you." For a second he didn't hear anything then he hung up the phone in a panic.
Eventually Sherlock’s head lifted quickly. “I fell asleep,” he said, wiping his eyes and sitting up sharply. “Sorry about that.”
John was starting to regret grabbing this guy out of the crowd. "Look, I don't have a ton of cash on me and I don't think I should pay you for just . . . standing next to me," he said.
“Maybe you need them?” she said. “It’s not the money . . . you know he left me some. It’s just . . . better than sitting in here all the time . . . remembering.”
“About me?” Sherlock asked. He stood up to make some tea, trying to think for a second. “I see, yes, well, that makes more sense. About why you were acting odd, I mean. Well, I hope it wasn’t too upsetting for you.” He brought two mugs over and sat down again. “Did my sexiness scare you?” he added with a cheeky grin.
John smiled at Sherlock as he followed them out of the hospital room. He doubted Mycroft was going to tell him exactly where Sherlock was going, but he was sure Sherlock would call to let him know.
He resisted downplaying it. Compared to what Sherlock had done these cases were child's play, but he didn't want to keep putting himself down every time. It was bound to get old. So he’d accepted the compliment and left it at that.
“You are what I’ve been looking for,” Sherlock said. He put his hands on John’s arms and pulled him close, kissing him roughly on the mouth.
"Hold on, sorry," John said, moving in front of Sherlock. He smiled at the woman and looked at her a bit sheepishly. "Don't mind him. That was just a test -- we're just looking into the security system, but before we get to the technical stuff we wanted to see how you would handle suspicious behavior." He smiled again, leaning a bit closer.
Sherlock scooped the cigarette butts into his hand and took them into the bin. He carried his bag into the bedroom and then went into the bathroom to wash his face. In truth, he wasn’t even sure what book John was bringing, but he’d be glad to see him. Hopefully, it would feel a little more normal.
Sherlock shifted slightly before lifting his hand and slicking it with his tongue. He went back to stroking John with a firmer, faster hand. “I want to make you come,’ he said, his breath starting to change.
“You don’t need to tell me anything,” Sherlock said. “I don’t get on with my brother because he is smug, demanding, and all around annoying.”
"Because it's new . . . with you, I mean, it's something we've never done and there's been a lot of new just recently . . ." Sherlock said, grateful he was behind John.
Sherlock laughed, before taking a sip of whiskey. Then his face changed. “I don’t get it,” he admitted, handing John his glass.
“You are definitely different,” Sherlock said. “I’m not usually like this but . . .” He pressed his lips against John’s neck.
"Yes, but it'll be hard to enjoy that stuff living on the street," John grinned. "I have to go. See you later."
“Oh my god,” Sherlock laughed. “Are you still going on about that? Mrs Hudson’s nonsense has gone to your head. Do you really believe you are magic?” He reached over and lightly pinched John’s side.
“Your shed?” his mum asked. “That’s my shed that I was letting you use. But your things are still in there -- I haven’t touched any of that mess since you were in there last summer.”
“Shall we have one more dance?” Sherlock asked as they entered the lift. “Perhaps I can convince Mrs Hudson we’ve been out there the whole time, and she only imagined our absence due to her white wine intake.”
John skipped the cafe and went straight to the bookshop. He got there before her, hoping that would seem more natural. He was sitting in the corner armchair when she walked in and spotted him.
“Is that an adult?” Sherlock asked, squinting his eyes. “Oh my god, is that what fashion was before the virus? Did people really go out looking so ridiculous?” He laughed a little as he took a long drink of tea. “Looking at the guy’s face – do you think he ran away or got himself in some kind of trouble or what?”
Molly started tidying up. “I’ll keep this stuff locked up in case it’s needed for the case or whatever,” she said. “It was amazing how you figured that all out.”
“Once upon a time, there was a little boy. His name was John because I have the decency to name the children in my stories unlike some other people I know,” Sherlock started. “John was a good boy and always did everything right and everyone loved him all the time because he was so great. However, even though John knew all these people, he was sometimes a little lonely. But he kept that mostly to himself.”
“Fuck,” Sherlock called dropping his head down to sloppily kiss John’s mouth. When they’d caught their breath, he slowly lifted himself up and then pulled John over to the bed, snuggling against him. “Aren’t you glad I showed you that?” he asked.
After dinner, she asked them to do the washing up and for some reason Sherlock agreed. “I wash, you dry,” he said to John, throwing him a tea towel.
Sherlock looked away as he turned, releasing his arm from Jim’s grasp. He walked back to his room and threw his bag against his chair. He grabbed the notebook and flopped onto the bed. His heart was beating irregularly, and he took some deep breaths to settle himself. Then he sat up and grabbed a pen to add the episode to his letter to John.
Sherlock followed John out of the bar, pulling him close as soon as they got out on the street. When a taxi stopped, Sherlock slipped in next to John. “Just so we’re both clear,” he said. “Is staying the night an option?”
The young man looked up from his phone and said, “Sure.” He typed a few things and a printer began making noise. “Footage as well?” he asked.
Sherlock finished his cigarette and followed John inside. He grabbed some shorts and went into the bathroom to get ready. He came back out and said, “We’ve only got one big towel. I’ll be honest, my mum had suggested swimming as an option, but I didn’t think we’d do it.”
“A few other times as well, but particularly today,” he answered. “How long do you prepare to keep it up?”
John found a good spot near the front, a bit secluded from the rest of the people filling the bar. He never knew how full the shows would be so he liked grabbing his spot early. He liked watching people, liked watching how they reacted to the shows. While his friend promoted the band's image to try and get them gigs, John offered information on how the crowds reacted to them. Door sales helped with that, of course, but a lot of people might come just to drink. John listened to gossip and rants, watched people dance and sing, and helped steer his friend to places that bands would be the best received. He looked around and decided to get himself another drink. He walked up to the bar and waited for the bartender, glancing at a tall, ginger man who was not shy about staring back at him. John ignored him.
John grinned. "Yes well, that won't be happening for a while so you better get used to my constant company. Relax. We'll be fine."
Sherlock didn’t move from the chair. He’d been looking so forward to coming back to his home, his room, but he was a bit paralyzed by how big it was now. And how empty it felt being here on his own. While he was gone, he was alone but it was in strange places -- now it was in a place where he’d grown used to someone else being there. John being there. Sherlock inhaled and exhaled and reminded himself John would be back any minute.
Sherlock looked over at John and then stood up from the table and went around to his side. He kneeled down a little, pulling him into a hug. "It'll be all right," he said. "Whatever version of her comes through that door . . . we'll deal with it."
"I need to focus so I can't." John went to move around him, but the guy blocked his path a bit. John tilted his head and sighed. "I'm taken anyway. I need to go."
When John returned, he unpacked his bag and put everything away. His flat was small but if everything went okay with this new job maybe he could move into something a little better. Everything would be easier then -- he could be closer to work and to things that were much more interesting than this boring bedsit. It was so boring around here. He got up again and went to the computer. He sat and stared at the screen for a while. He felt stupid, but he was just curious. That was all. In the search bar he typed Sherlock and then watched the cursor blinking. Oh. He'd never gotten Sherlock's last name. He hit the return button anyways and waited -- how common could that name be?
Sherlock stood up a bit too quickly, definitely ready to go. He gave Angelo a wave and they headed out.
Sherlock smiled back. He didn’t feel like that was possible, but he did trust John. “I’ll try.” He pulled his legs up onto the sofa, grabbing the blanket and covering his legs and turned his attention back to the documentary. When it finished, he asked, “Did you enjoy that?”
"I first heard it at a show for another band. They were opening, but they were good so I looked up their music and have enjoyed it ever since. Is this the first time you're hearing it?"
Sherlock nodded without turning around. “I think I’ve isolated the ingredients,” he said more to the kettle than to John.
Sherlock looked over. "I'm not either, John. I do understand it now," he said. "It's partly why I decided to abandon the outside world entirely. I have everything I need and want here."
John stayed for a while more, reading and watching, then stood to leave. He asked the girl at the desk to pass along his good bye before he left. He walked for some of the way, getting several blocks away before hailing a back to take him back to the flat.
John moaned softly, his hands moving over Sherlock's chest and torso. He grazed Sherlock's nipples, focusing there.
Sherlock’s brain shifted quickly. “Yes, actually,” he said. “I’m a collector -- it’s actually possible the painting was a forgery.”
"I know but . . ." John sighed. "I know. We'll make it work, though. We're best friends, we have to."
However, it still seemed odd that John was not around, and this was a slightly confusing feeling. Obviously, Sherlock was aware that change was not always easy, but somehow it seemed bigger than that. He remembered the text argument and that ruined his mood a little. He excused himself and went up to bed.
“John is fine,” Sherlock said. “Everything is fine up here. We’re fine.” He glanced over at John. They’d been fine since that fight, right? He looked back down at her. “Are you all right?” he asked. “Can we do anything for you?”
Sherlock stared at the television. “Hmm,” he said. “I thought you were the funny one . . .” He whipped the pillow back over at John.
“All right -- let me know if you change your mind,” Sherlock said. He took a sip of tea. “Do you work tomorrow?”
“I’m sure you will be,” Mrs Hudson said, handing the guy some money. “You have been since you’ve moved in.”
“I did,” Sherlock said. “But I was always the more imaginative one. You’re more by the book – don’t forget to do the washing up, don’t stay up too late, don’t sleep with your flatmate . . .” He picked up his pillow and hit John with it.
"Condoms are not interesting, John," Sherlock said. "Leave them in there, hang up the coat and walk away from this conversation."
"No?" John asked, looking back over at him. "So . . . it’s not serious? Or it’s just not wedding-bells serious?"
By the time Sherlock got back to the flat, the nicotine had made him pleasantly dizzy. He poured himself a cup of tea, but instead of getting straight to work, he sat down on his chair and just enjoyed the feeling.
"That's not it, John," Sherlock said, putting some space between them again. In fact, he sat up properly and leaned against the headboard. "If I'm honest, I don't even want to wait until this stupid film ends. . . "
Sherlock stared at the message. John really didn’t know. So why was he so quick to get back to normal if his business partner -- his friend -- was dead? Sherlock had assured there was money for the flat so it couldn’t be that. He didn’t know what to think. So he wrote.
“Did you bring them . . . for this?” Sherlock asked. “It doesn’t matter . . . don’t tell me.” He reached into the drawer and grabbed the bottle and handed it to John. He kissed John on the mouth. “Hurry . . .”
After a couple hours of trying to keep himself occupied and trying to get comfortable in bed to watch movies John gave up, more bored than ever. He needed something to do, something more than just lying around because there had been too much of that already. He closed his computer and went down to the sitting room, looking around the whole room. It was a mess, really. That's what he could do. He started organising everything and cleaning up, making his way around the mess.
“It is,” Sherlock said. “See? Don’t do yourself down, you got there in the end.” He patted John’s head.
Sherlock had been listening, of course, but he'd kept his eyes focused on his computer. "Yes, I will go," he said without turning his head.
“Stop,” Sherlock commanded, swiftly slipping the vibrator from John’s body and throwing it on the floor. He tossed the bottle of lube to John and said, “Get ready,” as he stripped himself of his clothes. He closed John’s legs and climbed up on the chair, his knees on either side of John. “I’ve been ready forever,” he said, starting to stroke himself.
"Oh, I guess I assumed there would be something here, I don't know why. Okay, I'll let you do it," John smiled and went into the bathroom instead.
"I don't know what you want me to think about. I liked it. I told him I did," he said. He could tell he sounded a bit defensive about it, and he didn't know why. What was she trying to make him say?
Sherlock caught his breath and opened his eyes. He looked over at John and smiled. Then he shifted a little. “We’re a mess,” he said as he got up, moving to the kitchen. He rinsed his hand and wiped off his belly and then ran a towel under the tap for a second. He came back and tossed it to John. “The curtains are still open,” he said. “I hope no one was looking in.”
"When I said 'not always friendly' I meant mostly unfriendly -- remember that first night? I'm not very good at talking to people," Sherlock said. "What if you want me to talk to someone?"
"Really?" Sherlock said, already slipping off the shirt and beginning to unbutton the jeans. "You too?"
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s body, squeezing his arse as the kiss became deeper. He could feel himself stiffening and pressed his hips into John’s. “You need a condom,” he whispered as his hands slipped to John’s front and he began unbuttoning his trousers.
Sherlock stubbed out his cigarette against the brick and dropped it in the bin. He went in and found Mrs Hudson. He noticed a coat on a chair. “Did you invite someone to sit with us?” he asked. “That’s rude, I don’t want anyone else around me.”
Sherlock got up and made another cup of tea and then went to the bathroom. He decided to get into the bed despite it being ridiculously early. This time he crawled into the bed that Mycroft used to sleep in.
Sherlock realised he’d never actually got around to checking his email at all. “Yes, definitely,” he said. “Quite busy.” He had no idea why he was lying to John right now.
"Oh, shut up, you idiot! It was a dream about you,” John said. He pushed back and got up from the table. "Now it's out, and we're moving on."
When John got back to the flat, he spread out his notes on the table and looked at everything together. He couldn't see it -- Sherlock would have picked out the culprit right away, some small sign that they had more money than they were showing, that they were guilty. He rubbed his temples and kept looking over the notes until it was late. He put it all away before bed, not wanting to risk Mrs Hudson seeing if she came up in the morning.
"Are you going to be touching me at some point or will I be doing all the work here?" Sherlock said, laughing a little before dropping down to smother John's mouth with kisses.
“What are we supposed to do for food during all this?” Sherlock asked. “I’m not worried about myself, but you . . . this isn’t going to turn into a Donner Party type thing, is it?”
“I think so,” Sherlock said. “Should we say something -- that seems like the kind of thing you would want. Like when your gerbil died.”
John put his drink down on the table beside the sofa without looking so he could bring both hands to Sherlock's cheeks as they kissed.
Sherlock felt bad that he hadn’t called them sooner. Of course, they could’ve called him . . . he shook his head. No, that was stupid. He wasn’t a child anymore and they were the vulnerable ones now – he should’ve been paying better attention. That made him feel bad, so he went back to blaming Mycroft for deliberately distracting him.
“Possibly,” Sherlock said. “He may not have been the first one -- just the first one in Britain. I know some people who are familiar with . . . things elsewhere.” He ate a few bites of his food. “Looks like I’m winning,” he said with a grin.
Mrs Hudson called John’s name, but he was gone. She slowly climbed the stairs and knocked before opening the door. Seeing him shocked her, of course, even though she’d spoken to Mycroft. She said his name and rushed over to give him a hug, squeezing him tight.
“I’m a consulting detective,” Sherlock said. “I solve puzzles. Have any that need solving? My rates are reasonable . . . for friends.”
"I am as well," Sherlock said. "Thanks for listening, though." He stood up to get his wallet. "I've got no notes -- do you have some?"
“Will all the plumbing work then, or did you fix it just to help the sweet old lady?” Sherlock asked, looking the man over closely.
John shrugged. "I don't know. All I know is we started chasing a suspected murderer and the adrenaline -- I was running like I hadn't been able to in a long time. The cases gave me purpose again, something exciting like the surgeries used to."
"I didn't mean sleep," Sherlock said. When he saw the expression on John's face, he said, "I didn't meant that either. I just meant we could rest, just rest without worrying."
"I liked it," John said. "I wouldn’t mind trying everything. But we're not in any rush. We’ve got time, like we said earlier," he smiled.
“Looks good,” Sherlock said. He filled the tea pot and picked up the tray, following his parents back into the sitting room. He set it down and nipped upstairs to grab his parents’ gifts. When he came back, there was a cup of tea and a small plate waiting on the table next to a chair. There were two gifts on the seat. He shifted them and sat down. He spread some cheese onto a cracker before popping it into his mouth. It was delicious actually, so he said that aloud. His mother smiled and stayed smiling as they opened their gifts.
Sherlock got back to the flat and turned on the kettle. However, before it boiled, he turned it off instead and poured himself a small glass of wine. He felt irritated for some reason, probably because he’d failed Lestrade. A little wine might not resolve the irritation, but it couldn’t hurt.
“All I’ve done since you arrived is enjoy your presence -- excuse me for expressing a feeling,” Sherlock said, bringing over the tea. “Let’s go outside so I can have a cigarette.”
John bucked into his hand, tilting to find his mouth and kiss him again. His own hand wrapped around Sherlock and matched his speed.
“Never had the pleasure,” the driver said. “But you needn’t worry about him. Sherlock’s taken care of that.”
John smiled back. "I'm having a great time," he announced. It seemed the special dances were over. The dance floor was opened to everyone, and Molly started making her way around to meet with guests.
Heat flooded through Sherlock’s whole body. It was like he’d been hit with an electric shock, John’s touch was almost too much. He followed John’s rhythm as he stroked him, trying to move even closer.
Sherlock jumped up. He realised he was a little tipsy from the wine, so he steadied himself and wandered around the flat for a few minutes before disappearing into his bedroom.
"Mhmm. I'll try,” he said. “I’ll bring back my leftovers -- I've ordered your favourite." The boyfriend was waving his gun impatiently. "I have to go now."
When he finished his cigarette, he made a cup of tea. He brought it in and sat down across from John. “So what are we going to do tonight?” he asked.
His mum laughed. “You are such a pain, Sherlock Holmes,” she said, pushing her legs underneath the duvet against his. “Get up and go. If you go out to the shed, be quiet, don’t lock yourself out, and clean up any messes you make.”
“Well, don’t run off with someone without letting me know -- I don’t want to be waiting around all night to head home if you’ll be spending the night in some man’s flat,” Sherlock said.
“It’s Sherlock Holmes, but your billing name might be Hudson. It’s 221 Baker Street. Can you send him straight away?”
Sherlock squirmed a little at John’s touch. Then he moved even closer to him so their chests pressed together. “Is my skin hot?” he asked.
He shifted in bed and turned to look at the empty side of the bed. Sherlock had been gone so long -- they shouldn't be apart anymore. He stood up and moved quietly down the stairs. He stopped in front of Sherlock's room and knocked softly.
John was half present in the only two classes he had. When he was done, he stopped by the cafe for a snack and headed back to the flat, his mind back on Sherlock and their conversation. His stomach was twisting with nerves. He let himself in and looked around for Sherlock, realising he must still be sleeping. He got out his things to organise for tomorrow.
"I'm sorry. I’m just chatting with Sherlock," he said. He looked back down at his phone, still smiling.
John nodded. Sherlock leaned down and pressed his face against John’s thighs, watching everything that was happening. His face was damp with sweat, and his own hips were rocking with John’s movement.
Sherlock heard John moving in the other room, so he turned and stretched himself on the bed. Then he remembered they had a guest, so he decided not to get up just yet. Soon it went quiet, and he wondered if Harry had gone out along with John. This hope was dashed when he heard the shower running, so he took that opportunity to get up and dressed, rushing out to the kitchen to make some tea. Perhaps if she wasn't going to go out, she'd at least stay upstairs until John returned.
"Thank God," Harry grinned. "He moves around so much," she told Sherlock.  John only rolled his eyes.
“I didn’t like it either,” Sherlock said. “But it happened. Would you rather just leave things as they are? We can do that if you want.”
“All right,” Sherlock said. “I still trust you . . . though you were trying to steal my secret formula,” he added, trying to lighten things.
Sherlock was lying on the floor in a small cupboard. It was uncomfortable but would only be for a few more hours until someone was sent to pick him up. His back hurt.
In the morning John was down in the kitchen early, having a small breakfast and watching his phone. He didn't know what time Sherlock would be coming over. All of his things were piled by the door.
The man and the woman dropped what was in their hands, but they had no where to go. The police grabbed and cuffed them immediately.
“I’m waiting,” Sherlock said. “I don’t have many clients on my own, well I’ve had a few but the cases have been . . . ludicrous.  I have helped the police a few times, but I need them to call me for something . . . big.”
Sherlock finished his tea. “You’ve not snapped at me yet,” he said. “That’s your thing, right?” he added with a smile.
“That’s fine,” Sherlock said. He opened the fridge and looked for some leftovers. “There’s a bit of Chinese in here -- should I warm it up for you?”
They sat and talked for a little while. His mother said they’d be happy to give them a ride to the cabin and made some suggestions about things to take.
Sherlock set his phone on the nightstand and rolled over in bed, pulling the covers up to almost cover his face. He did miss John. Much more than he'd expected to.
Sherlock turned his head slightly and put his mouth against John's ear, nuzzling it softly. John moaned softly before he could stop it, biting his lip.
John looked over his shoulder and saluted Sherlock as he disappeared into his room. He turned the television on to keep him company.
"Are you trying to trick the information out of me? You don’t need to -- I remember it," he said. He took a long drink and finished the wine.
“It’s fine,” Sherlock said. “They’re easier to reach here.” He lay the plates and silverware on the table. “Drink?”
John had made it all the way downstairs before remembering he’d forgotten his jacket. He had hoped it was on the hooks by the main door, but it wasn’t. He sighed and looked up, then he noticed Sherlock's coat. It would only be a few minutes -- he was just going up the street to get the newspapers. He glanced up again and grabbed Sherlock's coat.
“No, not really, that’s not it,” Sherlock said. “I don’t want to stop it’s just . . . “ He turned himself away from John.
“No, we didn’t have plans,” Sherlock said. “I’m just . . . I just feel off.” He moved back to the table. “Sorry . . .”
"No, not really. I've watched you sleep before. You sleep the same now as you did then," Sherlock said. "The things before we slept, though, I found quite interesting."
In the morning, Sherlock rolled over and saw John beside him. He lifted his hand to his head -- it hurt again. When he shifted his body, his body hurt again. “John,” he said. “Are you awake?”
Sherlock kept his arm around John as he closed his eyes. Sleep came quickly, but it was a different kind of sleep, the deepest kind. It was the first good sleep he'd had since they'd been locked down together. When he opened his eyes again, John was there next to him. He knew something big had changed between them, but he also knew it was a good change. He lay there for a few minutes, just watching John dream.
Sherlock kicked off his shoes and lifted his feet to the end of the table. “This sofa’s not that comfortable,” he said. “I wish we were on my bed.”
John smiled softly. "You'll be okay," he said. "You can do this - I know you can." He heard the door of the bathroom open, so he changed the subject. "Maybe you should get your stuff together."
Sherlock wasn’t really sure what Mrs Hudson meant about John’s presence changing him. But he too was ready for John to come back to the flat to care that much.
John smiled and climbed over Sherlock to straddle his hips. He started with his hands, moving them over Sherlock's shoulders and chest before leaning down to kiss him.
John grinned. "Oh, I am most definitely satisfied," he said. He stretched and curled around Sherlock.
"I'll check my email while we wait," Sherlock said, getting up to move to his desk. He answered a few queries, but nothing looked too promising. Eventually, he closed his computer and said, "Let's lie down.'
"Sherlock, I just told you they round in the morning," he said. "I mean, they can get a resident in here if you really want to talk to someone, but it’s just going to be some kid who looks at your chart just before he walks in. Do you want the resident?"
“You know I need evidence to believe anything,” Sherlock said. He stretched his arms. “We should tidy up. Is it all right if we don’t watch a film tonight?”
Sherlock looked over at John’s face. It seemed genuine and that made him feel nice. “How is the job hunt going?” he asked, changing the subject.
"It's you," Sherlock said. "It's probably wrong, you're probably angry, but I was supposed to tell the truth -- so I'm telling the whole truth now."
"You help me, John, all the time," Sherlock said. "I probably don't say thank you enough, but I hope you know how grateful I am for you."
John carded his fingers through Sherlock's hair. "Don't know why we tried to fight this," he murmured.
Sherlock used his hands to tip John's head and deepen the kiss before he dropped them to grab at John's wrist, pressing them against the wall. John moaned louder, shifting his hands to lace his fingers with Sherlock's and hold them both.
“Don’t forget your stuff,” Sherlock said, grabbing the stuff from the edge of the bed. “And your shovel outside. Look,” he said, quietly. “I’m glad you came by.”
Even though they'd never been camping together before, there was something about the scene that seemed familiar to Sherlock. He mentioned a memory to John and then they spent the rest of dinner talking about old times. It was nice for Sherlock now, to be able to talk about the past without feeling so much sadness. After they'd finished, he went in to get the marshmallows. They found a few sticks and toasted a few.
“Fine, let me show you how an adult does it,” Sherlock said. He dialed a random number and set the phone back on the sofa.
John kept stroking him as he gazed up at him. Sherlock poured some lube into one hand and shifted down the bed, away from John’s reach. He used his slick hand to stroke between John’s legs and then leaned over, teasing John’s cock with his tongue. He slipped the head of it between his lips and he pressed a finger slowly inside.
John thought about that. He used to enjoy it, but it had been a long time. "Sometimes," he answered. "I used to go out a lot more than I have lately."
“Just lie like I did, come on, John, I’m trying to be nice,” Sherlock said. “Why do you always make things so complicated?”
Sherlock led John out on the street, and they began to walk. He pulled a cigarette out and offered one to John but was not surprised when he didn’t take it. He lit the cigarette and inhaled deeply before exhaling into the sky. “Would you say you are open-minded, John?” he asked.
"Oh yes. That's why I have such a refined taste," John smiled. He came over with the wine and two glasses.
Sherlock kissed him roughly again, this time lifting John's hands over his head, still grasping his wrists. He rolled his hips against John, who whimpered into the kiss, returning it eagerly and moving his hips against Sherlock's.
"That was much more comfortable, but this is all part of the experience." John smiled and started the movie. "It’s an action film."
“Both, I suppose,” Sherlock said. “What’s the point? I want Molly to be happy, but realistically most relationships don’t last.”
Sherlock exhaled loudly. John’s hand was warm and firm on him -- he’d expected it to feel the same as when he’d touched himself but it didn’t, it felt better. He lifted his head and sloppily kissed John’s mouth and then dropped his head. He followed John’s lead and slipped his hand inside John’s boxers, holding his cock and then mimicking the same slow stroke. John moaned his approval, kissing Sherlock breathlessly as their hands moved together.
"Should we unpack a little?" Sherlock asked, getting up. "Maybe we should get ready for bed. Do you want to sleep on the floor in the sleeping bags or you could take the sofa and I'll see if I can find a cot or something?"
“Um, possibly,” she said. “But you might be misremembering. It’s not a cottage, more of a cabin -- it’s quite . . . rustic, are you sure you want to stay there? Wouldn’t you rather go to a B and B or something?”
He hit Send and set the phone on the table next to him. He grabbed his mug and headed into the kitchen.
"I just don't like when people assume things, that's all. It's not because it's . . . bad or anything. But you said you're married to your work and I would think it’d bothered you too that anyone would assume you'd be . . . distracted in that way." He avoided meeting Sherlock's gaze. The truth is that he had no idea what Sherlock was into when it came to anything like this.
Sherlock smiled. He got the drinks, handing one water to John. They moved along the side of the room back to their table. “What’d we miss?” he asked, sitting down next to Mrs Hudson.
John took the men and looked through each one, biting his lip as he craned to see what else was in there.
John laughed and Sherlock relaxed a little. “Do you really think you could attract clients with your blog?” he asked.
John looked over and let his head fall too, resting on Sherlock's. "Well, fine. We're stupid now. We won't tell anyone, it's okay."
Sherlock's hand was getting tired, so he pushed himself up a bit and turned so he was positioned next to John's hips. This allowed him to use both hands. "Are your muscles sore?" he asked softly.
John woke up the next morning and tugged the covers around him, tucking them around his shoulder. The room felt cold. Then he opened his eyes when he realised what was missing. He turned and looked at the empty side of the bed. Sherlock was gone again. John sighed and stretched before getting up. He wrapped his dressing around himself and slowly made his way downstairs.
“A game? Interesting,” Sherlock said. He got up and moved to the desk to get some sticky notes. He scribbled his name on one and then stuck it to his forehead. “Like this? But what am I supposed to be guessing?”
Sherlock stood still for a moment. He wondered if Mrs Hudson would be even assuming feelings mattered if he and John hadn’t shared what they shared at Molly’s wedding. He didn’t know what to make of that, but at the moment, he wanted to finish his work.
"We'll find out when she arrives, I suppose," Sherlock said. "Unless you want me to call and see if Mycroft can get some information. . ."
“Not at all,” Sherlock said. In fact, he was really glad John had joined him, but for some reason, he felt unable to share that. He passed John the remote. “Choose whatever you want.”
John came in and closed the door. "You did good, not letting him in," he said. "I know you must be desperate for a case."
Sherlock stopped. There was something both comforting and confusing about John’s touch. “Right. Thanks,” he said softly, smiling in the darkness. He left, shutting John’s door behind. He made himself a cup of tea and moved to his desk. If he could sort the case, maybe he could stop thinking about John so much.
Sherlock took a bit of John's order and scooped it onto his plate. "I'm not very hungry," he said. "All full up from the delicious salad."
"I don't want to watch you go see bands all the time," Sherlock said. "But I don't want you to flirt with tall, ginger men if I'm not there."
Sherlock got them two bottles of water and sat down at the table. “Did you bring your things?” he asked John quietly.
John looked around the room again. It really was very messy. "It’s . . . an interesting space," he said, looking over at Sherlock again. "Um, what do you do exactly? I found your website but I didn't really understand."
Sherlock humphed on the sofa. He waited for a few minutes, hoping John would come back, but he didn’t. He dragged himself up and went into the bathroom and turned on the bath.  He stripped off and then got in to the hot water. He rubbed his hands over his face and then sunk underneath. The noise from the pouring water filled his head. Eventually he pushed himself up.
"She..." Mrs. Hudson trailed off and fought off a smile as she glanced up the stairs. "Yes, she's right. Come on in," she said, moving to let him in.
“I don’t like. . .” Sherlock started, but instead of continuing he shoved a fork full of noodles into his mouth. What he wanted to say was that he didn’t like not knowing. Not knowing what would happen, not knowing what to expect. He tried everything he could to keep control, at least of the things he could control. He didn’t like not being able to control his life. He swallowed more food.
John brushed his teeth and washed his face before coming out again. He stripped down to his briefs and climbed into his bag. "Are you staying up a bit?" he asked.
Sherlock pushed his leg back and kicked John’s arm. “Quit talking about it,” he said. He shifted in the bed to get more comfortable. After a few minutes, he said, “The school doesn’t have the same half terms. If I stay, I won’t be back until December.”
"They don't have evidence on me, that's why they used him. He didn't even wear a wire," he smirked. "We get rid of him, no loose ends."
“I’ve been texting him every hour, making a case for why I needed to go home. He’s been too busy being annoyed by me to worry about you,” Sherlock said. “I think what’s been proven is that, even when injured, I’m smarter than him.”
“Doctor Watson will be more complicated, Sherlock,” Mycroft said. “But I think you must know that by now.”
“All right then,” Sherlock said. He shifted and lay back on the bed next to John. “My turn,” he said cheekily.
Now John understood -- Molly and Mrs Hudson were friends. Still, would she really offer a discount to a friend of a friend?
She smirked and got up to help him. John tried to wiggle free from the ties. They had used zip ties for his hands and rope for his feet so there were slim chances of getting free.
John set aside the pastry and slowly opened the box. It was a scrapbook. Slightly confused, he started flipping through it slowly, looking at clippings from newspapers. Specifically cases they've worked together, pictures of them together. "Sherlock," He said softly.
Sherlock looked over at John. "Harry's not in a programme -- she was certain she could do it on her own." He glanced quickly at her before looking back at John. "Which has not happened obviously. She can tell you more about it in the morning." He turned his body now toward Harry. "Go to bed now," he said.
“You follow your own finger,” Sherlock said, grabbing his hand and squeezing it before pushing him away. “You and my brother said I was fine, that all I needed was rest. Were you lying to me?”
Monday morning John went over his schedule again and penciled in a quick note about stopping at Baker Street, making sure he had the invoice. He gathered up his things and headed out to start the day, his most complicated job at the beginning.
“Whatever you need,” Mrs Hudson said. She finished her tea and then stood up. “Do you want me to help you tidy up?”
John left his phone there to get his next patient. He didn't think Sherlock was going to be able to leave, but there was no use fighting.
Sherlock rolled his eyes before taking a small bite. “Well, at least I’ve found the painting,” he said.
“This mug that you brought me from Italy -- it was from the worst summer of my life because you were gone for so long,” Sherlock said, setting it on the bed. “And this,” Sherlock said, quickly waving an envelope.
“All right then,” Sherlock said. “I’m going to try it –- but if I do something wrong or you don’t like it, you should tell me, okay?” He moved further down John’s body and then leaned over. He kissed John’s stomach and could feel John’s cock pressed against his neck. He thought for a moment about what he was going to do, and then shifted position so he could lightly kiss John’s cock. He licked it up and down and around the head, tasting the wetness that was leaking out. Then he held it in his hand and sucked it into his mouth.
John nodded before continuing on. He pushed open Sherlock's door and peered inside. He didn't know what he expected, but his room looked very ordinary. He crossed quickly and opened the drawer, grabbing the wrapped box before coming out again. As he walked back to the sitting room, he tried to figure out what it might be -- he wondered if it might be a jumper, but it was also kind of heavy. He sat in his chair and started to open it, Mrs Hudson standing nearby to watch.
“I regret so many things, John,” Sherlock said and suddenly he burst into tears, burying his face in his hands.  “Of course, I loved you -- of course, I love you still,” Sherlock said. “I have missed you so much . . .”
Sherlock was both confused and annoyed. “Well, I’m going to find the thief,” he finally said and ended the call.
"What? No!" Sherlock said. "I meant, it was a two day 'relationship' -- obviously I didn't have sex two days ago. It's been more like two years, you idiot . . ." he added before realising he'd shared an answer to a question that hadn't been asked.
“Well, something went wrong once obviously and then -- as we know -- they appeared to go off again until you stopped by to sort them. Which reminds me . . .” Sherlock said, as he got up to grab the clipboard. He scribbled his name on the paper and handed it to John. “There you go. Everything’s in order. All is well.”
From there he got a cab to the surgery. He couldn't have missed Molly's wedding, but he also had an interview this morning and he couldn't miss that either. He walked into the office and sat in the lobby, his bag beside him while he waited to be called. It wasn't long. The woman came out and led him into her office where they went over his resume and his experience. He was a bit over qualified, but he needed the job. He was charming, and she seemed to enjoy talking with him. When the interview was over he had a good feeling about it. He shook her hand and she made it linger a bit longer before letting him go. He hailed another cab outside of the clinic and finally headed back to his flat.
Suddenly, Sherlock’s arm was being pulled -- it was the handsome man who was calling him a pet name. “Sorry?” he asked.
“All right, we’re leaving,” Sherlock’s dad said. “Call us when you’re ready to be picked up but don’t call us if there’s a problem -- solve the problem. You’re both smart young men -- don’t hassle us, all right?” He gave them a smile and grabbed Sherlock’s mum’s hand.
After a few minutes John brought Sherlock his mug of tea and then sat at the table to eat his breakfast. He started thinking of ideas for later, trying to figure out what they could do to pass the time.
"I know the fucking part isn't true," Sherlock said, wondering what was going on in John's head. "But the other . . .  she said you preferred me, she asked me if I were going to break up with you . . . she's only been here two days and she's saying things . . . people who know us say those things . . . are they all right?"
Sherlock stood up. “Stop talking about it anyway -- I don’t know why you have to keep bringing it up,” he said. “Hurry up and finish.” He grabbed his plate to take into the kitchen.
“Well, it’s big, isn’t it? You’ve been wanting to lose your virginity forever and now it’s about to happen and . . . I’m not sure now what it’ll mean,” Sherlock rambled. “I thought we could do it and still be the same but I don’t know if that’s true . . . because for me, it’ll always be you and for you, I’ll always be the first one and maybe you’ll regret that and you won’t want to be my friend anymore and I couldn’t live with that . . .”
Sherlock took the rest of his into the kitchen as well. "I might try working after all," he said, realising his mood was much better.
“Well, it’s just salad but I got you some biscuits and ice cream for dessert,” Sherlock said. He pulled some things out of the fridge and began mixing vegetables into a big bowl. “It’s all healthy, so don’t start nagging.”
Sherlock heard a noise and looked down. He could tell there was someone there, and his first thought was to get his parents. But he didn’t. He leaned out a little further and looked down. “John, is that you?” he asked. “What are you doing?”
“I don’t know,” Sherlock said. “Something happened . . . I don’t remember. But it meant I could come home.”
“That’s a lie, John Watson,” she said. “We do know what he wanted even if he never told us  directly."
“But --” Sherlock felt confused for a minute. “I don’t want to go tomorrow. I’ve been working all week on this -- you helped -- let’s go out tonight.”
Someone was at the mic talking. Sherlock glanced at John and nodded his head toward the bar. “Just some water,” he said and then turned to John. “Let’s get drinks before we head back to the table.”
Sherlock was lying on his bed, holding a book he’d hoped would distract him from his frustration, both about the case and about John. “Come in,” he said, pushing himself to sit up.
He knew he should go after her, thank her for all the help because she had given him so much. But he didn’t. Instead he went back to his computer and sent Lestrade an email. It wasn’t much, but Mrs Hudson was right: he had to do something useful.
“You’re shouting,” Sherlock said calmly. “You’ve shouted at me two times in the last two minutes. But I guess that doesn’t matter.”
John thought for a moment -- he hadn’t expected to stay and didn’t have any of his things. "Yeah, I will," he said eventually.
John fixed up the bed and came out to find Sherlock just as the bell rang. He glanced at Sherlock and went down to answer the door.
John stared up at him, letting the words he'd just heard play in his head over and over again. "You? Oh . . ." he said. He moved closer, traced and then held Sherlock's jaw before tugging him down gently and kissing him.
"Clara. She's in London for work for a few weeks, so I'm going to see her. We have a lot to talk about."
John laughed. "Right, so that confirms it -- I'm keeping the coat." He took out a cigarette and put it unlit to his mouth. "I hate breathing," he teased in the low voice again.
“It’s me,” Sherlock said. “No uniform, no rank -- I hope that’s not going to be a problem,” he added with a grin.
“I’m sorry our lives aren’t as fascinating as yours is,” she said, drying her hands on a tea towel. “What do you and John do all day that keeps the precious Sherlock entertained?”
“I learn more about you everyday, John Watson,” Sherlock said, pulling the rest of his clothes off. “Turn over,” he said as he pushed away and then scooted close behind him like a spoon. He reached round and started stroking him again. He moved his mouth to John’s neck and nuzzled the skin there. John pushed back against Sherlock, moaning his name.
Sherlock had just checked his email to find nothing when he heard the knock. He went downstairs and pulled open the door. He hid his smile when he saw John’s face. “I knew you’d be back,” he said.
John's breath caught in surprise, but he brought his arm up and stroked Sherlock's hair. "We'll be safe here."
He turned on the television and flipped through the channels. On one, a band was playing and he stopped, wondering if it had been the band tonight. Doubtful really, plus he didn’t really remember a single thing about the band -- what they looked or sounded like. He was too focused on watching for the woman’s boyfriend.
On the screen, Tom tried to slam Jerry with a large frying pan, but he missed and it bounced back and hit his own face.
“It’s okay if you’re nervous. I was nervous for my first kiss.” She moved back to the side of him. “It’s all right. We don’t have to if you don’t want to. Don’t you like me?”
"They're cases, not stories," Sherlock said, looking at the menu for no reason. "Stories are fiction. The cases are all true."
"Okay, I dare you to swap clothes with me," Sherlock said. "You're wearing a bulky sweater so you can't truly appreciate how cold I am."
John worked with the new information, but after a while he had no choice to accept that this guy did not exist. He didn’t know who had been communicating with the client, but the name and face and career had all been lies, which only meant the promise of a future together had been as well. John sat at the computer and typed out his message.
John left the collar up and stuffed his hands in the pockets. He strutted around the sitting room looking very serious. "You're all idiots. Your tiny brains make me sick," he said with a deep voice.
“All right,” Sherlock said. “Well, this was a very unusual visit,” he added as the moved to the door.
Sherlock smiled. “Let’s leave that for a bit,” he said, pinching John’s arm a little. “Let’s just be us here at home for a while.”
Sherlock laughed aloud and rolled on top of John. “Cheeky,” he said, putting a wet kiss on John’s mouth. “At least now I finally get the benefit.”
John lay beside Sherlock. Even with the movie going things seemed too quiet. Awkward. When it was over, he shifted and got up. "I should go home now."
"Okay. I'll be back in a bit." He went up and got his toiletries and his dressing gown. He went into the bathroom and shut the door. He wanted to look around, but he didn't. He started the water and waited a few minutes before checking it and getting in.
Harry just lifted her hand in a wave as they left and went down the stairs. John let her into the taxi first before climbing in and giving the address.
“Hmm. I'll write it up tomorrow. The Detective and His Blogger," John laughed. "Or something like that."
“Well, just be sensible,” she said. She closed her eyes for a minute. “I’m just picturing the two of you walking down the aisle now.”
Sherlock’s anxiety immediately turned to anger. “We have a website, we have a phone number – why risk everyone’s health coming here?” he said.
“Hello,” he said as he quickly tried to come up with something. “I’m a mouse.” He looked at John stupidly and then covered his face, giggling.
Sherlock started a painfully slow rhythm, moving his mouth up and down John's cock. His hand explored between John's legs.
John chuckled and grabbed the knife to cut out a piece. Something crunched and he paused. He pushed the meat and vegetables out of the way and saw the noodles -- they were raw. He bit his lip and started laughing quietly, then a bit louder as he cut into more of it.
"Well, I could have stood in the hall or something, just to be there for support. And no one would have thought that because I would have come to all of them. They would have known we were friends." He watched Sherlock, feeling a bit sad that people would think he was paying for friends.
“I did, but I was just trying to make conversation,” Sherlock said. “Make one of the frozen things that’s left. Don’t make a fuss – today we’re doing nothing, so make it quick and easy.”
Instead of continuing up the stairs he turned towards the window and fully opened the curtains to let the light into the flat. He turned and looked around the room. The place needed to be cleaned up and this was the time -- without Sherlock adding to the mess at the same time. He moved around the room and took pictures of some things he wasn't sure how to dispose of, sending them to Sherlock. Then he started cleaning and organising everything he could get rid of. He turned on the radio while he worked, keeping his phone close so he could hear if Sherlock replied.
Sherlock quickly grabbed a second mug from the cupboard. “I made you this cup of tea,” he said, dribbling the recently boiled kettle into the cup. “Here you go,” he said, sliding it over to John. He took the one he’d made for himself to the table and sat down. “So where have you been?” he asked.
“Fine,” Sherlock said. “Look, I’ve got a little more I want to work on tonight, but then I can explain the details if you want to work on notes for the blog.”
"You are really obnoxious, John Watson," Sherlock said with a smile. "Your turn or is the game done?"
John put on his pajamas and then came out to join Sherlock. He sat on the sofa, close enough to cuddle if Sherlock wanted to.
John looked at the cards in mock disappointment. Then he grinned and put his own down. "Full house."
Since John moved in, Sherlock had not once searched through his things or invaded his privacy in any way. He’d considered it obviously, but at first, he was just trying hard to be a ‘normal’ flatmate and then eventually he realised he really respected John. He even thought of him as a friend, though he wasn’t sure he actually ever had used the word.
“Anyway, let me get the samples for you,” she said, disappearing for a moment and then returning with a small cooler. Sherlock opened it quickly to check the contents.
John turned at the sound of the door, the phone falling from his hand. "Sherlock! I thought . . . why are you home?"
“Romance,” Sherlock scoffed. “You’re a smart person, yet you’re basing your entire future on fairy tales you read as a child? First off, you’re not tall, that’s just a fact. Secondly, you don’t even have a horse – how are you planning to ride in on one if you don’t even have a horse?” He laughed a little and tossed a pillow over at John.
As they drove, Sherlock asked questions. He didn’t always wait for answers. He was thinking aloud. And he was very, very eager. John couldn't do anything but watch, hoping they would actually let him go inside. He was curious and excited.
“I don’t feel I’ve learned anything, if I’m honest,” he said. “How can there be so little information about a man as rich as that gallery owner? I’ve searched everything. I can’t find any family, education or employment history . . . the few times his name comes up it’s only in reference to the gallery. I don’t know what to make of it.”
Sherlock looked round the flat, trying to decide if John would want him to tidy anything before she arrived. He wasn't sure so he sat down in his chair. He wasn't sure Harry's visit was going to be a good one, and he worried that John was going to be hurt.
“I’m not bored,” Sherlock said. He stood up and took his mug to the sink then turned around and looked out blankly at the flat. “I think I’ll turn on the television,” he said, moving into the sitting room and flopping onto the sofa.
“God,” Sherlock called out. He squeezed shut his eyes and tilted his head back. “I love when you fill me, John, when you’re part of me . . .”
Sherlock spent the next hour skimming through the video they’d gotten from the security firm before noticing that a segment was missing -- whether that was an error on young Lawrence’s part or a clue, he wasn’t sure. However, Sherlock was certain that the answer wasn’t going to appear on film. Whoever did this was more clever than that. It had to be an inside job, so he tried to find information on Charles Altamont, the owner, but he wasn’t coming up with anything. That didn’t seem right. He got up and dressed himself for an afternoon of investigation. He didn’t like not knowing, of course, and he still wasn’t quite sure who or what he was looking for, but he found himself heading down to the street with a smile on his face. He loved the process and had no doubt he’d find the solution soon.
Sherlock stepped back and headed in, leaving the door open for John to follow. He was smiling out of sight. John closed the door and followed him up to his flat.
"I don't -- well, yes, kind of." John admitted. "I know science though, so I understood it. I don't think the average person would’ve. And I would have never guessed you were a detective from it," he said.
John leaned back into his hand again with a small hum. "What do you need to show me?" he asked, taking another sip of wine.
He lifted one of his legs over John’s, arching slightly. “It feels good,” he mumbled, dropping a hand to John’s lower back.
"Let me take it off you," Sherlock said, slowly unbuttoning the coat. "I want to help you, John. With whatever you need."
“Good,” Sherlock said. “We should’ve tried it before maybe -- saved you all that money on your stupid dates.” He stretched a little. “Did you like doing it that way or do you think you’d prefer something else?”
She was grinning like she had just won a great prize. "I'm in the area for a little while and thought I'd stay with my brother in his fancy flat," she said.
"When he came back from the war, he needed someone -- you're his sister, you should have been there for him," he said. "You're weren't. But I was."
“Good night, John,” Sherlock said, holding John closely. He lay there for a couple minutes and then said, “Are you already asleep or can I say one more thing?”
"Mmhm, of course," she said. "It’s not just a bag, John, we both know that." She got up and left him alone.
"True," Sherlock said. He took a sip of wine and then stood up, moving the dishes to the sink. "I suppose I should bin this?" he asked, lifting the casserole dish.
“It had to seem real, and he knew -- everyone knew -- that only your acceptance would be convincing,” Sherlock admitted. “I’m so sorry you had to be hurt.”
"Just some granola bars and cereal and things like that -- nothing for the fridge," John said. "Want to go explore the forest?"
He pedaled hard to get to Sherlock's. They had been planning this for ages, and he was excited. It took just over 15 minutes -- Sherlock's family lived further out, in a big house that still impressed John. He skid to a stop and dropped his bike in the grass, hurrying up the steps to ring the bell.
John moved his mouth over Sherlock's and kissed him hard, breathlessly as he let go and followed Sherlock into his own orgasm. His whole body was on fire.
“Oh, do shut up,” she said as they walked over to the hall. “It was a lovely ceremony, don’t you think?” she asked him.
John shrugged. "He didn't leave anything behind, and he didn't say anything. I got him a servicing kit for his violin, I hope he'll like that."
John woke up and heard Mrs Hudson moving around the kitchen. He didn't want to talk about the things that had tried to keep him up all night. He waited until she was gone before getting up to shower and start his day.
"Just listen. A patient I regularly see tested positive for Covid, so I have to isolate and keep track of my symptoms for a couple weeks."
He saw patients with a good attitude, working quickly through the long lines and full waiting room. He wanted to finish and get home again, not because he was tired or annoyed but because he was happy and excited to see Sherlock again, to keep exploring this new relationship.
Once they got into the taxi, Sherlock turned. “John,” he said. “What are we going to do at your flat?”
“Call me soon,” Sherlock said and then realised what that sounded like. He closed the door and then grabbed his phone to clarify by text.
Sherlock looked at John. How was he not supposed to think about that night with John looking so incredibly handsome with his wet hair and relaxed face? How could John seem so relaxed when Sherlock felt so . . . what did he feel? He took a sip of tea and tried to speak. “Everything all right?” he asked.
John looked over and couldn't help a small smile. What luck! "I was invited, believe it or not," he said. "I went to school with Molly."
“Yes, you do,” Mrs Hudson said. “How are you ever going to meet a nice man if you behave like that?” She carried the tea into the sitting room and handed him a mug.
Sherlock threw his stick into the woods. “I’ve had enough of that sweetness,” he said. “It kind of made me feel sick. I’ll make some tea, but I think I’ll jump in the shower.” He got up and picked up the plates to carry them inside. He threw them into the bin and washed off the silverware and then took a quick shower to rinse off. He returned with two mugs.
John smiled softly and sipped his tea as she did the dishes. He hadn't expected any kind of gift -- Sherlock barely remembered to eat half the time, he doubted Sherlock would have taken time to get a present for him. But that didn’t matter. Sherlock would be back soon enough and they would be back on their cases -- that's what John really wanted.
Sherlock dipped his head in a little nod. “Are we going to go home today or shall we stay here forever?” he asked.
Sherlock had drifted back to sleep when he hear his phone vibrate. He smiled at John’s message and sent back the same before dragging himself from the bed and going into the bathroom. He decided to shower and get dressed before going downstairs. When he went into his kitchen, his mother was sitting at the table with a pot of tea.
“Well, I was embarrassed when you told me,” Sherlock said. “No, wait, I don’t mean embarrassed – I mean, bored.” He was enjoying teasing John. And if he was honest, he kind of liked the idea of being in John’s head at night. “Look, clearly this is an issue for you. You always make a fuss about people thinking we’re a couple . . . that’s probably why you dreamt about us shagging – did we actually shag? You don’t have to tell me, I’ll be able to read your face. My point is maybe you’re being influenced by others’ opinions.” He looked over at John directly, just to wind him up.
Sherlock helped get his shirt off and then pulled John down on top of him. The feeling of their chests pressed together was amazing, and he kissed his mouth roughly, arching his hips off the bed. John pulled out of the kiss and moved lower, tugging his trousers and pants off as he went.
John nodded. "That's what the nightmares are about," he said. He looked over at Sherlock again, trying to read the look on his face. Was Sherlock going to be annoyed? Show him pity? Look at him differently?
Sherlock paused for a moment. “Maybe,” he said. “Is that how you got the gig doing that thing for your friend?” he asked.
Sherlock took deep breaths as they walked upstairs. All of this seemed quite fast. He knew he’d been the one who’d started it and obviously it was all real and true -- none of this would have happened if it weren’t. But should John be going along with it? Everyone knew how backward Sherlock was with these things. Why was John going along with it?
"I don't feel that way!" John insisted. "It was just a stupid dream!" He leaned back. "And being at the zoo isn't embarrassing."
Sherlock lay there for a few minutes. The cabin was quiet except for John’s breathing and the quiet hum of the small refrigerator. He could hear the noises from outside, which were kind of nice actually. He closed his eyes. The floor still felt quite hard underneath him, despite the cushion of the sleeping bag. He turned on his side and opened his eyes. John’s face was quite near his own. “You asleep?” he whispered. “This is kind of weird.”
When his mind cycled through every horrible possibility, he sighed and stared up at the ceiling. It was a dream, that's all. It was normal, wasn't it? It didn't mean anything. He closed his eyes as his mind replayed intimate details from the dream - the feel of Sherlock's skin under his hands, the taste of his mouth - no. No! He had to forget it. Sherlock would notice it in a second if he didn't get it together.
Sherlock felt an urge to shout something back, but he didn't. He knew addicts, and he knew their thinking. "All right," he said. "I need to work now." He turned his attention back to his laptop.
“Good night, John,” Sherlock said. He closed his eyes to go into his mind palace, but it was too full of questions he wanted answers to. He slowly shifted, rolling onto his side and curling around John. “Okay?” he whispered.
John found the breakfast Mrs Hudson had left for him, and he felt a pang of guilt for having ignored her. But the thought of trying to dissect what he was feeling with her -- he couldn't do it. He didn't understand it himself yet. He didn't want to be pushed in a certain direction, and he didn't think he could stand her smug smile when he admitted that she might be right. Because she was, wasn't she? Something was different now. When had that happened? He pushed his food away and got up, pacing back and forth in the sitting room. He kept glancing at the bag Sherlock had given him.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, shifting a little closer. “I’m acting differently, but it really doesn’t matter.” He looked straight into John’s eyes.
John watched the tall, handsome man walk over and put the wine in front the woman he was talking to. "I'm John," he said, looking up at Sherlock. "Is this your date?" he asked her.
John kept moving slowly, up and down along Sherlock's shaft, his hand between Sherlock's legs playing with his balls. Sherlock continued to writhe on the bed. Suddenly he realised he was getting too close. He didn't know what else John wanted to do, but whatever it was, Sherlock wanted to be able to do it. In fact, at that moment in time, Sherlock would bow to anything John requested. "Too close," he finally said. "I'm going to come if you keep going."
"All right, good," Sherlock said. He went downstairs and looked around the sitting room. It seemed unusual now, the flat felt different even though there was nothing different down here. He realised he'd left his mug upstairs so he found another one and put the kettle on. He went into the bathroom while he waited for it to boil. He considered taking a shower, but instead just washed his face and headed back out, pouring himself a cup of tea which he took to the sofa. It seemed awkward and quiet again, so he turned on the television to the news.
John nodded. "My dad a long time ago. My mum just a few years," he said. "Do you have a big family?"
"Not yet. One day he was called upon for an adventure by an evil prince, an adventure that would take him all over to different places. He was going to need a good team to help him."
“John was just telling me about school,” she said quickly, glancing at John. “Well, I’ll leave you two alone -- let me know if you get hungry and I can make some lunch.” She got up and took her lemonade with her.
