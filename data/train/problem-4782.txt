During this whole process, Steve made a point to always keep his vibranium shield in front of his young son. Steve was not taking any chances. He was perfectly fine getting shot or being hit by the stray piece of rubble. His baby son, however, was not.
“Promise that you wont ever leave me.” Tony begged in the faintest whisper against the base of Steve’s neck.
Tony debated for around half an hour before Steve stepped in again and picked Adeline in an attempt to speed along the process.
King T’Challa laughed again, making the little girl still clutched in his arms giggle at the vibration of her Uncle’s chest. The young King bent down again and welcomed his nephew with a tight hug that made both Peter and his sister, Sarah, giggle with delight.
Was that really true? Tony searched Steve’s face for any falsehood hidden there. There was none, only firm conviction. He meant it. Steve really meant it. Tony couldn’t resist leaning in and kissing Steve, even if it was chaste.
Steve reached the top of the rubble pile and slowly slid down the other side to reach a large hole in the side of a building. About half way down, Peter's still developing motor skills failed him and his bag of cheerios slipped from his grip. Steve adeptly reached down and caught the bag eliciting a high pitched squeal of delight from his baby son who then proceeded to laugh and clap his hands together in excitement. Steve had become so used to this over the past hour that his son's actions didn't surprise him in the least. However the increase in noise doubled Steve's desire to get out of the open as quickly as possible.
In an over abundance of caution, the new parents had decided that Peter was not to leave their newly updated security laden home until the dust had settled after his family's murder.
“Oh really?” Steve said in a slightly shaky breath, Tony’s hands having been inching slowly closer to his member. “Are you planning on returning the favor any time soon?”
Steve wove a hand into Tony’s hair, the other securely wrapped around his lower back, and his face pressed against the top of his partner’s head.
Yes. He was. Tony would do anything to protect his people from the usurper that has killed his father two years ago and King Steven was a notoriously powerful man. This was his only way back and he was going to do everything in his power to ensure it worked. His hand tightened on the rope.
One particularly bad night, Tony’s tossing and turning had woken up Steve. He looked over to find his lover’s face scrunched in pure unadulterated agony. He quickly shook Tony awake hoping to spare his love any more suffering.
Everyone in the room looked down slightly, knowing full well that the “people” that Steve was talking about were in fact Hydra. Steve knew first hand how Hydra treated people who possessed abilities they wanted. After all, his best friend had been their longest and most consistent victim.
She pulled him into the center of the floor and pushed her hands flat against his. “You know the moves right.” Her words just barley audible over the drums.
Tony looked up at his friend and took in the winding blue patterns that were painted all over his skin. Objectively Tony knew that Bruce was a druid priest, but it was something else entirely to see it in person. Tony had become used to the way the Celtic people’s of the continent dressed during his two years with them, but the druid priestly robes were nothing like Tony expected them to be. They were gray, loose, and flowing. They were tied with a rope made of purple and dark green fibers with several types of plants tucked into it that must have had some meaning that Tony didn’t know.
“Your Majesty, I have come to humbly request I be allowed to return to your guard. I have wronged your Majesty, but I wish to make amends and pay for my sins in any way you deem necessary.”
Steve took a moment to look up the sky and mumble something incoherent under his breath, though Tony knew that he was asking for patience. He always did that when Tony had done something particularly exasperating.
“Yes, Steven, I do believe you have chosen your consort wisely. Now,” she turned back to the others in the room. “You have heard what I have to say. My son will hear anything else you wish to impart on the matter soon.” And with a dismissive hand gesture, the room cleared save for Steve, Sarah, Tony himself, and the man standing behind Sarah Rogers’s chair.
They were silent once again, but this time it wasn’t nearly as comfortable. Tony faced forward and refused to meet his almost-husband’s eyes again even though he could feel Steve’s gaze like a physical weight. They kept riding in silence until the trees started to thin. Tony could just begin to see the edges of a large valley with what seemed to be a cluster of buildings near the tree line.
Steve reached out for the silver handle and opened the thick door. It opened to a large rounded room with a four poster bed in the center of it. The floor was covered in soft furs and there were two large circles of glass embedded in the stone wall. Their circumference must have been as long as Tony’s arm.
It had been almost a month since Steve and Tony had brought home their new baby daughter. The media in particular had a field day with the story of the super hero couple’s new baby girl. The public was practically drooling over the images of the baby that Steve and Tony had begrudgingly released at the insistence of Pepper, who had astutely said that the media would not leave them alone until they got a glimpse of the baby the media had taken to calling “America’s new Sweat Heart”.
Peter’s eyes lit up and he opened his mouth to say something, but Tony cut him off before he could start.
Tony hadn’t attempted suicide again after witnessing what it did to his lover, but Steve knew that it was a close thing. He was well aware of the guilt that Tony felt over creating Ultron in the first place, but he also knew that his lover’s willingness to go to such drastic measures in order to protect their friends, their family, and the rest of the world had stemmed from something. The same something that was eating Tony from the inside out. Steve tried to do everything he could, but it just didn't seem to change anything.
Tony felt his heart skip a beat and even more heat pool in his belly. That was kind of hot. Much hotter than Tony expected his eventual Alpha’s possessiveness to be. But, there was something off about Steve’s statement.
“Steve Rogers”, Tony began. “You are the most infuriating man that I have ever met…” Steve smiled slightly before Tony concluded his statement with, “…and you’re dead wrong”.
King T’Challa was moments away from putting the fool of a man in his place and marching over to the landing pad to beg for his friends forgiveness when a commotion caught his attention.
Tony snapped out of his stupor and quickly dismounted. He made his way over to his fiancé and took the offered hand. Tony could swear that he felt a spark when their skin touched, but he ignored it in favor of following Steve into the large house.
Steve still looked like he was rethinking the whole idea of a "night out" when Tony placed a hand on his lower back.
At the end of their ordeal, it was Tony who was badly broken.Tony was plagued by nightmare after nightmare where he was forced to relive the terror of the vision that Wanda had inflicted upon him. It had gotten so bad that one day Steve had walked into their bedroom to check on Tony only to find his lover gone. Eventually, after franticly searching, the super soldier found his lover in their master bathroom wielding a wicked looking knife. Tony had already inflicted cut after cut on his arms and had the kitchen knife prized over his wrist, ready to inflict one last and final blow. In that instant, seeing his lover so torn apart and broken, Steve felt as if his heart had been ripped from his chest and was laying in the steady stream of blood stemming from Tony’s arms. It was terrifying and incredibly detrimental to both partners.
The Black Panther only nodded, eyeing his minister somewhat warily as he walked away from his King and the young children in his arms. Sarah was still whimpering when her fathers came rushing in looking slightly frantic and haggard.
“Rest assured, I will be thoroughly looking into him.” He declared, eyeing Steve and Tony in particular at this statement.
"Yes, well I was a little preoccupied wasn't I?" Steve said angrily as he gestured sharply with his free hand to the small children he had shielded.
As soon as Thor could no longer hear the engine of his friends' expensive car, Thor walked into the living room and sat himself and the young Peter on the couch.
Tony was so far gone into the darkest depths of his subconscious that he didn't even notice how stiff his lover had become.
Tony took a moment to really look at her face. He could see the genuine emotion hidden behind the mask of neutrality she wore. It seemed she really did care for the man she was married to.
Tony braced for impact. “You’re going to have to be a bit more specific, Steve. My father did a lot of things that could have worried you.”
Once the door was closed behind him, Tony moved to begin unpacking his first trunks. He opened the latched to see which one was on top and found it filled with his personal attire. It was a mix of a few Etruscan style clothing the mainland Celts had smuggled out of his home for him, and the style of clothing favored by his adopted people. Tony began placing his clothing in the armoire along side his betrothed’s. By the time he was finished, the armoire was alarmingly full.
The more Tony thought about it, the more worried he became. So, the genius endeavored to do anything and everything to keep himself distracted until his lover returned home to him.
In the end it took the three of them two hours to get Peter down and it was only because Peter had exhausted himself and smashed every even remotely interesting object in sight. It had been Tony who caught Peter and as a reward he ended up pinned to the floor by the enchanted hammer that now, apparently, two people could wield. Tony was decidedly not "getting lucky" tonight.
Tony marched after his lover and had opened his mouth to argue before Steve shot him “that” look, the one that meant there was absolutely no arguing with him, after which the younger man immediately froze up, all arguments dead on his tongue. It looked like there would be no sex for Tony in the foreseeable future.
They were soon faced by an even greater threat than before, this time one of their own creation, or more specifically Tony’s creation: Ultron. In order to protect their children, the heroes left them with Clint’s previously unknown wife and family. They trusted that the safeguards Fury had set up to protect their fellow Avenger’s family would be suitable for defending their own children as well.
There was a fierce layer of protective fury inlaid in her words that clearly told Steve if he hurt Tony he would regret it. Tony shivered. Pepper was scary when she wanted to be. Steve merely nodded, apparently having sensed that Pepper was not to be trifled with. Probably for the best he figured that out now as opposed to later. Thor’s brother had made that mistake early on and it had taken three of Thor’s fiercest warriors to keep Pepper from killing him when he inevitably pissed her off.
“I love you too.” He said adoringly, before pulling Tony down into a much deeper and more sensual kiss. Tony’s hands started trailing lower and Steve’s hands wound themselves into his hair.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
“Steven. You are returned.” She smiled warmly. Her eyes moved away from her son to take in Tony, still standing where Steve had left him. “Are you going to introduce me to your husband?”
Crap. Tony had forgot to look at his face. What if he was ugly? Well then Tony could admire the hot body pounding into him when they consummated their union. Tony’s eyes traveled up to his betrothed’s face rather hesitantly, but what Tony found there made his heart skip a beat. The first thing he noticed was the man’s strong jaw followed by his plump lips and sweeping golden hair, but that wasn’t what drew Tony’s focus. No, it was the bright blue eyes that dragged Tony in. It was like a fire had been set under his skin. Those eyes made him blaze in a way he didn’t know was possible.
Steve took another look around the decimated room, taking in the presence of multiple other empty cribs and a few changing tables. He quickly walked over to the cleanest of those changing tables and set the baby down. Steve unwrapped the baby as delicately as he could so as to not further irritate any already existing injuries. After he did a quick inspection, he discovered that the little baby was unharmed much to his relief.
“Goodnight, Steve.” Tony said, wiggling further against his husband’s chest and studiously ignoring the evidence of Steve’s interest in him. If Steve wasn’t going to satisfy both of them then he could deal with the consequences.
Steve was silent for a long time. Tony thought he was going to drop the subject, let in sink into the ocean that was between them and be buried at the bottom.
As if sensing his lover’s harmful train of thought, Tony reached out and wrapped his arms securely around Steve’s abdomen. He pulled them together until they were chest to chest, their legs tangled together until Tony wasn't sure where he began and Steve ended.
Tony’s feet, unlike his heart, continued on their correct corse and brought Tony to the center of the raised stone platform in front of Bruce. Tony’s face was now tilted up slightly to continue his examination of those eyes. Neither of them moved until someone cleared their throat. Tony looked over to see Bruce waiting expectantly, hands still out flat. Tony quickly reached over and placed his right hand in Bruce’s as his opposite did the same. Tony glanced at Bruce’s face and saw the amusement at Tony’s reaction to his handsome betrothed. Tony was tempted to glare, but realized that might give the wrong impression and abstained.
Rhodey stepped closer to him and coughed pointedly. Clearly Tony had take too long to think it over. Fine. Steve was still a night of the realm. It’s not like there was a real reason that the public was aware of for him to not be a member of Tony’s guard. And technically Steve was still his consort. Tony hadn’t taken anyone else to his bed since their wedding night and their marriage still held. Tony hadn’t been able to bear asking Bruce to annul it. After all, Tony had thought the memory of their vows and the ring on his finger to be the last parts of Steve left to him beyond their children. But after what had happened… Tony wasn’t sure if he would ever see Steve again. He supposed this was his chance to have the man in his sights again, even if it wasn’t what he really wanted.
“Oh, yes you are!” Tony continued, blowing a raspberry into his daughters stomach. “How will I ever get laid with such a cute little cock blocker in the house?”
“Look at how big you’re both getting!” King T’Challa said affectionately before straightening up and this time lifting both children with him.
“He hated the fact that I was an omega among other things, even if it suited him in the end. He had always planed to eventually auction me off to the highest bidder among the aristocracy of the city and breed me to get a real male heir to take the throne. Preferably an alpha.”
That was certainly not the last night that the vision haunted Tony’s dreams, but it was the first night since that fateful mission that he was able to sleep without visiting that darkest pit of his subconscious where the vision now dwelled.
For a moment, King T’Challa looked miles away before abruptly returning to the conversation at hand.
“Steve.” Tony whined. “You said you’d fuck me when we weren’t out in the open.” Tony spread his legs wider, letting the scent of his building slick build. “We’re not in the open anymore.”
“Looks like I'm not the only one.” The Captain countered huskily. His hand reaching boldly down between their half naked bodies and cupping Tony’s ever growing arousal.
It seemed to take an eternity to make their way to the highest point in the village. When they finally arrived, Tony was greeted by the sight of a tall wooden gate that slowly opened for them as they approached. The gates opened into a small cobblestone courtyard in front of a large building.
“I’m sorry about this.” Steve addressed Tony once the man was out of earshot. “My mother is a bit overzealous sometimes. She’s just excited to meet you and see us married.”
Steve’s previously stoic face had a soft, glowing smile on it now and it was directed at Tony. Tony’s traitorous little heart fluttered slightly. Maybe he hadn’t ruined anything after all.
That sentiment however was quickly erased by yet another wail, which child it emanated from the genius would never know.
Steve nodded, his face making an interesting attempt to blush while trying to retain the serious mask he was already reforming. Steve backed up slowly but still ran into the wall instead of the door. He stumbled a bit before turning around and leaving reluctantly.
The drums picked up the beat of the next song, the sound reverberating in his sternum in a harsh unending beat. The two of them began moving counter to each other. Pushing their hands together and then apart as they moved. Tony had spent enough time with the Celts to know their dances like the back of his hand. They were different enough form the dances back home that Tony could escape those memories for a fleeting moment. The harsh steps and resounding beat a welcome counter to the overly soft and flowing movements of the Etruscan court dances.
Steve’s back stiffened instantly from his place in front of the crib on the other side of the room while he cuddles Peter in his arms. The baby boy having needed soothing after being distressed about his little sister’s own unhappiness.
“You are mine.” Steve growled. “Only I get to hear you, see you, smell you like this from now on. They are not allowed to have you like this.” Steve’s grip tightened slightly, pulling Tony even more firmly against his body.
When the chapter was done Tony surreptitiously checked to see how close to sleep Peter was. He took in the slowing rise and fall of his son’s little chest and carefully slid off the bed. He placed the book on the night stand and was just turning to leave when a little voice stopped him in his tracts.
“Please! Please tell me whats wrong so I can help you.” Steve implored, tears of his own stinging his eyes.
“What kind of lesson?” Tony asked, dread fulling up his every pore and his face growing steadily more and more pale.
Steven gently lead Tony over to a small table already littered with food. It was set at the head of a long U made up of other tables with a large bonfire in the middle. At some point music had begun to play and people were already filling the empty center space to dance.
Peter had stopped his fascination with the cheerios and had instead focused on the small squishy looking thing that his father was currently focused on. He reached up and grabbed a portion of the blanket that was covering one of the babies feet. The baby jerked and made a slight noise that startled Peter. He let go quickly and reared back as far as he could to get away from the strange thing.
Steven opened his mouth and said, “I swear to be honest and true. To guard you, keep you, and honor you.”
Tony nodded and the pair or siblings slowly made their way out of the great room and into one of the many halls that appeared to be carved into the mountain side. Tony’s curiosity peaked.
“My father… My father was a brilliant man in many ways.” Tony hesitated for a moment before deciding that if he couldn’t be honest with his husband about this, who could he be. “He was horrible in many, many others. For one, being King.” Tony scoffed. “The only thing my father ever truly cared about was money. Earning it, keeping it, and making more of it. He would do anything for money. Even betray his own people, not to mention his family.”
Steve smiled brilliantly before raising to his full height, his mother’s hand dropping elegantly back into her lap.
“Very well, your Majesty. If there is anything else this evening please ring for me, I shall retire for the evening.” Jarvis said with a polite bow.
Ah, Tony understood now. Thor had explained this too and had entrusted the intricately carved silver goblet to Rhodey for safe keeping. Another old tradition about the man closest to the person being the one to hold the gifts for their intended. Thor told Tony that after their “hand fasting”, Tony refused to believe the what they actually called it, there would be an exchanging of gifts where Rhodey was to give Tony the goblet and after filing it with mead Tony was to offer it to his husband and say his name. This was somehow supposed to solidify their marriage. Tony really was so confused about all of this stuff. The Celts had some weird traditions.
It had been a hard few months for Steve and Tony. It had begun wonderfully with the adoption of their precious baby girl. They’d had a peaceful couple of months with her and Peter to get used to the newest iteration of their family, but reality had soon come crashing down on them.
Tony chuckled. “Yes, your Uncle Rhodey and I used to run around the tunnels all day scaring the maids when we were just a few years older than you.”
“You’re all dead and gone, yet I'm still alive. Just sitting there, staring at the three of you, and wishing that I was dead too.” Tony concludes in a harsh whisper, self loathing permitting every word like acid spilling from his mouth.
Several hours latter, Steve and Tony had returned from their evening out. Steve looked much more relaxed about the whole situation than when they left the house. Tony, for his part, looked very pleased with himself and was wearing and expression that practically screamed "I'm getting lucky tonight". That was, however, before the two of them registered the sight that awaited them inside the house.
Bruce was far too serious for Tony’s tastes. Tony looked away, heat high on his cheeks from the dedication his friend was showing him. Tony knew where Bruce’s dedication to him stemmed from and firmly believed that he didn’t deserve that kind of loyalty for merely doing what anyone should have done. Tony hated the slave trade with a burning passion. He used to often go down to the docks in his city and buy all the slaves the traders brought just to free them later. It pissed his father off and often got Tony beaten, but anything was better than allowing hundreds of people to be forced into a fate even worse than Tony’s was.
Steven held the blade out for him. Tony gently reached up and took the danger from Steven’s hands. It was surprisingly light, but Tony could already feel that the metal was sturdy. This really was a weapon meant for personal protection or the protection of someone else, it was not a tool for battle. Tony’s eyes ran appraisingly over the hilt as he placed it on the table. It was a very finely crafted little blade.
“Oh”. Peter’s eyes drifted from Tony’s face to the canopy of his bed. “Is he going to stay here again.”
“My mother was having trouble giving my father children, so when Bucky was born she accepted him with open arms despite the pain it caused her at first, but she quickly came to love him. She raised him as her own and several months later, when she finally fell pregnant with me, she even nursed him at her own breast. She refused to even leave him when she and my father traveled into the mountains when it came time for me to be born.” Steve paused. “Despite that, Bucky and I could both tell that our father’s other marriages, however brief, took a tole on our mother. We both decided we never wanted more than one marriage because of it.”
Tony had met Bruce when the man who bought him had tried to beat Bruce to death in the market for saying something in the druid language. Tony had stopped it, had the man imprisoned, and nursed Bruce back to health before setting him free. To Tony’s surprise, Bruce had decided to stay with him just like Pepper and Rhodey had. The three of them had stayed with Tony through everything and had even come here with him. Tony didn’t think he deserved it for merely trying to right the wrongs right in front of him, but he couldn’t say he wasn’t grateful for they company. The there of them had been the ones who saved his life when Pierce had sacked their city and killed his parents. They meant everything to Tony.
Tony nodded his understanding and Steven smiled brightly at him again. It made Tony’s knees a little weak.
Minister Ku opened his mouth as if to retort, the anger glistening in his eyes, but little Sarah Rogers-Stark’s whimper cut him off. Concern immediately overcame the previously stoic face of the young King.
"Has he been like this the whole time?" Tony asked. A combination of exasperation, humor, and wariness tinging his voice.
Tony opened his mouth to say something when a young boy with fiery red hair came running into the room. He hastily bowed upon entering and then addressed Steve.
Sarah began to rise from her chair, but stumbled slightly. Steve and his uncle both rushed to help her, but Steve got there first and gently caught his mother.
Bruce’s hands suddenly flew into Tony’s line of sight. He watched as Bruce lined up the two ropes and folded them in half. Bruce placed the loop over their clasped arms and pulled the ends under their joined hands, pulled the ends securely through the loop, and tied the two ropes together intricately. He then folded the ends over their arms once more and completed another set of complicated knots, ensuring they could not remove their arms from the bind. Bruce dropped the rope and held his hands out, palms facing down, and said some words in a language still Tony didn’t understand even after having been with Bruce for nearly three years now.
Steve only nodded and followed Tony up to what used to be their chambers. Tony checked over his shoulder as why went up the stairs and noted the reassuring shadow of two guards standing outside the door at the bottom of the stairs. It had become something of a habit after the war started to always check the guards were still there after putting Peter to bed. Tony couldn’t help the feeling that there was another enemy lurking out there and something told him that when they came Peter would be in the line of fire. It ate at his stomach in a way even having Steve back in their space couldn’t hold a candle to.
He quickly turned and began slowly making his way towards the noise, his shield held protectively in front of Peter. The sound came again and this time Steve recognized what it was, a baby. Steve swiftly made his way towards the sound while still remaining aware of potential places for an enemy to hide in. He finally traced the now constant noise to a small dank room. There was a large hole in the far wall that let in an abundance of light and with it the chill of the outdoors. Squeezed into a small space, in what would have been a rather hidden corner of the room, was a small crib where the source of the wailing was coming from.
Peter was just waking up from his nap and was staring bleary eyed up at Steve who smiled back at his baby boy. Peter reached up his arms weakly, a silent message for Steve to pick him up. Steve complied and reached down to pick up his young son. Peter, it turned out was still clutching his stuffed elephant teddy bear. Steve chuckled slightly and then deposited Peter on one of his hips, balancing the toddler expertly as he moved over to the makeshift crib to check on his new baby girl.
Tony reached his arms out towards the blonde and a moment later his husband was curled against him sobbing into his chest.
Tony was just beginning to think that he had let the silence drag on for too long when they entered another hallway and found Steve waiting for them by the door.
Silence almost seemed to echo in the space between them. Tony looked away. In truth he had missed Steve like a lost limb, but he was still furious with the man for keeping the truth from him. From fighting him to let Barnes get away. Tony knew the moment the fight was over that the man couldn’t be held accountable for something he was forced to do, but the shock and pain had blinded him to that. If only Steve had told him sooner than it never would have happened, but his husband hadn’t trusted him. And then he had fought him, hurt him physically as well as emotionally. There was so much pain and mistrust and hurt between them that Tony wondered how they would ever get past it.
Steve’s eyes flicked up to meet Tony’s again. The heat in that gaze had turned into a fire just as warm and bright as the real one behind them. Steve’s hand trailed up over Tony’s neck to cup his jaw. Tony’s eyes never left Steve’s as his betrothed leaned down and kissed him.
The genius pushed back so that there were a few inches of space between his lover’s delectable body and his own. Looking directly into Steve’s slightly flushed face, Tony replied, “With pleasure”.
“That's my boy. Now,” Tony turned to the bedside table and picked up the book they had been reading before bed. Tony shifted on the bed so he could curl an arm around his son and still support the book. “lets pick up where we left off last night, shall we? What could The Men of the X get up to next?”
Using Tony’s tie to his advantage once again, Steve pulled his partner down on top of him as he collapsed onto the bed making sure that Tony hips landed nicely between his already spread legs. Tony let out a strangled moan at their new position and how incredibly sexy he found the man beneath him.
Ah. That explained the closeness he had noticed between Steve and the man he had called Bucky earlier.
Bruce looked at Tony one last time before he walked to the center of the raised circular stone platform at the center of the sacred space. Once Bruce had taken his place, everyone fell silent. Bruce raised his arms out in each direction and laid his palms out flat, waiting for the two people he was about to bind together.
In lieu of a vocal response, Steve leaned in and kissed Tony lovingly. He had learned a long time ago that the ex-playboy was a much more physical creature than he himself was and Steve knew that sometimes actions spoke louder than words with this man.
At this point he turned back to the very disgruntled and enraged minister, his arms full of the Rogers-Stark children. He was officially back in King mode.
Natasha turned her eyes back to Tony. They were silent for a moment, just taking each other in. There was a silent agreement between the two of them. They would keep each other’s secrets in this court. After all, there was an almost mutually assured destruction for the two of them if the wrong person caught wind of what the other knew.
Tony wondered how the vaguely sweet dried fruit with red edges would taste with some warm honey. Tony had always had a stronger affection for the sweat topping than was probably healthy. His father said it was a weakness to be ashamed of, but Jarvis had always indulged him. He would have to bring some back once they reclaimed his homeland, his city.
As soon as the words came out of his mouth Tony realized how perfect it was seeing as the old man had been friends with his father and therefore was the closest thing his kids would get to a grandfather. Fury had initially attempted to protest, failing miserably as his arguments were drowned out by the laughter of both the avengers and every shield agent in hearing range, but Fury quickly gave up after begrudgingly internally agreeing with what Tony had said. Not that Fury would ever let him know that.
Steve and Tony shared a look. They hadn't actually thought that far yet. Tony was still mildly panicking at the idea of two babies being in the house. Well, at least this one wasn't exhibiting any signs of powers…yet.
“My King, there is a dispute in the village near Dugan’s place. They need you to come at once.” The boy said, his chest heaving from having run there.
Tony crumpled to the floor in a heap of despair, he must have spent a good twenty minutes curled up on the floor trying to pull himself together when Peter cautiously came up to him.
"This. I have no idea what it means, but I think its a logo of some kind. I saw it on a sign on the outside of the building too." Steve explained.
over besides the door as well. Tony looked back at it hopefully. He wondered if his betrothed would allow him to work in his smithy. It was hardly usual for an omega to work in such a field, but Tony could hope that his new husband would be as open minded as his continental relatives had been and allow it. Tony put that worry aside for later. The next trunk held Tony’s books and notebooks filled with calculations and notes on his inventions. He pushed it over to sit besides Steve’s desk.
"Today a few of you will get to practice sparing with one of us, just need to go over a few rules first. Rule number one don't try to go easy on us give your full strength to us, second there will be no weapons aloud when sparing, finally have some fun."
For those who didn't read the notes about Shadow in the first chapter here you'll get more information about her.
Nat ignored what that bitch just said to her little nephew and continues "почему он не сделал тебе больно и учитель кажется, что она на его стороне. Я не против, чтобы надрать ей задницу."
"Miss Jones you know I don't allow bullying in my class even on Field trips. Now unless you want to get sent down to the lobby and expelled then I suggest you let him go this instant!"
Jordie peaks out from the kitchen holding a tray of cookies for everyone "Why won't they let you go on the field trip?" she asks
“ No it means that if she ever uses it she gets to leave, but she leaves with nothing but the clothes on her back and $100 dollars.  She then has 48 hours to change her mind and return.”
Bruce gave a nod, he didn’t usually like other people in his lab whilst he was working but the two new omegas needed to be prepared and ready for introduction to the Pack Alphas in the morning.  Thankfully all the necessary paperwork had been filed with the Omega Registration Centre beforehand and an official had been on hand outside the apartment to inject them with the trackers required by the Centre whilst they had still been unconscious.  Both omegas having been stunned and sedated by Hawkeye and Natasha before being transported to the tower.
I think honestly that Nat is dead, given the level of violence and abuse that occurs in that world. Steve has told me that there are harsh punishments meted out for anyone who commits a crime against Shield or the Avengers.”
It proved to be serendipitous that Spiderman was in the area when Doom attacked with his Doom bots three months ago, the webbing he left behind along with the few drops of blood from his wound gave me ample samples to be able to reverse engineer the genetic modifications caused by the spider bite he received.”
“Oh Tony you were doing so well up until that last comment. Can you tell me what you have done wrong? Hmm.. no, well let me enlighten you.  It may be different with you modern Omegas and Alphas but in my day an Omega had no right what so ever to tell his Alpha to stop he took everything his Alpha gave and more without complaint and never once would have dreamed of saying No!”
Tony blushed red at his Daddy using such a naughty word, but at the same time he could feel his hole clenching and greedily welcoming Daddy’s milk, even if the new addition of his knot made him squirm and mewl as he was once again left hanging as Daddy walked to his crib.  He blushed ten shades redder when he noticed the mirror tile on the floor, and Daddy insisted that he take a good look at how perfect and pretty he looked dangling of his knot.
Winter smirks as Tony Pup’s howls. Tears of frustration dripping from his huge eyes, the pupils blown with lust and need.
Two days later Steve stood staring through the window of the high care room. To one side was the incubator with a small baby attached to all kinds of wires and monitors. The other half of the room held Tony’s bed, he looked small and fragile as he lay sleeping, only the steady beep of the heart rate monitor gave any indication that he was still alive.  Bruce had disconnected all the other machines that morning and removed the IV with the sedative, it would be a few hours before the omega would begin to awaken from his drug induced sleep.
“Ms’ Potts is proving to be quite a challenge, she is naturally very dominant and has a rigid opinion of what she deems, to be acceptable behavior for herself. The trigger words have been implanted but we have been unable to keep her under for more than thirty minutes.
“Just for that show of disobedience JARVIS will you increase the plug to its larges size and keep it on a low constant vibrate!”
The papers the next day called the gas explosion a tragic accident, but a two days later were full of speculation when it became known that she had been fired from Stark Industries for gross misconduct.  The fire report confirmed that the explosion had been an accident and the whole matter faded from the news to be replaced by the news that Tony stark Rogers would be attending ‘The Military Benefit’ with his Alpha Captains Steve Rogers.
Clint head thudded against the table, “Fucking hell! What fucked up world allows an omega to damage themselves in such a way, let alone gives them the freedom to play at being a Superhero.  Also, those suits cost millions, so who is funding him?  Oh my god! Tell me that this version of Stark doesn’t have free control over his own money or his Company, Omegas are not capable of holding such high-powered positions, their brains are not wired to deal with stress or make decisions for themselves.
He thought for a moment he had played his hand to soon, as Steve’s face flushed with anger but then settled into an annoyed frown.  When he slipped off his sweat- pants and climbed over Tony’s head he knew it would be fine.
Tony silently wept as Steve continued to whisper his plans for his omega, there would be little time for anything other than training and correction over the coming days.  Iron Man would only be called for any major incident that occurred, his Alpha did not want him hurt and to take any risks that could affect his chances of becoming pregnant.  He could continue his work for Stark Industries R&D department but would be restricted to how many hours he could work and that if his Alpha ordered his presence he was to stop whatever he was doing immediately and go straight to wherever his Alpha was and in the time limit he was given.
“Hello everyone, don’t speak to my little brat today, unless it is to order him to do something for you or to make a comment on his new tiny penis.”
Bruce smirked as he placed the thick leather collar round Petey’s neck, then pushed him down onto his hands and knees.
Since that time Bruce had spent a great deal of time guiding Steve into more ‘submissive role play scenes’ on the pretence that he was offering his experience, so Steve could then dominate Tony and understand how his omega should be reacting.
Steve’s cocks coating his omega’s cunt walls with cum.  Grinding his hips down he pushes his knot further in his balls flush against Tony’s ass. Ravaging his omega’s mouth swallowing his cries he catches the last fleeting taste of milk with his tongue.
He hauled him up into his lap, the cuffs snapping before they could dislocate Stevie’s shoulders, forcing him down on to his burgeoning knot, kissing him hard, biting and nipping his lips and face, swallowing the wounded cries and mewls, each one sending a jolt of arousal straight to his cock.  He smirked at Stevie’s pathetic attempts to punch him, grabbing his arms and snapping the cuffs together behind his back.
Steve beat a strategic retreat to his couch, breathing a sigh of relief when the door opened and the omega midwife entered.
Cupping his omega’s head gently he feeds the large bulbous head of his cock between Tony’s slack lips, even in his sleep Tony automatically starts sucking his training already deeply ingrained. Fisting his cock, he comes quietly pushed to his orgasm by the gentle suction on his already sensitive cock head, fingers softly stroking his omega’s throat encouraging him to swallow down his thick creamy cum.
Tony slept on as he massaged his cum into his soft skin.  He paid particular attention to the soft pouch of flesh covering the omega’s stomach.  It would reduce in size over the next week, until you would never suspect that he had just given birth.  The c-section cut was hidden, practically healed, due to the healing extremis in Tony’s body.
“Tony you need to sign the agreement you and Steve have made.  It is a formal contract that is binding and will show that you have given consent to the terms that have been agreed.”
Thor when he is at Court takes what he wants when he wants, if he has set his sights on a specific omega, it does not matter whether they are bonded or not.  He will have his way and then just discard them once he is bored with them.
Betty had run three days after their mating, the stupid bitch hadn’t even made it to the Compound gates before he had caught her.  It was his own fault in to an extent, as he had got caught up in an experiment and had not fucked her for 24 hours.  Their bond was still settling and she had been able to disobey his order to remain in their suite.
Exhausted and shaken he curled in Steve’s arms crying out all his anger and frustration at all the disastrous life choices he had made that ended with him nearly dying from drug addiction and experimental body modification treatments.
He looked over at the punishment frame, Stark was spread-eagled, ankles and wrists cuffed to each corner, his limbs trembling already at the strain placed on them by the taut stretch, the cheeks of his naked backside spread, his furled hole stretched wide around the thick base of a plug, thighs glistening with slick.  He shuddered at the distasteful sight of the omega’s caged cock and balls hanging between his spread legs.  The thick leather collar ensured that he could not lower his head, the ball gag muffled his shouts, it was telling that his eyes flashed between anger and pain, there was no remorse or omega submissiveness showing.    It was only the slight swell of barely there, breasts and the soft rounded mound of omega belly that gave away Stark’s true orientation.  There were just a few questions that he needed answers to before he passed judgement.
The majority of time, you will be my sweet little twink, who follows all his Sir’s rules and is a slutty, little whore when hanging off my knot.
Steve wants nothing more to bend his omega over and fuck him senseless, but that would not work with the plans he had for his omega for later in the evening.  Ignoring his omegas mewls of disappointment he withdraws his fingers wraps Tony in a thin robe and leads him to the bedroom sitting him down in front of the dressing table.
Steve quickly placed Tony in the bucket seat of the oversized baby swing, ensuring he tightened the straps, so they pressed across his baby’s stomach, next he placed his mitten covered hands on the swing ropes and secured them with Velcro straps around each wrist.
“Come on Tony just swallow, I am not going to stop until you have finished so don’t make things difficult for yourself and earn another punishment.”
“You are so beautiful Tony come look in the mirror and see for yourself, you are strong and intelligent but left to your own devices you will self-destruct. As your Alpha I will give you structure, order and guidance. I will cherish and care for you but at the same time use a firm hand to provide any correction needed.
5.	You will focus only on your pups and the needs of your Alphas, you will provide for the pack but full integration as an omega of a War Pack will only happen when we have received official and legal recognition.
“Well Steve l will tell you, soldier daddy wasn’t your real daddy, naughty mummy Sarah was being fucked by another omega, and you were the result, a one in ten chance.
“Raider has knotted him, look how round his stomach is, swollen full of cum, you can see the shape of his cock and you can even see the bulge of his knot.  I think we will keep Petey thin, can you picture him with just a pregnant belly and small fat tits with all slender limbs and a pert ass.
The Stark omega was different though, when Bucky had been in control and bonded to the omega Winter had been interested and aroused for the first time in his memory, he had watched and wanted to be with the omega as well. He had disliked intensely the sadistic treatment Bucky had inflicted but had been aroused by the dominant displays of Rogers and Bucky over their omega.
Now colour wise we are going to get rid of this insipid  ginger, yes l know you women like to call it ‘Strawberry  Blonde’ but there is no such colour, it’s just plain old boring dull ginger.”
Steve and Happy both jerked off along with most of the crew as Tony and Pepper were literally hosed down with piss, the beast actor paid special attention to the little bottom, eager to play with him again.  Once he was soaked, he aimed his last steam of piss into the boy’s open mouth, laughing as his tiny cock stood to attention the moment his piss hit those pretty lips.
“Bath-time and then back to bed, you need to rest, your body is reducing in size again thanks to Dr Strange and Dr Loki’s magic.  You have only yourself to blame, I did warn you on numerous occasions what would happen if you ever broke the hard rules and made me incredibly angry and upset with you.”
Winter slipped his fingers in to the tight velvet heat of Tony’s cunt whilst continuing to rub the engorged clit until the omega was a writhing hot sweaty mess, begging Winter to give him release.
Tony threw the dirty diapers in the disposal unit, washed his hands before settling in the rocker with the smallest of his daughters, Maria had weighed in at 6lb 5oz with a shock of dark curls that looked faintly ridiculous to Tony on her tiny head, her sisters Anna and Sarah had both weighted 8lb 10oz with the same dark hair just a lot less of it.  Making sure that she he latched on to his nipple properly he gently set the rocker in motion after draping a soft blanket over her small body, the nursery was warm and she would absorb heat from his body but she still need the extra covering due to her weight.
Bruce watched Pepper’s face whiten at Steve’s words.  It was a good sign that Steve was prepared to deal out some harsh truths to her, it boded well for their discussion.
Tony was ravenous when he awoke, shuffling into the kitchen he downed two shakes and devoured the fruit and vegetable platter that he was allowed to eat now.  Still hungry he resorted to a bowl of omega meal replacement spooning it down quickly before going in search of his Alphas, really, he only wanted to see Steve so that he could talk to him about his fears regarding Bucky’s mental state.  Bucky’s whispered words had terrified him there was no doubt in his mind that Bucky had meant every word he had said.
“Captain Rogers, my surgery is fully equipped with machines to provide all the sexual stimulation you pet will require to ensure the hormone treatments work.  I will be able to closely monitor the physical changes and adjust treatment accordingly if needed.”
“Ms Potts the Avengers Pack would be honoured to welcome Tony in to our Pack as our Omega.  I can promise you that we will love and cherish him and treat his as the treasure that he is. I understand that Tony will fight and rebel against the restrictions and changes to his life he will face as an omega, but we will guide him and care for him and give him time to adapt.  I would be honoured to take him as my mate, I care for him a great deal and did not initiate a relationship when I thought he was base-line for fear of causing him hurt and pain when the inevitable happened.”
Now if this were to be removed the bone ends would need to be touching for regeneration to take place and the bones would be shorter by that missing bone length.
Lifting Tony’s legs over his shoulders he sank down, balls deep the head of his cock slipping his omega’s hymen releasing a wave of Omega pheromones, the enticing scent triggering his mating rut. Lost in his need to breed his omega he ravaged Tony’s hole, bending him in half to get as deep as he could, to ensure his seed reached his omega’s fertile eggs.
She is also in charge of the soon to be Mrs Happy Hogan’s makeover, Happy only had a couple of stipulations for how his wife should look, Natasha will make all other decisions with regards to her appearance and dress.
The more extreme option is that I inject your pet with a massive dose of hormones, testosterone and pheromones which will immediately stimulate his body in to bringing on either a first heat or a rut within 48 hours, which one depends on your preference for a bitch or a stud dog. Though I am assuming since you have had your pet’s penis docked that you would prefer a bitch, if so then it is just a case of ramping up the Progesterone and Oestrogen and lowering the Testosterone.
“Foul mouthed disobedient omegas need to be disciplined not rewarded with orgasms, you need to learn that my word is law and that if you deviate there will be consequences.  You have had the physical side of your punishment but as a further reminder to obey you now have to face the humiliation of everyone knowing what has happened.
He pushed Betty off his cock, passing her to the Captain and strode into the birthing room.  Gabbing her chin, he forced her to look into his eyes, it was a few minutes before awareness spread across her features and she strained towards him hope radiating from her eyes.  He cupped her jaw and leant down to speak quietly to her as he forced her to look at him as he took in her altered appearance.
The babies became the centre of her world, other than when her alphas wanted to mount her, Raider had fought Brutus and was now the pack leader.  He didn’t allow her out of his sight, he tolerated the pups but made it clear that they were not welcome in the kennels all the time.
He shed tears as he had Friday lock all the suits and drop them down into the underground vault. He knew that Steve was testing him, the suits would have already  been locked away on his disappearance through the portal.  There was no place in this world for an omega superhero now, society acknowledged his part in the defeat of Thanos, but it had been considerably downplayed so that the Alphas Avengers took all the glory.  He didn’t care that much, the main thing was that Thanos was gone.
A moan escaped his lips as he felt his orgasm build as his cock  throbbed under his fingers, suddenly a large hand clamped over his much smaller one squeezing tightly squashing his rising orgasm crushing his cock held by his own hand, pleasure turned to pain as his cock was trapped under the super soldier’s strength.
Omega Stark is severely underweight, his bone density is low which is why he has had such a high number of broken bones.  His immune system is weak making him susceptible to illness, he is anaemic and deficient in many other vitamins and nutrients.  It is amazing how he has managed to survive this long.
As she talked she efficiently removed the soiled diaper, washed his genitals then taped him into a clean diaper.  The cannula port on his arm was then covered with a bandage to keep it secure.
“I think we need to discuss this more Bucky, I don’t want to risk doing more damage, I want to bond fully with you but we need to get professional advice on your situation, Dr Banner is the best person to help as his alter ego is The Hulk,”
“Mr President and my fellow Avengers please make used of my omega’s holes whenever you want today, she is a horny bitch and needs constant fucking so that she does not whine and moan all the time.”
“Exactly Steve, Jarvis along with the rest of the world will believe that this Tony Stark has been hiding his orientation since presentation and is now being integrated into his correct role in our society.
“My skin feels all itchy and my feet hurt, can we go so l can get out of these clothes, l don’t know why it’s different this time, l’ve worn these before down here.”
He skimmed past the explicit video evidence of Tony thoroughly enjoying being knotted by the Captain, the punishment sessions though, he watched and had to readjust his cock a few times.   He knew that he wanted his own omega, but had been stopped by Hulk situation and the gamma radiation in his blood and semen.
Now why don’t you run along and have a shower, then spend some time bonding with Sarah whilst l discuss your progress with your Alpha, l am sure he will be pleased that you are adapting so well.
Steve nodded his agreement and watched the doctor pull down the soften skin of Tony’s perineum with a small weighted metal clamp, leaving it to hang between Tony’s widely spread thighs.  Next, he manipulated the small ball sack until it disappeared into the stretched skin.  When the clamp was finally removed all that was left was a small hole at the root of his omega’s cock.
Tony’s breath stilled as he felt the glide of the razor up the sensitive skin of his throat and round his mouth removing the last trace of his identity as Tony Stark owner of Stark Industries, Chief Engineer of Research and Development, Iron Man and Independent UnBonded Omega.
He had a lot to think about, he was stuck in this universe for who knew how long, maybe forever.  He did not want to be kept in a cell, he needed to breathe fresh air and peruse his research and he could not that if he did not accept certain elements of this society that make him uncomfortable or if he was being honest with himself, deep down stirred his own desires.  Perhaps this was how Tony felt when he first arrived, curious and then gradually accepting, there was no way that he would have ever let the Captain treat him as he did, without consenting or enjoying it, perhaps his suppressed omega instincts flourished in this environment.  He had read studies and research previously that confirmed that the instinctive behaviours of alphas and omegas was weakening due to the changes in roles in society. The imperative to mate and follow the traditional dominant/submissive relationship was being suppressed  due to the perceived inequality that those not of that orientation argued it to be.
“Tony, just think how proud your father would be of you, bonding with Captain America, you wouldn’t want to disappoint him hmmmm?  Did you know that during the war he used to say he would gladly approve of a bond between any omega child of his and Captain America.”
“Anthony Edward Stark, will you accept me as your Alpha, will you be my Bonded and Mated Omega, will you give your promise to abide by my rules and live your life as my Omega?”
“Omega, you will suckle from these bottles until I decide that you can be trusted to drink on your own and not steal forbidden drinks or food.  Your behaviour just confirms for me that omegas are not responsible enough to make good life decisions or care for themselves properly without the guidance of an Alpha.  Now you will drink this immediately without any fuss or your backside will be turning an even darker shade of red.”
I want omega Stark to be working the required hours for SI once his hands have healed, I will expect a minimum of one hour per week personally with the omega for completion of all paperwork relating to SI. The board of directors insist that it be done the traditional way as of now, I have agreed as the last thing I need to be dealing with at this time is an attempted coup from that bunch of antiquated old Alphas.”
“Bad girl Pepper, you will learn to behave and submit as yourself, or you may find Sex Doll making an appearance at the next board meeting.  You are my wife now and due to the papers that you unwittingly signed without reading as Sex Doll, you have handed all your money and holdings over to me and given me authority to act on your behalf on all matters of personal finance, I am also legally responsible for all decisions with regards to any medical treatment I feel that you require and we now have a dual passport that mean you cannot travel out of the country without me or without my permission.
Physically he is is in good condition, his bones have hardened, and his limbs are proportionate to his new height. His low muscle ratio will ensure that he is weaker and will tire easily after physical exertion.  Isee that you have opted to keep him on the slender side with just a soft swell of stomach fat, rather than fatten him up as previously requested.  Our nutritionist will provide you with a diet plan that will maintain he optimum desired weight, it will also ensure that he is receiving the correct level of vitamins and minerals to keep him healthy.
It amused him to her her muffled screams as he pressed her into the mattress, breath play was another thing she would need to adapt to, it would be pleasurable or painful depending on his mood. For now though he wanted her subdued so he waited until his knot caught before he hauled her half unconscious form up onto his lap.  A few slaps to her tits had her gasping and crying, she was much prettier when her face was red and her eyes swollen with tears.
“Look at you such a fucking fat slutty omega, heavy with pups and still panting for it like a bitch in heat.”
Tony tried to hold back a sob but he felt his control slipping tears welled up and flowed down his cheeks, gasping for breath he tried to speak but the words would not form, frustrated he let out a scream then another.  Once started he could not stop, all pent up hurt and anger pouring out.
Tony was lost in a swirling pool of Alpha lust and pheromones breathless and strung out, his whole body screaming for satisfaction. His whining at the loss of Steve’s lips turned to screams as two sets teeth bit down on his shoulders.
Later at Peter's lab. Peter continued to work on his web shooters finally getting them complete he smiles shooting a test blast at a dummy before going over to it and tried to pick it up with no luck the thing was stuck. "Yes! It works! It works!" he cheered taking off the shooter he had to tell Tony about this.
I also want to tell the people who wanted to see the Peter is Natasha's child story it is now out. I worked on it today and this is my second fanfic update today who needs sleep!!!!
Miss Erica was left mouth wide open scared of what to say to THE black widow! After a few seconds Nat walks away "come Clint." ruffling Peter's hair "пока мой маленький паук" Peter waves giving a cough before saying "пока мама паук"
The other students were amazed looking at two more avengers and the two most powerful people in the world. Tony walks up to Miss Erica "Now I understand you've been very abusive to my intern, and let me tell you!" he poked her in the chest "that your lucky that you aren't going to jail! If I see insult or accuse him again I'm going to make sure you don't teach at any school again! At most you'll be working in the fast food industry."
With everything that was said Tony let the students through the door. As everyone walked in the marveled at all the inventions and at how big this lab was compared to the other labs that they saw during the day.
Flash gives a smirk think Natasha was insulting Peter in Russian "Hey Penis! Looks like even the black Widow is calling you out!"
Taking the bag Peter hands the money to Jordie then heads out "cool thanks guys, see you later!" Jordie waves bye "see you at the tower!"
When getting there he saw Jordie setting out a few trays of sweets in the class case. Makayla was coloring at one of the tables, there was the other thing Jordie loved. When she and Bucky got together after the war everyone was glad each of them except Tony who still needed time to get use to Bucky. Now with a joyful little child and another on the way.
Sitting down Peter starts to eat his waffles. Feeling his phone buzz in his pocket he took it out seeing a text from Wade.
Miss Erica came storming up to Peter face full of anger "I can't believe you! I told you that you couldn't come and you just come walking in!" Peter was confused on why his class was here. Wait.. he mentally facepalmed himself of course this would be why it was a surprise!
Flash continues to glare at Peter "That stupid girl thinks that she can humiliate me? I'm going to make her pay!"
Like I said it's not anyone's fault as I know you were just giving your personal opinion about what you thought and everyone is free to do that about my story weather good or bad. All I want to say is goodbye for now to the story and I'll return soon, for what it means for my other stories I'm doing I will continue to try and write some chapters for them to keep my mind clean as writing stories helps me get rid of my bad thoughts.
Once getting up to look at the lower level labs Peter stayed close to Ned and MJ as they walked with Ned fangirling and MJ holding her sketchbook close to draw another face either Flash or Miss Erica could make while here. "Dude this is so awesome! I can't believe you don't need a pass to enter."
Peter gives a small smile before getting a light punch on his shoulder "Hey loser." he turns seeing MJ and ned "so has the tour been as terrible as you thought?" Ned questions
When Flash punched again Peter grabbed his arm and flipped Flash to the ground. The room was silent before clapping was heard "yay Petey!" Makayla cheered Tony smiles and does the same "wait to go kid."
A few of the students said as they walked around looking at everything they possibly could. Before getting back together in a group ready to see Mr. Stark's personal intern's lab if it was anything like they just it was going to be great!
I'd like to say thank you guys so much! For the support in my first chapter I'm glad you guys love it, I can't wait to continue to have more chapters for you guys~
"Petey you promise that you'll get better so we can play again soon?" the little girl asks. Peter nods "I promise Makayla don't worry." he rubs her head making her giggle "Yay!" she hugs him and kisses his cheek "feel better soon Petey."
Nat walks up to Miss Erica with a pissed off face "I heard what you said to Peter and if you dare to say anything else to him for something he didn't do. I'm going to knock all the teeth you have out of your mouth and leave you a bleeding mess!" she threatens
"Doing okay.. I've been sick most of the day and harassed by Flash and miss Erica but dad took care of it. So did everyone else actually... umm why is everyone down here?"
Nat: little spider! Clint saw what happened to you in the laboratories, can you point out that Flash, baby?
The small boy just looked down not wanting to make eye contact with said bully, he knew Flash would use his dead name to make him feel worse. Peter sighed and took his things "I do have a internship flash, now please move out of my way so I can leave." he says calmly
"They will come down soon Miss Mertz. They've just been very busy with Miss Potts about the agreement to have some vibranium in a suite that Mr. Stark wants."
"yeah made a batch just for you sweetie." she hands him a bag with a dozen cookies in it. "Bucky helped me out with them, so did Shadow." The eyes around Jordie's neck blink sliding out to see Peter "
Turns out both bully and teacher were escorted outside to the bus and wait for the students to come out. While both were put on the banned list of Stark industries if either dared to come back to berate more about Peter or have a job as a intern.
Once the elevator door opened there were already a few avengers there. On the couch was Bucky and Steve playing Mario kart, Jordie was in the kitchen baking cookies while Shadow kept sneaking chocolate, and Natasha and Clint were having a arm wrestle.
Flash laughs in the back "enjoying it while you can Penis? This is probably the only time you've been close to the avengers."
Olivia scowls at Erica "Okay then why don't we just test it out. Peter honey why don't you come up and show everyone." Gulping Peter shakenly walks up to the scanner and puts his finger up to it.
Shuri gets about done with the bandages "there you go fiancé all better." she smirks putting the left over bandages on the medical cart next to her.
"I'll have Ned get pictures for me." Peter smirks holding up his phone, MJ chuckles "you two are made for each other."
C. Peter's class has Lunch before going to the training area or Peter's lab, and Flash does something worse to Peter that really gets the avengers wanting to murder him more. If who give suggestions. I personally think either Tony, Steve, Nat, or Wade
Finishing the cookie that was in his mouth "Miss Erica I swear that Mr. Harrington didn't tell me. I didn't even go to school today because I'm sick." Miss Erica put a finger in front of this face "I don't want to here anymore lies Peter." She sighs "I can't believe this.. Since I can't get you back to school I want you to wait down here in the lobby while everyone else has the tour."
Everyone looked over smiling seeing Peter "Peter!" everyone called. Giving a small smile and a wave as he walks through Peter replies "Hi guys."
He picks up Makayla and holds Morgan's hand walking back to the group. Once miss Erica saw she was fuming mad "MR. PARKER! I can't believe you! You have gone to far this time! Who's kids are these?! I swear you are going to get kicked out of school and sent to jail." she screams
Meanwhile Tony was leading the group of students to his and Peter's labs. "Okay everyone last stop on the tour. I'm taking you guys to my lab along with my personal intern's as well, just don't touch anything and no pictures."
"Petey!" Makayla calls running up to him hugging his legs "Are you here to play with me?" she asks . Peter picks her up "sorry Makayla, I'm still a little sick. See I have this mask on so it won't spread."
"What was the first clue?" Peter asks raising his head from resting in his arms. His face looking pale except for his nose, cheeks, and ears being red. Ned puts a hand on Peter's forehead "Peter your burning up! You need to go to the nurse's office so your dad can pick you up!" he whispered shouted not wanting to case a scene in class.
Back with Peter and his class they made it to the middle lab section where the scientists work on cures for the world like how to turn dirty water to clean, global warming, food shortages everything like that.
Tony chuckles "Yeah Pete you're my kid now. Though don't tell anyone about me being nice I have a reputation you know." he smirks, Peter couldn't help but let out a laugh "I won't dad. You're the best!"
"It was pretty obvious Peter, I mean who doesn't stand up to people like Flash and Erica for the safety of their kid."
"Okay everyone this is where some of our scientists help make inventions to help different places in the world that are going through a tough time right now." Olivia explained in the simple version of it. "Please don't take any pictures while we're here." a student raised their hand "Yes?" Olivia asked
Peter smiles and walks MJ over all the heroes and they start to get some pictures and autographs. Now for those wondering about Flash and Erica when taking pictures and autographs with the avengers.
Peter looked up from the book he was reading for the class as the teacher continued "In two weeks we're going on a field trip!" the class cheered with excitement clapping happily. Cindy raised her hand asking "Where will we be going?"
Nat wraps an arm around Peter "How about me and Shadow come down in make them believe you." Shadow pokes her head out of Jordie's body "
Before feeling pain against his face. Flash punched him giving him a black eye before letting go of his jacket dropping on the ground Peter started to cough as tears started to fall down his face, Flash spit on him "that's just your warning Penny. Stupid girl" before getting back to the group.
Makayla sees what Morgan is doing and stands up for her favorite cousin to "yeah and my mommy has the power to eat you! My daddy can even throw you out of here!"
Jordie stands up "I'll answer that, I'm the translator for Clint when we have field trips here if anyone asks him questions. Though he can read lips so he'll know what you say I'm just going to translate what he says to you guys." she smiles.
"Thompson for this action and multiple accounts of bullying today caused by you! You are banned from this tower, don't even try to think of getting an internship here!" he yells
"Apperantly waiting for the author to hurry with the sixth chapter so I can finally see my baby boy."
Makayla scared wraps herself around Peter. "Well, the one holding my hand is Morgan Stark Mr. Stark's daughter." and Peter wasn't lying Morgan was his Dad's pseudo daughter until he announces that he's married to Captain America and that Peter is now his son.
Flash quickly grabs Peter having him in a headlock with the upper hand. But Peter using a bit of his super strength pulls Flash off of him throwing him down on the mat "Flash I don't want to hurt you."
Hi everyone. As you can tell by the title I'm deciding to take a break from the story for awhile I don't know when I'll be back, but for now I just need to get my thoughts together.
Peter jumps a bit at the mention of Shadow eating someone "N-no thank you to both. Just tell me when Mr. Stark- Dad comes up." He gets out from under Nat's arm going to his room to do his homework for the night.
When everyone was free to look around a bit before going to the museum on the next floor. Peter check his phone seeing text messages from Wade saying how much he can't wait to see his adorable boyfriend making him smile.
baby boy: I'd liked that a lot honey, because I can't go on a field trip today at school. Having a visit from you would be amazing!
They hug for a quick second before pulling apart. Tony gets off the bed and starts heading back out "Make sure to come down for dinner soon. Also don't forget to take your binder off before bed remember the last time."
"Good for you. Now go on the other side of the mat." Tony points to the opposite side of the mat to get flash out of his sight faster "yes Mr. Stark." Flash replies going over to that side while Peter goes on the other.
A. Peter's class goes to his lab meeting Shuri and Wade along with another OC I put into the story for my friend
Tony puts a hand on Peter's shoulder "don't worry bud if he tries anything we're going to kick him out along with the bitchy teacher." he whispers to him having giving Peter a hopeful smile.
Peter blushes lightly "With me and Wade he's my boyfriend. I'd think it be cool if both my friends and boyfriend get to hang out with each other."
B. Peter's class go to the training area meeting the other avengers along with Nat and Clint, where Flash gets what he deserves.
Everyone started to step back as Miss Erica's legs were getting wet. She literally just pissed on herself! "I'm not the one you should be apologizing to." he growled
Once getting home Peter was sent straight to bed to rest. Pepper takes the thermometer out of his mouth "hmm 101 degrees. Your sick alright sweetie, it should go down by tomorrow if you rest for today I'll have Clint make you some soup to have later. Just sleep for now." she kisses him on his forehead Peter smiles "thank you aunt Pepper." as she left the room.
Now the moment everyone was dreading was sparing with a classmate. Tony looked at Peter "hey Pete why don't you come down?" gulping Peter walked down the bleachers to where the avengers were "Would anyone like to have a spar with my intern?" instantly Flash's hand went in the air Peter was shaking at this point "great just great..." he mumbled to himself.
Once he got himself together Peter headed back towards the group this time staying close to Ned and MJ if Flash were to come close again. "Hey loser- woah what the hell happened to your eye?" MJ said in a worried but still chill tone.
"Don't worry everyone it's alright that's Mr. Stark's AI Friday, she's the security for the entire tower. Now with the ID settled let's continue shall we."
"Seems like you're the only one begging for attention Flash, saying you like penis' so much." MJ smirks. Flash rolled his eyes backing off as they continued to look around.
With that everyone went off to look at the different scientists through the class working on their projects. While Peter hears crying with his super hearing following it to find Makayla crying while Morgan is holding her hand comforting her.
Nat sighs in defeat but gives a small smirk "Кей, но мы говорим Тони. Я сейчас пойду, покажу учителю часть моего разума." she kisses his cheek.
She gives a wicked smile to him "good." then proceeds with the rest of the class the tour guide now coming out to greet them. "Hello! You guys must be Midtown, welcome to Stark Industries my name is Olivia Joyce and I'll be your tour guide today as the other tour guide seemed to catch a cold this week." Peter looked up when she said her name thank god it was Olivia maybe she could clear this up.
At one point Steve had to intervene when Tony really wanted to name her Talon and remind his lover that they were trying to keep their child from hating them.
While Steve was slightly disappointed at not being able to remove Tony’s last vestiges of clothing with his own two hands (or maybe someplace more interesting? A mouth maybe? Oh Steve would have to try that next time), he most definitely appreciated the sight. The ex-playboy’s smirk only grew as he looked down at his lover.
Steve gave him a strange look. It seemed like a mix of pity on confusion. Steve opened his mouth to say something, but was interrupted from a barrage of sound.
Tony reached down and grabbed a fleece blanket from the trunk before closing it firmly. He reached over and pulled Steve with him by the hand. Tony slowly sprawled down on the furs, dragging Steve down with him and skillfully maneuvered them so that Steve was curled against Tony’s back, arm draped over him, and both of them snugly covered in the warm blanked.
Tony’s fingers encounter one of the cold strands of metal in the rope, drawing his attention back to his present situation. The rope was made from material that Thor had somehow managed to smuggle out of Tony’s city, which was as close to home as Tony had gotten in over two years. It was comprised of two large thick cords of vibrant red material with several thin lines of gold woven through it and a single, vibrant blue string that twisted playfully through the other two colors. His fingers followed the path of the blue cord as he spun the rope around in his hand.
Steve was shaking. He didn’t know how Tony had managed this long without completely falling apart. If he had to experience what the younger man had just described over and over again, he would have fallen apart long before now. And he knew that the images Tony was painting for him were nothing compared to what he actually experienced every night. He could imagine himself in Tony’s place and could only conclude that he would have spent every night clutching his partner’s dead body desperately and calling out to him over and over. And the little ones, his babies. The mere notion of clutching the lifeless forms of his infant daughter and young son was soul shattering. That was the moment Steve realized for certain that Tony was infinitely stronger than he ever would be.
Pepper nodded sternly. Tony looked away, a flush finding its way on his cheeks. There was no need for this, he was only doing what needed to be done.
Thor was right behind him. His arms flung up in the air, alternating between snatching movements and what looked like attempts to catch Peter should he suddenly fall. The toddler and the god quickly made their way through the entrance hall and into the living room.
Another yell of “Kitty” came from the hall leading to the throne room and was soon followed by an exuberant two year old with light blond hair tied up in pigtails and a pair of gray blue eyes. The sight immediately brought a bright smile to the young King’s face.
An uncomfortable warmth flooded Tony’s chest at those words, but he pushed it down. This affection… this was dangerous. Tony needed to be more sure of this man and his own circumstances here before he could be sure if he should indulge in it or bury it.
Steve delicately took his daughter from King T’Challa before clutching her tightly to his strong chest, his face the very definition of paternal anxiety.
“You.” Tony said softly. Almost as if he was afraid speaking it aloud would make it true. “You and our kids. You obviously tried to protect them, but they’re still covered in….” Tony sucked in a sharp breath. Unable to bring himself to finish his sentence, but it wasn't necessary. Steve had gotten the message loud and clear. His blood froze at the mere thought of his children, his babies, dead. Dead on some unknown battlefield somewhere where Steve himself is unable to protect them.
Tony’s hands reached out and he lifted the goblet. He turned back to Steven and offered it to his husband.
"Go on. Have fun. The little runt and I will lay siege to the neighbors while you're gone." Stated Thor proudly.
Tony read the next chapter of the story trying his best to soak in the moment. Peter would be turning 9 in a matter of months. Soon he would be too old to tolerate his dad reading him stories every night before bed.
Steve chuckled and smiled at the exchange. The two of them were adorable and he just couldn't seem to bring himself to put the baby down, though he knew he had to in order to make sure that the baby was unharmed and warm.
The party rode up along a stone path that was slowly forming out of the grassy valley and through the gap in a short stone wall that served as a border marker. As they made their way through the fields, farmers and shepherds stopped their work to cheer as they passed. Soon countless people were lining the road. When they passed the first of the houses, the cheers became thunderous and the air became filled with flower petals being thrown by the people. They created a cascade of kaleidoscope colors that rained down on them. Tony smiled at the obvious joy and pride Steve’s people had for him and turned to look at the man in question only to find Steve already looking at him.
Tony's face lit up like a five year old who had just been told he was getting a puppy. It was that moment that Steve realized he had just accidentally given Tony exactly what he wanted.
Steve and Tony stood in the entrance hall of their Malibu home, dressed for a night out at one of the nicer restaurants in the city. This was their first date night since they adopted Peter nearly a year ago.
Once the boy had left, Steve turned to back to Tony the mask melting off as if it had never been there. “I’m sorry, but it seems I need to go. Your trunks should be delivered shortly. Please take any space you need. I want you to feel at home here. Should you require anything while I’m gone simply ask one of the servants to take you to my mother. She would be happy to get to know you further.”
