Sherlock rubs at his shin and pushes the coffee table roughly askew with his foot, sending papers and mail sliding to the floor. He moves towards the kitchen, but without any of his usual precision, clipping the edge of the door on the way in.
As soon as they are free of the kitchen and related hazards, John turns sharply, earning an exclamation from Sherlock that quickly turns filthy as John presses him tight to the wall, sheet tangled round and round John’s arms and Sherlock’s thighs and essentially failing at its job in the first place.
John knows Sherlock is watching him move around the kitchen, and out of the corner of his eye he catches Sherlock trying to take a step forward, only to latch onto the door frame again.
A flash of white catches his eye and he freezes, momentarily panicked at not remembering the trip home.
miserable, staring at his own feet like they’ve betrayed him and one hand twisted tightly into his hair. John knows he hates this bit, realizing how out of sorts he is, how dirty. The inevitable scratch and pull of the wrong clothes, the tight knots in his hair, the ache and pain of things he can’t remember and time he’s lost.  His mind comes back online before his body does, the weakness of transport, leaving Sherlock trapped as surely as if he were bound.
Sherlock’s hair slicked back in dark waves makes his face ever sharper than usual, something unearthly and dangerous about him. Through the pale lens of the water, he seems like a fae creature, a Kelpie luring John to follow beneath the surface.
“Of course I knew. It’s quite literally my job - to distract people from their hungers with new hungers. I’m telling you he’s fine, the method of intake isn’t any more triggering than getting a vaccine.”
John reaches out, his reflexes always better than anyone ever assumes, even Sherlock, who he grabs tightly by the jaw, tilting his head back slightly. Sherlock swallows under his touch, but does not pull away, his flint eyes screaming of challenge.
Sherlock jerks suddenly, must have drifted off, and scrambles at the floor, the edge of the table, a chair, to pull himself back upright, too quickly by the sick look on his face. He pulls himself through the flat by every available surface, knocking several stacks of papers and assorted objects to the floor in the process.
The silence is broken by an ear splitting scream and the unmistakable sound of a fist meeting a mirror (John knows, he still has those scars across his knuckles.)
John feels gently around the matted sections of Sherlock’s hair, trying to get a feel for how to tackle them. It brings a sick rush to his stomach to see them, a reminder of everything that led to them in this glass and blood and water strew bathroom, ghosts between them and guilt heavy in the steamy air.
Sherlock, if possible, moves even closer. John has to look up at him now, but strangely Sherlock is the one who looks small and unsure.
For a brief, shining moment, John sees as Sherlock does. Sherlock’s pupils blown wide, the race of his pulse in his neck, the way his tongue darts out to touch his lip when John pulls back, the fine tremble of Sherlock’s hand.
John pushes closer, sliding his fingers higher to frame where their hard lengths are pressed side by side through so little fabric, their sharp inhale almost simultaneous. Glass tinkles under his slippered feet but the view of the floor is interrupted by the sight of Sherlock’s cock, indecently outlined through that thin bedsheet, a sheer patch of pre-cum already spreading from the head. The denim length of John is pressed in tight next to him, a little shorter but leaning toward girth, testing the sharp edges of his zipper.
John combs the conditioner through Sherlock’s hair, working gently. The line of Sherlock’s shoulder is tight but he is quiet, his fists clenching and unclenching along the plane of his thighs.  It can’t hurt, John is being unbelievably careful not to pull from the skin, but it’s still probably a lot of stimulation for Sherlock, coming in when his mind is least guarded.
He doesn’t realize his hands are still cradling Sherlock’s face, caught in his daydream, until he notices Sherlock watching him carefully in return, a sparkle of curiosity that shows he’s coming back to himself.
“No,” Sherlock bites out sharply, then again, softer this time. “No. It's not...like that with her.”
Sherlock looks to her, looks at John, looks at his tea, John again, and says, “nothing.” An uncharacteristic display of self-preservation.
It occurs to him, rather too late, that he might be more buzzed than he initially realized. She looks him over with an intensity that would put Sherlock to shame and huffs loudly.
Sherlock is...peculiar, about him having his phone on him. John might call it worry in anyone else, but with Sherlock it usually bubbles quickly  over into frustrated and exasperated, the wires of his emotions all crossed and tangled like earbuds in a pocket.
John is loath to suggest cutting his hair, he’d never admit it but he loves Sherlock’s hair almost as much as Sherlock does. There is something that wouldn’t be quite right about him without that mop of dark curls, somehow softening the edges of him and hardening the sea foam green of his eyes all at once. A simple twist of his face, tilting those curls one way or the other, can turn Sherlock almost into entirely different people.
When Sherlock falls head first into his vice of choice, how can John blame him? Bubbling at the bottom of his own bottle? He’s proud of the progress they’ve made in the last year: for Rosie, for Mary, but never for themselves.
Sherlock looks around the room, eyes narrowed, for approximately 2 entire minutes before he suddenly turns back to John and says, “What?”
“Well,” Irene shrugs, parroting him mockingly. She tilts her head, assessing, and takes another photo from a new angle. “I told you, you might not want to come in. I’d offer to let you join us, but somehow I don’t think you’d appreciate it the same way.”
“Don’t be an idiot, John. Despite what you and Mycroft assume, I am not and never have been some blushing virgin.” He spits the words with all the venom the mention of Mycroft’s name has ever brought up in him.
John closes his mouth with a click, turning on his heel to ascend the stairs to his bedroom, grab his phone, and flee the flat without so much as a word or second look.
“We’re adults,” John says, taking a step back and pulling in several deep breaths. “Either we can talk about this like adults, or we pretend it never happened.”
Indeed, Sherlock looks closer to skeleton than drowning victim, every dip of him shadowed deeply, his eyes deep set and ringed with exhaustion. He’s shivering in fits and starts and the doctor in John already starts racking up symptoms and ailments.
He finally lets them both give in, sinking his mouth down over Sherlock's cock and testing the edges of his old skills as Sherlock swears in more languages than he can follow.
“And, you didn’t expect you’d like it so much?” And, maybe you overestimated your ability to suppress emotions? An ability, by the way, I still have no idea why you are so bloody proud of.”
Sherlock moves like a bloody cat when he wants too which is how he somehow manages to get out of his chair and wrap his long fingers over the top of John’s paper without a sound, startling John terribly when he pushes it down out of the way.
John carefully lifts the newspaper until it covers his blushing face, effectively blocking the vision of Sherlock’s disheveled grace behind paper and print.
“Stop, Sherlock, stop!” John repeats, catching Sherlock by the wrists. Sherlock’s feet slip from under him again and John just barely manages to drag him back onto the toilet lid.
“Yes, of course, always.” Sherlock replies dryly, turning on the spot like he’s looking for something.
Before he can step back and regain his footing, Sherlock is crowded in his space, looming over John. How he manages to loom so in nothing but a towel and looking like soggy toast, John may never know, but loom Sherlock does.
Sherlock mutters something that John can’t understand and he leans close, pressing his mouth to the skin of Sherlock’s shoulder blade in tease as he speaks.
“Anything that might kill us?” he asks, relatively unconcerned. Something dark and pleased stirs in John at the thought that this, being in John's arms and kissing him again and again and
“Your tea is on the table,” John replies, settling into his armchair with his own cup and sighing in relief.
A flash of lightning too far to bring thunder but close enough to light the room makes them both jump, momentarily freeze framing every filthy, sordid detail of the moment. For a hearbeat, Sherlock is lit in a blue tinge, cool and perfect and cut from the finest marble, before the heat of him steals back into John’s skin like a brand at every point they touch.
“You’re a little quiet,” John asks, suddenly a bit anxious, “I expected more deducing, facts, something. Everything okay?”
John sets himself to exploring the entire geography of Sherlock’s neck and the landscape of his collarbones, hand pressed wide over Sherlock’s lower stomach, carefully noting each sound and squirm and gasp he is rewarded with through touch and sound. He’s not sure how long has passed when Sherlock tugs on his hair impatiently.
“Wait you tur-” John starts to say and trails off incoherently when Sherlock dips his fingers beneath his waistband to brush the head of his cock, watching John like he’s a bubbling experiment.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, “it was for a case John, I’m not lying. She was the logical choice for the data I needed. I let her have her fun, I was able to get my data. If you are trying to ask why I didn’t ask you? Well, I’m sorry, apparently I missed that you were secretly a trained dominant in your spare time and I don’t believe either of us was expecting this particular turn of events tonight.”
“I wouldn’t do it when Mrs. Hudson is around. Trust me John, I’m even more horrified by the prospect of that conversation than you are.”
Sherlock looks ...debauched. There is no other word for it. His shirt is open three buttons deep, jacket missing, bare feet flexing, and he’s blushed from his ears into the shadows of his clothes.
Sherlock curls into the back of the couch as John covers him with the throw, still muttering to himself, and John considers him safe for the moment. John stomps past Irene into the kitchen, knowing she will follow.
“Up, up.” Sherlock growls, shoving at him. John stumbles back off the bed, laughing when Sherlock drops to his knees, aggressively reaching for John’s pants and nearly sending them both to the floor. John has to grab Sherlock by the shoulders and Sherlock has him by the belt loops and they both stare for a moment until balance returns to the world.
On another day, in another place, John would relive the words ,”I’m sorry apparently I missed…” coming from Sherlock’s mouth for the rest of his natural life. It does at least cause a grin to break through the simmering anger he’s been wallowing in since this whole thing started.
“It’s hot in my room and we aren’t going anywhere and Mrs. Hudson is out this morning.” Sherlock snaps.
John has been quietly sinking beneath it for days and weeks, all his skills and senses dull and grey around the edges. Even knowing it’s happening didn’t mean he could stop it, retreating into the shadows of the flat and his own mind. Sherlock had taken to leaving him behind again, something he hadn’t done since he’d come back, but John didn’t have the energy for the chase. Molly, sharper than any of them have ever given her credit for, offers to take Rosie for the week without prompting, her eyes round and knowing.
There is a fine line between self-awareness and self-hatred and Sherlock’s always meanered back and forth over it.  While John may wish now and again that Sherlock employed a fraction of his brain to attempting to be a marginally more thoughtful human, all in all he wouldn’t change one molecule of Sherlock Holmes. If quicksilver eyes and that secret crooked smile costs him toes in the crisper drawer, any pain he’s ever endured, and whatever madcap chase Sherlock will send them on next, then John would gladly pay an eternity over.
“An innuendo, “John laughs, “come on, trust me. It’s just a few steps, I promise I won’t throw you on your bed and ravish you like a heroine in a bad romance novel. I’ll put you down in the hall.”
“But Sherlock?” She says his name with a sound not unlike the text alert on Sherlock’s phone. “My god, he
Sherlock’s eyes slide from his hands to John’s face, to the cup, and back around again in a circle. He looks wary but hopeful. For all that he complains, he does enjoy being taken care of where it counts. Mrs. Hudson is proof of that.
They sit in silence for some time, only the rustle of John’s newspaper and Sherlock’s labored breathing to break it. Out of the corner of his eye, John catches Sherlock making several attempts to walk away from the door frame and failing each time, only upright by the grace of solid wood and his seemingly superhuman reflexes, still above average even high as a kite.
“You first, I don’t want to be distracted.” Sherlock leans up to whisper, dragging teeth over John’s ear and making his hips jerk in Sherlock’s lap.
Irene has some of that sparkle back, a wickedness playing about her that he’d last seen while she was wrapped in that same coat, perched in a window with all of London's sky framing her smile.
“I don’t know what’s so bloody amusing John,” Sherlock mutters, but his tone only makes it all the funnier.
The silence picks up where it left off. John’s tea has gone cold. Sherlock does actually smell quite bad and it’s starting to make itself known throughout the room. John is more tempted than he’d like to admit to pour the cold tea over Sherlock’s head.
Desperate times call for desperate measures and despite the fact that he probably looks like one of Sherlock’s homeless network, he goes to check if Mrs. Hudson has some coffee cake left. He could smell it last night and she usually brings thems some anyway but, disappointingly, there is no answer at her door.
The kiss is a lightning strike, Sherlock barely holding on to his sheet with one hand and crushing John’s paper between them with the other, one leg slid into John’s chair and against his hip to get closer. John’s hands, still clutched on the ruined paper, brush against the skin of Sherlock’s stomach, feeling the sharp draw of breath each time they connect.
Sherlock regains composure first, suddenly straightening, a cool look on his face like he’s daring John to mention anything is out of the ordinary.
Sherlock is more adept at kissing than John anticipated, but he still kisses like an experiment, like he’s taking apart and examining each element of John and putting it back together in new ways.
But John is only half listening, focused on licking the taste of himself from Sherlock’s mouth, tongue and lips rasping over Sherlock’s barely-there stubble to chase anything he’s missed. Sherlock is boneless, his head lolling and a wicked, pleased smile pulling at the corner of his mouth as he stretches in John’s arms.
Sherlock waves a hand vaguely, sorting through a stack of loose papers precariously left on the corner of the table with the other. “Sexuality, our relationship, your friends, my sexuality. It’s all written on your face.”
It only occurs to him after that whoever is in there could be armed and shoot through the door, but it’s too late for that now.
John also knows that he’s never in a state to take care of himself, inevitably collapsing on the floor, usually the bathroom. Once Sherlock has realized he’s gross, he won’t soil the couch or his own bed, though John’s chair seems fair game when John isn’t occupying it.
John shifts minutely, relishing the bruishing dig of Sherlock’s fingers into the tender inside of his thighs. Sherlock can’t take him deep, practice of a sort John looks forward to teaching him by demonstration; but, he makes up for it in enthusiasm. He pulls back, sucking in greedy lungfuls of air, strings of saliva stretching between them.
“The sheet is a nice look for you, Sherlock,” John says, falling still. “You know, you can wear your pants around the flat if you like, I don’t care. Mrs. Hudson might but, then again, she might enjoy it.”
Sherlock’s eyes roam over his face, still a little foggier than usual, but collecting data nonetheless. His grip finally slackens, John sliding from his grasp but not losing an inch of that ready-to-bolt tension about him.
Sherlock tries for dark and mysterious, but there is a breathy pitch to the end of his declaration that John isn’t ready to prod at yet.
She doesn’t wait for a reply and indeed, John doesn’t have one. She pulls Sherlock’s coat tight around her once more, pocketing the riding crop. “I’ll just see myself out then, shall I?”
When John turns around from bolting the front door behind him, almost an obsession now since Mrs. Hudson was attacked, it’s to find said landlady hovering by the banister looking immensely disapproving.
“Well you could have taken him with you!” She waves vaguely up the steps, “I’ve no idea what he’s doing up there, banging around and talking to himself all night. He’s driving me around the bend!”
“That’s what I’m trying to tell you Sherlock. This is a lot more than that, for me. It means something.”
John collapses onto the edge of the bed and Sherlock strips him of the last of his clothes aggressively, sinking to his knees between John’s legs to mirror their position from earlier.
John sobers for a moment, caught in the sudden intimacy of the moment. Sherlock is touchably close and impossibly far, droplets of water chasing all the sharp lines of him and bleeding envy into John’s veins.
He peeks around the kitchen door and, sure enough, Sherlock is sprawled across the couch. His face is turned into the cushions, wrapped in nothing but a bed sheet that is also pulled up over his face, his long, bare legs poking out one end and his hair poking out the other.
Sherlock’s hot breath is creating a damp patch in John’s jeans that feels like torture and tease all at once. He makes the mistake of looking down just as Sherlock tilts his gaze up, his mouth and cheek pressed to the shadow of John’s straining erection and looking utterly pleased with himself.
Tragically, they’ve nothing in but some molding cheese and a white butcher paper package John doesn’t have the courage to open.
“Is that what you wanted then Sherlock? Sex? You were going to sleep with Irene before I showed up?”
John rubs at his face. “I was just out with Stamford for a few pints. You know I can’t take him, he gets bored and Sherlock bored gets me banned from pubs. Why didn’t you just tell him to shut it?”
John waits patiently until Sherlock’s head rolls back around to look at him, looking cross that John has stopped moving. John is leaning deeply into Sherlock, one hand pressing into the tabletop next to Sherlock’s hip and one arm wrapped around Sherlock’s back tightly, pulling him impossibly closer. He finds he has no ability to control the no doubt shit-eating grin he can feel pulling at his face but it’s worth it when Sherlock smiles tentatively back, running curious fingers over John’s shoulders and arms.
John lunges for Sherlock, Irene neatly stepping out of the way, and grabs him by the face. One of his cheekbones is just starting to swell and purple, and there is a massive livid bruise peeking out of his gaping shirt collar, ringed in teeth marks and a hint of red lipstick.
John slams into Sherlock, who only just manages to keep his footing, rocking back on his heels, while John pins the sheet precariously to Sherlock’s hip with both hands. It takes a moment for John to fully understand the predicament he’s in.
John wants to sit in the path of the fan but isn’t willing to drag a chair and wake Sherlock. He hesitates only a moment and then walks carefully across the room, dropping a pillow beneath him as he sinks to the floor in front of the couch, setting his laptop on the coffee table in front of him. He can just hear Sherlock’s stuffy-nosed snore wheezing into the couch cushions over his shoulder and the fan is a comforting breeze over both of them. John immediately feels better.
The soldier in John seems to run his body for the next few minutes. Once it seems like Sherlock is likely to stay still, John moves to turn off the tap, the water dangerously close to spilling over, and fetches a broom. He sweeps the shards of glass on the floor into a pile, and sets about trying to corral the rest into the sink. He’s just assessing if any more pieces are likely to fall from the wall when Sherlock finally speaks.
There is no beginning or end to the kiss, it suddenly just is like it was there all along, the quiet snap of the last tumblr in a lock giving way. Sherlock’s mouth is chapped and bitten, a hint of copper taste between them. The angle is a little off, wet and sliding, and John doesn’t give one bloody fuck, pouring himself into kissing away all the logic and efficiency of Sherlock’s mind. Sherlock’s usually crisp moves,
“Now hang on,” John says, following him, feeling a little angry himself now. “Tedious? Talking to me is tedious?”
Sherlock scoffs, tucking the towel around his waist while John drapes another over his head, scrunching water from his hair.
What happens next starts out as a kiss, pressed to the pulse in John’s wrist, Sherlock holding John’s arm in two reverent hands. John watches, frozen, as Sherlock opens his lips slightly, pantly warmly against the sensitive skin of the inside of John's arm, and proceeds to drag the hot line of his mouth up John’s wrist and over the sensitive base of his thumb. John’s thumb twitches against Sherlock’s lips and Sherlock’s tongue darts out to meet it.
Sherlock hums, but doesn’t open his eyes. “It was a smaller dose, she wasn’t trying to incapacitate me like last time.” He sounds a little clearer now, but there is still a softness to the edges of his words that belies his current state.
In a burst of movement, Sherlock kicks his way free of the throw, stands too quickly, and sways, crashing his shin into the coffee table and swearing elegantly in several languages.
Sherlock doesn’t move from his white knuckle grip on the doorframe. “Are you sure you don’t want to call Molly?” he asks in a mocking voice, ignoring John’s question.
“And yes, I’m clean in all senses of the word, bar whatever it is Adler so loves stabbing people with, harmless anyway. In case my being a filthy addict is worrying you.” Sherlock snaps at the exact same time John says--
Sherlock pulls off with a pop and works John’s length with every centimeter of those musician’s fingers.
Every other time there was no time to take care of Sherlock. Sherlock never let anyone take care of him anyway. They blew through it with all the whirlwind of gore and grace that is their lives.
John pins Sherlock to the wall with hips and one arm tight under his arse and uses the other to drift fingers at the edges of fine, dark hair stretching down Sherlock’s stomach and beneath the sheet, his fingers just brushing the velvety soft head of Sherlock’s cock.
“I’m sorry Sherlock,” John says, still smiling but finally in control of his laughter, handing Sherlock a towel.
John ignores him. The door isn’t locked, it never is, so apparently Sherlock is beyond operating a doorknob at the moment, a clear and interesting indicator of his current mental state. John turns the handle and shoves the door open in one swift move so that Sherlock sprawls back into 221B, his head thumping onto the wooden floor with enough force that John knows he’ll have a bruise.
John’s brain takes a moment to catch up. “Uh…” he says, feeling like a child under her frowning gaze, “...out.”
He lets John work in silence, carefully pouring water over his hair, blocking it from running down his face. Sherlock’s favorite shampoo is all mint and eucalyptus, expensive, and John works it into a silky lather.
John doesn't try to muffle his moans in reply that creep up his throat as he sets about cleaning Sherlock’s skin with his mouth.
John pulls himself up so he’s laying on the pillow next to Sherlock, sneaking a hand up over his waist and pulling him in closer.
Sure enough, there are muttered voices. Two, unless his ears are failing him, but they are too quiet to make out the words. There is a sharp
Sherlock’s lips pull into a smile against the skin of his palm, drawing John’s hand to cradle, pressing John’s hand to the plane of his face with his own.
The case last night hadn’t wrapped up until just before sunrise after 3 grueling days of stakeouts and foot chases, both of them stumbling into a flat lit only by pink-tinged dawn light. John had slept most of the morning and into the afternoon, still in his jeans, reliving the whole ordeal in a haze of blurred fever dreams. Indeed, he’s not even sure he fully remembers how he got into bed, half feeling like he was dreaming from the moment his adrenaline dropped during the cab ride home.
The flat sinks into syrupy late afternoon sunlight as John works and Sherlock dozes, the thick heat cresting. John isn’t sure how much time has passed when Sherlock finally shifts, groaning into the pillow.
If asked about it later, John could never tell you exactly what happened next. He doesn’t know who leaned in first, he doesn’t know who knocks Sherlock’s cup of tea from the counter with a crash, he doesn’t know who grabbed who first.
“Calm down,” John manages to say, half breathless and half laughing, too amused and delighted to think clearly about the fear and uncertainty tangled at the bottom of this particular barrel of monkeys.
and gestures vaguely across the sweep of the room which John takes to mean the average every day bustle of life Sherlock doesn’t consider himself part of. “Do you really think I’ve never had sex with someone for a case? Then there was that memorable year Mycroft cut me off, and you know how addicts are.”
Sherlock collapses inward, quiet and still. John has to pause for a moment, his breath heaving in his chest and adrenaline galloping in his veins.
John is brushing his teeth in the bathroom and debating the merits of sticking his head under the tap when he hears Sherlock stumbling from his room and down the hall, clipping every available surface on the way by the sound of it. John peeks out just as Sherlock turns the corner into the sitting room, catching a flash of cream which nearly makes him drop his toothbrush.
“John,” Sherlock says into the skin of his temple, both of them reduced to simply hanging on to each other like survivors in a storm.
Sherlock tilts his head coyly, smiling up at John from under his lashes, looking damp and mischievous. John can’t help the smile that jumps to his face in reply.
“It’s going to be me,” John says quietly, leaning in close. “You’ll have one file in that drawer, and it’ll have my name on it.”
“I’ve decided,” John suddenly says, almost too loud for the quiet of the room and Sherlock’s skin twitches under his touch.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock whispers into the skin of his temple. John turns in surprise, Sherlock’s mouth dragging across his cheekbone before they both pull back.
Sherlock hurls himself down on the couch cushions in a huff, “well, you seem content to keep spreading it so why should I bother?”
Sherlock shifts in the bath, the soft slap of water against the sides bringing John back to the moment. He returns to his seat at the side of the tub and sets about working almost too much conditioner into Sherlock’s hair, slicking it back to his skull. He feels out each knot with his fingers, pulling and pressing carefully to loosen the knot before he sets the comb to it, working in short pieces from the bottom up and holding in a way that doesn’t tug at Sherlock’s scalp.
They kiss now, over teacups passed hand to hand and John’s laptop and sometimes breathless in alleys, but no more. John is deeply, lazily happy, no desire to push Sherlock or worry about the future. Sometimes he sees something there, Sherlock watching him hawkishly at crime scenes and over takeaway, but John is content to let him make the next move.
He trudges up the stairs, the loss of adrenaline leaving him tired and a little sick. When he lets himself back into the flat, Sherlock is on his back now, his hands steepled under his chin.
When they first met, Sherlock treated the addiction like a one off, something he was above and beyond, more than human. Sherlock has grown in time, changed, fought battles of emotion and will that would have broken another man. He’s mostly come out the better for it, but a crack in the stone means things can get in now too.
He lets Sherlock go abruptly and Sherlock’s hand shoots to his cheek, his face a mask of confused anger.
“For his face,” she says with a stern look, pointing to Sherlock who looks as if he’s trying to hide behind his own mug.
“Sherlock-” John starts, but as if the sound of his name is a red flag, Sherlock surges upward once more. To his surprise, Sherlock goes for the remains of the mirror instead of him, trying to elbow John aside, and John barely has the strength to hold him back.
John nods, retrieving a black wide tooth comb from the second drawer where it appears to be living with a tub of pomade, several small vertebrae John thinks might belong to a cat, a sewing needle, a package of violin strings, a single grapefruit spoon, a set of dentist tools, nail clippers, and a tube of aquaphor. John stares into the mess for a brief moment, wondering how a bathroom drawer can so perfectly encapsulate a single person.
“We-we need to talk about this.” John stutters out, feeling betrayed by his own mouth. Talking is the last thing he feels like doing.
“And a stone lighter. Don’t worry, I carry all my muscle in my thighs.” John says with what he hopes is a suggestive wiggle of his eyes brows. “I can’t believe you haven’t noticed.”
John stares and stares, watching the sunset light play over Sherlock’s face, the fan still playfully rustling his hair on each pass. Sherlock, in keeping with John’s estimate of his perfection, doesn’t fidget or quail under the scrutiny; instead, he lets his eyes slide closed, breathing carefully through his mouth and allowing John to look his fill. The blush recedes from his face slowly, his illness and recovery leaving him even paler and thinner than usual, and still John can’t stop looking. When Sherlock finally opens his eyes again, they are soft and dark and a little tired, lit with promise and anticipation.
John digs his thumbs in and runs them along the top edge of Sherlock’s hip bones, swallowing the taller man’s answering gasp. Kissing has degraded to panting into each other’s mouths, John’s brain trying to decide how to move next and overwhelmed by all the options.
Even shuffling along, Sherlock’s pace outstrips John’s easily. He’s halfway up the stairs to 221B as John bolts the front door behind them against the rain roaring outside, his feet dragging and thumping on every step. A shushing sound fills the hall from where Sherlock leans heavily on the wall in his windbreaker, sliding against the old wallpaper.
John had been writing a rambling blog post to fill the time, joking about the heat and explaining their absence from crime solving due to Sherlock’s illness. John had been idly wondering who Sherlock tormented with his illnesses before John had come along and the subsequent comments on his blog prove just what John suspected, which is basically that Sherlock keeps working until he collapses and either Lestrade or Molly force him into Mrs. Hudson’s care.
Sherlock moves to turn away, and John catches him by the wrist tightly. The sigh Sherlock lets out is almost inaudible but his eyes lock on where John has a hold of him.
When they finally break, John has absolutely no idea how much time has passed and it’s glorious. He was wrong about Sherlock being debauched before, only now does he deserve the term. His mouth is red and just a little swollen to match the bruise growing on his cheekbone, his eyes dark, his shirt half untucked and his breath heaving in his chest.
“Fuck, oh fuck come here,” John orders, pulling and pushing Sherlock’s until he’s spread luxiously on his back across his own bed, licking at his swollen mouth and looking at John like the cat who got the canary.
“Is there a reason you're wearing his coat? Did you have to be naked for this particular experiment? Or this one of your things, something you
It’s a lot, leaving John feeling a little sore throated and satisfied as he pulls back with a slick pop, the ends trailing over his lips and down his chin. He closes his eyes and breaths hard for a second, trying to catch up with his own racing heart. John feels fingers trace the line of his jaw, drag through the mess of his mouth, and he darts his tongue out to catch. When he opens his eyes,  Sherlock is staring down at him with utter delight, reaching to press his thumb to John’s bottom lip and biting at his own in mirror.
Sherlock strolls casually out of his room, holding a light grey sheet wrapped messily around him, the rest trailing down and out like he’s in an ancient painting, a muse draped in linen. He has three mugs balanced precariously in the other hand, probably full of mold. He glides across the room and dumps them into the sink with a clatter that makes John jump.
He puts a hand over Sherlock’s on his arm, “It’s okay, I’m not leaving. Do you have a comb somewhere here?”
Sherlock slides down in the water, his pale knees breaking the surface to accommodate his torso, and closes his eyes.
Sherlock turns in just a way that a passing car illuminates the bruise traversing the plane of his cheek and something in John snaps.
John wants to argue but knows it’s useless. “Don’t stay in too long, your cuts need to dry and a bandage. You’re lucky no glass stuck in.”
John digs his fingers just slightly into Sherlock’s hair, trying to keep himself from slapping Sherlock right across his already bruised face. A cursory check shows Sherlock’s pulse is steady, his pupils are blown wide but not uneven, and he seems to be breathing normally, so John assumes it’s the same chemical as last time which made Sherlock docile and floppy as a sleepy puppy but had no lasting effects.
His voice cuts out when John presses his mouth, hot and open, to the thin, tender skin of Sherlock’s top rib and then bites down one by one until he reaches Sherlock’s stomach. He mouths there, relishing in the heave of Sherlock’s breath under his mouth, dipping his tongue into Sherlock's navel and earning a delightfully surprised shout, before he moves on. He settles himself in the vee of Sherlock’s legs, bracketed by the pale stretch of Sherlock’s thighs, and runs his hands over every part of Sherlock’s skin he can reach except exactly where Sherlock wants his hands.
“Astonishingly,” Sherlock adds, sounding completely normal, as if he can slide from regular thoughts to sweaty and cum-covered in John’s arms and back without a thought, “I find myself enjoying this without the need for further deductions or information. Other than my running list of your surprisingly extensive kinks. Both as much a novelty to me as they are to you, I assure you.”
Sherlock just manages to level himself up to his elbows, though it takes him a long, uncoordinated moment, John sitting back on his thighs to allow him a little room. Sherlock would almost look cross if he didn’t also look so utterly blissed out.
John has a vague memory of bashing his shins on the stairs, Sherlock’s deep voice too close to his ear, an iron bar across his chest, dragging him. Sherlock must have gone to bed at some point, because he’s not on the sofa, the floor, his chair, or in the bathtub when John finally stumbles down from his room, stomach growling.
John hums in reply, beyond words, idly stretching to run his teeth over the shell of Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock swears under his breath, his hips rocking up and pressing his silky cock along the length of John’s stomach.
He casts back to a vague memory of Harry as a child, horrible knots in the long hair she hated. He always wondered if she did it on purpose, as a way to force their mother to cut her hair, but John’s mom was patient and delicate each time, sitting next to the bath and gently working the knots from Harry’s hair. He tries to remember the process, mostly calling up memories of Harry yelling and his mom smiling softly.
John, and Sherlock for perhaps one of the first times in his life, jump at the sound of Mrs. Hudson’s voice. She’s standing in the open doorway, looking pleased and a little wicked, a tray of tea and nibbles in her hands.
John is staring at Sherlock’s eyes, but Sherlock’s gaze is zeroed in on John’s mouth, his eyes the perfect silver teal of olive leaves glinting in the sun. Barely a handbreadth away and Sherlock still somehow looks lonely.
Sherlock re-adjusts in his chair so that his legs are laying over one arm and his head is tilted back over the other, the sheet nearly baring the entire right side of his body, only saved by a quick reflexive grab.
A soft patter of rain starts up outside and quickly speeds until it is the constant hum of a downpour. Lighting flashes again, each time closer and brighter, thunder rumbling on the horizon now. The room goes dark, without sun or streetlamp, and Sherlock reaches one long arm to flip on the lamp, flooding the room with warm gold light.
He tries for innocence but somehow the comment veers into wickedness and even Sherlock is looking at him out of the corner of his eye with a shadow of surprise.
Sherlock sits upright again and sighs long sufferingly, scrubbing hard through his hair so that when he lifts his head the curls are going every which direction.
John has single-mindedly marched halfway to a brekkie sandwich and coffee from a pot that Sherlock isn’t growing algae in, when he realizes his phone isn’t in his pocket. He waffles on the sidewalk for a moment, wondering if the hunger or the anxiety will win out.
John gestures wordlessly to Sherlock’s dangling foot and Sherlock only shrugs. The bones of Sherlock’s ankle feel brittle and sharp under John’s hands, but John is thankful to find the cuts there won’t need stitches either. He taps the edge of the tub, motioning for Sherlock’s other foot, which Sherlock finally lifts after a long, agonizing moment. Luckily, this one has escaped unscathed through some miracle and John lets him go gently. Sherlock lets both his pale feet sink to the bottom of the tub once more, hissing at the hot water on his cuts.
For a moment, John wonders if this is what it is like to be Sherlock. His brain is boiling like a pot with the lid on, shaking and rattling, and he notices a number of details in the space of a few breaths.
John sees putting Sherlock to bed, brushing his hair back from his face and smiling when Sherlock whines about being mollycoddled, half asleep already. Sees himself watching Sherlock sleep, mumbling to himself even unconscious. He can picture the climb to his own room, the chill of a military bed and a spartan lifestyle, and sees himself instead, shoving Sherlock over and climbing into his bed. Sherlock who spends as much on his bedding as he does on his clothes, luxurious and soft and warm.
“Don’t be rude Sherlock, Molly cares for you even when you treat her like dirt. She deserves better and she happens to be taking care of Rosie who I wouldn’t let within 100 yards of you at the moment.”
Sherlock works him hard and fast and surprisingly messy. If John’s head weren’t already spinning he would wonder at how someone can be so fastidious and so utterly unselfconscious all in the same heartbeat.
“No really,” John continues when he has his breath back, because this is important damn it! “Thank you. Thank you for being honest, the least I can do is be the same.”
Once upon a time this would have been weird, awkward, but John’s a doctor and Sherlock is Sherlock and they’ve been through too much to wonder at the oddness of their proximity.
Sherlock buries his nose in the thatch of brown curls at the base of John’s cock, breathing deeply. His hands are questing up the back of John’s thighs, pressing and scratching lightly in turns across every secret, soft place on John’s body.
John tries the handle, somehow still surprised to find it locked even though Mrs. Hudson said it had been. He curses, he should have grabbed a spare key from her! Why would he ever bother carrying his own? It’s not like Sherlock has ever locked this door in his life.
He pounds on the door, roaring, “Unlock this door Sherlock or I’m taking it apart with my bare hands!”
She huffs a laugh, drowned out by Sherlock roaring John’s name again and a sound that is definitely Sherlock hurling himself at the door and sliding down to the floor.
John has had his hair washed, in intimacy and necessity. A girlfriend when he was younger was the quiet, tactile sort and then later, all those months he couldn’t lift his left arm entirely and his right only barely, kind nurses and ever so rarely, Harry. He knows the comfort of the feeling well, the kind of thing no one asks for but most people need, apparently even Sherlock Holmes.
John pulls away, Sherlock’s fingers just brushing his arm but not quite catching, and stands quickly, avoiding the look on Sherlock’s face.
“Besides,” John continues, knowing full well Sherlock isn’t listening, “I’m a doctor too, in case you forgot, and I’ve seen you high enough times to know when you are on the come down.”
John breathes carefully through his nose, but still his voice comes out with more venom that he intends. “Open this door, or I take it apart.”
John pulls Sherlock’s mug from his hands and sets it on the table carefully. He pulls a chair up close to Sherlock, so that one of Sherlock’s knees is caught between his own.
The thought is a stark reminder. No matter the dosage or the drug, Sherlock is impaired in every sense of the word, and John doesn’t play that game.
John’s not an idiot. He’s not unaware of the codependent nature of his relationship with Sherlock Holmes, especially in the past year, nor is he prone to anxiety on the matter. He accepted long ago that he can’t keep Sherlock alive, because he can barely keep himself alive, and the guilt he used to feel for that has long ago melted into something softer and kinder.
Sherlock still looks a little dubious but something in his eyes glints like a challenge, like he needs to witness for himself this strength in John.
When John can finally bring himself to look Sherlock in the face, he’s surprised to find that Sherlock almost looks angry.
A breath he coughs out, stuttered and inelegant, when John darts in and licks a long path through his own cum up the long column of Sherlock’s throat.
John sits back from his laptop, wondering if he should get up and grab Sherlock a cold pack and water, but light fingers on his shoulder stop him in his tracks. Sherlock comes in so close that John can feel his breath ghosting over the side of his face, a shadow on the edge of John’s peripheral vision, and rests his chin on John’s shoulder.
Sherlock’s shoulders hitch just once under John’s touch, and he presses the heels of his hands into his eyes and then back over his skull.
Sherlock’s head thumps back into the wall, his hands sliding up John’s neck and into his hair, fingers tight and questing.
“Did you drug him?” The coldness of his voice frightens even him, Irene’s smile fades a little and Sherlock tries, and fails, to sit up. Groaning when he falls back to the floor with a muted thump.
Turns out Sherlock carries only a fractionally deeper understanding of long-term climate change than he does heliocentrism, daily weather being more useful for deductions. Not enough people murdering each other in London over global warming, John supposes; but if the heat hangs on much longer, the first victim might be Sherlock himself.
Sherlock’s head falls back, his adam's apple bobbing knife sharp under the skin of his neck as he swallows, “John!”
John looks down at Sherlock’s long, slender fingers wrapped around his wrist and has to mentally stuff this all in a box for morning, the uneasy swooping of his stomach from earlier returning with it’s new friend, a low grade, grinding headache.
John looks over his shoulder with what he hopes is a suitably pointed glare but Sherlock only shrugs, swanning back through the flat and curling into his chair in one seamless move, sheet endlessly tangled and draped around him. Hints of him are exposed between the lines of the soft fabric: the toes of one foot, curled up to the top of his thigh, one pale shoulder sharp and bare, the long fingers of one hand.
Sherlock gets one more punch in before John shoulders the door open, slamming the wood into Sherlock who stumbles back into the wall. Sherlock is dazed for a moment, giving time for John to get between him and the remnants of glass showered over the sink, counter, and onto the floor before Sherlock lunges at him.
Sherlock, honest to god, sticks his tongue out. The scrunched, petulant face and damp curls in his eyes make him look like an overgrown toddler.
Sherlock surges into him, pinning him to the wall and keeping him from crumpling to the floor. John manages to get his legs under him, but it takes longer than it should due to Sherlock’s plundering kiss, wet and hot and full of teeth and impatience.
It’s obvious Sherlock has experience, a thought John can’t dwell too closely on right now, but he responds with such breathless delight to every little touch that John is momentarily furious at every person who has ever touched Sherlock before and not made him feel this way each and every time. It only lasts a moment though, before the smug pleasure that he’s the only one to tempt these writhing sounds from Sherlock Holmes bleeds through.
When he meets Sherlock’s gaze again, the taller man looks struck, hope and desire flickering in the maelstrom of his emotions. John releases his grip on Sherlock’s hand, but Sherlock steps closer, sliding that same hand along John’s jaw and into his hair. John catches him by the waist, fingers half on damp warm skin and half on terry cloth, and pulls them together on instinct.
John doesn’t realize how long he’s been staring into the space just over the top edge of his newspaper until Sherlock trips over a stack of books trying to get to the bathroom, sprawling roughly out on the living room floor next to John’s chair.
“Ask me about it when I’m sober,” Sherlock says, letting John’s hand slide from his grasp gently. “Don’t let me avoid the question or insult you.”
John stands with a sigh and sets about making tea. He fills the kettle and flicks the switch on, reaches past Sherlock to add a second empty mug to the counter and teabags in both cups, slams the silverware drawer into Sherlock’s thigh, and all the while Sherlock doesn’t budge an inch.
He walks her all the way to the sidewalk and sees her into a cab. He knows that by not taking Sherlock’s coat back, she’ll be back eventually, but a small, bitter part of him acknowledges that maybe Sherlock wants her around.
The lunge has left him zeroed in on Sherlock’s hip, crouched slightly so that his head is just the height of Sherlock’s chest and his hands space the plane of Sherlock’s lower stomach, up over his hip bone, and into the expanse of soft thigh.
Sherlock watches him without answer, his mind processing whatever details it picks up, and then he shrugs, sinking back into the pillows with a wiggle and stretch John will never
“Then we’ll worry about it later.” John says, stepping neatly between Sherlock's legs and hauling him in for another bruising kiss.
“Sherlock!” John calls, scrambling out of his chair, nearly dumping his entire side table, cup of tea and all, on the floor in his haste.
The next moments are a blur of pulling and pushing. Sherlock gets his bedroom door open but John pushes it closed; toeing his shoes off and stalking Sherlock against the bed until his knees bend and he’s suddenly looking up at John. The room is dim, lit only by the remnants of afternoon sunlight dispersed through the oncoming stormclouds, making the rumpled grey linens of the bed shimmer, casting Sherlock in a halo.
All he knows is suddenly his arms are full of Sherlock and they are kissing like the other holds all the oxygen in the room.
John is trying to ignore Sherlock watching him, but somehow his eyes are always in the corner of John’s vision. Neither of them hears a word of what Mrs. Hudson is on about, peering in the fridge, grimacing and poking Sherlock’s glassware and tupperware full of swirling mysterious substances.
“Oooooh,” a woman’s voice croons, just loud enough for him to make out, “now that’s a guest that could make this a little more interesting.”
Before John has consciously made a decision, he’s already turned and headed back, figuring he can get his phone and Sherlock’s breakfast order all in one go and feel marginally less like he wasted a trip. He’s so lost in the daydream of his sandwich and piecing together the rush of the last 3 days that his feet carry him halfway into the flat before he even realizes he’s back.
John steps between his spread knees and runs his thumbs reverently over Sherlock’s cheekbones, relishing in how Sherlock’s eyes fall closed, basking in the sensation. The whole magnificent mind of him, cradled in John’s rough hands and Sherlock looks...content. Peaceful. Things John would have paid anything to bring to Sherlock’s life, and now here he is, finding it as simple as reaching out to touch.
John floats for a bit, let’s himself sink into the bliss of it. He drifts, daydreaming of the taste of Sherlock in his mouth, the flashbang sensation each time Sherlock’s sinks down around him, the breathless punched out sounds they are both making.
He’s not sure how much time has passed when Sherlock suddenly turns to loom over him, instead of the teacup, causing John to startle and narrowly avoid spilling hot tea on his fingers.
“I’m remembering why I like you, Watson. You bite,” she says appreciatively. She watches him for a long moment in which he refuses to blink and suddenly she shrugs, the spell broken. “He said it was for a case. Something about force, the rate and shape of the bruising. It’s the first time he’s texted back in ages, it sounded fun.”
“Don’t be ridiculous John,” Sherlock mutters into the tender skin across the plane of John’s hip, making him jerk, “I haven’t done anything yet. You hardly know how good I am at anything.”
Sherlock looks even more a corpse now, bloodless and sunken in the dim yellow light of the bathroom. His veins all stand out on his body, a green-blue roadmap of the simple, human workings of him beneath that mind. His arms are bruised, some healing track marks but many look like gripping hands.
Sherlock makes an aborted movement, half shrug and half bodily eye roll, which almost sends him backwards, scrabbling at the door frame to keep upright.
John waits exactly five full seconds and then rapidly bounces up and down on the apparent squeaky spring with as much gleeful energy as he can muster.
Sherlock shifts under him, stretching and turning until he’s on his stomach, arms under his head where his face is pressed into the pillow. John returns to his spot against Sherlock’s hip, wandering fingers mapping the constellations of Sherlock’s back.
Even in the beautiful clawfoot tub,  Sherlock is all long bones, curled distortedly around his knees to fit inside. His knuckles leave small smears of blood on the skin poking out of the water, but John can already tell he won’t need stitches.
“Actually, no, you aren’t. That would involve you using actual words, aloud, outside of your own brain.”
But, as the knots start to slide and loosen in Sherlock’s hair, so do the knots in Sherlock’s body. He fractures and slides under John’s touch, stretching and sinking in the water as far as his long limbs will allow.
Sherlock sinks down into the bath, looking so much like a grumpy turtle that it sends John into a fit of laughs he thinks might actually border on hysterics. Sherlock sinks his whole head underwater, scrubbing his fingers through his hair and pointedly shaking water all over John and the floor when he emerges. He splays a large, damp hand over the curve of John’s shoulder to steady himself as he steps out of the tub, legs wobbly still.
“Oh yes John, like that’s ever worked.” He truly isn’t drunk enough for the level of sarcasm in her voice right now. “Besides, he’s locked the door.”
John focuses on not being self-conscious, not sucking in ridiculously. He’ll never be thin like Sherlock is thin, and there are still abs there from army days and chasing Sherlock around since; they’ve just tucked back into the softer edges of a body that enjoys life once more, a feat he’s genuinely proud of.
Sherlock moans indecently, his fingers twisting tightly in John’s hair, and John surges up to taste it with his own mouth. John can feel his hands tremble on Sherlock’s thighs, his mind spinning with possibilities.
”We’re all addicts, in our own way.” She finally replies, but she sounds sad. “Feeding his addiction for a little bit of quiet won’t harm him. At least, not irreparably.”
“Good catch,” Sherlock says between then, with just the same tone as that first night in the parking lot, pride and a hint of something else.
Sherlock eventually breaks the freeze by slurping his tea loudly and John realizes his hand is starting to go numb under the peas.
He pulls back to watch Sherlock, looking a little more desperate and hungry than John ever expected he could look. He’s arched sharply in John’s arms, one hand tight in John’s hair and one in the sheets above his head, head thrown back and skin flushed.
John turns away, making himself busy laying dirty towels from the hamper on the floor and grabbing a fresh one and the first aid kit from under the sink, but when he turns back, Sherlock is just sitting there, hair hanging in his face.
They will always come back to the flat, bruised or bloody or madly laughing, and always back to each other.
He bites at the pale expanse of Sherlock’s inner thigh, teasing a bruise to the surface, and barely hanging on to Sherlock writhing in his arms.
John deliberately and pointedly pins Sherlock to the bed by one broad hand, pressed into the tender skin just under his ribcage, at the top of his stomach. Sherlock sucks a breath in sharply in reply.
“Sherlock if you are gonna act like a child, I will treat you like a child and that certainly includes my face never coming anywhere near your face again.”
“Yes, fancy, you arse! Someone you like in a sentimental fashion! Stop saying it like it’s something disgusting. Adults are supposed to communicate these things, ask you know? Not everyone attaches feelings to sex or the other way round, but, it’s important to ask.”
When he can quell the shaking in his hands, he manhandles Sherlock’s tall frame up off the rug and onto the couch. Sherlock keeps sliding boneless from his hands and complaining in a barely intelligible voice the whole way.
Mrs. Hudson and John share one more small smile and she closes and bolts her door as he trudges up the stairs.
John can’t help the wicked grin that jumps to his face. Perhaps he dislikes her so much because she’s closer to kin than he wants to admit, “Why? Do you want to?”
When she leans back, her smile is cold and she snaps the car door shut on him, once again leaving with the last word.
Sherlock shifts forward and suddenly winces. Their eyes both dart down and Sherlock mutters, “bollocks” under his breath.
His breath blows over John’s face, smelling of coffee, radiating triumph in every line of his body. John feels like he’s holding a loaded gun, warm and familiar and dangerous and so,
John tightens his fingers just slightly against the sharp edge of Sherlock’s jaw and swallows the sound Sherlock makes.
Sherlock’s hands dance over John’s kneecaps, slightly ticklish, and then up and up and up. Without warning, Sherlock digs his fingers into John’s thighs viciously and swallows John down all in one move. John would be bucking up off the bed if Sherlock weren’t holding him down in a crushing grip and as it is he jerks sharply anyway, curling over Sherlock’s bobbing head.
John rubs his hands over his face again, sighing. “Well I think we both know Sherlock isn’t suddenly going to be a, ‘choke me daddy,’ type so...do I want to know what this was actually about?”
Sherlock turns to look up at John through the loop of his arm and tugs viciously at his own hair, like he’s punishing himself. Sherlock’s eyes have an edge of cruelty now, whether for himself or John, isn’t clear yet.
John does laugh this time, but he pulls out a chair and helps Sherlock into it. He peeks at the cut, not too deep, and chuckles again when Sherlock winces under his touch.
From the depths of his own shadows, Sherlock whispers something half to the floor that John only just catches.
Sherlock grumbles into his pillow and turns his face to John, hair foaming wildly into his eyes. “Please, do enlighten us with whatever you’ve just realized.”
He grabs the short step stool from the kitchen and a large plastic cup from the cupboard When he returns, Sherlock is staring down at his own hands intently, flexing them back and forth. John sets up the stool by the tub, sets the cup down, and drapes a towel over his lap, all without Sherlock commenting.
“-- this insufferable heat. Impossible to focus on anything of value, my head feels like daytime telly.”
Just the corner of her mouth quirks up, “don’t knock it ‘til you try it, Dr. Watson. Though, I believe I underestimated you before. I thought you were jealous, but I think more specifically you are jealous you weren’t the one with the riding crop.”
“You served in an active war zone and got shot in the shoulder. 25% overall hearing loss in the left ear and 20% for high pitches in both ears. Your peripheral vision on the left has improved to compensate, so you are rarely startled.”
“JOHN!” Sherlock roars, sitting up and briefly losing his grip on his sheet again, flushed all down his bare neck and chest.
He captures one of Sherlock’s hands in his own and brings it to his mouth, pressing a kiss to the delicate arch at the base of Sherlock’s pointer finger and then down and over, stopping to bite at Sherlock’s pulse, making Sherlock jump in his grip.
“You poor dear,” she tsks, turning to Sherlock. “Keeping him up all hours of the night worried about you, you should be ashamed of yourself.”
A silence continues to ooze in that honeyed way, sweet and sticky. John feels like the temperature is rising by the second.
Sherlock drags his tongue up the column of John’s neck, sliding his teeth and tongue along stubble before he bites down on the line of John’s jaw, drawing out a startled moan. John’s hands flex against the muscle of his thighs, making Sherlock bite harder, a feedback loop of pleasure.
Irene’s grin goes feral. She pulls the lapels of the coat apart and John resists the urge to turn away. But, surprisingly, she’s in a stunning, but rather normal dress, impeccably cut and the same deep black as her stilettos.
Sherlock almost seems to start, but composes himself quickly. “Of course. Husband is lying, her bruising is consistent with struggle. No dom worth their salt would let her leave in that state. BDSM play that involves striking should leave bruises that follow the lines of the body, a natural progression.” He points to the purpling on his face that does indeed follow the line of his cheekbone cleanly, almost a blush.
Something tight in John’s chest loosens in answer. Sherlock struggles to control his wild energy swings at the best of times, but the lack of consistent rest was starting to become a self-sabotaging circle. John had tried every way he could invent to get Sherlock’s temperature down and was just starting to wonder if he’d have to call Mycroft or Molly to get some tests done and scripts filled when the fever finally broke on it’s own.
“Oh so the problem is that you don’t want to wear pants at all?” John asks, barely managing to contain his smile. “No need to get defensive, Sherlock, I’m not going to tell you no.”
He’d know that voice anywhere. Alluring, pulling you in with eyes and lips and teeth, a little curved and sharp and wicked at the end like a fishhook.
John busies himself in the flat, hanging up his coat, shaking the rain out of his hair, peering through the mail Mrs. Hudson left on the table, flipping the kettle on and pulling down mugs and tea. Sherlock lays in a pile on the floor so long John almost wonders if he fell asleep, but eventually he stirs, heaving himself up with judicial help from the door frame.
But, Sherlock is still Sherlock and nothing keeps him from his goal for long. He shoves John’s trousers and pants to his knees, John’s cock already hard enough to stand proudly between them on its own. Sherlock skims his lips just along the edge, making John’s fingers sink into his hair as he bites back a groan.
“You’ve been high as a kite for at least the last 48 hours, I should think you’ve had enough excitement.”
He leans against the counter next to where Sherlock is still staring at his own tea like he hasn’t noticed the cup is full now. John holds his mug in both hands and gently blows on it, feeling calm enough now to let Sherlock come off of whatever wild train of thought he's currently stuck on in his own time.
“Sherlock, what happened to your face? You look a mess!” Mrs. Hudson cries, snapping John out of his reverie. When he gets into the kitchen, Sherlock has curled all his limbs onto a single chair, sipping at a cup of tea more milk than tea and looking marginally less grumpy. He never answers about the bruises and she frowns at him.
He’s exhausted, but he knows he won’t be able to sleep in this oppressive heat, nightmares of hot sand and hotter sun inevitably waiting for him. Instead, he picks up his laptop and tries to decide where the coolest place in the flat might be.
But, even still, John knows that grief and anger come and go unexpectedly. For all the good they’ve accomplished, it still comes whispering out of the woodwork when he leasts expects it, a fog he can’t see the other side of.
Panic which quickly evolves when his head snaps around and he realizes the flash of white is the crisp color of Sherlock’s bedsheet. Said bedsheet is currently wrapped around Sherlock’s lower half, barely, held carefully in place as Sherlock is frozen in the kitchen doorway, the mug of tea in his other hand halfway to his mouth. He is unbelievably naked, all ten miles of him, one leg bared clear to the hip and the sheet nothing more than a precarious flutter, making him look like a classical marble statue.
The thought of Sherlock feeling anything less than utterly wanted, even when he's listless and stuffy-nosed and frustrated, is suddenly viscerally abhorrent to John.
John makes him promise to sit and stay and fetches the first aid kit from below the sink. He sets it to the side, quickly cleaning the glass and spilled tea from the floor before he turns back to Sherlock who is peering at the bottom of his foot, half in anger and half in interest.
This day in particular is the most utterly normal kind of Sunday, in a way 221B hasn’t seen in a long time. John has a cup of tea and the paper, nowhere to be and no one to put on more than ratty jeans and slippers for. The windows are open to invite a breeze, damp heat shimmering ahead of dark, rumbling thunderclouds on the horizon. When the first gust of cool air breaks on the edge of the storm, it tugs playfully at papers and the curtains as it sweeps the flat, making John shiver.
No matter what darkness may forge on in the world, no matter what mysteries the wealthy or powerful may bring him, no matter what Moriarty may be up to in the shadows -- Sherlock Holmes is a constant the universe can’t touch.
There is a brief, uncertain moment of stillness and then John lunges at precisely the same moment Sherlock opens the hand holding the sheet.
“Legs up,” John says, tapping his thigh as he wraps them around John’s hips. “Arms now,” John adds, and Sherlock’s arms snake around his neck, tucking his face into the soft skin behind John’s ear.
Every other time Sherlock has swanned off for drugs, it’s been on the coattails of whatever ultimatum or ticking bomb or mad case they were on. Somehow, it was less worrisome when there was a tangible, logical reason behind it. When John couldn’t judge because he succumbed to his addictions just the same, always torn between Sherlock and Mary, Mary and her past, the part of him that wants cozy sweaters and tea and the part of him more at home with a gun than a baby bottle.
He crowds Sherlock back against the couch so quickly that Sherlock trips over the throw he left on the floor and into the battered loveseat with an oof of surprise, forced to look up at John now who is employing every looming skill he’s ever learned watching Sherlock.
Sherlock turns his head just enough to watch John mouth along the round of his shoulder, looking peaceful.
He sets Sherlock down gently and the sheet slides to the floor between them. Before John can look his fill, Sherlock has shoved him roughly to the opposite wall, dropping to his knees on the hall rug and pressing his face to the bulge in John’s jeans like an overly friendly housecat.
