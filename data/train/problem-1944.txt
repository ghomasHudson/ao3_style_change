Sherlock just hummed and ducked to kiss John, not bothering with pleasantries and dipping his tongue into John’s mouth delicately. John didn’t hesitate, he wrapped Sherlock up in his arms and opened his mouth for Sherlock’s gently explorations, lowering his hands to the small of Sherlock’s back and easing them ever so slowly down and down.
The Gryffindor didn’t notice when he fell asleep but soon enough he felt a nipping in his earlobe and the sound of something clicking impatiently. John opened his eyes blearily and saw Gladstone standing on his chest, head turned curiously as she watched him wake and process his surroundings, specifically the piece of parchment lying right in front of the owl’s claws.
“Sherlock. Sherlock Holmeth” Sherlock shook his hand tentatively. John’s heart lurched at Sherlock’s inconsistent lisp. The thought that he’d just met someone with magical knowledge didn’t seem so scary anymore, it seemed like the complete opposite. The curiosity to ask Sherlock about everything he didn’t know about the magical world suddenly gnawed at him.
“You stopped my fall?” John said, eyes wide with wonder. Sherlock nodded again, a single dip of his head. John’s smile grew impossibly bigger, filling with so much happiness and it was as if a dam was suddenly broken and so many feelings Sherlock had known he was holding back spilled though the light in his eyes. He saw so much joy. And trust. Finally, so much trust.
As soon as they arrived at Sherlock’s place hours later, the smell of Eliza’s chocolate chip cookies filled John up from the instant they walked in, and he was home.
“She’s decent looking I guess… I wouldn’t know.” Sherlock responded, interrupting John’s whirring train of thought “Women aren’t exactly… my area” Sherlock said quickly, not meeting John’s eye.
Here is where..um...events unfold ;) I hope it turned out alright <3<3<3
He glared one last time at John, but when he turned to look at Sherlock his look darkened. Sherlock was completely pressed back against the wall, chest heaving and gaze frightened, set entirely on John.
Can you feel the loooove tonight??  It is ALMOST where we aaare...
Before either of them was sure what was happening they were kissing. Well, Sherlock was mostly standing perfectly still, still too shocked to react as John's lips slid between his over and over again, pressing and pulling. He felt his eyes slip closed as John tangled his fingers onto his curls, drawing a low almost imperceptible moan from Sherlock’s throat. He felt John’s tongue tracing the seam of his lips and was just about to open them and grant him access when-
Sherlock felt John’s hand squeeze his own reassuringly. The silence around them grew into a comfortable hum, undisturbed by nought but the shine of the stars. The excitement of their future to come buzzed, Sherlock thought about how now he wouldn’t have to part ways from John. They could go to school together. Him and John. His friend. His only friend. He closed his eyes, feeling sleep blur around the corners of his vision.
“Against like 100!” John quipped, and followed Sherlock to the ground. He landed beside him with a soft thump just as the rain let loose and drops showered down heavily.
Thy were walking down the road towards the bus stop, the late sun afternoon was reflecting from John’s golden hair in a series of glinting colours Sherlock was trying his best to memorize to exact detail so he could later immortalize in a painting.
Hours later Sherlock was staring at the ceiling. John’s place, as promised, was not very large. But it was charming and it was
“Both!” John said “But... the food mostly” he shrugged.
Later that day, before afternoon lessons, Sherlock sat in front of John in the Gryffindor common room in his usual black leather chair and John in his squashy red velvet in front of the fire. Sherlock was in a full rant, telling his best friend all about his latest results with his experiments in the forbidden forest on the correlation between the density and lengths of unicorn hair compared to the power for wand cores. Spending time together was and had always been easy. And John, as always, listened attentively to his friend's rants while Sherlock secretly basked in the fact that John actually cared and was interested in whatever he had to say...
“Shhh, Greg! McGonagall’s standing” Molly nudged him with her shoulder.
JOHN JUST TURN AROUND FOR GODSAKE. Everything would go SO much faster. Gah.
Sherlock felt all his blood pooling down to his groin. Almost to the point where it was painful. Giving in completely, he curled his hand around himself and gasped. Flashes of John’s smile reverberated in his mind. What would those lips look parted and gasping for breath? Sherlock gave himself a slow pull, thumbing the tender head and hissing in pleasure.
“Um? I was too distracted by the bludger about to
“Oh, I just can’t believe my bumblebee has his first boyfriend! And a Model… a doctor… an ex-soldier!” Mummy squealed loudly “How wonderful! I’m sure he’ll be a great father too should you two decide to adopt-”
It didn’t take long to spot them talking in the corner of a hallway. All John had to do was hide behind the people walking the other way towards the Great hall and duck behind the closest statue where the hallways met at a cross section. He was a safe distance away so that if anything happened he could just quickly turn to the corridor at his right and pretend he was never there but close enough to make out what they were saying.
The overload of information on John was absolutely
“JOHN” Sherlock barked. Of all things for John to focus on, that was NOT one he needed to explain right this moment.
The door to the classroom opened and the model walked in.
John looked at the Ravenclaw. And looked. The cheer of the audience was still resounding as he opened his left hand in front of Sherlock letting the small shimmering golden snitch glide away, met by another wave of applause from the Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff stands.
John laughed, nudging Sherlock with his elbow gently. Sherlock elbowed back huffing out his own begrudging laugh. Going camping had been Sherlock’s idea after John had described a couple of his camping trips with his grandparents and his sister. Mycroft had helped them build a small fire and they’d roasted smores, which Sherlock adored instantly, and dared each other to finish an entire packet of Bertie Bots every flavoured beans. In the end, John had only almost thrown up twice and Sherlock once. A true success.
As silence fell between them again Sherlock searched fro something else to say. Anything to stop John walking back onto the other side of the room, even just the other side of the desk and leaving cold air in the space next to his body.
“You really don’t think it’s strange?” Sherlock whispered, brow furrowing in concern.
“It’s fine Mike. We’ll come with you” John stood and smiled over to Sherlock but it looked forced and too careful.
“All okay” he confirmed, squeezing John’s hand and covering John’s top one in his. He wondered how the must look, all hands in a soothing intimate mound between both of their bodies, beaming at each other from across the small round table and leaning as close as they could. They probably blended in with all the couples around them, the artist thought. They probably looked as if they did this sort of thing every night. Easy smiles and shared space, comforting touches and warm gazes.
“Baby brother…” Mycroft grinned. “You’re levitating”.
“SHERLOCK!” John cried, scrambling out of his seat and running across the classroom as fast as he could to the limp unmoving figure of Sherlock Holmes.
John grinned at him as if he was the sun itself. Why was John grinning at him like that? Shouldn’t he be running away from him already? That’s what most people who spent time with Sherlock did. Of course, he’d known John when they were kids but… it had been years, surely John would not tolerate him the same way he used to.
“Oh, Sherlock…” he didn’t even know where to start. He
5 years later John hopped down from the train onto the ground, the badge on his robes glinting slightly as it caught the last remnants of sunlight from the day. He grinned, looking around at his surroundings as people passed him by. It was his sixth year here… in his home. He breathed in the cooling dusk air as started walking in the direction of the crowd. Greg stepped down beside him, looking equally as relieved to be back.
Sherlock had never in his whole teaching career booked a teacher twice in a row. Ever. He just hoped nobody asked why.
“No! No.. its fine” the boy answered. He was also looking down at his feet, not meeting John’s eyes. His arms were trembling slightly at his sides,
“Don’t-“ Sherlock whispered, in response to John pulling away. “I want this… I want
Sherlock grinned, not knowing what exactly had made everything in his mind click so completely but deciding it was best not to dwell on it and just bask in what he did best.
Sherlock looked up in surprise, his cheeks colouring as soon as he made eye-contact with the blonde. “Oh! Uh… hi, John”.
“Keeps poking his massive nose in my business. Since my father left us he took it upon himself to be my “guardian”. He’s bloody awful at it too.”
John grinned, the cheers seeming far away as he once again looked into the vulnerability of Sherlock’s nervous smiles. The pink in his cheeks was much more pronounced as the deep blue of John’s eyes met the grey, glinting with specks of green in the soft sunlight.
To his horror, whatever she said caused John to laugh happily, head thrown back and eyes closed in mirth. She giggled with him, her hand nervously flying onto her hair and twirling it around her finger.
John had walked in and stood gaping around at everything around him, Sherlock just smiled.
Sherlock just blushed and stared at the professor incredulously. “I… I don’t-”
“Today we’re going to be working with mandrakes. Yes, I know you completed this lesson last year but since most of you failed to achieve high scores in this basic Herbology section I decided to review it just in case.” Mr. Longbottom had smiled at his students and instructed the correct way to put on earmuffs so they could begin and he could assess their method of extracting one Mandrake from a pot and replacing it in another.
“And look, John’s arm is braced behind him and is clearly very obviously much larger than this. FEEL the roundness of the bicep. FEEL the way his body leans towards his left leg and the weight settles on his lower back. You’re not observing Anderson. You’re lying to me. Stop lying to me”. He handed Anderson his pencil back brusquely.
He stopped in his tracks as he realised he had never seen the model before so he was not sure what lighting would benefit the figure and how it was perceived in all angles of the classroom. He was not used to having new models as there were always very rare in the school’s old system. By now Sherlock knew every single one of them inside out, not just their bodies but their stories and backgrounds. Not that they liked that he knew that very much. No doubt by now the agency and the models had warned the new guy about Sherlock and his tendency to spew out their entire life stories while they posed and shifted under the glaring light of the lamps. Sherlock smirked, already excited about having a fresh new body to unearth secrets from. What you could perceive from staring at someone for hours could not compare to single glances on the busy streets of London.
John’s eyes fluttered over Sherlock’s slowly flushing face, keeping everything to memory before he quickly, almost imperceptibly, flickered his gaze to Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock’s heart stopped and his feet stopped skating abruptly as his knees shook.
John, in turn, taught Sherlock some muggle customs and games. Sherlock had been completely fascinated when John told him about pirates. He’d showed him a couple of his own picture books and a few movies and at first, Sherlock had scoffed, but John knew he’d been entranced by them. Especially since the entirety of their second summer had been spent pretending they were pirates. Eliza Holmes magicked two mattresses they used as boats to float around, not too high as if they were in water while both boys threw pillows at each other until one surrendered or fell off.
Without letting himself think about it too much John reached out a hand and with gentle fingers, he tenderly dug them into the back of his friend’s hair and untangled the dry leaf with a weak crackle. After that he moved on to the next, coursing his fingers upwards onto the tangled rolls of soft curls. He picked away at the leaves and soothed the scratches of the dry edges with tender fingertips. Sherlock’s breath hitched in a barely audible gasp and when John was finally brave enough to turn to look at him he had his eyes closed, his neck craned up and towards John’s hand, pushing into the touch. His neck was tinted pink, the blush spreading through to his cheeks and pooling there heavily. His lips were slightly parted in a soundless gasp.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, shaking his hand begrudgingly but knowing this particular kind of press could push his career faster. They shook hands, the art critic’s cold and clammy, much to the artist’s displeasure.
Close to nightfall, Sherlock took them to a candy store, the building looked brand new, much brighter than any other in its surroundings. Its sign wasn’t quite as name catching as the others, it just read “Angelo’s”. They walked in, Sherlock leading as he had most of the day and John following. The shorter boy stopped in front of the counter and raised himself on his tiptoes to catch the attention of the man behind it, who was currently looking for something in the back.
part of the night… was when they sat next to each other, thighs touching, and Sherlock had suddenly flopped down and laid his head on John’s lap to “read more comfortably, John. Obviously”. And John had snorted and had given up on his book in favour of using his wand-free hand to course his fingers through Sherlock’s silky locks until the Beauxbatons dropped his book as well and closed his eyes. John woke him up a while after that when the light shining from the window became a light pale grey instead of the single white bloom of the moon.
After a few minutes, just as Sherlock was beginning to feel himself melting into the mattress and his throat was no longer able to come up with any sound that did not at least somewhat resemble John’s name, he distantly heard the lid of the lube bottle pop open. A part of him felt a twinge of nerves, he knew at least this first time, would be a painful. He’d read extensively on the topic to at least have an idea of what to expect but his stomach still fluttered partly with arousal and partly with nerves. He trusted John, though, trusted him entirely with his mind and body and so he did his best to relax.
John snickered, trying his best not to roll his eyes at how amazing and wonderfully weird this madman was. “I'd love to see the case files. Hopefully, you’ll get another 10 sometimes soon. Though I’d advise against such erratic sleep patterns”
Sherlock opened his mouth but nothing came out
“I see you’ve drawn this particular man quite a lot. He seems to be the very center of the… show.” He snorted and stopped walking, Sherlock almost walking into him. Victor Trevor turned around, looking smug and predatory and stepping closer. “Is he… your cousin or something?”
“You don’t know why I wouldn’t want you to get hurt? Why… why I would rather
They all sat in a circle around the few drawing they had posted on the largest wall in the room, all sketches of John and a few of Irene in poses from all angles, some quite good and accurate drawings, others not so much. This was one of the professor’s favorite lessons of the semester as he got to evaluate them and observe their growth. And the students got some confidence as everyone else critiqued their work, which was usually a very reinforcing and confidence building process as the student’s tended to be nice to each other, especially in a class as demanding as Sherlock’s.
As soon as the students began to leave Sherlock expected John to do so as well, as the models usually did, scamper off as quickly as he possibly could to change into his normal clothes and stalk out of the room without a word to Sherlock. John, however, only sank into the chair Sherlock had set out for the second half of the day and massaged his shoulder whilst he sighed in relief at being able to relax his muscles properly for the first time in hours and scrolled through his phone while everyone else vacated the room.
The Beauxbatons scoffed. “I’m just tiring you up. This was the warm-up John.”
have a broad collection of books… but they’re mostly boring charms. Hogwarts has a much more extensive variety in the dark arts. Especially in the restricted section”, he mused.
John smiled, being grateful that even if Sherlock did not contact him again at least he cared a little about him.
Sherlock snorted, “You and your obsession with breakfast. Fine. I’ll.. see you then”.
Ever since he was a child he had been able to see and take in much more than almost everyone around him. His brother had been gifted with the same type of ability but he, instead of applying it into his passions, decided to grow his intelligence into the world of politics and use it as a way of manipulating people into doing exactly as he pleased.
“Yeah... much better now. Now that we can do this” he rose on his tiptoes and laid a kiss on the artist’s lips. Sherlock responded instantly, arms wrapping possessively around John’s neck and tilting his head for better access. This had to be a good sign. The blonde clearly needed comfort from him so the cause of his sadness was most likely not connected to them. They still needed to talk. Sherlock needed to know. He wanted to keep seeing John no matter if he was the only one or not, but he couldn’t keep the pretense of not knowing the model was seeing or wanted to see other people too.
John was about to protest but Molly’s happiness was too contagious and for the first time in these past months after having to swallow up these bubbling feelings and repressing all this emotion… John just finally let it out. He beamed, feeling a blissful bubble burst in his chest, surging up with warmth. He allowed this all-encompassing emotion fill him up from head to toe as it fluttered through his chest, holding a familiar sense comfort.
particular summer day John was sitting down under the biggest oak tree he could find in Sherlock’s backyard, browsing through one of Sherlock’s many books on Quidditch tips and history. Even if he knew chances were he could never fly a broom himself the game itself seemed endlessly fascinating to him. Sherlock was lying down in the grass next to him, muttering to himself every now and then about something that suspiciously sounded like “drought of the living death” but John knew better than to ask, lest he wanted to find himself trying to replicate the same potion even when he and Sherlock couldn’t find the exact ingredient and could not use magic. Sherlock was a big believer in finding a way or a loophole even in magical potions. 3 of John’s destroyed jumpers were clear evidence of how far he would go to prove this. John snorted lightly but kept reading.
Every now and then Sherlock would pause and say “Change pose now” and John, without taking his eyes off of Sherlock for one second would instantly switch his body into a different but somehow just as intricate and thought out pose.
I'll answer last chapter's comments tomorrow morning. I just needed to post this asap. Because.... reasons. Exciting reasons. You'll see ;)    I hope you enjoy this long chapter! (Seriously long. It's about 2 and a half times the size of my normal chapters- hence the long wait for it) <3<3
At the end of the class just as the students were leaving and John was at the back of the room changing back into his clothes, today a striped blue and white jumper and navy blue jeans, Sherlock’s phone pinged with a text.
An owl was perched on the windowsill looking puffed up and superior. Two letters were held tightly in his small brown beak, a red wax seal holding a familiar symbol in the centre of the top one could be seen. It ruffled its feathers before dropping the letters.
It was clear that his class was bracing themselves too, everyone trying to be 100% focused on their drawing and gaining momentum in their graphite strokes on the paper. Even Anderson had granted Sherlock the honour of tearing his gaze away from Sally’s waist and was squinting at his drawing as if willing it to look exactly like John.
“Sally you’ve GOT to stop aiming for your own teammate's heads!” John shouted.
John shook his head; she didn’t have to explain anything to him. The last thing she needed was someone else that told her what to do. Instead, John just threw his arms around her waist and hugged her, pressing his face into the soft material of her jumper at her shoulder, where his head barely reached.
Greg and Molly assured him that he if he hadn’t written him he must have had a reason. No one cuts contact without a motive. John supposed they were right. After all… John
Sherlock snorted “Hi, John”.
John reached into the large box of… jelly beans? And took one out before popping it into his mouth. “No, wait!” Sherlock exclaimed just as John started chewing.
Whatever Sherlock’s thoughts on John’s kiss last week were still a bit of a mystery. They had talked easily on the walk back from the crime scene, clearly having successfully avoided the subject and ready to move on. There was no denying that Sherlock enjoyed his company as much as John enjoyed his. Perhaps even if they couldn’t progress their friendship into…. Something more, John could still keep him as a close friend. He would swallow up his feelings and do that. For Sherlock.
Sherlock tried to focus on the student’s drawings and stopped in front of Sally’s. He could see some very serious perspective mistakes when it came to John’s upturned arm and how that had been measured against John’s back. His back look far smaller than it actually was, he should know. He looked up and compared the drawing to John silently, and promptly looked down again. On John’s back… he could very faintly see scratch marks. Scratch marks he remembered putting there himself.
He had to see John again. It didn’t matter if he had to convince John to forget about the kiss. It didn’t matter if John regretted it. Sherlock would promise not to bring it up ever again. But.. he had to see him again. He simply had to.
, thought Sherlock,
John sighed, nudging at Sherlock’s face with his own to capture his lips again, reliving every second of having Sherlock look at him as he modelled, the intimacy in the act, the trust of being at your most vulnerable for someone to see, to stare.
“No, John. You aren’t listening. He was innocent. The police had him as a prime suspect but I assured them they had the wrong guy and to let him go. Nice guy, he was-“
another bedroom if you want to have your own”
And then time stopped.
“No!” Sherlock answered too fast.
His heart fluttered in pleasure.
John blinked, surprised by the question. “Afghanistan? Why?”
John rolled his eyes again, fighting off a grin and keeping himself upright as he shoved Greg back. “Let's just get back to practice, alright?” he said, ignoring Greg’s knowing look and already feeling the interrogation that would surely come up soon enough over this over dinner or later in the common room.
Another month of wait.... heh. Sorryyyy....
“Okay?” Sherlock asked softly. “It was perfect. I’ve been wanting this for so long… wanting you for so long”.
John shushed him gently with a longer graze of their lips, capturing Sherlock’s sweet mouth and working it gently with his own until Sherlock was soothed once more.
Sherlock snorted, shaking her hand. “I can. Trust me. John hasn’t changed at all from when he was eleven as far as I can tell” he grinned mischievously at her as John gasped dramatically, hand pressed to his chest.
“Yeah, he can sit with me. Right, John?”
John stopped in his tracks as he heard the angry shout in the corridors. It wasn’t a voice he recognised but there was no doubt in him that it meant trouble. And if the little nudge in his gut was anything to go by… he knew exactly who ‘trouble’ was currently picking on.
Somehow he unknowingly closed the foot of distance apart and he and Sherlock were much much closer than he’d anticipated. Sherlock looked up from the ground and met his eyes, also seeming shocked at how close together they had somehow ended up “I’ll see you… soon then” he murmured, not knowing what else to say but wanting to believe his words were true.
“Happy?” Molly grinned. “I’m over the moon! This is the first time I’ve ever heard you express ACTUAL romantic feelings for another person! Not just
Epilogue will be posted late next week <3!! Thank you so much for reading, commenting and leaving kudos <3<3!!!!!!
“Your disguise is a self-portrait. Trying too hard. No physical response to any male you flirt with. Usually looking for trouble or favors. Blackmail. I’m not interested in helping. Bye now.”
. Sherlock breathed in a harsh breath, prepared to tell John it was fine. That he understood.
“I’m realistic.” Sherlock countered, already spotting another swarm of reporters in the adjoining room.
John was staring at him wide eyed, mouth gaping open and eyebrows completely risen. His pose, however, had not changed a bit. Sherlock quickly surveyed his body, stance and expression.
John shut his book, smiling fondly. “Fine. Let’s do something else. Something to distract that brain” he turned to Sherlock. “Quidditch? Movies?” he paused, turning to grin at Sherlock “Pirates?”
“Hey, John!” Mary called out, once again breaking their tension. “Do you want to come to the lake? I’d love a tour of the outside grounds!” She giggled as if there was something absolutely hilariously charming about what she’d said.
Greg just shrugged, “love has no age, brah”.
“Me too. I’ll take uh- this.” Sherlock reached for a ‘peruvian instant darkness powder’ and handed it to the girl as she approached the counter, eyeing them both suspiciously as if they would suddenly just grab each other and start groping again. John didn’t blame her. It was what he really wanted to do, anyway.
At this point they had been dating for about 5 months and living together 3 of those. John had kept modelling for Sherlock both in and out of school, less in school now that the students knew about them and neither wanted to be accidentally caught in any sort of compromising position again. The transition into living together had been quite simple, they just… fit. And with every passing day John was more and more sure about one thing…
The blonde hurried over, trying hard not to make noise, less he attract Filch’s attention, or worse, that toothy plant over in the corner. “What is it?” John came and stooped down next to the Beauxbatons.
ready now?” called out John, for what felt like the umpteenth time. Sherlock had been trying out every single suit in his closet for the past hour. The artist had insisted for months that his solo gallery wasn’t quite
Sherlock perfectly understood what he wanted from John. And John knew exactly what he felt for the Beauxbatons.
“Yes,” Mycroft responded, still surveying the model. He let go of his hand. “I have been looking forward to this meeting Dr. Watson. Apologies for the delay. Sherlock is rather irritable when it comes to his apartment and I had to do a background check on you first.”
“What. The. HELL. Is going on here?”  Sherringford deadpanned. Both boys turned to look at him, feeling exposed and vulnerable. John had only seen Sherlock’s father looking like that this time last year when he’d seen him yell at Eliza.
“You WISH! By the end of the month, I’ll have you begging for mercy. TWICE” John grinned.
true friend.”
“Tea..” He said “Butterbeer...summer...broomstick wood...grass… it’s.. J-”
“Welcome to the newly renovated Ollivander’s! Let’s find you a wand!”
Momentarily storing away the gorgeous memory of John calling him ‘love’, Sherlock smiled. This boy.. this man… cared so much about him. And Sherlock knew the chances of getting his father away from his family and finally get rid of him for good were slim but somehow- he believed John. He beamed at this impossible boy in front of him and knew he trusted him… he trusted him when he said everything would be okay.
The professor huffed, frustrated. “Well, it’s not like he was very obvious either… was he?” he shook his head again “I’m sure he regrets it”
They both separated with a soft wet sound and whipped their heads around towards the source of the voice.
John didn’t look so convinced. “What do you even need a tranquillizer draught for?”
“Winter break? It’s like a month away”
Sherlock’s face changed immediately, from anger to shock and finally concern. He jumped out of his seat and rushed to his mother’s side. “I’m sorry… I’m so sorry” he hugged her tightly to himself, only prompting more sobs to escape from his mother. She hid her face on his chest.
He was standing at the window in the Gryffindor common room, watching in the outside grounds as Sherlock walked alongside what was no doubt his Quidditch team towards the pitch. His heart dropped a little in his stomach as he pictures himself walking alongside them, maybe brushing his arm against Sherlock every other step… or even better, holding his hand in his, lacing their fingers together softly.
And now a week later, John found himself smack in the middle of the strangest place he had ever seen.
Professor Septima scowled as the student behind her struggled “I have a student here that believes himself too good for Arithmancy and has been non-stop complaining that your class is full and he has no reason to be in mine. I beg of you, Sybill. Take him off my hands.” She sounded so exhausted.
“Ah. I’m sure that’s it” Sherlock chuckled leaning down into John for a long kiss.
was Mycroft and he had taken more than 20 seconds, a very slow pace for the annoyingly big brain his brother had.
John looked around himself and found peace in the now familiar streets of Diagon Alley. Except now he wasn’t here to accompany his sister. He wasn’t here as an outsider, looking in and wondering how it felt to be on the inside. He was here as one of them. He looked around himself again, just basking in the sight of the shops, the witches and wizards walking in and out, cloaks fluttering around their ankles as they went about their day, oblivious to John’s bursting heart, the excitement swirling high in his stomach. All this wonder around him. All this magic.
“Why?”
She stopped in her tracks and turned around with a big grin on her faces at the sound of his voice. “John!” Molly cried “Greg!”. Greg proceeded to engulf her in a massive hug “There you are! I was looking for you two! Greg…. Greg…. I can’t breathe” she choked out, smiling despite herself.
John’s head turned minusculely, almost imperceptible to anyone other than Sherlock. He smiled inquisitively “It
Sherlock had stared. And John had stared right back.
houses-“
As the need for
John forgot completely about his leg, the pain and at the end of class when he and Sherlock keep talking even after everyone has left and they leave class together… he forgot his cane.
“I’m not at a LOSS! I’m just… he doesn’t. I mean we don’t- we’re not like that. I don’t even know if he’d be into me like that is what I mean.” John shrugged miserably.
Sherlock stared at his last one. He.. did not intend to write that. He frowned and erased it quickly as if he was being observed. He shook his head and placed his pencil back on the paper to keep on writing his observations on John
He looked back to his page. This room was far too hot. Wasn’t the air conditioning on?
They read in comfortable silence for a while. Well, John tried his hardest to read, willing himself not to be distracted by Sherlock’s profile against the afternoon sun. Every once in a while a dry leaf would flutter down from the highest branches and get stuck in the Beauxbaton’s unruly curls and John would have to physically restrain himself from picking out the orange intruder from the soft fluffy locks. It reminded him of that day so many years ago when he’d been twisting purple blooms into his friend’s hair the day he’d gotten magic. How very easy everything had seemed back then. He hadn’t even overthought the implications of anything he ever did around Sherlock. How could he? When they’d been so young and had nothing but trust and affection was between them. Now they were grown up and John… was unsure. He feared over these boundaries the years apart and their age and societal rules had suddenly built between them. He frowned, staring at one of the most offensive leaves in his friend’s hair. It was pointy and long and just short of brushing his pale neck and heck if John didn’t want to curl his fingers in Sherlock’s nape and scoop it out.
“Ah ha!” Mrs. Hudson cheered “I knew it!” she grinned up at Sherlock’s scowling expression. “So do you like him? Are you seeing him again?” she enthused, clapping her hands together in delight.
John was so glad for the cold weather for a moment, as it masked his full body shiver when Sherlock reached for both of his hands and began to skate backwards, pulling John with him. “That’s pretty good, one foot after another, but bend your knees a little bit to balance the weight. Since we don’t have normal skates you have to keep your feet perfectly flat when you bear down, or they’ll wobble.” He turned, John following hips tilting as he bent his body to follow Sherlock’s swerving movements.
John opened his mouth to answer when they heard a voice coming towards them. “Hey, John! Sherlock!” Molly waved. She hurried over to the Gryffindor table and sat across from them, setting her large Ancient Runes book on the table with a soft thump. “You guys ready for winter finals? I seriously can’t wait for this break.”
He buried his face in his hands and breathed slowly, just like his therapist had told him to countless times. She, of course, had been talking about therapeutic ways to calm himself down after waking up from one of his many PTSD nightmares, but John assumed that his racing heart and ringing ears were signs of an oncoming panic attack so he kept going.
But oh… those lips.
Even with the promise that Sherlock would show up to breakfast, John was still unsure that the Beauxbatons actually would. The thought of him hanging around Hogwarts grounds was still quite perplexing and frankly… bordering on surreal. It seemed as if their time spent in childhood together was another life, a separate universe to the one they were currently living in. Not that John wasn’t over the moon to see Sherlock again. But there still were so many things unsaid between them. So much tension and he didn’t even know where to begin searching for its origin. Of course, there were the unanswered questions, and the barriers age had made them both build around themselves unlike to the openness of childhood friendships. But there was something else too… something electric that thrummed between them. Something John sensed whenever Sherlock looked at him or brushed by him. But he couldn’t understand the effect it had on him… it had never happened before when they were kids… had it?
Just in time, the classroom door opened and John walked in. No cane. Not even in hand for an emergency. John was already smiling, which pleased Sherlock immensely, and the moment he closed the door behind himself he turned to catch Sherlock’s eye. “Hello!” he beamed.
“What are you up to? I didn’t see you at breakfast”, he tried to sound like he hadn’t been obsessing over that the whole day but was pretty sure Sherlock could see it plainly in his face anyway.
He knew he should have been paying more attention, but he couldn’t. Irene was now looking intently at Sherlock and slowly closing the book in his hands to put it aside. Her slender body was turning completely towards him and he could see her talking
They talked for a while, the students expressed their regret at not having figure drawing lessons with Sherlock anymore, something the artist had to admit to himself was rather sweet and flattering. By the end of the year
John shook his head, not comprehending how Sherlock could possibly think he would disapprove of these amazing pieces of art.
. He just needed that last little push to give in.
“Seems like an obvious case of suicide here. The tapes are obviously some sort of twin or man that just happened to resemble him.” A man’s voice resounded behind them.
“So wait wait.. you’re saying. I saw a man carrying the egg of a man-eating spider today!?” John cried, throwing his arms up in exclamation and attracting a couple of shocked stares from the witches and wizards passing by them in the dimly lit streets of Diagon Alley.
“You’re on” John deadpanned, excitement shimmering in his eyes.
John stayed glued to his chair. Every nerve in his body begged him to go after Sherlock. To say… something, anything. But he couldn’t move. “Eliza… I… How?”
She laughed “Oh Sherlock. Fine, I’ll leave you to it then. Let me know if you get hungry later, I’ll make you some casserole.” She smiled at him and closed the door behind her as she left.
But, now that he thought about it the absolute
John’s heart skipped a beat, and he felt his eyes widen. The jealous knot untangling and being replaced with fluttering warmth and hope. “Oh… right. That’s fine”
, hovering uncertainly.
He was currently pacing around John frantically, hands steepled under his chin in a classic Sherlock pose, fingers slightly longer than John remembered but still quite small. They were in the centre of the garden, surrounded by the vast array of colourful flowers Eliza tended with love and care and the trees they often lazed beneath.
“No! Eliza… I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have.. I don’t know what came over me”
Eliza looked at him concernedly... almost ashamed. “I don’t… I know that he … it's just…”
John snorted “It still hurts”
His name. Sherlock’s address… this was definitely
He scrambled for something else to say, anything to fix this, but came up empty handed. He looked down at his feet, almost expecting John to dismiss him.
Molly’s brow furrowed in confusion, “Then who? Ugh! Greg stop eating so fast you’re gonna hurt yourself!”.
Sorry this took so long- I think we all needed some time to absorb TFP and collect ourselves again :)
Once he was back home Sherlock dropped his bag carelessly onto the couch and fast walked onto his studio. He opened up his nearest sketchbook with painting ideas and the very first pencil he could get his hands on. The second his pencil hit the page Sherlock’s hand moved effortlessly through the page, barely stopping to think and never retracing his lines.
Theyre so in love already. I hate them.
thought Sherlock
By the end of the class, Sherlock had had nothing more than silent contact between himself and John. To be fair he’d seen the blonde looking at him all throughout the class, especially in the second half of the day when he had taken out an easel and had joined his student for the last couple of poses of the day. Unspoken acknowledgement of the last time Sherlock had drawn him was communicated in looks and appreciative glances down each of their bodies.
any longer!”
He just gaped for a moment before making a mental note to slip that last one into his jacket pocket before Sherlock could do anything rash and followed.
John shrugged “It sounds bad but... it wasn’t hard to leave. My parents died a couple of months before I enlisted and my older sister and I... we’ve had our differences in the past. She didn’t miss me I’m sure. Barely calls me even now.” John frowned but then shook himself, as if dismissing a thought “But what about you? Do you have siblings?”
“NO” Sherlock snapped, taking a step back as John reached closer and closer, taking tentative steps against the mossy surface of the wooden roof.
“He left instantly after! He probably regrets it! He didn’t even let me reciprocate” Sherlock exploded. He hadn’t said the words out loud since John had left, not even to himself. He had mostly kept quiet for the past days, much to the concern of Mrs. Hudson.
YAY! So this was fun. I hope it was at least somewhat enjoyable :)
“You studied here? That’s amazing! No wonder you're such a great artist. I bet you were an honour student”
John grinned right back, excitement bursting in his belly “Sounds like a plausible theory.” He stood up in front of Sherlock, steeling himself for whatever crazy experiments Sherlock was willing to try. “Where do we start?”
He looked around himself finding somewhere to sit when McGonagall directed him to one of the tables. He searched the tables and then… icy blue eyes found a head of familiar blond hair, turned away from him and towards another boy. His heart skipped several beats as his eyes widened.
Sherlock nodded in agreement.
John continued, “I told her about how we met and that we uh- that we are… well.” Sherlock leaned forward, clinging to John’s every word, “She caught on and stopped the flirting, definitely didn’t seem jealous or anything. I told her I wanted to take you out but that I didn’t know many restaurants around the area and she mentioned the case with Angelo. She said that you had mentioned you liked Italian food” he smiled “and offered to show me some places. So I passed her my phone and she showed we this place, and… voila!”. John covered their linked hand with his free one, effectively enshrouding Sherlock’s hand in solid, comforting warmth.
“I..” he stumbled out, “I told you you’d be a Gryffindor”.
“Yeah. Yeah. I’m fine” the boy said. “Just… anxious, I guess” he shrugged.
“Excellent observation of the distance between the shoulder blades Janine” he turned his head to another. “Mary, as much as John wished this were true, his abdominal muscles are clearly not as defined and perfectly squared as you drew them here. He has a bit of a pudge down here."
“3 times a day!?” That was just scandalous. How could anyone eat more than once every few days? “John! N-“
“Muggles have potions? You hadn’t mentioned this before”
“Yup. Perfectly fine. Why wouldn’t I be?”
“Oh uh… yeah” John shrugged. He took a seat next to his friend and tried not to seem distracted or disappointed as he started loading pancakes and scrambled eggs onto his plate.
She narrowed her eyes “You like someone. Don’t you?” Sherlock opened his mouth to deny it but she wasn’t having it “Admit it. What happened? Is he straight? Married? A serial killer? All above?”
“Well they matched the staircase the killer had used to get to the third floor so clearly the only logical conclusion” Sherlock smiled.
He saw the boy look at him closely, eyes shifting and taking everything in before exclaiming “Oh! You’re muggle born!”
“This Beauxbatons guy that I-“
Sherlock potion has just begun to turn the apparently desired pearly white-lilac when suddenly hoots and flaps of wings could be heard from above.
“Amortentia” answered Sherlock instantly, without taking his eyes off John.
This seemed to please the Beauxbatons as he returned to squeeze with his own fingers. “Yeah... I guess it’s still pretty new and… exciting”. He ducked his head again, shyly looking at his feet insistently.
“We are! But... I dunno. How well can a friendship be when there are… unfinished things. Or unspoken things.”
As soon as the bell rang Sherlock stood from his seat as if he was in a race. He started smashing every piece of material he’d gotten out of his bag back into it carelessly.
He forced the most natural smiles he could to the reporters and answered some of their predictable and boring questions, tuning out most of his own answer and answering automatically. It wasn’t as if he hated the gallery, he was in fact quite excited to show his work to the public and the turn-out had been rather good. But he disliked the overwhelming amount of attention, the inane questions and the necessary interaction with people, the necessity to be… liked.
This time, the answer was almost instant.
“Hah! You wish Holmes! But hey, I seriously have to go write that essay. But tomorrow after school. You. Me. Quidditch.” He looked at Sherlock pointedly as he stood up, potion books cradled under his arm.
The urge not to reach for Sherlock’s hand was becoming positively maddening. He clenched his fingers a couple of times, wondering how his friend would react if he just… If he JUST-
Because Sherlock
“I knew it!” Greg muttered, shoving him teasingly with his arm.
The next couple of hours were spent at a lab at St. Bart’s. John helped Sherlock with anything he could, but mostly just sat there and stared at the other man’s exquisite face as he was deeply concentrated in the blood samples and whatever else he was researching on his laptop (John
That stopped him in his tracks. He instantly thought of Irene and how Sherlock must have been overwhelmed by her smell coming from the potion.
Why would he even be thinking about him? That made no sense whatsoever. So what if he had a socially deemed “good” body? That did not mean that Sherlock had to be attracted to him, he thought. Sherlock’s hands, however, were now caressing his chest, inching down slowly. But no, the fact that John was attractive most certainly did not mean that Sherlock would in any way be affected by the way he talked, smiled or moved his body effortlessly. And… Sherlock licked his lips, trying his best not to go down that path… so what if John’s cock was… significantly above average in size? That made absolutely no difference whatsoever.
John laughed as best as he could around his panting breaths, his head tipped up to give the artist better access to his pulse point and hands grabbing the man possessively around the hips.
“I’m so sorry Sherlock” she whispered, tears streaming down her cheeks.
Eliza Holmes treated John as if he was one of her own children, taking to cutting his hair herself after Sherlock had attempted to do so (with
John sighed, laying down on his bed but leaving the curtain open so he could see when Gladstone came back. He stared up at the ceiling, trying not to panic too much about Sherlock’s response. If there was one at all, anyway.
He took an exasperated breath and shaking his head he followed the voice. And if his pace was hurried and bordering on mildly desperate well that was just because it was his time on duty and clearly he was the closest Prefect around. Obviously.
One of the flower pots exploded behind Sherringford, causing him to startle and jump away from Eliza who’s head snapped in alarm at the sound. The flowers inside fell, some onto the ground and some onto the sink, covering everything in roots, petals, and soil. Sherringford snapped his head towards the door, spotting John for the first time. He glared, first at John and then at Eliza, finally standing up straight before walking out of the kitchen, shoving John unceremoniously out of the way. John stumbled, but glared right back at him, not backing down.
“Do you want to move in?” Sherlock rushed out, not even pretending to go on leading conversation towards it. He had been thinking about this for a while. Whilst he and John had only been in a relationship for 2 months it only made sense. They spent most nights together at his flat, or John’s and both agreed that whatever nights they did not, were unpleasant.  He had thought of asking earlier but had been afraid he was moving too fast, but now right after John’s jealousy over him, he felt safer to ask.
“Who the hell are you?” Anderson laughed. “Leave now. Or regret it blondie”. He grinned, looking pleased with himself. His other two friends didn’t look as sure, already backing away from John’s glare.
. The short boy John had come to know had been stripped away for mile long legs and a thin long lean frame, the chubby pink cheeks had sunk into perfectly sculpted cheekbones. Even his neck seemed to have stretched into this pale long structure so gorgeous John had to physically force himself to tear his gaze away from to follow the eyes he knew he would find hiding beneath the array of dark curls... and Christ those eyes.
“Irene!” Molly exclaimed happily as the woman started arranging the light on her own platform.
After a disastrous potions lesson, where John may or may not have accidentally set his robe on fire, he decided he should get started with his homework for that class as soon as possible. After all, he better get on Professor Slughorn’s good side if he wanted a good recommendation letter for St. Mungo’s hospital after graduation next year. He had very good contacts with some of the healers, as some were his ex-students and members of his club.
One night in particular sprung to mind, months and months ago…
“I took John around Diagon Alley to look at the shopth and explain magic.” Sherlock shrugged, straightening himself to try to make himself appear taller. “John’th a muggle born, older magical thibling”
John grinned “Come on then, Greg. We don’t want to get left behind”
“Well I think you should. Lord knows I’ve never seen you bring anyone over, aside from that brother and the detective inspector once in a while. And oh my goodness you need someone to take care of you! Feed you up! Aside from myself of course, but I’m not going to be here forever. At my time of life..”
“Mr.Holmes, could you come to the front of the class?” He smiled encouraging, clearly purposely ignoring John’s insults and pretending he’d heard nothing.
“Twice” John assured him, clicking his fingers.
John was not jealous. He didn’t know why exactly he kept assuring himself that he wasn’t and he wouldn’t admit to having feeling a bit… off for the last couple of days. But he was not jealous, he decided as he fiddled aggressively with his firebolt, a birthday gift from Sherlock, as he waited for Greg to finish changing into his red and golden robes before their Quidditch practice...most certainly not thinking about Sherlock. Not one bit.
a “Quidditch”. John smiled, instantly wanting to know everything he could from this strange world lying just under everyone’s noses. He caressed the covers as he passed reading them as fast as he could.
Some part of Sherlock’s mind recognised his brother’s voice and couldn’t feel anything but severely annoyed with him. Because… Had John just… what was that? Why was his heart hammering against his ribs? Why was he so suddenly nervous and why did he suddenly feel so warm? So so warm inside and-
Sherlock found that in a single facial expression he could depict the entire family history of a  heartbroken widow he had observed on the street. With a smoothly downturned collar and mismatched tie he drew on a middle-aged man he could represent an entire career in business and recent marriage problems. Sherlock came to realize that a way to make his mind stop buzzing with the overload of knowledge he could perceive in every passing stranger was to let it all out. He let out the deductions and experiences into pictures, images, sketches, silhouettes and paintings.
“Hey, you,” John said cheerfully, as he took a seat next to Sherlock. He sat just a teensy bit closer than necessary, but really who was going to blame him when he found the gorgeous Beauxbatons sitting in the Gryffindor breakfast table, clearly waiting for him.
John nodded “I know what you mean. I thought life after school would be brilliant. Then when I realized I couldn’t pay for med school, army doctor just made sense to me. I never even thought about the real chance that I could get hurt.” He shrugged “guess everything happens for a reason, though.”
“Maybe... maybe, this time it will be different” he whispered, rubbing a soothing thumb against one of the blonde’s pectorals.
“Sort of like when there is a trial at the ministry but-“Molly shook her head, dismissing that trail of thought, “Muggle thing Greg, it doesn’t matter. The POINT here is… John. Are you okay?”
The painting of the woman, now completely finished, hung beside him on the wall next to his collection of paintings for his upcoming solo gallery. It wasn’t an enormous event but it
The model pulled away from his attack on the professor’s neck long enough for his lover to whine in protest, but also long enough to see where Sherlock’s zipper was pushing out, tenting his pants so he could tug it down, needing to see Sherlock
Sherlock scoffed lightly “Hardly. There’s got to be a logical explanation.” The soft huff of John’s muffled giggle followed him and Sherlock’s spirit’s rose a fragment.
“Sherlock! Oh shit! Are you okay?!” John sat up, rubbing his hip and wincing but looking at Sherlock with concern.
“The phone call... in class earlier today. What was that about?” He recalled John becoming upset and thinking it was about Sarah, but now after having obviously dismissed the thought due to the overwhelming amount of contradictory information he had no idea what could have possibly made John react like that. He probably could have deduced it any other time but right now in the sleepy after moments his mind was still mostly at rest, as if he had painted John for hours and hours on end.
“Oh,” John sounded uncomfortable. “It was... It was my sister. Harry. I had invited her to have lunch so she could meet you this Saturday. We hadn’t seen in other in ages but... I wanted her to know you and you, her. Whether I want it or not she’s a part of my life and I care about her…”
He looked down onto the ground and the mattress John had set out for him. “Right” he breathed in. He looked down, gulping. John stood beside him, clutching the branch of a massive tree where the house had been built on. “Are you sure about this Sherlock? You… don’t seem too sure”
Instead of acting offended, however, John just chuckled and stood up onto the platform “Aye aye!” he said cheerily, untying his robe and letting it fall to the ground. He shifted a couple of times, testing out poses before he picked one where he was leaning onto his more stable leg, bending one arm behind his band as if in an armlock and twisting the other one upwards into his hair.
“Broken arm. 3 broken ribs. Concussion. I’m afraid that whilst I did stop the fall I might’ve smashed us both into the bottom of the Ravenclaw post…” Sherlock said with a weak smile.
“Victor Trevor. Art critic for the Belgravia newspaper” he stretched out his hand expectantly, not taking his eyes away from Sherlock’s neck.
John laughed “Oh my goodness you’re hopeless”
The artist could’ve sworn he saw John’s lip curl up, he cleared his throat and straightened his posture.
The man, Angelo, let go of the box of sweets he had been holding but to John’s surprise, held it up again by pointing a wand at it and with a flick of his wrist sent it flying neatly into a small space in the shelves between two identical boxes.
“The smug look on your face,” said Sherlock. “Do you really think your team stands a chance against mine?”. He turned a page, seeming disinterested.
“John” Sherlock gasped “Please. Now” he breathed, still shuddering helpless and arching toward John, bearing down on the breaching fingers harshly, needing more.
“You.. should probably get out there” Sherlock smiled. “And..” he hesitated for a second “Be careful” he finished.
The artist didn’t even attempt to tame down the grin that instantly pulled at his lips.
John straightened up and tried to clear his head of all the overwhelming emotions he was having. He had to find Sherlock. Now.
But then, just when John was tempted to either call his boss over at the agency and quit or throw it completely out of the window so he could not be contacted, there was a knock at the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mycroft had stopped reading. Sherlock didn’t know if it was because every sound had faded into the background into white noise and he too had noticed or if he’d finally shut up from his muttering about his potions homework.
“What house do you think you’ll be in?” Greg whispered just as Phillip Anderson was sorted into Slytherin.
No need to tell
Sherlock chuckled, not believing her for a second and taking a bite of one of the sandwiches.
The loud screams of joy and exhilaration scared McGonagall’s owl away.
Sherlock laughed and laughed, tears started to trickle down his face and John could stop the giggles from rising up his throat and joining him.
John snorted “Well, clearly not
John never asked for a chair.
“No!” John was still laughing, not doubting for one second that Sherlock hadn’t spent his first day at Beauxbatons breaking every rule he could possibly think of at the age of 11.
Sherlock smirked “I just observed” he shrugged
Just as the first cold touch of John’s lube coated fingers probed against his entrance, the blonde sucked hard on the artist’s cock, effectively distracting him from the initial discomfort. Sherlock tightened his hold on John’s hair, gasping panting breaths and doing his best not to thrust up into the warm heat surrounding him. John just lowered himself even more, taking as much of Sherlock as he could without gagging and bobbing his head back up in rhythmic sucks.
“Sherlock! Darling, we’ve been waiting for you! Where have you been?”
(See the end of the chapter for
you. I could’ve TOTALLY caught the snitch!” John grinned.
“Stopstopstop! You’re gonna cut off our circulation!”
I will be taking out the spaces later on today-- but I just couldnt wait to post the chapter any longer <3<3
.  Eliza looked shocked herself. She took her husband by the arm and tried to pull him towards her. “Darling. Please…”
The past five summers spent without John’s warm and familiar company had been the absolute worst ones Sherlock could remember. Not to mention, every single rotten day of attending The Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.
the artist couldn’t help when they rose and clogged his throat closed as his breaths became shallower and he blinked rapidly, watching John thank this woman with a wide grin. She beamed back at him, clearly pleased with herself.
What must Sherlock think of him now... This pathetic ex-soldier who he had helped get over his psychosomatic limp and had now gotten attached to him like some pitiful leech. It wasn’t like someone as ethereally beautiful as Sherlock could possibly even consider John as a romantic partner. John was sure that the raven haired beauty could have quite literally, anyone he desired. John didn’t even know if the man was attracted to men or not and he had just claimed his lips as if he had had any right to do so.
He grinned up at the books and tentatively raised a hand waiting to see if any book approached his extended fingers but no books vibrated with hesitation or temptation to his waiting hand and John snorted, knowing it wouldn’t work but amused at the fact that it was like the books themselves knew exactly what to do and where to go. He raised himself on his tiptoes and tried again.
As they walked in, hand in hand, they were instantly met by a chorus of “Mr. Holmes! John! Over here!”
Sherlock mutely nodded.
“Hahaha! John! Hahahaha! Stopstopstop!”
Sherlock bit his lip, his heart thundering against his chest. He couldn’t say anything, afraid he’d be wrong or had somehow misunderstood. Because somehow it sounded like John… like John meant that…. It couldn’t be that he actually meant to sound like he... Sherlock cleared his throat, saying the first words that came to mind, “because… because you're an idiot?”.
“We’re going to start this with the standing 30-minute poses. Please choose a comfortable position and try not to move too much” he instructed coldly, barely even looking in his direction. Just because this particular model had somehow captured his attention that did not mean that by any means he would treat him any different than the other models.
“Hi, you,” he whispered. And quickly leant in to place another soft kiss on Sherlock’s parted, equally kissed-red and wet lips. “Was this… okay?”
John looked away quickly, feeling his cheeks heat up and his heartbeat stutter. When had Sherlock gotten so… different? He cleared his throat and looked back at the Beauxbatons, keeping himself as calm as he could. “So… we should do this again sometime,” he said softly.
And then the world swirled around and everything went black.
. It was all hormones. Love was nothing but a chemical defect and a weakness.
“Yes sir,” they all said, some still grinning, others having the decency to look at the very least slightly guilty. They all rushed out, already whispering excitedly amongst each other, Molly looked back and smiled at him widely.
“I could give you a full school tour in the dark!” Sherlock grinned, pulling up the keys in front of John.
Dinner, in turn, gave Sherlock another brilliant idea.
That’s how things went for a while. They talked, played Quidditch, ate breakfast together on occasion and took their divination classes together. But John couldn’t really see himself getting as close to Sherlock as they used to be. It was as if there was some sort of barrier there. And it wasn’t that hard to figure out what it was… they hadn’t talked bout their time apart. They’d talked about what they’d been up to, sure. But they hadn’t talked about
He then turned towards his friend again but the fragile moment they had had shattered, although it lingered in the background, a soft promise of later.
“So Mr.Holmes, is it?” Trelawney asked, completely shattering the moment of frozen disbelief both boys had been trapped in. Sherlock tore his eyes away from John’s, “Er.. yes. Yes. Sherlock… is fine” he said, his voice wavering slightly as he straightened himself up.
“Hey, John! Why aren’t you sitting? Why are you shaking?” Mike suddenly looked concerned. “Is this about the match? Cause I’m pretty sure we can take ‘em! You better have some breakfast though the match is in like 20 minutes… John?” Mike raised an eyebrow noticing John was staring at empty space in the Great hall door.
The blonde grinned up at him, eyes twinkling. “Well then. Let’s enjoy each other’s company. I hear the lasagna here is to die for”.
He followed John downstairs to get a cab, fingers twitching with the effort of holding himself back from grabbing him and kissing him.
John stopped, heart in his throat as he turned to the sound of Sherlock’s voice.
Heart in his throat Sherlock continued with the class, already having ideas on how to bring John back to his place afterward and maybe sitting down to talk. He wasn’t too keen on it but it was important.
Lestrade stammered out the address, startled by the artist’s urgency and Sherlock jotted it on the blank page in front of him. He hadn’t been able to draw anything at all during the last couple of hours. No wonder Irene had been concerned. He finished scribbling down the address and promptly hung up on Lestrade before he could say anything else.
“Irene’s alright.  The student’s like her well enough” Sherlock shrugged.
Not that John noticed… Or cared.
Sherlock chuckled “As much as I know you’d love to hear that I’m actually serio-"
John laughed “Jesus you fall off a broom ONE time”
“I wonder,” Trevor said “If perhaps you could paint me sometime. I could… pose for you for hours. I’m sure you’d do a splendorous job” he started walking slowly around the room, Sherlock forced to follow, swallowing down his perplexed replies but Trevor just continued talking.
.” He smiled down at Sherlock who still had uncertainty shimmering in his grey-blue eyes. “Come on. Sit up” John said.
So he’d been right. Sherlock was avoiding him.  He’d just gotten up and left. Ran off on John without a word. Again.
“John” he breathed “kiss me. Please”
But he was gone. The space empty; as if he hadn’t been there at all, to begin with.
Sherlock huffed “Well… shut up”
Everyone stared at him in silence, eyes wide.
“Thanks, Cap” he muttered.
It was 12 minutes after the first whistle and Beauxbatons was up by 20 points. The Hogwarts Gryffindor team was proving to be a challenge, but Sherlock was feeling good about their chances. He risked a glance at the Gryffindor seeker, Sarah… something… Astley?, but she was flying laps above the figures of her teammates, oblivious to the snitch fluttering about. Sherlock moved rapidly, but cautiously. Sekeers’ worst mistake was to panic when they saw the tell-tale flash of gold. He wouldn’t speed until he was sure and until he was certain he was close enough not to alert the other Seeker.
The boy’s rosy cheeks darkened into a fierce red and he quickly looked down and mumbled a “thankth” clearly he wasn’t very used to receiving compliments. John’s smile grew wider, feeling an unexplainable fondness for the smaller boy. “I’m John, by the way. John Watson” he extended his hand, as he’d seen his father do when meeting new people.
? What in the bloody Merlin is that?”
“John. My…”
A new image of John for a new painting.
“Sherlock?” John asked quietly, the tone of the conversation going from casual to oddly intimate and charged in a second.
John smiled and followed the path of Sherlock’s tongue across his lower lip, his pupils dilating, “Good”, he replied.
Sherlock grinned, standing up “Exactly” he turned back to look at Lestrade.
“I have the tapes here on my phone. The first one is him after he arrived at the hotel. The second is him leaving. There was no sign of him coming back at all.”
The last summer before they entered Hogwarts was one that would remain present in John’s mind for the rest of his life.
“What have pillow fights? Or
John hummed, biting down on Sherlock’s sweet collarbone and kissing down his chest. He lightly dipped his tongue into Sherlock’s bellybutton, loving how his chest expanded and contracted up and down, showing off all the gorgeous little love bites John had speckled around the pale white skin. He reached down the V muscles between Sherlock’s hips and caressed the soft beginnings of pubic hair below, shifting down on the bed and watching Sherlock for any signs of hesitation.
Then he caught sight of John.
“You know, if you stopped thinking about your leg it would stop most of the pain. Focusing on it is not helping”.
Thanks so much for reading and commenting <3<3<3
“No… I guess not” Sherlock murmured as John giggled. He finally raised his mouth to John’s waiting lips and kissed him slow and soft, tongues meeting and gliding together in a familiar and soothing way.
Just that second a massive flash of lightning ignited the clouds above them, and a groan of thunder startled John into holding his broom with both hands, almost losing his balance.
“Yeah” he whispered, his voice struggling to climb out of his throat as it clogged with too many emotions. “We- yeah…  we're boyfriends”.
Once they arrived at the castle and entered the Great Hall they took their usual seats at the far end of the Gryffindor table.
“Yes. But I always have to write first for you to respond. And what if it's an emergency?”
“Oh shit” John hissed, seeming much more preoccupied on the drawing than Sherlock now, much to the artist’s amusement. Soon enough his tongue was poking out of his mouth as he frowned at his drawing in complete focus.
“Your mother called dear. Said you haven’t called her in ages!” she tutted at him
“Look at this. This is preposterous. I’ve been telling you for almost two months that you do NOT separate the pencil from the paper. CONTINUOUS LINE. This is the only way to measure. Look at this elephant head you’ve given poor John”
Said muse was behind him, waiting for the interviews to be done. Sherlock turned to look at him, almost pleading for rescue but john just laughed discretely and shot a fond smile. He then motioned to his empty wine glass and made a questioning tilt of his head to which the artist nodded enthusiastically, much to the model’s amusement. Sherlock turned back to the reporters as John went to get them yet another drink (wine as courtesy from the gallery space, much to Sherlock’s delight as he didn’t believe he could have survived this night without alcohol… and John) and did his best to focus.
They had stayed laying on the mattress for long hours, Sherlock’s ragged panicked breaths eventually slowed down until he had fallen asleep under the midday breeze and the shade of the treehouse he and John played in every summer.
“This room is incredible” John sighed, looking up at the dome above them. Stars were beginning to peak out from beneath the darkening night. He was sure he had never seen such a vast amount of stars in the city. But, of course, Sherlock would know the one place to see them.
.” Glorious John Watson stepped beside Sherlock, making a point of wrapping a possessive arm tightly against his waist. The critic instantly took a step back, faced with the strong presence of the blonde.
?” Sherlock whispered, his voice cracking. He removed his hands from his mother’s shoulders, his eyes widening in shock. “I….no…..
“Thank you, John… I don’t know what will happen. But I trust you. I just hope he doesn’t find out I’m here with you. Or that he finds out we’re… uh… you know”
Sherlock grimaced when the back of his head smashed loudly against the stone wall behind him. “Not my fault you’re cheating on Sally, Anderson. Or that you don’t even bother to change when you’ve clearly got this new girl’s perfume all over yourself.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh. Of course”
John shook his head in disbelief and joy. They stared at each other smiling just a moment too long, the moment stretched and lingered as they both unwillingly had to look away. Sherlock felt his heart racing and the need to say something, anything, not to make John go away rose up painfully inside of him.
A little while later he climbed up the steps slowly in search for Sherlock. His eyes were still stinging with tears but he forced himself to be brave for his friend. Unsurprisingly, the door was closed. John tried to open it but it was locked too. He knocked. Only silence followed.
Greg raised an eyebrow, knowing there was more to it by the worried look on John’s face, but let it drop and followed his Quidditch captain through the dark hallway leading to the Quidditch field where the rest of the team was chatting with some Gryffindor girls that had come to watch the practice. After all, getting the captain annoyed certainly wasn’t on his list of favorite things to do. John was the nicest person he knew when he was happy but when he got mad.. well Greg shuddered just thinking about it. He certainly did not envy Sherlock and whatever it was he had done to make John upset.
“How’re you doing?” John asked quietly. It was a good cover up, the silence. It meant John definitely had to whisper, which only aided in his intent on teasing Sherlock into a flustered mess. John felt his friend shiver beneath him as he felt John’s warm soft breath fan against his exposed neck.
Sherlock’s first gallery all to himself so he intended it to be absolutely perfect.
“That’s the fascinating part” Sherlock grinned up at him. “I have 3 theories…”
Sherlock nodded softly, sipping his tea “I’d say so, yes. She always understood much better than anyone else.”
Suddenly hyper-aware that he was still hugging John again Sherlock stiffened. Realising how long the hug had been going on and wondering if it was still in the socially acceptable range he let go of him, embarrassed and extremely flushed. He cleared his throat and composed his features before tentatively looking up to meet John’s gaze once again, but John was still grinning at him, completely unfazed by Sherlock’s second hug.
“Well some are duller than others but yes. In general, they keep me entertained”
“Sherlock?” John looked anxious now. He caressed his cheekbone gently with the pads of his thumbs, seemingly trying to soothe him but Sherlock only looked more distressed.
John licked his lips and nodded, eyes hungrily trailing down Sherlock’s body, his thumbs slipping into the latter’s tight black boxer briefs and tugging teasingly.
After John left, Sherlock’s mother immediately turned to Sherlock “A whole week? That’s so sweet of you darling!” she stooped down and kissed his chubby cheek soundly “I’m so glad you’ve made a friend. That boy looks like he could use some love” She hugged her son tightly to her as Sherlock frowned a little into her chest ‘
A pair of blue eyes gazing at him.
Flashes of John’s body yesterday passed through his mind. What would it feel like to touch his strong arms? Course a hand through his short blonde hair when wet? Observe water droplets running down his muscular form and getting caught in the crevices of his abdominal muscles…Glancing down Sherlock stared at his forming erection in shock. Well, that was unexpected. Rolling his eyes he did his best to ignore it. After all, it was just transport.
“Oh Sherlock” John moved his hand onto the back of Sherlock’s neck and gently pulled him in. He smiled at him tenderly, leaning in very slowly so Sherlock could make up his mind if this wasn’t something he wanted.
(See the end of the chapter for
Too late, Sherlock was already pulling on the stems and yanking out what looked to be a very ugly turnip-looking baby. There was at least one second where John was relieved by the static silence around them before it started. The screeching.
. Sherlock spasmed against him, wailing loudly in equal parts surprise and pleasure as John pulled him out of his pants and into his rough calloused fingers. Turning his face up again to swallow Sherlock’s groans into his mouth and soothe them with his tongue, John aligned both of their erections together and began to stroke. The wetness gathered from both of their dripping slits was enough to make them slick. “Christ Sherlock, you’re so beautiful…”
Sherlock stumbled, blushing ridiculously fast and looking down at his feet. How was he always so surprised by John’s easy compliments? He mumbled something unintelligible in response.
John grimaced, seriously considering ditching the gamer to go looking for Sherlock and tell him that he felt the same. that he had no reason to worry about John’s reaction because he had always felt the same. Even when he did not realize it Sherlock had always been a priority and like Molly had said.. wherever he was and whatever he was doing he would always rather be with Sherlock. Something his past girlfriends or dates had learned the hard way when Sherlock sent John Patronuses at all hours demanding his company whenever he was on dates. It all just seemed painfully obvious to John now why Sherlock had ONLY sent him Patronuses whilst on dates. The small little white glowing Hedgehog running in mid-flight gracefully around only him, never around Mary or Jeannette.. or was her name Amy? Not important.
“Mate, I’ve known you were head over heels for this guy since the first time you told me about him.”
“Yes, well… I- shut up” muttered Sherlock, getting back into position, Quaffle held safely tucked under his arm and bat on the other, crouching so he could also hold the front end of his broom with the same hand. John held the other Quaffle and bat in a mirror position, flying to his own station gently to prepare for the next round. They’d been at this for a couple of hours, throwing both balls into the air and flying as fast as they could, batting as accurately and hard as they were able to score on each other's hoops and speeding back to protect their own. So far John was winning 150 to 80.
“No Sherlock we need to go!” he reached over to the Beauxbatons and tried to pry the clippers away from him, but one of the cut devil snare limbs tied around his and Sherlock’s wrists.
Sherlock visibly swallowed hard “Right. Perfect. Good”, even with the dim lighting John could see his cheeks flaming. The man was a genius and a tremendously talented artist, and when he wanted to be, he could have a rather sharp and harsh tongue. But there was no denying that the man could be quite adorable.
Things had been…. tense between the two of them since the amortentia disaster and Sherlock felt like John was drawing back and away from him. Or like he was doing that to John. He wasn’t sure. Sherlock hated not knowing. Not knowing what John thought about him anymore, and he hated himself for not being brave enough to tell him what he was really doing with Irene.
Eliza was out of the house so she had left Mycroft in charge. He sat beside them, working on his homework for the holidays, glancing at them once in a while as if they would suddenly burst into flames.
“Mummy…. What’s going on?” he whispered, pleading.
Sherlock hadn’t been too amused after that.
“Don’t,” he said fiercely. “Don’t say it. Don’t even think it. We are going to figure this out, Sherlock.” He sat next to him, pulling his hands away from his face and finding that pair of remarkable icy green-blue eyes wet and surrounded by red rims. “We are going to figure this out,” John repeated, promising him ferociously. His blue eyes shining with determination.
“You. Me. Just.. us. Guess we have to learn to keep our hands to each other in public huh? It’s just so new to me that I can… that I can actually hold you. Touch you. Guess I can't help myself now that I have permission” John said, tightening his hold on Sherlock’s hand.
“We went to the hospital wing but Madam Pomfrey said one visitor at a time and you already had someone there and-”
John just looked more perplexed, taking a few steps forwards to make sure Sherlock was alright.
“Class!” Professor Slughorn called attention, “Professor Flitwick has unfortunately fallen sick and so the sixth year Slytherin’s will be joining our class until further notice. Isn’t that great?” Slughorn boomed, clearly oblivious to the matching grimaces the Ravenclaw’s and Gryffindors wore as they looked upon the malicious faces of Anderson and Sally.
“Oh...fine then… good. Keep going”. John shook his head and tried to focus on the game.
“Yeah…er- You know..” his face was flaming hot by this point,
The students eventually came back, much to Sherlock’s disappointment. John went back to the platform at the centre of the room, but Sherlock could see the reluctance to leave Sherlock’s side, he couldn’t help the tiny smile he gave at the thought.
Sherlock laughed “I’m sure that was exactly it John”. He paused, biting his lip. “I could… if you want. I could play a piece for you?”
He picked up the letter and, turning it over, examined the address line. His shoulders relaxed, clearly having recognised the sender. John peered discreetly only to see a very familiar name jump up at him ‘Violet Holmes’.
When the thought rushed back into Sherlock’s head he straightened up and tried to observe John’s body objectively as to know where to position the lights. He moved the two lower lights and positioned them at his sides to emphasise the toned V shape emerging from John’s thighs and placed one of the overhead ones tilted and directed at the right side of John’s head as to make do with the fascinating bullet scar he could see at the top of the shoulder. That same light also helped bounce through John’s collarbones and his.. various abdominals. Sherlock tried not to think too hard about that one. He tried his best not to clear his throat too obviously, knowing that it would give away at least part of his awkward inner turmoil.
The door opened.
“John” Sherlock whispered as if finishing an unspoken sentence.
Sherlock shrugged, trying to seem nonchalant. “A lookout would be very helpful, and..” he hesitated “I like your company”.
“Tell me… tell me about Afghanistan John” Sherlock whispered, suddenly
“Hello, Mr. Holmes” the woman purred, stopping in front of Sherlock’s desk. “So glad you finally booked me for one of your classes again”
THEY HUGGED <3<3
Said man walked out, modesty robe loosely tied on his hips and Sherlock could’ve sworn the smile he threw his way was filled with hunger.
known all along. Took him long enough to figure it out. Sherlock might be right… he probably WAS an idiot. But now the question was... did Sherlock feel the same? John wasn’t so sure that he did or didn’t. Either way, he thought, still bantering about it with his friends, no harm in some innocent flirting… a tease then and there... a brush of an arm… And John didn’t like to brag but Greg was right. He was pretty damn good at it.
A couple of seconds passed by until they looked at each other and kick-started their laughter once more. John head softly fell to Sherlock’s shoulder, cushioned by the soft blue scarf, and giggled against his neck. He could feel Sherlock’s laughter vibrating on his chest as it pressed against him. Instinctively, John’s hand raised to Sherlock's hip, meaning to push himself up and away. John had just meant to comment on the cold snow that was most likely sneaking up Sherlock’s back as he raised up his body to Sherlock’s when he suddenly realised the position they had found themselves in.
“Without further ado,” the headmistress said, “let us welcome the student and staff from the Beauxbatons Academy!”. The Great Hall gates opened with a swish of her wand and instantly a flurry of blue robed student began trickling in.
This was even worse! It was not possible that he could possibly be developing a little crush on the artist! On the person he was posing naked for! And not just him, an entire classroom filled with students! Firstly, there was no way that Sherlock would be even remotely interested and secondly, it was completely inappropriate to try to seduce the person you work with. And even worse inviting yourself over to their class to do it. No wonder Sherlock had been so shocked. The man could see everything in a person as clear as day and John’s feelings were probably just as transparent.
John’s grin returned in full force. “Good.”
John took a deep breath to settle himself before the game and started running towards the Gryffindor locker room, making his mind up to find Sherlock directly afterward and telling that bastard he loved him too.
“No no, none of that, my boy. I see
The Gryffindor crouched behind one of the heaviest, thickest books and leaned forward to observe, narrowing his eyes in annoyance as Irene shamelessly flirted with Sherlock. She was tossing her hair back and batting her perfectly curled eyelashes, laughing at his cutting and harsh one worded responses and stroking his arm. John was not happy.
“What do you think happened?” He hissed back “He looks terrible!”
Molly gave him a pointed look.
“Sports injury?” Mary murmured, licking her lips and her gaze slipping down to John’s uncovered legs.
John just stared, still glued to his chair. Though it wasn’t like he could just stand in front to the class and demand why Sherlock was here. Why he hadn’t seen or heard from him in 5 years. Why over the course of those years he’d never even bothered to answer one of his-
“Oh my god is that a Dittany plant?! Wait!” Sherlock yanked himself backwards, pulling against John and the vine constricted painfully.
Sherlock stood up from straddling John’s legs in one swift move, managing to only stumble slightly and held out his hand to pull the model up from the ground. John beamed and took it, tugging himself up. The smell of wet paint was pungent in the air and John didn’t know if his dizzy mind was because of it, or due to the fact that now that he was standing he could see the entire expanse of Sherlock’s pale chest and the gorgeous pink blush spreading through it.
“No, no. I wasn’t looking for Mary. It’s nothing really…”
Sherlock hadn’t bothered telling his class that they would be getting John as a model again, and in return, they didn’t bother to pretend they were surprised when the model walked into the room.
“Sorry?”
The blonde stroked his thumbs softly across the small of Sherlock’s back, warmth growing in his chest and his heart beating almost painfully with how much the cared and loved for this man in his arms. The knowledge of how lucky he was, how lucky THEY were to have found each other, resonating in every shared breath, every second of silent communication through their eye contact.
It was a quiet morning in 221b.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?”
John shook himself out of it. A weird feeling was spreading through his chest. An unwanted memory trying to seep through.
“You guys are so cute together!” Janine squealed much to the artist’s mortification.
“Welcome welcome!” a shrill high voice greeted them in. It didn’t take the slightest amount of deductive work to see this was Madame Pudifoot. She seemed all-to-happy to have customers, as there were hardly any other in the shop aside from two pairs of couples at the very back of the room. “What’ll you have dearies? Some tea, or cakes, perhaps? Hmm?”
galleries.” Sherlock said “But there’s so much unnecessary interaction. Look at the art. Buy what you like. Leave. Why do you need to talk to me?”
John smoothed his thumb on the swollen red velvet head of the other man’s cock, spreading the leaking wetness down onto his shaft and
So the bad news is the angst is here..I'm sorryyyy.. my poor Sherlock.
The morning sunlight streamed through the flowing blinds and the soft wisps of summer air fluttered in, delicately ruffling the white silk. The dust motes drifted lazily in the gentle breeze, disturbed only by Sherlock pacing through them now and then.
“Clearly not as much as what’s going on with you!” she smiled, taking a seat on the cushioned chair in front of him. “You alright?”
Molly stared at them both and just quietly wondered to herself how on earth were they not dating yet.
“It’s not. I’m making it up.” Sherlock explained, eyes still glued to the viscous pink liquid.
After a while, he pulled Sherlock close to his chest, as they both calmed and listening to each other breathe as they watched the fire crackle soothingly in the fire place.
“John?” a small voice had asked behind him, startling him.
He expected everyone to groan, knowing that one of the student’s favorite parts was always the gesture poses due to their quick nature and lack of need for perfection, it was more about reacting as fast as they could to the way they saw the body before them. But no one made a sound. Turning around to look at his student’s he noticed everyone seemed pretty focused on their drawing, but they looked almost… too focused. As if faking it. As if haven been caught witnessing something they shouldn’t have.
John caught him by the wrist in a tight secure grip, he pulled Sherlock towards him, hanging on to a nearby branch for leverage. Sherlock shook his head, his eyes glassy, curls flying in all directions as he stumbled back and slipped on some wet leaves under his trainers. John’s grip on the branch broke loose as SHerlokc’s weight pulled him off the roof of the house and they both fell back onto the ground.
“I can’t believe… Sherlock…” John breathed out, his eyes threatening to spill over with tears.
He slumped down, caught by Sherlock’s waiting warm arms and strong flat chest sheathed in a thin layer of sweat. The kept on holding each other, caressing hands to sides and arms and through hair in comfort and reassurance. Eventually John had move away and out of Sherlock’s body, drips of come following soon after, much to John’s unexplainable pleasure.
“NghIdontwanna” Sherlock slurred out, shifting closer into the other man’s chest and hugging him tightly.
The question of whether Sherlock was alright or not died in his lips as Sherlock exploded in surprised giggles which John couldn’t help but join in. “You tripped over my paint sets” he gasped out between laughs
“I said you’re lovely too…. idiot” the artist rushed out.
“They’re babies, John,” Sherlock said. “They’re not even strong enough to make us faint.”
But something was lingering in the back of his mind “But… Why?” he whispered in awe under his breath. How could someone as gorgeous as Sherlock want to paint someone as broken as himself?
Sherlock turned around, wondering why it bothered him that it wasn’t the “female attention” that John did not seek.
John turned to look at him “Wha-? No. No, I can't.”
John chuckled “Of course you noticed all of that, you brilliant man”
He loved what he did. Not just because he felt free and happy in his own world but because it made his world quiet down even for just one moment.
“I nicked it from the police's current DI” Sherlock shrugged. Flipping through the pages.
“Sherlock?” John prompted
THIS IS IT GUYS. IM EMOTIONAL.
beneath him, he was now utterly and completely
Sherlock quickly looked around the room, almost every student was staring dazedly at John’s hobbling figure towards the left side of the room. So clearly Sherlock was just having a natural reaction to John’s strong presence. Clearly.
“No, I’ve never taught in this classroom." he replied "I used to study in this university. I had my painting classes here” he smiled wistfully at the memory, looking around the room at the scattered easels and canvases on the almost pristine wooden floors and clearly reliving all his memories of this place.
The artist grinned, flushing deeply at the compliment “Something like that... But real life is much harder than school. And making my name as an artist... well. It’s taking its time.”
Sherlock almost dropped the baby mandrake in shock, which made the creature wail even louder.
He hated it when Irene was right. “Fine”, he said. “So what do I do?”
That managed to startle a small snicker out of John. “Yeah well…” he said, shrugging. He couldn’t find what to say next. Sherlock gave him a shy smile, which John instinctually mirrored. Some of the weight in the air around them dissipated, but the tension still thrummed like electricity, slowly pulling them together.
They stayed in comfortable silence for a couple of minutes, letting sleepiness drift back in and the warmth of the bed to diffuse into their bodies once more.
family of all families. The ordinary Watson… now had a witch in the family.
“Which was it?”
with him? He felt blood pool in his cheeks as he shook his head, reminding himself to focus. The snitch. Yes. Where was the snitch? Gold flashing movement… where was the gold flashing movement… John had golden hair. Quite bright too. It reflected the sunlight with every shake of his head as he bobbed enthusiastically on his broom. Sherlock could JUST make out a couple of sweat droplets rolling down his jaw and onto his tanned neck. Those looked golden too against John’s tanned skin.
-Money issues
“That…was” John paused. Sherlock braced himself, “Absolutely brilliant!” John exclaimed. Sherlock beamed back at him instantly, feeling warm all of a sudden. “How did you know his neighbour was her lover?!”
“Let’s head up to my common room, shall we?” John murmured, laying another kiss on Sherlock’s cooling cheek and another on the tiny bit of skin visible on his neck above Sherlock’s scarf. “I’m not even half done with you” he whispered. Sherlock shivered with pleasure, heart hammering and stomach filled with elated butterflies… and followed John.
“You idiot.”
“John” Sherlock choked out, sounding longing and hopeful
“Okay… okay” John murmured soothingly. He took a couple of steps forward before turning back to Sherlock who was still frozen in place, hands trembling by his sides.
“Well.. because it’s our first official date. And I want to make it special” John beamed.
Sherlock sighed dramatically “I’ve given the interviews, taken the necessary pictures and been present for more than enough time. The sales go through my manager anyway so, yes. My boyfriend and I are leaving.” He pulled John along as Mycroft stepped aside, brow risen but not seeming surprised by Sherlock rapid speech.
“And Sally don’t snicker. I don’t know what on earth you’re doing either. You’re so focused on your drawing you’re not looking at the model at ALL. This is flat. You’re measuring is absolutely atrocious. And you know why that is? Because you’re not looking. Start over.”
John narrowed his eyes and poked his ribs again, and Sherlock snickered uncontrollably.
” Sherlock would have said. But… it
The memory of it was suddenly vivid in Sherlock’s mind. He had done his best not to stare or pay attention to it. After all, by teaching figure drawing Sherlock saw naked bodies every week. As many female bodies and male. It wasn’t like himself to get in any way moved or aroused by them. This had never happened before and yet…
Seeing Sherlock at the hospital wing was not exactly an uncommon occurrence (he showed up at least once a week for some sort of experiment related wound followed closely by an annoyed and huffing John), but by the look of John’s face Madam Pomfrey knew this was not some sort of silly accident with Poly juice potion.
Sherlock couldn’t even summon the energy to come up with some snarky or teasing remark before John had taken gone back down to lave his tongue around the sensitive head of Sherlock’s cock, lightly dipping into the slit. He used his free hand to tug lightly at the artist’s balls and before Sherlock knew it he could feel John’s fingers inside him probing deeper and deeper, the initial discomfort almost gone and the pleasure singing at the edges when-
“There’s plenty of artist’s showing their work I'm sure they won't miss me. Besides, the interviews are done and we’ve been here for more than 3 hours.” He kissed John lightly again, much more softly, lovingly. “Take me home” he whispered.
John smiled, kissing his thigh reverently before reaching up and promptly licking a stripe up Sherlock’s length, wrapping his lips on the head, and sucking tenderly. Sherlock had had no idea he could make such a large amount of noise with such a simple touch, but the heat of the other man’s mouth around his was so intense, so incredible.
“Are you hurt?” John demanded. He instantly pulled back, inspecting every part he could see from his friend's body. He didn’t
John beamed back, feeling warm and safe and suddenly not so long in this place full of dragons and wands and magic.
Yaaay no more angst......right? naah im kidding....
things to Sherlock.
” he murmured, one of his hands sneaking into the back of John’s neck and scratching his hands teasingly down to the collar of his shirt.
Some kids had snuck off to the back towards one of the smallest baby hippogriff and were attempting to tear off its barely forming silver feathers. John had immediately shot up and run across the field to go in defense of the harmless baby animal, stepping up in front of the kids. A single glare from a steaming John had been enough for the kids to apologize and scatter away. John had taken the small fluffy animal in his arms and brought him back to its enraged mother who Hagrid was trying desperately to tame. The fearless look in John’s eye as he approached the mother with the happy squawking baby in his arms had taken Sherlock’s breath away and he watched, heart pounding, as the elder hippogriff calmed, took in John’s approaching figure, accepted the stolen baby and bowed so low its beak touched the floor in reverence to one brave John Watson.
Sherlock felt John’s body tense beside him instantly, he gave a minuscule side step subconsciously covering Sherlock’s body from the man before them with his own. Sherlock felt a rush of fondness wash over him instead of the sting of hurt from Dimmock’s remark.
“JOHN!” Sherlock screamed. John somehow managed to secure his hold on Sherlock to pull his body above his own as they fell, falling back-first onto the mattress with Sherlock secured against his chest. The fall was both longer and shorter than expected, the searing jolt in both of their stomachs at the adrenalin rush and the fear of falling off scorching. The shock of the landing pushed against John’s back, but fortunately, the material of the mattress was soft enough that they sunk into its thick material with a soft bounce. Not that it didn’t hurt quite a bit.
“Where are we going?”
“Huh? Oh yeah! I’m fine. Fine.” John muttered, waving a hand dismissively.
“I’ve never begged for mercy in my life!”
“Oh come on. He can’t be that bad… can he?” John had asked curiously.
“Umm… hello. Am I… in the right classroom?”
“I was very impressed with your work little brother” the elder Holmes continued, completely ignoring the artist. “You seem to have an… interesting subject” it sounded like a question. Mycroft’s eyes now turned to John, calculating and deducing him with a single sweeping if slightly bored look.
“John!” he called. “It’s raining”
At last, Sherlock gave the beginnings of a smile, his cheeks growing hot.
The greenhouse was completely pitch black. John reached for his wand but Sherlock stopped him. “Don’t,” he said. He came close and whispered into John’s ear, placing a hand on his shoulder. “It’s already dark outside and we’re supposed to be in our beds. Peeves or Filch could see the light.” His warm breaths of air grazed John’s neck softly and John tried his best not to shiver. Sherlock didn’t seem to notice. “Just… let your eyes adjust,” he breathed.
“W-what?”
“Hey,” John spoke softly, seeming a little cautious for interrupting Sherlock’s drawing. Sherlock felt a small glimmer of warmth. “Hello John, your leg is feeling alright I assume?” he winced internally, cringing at the fact that he had so quickly jumped to a safe conversation instead of being like any normal human being and asking actual questions and being interesting himself. He kept his eyes on the page, pretending to keep highlighting shadows and half hoping John would say something or ask something just so Sherlock wouldn’t have to embarrass himself again.
He drew John. His feet, his hands, his closed eyelids and relaxed lips parted open. He drew John after he sleepily turned around, maybe subconsciously tracking Sherlock’s body heat and shifting closer. John now lay on his stomach, the white sheets tangled between his legs and revealing only one of his round and plump arse cheeks. Sherlock let out a shuddering breath. He had now seen John naked in both a professional and a sexual context. But this was new again. John had fallen asleep and allowed him to be next to him at his most vulnerable. His nakedness was not his only vulnerability, as John was fairly confident in his body, but it was a vulnerability of the soul. To let himself he so bare and vulnerable in sleep next to Sherlock, in every possible way.
“Oh that’s great!.... yes I’ll be there with him, only as his arm candy of course, I cannot paint or do art at all…… that’s fantastic! I really want to meet you too…. we’ll see you soon then!... Bye!” he passed the phone back to Sherlock, grinning.
“Against Johnny, here?” Greg said in surprise. “Our cap here’s quite the player, Sherls.”
Sherlock reached behind him and carefully drew out a notebook and pencil from the bedside table. He hoped John wouldn’t mind. Would this be considered as not good? Sherlock frowned. But… he just couldn’t help himself. He opened the notebook at a blank page and looked up at John again. He looked so peaceful, so serene. So beautiful. Sherlock smiled.
John just pulled him back, gently and into the kitchen “That’s not the same Sherlock! You have to start eating properly. 3 times a day.”
She shook her head again. “I don’t know, John. I wish there was another way”
“Sherlock,” he whispered, pulling very gently at his curls.
There he was; cheeks tinged with a soft blush with the cold fall air, or excitement? John couldn’t tell, but his dark curls were flying everywhere in the morning wind and he was looking directly into John’s eyes, grinning and cheering in contrast to the sulking Slytherin’s around him.
Sherlock’s heart performed some sort of somersault in his chest and his stomach flipped in agreement as he beamed to his… his
“And he’s always talking about Hogwarts! As if it was a
Sherlock looked up at him, sadly. “I wanted to… But your letter’s had stopped and I was afraid that.. that you really HAD forgotten about me”.
The unanticipated movement caused John’s foot to get caught in a small crack on the ice and his foot twisted slightly, he wavered dangerously. “Oh!”
He. Had. Kissed. Sherlock.
“J- uhh” Sherlock said, breathlessly, he tried again “I need to feel you... John”. He raked his nails up John’s back, silently urging him to come up higher.
It was nearing dawn so Sherlock expected it when John yawned and announced that he had to leave. That didn’t mean he didn’t get up from the couch without significant restraint.
“Okay,” Sherlock said quickly. He hadn’t meant to be so abrupt but he couldn’t pass up the chance. He had actually been considering staying for the winter break anyway… wanting to stay in Hogwarts for as long as he possibly could before the Beauxbatons castle was inevitably rid of the infestation of spiders. He wasn’t looking forwards to going back there. And a full month here… with John. How could anyone, WHY would anyone pass up on that opportunity?
Sherlock’s heart thumped unevenly against his ribs. He didn’t know what exactly he was hoping John hadn’t seen. Why was his face so damn hot? They really needed to put some fans around here. “Saw umm... saw what?
“WELCOME WELCOME, TO ANOTHER DIVINATION CLASS! Today my dears… we’ll gaze INTO OUR FUTURES!” Professor Trelawney exclaimed, waving her hands around excitedly and gazing at them with her huge bug-like blue eyes through her rounded spectacles.
“I imagine” John breathed out “drawing this cheekbone, this mess of raven curls” he caught one of the with his index finger, his hand still not moving far from Sherlock’s pink soft face. “The lightning shock of your pale skin” John murmured, tracing his finger down Sherlock’s neck, feeling his sharp intake of breath. “Your sharp-cut jawline” he traced it delicately and Sherlock could picture the painting John was describing. For a moment, seeing himself the way John saw him. Not pointy and lanky but beautiful. Under John’s gaze, he felt so beautiful…
“Found it then. You Alright?” John raised himself slightly and kissed his hip, letting go of Sherlock’s cock with a filthy wet pop.
Sherlock couldn’t stop staring at John.
“Hi,” he whispered, his voice coming out much higher and softer than he had expected, causing his cheeks to color slightly and to quickly clear his throat.
The artist nodded, feeling relieved at finally hearing the full story and a little self-reproaching at how rapidly he had reacted. He supposed it was normal, for an emotion as strong as he felt for John to have accompanying consequences, such as jealousy. He wondered if John would ever or had ever felt jealous over him. He had to admit the idea was not unappealing.
Now, hours later, Sherlock bit his lip, marveling at the fact that John had stayed with him, had fallen asleep in his bed and hadn’t let go of Sherlock for hours.
He quickly made sure the door was closed with a glance before he slowly raised his hands and cupped Sherlock’s face between them both, “I’ve been waiting all day for this” he said.
The conversation then took to their favourite Quidditch teams and future matches against the Beauxbatons houses.
things. The last thing he wanted to do was show John how insecure he was about the bond they were slowly forming again. He was so scared he would somehow break it… again. After having barely survived all those years without John, he didn’t know what he would do if it happened all over again. And if John knew… if he
The body belonged to a man not older than 35 years of age, medium length blonde hair and dressed pristinely. He was quite handsome and had a short scruffy stubble that, instead of making him look ragged or dirty had probably made him look edgy and mysterious. A wedding ring glistened in short snaps against the light of the flashing photographs and a bottle of pills lay spilled beside his hand, a phone lay on the other as if he had been clutching it the last moments of his life.
Gladstone blinked, which John took as a sign that he understood. He placed the letter in front of Gladstone, and the owl clasped it with his small yellow beak. Fortunately, John’s bed was situated directly beside the window which John usually left open when the room became stuffy. Gladstone fluttered outside, wings outstretched and sunk into the darkness.
. This is what they wanted… what they wanted all along with each other.
“Uhuh. Look, I was crushing on Sherlock for over two years. And in those two years I learned one thing and one thing only”
John rolled his eyes dramatically “Yeah, but I woke up after the fourth day didn’t I?”
mouth. There. Perfect. He tried his best to replicate John’s movements with his lips until he got the hang of them and tried a few of his own, obtaining a few gorgeous sighs and moans from John’s chest.
like him? Like that?”
“You and your damn stork legs,” John muttered under his breath whilst trying to keep himself upright, figuring that actual skating was second priority to NOT falling over. But that approach wasn’t working all that well if he was being honest with himself.
Sherlock’s heart skipped another beat.
John glared at the man’s retreating figure, clearly thinking he was the sole cause for the distress in Sherlock’s eyes. He placed his hand on the small of the artist’s back, gently guiding him out of the crowd. Sherlock’s mouth wouldn’t move, but his eyes followed John, committing him to memory before he eventually confessed to Sherlock he had found someone else and could no longer see him.
Eliza was sobbing into her hands again, her shoulders shaking with every gasped tremulous breath. “I’m… I’m so sorry my darling. I couldn’t… I couldn’t convince him otherwise.”
“You’re lovely”
Sherlock’s eyes widened. If he’d looked anxious to leave before it was nothing to what he looked like now. He struggled against the hold Anderson had on him, to no avail, and avoided John’s eyes as best he could.
Sherlock hated to admit this. He seriously did. But he had to admit Sarah had a remarkable taste in Italian restaurants. The name of the place was “The Landmark London” and the artist felt chills from the moment they walked in.
“That look! Your ‘there’s more’ look. What exactly happened at Beauxbatons?”
Sherlock was too important. Even now. He’d just gotten him back and there was no way in hell he would jeopardize that for what might be a cursory crush. Besides… he didn’t even know whether Sherlock was into guys. And if he WAS he couldn’t guarantee that he’d be into HIM. He couldn’t do that do Sherlock or himself now that they were finally starting to reconnect. No.  He wouldn’t make a move. It wouldn’t be god for either of them. There was too much at risk.
Every 3 minutes John switched poses, each one standing but all completely different. Even though John had clearly taken this job to make ends meet after he came back when he was invalided from the army he obviously took it very seriously and had rapidly become a professional. He played with his weight in very interesting poses and gave everyone around the room interesting angles from his body and plays on how the human body bent and moved. Sherlock very rarely drew along with his students, only when he absolutely knew his students could draw for a long time unsupervised. And he never drew along with them in the gesture poses, always wanting the students to feel his watchful gaze in the first half hour of the class to make sure they wouldn’t slack off later on during the day. But this time, Sherlock felt himself itching towards his pencil. He didn’t pick it up. But it was extremely difficult not to.
John sighed, and eager to change the topic asked his friend what was going on with them. Molly rambled on enthusiastically about her new project and her plans to make a perfect ‘Felix Felicis’ potion for her final exam with Professor Slughorn. Greg talked about the new Quidditch team trials and absolutely insisted John had to sign him up as the second beater, attempting to show off his strong batting skills with his fork but just ending up splattering Charlie Magnussen’s face at the Slytherin table with scrambled eggs. John chuckled and smiled with his friends and for a moment, he didn’t worry about Sherlock.
When Sherlock woke up he was still mostly enveloped in darkness. The first wisps of daylight from the sunrise were beaming through the gap between the white curtains. He shifted around, momentarily forgetting why he felt so exhausted and sated but he suddenly realized that what was underneath his head did not feel like a pillow at all and raising his head slightly he turned and was faced with the gorgeous sleeping figure of John Watson.
With resignation to finish this painting tonight in his mind, he quickly cleaned his paint brushes with turpenoid (he detested the smell of turpentine), stretched his arms and neck and headed to take a bath before he had to head out for work. After all, all those student loans, the apartment rent (even when halved by his darling landlady Mrs.Hudson) and the gas and electricity bills would not pay themselves.
“We were just... we weren’t…”
Sherlock smiled minutely to himself, aware Molly and Mike were both observing him for some unknown reason. Perhaps they hadn’t done their homework, though coming from Molly at least that seemed highly unlikely. Deciding to ignore whatever was going on with his students Sherlock reached into his bag and drew out a big almost brand new sketchbook he reserved for lessons when he decided to join his students. He usually reserved such lessons for when he trusted his students enough not to have to check on them every 5 minutes but alas, he could not resist. Not with not knowing if he would ever get John as a model again at any time soon and taking advantage of having him to draw from instead of having to rely solely on memory. No matter how good his memory was.
-possible six pack
“Quite, John. Look at the colour of the ice. If it was thinner, you would be able to see the water below. But it’s all white.” He went off talking about other pigments he could see on the ice as John hesitatingly repeated the process Sherlock had done on his own shoes and joined him, with a wobbly tiptoe.
These boooys.... cant they just kiss alreadyyyy <3<3<3
Sherlock’s room looked like it had been through a war. Every surface was covered in school materials, clothes and books. Two suitcases lay on the side of his humongous bed both open and filled almost to the brink and Sherlock and John were stuffing a pile of books into one of them.
“Oi! As if! You’re lucky to be in my esteemed company” said John around a mouthful of pancakes, dipping his fork into his yoghurt dish and flicking it at Greg.
Mary was very beautiful, neck length blonde hair, always perfectly straightened and sharp dark blue eyes. Even without any kind of inkling to be interested in women Sherlock knew when someone was conventionally beautiful. But, observing John now he could tell that the problem was not that John was put off by her appearance or even by her flirtatious words, which to be honest were pretty kind even when slightly inappropriate in this setting.
“He knew how I felt about you. Ever since that night five years ago when he walked into my room and saw you holding me. You were about to kiss me…. Weren’t you?”
He turned back to look at the painting.
He could hear the faint shifting and whispering of the falling cloth from John’s body but he made himself look straight onto his page even though he was no longer writing anything. Eventually, John walked out from behind wearing the black robe the models were given as an option to wear before they climbed onto the platform and assumed a pose they chose to begin the drawing session. Sherlock had expected John to walk out using his cane but the blonde had left it behind with his folded clothes and was now limping slightly towards the platform. The limp wasn’t as noticeable as Sherlock thought it would be judging on how much John seemed to be relying on it when walking but clearly, it was definitely a subconscious thing. He COULD see John wincing very slightly from the imagined pain but the limp wasn’t very prominent in his walk.
Sherlock had a far away glazed look in his eyes. He looked absolutely hypnotized and enchanted by whatever he had smelt in that potion and John was entranced by the vulnerable look in Sherlock’s usually carefully reserved expression. His pink curved lips were slightly parted and he for a moment, looked straight at John before he began talking.
“Those are your freckles!” John squawked, indignantly, as if it was obvious.
The GOOD news is: it won't last very long <3<3 AND I added a chapter to my plan- it's pretty much fluff and smut so. I hope that makes up for it .
when he rose slowly, the back of his blue school robe all but sticking to the gentle curve of his arse.
“Huh?” John turned towards her, startled. He hadn’t heard a single word she’d uttered, haven been too focused on the frozen boy in the blue robes.
When John arrived at the hospital wing Sherlock was all but snatched from his arms by a huffing Madam Pomfrey.
John laughed and grinned and it was hard to believe that so much time had passed between them, all those years of silence and distance. They walked through the expansive gardens and along the perimeter of the forbidden forest. John didn’t miss the curious looks Sherlock shot into the darkness beneath the trees but said nothing. He knew a single word from the Beauxbatons would probably be enough to convince him to go into the forest and was really not feeling up to the dangers of the creatures that lived within, nor the detention they would most certainly face.
“Mummy!” Sherlock cried indignantly, his cheeks heating a fiery red instantly.
Hours later, they were exhausted. The event was doing quite well but Sherlock really couldn’t wait to take John home and rip off his clothes. John felt quite the same, not having been able to focus properly on quite anything since he’d seen Sherlock walk out of their room in those sinfully tight suit pants and purple dress shirt. They walked slowly through the gallery, people still pouring in and the complimentary wine not even near finishing. The interviewers clearly couldn’t have enough of him and kept interrupting him for more pictures, more questions.
“John!”
to see Sherlock again. Sherlock scoffed. As if.
John thought back to Sherlock’s expression moments before he’d botched it all up with his impulsive kiss. He had looked... dazed. Perhaps it had been John’s clouded judgment and want for Sherlock to look like that but... perhaps not?
THEY KISSED!
“Actually… you’re right, John. I guess I did spend all that time exploring the vast collection of restricted books at Hogwarts.. not a waste of time at all!” he seemed reassured as he pranced about the shop ducking to see the (artifacts) on the lowest shelves and jumping to see the highest ones. John just watched him amusedly. He’d been here several times before since his third year, so he was content just to watch Sherlock explore the shop for the very first time. The way he bounced up and down and the little O his mouth made whenever he saw something that captured his interest was so reminiscent of his childhood self John couldn’t help but grin besottedly at the sight.
Greg opened his mouth again, no doubt to spew some grand speech about John’s legendary flirtatious abilities as if it would magically change everything but thankfully, Molly stepped in. “John. You say you’re not like that but- it sounds like you
“So you're telling me… Acromantulas are.. spiders?” John asked, eyes wide with shock. Sherlock lost his train of thought, thoughtful frown turning into an amused smirk.
He walked around the room slowly, still feeling John’s eyes following his progress as if tracking his prey. He felt his heart thumping against his chest, wanting nothing more than for all the students to disappear so he could tackle John and kiss him against the floor of the platform. Or a wall. Or any conceivable surface around.
Molly smiled and shrugged “I know you, John. I’ve seen that look before”.
At that moment Sherlock had stirred, touching his lips momentarily with his painted fingers and staining his lower lip with green before blinking a couple of times, obviously having felt John’s presence and gaze over him and turned around, surprised.
The model was holding him completely up by just a strong hold on his arse and he wasn’t even showing any signs that this was taking up effort, he attacked Sherlock’s neck with sucks and licks and Sherlock, unable to help himself any longer snuck a hand between them and pulled at the strong tying John’s modesty robe. He clawed and pulled at it until at last, it fell from his shoulders and onto the ground. The blonde groaned, walking backwards until he felt the cold platforms metal edge make contact with the inside of his knee and he lowered himself until he was sitting on it, effectively having Sherlock’s knees surrounding his thighs in a seductive straddle.
Without the dazzling heat of John against his back, Sherlock was able to reboot his brain and focus on the task before him. Just a few minutes later he had the gates open and his face was almost back to its natural pale colour. Almost. But, of course, John noticed.
The daylight from outside the window was almost entirely gone, moonlight starting to shine its unearthly glow into Sherlock’s enchanted face.
Sherlock himself was incredibly surprised by how easily he had taken to this new boy. How he had not immediately wanted him to leave him alone. Or how he hadn’t been tired and annoyed by his questions about magic and Hogwarts. John had allowed him to talk, to explain and to even slip in an experiment of his or two into their conversation. John…. Listened. He actually seemed to care? Sherlock found it hard not to stare at the boy in wonder and wonder if maybe this is what it felt to finally have a friend.
Rolling his eyes, John smirked begrudgingly and swerved away on his broom. Quidditch practice had been going on for at least a couple hours, and although he was giving his team a hard time he rather thought they were doing pretty well. The match against Beauxbatons was tomorrow and they absolutely had to be prepared. He wouldn’t dare lose against them after the teasing he’d given Sherlock last Friday.
Where could he be? Library? No… He was probably still with Irene and she never frequented the library. Quidditch field?
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock thought ‘
However, as logical as Sherlock’s plan had seemed at first John couldn’t help but find himself doubting the science of it. Especially today.
“WHO’S IN THERE!” they heard Filch shout. The light from his lantern was already reflecting on the frosted glass and illuminating them both in soft yellow light.
“I don’t actually want to be known as-“
Sherlock thought.
They sat at what had become their usual table for the last couple of weeks, only this time the red mantle on the circular table wasn’t empty. Two crystals globes filled with a swirling pearly white mist stood on opposite sides of the table, where Sherlock and John took their seats. John avoided Sherlock’s eyes as he sat down, trying to calm his anxious breathing and act normal. Of course, he failed miserably.
that they hadn’t been exactly subtle. But maybe there were still some doubts… and Sherlock was most certainly
(See the end of the chapter for
he had not expected. Romance. HIM? What a ridiculous notion. As if anyone in their right mind could possibly entertain the possibility of spending time with him. Let alone love him. How could it happen? When he couldn’t even make friends!
“Yes. John’s coming with me”
“So, that’s basically a fast version of what I’ve been up to these couple of years… that and Quidditch of course” Sherlock finished.
“Are you serious?!” John waved his hands around towards the sound of the fast approaching footsteps.
“Might’ve read the name somewhere around. Must’ve deleted it. But yes, it looks like a ‘Gladstone’”
They coursed through the large white rooms, dodging the public and the reporters quickly before anyone could call them back. Sherlock was actually quite hopeful that they would get out of there easily without getting interrupted when a tall man with the most expensive suit around stood in front of the main door to block their way.
“H-hey!” Sherlock stumbled out. He stared at John in shock for a couple of seconds, blinking silently until John’s happy grin started to waiver.
The heat of the water pressed against his neck and shoulders easing the pain and the tension in them. Sherlock closed his eyes and sighed in pleasure, passing his hands over every part of his body and lathering it in soapy water.
He shot up swiftly into the sky, momentarily forgetting everything around him as the air caressed his blond hair familiarly and he basked in the smooth feel of his Firebolts’ take-off. But as soon he blew the whistle and practice started he kept losing his focus, aware of Sherlock slim figure sitting in the stands with an open potions book in his lap, and Irene sitting at his side with her legs crossed while he whispered furiously towards his book clearly talking to her indirectly.
John opened his mouth to plead for her to understand that this was in no way, love. Love wasn’t having someone force to move your family away for no reason after knowing how much his son longed to go to a school that had finally accepted him. Love was not to hurt your family, to make them feel less and afraid. He tried to speak. To somehow let her know that he loved them so much more than Sherringford ever could.  That he’d help them somehow. That the thought of not seeing Sherlock and her every summer was so physically painful he could not deal with it. That they were both such wonderful people and did not deserve to have such pain and abuse in their lives. But the words wouldn’t come out.
“Liar!” Molly laughed “Who were you looking for? Mary, I bet”. Greg groaned around his mouthful of food.
John, impossibly, blushed an even deeper shade of red and shoved Greg with his left shoulder lightly. “Yeah… I think so” he smiled.
“Yess” John drawled, coming closer, a seductive smirk pulling at his lips
And then Sherlock’s eyes rolled back in his head and he fell to the floor, unconscious.
“You play?” John exclaimed. “What team? Wait- I don’t think I even know how teams in Beauxbatons are divided… do you have houses or something? But wait... what position do you play?” John’s enthusiastic words tripped over themselves in their effort to get out as quickly as possible. Sherlock snorted, fondly remembering John’s tendency to ramble uncontrollably when excited.
“Hey!” John grinned.
They sat next to each other in the dark, pouring over book after book on subjects John hadn’t even thought to look for but Sherlock had pointed him to. They found books on several dangerous creatures John had never heard of, about beasts forbidden for even most of the magical world to be exposed to. They read about incredible spells and dark potions with unthinkable effects and unbelievably powerful ones thought to be potent enough to even delay death for several years. Overall, the night was shaping up to be quite a success.
“So… you’re John’s friends,” he said a bit awkwardly, John’s heart almost burst with affection for the attempt at conversation.
Now, as they walked into the classroom and John lost his hold on Sherlock it felt as if reality crashed back into them. Sherlock asked the students to display their last class drawings on the wall, and told John that the modeling would start an hour later than usual whilst he and the students observed the progress of the class as a whole.
She looked up at him sadly, mutely shook her head slowly before bowing her head in defeat once more.
John was immediately invested in looking at all the cake options, whilst Sherlock just pointed to the one with the least amount of gum-paste flowers and icing. After they ordered their tea and cakes, Madame Pudifoot led them to a table next to the slightly iced windows. It was a very private and intimate setting and they’re both sat nervously across from each other, suddenly finding themselves in the middle of what was quite obviously an official date. Now there was no room for doubt. And after a small quiet pause, John just smiled and reached back for Sherlock’s hand to tuck it under his in warm reassurance Sherlock was quite grateful for.
“You need to push me, John.” Sherlock interrupted him. “If I jump… maybe my body won't react properly. I need you to push me off.”
Flashes of memories burst behind his eyes. Memories of that boy smiling down at him, laughing with him. Memories of that boy he hadn’t seen or spoken to in almost exactly 5 years. His best friend. Even after all this time. The only one Sherlock Holmes Had ever had.
In the darkness, Sherlock couldn’t see much past John’s golden hair and the silhouette of his figure walking in front of him. It had been his suggestion to run back to his own flat, knowing that John lived far away and needing to get away from the cold after chasing down the killer down several streets.
John frowned, “just because you don’t get hungry it doesn’t mean your body doesn’t need it. Come on, you’re heaving breakfast with me tomorrow”. Sherlock froze as he turned the page on his book, but tried to play it off as he cleared his throat and kept reading in feigned fascination. “A-alright”, he agreed softly.
“Alright. Now, I’m ready” Sherlock walked out of their room with a charcoal black suit and deep purple shirt, no tie. He straightened it with surprisingly steady hands and turned to John.
“I.. wasn’t John” Mike replied bemusedly
“Yes?” John teased, wetly kissing his way onto the other nipple and giving it the same treatment.
“Are you drawing me, gorgeous?” he sighed happily, closing his eyes again
But as much as John enjoyed learning about these crazy things, or exploring the long dark creepy halls of the restricted sections, with its screaming books and its whispering parchments, the best part of the night… the one feature of interest as his friends would say: was Sherlock. Sherlock with his hair gleaming in the moonlight streaming through the window. With his sparkling mischievous eyes and long pale fingers turning page after page and sending whiffs of his sweet scent across to John, who was losing concentration with every passing moment.
John bit his lip, seeming nervous “We’re uh… pretty far from your place” he started, his hands dropping from the artist’s face. The artist instantly felt the cold air against them.
“Yeah. I’m okay”, the Beauxbatons muttered, eyes squeezed shut as he raised a hand to feel where he’s hurt his cheekbone. It was wet.
Sherlock tuned off the voice of the interviewer, knowing the questions he would ask and having the answers prepared in the tip of his tongue as he focused more on the people around. In the distance Sherlock saw his brother, who he reluctantly admitted to himself was at least a little pleased to see. And at the very back he spotted Irene and Kate.
“Sherlock” John pleaded with him. “I don’t think you should…”
“The devil snare!” Sherlock suddenly hissed. “It’s right here!
“Hello John” Sherlock smiled back, eyes flicking down to John’s cane-less stance and up again. John smiled even wider, in silent acknowledgement. Sherlock’s heart definitely did not skip a beat and on a whim, Sherlock winked. John blinked, surprised before returning a grin and turning away to look at the students and nodding hello at them as well. He walked across the classroom and behind the changing screen, Sherlock could’ve sworn his cheeks were slightly tinted pink but it could’ve just been some trick of the classrooms light.
“Right,” Professor Septima didn’t seem convinced either, but all too glad to get rid of this troublesome student she shoved him in front of herself and through the door.
“Oh. Uh.. no. Not sports… injury” John shrugged “You uh- You didn’t want to get some breakfast before the long poses?” he asked, clearly looking to change the topic. So the military service and thus caused injury were a sore subject, thought Sherlock, interesting. He just wished he didn’t have to find out these things through Mary. He sniffed, trying to block out the conversation that they were now having. John was clearly much less into it than Mary was but then again Mary was clearly flirting and John was a little uncomfortable with the attention.
“Oh, my boys” Eliza teared up. “Finally going to school! With wands and everything!” she sniffled. “I miss you both already”.
The school corridors were darkening fast, it wasn’t quite sunset yet but it was approaching. The walked past all the second floor closed doors, some signaling ‘painting room’ other ‘ceramics room’ or ‘studio drawing room’. The walls were littered with posters of school events, contests, part time job opportunities and deadline reminders, all colorful visually striking posters with inviting letters and some of the luckiest student’s artwork.
“Sherlock. Even if you got magic right this second you do realise you wouldn’t be able to control it until you got your wand right?” John shook his head minutely, sighing as he turned to another page in his book.
Sherlock nodded and took a deep breath before opening his eyes. “You mustn't think it was because I didn’t want to, John. Please believe me… because not speaking to you- not having you around for all those years was the single most terrible thing that I have ever had to go through. You were and are.. my best friend. My
“Just. Give me a minute!” Sherlock hurriedly took a small pair of hedge clippers that were laying around and proceeded to cut pieces of the devil snare.
They entered the shop and were immediately relieved by the lack of icy wind and falling snow, as it was replaced by lovely warm air and the smell of several types of explosive joke artifacts and funky looking potions in small glass vials.
Snickers could be heard behind the now scarlet coloured shape of Sherlock, mainly coming from the other Beauxbatons in the room.
Sherlock smiled at them, he himself startled with the sincerity of the joy he felt at the sight of them. After all, the school year was long finished and they wouldn’t be his students anymore. “Hello,” he said. John grinned and approached them quickly, pulling Sherlock alongside him to greet them properly.
there are no words”
John.
The cab stopped in front of his apartment, and tossing some bills to the driver, John sighed and went up to his empty apartment. Resolving to not pressure Sherlock into talking to him again. If Sherlock wanted to see him and was willing to forgive and forget John’s monumental idiocy, he would.
The clock, barely glinting in the early sunshine marked 6 am. A little late but it didn’t matter. It
“Besides,” added Molly. “If you want things between you to be the way they were you need to confront him. And even more so if you want them to… develop.”
“No,” Sherlock answered curtly. He sat up on the edge of the mattress facing away from John.
They had time.
grew so did the increasingly filthy whispers, the shuddering sighs, the stuttered ‘ah’s drawn from their throats. The desire to soothe the ache to feel each other pulsed between them as their bodies glided sensually against each other.
John continued tracing Sherlock’s face softly, whispering under his breath “the deep delicious curve of you lips” he murmured, the pad of his finger barely a whisper against Sherlock’s lips. Said lips puckered slightly under the touch, lightly kissing John’s finger as his eyes slipped closed and his heart thudded boomingly against his chest.
John’s sweet contagious laugh.
To John's surprise he had not been intimidated, but instead mesmerized by the dark haired boys’ strange features and sharp eyes. Were they blue? Green? Gray? He had no clue but he wanted, nay, needed to find out.
“John you just… you just jumped like 3 meters into the air. Like it was nothing… you just” with every word Sherlock’s face changed from shock to delight, his grin growing and growing until it lit up his entire face, his chubby cheeks reaching up to his eyes. He started laughing, his face scrunching up in happiness.
Both John and Sherlock turned towards the source of the voice.
“Look…” John continued “would you like to talk about this in a… less student-populated place? I uh… I made us reservations for dinner in this restaurant a police officer recommended.” He bit his lip nervously. “What was her name...Sarah? I asked her for restaurant recommendations and she pointed this one out I thought you and I could… check it out?” with every word the model looked more and more concerned, unsure. As if really doubting Sherlock would agree to come with him.
Sherlock thought to himself
That got Sherlock’s attention, fast. “Yeah? How?”, he pushed his body tightly against John’s already feeling the beginnings of his morning erection against the bare skin of his hip.
Rounding the table to come stand next to the professor John leant over the desk to be able to see his drawing better. Sherlock tensed as he could faintly feel John’s body heat emanating from beneath the single layer of fabric draped over his naked body onto Sherlock’s side. He expelled a nervous breath as John peered even closer to the drawing. Biting his lip and suddenly doubting his artistic ability entirely beneath the deep blue eyes of John Watson.
Sherlock opened the door to the locker slightly.
“What happened to him?” She demanded.
“Oh. Hello” he’d blinked again.
Sherlock hummed thoughtfully “We used to get along…. When we were kids. But I was so different from the other kids… I never had many friends. I guess he became concerned about my well being when the bullying started” Sherlock rolled his eyes “Never left me alone after that. Not as company, mind you. More of a watchful prison guard.” He narrowed his eyes.
“I'm fine..” Sherlock sighed, his voice soft and small.
John’s brain suddenly kicked back in in full force. “WAIT! Sherlock! Are you sure it’s safe?!”
Sherlock nodded wildly, dunking the Mandrake back into the pot and covering it with soil as frantically as he could. The screeching didn’t stop. “Oh god oh god oh god” Sherlock muttered.
“I know” Sherlock whispered, his own vision quite blurry. But a blurry John was infinitely better than John at all.
Anderson only laughed harder, forgetting momentarily about Sherlock and loosening his hold on him. Without the fists forcing him up Sherlock slid to the ground in a painful looking slide and fell to the ground with an audible thump. “Pshhht. What does that even mean for us? What are you gonna do Mr Prefect, huh? Deduct house points from us for teaching a freak a lesson?” he snickered again.
“We’re not married yet, oh my god!”
at it. Had to quit. Too many interested parties lining up for me”
“My parents wouldn’t approve of me having an owl” John shook his head. “Or maybe they wouldn’t care…. No. I don’t know”.
. They had walked in and the model had made them tea and they had sat on his minuscule couch and watched some crap telly as John coursed his lithe fingers through Sherlock’s curls in an attempt to soothe and make him feel better. John could obviously tell that Sherlock was very deeply upset. But he had not asked again. His eyes never left him, though. The artist wondered if the guilt of asking another woman out was eating at him. He wondered if he was postponing telling the artist until the moment they separated and wouldn’t have to do it in person. Smart John. Keeping his emotions safe. Not letting himself be influenced by other’s.
Five hours had gone by and for once his mind was not buzzing with possibilities and ideas and corrections for his painting. It wasn’t exhausted from trying to perfect everything. His thoughts just flowed calmly like a winding river. He felt calm and almost...almost whole at last.
From the back of the room Molly and Mike, who had been listening to the entire conversation looked at each other and conspiratorially, grinned.
He held out his hand, bare against Sherlock’s glove, which Sherlock found unacceptable. So Sherlock took off his glove hastily and took John’s hand in his own, lacing their fingers together and hoisted himself up. John looked at their joined hands, a small pleased smile tugging at his lips.
“Oh. Um. Yes. I decided the class was ready to handle a morning without me breathing on their necks. I’ll check their progress after lunch.”
John smiled “Well… I meant it. That was pretty amazing.” He smiled, Sherlock watched the way it made his eyes crinkle a little bit, he watched the dipping of his small dimples with curiosity. How would they feel under his fingertips?
“MUMMY. NO.” The panic rose to dangerous levels in his voice and John just laughed, stood up from his chair, snatched the phone from Sherlock’s hand and clicked off speaker so Sherlock couldn’t interrupt in indignation. Sherlock did his best anyway.
“I solved it, John. It was a drug. Very specific, an almost untraceable kind of drug. It wasn’t the brother, either. It was their father, come on!” he phoned Lestrade and soon enough they were all outside of Bart’s, Sherlock rapidly explaining his deductions and reasoning, demanding they release the poor brother and arrest the father instead.
“Of course!” Trelawney glided gracefully across the room and close to the entrance to her classroom. “I saw this coming, you know. That’s why I saved up an empty seat. Just for him”. She motioned to the only empty table, the closest one to the door. She looked quite pleased with herself, though John suspected one of the students that had filled up the class had simply decided not to show up and had thus left a vacated seat.
“Oh… well yes. I suppose so. Wouldn’t you like to interrogate the wife yourself? You always love to see these cases through”
But underneath everything… under all the changes the years had caused in him he still recognised the boy he had known what seemed so so long ago.  A lifetime ago. The boy who had taught him everything he knew about the magical world before coming here. His best friend.
“Oh god, drawing’s hard” John muttered suddenly. “How do you do this? It looks so much easier than it actually is”. He reached for the erased and began rubbing something off the page, much to the artist’s curiosity.
“John! Oh my goodness, we were so worried!”
“Oh my goodness Sherlock! You made so much progress! This new painting is amazing!” she suddenly gushed, walking rapidly over to the painting of John getting into the bus. “This one is so different than the others… all your paintings feel alive but this one. This one is something else” She came closer, examining it from all angles and distances. “It’s wonderful Sherlock. What a handsome man, isn’t he?”, she smiled.
“Just saying, Sherlock? That looks suspiciously like a liquid muggles take when they’re stomach sick” John said, eyebrows high on his forehead and face scrunched up in distaste.
won at every single practice we've had so far!” John teased, bumping Sherlock with his shoulder. He started off towards the massive wooden doors that led to the lake and Sherlock followed, barely noticing the change in direction.
“I’m so sorry I can’t be there tonight. Will Johnny be there, Sherl?” the voice said excitedly.
“Speaking of Quidditch,” John said, turning towards Sherlock. “Are we still on for our match this afternoon?”
“Nothing. We’re just… packing. Sir” Sherlock answered, his voice trembling.
“But…” Sherlock whispered brokenly. “What about Hogwarts?”
“SHERLOCK! JOHN! We have to run! Potions starts in 2 minutes and you know Slughorn hates it when we’re late.” Mike cried running towards them. He stopped and looked between the two teenagers, instantly sensing the mood of the conversation “Oh. Uhh.. I… I’ll just go then yeah?”
“Don’t mind… I'll be fine as long as I'm not Slytherin”
Now, in his third summer spent at the Holmes’s house, John was sitting below a giant willow tree in the middle of their garden beside Sherlock. He could feel the rough bumps of the bark pressing into the soft material of his shirt and the occasional stray curl from Sherlock’s head brushing into his cheek with the soft breeze.
“To see your paintings of course. You never do allow me to come into your studio.” He rose an affronted eyebrow
He kissed the small brown freckle on his hip lightly, suggestively. “Sherlock,- can I? please?” the artist’s cock twitched in anticipation, John’s mouth watered just observing it. It was just as gorgeous as Sherlock was, long, throbbing and lying full and flat against Sherlock’s stomach, slit weeping vigorously.
Now, as soon as class was over John had slipped on his robe but had made no move to change, pick up his things and leave the classroom. The students, clearly exhausted after the day were leaving quite rapidly so Sherlock didn’t have to pretend to fiddle with his pencils for too long before John approached his desk. The last student left and closed the door behind them, and John instantly beamed up at Sherlock shyly. “Hey”
He jumped to another drawing, “I can barely read military career in these thighs, Mike!”
He measured and moved and sketched and soon enough John Watson was staring at him from the page. His marked square jaw emphasised and marked by the strong shadows he remembered from the moment he stepped into the room, the sharpness and deepness of his midnight blue eyes and the shocking golden lightning of his hair falling onto his forehead. Even without colour, Sherlock was able to show the subtle changed in the skin of John’s sun-kissed face neck and arms with his slightly paler chest.
“You… okay?” John asked
The flashes of the cameras sparked all around him. Not too many, it wasn’t as if he was a super-star or anything. Then again, this gallery, one he shared with many up and coming artists in London was quite a big deal and the publicists were pouring in. He’d prepared his portraits for months now, the last few which had resulted in his very best works, all his portraits of John. He’d ended up centering his whole section of the gallery on solely him. His muse.
“Nothing Irene. I’m fine”
The Gryffindor realised his hands were clenched into fists on top of the table, bunching up the red mantel into crushed waves of fabric. He let them go abruptly. “Oh. Yes. I’m… I’m fine. Perfect.” He shrugged.  “Why shouldn’t I be?” he muttered, forgetting himself.
But then again, maybe the best part of the night had been reaching for books behind Sherlock, purposefully pushing his chest against him, or brushing their hips or arms or whatever limbs were closer together in an intimate caress. Everything in the darkness was heightened to the point where even a tiny shared look, stolen as they both lost their focus on the actual words on the papers and grew more focused on each other, felt loud and immense in the still unbroken quiet of the night.
“You’re just not pushing hard enough!” Sherlock gasped, pushing the books harder against his clothes.
John scoured the Great hall for his friend’s messy curly head of hair but didn’t spot him in any of the tables. Finally, however, he saw his retreating figure walking towards the door accompanied by… “Irene” John hissed quietly.
“Drawer. Please” Sherlock’s words were barely heard through his panting breaths, his hands clawing at John’s back to keep him close even when his words urged him to hurry for the supplies.
“Jooohn! I’m cold!” Sherlock said dramatically.
“That’th not going to work, you know”, a soft voice said behind him, lisping his S’s as if only growing out of the habit recently.
The boy looked up at the enchanted ceiling, smiling in amazement as the soft rain that dripped steadily from the enchanted ceiling above stopped just short of his head and magically disappeared into nothingness. The candles glowed around his head as he followed the corridor behind his colleagues, hearing nothing but the flickering of their flames as he tuned out everyone in the room. Reaching up he tucked a stubborn curl behind his ear.
The students were already waiting for him, chattering amongst themselves curiously as to the lateness of their professor. Nothing like this had ever happened before. The second the black-haired professor walked in Molly had gasped, turning to Mike instantly.
This wasn’t happening. It couldn’t be.
A year later they properly met during the first Herbology class. John had seen in his schedule that instead of Hufflepuff this year he’d be sharing Herbology, Charms, and Potions with the Ravenclaws with dread, not a feeling he was alone in, however. “Oh boy. Looks like we have Holmes this year” Greg had muttered sadly.
Sherlock knew John had written him letters. Countless letters that had, in the end, remained completely unanswered… but never forgotten. How could John Watson not hate him, when Sherlock himself had made him promise not to forget him, to write him, to keep in touch whenever possible, and then proceeded to ignore his existence for the next 5 years.
Sherlock hummed into the kiss, relief palpable as his body relaxed and sank into John’s embrace. “John,” he breathed, in between wet kisses to the Gryffindor’s mouth, “I- we.. we should probably talk”.
They started with scaring Sherlock at random times a day. Equipped with 5 full boxes of ‘Weasley’s’ “Demon dung crackers” John set to set these off at random times a day when Sherlock least expected it. He
“Mmmno” the artist hummed, gripping the blonde’s shoulder’s tighter.
They left their brooms and the box of Quidditch balls hidden under some bushes just outside the castle’s entrance and headed in. They walked as casually as they could towards the greenhouse and Sherlock opened the door discreetly with a soft whisper of “Alohomora”. He locked it back with a couple of charms once they were in.
He was, as usual, ridiculously early for his 7 am class, so he took his time to arrange the canvases around the platform where he would ask the model to pose, and started figuring out what he wanted to do with the lightning today. His models usually preferred standing up poses throughout the first half of the day and after the hour long lunch break they would agree to horizontal and sitting down poses. Not really surprising, as the energy in the room buzzed down to a calm lull of concentration after the frenzied energetic inspiration of the morning. 5-hour classes would do that for everyone. So he put the chair aside for now so the model could position himself anywhere on the stage and started setting up the overhead lights.
“Well you do call her almost every day dear, no wonder she’s worried” she patted his cheek as Sherlock huffed in embarrassment.
John licked his lips, huffing a small embarrassed laugh. “It’s good to see you too, Sherlock”.
John huffed a laugh “bossy”, he murmured into the hollow meet of the man’s shoulder and neck but complied and slowly, teasingly, his hands travelled around Sherlock’s arse and squeezed, raising his mouth to meet Sherlock’s again. They kissed with abandon, John kneading Sherlock’s arse gently with both hands as the latter panted into his mouth, hot sweet breath spilling out whilst trying to press himself closer to John’s strong chest.
In front of one of the doors, several policemen stood, some discussing in quiet murmurs and a couple taking evidence photographs or taking notes of their observations. As Sherlock and John approached the room Sherlock could see another couple of policemen and women taking dust and DNA samples from the body sprawled face up in the center of the room.
Hearing this man speaking with such hatred, and unkind words made something in him snap.
“What was that, love?” John teased, squeezing his hand.
Instantly Sherlock felt his phone vibrate in his pocket and he took it out.
Well. He hoped they were, anyway.
“No! Maybe. I don’t know.” He muttered.
the kissing. Sherlock made his way blindly to his usual spot at the Gryffindor table, lost in his thoughts about last night. After he left the Gryffindor common room last night he had spent every minute before he dozed off transferring all the data from that night into his mind palace. John’s warm touch. His fingers that had been hesitant at first but had quickly become hungry and wanting. Looking back now, everything they did was quite tame. Nothing more than an innocent snog on the couch. But last night, Sherlock had felt like he was on fire. Like John had set a burning flame of desire in him. He didn’t recall ever feeling like this. Like he could physically combust at any moment just by John’s warm touch.
“Mmm... no”.
Most of the subjects he painted or drew were people. It was simply because that was his most preferred subject. He loved painting people had seen on the street as much as he loved making up different ones in his mind and coming up with entire backstories for their lives. The subjects he had seen in person also had their backstories, but these were ones Sherlock had not made up on his own but had observed on them.
“Well… he’s certainly a looker”
After long moments they finally found themselves panting into each other’s mouth more than actually kissing. They separated long enough to sink into one of the largest and squishiest arm chairs in front of the fire where they fit quite comfortably, pressed together but more out of desire to be as close as possible than lack of room. “John,” Sherlock sighed, eyes closed and both hands cupping John beautiful face. Their foreheads were pressed together as they felt each other breathe. “There’s something I should say. I meant to say all these weeks and I never have…”
“Oh… yeah. Of course, we can go there, John”. Sherlock breathed. His relief lasting only a few moments before he wondered when the blonde would tell him about the woman, and then another stab of hurt thundered through him.
“If it helps” Molly started, smiling hesitantly “We are all very happy for you both” she grinned giddily, the rest of the students all nodding vigorously and some of them hooting in congratulatory whoops.
That stopped him in his tracks. He instantly thought of Irene and how Sherlock must have been overwhelmed by her smell coming from the potion. "Yeah…" Thought John "He must be."
After a couple of moments, Sherlock suddenly said: “I met a gentleman with psychosomatic pain in his arm a couple years ago.”
John himself had been astounded, excited for his sister and a little disbelieving. He wondered how magic could be something real and tangible and how it was running in
They reached the elevator, Sherlock not having noticed Lestrade had fallen behind until the doors had closed and he found himself left alone in an extremely enclosed space with John.  Said man cleared his throat, looking down at his feet self-consciously.
The laughed quietly into each other’s mouths, trying to kiss each other but gently clashing teeth with their grins or missing and kissing each other’s jaws or cheeks, but it didn’t matter. Soon enough their joyful silly laughter died down as their kisses grew more heated and sloppy with every touch of their roaming hands.
“Oh thank goodness. Merlin knows that boy hardly sleeps.” She started putting some biscuits and sandwiches on a tray together, knowing by know that John was always hungry, even when he denied it. She sniffled again, avoiding his eyes.
He finally spotted the blonde far within the crowd of police officers. His golden hair shining with the sun. Sherlock peered around the officer’s head’s, trying to get a better look at him. He was talking to an officer; the artist couldn’t be bothered to remember her name. He was standing rather close to her; as if leaning into her space to be able to hear what she was saying due to the noise around them. The artist frowned, his stomach twitching uncomfortably at how close her lips were to John’s ear. She certainly seemed... eager?
Finally, he turned off the second overhead light, enjoying a deeper contrast with the last of light on the left side of his body. He stepped back and look at John. Stepped to the other side of the platform and stared again. He nodded to himself a couple of times before his eyes unconsciously drifted up to John’s. His gaze was met with John’s deep blue eyes instantly. He looked slightly amused at how seriously Sherlock was taking the lighting of his body. Sherlock blinked away and walked back to his desk, trying his best not to notice the fact that he could still feel John’s gaze follow him back.
see why Sherlock was bitter not to be on the fifth floor. They weren't faced with long empty corridors as he had expected. It was one single massive room.
So that was what John was thinking about when five days later just after Quidditch practice he landed on the soft grass smoothly and looked over to his best friend… and looked. And the frankly quite obvious realization hit him like a truck.
it warmer Sherlock!” John cried for what felt like the billionth time. “You do realise I've had magic for all of 3 days and I can’t control it!”
Sherlock was holding his phone with his right hand horizontally and close to his face as a female voice resounded from it onto the room on speakerphone. The phone call had been going on for quite a while, enough for Sherlock to still be dressed in only a loosely tied dressing gown and boxer briefs, even when noon approached rapidly.
The sound of John’s zipper tore through the air. Sherlock snapped the pencil tip. ‘
John stopped short “Oh right. Privacy of the artist?” he huffed an uncertain laugh
Soon enough, they reached the top of the hill and were faced with the entrance to the castle. John knew he would be heading to the right wing towards the Gryffindor common room, and Sherlock would most likely wander off to… wherever he went to after hours. Sherlock caught a flash of the same turmoil of emotion he’d glimpsed in John’s eyes earlier that day.
The closer he came, the more he realised he could hear voices. Growing louder and louder. He recognised them as Eliza and Sherlock’s father, Sherigford.
“Hey!” John cried, trying very hard to suppress his grin and look serious and failing miserably. “It’s not that bad!”
they hadn’t talked during those years.
Sherlock immediately melted in John’s arms.
“Yeah?” John took hold of the taller man’s thing hips, thumbs rubbing circles on the dipping V of his muscles, leaning in and feeling the artists delicate puffs of breath on his cheeks.
Mary smiled one last time at John, flicking her hair back with a delicate wrist movement. John cleared his throat, more out of discomfort than anything, noted Sherlock.
“He fainted in potions class? He was ..er..inhaling quite a lot of Amortentia...” John said looking with concern upon his friend being set down carefully into one of the beds and inspected by the old but still admirably strong healer.
“What is it, gorgeous?” John reached out for his hand, his gaze tender and affectionate.
Biting his lip and taking a shuddering breath, he clicked it as fast as he could. The world didn’t explode, as expected. The only difference in the room were Sherlock’s brightly coloured cheeks and the button that now read ‘Booked’.
try to ask but got a one-word response he wasn’t quite sure had been answering him or had just been some sort of thought in Sherlock’s head he had voiced to have something to respond). All in all, John found it all surprisingly adorable. He brought Sherlock some tea and a sandwich from the cafeteria, knowing very well the artist had not eaten since breakfast, and even then he’d only eaten one of Mrs. Hudson’s biscuits before he yanked John away form the kitchen and into a cab to go to the University.
They walked into class together, Sherlock giving John suspicious glances every couple of minutes trying to figure out what he was thinking, what their whole previous conversation had been about.
In an impulsive burst of emotion, he leant down and placed a tender kiss on his best friend’s temple, silently sealing his promise to keep him safe and happy and stand by him. He felt a soft curl press down onto Sherlock’s temple against his lips and he softly pulled away before standing and heading to the kitchen.
“Well, I never!” he huffed. Sherlock laughed. And John then and there decided that if Sherlock’s laugh was one of the best things he had ever seen. And how could he have forgotten that? And how had he not realised how much he had missed it?
THAT WAS SO CHEESY IM SORRY. I just... they wanted to be cheesy and I just couldn't NOT let them you know? Anyway.. interesting events will unfold next chapter if you know what i mean ;))))
