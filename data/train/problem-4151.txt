“Well, our road trip has to have room for two kids.” Dean kissed Castiel on his forehead. “And eight cows.” He kissed him on the nose and added, “A pony, a horse, a dog, a pig, a cat, a goose, three goldfish, sixteen chickens, and a donkey.”
“Yes, yes. I like what I see. Geez, Dean. Honestly, if I had been more awake, I would never have said that the other night. It’s just you were looking… I was half asleep…”
As he opened the door, he saw Sam carrying Castiel across the room in a fireman's carry. Sam carried him effortlessly and dropped Castiel on his feet on the opposite side of the room. Charlie and Jess clapped enthusiastically for Castiel, and Charlie slapped Castiel on the ass as he turned.
"So, a class you took for two years in high school and a couple of summers as a kid has readied you for taking over a farm?" Sam raised an eyebrow questioningly. "When you are done fixing the place up, are you going to raise cows and have a pig named Arnold too?"
Amelia responded, "Oops. Sorry, Cas, thought you were Jimmy." She sat down next to Castiel, apologetically.
Claire sat up, "Dad will know he's missing then. Plus, dogs or an owl might get him. Sparky is one of Dad's favorites."
The summer sun was beating down, so Dean pulled off his shirt and wiped the sweat from his brow before hanging his shirt on the fence. Castiel returned about fifteen minutes later, looking a little worse for the wear. He had smudge marks all over his jeans. He said, “Jack must have left the gate for his pen open again when he fed him before school. I’ll have words with him when he gets home.”
Dean let out a small huff of a laugh. "You could have signed the note, my mysterious benefactor, so I would know who to thank." Dean quickly made the bed. He was suspicious that the mattress was new. He'd have to figure out who to reimburse for setting the place up for him so nicely. Dean picked up the linens and quickly made the bed.
Dean stared at the hand on his knee before answering, "Like I said, water under the bridge, Cas. You did your best. We all had to make terrible choices. What was it you once said? As long as you made mistakes for the right reasons, it's all that matters."
"The cows." He patted the one he was milking, "This is Taylor." He introduced him to each of the others in turn, "This is Beyoncé, Stevie, Gaga, Cher, Barbra, Ariana, and of course, Britney. I had Christina too, but she and Bowser didn't get along well."
Castiel replied, “What the hell? Didn’t your dad see how great you are? I miss my kids if they spend the night at someone’s house. I couldn’t do that.”
Dean responded, “You don’t just have two kids. You have however many cows, dogs, ponies, pigs, chickens, and geese you have around this place as kids.”
"I'm all for the flirting. But we are roommates too. So, at some point, we might want to decide about what we want us to be. Best friends, roomies, or something else."
Dean kissed the top of her head, "Missed you too, little sis. And I do actually have a present for you. I just didn't get it to you."
"I was scared, Dean. Even though she doesn't have the kind of power necessary to hurt me now, I still feel terror when I see her. What she did to me…" Castiel took a long draw on his beer. "I have no words how that feels."
Dean looked down. It had been a gift from Gordon, and Dean knew it was expensive. He had never really liked it anyhow. He just shrugged, “It’s too warm for a jacket. No worries.”
“Then you better give me directions to this place. Otherwise, we’ll spend the evening in your driveway.”
"What I meant was your hair is like what you would have if someone had just run their fingers through it." Dean shook his head and chastised himself for making it worse.
The dance was already in full motion by the time they reached the gazebo. The pretty redhead that he'd seen Castiel kiss in the park came rushing up and flung her arms around him. Dean stepped back to get out of the way, swallowing the sudden spike of jealousy that flashed through him.
"I don't know. I just got here. I need a change in my life. I don't know what I'd do here for a living."
Castiel shrugged, "Just the one. I don't raise any livestock that you eat. But a friend of mine named Cain gave him to me one year to fatten up for holiday dinner. Bowser was the cutest little piglet. The kids immediately refused to even consider him as a meal."
He shrugged. He might as well do the lawn first. He walked over to a dilapidated shed and tugged open the door. Years ago, Henry had kept his lawnmower in this shed. The door almost fell off in Dean's hand. When he went to get the paint, he'd also need to pick up hinges. The lawnmower inside was covered in a layer of dust and grime.
"What do you do for fun? You work and you go to night school. You haven't even been going to Charlie's game nights. She is getting really mad at you. I think she's going to come kick your ass soon."
Dean pulled Castiel up to his feet and helped him onto the road. "What ending, Chuck? What the hell?"
When Castiel caught sight of Sam, he broke into a wide smile. He said something to another employee and handed over tickets before heading in Sam's direction. "Hey, Sam. I'm sorry you had to meet me here, but you know Gabe. If he can get some free labor, he'll take it." He turned to Dean and said in a husky voice, "Hello, Dean."
Claire made a face. "Double eww. I do not need to know anything about your sex life. Sam said he and Rowena are in Rio now." Sam had graduated with a degree in archaeology and anthropology. He and Rowena traveled the world looking for at and interesting antiquities. Sam loved to travel; Dean had become a homebody. Claire asked, "Have you heard from Jack?"
"I appreciate you looking after him. After Mom died, Dad was always too busy to take us there during the summers. I think Henry and my dad had a falling out before I was born. He never wanted to see him. I just wish… I know I promised to come back the next summer. I wish I had been able to do that. I'm happy he had you."
"Amelia, meet Dean, I'm going to be his new roommate. Dean, this is Amelia, she's my twin brother, Jimmy's, fiancé." Castiel looked at Amelia fondly.
“Not at all,” Castiel responded. “Life is too short, Dean, not to do something you enjoy.” Castiel looked away with a pained expression, “Jimmy had all these big plans to change this place into an orchard and vineyard. He talked to me about it at least once a week. He was close to breaking ground on the orchard when he was killed. And then, Kelly… Kelly left me too. Find your passion, Dean, whatever that is, and go for it.” He smiled at Dean sadly, “Nothing lasts forever.” Dean hugged him, pulling him close. Castiel melted into him. They stood there quietly for a few minutes before Castiel cleared his throat and stepped back and said, “Could you call Jack to dinner, please?”
Dean replied defensively, “I wasn’t worried. He didn’t have to leave me anything. I don’t deserve anything. I wasn’t here for him.”
When Dean crossed the farm to the Novak homestead and climbed a tall hill, he was thankfully not accosted by any other critters. He climbed the stairs to the veranda of the small Victorian farmhouse. A tired bloodhound sat on a tattered dog bed, chewing on a bone, near the door. She looked up and him and wagged her tail but didn't move. Dean crouched next to her and patted her on the head. "Hi there, sweetie."
John put his sunglasses on and got in his car. He said, “Goodbye, Dean.” Dean watched until the taillights faded away down the road.
When he broke from the trees, he saw the farmhouse for the first time in almost twenty-five years. He parked the Impala in front of the house and got out slowly, surveying the farm around him.
The sky suddenly darkened, and Amara appeared in a swirl of dark fog. "Brother, what are you doing?"
“I don’t think so, Dean. I don’t think there’s a one-size-fits-all for the path your life takes. If you hadn’t gone to work for your dad, what do you think you’d be doing right now?”
Castiel shook his head. "No, it was my choice to rebel. He just set up the conditions. It's like one of those Choose-Your-Own-Adventure books that Metatron smashed into my head. Chuck set up the conditions, but we ran our own race. Made our own choices and mostly they worked out."
Castiel flashed a wide smile in greeting as he saw him. "I saw you talking to Ellen and Bobby. They were excited to hear you were coming back."
Dean raised an eyebrow, “Actually, I think the opposite. I don’t think there’s anything for me in LA. I prefer my life here.”
"He dressed up as Superman and jumped off the peak of the roof because he thought he could fly when he was 8."
"I'm mad at us for wasting a decade when I could have been doing this." Dean grabbed Castiel and pulled him into a long passionate kiss. As he pulled back, Dean gasped, "That was well worth the wait."
Castiel said, “The stars remind me of your freckles, Dean. When I was a kid, I had memorized all the constellations. I was so envious because you had constellations on your face, and I didn’t. I wanted freckles like yours.”
"Perhaps, we could time this better next time, Dean," Castiel sighed. "I'll go get Jack." He tossed the keys for the car to Dean. "Can you start her please and we'll get him home?"
Castiel pulled himself to his feet, his wings flaring out behind him and his eyes glistening blue. "Take me instead."
Chuck cleared his voice, "The winner of the most romantic dance is Castiel Novak and Dean Winchester. You get the fifty-dollar gift card for a romantic dinner at Crowley's. And welcome home to Falcon Bay, Dean."
"He's my friend. I just don't know why. It's all very confusing, Dean. I think there's been some temporal distortion, but my powers have faded too much for me to be sure."
“Breathe, Cas. Breathe.” Castiel stared at him, panic rising in his eyes. Dean put his hand on his shoulder to steady him. “Cas, you are the best father I know. Those kids adore you. And I had a nanny that took me to all those soccer lessons and so many extracurricular activities that I barely had time to do my homework. Do you know what I really wanted?”
“Sure, it does. The townsfolk just try to slow it down as fast as possible. When a company put up a big box store along the highway, we had to come up with new ways to bring business downtown. That’s why we hold the farmer’s market. What used to be clothing and drug stores, now sell antiques and crafts. You have to adapt. But if you love something, it’s worth fighting for. Maybe we can’t keep it forever, but we can keep it for today. That’s all that matters.”
"’We’ didn't say anything about names. You said. I'm so, so sorry Jack that I called you twerp. I should be terribly ashamed of myself," Claire said dramatically.
Chuck said smugly, "I happened. Cas, I ignored it when you ruined the first ending for this story. I told you when rebelled and brought Dean back to the house, that you were not part of the story. What did you tell me -- we're making it up as we go along? I don't particularly like that. My characters are supposed to do what I want. I had the perfect ending for this world, and you screwed it up. But I was like, what the heck, let's see where the story takes me now. It's had some hits and misses. The whole British Men of Letters storyline, the Leviathan, not great, I know. But, man, I thought I had nailed this ending."
Dean felt guilty as he said, “I… I don’t have an excuse, sir. I guess those summers seemed so long ago that I sort of forgot about things here except as a nostalgic memory. Where is he buried?”
As they started to dance next to each other, Dean leaned over and whispered, "We can sneak out after this song if you want. Claire's got a real talent for putting you on the spot."
"Off you go." Castiel shooed them off the front porch. "Claire, thank you for taking him. Bonus allowance this week."
Dean grinned, "Don't be silly. I have a backyard I can let you out in. No need for walks. I think we'll be good as long as you are treated for fleas."
Sam nodded, "They are like this after a week; imagine how they'll be after a year of living together."
"If I don't make it out the other side, don't blame yourself. You blame yourself for so much. As you said to me, you can't save everyone."
Dean was sleeping soundly when he was startled awake by a rooster crowing. Dean slipped out of bed and stumbled to his feet. He crossed the threadbare carpet to the window he had opened the previous night. He pulled on it several times until it slammed shut with a satisfying thud. He started to head back to his bed when he heard the dulcet tones of Olivia Newton-John singing outside:
"We could have Halloween candy to give out. We could scare the crap out of teenagers, but not the little ones. We could visit Garth and you could meet his Castiel. He stares at me weirdly. We could have this, Cas. If we can just get on the other side of Chuck."
"If you ask around, I'm sure others can also share their stories about him with you. Everyone knew him. He always missed you, Dean. However, he wasn't alone. He had all of us, especially Cas. And speaking of the devil, there he is with Jack."
"Oh, I think I can handle myself," Dean looked down at his hands, "thank you, though." He began to walk away.
He was helpless, the only thing he could do was lay there. He managed to turn himself onto his back.
Dean kicked himself out of that memory. His body shook. It was like a piece of him was torn away at that very moment. He needed to get away from anything involving the angel. However, the farther he ran, the farther he got lost in memories of him and Cas. His head rang with the sound of his voice. All the I love you's and all the snarky comments they made to each other, all the sex, every single damn memory crowded around Dean inside his head. He sobbed uncontrollably. He didn't need to be reminded of how he screwed up. How he made the love of his life walk out on him, he didn't need it.
The guilt hit him like a sack of bricks. Cas had never even said 'I love you' back to him. All those times Dean had held him, and kissed him, and told him he loved him, Cas never once said it back.
She growled and scratched at Dean's face. Blood spotted from his wounds. The only thing keeping her from killing him was that he had her wrists locked into his hands. After gathering some strength, he kicked her off then went to grab the knife he hid in his jacket. Kara gasped, then there was a thump. Dean looked back up and froze.
The hunter swallowed the lump in his throat. He pulled out his wallet and left a generous tip for the barista before getting up and going.
Cas made it to the front of the crowd, he panted lightly. Then immediately, his heart dropped. He had made it just in time to watch a police officer cover.. The officer draped a sheet of some kind over Dean's limp body. Cas stared at the sight. There was blood everywhere, the snow was almost black. He watched emptily as a couple more officers had helped move Dean from the floor into a body bag.
Dean yelled Cas's name over and over, with a desperate hope that Cas, the real Cas, would hear him. He endured blow after blow from the angel, who wore a blank face through the beating. His lips would move as if he were speaking, but Dean never heard anything.
"You don't have to say it back..." He stared into the very soul of Castiel, his very grace. "I know, angels don't emotions like humans do, and well.." He trailed off, his gaze fell to Cas's lips, then the floor. He let go of the angel and turned away from him, embarrassed of himself.
"It's not." Castiel quickly stated. "And everyone who knows you sees it. Everything that you have ever done, the good and the bad. You have done for love." Cas's heartbeat started to race as Dean stared at him. "You raised your little brother for love. You fought for this whole world, for love. That is who you are." The angel felt his voice break ever so slightly. He hoped that Dean hadn't caught that. He could feel his body wanting to give out. So much effort was being put into his last words. Billie's pounding grew louder and louder with each one.
"She's putting me on some medicine Sammy..." Dean fell into his brother's hug and cried silently. Sam reassured his brother that everything would be ok.
"C-cas, don't. Please-" Dean cupped his face and smiled sadly. Castiel melted into Dean's hand. A tear slipped down his cheek.
"I always wondered," Castiel changed the position in which he was standing. The feeling of bittersweet anticipation had engulfed his entire body. "Ever since I took that burden, that curse, I wondered what it could be. What my true happiness could even look like." Cas looked longingly at Dean. Everything he's ever felt and wanted to say, it was beginning to make its way up his throat and out of his mouth. Dean just stood before the angel, scared and confused at what he might say.
"When I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned, and it would take me forever." A small weight was lifted off his shoulders for a brief second. Still, Dean's expression change added an even more considerable weight back on.
"Yeah, uh," Dean rubbed the back of his neck, "I'd say, "It won't happen again," but we both know that's not true." He grinned sheepishly at his boss.
"I'm sorry, ma'am." He helped her up; they soon locked eyes. Dean gulped as he stared into her crystal blue eyes. He observed the rest of her face. She had light freckles scattered across her cheeks, faint dimples on each cheek, and strawberry blonde hair.
Dean shrugged it off and went straight for the snacks. He figured drinking was no longer an option for him. His AA suggested strongly against it. He tapped his chin as he examined all of his choices. Someone cleared their voice from behind. Dean turned around then sighed with relief; it was only Kara. His happiness ended quickly when he remembered what she did.
Cas turned his attention to the customer. It was Meg. He smiled softly then went to grab the gas pump.
Suddenly, Dean felt the hairs on his neck start to rise. He turned around and saw the Empty, getting ready to take Cas away. Just like that. He looked back at Cas, who had accepted his fate. The door burst open to reveal Billie. Dean was terrified.
"I knew it," Dean said smugly, his face was beaming. "Date night after work then." Cas shot him a cold glare. The Winchester placed his hands up to show his surrendering. "Alright, alright, I'm sorry." He looked around as he put his hands back to his side. "No one's even around, though."
Castiel wiped his blade on the interior of his trench coat. He slid it back into the pocket where it was stored. He caught Dean's eyes. The two stared back at one another. It had been so long since they've seen each other face to face. Dean swallowed harshly, he needed to get out of there fast, yet before he could move, Castiel was already starting to turn around to leave. Every instinct in the Winchester's body told him to let him walk away. He grabbed the angel's arm.
"I dunno," he looked down to fix the position his watch was sitting on his wrist, "10:30. Maybe 11, depends if Pam has me working late or not again." He shrugged thoughtlessly. That awkward feeling disappeared. "Why, you want me to come over tonight or something?"
"How did it get this bad?" He mumbled to himself, then grabbed the picture and replaced it with the signed paper. Dean observed the image for a little longer before shoving it in his wallet. As he started the car, he thought about that night at the park and what happened after.
"Maybe he's working late after all," he mumbled to himself. Cas melted on the couch. Any minute now, Dean would be here. Any minute.
"Dean," Cas's voice already began to tremble, "I'm so sorry. I never meant for this to happen. I never wanted this. Naomi was-" Dean kissed him suddenly, and any words that were about to come out of his mouth disappeared into thin air. And it reminded him of all the movies that he had watched with Dean over the years.  When person A keeps talking and rambling, person B is supposed to silence them with a kiss. To let them know that despite everything that just happened, despite all the questions, all the raw emotions, despite everything, they love them.
"Cas, who's Naomi!" He yelled out thoughtlessly. Cas looked at him for a second, he was terrified. Then, all emotion was wiped from his face, and Castiel hit him with such force, he was knocked into the wall.
His face was met with the warm touch of an angel. No. Of Cas. His eyes opened, and he could see clearly. His vision was no longer blurred by the blood that had got in his eyes. His arm felt like it had never been broken. His face didn't feel sore, and that tooth that was knocked loose sat tight and comfortably in the back of his mouth. He looked up at Cas.
"No reason," he answered in what he thought was a normal tone. Before Inias could say anything else, another car pulled up for gas.
He took a step forward and tried to pull himself off the dumpster. As he began to peel off the wood, he felt it splinter inside of him. He screamed out.
The song just came out in December of last year. Yet, for some reason, it was as popular as ever. Dean hummed along to the tune while he sat in his living room, waiting for his partner to get dressed. He closed his eyes and smiled, resting his head on the back of the couch. The Winchester had always thought Rosie Hamlin had a beautiful voice.
Frozen, all Dean could do is watch the man's fist every time it made contact with his face. What was he doing? He knew how to fight. The realization was like waking up from a dream. Before the man could punch him again, Dean was able to kick the man and break free. The man almost looked shocked.
Sam walked into the kitchen for some more coffee but paused when he saw his brother passed out over the counter. He smiled sadly, then went to get a blanket for Dean. He knew he wasn't sleeping, so he was almost relieved to see him asleep.
"Which would've been the day after..." Sam finished. Dean nodded and sniffled. All he could do was hug his big brother before he left him to his business.
"Cas, we better get going, or I'm gonna be late again." He pulled himself off the couch, reached his arm over to the stereo, and shut it off. He looked up at the dark-haired boy, who was folding his tie into a neat bow.
"Be careful of what you say!" Cas hissed. A burning blush crept up his neck. "Someone could hear you." He licked his lips and took a deep breath. "But yes, I would like you to come over for dinner tonight..."
"But there is," the angel began. He faced Dean so he could really get a good look at him. "There's one thing she's afraid of. There's one thing... strong enough to stop her." This was it, time to come clean. Castiel avoided looking at Dean head-on because he knew the tears in the hunter's eyes would make him emotional. He needed to keep his strong suit on to be able to say what he needed to say.
"I know, but still," he stared at his lover carefully, "I just don't wanna chance it." Cas half-smiled before disappearing into his thoughts again.
"Yeah, I know, so handsome, right?" Dean joked, the barista laughed. She looked around before sitting at his table.
"Because it is," Cas breathed. His eyes felt hot, and his vision was blurry. He looked up at Dean and smiled.
"Hell no, I do not," her smile dissolved a second later, and was replaced with a worried look, "I don't know how you can talk about it so freely. What if someone hears you, huh?" He just shrugged.
Cas breathed heavily, observing the mess he made. That's when he saw it, the stereo. For some reason, all of that hot anger just faded away. Without thinking, he began to move. He dragged his feet behind one another as he walked over to it.
Even now, after seeing the love of his life, dead and cold in the snow, he's lying to himself. The guilt and nausea worsened.
Snow crunched under his feet as he made his way to Cas's. He would slow his pace to hear a better crunch from time to time, so childish. Dean was just excited to have a date night, especially at Cas's apartment. When they spent time together, it was usually at Dean's. Since they had been dating for nine months, it was strange that they had only really hung out at Dean's apartment.
"Don't worry about it, babe." She put her sunglasses back on. "On another note, one of these days we gotta go out to dinner."
Dean grabbed the collar of the trench coat and pulled Castiel into a long, passionate kiss. He felt complete again. He tasted the sweetness of his angel for the first time in a long time, along with their salty tears. When they both pulled back for air, Castiel gazed into his love's eyes, looking confused.
"Goodbye, Dean." The angel moved his hand, revealing a bloody handprint, and placed it on Dean's cheek.
He grabbed Dean by the shoulder and forced him into a nearby alley. Dean's heart raced, but fear had paralyzed his body. Before he knew what was happening, the man slammed him against a brick wall. His head throbbed.
"You waiting for anyone? You look lonely." She fingered the ring on her finger, Dean noticed quickly.
Dean cursed at himself under his breath. It was freezing outside. He rubbed his hands along his arms for warmth, and he couldn't help but find it a little funny.
"You look nice today, Cas." Dean eyed his boyfriend and tossed him a wink. He took Cas's hand with his own and used his other one to cup his face.
"Yeah, sure, of course." He stuck his hand out to the blonde. "It's a date then?" A pink blush crept onto the girl's face.
Dean's body was hot. He felt like nothing would stop him from beating this guy to a pulp. Why did he have to have so much pride? Just for being called a faggot? People have said worse,
"Can I help you?" The Winchester tensed at the presence of the stranger. He looked vaguely familiar.
A flash of red and blue was up ahead. It was an active crime scene. Cas rolled his eyes at the small crowd that was forming behind the police tape. He never understood why people were so nosy. It was probably a robbery, which wasn't too impressive. Thefts had been increasing in the area anyway. So it had to be it.
"Same old, struggling to keep my hours here as always." He shrugged, then put his attention back on the gas.
Cas grabbed the tablet, and it illuminated at his touch. Dean turned around, his face torn between sadness and anger.
Dean snapped back to reality. He looked at the passenger's seat then shook his head. He grabbed his duffel and the few books that sat there and moved them into the back seat. He shoved his keys into his jean pocket before he lay across the front seats and stared at the Impala's interior. He stared until his vision went black, signaling that the Winchester fell into an uneasy sleep.
"Dean, I'm so sorry." He pulled back, and Dean could see he was getting ready to zap out. He grabbed onto his wrist once more and pulled him close.
Dean let out a puff of air, then allowed himself to fall back into the comfortable silence. The bar was coming up into view's distance. It was around 3:00, and the place was getting rather busy.
"Good riddance," Castiel snapped back to reality and turned around. A man rubbed the side of his face slowly. "One less Nancy polluting the world." The man looked Cas in the eye with a crooked smile.
"Please never leave me, blue and alone," he sang along quietly. He tapped his fingers to the beat on the couch's arm.
He was beginning to pass the cars and the crowd. He was trying to think of something to say to guilt Dean into leaving his shift to come home. Then a guy said
"I'm waiting for this pretty blonde. Blue eyes, freckles. Her name is Kara." He smiled proudly. The barista's smile faded.
Dean stared down at his coffee. He missed it, being needed. He started hunting again a few weeks prior, but that's wasn't the feeling of being needed he missed. Dean just wanted to be able to love someone again... He wanted- he needed Cas back in his life.
"That's what Cas told me." He turned around and saw Pamela had a smirk plastered on her face. "What?" He smiled at her.
The coppery taste of blood filled his mouth, and he could barely see Cas anymore. Everything was a blur. Dean felt far away, but he could still feel Castiel's fist crash into his jaw. His arm seemed to throb endlessly
The stone fell and cracked open. A storm was unleashed outside. Thunder and lightning so loud that it was almost as if they were in the very room.
Cas's stomach churned and a picture of Dean flashed in his head. He did a 180 and sprinted back to the scene. He shoved his way through the small crowd, he could feel his heartbeat pounding in his ears. He felt lightheaded
"You changed me, Dean." Cas let out a small little laugh. He was dumbfounded at the fact that he was pouring his heart out in front of him like this.
"I'm sorry for not showing up. I got caught up with my family." Dean's stern look softened. He could understand something like that.
"Cas," that's all he could say, the angel's name. A name that rolled off his tongue with so much ease, a name that made him feel warm every time he said it. A name he knew he might never speak again, not without pain following it. Castiel placed his hand on Dean's shoulder.
Cas couldn't believe this was happening. It was a long-awaited dream come true, but he knew it couldn't last. It took all of his strength to push Dean off of him. He looked at him for his last time and smiled, then shoved the hunter away. He took a deep breath in, and then, the Empty surrounded itself around him and took him. It did the same with Billie. Just like that, Dean was the only person in the room.
"He should've at least called," the dark-haired boy scoffed. He got off the couch and approached the coat rack. He grabbed a scarf and his trench coat. "I'm not gonna let him hear the end of this..." He left the apartment and began to make his way to Rocky's.
"Mr. Winchester, your tests came back positive." Dean looked at her with glossy eyes. "Luckily, we have medicine for what you're suffering with. But you also suffer from alcohol addiction, so I have to recommend that you attend AA meetings for several weeks before I can prescribe you the medication." Dean nodded slowly at what his therapist said. Not long after, his session ended, and he met Sam in the waiting room.
A chill was sent down Dean's spine. He immediately melted into Cas's hand. That's when he knew this was real, that Cas was going to die. That he wasn't going to be able to say it back. A tear rolled down his cheek and onto Castiel's bloody hand. His body felt so hot with emotion, and without thinking, he threw himself onto the angel. He gripped him so tightly, exactly as Cas did to him all those years ago in Hell. He pulled back to look into Cas's eyes.
Cas tugged at his coat as he walked down the street. It was freezing. Dean better have gotten put on the late shift. Cas didn't spend hours cleaning his house and making him food just for Dean to flake out. Then again, it wasn't like him to skip out on an opportunity to be lovey with Cas. A voice in the back of Cas's mind was whispering that something could've happened. He shoved those thoughts away and continued to the bar.
There he was, all alone. He had to look around the room to make sure if it was true. His breathing became labored, and his vision began to blur. Tears streamed down his face. He couldn't believe that just happened. He looked to his left, and out of the corner of his eye, he caught a glimpse of the bloody handprint Cas had left. It was just like the scar he had left when he pulled him out of Hell. He placed his right hand on the blood. He squeezed it harshly, so much so that it began to hurt. He wanted to yell or hit something, or just, he had to do something. He needed to do something, but there was nothing he could do.
"Ok," he took a shaky breath, "ok, I'm fine." Slowly, he brought his head back down to look at himself. Blood dripped off the wood and stained the snow. "It's fine, um..." He began to shake. "I just need to get out of this."
"Fuck!" He swallowed another scream as he looked up at the sky. Snow was sprinkling from the clouds. Dean tried to focus on his breathing; it was short and labored. He gripped the wood tightly.
"It was Chuck, all along," Dean said quietly, an expression of regret made its way onto the Winchester's face. The sound of Billie banging on the door seemed to fade into dull background noise. "We never should have left Sam and Jack. We should be there with them now," he paused for a second, taking in his surroundings. He and Cas were cornered. "Everybody's gonna die, Cas, everybody."
Cas reluctantly backed away from the door. A heavy sigh escaped from his mouth. After catching his breath, he turned his attention back onto Dean, who looked like his whole world had shattered around him.
"Why does this sound like a 'Goodbye'?" Dean asked almost silently. His face was blank. So many emotions had gone through his mind that he didn't know what to do.
Dean could see it, all the years of pining and longing and, all of the years that he waited, Dean could see all of that in the angel's eyes. That was it; he had finally said it. Dean was always so scared of this day. He was scared to let himself love someone, in fear that he might lose them. Yet there Dean was, standing before the person he loved, about to lose him. There was nothing he could do. He was frozen. He so badly wanted to say it back but, his mouth wouldn't move.
Dean stood there in silence, he stared at where Cas used to stand. His shoulders slumped and he let out a heavy sigh.
just by the two of them walking together. Dean wanted to strike up a conversation, so the walk was less awkward, but he couldn't think of a single standard topic. All he wanted was to hold Cas's hand and talk about the time they shared the night before.
Dean didn't sleep that night. He didn't really sleep most nights anymore. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw the love of his life walking out the door, bags packed, and a determined look on his face. He'd have to face the fact that he didn't treat Cas the way he needed to how he neglected him. Dean hated himself for throwing away the one good thing in his life.
"Yeah," the man shrugged, "I saw you behind the bar this afternoon. Holding that other guy's hand, I saw the way you were looking at him too. Fucking disgusting."
"And she's gonna kill you, and she's gonna kill me." Dean looked up at his friend one last time. He no longer looked scared or regretful. All that was left on Dean's face was an expression of pure defeat. "I'm sorry."
"I love you so much. I love you, please... Let me-" The angel stopped himself. He knew he was foolish to come back. He began to back away.
"Dean..." The angel began. However, the hunter shushed him. He unzipped Cas's pants and slid them off. He grunted softly as he threw the pants to the other side of the room. Dean pressed up against his boyfriend's bulge, which caused him to moan loudly.
He stood there, frozen. Like time had stopped altogether. He felt like something was stuck in his throat. He couldn't speak, he couldn't swallow. He stared down at the bloodstained snow.
Dean stared at the ceiling in his bedroom. He had been laying, fully clothed, on his bed for hours. He would sleep, but every time he closed his eyes, his longing for Castiel grew. Dean just needed him back. He'd quit the life and be there for him. There was a knock at his door, he didn't move.
"You know," Meg leaned over her car door to look at Cas, "I outta tell your boss you're his best employee, so he knocks that off," she huffed. She pulled a strand of her blonde hair away from her face.
It was funny to him, he was laying there in the freezing snow and he couldn't feel a thing. He didn't feel cold or anything. Dean tried to laugh, but instead it was a wet cough. Guess he didn't need his jacket anymore if he wasn't even cold. He tasted the coppery flavor of blood, then his vision began to fade.
Naomi no longer had a place in Cas's head. He could think for himself again. He was a marionette whose strings had been cut. His grip loosened so much on the blade, that it fell to the ground. And without another thought, he began to reach for Dean.
"Oh, the same as always, Clarence," she replied as she took her sunglasses off to get a better look at Castiel. "How about you, honey?"
"So," Kara began. "I'm free tomorrow. You wanna go grab some coffee or something?" Shocked at the offer, Dean nodded hesitantly.
Castiel blinked and it was like the fog had been lifted. That heavenly light that had blinded him, gone. Dean had fastened a tight grip onto his wrist. He looked down at him.
Leaves crunched as Dean would go out of his way to step on them. He was so focused on that that he didn't see the woman in front of him. They bumped into each other quickly. Dean looked up immediately to apologize.
Coming out of the dumpster was a long, wooden stake. It had gone right through Dean. The man backed away to get a better look at his victim. He covered his mouth before running away.
Hearing those words come out of Dean's mouth made Castiel realize that the two of them would not leave that room alive. He realized at that moment that only one thing could be done, and he realized now was the time to tell Dean everything. Before making the ultimate sacrifice to save everyone.
"Cas, please this isn't you... Fight this!" Dean blocked the angel blade with the stone again, more thunder erupted. It echoed through the room, through the sky. Dean looked at the stone in awe.
Dean sat in the room with Dr. Gillum. She was checking notes from their previous sessions and some other paperwork. He shifted nervously in his seat. He was itching to kill something, the Winchester hadn't hunted anything in over three months. No motivation at first, then it was Sam preventing him from doing anything. He needed help. Dean gave in, and after a month and a half, there he was. Dr. Gillum set her clipboard on the coffee table and gave him a smile of relief.
The water felt pleasing on his skin. His muscles relaxed as he let out a sigh of relief. He washed his hair quickly. After that, he just stood there. He was at peace for the first time since Cas left. He didn't know why it was only a shower. Something so simple. Dean didn't overthink it. He silently enjoyed being carefree. Maybe his antidepressants were finally kicking in. He smiled softly and stood in the shower for a little while longer.
He pulled the cold, silver blade up. Preparing to execute his orders, execute Dean. This was it, the blade only feet away from the Winchester.
He needed to keep it safe, from the angels, from the demons. From Dean... Silently, he tip-toed towards the tablet.
A tear slipped down Dean's cheek. He couldn't move or say anything. All the feelings and memories he had locked away came flooding back.
Cas could feel Dean's hot breath. He tried looking him in the eye, to understand what he was feeling, but he couldn't. In his head, he was drowning in shame and regret, and looking Dean in the eye would worsen the suffocating feeling.
Dean sat in his car, staring at the bar's neon sign: G's Room. He exhaled slowly as he got out of the vehicle. He left his phone in his seat before walking toward's the entrance. He sat down on the stool nearest to the door, so he had the advantage if he needed to leave quickly. Hunter or not, in a bar like that, it was common sense. Dean waved for the bartender. A man in his late 20's walked over, a glass already in his hand.
"She said that?" Before Dean could continue, Kara exploded. "That bitch! You had no business knowing what I did!" She sighed. "I guess now I'm going to have to do to you what I did to the rest of them..." The hunter backed away, not sure of what would happen next. Kara's eyes flickered a hazel color, her pupils grew deadly, and her nails curved into sharp talents. She lunged at Dean before he could dodge her.
"You like that?" There was no reply, which Dean took for a yes, so he continued to do it 'accidentally.' Cas could hardly contain himself. He helped the hunter get his shirt off along with his pants. After that, Dean paused.
"I'm.." He inhaled the exhaled once more. "I'm leaving you." Dean's heart stopped, and he inhaled sharply. He stood still, staring at the angel. "I'm sorry," Cas's voice broke into a whisper.
"Don't... I've been hunting this kitsune for a few weeks. I guess you were the next victim. There was a long pause, then the angel clung to the hunter, squeezing his sides. "I'm sorry," he said, just above a whisper. "I was an idiot- I still am..."
"I know." That's all the angel could say. There were so many things racing through his mind that he could only muster up those two words.
Dinner had been ready for a while. Cas was just waiting for Dean to come through the door. He had been eagerly checking the time for the past 15 minutes.
Dean kicked the bedroom door open as Cas led him in. Not once did their lips part. Dean balled his hands in the angel's hair. Soft moans escaped his mouth. Cas bit his boyfriend's lip slightly before going back to exploring his mouth with his tongue. He laid the hunter down on the bed, unbuttoning his shirt slowly. Dean quickly took advantage of the angel's position and flipped him over, so he was on top. A burgundy color crept up Cas's neck and onto his face. From there, his boyfriend began to kiss up and down his neck. He bit softly on his sweet spots to make him moan softly.
"No one's around, Cas. I promise." He gave a reassuring nod to his boyfriend. Cas mimicked him and nodded too.
"Eh, I don't think so. I don't sound like her anyway." Dean joked. Then he remembered about his job and checked his watch.
"Oh God," he mouthed thoughtlessly. His legs were trembling. He felt like he was going to collapse. Cas used all his strength, emotionally and physically, to remove himself from the crime scene and walk home.
"Dean," Cas waited for him to turn around. "It might snow tonight. So make sure to bring your jacket home with you this time." Dean scoffed.
When the morning came, he moped around the bunker, not bothering to change out of his t-shirt and boxers. He didn't go anywhere, so there was no point. Sam didn't say anything about it at this point. It just became a regular thing. It made the younger Winchester miserable to see his brother like this. This wasn't Dean. It was an empty shell of him. He thought that he and Cas would always be together. He never saw this coming. After everything the angel and the elder hunter had been through together, Sam just thought that there was nothing that could break them apart.
"What can I get ya?" He asked enthusiastically. Dean looked up at him grimly, which alerted the man that he needed to get him something strong. He walked away. Dean stared at his ass the entire way. When the man came back, he had a bottle of Jameson in one hand and a glass with ice in another. He gave Dean a wink as he left the bottle.
"Yep, it's a date." She let go of Dean's hand and smiled. "See you tomorrow, Dean." He nodded as she walked off. His face was warm, and his heart pounded.
"Don't screw with my hair," The hunter grumbled. Castiel ignored him and continued to mess with his hair. Dean asked a few more times, all ending the same way. The fallen angel still playing with his hair. "Alright, that's enough." Dean grabbed Castiel's arm and flipped him over. He hovered above the blue-eyed man and calmly smiled.
"Oh," She rested her hands on his. "I'm sorry, sweetie. If I had a nickel for every time, that girl led men here and stood them up." Dean's smile was wiped off his face.
"I never found an answer." Castiel continued. "Because the one thing I want... It's something I know I can't have." He had to shake his head at that last bit. Never in a million years did he think he'd finally be able to admit this to Dean.
"Inias, can you check the schedule for me?" Cas brought his head over his shoulder to ask his colleague. Inias scoffed and fluffed his newspaper.
Dean had a decision to make; Runaway to safety, or fight. His body didn't allow him time to think because the next thing he knew was that he was right in front of the other guy again, and he was swinging.
The hunter unscrewed the bottle and filled a third of the glass. He looked into the alcohol. The color reminded him of honey. Honey. Cas liked honey... He shook his head quickly. He didn't want to be all emotional in public. He downed the liquid. It left his throat feeling warm. He filled his glass the same as before but waited before drinking it. He looked around the bar, observing all the men that stood around with their friends, girlfriends, or just by themselves. There was a man hunched over the jukebox. He had an average build. His hair was sable. He looked like Cas. Dean waited for him to turn around, eager to see if it was him. Butterflies flew all around his stomach, but the feeling stopped when the man turned around. He had scruff and chocolate brown eyes. Dean felt like an idiot, even if it was Cas, what could he do? It's not like he could walk up to him and say sorry. He turned back to his drink then froze. He didn't know why but he just froze. A tear rolled down his cheek. He blinked rapidly, then swilled his drink. He repeated, filling his glass then drinking over and over until less than half the bottle was left. Dean stopped himself. He pulled out his wallet and just slapped a random amount of money on the counter. He didn't care anymore. They could all his money. He slowly exited the bar and made it to his car. The hunter pulled out of the parking lot sloppily and swerved down the road.
Dean woke up, fully clothed, on his bed. He looked over to his nightstand and caught sight of a half-drunken bottle of beer. He shook his head in disappointment as he got up to take a shower. He peeled his jacket and flannel off and tossed them onto the floor. He kicked his boots off, then his pants. After he took off his socks, he walked over to his dresser to grab a pair of sweats. Not long after, he tiptoed over to the bathroom and took the rest of his clothing off, and set them on the toilet.
"That's why you were at the bar all day," Dean paused for a moment. He was trying to reason with himself. He should just run away. "If I didn't know any better, I'd say I thought you were into me. With the way, you were staring at me all day and such." The Winchester felt satisfied with himself, although he didn't understand why he said it. It wasn't very smart to play with fire like this.
"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome back to the station! After having heard our sponsors, we think you'll like what we have for you tonight."
Dean swam through all of the memories in his head, trying his best to avoid anything involving Castiel. He searched for something good to think about. His life with Lisa Braeden all those years ago, but he had to let her go when his life became a danger to her and Ben. It became challenging to find anything suitable, the only good thing in Dean's life. Before he knew it, he was thrown into a memory that he wished he could forget. It was something so simple, but it was a moment where Dean loved him with every fiber of his body.
"Come here, bee," he waved for him to sit next to him. The angel shook his head slightly, then revealed a suitcase. Dean tilted his head, trying to figure out what his love was trying to say.
"Fuck fuck fuck," Castiel yanked the tablecloth from underneath the remaining silverware. He kicked the chairs and repeatedly hit the table.
"I love you too," he half-moaned, half-panted. Dean nodded back to his boyfriend and then reached over towards his nightstand to grab a lube bottle. He squirted some into in right hand and pulled his boxers off with his left. Following his lead, Cas took his boxers off.
Cas sighed and almost got up to check it himself, but a car had pulled up to his station. He smirked.
Dean stared into the sky, blinking lightly whenever snow threatened to get in his eyes. Tears made his eyes swell, and his vision began to blur.
"Oh, I'm Dean." He smiled sheepishly as he rubbed the back of his neck. Soon they stood in awkward silence.
"No." He said quietly yet firmly. He pulled away. "No. I'm invisible to you. I can't keep this up anymore." He watched as Dean's body refrained from flinging itself onto his own body. He watched as Dean tried so hard to keep it together. It hurt so bad, but he had to. "It's always hunt after hunt after hunt. I see you trying to fill this void inside of you. I-" The angel looked down at his feet, trying to hide the tears that begun to fall. "I thought that I could fill it, or at least help." Cas looked back up, and his heart broke at the sight of Dean. His eyes were red and puffy, tears spilled down his face, yet he stood tall. So tall and trying so hard not to fall apart right in that spot.
Cas rechecked the clock. His brow furrowed somewhat as he made a face at the object. He even checked his watch to make sure the clock wasn't lying.
He thought about it for a minute. Why did his hours keep getting cut? At this rate, it would be tough for him to continue living on his own. Then it hit him.
"Because you cared, I cared, I cared about you. I cared about Sam. I cared about Jack... but I cared about the whole world because of you." He took a long pause to look carefully at Dean. I mean, he had been looking at Dean this entire time, but this time it was different. Castiel needed to look at every detail, every freckle on Dean's face.
Dean sat quietly while he waited for the barista to bring him coffee. He had been waiting for Kara for 10 minutes. When she got his coffee, she looked at him oddly. He looked up and caught her staring.
"It'll be fine. I know when to draw the line." He dusted the front of his apron down then looked up at Pam with a shit-eating grin. "Hey, can I get off early tonight?"
After attending his first AA meeting, just as his Doctor recommended, Dean sat in the cheap fold-up chair and examined his wrists. They were raw, so much so that there were scabs from previous bleeding. Whenever he thought about Cas, he would feel that he was just a toxic stain in the world. He'd scratch his wrists without even knowing. The counselor who ran the meetings walked up to Dean and handed him a signed piece of paper. His Doctor needed proof that he was there. After he got his paper, Dean got up and went to his car. Dean opened the visor on the driver's side to put the form there so he wouldn't lose it, but he caught sight of a picture that made his healing heartbreak again. It was a picture of Cas looking up at the stars from the grass at a park. His soft smile and the way he was sitting, he was so happy that Dean could see the faint crow's feet in the creases of his eyes. The ex-hunter sighed sadly.
Castiel looked at his friend. The feeling of pure terror had flooded his brain. He didn't know what to do or what to say. All he could do is listen to Dean. The banging on the door made its presence known before fading back into the background.
Dean stepped foot out of the bunker and took a deep breath, embracing the crisp autumn air. It was the first time he had left on his own, not for AA or therapy. He was happy. Sam came out soon after, he had a huge smile plastered on his face. He was so proud of his brother. Dean wanted to walk around the wooded area by the bunker just for a while. He wanted to see the part of life where there were no monsters, no worries, no Cas, nothing that could harm Dean. Sam checked his phone to see what time a burger joint would open around town as he walked off.
"No, it's ok. I wasn't paying much attention either." She giggled slightly then looked up at Dean slowly. "Um, I'm Kara."
This game of pretending to be straight because he was terrified to admit the truth, this was Castiel's hell. The hell he deserved to rot in.
Dean seemed almost hurt by Cas jerking away, but then again, he was used to it. Cas was always so tense, so afraid of the intimacy that Dean wanted to have with him. Instead of acting cold towards Cas, he squeezed the boy's hand.
The hunter jerked awake, banging his knee up against the steering wheel. He cursed loudly to himself, rubbed his eyes, then sat up. Dean tapped the wheel before checking his watch. He had only gotten 3 hours of sleep. It was 2:39 am, and he needed a drink. He put the keys in the ignition then sped down the road a few minutes later.
Dean finished up his conversation. Jody said her goodbyes and hung up. With a sigh, Dean sat down on his bed. He ran his fingers along the arch of his nose. Still no idea on the whole fallen angel situation. All Jody had come up with were people who had tried to kill locals, claiming they were angels. Other than that, nothing. Dean fell back onto the bed he stared at the ceiling. He was observing the cracks and water stains. Dean's bedroom door creaked open, revealing Castiel. A fallen angel. Without looking up, Dean gestured for the angel to close the door and come closer. Cas sat next to Dean. He played with his messy hair.
"Cas..." Dean choked out. "I'm sorry. I- You can't. Please. Let me fix this. I will fix this, fix us." The Winchester was trying to convince himself that everything would be ok, that Cas wouldn't leave. That his entire world wouldn't walk out of the door right then and there. The angel choked back a sob, walked over to Dean, and planted a long and soft kiss on his lips. When he pulled back, Cas looked into those green eyes. His blue ones spilled fresh new tears.
"Cas," he whispered, he gave a small squeeze on his wrist. Cas had a sad, regretful smile on his face.
"Cas? What's going on?" Dean got up, leaving his beverage dripping lightly onto the floor. He stepped towards his boyfriend and tried to grab his hand. Castiel pulled away. He let out a shaky breath.
Blade in hand, Castiel had a death grip on Dean's broken arm, he could see his face flash with pain as he squeezed harder.
"What time do you get off tonight?" Cas finally spoke. He shifted his attention to the taller man, who was already smiling at his voice.
"I'd quit for him." Dean propped himself up on his right elbow. "The life... I would now, anyway. You know, I pictured us with a family at some point. I don't know why, but I did." He looked down at his finger as he chuckled, tears welled in his eyes. "I was going to-" Dean's voice broke slightly, though he cleared his throat so it would be hard to notice. "I wanted to marry him, Sammy. I had bought a ring and everything. That night, when he walked out, the ring was right in my pocket. I was going to do it on our anniversary."
This time he charged head-on, full intentions of trapping the man on the wall, just like he did to Dean. When the two met, the man clung to Dean and forced him onto a nearby dumpster. The Winchester felt a white-hot pain. He tried to move forward, but he couldn't. It felt like someone was dragging glass through him.
"Water under the bridge, man. You saved us from Raphael jump-starting the apocalypse again. It's all good."
"Taylor is off her feed. She could just be having a bad day. She's entitled just like the rest of her, but she's usually the first to the hay and the last to leave. It's probably nothing." Castiel looked worriedly at her.
“The family business. I put everything into it for you and Sam. Did you think I worked those long hours because I liked it? I wanted to leave you and Sam something to be proud of. Something that mattered. I did it all for you.”
Claire said, "Jack, when you're done helping Dean, go straight home. I'm going to ride Penny. And don't bother Dean too much if he gets busy." She added shyly, "If that's ok with you, Dean?" After Dean nodded, Claire took off back to their house in a trot.
Dean answered, "He's doing well at Stanford still. He's acing his civil engineering classes. He can't wait to build renewable power something or other. I don't understand half of what he says. But he's good."
Dean took the box and left. After signing the paperwork, he drove to his and Henry’s favorite fishing spot. They used to sit there for hours, along with Castiel, waiting for that one big fish Henry always talked about catching, an ancient catfish that he’d often see that always outwitted him. They never caught it, but the hours spent in each other’s company was its own reward.
Dean choked on his jerky. "Not for nothing, Cas, but last time someone called me their man, I got laid. So you might want to watch your wording there."
Dean thought about the turn his life was about to take. It would be a new adventure but he definitely wanted it to be with Castiel. “You're amazing. Don’t ever change, Cas.”
"It's a lot safer than hunting. Sometimes, it's boring. But I can't take Elena and the twins hunting, can I? Hauling kids on the road ain't the life." Claire had saved a young, pregnant woman from a vampire on a hunt two years previously. They had hit it off and before they knew it, Claire was settled down in Sioux Falls with a wife and two girls named Samantha and Deanna.
"Well, Grams says to always follow your heart. She's pretty wise. But I better go cut her off from the punch bowl now. She's getting a little feisty over there." Jessica pointed across the crowd to where an older woman had a group of men around her, talking to them animatedly. "She might start a bar fight again. You never know with her."
Dean whispered to the walls, "I'm sorry, Henry, that I didn't come back earlier. I'm here now though."
Dean felt relieved. He as picturing Castiel Novak as a guy who taught preschoolers and would also bring colds and things from the kids home. He was a high-school drama teacher, so they should have things in common. "Hey, Sammy?"
Castiel put a hand on Dean's shoulder, "It's more than ok. It's greatly appreciated. Between running this place and my writing, I sometimes can't give them the amount of attention they deserve. Being a single parent isn't always easy, but it is worth every minute."
Charlie, right. Dean loved the red-headed geek like a little sister, but she had an impulse that if anyone showed the slightest bit of geekiness would immediately be incorporating into their little ragtag team. He used to go to game night, but because of a night class he was taking, he hadn't been able to attend for a couple of months. Dean looked at Sam, "So, he's got Charlie's seal of approval."
Castiel gave a bitter laugh, "My rebellions ended up with Naomi drilling into my head repeatedly until I complied. The whole rebellion thing didn't usually work for me. This time seems to have stuck, but when I saw Naomi…" Castiel trailed off.
Castiel chided her, "It's not like that, Amelia. He really is my roommate. You know the type that you find in a newspaper to share an apartment with."
Dean regretted taking the backroad back to their small town. He should have remained on the highway instead of driving through the twisty, dark, overgrown road. He wanted to show Castiel a favorite fishing spot where he and Sam used to go when they were young. With as dark as the night was, Castiel wouldn't be able to see it anyway.
When they were kids, they had bonded. His mom had commented that Castiel and Dean must have known each other in a past life, and Castiel's mother had marveled at how close they were. Castiel was reserved and didn't make friends easily, but they were joined at the hip the moment they met. Dean still felt whatever that connection was now, even though they hadn't seen each other in twenty-something years. Only now, it was tinged with attraction. Dean flopped on the bed. It wasn't a good idea to be crushing on your neighbor the first time you see them as an adult, especially if he was going to stay in Falcon Bay for an extended time.
Claire was half under the truck with only her lower legs and purple Converse sneakers poking out. As she pulled herself out from under the truck, she hit her head on the frame. "What? Ouch! Easy there, I'm just looking for our rooster."
Jack batted at Claire, "Last week the only one who saw Dad was us and the cows. And Bowser. And Roberta. The Colonel. Penny…"
Castiel tilted his head, "Sam told me about your girlfriend, Lisa. He said you two were together for five years, so I assumed."
“Good things do happen, Dean.” He paused before asking nervously, “Speaking of gifts. I have the gift certificate for Crowley’s. Would you like to go to dinner with me tomorrow night? The kids will be staying with Jody, so I’ll be at loose ends here.”
Jack nodded sagely, "Makes sense. I'll take Roberta for a walk." As Jack picked up the leash, Roberta let out a sigh and stood up slowly. She begrudgingly followed Jack, even though it was obvious she'd rather be taking a nap.
"California girl born and bred. I got my law degree at Stanford, but I moved here a few years ago to be closer to my grandma, Mildred. She's getting on in years. I realized if I didn't come to spend time with her, I never would have a chance. Don't tell her I said that though or she'll try to ground me."
Dean grumbled, "For fuck's sake. Whatever could go wrong, is going wrong. I'm sorry for the shitstorm this has turned into, Cas."
The DJ announced, "It's that time for the special dance of the evening. Grab your special someone and let's get started." Blake Shelton's song, 'Austin', started to play as the lights dimmed.
The dog yawned widely and licked his hand. The view from Castiel's porch was amazing. Dean could see down to the lake. The tops of some of the houses had smoke coming from the chimneys. The rising sun shimmered across the water. Dean froze. It looked like something from a painting.
Dean spent the afternoon cleaning up his files and sorting things for his eventual replacement. He was determined to give his dad a resignation letter that day and then walk out the door. He suspected his father would fire him as soon as he resigned, so it didn't seem important to give his two-week notice.
Charlie jumped up and down excitedly, "You found the Leia I was missing for my collection!" She smothered Dean's cheeks in kisses, and repeatedly said, "I love you," to him about a dozen times.
Castiel gave up and put his head on Dean's shoulder. Dean closed his eyes and swayed with him. He could feel Castiel's hot breath on his cheek. His heart raced as Castiel moved closer, wrapping his arms around Dean's neck. Dean settled his hands on Castiel's waist. The world melted away as they danced. It wasn't until there was a sudden round of applause that Dean snapped out of it. He realized that the music was no longer playing and everyone in the gazebo was staring at them.
Dean laughed, "That's not too difficult. Sam is the size of a moose. It would have been a better dare to have Castiel try to do it."
Castiel leaned forward gingerly and kissed Dean without brushing their clothes together. They both tasted like a peach. Dean rumbled, "Actually, I’m going with sexy."
"Just flow with it, Dean. Maybe you need some whimsy in your life. You are so structured and regimented. Let loose."
Sam nodded and offered it to him. "Dad asked me to get some legal documents from his safe because he was busy. I found that envelope buried under a lot of Dad's papers. It was addressed to you, so I 'borrowed' it."
"Dean," Castiel looked for the words. "You know I lost you, Sam, and Jack and I changed history to prevent that. What I failed to tell you was Chuck is the one that killed you. He killed Jack and then…" Castiel shuddered.
“Not at all. I’d ask you to join me on the dock, but I think we’d both end up in the water. This dock just isn’t what it used to be.” He stood up and reeled his line in. He laid the pole on the dock and said, “Let’s walk.”
"Well, don't fully commit to wearing overalls and work boots yet. The newness might wear off and next week you'll be yearning for the lights of the big city." Sam laughed.
Dean huffed as he tried to keep with Sam's long strides. Sam ran every morning; Dean would rather sleep late. Dean gulped in air, "Can you just slow down a little bit, Sam. You're going to give me a heart attack before I'm 40 at this rate."
Dean watched Castiel's hand on his own. He stared at Castiel as he was trying to get a read on him. Castiel squinted and looked at him, tilting his head. Dean was vaguely aware of someone approaching the table but was startled when a woman hugged Castiel from behind.
“I’ll talk to you later, Sam.” After Dean ended the call, he walked over to Castiel, “Sorry, that was Sam.”
Castiel looked worriedly over his shoulder, “Doc thinks she’s just a little under the weather. She gave me some vitamins for her.”
As he crossed over the yard to the house, he heard voices in the barn. Castiel was murmuring to a cow in her stall as Dean investigated. He was still dressed in his farm clothes and work boots, as he stood next to the cow, petting her head.
Sam laughed, “You barely got there, Dean. Dad’s handing you everything you asked for on a silver platter and more.”
“The estate is easy. Henry left the farm to you. It’s the original acreage plus an extra five acres that he purchased right before he died behind the farmhouse.”
Sam responded, “I swear I didn’t tell him, but he found out you were in Falcon Bay. He lost it for a while; he accused Grandpa Henry of poisoning your mind. Yesterday, he started to have me do some additional research into your proposal to answer some questions that he had. Then, today, he approved the whole thing.”
Understanding flashed across Dean's face. "You're trying to protect Jack, so he doesn't get in trouble. I get it. I have a younger brother too."
Dean sighed, “I hope the apple thing wasn’t a one-time trick.” He returned to his house and retrieved some wire and posts to repair the fence. He was working on the fence when he saw Castiel and a woman in a blue jacket emerge from the barn. They talked for a moment before the woman went to her pick-up truck to retrieve something. After handing a package to Castiel, she drove off.
Jessica shrugged, "I have time for that later. Right now, I wouldn't miss a minute of being with Grams. She seems invincible right now, but time moves forward for all of us. I've learned so much from her. Do you work for your family’s publishing business like Sam?"
"Sam called the station. You missed the check-in call last night. He couldn't get you on his phone."
Dean sighed heavily. He walked into the kitchen. His brows furrowed when he saw a fresh loaf of bread and a bowl of fruit on the counter. He opened the fridge and found milk, cheese, butter, and eggs. He glanced in the pantry and saw a variety of staples neatly sorted on shelves. Either someone was living here unknown to Dean or someone had gotten it ready for him. He guessed the latter. He wondered if it was Ellen. She had been his babysitter all those years ago when Henry and Mary would visit the neighbors. She always fussed at Henry and brought him fresh produce and pies from her parent's business. The Harvelle's Roadhouse was the happening spot in town. Not that there was a lot of excitement in this town, but when there was, it usually happened at Harvelle's.
After he finished, he wandered into the bathroom. It gleamed spotlessly. Fresh towels were on the counter. The shower had shampoo and body wash in it. A new toothbrush and toothpaste were placed next to the sink. "Well, whoever you are, you sure thought about everything. I'm going to bake you a friggin' pie. You're awesome."
“No, I read it somewhere, but it’s because I liked your freckles that I remembered it. When we were little, probably the first time you came to Falcon Bay, I drew freckles on my face to make it look like yours. My mom had to scrub me with soap and alcohol because I used a permanent marker. I guess I really liked freckles.”
“You are part of the family business in LA. The Winchester name means something. The brand means something.” John curled his fists belligerently. “I’m not going to keep this offer open, boy. If I leave without you today, don’t ever return begging to come home.”
“No. I want to do this. I think we just need to talk first.” The sudden ring of Dean’s cellphone shattered the moment. “Dammit, we can’t catch a break,” Dean said grumpily.
"Well, do you know who might have been the saint who put food in my fridge and provided clean linens?"
"Filled their feed hoppers. They came scrambling. Sparky must have been out of hearing range. He likes to come over here when he's loose, so I thought I'd take a chance."
In the distance, they could see that Castiel had arrived at the food court. He was already ordering when the others caught up. Castiel handed them cold sodas before saying, "I ordered a bacon cheeseburger for you, Dean, and a chicken sandwich for Sam."
"And I'll do my absolute best not to leave you, Dean. But if I do, let me go. I'm fighting for the world, and I'm fighting for us too. But, most of all, I’m fighting for you. Metatron was right. It was really all about one human."
Dean smiled sadly, “At least I’ll be living. I wish you luck in everything that you do, and I hope it brings you happiness. I’m going to walk a different path. The Winchester name means something here too. There, maybe it’s on the top of some fancy building in LA. Here, it’s in the hearts and souls of the people of the town. You’re welcome to visit whenever you’d like. I hope you do. It’s never too late.”
Dean opened the envelope and pulled out some documents. He glanced through them before handing them to Sam, "Do these say what I think they say?"
A short, dark-haired man, with a bushy beard, came out from the sideline. Holding a microphone, the man said, "And this year's winner of the Spring Festival dance is Cas Novak and his partner…" The man paused, "Who is this man?"
Castiel flipped through a photo album while he sat on the front porch of the house at Singer and Sons Salvage. He smiled as he touched each picture: Sam and Rowena at Stonehenge; Jack and Claire on a mule ride down the Grand Canyon; Mary and Bobby sitting in front of a Christmas tree; Dean and Castiel sitting in beach chairs in matching Hawaiian shirts, sipping fruity drinks. The last five years had been a blessing. Living an ordinary life in an ordinary little town was the best ending he could dream of.
Castiel turned his attention back to stargazing, "I wouldn't change a thing. You, Sam, Jack, and Mary are my family. I love all of you. Well, I would have avoided Jack losing his soul if I could."
Dean adjusted his tie once more as he looked in the mirror. He used a small amount of hair gel to spike his hair up a little and then almost undid it until he decided that it was fine. He changed clothes about five times before he settled on blue slacks and a black jacket with a pale pink tie. He wondered for a minute if he should change the tie out for a green one but panicked when he glanced at the clock. He rushed outside to the Impala and could see Castiel waiting on his porch in the distance.
"Come to the roadhouse when you have a chance. I'd like for you to meet Jo and Ash. We can have a few drinks, chat about Henry. I'm sure you have a few questions."
"Henry treated Mom like a daughter. I never met Mom's dad, but I think he was focused on his work. He didn't mind dragging Mom all over the country. She always wanted a traditional family, and I think she found it here. Falcon Bay has a magical aura, Sam. I'm feeling it already and I've been here all of one day."
She kissed the back of Castiel's head before saying, "Hi, Babe. I’m glad you escaped Gabe early. Do you want to stop by the pools to do laps before we go home?"
"Claire named her when she was four. She wanted to name her Bobby after Bobby Singer, but Bobby wasn't so hip on that. So, we named her Roberta. Claire calls her Bobby when Bobby's here just to annoy him. She excels at trolling people."
Dean was full of regrets at the time he missed spending with Henry. He should have fought his father harder to come back. He could have figured out a way to sneak here. All the 'could-haves' or 'should-haves' percolated in his head. Truthfully, Dean knew there wasn’t much he could have done to get John to bring him here. John was dead set against Henry. Whatever wedge had developed between the two men was too insurmountable for them to overcome in Henry's lifetime.
Dean frowned, "You also told Jack to stop killing Nick, and told us Mom was with Rowena. Rowena doesn't remember a damn thing."
"I'm just picturing you in overalls, a flannel shirt, a John Deere hat, and a piece of straw hanging out of your mouth."
"We've both been flirting with each other. Neither of us bright enough to know the other was flirting." Dean laughed. “We’re a couple of smooth operators.”
He headed towards the source of the music, realizing it came from the neighboring Novak farm. He pushed through a few shrubs lining the property and hopped the fence. The music was radiating from a red barn. He walked across the well-kept lawn to the building. Right as he reached its door, a deep gravelly voice started singing along with Olivia:
After the meals were handed over, the three of them sat on a picnic table in a corner of the food court.
"We should have stayed retired instead of going werewolf hunting. I never really realized how much I kept you and Sam in good repair all those years."
Castiel whispered, "I tried to tell you we were entering the dance for the most romantic couple of the evening, but we were kind of um… caught in the moment."
Dean stopped and indicated an old tree with branches that ran parallel to the ground. They sat on the branch. “I care about you, Cas. A lot.”
Dean snorted and took a sip of his beer, "It was damn impressive, Cas. But I thought you were a total dick."
"You aren't wrong, Dean." Sam chewed on his lip thoughtfully. "The market for physical books is dying and Dad won't fully commit to digital publishing. The company is becoming a dinosaur. Dad thinks eBooks are a trend." Sam rolled his eyes.
Castiel hesitated before saying, "You are more than welcome to come with us if you like, Dean. It's a community event."
Dean patiently explained to Jack what each tool was and what he was doing. Jack listened and solemnly handed him tools as Dean asked for them. The morning passed quickly. Dean did what he could do before he had to go to the auto store to pick up parts. As they started to clean up and wash the grease off their hands, Claire reappeared riding a bay mare and said, "Hey, Jack. Lunch is almost ready. Dad says to invite you too, Dean. You'll like it -- he makes pizzas on Sundays. They’re delicious. He's a great cook. We're really lucky to have a dad like him."
"No, dumb ass. I have felt that way for years, but I didn't think you would. Why did… How did we not remember this? I thought the first time I met you was in the barn."
Castiel winked awkwardly, "I can also juggle, ride a unicycle, speak three languages, and make lasagna from scratch. And apple pies."
Sam started to pack his stacks of paper back into his briefcase, "I'll check it out and get back to you, Dean.” He stood up to leave, “Bye, jerk."
Dean took a step toward him when Claire's voice broke in, "Umm, Dad. Not to interrupt, but you locked the door when you came out. Do you have the key, or do I need to knock and wake up Jack?" Claire looked at them both guiltily.
Castiel looked like he wanted to argue the point but slowly nodded. As Castiel reheated the spaghetti, he said, “I’ve told you quite a bit about me, Dean. What’s your story? Why did you come here now?”
Dean hung up the call and started to get ready for bed when he heard a crashing noise outside. He went to his old room and grabbed a baseball bat before he went outside to investigate.
Castiel looked solemnly across the crowd, "She went to school with me in Boston. I wouldn't have made it through college without her. Growing up in Falcon Bay doesn’t prepare you for the big city. Charlie took me under her wing when I was flailing about miserably and put me back on my feet. After Kelly died, she moved here. I think she thought I'd never make it through life without either her or Kelly to keep me in line. Charlie's family."
Dean sighed as he thought about his long-time boyfriend. It had taken a lot for his father to accept Gordon, but now the two of them were thick as thieves. Dean talked to him the previous night about quitting the firm. Gordon had freaked out about the idea. Throughout the conversation, it became increasingly apparent to Dean that he was much more concerned about the current luxuries Dean got from working for the firm, like vacations and cars, than he was about Dean himself. The spark had been fading from their relationship for a while, last night Dean felt like it had gone out altogether.
Jody said, "They're good kids. They can't cause any more mayhem than you and Dean did when you were little."
Dean cleared his throat and broke the silence, "It's all water under the bridge. At least we got Jack back."
He walked over to the old truck and put his hand on the fender. He smiled as he remembered how his grandfather taught him to drive the truck when he was eight. Henry tied bricks to the pedals so Dean could reach them. Henry and Dean had driven that old truck all over the farm. Sometimes, a kid from a neighboring farm, Cas Novak, had joined them as they drove to the old fishing hole on the edge of the lake.
“Only you, me, and Charlie. I’ll tell Jack when he’s older. Please don’t tell another living soul.” Castiel sighed, “I was getting mixed messages from you. I thought I was flirting with you. But you didn’t realize it."
"Dad will disown you, Dean. Are you ready for that? You know how he is about loyalty and the family business."
Jess, Sam's tall, willowy blonde girlfriend piped up, "It's not a birthday present, Dean, if you forget to give it to them."
"If I don't make through this, promise me that you'll let me go. That you'll go live that life you described for both of us. All I want is for you to be happy. You deserve that, you've given so much. Please promise me. We can't save everyone, my friend."
Dean looked down at the ground. “That’s what I’m trying to figure out, Cas. This place… I was pretty low when I came here. Before I can go much farther down that road with you, I think I need to figure out me and what I want.”
"Mostly, but he got some demerits because he likes Star Trek more than Star Wars and didn't know that Han shot first."
Dean crossed his arms and watched the large animal for a moment. “So, Bowser? How do I get you to go home?”
Dean’s mind whirled. He believed in the project. He knew he’d be good at it but… He was falling in love with the town… and with the man standing next to him looking hurt. He didn’t know how to comfort him. He didn’t know what to say. Right now, Dean didn’t understand a damned thing.
Dean turned around. A middle-aged man with a beard wearing overalls and an old trucker hat stood there. Dean exclaimed, "Bobby!"
"Henry knew it wasn't your fault. He was also quite insistent that you'd come back. I have a couple of little things for you if I can figure out where I put them. It's been a long time. Welcome home, Dean." She looked at Bobby, "Come on, old man. You promised me you'd help me haul some of Cas' honey to the roadhouse."
Jealously unfurled within Dean. He scoffed at himself because he literally only met Castiel an hour ago. He plastered a fake smile on his face and looked up at the woman as he pulled his hand abruptly from Castiel's.
"He's why I couldn't get you to come with me before. He has your heart. That's how I found you. I'm going to give you what you need."
He stripped down to take a shower. The tension from his long drive disappeared as the hot water sluiced over his neck and down his back. After taking a long shower, he pulled some sweats out of his duffle bag to wear and climbed tiredly into the bed. Even as tired as he was, he couldn't seem to find sleep easily.
Claire interrupted, "A tie, Dad. Really?" She looked at Dean meaningfully, "It's almost as if you want to impress someone."
“It’s a wonder Cas has any animals left between escaping chickens and pigs,” Dean conversed with the pig. The pig squealed in agreement.
“He wasn’t. He was cremated and spread across the lake near your old fishing hole. You’d have known that if you had asked.”
Dean offered his hand to shake on the deal. Castiel shook his hand but let his hand linger several seconds too long.
Castiel gave a short bitter laugh, "Yes way. I wrote my first novel in college. It sold. When I graduated from college, I authored a new novel every summer while I taught. I always kept my writing on the down-low, because its themes are not for minors and somewhat controversial."
After having some bitter words with both Gordon and his father, Dean's week passed in a whirl. He moved his furniture into storage and turned in his apartment keys. He purchased a new phone and gave his new phone number only to Sam. Finally, on Friday, he loaded his clothes in the car and started heading to Falcon Bay. He looked it up on the internet and the population of the town was up to 1,500 people. Dean had lived in Los Angeles his entire life where there could be fifteen hundred people in a club in a single night. His memories were of a sleepy little town, nestled on a lake. There were a few dozen farms in an area surrounded by forests. When he was a kid, the town seemed full of adventure and promise. The adult version of himself just wanted a quiet place to figure out what the heck he wanted to be when he grew up. He laughed at himself. Better late than never.
"Just in case you see my daughter Jo, you're too old for her. Just keep in mind that I have a loaded shotgun."
Claire interrupted by clearing her throat, "Get a room. Dad, I'm sorry to interrupt, but Jack just barfed all over the buffet because he ate too many funnel cakes."
A few minutes later, Castiel called from the fence, “Are you ok, Dean? I heard yelling. I don’t mean to intrude.”
The farmer's market was larger than Dean anticipated. It was held in a large park near the City Hall. Dean remembered coming to this park every Independence Day during summers to watch the fireworks. Most people were already set up by the time Castiel arrived. Castiel unpacked the truck with the efficiency of someone who had done this before countless times. Dean quickly realized he was more of a hindrance to Castiel than a help. When Castiel offered Dean a leash for Roberta and asked him if he’d like to take her for a walk, Dean took it willingly.
He shrugged, “It’s hard to compete in farming, Dean. If I really tried to work the farm, I wouldn’t have time for the kids. It would be all-encompassing. My dad had hired hands. People helped each other. I just… I wanted the kids to grow up on a farm. To appreciate the plants and animals that feed and nourish us. To understand what’s real and what’s not. Family farms are dying. I’m afraid ‘progress’ will come one day to Falcon Bay too.” Castiel ran his hand across his brow and said sadly, “I guess nothing lasts forever.”
A throat cleared behind them. Dean and Claire turned around to see Castiel in his pajama bottoms and work boots carrying a sleepy rooster. His hair was tousled, and he looked half-awake, "Is this what you are looking for?"
Castiel arched an eyebrow, "I think they have a backlog of ways to grief you because you haven't seen them in so long."
Dean smiled as he watched them bicker as they headed into the farmer's market. He noticed Castiel was bartering with another vendor. Castiel exchanged two jars of honey for a bottle of wine with a redhead who was wearing a My Little Pony t-shirt, jeans, and knee-high green leather boots. He leaned over and kissed her cheek before she hugged him and scampered off with the honey.
Dean said huskily, "Damn straight." He pushed Castiel towards the couch. Castiel backed up until he ran into the couch and fell backward. Dean scooped up Castiel's legs and pivoted them on the couch before climbing on top of him.
“Honestly, I don’t think there is one. I think Dad finally realized you aren’t a kid anymore. Plus, things are going a bit downhill in your department since you left.”
"Don't worry at least 90% was complimentary, but it's the other ten percent that is more interesting." Castiel winked at him awkwardly. Dean pondered who had taught him how to wink because it wasn't the way any other single person on the earth winked.
Castiel shook his head in resignation and looked at Dean, "You sure you want to go with us? This is the tip of the iceberg of their shenanigans."
When they arrived, Castiel and Dean settled on some rocks and watched the moonlight reflect in the water. A cool wind ruffled through their hair. Castiel took a sip of his beer and looked up at the stars, "It's nice to be outside. One problem with living in the bunker is the lack of windows."
"But then you would never have met Cas." Claire walked over and hugged Castiel. She patted Dean on the head to avoid the grease. She waved as she left, "Don't do anything I wouldn't do. And call Sam!"
Castiel smiled at him weakly, "I'm looking forward to it. We'll leave around seven if you'd like to go with us."
Castiel stretched his back and legs a moment before squatting in front of Sam. Sam leaned forward, and Castiel slung him over his shoulder. He staggered a moment when he straightened into a stand. His biceps showed some strain, but he easily carried Sam across the room and back before tossing him on the couch.
Then, there was the offer his dad made. Dean put everything he had into the company. He was proud of the work he had done; it just wasn’t his passion. It was more like a puzzle to solve. If he’d never had come to Falcon Bay, he would have leaped at the chance to finally be able to drive the project the way that he wanted. But now, he just wasn’t sure. He needed to sort himself out.
Castiel had grown up impressively. He was much smaller than Dean back in the day. He and Cas had been inseparable whenever he came. He had been much shyer than his twin, Jimmy. Jimmy didn't seem interested to spend time with Dean, but Castiel had immediately bonded with him. Half the time, Castiel slept over at Henry's when Dean was there. Cas let Dean lead their adventures, but he always had his back.
Dean called out shakily, "Good night, you two." He walked quickly into his house and closed the door behind him. He thought again about the body Castiel had hidden underneath his loose work clothes. It was going to be a long night. He was so screwed.
Jody laughed, "About as well as you'd think when you have a house full of teenage daughters and are a small-town sheriff. Super, super busy. But I'm happy. I'm the foster parent for some wayward girls, but we're finding our way. I wouldn't trade Kaia, Patience, and Alex for anything. What are you up to?"
Dean was uneasy the next morning. Maybe things had been moving too fast with Castiel. He thought of Claire and Jack. He could end up hurting them. He’d not been in Falcon Bay very long. If he were going to follow through this thing with Castiel, it would be for the long haul. Dean had been ‘the love them and leave them’ type in his youth, but now he wanted something more.
Dean carefully took off his shoes and hung his feet over the edge of the dock into the water. The small fish in the lake nibbled at his toes. He carefully opened the box. Inside was a set of index cards. Each of the cards had a newspaper clipping of a house glued to it with notes in small spiderly handwriting next to it. Under the cards was a picture of his grandfather standing next to a woman with his arm around her. Dean stared at it for a long moment. He had never seen a picture of his grandmother, Josephine, before. John didn’t have any pictures, and Henry had never shown him any.
Jess added, "We should make him go outside to drink his morning coffee. On the other hand, he might scare all birds, squirrels, and small children on the block away."
Dean huffed his way to his bedroom and returned with a vintage Princess Leia Star Wars toy in its original packaging and handed it to Charlie.
“I don’t know. Teach maybe? I was a teaching assistant for a professor in college, Professor Mosely. She was amazing. She taught English literature. She taught me how to feel literature instead of just reading it. I loved grading papers and helping students. Does that sound nerdy?”
“So, I didn’t have a lot of time for chitchat. I was busy providing for you. I made sure you two had a roof over your head and every opportunity at your disposal.”
"Sam did bad things without a soul. I forgave Sam. He lost his soul to protect us. I know Jack didn't mean to hurt Mom. My brain knows it; my heart just hasn't gotten the memo yet."
Dean stepped closer and put a hand reassuringly on Castiel’s shoulder. “Is there anything I can do to help?” Taylor turned toward Dean and nuzzled him. She left a smear of saliva across his jacket.
Castiel responded, "You do you too, Dean. And I'll do me… Someday maybe we'll do each other." Castiel tried to leer lasciviously at him, but he looked more like a half-asleep sheep.
"Just keep laughing it up, Sam. Maybe, I'll call Sarah and tell her how beautiful it is here and invite her for a visit. The Falcon Bay magic will work on her and she'll want to live here too. Lord knows you're so whipped that you'd live with her no matter where it was."
"Dean and his family are under my protection. He will always be under my protection. He understood me and brought me peace." Amara glared at Chuck. "I like this world. It has Kino, spas, and massages. Flowers. Music. It's my favorite."
Castiel and Dean were driving down a dark road in the Impala. Sheets of rain bombarded the car as Dean concentrated on keeping the car from winding up in a ditch. Castiel stared outside the car. He could feel something in the air, something out of the ordinary.
Dean touched the grey at Castiel's temples. "Still, seems like you got a bad deal. You traded immortality for a broken hunter with a GED and a bad attitude."
Castiel laughed, "Well, one tends to do that in twenty-five years or so, Dean." Castiel opened the door and called the goose in, "Colonel, come meet Dean."
"I'm just having a strong sense of déjà vu, Dean. Maybe it's just because you told me the story before." Castiel sipped his beer and lost himself deep in thought for a moment. He could distinctly remember parts of a conversation where he and Dean talked about future him, but he couldn't place it in context.
Dean snorted, "Then maybe Dad needs to sell one of his houses or cars and reinvest it in the company."
"Who's going to teach me to trust him?" Dean grumbled and hesitated before offering his hand to the goose. The goose leaned forward to sniff it. Dean yanked his hand back after the goose suddenly honked loudly.
Dean looked at the chaos in front of him. He whispered, "Amara, please. If Chuck is back, so are you. Please help me. You owe us that much. Please. I'm begging you." Dean stood and started to move towards Chuck.
Dean nudged him with his foot. "Talk to me, Cas. If you think any harder, your head is going to explode."
"Never too late. Henry moved here when he was sixty and became part of the fabric of the town. There's even a pavilion named for him at the park. The Winchester name goes a long way around here."
John released his hands slowly, “You’ll regret this. You’re going to be penniless living in some rundown town in the middle of nowhere.”
"One and the same. It's so good to meet you. Cas told me all sorts of awesome stories about you and him and Falcon Bay over the years that I moved here too when Cas moved back. You are so going to come to my house soon so we can debate whether X-Men or MCU is the better movie series. And I have Disney Plus so you can see all the new Marvel stuff. There's a LARPing event in the next town over in a month. You can come with me. You'll love it. You're so going to be my new best friend." Charlie playfully punched him in the shoulder. Dean tried to keep up with the conversation, but she talked so fast, he was quickly overwhelmed.
He turned out the light to the room. As much as he loved his old bunk bed, he'd be much more comfortable in the master bedroom.
"They look like great kids." Dean followed Castiel into the house. "Where's your wife? I'd like to meet her."
Dean rolled his eyes. "I hate the tabloid side of the business. It makes up complete nonsense about celebrities but puts in just enough ambiguous wording so we don't get sued. And don't even talk to me about having to buy photos from the paparazzi. Luckily, I worked mostly in the fictional novels segment of the business. Both sides are pure fiction, but at least I claim it's fictional and not real. Dad had to go into debt to start that branch."
Jody grinned, "Just like my dad before me. How the heck are you doing?" Henry had loved to stop by the Sheriff's office when Dean was young to share fish stories with the previous sheriff, Hank Mills. Although Jody had been several years older than Dean, she'd entertain him while the old men talked. He first learned about X-men comic books when Jody shared hers with him.
The goose waddled through the door and looked at Dean mistrustfully. "Hold out your hand so he can sniff it, Dean. He's got to learn to trust you."
Jack looked askance, "What would Chef Garth do then? He already has a pizza place. I mean Dad's pizza is better, but Chef Garth wouldn't have a job then."
"Break his heart and I'll fill your car with ducks. That will only be the beginning of the torment I will rain down upon you. I have a very vivid imagination." Claire pinned him with a steely glare and stuck her jaw out.
"Jack's tuned into his sword and sorcery movies. Sam and Rowena are geeking out over magic books somewhere. Let's go for a ride in Baby. We haven't done that in a long time."
Benny's eyes widened. "I heard some rumors that the Winchester boy had come home to roost. Benny Lafitte at your service. I help Ellen with the Roadhouse when I'm not volunteering to man the festival beer booth."
After a few minutes, Castiel pulled his car, an elderly golden Continental, up to the bottom of the stairs, and the trio got in. Claire and Jack slid into the backseat, while Claire practically pushed Dean into the front passenger side. When Roberta meandered toward the car to try to get in, Castiel called out to her, "Not tonight, girl. You stay here and guard." Roberta let out an undignified snort before settling back onto the porch, looking at them with a woebegone face.
He lost track of time, casting the line and then slowly reeling it back in. The repetition was relaxing. He was startled when he heard, “Hello, Dean.”
He flipped the light switch and was relieved when the electricity came on. He called the electric company a couple of days earlier and had talked to someone named Charlie about switching it on. She had kept him on the phone for a half-hour grilling him on what his favorite music, movies, and video games were. He had forgotten how friendly people were in the small town. Falcon Bay looked like it was still in the '50s when he was a kid. He wasn't sure if it still looked like that. He hadn't stepped foot in it since the last time he was here all those years ago.
Sam let out an exasperated sigh, "The name is Sam. Dad's in a mood. Nearly bit off my head twice. Sarah is unnerved by your leaving and keeps asking if I’m going to leave too. How's the country life?"
Castiel huffed out a small laugh. "To tell you the truth, we didn't do it for you, as much as we did it for Henry. He wanted you to have that place. He said someday you'd need a place to figure out what it is you wanted to do in life. That you would want to start over. I had no clue what he was talking about, but it seemed important to him. And in full disclosure, Henry is the reason I got to go to college. Mom didn't have the money and Jimmy had his football scholarship. When I turned eighteen, Mom told me Henry had made a college fund for me. I owe a lot to him, Dean. However, I also never forgot you for you. The summers we spent together were some of the most fun I had."
The rest of the meal passed in an easy banter between the two. Crowley did not make a reappearance until the very end of the meal when he flirted with Dean while Castiel picked up the check. Crowley was amused to see the gift certificate from the festival and asked them if they wanted to reenact the dance for him. After Castiel looked like he wanted to punch Crowley in the face, Dean grabbed his arm and looked at Crowley, “I think it would be prudent to take care of that check now.”
With a rustle of wings, Sam and Jack appeared behind Chuck. Sam bellowed, "What the hell? Jack sensed Cas was in trouble."
"Spin the bottle," Charlie exclaimed. "Sam refused to answer a question, so we dared him to carry Castiel across the room."
Sam nodded in agreement. "The margins are really thin right now, Dean. I don't think the company can afford it."
After sufficient oohing and ahhing over the gift from everyone present, Castiel said, "I won't turn on you, Dean. That gift was of sufficient quality."
He stretched and stood up. The trench coats and suits were long gone; now his uniform was jeans, no shoes, and a Led Zeppelin t-shirt. He wandered to the kitchen and placed the photo album on the kitchen table before grabbing a peach from a bowl of fruit. As he took a bite, the overly ripe peach sprayed juice down his chin. He turned as he heard Dean enter the house. Dean's hands were covered in streaks of grease, his work pants stained in oil, but he never looked happier. Spotting the juice on Castiel's chin, he leaned over and licked it off. Castiel looked offended, "I’m not sure if that was supposed to be disgusting or sexy."
Dean was driving down a back-country road when he looked over at Castiel riding silently in the passenger seat of the Impala. They had finally gone shopping for the shirt that Castiel had tricked him into agreeing to. They had a fun time. They had selected the shirt, eaten dinner at a burger joint, and walking around a park. However, Castiel has received a phone call that had put him in a sour mood. Dean heard the words deadline and publisher but hadn't pried when Castiel hadn't wanted to talk about it.
"I have no regrets about rebelling. I much rather be down here with you than with the angels. Humans are much more likable. I obviously wish I made better choices on the journey about who I should trust." Castiel met Dean's eyes and they stared at each other for several minutes.
“This is a one-horse, crap town that will probably be buried under a housing development for the rich and almost famous in less than ten years. There’s nothing for you here, Dean. There’s no future. This isn’t the life for you. You need more.”
Claire rolled her eyes. "Look, Donna and Jody are dancing. Bobby and Ellen are going to dance just as soon as Jo takes over the buffet. I'm going to go dance with Kaia, Patience, and Alex. You two should just have some fun. Dean, please save him from himself. I'll write his memoir now, my dad, the wallflower." The DJ started playing ‘Cotton Eyed Joe’ right as she finished.  She pushed Castiel gently. "Go, line dance, Dad."
"Jack means well, but sometimes he doesn't think." Claire sighed, "It's not like Dad turns into a fiend or anything when something goes wrong. He just gets this look of disappointment that makes you feel like you kicked a puppy. I rather get yelled at, personally."
A big, burly man was pouring beer as they approached. In a thick Cajun accent, the man said, "Hi, Cas. What's up? And who's the friend?"
"Good Omens. You? Sam didn't cover that piece of trivia." Castiel leaned forward and focused all of his attention on Dean.
Castiel considered Dean. He was tempted to tell him one thing. Dean hadn't understood his previous attempt in the barn with Ramiel. So, he had changed the wording. No, he couldn't talk about that. "I saw Atlantis slide into the Deep. They annoyed God so he tossed them into the ocean. Chuck apparently isn't amused by many things."
The blonde who had been talking to Rowena walked over, "Hello, Dean. I'm Jessica Moore. I talked to your brother on the phone the other day about the estate." She offered her hand.
“No, Dad. You did it for yourself. Because you wanted more. All Sam and I wanted was a dad who would take us to a friggin’ baseball game on our birthday.”
Dean replied, "I forgot about that picture." Henry had taken the picture when Castiel was trying to teach Dean how to milk a cow. Dean had not been a natural. It ended up with the cow kicking over the stool and Dean winding up in a pile of manure and straw. When Castiel laughed at him, he yanked him into the muck alongside him and had a wrestling match. Henry wound up washing them both off with a hose while he held his nose. Dean said wistfully, "I wish you had been older when we came to stay with Henry, Sam. I think you would have loved him and this place."
Dean thought back to Castiel's twin brother. Jimmy had been very gregarious and active, while Castiel was quieter and more subdued. Jimmy was so full of life and had been fearless when they were kids. Dean said sympathetically, "I'm sorry for your loss, Cas."
"We won't go far. It's been far too long since you and I just hung out, drank a couple of beers, and just shoot the shit." Dean replied.
Castiel nodded at him, "Sometimes it's not the destination, it's the journey. I left Falcon Bay to go to school in Boston. I loved the city, but I was very lonely even though I was in a large group of people. I only had a few friends like Kelly and Charlie who I connected with. I miss the hustle and bustle of Boston sometimes, but I love Falcon Bay. It's home.  Not just because the farm has been in my family for generations, but these people know me. They see me. They care."
Castiel took a deep breath, “That’s not what I mean, Dean. I mean I don’t want it awkward between us. It’s never been awkward before. Well, last night was awkward. But… when I’m with you, I can be myself. That socially awkward kid who doesn’t have to pretend they have their shit together when really it’s about to break at any minute.”
After they finished at the market, Dean and Castiel loaded the truck with the remaining wares. Jack chattered about Scooby-Doo while they drove home. After they unloaded the truck, Castiel asked, “Would you like to join us for dinner, Dean? I made spaghetti last night and just need to reheat it. It’s nothing fancy, but it’s filling.”
As he approached his house, he blinked in confusion. Charlie's beat-up yellow Gremlin was parked in front of his house, as well as Jess's Toyota. He smiled. Even though he was dead tired, his red-headed geek friend was one of his best friends, and he hadn't seen her in months. Although he also realized that she was going to be extremely pissed off at him too. He parked his Impala and hurried to the door.
“It’s a family business with no family, Dad. When’s the last time you really talked to Sam? I don’t mean ordering Sam to do things but listening and understanding him. Do you know what his favorite food is? Favorite color? Favorite rock band? How old he was when he first slept with a girl? What his favorite professor’s name was? Did you know he minored in folklore?”
"I'm fine, Dean. She's trying to be helpful. I just want to make sure you're comfortable dancing with me."
“Your car is in the driveway. You didn’t respond to me knocking on your door, so I figured you might be down here. Am I intruding?”
The front door swung open and Claire stood there in her sheriff uniform. She took their disheveled appearance and groaned, "Are you two making out on the couch again? Eww, just eww. Don't you have a bed upstairs for that?"
Dean grumbled, "What the hell? It's six friggin' o’clock in the morning." He pulled a clean t-shirt out of the duffle bag and pulled it on. It wasn't even light out, but someone was blasting seventies tunes. He liked classic rock, but not that. He marched barefoot down the stairs through the front door, letting the door slam behind him.
He heard rustling in the carport as he left the house. He gripped the bat tighter as he got closer to the noise. When he realized the noise was coming from the other side of the truck, he rounded the corner and growled, "What's going on here?"
"You two do pull off amazing feats. You always surpass my expectations. There are been no other humans like you in all my millennia. You're special, Dean, I hope you know that. You have more heart than any other man I've met. That's what pulls us through."
Castiel froze with his bite of waffle halfway to his mouth. He said nervously, "That would be me. I'm sorry if I presumed too much. Henry gave me and Mom a key so we could help him when he needed it. Charlie told me you were coming back and the date you wanted the power on by, so I got a few things ready for your arrival."
"Look, Sam. I just broke up with Gordon via text message. I wrote my resignation letter and am about to drop it off at Dad's desk. I have enough money saved to last me for a while. I'm going to go figure out what's up with the farm and get out of LA while Dad and Gordon stew. The farm is a perfect place to get my head on straight. Just don't tell anyone that’s where I'm going."
“Last week, yes. Right now, I just don’t know, Cas. It’s everything that I’ve worked for during the last ten years. It’s a great opportunity.”
"Not at all. Falcon Bay is an incredibly open and inclusive community." She leaned over to scratch Roberta's ears. "This dog is an icon. Laziest hound in four counties at least, maybe the state. I see you and Cas have reconnected. "
"You were trusting." Dean leaned over the seat and pulled Castiel into a one-armed hug over the seatbacks.
Dean smiled and agreed, “That sounds like a plan. I’ll drive. Do you want me to pick you up around seven?”
Dean sang, "Imagine there's no heaven, It's easy if you try, No hell below us, Above us only sky, Imagine all the people, Living for today."
"Thank you, Cas. It was much better than coming into a dusty mess. Did you and Grandpa Henry stay in touch then after I left?"
He caught his first fish on this pier all those years ago. Henry had somehow managed to keep a boisterous five-year-old quiet enough to go fishing. After being suitably proud of Dean catching such a big fish, they threw it back into the water. The fish was probably about five-inches-long, but it seemed quite large to his five-year-old self. His grandfather had told him that whenever you had to think through big thoughts, fishing was the way to do it. It kept your hands busy, so your thoughts could be peaceful.
The boy looked at him curiously. "I'm Jack. She's Claire. We need to go feed the chickens and then ride our bikes to town. They are showing Scooby-Doo at the theatre."
He yawned widely as he grabbed an apple from the fruit bowl and wandered into his old bedroom. The bunk beds were right as they were when he and Sam were little. He picked up a baseball mitt from a desk. It was much too small to fit him now, but it had been one of his prized possessions when he was a kid. He looked at it nostalgically. Henry was terrible at baseball, so Bobby, a friend of his grandfather's, would take him out back of his old salvage yard in a big field to play catch. He learned a lot from Bobby -- things like batting, pitching, fishing, and shooting an old BB gun at cans on a fence. He wondered if Bobby still lived in Falcon Bay.
Amara repeated the process she did with Jack. When she was done, Castiel stood up gingerly as if he was checking himself to see if anything was broken. Amara said, "I healed you too. My work here is done. There will be no more apocalypses. I will not let Heaven or Hell intervene. I've seen the value of humanity. Goodbye, and thank you, Dean." Amara disappeared.
"I never understood how he found Falcon Bay. He's from Kansas. He started the publishing firm in Kansas City and moved it to LA in the '60s. And then he left LA to come here, in the middle of nowhere, from my dad's perspective. Dad won't talk about it."
As Bowser walked toward him, Dean retreated through the gate. As soon as Bowser was through it, Dean shut it. Dean crowed, “Success!” He rolled the apple toward Bowser. The pig ate it in one bite and started walking up the fence line. Dean followed him until he saw the gap Bowser had made in the fence and he watched the pig’s curly tail disappear to the other side of the hedges again.
Something clicked inside of Dean. He whispered to himself, “Thank you, Henry.” He felt Henry’s love settle around him. “I don’t need to go home. I am home.”
"I positioned you to kill Jack. It would have been epic. I originally set it up with John having to kill Sam, but he went and sacrificed himself to save you. But he told you to kill Sam. But could you? No. This time I thought I had the whole kill the son thing nailed. It was Abraham and Isaac all over again. But you wouldn't shoot him, and then Cas here, he messed with time to stop my whole scene from happening. That is annoying, Cas."
Claire exclaimed, "Sparky! I'll just be taking him now." She pushed the box of cereal back at Dean and rushed over to grab the rooster before Castiel could say anything else. "I'll put him back in the coop and go right to sleep."
Castiel choked back a sob, "All we need to do is defeat God and save a universe. A piece of cake, Dean."
Dean hesitated before patting the nearest cow. "Hi there, Britney. Nice to meet your acquaintance. Who's Bowser?"
"Well, we're both men," Castiel said softly. A loud crashing noise emanated from the house. Jack's voice called out, "It's good. I'm not hurt."
Castiel looked relieved and retrieved sodas from the fridge for him and Dean. The four of them dug into the pizzas voraciously. Castiel's eyes filled with mirth as Dean groaned in happiness after taking a bite, "Do you and the pizza need to get a room, Dean?"
“Eight cows, one pig, one horse, one pony, a cat, two kids, one rooster, the goose, three goldfish, and twelve chickens.” Castiel supplied. “Unless we count the bees. I don’t have an exact number of bees.”
Ellen smiled, "You two were the cutest little pair. Always getting into mischief. I thought for sure you were going to cause Adler an aneurysm. Whenever a kid causes trouble in this town, he still brings up your exploits."
"How could I forget him? You had a picture of him with the cow on the wall until we moved to the bigger house."
Dean looked impressed when he saw it. It was one of the books in a popular science-fiction series published by an indie publishing firm. Understanding dawned in his eyes, "You're C. Novak? It’s one of my favorite series."
Castiel responded, "I intervened when some rather inebriated fellows decided to see if they could take out your little, but very tall brother, out at a concert we intended. Sam seemed rather outnumbered, so I helped. Then, we went out for coffee, and the rest is history. It was love at first sight."
As they loaded the truck, Dean marveled at the various products that Castiel sold. They loaded a crate of cheese, dozens of jars containing preserves and honey, fresh-baked bread, eggs, and fresh produce. As they closed the truck tailgate, Dean asked, "Did you make all of this, Cas?"
Sam interjected, "Anyway, Cas's brother is getting married in a few days. So, he needs a new place, because he doesn't want to be Jimmy's and Amelia's third wheel. You need a new roommate to split expenses because our family monstrosity of a house eats too much energy and is expensive to keep up. Voila. It's almost like you were made for each other." Mirth shone from Sam's eyes as he considered them.
"Honeybees. The garage is on the other side of the beehives. They never sting Dad, but Jack and I aren't supposed to go into the hives without protective equipment. He doesn't use the car that often. We usually all fit in the truck."
“Five minutes of my dad’s attention. He’d say hello to Sam and me in the morning before he went to work. He said goodnight at the end of the day if he made it back in time from whatever meeting he had before we went to sleep. The reason I went to work for him is I thought I’d finally get to spend time with him. For most of my childhood, it was just Sam and me and the nanny of the week. We’re pretty much all we had growing up. I’m the one that made sure Sam got clothes when he hit one of his ridiculous growth spurts. I’m the one that forged Dad’s signature on permission slips for field trips. I practically raised my little brother.”
They drove home the same route they came except when they got to an intersection close to home, Castiel asked Dean to turn left onto a side road. Dean followed the road until it stopped at the base of a hill. They climbed up the hill and reclined in the grass to look at the stars.
"Look, Sam. It's the right thing to do. You know that and I know that. Also, it's a growing market. We need to think towards the future."
"I'm sorry I'm not talkative right now. I screwed up coming this way. I didn't realize how overcast it had become."
He spied his old bicycle buried under some crates next to the house. He pulled it out. He'd learn to ride on this bike and then taught Sam a few years later. The bike was rusted, and the tires were tattered, but the memories were fresh in his mind. Dean thought of all the bike rides he took with Cas around the town.
Dean yawned tiredly as he was driving home. It had been a grueling day between the long hours working on the play with his students and his night class on writing screenplays. He had taken the class ostensibly as continuing education for his teaching certification, but he also secretly wanted to work on scripts for a television show he had developed. He didn't tell Sam these plans, because it sounded silly to himself. How would a teacher in their little town ever sell a pilot in Hollywood? But still, he worked on the scripts in quiet hours when no one was around. Well, except for Cas, but Cas just through he was continuing to work on the script for his students' play.
Crowley patted his hand consoling, “I’m sorry for your loss, Cas. Now, who is this handsome fellow? A coworker?” He smiled at Dean charmingly.
"Touché, Cas." She looked at Dean, "The problem with growing up in a town like Falcon Bay is that everyone knows all the stupid mistakes you've made. And they never forget."
"Yeah. Dad expected us to follow him in the business, but I think there's something else I'd rather do."
“I don’t want to wear out my welcome, Cas.” Dean wondered if Castiel was being kind or if he really liked his company. He didn’t want to impose on his hospitality.
Dean's mind derailed at the possibilities of sleeping together, but he quickly reined in back in. As he put the tools away in the trunk again, he thought of every gross thing he could think of to calm down the twitch in his pants... The eighth-grade teacher with the really horrible breath -- Zachary should not be a teacher in this or any other reality. The time Sam dog Bones ate a frisbee and threw up for two days. When he opened the car to get back in the car, he realized that Castiel had made two nests out of blankets -- one in the front seat, and the other in the back.
Castiel shook his head as if to clear the cobwebs. "I'll go back with you. I'll see you soon, Dean."
Dean barked out a laugh, "Ask Sam about Benny. I was with Benny for two years before he met Andrea. Love at first sight. I was hurt at first, then I realized she was his soul mate. I was the best man at their wedding."
Castiel laughed, "Is that the name kids are calling it now? Nice try, Amelia. But I'm just the consolation prize."
Castiel looked around the room at the others, "Did that sound like a dare? I think that sounded like a dare."
The old house had seen better years, but the roof looked intact. The blue paint was faded and flaking in places. The yard was covered in weeds and broken tree branches. A beat-up truck was parked under a carport. A corner of the carport was caved in slightly by the weight of the leaves on its roof with battered crates were piled haphazardly against one wall.
Dean stared at him in astonishment until he heard a loud noise behind him. He turned to see a goose charging straight for him, flapping his wings earnestly, and honking loudly. The goose aimed for his bare feet, trying to nip them. Dean yelped and threw himself back into the barn, ending up sprawled on his back. He kicked the barn door shut in the goose's face.
Castiel went out the backdoor while Dean and the kids went on the front porch. "Why couldn't we go with him to get the car?" Dean asked Claire.
He looked over his shoulder to see Claire and Jack. Jack was dressed just like his father had been the previous day, only his work boots were bright blue. Claire wore her standard uniform of a purple plaid shirt and jeans. Dean responded smiling, "Fixing this truck."
Charlie agreed, "Yes. That's true. He's the grumpiest of Care Bears in the morning. We all should just Care Bear stare him into oblivion."
Dean put his hand on top of Castiel's, "When we get on the other side of this thing with Chuck, what are you going to do? Stay on Earth?"
"I don’t get it, Sam. Why can't I get Dad to launch the LGBT romance book line? I got the numbers, I proved the viability, but he won't listen. He never listens." Dean slumped heavily in his office chair, defeated. Whenever he wanted to try something different or take a new approach, his father slammed the door shut on it. He felt like he was hitting his head against a brick wall repeatedly.
Dean laughed. "Two of my favorite things combined -- jerky and bacon. This is some mighty fine cuisine, Cas." He popped a big piece of jerky in his mouth."
Castiel smiled, "You don't say? Maybe she meant I should find an Aquarius as a roommate." He stared at Dean intently, "Maybe or maybe not."
“Cas, one more thing. Never doubt that you’re enough. You’re more than enough. I just need to figure out if I am.”
"Haven't you been paying attention, Chuck?" Bobby bellowed. "The whole town knows Dean's been here for two days. Some mayor you are."
Jess whispered conspiratorially in Sam's ear, "You're right. They are exactly like an old married couple."
The skies suddenly parted and the sun came out. Chuck stood on the road, perfectly dry, in a relaxed position with his hands behind his back. "Hello, Dean."
The pizzas were covered with an assortment of vegetables and smelled delicious. Castiel looked at him doubtfully, "They both are vegetable pizzas. Everything on them is something that I grew here on the farm. You might like meat pizzas better…"
Castiel put his hand on Dean's left shoulder, "I need you to promise something, Dean. I need you to promise me this."
Dean huffed under his breath, “He only mostly likes what he sees. Maybe I should put the shirt back on.”
Dean whirled around to see Ellen heading in their direction. She had been sixteen when she had babysat him; she now would be pushing forty. Ellen said, "Well, look what the cat dragged in. How are you doing, Dean? Is Sam here?"
Castiel responded apologetically, “I’ll go get him. I’m sorry, Dean.” Castiel left with a deep sigh.
Sam sighed deeply and slowed down. Dean immediately was distracted by a dart balloon game that had teddy bear prizes. As he headed in that direction, Sam yanked him back. He grumbled, "Dean. This way."
"For not visiting me since April, asshole. One night, would one night have been too much to ask to let your best friend since childhood know that you are alive and doing well? I mean I got it secondhand from Sam, but there's been no phone calls, no texts, no proof of life."
Castiel interrupted, "Charlie, Charlie. Give the man some air. He's going to be here at least for a while, so you don't have to say everything so fast in a single monologue. Besides, I'm your bestie."
Dean's first impression was that the house seemed much less dusty than it should be. It looked remarkably clean for a house that had sat unoccupied for over 20 years. He pulled sheets off the couch and side chair. He saw the daisy patterns on the couch and smiled. He could feel tears building up behind his eyes as he remembered the last time that he'd ever seen Henry was on that couch. Mary arrived to pick up her sons after an extended stay. Henry wanted to walk Dean to the car, but Mary insisted that he stay inside because he had twisted his ankle helping Dean and Cas make a treehouse. Cas sat next to Henry with a solemn, grief-stricken face as they said their goodbyes. Cas promised Dean and Mary he would take care of Henry for them while they were gone. Dean promised he'd be back the next summer, but... He never came back until now.
Sam received a text as he answered, "Ergo, whimsy." He looked at his phone before adding, "Jess is at the front gate of the fair. I'm going to go get her. I'll be back."
“What’s there to think about? You said what you wanted. I gave it to you. End of story. Let’s go back to LA now.”
"The farm is more real," Castiel replied. "I invent make-believe worlds, but this is my home." He gestured around the farmhouse.
Dean stared at him and gulped at the sight of his bare chest and arms. The man was built like Adonis. It must be all the farm work. He stammered, "Umm, no problem, Cas. Really. Not a problem. I'll just be going now."
"12 years ago today, we met," Dean said softly. "You came into the barn and scared the shit out of me and Bobby."
Castiel smiled, "He wants to work on energy and water projects in rural areas to make lives better. Kelly would be so proud of him."
Dean sighed, "I did, Sam. We talked last night. It went over like a ton of bricks. But I'm just done, Sam. I can't work for Dad. He treats both of us like we’re children still. I'm going to resign. Gordon’s not going to like it, but I just can't take it anymore. I’ve put almost 15 years of my life into this company, Sam. I feel like nothing I do matters. No matter how hard I work or how many hours I put in, nothing changes with Dad. I’m tired.”
Right as Castiel said that, the Impala made a sputtering noise. Dean eased it off the roadside. He growled, "Son of a bitch."
"Is it really? I can create you, and I can also take you away. How many times did I resurrect you to try to course-correct the story? After a while that detracts from the work, you know. I'm just not feeling it anymore." Chuck twisted his hand and Castiel fell to his knees spitting more blood onto the pavement.
He stared at Dean with a terrified expression, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I should go. I can get Jack and leave."
"No, you and I have always and will always share a much more profound bound." Castiel eased away from Dean and stood up. "You should get some sleep. We don't know what happens next. We need to be vigilant."
Castiel tilted his head, squinted his eyes, and looked between them. "Sam's got you beat on the hair, Dean." He reached a hand up to ruffle Sam's hair. "I wish my hair would do that. Instead, I just get this mess." Castiel waved a hand to his hair.
Castiel shrugged, "Everything. For being there. For being here. For showing me the way. For lov… For lots of things."
Dean knelt next to Castiel, who was still crumpled on the ground. Sam helped Jack to his feet. Amara looked at Jack. "I don't think I can leave him like that. He's far too dangerous, and I don't want him to break Reno."
Sam responded, "That's not the way Cas works. When he makes his mind on something he just goes out and does it. He's very spontaneous."
"Aquarius. I mean I'm a Leo, but I like people who are Aquarius. Something to waxing and waning that I don't really pay attention to, but my college roommate Meg said I should find an Aquarius."
Rufus grumbled, “Bill, there ain’t no bill, you damn fool. I did this for your granddad. He was my friend. Bring me a bottle of Johnny Walker sometime and we’re even. Now git. I have a lot of work to do.”
Castiel rolled his eyes and cut him off, “I can ensure you, Crowley, that I never particularly liked you.”
When Dean got back to his house, he stiffened as he saw his father sitting on the Impala smoking a cigarette. John was uncharacteristically dressed in a leather jacket and boots instead of a suit. Dean walked out carefully into the yard and said, “Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?”
"If I won't be a bother, I'd love to come. I'd like to become part of the community here. I think I'm going to stay awhile." Dean looked intently at Castiel. Castiel met his eyes and they stared at each other.
Dean let out a long-suffering sigh as he walked in Sam's wake. "What grade and class does he teach, Sam?"
Castiel pulled back, squinted his eyes, and said, “I wouldn’t be averse to a donkey. They’re great guard animals.”
After Jody said goodbye, Castiel said, "You don't have to stay at the farmer's market if you don't want to, Dean. I don't want to monopolize your time."
"My daughter's bloodhound. I need to finish milking the cows, but I make a mean French toast. You'll love it. We can catch up then."
The man pinned Dean in a glare, “The name is Rufus. My father was Mr. Turner. Now, why in the Sam hell did it take you so long to get your sorry ass back here? You know how much crap I had to do for you for the last twenty-five years?”
“All my cows are special, but Taylor I hand raised from a bottle because her momma rejected her.” Castiel looked at her concerned.
"No, we can go. If she's still feeling low in the morning, I'll call the vet. I'm probably overreacting. I'm sorry I'm running late. The kids are probably ready. You can wait at the house with them if you'd like."
"No worries. I'll try it. I’m always up for a new adventure." Benny stifled a laugh as he poured them their beers. Carrying their drinks, Dean and Castiel walked over near the wall and out of the way of the dancers in the center of the gazebo. Dean impulsively asked, "Are you and Charlie seeing each other?"
Dean let the dog lead him to a quiet corner of the park. He played with her floppy ears as she stood staring up at him. Roberta suddenly yawned widely and laid down. "We're supposed to be on a walk, girl," Dean grumbled fondly.
Sam sighed, "And what about me worrying about you? It's my job too. We're brothers. That's what we do."
Castiel turned to head back to the barn when he saw Dean. He scurried over, “You should have asked for help with that. This fence isn’t your responsibility. It’s mine.”
Castiel kissed him, "Immortality is overrated. I rather taste peaches. I rather taste you tasting like peaches."
Dean wished the world would suddenly swallow him whole. It had just popped out. He tried to figure out a way to turn this into a joke.
After telling the others where they would be, Dean and Castiel got into the Impala. Dean pushed a Led Zeppelin cassette tape in the player. "Where do you want to go?"
"You mean the drinks like Crowley used to drink? No thanks. I don’t like those. The rest sounds wonderful. I've never really gone to a beach just to enjoy being on a beach. The world is different when I'm with you."
Claire responded sheepishly, "Jack left the latch open. Dad's told him a million times to make sure to keep the coop locked. I was able to gather the hens that wandered off, but Sparky is still missing."
Dean was standing in the hot sun, pulling weeds when he heard a whiffling sound. He saw movement in the brush. He picked up his hedge trimmers to brandish it when a black and white pig broke out of the brush. It snorted at Dean and then stuck its snout in the dirt sniffling and pawing. The pig was large and stood about to Dean’s mid-thigh.
“You could never intrude, Cas. My dad is just one noisy son of a bitch.” Dean strode over to the fence. “Can I kiss you, Cas?”
"Thanks for sharing that, Jody. My dad hasn't mentioned Henry since he told me and Sam that he had died. We learned the hard way not to ask."
