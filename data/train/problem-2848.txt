He leaned in slowly, deliberately invading Cas’ personal space.   Absently, Dean noted the previously steady sound of clacking keys falter and knew Sam was watching.  No matter.  If his theory were correct, Sam would know soon enough.
“I’m not going anywhere, gorgeous.  I promise.”
Pulling off just long enough to take a hasty lungful of air, Cas swallowed as deeply as he could, taking Dean’s cock down his throat until his nose brushed against the alpha’s pelvis.  And then Dean was snarling, his hands locked on Cas head as he unloaded a flood of hot come down his throat.
“When Michael was riding me, the first time, I mean,” Dean began.   “When I finally fessed up, admitted what I remembered…”
Then their had father walked in.  He eyes his eldest son in thinly veiled warning.  “Never you mind that, son,” he’d told Sam.  “Just let Dean go get cleaned up and we can forget all about this unpleasant situation.”
It was quiet, but not uncomfortably so.  Dean had walked the woods within miles of the cabin countless times.  After a while, he sensed he was being watched, but nothing that sent up his instinctive warning flags.  Only one thing he knew of did that.
“Yeah, it takes a lot more than one good lay to knock out a rut,” Dean agreed lazily.  “We’ll get to round two soon enough.”
When he finally felt it was safe to open his eyes, his bleary vision was filled with green.  Which was confusing, all things considered.  After a few blinks to clear the residual haze, he was able to take in the rest of what he was observing; the very familiar face to which that particular shade of green exclusively belonged to.
Initially, Castiel had parted ways with Sam Winchester with more than a few misgivings.  In his experience, walking alone into the heart of a pack would not go well.  He’d spent the short walk trying to work out how to efficiently state his case before he was impaled.  As it happened, he’d worried needlessly.
Dean awkwardly scratched at his arms, the behaviour making Sam nervous.  Something wasn’t right with his brother.  Dean shivered, arms tightening around his chest.  He looked flush.
Cas looked at the three of them, not bothering to hide his outright suspicion.
Dean looked the chained omega over.  He was tallish for his kind; lean, with dark black hair, a pretty face, and the bluest eyes Dean had ever seen.  Eyes that currently radiated disdain as he coolly took in the eager audience.  Ballsy for someone that had dozens of nearly feral alphas drooling for his ass.
“Do you need a hand?” A voice asked kindly from behind him.  A middle age human female smiled politely.  She wore a deep blue oversized sweater with a cat drinking coffee on it; a badge pinned to her shirt identified her as an employee of the library.
Sam groaned, dropped his head in his hands.  “I’ve never heard of an omega initiating a mating bite on an alpha.  Not only that, his Alpha.   Only you, Cas.  What are we going to do with this mess?”
It had taken only a few minutes in Dean’s company after his suspiciously easy escape from Michael for it to became apparent to Cas that Dean didn’t realize that his desperate pleas for help had been strong enough to connect with the Angel.
Dean bit out a loud curse, taking the end of the chain from the beta female.  Well, fuck.  Either he gave Crowley the ass kicking he so richly deserved, or he accepted the bribe instead and took the powder.  Crowley was too damn smart for his own good.  Sometimes being the responsible leader sucked.
“Hey Benny.  Are you alright?”
He reached between his legs, gathering a good amount of his own slick in his palm and coating his cock with the stuff.  He pressed the tip to Dean’s rim, pausing just long enough so that the alpha knew what Castiel intended and giving him time to decide if he willing.
Castiel wanted to give in. More than anything in his life he wanted to submit, cry uncle, and end his torment.  But then he’d lose.  And winning was everything at this point.  Because if he gave in he’d lose the bet.  Lose the right to reverse their positions and rope Dean’s sexy, sadistic ass to the fucking mattress to do with as he pleased.  And Cas had time to come up with all kinds of ideas over the last few hours.
Dean stretched out; taking stock of the minor aches left over from their activity.  Nothing major.  A hot shower and he’d be good to go.
Ellen grinned faintly.  They weren’t wrong.
Cas knew right then that it was over; his failure inevitable.  He’d eventually succumb, sooner rather than later, and offer anything, everything if he could only be allowed orgasm.  It was just a matter of time.  With the realization came a rush of relief, that there was a glorious end in sight.  But not quite yet. Cas may have accepted he was going to lose this battle, but he was damned well going to make Dean work for it.
Sam blinked in surprise.  “That’s a terrible idea.  It’s miserable and not healthy for your body at all.   Why don’t I help you find a good partner, instead?”
An even greater surprise was the alphas willingness to accede to most any of Cas sexual requests, readily allowing the omega to hold him down and take what he wanted.
“Jerk.”
Dean never talked about prior experience with male partners, though Castiel was aware he wasn’t Dean’s first.   He didn’t understand the hesitation; shy or reticent wasn’t really a part of Dean’s personality.  And the hunter had been well versed in sucking cock long before the first time he'd gone to his knees in front Cas, shoved his coat aside and taught the angel the true definition of pleasure.
“Fuck, Cas! Warn a guy, will ya?”
Without warning, the grass gave way to a massive open area, dotted with small houses in no particular pattern.  The plateau gave way to hills that disappeared in the distance, leading to a boulder spotted area to the south side, and a dark forest line to the north.
Dean had to close his eyes to focus on controlling his reactions and keeping his teeth out of the way.  He wasn’t sure if Cas would be into that, and it was something best discovered later, in a much more relaxed situation and hopefully in an environment that involved four walls and a bed.  He slid one hand off the Impala and snaked it between his own legs, unzipping his pants and taking a firm hold on his straining cock through his underwear.
“Sam Winchester?  What in the right hell have they been feeding you?”
“Yes.  If you’ll have me,” Castiel replied.  He stiffened, hoping the Alpha didn’t take that as an invitation.  Omegas had been claimed for less.  “I know I’m not exactly a normal omega.”
He decided on a shave, wanting to clean things up as much as he could.  Sam would be back any time and, while Dean’s brother was well accustomed to seeing him sloppy and out of control for any number of reasons, he wanted to at least appear like he had a handle on things.
Castiel slid up so he was sitting on Dean’s thighs, taking a moment to enjoy the scenery.  He’d seen Dean’s bare chest so often he could draw it from memory.  But the whole full frontal image was new.
“Don't do it!” Using both hands, Sam managed to lock his brother’s arm in place, the younger Alpha’s biceps bulging with the effort of keeping Dean from slicing the unconscious man's jugular.
As far as places to live, this was one of the best he’d found, thus far anyway.  Castiel hadn’t met many locals, but the few he’d met had given him plenty to think about.
Ellen chuckled.  The whole area seemed so damn...healthy.  No hollow eyes, no fear.  Folk eyed her curiously, sure, but trusted their Alphas in letting her in.
“Here’s the thing,” Dean began.  “The woods give us what we need, though we try and not milk it too heavily.  But we don’t have much in the way of trade.  A lot of what we got comes from pit fighting in the border towns.”
Dean nodded.  As he turned to walk away, John grabbed his arm one more time.  “Be honest with me.  Are you hurt, son?  Do I need to take you to a doctor?”
Straight up smut.  Originally meant to be lighthearted but Dean wouldn't allow it, the damn Broody McBrooderson.  So now it's angsty smut.
Castiel lunged forward, grabbing the Hunter by his shirt and hauling him forward while walking backwards until Cas was backed up to the wall again, Dean’s chest slamming into his with the force of Cas’ pull.
I actually have three terribly long chapters just chockabock full of typos completely written out, including the ending.  Unfortunately they don't follow any kind of linear structure, so that needs to happen first.
“Yeah, sure.  But I’ve been on the road all my life; sometimes I just need to get out.  Relive the glory years, ya know?” Dean said, pulling out one of his guns for a cleaning.
Dean looked up, and up, and up, gazing into the other man’s hairy nostrils.  Magog was a fucking giant, a mammoth of a man, his hairy chest slabbed with muscle.  He dwarfed Dean’s 6’2 height by at least a foot and a half, probably more.
“I’ve been taking hormonal suppressants.  For a long time.  That’s how I’ve been keeping my dual nature in check.”
Castiel disagreed.  He still felt like he was burning up, his dick already throbbing with hints of renewed life.  Dean must have read something of Cas’ thoughts in his expression, because he chuckled, the ass.
Forty five minutes later two bottles lay abandoned in a discarded heap on the ground, both very recently emptied of the Winchester’s headiest moonshine.  A third was perilously close to joining them.
He crouched down so that they were eye to eye. “I have to go have a talk with your brother, Sammy.  It’s really important that you stay inside until we get back.  Okay?”
“Cas, we got through it.  You eventually healed Sam, better than new, and you did your best to help us deal with the Leviathons.  We couldn’t have ganked Dick Roman without you.  Far as I’m concerned, we’re good.”
“Yes.  I wish to do research on this device.   I’m not sure how to instruct it to give me the information I need.”
“Whatever you say, darlin’.”
A small smile graced Cas’ lips as the tension left his shoulders.  Whatever was about to happen, he and Dean were okay.  That was all that really mattered.
“I’m aware you’re still with another omega,” the petite brunette was saying.  “It’s fine.  Just, my heat will come up in a few weeks and I was hoping you’d pair with me again.  This guy you’re with will be long done by then, and if you remember, it went so well last time.”
More than any of that, it wasn’t fair to Dean.  The alpha didn’t want this, didn’t want Castiel that way.  He was still a young male, with a world full of options before him.  They’d never discussed relationships, or Lady Moon help him, a family or pups.
Dean scowled at his brother, reluctantly nodding in agreement.  “Yeah, yeah.  I know.”
The first time Sam had seen this type of mark since waking up crazy, he’d had his suspicions, but no facts to back it up.  The second time he’d noticed, he’d made a point of watch his brother; noting odd moments or behaviors suggesting he was newly injured for no reasons that Sam knew of.
Castiel was just shedding the heavy beekeeper gear following a check on the newest hive when he heard the warning whistles.
------------------------
Things happened, as they do. Michael reacquired Dean; Sam and Castiel captured Michael (sort-of); and together they broke Dean free from the terrible burden of living out his best life in his Happy Place.
As promised, Dean had taken his time with him, making sure Cas’ body was well ready for intrusion before so, so slowly thrusting inside him.  He’d taken him spoon style, the position allowing Dean to thrust deeply into Cas’ body while simultaneously allowing access for a talented hand to stroke and tease his cock.  It was sensual, intimate, and Cas had relished being cared for so beautifully.  The dual sensations from front and behind had proven more than Cas could handle and he’d orgasmed far sooner than he’d have liked.  He considered round two, but the dull ache in his previously virgin ass suggested it would be prudent for him to wait on that.
It required quite a few folk to adequately man a supply run, not to mention the several spares that wrangled a place in the caravan for the sheer thrill of it.  All told, twenty of his people were out in the world, far away from the safety of Winchester territory.
Cas felt Dean crawl up his body, yelping when teeth nipped at his inner thigh, light suction as yet another hickey marked his body.  Dean continued to crawl until his muscular thighs clenched around Cas’ bound hips.
Without conscious thought, Castiel leaned forward, his nose tickling the skin of Dean’s wrist as he inhaled deeply.  He moaned slightly.  He’d never smelled anything so enticing before.  Without conscious thought, his tongue snuck out, licking delicately at the smooth skin.
“Here we go.  For weapons, I choose whiskey.  First to fall unconscious looses.  Winner decides if he wants to give the unconscious one a throat-length smile.”
Ellen smiled, reaching out to take one of Castiel’s hands, gently scenting marking him as pack.  “Hi, yourself.”
Deciding he needed something, anything else to do, Sam left the other two to play voyeur and went to the passenger side of the truck to check his supplies.  Opening the cooler, he checked on the half dozen bags of ‘O’ neg blood nestled securely under a thick bed of ice, a number of rosaries bobbing around in the icy water.  Next to the cooler, a Trader Joe’s bag held several dozen syringes and a set of the dungeon’s super-spelled cuffs.   Sam pulled out the cuffs and returned to the tailgate.
Although at the moment, Rowena seemed perfectly content to recline on the old truck bed next to him, her amused expression occasionaly flitting over to the fixated trench coat clad figure of Castiel.
Sam glanced at his brother.  “It was Magog.  And he’s dead, now.”
“I know that,” Cas replied hesitantly.  “But it wasn’t as if I really gave you an option.  Not with Sam in a forced sleep and my enhanced powers…”
In the face of such intense focus, Cas automatically took a step pack.  Dean took a step forward.  Feeling oddly hunted, Cas backed away again, jerking when he found himself backed into a wall.
Dean collapsed heavily onto Cas chest, a new wetness at their locked hips telling Cas it was okay to stand down, his partner was as well-satisfied as he.
Cas filled a second mug with coffee, snagged a blanket, and stepped out into the chilly morning air.  He silently handed the alpha the steaming cup and took a seat on the stairs next to him.  Dean accepted the coffee with a nod of thanks.
Dean leisurely stretched, reaching into a back pocket for his phone.  “Well, if you don’t believe me, I’ll just have to prove it.” Three eager sets of eyes gazed down at him adoringly.  Too easy.
This wasn’t exactly a new thing.  He’d seen these exact marks plenty of times before when his brother had punched a wall, for any number of reasons.  But when Dean was well and truly pissed, plain old drywall didn’t stand a chance; he always punched clean through.  This was more a skid, like he’d pulled the punch.
Dismissing all thoughts of Sam, Dean continued purposefully striding through the hall.  His Alpha would be near to losing it, and Dean needed to be ready.   The game was just starting to get good.
A blink later and Dean was back into place, his newly bare legs tight against Cas’ hips.  Cas wasn’t sure what Dean had in mind for them, but as the more experienced partner, it made sense for him to take the lead.
The motorcycles rumbled to life, each bike manned by a driver and an armed rear guard.  The bikes rolled out, interposing themselves alongside and in between the caravan.
Ellen went very, very still.
On some sane level, Cas was aware that Dean was planning damage control, and that he’d sent the other omega firmly away.  But none of that made it through the fog of sudden, overwhelmingly possessive rage.
Dismissing Crowley for the moment, Dean turned to eye his opponent.  “Weapons?” He asked, stretching his arms and giving knuckles a good crack.
“Yeah, just out for a walk.  Gotta stretch my legs.”
Dean raised an eyebrow at that.  Fang? Now that was an interesting development.  His inner alpha rose eagerly at the thought of a worthy fighter, craving blood under his fists.  Fang was a bunch of feral beasts, the lot of ‘em.  Just like him.
“Right.”
“Sorry? That’s all you have to say?  What in the hell were you thinking?”
He stood, silent and invisible in the bathroom while Dean took his sweet time under the steamy water.  How long did it really take one human to get clean?  It wasn’t as if the man was fresh from a hunt; he had no dried blood or caked dirt that needed to be so meticulously scrubbed away.
“Yes,” Cas replied.  “I have regained full control of my vessel.”
Not that he wouldn’t enjoy some slow build and romancing.  Later.  Somewhere way down the line when his heat was sufficiently sated.  He had a feeling Dean would be an attentive, adoring mate as well as the raging sex monster he was currently channeling.  It would make for an interesting future.
Castiel’s eyebrows rose at that blatantly incorrect assessment.  Before he could give voice to his indignation, Dean had straddled his lap and was easing his well-loosened asshole gently down onto Castiel’s cock, rocking down until he rested entirely on the Angel’s lap.
She mentioned it to Sam as they left the house.  He smiled at her, readily agreeing to all her requests as if it was already a done deal.  Perhaps it was; her people were his now.
This was exactly why he’d always been so careful to meet Dean anywhere but in his home.  His omega was sitting up at attention, just waiting for a chance to pounce or be pounced.  Dean had this lazy sexiness about him; calm and so casually Dominant that Cas nearly missed it when he wasn’t paying close attention.
Castiel froze, now three fingers deep, going completely still.  That particular word was rarely spoken between them.  It meant something.  “Please stop, or please more, Dean?  Decide.”
“You don’t have a picture of your intended, by any chance.  Not to be nosy or anything, but I totally am.”
Before Castiel could inform her that he had no home, she all but ran the other direction.
By the time Dean had gotten out and walked to the other side of the car, Castiel had already emerged and was standing by the door, shifting uncomfortably, a familiar deer-in-the-headlights look on his face.
Dean shifted on his log.  “Here’s the deal. You tell us everything you know, to the last detail, on that hooch.  And we’ll bring your pack in.  But not as Harvelles.  We can’t afford the infighting.  If we take them, they join us.  One pack.”
He scrounged up half a dozen phones and set up shop on a beat up old desk in the corner of the cabin, hemmed in by dozens of boxes of photocopied old books.  They didn’t carry the same weight as the ancient tomes he’d spent half a life collecting, but it did no good to dwell on what he didn’t have.  He’d make do with what he did.
“How generous.”
Castiel nodded.  “Yes.  They are fierce fighters.  Raised from birth to handle a blade.  Years of selective breeding made them faster, stronger than most people.  I’ve watched you fight, Dean.  You’re one of the finest warriors I’ve ever seen.  You may even be able to take down a single Halo soldier one on one if you got very lucky.  But the upper echelon, Dean they’re barely human.”
Dean’s eyes flicked opened.  His body stiffened, head cocked to he side as he listened, gazing towards the front door warily.
Fuck, it was even firmer than he’d imagined.  The skin was silk against his fingertips, and Cas couldn’t help but knead at the firm flesh, digging into the taut gluteals.  He was probably leaving bruises, but Dean only purred harder.
Dean continued his story smoothly, a satisfied gleam in his eyes.  “Once I was sure I had his undivided attention, I swallowed him whole, straight to the root, no warning.  The way he groaned, giving it all up for me, there’s nothing quite like that moment.  When you have complete control in how you want to make them feel, how much you choose to give, their orgasm is in your hands.  And ladies, there’s a reason they call it the ‘little death.”
She laughed throatily, pulling away from his mouth, settling back over his hips.  Purple hair slid a hand along his balls to his shaft, taking the base in a firm grip.  She held him steady while Brunette sank down on his length, her pert bottom landing on his hips, wriggling a bit while she found her balance. She paused a minute, eyes closed as she adjusted, and began to bounce.
Castiel huddled in a quiet spot along the log ring that circled the small fire, grateful for the warmth provided by the sparking flames.  The faint hiss and pop of damp wood amidst the burning branches provided a soothing background to the night.  The sun had bid its evening farewell some time ago, taking the day’s scorching heat with it and leaving a dry, icy chill in its wake.
And as long as Dean didn’t actually say ‘no,’ he’d never have to find out whether or not Castiel would honor it.
Dean swore.  He reached forward and grabbed Castiel by his coat, hauling the Angel close so he could stare down into his eyes.  The storm green of Dean's eyes was so bright they appeared to glow, echoing his rage. Castiel blinked, convinced for a moment that they actually did.  Which shouldn't be a complete surprise.  Technically, Dean was an Archangel at the moment.
So saying, he briefly rolled off Cas, just long enough to shuck the rest of his clothing.  Cas decided to be a good soldier and follow orders, for now anyway.  It was unlikely to last.  He’d never been particularly good at that, it was unlikely he’d start now that he was human.
“A pic is worth a thousand words, right?”
He glanced up at Cas, mischief in his green gaze, well aware of the picture he was presenting.  On his knees, bare to the waist, his lips pink and shining with saliva, face flushed; if the angel was half the voyeur Dean suspected, he’d be entranced.
Dean’s response was to grind his pelvis against Cas’ trapped groin, the friction a delicious torment against his cock.  The motion cast sharp relief on the fact that he was painfully hard.
“Let him be,” Sam cautioned, taking a hold on Cas’ shoulder.  “Dean isn’t himself right now.  Just give him some time.”
Once he was certain that Castiel would stay put, Dean raised his arms over his head, pulling both his top layer and undershirt off in one graceful maneuver.  His bare skin was slightly pale, the warm flesh gleaming in the soft room light.  Dean was muscular in the most perfect of ways, the gentle curve of his neatly stacked rows of abdominal muscles giving way to a trim waist.   Two pert, brown nipples tipped a perfectly framed set of pecs, the peaks begging to be licked.  Cas eyes danced across Dean's anatomy, at a loss as to where he wanted to look the most.
More importantly, Dean was his.
Since seeing Dean spin and flee from him back in their bedroom, all Castiel could think about that lovely ass.  He wanted to taste it.
Dean muttered darkly to himself and reached for the covered plate of pie.  Satisfied that they’d gone through their first understanding as a mated pair, Castiel followed Sam out the door.
Soot-filled clouds of smoke danced around the barren ground, a grisly accent to the charred corpses of vehicles, the crates, and well, corpses.  A dry wind blew through, filling the air with cloying ashes.
Cas licked his lips.  “Alright.  Can…am I allowed to touch?”
“You don’t say,” the brunette at his side said breathlessly.
Castiel reached over, unlocking the cuff around his left wrist.  Dean caught his arm, their eyes meeting.  Cas paused, allowing his omega to reattach the cuff to his right wrist.  Together they did the same with his left.  Now Cas’ hands were free, but he still wore a set of cuffs on either wrist.  It should be enough to keep the bulk of his otherworldly strength in check.  Probably.
“Oh, darling.  Four wonderful collegiate years worth.  I may have gotten a degree in PolySci, but between you and me, I majored in Sluttery.”
“We have plenty of jobs around here.  You don’t have to hunt or fight if that’s not your thing,” Charlie had told him in her sweet way.  But then she’d added, “But you will damn well know how.”  She didn’t need to tell Castiel twice.  The omega was totally on board.
Dean obediently stopped writhing, whimpering at the teasing sensation.
“It’s not an issue; Dean has no mating gland.” His gaze had turned back to Sam so he didn’t notice the warning glare Dean shot his way until too late.
It wasn’t exactly the answer Cas was hoping for, and it hurt to think he was just another packmate getting the care he needed from his Alpha.  But he had asked.  At least Dean was courteous enough to give him an honest answer.
Cas glanced coolly at his mate, daring the Alpha to try and tell him he wasn’t allowed to walk out the door with Sam.  Exceptions could be made when heat and hormones were in the air, but this was different.  This was about setting a precedent.
Cas blinked.  Earlier that morning, they’d both decided that Castiel was well past the worst of it and it was safe to remove his restraints.  Without the cuffs, he had full access to his tattered grace.  He couldn’t do much, but delving was simple enough.  He turned his gaze inward, seeking to find what Dean was speaking of.
Dean poured him a glass of beer from one of the heavy growlers, raising an eyebrow at the double helping of food Cas was putting down.
Sam stood up, sliding his bag over his shoulder and turned toward the door, swearing to himself when he noticed.  There it was again.  A fist-shaped dent in the wall, right about at his shoulder level.  If it hadn’t been tinged faintly with blood, Sam would most likely never have noticed.
“I have no interest in alcoholic beverages,” Cas stated, deadpan as always.
“Consider it done.  Did we at least get something good out of that damn pit battle?  Since we’re down our meanest fighter?”
----------
“Cas.”  Dean’s voiced brought the Angel back out from his jumbled, confused pile of musings.
“That’s more like it,” he muttered, his purr so vibrant Cas’ cock pulsed in appreciation.  This was good; this was everything he needed.  His omega was hot and perfect, taking him so well, rumbling in satisfaction as his needs were met and matched by Castiel's own.
“I’ve been telling you that for years.”
Dean had no response to that, so he drank his beer and walked.
Cas snorted wetly; when had he started crying?  “I’ll make your life miserable,” he muttered.
Dean chuckled.  “Yeah, okay.  Catch you next time I’m feeling dirty, Cas.”
“Come on out, angel.  I know you’re there.”
---------------------------------------
“Because you weren’t hiding that limp nearly as well as you thought you were, and I smell fresh blood on you,” Sam replied frankly.
Castiel took several slow deep breaths, blowing his exhales out through his nose like an agitated horse.  A few moments later he stilled, sagging in his chair.  The calm didn't last.  Not even a minute later, his upper body stiffened and he turned his head focus on Dean.  The Angel's gaze sharpened, focusing with a disturbing intensity as he stared fixedly at the Hunter.
His enthusiastic new friend was plenty willing to get bent over the hood of the sleek muscle car and be taken hard.  A little intense necking to get the ol’ juices flowing and wham-bam-thank-you-man, they were done.  A quick kiss to seal the deal, and the man left; slightly dazed, with a dopey smile on his face.
Eyes downcast, Dean shook his head.  “No, sir.”
But he would not; he was a former angel, damnit.  Nearly a god, at least once, maybe twice.  He would never submit, never give in, no matter how he was made to suffer.
For a moment Cas swore he could hear the echo of heavy wood slamming against metal.  Bang.  Bang.  Bang.
Castiel buried the Alpha’s voice deep inside until it went dormant, ruthlessly reclaiming absolute control of his vessel.  Angels didn’t have dual natures.
Cas sighed, peering into the dark swirl of rich coffee.  There was Benny, of course.  They buried their initial issues with each other years ago and while they would never be the best friends, they had an easy camaraderie and had indulged in some very high quality sex.
Sam looked over the crowd.  “Thank you for the support.  It means a lot.  But we are both very young.  Too young, really, to be running such a large, quickly growing pack.  We’re doing the best we can.”  Strong murmurs of encouragement answered his statement.
Dean shifted, the hay poking him through the thin fabric of his black tee shirt.  It was mildly annoying.  He considered taking his little party elsewhere, but climbing down and wrangling his little harem into the car really seemed like a lot of work.  And he was pretty comfortable where was, hay prickles notwithstanding.
“Thanks, Cas,” she said absently as he handed her a fresh clip.
Dean grinned back.  “You ever heard the phrase ‘to the victor goes the spoils,’ Sammy?  Well, as of this afternoon I’m the victor.  And that, right down there, that is the spoils.”
Sam dropped the binoculars into his lap.  “Castiel,” he called out.  “Do me a favor and burn my eyes out of my skull?”  Rowena laughed.
Turning to the crowd, Crowley raised his arms for silence.  “I’d say we have a worthy challenger for the legendary Dean Winchester, eh lads?” He roared into the anticipatory silence.
Dean sighed.  He didn’t sound angry any more, just tired.  “Yeah Cas, I know you are.  Me too.”
Sam sat back at his computer.  He knew he should be working on locating Rowena, but he discovered his fingers had typed ‘secondary nature- omega’ into the search bar.  For all that he’d lived with Dean the vast majority of his life, he still knew very little about duals.  No amount of prompting had ever gotten Dean to open up about it.  Sam closed his eyes, searching his memories for what he remembered from their past.
Purple hair, clearly the most adventurous of the trio, if not the more experienced, slowly unzipped his jeans, pulling his erection into the warm summer air.  Dean smiled encouragingly.  To his left, Brunette moaned as his fingers slid past the soft, wet flesh into her body, thrusting gently.  Not much, just a touch.  He wanted to see how far he could push her.
“Well, since we’ve settled our minor differences, I’ve been empowered to negotiate a deal.  Clever of your brother, by the way.  I can honestly say that was a first for us.  The lads will be talking about it for eons.”
The betting was a different story entirely.  It was incredibly well organized, scrupulously maintained, and violently regulated.  The last group to run it had been notoriously shady.  No one mourned when a new crew rolled into town to take their place.  These new guys, Crowley’s pack, ran the bets now.  Pieces of his predecessor were strung about the ring, the cracked skull and occasional femur serving as grisly decorative reminders of how he handled cheaters.  Or anyone foolish enough to bet beyond their means.
Castiel had disappeared immediately after they returned, but after their Halo guests left, Sam had tracked him to Meg’s home.  Satisfied that the omega was in good hands with his friend, Sam went home to keep an eye out for his brother.  That had been the day before yesterday.
It was probably the third day or so when Castiel no longer opened his eyes craving cock. And he managed to go a solid two hours without an erection.  Interesting.  He’d gotten through the worst of it faster than usual.
Dean shrugged, blowing off Sam’s concern.
Dean placed his hands on Cas’ shoulders for support, grinning.  “Hold on tight,” he warned, and then he moved.
Dean glanced back at the tent behind him at the faint sound of rustling fabric.  Sam rose to his feet, a sawed off shotgun in his grip.  Dean raised a hand, signaling his brother to stand down.
For the life of her she couldn’t tell.  By right, it should be Dean as the oldest and toughest.  Sam was clearly a fighter, but even he couldn’t withstand an alpha Hunter’s Rages.
Dean clearly cared very, very much.  He buried his face into Cas’ ass with gusto, licking him like he was Dean’s favorite flavor of ice cream.  The deep rumbles of pleasure suggested he was enjoying this every bit as much as Castiel.  A swipe across his hole with the flat of Dean’s tongue and the omega gave up on thinking and gave into sensation.
Castiel dug his heels in, resisting being pulled away.  “Sam, this isn’t right.”
Jody appeared at Castiel’s side a short while later, as red-eyed as the others but wearing a sleepy smile.  She pressed a bar of grain and dried fruit bits that smelled strongly of honey into his hand, along with a tin cup of what his nose told him was extremely strong coffee.
He steadfastly ignored the tantalizing waft of Castiel’s scent curling around him as he walked brusquely away.
But still.  Had Castiel been paying attention he’d have noticed that the Alpha had attained injuries; and by his very nature the man would be compelled to hide any damage attained during the fight.  Jo had been right.  Would it really have killed him to carry the stupid box?
“You get to change your mind, you know,” Dean reminded him, eyes intent.  His hands left Cas’ face as he began to pull at clothes, tugging off Cas’ shirt, carelessly snapping the buttons.  “That’s always up to you, no matter what we’re doing.”
Dean rose up on his forearms, gazing behind him with a cocky grin.  Cas didn’t wait, didn’t play.  He yanked Dean’s hips up and slammed his cock hard into his ass, burying himself to the root.  Dean groaned, falling flat onto his chest.  Cas didn’t hesitate a moment; laying into him, with fierce, rapid thrusts, abandoning any pretext of subtlety or teasing.
And that had been that.  For another two years.  Until Dean had again inexplicitly disappeared for another three days.  And again he’d returned, a disheveled, bruised mess.  Sam still clearly remembered Dean and their father arguing outside hotel their room.
Castiel cursed under his breath.   He’d been caught.  Not that it had been all that difficult.  Now that he thought to check, he couldn’t help but notice he was radiating omega pheromones.  His body practically screamed ‘breed me, now!’
So he took Sally from the cheerleading squad to the movies that night.  And she was perfect.  And then there was Jenni, and Trish.
Fortunately, his body language worked as he’d hoped, calming his mate’s protective rage.  He felt Dean’s muscles relaxing as his body came down from attack mode.  He glanced over his shoulder; relieved to see the red haze had bled away and Dean’s eyes were back to their usual green hue.
Dean glanced up, seeing the girl’s coy expression looking back at him.
“Let’s go,” he told the as yet unnamed omega shortly, turning and walking in the direction of the Winchester encampment.  His shoulder screamed at him from carrying the crate, but he’d be damned if he asked the rude bastard at his side for any favors.
Night had fallen and neither man showed any interest in rising to turn on lights.  The two men were lying next to each other, both naked and comfortable sharing each other space.
“Okay, okay.  Hold on, Mr. Bossy,” Dean muttered.  He sat up on his knees and positioned his cock, Cas’ legs still propped over his shoulders.
He sucked in a breath, taking in the full picture of a beautiful man kneeling between his legs doing his utmost to suck him dry.  Cas had picked up that particular trick from Dean, though that new thing he was doing with his tongue…Dean groaned, yeah, that move was all Cas.  How the hell had he managed to press his tongue at the underside of Dean’s cock and lick upward without sacrificing an ounce of that perfect suction?
“You two,” Sebastian said with a dreamy sigh.  “Colour me jealous.”  He cocked his head.
He’d never, ever, wanted to hurt his friend and occasional lover, but as Cas was only now understanding, there wasn’t really anything Dean could have done to prevent it.  It’s not like Dean would have had the opportunity to cut himself and fashion a Banishment sigil in this situation.
“You know,” Dean said aloud, apparently to the towel.  He spoke in a normal volume, nowhere near loud enough to reach his brother far on the other half of the hotel by the door.
Castiel seriously considered kissing her.
--------------------
Ellen rocked back on her heels, attempting to make sense of the news.  “But Isaac and Tamera were stationed there.  They’d never abandon their post.”
Which led him to his current predicament.  He’d feared that being human would make the experience so much worse.  Emotion, sensation, it made everything different, more intense.  Castiel gritted his teeth, wondering how humans survived this level of suffering at all, much less his adopted family who’d been tortured so many times they could write a book.  Maybe they should, the Winchester Guide to Torture Moste Foul.  He probably shouldn’t mention the idea to Dean; the hunter still seemed to harbor a fair amount of guilt about that chapter in his own history.
“I heard you,” he agreed reluctantly.  “Every time you called out to me, I heard.  But I couldn’t find you.  I couldn’t help.”
“Right back,” Dean told him, leaning in to steal a quick kiss.
Dean came back to full consciousness gradually, aware he was lying on cold, uncomfortable concrete.  His throat hurt and he needed a drink badly.  He was also more relaxed then he could remember being in what felt like forever.  If there’d ever been a time he’d come that hard before, Dean couldn’t remember it.  And he’d definitely never passed out before.
“Dean,” Cas voice brought him out of his musings.  “I want you to roll over onto your stomach.”  The order in his tone brooked no discussion.  Apparently foreplay time was over.
That last thought bolstered him, and he didn’t resist when Dean got ahold of his wrists and pinned them above his head, swinging one denim-clad leg over Cas’ body so he knelt astride.  The position, Cas decided, was perfectly fine, but the pants had to go.
Castiel leaned over the railing, taking in the action around him.  Whatever this was, it wasn’t an open attack.  The gathering team was wary, but the activity wasn’t consistent with battle.  They were in meet-n-greet mode.
Even if that Alpha was incredibly handsome, his silky skin and taut muscle perfectly accentuated by the play of light and shadow as he carefully stripped out of the last of his wet clothes with one arm.  Then his pants were gone and Dean was standing casually naked as he set out his soaked pants to dry.
Dean finally stopped looking anywhere but at Sam.  His eyes were over bright, the green so emerald it practically glowed.  Emotions flittered across his nearly too fast to identify.  Despair, rage, need, and finally relief.
Dean stepped up until there was only a few inches of air between them and rested his hands firmly on Cas’ hips.  The angel swallowed.
Now that Sam thought about it, Dean had never, not even once, pulled a three-day disappearing act since hijacking him from college.  He’d had plenty of sex, of course, the dude was an unabashed man-whore, but it had all been normal, one night stand stuff.
Dean flipped the knife in his palm, eyes intent on his opponent.  He assumed a fighter’s crouch.  Waiting.
“Can you hear what they’re saying?”
This was a terrible idea.  Maybe Castiel should fall back on plan B.  No, he’d already decided.  He was going to follow through.
They rode for half a day before the trucks came to a halt in an old lot that appeared to have once held some kind of market.  The skeletons of old stalls dotted the area, while faded signs advertised the cost of various offerings.
Cas, for all that he’d proven multiple times to have absolute control over his vessel, came surprisingly quickly.  He pulled out a moment later, then was standing at the bedside next to Dean’s head, fully dressed once more.
It wasn’t that Castiel didn’t believe Jo; he actually did.  Nonetheless, he had no intention of sleeping, not in a camp full of unknowns.  Still, he was extremely exhausted, and it had been some time since he’d had a restful night sleep.  Or perhaps it was as simple as his subconscious recognizing something he didn’t.  That he was safe.
“One hell of a bender,” Sam commented, taking a seat on the steps next to his sibling.  And, just to be a bitch, “Want a drink?  A little hair of the dog?”
“Me likee,” Brunette said, eyeing the screen.
“Yes, Cas,” Dean replied, clearly annoyed.  “Given that one of us is chained to a wall, I could easily have gotten away if I'd wanted to.”  Cas turned his head away, closing his eyes.  Dean wouldn’t have left, even if he didn’t want something, not when Cas’ health was at risk.
A particular birdcall sounded, carried over from person to person as the pack scattered to their assigned locations.  Castiel dropped his gear and bolted for the weapons house.
Rage.  More pain then he could remember feeling since he’d held Sammy cold and near death in his arms, it felt like watching his house burn with his wife inside all over again.  His son had been hurt doing something terrible because John hadn’t been there.
Getting Cas’ top half completely naked just wasn’t in the cards without removing the handcuffs, and Dean had no intention of making that mistake.  Castiel may appear outwardly calm and patient, but believing that was a rookie mistake.  The Alpha was just waiting for an opening to strike.  Instead, Dean left the opened shirt on Castiel's arms, focusing lower.  He unbuttoned the pants waistband, delicately lowering the zipper so that it wouldn't catch sensitive flesh before gripping the material with both hands and sliding down Cas legs, taking the clothing with him.  Cas raised his hips to assist, groaning slightly as his erection was freed, the skin feeling overheated despite the bunker’s cool air.
Actually, it was quite a bit more than a quarter, but norms couldn’t naturally detect when another person had a secondary nature.  And thanks to a whole fuck-ton of bias, most duals chose to stay firmly in the closet.  But there was no hormone or special spray to hide them from each other.  A dual always recognized another dual.
“Dean,” he murmured.  His hands tugged ineffectually against the cuffs.  He wanted to wrap his arms around Dean’s sweaty body, hold him tight, pet and caress.  Instead, he lifted his face, nuzzling gently against Dean’s neck.
================
Sensing eyes on him, Dean turned his head, cracking his lids so he could take in his bedmate.  Unsurprisingly, Cas was staring at him.  He always seemed to be the first one to wake up after a post-coital nap.  And they’d had more than a few of those over the last few days.  What he could remember of those days, anyway.  It had been one hell of a ride.
Castiel woke on the fourth, fifth day? Who knew any more?  Dean lay next to him, lying on his belly, snoring softly.  A healthy length of stubble framed his jaw.  Castiel’s rug burned asscheeks clearly remembered that stubble.
Cas didn’t have to turn to know what Sam was looking at. Or rather, whom.  Every muscle in Castiel’s body had come to attention, aware to his DNA that Dean was behind him. Dean Winchester, his Alpha.  His mate.
Dean nodded.  “Yes, sir.”
Dean's all grown up.  Fresh from the underworld, went to  Hell and back and all he got was this lousy handprint. And things are already complicated.  Sounds about right for a Winchester.
Castiel was an angel.  He had perfect control of his vessel at all times, and had absolute control of when it would orgasm.  Technically, he could continue at this pace for hours, days even, pouring all his grief and rage into the hunter’s willing body.
Dean’s gaze brightened at her warning, a haunting sheen skittering across his retinas.  “Is that a promise?”  He asked eagerly.
Dean’s rumbled growl was enough to make anyone think they suddenly had pressing business anywhere but there.  Sam didn’t seem to care. He held out the knitted arm sling expectantly.
In the many ways Dean imagined this could go, getting thoroughly mouth-fucked had in no way factored into the picture.  Dean consciously loosened his throat, kept his lips tight against Cas cock, and turned control over to his friend.  The hands locked on his head were angel-strong; not much Dean could do but relax and enjoy the ride.  Not that he’d complain even if he could.
If Cas wanted him topless for this, he was likely into visuals.  Dean was self aware enough to know this pose would make the muscles of his shoulders and biceps tighten nicely, with the added benefit of keeping his target in place.
Ellen glowered up at him.  “Dean,” she chided.
No, they were actually glowing, Dean decided.  He was fairly certain that the Angel wasn’t doing it deliberately.  He was just that juiced.
“How about you?” Dean asked, a little too carefully.  “Any weird dreams?”
Dean didn’t follow.
He couldn’t have been more surprised to hear her voice when he’d answered one of his older phones.  A person who chased death with the ferocity of that little lady should have caught up with it by now.
For the first time in his life, he didn’t dread his heats, accepting them as a natural part of who he was.  Mother Moon help him, he was beginning to look forward to it.
“You’d know,” she replied sweetly.
Castiel moved silently along the still hallways, softly opening the door and slinking into Sam’s room, a dark shadow in a trench coat.  Sam’s degree of trust in him was so great that his wary subconscious accepted him in his space and didn’t alert the slumbering hunter of Cas’ presence at his bedside.  It was a humbling gift.
“Dean,” Cas ground out, thrusting up with his hips to meet the other man’s motions.
“Yup.  I figured it would have to be a very patient soul who could handle stubborn, difficult omegas.”
“He’s admiring your artwork,” Dean replied handing him a beer.
“How long until your knot goes down?’ Cas asked, deciding to table that statement for now.
The fine hairs at the back of his neck prickled, his instincts whispering that something dangerous was approaching.  Sam flew too his feet, scanning the wooded area behind his home.  Fucking finally.
“Okay.  So, anything special you had in mind, Cas?”
Gotcha.
“My name is Castiel.”
“No! Not that.  I’m not doing that ever again.  I’m asking you to fuck me.  Energetically.  Arduously.  Pick an adjective.” Cas narrowed his eyes.  “Now would be good.”
Dean had gone completely still above him, panting heavily as he struggled to adjust the abrupt penetration.  The small part of Castiel that could still reason pushed to the fore, easily taking control.  Neither he nor his Alpha side wanted their partner genuinely hurt.
“Anyway, I pulled the waist of his pants down and that thick, meaty cock just sort of sprang free, you know. Right at my face.  Like it knew where it belonged.”
Damnit.  He never had been any good at refusing Castiel.  And he’d missed this more than he’d allowed himself to think about.
Cas wasn’t fixing Sam; he’d made it clear that that particular boat had sailed back when Dean and Bobby had tried to stop him from opening Purgatory.
Even worse, Dean was picking up some things that Castiel didn’t want him to remember.  But as life had taught him, Castiel seldom had a say in such matters.
“Any idea why they’re here?”  Sam asked, though his expression suggested he’d already figured it out.  He was just waiting for confirmation.
Dean scowled.  And that right there was the problem with nulls.  They didn’t have the first clue about how to read a dual’s secondary nature.  All they saw was the outer crap.  Surface characteristics were the least of the signs.
Dean was going to throttle him, no help for it.
“You’re gonna need to clarify that one.”
Cas groaned at the complimentary sensation.  Past experience had taught both men that they enjoyed a healthy bite of pain with their pleasure.   Both enjoyed feeling each other’s strength, no stranger to being held down and taken.
Reaching into her pocket she pulled her flask, offering it to Dean.  Curious, the Alpha sniffed at the drink and took a swig, eyes widening in appreciation.
Seeing Castiel’s blank look, Sebastian sighed and ploughed on.  “The ‘bottom’ is the one who will be taking it up the ass.”
One more thing.  A = pack Alpha,  a = designation of alpha.
Dean shrugged, the move oddly graceful, subtly calling attention to his impressively wide, muscular shoulders.  Not that Dean was sufficiently self-aware to notice.
“More,” he ordered, no trace of doubt, or more worriedly, shame in his face now.  “Don’t stop.”
“Years, Cas.  No, decades.  I’ve been taking hormonal depressants in massive strengths since I first presented at fourteen.  The dose was too high a dose for a kid; too high for an adult really.  And even then, I was taking double.  I think dad would have been okay if I’d been an Alpha.  Maybe.  But we are a Hunter family.  We needed fighters, strength.  Not a weak-ass omega that couldn’t even take care of his younger brother.  Dad helped me get the pills.”
------------------------
Dean walked into the map room.  He leaned heavily against the wall, arms crossed across his chest.  He looked awful.  Sam wasn’t sure what he’d expected from his brother, probably something cocky or sarcastic, but not this.
Slowly he nudged his way back into the world, keeping a line out for any signs the Levis were up to something interesting.  It was while Sam and Dean were out hunting their doppelgangers that interesting finally bit.  But it had nothing to do with Purgatory’s most wanted.
Nope.
--------------------
“Well, Cas.  We set out with a very specific plan.  Way I see it, we have not yet accomplished our goal.”
Was he such a coward that he couldn’t handle being intimate unless he was perpetually capable of slamming his partner through several walls?  Regardless of whatever issues were clouding his mind, he found that his current, most dominant need was to get that distant, cold look out of Dean’s gaze.
Sebastian looked up, appraising Castiel with his gaze.  “Nope.  Not possible.  It’s not safe.  That much beautiful, sexy goodness together? The universe may implode.”
Taking Cas’ elbow, Dean hauled his friend to his feet.  Cas allowed himself to be guided down the hall without complaint.  His resistance was hanging by the barest of threads and he knew it.
A guy had to use some modicum of caution when picking up another dude in a bar.  There was a protocol that had to be observed, for several reasons.  For starters, it was the polite thing to do.  But really, it was about safety.  Not that he personally had anything to worry about; no matter where Dean went, he was always the most dangerous person in the room.  But he didn’t want to blow anyone’s cover, either.  The folk who lived in the town might have no desire to be outed to their friends and neighbors.  Dean had no business making that choice for them.  So he watched for the signs and played by the rules.
“Do not call me ‘Honey’.”
“Fighters…FIGHT!” Crowley roared.
Sam glanced over the table.  “Cas, would you mind helping me run some supplies to my place while my brother stuffs his face?”
“Good for you, Sam.” Ellen replied, smiling up at him.  “I swear I don’t know where Crowley gets the stones.  Offering up human prizes, and an omega at that.  No good could possibly come to an unclaimed omega in that shithole town.  Of course we saved him.  We can always get more supplies.”
That was a good idea.  Castiel reached behind him to grab Dean’s arm, settling his head against a muscular bicep.  Dean chuckled.
Sam took a deep, calming breath.  “Please.”
Dean.
It was a reasonable precaution, Castiel decided.  Without making the conscious decision to do so, he leaned upward, using his abs to lever his body up so he could take a deep sniff of Dean’s chest.  He smelled so good.
Cas wasn’t sure what to say.  He had no idea why what Dean had done to himself felt so devastating to him.  From a warrior’s standpoint, it was an intelligent choice.  But from what he knew from Metatron’s mental dump, that gland was a very special link between mates.  They felt things, knew each other in a deeply emotional, passionate bond.  He couldn’t help but feel Dean had destroyed something precious with that brutally logical decision.
“Dean? Cas? Everyone alive in here?” Sam called, making his way heavily down the metal stairwell.
A dirt bike tore out from a small side path, the helmeted rider pacing them for several minutes before dramatically pulling up into a sustained wheelie.  Landing hard, the dirt biker gunned the engine and flew ahead of the conclave.
“Typically no,” Cas replied, shaking his head.  “The scent of the sunlight is apparently particularly spicy this season.”
Sam blew out a breath.  “Well.  That was fun.” He carefully assessed his surroundings, taking in the Winchester guards, before ending up on Dean.  “You okay over there?”
“Sorry,” Sam replied.  “I couldn’t help it.”
“Please,” Cas said again, not disputing the statement.  Dean knew him, better than anyone ever had.  And still he wanted Cas; still he loved him.  It was so much more than he’d ever hoped for.  He’d call the extra eight inches of alpha cock a bonus.
“Get in line,” Sam replied, old anger in his eyes.  “Anyway, he’s dead and burned.  Years ago.”
“Now,” Cas responded at his most commanding, just to hear Dean laugh.  And also because he really wanted to be fucked.  Fortunately, they weren’t mutually exclusive.
Jo stood, giving his shoulder a gentle punch.  “Good night, then.  It’s okay to sleep.  The big guys are camped out by the main road, so nothing’s gonna make it to us alive from the south.  And we have sentries posted at each corner of the camp.  We wake early and move fast, so try to rest.”
Distantly, he heard the sound of crumbling concrete crashing to the ground.  Guess he should have placed his bet on the wall to give first.  For a few moments he could track his pursuer by the sound of metal clanking against the ground, but then that disappeared and all that remained was silence.
“That is Charlie?” Castiel asked.  Now he understood the joke.
Dean leaned back, the deep green of his eyes nearly glowing as they bored into his.  “You know something about Halos?”
On top of all that delightful slice of pie, Sam had claimed Dean’s place as the rear guard for their caravan, with Jody and Jo riding tandem as front guard.  As if one little injured wing and a few cracked ribs would keep Dean from fighting off anything and everything that could hurt his people.
He glanced up.  Blue eyes gazed down at him, a soft smile gracing Cas lips.  Wow.  That look.  Dean wasn’t quite sure what to make of the angel’s expression.
“Trying to throw me in with the pack will only foster dissonance,” Ellen told them bluntly.  “I get that.  Driving me off won’t work, either.  Not really.  Folk will always know I’m out there somewhere.  It’s okay, I knew how this would go from the start.”
Dean rolled his eyes and waited.
“Feeling better?” Dean asked, grinning slightly.  He knew that he did.  It had been way to damn long since he’d had sex that good.
(See the end of the chapter for
His body vibrating with a deep-chested purr, Dean obliged, adding a sharp nip of teeth, followed by a wide lap against the abused nub.
Castiel keenly remembered the first time Dean’s mind reached for him after Michael stole him away.  He could never forget that moment when Dean’s struggles became so desperate that his screams turned into a Call.
“I’m an angel,” Castiel replied.  Not many of his kind indulged in sex, it was definitely a taboo among their species.  “It’s never been an issue before now.”
Castiel rose, not bothering to dress, because fuck her, and wandered into the hall to watch the interaction.
Sam stood up, sliding his bag over his shoulder and turned toward the door, swearing to himself when he noticed.  There it was again.  A fist-shaped dent in the wall, right about at his shoulder level.  If it hadn’t been tinged faintly with blood, Sam would most likely never have noticed.
---------------------------
Another surprising thing; how casually affectionate the man was.  And the hole Cas was digging for himself just kept getting deeper and deeper.  Dean rose, pulled on the first pair of pants he found, and headed to the front door moments before someone knocked.
“Is there any chance that we might do that again?”  Cas glanced over at him.
“Yes?”
Dean dropped the crate in time to catch the slight blonde that threw herself at him, careful to tug her into a hug with his good arm. “Hey, Jo.  Yes, I fought. Yes, I’m fine. Everything is okay.”  The slim, bright-eyed beta openly scented him, completely unconcerned by her proximity to a blood-high, blood-drenched alpha.
Cas looked Sam in the eye, an unusual ability for an omega, but he’d never been normal.  “I bit Dean without his consent.  And my life should be forfeit.  But it’s done, and my death would only traumatize my mate.  Similarly, leaving would do no good.”  He looked to his mate, seeing the resolution in Dean’s steady gaze.  If Cas left, Dean would follow.  Selfishly, Cas was relieved.  He really didn’t want to leave the Winchester pack.  This was his home.
“I was safe.”
“I can’t fix it,” Castiel replied quietly.  “I don’t have some magic time machine that will let me undo what I’ve done.  If there was anything I could do to make this better I would.”
Dean didn’t look up from his task, but he chuckled, a deep masculine sound of satisfaction.
“I’m sincerely sorry to hear that.”  At her words the soldiers behind her strode forward in perfect unity, drawing weapons.
That made perfect sense.  And explained Dean’s presence.  He’d cut his own hand off before he asked someone for a favor for himself.  But this was about Sam.
“Because you were being tortured and there was nothing I could do about it!  If I couldn’t save you, at least I could be there with you.  I thought maybe, at least I hoped, that you might be able to sense me, too.  Maybe you could feel me and understand that you weren’t alone.  That you just needed to hold on a little longer.”
He turned back into the motel to help the boys pack.  Next town they stopped at he’d find a pool hall and dedicate some time teaching Dean how to work a table.  The boy had a sharp eye and excellent coordination; it wouldn’t take long to teach him some tricks.  Hustling wasn’t ideal, but it would get him by in a pinch.  If Dean was careful and didn’t get greedy, he’d manage fine.
Cas spun around to face her, ripping a few hairs out from his head and handing them over to the witch.  Sam blinked.  That was…surprisingly easy.  Cas must really want to know what the group was saying.
It would hurt less, and maybe remind him why he needed to stay out of the woods alone for a while.
“You sweet talker, you,” Dean replied, even as he moved onto his belly.
---------------------------
“Cas,” Dean growled, reluctantly pushing the other man back.  “We shouldn’t be doing this.”
Sam raised his arms high overhead in a massive stretch.  He’d had a nap, far far away from the bunker’s bedrooms, grabbed some lunch and gone back to Rowena-hunting.  So far he had nada.  The damn witch knew how to hide when she wanted to.  He looked up at the sound of footsteps coming along the hall.
The sounds of a car engine coming up the road had her packing away the flask and standing straight.  That was quick.  She’d expected to be made to wait a while for proprieties sake.
Sam narrowed his eyes and growled right back.  “Chill.  I have no intention of trying to poach and you know it.”
Her parents, as rough and rugged a pair as you’d ever met had started the place, bringing in a few hard cases that had a mind to settle down.  They’d raised Ellen to run it, teaching her all the things a young, tough Alpha needed.  And she’d done a good job of it, too.
“Your brother really is quite spectacular, Samuel,” she told him absently.  “Supreme endurance on the lad. And a lovely set of abs.  Why, that girl has to be at least a hundred and thirty pounds and he’s been pumping up into her like she’s near weightless for a solid fifteen minutes.”
“Do you really think we called ourselves ‘Halo Pack’?”
“It’s remarkable how you’re managing to keep Michael trapped,” Castiel said, after a moment of awkward silence.
“No problem.  Any idea what the alarm is all about?”
He used his remaining hand to work the buttons of Dean’s shirt, choosing to break each one rather than go through the trouble of sliding them through the little eyelet.  He was still so angry.  Ruining Dean’s shirt was the least of his concerns.  The outer shirt open, he slid his hand to Dean’s waist and under the material of his plain white tee, up his chest to rub a thumb against one sensitive nipple.  He willed a spark of angel grace to pulse from his fingertips, the faint blue glowing under the thin material.   Dean jumped as the sharp kiss of Divine electricity shocked his sensitive bud.  Dean always complained that it hurt like a bitch whenever Cas did that, but despite his words it never failed to make him rock-hard in seconds.
Dean grinned, his bright smile a disturbing combination of eager and bloodthirsty.  “I’ll go first.”
But as Dean Winchester was fond of saying, since when did anyone get what they deserved?
“And the others?” Dean asked, ceding that point to Sam.  The supply wagon would be fine.
“No offense, Cas.  But getting close to you now is the last thing I want to do.  Be patient; you’ll get all the closeness you’re little Alpha heart desires soon enough.”
“Of course,” Sam promised.
“They didn’t,” Ellen agreed, ducking her head.  “They’re both dead.  Wandell too.  And I found what was left of Martin up on the ridge.  They didn’t go quietly.  We found over a dozen bodies around there.”
Sebastian choked, once again expelling coffee. “A bluh..bluh…aga…against the car?  That car?” Sebastian seemed to have temporarily broken again.  Castiel waited.
“Well, well, well,” Dean murmured, eyes shuttering to demon black.  His hand emerged from the hay, blade free.  “Guess my Angel really is a centerfold.”
“Outside.  Now.”
“Dean, I, just…. if you recall when I had absorbed the souls of Purgatory…”
Benny leaned heavily against the railing.  “Right as rain, brother. Why do you ask?”
What would be the advantage of bringing attention to this situation, anyway?  It took Death to build a wall in Sam’s mind.  Bobby doubted the angel was likely able to do so without his Purgatory super strength or he would have done it back at the old warehouse.
Sam chuckled.  “You do have a little damage control,” he warned his brother.  “But it’ll keep.”
He began climbing the sturdy, ancient ladder hidden within the tunnel.  It was the work of minutes to reach the top rung and pop open the round hatch, revealing the Bunker’s roof and a velvet sweep of night scattered with stars.  Castiel took a long breath, inhaling the fresh, clean scent of pine.
“Maybe two hours.”
Castiel was confused.  The Bunker wasn’t close, exactly.  But it was well within range for a person who loved driving his car the way Dean did, and he had his own room there with a bed that remembered him.
“There is no way,” Brunette told him, blue eyes glittering with curiosity.
It was common courtesy to stay away when an omega in heat was with their chosen partner.   And simple common sense if it was an alpha in rut.  Which, thankfully Dean was not, or they’d never be able to get out of bed.
Sam shrugged.  “I never really gave it much thought.  I’ve heard worse names.  Still, it won’t hurt to keep a guard out for a while.  Good practice if nothing else.”
It was completely dark out by the time the long path Dean had chosen circled them back to the cabin.  Cas had disappeared and several more times during their walk; once with an additional beer in hand.
