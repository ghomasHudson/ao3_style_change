Tony considered that for a moment, then nodded. “You got it. I owe you one.” He took another big bite and turned around, waving a hand over his shoulder, no doubt heading back to his workshop for another fourteen or fifteen hours.
“You know, that was a pretty risky move, there,” Tony told him conversationally, unbuttoning his cuffs and rolling up first one sleeve and then the other as he walked over towards him. “I mean, just think of the paps who’d give their right
Steve moaned and shuddered, but didn’t try to move like that again. “Sorry,” he whimpered. “I just - you feel so good, and I want -”
Steve drew in a sharp breath. Tony moved around to his side and reached out to stroke a hand down his spine, sliding all the way down to squeeze his ass. “What got you going there, huh? The thought of everybody seeing what a slut you are for my cock, or knowing it would be all about Cap and Iron Man instead of Steve and Tony?”
“Hey!” he objected, more for the sake of objection and putting off the looming beatdown than for anything else.
“The team’s gonna be back soon,” he said conversationally, still keeping his movement slow. “They’ll walk through that door and be able to look out the windows and see their fearless leader standing out here just inches from losing it in his pants like the greenest recruit, all because Iron Man put a hand on his dick...”
“Really?” Steve sounded like he’d just been told he was about to get every Christmas and birthday gift he’d ever asked for. “You - ohhhh, fuck - you mean it?”
Tony smiled and took them into a loop that he knew would make Steve press up against the suit a little closer. ‘I know. You wanna fuck the suit.” And right now, he was having a hard time remembering why he’d said no the first time Steve had asked. “What if I said I was thinking about it?”
Clint paused for a moment to appreciate his work of art, mouth watering as he anticipated that first, perfect bite. “We’re gonna have a great night,” he told his sandwich, right before it - disappeared? What the hell?
“Mmmmhmmm, you’re damn right I did,” Tony hummed, dropping a kiss on the back of his neck. “Remember the first time I did this?” he asked as he started making his way down Steve’s spine, breathing the words hotly against his skin. “You just about came off the bed...”
expecting to see him on his knees just two steps away when he emerged from the suit-up area. “Holy shit,” Tony gasped. “You mean -”
pace tonight.” He stretched out full length next to Steve, shoving his fingers in deep and holding them still while he pressed up against Steve’s side and kissed his neck. “And I want to completely,” Kiss. “Thoroughly,” Kiss. “Wreck you,” Kiss. “Tonight.” Kiss.
Tony smirked at him and did it again. “I want you to,” he told him. “Wanna see you wrecked, remember? Just like the first time, when you were absolutely shocked that it could feel this fucking good.” He twisted his fingers again and let his pinky press up against the outside, like he might actually try to shove it in as well. “That was so fucking hot. I still jerk off to it.”
. Still, he gave Steve what he asked for, kissing him while flexing his fingers slightly inside him, letting him savor the feeling a little longer.
Steve splayed out and inches from orgasm right in front of him. “C’mon, Steve, fuck yourself on my fingers. Lemme see it.”
Downsides like turning around and suddenly being confronted by a small, red-headed omen of death. A very imminent death, if the look in her eyes was anything to go by. “I didn’t do it,” Tony immediately said, getting right to business. No matter what ‘it’ was, timely denials of guilt were always a good idea.
“You like that, huh? Like the thought of coming over and over again in your suit?” Tony was rubbing hard and fast now, and he could see from the way Steve’s whole body was tightening that it wouldn’t be much longer. “Fuck, Cap, you’re gonna lose it for me, aren’tcha? Come right out here for anyone that’s looking to see?”
“Hurry up,” Steve said, moving back far enough to let the removal sequence activate. “I wanna blow you. Now.”
It was like a Renaissance painting come to life - acres and acres of smooth, pale skin that just begged for Tony’s hands and mouth to mark them up. Not that he
“God, I need - please, fingers or cock, just... something, Tony,” Steve whined, and that was seriously never going to get old,
Steve slumped against him for a few seconds once he was done, then looked up at him, his eyes glittering brightly. “Take off the suit.”
Steve squirmed, pushing his ass back into Tony’s face in a silent demand for more, and Tony was only too happy to give it to him. He alternated between hungry lapping and sweet, sucking kisses before he pushed forward, just barely pressing in with the tip of his tongue. Steve barked out a hoarse cry that was a garbled mix of Tony’s name and about three swear words, his legs shifting restlessly on the bed as he obviously tried not to just rub off on the sheets.
Steve sucked in a sharp breath as two fingers stroked down along his crease while Tony’s tongue paused to lick a wet circle over the middle of his back. “I didn’t think you were serious about it.”
Tony laughed and leaned down to kiss him, nuzzling along his jaw while his hands eased a little further down, following the decidedly
Steve let out a little whine. “I can’t help it. The armor... it vibrates just a little, and when I’m pressed up against it and you start talking about -”
At least, that’s what he thought until he walked into the kitchen about a week later to find the world’s freakiest diorama waiting for him. A whole bunch of huge foam hands, all proclaiming themselves to be #1, in a variety of colors, were spread out around the kitchen. It took him a minute to put it all together, but finally it all sank in - the purple one with the bow leaning against his coffee cup, that was him, while the red one with the knife taped to it, that was Nat, and then there was the red one with a little hammer and the blue one with an American flag and - yep, that was a red and gold one taped to the overhead light. And clinging to the cabinet door was a bright green one that was twice as big as all the others. Clint sighed and yelled, “That wasn’t the kind of
One of the best things about fucking Steve Rogers was how very, very easy it was to get America’s National Icon off.
“That’s it,” Tony purred, and while Steve’s back and ass were works of art, they were nothing compared to the sheer perfection of a hot, horny,
Natasha’s eyes narrowed and she studied him for a long moment before she bit out, “Big time,” turned on her heel, and stalked off, leaving Tony to let out a long, relieved breath. He immediately sent DUM-E off to his corner.
“I sure hope not,” Steve said, turning his head to grin up at Tony. “Because I was promised you’d be doing a lot more than just
, or at least, not for long, but both of them certainly enjoyed his efforts. Tony ran a hand down Steve’s spine, watching the play of muscles under his skin as he shifted on the bed. “God, you’re gorgeous,” he told him. “I could spend all night just watching you move, you know that?”
Despite what many people might think, Tony Stark really did know a thing or two about art. He couldn’t help it - a lifetime of being dragged to this museum benefit and that exclusive auction had left their marks. But no statue or painting he’d ever seen could come close to matching the beauty of Steve Rogers spread out across his bed.
“Tonyyyy,” Steve whined, but he pushed himself to his hands and knees anyway, pulling one leg up as he turned over, hugging it close. Tony used the opportunity to give him the third finger back, knowing it would feel even fuller with the change in position, and from the way Steve gasped, it was especially good. “Ohhhhh my God!”
Clint sighed and looked back at the counter. At least he hadn’t put anything away yet. “This time I’m licking the bread before I start,” he muttered as he set about starting work on a second masterpiece. And Tony owed him, so that had to be worth something, probably something pretty good, given Stark Industry’s net worth and technological assets.
Tony groaned and threaded his fingers through Steve’s hair. “Love it when you’re so hot for my dick you just gotta have it,” he told him. “Don’t care who sees, do you? You’d suck me off right in front of Fury himself if he showed up right now, wouldn’t you?” Steve moaned around him, and Tony shuddered. Fuck, that was good. “Yeah, you would. You’re such a fucking slut, baby, and it’s so fucking hot.”
He knew he wasn’t going to last long, not with Steve sucking him like he was trying to strip chrome off a bumper, but then this was just the appetizer, something to take the edge off for both of them, so Tony wasn’t about to try to slow it down. “Deeper,” he urged Steve. “Gonna come in, like, three seconds, here, and I want you to get it all. You want it, don’tcha?”
Tony clucked his tongue against his teeth. “Not yet. Gotta let it build up, don’t wanna rush it, do you?” Steve’s whine said all too clearly that he
“You’re just lucky I didn’t make up some flimsy-ass excuse to drag you off right there and then,” Tony told him. ‘Do you have any fucking clue how hot that was?”
“Yeah,” he panted, fingers digging into the sheets, hips twitching as he fought against the urge to just roll with it and outright fuck back against Tony’s fingers. “Yeah, but I want - God, Tony, more?”
He looked up at her, his smile sliding from uncertain to charming and rakish as he took in the bathrobe and that’s when it clicked. Chris Noth. Mr Big.
“God, Tony!” Steve’s reaction never failed to settle right in the pit of his stomach, making him feel at once humbled by the fact that this god on earth allowed him to get this close, and ten feet tall at the same time, simply because he’d been the one to show Steve this kind of pleasure for the first time. Tony held back, counted silently to three, then licked slowly over Steve’s hole, exulting in the moan he pulled out of him in response. “Ohhhh my God...”
Tony reached out for the lube and backed off so Steve would be able to hear him flick the cap open. He smiled as he watched the shiver run through Steve in response while he slicked several fingers up. “Need something, Cap?” he asked casually. “Cause you seem kinda... tense.”
want to rush it, and Tony chuckled, then smacked Steve’s ass when he saw him thrust down against the bed. “Don’t you dare.”
Steve moaned, and really, if anyone on Earth had a clue that Captain America could make a sound like that, they’d have the stars and stripes off him in an instant. “Y-yeah. I want - God, Tony...”
Steve nodded. “Yeah. Right here.” His hands twitched, but he kept them at his sides until Tony reached him. “Can I?”
“You like that, huh? Like the thought of what people would say if they knew Captain America was a world class cocksucker? Like knowing there’s this dirty little secret under the superhero uniforms?” Tony started up a slow rub, moving up and down Steve’s length. “Just like when I fuck you right before a callout and you go out and fight evil with come running out of you.”
Steve grinned at him when they broke for air. “I’d say you’ll die happy, but I think I know a way to make you even happier,” he teased, one hand sliding down over Tony’s chest and stomach to palm his cock through his underwear. “What’s the line? Is that a heat-seeking missile in your pocket, Mr Stark, or are you just happy to see me?”
“And I owe you?” he offered, hoping against hope that it might be enough to save his bot, if not his balls.
Steve scrambled up and Tony took a minute to enjoy the view while he put himself back to rights, pulling his jeans back up and tucking his dick away. “Parade rest,” he ordered Steve, watching him slide smoothly into position without even thinking about it. And seriously,
Steve groaned and Tony saw his fingers flex in their position against his back. He whined faintly in the back of his throat and breathed, “Yes. Please, Tony.”
Steve whimpered a little and raised his hands to basically tear Tony’s jeans open and yank them and his boxer briefs down enough in front to get his cock out. As soon as he was free, one big hand closed around him and stroked, and Tony groaned. “God, that’s good. Shit, you really want it, huh?”
Four nights later, Natasha had just gotten out of the shower and was looking forward to a rare night in with House of Cards and Chinese food when her doorbell chimed. That was unusual - usually JARVIS announced deliveries or visitors, but she supposed it was possible that Tony had him busy in the workshop or loaded in the suit for a test drive. Pulling her robe on, she headed for the door, grabbing cash for the delivery boy on the way.
.” Tony could feel Steve rock against the armor a little harder, and he tightened his grip and boosted thrusters again.
The elevator doors at Stark Towers never hissed when they slid open. Tony would have considered that an affront to his mechanical skills - if he could manage an AI system that could run the entire tower, he could damn well ensure that the elevator doors opened soundlessly. Of course, there were downsides to that that he hadn’t exactly considered.
Tony guessed that Steve’s super-sensitivity to touch was a side effect of the serum, but he really didn’t care enough to ask. He was too busy reaping the benefits to bother, especially when those benefits included being able to make Captain Fucking America come in his pants like a fifteen year old right in the middle of the street. To be fair, the post-battle adrenaline high they were both riding probably helped the hair trigger along, but Tony didn’t mind, not when all it had taken was an ‘accidental’ glance with the back of his gauntlet over the front of Steve’s pants to make Steve draw in a sharp breath. Tony had looked at Steve in time to see him clench his jaw and he’d caught the little flutter of his eyelashes, and Jesus. That was just too fucking hot.
Strange smirks. "Sure," he drawls. "Well, good luck, Captain. Not that my opinion should matter anything to you but -- you deserve it. Peace, I mean," he adds, softly.
“I think – I think you do wear a collar,” Steve says, sounding a little regretful. “I know that’s not modern, I guess. But for as long as I owned you, I’d want you to wear one, and you want to do it, too. When people see you – they know. I don’t like fancy toys, and tools, and
He slips where the sweat from his palms slides down the door. He catches himself on a marble counter, hand clutching his chest. Relax, just relax, and breathe, breathe, breathe.
“Because it will be good for you,” Tony says bluntly. “Because it means you’ll stop hanging around here. You’ll be able to mix with other alpha, get out some of that energy, do productive work.”
"A scene a week would be fine." Tony murmurs, lying back in the water. "As long as, uh, he said something about maximising contact throughout the day, so." Tony wiggles his fingers. "Lot's of touching."
He bites down, abruptly. Tony swallows a sharp moan, exhales heavily instead. His eyes are shut, his head tipped back; Steve runs over the bite with his tongue, sucks hard, the swell of skin against his lips bordering into pain.
“But that would change everything,” Steve says. “No stones means – no Red Skull, not really. I wouldn’t have crashed. And New York wouldn’t have happened. There would be no team, Bucky never would have – “
“Two nights ago you asked if I wanted ice in my drink, then laughed and said, ‘oh, of course not, how stupid of me’.”
He felt Steve’s cock jerk hard under his hand as Steve moaned, pulsing out come that didn’t ever soak through to the pristine Captain America uniform. Tony stroked him right through it, waiting until Steve gasped, “Stop,” before he let his hand drop and kissed him.
“It’s fine, Tony,” Sarah says gently. “I live in the city. I can take you in after our session and drive you back.”
Steve figures Tony doesn’t need a dog that will calm him down, necessarily. He thinks it would be better if Tony just had something to do. The workshop is off limits, and there’s only so much TV, so many books, you can watch and read before it grows tiresome. A dog means daily walks, and training, and someone to keep living for. That is, if it works. Chances are, Tony could look at the dog and tell Steve to dump it in a trash can.
Don’t you fucking get it? I don’t want that money, I don’t want the patents, I don’t want the houses, and cars. I want — I can’t
“Are you real?” Tony asks, feeling like an idiot, feeling weak. Asking a question like that, it legitimises the paranoia, it legitimises the voices. But he has to, because the phone feels real in his hand, it had rang, and Sarah had told him to get it. He sinks down to the ground, phone pressed to his ear, hand fisted in his hair.
Steve talks to him as they walk but a lot of it goes over his head, he just smiles and nods, smiles and nods, smiles and nods. The leaves are a swish-crunch under his boots. The air feels bitingly cold but his coat is warm, and so are his pants. Steve tells him that Natasha bought this coat from a store that specialises in arctic wear, and Tony is glad, because he’s never warm anymore.
Usually he would go the grave and lay flowers, but how can he now? Fuck, God he can’t ask Steve. He doesn’t know how he could broach it, and even if there wasn’t all this bad blood… he wouldn’t want to. He wants it to be private, solitary, and he doesn’t want or need Steve’s pressing guilt cloying him up the whole way there and back.
Thor holds out his hand, demanding, cursing his brother’s existence. “Always gets away,” he’s muttering, “this is like the halls of learning all over again, guess who’s left holding the snake when all is said and done – “
“There are people in there,” Tony mutters, and his voice is tight, he’s folded in on himself. “I’m not – I can’t.”
“That’s not my ultimate fantasy, Steve. I know you have one. Go on,” Tony pouts, dragging his foot up and down the length of Steve’s leg, “tell me. You know it gets me hot to think about all the ways I can serve you.”
He’s holding Tony’s arm, pulling him away, into a back room. “You’re dressed like a whore,” he says, bluntly.
“Tomorrow is – it’s the day – it’s the day I would usually go to my parent’s grave,” Tony gets out, wincing. The air is sharp around his cheeks, and it’s just started to snow.
Killian puts his hand on his waist, where Steve’s had been, before. He decides he doesn’t like it, and realises that even though he doesn’t like it, he isn’t going to tell Killian to stop.
“Make sure they know!” Steve calls after him. “Don’t be afraid, now. Tell them all I’m coming for them, too!”
Richards’ eyes widen, he jolts, stepping back. “You – “ he starts, “you leave me be. I’ve done nothing wrong, you hear me? It was years ago,
He punctuates his words with another, well-aimed dig into the strained muscle on Tony’s shoulders. Despite himself, he feels his eyes grow heavy – can’t help it, instinct is a bitch, and instinct wants to tell him that Rogers is looking out for him, is stronger than him, is so much – much better at – uh…
Thor sounds weary, tired. Steve doesn’t know what to say. “I’m sorry,” he begins “I know that — if Loki — “
Tony moans, shifting on his knees. He brings one hand down to play with his cock and Steve tugs at his hair, lifting back his head harshly, a reminder. "No." He warns, and then he guides Tony's mouth back down to his length. "Stay still." He orders, and Tony calms, allowing Steve to steer him.
He knows his name. Tony. Toe-nee. He can open his mouth, he can imagine the sound of the words. But his mouth won’t make the shape – it can’t spit out the thing he can visualise so clearly in his head. “Targhhh,” he manages, and then shuts his mouth.
“I don’t know. Half the fun is not having to rely on cheap gimmicks. You should be able to shut me up without a gag, Rogers.”
Tony narrows his eyes. “You’d let him have me if that’s what he asked for, even if I went kicking and screaming.”
“I was taught how to apologise pretty,” Tony says from under his lashes, “but they also taught me how to thank pretty, too. Do you want to see me thank you, Sir?”
Steve stares at him, in-between ladling stew from a large metal vat into a bowl. “You’re here,” he says, betraying neither positive or negative emotion.
"Please stop." Steve says "You safeworded, you've never done that before. I was out of line, I know I was out of line. I didn't mean what I said, Tony, you were right, I was just -- I was covering up, okay? I don't want to be weak, I fucking don't, and I'm stubborn, that's all. I don't want you hurt anymore than you have been and -- fine, I have my own issues and it makes me say things I don't mean."
It’s a small metal roller-ball, the kind you would get on the cheap lip-gloss that came with the teen magazines Tony read as a kid. He scents it, delicately, once. “Oh,” he says.
Tony blinks hazily at him, a strip of come dripping off his eyelash. Steve gently brushes it away, gathering more seed on his fingers.
he doesn’t feel safe. At best, it’s just because he’s embarrassed himself enough already, and doesn’t want to face Pierce so soon. At worst – he can’t explain it. Like the hairs on the back of his neck are standing on end. Like, the walls have eyes. Like he’s being watched, or worse. Pierce’s coat is still slung over the back of a chair in Steve’s kitchen. He should return it. He needs to return it.
“Yes. Yes, I’m sorry. I’m sorry it was so fucking innocent of me to expect my partner to support me, to trust me on my word.”
They reach the base in the early hours of the morning. It’s dark, but Steve can maybe just about imagine a pink lining across the bottom of the sky. Tony doesn’t let him push him and instead walks, following just behind Steve, into the main entryway, which is blessedly empty. “You’ll have your own room,” Steve promises “your own bed, soon. I swear. But – just for the first few days, we need to keep an eye on you. You can take my bed, I’ll sleep on the couch, it’s fine. You won’t even notice I’m there.”
“Ah-ah,” he chides, “you’re not sleepy, power on through now, c’mon. I asked you a question, Tony. I said, do you remember me?”
“Tell me what to do,” Tony asks, because he can’t be bothered to dress it up. He just wants to hear Steve’s voice, giving him instruction.
Real? Alive? Here. Somehow, after all of them have died, he is here, he has made it, and – what is that? That feeling? Is it anguish?
“Don’t you worry yourself about Steve,” Pierce says, squeezing his waist comfortingly. “He’s going to be fine. You just focus on putting one foot after another.”
Killian sits back, smiles, buttons up his jacket with one hand. “Apologies,” he says, “I’ve stolen your time.”
Tony appreciates that she doesn’t deride him thinking that every set of parents has enough money to support their kids. Instead, she tells him to set aside the stress balls and pick up a pen. “Draw a picture,” she says. “Start with something simple – let’s see if we can work on those lines.”
He doesn’t normally get up this early, but he finds he isn’t able to get back to sleep. Twitching, he throws on a coat and boots and gently slides out the front door.
“Now – I’m not saying straight away. You’ll need time to prove yourself, of course, prove your loyalty. Maybe some… education. But in a couple years – you’re a fine specimen, Steve. Bred to lead, hmm? Just like this one,” Pierce claps Tony’s knee, he flinches, “is bred to be at your side. Or at least, at the side of someone like you.”
Tony feels – calmed, eyelids a little heavy. “Sometimes I don’t like to be treated right,” he hears himself saying.
Maybe that’s too far; most likely, it is, because Rogers shutters off, eyes going blinkered, hard. “You asked for it,” he says roughly, sliding his hand into Tony’s hair,
Nick knocks. “You alright in there, Stark?” He hears him say in that long-suffering, cautious voice. “There’s only one bathroom, you know, and I’m no spring chicken.”
Tony’s eyes blurring again, not with tears, more with – drugs. He feels his face twitch. “I don’t – feel great. I don’t feel good, I – “
“Steven,” Thor greets. “I hope you don’t mind, but I intend to stay awhile. Settle my earth affairs.”
“Right. Ask him. Next time, think it through first. You can’t afford to lose focus because Tony is dead.”
When he's like this, he's something else. He's something perfect. Something fresh, and sweet, and warm. When he presses his cheek into Steve's palm, eyes glazed and pupils blown with the drop, he's like a special present, something for Steve's eyes only, a side of him that only he will ever see.
Steve watches her retreat. “She was charming,” he says. “I didn’t know you went for beta women. Did you date?”
It’s worse. And he hopes he’s just imagining the sound of rats in the corner. Rats, or – shadows, creeping along the wall like weeds, slithering. They peel back when Tony looks at them directly, like they were never there. When he gets close to the sleep, the black closes in, he thinks,
It seems too cruel. To give Tony a lease on life – no matter how small – and then rip it away once more. Send him back to a room with no comforts, no one to visit, let him waste away. Because Steve knows, with a sort of aching urgency, that Tony won’t get better if he’s left that way. He knows that, if Tony is committed now, he might never come out again. There will never be a point at which he is prepared to face life on his own. He can’t do that. He can’t let that happen. Not to Tony. And not because of him.
“Your temperamental behaviour hasn’t gone unnoticed,” Fury supplements. “There’s a sizeable minority who think you’d do better on consultant basis.”
And now he sleeps curled on his side, sweltering under a duvet, and parka, and sweater. He’s kicked off his sweats in the night, so his legs are bizarrely bare other than the thick coat. And they’re so thin, Steve thinks, once, Tony had laid in bed while Steve slowly made his way up his left leg, pressing kisses gently to the sensitive soles of his feet, calves, his soft inner thighs. Tony had snorted and giggled and fucked Steve the way he liked to be fucked, long and slow with a good burn in his muscles and sweat on his skin as he pushed himself back on Tony.
Killian leans closer. Face to face. “I was hoping to take you upstairs and give you a demonstration,” he murmurs.
The tips of his ears turn pink. “Oh,” he says, realising, maybe. “Well, you know. It was the right thing to do.”
isn’t a masochistic punch to the gut. “Steve,” Tony starts, not sure if he really wants to try and stop him, “I don’t need to tell you that – things are different. People might get the wrong impression if they see me – “
“You would have used Stone once,” Steve says quietly. “And he would have given you things you needed, at the time. But that didn’t stop you from flinching when he touched you, and I’ll bet, Tony, that it didn’t make the things he did feel good, or not hurt.”
Tony does. Steve’s hair is longer than it used to be. He likes it. He has a beard; that, he’s not too fond off. His eyes are the same shade of blue, and there’s a fresh cut just above his left brow, already healing.
They ask him about Rhodey and Tony screams at them. “I’ll never fucking tell you,” he says “I’ll never say a word.”
It’s not just Ross. Two beta men in uniform, an older alpha woman with her sleeves rolled up to her elbows. “Oh great,” Tony says, mouth twisting. “The whole gang is here.”
Tony eyes it warily, and then stares at Steve. He stares back, uneasy. And almost imperceptibly shakes his head.
“That’s not what he said!” The man says, standing, shakily supporting himself with the wall. “There’s only one way we win. Maybe Strange saw me alive, at the end, when we take him down. But it’s not me alone. I have a team on earth – Jesus, I – had a team. Some of them will still be alive. We have to go to earth, not – “
“Better,” Tony says, and Steve’s smile is too genuine. It hurts that Steve wants to help him, now, after everything that’s happened. Tony wants to ask where all this concern was when he left Tony in Siberia.
Tony thinks. “No,” he says, finally. Last time, Tony was naked and Steve wasn’t. He doesn’t like it. That’s not happening again until he’s seen Steve the same way.
“Now, just what kind of alpha would I be if I let my subordinate get away with that kind of talk, huh?”
“I don’t need to tell you that footage is incriminating for both of us. You don’t exactly come out of it looking like a rose.”
He holds out one of Tony’s receivers, Pym-particles already in place. “This will take you back,” he says, “already coded, 1945, the day I went down. You can just live out your life like this never happened.”
“The word is ‘avenge’. Revenge would mean – getting revenge on the people I miss. You revenge the lost. You avenge them.”
“Fight. We’re trying to break down the chemical components now,” Hill’s lips twist, pausing to let Tony through a doorway, “point is, it triggers extreme fight response.
But Steve is just rocking him, slightly. He brushes his hand over the back of Tony’s head, his bare scalp, stroking over and over. “Wow,” he says, arms still wound tight around Tony’s waist, “I like the new look.”
“The most responsive thing I have ever seen. And all this, just for me – the first one to unwrap all this goodness, hmm Tony?”
“Do you think,” Tony drips, poison, aware he’s being cruel but not able to stop it, “that I give a fuck about what you think?”
The things he could have had, if hadn’t been so fucking stupid. It’s not worth thinking about. He sighs, turns over, presses his head between Steve’s shoulder-blades. This is good, too.
Steve drops him. Abruptly, with no warning, lets him fall to the floor, hit himself hard on the cold metal grilling under the window. He splays out, one sweating palm on the window for purchase, cursing blindly. “Are you insane?!” He spits, starting to stand. “Are you fucking out of your – “
God, Tony loved it when Steve got like this, playful and almost drunk on sex and orgasm. He pushed his hips forward into Steve’s hand and laughed. “It’s both, sweetheart. Your very own heat-seeking missile, no pockets needed.”
Of course, JARVIS would alert him the second the Avengers got near an elevator, but Tony wasn’t above a little bit of a mindfuck, particularly when it helped get Steve off this hard. He pressed down a little and began rubbing faster. “One of these days I’m gonna make you come so much it’ll leak right through the suit,” he murmured. “Get you so fucking filthy wet with it that nobody’ll miss seeing how bad you want it. They’ll all know what a slut you are then, Cap.”
All that earned him was a self-satisfied smirk. “And you do good work, buddy,” Tony assured him. “Trust me, if I ever decide to let Jefferson go, I’ll definitely keep you in mind.”
“That feel good?” Tony twisted them slowly as he pushed all the way in, then back out, beginning a slow, easy fingerfuck. He knew it wouldn’t be quite enough, wouldn’t offer Steve what he was really wanting, but it would ramp the pleasure up just a little bit, and that was all he wanted right now. “Like having something filling you up?”
“Hold still,” he ordered. “You wanna get off on the suit that bad, you’re gonna have to keep still for me and take it like a good boy.” And okay, so he wasn’t above exploiting Steve’s little obedience kink, but he wasn’t about to be sorry for it, not when it earned him that little whimper in response. “You can do that for me, can’t you, baby? Listen to me while you’re pressed up against the suit that you want to come all over?”
It was a particularly kinky way to refer to the new waterproof weave he’d incorporated into the weave of the Captain America uniform, one that never failed to rev Steve up. Tony didn’t know if it was because it brought Cap into their sex life and therefore dirtied up America’s Golden Boy a little, or if had more to do with him being the one to make the uniform (and make it so Steve could come in it and have nobody know about it), but he wasn’t about to question it, not when they both got off hard on it. “Fuck, yeah,” Steve gasped, and Tony made his move. He dropped them to the launchpad, cut power to thrusters and repulsors, then grabbed Steve’s ass and squeezed hard.
“Every bit of it,” she ground out, although she didn’t stop looking like she planned on grabbing the nearest wrench and taking DUM-E apart bolt by bolt.
“Yeah? Was it seeing me come in front of everybody or knowing you did it?” Steve let out a little moan that sounded like -
She smiled sweetly. “I don’t need a reason to want to hurt you, Stark. And I’m pretty sure the half of the Western Hemisphere you’ve slept with would agree with me.”
Steve runs his hands over Tony’s dry hair. It’s brittle, like straw, not lush and shining and thick like it should be.
“I said, the worst part is, this wasn’t even hard. I have never met such a poor judge of character in my life.”
Nick nods. “Well,” he says, almost reassuring, “that won’t last long. We reckon there’s a pretty rapid cooling off period, once the worst of it’s made its way through your system.”
The human doesn’t respond, just rocks slightly, back and forth, like a child whose father has punished them for a misdemeanour. “Get up,” she says again, “Quill arrived in the Milano. It might still be here.”
“Yeah,” the man says, “we met a few years back. I called you a whore, Captain America made me apologise.”
“Don’t touch me!” And Tony spins. He pants, slams his fists against the wall, again and again, and then cracks the door when he leaves. And Steve slumps in his chair, with Sinatra still playing in the background and his unopened presents resting on the couch.
He begins to massage the foam into Tony's hair, and Tony feels himself purr, hears the soft, low noises coming from somewhere deep in his chest. "It's good," he slurs "the, the gag. We should do it again."
It’s good, riding Steve. He has his head leaning back against the couch, his eyes half-lidded, mouth slightly open. He cups Tony’s waist, and for the most part just lets him get on with it, occasionally thrusting his hips, disrupting Tony’s flow, the slick, wet slapping sound of his ass against Steve’s thighs.
Tony doesn’t ask what happened to his briefs. He puts on the pants, lets Steve button up the shirt, straighten his tie. Frowning, he flattens Tony hair, or tries to; “They’re going to think we’ve had a fight,” he tells him.
Steve wraps a large hand around Tony’s; his knuckles seem extra prominent. He wants to tell Tony no, that he’ll never have to see or speak to anyone ever again if that’s what it takes to make him happy again, that they can move to the mountains and live their lives as hermits as long as Tony promises he won’t ever, ever try to take his life again. But he owes Tony the truth. “You’ll have to see them eventually,” he says quietly.
His hips twitch into Tony’s hand. He sucks at the base of Steve’s cock as he uses his fingers on him. “Do you like that, Captain?” He asks, a string of drool between Steve’s skin and his lips.
Tony blinks, wriggles free from Steve’s grip. He goes to wipe the sweat from his palm, only to realise it’s blood, and he’s aggravated the cuts. He hisses.
The girl shrugs. “We can never be sure,” she says “he was found on the streets. He’s big, and has the colouring, so we thought maybe something mixed with a St Bernard? Or maybe Bernese? One of those mixed with a Labrador, or Retriever. He’s so gentle, you know?”
“Absolutely I do. Doesn’t mean I’m – do you not have emotions?” The human asks, and it’s not cutting, or cruel; he’s genuinely wondering. “Like, your species, are they some kind of Vulcan – “
“There’s sick on your clothes, Tony,” Pierce tells him, directly into his ear, breath hot. “It smells like distress. If you keep them on, it will upset you. I am going to take off your clothes, now. You’re going to let me.”
responsive, Tony.” Fingers gripping his chin. Pulse slow, and steady. He wants to panic. He wishes he could panic.
Tony snorts. He makes himself laugh, sometimes. Sipping his scotch he sighs, tips his head back and back until it’s resting over the couch arm, the world spinning. He grins up at Steve’s upside down head, blood rushing to his brain. “So?” He says. “I know you’re dying to tell me, darling. What’s in the bag?”
That being said, he does have a cruel side. So do you. I’ve seen it, I’ve seen how you talk to people you do not like, to people you consider beneath your notice. That is not necessarily a bad thing. People have bad sides. And you'll need it. I know your father plans on leaving you his estate, naming you heir. You'll need to be cruel, Tony, and you'll need to have a kick. And maybe it was my place to teach you that but, I have already mentioned, as a mother my talents are lacking.
He heard Steve fumble in the bedside drawer for a bit before a tube was pressed into his hand. But Tony didn’t go for the lube right away - instead, he laid it by Steve’s hip and nudged his legs apart, making a space for himself so he could ease down between them. And then he was six inches from Steve’s absolute masterpiece of an ass. Tony stroked his hands over it, tracing the swell, then carefully parted the cheeks, leaned in, and breathed out, a hot wash of air directly over sensitive skin.
“Fuck,” Tony swore, tightening his grip on Steve’s waist. “Made me so fucking hard, Steve, you don’t even know. Watching you come like that just cause I brushed you...”
That was all it took. Steve shoved his hips forward and moaned, his head falling back as he rode out what looked like a pretty damn spectacular orgasm. “Yeah, that’s it,” Tony crooned. “That’s my good boy, coming like that for me, so sweet. Fuck, yeah, Steve. So fucking hot.”
He could see Steve’s throat work as he swallowed. “Not the part about the tabloids, but what you said about Captain America sucking Iron Man off...” Steve broke off on a groan as Tony flexed his fingers, squeezing him just a little. “God.”
He had no clue if it was the threat/promise of another finger or the dirty talk, but Steve let out a strangled moan and Tony watched his cock jerk as he shot off. And that was another thing he was never going to get over, seeing Steve come untouched, watching his dick twitch and fire one white streak after another to land on his abs while he gasped for breath like he’d run a marathon. “Yeah, that’s it,” Tony said, rubbing his prostate right through it until he shuddered and whined a faint protest. “Fuck, you’re so - Jesus, Steve.”
“I keep telling you that it’s just Tony, but if you wanna elevate me to god status, I’m not gonna argue,” Tony teased, then set to work. He kissed, sucked, licked, and nibbled at the edge of Steve’s hole, never sticking with any one action long enough to give Steve a chance to anticipate what might be coming next. This wasn’t about anything but teasing, playing and enjoying himself, hearing Steve’s moans give way to whimpers and whines as Tony toyed with his body. He kept things lush, hot, and wet, then when he knew Steve was relaxing into it, he backed off and blew a light stream of cool air over him, just to hear Steve yelp.
“Tony, what?” Tony nipped his ear and palmed his ass, squeezing one cheek. “I’m not supposed to tell you just how much I like it when you get yourself clean just for me? Because I know this was for me, baby. And you know why, don’t you?”
“At ease, Cap.” He smacked his ass lightly. “C’mon, let’s go hit the showers and get something to eat. You’ve got a long night ahead of you and you’re gonna need those extra calories.”
Steve just moaned and shoved down further, pushing forward until Tony could feel the head of his cock nudge at the back of Steve’s throat. He heard Steve choke just a bit, felt his throat work around him, and that was it - he was gone, coming in hot, sweet bursts that were just too good to be believed. It was enough of a struggle to keep his knees from giving out that Tony almost didn’t remember to pull back enough to let Steve get it on his tongue, but Steve’s hands closed on his hips and squeezed, a silent plea that helped him come back to himself in time to make sure Steve got at least a decent taste.
“You’re close, aren’tcha?” He boosted both thrusters and repulsors again until they were just inches off the ground. “Gonna come all over the inside of those special patriotic panties I made you for me?”
He watched a blush move down the back of Steve’s neck. Steve’s blushes were things of wonder - he had a truly filthy mouth, but sometimes the tamest inferences could turn him into a ripe tomato. “Tony...”
Jesus. That was definitely enough to make Tony resolve to tweak the stripping algorithm for speed as soon as possible. As it was, he had to restrain himself from trying to help with the process, knowing that would only slow it down, but damn, it was hard to keep his steps measured and even when there was a horny supersoldier just waiting to blow him at the end of the walk. He was fully expecting to see Steve leaning up against the wall watching Tony’s custom launch pad take his suit off, but he was
Steve lets himself sit. “It’s fine,” he says, suddenly. “It’s fine, Pepper says she was going to alert the Avengers, they’ll be able to track the plane, the jeep we drove in to get here, they’ll be able to find us, it’s,” he laughs, the relief hits him “it’s okay!”
He pauses, just before he drinks; the smell is almost too much, he’s not sure if his body will let him swallow or try to expel it, choke him. He wavers in that moment, and it’s his undoing.
to him! He’ll fucking hurt me anyway, Steve, don’t be a stupid boy and think past your prick, if he’s got a plan it doesn’t matter what – “
“You poked mine first.” He doesn’t let go of Tony’s wrist; if anything, his grip shifts, tightens. “All that talk in the lab, ‘put on suit’. Everything special about me came out a bottle, right?”
It makes his chest curdle, a heavy weight settle on his shoulders. He leaves the coffee grounds, takes his breakfast back to the bedroom that he and Tony shared.
Maybe it would have felt claustrophobic once. But now it’s more protected than Tony’s ever felt. Who could hurt him here, safe under the earth, with Steve at his back. The thing – the pain, or tension, or fear – in his stomach dislodges, then dissolves. He forgets.
“What did I – why are you…” Tony trails off. He thinks, the carpet is scratchy under his palms, and he hopes it isn’t bugs. “What did I do?”
Fury’s eye is observing him. He sees it watch the top of his head, and then focus back on Tony’s face. “Are you done?” He asks, bluntly.
he says again, pinching him by the scruff of his neck, his sensitive, soft nape, all those fragile nerve endings ready to be plucked, ready to make him hurt.
he snarls, and he bats Tony away, pushes his head into the pillow. Except he uses the flat side of his palm, and although it probably isn’t meant to be a beating it feels like a slap.
“Sure,” Steve says awkwardly. He realises that he doesn’t want to go back into the bedroom the once shared. He realises it would probably be bad taste to drink, all things considered.
“We’ve been calling him Thor but – “ the girl blushes slightly. “I don’t know. You might want to change that.”
Steve gets Tony some books, and a new collar for Mosely. He didn’t want to be extravagant, not when that was something Tony used to love doing.
When Pierce holds out his arms, embraces him, Tony forgets why he was ever worried in the first place. That was stupid. It’s safe here. He knows it. Just – knows it. Instinctively. The hairs on the back of his neck flatten. He makes pointless, trivial conversation, and lets the children sit on his knee, ask him about Iron Man, ask him if
Five days after the start of Tony’s major depressive episode, Sam and Steve pack him into the back of a car. He doesn’t ask where they’re going, just rests his head against the window and watches his breath fog the glass. Their first stop is the clinic; the psychiatrist sits with Tony and asks him questions about how his meds made him feel, why he wanted to stop taking them, what are the side effects, and why won’t he get out of bed. Tony answers, barely; most are to the vein of ‘I want to die’.
Tony's tongue works around Steve's length and Steve allows it, lying back and sighing, letting Tony work his cock. They stay that way for a few minutes, not really moving, Steve just enjoying the feel and Tony trying his hardest to please.
“C’mon,” he says, “I don’t want to drag it out. I know what you want, Tony, I can smell it all over you.”
The tap is dripping. Steve is thinking. His thumbs rub wet circles around the inside of Tony’s wrists. “My deepest, darkest fantasy,” he rumbles, voice smiling, “is.” He seems to think some more. “I’ve been out. Working. It’s been hard, I’m tired. The job went well, but it was hard-won.”
Tony accepts this. He doesn’t want to see Nebula now, her twitching lips, her dark pits for eyes. The stew is good, the meat tender, almost too spicy for his tastes. “Thor was just telling us what happened,” Bruce says, closing the lid on the pot. “He says Asgard is gone.”
Tony doesn’t honestly know. He’s been drinking for three days straight, and the days and nights have blurred. He shrugs.
“That’s what I like to hear,” Tony says, stuffing his hands in his pockets. “Hey – where’d your shield go?”
Tony’s hand is still shaking. He takes it, cautiously, eyes lowered, head bowed. He dries his eyes, wipes mucus from his face.
Tony tries. He looks at Steve’s face. His eyes don’t focus well. He feels himself listing to the side.
“It’s fine, Steve. Duty calls. Or, it called. I was the one who convinced you to take up with Pierce’s STRIKE team anyway.” And doesn’t he just live to regret it every day.
Tony’s all stretched out in his armchair, shoes kicked off, bowtie slung over his neck, shirt unbuttoned. There’s some kind of motherboard in his lap, red wires and tape, and the screwdriver is held limply in his left hand. It’s not just tonight – Tony is always tired, these days. Especially since what they did to him in the Cape.
"Hold it in." Steve orders, swooping down to catch his knees in his arms, picking him up. Steve is running, and Tony groans, his pressing his head against his chest to try and keep it still. Everything is so fucking blurry, he doesn't remember the quinjet taking off but he's aware that he's in Steve's arms. Maybe he blacks out. He must black out. Or maybe he just sleeps. Either way, when he awakes, he's not in a hospital.
Nick lets him take his plate, but he doesn’t say anything while Tony rinses it down. Usually, this is the point where Tony retires to the cot. But tonight, Nick says, “How about some cards?”
The chair creaks. Tony lifts his gaze. “He’s going to kill you,” he says again, as Pierce dials, hovers the cell by his ear.
That’s not new. There are loads of drugs like that, Tony’s been on the receiving end both willingly and unwillingly a few times.
Tony is still sitting on the edge of the bed, and he's still wearing the smock, but there's a drip in his arm. "Why is there a drip in my arm?"
“I hear them too,” Thor says, assuredly, calmly, quietly. “I think – perhaps, it is some kind of cruel jape. Or that Loki sends himself from beyond the grave to taunt me. But he does not. I am… the victim of an over-productive imagination.”
Steve scents his neck, deeply. It feels good to have him there. Like he belongs there. His hands are creeping up Tony’s back, pulling closer, a hand in his hair, gripping. And tugging.
“Ah,” Sarah notes. “Of course. This would be the best angle to see everything, wouldn’t it? Well can I get you a pillow at least?”
“Tony, I need you to stop thinking this has anything to do with you,” Steve tells him. “It’s on me, okay? I couldn’t handle you with other people, I couldn’t handle seeing you hurt, I couldn’t handle the thought of you in harm’s way. There’s no mystery, it’s not – I thought if I left, I could be better for you. Or that – you would realise you didn’t need me, or want me. Or even like me, really.”
Natasha relents, easily, and they hold the service at night for her ease. The plot he has marked out in the graveyard, the Stark plot, was buried with an empty coffin weeks ago. This is more personal. This will be Tony Stark’s final resting place.
Tony doesn’t know what he thinks. Pierce smells like… like… Tony is fifteen, and naked on his hands and knees, wet and hard.
Whose eyes are clear, now, and looking down at him. “Stark,” he says, thickly. He scents like shame. Shame, shame, shame, and even distress, which upsets him.
Pierce stubs out his cigarette, fiddles with the pack, starts a new one. Pierce pretends he’s unconcerned, but Tony knows: he smokes when he’s nervous. He pockets the lighter.
“Aren’t you something special, with your suits, and your team, and your tower.” Ty’s pupils are blown, slightly. “You’re the most special omega that’s ever lived.”
“I tried to kill myself,” Tony says, but he lets his head drop back against the wall in relief. “Twice, maybe three times. It’s okay though, I’m better.”
The words sound strange out of his mouth, it’s obvious they haven’t made them many times before.  Strange must have tried to comfort him, talk to him. The kid is hanging on by a thread. “It’s fine,” Steve says, to medical staff who creep close, offering to take him off his hands, “I’ll handle it. Help the others.”
Hands shaking. He flags down the cab, tells them Steve’s apartment building in a clipped, short voice. It’s burning a hole inside him, by his ribs. He should tear it up. Instead, he turns his nose into the collar of the Pierce’s coat, takes comfort from the scent. He wishes he wouldn’t.
That’s so benevolent, Tony thinks internally. He shakes the thought, pushes it down; Steve has been kind to him, hasn’t he.
Steve draws back. He scratches moss from the floor, rips a part of Gus’ shirt which he no longer has use for, ties it tight around his side. Gus winces, his hands move automatically to clutch at Steve’s shirt.
“Damn right. We caught him red handed, so I made sure he got my handprint on his ass that night. And after I’d bent him over my lap, I had him crawl through the mud to Buck’s tent. And can you guess what Buck did then?”
You are also immensely kind, Tony. Immeasurably. That I have seen since you were a child. And if even I have seen it, you can be sure it’s real because I barely ever saw you at all. I see less of it in you today, because life has dulled your kindness at the edges. Life has taken that spark you carried with you and eroded it into something round and no longer sharp. It is easier to be cruel, I know. But you're my son, and I was kind once. And your father can be. I won't pretend you've won the luck of the draw with genetics, Tony, but on that count we don't entirely fail.
It’s just one more indignity really, isn’t it? The smell of distress must be upsetting them, because he can scent Pierce getting that odd, protective, angry tinge in response. “It’s fine,” he tells him, “you’ve had a shock. You smell very stressed, Tony – don’t worry about that, someone will clean it. I think you need to be somewhere safe, don’t you think? Not in the hallway, it’s not safe in the hallway.”
“Mmm,” Tony agrees, carefully climbing into the tub. He slips between Steve’s legs, his back to his chest. He intertwines their hands.
He fingers tighten, but he makes no move to put Tony on his hands and knees, even though he’s wet and ready. “C’mon,” Tony urges, grinding himself against him. “It’ll help, Steve.”
“Yeah,” Tony nods “yeah probably. I’m just — a client, you know. So she wouldn’t tell me everything. That’s why I — “ Tony clears his throat, starts to shuffle away. “Okay,” he’s saying “that’s okay.”
he thinks, viciously. “Bullshit,” he says, “you haven’t got the balls. You’d never be able to. You couldn’t afford to. The second you try anything you can forget Iron Man. Everything you’ve worked for will go up in smoke. And besides that? I figure you’re probably a good man, Nick. Not the kind to blackmail sweet innocent omegas into contracts.”
Strange sets down the teapot, delicately. "It was a team-effort," he says. "I was always very aware it wouldn't work without all of you."
“I was 15,” Tony scoffs, “of course I didn’t. But he was kind to me, if that’s what you’re wondering. It wasn’t like – “
Before Tony responds, he’s putting two fingers inside him no prep. Tony is tight – he could have done with the stretch. Still, Steve is anything if not efficient. He fucks him carelessly, almost lazily, seeming to enjoy the sound of Tony trying not to moan at the feel of his fingers, helpless, forced to accept the pleasure. “Is that good, sweetheart?” He drawls, accent all Brooklyn-sharp.
He feels his meds start to work. Everything becomes very muted. Steve asks if he wants to go for a walk and he smiles and nods. The voices calm themselves. Steve straps up Tony’s boots tight, changes his sweater, lets him put the parka back on and fits him with some gloves and a scarf. The meds mean this doesn’t bother Tony nearly as much as it should.
“Like I would make him look at you,” Steve laughs. “You’re going to make amends, the only way you know how. You’re going to list off names,
“I’m not worried,” Tony says calmly, and it’s almost true, because with the meds it is hard to be worried. The room falls quiet, though, and Tony wonders if it’s something he said.
Tony stares at him. He softens, imperceptibly; his fingers tighten in Steve’s arm. “Uh,” he says, looking at him, confused, but not upset. “Yeah. Well – okay, Steve. I accept your thanks.” He wiggles his fingers as if blessing him. “Go forth now, having been – I don’t know, redeemed, or something.” He stops, sighs, shrugs his shoulders. “Hey, if this means anything to you – you made the right call, Steve. Back there, with the wormhole. I like that. I respect it.”
It must be the drugs. They’re making him so – so fucking anxious, that must be it. The things in the corners of his eyes, the futile panic.
There had been a few incidents, towards the end. Tony, souped up on medication and suffering from alcohol withdrawal, had said some things to Steve, mean, nasty things. Things about his choices, yes, but also bizarre insults about his mother, his father, where he was from and what he had to put up with. He had said he wished Steve had stayed stuck on ice, that he had died in the crash, that his whore mother had fucked some other alcoholic, that she had considered protection. He had ranted about how he knew, just knew that Steve and Bucky were screwing, that they had always been screwing, that they were fuckbuddies long before Tony was around.
“Fuck, that was... God, you’re amazing,” he told Steve when he could manage to form words again. Grinning down at Steve, he gave him a second to bask in the praise before he stepped back and said, “Okay, soldier, up and at ‘em. C’mon, on your feet.”
Tony reached around to cup his cock, giving him just a hint of pressure through the thick weave of his uniform. “I think it’s more one than the other, though, don’t you?”
Somehow, Tony managed to make it through the rest of the post-battle fray: holding the brief press gaggle, meeting with first responders for an immediate debrief, setting out the first markers for the construction crews that will arrive soon, and dealing with the everpresent kids that have to be constantly shooed away from the live wires and unstable debris. He did it all in a sort of erotic haze, his mind only half on what he was doing, while his body hummed with equal parts need and anticipation. When he was finally done, he didn’t waste any time at all in heading over to Steve to ‘offer him a ride back to the Tower’.
As soon as they were in the air, Tony switched their comms over to a private channel. “Just so we’re clear... you realize that you’re getting fucked within an inch of your life tonight, right?”
. I just don’t wanna miss it.” He amped up thrusters by one percent and his repulsor by three percent to keep stationary, knowing that it would increase the vibration. “Think you can make it back to the Tower before you lose it again?”
“How about we settle on agreeing that you owe me one instead?” Clint suggested. “And I’m not talking about Jimmy John’s or anything like that.” If he was going to be robbed of his Sandwich of Awesome™, he fully intended to make Stark pay for it.
“Like I’m ever gonna say no to you when you look at me like that,” Tony told him. “Go right ahead, baby. You do whatever you want. Call it a reward for being so good for me on the way home.”
Tony took a minute to reach out and grab the water bottle from the nightstand and take a drink, swishing it around briefly in his mouth before he put it back and started to ease his fingers free, but Steve whimpered and reached up to pull him down for a kiss. “Don’t,” he whispered against Tony’s mouth. “Like feeling full like this.”
Tony pulled up short into a hover position, then turned his attention to Steve. The HUD automatically read his vitals - heartbeat and breathing elevated, body temp climbing despite their elevation... “Shit. You’re already ready to go again, aren’t you?”
“Not tonight,” he teased. “Tonight’s definitely a ‘fuck Steve’ night.” But he put the suit in motion again, although maybe just a little bit slower than before. “Over and over again, until you’re begging me to stop because you just can’t take anymore.”
“A work of art,” Clint said mournfully, unable to tear his eyes away from the destruction. Goddammit, everyone knew Stark only ate to keep himself from starving! He couldn’t possibly appreciate the artistry that went into something like that!
