‘Maybe it’ll sort itself out,’ John continued to insist. ‘Lestrade’s had a big break with this child prostitution syndicate. Good of your brother to get me those files while a Yard DI was sitting right next to me.’
, John had directed. Yes. Adjusting a dial on the well-nestled surveillance box in the… lower bit of the dash thing (cars: irrelevant), he suddenly was inundated with the crunching of shoes on pebble and two sets of respirations (one slightly faster than usual, one steady).
John scooted forward, putting his left hand gently on Sherlock’s lower belly and curling up against his side. He felt Sherlock turn his head slightly so that his forehead met John’s. Their knees met through their respective clothes, huddled together like kids running away from home, gravitated towards the warmth of each other without intent or momentum. Maybe because he hadn’t slept since Thursday night — and, even then, he’d been kipping pretty uncomfortably at the hospital for days— or maybe because the tiny glow of light that crept under the door, around the blinds, gave the darkness a golden halo. He felt like time was slowing to a halt. Giving them a moment together, in a dream-spun version of reality inhabited by just them.
It was a good opera, as these things went. Sherlock had spied, John had prevented him from toppling unsubtly over a balcony, and the fat lady had sung (he thought, very well). No one had been shot or had a drink thrown in their face (onto what was probably a hideously expensive rented tux). He’d even liked the music enough to buy the CD (though the specky kid at the merchandise stall had looked pityingly at him and asked if he didn’t want to ‘download it for his tablet, with a digital booklet, for half the price?’). They had snogged the whole ride home. All in all, a successful evening.
‘Christ,’ John gulped. Melting back. Languorous. Even his eyes, closed, curved up along with his mouth as he sighed minutely (almost weak: ‘bowled over’, he might have described it. Or ‘well-shagged’).
, no wonder he killed himself, if this is the standard of artistic merit in this country!’, had earned him a slap from Mrs Hudson (of all people!) and a stony silence from John for almost three days. Only when he apologised to John and, in John’s presence, their landlady, had normal domestic relations resumed.
It had been the first hurdle of their relationship, and it had been a surprisingly big obstacle for Sherlock. People had often gotten close, drawn in by the (melo)drama, the amazement, the sublimity of real genius coupled with ‘crime-fighting’ (too many cop shows, too little understanding of motives or science or the accidental detritus criminals left behind). Yes, people had gotten close, but then, feline, Sherlock snapped, bristled, hissed, arched his back and scratched, and suddenly people remembered: they were dog-people. They liked cuddles and affection and, deep down yes, normality. Everyday life. Average.
,’ Sherlock purred, almost ravenous, and Christ if that wasn’t something that would always go straight to his cock.
A gambler, a doctor, a soldier, a writer, a younger brother, a self-denying sexually-masterful idealist with a penchant for the dark, the morbid, the difficult, the abnormal, and the chaotic: how little any of these epithets managed to say about the man standing before him, apparently vowing to spend not only his death but his
a highly intelligent parrot to distract Sherlock from taking John to bed. Unfortunately for Sherlock’s primary plan, that was exactly what the day had in store for them.
As you'll have noticed if you're following, chapters are posting on Tuesdays and Fridays. As a result, we'll have a whole new 1/12th of the show to wrangle with before Chapter 7 appears. *braces for impact*
‘I did have to fight him and a few other blokes off once they saw how you look freshly kissed,’ John deadpanned. ‘But this is just me seizing every opportunity to get you while I’m taller.’
After a while, when night had come on properly and the windows rattled every so often with a gentle shudder of autumn wind, he looked across to find Sherlock standing at the desk as he put away his bow.
) Even so, both the size and character traits gleaned from the short lived horse-racing endeavours, the decidedly-failed marriage, and, now, Suze’s account of her brief but tempestuous (and ultimately, probably literally, scarring) affair indicated that Gruener’s attentions were just that: brief; and thus that, whatever his involvement in the under-age human trafficking scheme, he was neither the main player nor even overly nostalgic or sentimental about the women (girls) he ‘collected’. Rather, he enjoyed the fleeting thrill of dominating them before returning to his more serious avocation of studying Dutch printing.
, he told himself, harder than he could remember being in his life, sense-memory anticipating the skintight hotslick grip of Sherlock around his cock, and he barely managed to hold his voice together when he asked,
‘I don’t,’ Christopher blurted, into John’s mouth, sucking his lips hungrily between words, ‘I — I don’t — ugh — I usually — I’m not —’
‘I can’t believe you, sometimes,’ John had admitted, whirlpool-blue-brown eyes squinting in the now-unguarded sunlight. His thumb had gone on caressing Sherlock’s palm from beneath, and Sherlock had shivered with the — the

The last thing he consciously thought of was the rise and fall of Sherlock’s chest beneath his fingers, over Sherlock’s newest scar.

, when John was meant to be on his way to the ice-chips machine and Sherlock was still not allowed to wear more than a hospital gown done up in bows at the back.
’S’me, Anne,’ he called, putting his mostly finished croissant and the rest of it on the recently-cleared worktop. Then he took himself for a proper scalding shower.
— he took a full step back, enough to remove himself from the places they were touching — he felt genuinely as though he’d been doused with freezing water. The intense, bitter taste of unfairness of that remark stole any words — touched a nerve he thought he’d stopped protecting. Because it had been Sherlock who had clearly flirted with him earlier, just as hungry for it as John was himself, like the razor-sharp energy during the final movement of the concert when the orchestra was moving towards a climax and Sherlock had brushed his thumb along the inside of John’s knee, making him stifle a groan. They (
‘Excuse my laughter, Mister Holmes… It is really very funny to see you trying to play a hand with no cards in it. I doubt that anyone could do it better, but it is pathetic all the same.’
‘Really! John!’ Her eyes darted back at the room for a moment. ‘He’s doing much better. You mustn’t forget yourself, you know.’
‘Yeah, I would,’ John admitted, chest tight, ‘but I’m not going to, because, whatever you’ve convinced yourself, it’s not actually always the best plan, breaking in to the offices of infamous criminals on the chance you’re
gifted to me by @Hamstermoon for the series. So unbelievably chuffed. [wanders away to blubber in a corner]*
‘“Complications,”’ repeated John, rubbish a finger (habit) over his right eyebrow, in the same flat, unimpressed tone. ‘Do you have any idea how lucky we’ve been?’ He shook his head, then swallowed. ‘Two bloody years wasn’t enough of a “complication” to make you consider that you are not in fact omnipotent?’
Standing before him now, Gruener opened a heavy brass (ornate, gold-gilded, well-polished) box and withdrew — because of course Sherlock’s reputation preceded him — a cigarette. He then removed a book of matches and antique silver humidor from the inner pocket of his close-fitting
‘After that, he wined and dined me, took me to all the best places and always wanted to pay — even took me to Prague, one weekend. Sorted everything for me — told me not to lift a finger, said he’d take care of it all. I thought,
Outside of a cartoon, he hadn’t known a person could blink as much or as quickly as Sherlock, dazed and possibly short-circuited, blinked at this suggestion.
, but god, it was true. The way he’d survived all the shitty three-night-stands he’d called girlfriends had been because he’d had Sherlock to come home to. Paris with Mary had been a disaster not because of her driving or his rubbish French or even the fact that, as it turned out, she’d secretly been a casual-hours gun-for-hire. From day one, leaving his bedsit, even when he and Sherlock had fought or hurt each other or pretended it was anything but what it was… He made himself say it. ‘The only thing I need, not to be lonely for the rest of my mad, screwed up life – is you.’
was the connection between the Countess of Morcar and the H. Baker who had purchased a jewel-laden parrot in Bloomsbury? How did Ryder – if indeed he was correct it was Ryder (he was 85% sure) – steal the carbuncle only to lose it? Was Baker his confederate, hoping to traffic the bird out of town – but no, he had
Flexing his hand, John seemed to be struggling to put into words something deeply uncomfortable. ‘I just… I spent a long time wanting this — wanting a whole life with someone — but not knowing I could have it, with you. And now that I do…’
The inspector, a bulky, slightly rotund officer who reminded John of a particularly generous army cook who had once pulverised him in a drunken wrestling match, judiciously chose to ignore Sherlock. ‘Constable, if y’please, get us whatever our friend Mr Holmes requires.’
Sherlock insisting on being at all times. There was no way to conjure up the explosion, numbing, thrilling, terrifying, invigorating all at once, that he was.
After a moment, Sherlock resolved or muted whatever cacophony of deductions were reverberating inside his head.
‘Nothing,’ replied Sherlock instantly, but his weight shifted to his other foot; John thought unbidden of an angry crow he’d seen in the park ruffling its feathers haughtily as it landed on and then promptly took off from a wad of chewing gum.
For a second he kept his eyes shut and simply kissed him, savouring the fraction of his life where he didn’t ache for wondering what that mouth was good for if not insulting or sneering at him because, oh, he knew now and was not going to be able to forget –
‘I understand if…’ Sherlock swallowed thickly, and John watched him from beneath heavy eyelashes. ‘I can appreciate that this is no longer sufficient. Needless to say, you can have a great deal more from someone else, as we have always known, so if you would prefer to end our current situation, we can… go back. To the previous arrangement.’
‘God, you’re unbelievable,’ John rasped, coming up for air, which cut jaggedly into Sherlock’s breathing because he knew that, he

What we could – become. I don’t need all of that stuff you just said. I know you think I do,’ he hurried to say, while Sherlock huffed disbelievingly, ‘but I’m here to tell you, I don’t. And I can tell you, if it changes.’
defending ‘national industry’, and how much teasing he would have been in for on the cab ride home; the absence of the sound grated worse than St Clair’s shouting.
‘I did not know,’ Sherlock growled, audibly bristling with pride, ‘I had not seen her picture, I had instructed my brother not to provide me with any more information than was necessary, which evidently meant in his
‘Stop,’ Sherlock commanded again, and John’s mouth snapped shut. Sherlock’s chest swelled and fell several times before he finally spoke. ‘John… I wanted to thank you for your help with the case today. And your concern for…’ he paused, ‘my shoe. But you… you have undergone a certain degree of unusually high stress in the past twenty-four hours, in addition to running on very little sleep, and if –’
him with such heady, overwhelming confidence that Sherlock had been powerless to hold anything back, even had he wanted to. (Which, of course, he didn’t.)
John resisted for a moment, because it would be easy to pretend — for now, or forever, even — that he’d been winding Sherlock up. The whole reason John refused to speak to reporters, didn’t discuss Sherlock and him with his mates, bristled and, all right, lashed out a bit when people
Lady Morcar’s eyes sparkled, and he ate the last bite of his lunch with what was probably a stupefied, boyish smile on his face.
Sherlock was currently reading the stack of newspapers all celebrating or reporting his ‘scrape with death’ after the ‘vicious attack’ from, apparently, a ‘jealous lover’ who was a ‘furious ex-wife of client’ and somehow also ‘criminal mastermind Moriarty’s henchman’ all rolled into one.
‘You say “us”, Sir James,’ John wondered aloud, drawing full attention to himself for the first time in several minutes. ‘“Our crisis”? Who do you mean?’
The astonishingly basic difference between sex with a woman and sex with a man was how miraculous the female body was at expanding, wet and open and so warm —  it defied all modern technological advances in laser sensors and camera-assisted remote surgery — with just the stimulus of time and arousal. Lube was fantastic but
He re-emerged from his thoughts back to hear Sgt. Challa talking to John. ‘… and then I saw a man running away from the scene – it looked like some kids had tried to mug him, but I by the time I got there, he was off in one direction and the boys had disappeared in the other. And then I saw, erm, her on the street, almost in a puddle, and I figured–’
A body on a slab — his body — his pallid face, his bared chest — hovers between them, begging to be deduced. A gash, only two or so inches across, cleaned up here for examination but with ugly edges, depth obscured at the surface level, catches his diffuse attention.
With a glazed look, she mused, ‘I had a friend, though, Lorna. Her parents — well, her dad — made her and her sister do all of their schoolwork ahead of time, not after he went to bed or before he was awake, and always in another room. From him.’
‘I’d hardly call that organised, John,’ Sherlock rejoined, before dropping his hand to his own cock which was pressed against John’s cock, ‘you don’t even have a system for –’
Sherlock had risen to his feet, leaving a hand available with which Fred could present his ears for ruffling. ‘Very good.’
Her reddened brown eyes — far from flat or dead — studied him for a long, yearning second. ‘I don’t think I believe in justice any more. But it’s nice to meet somebody who still does.’
, all those other people were better off, and John knew in his bones that if this thing with Sherlock broke that they’d both have to live with the fact that there were future cases, future

) was ‘no longer a threat’, and that he ‘shouldn’t worry’. Sherlock had been so voraciously focussed on the wonder that was John Watson that he hadn’t chased down the trail before it was (almost certainly) expertly washed away with military-strength, MI6-funded bleach.
until they were deep and wrinkled and softer still. Instead he held his position, breath suddenly trapped in his chest, while Sherlock looked beyond him, then answered, in a voice frayed at the edges but so familiar,
‘If you wish it, I shall do so,’ she conceded diplomatically. ‘And of course,’ she turned and picked a sealed envelope off the side-table to her left, ‘my gratitude has more direct implications for yourselves.’
‘I’m not stupid,’ he pleas, feeling eleven again, because the pain in his chest is gaining momentum, shaking the fibres of him at the epicentre and radiating outwards, hot where the rest of him is growing chilled by the second, lonely, dim… reducing him from himself to someone else, someone whose body gets found in the morning and identified in the same morgue where he’s already seen it, laid out, death-white, still.
Halfway to his wardrobe, however, he found his attention drawn to the perfectly made-up bed (military training: ever the soldier) which nevertheless failed entirely to make him forget John’s words.
Sherlock’s hot breath gulped and gasped, his nose dug into John’s shoulder. John could imagine the riots of sweat-drenched curls, matted to Sherlock’s forehead where it was sticking to the nape of John’s sweat-clammy neck, tickling his skin with each cant of Sherlock’s hips —
‘So you think a man who killed his wife —’ John cut in, hand poised over his glass as if preparing to use it as a projectile, ‘a man who runs a human trafficking ring in
‘When?’ he demanded, his voice like the familiar subterranean rumble of the tube as heard from right here in John’s bed on those quietest London nights. His eyes darted around the room unseeing, then back to John with a dark look. ‘Who reported it?’ A pause. ‘And the assistant says she – I don’t care about a
‘William Sherlock Scott Holmes,’ John whispered, his nose brushing Sherlock’s, voice firm and sure, ‘
But he had rushed in too deep to this game before, a catastrophic mistake he was in no hurry to repeat. One Moriarty was enough for a lifetime.
In pearls, a no doubt cashmere vermilion cardigan (the same vivid red shade, he couldn’t help thinking, of Flint and Ovid’s tails), and plain black trousers, the Countess was as stunning in dinner-for-one attire as in her entertaining clothes of the afternoon. ‘Dr. Watson. Some news, I take it?’ She eyed him curiously.
John wanted to hear about her, but Sherlock he could push a little longer and determine that for himself.
Rational responses all seemed to come up short, none fitted quite right, too many caveats or qualifications, too glib or too literal (John almost certainly would appreciate neither), so he nodded instead.
.’ The intense gravity of Billy’s usually flippant voice, his unblinking stare under heavily hooded (chronically inflamed) eyelids, his stillness as though chilled from his usually fidgety, incessant movement — this from a man who had spent the better part of his adult life on the street, or thereabouts — indicated in concert that Sherlock ought to reconsider the seriousness of his investigation. His mind erupted with fresh questions all clamouring for primacy.
He woke up in a warm, dry bed. Something next to him beeped softly. Confusion gave way after a few seconds. He was in a hospital. Understandable, after his… adventure.
John found an effective way to fight his chronic insomnia for years, and with all ruthlessness, he used this knowledge deliberately. And it was not even about anal sex or oral sex. These were very pleasant pretexts for proximity, physical contact, which from the moment he returned, he needed like air to live. He observed that John slept much better and deeper, feeling his presence right beside him.
He felt uncomfortable. Mycroft had always acted alone, had probably prepared several scenarios and a number of skilled professionals waiting for his order. He did not need advice and help from an ordinary military doctor who wrote a blog.
He had not spent too much time in Britain, focusing his attention on the sunny Italy. But now he preferred to steer clear of that country. Too many memories - good and bad. Perhaps someday, he would show Will his favourite places, unknown to ordinary tourists w=ith guided paths.
topics. Sherlock exceptionally did not press on and tried to fathom the strength of the case. He didn't even know what make him more restrained in that regard - the prospect of inevitably hurting his partner or his own fear and helplessness of the terrors he would be told.
He did not want to create an unnecessary wall between them. That would arouse contempt from the first glance, and he very well knew it.
Something stung him in the neck. He guessed that it was a hypnotic drug again. Which one, then, of the many he'd been given the last few hours? He heard Sherlock's voice faltering as he counted down the seconds to the shot. The fast-acting sedative ingredient caused him an unbearable feeling of unrealistic bliss. He fought to stay awake, but had no strength.
On that thought, he felt like a schoolboy trying to hide his antics. Well, Mummy was currently resting in Scotland and did not pay much attention to what was happening outside of her small residence. He did not want her to get too worried over little things.
"My brother's an idiot, although he has a huge opinion of himself. The mission was successful overseas?" The detective's fingers quickly coped with the resistant zipper jacket.
‘Course, yeah,’ said John, remembering not much more than being furious with Sherlock for chasing away his date, and getting shitfaced in order to be able to stop looking at Sherlock all evening with a simmering, itching fury. (In retrospect, the drinking had also come after John, finding himself tuning out of a conversation with one of Molly’s fellow lab techs, a perfectly decent (if geeky) lad, had happened to look away and be bowled over with the sudden curious thought — clear and fully-formed, as though someone stood beside him had muttered the suggestion in his ear — of how Sherlock would look if John had shoved him into a corner and bitten at his neck until his knees buckled.) (Turned out: he looked, tasted,
shut behind him — he was wide awake. He felt keyed up, itching to drive fast and take screeching turns, to gamble (he’d missed Sunday’s poker game with his unit), to go say ‘fuck you’ to his heredity and get blind drunk and prove that he didn’t need a family as much as he needed to feel pride in his work, and maybe himself. But not tonight.
‘Taxi!’ John called, because the angels were looking over his shoulder (however improbably) and despite the fact he didn’t have the money for this any more than for five drinks and a nod for the bartender, he wasn’t
‘I don’t bottom,’ John had enough wit to say honestly, while his fingers coaxed a twitch from beneath dark denim fabric. ‘Is that a problem.’
There was then a companionable silence, a pause of mutual agreement; that we were both silly men, that we ought to put off more reading and instead partake of a mild afternoon with no cases, no patients, no black moods to attend to. At last Holmes set his pipe on the resting dish on the table before us.
They dated for three months before, feeling awkward after that bad weekend in Paris, he had ducked into a jewellery shop in early March. For days he’d carried it around in his coat.
She snickered, ‘Come on, John, look at his jacket: bullet-proof. He’ll be fine.’ She hadn’t blinked, it seemed, in ages, eyes trained –
‘“All right” what?’ he said, gracelessly. His shirt felt starch-stiff across his back, sticking to his skin, ill-fitting.
For the second time in as many days, John found himself having just uttered words of what felt like incriminating, deceptive intimacy. Molly had gone still.

‘Not like swallowing legal papers,’ he had gone on, looking anything but solemn. ‘Bloody dry enough to make anyone choke.’
‘Go on,’ he nodded bracingly after a moment. ‘And — if you’re looking to let off some steam — I’ve got a rugby squad that’s looking for a forward. Bet you could take a bunch of scrawny medical students for their money?’
He didn’t want to read between the lines, he really didn’t, but something about her practiced, dismissive attitude drew attention to itself.
‘Somebody who’s going to going to learn all the crap you had to memorise about morbid pornography?’ John conjectured, tone laced with sarcasm.

No. 113, John already knew, was a nondescript electronics shop, fitted in between a fairly dingy florist on its left and an indisputably dingy off-license on its right. As they approached it, Sherlock radiated his familiar brand of smooth invisibility, warding off wondering eyes with the sense that he both wasn’t there and that he might be there all the time. But something was off.
‘Whatever he’s got on you,’ he said, dropping his character and speaking as he did to the distressed and the desperate who came through their door, ‘whatever you’ve done — I can help you.’
‘Be fair, a four, at least.’ He examined in near-microscopic detail the bridge of John’s nose, the creases around his (wet) upturned mouth. ‘And I won’t be wearing a cape, for god’s sake.’
‘Call came in twenty minutes ago.’ Greg’s voice, stained with concern that John could not afford right now, seemed to be calling from a million miles away. ‘Chest wound, he must have got in a fight — I’m not sure exactly what…’
Unable to keep his own hideous thoughts to himself tonight, Sherlock put his laptop aside and (gingerly) got to his feet. ‘John, you are addicted to a certain… lifestyle.’
John’s expression immediately coalesced into understanding, which was so infuriating that Sherlock fleetingly considered shouting and storming out (was that reaction now solely acceptable when John did it?). He bit down the impulse, squirmed, hating the slithering, too-soft, too-silky, merlot-coloured dressing gown; his long hair curling and wisping where it most needed to be cut; the distant rumble of hunger in his gut,
John put up a hand, ‘No, for Christ’s sake, STOP. I draw the line at deducing when our friends are menstruating.’
The unbidden urge to kiss John perilously breathless erupted in his mind, so vivid with sense-memory he could feel the phantom impressions of such a meeting on his skin and clothing.
She turned her bright, intense gaze toward him, and he felt instantly that she was the sort of woman who got what she wanted, through sheer force of personality rather than tricks or ploys. And her cheekbones…
to want anything more… role-play-y in the bedroom: he was mostly nonverbal and entirely, adorably serious throughout all the sex they’d had so far. And John, though he’d tried a bit of it in the past, allowed himself out on the limb of assuming he had read Sherlock’s timid innuendo correctly:
Again, John was sure — well, he’d have to wait until they were alone so he could confer with Sherlock — but his instinct told him that there was something, if possible, worse, and it was to do with her knowing about the ‘notes’ in question.
‘Oh gosh! It’s Doctor, isn’t it! How rude of me!’ she trilled, throwing a manicured hand to his bicep.
John was frowning deeply, a guarded hurt in his eyes that Sherlock had only recently stopped seeing. ‘Just here to brighten up our day, Mycroft?’ he asked curtly.
, as an affluent woman, who is accustomed to getting what she wants – in this case, a rare form of anatomically-correct pornographic art. He needs to believe you are worth his time, but he will be more inclined to show-off for you – which is, I must stress
‘Oh,’ said Sherlock simply, his nose pressing into John’s cheek as he breathing hitched. John, unsure how long he himself could go on, arranged Sherlock’s low hips forward to force their cocks to slot together, this time hot and skin-tight. When he flailed wildly for his bedside, Sherlock pulled his face back an inch to examine John’s, which began to say, ‘I’ve got –’ before he interrupted, ‘Yes, of course,’ and spread his long arm to rummage in the nightstand until he found the bottle beneath John’s spare notepad.
Shoving these nauseating suppositions away, Sherlock swiftly yanked plastic ties around two sets of hands, another around AGRA’s feet, then (certain they were tight enough – if that was possible –) sprinted across the room and knelt at John’s side. ‘There’s a studio, off the hall – his workshop, certainly gloves. There should be a sink as well, a kit –’
Sherlock examined him despairingly. ‘A hotel employee with full access to all floors, who looks like, in Cusack’s words, “the sort of man who never has a life and simply shouldn’t try”?’ He frowned.
Upon this summa, I allowed my voice to linger, appreciating — as evidently I had done, so distractingly, a short time earlier — the spirit and aspirations of the final lines.
Before he could stop himself, Sherlock said, though it mattered to no one at all, ‘Ovid is male, John.’
He looked at Sherlock’s face properly for the first time in almost eleven hours, since they’d wheeled him out of the operating theatre and on a trolley-bed down the corridor past John, insisting (while preventing him from following) that he could see him once he was settled in a room. One lock of hair was stuck to his forehead, an inky
Immediately, Sherlock moved away from John and glided gracefully out the front door. Closing his eyes, John took a moment to breathe. He needed to stifle whatever bitter retort had welled up in his throat at being treated like he’d rolled in a dog turd. But of course, he had years of training, military and Holmesian, which had taught him to hold his peace until either asked or necessitated by danger.
Sherlock would wake him in the night to demand to know what all this sudden (really rather astoundingly good) sex ‘meant’, nor had he had really been
Rushing, the door slammed behind him in the air vacuum of the draught — he winced guiltily as he marched towards the station, hoping it hadn’t woken Mrs Hudson. The peevish hope nevertheless rose in his mind that maybe Sherlock (who, for all his muttering about never needing sleep, staying up all night doing god knew what researching Ming vases or ancient porn or Austrian horse racing, had fallen asleep on the sofa instead of
Sherlock, as it happened, had continued to deny snoring ever since John had first woken to it, more than a month ago now. ‘Deny’ was probably too light a term: ‘outright denounce the possibility of, at an increasing volume’ probably hit closer to the mark. But years of playing the role of teasing annoying little brother were not wasted on John, nor was the time-honoured British pastime of taking the piss out of a fellow soldier. For a week, he’d hidden nose strips in Sherlock’s nightstand, mentioned in Mrs Hudson’s hearing that Sherlock might need an herbal soother for his post-nasal drip, even renamed Sherlock in his phone with the little yellow symbol of the nose. Sherlock’s face when John had begun typing a blog post describing Sherlock’s snores and snuffles in the moments before a bomb explosion at a stakeout (a true story) had been so hilariously furious that John had spent the rest of that afternoon forgetting and remembering it by turns with giggles under his breath. Sherlock had, naturally, retaliated with the entirely anticipated jibes about the size of John’s own nose — but of course he was about thirty years too late for that one to sting. Once again, John considered the fact that a peevish Sherlock resembled nothing so much as the disgruntled ravens at the Tower of London, or maybe the squawking parrot John had had to prevent Sherlock from keeping, because
’Your sister wants to meet for a meal,’ Sherlock deduced breezily, plopping down into his chair. ‘You don’t. You’ll have a miserable time, as you well know: you’ll come home disappointed and upset. Yet you persist, out of a misplaced belief that “good people” are close with their blood relations, even when said relations consistently refuse to respect anything that matters to
It was, John reckoned as another patient sat down across from him, a lot like being a doctor: the ability to switch on and off, with decent success, any erotic interest in another body. Much though he had been thrumming all the previous day with the itch to stand that certain way next to Sherlock, to weave their fingers together and kiss slowly and pull each other together and apart until they lost track of everything else, this morning he had felt only brisk, watchful concern. He’d considered begging off surgery duties for today. Not that either of them were especially good at talking, but he knew that on occasion when Sherlock was rattled he flitted around the flat, impatient and needing a ballast. But this morning Sherlock had proclaimed his intention to venture to the British Library for further research, so John had decided there was no point hovering and making things worse.
Sherlock shut his eyes, pressed himself closer in every place until they were entangled completely, and John didn’t need to hear him say it to know it was true for him too.
‘Yes,’ she admits, bright blue eyes frank and open and suddenly—briefly, he knows—clouded with the faint memory of past unhappiness. ‘He yewwed at me and he hurt my arm!’ She thrusts it out towards him for inspection.
‘HA!’ John had scoffed, face smarting with unconcealed fury. (With Sherlock himself? Or with the admittedly ludicrous suggestion that he remain behind?) ‘That’s not — absolutely
John stayed by his side for the whole ten days. When he left the room, it was either to give Sherlock privacy for a sponge-bath (nonsense: John had seen him naked; yet Sherlock could not help but appreciate it) or to collect food from the (miserably bland) cantine (though Molly had, true to form, been far more successful at sneaking several kinds of takeaway into their room under the aromal misdirection of more flowers). New clothes appeared for him (Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft) regularly; he used the en-suite, despite the fact that a proper nurse’s station shower was offered to him (only after-hours, so none of the other patients would request such a suspension of normal procedure; Sherlock, when John finally helped him — having removed his bandages — into the shower on the eighth day, was not even given another option); John repeatedly ignored calls from his sister, but took them from Lestrade, his supervisor at the surgery (to say he’d ‘had a personal emergency’: Sherlock’s lip-reading was perpetually crucial), and even from the publisher for whom he was now contracted to write his book. This last was a call extending more than ten minutes, going over the reasons John would not be making his first editorial meeting and the ways he could get his manuscript into a viable form before the now-delayed next appointment. Their laptops appeared shortly after this conversation (Mycroft).
to debase himself to.  ‘I’m not some sex-crazed bastard. I haven’t ever forced anything on anyone, least of all you. Now, I’m going to bed. Goodnight. And if and when I want something, for the record?
John was sitting back in one of the partners’ chairs, arms across his chest. His belly jumped as he snorted. ‘He’d notice, Sherlock.’
(One more deduction there than he’d been expecting. He made a mental note to send a gift around the middle of April.)
‘Oh honestly!’ Mrs. Hudson exclaimed. ‘It isn’t all that bad!’ When the parrot had concluded her noise and went back to sporadic peeps, Mrs. Hudson made to leave, patting John’s arm as she went. She did a lot of patting. ‘Do let me know what you decide about the bird, won’t you?’
An enormous smile broke across John’s face, crinkling his eyes, and he never wanted anything more in his entire life than to stay, exactly here, suspended in the amber streetlight like an insect.
‘Dreadful business,’ continued Sir James. ‘Ah, yes, thank you. Milk, no sugar, if you can,’ he directed to John, who was at the partners desk handling tea. (Their roles, all three of them, were easy to fill. And of course John had gone for the chipped mug before realising Mycroft wasn’t staying.) Damery had settled into their high-armed sofa with grace, so his discomfort was rather with the matter at hand.
Sherlock sat (a clean — well… — distance away from them), leaving enough room for John just where the bench extended beyond the length of the table: easy to go on conversing with those standing by the table’s edge, as well as to run unimpeded from the scene, should the need arise. (The need was certainly arising for Sherlock with each passing minute.)
) interesting case that came to their door, it was something of a satisfaction to know that he could be involved in the unraveling of more serious crimes than simple ones of passion or greed. Gruener, more than most, would not enjoy prison; John would categorise this under the heading of 'justice'.
Now John snorted. (Beneath that, though, his leg was buzzing slightly, a (nervous? distracted? psychosomatic?) habit he seldom exhibited (not for years, not since the very beginning).)
‘Sherlock, we don’t have to do this now, or ever, if you don’t want. I’m more than happy to snog for the rest of the morning. But you’ve got to give me a little more to go on than a grunt.’
She went over to the bed and leaned down to kiss him, patting him softly on the other cheek, and John had to look away. So many people giving in, spoiling the man rotten, trying to care for him in any way possible… John wondered for how long after Sherlock’s death Mrs. Hudson had continued taking him his morning tea — whether she’d drunk it, or left it for his ghost. If she’d ever blinked and found the cup smashed, milky tea sloshed all over the broken china at her feet, and wondered how it got there.
But, in the here and now, Sherlock was breathing — even talking in his sleep about pirates and dogs and moustaches —, and thus John was free to fight like hell. He just hoped he wouldn’t have to keep fighting Sherlock.
, tell Bradstreet we’ll come round to see for ourselves in the morning.’ He jabbed the screen before tossing the mobile blindly to land wherever it might on John’s floor. (One of these days one of them was going to break a phone, the way they treated them.) Without preamble he crashed his mouth back into John’s.
what he’s like, Mr. Holmes. Sucking in all the parts of you that know how to fight back until you’re… you’re too exhausted.’
‘It’s not like it is in the movies,’ says a familiar voice in his ear — all medical rationality, morbid knowledge — ‘there’s not a great big spurt of blood, no choking on your own bile.’
.’); and finally the matter of his victims, a question not only of ‘perspective’ but… the word itself flashed in his mind… SCALE
After six months or so, the chain on which the stone hung seemed to be shorter, stuck at a length just around his middle. When he walked, every step swung a deep bruising
Surely, all too soon, he would be balancing equations and composing and drafting scenarios of crimes they should be chasing mid-coitus, because his body craved John at all times, even when the abstract thought of it disgusted him. A contradiction no one but himself should be forced to live with. Already today, he had been unforgivably distracted from working to take down a monster of a criminal by the thought of John’s hands wrapped around his body. (What if, someday, he didn’t remember to say John’s name?)
Much later (possibly), he felt the tug of the sheet underneath him as someone — still John? Interesting — tucked their knees up to
There was something unnameable, something more precious than John was prepared to handle just now, about a Sherlock, curls still wet and cashmere socks but no shoes on his feet, passed out from sheer, natural tiredness. He’d managed, consciously or unconsciously, to lie flat, avoiding the possibility of doing damage to his still-healing abdomen; at the moment, the taut, olive green shirt rising and falling minutely concealed everything but the crest of his collarbone and the hollows of his wrists.
But still, he thought as he paced through a sickeningly posh part of town, he needed something else. Something he got from the shadowy look in Sherlock’s eyes just before either of them turned in for the night, when he knew he didn’t know what the next day would bring, except that it would unquestionably involve the two of them.
Sherlock feigned interest. ‘Only if you go to the West End with Mycroft and my parents at Christmas.’
With an eye-roll of profound impatience, Sherlock waved his hands in the air, ‘I heard every massacred ‘d’ and ’t’ that died on her tongue —’
But… he went through his mental calendar: that must have been only, what? Three days before Sherlock had shown up? Stiff-limbed and exhausted, Sherlock had made his grand re-entry into John’s world, 26 months and eight days after he’d died, and any thought of rings or other lives had been shoved violently, joyfully from John’s mind. They had gone back to Baker Street, caught up in a case (but, more deeply, in each other) and he’d barely wanted to sleep or even breathe at the wrong moment for fear it would all come crashing down. He’d been too numb even to be relieved not to have to invent a fake reason to end it with his sort of-fiancée/soon-to-be-not girlfriend. His mind (his heart (his bed)) had been too full of Sherlock to give much space to anyone else.
‘Doubt it,’ replied John, both because, well, he did, and because his scepticism sometimes was enough to dissuade Sherlock from a dead-end. ‘It’d always be getting ripped or greasy from fingers. And anyway, he doesn’t seem like the type that would want to have newspaper ink all over him.’
proportional to its amusements. ‘What if you accidentally leaked information! A member of the upper echelons of government, no less. Perish the thought!’
Returning from his Mind Palace to the sitting room wall, Sherlock reflected that he was glad this case had come in. Whatever his renewed commitment to taking seriously the problems of any (even
By now, the scars across his lower abdomen and back were an open, undiscussed secret between them — it would have been impossible to keep them hidden without disappointing and/or offending John, who valued (though, or for precisely that reason, held in suspicion) trust and vulnerability, who wanted to know everything he didn’t know already about Sherlock’s 797 day time ‘away’. So Sherlock kept them hidden whenever possible, even from John, even though the damage was in every sense done. But he could at least give this to him, however much uncertainty was mixed with his (incalculable) other responses.
They climbed in, Sherlock into the driver’s seat, and John in the back beside Molly. Once the lumbar adjustments were made, Sherlock pulled the tight woollen cap over his hair, containing all of it, and making a radical departure from his usual appearance. Which was, of course, the point.
.) ‘Difficult spot for you to see, granted. And it’s faint, too. I’m not surprised you haven’t noticed. But it is there.’
John had – had held him, gently. Had murmured clichés and then had laughed his high ridiculous laugh,
Now, though, based on the simmering tension in Sherlock’s shoulders after what John’d whispered to him just before the second half (fuelled by whisky and the lingering obscene scent of Sherlock on his fingers), they were both impossibly keyed up. He could not be arsed if the entire street — if the entire
‘I’ve heard all of this before,’ she deflected without emotion. ‘Heinrich cannot possibly be accused for every person who overdoses in every city he’s ever been to.’
, his mum would have said. He smiled fondly at this, looking at Sherlock again and appreciating that, whatever the answer to his question, Sherlock really did seem to want this, and him.
‘I’m very grateful to you both for agreeing to meet me,’ Damery confessed with perfunctory civility and — surprisingly — a genuine hint of relief.
Sherlock smiled in return, hoping to encourage Billy to disclose just a bit more of the knowledge churning behind his scraggly, shadow-carved face. He waited.
Taking up a pen, Sherlock scripted a phrase he expected Henry Baker would welcome, and handed it to John. He watched John’s dark eyes read the sentence, then lift to peer accusingly at him. ‘Really.’
On the bed, in a fresh dress shirt and clean, straight-off-the-dry-cleaner’s hanger trousers, Sherlock was lying, asleep.
‘Sherlock,’ he growled, left fingers ungripping the pillow to splay over Sherlock’s ribs in soft counterpoint to the rough obscene slaps of their sticky skin. He was close, could go over at any minute if he left himself, and he wanted to get Sherlock there too, to give in to the feedback loop of pleasure that Sherlock’s moans gave him, so he slid his hand down beneath Sherlock’s ribs and found his cock, a forgotten ache, immediately so rock-hard that Sherlock shouted in surprise and frustration, riding John’s angled thrust that pummeled his prostate to push himself into John’s fist, only twice, until he came with a long groan that, in a matter of seconds, triggered John’s hiss and a stream of words shuddering into white noise…
He immersed himself in online reading until the first parcels arrived, shoving into oblivion the obscene scent still clinging to his own fingertips.
The dip of the bed behind him nudged his focus back to the lamp-lit room. (Basil, peanut sauce, chicken (all consumed); generic dish soap; foot/sweat/faintly damp cotton odour.)
for his peace of mind. Instead, he turned the page and moved on to a section on — joy of joys — paperwork.
‘I repeat, I was always intending to come back.’ But John’s body language presented only a studied, grounded intractability, giving nothing away. Sherlock had followed him into the sitting room, defiantly
Years of his life had gone by in which John had wondered, really painfully wondered, if he could tell when Sherlock cared and when he was shamming — when he was speaking from the heart and when he just sounded like it. This, John knew, looking at Sherlock illuminated by the lowest angle of daylight, just as cars were beginning to think of headlamps and traffic and their tea waiting at home — this was the real kind. Sherlock trusted Molly; had trusted her (and John had to swallow the thick air in his throat as he thought of it) when he had trusted almost no one else, not even John. (What had gone on between them? John thought of Molly like a co-worker, or a middling cousin, the sort of person he’d always stop to check on if he saw them in the street, but might not remember to text or see for months together. But Molly and Sherlock shared something: treated each other differently, since Moriarty.)
‘I…’ This was, for some reason I could not then yet fathom, of some important to him: a matter of confusion; a misapprehension he wished not merely to correct, but to forestall repeating. ‘I suppose I did find his account of the unruly book, breaking free to interrupt the absorbed reader like an infant wresting free of its nurse, rather comical — but as much truth as humour in that. It has happened to me a hundred times, at least. And at least a hundred more times, I have seen you draping all manner of things, pipettes and your favourite magnifying glass, your own scarves — all sorts of objects! — over the haphazard
Sherlock blinked at the screen for a moment, then handed the phone back. ‘Surely you haven’t forgotten how to read?’
Well. The solutions were supposed to be at room temperature — indeed, overnight testing might provide additional data. He removed and stowed away the phials, tubes, and slides, switched off the light, and made his way to the sofa (careful to cross as quickly as possible in front of the screen), then sat (with the tiniest residual flip of his stomach at allowing the impulse of this to be acted upon) in the space at John’s side, beneath where John’s right arm was resting across the back cushion.
Even after the dust had more or less settled after their argument, the rest of the evening had buzzed with the kind of contrite intimacy they sometimes achieved after a fight in which they’d both gone further than they intended. John still rankled at the bits that had got swept half-way under the rug (namely, that Sherlock had once again withheld something — a Mary-shaped something — from him) by the need to reassure Sherlock,
‘Then follow your deductions through!’ Sherlock urged harshly, and John gripped the cool tile basin of the sink so hard with wet hands he felt in danger of slipping and knocking out his own teeth. ‘I did not know, definitively, that your former…’ he waved his hand in John’s peripheral vision, ‘… partner was involved when you went in. I quickly realised, however, that there was very little reason – in fact a staggering amount to the oppose the idea – of sending you accompanied by only
‘Is this a joke the two of you have agreed on?’ Sherlock squinted, no doubt deducing their morning activities without him.
GOD ABOVE, I will have no problem whatsoever with telling your brother to take over this case if it means you will actually give yourself time to get well!’
Another kiss, more, lingering, narcotic, blissfully slow. (For himself, he would have been content to do little else for the next several hours but continue to breathe in and out, bodies fusing slowly until he could not expand his lungs without crowding space occupied by John’s heaving chest… But, as expected:)
He drank two, resisting the jolting desire to hurl the glass against the long bar mirror, to witness the shattered faces reflecting at him, gone hushed with shock and horror, at the madman who might jump over the counter, who might then begin flinging bottles of everything they’d got to the ground until the floor resembled an icy-sharded pool of amber.
With a pinched look, Sherlock peered condescendingly through his fringe at John. Bradstreet stopped mid-sentence several steps below.
of this moment sent a chill down Sherlock’s spine that had nothing to do with riot of cries and chaos around them. John’s expression… Sherlock couldn’t fathom, couldn’t parse the shadow, the sudden flare of
‘Mmm,’ Molly allowed. ‘And it’s not, well… not microscope slides or anything fragile like that: not exactly sexy to make the person you’re trying to sleep with stare into a microscope.’ (John took a moment to admit to himself that the image of Sherlock hunched over a microscope, dexterous hands wheeling the lenses about, absurd skin illuminated by the light underneath the platform, did plenty for him. But he took her point.)
Not to mention, he didn’t like the picture Sherlock presented of him: a trigger-happy danger addict? He didn’t want to be like that — not completely, not forever.  What if someday he looked back and wished for the kinds of things normal people wanted: a house in a village, a dog, some stroppy kids to make you really feel your age, a proper job and a proper bedtime? Was this life with Sherlock (was
‘But what about you, dear?’ she asked, peering into his eyes with concern. ‘Won’t you come home and sleep — just for a bit? And I wouldn’t mind staying so you wouldn’t worry. Or Molly could do it! That girl keeps odd hours, I’m sure she could pop by for the night. You look done in. It’s not good for you to sleep in a
, Sherlock intoned to himself. Why else would John (still in his (tented) pants) have positioned himself on top when in most previous situations he was perfectly comfortable to lie anywhere? Why else would he have bothered to brush his teeth and wash himself, return to bed, inform Sherlock as though calming a skittish colt… (Sentiment; ‘ethics’; consideration.) John’s intentions (desires) broadcast in a thousand small tells he didn’t bother to hide.)
He had almost asked, for the first time in his life, for them to turn the volume of the EKG monitor on.
Though she was smiling brightly at him, the strain behind it was evident — and not just for being teased about her upbringing. Everything from the grip of her long orange talons of nails to her crossed, plum-coloured jeans to the thick, animal print jacket she had zipped up all the way to her chin (she was probably boiling) screamed of someone fiercely putting on a brave face but all the while scared for her life.
‘An assassin.’ He crossed his arms and shifted his weight back; managed to sound in control, at least.
— He’d stumbled across the diagnosis (a disorder: a condition) years ago, possibly when he was in the final stages of dissolving his ties with Victor, wondering dimly if this confirmed what he had always implicitly assumed: that he didn’t feel things the same way as other people; that their cues were impenetrable to him, and their insistence on social patterns of behaviour when so clearly that was an
‘For that matter,’ Sherlock went on, to spare him, ‘we could cut off both our siblings. Better to simply rely on Mrs. Hudson and Gordon for our Christmas gifts in future.’
‘That isn’t how you would spend the rest of your life,’ Sherlock informed him. He was aware, hyper-aware, that his matter-of-fact tone with respect to John’s feelings and actions had more than once recently gotten him into dangerous waters. Nevertheless, he felt strongly that this time they were pushing each other in the same direction.
Sherlock had made into the mattress, the feeling of that once-forbidden zone just below Sherlock’s navel, warm and sensitive beneath John’s fingertips, of his knees forcing Sherlock’s thick, fur-hair-smattered thighs wider apart, the press of Sherlock to his chest afterwards, so close, heart almost visibly heavy in his eyes, that John had felt — truly, though not for the first time since they’d first kissed and turned his world upside down (yet again) — that maybe they were more than fooling around, more than some romantic dream in his writerly imagination. Maybe they really were meant to be
‘This,’ John concluded, more quietly, but he couldn’t stop himself, he felt one last thing in his throat, needing to be said, ‘isn’t going anywhere. I’m going to be angry sometimes, and I’m sorry about that, but it doesn’t actually change anything. I don’t know how else to convince you that I’m in this for good, but. Just… know it. And all I need – the only thing I need – is for you to be in this with me.'
He rolled his eyes behind closed lids: she really ought to come up with something less transparently fake as an objection. (He found it difficult to continue holding hands with anyone who was not John. Nobody else’s hands fit properly.)
John’s bitter laugh made something slither in his stomach. ‘No,’ he warned, and his voice had dropped to that pitch that meant Sherlock was indeed playing with fire. ‘No. I’m not doing this. Don’t get off subject.’
‘Wahey!’  Stamford shouted gleefully, coming over to grin and lift a pint in Sherlock’s direction. ‘You made it! Good lad.’
Until Sherlock took a surprise turn that startled John out of his own head and his anger altogether:
‘Mm.’ He stilled, then: ‘It’s not a pleasant thought, John, but I have this terrible feeling, from time to time, that we might all just be human.’
Sherlock frowned but elected not to impede her progress, deciding to turn instead to John, who would (it was tremendously likely) put up an even greater show of resistance to being corralled into costume.
), really, considering how many things he might have done with his life to make it better for others rather than simply passed the time so destructively for himself.
Cracking his back and stretching from having been slumped in the same position for he’d-lost-track-how-long, John groaned, ‘God, yes. Finally, someone who actually remembers about food.’
‘Let me do that,’ he offered immediately, and the woman — seemingly only a fear years younger than his dad, her hair wiry flyaway and untidily going grey — hopped up to greet him in a kind murmur, cup of ice cubes still in her hand.
‘What do I do?’ he murmurs, weary like he’s never felt. An elephant could be crushing one soft-padded foot down into his ribs and it would feel more or less the same.
Fractionally Holmes smiled, his eyes sliding down to my hands, which no doubt had become fervent accomplices to my cause as I got, I confess, quite swept up in the proving of my point. Hands, it struck me, that had caressed the wings of his shoulders and the locks of hair falling like ivy tendrils across his forehead, grasping at once the fragility and the strength of him.
Only… John continued to stare at the coffee table in front of him, not at Molly, who — despite it being at very least one o’clock in the morning, and having spent more hours than any normal person would have absorbing filth and
: homonym, hours; French for bear; in English, plural possessive pronoun. (The grammar matrix: among the things he could not delete, no matter how hard he tried.)
As I have been attempting to make clear. We are both fundamentally stubborn people, and I cannot give you –’
After many long seconds, heartrate returning to rest, John opened his eyes (pupils sluggishly contracting to normal, at a standard rate) and blurrily turned his face.
Sherlock’s footsteps in the corridor brought John’s eyes back up. Sadly, he was already — well, partially — dressed. For a man who’d kipped at most two hours on the sofa, Sherlock cut an annoyingly fine figure even in bare, damp feet. Perhaps more so.
better to do, were watching Sherlock disbelievingly. At last, Bradstreet inquired seriously, ‘Would you care to explain, sir?’
If nothing else, explaining his logic on paper (well, electronic paper, Bow Street was hardly in the dark ages, no matter how archaic their representatives’ methodologies) had focussed his mind on facts, concrete and unemotional. He felt, in spite of the paraesthesia along his side, steadier. He rose, handing his curt but thorough explanation of events and the copy of private detective’s license (he, unlike John, was under no false impression that that had been Mycroft’s personal payback for Sherlock’s secrecy) to Sergeant Challa.
amounts of make-up (hence the multiple cotton-pads smeared with the excess rouge, lipstick, mascara, nail varnish, and other necessary trimmings (including literal trimmings)), a pair of petite, pearlescent tights (laddered), and…
Rather than dignify this simple question with a response, Sherlock actually rocked down, hard and fast, so that John’s slicked fingers sunk in up to the second knuckle: he groaned in hungry anticipation because
The flat was in a bit of a state, in contrast to Sherlock artistically poised in front of their long window, but John smelled damp cardboard and that ruddy cologne Sherlock had given him and suddenly realised with buffeting sharpness, like the slap of a cold, wet wind off the ocean, that Anger it was going to be for the moment, because Sherlock turned to look at him and
‘Is he always like that, pet?’ the nurse asked Sherlock, taking a fresh saline drip off the tray along with a foil-covered cup of apple juice.
‘I didn’t,’ he admitted candidly. ‘Next to nothing, for ages. And what there is now is really only because I just send cheques off to cover my debts. Plus I haven’t seen an accurate rent statement in about six months, and that’s
Sherlock didn’t bother to look down at the table, to move or to take his eyes away from John’s, adding to the electric charge in the room that made John want to throw Sherlock against a wall. As it was, the heat of Sherlock’s body, not in contact anywhere in particular but somehow palpable everywhere, where his hands and mouth and skin
Sherlock pocketed the note. ‘And, out of curiosity, might I ask…’ (John recognised Sherlock’s Columbo voice and knew he had arrived at the last burning question which could connect Ryder to the carbuncle’s reappearance.) ‘Do you have any idea where the birds came from, before Mr. Windigate’s shop sold them on to you?’
‘Surely you too have felt the rapturous feeling of holding something lovingly, attentively made, an object both vulnerable to destruction and infinitely powerful in its potential to inspire, to enlighten and uplift, and on top of all this one that is, outside of all rationality and logic, simply splendid to behold? I have seen you at your microscope, at your experiments and your chemical notations, with just such enchanted delight. You will not even attempt to deny it.’
‘I am…’  His lungs felt swamped and his molars ached, but he gripped at the worn fabric of his chair between them, dragged the words out like thick-rooted weeds in a garden. ‘I am fucking
Determined not to let either of them, or anyone, derail his attempt at a functional sibling interaction, he inhaled through his nose and counted to ten. ‘How’s… that, erm — your book club thing?’
‘Once or twice a month,’ she estimated. ‘We originally kept a house in London for our visits but it seemed such an extravagance to keep the staff and rooms prepared at all times when we receive perfectly adequate comfort here. Recent events aside, of course.’ (If five-star room service and silk-and-crystal furnishings were ‘adequate’, John shuddered to think what sort of house she considered ‘extravagant’…)
He hadn’t been with a man since uni (and even that hadn’t been more than a drunken party fumble) — honestly hadn’t thought about it once since then —, but with the fiery sensation beneath his skin that made him want to break things and scream at the unfairness of the world and be a selfish, carefree, pleasure-seeking version of himself who could get away with murder, he bought Christopher a drink. And then another.
Getting down on one knee like a sprinter, he budged up close to Sherlock, who turned under heavy eyelids to peer at him warily.
Not a military or public safety investigation, that was more than obvious. Not a murder, or he would not have been able to laugh earlier (he was not so cold-blooded as either Mycroft or himself); nor, for the same reason, was this ‘friend’ merely a fiction to cover up one of his own indiscretions. Almost certainly Gruener had jilted, blackmailed, swindled, or (most likely) beguiled a twenty-something duchess (upper-class, naturally) whose self-destructive tendencies were not new but likely to result in a chain reaction of public scandal and private shame. More importantly, Gruener had already killed twice — four times, if you counted the dead newspaper reporter in Denmark, plus the ostensibly unrelated Parisian private investigator Gerrard Le Brun who no longer enjoyed the use of his legs (Sherlock counted both incidents). So far, Gruener had not seen his name officially linked to any crime whatsoever.
have the Carbuncle.’ (His eyes had gone icy, piercing John through with how loudly they seemed to be saying, ‘The work, before you; always
For along moment, Sherlock was silent, and John’s stomach clenched around a flare of wariness: what was there even left to upset him tonight?
(Long after attending to that other of Mycroft’s royal ‘colleagues’ in less-than-complete dress (his sheets were better material than 90% of the tourists who visited the Palace), which John had later described as ‘sans shirt, shirt pants, sans socks, sans everything’ — a reference he had loved being able to explain smugly —, Sherlock had made a promise to himself that he would not longer treat clients with (much) irreverence. He had realised during his time ‘away’ that he was grateful that they came, however vapid/thick/deluded/entitled/mundane they were, and not just for the thrill of the case. He had come to see, when he was gone from Baker Street, that, though he didn’t care for them himself, he could care about their problems — and thereby could, in no small measure, reduce the number of misunderstandings and mistakes in the world simply by doing something he already liked to do, something he was very good at doing. He could make sense of these portions of the world, when so little else seemed to make sense.)
Their rough breath continued to fill the bedroom as John automatically grabbed a handful of tissues and scrubbed away what he could, allowing Sherlock to shift onto his side, the sharp bone of his shoulder sticking familiarly into John’s.
The lightness John felt at Lady Morcar’s shrug burst forth as he laughed himself into the corridor, made his way to the street, and – as the first few light drops of rain tapped the back of his neck – stepped into a cab. The feeling only intensified slightly when he opened a beautifully signed cheque for £15,000.
’ about his gun, most likely, and the resultant guilt-inducing mess of afterward (also characteristic) and probably shuddered sobs and counted backwards from twenty, nineteen, eighteen —
Sherlock blinked at Poe’s statue. He supposed, now he thought of it, he was — the pillow was his least favourite (too firm); it smelled more of aftershave and unscented shampoo than his own.
John was distressed. He had accused Neville St Clair of failing to trust his wife (the same wife, Sherlock noted, teeth clenching, whom John had been very tactilely comforting for most of the previous night). Sherlock was not so emotionally ignorant as to fail to appreciate the connection. So John was distressed… still. Distressed, because of what Sherlock had done. Because he had broken their trust.
The sergeant nodded animatedly, holding out her hand again – distracted as he was, he had not noticed the layer of green and white fecal matter under her fingernails – she wasn’t squeamish, which in this case was directly profitable, to the rough sum of several thousand pounds.
(Rage and grief, it recurred to him, were sometimes indistinguishable. On John, especially so. Mouth, facial muscles, throat, all strained the effort not to quiver; eyes hard and bright; fists cramped so tight they’d be subdurally bruised. Ache: ubiquitous.)
‘Thank you!’ Challa was saying, a little gushingly, as she drew her phone from her pocket and began to dial. ‘And if you can’t find him – Baker, first initial H. on the receipt, I’ll leave that with you – I’m happy to keep her myself! I just – well thanks!’
‘I know,’ John murmured, ‘I know, it’s okay. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.’ He sat firmly on the patch of mattress by Sherlock’s hip, and his forehead brushed against Sherlock’s temple as they leaned towards each other. Both of their breathing was thick and close, but the psychosomatic effects on Sherlock’s chest were manifold.
‘For what crime?’ Sherlock reminded him, and John felt almost unaccountably like he was going to be sick. He swallowed instead.
With Flint (‘Excuse me! EEP! Sorry! Oh no!’) settling on Mycroft’s shoulder and nibbling at his lapels, Sherlock allowed the moment to wash over him.
to feel sexual, romantic things about the person who also filled so many unsexual, unromantic roles in his life? A person with whom he spent more time than he did alone? And how, for that matter, to tap into those feelings when for so long it had been of
With deadly seriousness, he kept his eyes on Sherlock’s, knowing at least some of his no doubt soppy sentimentality was visible in his expression. Sherlock gazed back, frown unmoved but eyes shifting back and forth between each of John’s, up-close.
him, not ‘Sherlock Holmes, Great Detective’ but the lanky mop-headed marble-skinned git of a man who looked at John with dragon’s eyes blown dark. Who shivered as John stepped close and even more when he brushed back his curls, who melted, groaning needily, at whatever rush of words John whispered in his ear, intoxicatingly weak at the knees before John had done much of anything. Sherlock, who folded clumsily into John’s advances, and from there it was no struggle at all for him to want anything and everything from Sherlock’s body. To love him so deeply they were both shaking with it. To want him, all of him, and no one else ever again.
1. FWIW: this chapter is the most substantially different from my pre-S4 draft to this revised published version. But that said, a *shocking* number of things here were remarkably close to what's been going on in 4x01 and 4x02, so the changes were made less to shoe-horn in brand new elements and much more to connect the bits I'd already written to their counterparts in the aired eps.)

‘Even if, as I shall continue to deny, I were not fine—’ (John made a sound very nearly like a growl, but said nothing else) ‘—it would be moot: they plainly know who I am, what I look like. Not just Gruener, either.’
‘New policy, sir,’ she told him, somewhat apologetically. ‘You have to bring in your license and sign your statement, within the hour.’
The light from the street shone on the open cardboard box, bursting with — he lifted the spines — ten copies, all in pleasingly attractive glossy jackets spelling out, ‘
He came back to himself when a flutter interrupted his field of vision: John was falling asleep. Even too-close, he was beautiful, like the indigo landing-lights on a runway just before touchdown. Thrilling, welcoming. Secure.
way to administer medication! — he had swallowed then looked at John. ‘Do they teach you about this in medical school?’
Nevertheless he reserved the right to be slightly ill-tempered when Sherlock, standing next to the bed, had nudged him awake just before 8 o’clock saying something that had sounded unfortunately like, ‘… expecting us in the next hour.’
Things were still tentative and delicate enough that instead John merely looked away, looked back at Sherlock’s frown, nodded impatiently (at himself, at Sherlock, at this case) and stepped out towards the door. No kiss.
Rather than voice his surprise at Sherlock’s having gleaned these facts about people had only just met (‘nail appointments’ twice a week? How did she have time to grow more fingernails in between? And how did he know that Thaw had pet
‘Sorry if I woke you,’ grumbled Molly in a surprisingly gruff voice, where she was leaning heavily against the worktop with eyes half-shut.
‘Christ, no, I meant—‘ John laughed outright now, and if Sherlock’s temporary embarrassment was what was needed to bring
Through a darkened exhibition case, he could make out the basic shape: she was standing in black Semtex (or a similarly professional ensemble), arm outstretched – far steadier than Suze’s – with a much nicer gun, pointed across the room at –
‘Of course.’ Naturally. John was a social creature (and, at times, he had a divertingly inaccurate sense of his relations with others: this, within recent memory, had been one of the factors that made Sherlock deem it impossible to know how John truly felt about him).
As she disappeared upstairs, Sherlock took two steps forward and leaned over, splaying a hand across the table to peer directly into John’s face, to glower some more.
'Walking back into the flat over an hour later, Sherlock felt a renewed sense of justification in his hatred of most members of his species.'
,’ John announced blandly, then, when the parrot’s sole reaction was to raise his foot as if in a clownish handshake, John gritted his teeth, then said, with a false brightness, ‘Ovid! Vogel. Dame. Come on, work with me.’
He grabbed his dressing gown from beneath his dry cleaning on the hook on the back of his door and went downstairs again.
‘So just because she’s still walking and talking, you think Gruener’s not as dangerous?’ He eyed Sherlock, because this was very much the problem Sherlock had: he liked drama, loved showing just how clever he was by daring death up against a ticking time bomb — and the thing he somehow
‘Because you are a wreck right now, but Rosie is fine, and she’s fine because your first thought was as her father. She’s your daughter, too. And she loves you, in case you’re getting that at all mixed up in your big head. She’s mostly just wondering how soon she can throw herself at some large livestock when the closest we’ve got here is, well… I dunno—’
After an uneventful moment, however, Sherlock opened his eyes. John was gazing at him: a flood of information washed over him, a complex ocular data stream of depth and light and colour that, when perceived in the mind, was flipped (contralateral processing: not affected by spikes in adrenaline or dopamine, thankfully) and redirected and interpreted as shapes, sizes and scales, weight,
It really had been an oversight for John to use their real address on his blog. (Then again, Sherlock had already posted all his information on
A clumped, torn sliver of a photographic memory — a smirk of a smile, that woman’s — floated up out of the morass.
‘Your date?’ he suddenly wondered aloud, turning to Molly as she gestured mutely if she should put the kettle on. ‘Yeah, please. But — you’re not seeing that Tom bloke anymore, then, you said?’
‘In the meantime, keep your head down,’ John added sternly, before she could leave. However afraid she was, she was also clearly hurt and enraged, a combination that had led to more body bags in his lifetime than he ever cared to count. ‘From everything we’ve got, this bastard’s not going to go quietly.’
John tried very hard not to be floored, and failed. His good suit and best dress shirts had been on the back of his door last night, but amidst everything else he hadn’t even registered it. This, on top of Sherlock’s customary peace offering, agreeing to eat dinner. Sherlock didn’t do domestic, much as John badgered him occasionally, but this seemed… caring, somehow. And that final fragment was a minefield of its own:
Just as he hit the pavement outside, another voice called after him, shouting, ‘Sir! SIR!’ He rounded on whoever it was, very,
Surprised, this time John laughed with her, a proper giggling enjoyment. When he’d regained his poker face, he shook his head. ‘The, er, DIY idea is a no-go: Sherlock ruled it out.’

She positively beamed with good humour. ‘Mr. Holmes, you exceed even your own reputation for indiscretion.’ (John managed not to snort into his quiche at the idea that

the idea that he’s clever – that he’s the only one clever enough to understand the significance of this “book” that he’s carrying, or keeping or hoarding, doesn’t matter – but
Were they going to try penetrative sex, here? Now? Would it be acceptable, with John half-drunk on middling Scotch and adrenaline and sympathetic pain for a woman he’d known for all of an hour and new-forged forgiveness? Would he be angry, if Sherlock didn’t stop him (didn’t want to stop him) getting carried away?
After a few moments, John disappeared into the bedroom briefly, before returning. Then the sound of the telly blared at top volume — ‘Sorry, sorry, Christ, what —’ — then quickly decreased in volume to a subtle, after-hours ripple of chat and background music, then sport, then the sharper bass tones consistent with higher-quality sound equipment and less asinine viewer expectations: a film.
Assuming (rightly) that John wasn’t about to respond to any of that, Sherlock went for a different tack. ’Surely we’ve met our collective familial obligation quota this week.’
side of the bed. Up close, John was almost out of focus, high-definition, surreally present as his entire field of vision. Downturned, set mouth: either angry or simply… ‘concerned’ (likelihood, 3:7). Lines and pores. Eyebrows.
‘Haven’t gotten round to questioning him yet, mind,’ the Inspector was saying, and John, in another in a series of dim realisations, looked up at a clock. It was twenty to nine.
(But of course, had Molly not been present, they would not be here either, not be able to make one last effort to bring some semblance of balance (the answers still unreached, threads still loose) - of
After a moment, Sherlock blinked, shifting gears, and admitted, ‘We… may need to insinuate ourselves at the reception. As a worst-case scenario. I’m looking into it.’
‘I’m a doctor, Violet,’ he change his angle of attack, scenting that he was several hands down, and need to come up with a better hand very, very soon or lose the whole round. ‘and I have a sister, and I’m just saying I wouldn’t want my sister spending time with someone who hurts animals for fun, and whose ex-wife filed for divorce only to wind up gasping for air, choking in the middle of the sea —’
John snorted. ‘But then Ryder leaves the room at around quarter-past-five, after Huggins has already head off home, accidentally leaving Horner unattended until he goes for his dinner...’
: the famished guard by the door! Evidently (slightly) less slow on the uptake than the one outside. (Sherlock needed the name of this private firm, if only to know when he wouldn’t have to prepare overmuch for the next invasive scenario.)
‘Of course,’ reasoned the John in his Mind Palace, ‘you can’t be sure he keeps both the book and the key, or password or whatever, on him at all times.’
'I have seen Heinrich's bank statements,' Violet insisted smoothly. 'Heinrich is not interested in me for my money, or anything so mercenary. I am sorry that you were disappointed with your girlfriend, but I'm afraid that does not mean that you should feel justified in imagining failures in others' relationships.'
— the ringing became a shrill shriek of a commuter (the Thameslink train to Elephant & Castle) approaching —
ready to tell them in no uncertain terms that he was not staying, not paying, and not interested in anger management courses or family counselling, when he saw their tall, underage waiter, holding out his well-worn coat.
‘Know to be careful? No, maybe not, though you’d think at a kids’ petting zoo they’d maybe bring something a little less pointy than a bloody Highland cow—’
,’ he repeated slowly, lips catching on Sherlock’s with each letter. A little cross-eyed, Sherlock met John’s gaze, and nodded fractionally. John’s small smile was just at the corner of what he could see but John kissed him, purposefully, deeply, and Sherlock dug his fingers into the thick ropes of John’s femoral muscles, and closed his eyes.
That wasn’t what he had meant to say, but he was apparently in no control of his rough voice, nor his face. Whatever his muscles were doing, though, seemed to satisfy — or at least subdue — John’s surge of emotions. John nodded, once.
, you know how much I supported you when you told them,’ – Harry scoffed loftily and John felt his fury
Again the aromatic tang of John’s sweat on his skin clobbered him like a plank to the head – a comparison both of them were qualified to draw – and without thinking, Sherlock bent nearly in half and licked John’s navel.
At Bow Street, Sherlock gave his best Usain Bolt impersonation and, as ever, left John to pick up the fare.
He saw an insulted flicker bounce across Sherlock’s face before John had him pulled down, body pressed firmly between his own and the moulding, by planting one hand against the wall but keeping his mouth
self? Who the hell…’ And then it dawned on him, his expression shifting tectonically. ‘Oh, god. I know, don’t I.’
Previous evidence had indicated that John had never participated either in short- or longer-term romantic/sexual relations with other men, beyond perhaps some rather drunken semi-serious homosocial antics during various army and university holidays, none of which had ventured beyond fumbling and all of which could have (and had) been laughed off. Furthermore, John had almost explicitly wondered at Sherlock’s own non-platonic history, though it seemed he doubted various enemy insinuations of total ignorance. As usual, John respected Sherlock’s privacy. (He little needed to know either about Victor or Mycroft’s erstwhile aid Alec.) But John had, enthusiastically it seemed, thrown himself into proceedings; had groaned and grunted, and petted and encouraged and
, I see! I do beg your pardon!’ He stuck out his hand again, and shook first John’s and then Sherlock’s heartily. ‘I was entirely distracted in the chaos of my ordeal, I hardly thought of your being involved!’ (Talked like an academic though.) ‘You are quite right, my wife is Dr. Susan Baker. She specialises in avian intelligence projects, you know, and she has recently been considering investing in a parrot for a long-term project in human-bird communication. Ovid, yes, I see! Hello Ovid!’
Suze took a deep, shuddery breath and shook her head, tongue worrying one of her false-brightened teeth until she found her voice. ‘It’s over now. I nearly went broke trying to take him to court — or to put it in print. Lost my job, my references, my lease, every appeal I put in, took out a loan and lost m’great-grandmother’s good china that we’d had since before the war.’ She took another minute to prevent her voice from breaking again.
The trouble with stab wounds was that you not only had to worry about what the blade actually hit — the big slice it took on the way in, and then again on the way out, usually leaving smaller, sometimes invisible cuts that critically undermined the structural integrity of veins and arteries, organ walls, muscle groups — but also, often worse, about the infection of a bad knife stirring up bacteria with a whole soup of fluids and tissues that were not meant to mix.
His throat tightened to hear the quiet, careful (no doubt drug-loosened) question emerge so gently from Sherlock. Years ago, he thought inwardly, Sherlock would have kept that question to himself, tagged it as ‘inappropriate curiosity’ and stowed it for a later date. Now, though, it was obviously coloured by his own experiences… Had he contracted a fever from any of the scars on his back? Infections were all too common in insanitary environments, and John doubted torturers and criminals were overly-fastidious about cleaning their tools. John’s neck ached. He didn’t know much about it, still. He longed to know, almost as much as he longed to know whether Sherlock wanted him to hold his hand.
But Sherlock also had smiled over his shoulder at John in Mr. Ramani’s defunct storage room, had watched John with pained prescience as he exposed Neville St Clair’s hoax, had not so long ago given up almost everything in his life so John wouldn’t lose his…
— his hand was clenched so tight as he walked that shockwaves of pain were still shooting up his left arm, but he physically could not release his fists, not until he found something to punch that was not guaranteed to break his hand. Or land him in handcuffs. He wanted a drink.
, so absolutely miniscule a portion of how the world worked or how people behaved or how John could possibly be real. Even Sally Donovan had seen it, spotted it from the beginning, had been right to moan, when he’d launched, high as a main topgallant sail, into his first-ever Yard monologue describing the facts of the case, when she’d muttered in a pained voice, ‘Oh my
‘Did you though, Harry?’ he cut in tightly, temper boiling, though his voice stayed in control. ‘Because I seem to remember a grand total of

‘Something along those lines, I wouldn’t be surprised. Although, “nurse” is probably not her role,’ he added under his breath.
Baker’s face was creased with shock and almost comical disappointment, and John intervened, hoping to force him to come down, on one side or the other. ‘I think Sherlock said you bought this bird for your wife, Mr. Baker?’
He sniffed, waited for his stomach to settle. Slowly it shifted from churning to simply aching, but he made himself stand, ignoring the keening of his knees as he rose. On his feet again, he blinked. He scrubbed fiercely at his face with knuckled fingers, and ignored the water on his hands except to wipe it on his jeans.
It still said the same message: twelve words, two full stops.  Fifty-eight characters (including punctuation).
There. John would find that interesting, and would appreciate — yes — must be having a tea break — a flush of pleasure upon the vibration of his phone in his hand —
’No, never have been. But I couldn’t fall back to sleep, so I reckoned I might as well get back to work…’
In one gulp John necked the last of his pint, then stood to fish out his wallet, throwing it down with one hand as he nonchalantly used the cover of the crowd and the shield of his body to hide a hand that slid all the way up Christopher’s leg to where he was, the heel of John’s hand discovered, tented with interest.
But then he catches a hint of Rosie’s sniffly hiccoughs and Sherlock’s slightly heavier than usual tread, and gets to his feet to meet them at the door.
And let me just say: having been on Chelmsford High Street at midnight on New Year's Eve, I would not suggest going without a battleplan.
‘And you don’t remember anything?’ John pressed gently, looking him in the eyes searching for reassurance. ‘I know you said, the other day, but —’
Sherlock made a beeline for the coffeepot. ‘Congratulations, John, on having graduated to correct deductions about the time of day.’
‘All right then. That’s… that’s good.’ John checked his watch, attempting to hide a smile. Sherlock wished he wouldn’t feel he had to. ‘I reckon we better get moving, then, if we don’t want to miss the Red Baron’s arrival.’ (The reference, if it was one, went over Sherlock’s head: irrelevant. More relevant: John was smirking, good humour gradually reclaiming its hold.) ‘And you’ve got that damn tuxedo. Another night of poncy women fainting all over you while you’re dressed as James bloody Bond.’
(At some point, he was going to have to inform Sherlock that sex in the morning was a particularly effective way to make sure John didn’t waste the entire day keyed up and hyper-alert to every ruddy thing he encountered. Or else he should make a habit of having a shower directly after leaving Sherlock in bed.)
(Gruener’s vulpine eyes had glimmered with mirth as he struck a match, lit, and inhaled deeply, almost soundlessly; Sherlock had despised him instantly, imagined taking one of his glass-fronted pictures, smashing it over his head and twirling it — after taking the cigarette for himself, of course.)
‘The binder at Ramani’s,’ Sherlock replied tersely. ‘He was not happy with you.’ St Clair nodded. ‘Though, in this matter at least, he was perfectly innocent.’
He faced him, surprised. Mycroft was — was he? — merely contemplative, or actively concerned. Enigmatic as ever.
‘Hm?’ John asked, coming back to Earth. Molly was considering him, twirling her fork on a forgotten wide rice noodle. ‘Sorry, gathering wool: what’d you say?’
He’d stopped working much at that surgery, near his old (temporary) flat, but he surely still had her number… unless his attention-hogging flatmate-stroke-whatever had erased it. He could almost imagine it.
Sherlock was hanging his jacket and replacing it with the one he tended to wear when he expected trouble: hand-to-hand trouble.
•	Souvenir – custom-made? Or simply discs/plates/lenses that could be replaced, interchanged – so there would be alternates somewhere. Even if they could get the device itself, with its latest album of victims, there would be, in some – proverbial needle, haystack –
with Harry, how could he possibly complain about truly superior pets!) ‘And how long do you anticipate it will take me to figure out how Ryder stole the carbuncle? I’m sure we can work both cases at once.’
That set him off again, and this time she gulped down an unattractive sound that was most definitely an involuntary laugh. Which only made the giggles worse.
‘Right, sorry, hello,’ he got to his feet, never quite standing all the way up, ‘sorry, I didn’t know we were expecting anyone.’
His vision feels fuzzy. On the ground, beside where he’s ended up slumped against the wall, fallen into the dirt and weeds, there appears to be a shiny something half-stained with red — the red on his clothes —
‘AH!’ Mycroft grunted, throwing his hands up to protect himself and dropping the umbrella, while John swung around in the kitchen, shouted inarticulately, and stepped forward (too late) to help, while Sherlock tried not to damage the bird, his violin, or this single instance of perfect cosmic retribution.
Well. When I started this series, I was in another country, in another degree; there was no Brexit, or Trump, or TAB, nevermind series 4.
this — hadn’t chosen this life, in a way altogether different to how John felt, in his bones, that he hadn’t chosen this life either: this life had chosen
As he rifled through his closet for an appropriately John-esque outfit, he lamented, not for the first time, the height disparity between them, otherwise he would simply have stolen one of John’s jumpers and revelled in the smell of him as he and Suze paraded around Lambeth and its environs posing as a couple.
John popped open the box, and took out the vermillion-and-midnight blue lacquer pin (in the shape of an anatomically-correct, if stylised, heart) for Molly, who affixed it to her dress wordlessly.
He gasped, hotly, struggling to see through the stinging wetness on his face, where he found himself on the floor. His beige carpet stared callously back.
John was looking at him in mild surprise, palm still gentle curved, flat, as though ready to receive Sherlock’s hip if he slid back into position. His other hand was raised slightly (placatingly? defensively?). As an overall figure, he looked as if he was about to ask for a waltz.
He wasted no time. ‘Did you speak to a journalist approximately five months ago? Interested in an undercover exposé of pornography involving minors and… less than consenting adults?’
‘You’re going into shock,’ Molly informs him, standing a safe distance from the edge. ‘It’s the next thing that’s going to kill you.’
dedicated to the study of a single man, in-depth and in all his unlikely specificity, and perhaps if John had all the information, he would more quickly grasp what Sherlock’s dark moments prophesied. ‘You stick around for it, for the cases and the adrenaline rush, a life where you get to play the normal bloke at the office and come home to murderers on the settee. Everyone we know — Mrs. Hudson, the drug cartel runner’s wife and exotic dancer —;’
‘Use mine,’ Sherlock suggested, digging his phone from his trousers to hand it over. ‘Make sure you switch it to “video”— ’
He refused to turn or to stop — to deduce (beyond what he did automatically) — simply because John’s tone was one of amused exasperation. Surely this was better than shooting the walls (or shooting up)? He threw in an extra piercing trill just to retaliate.
Suze, evidently thrown by the sudden arrival of another actor in this melodrama, still remembered to sob, ‘You
after waking, where Sherlock had not because he was brilliant and never actually interested in sleep, especially when nudity (specific, not general) was the alternative.
John didn’t bother to ask how Damery knew his title, merely returned a polite, assured, ‘Afternoon,’ as he also shook his hand. (Sherlock wondered if Damery had chosen ‘Doctor’ over ‘Captain’ for any specific reason, or if he had been tipped off by Mycroft.)
‘It really wasn’t.’ John looked at him pointedly. ‘Maybe tomorrow, or whenever the, er, case is finished…’ He licked his lips anxiously, the same prickle along his skin from the last time they’d sat here, except today he could see very clearly the red colour of Sherlock’s mouth and the frozen angle of his beautiful hands; couldn’t see the blotch he’d sucked into Sherlock’s neck or the unmarked places his own hands had touched and pulled and slid. ‘Maybe we can go to Angelo’s and I can not pay him with my half of our gemstone finders’ fee. Though obviously I’m not going to be terribly keen on eating anything with wings for about the next hundred years so it’s basically Bolognese or vegetarian for me…’
‘I appreciate the mistakes I made with Moriarty,’ said Sherlock almost with a snarl. ‘Gruener is not the same man. Cruelty and malice almost never come in that perfectly, psychotically intelligent a package. Gruener doesn’t have a master plan — as you say, he hasn’t even killed Suze, when that would plainly be the easiest thing in the world, should he wish to!’
He blinked some more. A million thoughts were clamouring in his head. It seemed utterly impossible; yet, here was the proof. And whatever remained, however improbable...
From this position, with Sherlock’s head curled under his shoulders, back bowed, John couldn’t see his expression — whether it was shock-blank, or grimaced with pain, or biting his lip, eyes bright and eager and unfocussed —
They went on criticising the film until, unfortunately, he couldn’t hold back from sleep any longer.
They marched up and down the street and the two parallel ones plus the adjacent dead-end lane, then attempted to scale the nearest overlooking yard. Unsurprisingly, most of the gardens were in states of leafy anarchy. At one point he considered scaling the rocky rise, in case the view from the tracks afforded any insight (perhaps it would provide a good elevated post from which to surveil the upper-floors when nocturnal business hours commenced). But Suze flapped about, even going so far as to yank his sleeve to pull him away, as though she feared he was about to throw himself under an oncoming train — there was none in sight! he was neither deaf nor blind! — and so he decided to put it off. At least until this evening when he and John could return: John would let him, so long as he came along to stand guard. (An unnecessary measure: John could no more stop a train than Sherlock could. Though a part of him would like to watch him try.)
‘Right,’ Harry agreed, nodding sympathetically at whatever horrible unending nightmare of a conversation she was managing to carry on by herself. ‘And — I mean, I wasn’t going to say this if you’d stuck together, Johnny — but, well. She wasn’t exactly the nicest woman you’ve ever dated. There’s
‘I didn’t…’ He licked his lips. Clinical voice: steady, confidant, devoid of judgment. ‘Have you done this before?’
most people consider them so distasteful that no one in their right mind would bother with them.’ He stopped and smiled his cat’s grin. Unsurprisingly, she faltered slightly.
‘Cheers, think I will,’ said Sherlock, with genuine appreciation of the man’s utter stupidity in letting a potential adversary – hell, assassin – roam the grounds unattended. (Then again, he should keep an eye out for cameras and other surveillance equipment: Gruener was an idiot, but he had managed to elude at least the most rudimentary searches.)
‘Doctors and nurses — and midwives — are always the first ones accused, historically speaking,’ John had piped up from behind a newspaper.
‘That is not hygienic,’ said John, re-entering the room. (His lip was downturned in a firm, thin line, not very but crucially different from the solemn, risk-assessing ridge of a moment earlier. Sherlock attempted to read his expression – angry, but determined – was he upset by Challa’s interruption or Sherlock’s entertaining of the case at this inopportune moment? His body language was mixed and therefore perplexing.)
Reproducing a hand, the man’s grip was strong — apposite for a figure whose long-standing reputation in ‘society’ (if such a thing existed outside of gentleman’s clubs) had been one of unflappable, delicate finesse in handling situations best kept quiet: the personable counterpart to Mycroft’s strategic mind for arranging numbers and skulking behind people’s bins.
‘Thank you,’ John murmured, after Sherlock shivered leaned to kiss the hollow of John’s throat (minimally responsive — or was it?).

, John would probably have labelled it, and in the privacy of his own weltering thoughts, Sherlock admitted to himself that he craved it, that he had been without it his entire life before meeting John who offered it, so foolishly, to him.
Having hit upon a sensitive question, John waited (not looking at Sherlock) while Damery frowned guiltily. ‘I… I must ask you not to press that point, Dr. Watson. As I have described it, my client — my friend — is in a terrible situation, and I must rely on your sympathy to keep his or her identity private, though I have no doubt at all that you could discover it without much trouble.’
‘Read it to me, then,’ he commanded imperiously. ‘The portion of this essay you found so remarkably praiseworthy.’

John’s expression wavered between argumentative and cautious curiosity, as Ryder preceded Sherlock into the living room. (He had successfully delivered the gem; he was neither as irate as when they had parted nor wholly repentant; he considered (his eyes swept Ryder, the room, and then at last Sherlock [whose stomach clenched, while a raindrop from the curls at the back of his neck slid shiveringly down below his collar]) all possible outcomes of this sudden rendez-vous, his shoulders tensing in protective anticipation.)

In an old comic book, a cloud-shaped bubble would have appeared over Sherlock’s head, with a petulant, ‘DRAT!’ As it was, he just scowled and ducked behind his phone.
‘You phoned us!’ he half-shouted. (He bit back the fact that the phone call had interrupted a rather eventful evening which this apparent goose chase was continuing to keep him from sorting out.) Bradstreet looked a little abashed.
A longer chapter -- blame John, his head's all over the place -- because I've been gone, passing exams and revising this chapter to intersect a few additional places with series 4 (though again, LOTS of this was all already here before S4 aired).
Molly, John itched to see, was not deceived. ‘Oh, but —’ She looked at him. ‘John, won’t you — I don’t want to take your
The long survey of the regions between Baker Street and the pub restaurant at which these (oh, god, already roaring) festivities were to take place had been a productive one, not least for Sherlock’s ability to observe and review outward and inward data on relationships, subcategory: anniversaries.
‘Christ.’ John did laugh this time, staring at Sherlock’s embarrassingly erect penis and biting his lip. Sherlock, unable to help himself, instinctively placed his palms on the tops of John’s thighs, then looked up at him. ‘That’s…’ John’s cock twitched, and he shivered. ‘That’s a good idea, yeah, thanks.’
Sherlock’s eyes fell on a miniature, in oils most likely, of a female figure reclining over the side of a bed, displayed for the beholder; in her bared breast was lodged an arrow (artistic license? In a real woman, that high in the chest, she would have seen the shot; almost certainly fatal), clinging to the arrow where it entered her body and lying across her abdomen was a — was he? — peculiarly smirking infant. Looming over them all, holding up one finger in admonishment while, with its other hand, either removing or (more probable) forcing the arrow deeper into the woman’s chest, was a skeleton encased in sinuous, transparent skin.
He was staring blankly at the tray of Keflex in the supply cupboard. He really shouldn’t text Sherlock. They could go a few hours without each other. And besides —
Without removing his coat, without a word of greeting, John stepped carefully between the row of laptops and other notebooks of various sorts to sit heavily in his chair. His fingers,
‘You returned surprisingly early from such an important dinner, Madam,’ Sherlock was inquiring, not touching his meal. John settled into his role of silent listener and forked a mouthful of his (no doubt hideously expensive) spinach quiche.
(Messages were perhaps the worst conveyors of tone, but, based on years of experience attempting to gauge John’s texting habits
‘In that case.’ John came forward, finally unlocking his arms and stepping into the kitchen where Sherlock was frozen in place, fingers cramping where he was holding the book open to this particular, wholly extraordinary page. ‘Sherlock Holmes —’
, assuming that Sherlock would have both wanted to be at and have been shunted to the front of that particular bureaucratic queue.
Behind him he heard the glide of fabric, which meant Sherlock had probably buttoned his shirt back up a bit. Good. At least he’d read that correctly. Half-in, half-out of his clothes, and — yes, John found, turning to look at him darkly — Sherlock was glaring irritatedly at John: waiting as though

Gruener’s gentle chuckle felt like it was tolling ominously in his mind, clashing painfully with Maureen’s acetic scepticism.
John paused, with one hand on the bannister, to see Sherlock sitting a little straighter on the floor, hands paused over the keyboard.
In no way he could cite or specify, he had continued to respond to stimuli and situations generally in the same way as ever, but the feeling travelled with him, as though…
With a murmur low and suddenly, uncharacteristically shaky, John enunciated every word with deliberate force: ‘I love you —
‘So pleased we don’t need to go to this preposterous celebration this evening?’ This, half to gauge whether John’s mood needed to be settled before they left the flat or more gradually.
His own hands, warmed from his tea, were scrambling for somewhere to hold Sherlock closer, somehow; his lapels, his neck, his sharp, wide shoulders through his jacket –
But Sherlock couldn’t look at John. The situation, which had started as first perfunctory and then jovial, had become entirely fraught with an all-too transparent parade of his own failings. He had been wanting to capture John’s mouth, with its absurd London born-and-bred accent tumbling out, all evening, and yet all he had succeeded in doing was teaching
Beaming, John looked at Sherlock, shaking his head in a slow manner not at all unlike his disbelief when Sherlock did something apparently remarkable. ‘She laughs at her own jokes. No wonder you like her.’
, despite the prickle along his neck, because Mary had been so much more subtle when she’d done that) — and John was already tucking his phone back into his pocket, determined not to forget much longer.
A low blow. Sherlock opened his eyes with a scowl to read his brother up and down: irritated, obviously (eyebrows recently brushed smooth after having been raked with frustration, seat uneasy despite John’s especially comfortable chair); had spent the morning in at least two — no, three — meetings (the stain of fine quality Assam, taken for appearances’ sake rather than an actual desire to consume such a quantity in the allotted time); exercise and sleep regimes unaltered. Mycroft simply being his usual, tedious, hateful self.
‘I love you, Papagena,’ Ovid crooned merrily. Sherlock felt vaguely ill and strode rapidly into the kitchen.
— No doubt Sherlock would find the kinkiest, weirdest (and most expensive) lube or — Who was he kidding, there’d be gay sex toys from the darkest, most sordid corner of the web, stuff he wouldn’t even know how to use.
‘You could have spared yourself this absurd and, obviously, reckless ordeal – Cusack would have kept the jewel and continued to ignore your interest, even if you had
‘And did they give a rat’s arse when my flat got wrecked a few days later? Ha! Thank god I’d decided to go to me mum’s. Back home,’ she added, to John, who dug deep through his horror and smiled back.
That was very much the problem: homeless witnesses were notoriously untrusted, unreliable, unprotected and therefore unobjective. Objectivity, Sherlock mused, was the privilege of those who didn’t have to worry about whether they would be knifed in their sleep on a bus bench for their honesty. And addictions only muddied the waters further.
‘Well,’ Mrs Hudson pronounced, a little uncertainly to John as Sherlock (rejoining the present) settled back into the cushions. ‘I’m very glad to have you boys home at last. Even after all this nonsense — I nearly lost track of the days!’
An hour later, climbing back into bed, smelling of fried oil and ears chilled by a faint drizzle, John felt his heavy eyes sliding shut before Sherlock was even properly under the duvet.
He sighed. John was knackered, if he was honest, too knackered to worry about anything more than the time, Sherlock’s pill regimen, and the day they had coming tomorrow — well, today. He yawned. Shameful. Ordinarily he could go days without it. But then again he hadn’t had a proper full night’s rest in god knew how long, and neither — despite his less-than-an-hour long kip during dinner — had Sherlock. Maybe in an hour or so he could talk Sherlock into letting them lie down, just for a bit, just to rest their eyes…
All this brought a vivid, gruesome reminder of the reality of case before them. John looked again at Sherlock, who, he found, was watching him with something like sadness.
Another day, then: definitely. Prove Irene wasn’t the only person who could make Sherlock Holmes beg for mercy — twice.
A crash to his left distracted both him and Ms. Cusack – Sherlock had, it seemed, upturned a crystal vase filled with three bright blue glass-spun flowers, and sent it tinkering to the carpeted floor. Thankfully, the fake flowers had no water to spill, but
Sherlock’s eyes shot (damn the dizziness) to look at his profile and (unshaven) right cheek: stern, tense, faded and lines from two nights of terrible sleep in these appallingly tasteless concrete slabs they let pass for wood chairs — yet even through this, he was making a joke.
The rest of the night was largely a delicious, shameful blur of overwhelming, almost unreal pleasure. Christopher remained half-dressed for ages, hitting the bed and finding John clambering over him, stroking down his body and working him into a state, neither of them yet even out of their pants. Then he used his mouth.
‘Right.’ John looked at him with a lilt of an eyebrow. ’I mean, that’s complete bollocks, of course, but don’t let that stop you.’  He went about setting out a second plate — even when angry, an optimist— before dishing up his own and beginning to eat with a soldier’s terse efficiency (and posture… on-edge, overly formal…
Ryder!) was to be found lurking behind a lamp or beneath their furniture. ‘Since when is Ryder the suspect?’
of the rain against their windows. All over London, under the same rain-blanketed sky reflecting back at them with misty purple-orange clouds, human beings were carrying on all manner of daily toil: somewhere, someone was achieving a milestone sending dopamine and endorphins flooding their system; somewhere else, possibly in the same building or tube carriage, someone else was wishing they’d never been born, serotonin and other neurotransmitters failing to fire; people died alone in their flats, or fought with their families, or danced with their veins high on substances created by and/or in the nervous systems of humankind over the course of centuries; people made what, to themselves, were enormously important but outwardly mind-numbingly trivial decisions about football matches and travel holidays to the South of France and the fate of the world — passing their precious few, unknowable moments of consciousness in the company, oftener than they liked to think, of people they didn’t even know. John Watson, with brush of his thumb along Sherlock’s palm, was holding his hand.
‘Burglary,’ Sherlock mouthed hungrily along his jaw, before sliding downward. ‘Nine a.m. at Bow Street.’
Through the muffled down of the pillow, Sherlock’s voice drawled, ‘The internet, I am given to understand, provides few things in variety so well as sexual paraphernalia.’
A car out front. The front door shut firmly, followed a moment later by the ascent of sure-footed but nevertheless aging feet on the stairs. In the kitchen, their one good tea service — well, the pot and two matching cups (with the third, slightly heavier but nearly matched, though John would of course take the odd fourth mug for himself;
Several things happened in a blur: a grunt from behind John made him take his eyes off Mary for a fraction of a second – this was Sherlock’s moment –  he leapt –
Trying not to be put out, John returned to the newspaper, now slightly crinkled from where his own hands had been gripping it a little too tightly. He read, and then re-read the next sentence until he could be sure he wasn’t about to jump Sherlock in the back of a cab at just before 9 a.m.
This much Sherlock already knew; and, in any event, if he was unfamiliar with his popular culture references, he was absolutely uninterested in the stultifying matter of St Clair’s
?!’ blurted out someone he had not met (early thirties; loud, already on his third pint, much too into football, unfaithful to his girlfriend — who was conspicuously absent —, and otherwise all-around cocky), one person over on John’s other side, sandwiched between a woman (a nurse from Barts) and an even younger man (a technician, also at Barts). ‘What, from Baker Street, you mean?’
‘Email “failed permanently” — I’d say that’s a fairly clear indicator that this “Miss Morstan” has deleted her account. Alas, you’ll have to find other correspondents for your’ (he wrinkled his nose) ‘poetry.’
He found that even more unbelievable, not least because of the tremendous work ethic she’d shown in the last day. And just her, well, overall… self.
‘She quit ages ago,’ Beth said, looking at him as though worried about his memory. ‘Remember? Just after you left. Haven’t seen her since.’
,’ John gasped, blinking with shock, but Sherlock kept his mouth over the bulging navy cotton without remorse, and John whined and bowed into the heat and threaded his fingers in Sherlock’s hair so it was demonstrably
Part of this, John could admit in the privacy of his own thoughts, was of course his own doing: overly sensitive about their new relationship, about how much it meant to him. (
). Shaking off the man’s sickeningly suggestive demeanor, Sherlock replied in kind, trading all the usual jibes (‘I think you ought to be a lot more cautious than you’ve been up to now. Not that it will make a difference, of course’), all the while collecting data — the layout, CCTV locations, scents, the sounds and thence routines of the guards — for later perusal and sorting in his mind palace.
The sleeping man was, he had to admit, filthy. The knitted cap of Mr Hugh Boone, acclaimed itinerant spoken-word poet of the City, might once have been brown, or blue, or even orange, but appeared to have mouldered into crusty flakes above the man’s ears; the distinct smells of sweat, bitter smoke, and the muddy fishy tell-tale whiff of the Thames combined with the drunk tank’s almost tangible stench of vomit, alcohol, and piss. His no doubt stinking breath rattled in phlegmatic wheezes through his famous facial atrocity: his mangled lip. John cringed involuntarily. The straining, discoloured skin, if it had ever been stitched where it was cut, had healed poorly, a violent gash travelling up from Boone’s mouth to mottled forehead and (beneath his hat) possibly upwards to his cranium. He was lucky the site hadn’t become infected.
‘Goodnight, then, madman.’ On impulse, he took the extra plunge and leaned down to kiss Sherlock briefly. Sherlock’s mouth was still slightly pink.
All in all, a perfectly ‘respectable’ street: the little garden whatever-you-called-it thing sticking out into the road to funnel traffic only one way at a time, thus preventing motorists speeding through as a detour; trees every few hundred yards, on alternating sides of the street; even their mark — the yellow-brick Edwardian house just here by the railway overpass — probably cost more than he could afford (even now) to pay (on his own); the flat in-set, wide, racing green door was neither chipped nor splattered (though, of course, there was the habitual accumulated exhaust and dust that coated the facades and lungs of all London. Across the street, he noticed, was a far nicer house, with bay windows just in the shadow of the elevated tracks, with lace curtains flung aide in the windows and a pretty spray of bright flowers behind the half-height iron fence. (Gruener, Sherlock would have suspected even had he not already known this to be true, would keep this place as a property for himself or for discreet guests — a luxurious residence with all the touches of the domestic that would satisfy short-term occupants. Only short-term, naturally, since the comings and goings of the three identical attached — and internally inter-connected — homes directly opposite would arouse suspicion in the curious, given enough time. (People always needed so much
Sherlock’s face had taken on the cold, aloof mask it donned whenever the passionate violinist and petulant child became the genius detective, icy and off-limits. Standing outside on a – he thought for a moment – Friday in late July, with the city vibrating with life around them, John considered the surreal possibility that he had indeed made the entire evening up. Made up the smell of Sherlock’s sweat where it gathered in the hollow of his neck and collarbone; made up the feeling of his calluses on John’s ribs; made up the
‘Oh, for fuck’s sake, Sherlock. You don’t get to play the caring nursemaid who came in for pity sex —’
, blared Sherlock’s inner alarm clock. A celebration of this feeling, the warm hand that steered him away from the elbows and odours of every other obnoxious human (many of whom no doubt had been those sun lotion-lacquered bathers on benches and lawns throughout the city again today, and were now both slightly burned and moderately dehydrated: a charming combination), and simply kept him.
‘No, you didn’t.’ He put both settings on the table, not meeting Sherlock’s frown. ‘Funnily enough, I wanted a proper dinner without having to cook, so I decided for the both of us.’
He walked, with newly schooled rhythmic efficiency, down to the town’s second best, and biggest, local, a bustling place that attracted as many out-of-towners as regulars. He knew it of old — had practically grown up here. Turned out: it was a Thursday.
, who will quite happily spend an hour informing you in excruciatingly distracted detail of your misapprehension.’
‘Must be losing my youthful good looks,’ he hedged, aiming for levity. ‘Kipped in far worse places in Afghanistan, and even then didn’t hear any complaints.’
. The police, and possibly Ms. Cusack.’ He hesitated. ‘Sherlock hoped you might be able to wait, before you told Inspector Bradstreet and called it all off. At least while Sherlock follows up the last few…’ (parrots, he thought unhelpfully) ‘leads.’
Sherlock’s eardrums were possibly about to explode. Had he cared less about the precious instrument in his hands, he would have hurled it to the floor. ‘You know me, John. I can never have a “bad day” when I spend it among junkies and vagrants.’
‘Fuck,’ John gasped, unable to contain himself. Sherlock had the nerve to chuckle shakily. John felt like he was boiling. He traced his fingers across Sherlock’s abdomen again for the sheer thrill of it. After several heated seconds he lifted his eyes to Sherlock’s. The sight of him, waiting and half-dressed and stunning in the reflection of the kitchen glow, flooded him with the desire to see him
‘Let’s see what crap telly we can bore you to sleep with today?’ he murmured invitingly, flipping past children’s afterschool programmes and endless (and potentially but probably un- interesting) red-alert bulletins on the news.
There were infinite alternative answers to that question, but he hazarded, ‘Tampons?’ knowing it would derail Sherlock’s incredulous train of thought.
‘Not so much,’ he replied eventually, continuing to address the whole room rather than peer at Sherlock in the half-light. ‘But the surgery was more complicated — the bullet nicked my shoulder, whereas you, fortunately, didn’t have it hit anything. And the sepsis was my main problem. That was why they didn’t move me to a bigger hospital: worried the trip would make the fever worse.’
‘Contributed!’ John shouted, throwing his arms up and marching to the kitchen. (Tea – a very good idea; calming and satiating in equal measure.) ‘For fuck’s sake, Sherlock, if I wanted a sodding
Sherlock sat, which at least apparently released everyone from the binding predicament of not being the first to stop standing.
In the siren- and jackboot-rocked din of the paramedics arriving, Gruener, the guard, Mary, Molly, Suze, all being manhandled or carted or escorted away, John had been too preoccupied making sure the ambulance people had all the necessary information (acid, Christ, not a pretty weapon; he shoved aside the phantom odour of more serious guns and explosives, more dust and desert, more blood) to have much time to keep an eye on what became of Sherlock, never mind Mary. By the time he found him again – apparently arresting yet another guard, the outside one – the MI5 or whatever-they-were-in-suits-and-handguns had carted her off.
one (which of course made John curious as to just how much chatty birds were going for these days – what happened to good, old-fashioned budgies?). Sherlock had then enlisted John’s help in the frankly transparent task of ‘teaching the parrot Greek’ and a smattering of other languages to help Baker get back in his wife’s good books; this was, of course, entirely a ploy to see how much he could make John say. (John was about 80% that this had been the actual goal – but Sherlock was both juvenile and naïve enough to do something so sentimental unconsciously.)
‘Would you…’ He paused. This was asking for trouble, but… maybe it didn’t count, if he could postpone it until tomorrow? ‘Would it help, if we arranged a time to… to have sex? Gave us some space to wrap our heads around it?’
He felt hyper-aware of John’s presence, and tried to compensate for what was, to himself if to no one else, the magnetic pole of John’s completely normal and yet totally new body at his side. (He had spent nearly an hour while John was asleep mentally preparing himself for a number of scenarios for any future sexual encounter, varying based on John’s adventurousness and their access to a more palatable brand of lubricant.)
He’d forced himself to let go of Sherlock, smiling almost tipsily at Sherlock’s eyeroll, and to march himself to the surgery before he was later than he already was.
‘Tell him I’m already leaving,’ he responded quickly, raising his arm for a taxi. One drove immediately past. Delightful.
He almost never initiated kisses (dangerous), but, just for a moment, he allowed himself to revel in the rare instance of being able to give them both what they craved.

– underwater drowning him momentarily breathlessness – a boiling throbbing burn along his nerves, the surge of bile at the back of his throat. He knew that face. Knew her, as he had anticipated he would, by her smile.
‘He’ll live,’ John added, as if to remind them of the ultimate victory: the balance of justice meted. ‘He’ll live, and with this he’ll see trial.’
‘Friend with a drugs trafficking conviction, was he?’ Sherlock pressed. He was pushing too hard – he could tell already that, pathetic as he was, Ryder was no crooked mastermind; had no criminal record (or he would hardly have been hired at the hotel in the first place); and, worst of all, had allowed sentiment to blind him, to overtake his reason and lead him, like every other idiot on the planet, to do something catastrophically
Sherlock was clearly holding his tongue, looking into John’s eyes keenly; he was keeping himself, what he actually thought, behind a wall. It was
‘Shut up,’ John keened, thrusting up into Sherlock’s hands. They were breathing raggedly, as the slippery sensation of Sherlock’s hand along them both triggered every nerve. ‘Oh, fuck, just – Sherlock, you,’ his mouth angled upwards and met Sherlock’s as his hips lifted off the bed, and he groaned as Sherlock’s thumb flicked around the head of his cock and brought Sherlock’s cock up to meet his hand and, ‘
‘Damn it, Sherlock! I’m not doing this now. You need to have those stitches looked at, probably broke the skin and tore half of them out.’
‘You have no idea how amazing you are,’ John breathed into his ear, pulling aside his suddenly unbuttoned shirt to mouth at the same spot on his neck as before, and Sherlock opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling for lack of knowing what else to do. ‘I’m sorry, about – earlier.’
He was halfway to the sitting room before his eyes had even adjusted to the darkness. He paced until he couldn’t stand the sound of his own tread anymore.
John hadn’t moved back, only a few inches (a breath) of space between them; Sherlock felt crowded, overstimulated, suffocated by his implacable
As ever, the tags note the crimes this fic's baddie has perpetrated. All occurred in past and will *never* be shown in this fic, but just to be safe, the tags are there.
(He had gathered these facts in two sleepless nights four years ago, pouring over Italian and German newspapers which all conspicuously refused to report more than a column on the drowning. (The boy, a violinist who had been a keen amateur sailor and the sole, merely partial, witness, had been found dead in his rooms at the music conservatory of an alleged overdose four days after the woman.) His ears prickled. He wondered if John was impressed.)
‘James Horner,’ Peterson said, and John attempted to wrest his attention back to the case. ‘Arrested last night after being identified by several hotel staff members and Lady Braithwaite’s personal assistant as having been in the corridor doing plumbing maintenance at the time the diamond –’
while I was out of the picture. Mycroft kept me generally apprised of your status: Mike Stamford and the new clinic and that truly
A quick glimpse at the kitchen saw virtually nothing moved, except – John’s mouth quirked in satisfaction – a single dirty knife discarded beside the sink. Sherlock had
discussing recent escalations with Mycroft, no matter what extremes of torture his brother meted out) ‘I believe we both have work to attend to, so I will simply impress upon you that Lord Morcar would look very favourably indeed upon the person – or, persons,’ he conceded, with a delusional tip of his imaginary hat, ‘—who could return his family’s estimable heirloom.’
Contrary to any reasonable man’s actions, John took a solid step towards him. (This proximity, to any hypothetical onlooker, would connote…. intimacy.) John’s chest was still labouring slightly, but his stance was firm, unhesitating — waiting.
to the whole case that had driven John and, yes, himself, to the brink of what they could bear. More intellectually stimulating than locating jewels or trailing cheating husbands but... there was a price, too. One in a currency with which he was not familiar.)
. Every mediocre or empty previous sexual experience with quickies or tipsy fumbles that only got one person off or that ended with a guilty promise to call someone he had no intention of seeing again, whose presence outside the bedroom irked him — all of that was
Without even bothering to roll his eyes, Sherlock noted, ’It would be the perfect place to implement the plan.’
‘No,’ Mycroft sighed. ‘It’s what you think of yourself.’ He raised an eyebrow pointedly, then turned on his hideously under-scuffed shoes (no legwork) and made for the door. ‘Do have a care, Sherlock. Not all fences are as easily mended as those between you and Dr. Watson.’
‘Hardly pertinent tonight: we want to be seen and forgotten. And in any event, Captain, isn’t that more your area? “All the nice girls love a soldier”?’
Gaping for a moment at the jest that had now overflowed to sincere grievance, I wondered at his charge. ‘I was, I confess freely, approving of the speech made by Mr Morris to the Society some ten years ago, Holmes, but I was not… not experiencing anything like that…’ I hunted for an apposite word, ‘—
Now again, Sherlock was standing at the window, absent-mindedly tapping out something complicated with his fingers in midair as if tickling a fidgety ghost. With his other hand, though, he was stroking a half-lidded Flint, who was restless but leaning into his touch.
But John didn’t know, not fully, and today was not the day to enlighten him.) ‘I don’t think I’d ever heard Mr. Gresham beg someone to
.’ (Yep, confirmed). His toes were curled, grating along the loud leather of the sofa. ‘Fuck that’s good,
, he thought inwardly. But he kept walking, and, greeted by a brisk gust of early October chill, shut the door firmly behind him.
‘I didn’t specify “doctors”,’ Sherlock had corrected; he’d been thinking of family members, visitors, anyone with any access, really, and a moment of privacy… Then — he frowned at the nurse (one of the ‘shocked’ ones) who handed him a miniscule paper cup, purely as a vehicle for his midday pills: surely there was a less
‘Nice little garden, looks like,’ Suze added, pointing casually at the small — oh — the small side-entrance to the garden, between the Overground above and Numbers 43, 45, and 47 on the Square (though there wasn’t a square of municipal greenery nearer than five-sixths of a mile).
. Ha! I said, I’d do whatever they asked me to with the goat if I could have a million quid!’ She cackled merrily. John tried to look amused. ‘But any of us who actually have any of the
He blinked bovinely at them. ‘The effects? No, except as proof of my strange, rather sodden tale. But with my new friend Ovid here, I think I can let the past remain in the past. And now, I believe, I shall take my leave of you, and surprise Susan with a bottle of wine and our new family member.
‘I will,’ Sherlock vowed, and something in John’s gut flared hot and quick as he pieced this back together with his accidentally kinky show of hand, and he smirked so hard his teeth hurt.
‘So long as none of them thinks they now will be expected to join us in our home for punch and charades.’
‘Hey! Hey!’ shouted a short man coming from behind the counter with his arms outstretched as if to herd them back into the street. His thick Indian accent (Sherlock probably knew what town, never mind what province) was the same as on the interview tape Sherlock had purloined from Bradstreet yesterday. ‘You cannot come in! No customers! We are closed!’
With careful steps, Sherlock backtracked through the tableau flat, assembled in the billiard room of his Mind Palace, walking past the reminders of days of the week, relevant politicians’ statuses (front- and back-benchers who might conceivably be mid-scandal, and therefore likely to need his expertise), the fiction and nonfiction bestsellers list (another potential source of clients, or at least of crimes to be copied, affairs to be acted out by the desperate, the attention-seeking, the bored, or the personally unimaginative), and the usual other decorations to the main corridor. The water damage had long since been repaired, and he was able to walk under the main balcony now without a twinge in his chest, precisely the index of a knife.
. And to this John had fitted himself dexterously and repeated, in essence, the same declaration he had made the night before the 797 days of hell they’d spent apart:
‘Obviously you don’t want to tell me what it is that’s got under your skin. Which is fine. It’s up to you. But I’m just… you can, if you did want to. That’s all.’
(2005) and two genuine scholarly monographs on the influence of various kinds of varnish in Chinese versus Eastern and Western European pottery and printing in the late medieval/early Renaissance periods (2008), and
Eventually he went about stirring the beans on the hob while informing Molly, ‘Help yourself to any of this lot, obviously. Or if you’d prefer to play it safe, the cafe downstairs opens at seven.’
Nevertheless, in spite of the forms and formalities, a shiver prickled across the nape of his neck which had little to do with the truly ghastly architecture, and much more to do with the audacity of Gruener showing off, without fear or shame, his salacious choice of home décor. If the one ‘sensitive’ picture Sherlock had managed to examine in detail before Gruener entered the room was anything to go by, the entire room was essentially a boastful exhibition of depravity.
He had almost asked, for the first time in his life, for them to turn the volume of the EKG monitor on.
‘Of course,’ Bradstreet admitted with a sigh, placing his hands in his pockets, ‘but the other staff – the Countess’s PA, Catherine Cusack, the hotel’s assistant something-or-other, Ryder, the room service boy Thaw, the hotel’s plumber Huggins, all of 'em said they were surprised he had come back so late that evening to fix some vents. Felt a bit odd around him.’
Damoclean sword, or to the first time they’d met in a warehouse south of the river. John’s hands weren’t tremoring now either.
Thus: John was planning on getting himself/Sherlock/them/someone a dog. He either knew Sherlock knew and was playing with him, or was slightly inept at keeping secrets from him. (Equally plausible.) But he was, for now, for the most part, intending either the arrival of a specific dog or the launch of the conversation about really getting a potential one to be a secret.
John kicked the door shut behind himself, then inclined forward, kissing Sherlock, sucking his tongue in a way that he felt helpless to respond to except to sit on the bed which was suddenly behind his calves and take John with him. The weight of John on top of him, one knee on the mattress between his thighs, felt both soaringly new and vividly familiar, a continuation of the previous night, and suddenly Sherlock felt hot, overheated, frantic to find all the places of John’s body he hadn’t touched and remedy his oversight,
Before Sherlock had time to congratulate himself further, John shoved him none too carefully back against the open sitting room doorframe. ‘Shut up.’
excited’ for him to be ‘part of the team’ with details about a meeting ‘next week, if that suits you?’; and a second, earlier one…
‘Mycroft came on errand to keep us on the case.’ He lifted a finger and helped Flint off his shoulder and into her cage, where she stumbled briefly (she looked a pretty exhausted from the day’s excitement) before climbing to rest blearily on her perch. ‘I imagine she’ll be able to give us a better picture of her movements, and the staff’s, from last night.’
a hell Sherlock had all-too-infuriatingly anticipated. (Watson stubbornness, damning them all to fates they made for themselves.)
In the stark light of the bathroom, he waited while the water jumped, then eventually climbed in. The hot spray scalded his skin. Closing his eyes, he was glad of the opportunity to let his body drift fuzzily through the steps of shampoo, soap, and rinse, so he could concentrate on figuring out if they had just made a
Taking out his phone, Sherlock scrolled through a variety of society tabloids, getting a sense of Violet De Merville (Gruener’s fiancée and their purported charge) and how they might accomplish Damery’s task of separating the lovebirds. Considering the personal experience he had acquired in just the last twenty-four hours, it seemed the most effective way would be to let them be themselves and drive each other apart: so often the catalyst for a breakup (and from there, if previous patterns were any indicator, a murder).
‘Come on, Sherlock, come on, for me,’ he murmured, and Sherlock moaned and bowed up into his palm and came, hot and thick, between them, shuddering, until John couldn’t wait another second. Taking his hand to his own flies, he unzipped his jeans and wiggled his hand to free his own cock where it was possibly the hardest it had been since the previous best sex of his life, with the barwoman in Germany during his leave after a full year of nothing but his own hands in the desert. He winced at how close he was and with each pull of his slick hand (slick, he thought, and oh that brought a harsh groan up from his toes), his knuckles brushed Sherlock’s still heaving stomach just beneath him, above his legs which went on at least a mile even hitched around John. His head fell forward and he breathed in the sweat at Sherlock’s neck as he felt his orgasm close in.
Rolling his eyes dramatically, Sherlock returned (alas) to the case. ‘Gruener clearly fancies himself more than a distant operator, as seen by the complaints (or rather, lack of same) from the high turn-over of jockeys and trainers: no explanations. Same about the sudden “retirements” of three promising young horses. Virtual silence.’
, John.’ He took his chair, turning to Challa. ‘And you brought the bird here because you found the name of the owner but have not been authorised to track said person down, and do not wish to leave the bird unattended for a substantial amount of time.’
with everyone? He was fine — he didn’t need to go anywhere. ‘Piss off. Which reminds me — do you need to use the loo? I’m sure you could walk to the proper one, if you wanted.’
Missed breakfast (not that there was anything in, of course) in favour of a long shower. He’d needed one, waking up alone in their rank bed and already a Pavlovian response to Sherlock’s sheets kicked in — hence, a long, slow, dreamy shower, wondering if Sherlock could hear him, might join him, could keep him on the edge of pleasure until the hot water ran out… followed by no time left to shave, damn, damn, damn, he was very, very late. Couldn’t find the one brown tie that made this shirt (his last clean one) look somewhat decent. Hadn’t had time for coffee, and was now very late indeed for his very early shift. Only as he’d turned with his cursory survey to be sure he wasn’t leaving anything behind did he notice Sherlock, curled on the sofa, passed out in his clothes.
, in his blood and marrow, even though he sometimes forgot it, that he got to be the person he wanted to be when he stood next to Sherlock and helped those people.
bad: awkward, when the hotel he’d chosen hadn’t been all that nice in person, and even more so when Mary insisted on slagging off the French while they stood in a queue for some church or other, then
of the message flying from his hand straight (well, to a signal tower, conglomeration of satellites, second tower, and then straight) to John’s hand was intoxicating. And infuriating.
He spent the rest of the day (standing) ordering every relevant exhibition book, catalogue raisonné, monograph, scholarly journal, art studio starter’s guide, and ‘crackpot’ self-published collector’s memoir he could find across the internet — paid for, of course, by the handsome advance they’d taken off Damery’s annoyingly concealed downpayment.
‘And yet, needs must.’ Sherlock hopped up and swept himself off to his bedroom before John could say anything more, followed after a minute by the clanging of the pipes.
With a robust squeeze of Sherlock’s thigh, John’s expression became a very subtle, conspiratorial smirk. ‘Thanks. For coming. I know it’s not…’ He shrugged, then looked at Sherlock’s now-melted muddle of ice cubes. Just then, a cheer went up — someone had scored, or not scored, or passed out, or wet themselves, or something equally puerile.
The words were out of his mouth — Molly giggled and went on with setting up her laptop, so he assumed she hadn’t really thought anything of it, or anything more than a sarcastic turn of phrase — but Sherlock’s cheeks had gone very, very faintly pink, as had the dip of his jugular notch.
‘Bed,’ Sherlock instructed, flipping off the light switch and looking down at him in the dark with all the looming silhouette of a massive heron glaring down at a fish.
‘Yeah,’ John replied through a haze, ‘five hours in the last twenty-four. And let’s not forget the panic attack portion of the last hour.’
Feeling the strong-arm was perhaps a little too strong, John cut in, ‘We’re not the police. We don’t think you killed him.’
‘Of course,’ Baker agreed solemnly, as though asked to sign legally-binding agreements about the ownership of bird poop was pretty ordinary business. He skimmed the paper and scribbled his signature.
The pause as John staggered off the bed, almost dizzy, to shuck his clothes unintentionally gave Sherlock a moment to bury his head in his pillow. (‘If there were anything I didn’t want from you, John, you would know’, he’d said that first time, on the sofa… but John wasn’t sure he believed him.) Quick as he could, John discarded shirt and pants, dug the lube — damn, he’d forgotten to bring the new one upstairs — and condoms (thankfully, plenty left in this box) from the gap between the mattress and headboard. All this took less than fifteen seconds, but he couldn’t help but notice the tension creep back into Sherlock’s body.
'You seem sweet, and a beautiful woman like you, with a father worth as much as your father is... You know better than I do the kinds of men that go for that: the whole package. And so what I don't understand is how you aren't curious —'
He stood carefully (Ovid mimed a slide-whistle), took down three separate volumes from the upper-right of his haphazard-seeming (but of course meticulously organised) bookshelf, and handed them to John. As he ripped, one-handed, into the seeds he intended to use as rewards, and grabbed a handful to put on the table, John made a noise of derision. ‘You’re serious? Greek and Latin, and French?’
‘Stop, stop,’ John laughed. He contorted quickly, managing not – though it was tempting – to knee Sherlock in the balls in the process, dipping and freeing his now even
They carried on trading messages in snatches when John waited for his next patient to return from the loo. Only when he peered down at his screen mid-sentence at handing over the paperwork they needed signed by the droning middle-aged insurance salesman who had done a number on his elbow by smacking it on a roulette table over the weekend (which also went a ways to explaining his gaunt face and edginess about paying for pain medication), did he see something that surprised him.
Not waiting for Sherlock to produce his phone, John turned to the man squirming like a maggot and moaning incoherently on the floor, squatting and looking beneath the trembling hands to see the curdled, corroded skin, poppy-bright with slithers of wet where the acid – or whichever solution she had used – had burned straight through the skin. (It would, he noted logically, make a good (if malodorous) experiment.)
Sherlock looked up. John wasn’t holding a ring, or even on one knee (good, he would groan to get back to his feet and then feel self-conscious for his bodily needs). He was just… gazing at Sherlock. Smiling at him, eyes gone soft and reverent and a blue Sherlock couldn’t classify.
‘God,’ John pushed the curls flat back (up/down) against the top of Sherlock’s forehead with a steady solid hand, ‘you’re such a bastard.’ His long nose slotted alongside Sherlock’s, hands sliding over Sherlock’s shirt down over his shoulderblades, his sensitive ribs, his hips, pressing Sherlock unimaginably closer, friction rocking them both like flint, sparking, urgent, sharp, ‘—fuck, c’mon, help me get these
‘I find that my physical reactions towards you are seldom, in retrospect, what I would call “wise choices”…’
‘It’s unclear how much there is to know,’ he replied, which was as close as he could physically stand to saying he had no more information than John did about what had become of her. He stepped back, giving them each a moment to regather themselves (John sighed again behind him, steadying). ‘I didn’t arrange for her to be extracted in conjunction with my…’ — It was important that John trust that he hadn’t been involved. That, things being different, even had he arrived to find John mid-proposal, he would not have stopped it happening purely for his own benefit. (He hoped, though did not exactly trust, that he would someday find the inner resources to let John go, when the day came that he finally asked.) — ‘… my return. It was, improbably, a coincidence.’
?), John continued talking through the sequence of events. ‘Then, after leaving her dinner party early feeling ill, she comes home, finds the place robbed, realises the stone is missing, and phones the hotel security who ring the police.’
‘Besides,’ John added, ‘if we don’t get anything concrete tonight, there’s still time for them to pick him up in the morning. Make it look like he disappeared.’
at holding your drink. The day after we could go for a walk through Regent’s Park, and you could show off for me and I could pretend not to notice how much you admire the kids when they find good hiding places in the flowerbeds even though their parents will tell them off. We could… We could have a kid of our own, someday, a little clever thing that made you tell her Victorian ghost stories, or dragged you to Bart’s to meet Molly so he could learn how to prepare his own slides.’ His thick murmur wavered for a second, stumbling at the shock on Sherlock’s face, but he quickly went on. ‘Or not. We could take care of Mrs. Hudson if and
Very little of this could not have been said a year previous, or at any point of the first period of his and John’s cohabitation. Changes, therefore, were in the details: it was, after all, an axiom he stood by, that the supposedly ‘little things’ were infinitely the most important.
By early afternoon when he clocked off, he was roaring to go invade whatever bunker they had to to find and help those young women, then go back to bed (to Sherlock).
The house fit in with the rest of its fellows along the road, just to their left. The windows had been replaced, though — within the last two years —, with
,’ he growled, and thrust his hand below Sherlock’s waistband to grip his cock before he could overthink it. With relief and at least five degrees’ increase on his body temperature John found Sherlock hard and hot in his palm. He ran his thumb along his length causing Sherlock’s hips to stutter back into the sofa before jumping up into John’s grasp for more. Hungrily, John managed to shove Sherlock’s trousers down to his thighs and nearly came then and there at the sight of his hips, his cock, his dark wiry hair, the flushed naked plane of skin from his collarbone to his knees.
couldn’t find their way out of with a map. Now we’re here to help and you’re saying you want us to go for a walk?’
‘And yet, needs must.’ Sherlock hopped up and swept himself off to his bedroom before John could say anything more, followed after a minute by the clanging of the pipes.
‘“These two latter things are, indeed, the only absolutely necessary gift that we should claim of art. The picture-book is not, perhaps, absolutely necessary to man’s life, but it gives us such endless pleasure, and is so intimately connected with the other absolutely necessary art of imaginative literature that it must remain one of the very worthiest things towards the production of which reasonable men should strive.”’
‘No, but.’ (A rasp on the carpet as John shifted his stance.) ‘Surely you have places more private than our sitting room.’
A  woman in slightly too-small magenta scrubs ducked her head around the door smiling. ‘You rang, Dr. Watson?’
And he felt certain, characterised by a growing prickling at the back of his neck (nothing to do with Flint, who was currently balancing on one leg on the handle of their (hideous) mod-era yellow lamp, echoing Sherlock’s tunes), that John was working up to a speech along the lines of ‘carried away’ and ‘moving too fast’, while Sherlock was plucking notes from his violin and muttering to himself in order to give himself something to do rather than tear his own hair out at the madness of ‘too fast’.
After what felt like hours, after John had taken a sip of water, washed his plate, cutlery, cup, hands,
He could almost see the sparks of arousal shooting across Sherlock’s face, through his arms and legs, down to his fingers which twitched, and pupils that blew hungrily. God, this was a bad —
Sherlock eyed St Clair icily, bitterness on his tongue. But he held it, in deference to John who was not there, and nodded once, to one or all of them. He hardly cared. Again he looked at his fists and waited while they took the unwashed man away.
‘Your concern is touching, Mycroft, but I am fortunately still able to say that I am if nothing else
‘So, when you said,’ interrupting the silence, since he heard at last Sherlock’s peculiar kind of stillness standing just beyond the threshold, ‘you didn’t know who had attacked you – the person who… who’d
He quite agreed. (But why was she uncertain? Which ‘nonsense’ precisely? They were quite plainly present, and for the most part accounted for. Was she… disappointed in him for getting injured? (He was unimpressed with his own combat skills, so quickly atrophied after over two years honing them in more dire circumstances than a bright but overcast alley off Camberwell.) Was she… The strain of trying to interpret the infinity of uncertainties that might plague his affectionate but currently hovering and therefore unwelcome housekeeper was already exhausting him.) He shut his eyes.
Sherlock had felt his nostrils flare. This was… inconvenient. In his peripheral thoughts, Sherlock had already been halfway to Kingston (by the time they reached Waterloo, the commuter traffic would have died down considerably, making it far easier to get a cab: it was — he thought briefly — Monday; good). But John uncharacteristically dragging his feet presented an unusual impediment to his careening thoughts.
He smiled minutely at the picture of Sherlock, forced to play by the book and do his own bloody clean-up after a case. He hoped Bradstreet would add to their growing album of such unusual moments.
‘That was organised, you know,’ chided John, breathless, while Sherlock opened the lubricant to squeeze a glob into his palm.
The film was what was probably deemed a dark comedy, considering the verbal abuse several of the characters were hurling at the man with the stammer, and the fact of the criminal scheme at the heart of it, but Sherlock found himself sufficiently entertained to stay awake. John, of course, was… more than sufficiently amused by the time the familiar-sounding English actor screaming to find his wife (an actress not entirely succeeding at a posher accent than her natural speaking voice) rather than his duplicitous mistress in the study.
‘Dinner?’ John asked, recalling Sherlock to this present. ‘Are you eating? Though…’ he looked around, taking in the sitting room more fully for the first time, ‘I take it we’ll have to find somewhere that would allow you to bring five massive books to the table?’
Unstoppably, Mycroft went on, ‘He allegedly has other, shall we say, agents in his service, presumably not all of whom can be categorically dismissed as buffoons. You are aware of the incidents in Paris…?’
‘And this is what is become of Sherlock Holmes: the great vigilante house-breaker? the Raffles of Scotland Yard?’
The man (recreational drug user, non-(cigarette)smoker) chuckled. ‘Yeah, I know, mate. Well, if you need to stretch your legs and that, go ahead. Can’t see you when the lights are on in there and it’s as dark as this out here.’
Of that, at least, Sherlock was more certain, though he doubted he would enjoy being the messenger in this case. ‘Not entirely.’
Holmes’s left arm draped across the back of the sofa, coaxing me to relax into it. ‘You were distracted.’
A while later a rustle of sheets and limbs from the bedroom signalled just in time: he turned to turn and catch the sight of a bleary-eyed, tousle-haired consulting detective awakening to the world after a full fifteen hours dead to man and beast.
‘Ha,’ he coughed an awkward laugh (today was a parade of them, apparently), getting to his feet, suddenly very grateful his sister had never subjected him to long girlish conversations about her dating life (or his, for that matter). ‘Right, well, thanks, Beth. I’ll see you later, yeah?’
composed of the blurry-close tableau of him. Said, in a murmur, ‘I’m never bored with you.’ The room itself seemed to be echoing the same words from another conversation, years previous. But Sherlock finally spoke the nettle-barbed point he’d been biting back since John’s declaration of several days ago:
Sherlock sat up and wiped his flushed stretched mouth on John’s shed vest. He tried not to think about digestive acids, gag reflexes, whether some part of John would find a way to be broken down and reused as proteins to keep Sherlock alive.
ed at that, so Sherlock slipped deeper into his seat to allow his head to rest against John’s shoulder.
The kettle popped, and he was very happy to turn away from his brother’s convoluted face with its trivializing condescension aimed at him.
Refusing to release his mouth, Sherlock slid his hands with singeing slowness up to John’s neck and then down, fingers slipping beneath his dressing gown to peel it deliberately down his arms. John shivered and leaned further into Sherlock’s body heat, shuffling out of the gown so that it pooled at his waist while his hands dragged up along Sherlock’s shirt to press, forearms to fingertips, along Sherlock’s neck and shoulders. The resulting impatient huff from Sherlock’s nose spiked desire fresh in his stomach.
John had suddenly popped onto his toes and bestowed a swift, firm kiss. On him. In the middle of the wide, currently well-populated avenue of Regent’s Park under a baking summer sun.
‘Sergeant Challa must have clocked off early,’ he cut in smoothly. ‘Mrs. Hudson will have let her in before going to tea with Mrs. Evans.’ Sherlock strode over to the desk, apparently to put his pen back in the drawer on his side, but (John saw) his fingers traced lingeringly over a scuff where the cage had been.
Then Sherlock’s hand rested lightly along his jaw, his callused fingers worrying the soft place below John’s left ear, and John fractured into a thousand pieces –
Force of habit: John walked her to the lift (a little ridiculous since the room, big enough since they had it to themselves, was only a few steps away).
to be happy,’ John insisted, in a lower, more broken voice still, coming close and looking at Sherlock, whose were eyes much too bright and jaw much too tense. ‘I want to
might have been comic – a slimy tendril of lettuce was dangling from his sole, dripping god knew what onto a square of gauze that had browned with rainwater and what he viscerally hoped was not old blood – had it not also reeked. He replaced his shoe. ‘Great.’
For a moment, as he observed John glaring at the long black bag, he considered the possibility that John would refuse to go.  Perhaps he truly had crossed some critical line, either last night or with this (rented, but certainly good quality) presumption, and now John was already subconsciously disentangling himself from their current arrangement. He’d scarcely let himself imagine things getting even this far.
‘So,’ he tried, because they had been sitting in silence for more than a solid minute now and he supposed it was his turn. ‘This is a pretty decent step up from my usual takeaway sandwich.’
the vice-tight whorl of Sherlock’s body, an action, probably more than his words, that well and truly shattered Sherlock’s breath into accelerating snatches.
They were sitting on the floor, dishes messily opened across the coffee table and wafting mouth-watering scents all through the flat. Sherlock, naturally, had eaten two fried dumplings, wiped his hands on a cloth napkin he produced from nowhere, and then went on comparing something from the book open on his knee to the laptop settled on the floor in front of him.
‘I have been approached by a would-be patron of yours, one who had hoped to discuss a pressing matter with you both in the… relative privacy of Baker Street. If it’s not too much trouble.’
Sherlock slowly, planted his feet on the floor, still perched on the edge of the bed. His everycolour eyes sparkled in the reflected hallway light.
He felt pliable, warm, tired, and… he turned his face into Sherlock’s shoulder and smirked. If people had talked before… ‘Well,’ he muttered, to the ceiling.
