"What the hell?" Donovan asked amidst the din of the police sirens approaching. So the barricades had been lifted as well. That didn't make sense unless it was an order, but from who?
He frowned. It was a drawing made by a small child, with three figures: one tall, with a black squiggle on his head pretending to be dark curly hair, dressed in a sort of dark toga almost down to his feet. Another a little shorter, with a yellow squiggle resembling blond hair, dressed in something resembling a hideous jumper. The smaller one had the same yellow scrawl, with the difference that the hair was longer, trying to reproduce a shoulder-length mane.
After a while, they reached the river. To reach the meadow where John planned to spend the day, they had to cross it using a path of stones created for that purpose. It wasn’t too deep, but the doctor didn’t want to come back with a bunch of sneezing kids due to the cold water.
Something I was supposed to know by now, but my parents rejected Harry so much for being a lesbian, were so cruel to her, I convinced myself it was wrong to be bi.
Because John had the same almost absent-minded look as always, like wondering what was he doing there, his hands in his pockets, the kind and open gesture, everything as before as if he wasn't the
Sherlock shook his head. He had only recently learned to swim, but he still didn't feel completely safe and didn't want to move beyond where his feet were still touching the bottom. He decided to join Rosie when John started teaching her to swim. John agreed and taught them both, the girl with the innate confidence of children in the water, the detective almost having a heart attack when his daughter broke loose from the pool edge and went into the water. With patience (tons, kilotons to deal with a soaked, grumpy, nervous, and insecure detective totally out of his element), he managed to get them both to end up swimming freely.
John shouted a “YES!”, raised his arms in victory and ran around the table, like an athlete doing the lap of honour, weaving his hand, greeting an invisible crowd around him, throwing kisses to the air.
Irene Adler helped Rosie to wear bib jeans with a bee drawn on them. Under the bee, the dungarees had a tracking device attached to them that would allow Sherlock to locate the girl wherever she was. She did so quickly, but carefully, while the girl watched with her eyes wide open the security personnel' runs to position themselves around the door and defend the mansion.
"The Necronomicon", also known as "The book of the dead" is a fictional grimoire (textbook of magic) appearing in stories by the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.
This time John found it curious. Usually, his visions of Sherlock were static, and he rarely smiled. But he assumed that, in his subconscious, he knew that the detective was grateful to him for coming to his defense, even though it was too late.
Geena cleared her throat, looking behind her back. John turned and saw Rosie, looking at the three of them inquisitively, frowning, Sherlock’s book in her little hands. Geena and Bart moved to the kitchen.
"For not letting me fuck you before... you know how wonderful your arse is? God, I could come right now..."
The next morning in the cottage, when I woke up, he was at my side with some ropes and a blindfold in his hands. We had practiced bondage before and, though I didn’t enjoy it very much, I knew he did. He kissed me softly and said that he wanted to try something new he was sure I would like.
"Jooooooooooohn, no!" shouted Sherlock, running after the doctor, straight to the portal. Ironman pushed him, slamming the detective against the wall. Grunting in pain, he rose again, but Ironman flew at him, pinning him down.
There, cornered by two zombies, Molly brandished a Nordic walking stick, horror written in her face.
An hour and a half later, there were the three of them, Sherlock, with the air of a condemned scaffold walk for not managed to keep them on the private beach and Rosie chatting non-stop about what she was going to do that day.
"No, John, no" there was a mix of a bit panic and arousal in Sherlock's voice, his head turned toward John, tracking his movements, pulling again from the ropes with all his strength, all his muscles tensed, for both Greg and John enjoyment "Please, no, no, no, John."
A VIP hostess left the building and waited at the foot of the van. She smiled as Lestrade stepped out of it, slightly embarrassed by the onlooker's large crowd the display was gathering around them. A second later, a stiff, haughty, and completely calm Mycroft got out of the van.
He found himself sat on a chair in what seemed an ancient living room, the walls covered with shelves full of old books.
The sentence "Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself, but talent instantly recognizes genius" appears in "The Valley of Fear". Actually in the book it's Watson who says it, but I thought it was a great way to praise John and to explain why he saw in Sherlock what anyone couldn't.
John emitted a strangled scream, pinned down Sherlock's head, as he continued to thrust brutally, groaning Sherlock's name over and over like a mantra as his orgasm hit him. He pushed his hips one last time, holding them there and came down his throat, while his body shivered with the intensity of the orgasm, increased with the feeling of Sherlock wantonly swallowing every drop of his hot come.
Two of the prisoners were searching the tents, throwing out everything they found inside, undoubtedly looking for money. They had pulled out three of them from their fixation, and Sherlock glared at Rosie’s stuffed bumblebee, half-buried in the mud. The other two fugitives stayed in the shed, eating and chatting.
"Yeah, they're like two schoolgirls. They tell each other everything," he gritted his teeth at the new prick of the needle. "That gave me the idea. Gregory has a great sense of ethics, and he cares for you very much. I knew that lie would make him rethink our relationship and leave me. That's why I told him that bullshit about how I enjoyed watching how you got beaten up in Serbia. I knew it would turn his stomach".
Too late. When Steve brushed against his girlfriend's, the ghostly hand transformed into a rope that wrapped around his arm. With a firm tug, she pulled Captain America from the shield, throwing him against the other ghosts of his past, who rushed at him like piranhas, while the orange ball vanished, leaving them at the mercy of the spirits.
"There's something I don't understand." said Mycroft, trying to divert attention. He turned to Sholto "cookies, avocado..."
“We’ll go with you” Lestrade suggested. ”It would be good to see the crime scene before Anderson destroys it with his shoes.”
The doctor guided Greg's finger inside Sherlock to the spot, and when the DI caressed it, he was rewarded with the same sound, this time a bit more desperate.
"And what do you think would have happened if you would have told me about Anthony?" Lestrade asked, gently, looking at Mycroft's eyes.
When they broke the hug, some kids started whispering in an imperative tone to Mike, who shook his head. Finally, his face brilliant with blush, he approached John and gave him something.
"We were over it. It was hard for both of us to get over it, but we made it, and you came along and ruined everything. Fix this, Mycroft," growled Sherlock. "I don't care how, but fix it."
“Donovan, if I were you, I would go for a brain CT scan or something. Sherlock Holmes is not real. He is the protagonist of John Watson's novels.”
When all the treatments were over, the woman who had carried them to the rooms reappeared with forms on her arm.
"Surely what? That there's some logical reason? He fucking promised me! He looked me in the eye, and he promised me! For Rosie and me! How...?"
“I know, but I don’t need a medical degree to bring him to the house and call the ambulance and the van”.
“No! I swear it, John, you can get me tested! But I knew sooner or later…, so I realized the only way to end with all of it was to face him. I didn’t want you to know what… happened for him or for anybody else, so this is why I… mentioned it. Nobody could locate him. Even I was unable to do it. So I had to bring him out and exposing myself was the only to achieve it. You wouldn’t have allowed me to do it".
“If only were my ribs…” chuckled Sherlock “I should write in your blog about how goddamn amazing is sex with you”.
He wasn’t sure about what to do. On the one hand, he couldn’t let the kids by themselves. On the other, a gang of criminals was hidden in the shed, but maybe only for a few hours, and they will escape. He cursed for not having his phone. Trust in the Yarders as capable of following the criminals to the shed was as futile as the children's hopes to see the fallow deer.
Strange smiled smugly, and Tony rolled his eyes, while Natasha and Steve chuckled, shaking their heads.
And Sherlock obeyed, wondering why he was unable to disobey John’s commanding tone. Because he knew it was about John. Any other who would try to manhandle him like that would already be smashed against the wall or the floor, at the very least with his arm twisted by the elbow, to discourage him from keeping on giving orders to Sherlock. But all of his rebel nature dissolved at John’s side, feeling his body, listening to his voice, a strange and unknown pleasure flooding inside him as he let himself go and comply with the doctor’s orders.
Donovan, Anderson, and the others moved to make room for him around the table, warmly greeting him. John seemed delighted to be again at the pub. Dimmock brought him a chair, and the doctor climbed on it, his movements almost as fluid as always.
He needn't tell Sherlock there was something special between him and Mike, the detective figured it out himself. John and Mike were not in love; he never felt for him the way he felt for Sherlock. Still, there was a very special connection between them, reinforced by sharing dangerous situations, long nights on call, surveillance missions, and nights of sex which Sholto joined from time to time and, if he was drunk enough, Bill.
"Yes, and you've had the brilliant idea to get out of the country, which you know I can't protect you. Stupid as always, little brother," Mycroft hissed, not letting Greg answer.
"No, not an argument," answered the DI distractedly, making some of them giggle a bit, others coughing to conceal the giggling.
John slowly ducked until his ass touched the tip of Sherlock's cock. The detective moaned as John grabbed his cock, to hold it firmly while, with the other hand resting on the detective's chest, he slowly lowered himself, inserting the tip of the cock into his already lubricated hole.
"Only in a metaphorical way. The fact is that you do everything you can think of to attract the doggie to go with you, but he doesn't pay you attention".
John looked at them in amazement and glanced at Sherlock, who just shrugged. Then the doctor's gaze fell on Mycroft, and his tired, aching gesture turned into infinite fury. The doctor broke loose from Sherlock and lunged at Mycroft, intending to punch him.
The doctor remained motionless until, slowly, he began to put his shoes on. If Mrs. Hudson had grown old, John was not even a shadow of his former self. He was only emptiness, sorrow, grieving, desolation, and misery... Unlike Mrs. Hudson, he didn't shed a single tear. He was not able to. He had so much pain inside that he couldn't even cry.
"There's no better place. That woman scares even Mycroft Holmes. But call me in case you need something, okay? I don't want to scare you, but now Rosie vanished, they could try to get you, to know where she is."
But, for the DI, the worst of all was that not even Mycroft answered his calls. Before, any alarm about John and Sherlock was quickly subdued with a phone call to scary Sherlock’s older brother, who used to know exactly where they were, what happened or was able to assure that the doctor and the sleuth were fine. But currently, he had nothing of that.
"You made him think you wanted to make up for telling him about the restaurant. You knew that John felt so bad about it that he would do anything to redeem himself. Saving Mike, he would redeem himself in both my and in his eyes. That's why he accepted it almost blindly, giving it all up, turning a deaf ear to my warnings".
Sherlock gaped. They were in a spacious wooden cottage, the fire from the large fireplace lit, providing a gentle warmth to the room. The lights were off, the place only illuminated, besides the fire, by hundreds of candles set on the walls' projections, which gave the room an intimate, cozy, and romantic touch.
"Toy Story!" cried Rosie, clapping her hands, enthusiastically, as John and Sherlock bowed, taking off their hats. John gave Rosie hers. Sherlock put it back on and walked to the kitchen to prepare three glasses of orange juice, followed by John.
John stretched the detective's arms and put his wrists together, covering each of them with a small towel so that the ropes would not hurt his skin when he tied them together tightly.
He took Sherlock again in his mouth, from time to time pushing himself all the way down to the base of Sherlock's cock, and held himself there, making Sherlock crying with moans.
"She had a hard time keeping it a secret. But she achieved to do it. The idea was giving you a puppy for Rosie's birthday, but Marnie told me yesterday that this big boy arrived at one of the shelters. He's a year and a half old so that he will get along perfectly with Merlin".
Sherlock took a shuddering breath and opened his eyes again, only to find himself confronted with more darkness. “I still can’t see, John,” he spluttered, his voice breaking on the last syllable. He sounded so weak, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. The relief he had felt earlier had evaporated. It had only been a dream.
,” John said pointedly, “I also got you a sandwich. A croissant is nowhere near enough to keep you alive.”
John let out the breath he had been holding. “Will his vision return?” As soon as the words were out of his mouth he wanted them back, already knowing what the doctor's answer was going to be. He felt his heart sink into the pit of his stomach.
he had told someone. His brother, convinced of his own superiority, never respected Sherlock’s ability to make his own decisions, never respected him enough to leave him alone. Sherlock let the breath out and shifted his gaze from the roses. He knew there was no use wasting his energy thinking about his idiotic brother.
John’s stomach seized. “The only thing, huh?” He was hurt and Sherlock seemed to sense it though he couldn’t see.
He made to take a step toward the door, but something held him back. Some tiny, albeit unignorable, part of him told him to put an end to this cowardly act and rush back up the stairs, confront the enigma of a man whom he quite frankly couldn’t live without and have a serious discussion about the importance of communication in a relationship. But another part was shatteringly exhausted from trying to keep up a cheerful and sanguine front, tired of pretending that he was unaffected by the sudden change in the previously effortless dynamic between them, and that part of him itched to escape the oppressive silence of the flat, even if just for a little while.
In the comparing between all the sounds that John had ever heard in his life, this was undoubtedly, he thought, the most perfect one—the steady beep of the heart monitor that told him the one thing he longed to hear, the one thing he so desperately needed to hear.
Gasping for air, John snapped back to reality, noticing that he had been holding his breath. He needed air. He needed to breathe.
“Sherlock. No,” John told him firmly, the determination in his voice surprising him. “You need to rest, and I'll make sure you do. Greg can wait. And so can the case.” It wasn't a request. It was a demand.
“India pale ale, from Fuller’s Brewery, I believe,” he began, irritation bleeding into his tone. He sniffed the air with an exaggerated lift of his chin. “Ah, and whisky. Single malt. Not one but two—no, three glasses. A pub night with the
It would be lost like his ability to look into a microscope. He would never again be able to hunch over his microscope to conduct chemical analyses. Never again would he look through the lens and examine crime scene samples. He would struggle to perform even simple tasks, let alone conduct detailed experiments. Studying the chemical composition of substances, such as tobacco ash, would be much more difficult—someone might say impossible, but Sherlock was certain he would find a way. And if he didn’t, Sherlock thought, at least John wouldn’t mind. He had always found his experiments ridiculous, anyway.
The worst thing was that John knew he was telling the truth; there was nothing else to do now but wait. “I know,” John said tiredly, pinching the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger, “I know.”
I'd also like to remind you that I'm not a native English speaker, so pointing out errors is more than welcome.
And he ran, stumbling through the thick fog blurring his mind, his racing heart pounding loudly in his ears. He could almost feel the blood rushing through his veins as he ran and ran, up endless stairs and along unending corridors, not knowing where he was heading.
John wake to the sound of the rain battering against the window pane. When he opened his eyes, he became aware of his surroundings, and any lingering hope that the day before had been nothing but a bad dream evaporated into thin air. John saw the walls of the hospital room around him in the pale beam of light leaking under the door, and he could feel his heart plummet into the depths of his stomach as his worry returned to weigh heavily on his chest, constricting uncomfortably around his lungs.
And in case of the improbable event that John did choose to stay, it would be out of compassion and courtesy—he was always so empathetic, babbling with clients, patting them on the shoulder, mollifying them, flashing a gentle smile, balancing out Sherlock’s harshness and bluntness; and so respectful, his kindness going hand-in-hand with his flawless decorum and high moral standards—and out of his unwavering commitment to Sherlock, of course, not because he really wanted to.
Sherlock closed his eyes briefly. He stood on both feet, his dark blue dressing gown hanging loosely around his slim body, which had grown even thinner during the past week, his pyjama bottoms dragging low on his waist. His face needed shaving, his hair wasn’t immaculately coiffed as usual, his curls a dishevelled mess on top of his head, standing in awkward clumps. John couldn’t help but notice the coffee stain on his white T-shirt, standing out like blood on snow. Sherlock could be so vain and pedantic, and John knew that he would never intentionally wear dirty clothes. Knowing that Sherlock was unaware of the coffee stain made his chest feel tight. John didn’t have the heart to point it out. Instead, he made a mental note to remove the stain later when Sherlock abandoned the shirt somewhere in the house.
“I’m here, Sherlock,” John said calmly, stroking Sherlock’s hand, listening as his heartbeat gradually returned to normal.
Absentmindedly massaging his left shoulder, he let his gaze wander leisurely around the room, as though to ensure that nothing had changed since he had drifted into unconsciousness the night before with his chest pressed against the other man’s back. He remembered, with a swell of fondness, feeling the man’s chest inflating and deflating under his touch as he listened to the sound of their breathing slowing down and eventually falling into a synchronous rhythm, their lungs expanding and compressing in unison like accordions following the tempo set by a conductor.
His body felt heavy and sore, but he didn’t mind: the dull ache at the base of his spine and the throbbing pain in his inner thighs served as pleasant reminders of the night before—the needy gasps and shameless thrusts, the breathless whispers and groping fingers—and of the man he had the good fortune to share his bed, and more importantly, his life with. The thought that this maddeningly gorgeous man was his partner stirred a sense of mingled affection, possessiveness, and adoration in him and made him want to protect him from all the deranged lunatics and psychotic serial killers that they encountered due to the man’s self-created profession. John knew that he was an adult man—even though he sometimes acted like a grown-up child—and perfectly capable of taking care of himself, yet he couldn’t quite shake off the protectiveness that made him want to follow him everywhere like an anxious first-year medical student shadowing a physician. It was partly because, the man, for all his intellect and acumen, could be foolishly reckless, having nearly gotten himself killed several times due to being too self-confident and arrogant to realise that even he was fallible, and partly because John couldn’t bear the thought of losing him. It was something he tried not to think about, but despite his best efforts, there was a lingering uneasiness that kept nagging at the edges of his consciousness, a feeling he had learned to regard as an inevitable side-effect of being in love with the irresponsible madman.
Despite the people around him, he felt more alone than he had ever before. He felt more alone than he had on that cold November night, lying on his bathroom floor, cocaine pumping through his veins. More alone than on that miserably hot August afternoon when he had come home from school, only to realise that Redbeard was gone for good. More alone than he had felt hiding in the locker room on his sixteenth birthday, throbbing pain in his nose, blood running from his nostrils, the word "freak" echoing in his head.
The only voice he wanted, hoped to hear, was John's. And he hoped, hoped so much, that John would come to him, wind his strong arms around him and talk to him in his beautiful voice. His voice was always so warm and gentle that Sherlock felt like he would melt if he listened to it too long. His every word was filled with so much affection and love that Sherlock's heart felt as if it would burst out of his chest.
John let his mouth curve into a smile as he listened to the soft sound of his breathing. John wanted to reach out and touch him, to caress his cheek and feel the slight stubble that had begun to form on his chin, stroke his curls away from his forehead, run his fingers lightly over his cheek. He had an unbearable need to touch him, to kiss him, to hold him, but he contained himself, not wanting to wake him. As much as he already missed hearing his deep baritone voice, John knew that Sherlock needed the rest.
I do? He wanted to recite every swear word known to humankind, feel every word squeezing out of his tightened throat, let everyone know how miserable he was. But he remained silent, willing himself to calm down, his eyes still locked on the cup. Take a deep breath, calm down, John reminded himself, letting the coffee-scented air tickle his nostrils and fill his lungs as he closed his eyes while raising his eyebrows. He had to keep calm for Sherlock’s sake. Jesus. He was a man, a
John swallowed to get rid of the lump forming in his throat, nodded and motioned for her to continue.
Sherlock swallowed. “I—“ he inhaled shakily and then blurted out, “I can’t sleep without you.” He sounded suddenly so shy, so afraid, his voice barely above a whisper, and John couldn’t help but stare blankly at Sherlock’s face for a few seconds, letting his words sink in. He licked his lips, his mouth feeling suddenly dry.
I want to thank you for your sweet comments, kudos, bookmarks, and subscriptions. I'm lucky to have received such a positive response :)
“You’re quite free to do whatever you want, John. You don’t have to feel obligated to stay or, in fact, do anything. I’m quite capable of taking care of myself and I most definitely do not need you to mollycoddle me,” he said flatly. “Consider yourself dismissed.” He tried to feign indifference, but his attempt fell short of the mark, the quiver in his voice belying the nonchalant look on his face.
But it wasn't a nightmare. And John couldn't bring himself to say anything to comfort Sherlock, so he remained silent.
Sherlock continued to look suspicious, but he didn’t say anything, for which John was thankful, and instead took a bite of his sandwich, chewing it thoughtfully.
P.S. I have a big exam coming up in a few weeks, so I might not be able to update until then. But don't worry, I'll be back as soon as I can! Take care. XX
“John,” Sherlock whispered, but he sounded weak and strangled, and there was something against his mouth that muffled his voice—an oxygen mask. He tried to raise his hand to his face to remove it, but John stopped him.
“Two coffees, please, and,” John began, but was interrupted by the sound of his mobile phone beeping. “Er, excuse me.” Giving the man an apologetic smile, he fished his mobile out of his pocket, and opened the message.
Sherlock could already hear how his mind palace would crumble into dust, the explosion tearing down the walls of his most heavily guarded room, shattering the memories he had so carefully stored, leaving only darkness and suffocating dust behind.
It had been a week and they had already become strangers to each other. John didn’t know how he could miss someone who was just one door away. He missed the late nights, watching crap telly until one of them, usually John, fell asleep, Sherlock’s witty remarks and the way he shouted at the screen; he missed the good morning kisses, Sherlock’s lips on his cheek, his on top of Sherlock’s head, his warm skin against his just before dawn, their bodies curled together like vines; he missed work, the cases, the adrenaline rush of tailing criminals and pursuing serial killers. He missed Sherlock.
The detective put on a pair of black boxing inner gloves and fitted the bandages around his wrists, then took a double back gun holsters from his backpack, buckled it to his chest, and loaded two automatic weapons onto it. He started up the motorcycle, twisted the throttle accelerating to the maximum, and headed for the dune. The motorbike climbed up effortlessly and flew out the sand. Sherlock jumped up, fell on the sand, and slide down the dune at full speed, his eyes fixed on the motorbike. Once he reached the rocky ground, he ran to the cabin.
He smirked. Perhaps most ironically of all, Eurus's breakthrough into their lives finally led them to confess their feelings for each other.
"You caressed Papa?" the girl was amazed, knowing how reluctant her father was to make physical contact.
But somehow, being with Holmes rekindled his feelings for Strange. Holmes' and Strange's voices were so similar that he felt like he was listening to Stephen if he closed his eyes. So he shut his eyes when Holmes said he loved him madly, or when assured they would always be together, that nothing and nobody could separate them.
Moran smiled coldly. Sherlock was scared. Though he tried to hide it, his eyes were desperately scanning the place, looking for a way out, and he was testing the ropes that restrained his arms to the back of the chair. The more he looked around him, the more terrified he got. Because Sebastian worked hard in reproduce even the last tiny detail of the basement where they raped him. The colours, the lights, the armchair, the table… the only difference, the chairs, but it would quickly change. Sebastian knew very well of the devastating power of memories, which could break a prey quicker than any threat.
“I lost Rosie. I left her with a stranger. I was wrong about him,” he repeated, hitting his temples with his fists. “How could I have been so stupid? Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
Anderson glued his body to hers and grabbed Sally's hips. He started rocking his hips, so the sergeant had to do same, and they both fucked Sherlock, the sergeant and the detective moaning louder and louder as Donovan threw her head back, the detective's body arched up from the table, his cock twitching as he came again, spurting only some drops of cum, as his face contorted in a mix of pleasure and pain, sobbing and moaning, cursing and sobbing
Sherlock started with slower, longer strokes, closing his fingers together as he reached the heads, then loosening them as his hand traveled back down towards the base. John threw back his head and closed his eyes, lost in the softness and warmth of Sherlock's hand, in the firmness with which he held both cocks, mesmerized by the rhythmic rise and fall of the detective's fist, as they both moaned.
"You will need time, physiotherapy, and rehabilitation," he said, helping John to wear a sling after examining his shoulder, dressing his wounds, and applying ointment to bruises. John could not hide a grimace of annoyance. He hated the sling, the idea of going through months of rehabilitation again, like when he was shot. Only been able to use one arm, depending on others for many tasks...
"Ahhhhhhhhhh" moaned Sherlock, finally able to do it freely "Jooohn, yesss, please, I need…. Ngggggg oh my God, touch me," the detective bubbled incongruently, straining the ropes, trying desperately to free his hands, trashing his head from side to side.
"The fridge! I forgot it!" he stuck his head in so deep that John was afraid it would stick to the bottom. "A jar full of eyeballs! Disgusting! It's great!"
The man watched at her, bewildered. He gazed at Anderson, who made an incomprehensible but blatantly obscene gesture towards Donovan. Dimmock rolled his eyes. Anderson was so stupid that he didn't bother to hide that if he continued in his position, it was only because he slept with the DI.
John dragged his palms down his face, in the process wiping away the light sheen of sweat glistening on his forehead. He was still tired, but the temperature in the room was intolerably high, which, he knew, would preclude any possibility of falling asleep, and so he thought it best to just laze about for a bit. Repressing another yawn, he lay motionless for a moment with his hands crossed on his stomach, but soon exhaled a silent sigh of resignation and struggled up on his forearms to dodge the assault of the burning sunlight.
Exhaling a trembling breath, Sherlock released his iron grip on his hair and wiped his sweaty palms on his pyjama bottoms. His heart was slamming against his chest, his pulse a frenetic throb at the base of his throat.
Light-headed, he struggled up into a sitting position, his bare feet hitting the rug, and with a jolt of surprise, he noted that the wool was cold under his soles, the warmth in which he had been swathed earlier a distant memory.
Squinting his eyes, he continued to scan the room for any sign of movement, any indication of the presence of someone else. Sherlock was certain that he had heard something. He had heard someone calling John’s name, but he didn’t recognise the voice. It was unmistakably male, but it sounded oddly weak, cracking.
Mycroft had, unsurprisingly, already managed to get an appointment for Sherlock at a private hospital, the name of which John hadn't bothered to memorise. Despite the rivalry between the brothers, John knew that Mycroft cared immensely about his younger brother. The man had helped Sherlock so many times and in so many ways, once or twice even saving him from dying of an overdose, that John felt like he was forever in his debt; if it wasn't for Mycroft, the love of his life would already be dead.
“I’m just here to check his vital signs.” The nurse stood still, looking at John, as if waiting for permission. John managed another nod and a brief smile. He knew that Sherlock’s vital signs were normal—he had checked the monitors every five minutes for the last half hour—but he wanted to hear the words out loud, as if hearing them would make it more real.
“Mycroft,” John stopped him. He felt like he had to say something, anything. Mycroft turned around and cocked a questioning brow at him. John hesitated, afraid that his voice would break. He had never thought it possible to feel so many emotions at once. Guilt, fear, sorrow, regret—all flooding through his body, making him feel sick. John cleared his throat and took a deep breath. “Thank you.” His voice sounded hoarse to his own ears, but he felt relieved that he had managed to get the words out.
The probability that he would never again attain that level of self-reliance stirred a sort of mixed anger and sadness in him and gave form to the fear that he might one day have to accept external help or, even worse, leave Baker Street behind and move to a place that was customised for his disability. All circumstances considered, however, he believed that he had gotten through the first week after his diagnosis quite honourably. He had memorised the distance between each room and each furniture, counted how many steps it took to get from John’s armchair to his, from the bathtub to the towel rack, from the fridge to the kitchen sink. He had learned to estimate how much tea a mug contained by the weight of the mug and what time it was by the temperature in the room. He was becoming excellent at Braille and exceptional at recognising smells and textures. All in all, he was dealing with his changed circumstances remarkably well.
“Hey. Shh, it’s all right.” Sherlock felt John kiss his eyelids, his eyebrow, and the tip of his nose. His hand wiped away the tear and brushed a curl off his forehead, coming to rest on Sherlock’s cheek, caressing it tenderly. “I’m glad you’re awake.”
He felt John’s hands on his face, as he carefully removed the mask. Sherlock leaned into his touch, letting his eyelids flutter closed. There was only darkness, a suffocating blackness, and he couldn’t escape it. It was everywhere. He swallowed hard against the lump in his throat, and bit the inside of his cheek in order not to cry, but he couldn’t stop the single tear from escaping the corner of his eye.
John pulled himself closer to Sherlock until their faces were a mere inch apart. “Hey,” John murmured and brushed the corner of Sherlock’s mouth with his lips, with just the slightest pressure, eliciting a soft gasp from him. “It’s all right.”
“We don’t know yet, I’m afraid,” the doctor said apologetically. “We’ll have to do more tests, and Mr Holmes needs to stay here overnight so we can keep an eye on him.”
There were four faltering footsteps on the wooden floorboards, three shuffles on the rug, and then they halted. John was closer now, standing a couple of feet away from him. He was breathing heavily, slightly breathless from the climb upstairs. If he took one step closer, Sherlock would be able to feel the warmth emanating from his body, the tickling puffs of his breathing.
First of all, thank you so much to everyone who reads, comments, leaves kudos, and bookmarks! It means the world to me :)
“Well, yes. False brain tumour. Cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causes a rise in intracranial pressure, and the patient experiences symptoms that mimic a brain tumour,” John recited, as if from a medical book. “Never seen it in my career, though.” His throat felt dry, his voice hoarse.
He wedged his hands under opposite armpits and sighed: caring was exhausting. Mycroft had, of course, been right when he had warned him that getting involved in romantic attachments would seriously impair his ability to make rational and calculated decisions. That insufferable, pretentious bastard; he was always right, always the smart one. A muscle twitching in his cheek, Sherlock jerked his knees closer to his chest with a movement which would have made his older brother roll his eyes in exasperation, and nestled deeper into the chair, a sullen frown etched on his forehead.
Before John had time to finish his sentence, however, Sherlock seemed to read his mind. “I’ll wait here.”
Hello! Thank you so much for all the lovely comments you left on the last chapter, I was so happy to see that so many of you are still here :) Here's a new chapter, from Sherlock's POV this time. It's probably the longest chapter so far haha. I really hope you enjoy it! Hugs, elle_m
Sherlock had requested that John stayed in the waiting room, and he had agreed without hesitation. John had left the most important person in his life alone with strangers. Sherlock was sick, possibly dying, and he couldn't handle being in the same room while the doctors were examining him. Now Sherlock was alone somewhere, being poked and prodded, with electrodes stuck into his bare skin, not being able to see what was happening.
It should have been an ordinary Sunday morning: soft, slow kisses leading to Sherlock pleading his name, begging him to continue, to take him into oblivion. John would have felt Sherlock's body trembling beneath him, John's every thrust consuming him, soft cries and harsh breaths. Sherlock's lips everywhere, sending hot shivers down his spine, taking him over the edge.
Suddenly, Sherlock was pulled from the precipice of a panic attack as he heard the distinct bang of the front door being pulled shut, followed instantly by the click of the brass knocker as it swung against its plate from the impact. His hands dropped to his sides. He vaguely noted that his heart was beating a funny rhythm in his chest and his fingers were slick with perspiration—textbook signs of a fight-or-flight response.
It's finally time for my summer holiday! I'M FREE!! Now I'll finally have more time to write, too :)
John knew that he should have said something. He should have said that he wasn't going anywhere, that he was going to keep annoying him with his thoughts whether Sherlock wanted it or not, but the words got stuck in his throat, burning him from the inside.
As his mind was struggling to put the pieces together, Sherlock pushed the sheet away and slowly slid off the hospital bed, letting his feet touch the floor. The linoleum felt cold against his bare soles, the cool air tickling his exposed skin. Sherlock shivered, tempted to curl up under the comforting cocoon of the cotton sheet again, the thin hospital gown not offering much warmth. Instead, he rose to his feet, resisting the temptation, and took an experimental step forward, trying to coordinate his tired limbs.
“Thank you.” His voice sounded weak, tired, and he thought that he saw a look of pity on her face as she nodded and walked away, leaving him alone with Sherlock in the dimly lit recovery room.
“Oh,” he uttered dumbly. His first impulse was to deny it, but just as he was about to open his mouth, a shudder rippled its way through his body, and he thought it best to remain silent.
And he felt like he was suffocating, as if all the air had been sucked out of his lungs and replaced with lead, weighing him down.
Sherlock was hovering on the edge of consciousness, the tenacious fingers of sleep tugging at him, trying to pull him back under. As every fibre in his body implored him for another moment of rest, he was tempted to yield to their demand and let them lull him back into merciful unconsciousness, that irresistible state of beatific ignorance. In his dreams, he could still see, images of his past life flowing one by one through his mind: he saw himself racing along the sodden bank of Thames, the rubber soles of his shoes squishing with every step as mud oozed around them, biting wind numbing the tips of his ears, the squelch of reassuring footsteps just a pace behind; he saw himself dashing along Bouverie Street, his breath coming in harsh, staccato bursts, every heartbeat thumping in his ears, the towering buildings of London punctuating the rosy skyline before him; and sometimes all he saw were flashes that flitted through his mind: tender fingers entwining with his, strong wrists, toes curling against snow-white linen, hungry lips, groping hands, golden hair ablaze in the sun.
But his anger wasn’t directed at Sherlock. He couldn’t blame Sherlock after what had happened to him. No, not in a million years.
Sherlock scoffed. “Please, do be sensible, John. You haven't even taken your mobile phone out of your pocket, how would you know?” His voice was still slurry from the medication, but his annoyance was apparent.
“He’s blind!” John exclaimed, his voice coming out louder than he had intended. He opened his eyes to see the shocked expression on the doctor’s face, and it took him less than a second to realise that there was no way Sherlock hadn’t heard him.
He fought the heaviness in his eyelids, but the tiredness he was experiencing threatened to overtake him, pulling him back into unconsciousness. His thoughts incomplete and unformed, Sherlock gave up the fight and surrendered to his exhaustion.
John felt Sherlock shift under his arm, as if his wish had been heard. He watched Sherlock’s eyebrows furrow and his chin crease, as his mouth stretched into a big, gaping yawn, and John couldn’t help but adore him and all his tiny chins. “Good morning, love” he breathed out, peering down into Sherlock’s face. “How are you feeling?”
John felt his stomach sink, the collar of his jumper suddenly feeling tight. He had never before seen Mycroft show weakness, never seen him show any sign of emotion other than annoyance, yet here he stood, helplessly, worry written all over his face. It was almost too much to bear, seeing him, the most powerful man in London, so helpless, knowing that this time he didn't know what to do, couldn't help his little brother. As John saw Mycroft's eyes pleading with him to understand, he felt like he couldn't breathe, the guilt weighing him down.
life is going to die. We don’t know.” He hated those words. Every time he heard them, something painful tugged at his chest, making him want to shout in frustration. He wanted to let down his guard and release the anger that boiled inside him, he wanted to hit something, rip something—anything—apart. He wanted to cry at the unfairness of it all, but he knew it was futile, so he maintained his composure like a proper soldier, harbouring the sense of frustration inside, letting it grow like a snowball rolling downhill, gaining momentum every second.
In an attempt to keep his swollen eyes and sleep-deprived mind off the empty chair, John studied the ceramic coffee cup, its handle that took the form of a swan’s neck, the faded light blue and yellow pattern of flowers on the outside of the upper rim. Inhaling the bitter steam rising from the dark liquid, he focused on the cup, as if he were practicing some sort of meditation, burning incense and a cross-legged position the only things missing.
John got up from the chair he had dragged over to Sherlock’s hospital bed and went into the bathroom to fill a plastic cup with water. He considered turning on the light in the room but decided against it. His eyes already adjusting to the darkness, he walked back and sat on the edge of the bed. John could see the outline of Sherlock’s upper body in the dark, his bare chest rising and falling evenly to the rhythm of his breathing. More than anything, John wanted to be closer to him, wrap his arms around Sherlock’s slim form and feel his breathing, his chest rising below him, but there was only one bed and it was rather small, and John didn’t want his tossing and turning to keep Sherlock awake. He knew that it would have taken only one call to Mycroft to have him arrange another bed, but there were more important things to worry about than getting a good night’s sleep.
He dragged his palms down his face, an undertow of hopelessness tugging at his thoughts. As tired as he was of tiptoeing around Sherlock, he also couldn’t bring himself to communicate his distress to his partner, not when the man had every reason to act like he did. If absorbing himself in experiments and disappearing into his Mind Palace was how Sherlock handled grief, then so be it. After all, it was Sherlock who had just experienced a life-shattering loss, not him. The man had lost his means of navigating life, his extraordinary ability to observe which he had honed through years of diligent practice and assiduous repetition, his talent of taking everything in at a glance. Besides, it would have been ridiculously hypocritical of him to criticise how the man dealt with pain after he himself once had resorted to something as detrimental and unhealthy as heavy drinking to drown his own.
Sherlock straightened his back, feeling his senses heightened by the sudden surge of adrenaline that swept through him, and took a cautious step toward the open door. The beeping grew louder and louder, more frequent, as he took another step.
“No need to apologise, sir. I know this is hard for you, I really do. But you must understand we’re doing everything we can,” the doctor said, his gentle tone making John feel guilty for his outburst.
Feeling disoriented, Sherlock turned his head in what he thought was the general direction of the door, trying to locate John’s voice, but his spatial perception was momentarily impaired by decreased neuronal activity, the last vestiges of sleep still clinging to him. He felt as if he were floating in darkness, with no sense of left or right, up or down, his body like a weightless object drifting in space. The agony in his head was the only thing that grounded him, the only thing that reminded him that he wasn’t a bodiless entity immune to the pull of gravity.
John would become bitter and irritable, his patience wearing thinner and thinner until it was as frail as gossamer. It would start with innocuous resentment: mutterings under breath, covert eyerolls, terse grunts instead of endearments, stiff pats on the knee instead of tender, affectionate touches. Then would come the snapping and barking and arguing which would eventually lead to nasty fights filled with swearing and venomous words, vehement insults, accusations, and tears; John blaming him for making his life miserable, him shouting at John that he would be better off alone. And sooner or later, when there were no more words left to express his loathing for Sherlock, the verbal abuse would turn physical.
John’s lips were ghosting over his, his breath warm against his skin, tickling the corner of his mouth. Sherlock could still taste him on his lips, taste the bitter morning breath with a lingering hint of mint from toothpaste mixed with the unique taste of John, warm and welcoming, like home. Sherlock was fully aware how painfully unoriginal his description was, but he couldn’t care less, all the stupid, sickeningly sweet clichés about John being true. Even with morning breath, he tasted divine. John always tasted divine, and he desperately wanted to close the distance between them, and taste him again. Again and again.
It should have been a lovely morning. But it wasn't. It was one of those mornings that seemed so peaceful in the rising sun, yet turned out to be a nightmare.
“I’m starving. We haven’t eaten anything since we left home God knows how many hours ago,” John groaned, “And Sherlock, you—“
There was no way he could stop loving the person who had had such a profound impact on his life. Sherlock had made him feel so alive, made him realise that life was worth living, saved him from his paralysing depression. Hell, Sherlock had saved his life. Before he had met Sherlock, there had been far too many nights when he had held his gun in his hands, feeling a great temptation to pull the trigger.
“I can’t do this, Sherlock. I can’t do this right now.” John got up from his chair and walked past Sherlock without giving him a glance. “I’m going out.”
He was dangerous, but not in the usual meaning of the word. Sherlock wasn't a criminal, nor was he a cold-blooded murderer. Sherlock could be rude and inconsiderate, that's for sure, but he certainly wasn't evil. John had had the chance to see what lurked beneath his seemingly controlled exterior, and it had been shocking to find out how vulnerable and insecure Sherlock was behind his logical and unemotional demeanour. Whenever Sherlock did something that was possibly risky, he would look at John like a guilty puppy, his eyes glistening, pale cheeks flushed, worrying that he had upset John. He needed reassurance, and he craved John's admiration. And John was more than happy to give him what he wanted. John felt privileged to be the one to see his softer, more human side, and he was unwilling to share him, feeling almost possessive of him.
When the doctor had told him that Sherlock’s vital signs were normal and his condition stable, John had felt immensely relieved and grateful, as if a weight he didn’t know he was carrying had been lifted from his shoulders. But seeing Sherlock lying there motionless, in a hospital bed, still under anaesthesia with his dark unruly curls damp with sweat, plastered to his forehead, electrodes taped to his bare chest, brought a sharp twisting ache to his chest and made any real happiness evaporate into thin air. He looked so vulnerable lying against the white sheets with all those machines connected to his body and tubes running out of him. He looked so helpless, so fragile, as though he would break under the slightest pressure and shatter into a million pieces like a fine porcelain vase if John were to drape his arms around his narrow waist, pulling his still body into a tight embrace.
He had begun to wonder, and he hated himself for even thinking something so absurd and so deeply and disgustingly wrong, whether Sherlock had fallen out of love with him, whether it had been a solely physical attraction on his part. The repulsive thought that losing his eyesight had made Sherlock realise that it had been John’s physical appearance all along that had appealed to him, not his dull, ordinary personality simultaneously made him want to kick himself in the shin and double over and vomit.
Although he knew Sherlock couldn’t see it, John smiled at him, satisfied; he considered it a victory whenever he succeeded in making Sherlock Holmes eat. “Just that I’d prefer my boyfriend alive.”
In other circumstances, John would have been annoyed, even angry, because he hated being told what to do, especially by Mycroft, but for now, the only thing he cared about was Sherlock. He had to find him, and save him, just like Sherlock had saved him.
John watched the nurse, not letting go of Sherlock’s hand, as she proceeded to check the monitors, writing down the results on a chart in her hand.
“You need some time to adjust, this is a huge…” John began, trying to ignore the venom in Sherlock’s voice.
He had lifted the trousers up from the floor, handed them to Sherlock, and without saying a word, John had brushed his hand over Sherlock's cheek. Sherlock's body had tensed in response to the unexpected stimulus, making his jaw clench, his body getting ready to flee from danger.
The doctor stopped in mid-sentence, raising an eyebrow in query. “What’s so funny, sir?” he asked, his forehead wrinkled in honest puzzlement, earning another chuckle from John.
John’s thumb hovered against his bottom lip, making it hard to concentrate, and Sherlock’s heart stuttered in his chest. For half a second—his thought process slower than usual—he considered whether he should ask him to repeat what he just said, but decided against it; he hated repeating himself and he knew he shouldn’t expect anyone else to want to do it either. Holding his eyes closed, seeing no point in opening them, Sherlock nodded once, hoping John hadn’t noticed that he had no idea what he was agreeing to.
John slid his hand under Sherlock’s hospital gown, his fingertips tracing the ridge of Sherlock’s collar bone, and the line of his ribs, in an attempt to soothe him. “You don’t need to try to be strong for me, Sherlock. You know that, right?” John said carefully, lightly resting his forehead against Sherlock’s.
Sherlock felt disoriented; it was like someone had penetrated the depths of his mind and reconstructed his mind palace, making it resemble the mind of a drug abuser.
John snapped his mouth shut, and clenching his jaw, he willed himself to take deep, slow breaths. He knew it wasn’t the doctor’s fault that he was touchy on the subject. John knew about Sherlock’s past drug use, and although he would never admit it out loud, he was afraid that Sherlock might relapse. The fear remained at the edge of his mind, threatening to resurface every time someone mentioned Sherlock and drugs in the same sentence. John stole a sideways glance at Sherlock. He was seemingly unaffected, but John knew he had noticed that his grip had tightened around his knee.
His heart squeezing in his chest, John let his eyes linger on the narrow oblong area of disfigured flesh that ran along the inner border of the man’s right shoulder blade, the recollection of how the marred skin felt under his fingertips vivid in his mind. He had memorised every single one of the scars decorating the man’s skin while exploring his body with his fingers, lips, and the tip of his tongue, and he desperately wanted to know the history behind each and every one of them. He wanted to know him thoroughly, to be able to recognise him by touch, by the sharp edges of his hip bones and the notch of his sternum, by the curves of his palms and the slender planes of his wrists.
John stared incredulously at the screen. He had no idea how Sherlock had managed to type out a text message without any grammatical or spelling errors. He knew he should be used to it by now, but Sherlock, somehow, never failed to surprise him.
Their first kiss had been natural, as if they had both known all along that they were heading toward that moment. It had started out tentative and soft and lovely, but had grown quickly more demanding, as if they were trying to make up for all the lost years. John had never felt so happy, so perfectly right. Despite feeling like he had waited forever to be kissed like that, John's life didn't culminate in that moment; rather, it began a new chapter in an old story, their story.
Or perhaps it wasn’t that he didn’t know. Perhaps he knew, but it just wasn’t enough. Sherlock couldn’t rid himself of the unsettling thought that John would realise that he wasn’t all that fascinating or brilliant, after all, when he was reduced to ordinariness, when he couldn’t dazzle him with his exceptional intelligence and extraordinary ability to glean information from any crime scene at a glance. It had been his uncanny talent for deducing John’s military career and his psychosomatic limp from just one look at the man that had lured him in, and there was no evidence to indicate that John would want to stay by his side now that he could no longer hide behind the veil of his genius, and his obnoxious, insolent, and disagreeable self was exposed. It was inconceivable to him why someone so brave, so kind, so good, and so loving as John would choose to spend the rest of his life with an arsehole like him.
Love had made them inseparable, they were one in every sense of the word—if Sherlock died, John would die, too. He had always known that one day it would come to this. He would get his heart broken, one way or another. And Sherlock would be the one to break it.
Holmes, John thought, was going to give him relationship advice. The thought made him cringe internally. He wouldn't want to hear it if his life depended on it. John shifted his weight from one foot to the other and cleared his throat, not knowing what to say.
As John tucked his mobile phone back into his pocket, he tried not to think about all the possible causes of sudden vision loss, but the strong odour of antiseptic and latex, reminding him of his medical degree, made it difficult. In his career, he had seen a few patients with acute-onset total blindness, but in almost all cases their vision loss had been caused by trauma, and John was fairly certain that Sherlock hadn't suffered any physical injuries recently. But then again, he could never be sure. Sherlock was always putting himself in dangerous situations in order to escape, as he would say, the dullness of
Sherlock felt him pull away, leaving him feeling slightly off-balance. He could feel the mattress shift under him as John slid off the bed. Sherlock felt exposed in the absence of his touch. He didn’t feel safe, not when he couldn’t touch, let alone see John.
Slowly, he was regaining control of his body, his head starting to clear, his vision coming into focus. It was dark, but he could see that he was in a typical hospital room. As he registered his surroundings, a thought broke through the remaining fog of his mind, fighting its way into his consciousness. Sherlock blinked, his mouth opening in surprise. He could see. The operation had restored his vision. He wasn’t blind. He could
John hadn't hesitated for a second to call him, and he hadn't been the slightest bit surprised when the black car had appeared outside 221B Baker Street before their phone call had even ended.
John was always showing him how much he cared, in both words and actions, and he had started to believe that John really loved him. It hadn't been easy. Sherlock had had a hard time understanding why someone so perfect would love someone like him, him who was so arrogant, inconsiderate, obnoxious, rude—some people had even called him heartless.
He wouldn't be able to live, to function, without John. He couldn't bear even thinking about it. He had opened his soul, let down his guard, poured his heart out to John, and now he was being punished for it.
Before he even knew what he was going to do, he struggled up into a standing position, his right leg twinging in protest—his limp was acting up again—and dusted the back of his jeans. He turned around to face the stairs, but hesitated. The sensible thing to do was to talk things through with Sherlock before he dashed out of the house like a rebelling teenager, but he couldn’t bear the thought of breaking down into a sobbing wreck in front of him or saying something impetuous in a moment of indignation.
John swallowed against the thick lump in his throat. Mycroft looked like he wanted to say more but couldn't bring himself to find the words. The air was thick with emotion that neither of them dared express. They stayed silent for a long time until Mycroft nodded and turned to walk away, leaving John standing alone in the middle of the waiting room.
Closing his eyes, John stayed still, breathing in the scent of Sherlock’s hair. He could smell a hint of disinfectant and latex, but the familiar musky scent of pine trees and lavender was still detectable. Breathing through his nostrils, John let the scent calm him, to remind him of home. He wanted to linger in the warmth that radiated from Sherlock’s body, curl up next to his sleeping form, and forget everything else for a while.
Reluctantly, John withdrew his eyes from the staircase and turned around, his fingers curling up into fists at his side as he began striding toward the door. He might have stayed in a less fragile mood, he tried to convince himself, but he was on the verge of bursting into tears, and he loathed the idea of Sherlock’s having to comfort him, when he was the one who should be there for the man, being a shoulder to cry on, caressing the silky mop of curls on top of his head until his sobs abated and his whimpers turned into sleep-filled breaths.
Sherlock huffed out an annoyed breath. “It isn’t as if I could just get up and find my way out of this hospital alone.”
“Very well, Mr Holmes. Now, the nurse will take you for the CT scan. You can relax, we'll help you move onto the stretcher.”
His hair caught the sunlight, making it glisten like gold as it swayed in the gentle breeze. He smiled that smile that reached his eyes and crinkled them at the corners, his teeth flashing in a grin, a vein popping out on his forehead as he laughed, a low chuckle rumbling from deep in his chest. His blue irises, encircled by narrow rings of charcoal, stood in contrast to his tanned skin, the look in them deep and piercing, locked on his. Sherlock had always admired how John could look so tender, so loving and genuinely gentle, but at the same time so intense that he looked as if he wanted to bend Sherlock over the closest surface right then and there.
His chest felt tight. Unbearably tight. It felt as if it had been squeezed into a tight corset, forcing him to draw shallow breaths through his cracked lips.
John was shifting nervously, he was panicking. Sherlock knew that he had to stay calm, ignore the panic raging inside of him. He had to stay calm for John. All he could see was darkness, trying to pull him down into oblivion, but he couldn't allow himself to lose it now, not in front of John.
The heart monitor was beeping steadily, filling the otherwise silent room with the rhythm of Sherlock’s beating heart. John let the sound comfort him, lull him into a state of ease, as he caressed Sherlock’s limp fingers, feeling every joint, every line of his slender digits. His hand was pale and cool to the touch, but he was alive. He was breathing, his rib cage expanding as he calmly drew air into his lungs through an oxygen tube that ran into his nostrils under a transparent plastic mask that covered his nose and mouth.
They were standing in the hallway outside Sherlock’s hospital room, keeping their voices low, so as not to disturb Sherlock, who was still groggy from the anaesthetic. John didn’t want to leave his side, not now, not while he was so vulnerable, but John had agreed to talk to the doctor outside the room where he could still see Sherlock lying on the bed through the slightly ajar door. He wanted to stay near Sherlock in case he needed anything, in case anything happened to him. John didn’t want to miss a drop in Sherlock’s blood pressure or a change in his electrocardiogram—he wouldn’t allow anything to go unnoticed, not when Sherlock’s life was on the line.
He was lying in the cold examination room, waiting for the world, his world, to end. He had lost his sight and he was going to lose the love of his life, the love of John, too. He was exhausted.
At least something hadn’t changed, John thought, and his eyes grew damp. Blinking quickly, he tried to force back the tears. He just wanted things to go back to normal, back to insults and eye rolls, back to Sherlock being a rude, annoying git.
No, he wasn’t afraid for his own sake. Whatever was going to happen, John knew for damn sure that his feelings wouldn’t change. It was Sherlock he was worried about. He was worried that Sherlock wouldn’t be able to accept his blindness. There was a strong link between his eyesight and his deductions; his eyes never stopped working. They were always scanning the surroundings,
At that moment, John hated the hospital. He hated everything about it; the sounds, the smells; he hated all the people inside it. He hated that day, that particular Sunday. And above all, he hated himself.
Taking in a shaky breath, I gulped as I wiped my eyes clean from tears. My sweat trickled down my back, cold and uncomfortably.
“Sentiment is a chemical defect found on the losing side, Sherlock.” I recalled Mycroft hissing in my ear, as 6-year-old me was sprawled on the ground, my knees grazed with blood, trying not to cry, in the courtyard of my childhood home.
Overwhelmed by the sudden flow of food, I gagged as the peas ran down my parched throat, lodging themselves, as I stumbled to the sink, placing my head under the tap, gulping down the cold water that was now flushing away the peas. I felt dizzy, as I gripped the sides of the sink, clasping my eyes shut, the fury, sorrow, and rage swirling in my brain, rampaging and storming.
For you, John. Just this once, I thought as I emptied the bland tasting peas into my mouth, barely chewing them as I gulped them down as fast as I could.
Sitting down on John’s bed, he slowly laid down on it, planting his face into the soft duvet. The scent of John’s shampoo still lingered in the layers of the duvet. It calmed him.
With one hand, I violently rubbed my face, getting rid of the tear stain, but what I really wanted to rub away was my sentiment.
Wearing his overcoat on top of his t-shirt and dressing gown, set off, careful not to wake Mrs Hudson.
“Sherlock… it’s fine. But next time, please wear more clothes to not repeat what just happened! And how on earth did you find the keys to my door?” John said exasperatedly.
"it MUST'VE been that, Sherlock, no matter how smart you are, you will not know better than me in anything medical!" John demanded.
The feeling of something grasping his throat hard, impossible to breathe, the hospital lights blazing above his vision that was spotting with black patches, the nurse by his side, calling out to him, mycroft calling out to him.
No. I would just show sentimentality, which was the last thing I wanted to show in public. In front of John’s family. In front of John.
Two hours. Christ. How was he going to survive that? The walls felt like they were towering and closing over him second by second, the light was way too bright, blinding him, the blood rushing in his head, he could hear it. He could feel his heart pounding against his ribcage, thumping harder and harder. His throat felt like it was gripped. Tightly.
Searching his room, the kitchen and his room, he finally turned to the bathroom. Barging in, he saw the vomit in the unflushed toilet, dripping down the edge.
This is the end of the story, I hope you liked it! Check out more of my works if you have time!! Thank you for taking your time reading this, I really appreciate it!
“Sherlock, don’t fall asleep, it’ll only make it worse,” John said crisply, taking off his overcoat, which was drenched with the damp rain and snow, and wrapping his dressing gown over him, and turning up the heater.
Ignoring Mrs Hudson, I panicked as the blood from the fresh cuts started to seep out of the fabric, their crimson shade contrasting with the crisp white shade of my shirt.
I flicked the army knife open, and ripped my shirt’s cuff open with my other hand, to reveal those deep red scars that impinged my skin in stripes. With precision, I sunk the knife into the outer layer of my skin. I felt the blinding pain of the knife entering my skin, and the numbness and emptiness I felt was replaced by strong feelings that made my head burst. I heard the voices in my head abuse me.
“Hypothermia,” Mary mumbled. “I think it’s hypothermia, cold, shivering, breathing rapidly and slurred speech! He’s just wearing his overcoat and a t-shirt, of course he got hypothermia! It’s minus one degrees outside!”
“I know.. John’s.. passed away.. but you still have to eat and drink,” Mrs Hudson said, trying to comfort Sherlock, who was breathing shakily.
“You behave, and sit down, before I call your brother here,” Mrs Hudson demanded as she took her phone out. “No…” Sherlock mumbled as he continued stumbling towards his room. Suddenly, his knees buckled, as he took a lunge for the wall, blinking hard to get rid of the black dots that riddled his eyesight. He leaned on the wall as he slowly slid down, losing consciousness.
“…yeah, we’re in Notting Hill, Oxford Gardens….” John’s voice trailed away as Sherlock felt lightheaded. He never liked small spaces, and the fact that they were going to be stuck here for a while made him panicky, as he gripped the rails of the elevator with his sweaty palms tightly, trying to keep breathing normally.
“Please don’t, I NEED YOU,” Sherlock cried, wrapping himself closer to John who was getting colder and colder.
Letting go of the grip he had on John’s hand, he hastily rubbed away the tears that clung onto his eyelashes.
He opened the door slowly, weighing his whole body on the knob. The sweat on his back trickled down. Seconds were passing with a sluggish pace.
Running as quick as he could, he tried to reach Moriarty. But the faster he went, the faster Moriarty disappeared farther and farther away.
"I've been meaning to say that too- and I'll say them now," Sherlock declared, as he laid his head on John's shoulder, and whispered in his ear,
“Hello, my friend drowned and he’s not showing any sign of life, I’m doing- CPR on him,” John said as beads of sweat rolled down from his hair.
"No..." Mrs Hudson stuttered, realising that what Mycroft said is true. "Oh god, what will Sherlock say? Does he know?" She continued, her voice down to a whisper.
“Christ, Mary’s in this house, not now!” John said, pushing him back but he couldn’t resist, leaning in himself to kiss him. Pulling back, he looked at Sherlock’s handsomely chiselled face, the features softening, those eyes, as sharp as an eagles, looked vulnerable and relaxed for the first time.
The white lights of the hospital blinded him. Nurses and doctors bustled around in front of him, as he nervously rapped his fingers on his lap. He hated it here.
“I’ll leave you guys alone for now, either of you just call me if you need anything,” Mary said as she slipped out of the room quietly.
"I'll check on him now. Thank you- Mycroft," Mrs Hudson uttered, as she put down the phone and dashed up to Sherlock's flat. The door squeaked, as Mrs Hudson peeked into the room, to see Sherlock staring into the distance, his eyes reduced to slits.
“Al-alright,” John said, quickly retreating his extended arm. Sherlock bowed his head as he shakily took deep breaths, his palms so slippery they kept sliding off the rail despite his tight grip on them.
My hands trembled, my knees knocking against each other, as I unraveled the rope. I was terrified. Yet I needed to do this.
Flashes of light, blinding me. The ringing in my ears so deafening I can't hear anything else. I can't move, as my arms struggled against something restricting me. I can't breathe.
Wait, I thought, as I got down and scribbled on a piece of paper. I clutched it in my hand firmly, the edges digging into my skin.
“SHERLOCK? SHERLOCK, WHERE ARE YOU?” John screamed, the deadly silence in the flat making him fear the worst.
“Gasp!” Sherlock woke up, beads of sweat dripping down his temples, feeling the dampness of his pillow. His curly hair stuck to his skin, greasy and wet.
“He’s mine,” Moriarty repeated, holding up a dagger that appeared in thin air. Retracting his arm, he glared at Sherlock, the most triumphant smile on his face.
“What is it?” Mycroft said as he warily stepped into the investigation room, the bags under his eyes dark, the creases on his forehead increased. Lestrade’s staff around multiple tables, investigating, searching for evidence.
“There are people who love you, Sherlock. Don’t do that again, for you drive a steak in their hearts. We will be the ones who mourns you, not yourself,” John said, his kindred eyes melting away the coldness of Sherlock’s sharp, intense pupils.
John smiled at him, despite the pain he was in. Taking in rattling breaths, his body started to relax as the rise and fall of his chest stopped, his hand retracted from Sherlock’s as he slumped into Sherlock’s lap, unmoving.
“It’s not your fault. I’m an idiot, I- let you down. I can’t let you blame yourself, John…” Sherlock said in a rasping tone, his vocals still strained from the drowning. Slowly, Sherlock reached up and wiped away a tear from John’s face with a delicate swipe of his swift finger, and fingered John’s damp cheeks.
It was another typical rainy day. The rain pattered down on the windows. I don’t even know what day it is. What time it is. Mrs Hudson lays down my lunch beside me.
“I heard a thump, oh god,” Mary said as she dashed back to the living room, to see Sherlock slumped on the armchair with no sign of movement.
When I exited my room, the flat was empty again. John’s armchair that faced mine was empty as usual. I hadn’t seen him in two months. I wish I could reverse time to the days where John lived with me. Does John even care about me now? He left you.
Taking in a deep breath, I shifted my position so that I could lay down in the tub. I looked at my surroundings one last time. To die in 221B. A perfect way to finish my story.
“No, I don’t know what- what do I do? He’s not responding to me and I- Like I-“ Sherlock stuttered, his voice breaking, his tears streaming down his face.
An hour later, a fireman wrenched the lift door open, to find two men sitting on the floor arguing about something on the phone.
Falling onto the floor, I scraped the floorboard with my fingernails, with so much effort that the floorboards let out a squeak.
“JOHN!” Sherlock screamed as he saw John stumbling and leaning on the wall, falling to the ground slowly with every laborious breath he took. He fell the the ground, cold sweat rolling down his face, clutching his abdomen, his shirt stained with deep red blood.
“This lift is out of service.” The lift blared as John and Sherlock felt a sudden thud, then no movement from the elevator.
Letting out a scream, I dug my fingernails into the scalp of my head, feeling the greasy touch of my unwashed hair slip through my fingers.
“That was the most tedious crime I’ve encountered,” John said as he walked into the elevator with Sherlock.
Letting out a gasp, it was muffled by his uneven breaths as he let down silent tears. He was alone. So alone. Did John even see that?
Overwhelmed, I fell onto the floor, my arms and legs spread out. I could only see the ceiling, caked with layers of paint, with nothing but the white surface that turned grey as it reflected the weather outside. My tears and sweat was dripping from my face, onto the carpet, turning it from light red to deep red. Staggering, I got up, my vision blurring, the silhouette of Moriarty appearing right before my eyes.
“John?” Mrs Hudson squealed in surprise by the bang of the front door, John rushing in and scaling the stairs rapidly.
Plopping onto an armchair, Sherlock felt tired, feeling his heart pound against his chest rapidly. He put his hand on his chest, his breathing turning into uneven gasps for air, as if someone was seizing his throat.
Blinking his eyes, he read the message again and again. Immediately, he dashed out of the house, hoping that this was a ruse to get his attention.
I hear the beeping noise of a machine, the rhythm irrational, exactly like my heartbeat, thumping hard.
"Better?" John whispered, his softened eyes unlocking Sherlock's cold and precise ones, those pupils that jerked at every direction to take in information, were still and focused and John's.
I got back up again, my heart thumping against my chest, biting my lips. I looked at the room for the last time, the afternoon light shining into it..
Stumbling into the bathroom, I started to fill up the bathtub with cold water. Ripping off my coat, I felt my forehead start to burn up, and the squirming feeling in my stomach arose. My ears started to develop a ringing sound that made my headache worsen. Feeling something travel up my throat, I wrenched the lid of the toilet open as I choked on my own vomit. Collapsing on the floor, I saw back spots form in the fringes of my vision.
I jammed the door shut with a chair, as I pressed my ear to the door, hearing the whirring noises of the vacuum. Perfect. Mrs Hudson wouldn't hear me.
"You almost drowned, Sherlock," John said calmly. Taking a good look at John's face now that he adjusted his eyesight, he saw John's bloodshot eyes, rimmed with dark circles. He must've not slept for some time.
I awakened, my eyesight foggy. I tried to get up, scraping the floorboards with my fingernails, groaning as a thumping pain pounded my head, my stomach twisting and turning. I don’t remember much other than the pain. Days were blurred. They only consisted of Mrs Hudson forcing me to eat on a daily basis and sleep. There was no one to guide me. I lost the incentive to my work. The light in my life. Everything I did felt like a jolt that thrust me deeper and deeper into a dark, dark hole that had no bottom, and I couldn’t crawl out of it, no matter how hard I yelled or scraped or tried to climb the slippery surfaces of nothing.
Aggressively, I shoved him, but realised that there was nothing in front of me, but instead he was behind me, chuckling.
“Yeah, he came in unexpectedly,” John said, anxious. “I don’t know what’s wrong with him, he’s shivering and wheezing and pale,”
Wiping cold sweat from his forehead with the back of his palm hastily, he grimaced as he tried to divert himself from his terrifying thoughts. What if they never got out? What if they were stuck here and the firemen couldn’t get them out? What if the lift started falling down? What if… what if…
"This is not a joke, Mrs Hudson. Don't you think it odd, for have you not seen John for three days?"
“I can manage, go away,” Sherlock said, getting up from his chair, as he stumbled, holding onto the bookshelf, breathing quickly.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, can you hear me? Please…” John said desperately, keeping his hand on his slurred pulse, as he tried to wake Sherlock to consciousness.
In a rage, he stifled his cries by burying his head in his lap, his hands tugging at his hair. The memories of being in the hospital never, ever go away.
“I found cocaine.. on that day, on the floor. And these marks, cuts.. I’m sorry you had to go through all of this.. it’s my fault. I’m supposed to be looking after you… I’m sorry,” John said, his lower lip trembling, sniffling as the tears fell from his face, dripping onto Sherlock’s face.
I picked up the syringe with shivering fingers, as I slowly positioned it on my forearm, finding a vein to inject it into. Slowly, I protruded the needle into my vein, feeling a chill run down my spine as the contents of the syringe was emptied from the barrel. Throwing the needle aside, I tilted my head upwards as the pleasant feelings kicked in, the tingle of warmth and the feeling of safety wrapped their hands around me as if embracing an old friend. I exhaled deeply; a relaxed smile creeping on my face.
Sherlock got back to 221B, the light in his eyes faded to a bleak stare, as he sat on his chair, wrapping his thick coat around him, John’s aura still clinging to it.  He stared into the distance meaninglessly, letting his vision lose its focus.
“Sherlock! Why have you left a knife on the floor- and blood on it too! Your experiments are getting way too out of hand,” Mrs Hudson muttered as she picked up the knife and threw it into the sink.
“Okay, let’s just keep calm, relax, Sherlock, look at me,” John said as he locked eyes with Sherlock.
He felt the pain that he felt in that terrifying ordeal again, his lungs burning, and breathed strenuously, clawing and gripping his chest, beads of sweat trickling down from his hair. He heard his heart monitor beep rapidly and irregularly, making him panic even more. He felt John dabbing at his sweat, slicking his sodden fringe from his forehead.
“They’ll be here soon, they’ll be.. here,” Sherlock said, reassuring John, pressing his already blood-soaked scarf into John’s wound with more pressure.
Triggered by my memories, I let out a gasp of terror, letting the bloody knife slip from my hands to the floor.
John laid there, his eyelids gently fluttering open, as Sherlock dove into him, hugging him tightly, as he felt John gently stroking his hair with his warm hand.
I used all my strength to gently crease my lips upward, forming a smile, as my eyelids felt like lead, fluttering shut for the last time as death swept me away from the world.
I violently tried to grip his neck, but he disappeared into thin air again. Frustrated, I scratched my arm that was ridden with cuts and fading specks of former injection sites, rimmed with dark blue veins.
But all I felt was a single tear roll down my paper-dry skin, as it tumbled into my mouth, tasting like saltwater.
“Take.. care of you-yourself,” John said, looking at Sherlock with his already foggy eyesight, using all his strength to put his weak hand on Sherlock’s cheek.
“I- fine,” Sherlock croaked, wheezing, his hands bunched into fists as they grasped the leather cover of the armchair.
John woke up from dozing off on the couch with a start, hearing the buzz of his phone from the coffee table.
The door was thrusted open from the inside, Sherlock almost stumbling to the ground by the sudden motion.
within 5 minutes, he found his spare keys in the garden, under a garden gnome. Smirking, he tried to use the keys on his front door, his hands starting to feel numb as he shakily inserted the key into the door.
“That’s it, look at me,” John said, gently luring Sherlock, his arm slowly extending to touch Sherlock’s shoulder. This time, Sherlock didn’t reject his touch, instead seeming to become more calm after John’s affirming hold.
Mycroft’s hands trembled as he crumpled the paper in his fist, sighing deeply, a stake driven through his heart. How he wished to save him. But reality is cruel. Sherlock’s dead.
“No, we are not saying goodbyes, not now, remember, we would go to that bar that you liked when we finished this case? I said I would pay for it, I said we could…” Sherlock said as tears swirled in his eyes, but he bowed his head, understanding that fantasy is not reality.
Coughing, Sherlock bent over, exhausted. The doctor swiftly inserted a nasal cannula and secured it under his chin. The bursts of oxygen it provided relaxed Sherlock from his tense state, as he inhaled and exhaled  slowly, he was relived to be breathing on his own.
“I missed you,” Sherlock mumbled, still not letting go of John, his arms tightly wrapped around him.
I pushed the stool away, my jaw was immediately jerked upwards, the pain spiking through my whole body, taking away my breath, as I let out a yelp, the whine escaping through my trembling lips, my feet trying to find the floor. I pulled on the noose with my hand, scraping my neck, oxygen escaping from my whole body. I exhaled, the pain like a million knives stabbed into my body then slowly pulled out with a flourished jerk, oxygen snapped out of me.
