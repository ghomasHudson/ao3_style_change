Still pinned by the cold pressure of Metatron’s blade, the most Dean can do is make an unimpressed face and roll his eyes. “You know, I’m pretty sure that cutting a guy’s essence out of his throat is considered a ‘big disservice’,” he sneers.

As it has been for the last who knows how many rotations, the Takaoka-REST’s soft blue lighting is the first thing that Dean sees when his wakeup routines reach his sensory cortices.
Gabe is satisfied with Dean’s scan results, but the mech’s dumbed-down transit AI doesn’t seem to know what to do with the discrepancy. It takes it nearly ten minutes (practically an eternity) to consult with the RK-NGL’s systems and come to an acceptable conclusion. <
“As you wish,” the thing says, and gently sets Dean back on the bed.

Sam nods. “Did you know any of this beforehand?”
such a deep channelling.” With the completion of whatever she’s painting, the ache in his back recedes further still. “Even with a conduit to your soul, the residual Grace should not be surviving; as such, I am taking measures to ensure you are protected from it until I have a better understanding of what is happening.”
The hand, halfway to Dean’s chest to continue its drawing, stops; the thing’s core, on the other hand, goes kind of wild, and the hum it makes gets uncomfortably loud and shrill. Panic, Dean thinks— that looks like panic. “What do you see right now, Dean Winchester?”
Cas lies bound to a chair straight out of dental hell, metal hardware gleaming in a sick halo around his head, and streaks of blood flow sluggishly from the places where honest-to-fuckin-God
Maybe you should look into what he’s scared of before you go laughing it off.” He pulls at his restraints again and hisses when something on his back responds with sharp pain. “Why would you want Kevin dead, anyway?”
Abaddon runs one slick, grub-covered hand over Dean’s cheek; visceral nausea rips through him as everything in his being rejects the slimy, squirming touch and sulfurous stench. “It’s almost a shame,” it muses while one sharp claw-tip traces the lines Dean knows are still there on his face. “This is such an

The concerned puppy face has given way to Bitchface Number Thirty-Four:
Dean shoots a smug look back at Kevin, who scowls. “The Archangels built Heaven? Like Michael, Raphael, Lucifer, and Gabriel? Those Archangels?”
“I am an
Dean lifts his head just enough to look up at his baby brother, celestial warrior turned up to eleven with a corona of twisting, spiraling currents and sheets of Grace. Six huge, looping currents roar out of and into his back in flowing wings of flame, spread wide and high, and Dean’s never been so damn proud. “Sammy,” he manages to get out. “Lookin’ good, dude.”
The glow, he realizes, is nothing more than his handlight-- the one he’d been looking for since the last full check-in he’d done of the ship. “God dammit,” he grumps aloud, and snatches up the device. He glares at the feathery afterimages of the array bank after switching the handlight off. “Gotta get some fuckin’ rest.”

Dean sends a pleading look at Hannah, but she simply stares back impassively, offering neither support nor opposition. “Aww, come
Within decades, intrasystem cruisers and starliners had dumped mass, shed cubic meterage, and stripped out all unnecessary components. Elegantly curved routes weaving from star to star had been abandoned and redrawn for straight, unwavering lines: Point A to Point B, no frills, no stops. Fins, wings, and rings had been scuttled, thrown to the blast furnaces, and re-forged with only brutal efficiency in mind.
With the third, the doors fall.
Fan-fucking-tastic.
It had to happen eventually-- there are empty berths and passenger weirdnesses on every transit, and this one had seemed a little too peachy to be true. Of course it’s a goddamn academic, too; Dean’s seen more absentee academics on transits than nearly any other demographic. He doesn’t doubt that the poor bastard is probably sitting somewhere on Orla B and staring down at a missed-transit fee. Starlines
Doctor Bagel nods on autopilot. “That’s… not right?” He ghosts fingertips just over Dean’s skin— except for the blistered spots, the touch only feels like poking at a limb that’s fallen asleep. “The blistering's just... gone?" Perplexed, the doctor looks Dean's arm over very carefully, gently feeling at the markings, the peeling spots, and the blisters with gloved fingers. He seems just as confused by Dean's lack of reaction as he does by what he's seeing. "These weren’t visible when you first came in.” Visibly flummoxed but resigned to the results of his examination, he carefully begins the process of re-applying dressings to Dean’s arm. “I'm dressing these anyway. Yep. I'm wrapping them, because it's better to be safe.” He shakes his head. “These have been the weirdest cases of my career. Nearly a dozen people caught at the epicenter of a gas explosion, only one person in the ICU and only briefly, and now this?”
Whatever it is, the outer edges of the thing look like noodles, if noodles levitate in weird, precise spirals and are made out of glowing blue jello. The middle of it is more confusing: it’s blue, it’s about the size of a regular human, and there are more of the jello noodles, but looking into it feels like looking into one of those fun house infinity mirrors— somehow, the dense tangle of glowing goo pasta stretches dizzyingly

Doing a bit of mental math, Dean comes to the only logical conclusion. “When I give the word, step back,” he orders. Throwing open the Impala’s trunk, he grabs one of the spare angel blades and a holy water Super Soaker. Against a Knight of Hell, it’s about as useful as fighting a wildfire with a tin bucket, but it’ll be enough to buy Hannah a bit of time to act. Hopefully.

A long, increasingly awkward lack of talking ensues as the thing’s whine holds steady at ‘I want to tear my ears off’. Eventually, though, the thing seems to finish processing, the noise recedes a little bit, and the human hand returns and finishes drawing on Dean’s chest with the salve.

It hurts to breathe. “Suh?” Another right-shape, but not the same kind— fewer ways, flatter but not flat. Still important. More important than the hot-coppery-wet that burbles up and makes its escape from his lips, or the way he spills from himself. Maybe it’s the name trying to get out. “Cah. Cas.” Metallic wet drips from his mouth with the escaping right-sound; part of him slips from the not-right-shape’s hold and dangles limply, dripping.
Between the nurse returning every two hours and the creepy eyes thing (even the TV isn’t safe any more), Dean doesn’t sleep easily that night. When Sam finally returns at around nine, Dean is exhausted, spooked, and desperately wishing for a bottle of Jack. “Thank fuck. Okay, first— any word from Cas? Two— tell me you’ve got an EMF meter, because I swear to Bonham that there’s something in this room.”
Chuck brings the car to a halt and turns. He stares at Dean searchingly for a moment or two. “Huh,” he says, sounding almost surprised. “You’re serious?”
Lifting his face out of the cold, wet earth with a groan, Castiel flexed each of his limbs and heaved a sigh of relief when no sources of significant pain presented themselves. Something moved in the reeds nearby; Castiel glanced up in time to see birdlike, taloned toes very delicately, very

a kilometer-long, pitch black tunnel shot through by support braces and anchor points, after all-- but after dozens of Watch gigs on similar (if smaller) craft, it’s just a larger variation on a familiar theme.
Dean’s cry of anger is lost in the nova blast of light and sound that follows.
It runs through Dean’s brain on a loop, drowns the pain in his back.

Inventory, as usual, is about as exciting as watching steel oxidize, at least until he makes it to the first of the three berths Gabe had indicated as empty. Like he had been before, NOVAK, JAMES seems to be missing without any particularly suspicious indicators-- caul and seals are intact, biomonitor records show that the creche never registered any cargo mass, and the T-curve is consistent with an empty creche. He double and triple-checks everything, just to be totally sure, but there’s really nothing to find, so he shrugs and moves along to the next creche.
The scan comes up clean, thank fuck-- he probably dodged some kind of time-calibrated bullet because he’s a paranoid bastard and never goes into standby without cutting his intranet connections to everything, ship included. Still, he reconnects to the intranet using his VPN and firewall protocols anyway. Paranoid bastards keep their heads un-fucked-with.
Without any solid data indicating anything off, he can only guess that it’s something to do with time-- maybe he’s finally to the point where shit’s evolved enough to do things like dream. Maybe he really is human under all the other crap-- maybe he’s still the same Dean, the same guy like Sammy had always said.
Dean let out a shameless moan; there were some things he never questioned, and the top-shelf vintage of the ‘about to get savagely fucked by an Angel of the Lord’ voice was at the very, very top of that list.
The collar jangled as it was kicked aside, apparently to make room for the creature. Toes so close to Castiel’s crossed legs that its claws scraped faintly over his jeans, it settled back on its heels and supported itself using the wrists of its wings (where, Castiel noted, there was a sturdy, clawed thumb where a typical bird’s alula might have been) as it carefully nestled down nearer Castiel and the phone.

Some of the outer spaghetti is still hovering in little curlicues, but a lot of it has drawn back into the main noodle-blob. It looks startled. Startled pasta. “You should not be awake yet,” it says. Dean realizes that the ringing in his ears isn’t from an injury— it’s a constant, pitchy

Fat fucking chance Dean’s going to disregard two people on his transit just disappearing from the records, but he acknowledges Gabe’s directive anyway. No point in arguing with the mech about it.
“He,” Dean corrects automatically, and allows himself to be quelled. The flurry of activity has left him tired. “He’s… he’s m’ friend, Doc. You gotta help him.”
Dean throws his hands up with a growl. “Fine! Fine, Jesus, okay! No talking to Crowley. Whatever.” Slamming himself back into his chair, he snatches up
“Klimt, as in Gustav Klimt, he was an Austrian painter. That’s the portrait of—” At Dean’s blank look, Sam sighs and shakes his head. “Never mind. What about it, Dean?”

“Gotcha,” Dean says.

When it finishes, the hands grasp the mortar, vanish with it into the glowy tangle of jello-pasta, and the same twisting-scooting movement happens again. “You have exacerbated your injuries. You are fortunate Abaddon is sadistic, or you would have died much earlier. Please do not complete the task for it.”
Doctor… bagel? Bagel. Doctor Bagel’s hands are gentle but unyielding as he presses Dean back into the bed. “Dean. Dean, I need you to calm down. I don’t know how, Dean, but there weren’t any deaths after the accident— if Cas was there, she’s right here in the hospital and she’s alive, Dean.”

“We’ll get you home, dude. I promise.”
Dark pulls him down for a while.
Castiel went rigid and tense as soon as his fingertips found the spreading damp.
“Gadreel and Samuel have departed.”
Okay. Weirdly exciting bird noise was one fucking thing, but the Impala was entirely another, and Dean would deny to his dying day the noise of helpless arousal that escaped him. Bolting past Cas into the bunker, he half flailed, half flapped, half flopped down the flight of stairs and into the library, hoping to get to his room because he was a
Thoroughly scolded, Dean settles back on the bed while the pasta-thing draws.
Right at the top of the list is a passenger and cargo inventory.
Dean grins. “We’re gonna
Sam just laughs as he guides the Impala back onto the highway. “I was gonna work with the ACLU after law school, jerk. I know.” Once he has Baby up to cruising speed, he relaxes. “So what about these… hot soup people?”
“Naw, you just wait,” Dean says, finally extricating himself from the last of the underlayer. “I’ll tell you all about it, dude. Give you the grand tour and everything, I promise.” He lays a gentle hand over the thick, chilly window in the berth’s insulated metal shell. “You sleep good, okay? I gotta go check up on the forward arrays, and then it’s my turn for a break; I’ll get back to you when I start my next shift.”
Hannah sighs. “I am aware of your history, Dean Winchester. As it stands, you are my best bet at surviving this situation, and considerably improve the odds of seeing Metatron’s reign brought to an end.” Her grey-green eyes glint as she bares her teeth in something that isn’t quite a smile. “I will enjoy that eventuality.”
” Castiel breathed. He knew that jawline, that chin, those cheekbones— had rebuilt them, traced them, worshipped them in quiet moments with hands and lips.
Just like that, Dean’s heart seems to turn to lead in his chest at the mention of Cas. Hot lead, because thinking of Cas means thinking of Cas going nuc— no. Cas didn’t go nuclear. He

Dean touches his right cheek, where he knows the upper ends of the branching red marks Cas left are plainly visible, even through his stubble. He weighs the pros and cons of telling the whole damn story. “Cas,” he says at length, deciding to leave the director’s cut for another day. “He had to go through me to get the other guy.”
Any and all worries about Ezekiel’s thoughts on running headfirst into an angelic civil war fly out of Dean’s mind when he kicks in Buddy Boyle’s office door.
“Uh… what was gone?” Dean asks.
Dean rolls his eyes, still rubbing gingerly at his shoulder. “I know, dude, I know, but just listen— it’s like, the beginning of the Universe or something, man. At first it was all this… I dunno, soup. Really thick, hot soup, and then there were these people living in the soup, and— dude, what?”
Dean wants to make some witty retort, draw out the usual stupid villain chatter more, but some deeper part of his subconscious reacts automatically when there’s a strange shift in the air. Whirling in place, Dean’s raised angel blade crashes against Metatron’s. “What the
Like every other mech Dean’s been in transit with, Benny doesn’t respond to the small talk. Dean’ll get a ‘thank you’ for it at the end, though, and that’s enough to keep him doing it throughout the trip.

, if only for a little, which is really, really weird (and kind of…
Chuck glances at Dean in confusion. “Did you, uh. Did you have another dream?” At Dean’s nod, he frowns. “I… you know, it’s not much different than it is now, really. Not counting time, humans only move and process in three dimensions, but Heaven exists in four, so… a lot of what humans see isn’t really the whole picture. It’s mostly the result of their thoughts and memories imprinting on the lower three dimensions of Heaven. It’s, uh, really malleable.” Without needing to be directed, he turns the Subaru off of 281 and down the little country road that leads to the bunker. “So, to answer your question… I guess it didn’t look like much. Light? There’s probably a lot of that; angels are really energetic. Uh. Not hyperactive energetic; like… uh, they run hotter? Physics energetic.” He eyes Dean curiously. “Does that help?”
The communal chat flips to a map of the RK-NGL. A single passenger berth is flagged; the tag next to the flag indicates that the berth, reserved by one Professor James Novak, doesn’t appear to contain a passenger.
“Who? Dude, that’s Ezekiel.”
Gabe flashes its records of previous inventories-- all of them show James Novak’s berth as empty.

Kevin stares for a moment longer before apparently giving up. “Okay. And Sam?”
Before Dean can protest, Ezekiel lifts his hand, index and middle finger outstretched.
Dean awakens to the beep of a heart monitor. Opening heavy-lidded eyes, he can just make out a blurry image on the ceiling and a masked person doing something near his face. “No, don’t poke at that,” says the person through his mask, and moves Dean’s hand away from his face. Dean isn’t sure what he’s not supposed to poke at, but he complies. He stares up at the thing on the ceiling— it’s some sort of painting, the one with the lady in the gold dress with all the patterns of blue, blue eyes.
He doesn’t quite get to scream.

Okay. So it
“You’re awfully sharp today, Twinkle Toes,” Abaddon coos, circling Dean and flexing wickedly sharp, crimson talons that drip with the tar that seeps down its arms. Dean grunts at the impact of a vicious telekinetic blow, staggering sideways and only just avoiding a whistling swipe of those claws. It parries his attempt at a counterattack with a blasé flip of a wrist. “Did your prophet teach you some new tricks? I’ll have to get in on that before I tear his little heart out.”
It takes Dean’s brain a little while to fully process that statement, and then he’s just confused. “Thought it was jus’ a… a rezzi-whatsit?”
, and… and I can’t lose any more family, y’hear? So go. Get the tablets and get your ass downstairs.”
Glancing over at Kevin, Dean takes in the prophet’s (relatively) relaxed stance. That’s a good sign— if the king of jumpy, high-strung teenagers is reasonably chill around a strange angel while a dick with wings and a demon do their damnedest (ha!) to bust down their door, the strange angel’s gotta be at least a little bit okay. He turns his gaze back to Hannah, who meets it with her own dispassionate stare. “You’re stickin’ around for a Winchester? Cas’ best buddy?”
he gasps out mentally, throwing the prayer out as widely as he knows how. Somewhere else in the garage, Metatron swears and Hannah lets out some sort of shout in Enochian, drowning out the sounds of blades clashing.
I'm going to go get a manicure and go play Magic, because I've decided it's spoil-myself Saturday. Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll run into that navy blue '67 Impala Super Sport 427 with racing stripes that someone around town owns. That or the '66 Chevelle Malibu.
“In most situations, I wouldn’t be able to say I disagree, but he brought it on himself,” Metatron replies amicably. “Naomi had the right of it, you know. If he can’t learn his lesson on his own, which he very plainly can’t, I may as well take matters into my own hands. Well, Bart’s hands, but at my request— you get the idea. Anyway, my only recourse at this point is to perform a little reset. I figure I'll take him right back to factory settings; I could do with an obedient little chump up top.” Dean suspects that, were Metatron not pinning him in place with his blade, the Scribe of Heaven would even be doing the classic dumpy-smug-villain-hand-rubbing thing. “Speaking of whom. Bart? How long now?”

Kevin splutters as Dean gathers up his angel books. “What? Why?”

Sam rolls his eyes. “I’m aware of that, Dean. Just… keep listening. I did more research, and it turns out that you were right about the Universe, too.

There is a lot of physics involved in the process, but at some point the universe started expanding, until it reached a point where it became

Chuck sucks in a breath when the last layers of gauze come away from Dean’s hand. “Wow.”
They still hadn’t told Sam what kind of prodding had been involved or how they’d figured out the Grace thing if it’d been too weak to detect, but some instinct had told Sam that he
He remembers the bite of the needle, the excruciating pressure— before Alastair had taken over with his razor, there had been some bat-faced freak with a particular fondness for them. Seeing Cas enduring the same horror sparks a vengeful, protective fury Dean didn’t even know he was capable of feeling for anyone but Sammy. “I don’t know who the fuck you are, pal,” he snarls, drawing his angel blade and striding across the room toward Cas and the bastard torturing him, “but if you don’t get those things outta him, I’m going to—”
Dean tried to make his confusion known while Cas helped him out of the Impala’s back seat, but the angel seemed oblivious. “I will search the library for relevant material once Dean is… settled,” Cas informed Sam. “Good luck in Wichita.”
Posting this first chapter today, too. I plan to have a new chapter for you every two weeks-- I've got a very demanding new job, but I have a decent buffer of three or four more already written, so I should be able to stick to my schedule. I just hope there aren't too many inconsistencies between Holy Terror and the exposition here; this is my first Supernatural work, and I've learned very quickly that writing a canon-divergence AU for Supernatural is much more difficult than it is for Sherlock. So much happens in so little time!

have been driven into his skull. Blue eyes are open but unseeing as Cas’ lips form a steady, monotone stream of Enochian.
Benny reports out, which is about as close to a “yeah, man, like a baby” as Dean is going to get in transit. He waits while Benny pulls the archived array readouts and the walkover reports from Dean’s shift. Shortly thereafter, an update appears in the RK-NGL’s log-- Benny’s agreed with Dean’s reports, and has signed off on handing over the shift without further action needed.
He rolls his eyes at Hannah’s incredulous, luminous glare. “Listen. It’s either brace that door until you’re outta juice and we both get slaughtered, or step back and put that energy toward holding them off until I can get help down here.” Loops and prominences of energy ripple over and through and around her body in an even, rolling boil now;
Or, I suppose you could, just don't do it until the Chelsea match is over. Football is important.

Hello again. It's been a strange two weeks at work, but the confusion and technology failures have worked out well, at least with regards to this story and a Sherlockian article I've been working on getting into shape for publication.
Dean and Kevin share wide-eyed glances. “Right. Okay. Step one of the plan— don’t get in your way. Got it.” Surveying the library, Dean steps over to the shelves and pulls a few volumes on demons. “Kev, I’m gonna go grab the books we left in the garage. Grab your notes on the demon tablet and go over them for anything to deal with a Knight of Hell. Then, go see if you’ve got anything that’ll nuke an angel from a distance on the angel tablet.” He points at Hannah. “You, I want going through those books. They’re the oldest and weirdest ones, and sometimes those are the best ones. If you finish, check the others on the shelves.” He watches the angel and the prophet get to work, sighs. “They’re gonna try nasty shit to get us to open up, okay? Just… don’t open the door. If anyone’s going out there, it’s me.” Kevin looks like he wants to argue, but Dean just glares him down. “Sit down and read. I won’t have to go out there if we find something quick enough.”

Dean looks up and, sure enough, there’s Chuck, standing in the candy section with a packet of carnival peanuts in one hand and a sixer of El Sol in the other.
A voice speaks to him, but the words remain a smear of noise. The flopping limb is gathered up and tucked back where it came from.

“Oh,” says Doctor Bagel, jerking Dean out of his thoughts. “Wow.” He’s peeled away the layer of gauze covering Dean’s skin, exposing it to the air and their sight. Instead of the usual big, red, blistery, peely patch, though, there’s… well, Dean doesn’t know what they are. Intricate crimson lines curl over the back of his hand and up his arm, forking off like the branches of a tree. They cover his entire forearm, most of his bicep, and continue up his deltoid and around to his shoulderblade; he doesn’t have a mirror, but he suspects they extend right up his neck and onto the part of his right cheek that’s been bandaged. Along the thick ‘branches’ and at the places where they fork, there’s some blistering and peeling, as if whatever caused the marks was hottest at those points, but that’s it. The rest of his skin is just rosy, like a mild sunburn.
“Who built Heaven, Hannah?” asks Kevin. He shuffles uncomfortably when her wide-eyed gaze falls on him. “We, um. We need to know. Who built Heaven?”

“Guys?” he tries calling, but he’s hoarse, and the sound doesn’t carry well. He tries again, but no one comes.
The doctor holds Dean’s arm up again. “Lichtenberg figures,” he says. “They’re the tracks of electricity as it moves through an insulator. They’re not usually so extensive, though— at least, not on living people, and usually more, uh, charred. I've never seen them like this.” He looks up and meets Dean's eyes, solemn. “Something very weird is happening here, Dean. I don't know how you've healed so fast-- I

Whatever the case, he’ll take what he can get, even if it means more history talk that just reminds him of Sammy. If he’s lucky, his brain will spam a few memories of Sammy in a dream, and he’ll get to talk with his baby brother for a while. Something’s better than nothing.
” Dean gasps as he ripostes on autopilot; Metatron lets out an equally startled curse. For all that his vessel’s a dumpy little dude, Metatron is no slouch with a blade, and Dean has no time to dwell on the hows or whys of his apparent Spidey senses when it takes everything he has to predict and respond to the scribe’s feints and seeking jabs. He can hear Hannah engaging Abaddon somewhere behind him, unleashed Grace lighting the room up like a tiny sun.
The creature nimbly hopped aside to avoid Castiel’s folding wing as he pulled himself into a seated position. Clucking softly, it watched him until he was settled and then pushed its dropped object at him again, its posture almost… beseeching?
on top of the data dump in order to win his position as the Night Watch crew. He even gets his own space within the Watch toroid-- not that it’s much, given that the toroid’s sandwiched between the payload ring and the nosecone, but it’s more than anyone had ever afforded him in the past.

Dean pastes on a smile when Sam sits in the chair by the bed. “Just… tell me what happened, and we’ll go from there, okay?” Sam says.
He remembers the old ones, and the demon that stands atop the sundered garage doors, perfect chin raised as the rest of its body roils with billions of maggots and weeps foul ichor, is impossible to mistake for anything but.
There’s glowing, bright blue spaghetti hovering over Dean when he opens his eyes the second time.
The man’s eyes are grey.
in those notes of yours about those marks, or a big black space thing, or the aliens at the beginning of the Universe.” At Chuck’s incredulous expression, Dean rolls his eyes. “I know, I know, crazy talk, but seriously. Whatever happened with Cas is connected to all this, I’m sure of it, 'cause if Heaven’s really like you’re saying, I think I saw it the way angels do, dude. I gotta know something I've seen might help me get him back. If you won’t do it for me, do it for him.”

scale.” She presses her fingers to Dean’s forehead one last time; the sigils on his skin glimmer and then vanish, taking with them the last of the pain in his back.
“Yeah,” Dean agrees. The rosiness to his skin is totally gone— the marks, still crimson, stand out as starkly as a fresh tattoo. The only evidence that there had been blistering at any point is a few patches of light peeling at the intersections of the branching marks. “Those are lookin’ a lot better than they were yesterday.” More and more healed, marked skin is revealed as he steadily unwraps the rest of the bandaging. He flexes his hand experimentally and feels… nothing. Moving his shoulder makes his back hurt again, but his arm seems to be perfectly fine. “The fuck?”
I have this entire story plotted out; it's just a matter of writing the chapters at this point. Thanks so much for being so patient with me.
Kevin rolls his eyes. “You said something shitty,” he cuts in, and while his exasperation is plainly tempered by affection, the statement cuts deeper than either of them expect. Dean’s surprise must read like protest, though, because Kevin lifts a quelling hand. “Listen, I’m sure you had a good point, but this is how it always goes. Just call him up, apologize, and
Sam is permitted into the room after Doctor Bagel determines that Dean is stable enough for visitors. “Jesus, Dean,” he groans, sinking down into the chair that the doctor had just vacated. “What the hell were you doing, man?”
Dean scowls. “As a fuckin’ heart attack.”
Dean sinks into the pillows and gets as comfortable as he can. Before he lets himself drift, though, he takes a deep breath. “Hope you got your ears on, Castiel. I dunno where you are, buddy, but me and Sammy are gonna find you, and I'm gonna find a way so we can all go home, okay? I was wrong to kick you out, man, you’ve done too much. Just… hang in there.
Dean feels a brief press, and then he’s out like a light.
Parts of the thing flicker and swirl sort of… regretfully? He’s not sure how jello glow pasta does regret, but there it is. “You have been unconscious for some time. Three days, I believe.” It ripples some of its tendrils in something that looks oddly like a shrug. “After you passed out, Metatron fled and Abaddon engaged Samuel and Gadreel. Your leg was collateral in this combat. Samuel and Gadreel were able to severely damage the Knight and prevent it from breaching the rest of the bunker, but it escaped before the killing blow could be delivered.” As the pasta-thing speaks, the mortar makes another appearance, along with the very human hands and arms that Dean had seen earlier. Two fingertips dip into the mortar and come up smeared with some sort of paste. “Remain still, please.”

In the week that followed, they had established three things: one, that Deerfield was a terrible place, two, that the dump sites were being used on a rotating basis, and three, that the bodies showing up at the dump sites were starting to look less like Lovecraftian horrors and more like a skinshifter caught fatally between shapes. Sensing that they were on a timer, Sam had gone to the local library to research what might cause the mutations while Dean staked out the next dump site on the rotation.

“It’s where you conducted an angel,” Chuck replies. “In their true forms, they’re… uh, they’re like… circuits. Really intricate, interlinked, multidimensional circuits, full of Grace instead of electricity, and the wires are… uh, like the lines in electromagnetic fields, but not just lines, and not electromagnetic fields, at least not intrinsically, though a field’s kind of a byproduct, and I guess with all that energy, they’d have a gravitational one, too? Oh, and definitely more convoluted, and they resonate at a certain wavelength. Well, a few wavelengths, but—”
‘Cause that’ll totally fly.
It sucks that everyone thinks he’s
Metatron sighs. “Don’t hurt yourself, Bart, just get on with it.”
— the whole situation is Dean’s fault as much as Gadreel’s, and he can’t find it in himself to hurt someone who’s so plainly suffering, never mind someone wearing his baby brother. The memory of Castiel, huddled in his corner, clutching his blade, comes to mind again, and there’s
Swinging himself out of the mech toroid hatch toward the nosecone, he puts this latest weirdness on the proverbial back burner so he can get to the repairs that need doing.
Dean, in the middle of readjusting in his seat for the billionth time, just nods. “Don’t see why not. Might not be too pretty, though; the Tylenol’s cutting a lot of it, but I think it’s gotten worse or something. Haven’t been able to check.” He finally gets settled and heaves a sigh. “Man, this sucks. And hey, what about you?”

?” Sam hissed, slapping a hand over his eyes. He had to fumble around blindly before he could deposit their carry-out on the crappy motel table. “Is this a kinky angel thing? What the fuck, dude?”
Taken aback by Dean’s tone, Sam does his concerned puppy face. “Nothing from Cas, and, uh, no, I don’t?” He rolls his eyes when Dean makes an offended noise. “Dude, you’re

“Yes.”
Almost immediately afterwards, something huge, glowy, blue,
Dean chucks a balled-up candy wrapper at his brother, winces at the twinge in his shoulder and back the motion causes, and crunches down a handful of Funyuns before Sammy can whack them out of his hands again. “Guesh if yuh geh enough shoup bitsh… uh, get them squashed down into one place, they start fusing into one big soup chunk. Makes a lot of light— enough that it stops the rest of the soup from falling in all the way. It’s… it’s a star, okay?” He flaps a hand in frustration. He’s seeing all this crap, and it’s weird and cool as shit, but how exactly do you explain dark nothingness randomly turning into stars and soup people and what basically amounts to a friendlier version of the Nothing from that trippy-ass movie with the dragon? “Thought you’d like this kinda shit, Sammy. ’S like Harry Potter in space.”
“You’re in luck,” says Metatron, and Dean just about jumps out of his own skin. The angel, seated comfortably in an armchair opposite Dean, flips on a lamp and settles with his hands folded over his gut. Sam is on his knees at the angel’s feet, wrists bound by chains etched in Enochian and gagged with the sleeve of his own flannel. His eyes are wide and terrified, fixed on Dean, but it isn’t Sam looking out through them. “Well. Your little friend the Prophet is in luck, at any rate.”
“And God said, ‘These are the things I give to you that you might shape the Universe, and also a safe Haven from—”
When he’s pretty sure he won’t pass out if he tries to sit up, he very carefully rolls onto his left side and then heaves himself upright. Hands and feet respond like they should; plenty feels like shit, but nothing feels broken, thank fuck. Brushing sand and dirt out of his hair, he gets a good look at patchy sagebrush and reddish-yellow earth, all gently lit by sodium-yellow light. Turning gingerly— his back is apparently not okay with any sort of twisting, either— he lets out a sigh of relief. There’s a gas station not two hundred feet away.
Green eyes fluttered closed and full lips curved in a relieved smile; when Castiel lifted a hand, Dean did not hesitate to press his cheek into the touch. “Sam, I found Dean. The bird creature— it’s Dean.”
“Uh,” Dean says, because how the hell does he explain this? ‘Oh yeah, Sam’s been possessed by an angel and said angel was assigned to kill you, but turns out the angel’s terrified of some ancient angel myth that I’ve gotten tangled up in, so that’s been called off, but now the angel and Sam are out there somewhere doing God knows what’?
“Promise?” Dean demands. “No jerkin’ me around or disappearing, man. This is Cas.”
Sam types as Dean talks. “And it… breaks?”

Even more reason to give it shit, naturally.
Hannah stands from her chair and sheds her blanket. “I would not doubt it.” Another boom and a crack cut through the air, and she goes rigid.
Metatron narrows his eyes. After a moment of glaring at Dean, he huffs out an incredulous laugh. “Suit yourself.” Gadreel-in-Sam collapses with a thump, and Metatron props his feet up on his back again. “Since I have you here, though, let’s get down to brass tacks before I deal with you. Where’s Castiel?”
. Castiel was there in a clap of wings and a gust of wind, though, waiting in the library, coat and blazer cast to the side, shirt and pants unbuttoned, and Dean could no more refuse the mesmerizing divots of Cas’ hips or the curl of Cas’ feathers than he could turn down homemade apple pie fresh from the oven. He tried, of course— croaked in mortified not-quite-protest, cloaked himself in his wings, tried to explain without words that he wanted (oh yes he

curious to know just how far you’ll take it.” It bends down until Dean can feel the foetid, rot-warm air that flows from the void of its face. “You’re right, of course,” it says, and Dean screams as the force holding him motionless tightens, cracking ribs and completing the break in his left arm. “You’d give up your own humanity to keep your little family breathing, wouldn’t you?” The grip tightens again; Dean’s vision begins to go black at the edges. “Your soul, the world and everything in it, even your own brother’s free will— why, Dean, I’m frankly impressed.” Abaddon runs its hand through his hair; grips tight and yanks his head back. He’s almost grateful that he can’t feel anything over the pain in his ribs and arm, because he can see the maggots and sludge as they drip down his face, past his eyes. “Still. It’s better that I nip this one in—”
and I’ve still got everything else on my list that needs doing,” Dean grumps. He pats Sammy’s berth gently, then twists so he’s perched against the gangway that runs between the rows of creches. “I mean… I’ll get over it, dude, but seriously. You gotta admit it’s pretty dumb.”
Dean’s dreams are fuckin’ weird.
“Not much choice,” Dean grunts. He twitches a little when the salved fingers make contact with his chest. “So… I’ve been dreaming?”
“Yeah. I know,” Chuck says, quiet, and Dean remembers suddenly that he
Dean and Sam share a knowing look over the doctor’s head as he bends to begin unwrapping Dean’s arm. Neither of them are strangers to caring for burns, though they don’t tend to suffer those quite as often as gashes or broken bones. “Better pay attention, then, Sammy,” Dean teases. Sam rolls his eyes.
“The word you’re looking for is ‘comma’, Dean,” Kevin says.
Hannah doesn’t say anything, just starts running in the direction she’d seen Dean go earlier.

dead,
The ground gives a mighty shudder, and then there’s a sudden flurry of frantic motion by Metatron’s feet— Gadreel has a hand free, and he’s pulling at the chains and reaching for Dean, and—
Hey, y'all. Sorry it's been so long. Work is the most stable thing in my life right now, and work is still a post-merger shitshow, so... yeah.
“Uh,” Dean says, lost. This is not how anything involving tentacles or tentacle-adjacent appendages is supposed to go. Not that he’s arguing, but seriously, this ‘polite tentacles’ thing on top of the pain and the demon in his garage and the everyone being missing and the everything else? He’s got no idea what’s going on. None.
Dean gets to his feet as soon as Hannah steps back from his side and surveys the ruins of his old t-shirt. Shrugging, he unrolls his flannel and pulls it on. “So, what’s your plan?” he asks.
Apologies for the very short first chapter. They get longer, I promise (there's a bad joke in there somewhere, I think). At any rate, there will be space and angel trueforms and all that good stuff, so thank you for giving this a chance, and I hope you enjoy!

because he was a fuck-up and a useless friend, and now Cas was hurt because Dean was too busy kissing up to some dick angel who might not even be living up to his promise to heal Sam. If he'd never asked Cas to leave, this never would have happened.
I wanna give a shout out to AKF and YANA. They literally saved my life on Sept 9, zero hyperbole-- 'I am enough, I am not alone, and I will always keep fighting' got me through the darkest, scariest, most hopeless place I've ever been in. I cannot express how grateful I am for everything they've done.
“Purified blood’s in the blue curse box by the storeroom door. If that don’t keep him happy, I dunno what will,” Dean says quickly, extricating himself from Kevin’s embrace. “G’wan, kid. Guy’s a slimy jerk, but he’ll be fighting to survive, too, if… well. Make him think you’ll be useful and he’ll keep you with him when he runs away, ‘cause he always does. Now get— I’ve got a garage to shore up.”
Still dubious, Kevin takes up the chalk and begins to write on the open lane down the middle of the garage. “I’m gonna laugh when you’re wrong and we end up with an angel in the garage instead,” he says as he writes. “It’s gonna smite that stupid car of yours, and I’m gonna

There’s endless north Kansas farmland out Dean’s window when he wakes up, but it barely registers.
“Exactly. Also significant— stars didn’t form immediately after that. For a while, the universe just got bigger and colder. Hydrogen didn’t even form right away, but once it did, clouds of it started collapsing into stars— huge ones, as you said.

In the dim light from the phone, the creature’s shadowed form resolved into dark, muted, slaty blue-grey breast feathers capped by a throat patch of rich, burnt orange plumage, all fluffed against the Chicago night chill. Castiel followed the tawny feathers up to the creature’s jawline, which was…

Castiel had, of course, immediately volunteered to assist in the hunt— though he and Dean were by no means a typical ‘couple’ and frequently worked independently of one another for days or even weeks at a time, Castiel cared deeply about his partner— so Sam had delegated him to search the park where the woman had reported the animal attack. The park, when he had arrived sometime around sundown, had been quiet and mostly empty. A suspiciously pungent, smoke-filled Mercedes-Benz had pulled out of the vacant lot just as he’d backwinged to a landing near a tall, wooden sign, and he’d only encountered one jogger on the gravel loop surrounding a small, verdant wetland. For the jogger’s safety, he’d waited until the woman had departed to begin his sweep of the wetland.

The suited fucker carefully adjusting one of the needles in Cas’ head barely spares Dean a glance. “I wouldn’t approach, if I were you,” he says coolly.
Kevin’s expression goes from ‘resigned to doing things Dean’s way’ to ‘what the fuck are you talking about, Dean’ in about half a second. “Dude, what?” he demands, eyeing Dean askance. “Dean,
Tilting his head back, Chuck thinks for a while. “Uhh, it could? I never had many ideas about side-effects of conducting. It, um. It doesn’t exactly happen often, and most of the time it kills the conductor. Since there’s left-behind grace, though, dreams might be pretty normal.” He shrugs, then pats around for something in his pockets. “Here,” he says as he produces a scrap of yellow paper and a pen. He scribbles a number down and hands it to Dean. “My number. Call me in a few days— I’ll go through my old notes and see if I have anything written down that I’ve forgotten about.” Dean tucks it away in his wallet. “Listen, um— would it be okay if I, uh, took a nap?

He has to fight down a tightness in his chest after attempting to convey the depth of his relief, and then his eyes are watering or some shit, and he hopes Cas doesn’t think he’s actually all worked up or something, because he’s totally not. Besides, there’s no telling if Cas is safe or not; can’t have him thinking Dean’s… soft or emotional or weak or something, when it’s just dust in the air. Dude’s gotta focus on staying alive, not on Dean’s breathing and eye problems.
The pasted-on sigil flashes; Dean sighs in relief when the pain from his ribs and arm goes down to a dull ache. “Th… thhhanks,” he slurs, feeling very, very relaxed.

Pressing his legs together with a soundless click, Dean levers himself feet-first into the open Takaoka-REST pod that’s been his home sweet home since leaving Orla. Except for the missing atmo panel, the high-gauge standby lines, and the heavy-duty power line, it’s exactly like every other hotel pod Dean’s ever been in-- a bit over a meter wide, a little under a meter and a half tall, two and a half meters deep, and plushly cushioned on every wall but that of the hatch. It’s probably the most unnecessary thing on the whole damn ship, given that Dean could do just as well with a run-of-the-mill standby dock like Benny and Gabe use, but he’s not about to argue if his employers want him to have a few creature comforts.
Dean groans. He requests Gabe’s shift report, navigates to it when all he gets is a link, and scowls when, sure enough, there’s evidence of short-circuits in the array banks he’d just checked two shifts ago. There hadn’t been any sign of wear or tear then, but then again, little shit like this pops up all the time during transit. High-γ travel is part and parcel of modern life, sure, but it isn’t perfect-- Dean would be out a Sammy-supporting job otherwise.
“Fuck my life,” Dean mutters, and lets his head fall back to the rolled-up flannel it had been resting on. Looking up at the ceiling, his gaze drifts over one of the cleverly-hidden devil’s traps in the ceiling panels, and something occurs to him. “Uh. Guys? What happened to Metatron and Abaddon?” Hadn’t that been a thing? He’s pretty sure he remembers that being a thing. “Why aren’t we… you know, kicking ass?”
. They were supposed to study the universe or something. ’S why they broke the soup in the first place.” Twisting, Dean endures the renewed ache in his back to retrieve a packet of Funyuns. When he opens it, the first one he pulls out is actually two Funyuns all stuck together—

Dean lifts open hands in surrender. “I’m sorry, okay? It’s just… what did Heaven look like before there were humans?”
Dean knows a hell of a lot better than to fall for the angel trap when Gabe’s out of transit. It’d become pretty clear right away that Gabe had booted up with ‘little shit’ set to max plus one, and its pranks had been infamous throughout the Orla Docks long before Dean had ever arrived. That didn’t stop Benny and Dean from referring to Gabe with any and all manner of affectionately insulting, feather-related epithets, of course. The irony had been pretty delicious, especially when rookies had started their first shifts.
“So they’re all freaked out ‘cause everything’s even darker than before and they weren’t expecting that, but they’ve got this nerd job to do, but then the broken soup starts lighting up into stars, and then they

Dean glances up just before the nurse turns to leave.
Seated on the bed because the chair at the desk is hell on his back, Dean has to go through some nine or ten of the Men of Letters’ books on angels before he finds anything about those freaky-ass needles, and even then, it’s not giving him any ideas on how being subjected to them again is going to affect Cas’ ability to recover (because he’s out there, probably hurt, but out there,
The thing, when Castiel picked it up and ran his hands around it, proved to be a small dog collar, complete with tags and a portion of still-attached leash. “Thank you,” he said, because what else did one say when presented with apology dog accessories by a potentially dangerous alchemical experiment?
Dean blinks. He’s still stuck on the first part. “
Dean kinda misses the way the mech used to lord it over him.
“Home sweet underground home, Dean,” Sam announced from the driver’s seat as the Impala came to a halt. Dean, still robbed of human speech by whatever the fuck the dead alchemist and her dead witch friends had done, made a rude sound (mimicry of non-word noises, he had learned, was an extremely viable option). After waking up feathery and then enduring three swampy days of hiding from aging Stepford wives armed with rabid, vicious purse rats, his reward was getting stuck lying on his back like some kind of overgrown Thanksgiving turkey in the back seat of his own car for nearly ten hours. If that wasn’t justification for being just a bit shitty, nothing was. “I made some calls, and there’s a guy in Wichita with a manuscript that matches some of the fragments we recovered from the high school. I figured I’d drop you and Cas off here.”
If he waits until he’s sure Kevin’s turned the corner into the library before running like hell for the garage, no one’s around to give Dean shit about it.
A twist of a needle and the words spilling from Cas’ lips go deep and sonorous, filling the room the way Dean had always imagined an angel’s voice should. They change, too— the cadence of the syllables is different, something about it seeming… old, maybe. Primordial. Dean doesn’t think he imagines the look of confusion on the suited dick’s face. “I… think I’m close?”
After a few minutes of fiddling with the standby jacks and wrestling with the power line (someday he’s gonna get around to reprogramming so he’ll have that piece of shit power port somewhere
At least, it’s familiar on most trips. Something’s a little off as Dean makes his way noseward-- there’s a glow coming from behind the hatch into the nosecone and the forward array banks. It’s pretty blue, but the area around it doesn’t register as temperature-hot, thank fuck. Still, Dean’s whole frame prickles with high alert. There shouldn’t be light from that part of the ship. End of.
Once he’s given himself just enough time for a satisfactory sulk, he plugs into the output jack, switches video inputs, and looks over the last month of data from the array. Except for a cluster of blips in the 450 nm range a few days ago, the readouts all look pretty normal-- just the usual bunch of Doppler-shifted noise from stars and regular pings from navigation posts along the RK-NGL’s route. Even the blips aren’t anything huge, really. Dean’s seen others like them, especially on that one supremely fucked-up trip from Landung to Dàodá that, among other things, had involved passing through a (distant) pulsar’s jet range.

“He’s not a clone of Michael, so he couldn’t, uh, move through you perfectly? You… uh, you weren’t a perfect conductor for him, so he hit resistance, which caused heating and then burns. They’ve healed fast because of… um, I guess you could call it residual charge?”
That was the ‘post-hunt fuck’ eyebrow. What the hell did Cas think he was doing, trying that on
An invisible hand slams down on both of Dean’s shoulders, knocking him to his knees before the demon. He bares his teeth up at the blackened abscess in reality and spits. “You’ll have to kill me to stop me, bitch,” he snarls, struggling against an unseeable iron grip.
The air in the garage twists again, and a new light, savagely blue-white, explodes into being. Abaddon wails, its hand and psychic grip falling away, and Dean crumples to the floor. He smiles as familiar booted feet plant themselves in front of his face. “
in beating it back. No one’s in the room doing the usual shifts to watch over whoever’s hurt the worst, so either he’s not the one hurt the worst, or… there’s no one who knows the drill left.
“Do you know what they are?” Sam asks, leaning closer to examine the lines that haven't been covered yet.
Ever since the infusion after the crash had finished its job, dreams have been increasingly rare. Whether it’s a factor of age or structure, Dean isn’t sure, but when there’s no way to reverse anything, he doesn’t much care about the whys or wherefores. Instead, he hoards his dreams like gems-- lately, it feels like the only trustworthy proof that he’s still himself. Still

The ‘tampered creche’ trope is an old favourite in crime procedurals, but it’s a hell of a lot easier said than done-- by now, it’s something of a contest between Takaoka and Kryonik’s R&D groups to see whose anti-tamper measures troll would-be vandals harder.

All told, it’s nearly three days after start-up by the time he gets an all-clear readout on every segment in the forward array and can finally slam that hatch shut behind him.
A blurry face swims into view, then resolves as Dean’s vision clears. Kevin looks as exasperated as ever, but he also looks
with cold every time he accidentally bumps into the aluminum plating. He thanks human laziness for the fact that transit security footage is only viewed by robots post-arrival-- cold can’t kill him, sure, but he still makes a very undignified scramble for distance and comfort all the same.

Dean grimaces. “Fuck off,” he tries to growl. It comes out as more of a breathy whimper; sitting up is so not an option. “Where’s my brother?” He remembers most of the fight— Hannah holding the doors, Abaddon wrecking his shit— but he only remembers seeing mega-Sammy for a moment before passing out. “Where’s Kevin? What happened? Was… was I asleep?”
No one’s there.

“What the
“Fuckin allergies,” Dean grumbles through a stuffy nose, and scrubs at his wet eyes.
I can't begin to apologize enough. Work and health these past three months have been... demanding, for lack of a better word. The surgery in early November to fix my illness was successful, so no more ER visits or being homebound with agonizing pain (yay!), but some of the permanent aftereffects have been challenging to cope with, especially with a month and a half of wall-to-wall business travel. Hopefully I'll be able to focus more on my health and my writing now that work has hit a quiet period.
“Said he wanted to do a ‘hard reset’ or something,” Dean replies, clenching his jaw. “I think it’s the same thing that Naomi bitch did to him.” He ignores his brother’s concerned look as he fumes. He still gets nauseous thinking about what Naomi did to Cas. Seeing his friend, badass Angel of the Lord, cowering and whimpering in a corner, clutching at his blade like a safety blanket instead of a weapon… it was

it— couldn’t imagine a world without him, angel or human or anywhere in between. Had lived it for a year, and it’d been the worst year of his life, and he just… couldn’t do that again. So he’d pretended, and prayed to an angel he’d been sure was dead, and lied and lied to himself that there was hope until maybe someday he’d believe it, and he’d forget.
Sam is not responding the way he should be. Instead of nodding along because Dean is completely right about this, he’s looking at Dean like he’s started speaking in tongues or something. “Dean… dude, I’m not saying you’re seeing things, but… the eyes in her dress aren’t blue.”
Cas looks a little bewildered when Dean pulls him to his feet and divests him of his beige coat and suit jacket, but when Dean starts tugging him toward the jungle gym, his face lights up with understanding.

Speaking of Metatron. ‘
Dean doesn’t even answer; just slumps back on the bed enough that he can watch the thing without re-crushing his ribs.
back seat back in Omaha, bitch!” Dean snipped. Sam heard cheap blankets and sheets shifting; when he risked lifting his hand, Dean was sitting on the bed wrapped in a bed sheet toga and Cas… Cas was staring at Dean like he’d stared at the burgers at that metal joint in Chicago Dean had dragged them to.
Dean takes a moment to gaze down at his brother’s quiet face through the berth’s porthole, and then makes his way inward through the payload ring.
Thanks again for reading, y'all. :hugs, if you like them:
Pointedly, Sam waggles the call button before handing it to Dean. “Listen, dude. It’s almost nine, so I’m gonna go get dinner and a motel.” He rests a hand on Dean’s shoulder and squeezes. “I’m glad you’re all right, jerk.”
Chuck stretches out in the reclined driver’s seat and huffs out a laugh. “It’s no Baby, but it gets me around.”
Dark brown eyes flick upwards for a moment. “Sam is waiting for you outside,” says the masked figure, dabbing gently at Dean’s numbed cheek. Dean heaves an internal sigh of relief. “Do you know where you are, Dean?”
He tries to picture Cas in his trench coat scruffing and drop-kicking Metatron right off of his high horse. Cloud. Whatever. It’s funny in his head; hopefully that translates. ‘
“Metatron?” Kevin asks, beginning to move around to the end of the table farthest from the door.
The lights flick on; groaning, Dean squints against the glare and aims an irritable glance at the nurse, an older man with salt-and-pepper hair. To his credit, the nurse has the good sense to look somewhat apologetic as he moves to check over the machines around Dean. “Good to see you awake,” he says. “I’ll be in every two hours; it’s protocol with concussions.”
The mech, it seems, is only just situating itself in its standby dock. <
Dean, recovered from his allergies now that they’ve gotten into the foothills of the Rockies, shrugs and promptly regrets it when his back twinges in protest. It’s nowhere near as bad as it had been, though; he makes a mental note to find and thank whoever it was that invented Tylenol when he’s in Heaven next (because seriously, with his life? He’s going back at some point or another). “Had days like that. Not so much any more, but when me ’n Sammy were younger, man, we’d drive fifteen, twenty hours without stopping for much more than food or a piss.” Not that they really
“Uh, normal?” Dean offers, and sits through another round of Concussion Quiz. Except for the headache, he passes with flying colors. “Sorry, dude. Guess it just looks different in this light.” Thinking of the blue eyes he’d seen in the woman’s dress, he’s reminded that Cas still hasn’t been located. “You’re probably working a lot of the accident cases right?” he asks. “My friend, Cas, was there too. Nerdy accountant type, messy dark hair, blue eyes, talks like he gargles gravel?”
Eventually, though, humanity had shed its dreams of gleaming, frog-legged saucers, beringed pyramids, and ominous wedges. Leaving the system permanently had become less and less of an option with the way the War Between Worlds had continued to spark bigger and bigger satellite conflicts, and wishful, nostalgic frivolity had quickly been discarded in favour of relentless survivalism.
Metatron rolls his eyes. “Sheesh, I know you get stupid about the guy, but this is ridiculous. You were
Dean didn’t have any objections to that. He was stubborn, yes, but he wasn’t stupid, and a giant bird-man was not going to win Sam any points in Wichita. He did direct a questioning look at Cas, though, and was surprised when the angel responded with

“This is a terrible idea,” Kevin says. He follows Dean down to the dungeon anyway, scuttling out of his way when Dean does an about-face for the garage instead. Dungeon’s no good— Crowley’s down there, and Dean doesn’t want the smug bastard running loose when Metatron’s out there somewhere, apparently hellbent (heaven-bent?) on crossing out every name in his black book. The guy does
“Broken… soup.” Right on cue, Bitchface Thirty-Four makes a repeat appearance.
Dean waves a hand. “Nah, dude, it’s cool. Was kinda planning to get some sleep myself.” Maybe not right away, of course, not with this latest revelation to think about, but sleep is definitely going to happen sooner or later. He wiggles his toes in the footwell and fiddles with the seat until the back reclines. “’S roomy for a little foreign car.”
about his damn back.
Chuck yips; the car swerves wildly into the other lane before he can get it under control. “You scared the shit out of me!” he gasps, white-knuckling the steering wheel.
Better than the ‘courtship dance’, at least. “Don’t blame me when you and David Attenborough here were the ones taking up the room, jerk.” Turning to Castiel (who was still staring), he asked, “You wanna explain the ‘courtship’ thing? I thought we’d… you know, fixed that part.”
They finally pull over at a tiny rest stop somewhere just east of the Colorado border. Chuck staggers out of the driver’s seat and squints blearily in the midday sun, running fingers through hair that looks like it hasn’t seen a picture of a comb in days, never mind the real thing. “Man, I’ve gotta sleep. I’ve been driving… I don’t know how long I’ve been driving. Is that bad?” He shakes his head. “That’s gotta be bad.”

“Metatron is there, and so is the Knight of Hell.”
Adrenaline obliterates pain for an instant; instinctively, Dean lunges away, and rediscovers his bound arm and splinted leg too late to avoid the edge of the bed. He hits the floor and pain explodes fucking
Kevin scowls at Dean over a messy fan of crumpled paper. “I’ll open the door if you do.” When both Dean and Hannah shoot him alarmed looks, he rolls his eyes and tosses his head with exasperation. “
The Impala’s engine was back as soon as Dean advanced on Castiel, no longer idling but roaring, and the sound sent delicious vibrations through the ruffled feathers of Dean’s neck as Castiel ran his lips over them. Deft hands slid along Dean’s sides and buried fingers in the little feathers lining the undersides of his wings; Dean moaned and then
“You’re not gonna last more than an hour like this. You’re all… bursting at the seams.”
Through swimming vision, Dean sees Abaddon turn and make its way toward the inner garage door; heaving himself to his feet, he lurches after it with a roar. Wriggling white bodies fly out in a spray as Dean’s blade slides uselessly through the squirming mass.
Dean, someone just blew the Gates wide open, and Gadreel’s gonna

, because they obviously have him held somewhere. Probably chained up, because dicks with wings seem to like doing it old-school. They’ve got him chained and warded, and that’s why he’s not responding to Dean’s prayers. Mind set, Dean flexes his hands in anticipation and welcomes the tingling burn that zings up his right arm. “Screw that ‘if’ shit. We’re gonna get him home and safe, Sammy. I don’t care who I have to go through— we’re getting him home.” He aims the thought at Cas, too, wherever he is. He’s not dead, and Dean’s gonna bring him home. That’s all there is to it.

Kevin subsides reluctantly. “We never do,” he mutters, “but okay, whatever.”
Sam’s prediction isn’t far off the mark, as it turns out, but at least Gadreel doesn’t decide to like,
’ he thinks, willing the thoughts to reach Cas, wherever he might be. ‘
The falsetto squawk of protest Dean’s elbow to the side draws from Sam is almost worth the way the Impala swerves. “Wreck my baby and I’ll drag your giraffe ass outta Heaven myself, bitch,” he scolds, barely dodging Sam’s retaliatory swat. “Besides, it gets weirder— it’s
Dean and Kevin share a baffled glance. “Uh. Hannah,” Dean ventures, stepping closer to the fire. It’s burning hotter than he remembers it usually doing— must have been a good batch of oil. “You’re in the Men of Letters bunker, Hannah. We, uh, had a question?”
“Huh,” Dean says. “You do, don’t you?” He thinks about it for a moment. A few years ago, he’d been totally weirded out by it, but after everything else that’s happened, he’s… almost relieved. At least Chuck won’t ask questions or sit there pitying him. “You’ll get used to it pretty quick. Go do your thing; I’ll be back in five.”
” Metatron kicks Ezekiel again, then very pointedly props his feet up on his back. “I guess there’s something to be said for the whole ‘if you want it done properly, do it yourself’ thing, am I right? Honestly.”
Dean replies, and flails around behind himself until he can grab his power line and tug it free of its jack.
At a loss for words at that pronouncement, Dean and Sam sit in silence as Doctor Bagel works on, hands as steady as his blue-eyed gaze.

“No… like, weird spikes in energy, or blue things, or, like, space stuff, or--”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Dean says, but he can’t get close enough to the flames to put them out. “Kev, help me out here, man, this ain’t right.”
Dean doesn’t respond, just raises the Super Soaker to intercept another claw swipe. Abaddon shrieks when its claws split the reservoir tank and splatter holy water everywhere; for a moment, the maggots and tar covering its hand and arm are burned away, exposing damp, sagging grey flesh riddled with pits and open sores. Dean’s able to press the advantage for a moment and even scores a hit on the exposed arm, but a second on-target blow merely sinks sickeningly into a renewed layer of squirming grubs and ooze. Abaddon trades blocks and attacks for only a few seconds more before lashing out with another telekinetic blast, this one double the strength of the last.
“Glad to be all right, bitch,” Dean responds easily. “I’ll be better, though, when we find Cas and gank Megatron and his patsy.”

It takes Gabe a little longer than usual to answer, like something about Dean’s query has it stumped. <
They run through the usual battery of questions once Dean has a moment to gather his thoughts, and Doctor Bagel’s conversational patter gives Dean a better idea of what went down at Boyle Ministries. Whatever that explosion of light had been, it hadn’t left much more than a twisted wreck of the offices— how anyone had survived, never mind
Hannah’s in front of the garage doors when Dean catches up to her, palms pressed flat against the metal and feet planted at shoulder width; she looks immovable, every line in her body tensed as she braces the doors. Whorls and loops of blue-white light spurt from her skin and clothing as if under pressure before being sucked back out of sight by some unseeable force.

“So, uh… are you gonna explain why you’ve got some kind of… uh, really crappy Harry Potter costume makeup going on? You know the scar was on his forehead, right?”
“Not any more,” Dean replies. “Someone ‘blew the Gates wide open’, apparently, and it’s enough that Angel Air is back online. Megatron’s been moving to deal with the folks he sees as threats, but I figure he’s gonna be on the back foot for a while as he deals with pissed off angels, so now’s as good a time as any to get some information, right?” He ducks out briefly to run for and rummage through the storage room, returning with a clay flask of holy oil, chalk, and the parts for an angel summoning. "We're gonna have to ask some other angel, though. Cas isn't picking up."

He scrabbles lamely when the thing reaches out with two huge pasta-tentacles, then tries thumping at them with his good arm when they curl warm and soft under him, but he may as well be punching water. He ends up clinging to them when they lift him like he weighs nothing. “The hell’re y—” He can barely talk through the pain screaming through his ribs and leg. “Pu’me
As he scans the rest of the report, he has to do an actual double-take and scroll back to the top of the inventory section just to make sure he isn’t seeing things.
During the last inventory he’d run, the creche had reported a mass of seventy-three kilos, but now it’s showing zero all the way back to launch. The same goes for creche temperature-- before, the T-curve had been typical for a one point eight meter, seventy-three kilo male with middling to high muscle tone and lower body fat levels, but now it’s just another near-textbook cooling curve for a given volume of standard starliner canned air.
does he think about it.
Despite his mounting worry, Dean huffs out a laugh. “He wouldn’t have the first clue-- he’s not really a sports guy. I… maybe he was, uh, further away than I was, and didn’t get hurt so badly.” If only that could be the reality of the situation, Dean thinks unhappily. More than likely, Cas is wherever Metatron or Bartholomew are.
Dean considers the marks on his arm. “So… that means what?”

“That’s right,” the masked figure confirms. He smooths something white over Dean’s cheek. “I’m Doctor Boeglin, Dean. Do you remember what day it is?”
Hi, y'all. It's... been a bad year. I'm so, so sorry about the delay. January through August was wall-to-wall merger activity, complications from gallbladder removal, and getting no help in dealing with a really toxic, manipulative, scam artist of a coworker (who actually turned out to be potentially toxic to the whole damn company, but that's another story for another time). Dealing with all that culminated in hospitalization in September for severe anxiety and stage three burnout, and most of the time since then has been recovery. I'm doing a lot better, now, and I'm glad to finally be in a place where I can *create* things again.

“I asked you,” Metatron says slowly, as if speaking to a small child, “where is Castiel?”
, why would I have that with me?” He moves through the room with a new wariness, however, which mollifies Dean somewhat. When Ezekiel doesn’t show up in the pause that Dean intentionally lets drag on, he takes it as an all-clear-- the guy might be a creeper, but he’s been good about keeping Sam safe.
As the gauze comes away, Dean watches curiously. Wrapped up as his arm was, he must have had some nasty burns, but he didn’t know much beyond the fact that they weren’t severe enough to merit surgery. He hopes he won’t be wrapped up too long— he has an angel to bring home, after all, and he’ll need his arm for that. Cas must have survived, after all. He’d been human once, and that’s made him sturdier, because he has a soul. Dean’s gonna need his arm, then, because there’s no way Cas isn’t under guard, not with both Metadouche and Bartholomew holding him prisoner like they so obviously are.

pissed when they figure out that their marks weren’t even on the ship,
Chuck nods. “Um. Yeah. You’re a vessel, so you’re a conductor for angels that resonate at certain wavelengths, Michael’s in particular. Thing is, every angel resonates a little differently. This… I think this was Castiel, because Bartholomew and Michael’s resonances aren’t anything alike. He, uh. He would have just incinerated you. Castiel and Michael, though— they’re a lot alike. Harmonic, I guess.”

“Shit,” Dean groans. “Shit, shit, shit.”
Dean’s close on her heels, but as soon as he hears footsteps behind his own, he skids to a halt. “No, no, no,” he says, catching Kevin before he runs past. “
“A what?”
Sam huffs out a laugh as he folds himself into the driver’s side door. “Says the old, white dude.”
That’s what it says.”
The hug seems to be what does it, because Kevin throws his arms around Dean in return. “You’re a
Wow. I am so not used to people.” He gathers himself, then swings into the driver’s seat, cracking into the carnival peanuts while Dean gingerly takes his seat on the passenger side. “So. I… well, I hadn’t meant to come this way, but I just had this… uh, feeling, I guess, and… here you are. What happened?”
Then again, that’s sort of what dreams had been like, before: a random jumble of memories, tossed out and turned into a story by the brain. He remembers that much, at least.
I’m gonna have to stay on VPN the rest of the time in case there’s any other intranet fuckery going on. Can you believe this shit?”
He’s in his bedroom in the Bunker, so that probably means Abaddon didn’t
Dean sighs and tips himself back against the chilly, un-cauled surface of Sam’s berth. “This transit sucks, Sammy. I mean, not as bad as that Landung-to-Dàodá clusterfuck, but it’s getting there pretty quickly. Send me some positive lawyer mojo, would you?”
Still, that bright place toward the end of the dream had been… maybe not the ‘I’ve-been-there’ kind of familiar, but definitely the ‘I’ve-been-somewhere-like-this’ kind. Heaven had been a lot more understandable— hallways, fancy lights, gardens, memories, and all that— but something about that white place had seemed really, really similar, kinda like the motels Dean stays at. The decor and shit changes, yeah, but the grime on the keys, the mildew, and the questionable stains never do. The white place had been blank and fake, just like Heaven.
Without warning, the doors buckle under a brutal impact, then flare blue-white as Hannah’s Grace blooms out from her vessel, spilling into and against the metal. The dent in the door corrects itself with a shriek, and the light fades. “They are using conventional impacts,” the angel grunts, resetting her feet on the floor.
“Went out on the mass drivers today, Sammy,” Dean says as he shucks the skintight underlayer of the exosuit. The magnetized gauntlets, kneepads, and boots of the external components are already neatly tucked away in their cubby by the airlock. “Another eighteen months, another three point five tee. She’s holdin’ up like a champ, though-- these new-fangled cruisers are somethin’ else.”

When he wakes, they’ll be another year and two point three trillion kilometers closer.
“He’s on a job,” Dean finally says. “It’s… we kinda fought about it, ‘cause he hasn’t been feeling well, and…”
“I was thinking about what you said earlier,” Sam says, still focused on the laptop screen. “What you described sounded a lot like the way stars form. Exactly like it, in fact.”
‘Neurotic’ must be a prerequisite for being a prophet, because Kevin jumps a mile when Dean plunks down across from him with a fresh notebook, a pen, and an armful of books on angel lore. “What the hell, Dean? Warn a guy!”
A bit of snooping around the rest stop after doing his business turns up a battered first aid kit; Dean relieves it of a strip of alcohol wipes and a roll of gauze. He rejoins Chuck by the Subaru and sits down in the open passenger side. “So the doc called ‘em ‘Lichtenberg figures’ or something. ‘S what happens when you get hit by lightning, but he says they’re usually not… well, most folks just die when they’re this bad.”
A woman, dusky skin spattered with dried blood, approaches and gently presses two fingers to Dean’s forehead. The itching on his chest stops, and the ache in his back dies down a bit. “With a strong resonance, a channelling can reach the soul. It’s very rare, but it has happened once before,” she says, daubing her fingers into a jar held in one hand. She begins to paint over his skin with clinical precision. “There is, however, no precedent for
Dean keeps pointing upward, because the eyes in the lady’s dress had turned blue again sometime just after the last nurse’s visit but just before Sam showed up. “The eyes, man. In her dress. When I first woke up last night, they were all this crazy blue colour, just like now, but when the nurse wakes me up a couple hours later, they’re…  not.

It takes some time— Kevin is just as jittery as Dean around the flames and the garage’s ancient fire extinguisher refuses to work, so the prophet ends up resorting to throwing an old bag of concrete mix over the flaming oil. They manage to get the shocky angel up to the library, where they install her on one of the comfier chairs and wrap a blanket around her shaking shoulders. She calms after a while, and lifts her head to regard Dean and Kevin with damp eyes. “It was a trap,” she says. The first hint of anger begins to kindle in her eyes. “Someone led us there to be slaughtered.”
The quickest way to get from point A to point B on the ship, the goway is the cylindrical, two-meter-wide space between the inner surfaces of the toroids and the heavy-duty strutwork of the RK-NGL’s spine. Once upon a time, he would have found it scary as fuck-- it
That brings a smile to Chuck’s face that, for some reason, strikes Dean as strangely knowing. “Okay, then,” the ex-prophet chuckles. “I’ll do that.”

, a secret, small part of him thinks, even if he’s probably fucked Cas up somehow just by contact). Weirder still— intentionally or not, Cas has left behind enough Grace that it’s strong enough to heal the damage he’d done. “So why’s my back’s killing me, if it’s all healed? Why’ve I been having weird dreams and seeing things?” he asks. “Would the leftover stuff do that?”
“— the bluer it is,” Dean finishes.
Satisfied, Dean exits the car and hurries down the stair to the bunker. He’s got research to do.

Dean nodded, then groaned as Cas’ fingers rucked themselves into the feathers of his wings.
“Dean,” it says, fever-bright crimson lips curling into a smile below the bloody-edged void that sits where the upper half of its head should be. “How lovely to see you.”

Hannah nods. “God gave Their Archangels the knowledge to shape the Universe, and the Archangels in turn taught the Seraphim, who helped them craft Heaven. When we, the least of the Malakhim, were born when the Darkness was sealed away, the Seraphim taught us, that we might be armed against it in the event that it finds a way to return.”
He tries to move his arm to scrub at his eyes, but it doesn’t budge-- it’s bound to his chest, he realizes, to stabilize his shoulder. Breathing brings with it a horrible, sharp-toothed pain in his ribs on both sides. Finally, when he tries to roll out of bed, he discovers his right leg a) hurts a hell of a lot more than his shoulder or his ribs and b) has been bound up and splinted.
quickly as one’s velocity increased-- even the sparsest regions of the interstellar medium would blast away a poorly-designed craft’s hull in very little time at an appreciable percentage of the speed of light. Changing course mid-transit, yet another pre-Diaspora science fiction favourite, had led to several well-known explosive disasters due to catastrophic structural failures. Excess mass and pretty-but-useless bulk had rendered the earliest starliners so fuel-hungry and slow that humanity had very nearly abandoned space travel on the basis of cost-- when even a team of multinational corporate CEOs couldn’t foot the bill for something, it was far, far too expensive.
“Fuck,” spits Dean. It’s the Bunker’s one shortcoming, really, next to the fact that any old human with a key can get in— though the builders designed it for strength and warded it six ways to Sunday against everything from angels to zombies, high-powered mechanical force from plain old
, was baffling the authorities. For lack of a better explanation, they were calling the event a gas explosion and the survival rate a miracle. Dean, apparently, had been one of the more severely injured, having suffered burns all the way up his right arm and parts of his face (said facial burns, apparently, were what he had been instructed not to poke at). The rest of the survivors, mostly visitors and Boyle’s employees, had escaped with scrapes, bruises, and a few concussions.
“I undid the physical transformation,” Cas replied, “but removing all of the Grace and reversing some of the psychological changes would have been dangerous.”
Castiel risked a glance upward at the owner of the feet. He couldn’t discern much— the creature was backlit by the dull orange of a cloudy Chicago night sky— but its silhouette looked mostly humanoid, well-formed, and pleasingly symmetrical, at least from the shoulders up. It seemed to have broad, powerful wings where a human should have arms, however, and narrow but sturdy legs ending in those long, clawed toes.
“Was that…?” Kevin asks.
Sam finishes topping off the Impala’s tank, holsters the nozzle, and pays before cornering Dean by her trunk. “Dude. Did you take something from the hospital? Are you still seeing things?” Dean swats at the hand that comes up to test his forehead and ends up having to duck to avoid it; he keeps forgetting how sturdy Sammy really is.

“So… soup people in a… black nothingness?” Sam asks. After a long moment, he laughs. “Man, I want whatever you’re on.”
For the second time that day, Dean sails through the air and hits the ground hard. Concrete is nowhere near as forgiving as dirt, though, and Dean gasps as something in his left arm crunches unpleasantly. The Super Soaker clatters away in pieces, useless.

Hello, all. Posting this early (well, not technically early, as it *is* Saturday here, but normally I post at noonish rather than midnight...), mostly because chapter eight is fighting me tooth and nail despite being planned out, and I would like a distraction. Please feel welcome to ask any questions in the comments, or even just say hello-- I'd love to make a few friends in the fandom, being somewhat new. :)
“Knew you’d agree, bud,” Dean hums. Always the nerdy one of the two of them, his Sammy-- if it isn’t planetary law, it’s starliners or Pre-Diaspora history or biology or whatever other topic that’s caught his attention and imagination. Dean’s always hard-pressed to keep up so Sammy won’t ever be bored or without someone to talk to. “You’re gonna flip when you hear about these new ablation shields. Slicker than fuckin’ BAM, man, and just as hard-- you’ll say she looks like crap, but she’s a damn tank, Sammy. Shit’s unbelievable.”

Sam had learned to accept a lot of weirdness in his life. Dogs talked, Oz was an actual place, and just three months ago, his brother had spent about half a week in North Shore Chicago as some kind of bird chimera thing, so he’d had plenty of practice. There were, however, some things that

Kevin raises an eyebrow at that, too, but it’s got just enough amusement in it that Dean doesn’t feel like a total moron this time. He flips through his angel book, skims the list of names, sticks a finger on a random name, and hopes the angel he’s picked— Hannah, whoever they are— is still around. They stand back when Dean tosses the match to light the holy oil and Kevin finishes the summoning incantation.
“Have you looked at this guy?” he asks, accusing. “You’re in charge, yeah, but I’m sorry, this whole ‘big bully on the playground’ shtick?
Thank you for reading! I hope this is a fun read, if nothing else.
Enjoy, and thanks for reading.
“There,” Dean interrupts. “That part. The way you’re reading it, God gives the angels Heaven, right?”
Castiel’s phone chose that moment to ring. Both he and the creature startled, but when it made no move to attack him or the source of the noise, Castiel slowly, slowly reached into his coat pocket and drew the phone out. “I found it,” he said quietly upon answering, holding the phone in front of his face instead of at his ear just in case the creature took belated issue with the device.
By the time he’s a meter or so from the hatch and its little window, the light is so bright that he can see his own hands and arms as he gently redirects his careful drift up the goway. Their unnatural gleam is even weirder in the eerie, blue glow.
“This is exactly like I pictured it,” Chuck says, leaning close to look at Dean’s cheek when that bandage comes away, too. “Exactly. You said you were touching the metal of the needle when the explosion happened, right?” At Dean’s nod, he continues. “Yeah, wow. This is

As Castiel understood Sam Winchester’s account, the situation was as follows:
Thanks again!
The second impact is followed by an ominous groan, and Dean’s prayers go wide-band.
The nurse looks up at the picture on the ceiling. “No…? That’s been up there for years.” Brow furrowed, he gets out his penlight and checks Dean’s pupils. “How’s your vision?”
A bit too much like it, actually, and after Sam (or had it been Gadreel?) had told him that he’d essentially recounted the history of the Universe in retelling those early dreams, it has Dean wondering if maybe this isn’t something real, too. “Hey, Chuck?”

no way he’s gonna be able to hurt the guy now. “Stop it,” Dean growls. “Put him down.”
“But—”
That draws a huff of breath from Sam. “It’s nothing like that, but yeah, I like it. It’s… interesting, actually.” There’s that thoughtful face again, and Dean has a strong suspicion that Sam’s gonna go back to the bunker and geek out on space stuff just so he can tell Dean all the stuff he got wrong. “You’ll, uh, have to tell Castiel all about it if we get him back. I bet he knows how it actually happened.”
She doesn’t look pleased about it, but Hannah turns to Dean and gives one small shake of her head.

“It is the least I can do.” The thing stands there for a moment, still unsettled, and then gives a surprisingly human sigh. One of its tentacles slides through the air toward him. “Sleep. We will speak again.”
There, Sam had explained, was where things started to go wrong. Dean had called at about four in the afternoon to tell Sam that the bad guys had shown up in a midsize BMW and dropped off a body, but there were signs that it had been frozen for some time. Moreover, the bad guys had been students at a nearby high school— a football player and a ‘basement denizen’, to be precise, both free of demonic possession. Sam had not elaborated on what a ‘basement denizen’ was, but its presence in alliance with the football player was apparently unnatural and thus indicative of a very powerful and/or very charismatic leader. Dean, intending to locate the leader, had followed them back to the high school and had been preparing to break in when he’d ended the call with Sam.
“Jesus, I hope not. I ain’t cleaning up after you,” Dean replies. He grins when Chuck shoots him a disapproving glare. “Sorry, man. I just had a question. You up for answering, or you need a minute to breathe?”
He gets one last, raised, ‘I-know-what-you’re-up-to’ eyebrow before Kevin caves and goes back to the tablet, running his finger over the tightly-packed lines of runes. “See? Right here,” he says, tapping the stone. “It says, ‘
Thinking of Cas means thinking of Metatron and Bartholomew getting their dick hands on him, not him going nuclear, and Dean’s going to pluck Megatron and Bartholomew like goddamn Christmas geese for daring to hurt his angel
“When I tell you to, step back.” Dashing for the garage entrance, Dean throws the emergency doors shut, a grim smile forming when he hears the ‘click’ on the other side of the handleless plates of steel. He levels the Super Soaker as he hurries back to Hannah’s side, squints against the neon Silly String glare of another impact absorbed and neutralized by Hannah’s Grace.
sliding to a halt with a pained groan.
Bartholomew draws another needle and poises it directly over the center of Cas’ forehead. Dean lunges forward as he draws it back, manages to get a hand on Cas’ shoulder and the other around the bastard’s wrist, but the angel’s strength wins out, and the needle plunges home.

Dean raises his eyebrows. “Huh.” He can’t help flinching back from the fourth impact, which hits with such force that he can hear the suspensions of the cars in the garage complaining. “So… they’re gonna get through eventually, aren’t they?”

condition to pull a trigger, never mind hunt down and tear apart a couple of winged megadicks. At the very least, he can get some rest and hit the road in the morning. “Get him to bring me something for my head, would you?”
Hannah steps back and, when the damage from the next impact comes, it stays.
That call had been three days ago; since then, Dean had neither appeared nor called, the high school had been closed due to a chemical fire in the science wing, and someone had just reported that a ‘barking bird-dinosaur-man’ had attacked their ‘Maltie-poo’ (Castiel was still at a total loss as to what the latter creature might be) in a park not far from the next dump site on the rotation Sam and Dean had worked out. “Best guess is that they finally did it,” Sam had said, looking grim. “Made their… thing, whatever it was they were working on, and set it loose. I don’t know if Dean’s gone to ground or if he’s hunting it, but… maybe if we find the thing, we’ll find Dean, too.”
Kevin frowns. “Uh, yeah, a lot. It

because it’s sorta true. When he and Sam really butt heads, Dean’s mouth just… spits shit out without asking his brain, ‘cause Sammy’s always had a knack for breaking down his filters. He hates it, but it’s never been something he’s been able to stop, no matter how hard he tries, and ‘I didn’t mean it that way’ is right up there with ‘I’m not racist, but…’ in the bullshit-o-meter red zone, so it’s not like he has any justifiable way to explain why he’s such a dick.

Dean replies, and opens the hatch to his pod.

a possibility. Cas can’t be dead, because Dean won’t let him be dead. Not again, not this time. Cas survived, somehow.
It’s good progress.
Sam had barely gotten back from Wichita three months ago when he’d been greeted by Cas and a fully-human Dean. They’d explained that Dean’s transformation had been a success due to the unintentional involvement of a angel’s stolen Grace— whose, Cas hadn’t been sure— and that the remnants of that Grace, though too weak for Cas to pick up on easily, had been just strong enough to be the ‘glue’ holding the transformation in place. According to Cas, it had taken only a few minutes of prodding before things simply ‘unravelled’ and Dean returned to his proper form.
“What?”

“They were all dead, but… but it sounded like Heaven, and then the Gates, and…?” The angel seats herself inside the ring and wraps her arms around her knees. “Oh Father,” she gasps, and hides her face in her arms and knees.
to retreat after yet another impact, she capitulates to Dean’s reasoning. “Very well.”
Sam’s still doing the face when he looks up. “It’s a Klimt.”
“I don’t know why you persist in this when you know you stand no chance,” Abaddon says as it turns to regard a panting Dean. “Whatever you’ve done, it’s an improvement, but I can’t honestly say you’ve been anything remotely resembling a challenge.”

“The prophet stuff,” Chuck replies. “The visions, the weird dreams, the, uh, you know, the ‘talking with God’ stuff. It doesn’t happen any more, except for the occasional hunch like today.” He shrugs. “It freaked me out a bit, so I left.”
The nurse gives Dean a sad smile. “I’m sorry I couldn’t help,” he says, tucking away the penlight and leaning down to add to Dean’s chart. Dean’s totally ready to roll over and go back to sleep, but as the nurse stands, a flash of blue catches his attention. On the nurse’s ID card, the photograph’s eyes are blue— too blue, in fact, compared to the rest of the image.
Hope you enjoy, and thanks for reading.
Floating in front of the open hatch, Dean’s skin prickles and buzzes anyway-- no matter the number of modifications or years, the old lizard brain’s reflexes still resurface from time to time. Scoffing at his animal ridiculousness, he shakes it off and gently propels himself into the array bank.
The clerk, some blue-eyed ginger kid with an auto magazine, barely gives Dean a second glance when he walks in. Just to be safe, Dean moseys into one of the snack aisles, hoping to hide the fact that he doesn’t have any shoes on for just a bit longer. He digs around in his pockets— his jacket and flannel are probably hanging from the headboard, where they’d been when Gadreel gave him the whammy— but he’s still got his wallet and a silvered knife, so at least there’s that.
As soon as his heel hits the floor, some sort of sigil flares to life and races right out of his bedroom door.
He opens his eyes to warmth and a soft blue something pressing against him. He’s moving, a steady swaying, and there is a foggy smudge of voices. There might be words in there somewhere.
Almost as if to punctuate her pronouncement, there’s a thunderous
