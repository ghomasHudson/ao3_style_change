Dean looked at the vampire, deciding his next carefully. “Benny, you’ve been by my side for months, I-“
“What if we had fun without having sex?” Dean offered, formulating a plan in his head quickly.
“Come for me.” Dean pleaded. “You look so pretty, baby.” He clenched his thighs together again. “I love you.”
Sam smacked him with the notepad he was holding, so Dean whacked him in the shins with a crutch. “Ow!” Sam complained. “I was much nicer.” He smacked Dean at the base of his neck, and Dean whacked him with a crutch again. “Oh, you want to go nuclear?” He asked with a glimmer in his eye. Snatching Dean’s crutches, he made a show of holding them above his head, while Dean scowled.
Castiel look unconvinced. “There may be ice in the parking lot.” He fretted.
The Angel smelled of purgatory still, all rotten blood and decaying bodies, but Dean couldn’t find it in himself to be upset when Castiel picked him up. When he was laying in bed, Castiel pulled away. “Stay.” He pleaded, grabbing the lapel of Cas’ trench coat. He eyed the angel’s lips, eyes flickering to them, then back at Sam. His brother was staring too intently for him to steal a kiss, so he settled on licking his bile covered lips instead.
They snort halfheartedly; it’s half-past ten and Dean’s two thirds deep into a six-pack already. “Foggy’s gotta be a hell of a lot better than whatever he is now.” Bobby replies.
Castiel had been sitting in the bunker kitchen, and Dean stumbled in with a hand on the wall. “Hey, Cas.” He greeted, limping to the sink for a glass of water. “What are you doing, sitting in the dark?”
Happy with the water temperature, Castiel flipped the lever that allowed the shower to turn into a spray. All the bedrooms in the bunker were equipped with bath/shower combinations, but the bathtubs were far too small for Dean’s frame, leaving the hunter with a preference for showers even when in agony. “I’m going to lift you over the edge of the bathtub.” He stated. “I do not wish for you to slip.”
It’s not a surprise to him that his brother needs a cane- shit, he’s probably needed one for years, but it is surprising that Dean is actually
At least if he were the unlucky one, he wouldn’t have to go through the pain of seeing his brother destroyed by the one monster they couldn’t kill.
“Sounds riveting.” Dean replied sarcastically. He began to make his way back towards the hallway his room was attached to but paused when he noticed Castiel was still sat at the table, looking idly at the bookcases. “You coming, babe?”
Dean smiled, leaning into the kiss, but started to lose his footing and began to slide. “Fuck.” He muttered.
Castiel was nude by the time Dean made it into the bathroom, and already had the tap turned on, waiting casually for the water to heat up.
“Oh, fuck, oh Dean.” Castiel moaned. He began pumping in between the soft flesh, fucking the hunter’s thighs heartily. “You feel so good.”
residing on Cas’s half of the bed. Stepping out from the meager warmth beneath the covers, he slid on his robe quickly, not wanting to lose any heat. Maybe he’d throw an extra blanket on his bed tonight. He’d been viewing the chill as an easy way to burn calories, but it couldn’t have been fun for Cas to cuddle an icicle.
“Dean?” Sam questioned. “C’mon, answer him, what are you seeing?”
Castiel exhaled. “The many men, so beautiful! / And they all dead did lie: / And a thousand thousand slimy things / Lived on; and so did I.” He quoted. “I know what that mariner felt, Dean. What this overwhelming grief feels like, to live on after seeing souls die at your own hand.” He looked down at the sleeve of his trench coat now, remembering the gore of his brothers’ flesh and grace that had coated it in heaven. “I killed so many of my brothers.” He whispered. “And I cannot promise you that I will not claim the life of one more angel.” He added. “But I don’t want to put you through that. I’m staying here, forcing myself to view you to remind myself that I still have purpose, Dean.”
They pour the first round of bourbon early that day.
Cas looked up from where he stood in the corner. “Hello, Dean.” He closed his book and sat down in one of the leather recliners Dean had furnished the place with, gesturing for the hunter to sit in the other one. Rather than do so, Dean sat on the floor next to Cas’s leg, pressing his face into the angel’s knee. Cas brought his hand up to stroke Dean’s hair softly. “Or shall I say, hello, my beloved.”
“You’re here.” Dean soothed, rubbing the angel’s back. “I’m right here. You didn’t leave me anywhere.”
And the angel Castiel held the righteous man as he wept.
“How lucky.” Cas teased. “Because I adore petting your hair.” He let his fingertips sink deeper, massaging Dean’s scalp, feeling as the tension melted away from them both. There was something so addictive about this dynamic- Dean letting himself surrender, Cas getting to control something no matter how hectic the world seemed, and the angel felt a smile tug at the corners of his lips. “How about a bath, my dear?”
“Yes.” He replied, swallowing a lump in his throat.
Castiel closed his eyes, reading the next passage of his poem.
Dean snorted. “Well you know, I thought about going to the McDonalds around the corner, but y’know...”
“And I love you.” Castiel reassured.
“Aw, you’re no fun.” Dean complained, taking the coffee happily.
“Thanks.” Dean grunted as the angel handed him his crutches. Once inside, Cas took one so Dean could use the handrail, and trailed closely behind him in case he fell.
Dean rubbed himself against Castiel’s now leaking dick, and the angel cursed in extasy. “Fuck.” He moaned. He grabbed Dean’s ass harder but looked concernedly at the human. “You’re in too much pain.” He declined. “I don’t want to hurt you.”
Dean sighed. “I suppose you’re right.” He began undressing slowly, his eyes on Castiel. There wasn’t lust in them though, just a light Cas hadn’t seen in some time: Dean was determined. “I’m adding something to our to do list.”
“Good.” Sam looked at Dean’s thinning body, no longer concealed beneath layers upon layers of flannel. “You want something to eat?”
“Stubbed my toe.” Dean lied, gritting his teeth at the wave of dizziness.
“I’m fine, Bobby.” Dean insisted. “No frostbite, no hypothermia. Just shitty joints.”
Dean thinks he should be agitated.  He doesn’t want to be coddled, or even worse, pitied. Somehow, the tone and Castiel’s voice let him know that’s not what going on now. Can isn’t sad
Castiel’s brows were furrowed. “Come sit.” He soothed. “Drink some coffee. Would you be willing to have some broth?”
There was something about Dean’s soul Castiel never could quite put his finger on. Whether it was love or holiness or even the same scar Atlas bore, he never could quite figure it out, but when he looked at Dean- really looked at him, past the face and body he wore, past the anguish and pain he carried, there was something intoxicating.. Something that begged of Castiel to keep looking.
The fragility of the albatross perched atop a ship’s railing was so close to the fleeting lifespan of the man he loved that Castiel felt himself breaking.
The rest of the shopping was uneventful, even though Dean’s attempts to screw over Sam were met with great distain from the angel. Once they crossed through the doors of the bunker, Dean stalled at the top of the stairs.
Standing, Dean arched an eyebrow as Cas made his way to the door, still unclad. “As much as I like your ass.” He stated. “I think you might give Sam an unwanted eyeful if you waltz into the library in your birthday suit.”
“…Infant tomatoes?”
“I wish I could believe that, son.” He dumped a small handful of pills into Dean’s hand. “You warming up yet?”
Dean smiled at the pet name. Castiel remarked that it was one of the only terms of endearment in the language, and that while it literally translated into
Dean smiles softly. “Thanks, Cas.”
“Too bad.” Bobby replied. He stretched his arms carefully. “I’m going to go ask the front desk for some more blankets; you got enough pillows?”
Opening his eyes, Dean widened as he saw two figures, rather than just his brother who was in front of him. “Sam?” He whispered, going pale. “I’m hallucinating.”
“No.”
Castiel’s eyes flickered to Dean, before looking back to Benny.  “Nothing. I take it your hunting was successful?”
, getting zero results before starting the process over again, and the boredom and hopelessness was hitting full force. He was on edge, an itch behind his eyes and a shake of his hands he couldn’t blame on low blood sugar for once. “I’m gonna see if Cas has found anything.” He told his brother.
“How will I know if the yogurt was made in Greece?” The angel asked.
Castiel sat down in the chair next to Dean, idly scanning the library shelves for a book he hadn’t read yet.
“Nah, some things should stay sexy.”
“Tell me about it.” Castiel requests.
Castiel paused in the doorway, a beer in one hand and an amber-colored blanket draped over his shoulder. He put the beer on the table next to Dean and pressed a kiss to his hair. “You look far more comfortable now.” He murmured, before toeing his shoes off and removing his trench coat.
Dean tightened his back muscles, feeling the stab of sharp pain in his spine and trying to convince himself it’s grounding, somehow. All it accomplished was a pained gasp to slip out. Knowing his chance to bolt was gone, Dean tried to conjure something resembling a joke. “Do you think I’m pretty enough to be the new face of LifeAlert?” He asked cheekily.
The Dean that comes back from hell is not the same Dean that Sam buried in a pine coffin.
Castiel crawled back onto his side of the bed, two fingers held out. “May I?”
It’s not like Dean blamed him- he’s of no use on a hunt with a hip that won’t stay in the socket for more than ten steps, and he knows from John’s drunken ramblings that the sigh of Dean’s bent-back elbows and floating kneecaps were enough to remind his father of Mom. It still stings though, to not be asked to help with research or
“But you would have come for Dean-the-anorexic.”
“You keep saying that.” Castiel murmured as he turned to look out the window. “But I’ve yet to feel it.”
“Didn’t peg you as a hostess.” Bobby retorted, exiting carefully.
“Back.” Dean grimaced.
In an instance, they’re in a dimly lit room with nary a window. The walls are such a deep blue they look almost black, and the only furniture in the room is a California king bed. “Wow.” Dean jokes. “Didn’t peg you as the kinky type, Mr. Forty-Year-Old Virgin.”
“Up here?” Dean inquired. Still feeling surprisingly dizzy, he relented and leaned back onto his elbows.
“I’ll meet you in the map room, then. Any chance of more coffee?”
Sam scrunched up his nose. “Guess I’ll go get my headphones.”
“Just come lay next to me for a bit, until the idle-whatever-“
Cas is. When they were running in purgatory, fighting every second of everyday, he seemed almost human. Now, as Castiel picked him up bridal style, carrying him like he weighed little more than a feather, he was reminded of the unbridled power that is merely contained behind the façade he knows as Cas. The angel- the warrior of heaven- just placed him gently down on the closed toilet, undressing him gingerly, like the oversized hoodie and sweatpants are the only things holding him together anymore. He wanted to scream at the angel to just leave him alone and let him die in peace, and the other half wanted to binge and purge until he knows that this was finally real, and not another dream about to turn into a nightmare the second he opened his eyes. “Why are you here?” He finally settled on, as Castiel carefully maneuvered him to take off his T shirt.
Castiel shook his head. “You are not porcelain, Dean, not something that shatters. You are the coal deep beneath the earth, turning to diamond. You are the seed which fractures to birth a plant. You are, and always have been, the most beautiful thing I’ve laid eyes on. I know you can’t belive that right now, but please, know that it is my truth.”
Dean snorted. “I’m flattered. Mind handing me one of your pillows, then?”  Castiel did as requested, and Dean placed it betwixt his bony knees. “G’ Night.” He murmured.
“I ain’t dead yet.” Dean reassured. “But Cas, you have to realize that’s a part of the appeal, right? The idea of dying a monster-less death… That’s appealing.”
Bobby looks thoughtfully out the window. “I got a few doctor friends.” He muses. “Maybe they could get him on painkillers or something.”
Castiel shook his head, clearly not understanding all of Dean’s personality quirks. “I’ll be right back.” He said. “Do you need anything while I’m up?”
And then he stood and fought until he met Benny. He ate what Benny ordered him to, no more, no less, and after almost passing out a handful of times Benny seemed to grasp the unspoken rules of their symbiotic relationship. His memories of humanhood being hundreds of years in the past, Benny seemed to time the meals around whenever he was hungry, tossing Dean a jackrabbit or small basilisk every few days before drinking the human’s blood. Afterwards, Dean would find himself wrapped in the vampire’s coat, and the lightheadedness from blood loss was close enough to the high of hunger that he would feel almost okay for a while. It’s in these quiet moments that Dean lets Benny fuck him, and with blue eyes and dark hair staring at him, he wonders why he still feels so empty.
“The lord works…” Castiel starts.
“Mhhrph?” Dean grunted, sitting up carefully. His back felt good, the vertebrae in, with only a little residual swelling. His ass was definitely bruised, his tailbone probably as well, but all things considered he felt a hell of a lot better than expected.
“No way!” Dean protested. “I want some trees. What if we have a beehive instead?”
“Show off.” Dean teased. Then after a pause, “You don’t have to do this.”
“My apologies.” Cas replied, turning to grab Dean’s crutched from the car. Rather than handing them to his boyfriend, he got out of the car and opened Dean’s door to hand him them from the outside. He watched carefully as the hunter heaved himself out of the car and onto the salt-covered pavement. Sliding into the just-vacated driver’s seat, he gave Dean a faint smile. “I’ll meet you inside.”
Dean nodded, readjusting himself to place his head against Cas’ when he felt the angel’s erection. “Oh,” He breathed.
“Don’t back out now, Cas.” Dean begged, fingers stripping the shirt from Cas’s torso. “I’ve missed you too much.”
Dean allowed himself to lay down fully. “Thank you, Benny.”
Castiel smiled. “I love you too.” He replied, pressing a kiss to Dean’s neck.
Castiel chewed his lip nervously before cutting Sam off. “Dean’s state is not that critical yet.” He reassured.
Somewhere between being eaten by hellhounds and shedding his wooden onesie, Dean has irrevocably changed.
Castiel nods somberly. “And you?” He questions.
Six hours later, Dean wondered why there were so many rewritings of the bible. Sure, it had some good moments (that fat king dying on the toilet came to his mind), but overall, it was kind of a snooze fest. He’d been digging through Sam’s backlog of bible PDFs for what felt like forever, opening one, hitting CTRL + F, typing
“I asked for carrots, and you brought home cake.” Sam complained.
After giving the hunter a few painkillers (he’d been talked into narcotics so quickly Castiel wasn’t sure whether to worry, but that was a discussion for another day,) Dean fell asleep against Castiel’s shoulder while engulfed in the soft light of
Dean nods. He’s going to need it to find Cas.
Dean nodded, and the pair sat down on the leather couch. “I was twenty-two.” Dean recalls. “Sammy was at Stanford, and Dad didn’t come when I called.”
to die.”  His voice cracked, and he felt a tear drip down his face. “I want to die.”
Inhaling sharply, Dean opened his eyes to see the hunter covering him with yet another blanket. “How’d you get here so fast?”
“You sure you’re okay, brother?” The vampire asks again.
Dean shook his head. “Cas, last night, with you quoting Coleridge… it felt like the most open you’ve been. It was like I could peer past the curtains in your mind. I want you to read to me, but you chose the book. I want you to read what you feel like reading.”
“Of course.” Castiel replied. “Eating is a social activity, I’d forgotten. I’ll get some toast.”  When he sat back down, twice-cooked bread in hand, the hunter was on his eighth spoonful and looking like he was amid a war. “Dean.” He spoke softly, “How can I make this easier for you?”
was too plain a word. Nice was flowers on an anniversary, or breakfast in bed. Nice was far too simple a word for what he and Cas were to each other during purgatory.
“I’m okay.” The hunter replied, turning his head to look at the angel. “How are you feeling? Nearly gave me a heart attack when I woke up in bed without you.”
The vampire pulled away from the cut, wrapping a length of cloth around it. His head was clear now that he was full, and he hadn’t realized how bad of shape Dean was in when he began his frenzy. “Shit, brother.” He drawled. “You should’ve said something earlier. I’ll go get you something to eat.” He looked at the angel. “You can keep guard, I assume?”
Sam closed the book on Skinwalkers he’d been reading. “I’ll go put another pot of coffee on.” He said. “You want a refill, Cas?” He asked, nodding to the empty camp mug next to the angel.
“Yellow?”
“Want to watch a movie?” Dean offered.
“Oh, do not tell me you two were betting on that.” Dean scolded. “Besides, I sodomize Cas all the time.”
Dean smirked and walked up behind Castiel, hugging him and resting his chin on Cas’ shoulder. “Wanna fuck?”
Castiel sighed before resting his head in his hands. “This place… it weakens my grace by the day.” He admitted. “Fatigue is simply something I must become used to, I suppose.”
“One hundred and twenty-eight pounds.” Castiel announced. “That is how much you weigh Dean.” He scrubbed at his face, wishing suddenly to be clean shaven. “Your heart-“his voice croaked. “The wall of your heart is thinning. I don’t know if I can repair it in my current state.”
Not-quite Sam looks at him quizzically, clearly thinking of telling Dean point blank that he dislocated his knee, not sprained it. “It was a quick hunt.” Almost- Sam says instead.  “Surely you don’t
“So, you’ve come to gank a Winchester.” He spoke to whatever had just entered the motel room. “Shame for you, it’s more of a mercy kill than a fight right now.”
one. He’s not pretending he’s fine when he’s clearly in pain or brushing off a dislocated kneecap as nothing more than a twist.
Dean pondered this for a moment. “Sammy made me eat a banana a while ago.” He admitted. “You know how he gets about potassium. I’ve had a few yogurts, as well. Some crackers, too.”
The phone rings before going to voicemail, so Dean hangs up and tries again. And again. And again, then a fifth, sixth, and seventh time before finally leaving a message on the eighth.
“Let’s not ruin the moment.” Dean grimaced. “I’m enjoying the view, thank you very much.”
His fingers speed dial his Dad before his mind had even caught up.
Brushing a hand softly through Dean’s hair he began to recite
Cas pulled out the list. “My apologies.” He corrected, then, with air quotes, “baby tomatoes.”
“Please don’t mention my father in the same sentence as Dean and I exploring each other carnally.” Castiel called from the kitchen.
Castiel bit back the urge to tell Dean he wouldn’t be so cold if he just ate. There were more important things at hand, literally.  “I’ve missed you, as well.” He replied. “Are you ready for more?” He scissored his fingers tentatively, trying to decide if he could fit a third digit in.
Not one for orders, Dean waits less than a minute before crossing through the bunker door. He’d called Cas to help him, not replace him. Bracing himself against the handrail, he places his left foot on the first step down before slowly easing his weight down onto the leg. He grits his teeth as shooting pain attacks his hips, while he feels the bones of his knee grind together. Picking up the right foot carefully, he puts it beside his other.
Sam jumped a bit at the voice coming from the dark kitchen, but relaxed as he flipped on the light and saw it was merely Castiel.  “Hey, Cas.”  He accepted the proffered cup of coffee with a half-smile of thanks. “Dean still asleep?”
Dean smiled and walked up to the angel. “So, you planning on sticking around a while?”
“Nah.” Dean declined, humming with content as Cas started to carefully bathe him, rubbing a washcloth across his chest as the hot water continually beat down. The bathtub was cold against his back, though, and he found himself suppressing a shiver.
“Let him.” Castiel spoke quietly.
Dean nodded, and Castiel was gentle as he lifted him. Carefully putting him down, Cas positioned them so Dean’s back faced the water, with himself facing Dean’s front so he could support the hunter. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas’ shoulders, and the angel grabbed the base of Dean’s ass to help hold his upright. “Thanks, Cas.” Dean murmured. The hot water felt luxurious as it loosened the muscles in his back, and he moaned happily.
What he didn’t brace himself for is the patch of black ice that’s suddenly under his feet, and then, even more unexpectedly, under his ass as he falls.
Dean didn’t know how much Sam knew, but he’d walked in on a mumbled conversation between Bobby and Sam in one of their stays after Dean crawled his way out of his own coffin. He overheard words like
“Cas.” Dean soothed. “You haven’t failed me.”
“I’ll take the groceries in, then come and help you.” Castiel told Dean. When the hunter opened his mouth to protest, Cas cut him off. “That wasn’t a question.” He said, then promptly flew from the car into the bunker with groceries in hand. Almost instantaneously, He was back, opening the car door for Dean.
“I believe we should start in the produce section.” Cas suggested. “Sam has requested spinach and some infant tomatoes.”
Dean nodded, knowing he wasn’t able to change the angel’s mind. The smell of the remaining toast was sweet, mixing with the underlying tone of coffee. With Cas beside him, he felt warm for the first time in a long while. “C’mon.” He encouraged, pushing himself up. “Let’s go find a way to kill Chuck.”
“Oh, Sammy.” Dean soothed, squeezing his shoulder firmly. “I’m so sorry.”
The hunter pulled him into a hug. “Well, I don’t want you to.” He scolded. “This world needs you.
him, per say, he’s sad
Castiel felt his breath grow ragged and his eyes grow heavy. He saw how Dean was with Sam- always struggling to maintain the image of the perfect older brother, and never more than a few steps away from whatever self-sacrifice he thought might help Sam. How had the hunter managed to exit purgatory? Dean wasn’t alone in this when Cas was there- and the sudden image of Dean, not Ivan Ilynch, alone at the edge of the abyss of chronic pain, he broke down crying. He tried to remain quiet, but after a few minutes Dean stirred and Castiel tried to hastily control his sobs.
Dean thought of replying with something equally sappy, but what came out was, “
“Mornin’.” He greeted, stepping into the kitchen, only to be greeted by his little brother looking like he’d been strung through a washboard. The sadness in the air was palpable, and Dean shot a panicked look to Cas, striding over to Sam to lay a hand on his shoulder. “What happened?”
“I’m gonna go hop in the shower.” He offered as an explanation.
He considered pulling the gun out from underneath his pillow, but instead, he closed his eyes.
Sam tapped the wheel of the impala restlessly as he drove decidedly too fast down the highway. He’d seen a café a few miles outside town, and he figured if nothing else, soup would be easy to force Dean to eat. He wasn’t going to lose his brother to something as preventable as starvation. He didn’t pay much attention to the man in the trench coat who was walking in the same direction, but glanced in the rearview mirror to check for black eyes nonetheless. Slamming on the brakes, he practically leapt out of the car. “Cas!” he exclaimed.
Cas knows better than to argue with either brother when it comes to matters of the heart, so he silently guides Dean to the chair in Sam’s room. “I fear I need to return to Meg.” He apologizes. “Would you like your cane or crutches?”
“I left you in purgatory.” Cas insisted. “And then I remained for selfish reasons, while forcing you to go.”
“Because God has a plan for you.” Cas says simply.
There are wheelchair tracks crisscrossing Bobby’s carpet and they’re not made by Dean.
“What do you mean?”
Castiel turns to examine the doorway, frowning when he realizes it’s too wide to accommodate a wheelchair.  “I’ll be right back.” He says, returning almost immediately with a bucket of ice water, towels, acetaminophen, and a wheeled walker. He set the items in the basket of the rollator before putting the padded seat down overtop it. “Call me should you need my assistance.”
“I’m sorry.” The angel apologized. “Sam was showing me how to go on the social media.” He bent down and pressed a kiss to Dean’s lips. “Just let me worry about you, okay?”
Castiel stood and walked to sit next to Dean, their shoulders touching. “So, you don’t want to eat solid food because you feel like you don’t deserve it, but you don’t want to drink your calories. Having broth with a spoon- that’s easier?”
Sam cuts him off. “Don’t you dare say
“But I have.” The angel insisted. “I look at you now, Dean, and I see the ghost of you. I’m afraid, so
“Until the Elwetritsch is done.” Dean finished, rolling his eyes a bit. “I’ll eat and then take the first lookout shift.”
“I have you.” Cas reassured, clutching Dean firmly to his chest, keeping him anchored upright. He focused on Dean’s body for a moment, feeling the changes in heat signatures before identifying what was causing Dean the most issues at that moment. “Is this your way of saying I make you weak at the knees?”
“I wish Dad was a better haggler.” He tells Bobby as they sit inside, drinking beer until it hits noon and they can rationalize breaking into the bourbon.
Dean licked his lips. “Of course.” He defended.
“This.” Dean smirked, as he wrapped his now lubed upper thighs around Castiel’s cock.
Castiel sat on one side of Dean, trying to offer what little body heat his vessel produced, and once Benny had the meat cooking, he excused himself to check the perimeter. In the newfound privacy, Castiel brushed his fingers across the stubble that decorated Dean’s jawline. “I’m surprised your knife is still sharp enough to shave with.” He murmured.
“You’re speaking of Purgatory.” Castiel murmured. Of course, the hunter was. That night, running, with cold temperatures, a barren forest, and danger at every angle… he’d felt it too. The kind of familiarity associated not with homesickness, but rather with terror.
Castiel frowned, puzzled. “What would you like me to read? Is there research you need to do?”
“For a corn dog to be a corn dog, does it require a stick?”
The careful way Bobby had rounded the corners of all the furniture of Sam and Dean’s room when they were young was more than enough for Sam to know Bobby was being rhetorical. “It’s getting worse.” Sam replies.
With the list sorted, they made their way to the garage, and Dean slid into Baby’s driver seat with a smile. Fuck, if she wasn’t a surefire way to make the world feel okay. It was cold as shit, and Castiel had fussed over Dean until he’d put on a leather jacket and was currently trying to convince him to wear a hat.
Dean rode him slow and steady, the urgency long gone, and in the minutes that follow, the only thing on Cas’s mind was how lovely it can be to fall apart.
Dean ignored the angel’s ramblings. “I’ll file you.” He mocked.
“I do not belive I smell pleasant.” He stated. “Would you care to join me in the shower?”
Castiel didn’t laugh, his lips pressed into a thin line. “You should rest.” He encouraged. “Let me grab a book, you brush your teeth.”
The vampire licked his lips, his fangs instinctually protruding. “I should find you something to eat first, brother.” But a drop rolled down the flesh of Dean’s wrist, and anytime for planning was over as Benny suckled carefully.
The next morning, Dean brushed off the offer of pancakes a little too quickly and found himself on the receiving end of a patented Singer stare, but the older man let it slide. It wasn’t until the two were headed into town to pick up some salt that Bobby spoke. He’d claimed that Dean should drive and clear his head, and he knew exactly what the marks on the back of Dean’s fingers meant.
“But you said-“Sam stopped when the realization hit him. “Oh.”
Dean blinks and takes it wordlessly. There’s not so much as a grunt of gratitude from him, but Sam’s fine with that. Dean wants to take this in true Winchester fashion and not talk about it, and for once, Sam obliges without a fight.
“And what would that be?”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “I know you did not just offer me whole-wheat.”
Dean shook his head. “No, I think this is the one where Dr. Casanova ends up in cardiac arrest, needs a heart transplant, and his wife shoots herself so he can have her heart.”
Castiel shrugged off his jacket and began to unbutton his shirt slowly. “Well of course.” He teased. “That would be a fruitless endeavor. Angels are un-defile-able.”  He frowned at the poor grammar. “Fileable? The English language is incomprehensible at times, and I’ve witnessed its creation.”
“You have not abandoned me.” Dean insisted. “Not yet anyway.”
“Fuck you!” Dean called. With a grimace, he pushed himself into a standing position and began moving towards the wall, keeping himself upright with a hand on the table. He glanced at his forlorn crutches, eyeing the distance. It was only a few steps, so he walked carefully, feeling his kneecaps wobble as he did. Grabbing them, he made his way into the kitchen, where Castiel was frowning at the shopping list.
“Hmm?” Sam offered in lieu of a reply.
Dean bathed for an hour before he managed to scarf down a protein shake. They researched together into the night, and the next morning awoke to Castiel in coveralls. “What are you doing?” He asked.
Pulling away slowly, Dean felt Castiel’s breath brush against his face softly, before a twig snapping broke the silence. Castiel shot up instantaneously, and Dean was in awe of the former solider of heaven as the angel blade was pulled out of the short sleeves of his scrubs. “Stay down!” Castiel commanded Dean, just as the creature emerged from the dense underbrush. It was dog like, but thin and fanged. It extended scales on its back, and as it rose onto two legs, so did Dean. Dizzy from hunger and blood loss, the edges of his vision were black and as he strode forward to step in front of Castiel and the tunnels of sight collapsed into complete darkness as he fell, boneless into a heap.
“I read that humans are vulnerable to heat loss from their heads.” The angel insisted.
Once his little brother was out of sight, Dean admitted defeat. “Alright.” He sighed. “I need to lay down.” He shifted awkwardly, hoping Cas picked up on his request.
Castiel tugged at Dean’s jaw, capturing his lips softy. “I would use the very last drop of my grace on you and never once consider it a waste.” He murmured as he pulled back. “But I will not do anything against your wishes, so long as you do nothing against mine.”
“He’s right.” Castiel confirmed. “And you certainly did not pass out from dehydration. I suspect you are hypotensive and hypoglycemic and have been for a while. You shouldn’t have stood; you could have kicked yourself into hypovolemic shock. You may not have to fear starving to death here, but your eating disorder not without consequences.”
“Of course.” Castiel replied, bending down to dry Dean’s feet carefully.
“Nice to see you too.” Dean drawled sarcastically. In truth, Bobby has a point, but he was pretty sure he wasn’t hypothermic, so he didn’t see the point of freaking out.
Castiel sighed. “Oh, Dean.” His fingers grazed the skin of Dean’s jutting ribs, tracing the valleys and peaks softly before resting a hand over his heart. His eyes closed, and Dean felt his skin tingle. Castiel stopped suddenly, pulling away softly.
“Easy there, Dean.” Benny reassured. “Just rest for a bit.”
“Hey there, handsome.” Dean offered as a greeting, sitting down on the closed toilet lid. He leaned his crutches against the wall and took off his robe. He raked his eyes over Cas, admiring the view, even though he was far too exhausted for anything even resembling arousal to wash over him.
“Can you help me access the social media?”
He didn’t. “Alright,” Castiel replied. “Shall I fetch you the hot water bottle?”
He wondered where he would be if Castiel hadn’t shown up. If Dean was honest, the only thing worth living for in this moment with Cas. While he wasn’t quite to the point of putting a gun to his mouth or slit his wrists, he also wasn’t ready to eat just for the purpose of dragging out his miserable existence. The blaze of glory he wanted to go out in beckoned him at night, and now he thought the closest thing to glory he could get was to show his control by dying with as little fat as possible.
Dean pulled his shirt down, shivering from the cold. “I’m fine.” He insisted, but he wasn’t even sure he believed it anymore.
Dean pulls himself out of the chair with the help of the walker and prays as he dabs a cool cloth across Sam’s forehead.
And then he thought of Castiel’s shaky voice the night prior.
Dean shivered, pulling the coat tighter around the neck. “It’s fine, Cas. I’ll be okay once we’re topside again.”
And so Dean does.
Dean thought.
“Dean-“ Sam began, but Dean wasn’t having it.
Dean wants to get angry, to yell at the husk of a brother beside him that he’s not sure he could make it to the shitter unaided, much less meander through the sporting goods store they’re at while trying to gauge how many shotgun shells they can buy at once without raising suspicions.  But then the thing turns to look at him, and the eyes are Sammy’s, so he softens. “You have a point.” He replies amicably. “I’ll leave them in the car when we buy groceries.”
“Well, would you look at the time!” He chirped and made his way to the library. Truth be told, he’d lost a substantial amount of weight since his and Cas’s falling out. Hell, he couldn’t remember the last time he ate something solid, subsisting mostly on a disgusting salt/sugar mixture he put in his water and some coffee. It kept him able to hunt, but Dean knew he had to be bordering on underweight once again. His hands shook all the time now, fingertips blanched with hypotension, and he found himself wearing pairs of jeans he hadn’t dug out since the last time his eating disorder was truly bad. He wasn’t truly in the danger zone yet, but the gauntness he’d acquired went far beyond what was normal, even for him.
“More.” Dean begged after a minute. “I need more, Cas.” His arms were behind him, pushing himself into a half-reclined pose with his head thrown back in ecstasy, and Cas paused to kiss the tender flesh of his adam’s apple while adding another slick finger. Dean’s legs were spread, and the arch of his back only highlighted the newfound concavity of his empty stomach.
Castiel felt his resolve weaken. “You promise to tell me if you begin to feel more pain?” He asked, hips bucking into Dean desperately.
Dean sat down at the table. He was
“I dreamt of you dying.” Castiel stated. “Sometimes it was violent deaths, the kind where your body seemed obscured by the sheer volume of blood surrounding it. Sometimes it was of something happening to Sam, followed by you kneeling at the crossroads. But you know what the worst ones were?” His voice wavered slightly, but he pushed on. “The worst ones were of you starving, of digging your grave while I idly watched, unable to help. Of your corpse upon a marble slab, gaunter than I’d ever seen you, even in Purgatory. I dreamt that I begged you to eat and you wouldn’t. I dreamt that you left my alive with the knowledge that I failed you.”
comfortable.”
Dean smirked. “Me? I’d never try to defile an angel.”
“Dean.” Sam croaked; voice hoarse from crying earlier. “Please, please just eat something.”
“Well, it doesn’t have mammary glands as it’s young hatch from eggs, but the Elwetritsch does have nipples and pronounced breast tissue.” Castiel explained. “I can remove them if they bother you, but they contain a significant portion of it’s nutritional value. While difficult to catch, they have been a savored delicacy throughout much of history in southwest Germany.”
hangs in the air, a six-week-old ghost that still haunts them both.
“And with this knowledge, with the physical pain, and with the terror, he had to get into bed and often be unable to sleep from the pain the greater part of the night.” The angel read with a lump begging to form in his throat.  “And the next morning he had to get up again, dress, go to court, talk, write, or if he didn’t go to court he had to stay at home with those twenty-four hours of the day, each one which was torment.” His fingers stilled in Dean's hair.  “And he had to live like that on the brink of the abyss, all alone, without a single person who could understand and take pity on him.”
Acquiring the bunker is somehow simultaneously one of the best and worst things that happen to Dean. On one hand, there’s the escape from the cramped impala, a gorgeous memory foam mattress that cradles his aching body, and a consistent supply of hot water to cascade from a rain head shower.
“Let’s get you sitting.” Cas susurrated, slowly helping the hunter ease down onto the cold porcelain of the tub. Cas stepped out, grabbing the shampoo and working a lather into Dean’s wet hair. “Do you want a shave?” He offered. The hunter was only mildly stubbled, but he knew Dean sometimes preferred to be completely clean shaven.
Castiel kneeled next to the hunter. “Dean?” He asked softly, putting a hand softly on the man’s shoulder. “You’ve gone pale, are you feeling alright?”
“Your wish is my command.”
“I don’t deserve it.” He responded immediately.
“I’m okay, Cas.” He reassured. “Purgatory isn’t meant for me. I don’t think I can die a human death here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was asleep before he even got to the funeral scene, but Castiel continued to read. The hunter often suffered nightmares, but they seemed to vanish when he was around, as if it was a side effect of grace, or even of love. He read quietly, but with great enjoyment as he gave the different characters each unique accents, all with thick Russian overtones. It was another one he’d effectively memorized, but he possessed the knowledge as a sort of photograph, so it was far from a mindless recitation. He continued reading about the slow descent into the arms of death, but a particular section made him pause as he looked at Dean’s sleeping form.
Nodding, Castiel stood quickly walking to help Dean stand as well. Dean moved to shrug him off, but Castiel ignored him, wrapping an arm around the hunter’s waist. “Please.” Castiel asked. “Please just allow me to feel like I’m helping.”
Sam sighed. “Dean-“
Dean pointed his finger. “It was a
“So have I.” Dean pointed out. “And that doesn’t stop you from worrying about me.”
Dean licked his lips tentatively. “I don’t know.” He replied truthfully. “I just- I don’t want to feel full. I don’t want to stuff myself. Hell, the main reason I haven’t had anything solid in a while is because I haven’t felt like I’ve deserved the luxury of chewing.”
They find Cas by the river, and after convincing him to join the group, the three camp together, and Dean falls in love with the Angell all over again. He loves Benny, too, but they quit having sex and focus on getting out of there. At the end of their first day as a triad, Benny puts on some water to boil near the cliffside and places a simple trap on the other side to slow down anything that is attracted to the fire. Castiel carefully produced a bundle of white sage from his coat, explaining that he’d gathered it the previous day, lest he come across a fae.
“It’s figure of speech.” Sam supplied.
The first things he feels is blinding pain. He’s unable to even calculate what he’s injured at first, woozy from the sheer agony.
“A beer?” Dean asked hopefully. He knew Cas wouldn’t bring him whiskey this early- the angel was always concerned about his alcohol consumption- but maybe with a beer he could get some sleep.
“I want a cottage, not a cabin. In a meadow, for the bees.”
“Got a buddy up near Whitehorse working a case.” Bobby responded. “No EMF, smell of Sulphur, and it’s impossible to notice any cold spots since he’s well into Yukon. When he turns on the tap, the water is cloudy, but only in the kitchen, not the bathroom. What’s he hunting?”
Dean scrunched his nose. “Ew, no.” He had vague memories of Castiel chattering away about the beauty of arsenic green wallpaper.
When he pulls it out, he blinks in surprise.
“I’m sorry for snapping.” Dean relented before sinking back into a reclined position against the cave wall, feeling unexpectedly weary.
Dean was suddenly back at the kitchen table, his hands wrapped around his forgotten mug of coffee. “Just broth?” He questioned.
The second Sam sees the damage the broken mirror did to his brother, the gouges painting him red, he knows better.
Castiel noticed the pause. “Would you like me to undress you?”
After, when they were breathless and sticky, clinging to each other atop the sheets, Cas slowly traced his fingers over the ridges and valleys of Dean’s spine.  “How much?” He asked.
dancing across the screen. “I’m going out to buy some shit for dinner, and if you don’t eat it, I’ll syringe that smoothie down your throat.”
It’s been fine, so far. Dean has an endless number of white lies to delay hunts and errands with when the steps seem to be Mt. Everest instead of an architectural feature, and Sam, Kevin, and Cas know better than to prod when he uses one. Now, though, as he drives his semi-conscious brother back from delivering Bobby’s soul to heaven, a lump of dread fills his stomach. Sam is lying in the backseat, either passed out or damn close to it, so when he gets off the exit for Lawrence, he prays.
It was slow, Cas being sure to chew until all lumps were gone for fear of Dean choking, but soon they were down to just the crusts of one half of the slice. Dean shook his head, signaling he was done, and Castiel swallowed the final bite. “I’m proud of you.”
Dean swallowed, too overwhelmed in the sensation of Cas’s lips against his to think about the calories. The sugar was sweet, and the cinnamon reminded him of apple pie. “What am I, a baby penguin?” He asked, but there was no anger in his voice.
, just left in a motel room with the impala and the empty promise of a weekly phone call. The room’s been paid for two days in advance, and Dean half-slumbers through most of it, in too much pain to truly sleep, but too drowsy to do much else. The TV’s been on the same station for 36 hours straight before he gets up to peer through his wallet and see if he can afford another night in this shithole.
“I know that in reality, we were only there for a year.” Dean agreed. “And yet it feels like I spent a lifetime there.”
“Cut the shit, Cas.” Dean barked. “You know exactly what I’m talking about. Is this hunting, being around Sam and I 24/7 life simply your way of trying to lessen my grief before you off yourself?” His voice cracked. “I won’t lose you Cas. I can’t lose you.”
Later, Dean talks of the angel he met skeptically. For Sam, this is just the piece of hope he needed. Later that night, Dean dreams of hell and wakes up thrashing and screaming. As Sam reduces his brother’s dislocated should with nary a comment, he understands Deans hesitation to trust Castiel.
Castiel’s hand stilled. “Have you had solid food at all this month?”
“I just don’t get why he always has to be the unlucky one.” Sam says, quietly. At least if he were the broken half, he could quietly retire from hunting and go to the cardiologists and physiotherapists his brother would never even consider. If it were him who had the messed-up genes, his brother could be hunting nonstop.
Castiel had oft wondered what inspired Coleridge to write of an albatross as if it was a beauty beyond compare. But as he stared at Dean and looked past the figure and into that bright spot in his soul, Cas understood. He’d seen galaxies created, and galaxies destroyed. He’d witnessed the birth and death of entire species with mild interest and explored the great barrier reef as it was formed. He’d gazed at archangels in their true form and sang when Christ was born. Now, though, looking at Dean, those experiences paled in comparison to the beauty before him.
The going’s slow, and halfway through Dean thinks it might have just been quicker if Bobby had carried him, but soon they’re inside and Bobby is kicking the spluttering radiator, trying to coax a bit more heat out of it. Dean’s leaning ramrod straight against the headboard of one of the beds, feeling a bit like a tight-laced Victorian governess.
Dean snorted. “I’ll stick to coffee, thanks.”
“Just this once.” Castiel replied, as if this didn’t happen at least four times a week.
Dean sighed at the contact, his subspace slipping into his mind slowly, like waves caressing the shore. “I like it when you pet my hair.” He susurrated.
Castiel nodded and let himself be flipped over, Dean carefully beginning to lower himself onto Cas’s cock. The angel gripped Dean’s upper arms fervently, helping the hunter ease down tantalizingly slow. “Careful.” He warned. “If you can’t walk tomorrow Sam will be insufferable.”
“Are you saying that thing was an alien?” Dean groaned.
“I’m okay.” Dean reassured. He rubbed his head, tension building behind his eyes. “Just feeling a little under the weather.”
Castiel stalled. What did he feel like reading? What would occupy his mind right now, but more importantly, occupy his soul, and feel something so fervent in nature it was akin to the emotions he saw displayed on humans? He sat up, as if he were somehow better able to collect the thoughts in his head when upright. Dean’s head was resting against his thigh now, soft puffs of air warming him in time with Dean’s breathing. Dean’s eyes were soft with exhaustion, his joints ablaze with fire agony so prevalent Cas didn’t even have to examine his lover’s aura: it was a dark scratch across his very soul. He gazed at the dark spot for a moment and knew what he wanted to read. What he wanted to try and understand now, not objectively as one learns of the position of the planets in the galaxy, but rather subjectively as one learns about heartbreak.
They play the game for a bit, Dean pretending not to realize it’s just a method of keeping him awake. There’s a knock at the door, and Bobby accepts the bag of uncooked rice. Pouring it into clean socks, the elder hunter heats the bundles in the microwave before placing them under the blanket with Dean. After an hour or so of the one-sided questioning, Bobby seemed satisfied that Dean wasn’t in the danger zone anymore.
After exiting purgatory for a second time, Dean felt the dynamic between him and Cas shift. They’re back on speaking terms, and Dean was frantic to get clean and get to the inevitable make-up sex. With the leviathan blossom gathered and Cas and him safely in the bunker, Dean excused himself for a shower. After he was done, he didn’t bother to dress, merely slapping his robe and slippers before plodding to the kitchen for a mug of black coffee. Sam was at the kitchen table, laptop open and drinking something thick and green, which Dean scrunched his nose at.
Sam frowned, puzzled. “yeah, what’s up?”
Dean’s outside, rebuilding the Impala and pretending he’s using the ice in the cooler next to him to keep his beer cold and not to plunge his swollen fingers into periodically when the pain gets to be too much.
“It’s awful.” Castiel replied, smiling a bit when Dean laughed.
Dean cackled at that memory. Then, after a pause, “Would you prefer
Dean barely made it to the kitchen sink in time to throw up a mouthful of bile.
Silence overtook the kitchen until Cas went to pour the chicken stock into a mug. “I want it in a bowl.” Dean protested. It’d been how he’d eaten most of his liquid meals, from the unsweetened almond milk his brother bought to the semi-revolting mixture of soy sauce and tabasco he diluted in water and affectionately called wonton soup despite never actually christening it with wontons. Something about it reminded him of rainy days with Dad and Sammy in crappy motel rooms, eating Chinese takeout like it was the nectar of the gods. He hadn’t touched the bullion in the fridge often, afraid the protein would make him feel too full, erasing the gnawing in his stomach he’d come to love.
“As you wish.” Castiel replied. He turned the water as hot as it would go, frowning when it managed only a meager 40 degrees Celsius. It was cooler than Dean preferred, but it would have to do. He did in all honesty feel weak, and heating water would be a waste of his grace. He stripped quickly, folding his bloodied clothes neatly on the countertop. He pulled back the shower curtain but stopped as he heard a muttered curse. “Dean?” He asked quickly, stepping out to the man, who was grasping the motel dresser as if it was the only thing holding him up.
“When I was suicidal.” He spoke, voice low. “After the decimation I caused in heaven, you sat with me and listened, because you are a kind, caring person.” He looked Dean in the eyes. “But you also spoke with me because you were scared, just as I am now, of being left alone on this wretched earth without your other half.”
It’s a few days after Jess’ death and Sam needs a shower. Hell, he needs a shower
“Earth to Cas.” Dean’s voice freed Castiel from his reverie. They were in front of the grocery store, with Baby idling and Dean looking at him worriedly. “You okay?”
“I called Garth and let him know we took out that nest, by the way.” Sam offered as conversation. “They were so obvious with the murders I figured other hunters were probably working the case, so I figured he could call off the hounds.”
It’s a folding cane.
There’s a faint crackling sensation across Dean’s skin, not painful or even uncomfortable, just a tingle akin to touching the static on a television screen. Castiel’s hand glows and the bruises are healed. “My apologies.” The angel murmurs. “I did not mean to cause you any unneeded pain.”
“During an interval in the Melvinski trial in the large building of the Law Courts the members and public prosecutor met in Ivan Egorovich Shebek's private room, where the conversation turned on the celebrated Krasovski case.”
Castiel doesn’t. Instead, he picks a book from the stack on the table and begins to read.
“I’m not the one who just went through hell, heaven,
“Eileen left.” Sam replied, staring into his cup of coffee as if he wanted to crawl inside it. “Said she didn’t know what was real anymore.”
It felt good to have no secrets between the three of them, and true to form, Sam was ecstatic to see his brother so happy.
After drying Dean off and coating his joints in arnica oil, the Winchester insisted on getting dressed, despite Castiel’s nod-so- subtle attempts on convincing him to stay in his robe. Not wanting to make Dean feel like an invalid, Castiel sat back while Dean dressed carefully, eyeing the human’s movements to further assess his pain levels. “Would you like me to make you breakfast so you can take something for the pain?” Cas asked as Dean tried to disguise a grimace while pulling on his AC/DC shirt. “I think there’s still some of that bread Sam bought at the farmers market.”
Benny stops to scan the area. “Cave in another two miles.” He drawls. “I’ll find you something to eat when we get there, maybe you just need something more than dandelions.”
He wished he would stop shaking, though.
“He needs something easy to digest.” Castiel instructed. “Protein, for his muscles. Do you have eggs?”
Dean laughed, and Castiel looked hurt. “I’m not laughing at you, I swear.” Dean promised. “I’m laughing at myself because I never thought I’d be leaning on an angel of the lord, about to bond over daddy issues with him.”
“Oh, Cas.” Dean murmured, pushing himself upright to wrap his arms around the angel. “You’re okay, you’re okay.”
The two kept speaking, but their voiced were drowned by the sound of Dean activating his gag reflex. It was so human, so grounding. A cup of tea wasn’t much to vomit, and as he finished dry heaving, his vision began to blur around the edges, but the figures didn’t. He saw a set of blue eyes looking at him and felt rough hands clasp around his own. “You’re real.” He murmured.
Dean laughed at this. “Unfortunately for you, that seems to be my main goal in life.”
It wasn’t Dad who figured it out, of course not. He checked in on the phone every now and then, calls getting farther apart each month. It seemed as though without Sammy, they had no glue to hold them together, and the empty spaces near Dean grew larger. It was Bobby who put the pieces together, after Dean showed up at his doorstep with two broken ribs and a hastily sewn up gash on his forehead.
“We should have done this ages ago.” Castiel agreed as he shifted, trying to not let Dean feel his hardening cock against his thigh. The hunter was in no fit state to fuck, and Cas tried to will his vessel into submission.
Castiel places his mug down gently. “DNA is a difficult thing.” He responds carefully. “A little bit of grace in the wrong place can cause a person to mutate into something more closely resembling a snail than a human. I was born to fight. Someone like Raphael, an angel born to heal, might be able to carefully remove the abnormalities causing your brothers defective collagen but even then, it would be risky.”
“Give him your coat.” Benny suggested. “He gets cold real easy afterwards.” The vampire stalked off into the brush, searching for something marginally edible, and Castiel wrapped his trench coat around Dean’s shoulders carefully.
“I wasn’t going to answer for Dean-the-jackass.” Castiel sneered, turning off the water with far more force than necessary. The lights flickered for a moment, but they shone brightly once more when Castiel’s hands unfurled from their fists.
Dean had been idlily watching the room spin when he heard the door open.
“Dean.” Castiel said firmly. “He survived a long while without you. He will not perish if he does not have access to human blood.”
Bathing hadn’t been on Dean’s priority list since he was on earth. He knew he’d lost weight, having had to punch a few holes in his belt, but he hadn’t looked at his body in months, always yearning for protection against the cold. “Shit.” He murmured, looking down at his protruding ribcage.
at least live for me.”
Cas smiled, kissing the tip of Dean’s nose carefully. “As you wish.”
a shave, he decides. Dean is out hustling pool, trying to scrounge up enough money to keep them in motel rooms and out of the impala; they’re both too old and too tall to comfortably sleep while parked at a rest stop anymore. His apartment had burned down with his razor still in it, so he digs through Dean’s duffle bag to
“You’ve gotten awful thin, boy.” He said, letting the sentence hang for a minute.
Dean nodded, downing the drink in one swig so he could close his eyes.
it was akin to the nickname

“We know that.” Cas soothed. “
“Family don’t end in blood.” Dean quoted. “That doesn’t just apply to humans, you know.” He looked at the angel carefully. “He couldn’t fix my problem, no one can. My joints are destined to be shitty as ever. But he supported me and gave me the cane so I could feel his support even when he wasn’t there.”
“Hey Cas.” He says softly. “I know you’re busy, but I’ll be needing a hand in a minute.” He glances at the pale face of his brother in the rearview mirror. “Don’t know if I’ll be able to carry sasquatch by myself.” He admits.
Bobby’s eyes flickered with concerned. “Any numbness?”
The rest of the drive is silent, aside from Sam’s soft snores from the backseat. When they arrive, Dean opens the impala’s back doors, intending to rouse his brother, but Castiel scoops the sleeping form of Sam up and put him in a fireman’s carry. “I will put him to bed.” Cas insists, walking towards the bunker’s entrance. “Wait here.”
Purgatory was never meant to house humans. This became increasingly obvious to Dean during his third night trapped there, when as he pressed a hand against one of the walls of the cavern he sought refuge in and shoved a hand down his throat. His knuckles brushed against the familiar spot behind his tongue, but nothing happened to the weight pressing low in his stomach, or the buzz of panic swarming his head. Suddenly, he felt like he was back down in hell, the only other place he hasn’t had this creature comfort to fill whatever empty space he was carrying at that moment. Dean tried again, more forcefully, adding a third finger, and violently twisting them in his throat, clawing until he tasted blood.
Dean turned his head to face the angle, tugging gently on Cas’ beard. “You should try it sometime.” He chastised softly.
“Day after day, day after day, / We stuck, nor breath nor motion; / As idle as a painted ship/Upon a painted ocean.” Castiel agreed. “Angels are not supposed to grow weary from the passage of time. But that place… That place exhausted me, Dean.”
Sam nodded, his bare feet hardly making any noise as he padded out of the room. “Fuck, he can’t even stand to look at me.” Dean muttered, sipping his coffee idly, trying to block out the continuous screaming of his brain of
“I’m okay, Cas.” Dean reassured; the corners of his mouth turned upwards ever so slightly. When the angel’s hands begin to tug his shirt hem up, he spoke again. “What are you doing?”
Castiel read as he thought about it. “I don’t understand the question.” He replied.
Frowning, Cas detached the showerhead and rinsed Dean’s hair and body thoroughly before shutting the water off. “There.” He announced. “All clean.” Standing, he laid a towel atop the closed toilet and made a mental note to get a small chair for the bathroom next time he had the chance. Something wood, perhaps, he mused. He picked up Dean carefully after informing him of his intention and placed him on the towel before grabbing a second one to dry Dean off with, using his grace to warm it slightly.
Dean stood, making his way from the library to the Dean cave, where Cas had holed up with a stack of ancient tomes, claiming the clacking of keyboards was keeping him from fully immersing himself in the texts. “Hey.” He greeted, opening the door.
“I am a soldier above all else.” Castiel says wearily. “And grace is not an infinite resource. Generally speaking, in terms of miracles though, healing is one of the easier arts.” He sips his coffee, tasting the rain that fell on the forty-third day of the bean’s growing. “That’s why there are so many biblical tales of the reversal of illness and only one of being turned to salt.”
Fifteen minutes later, Sam and Cas stood outside the motel room, grim looks on their faces as they tried to figure out how to kill the monster in Dean’s mind. “What are we going to do?” Sam asked.
“Hey!” Dean protested, as if they hadn’t had this argument countless times. “Don’t insult her, she’s a veteran!” He stroked the army surplus blanket lovingly.
“We’ll be inside quickly.” Dean reassured.
Castiel’s voice was stern. “That is an understatement, Dean. How can you be so foolish? To resort back to this in a place where you’re one wrong move away from being beheaded at all times?”
Something in the words spurred on Cas’s orgasm, and he came harsh, with a few last thrusts. “I love you too.” He purred, eyes fluttering open before pressing a sloppy, open-mouthed kiss to Dean’s lips.
Castiel nodded, and Dean finished his coffee. “More coffee?” The angel offered.
Sam gave a weak smile. “Can’t say I blame her. Getting kidnapped by God is enough to fuck with anyone’s mind.”
Dean is already tucking the blanket tighter around his brother’s body. “Neither.” He insists. “Sammy will probably get feverish soon, I’ll need my hands free to get ice.
“I guess?” Dean replied, taking another spoonful. He could smell the sugar and cinnamon Cas topped his toast with, and his stomach growled again. Fuck, he was just so hungry.
“Dean.”
Dean nodded, going to the coffee maker and pouring himself a mug. His stomach grumbled in anticipation, and Cas frowned. “Do you want any creamer?”
Dean took Cas in hand, and the door had scarcely slammed behind them when he began to tear off the angel’s superfluous layers. Starting with the trench coat, he ripped off the suit jacket and Castiel’s tie before beginning to unbutton his shirt. “You wear too many layers.” He groaned, already half hard and pausing to rub himself against Cas, desperate for friction.
He made it there, but he’s exhausted. There’s no plug for the bathtub, but he sat down anyway, turning the water on as hot as it can go. Once his skin is wrinkled and the water is threatening to go cold, Dean hauled himself to his feet and carefully swipes his hair back before sitting on the closed toilet to dress himself in a clean T-shirt and the tightest pair of jeans he owns. Tossing on his Dad’s old leather jacket, he braced himself for the jolt of cold to come when he opens the door.
Dean stopped to think. The toast was in his stomach, feeling a bit like a ball, but he didn’t hate himself for it. He could probably eat half a slice and still retain the addicting sensation of emptiness. “Okay.” He agreed. “A few more bites.”
“Is that what you’re doing now?”
“So tight.” The angel groaned. “You’re going to feel so good around my cock, baby.” He began to methodically pump his index finger in and out of Dean’s hole, watching the man as pleasure danced across his face.
Sam snorted softly into his mug. This was going to be fun.
“We’re high enough up that very few things will bother us here.” Benny insisted. “This is as safe as we can get in this place, brother. Let’s enjoy it for a day or two and let us all get our strengths up.”
Cas placed him on the bed gently. “If we are to cuddle.” He spoke. “I am going to go get my blanket. I have no clue how you find this wool….
It’s only a few seconds before he hears the rustling of wings and Castiel is sitting next to him. The angel glances at Sam with concern. “How is he?” He asks quietly.
Dean nodded. “You know I want the same for you, right?”
“Of course, I always watch over Dean.” Castiel murmured softly.
.” He murmured.
“I love you too.” Dean smiled, pressing a chaste kiss to the angel’s lips.
They’re at Bobby’s and their dad is dead and Sam still can’t help but
Benny cut him off. “It’s alright, brother. The sex we had… that was for taking solace in. No more, no less. You’ve found the one person who makes the world feel less shitty to you. Just do me a favor and don’t squander it.”
Castiel smiled. “Thank you, Dean.” He looked at the oncoming road. “Not just for that, but for…” He paused searching for words. “For allowing me to feel needed.”
Dean was warm when he woke up. He smiled a bit, as it meant he had woken up before Sammy, his fingers grasped the motel blanket, his body sinking deeper into the mattress that smelled of pine and--
Cas spun around and let a small smile anoint his face. “Not in the slightest. Shall we retire to your bedroom?”
Dean awoke to a cold bed and even colder hands. He wrapped the blanket tightly around his shoulders, sitting up slowly in an unsuccessful effort to avoid a headrush. He glanced about the room, looking for proof he hadn’t merely dreamed yesterday’s activities, and relaxed when he saw
Dean relaxed against the angel’s chest, feeling a wave of comfort and warmth flow over him as Cas enveloped him in his wings. “You are the best.” He smiled. The cold had hurt like a son of a bitch- seriously, why hadn’t he had the sense to don long underwear?
“Sit down, Cas, you look tired.” Dean expressed, watching how the shadows pooled on his companion’s face. When the angel sat rather than argue, the hunter felt a chill of worry run down his spine. “Shit.” He realized. “You are tired, aren’t you?”
Dean could practically hear Sam roll his eyes, but the chair squeaked, and his ginormous brother came over to the table. “I’m giving Cas the list this time.”
Castiel’s hand was warm on the back of his neck, and his knees quaked as he gripped the metal basin, dry heaving and agony filling the space where his thoughts should be. “Sorry.” He grunted, not quite sure what exactly he was apologizing for.
“Garth has hounds?” Castiel questioned.
Castiel closed his eyes as he remembered the carnage in heaven. “I think of it all the time.” He responded. Opening his eyes, he saw Dean look at him solemnly, and Castiel wondered if the hunter saw past the body he himself wore, too. “I oftentimes think I left there before my penance was over.” He continued. His hands were shaking slightly, causing a faint rattle against the wood of the table. “I think I should still be there. That I deserve to still be there.” If he had breath, it surely would have caught in his throat as he turned to gaze into the abyss of the darkened kitchen.
“What makes you say that?” Bobby asks, as if he hasn’t the faintest idea.
Dean nodded, taking a long sip of his coffee. “Yeah. I think we’ll be okay.”
“I thought you were dead.” Dean whispered. The blackness was still filling his vision, and he felt himself slumping down, but the angel wrapped his arms around him. A deep warmth suddenly filled him, and he smiled, realizing the angel had wrapped his wings around him.
And if the last thing Sam thinks as he jumps into the pit is how glad he is Dean finally gets a shot at normalcy, well, no one is none the wiser.
“Don’t teleport me anywhere.”  Dean instructed. “I swear man, whatever you do, don’t waste your mojo on me.”
, and he knows for a fact he’s the only one staying at the hotel because who the fuck comes to Minnesota in December?
“Put some clothes on before you scar the kid, Cas.” Dean quipped from the bed. His hair was wet, and his cheeks, while sunken, had a tinge of pink to them.
Castiel inhaled sharply as Dean shifted, an act of sheer indulgence rather than any necessity. “You are so beautiful.”  He sighed. “I will never tire of seeing your soul dance with joy.” His hands drifted down Dean’s arms to settle on the hunter’s hips, squeezing gently, worried too firm a grasp would hurt the sharp points of Dean’s pelvis. Cas pushed himself up against the headboard, allowing for them both to be upright, and kissed Dean softly, unable to resist the urge to buck his hips upwards in glee.
Dean laughed. “You are such a pushover.”
“Alright, gimme your coordinates.”
Dean grit his teeth as the memory washed over him.
“Well,” Castiel teased, “I agreed to a cabin, but you never said I couldn’t paint the living room neon green.”
Dean shook his head. “I want it to burn.” Castiel must have looked ready to protest, because Dean cut him off, saying, “I
“So,” he tells his brother. “this is how we’re going to keep you as healthy as possible. I don’t want you just to survive when I’m gone. I want you to live.”
“Vampires all began as humans.” Cas explained. “As such, they have a very human feeding pattern. While they cannot die of starvation, even a few days without blood will leave them ravenous. You, however, can die of starvation, especially with the number of calories you’ve been burning daily. I need to see exactly how emaciated you are, and I cannot effectively do that with your clothes on.” Yanking the final layer of shirts up to the hunter’s chest, he gave a dissatisfied growl. “Dammit Dean.”
Bobby snorted, pulling Dean’s shoulders carefully forward so he can put the ice behind his spine. “I’m thinking we skip the naproxen and go straight for the Vicodin.” He suggested. “I got some flexeril kicking around my bag somewhere, too.”
Castiel sat down near the fire, in between Benny and Dean, so he was facing the entrance. As he began carefully plucking black feathers from the creature he held, he replied. “Technically, no. It was born on earth, but it did however descend from it’s ancestors who landed near the El Yunca rainforest in the 1970’s and-“
The sound of a throat clearing broke them out of their reverie. “Can we keep the make-out sessions to your room, please?” Sam requested. Dean had broken down and told Sam of their relationship after Purgatory, when he thought he would never see the angel again, and Sam’s reply was
“Without you?” Bobby asked.
Dean nodded against Cas’ leg. “I’d like that.”
Dean closed his eyes to prevent tears from falling, trying to ignore the sound of the door closing.
As his eyes readjusted, Dean realized he was in a cave, where a fire could burn without attracting any monsters. He was on a pile of pine branches, with both Cas’ and Benny’s coats draped over him. “How long was I out?” he questioned blearily.
Cas shook his head. “That’s not what I asked.” He took a purposeful bite and chewed thoughtfully, then paused. Cas brought a hand up to caress the back of Dean’s head and pulled him forward, meshing their lips together. Using his tongue, he gently pushed the toast into Dean’s mouth before pulling back to observe the hunter’s reaction.
Castiel strode over to the man. “I mean it, Dean.” He insists, pressing a gentle kiss to the hunter’s lips. Pulling back, the sounds of wings moving fills the air and the angel is gone once again.
“I'm okay, Bobby.” Dean defended.
“You knew.” Dean spoke. “You knew the whole time that you weren’t going to come through that gate with me.” His voice was quiet, filled with the staccato rage of a cat about to pounce. “That’s why you were so…” He trailed off.
“I’m glad Bobby came when you called.” Castiel murmured.
The vamp gives him a side-eye. He knows it’s a lie, but it seems like the closest thing to an explanation he’s going to get. “I’ll find you a branch to lean on.”
Dean furrowed his brow. “That thing didn’t look like any Chupacabra I’ve ever seen.”
Dean nodded. It was as good of an answer as any. How or why Cas was here didn’t matter to him in this moment, all that matter was that Cas was here. He let himself be as resistant as a marionette doll for the time being, complacently sitting as Cas began to undress him. It was odd, to be with Cas, this intimate without any plans of sex.
“It doesn’t mean I can’t worry about you.” Castiel replies.
“You dehydrated yourself vomiting.” Castiel murmured. “Let’s get a quick shower, and then get you rehydrated.” He reached out to touch the man’s bony shoulder, stopping when Dean tensed.
The deep voice sent shivers down his spine, and he swore he could hear two sets of footsteps walking towards him. “Hey, c’mon Dean.” Sam’s voice said this time, instead of Castiel’s.
The eldest son exhaled shakily. Of course, Bobby was able to tell something was off. “You don’t happen to have any favors to cash in near Bemidji or Fargo, do you?”
“I have a problem with this plan.” Castiel replied, and Dean’s heart sank.
Dean’s stomach clenched at the thought. “Nah.” He dismissed. “Maybe later.”
“I mean it, Cas.” Dean insisted. “I will do whatever might help you, whether it’s going for a drive, or fishing, or just staying up to listen to you quote Coleridge.”
Cas sits next to him, and Dean pretends not to envy the way his knees don’t quake.  The angel reaches out to touch him, but he pushes his hand away. “Don’t waste your mojo.” He instructs. “I’m fine, just needed to sit for a moment.”
“Do you need more painkillers?” Sam asked.
“Dean.” The older man insisted. “What’s going on? Can you put your Dad on the phone?”
Dean feels tears forming unexpectedly. “You say that like my normal pain is needed.”
Castiel opened his trench coat and pulled out a bottle of naproxen. He tried to keep them on hand at all times, should the hunter need them. “Take these, first. Shall I go check our stock of perishables?”
I want to make it very clear that, despite the ending, I do know that love is not some kind of emotional panacea. That being said, I hope I've presented this in such a way to show the hypothesis that love, whether romantic, platonic, or familial, can act as a mirror, and oft when you fall in love with someone you wind up falling in love with yourself along the road.  The Winchesters- Castiel included- are often portrayed as people who live only to serve others, with little regard for themselves, so despite this absolutely not being how you should go about things if you or a loved one is feeling suicidal, I did feel as though it worked for the story. Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this crack-angst-fluff-porn conglomerate, and I sincerely hope you find the time to read some Tolstoy that isn't
Castiel nodded. “What else should I add?” He asked, pointing to where his small letters listed
Castiel sighed, standing from he had knelt to draw the bath. “You make it sound as if I’m attached to your eating disorder, not you.”
Dean shakes his head. “I need to go sit by Sam.”
Castiel exhaled, more out of habit than of any excess air. “Is this what love is?” He asked. “To look at another and wish more than anything, that you could bear their burdens for them?”
Castiel frowned at his exposed dick. “I wasn’t in a vessel on my birthday.” But he put on Dean’s robe, nonetheless.
“Wakey wakey.” Bobby said what felt like a moment later.
“Dean.” Castiel spoke through clenched teeth after a few minutes. “My Dean, I’m gonna-“ He rutted desperately a few more times.
The vampire held a small jackalope up by the neck. “Mind if I borrow your knife to clean it?” He asked Dean. When the hunter began to protest, he cut him off. “You’ve got to be pretty weak, brother. Just let wings and I take care of you for a bit.”
“It was a Puerto Rican Chupacabra.” Castiel’s deep voice came from the darkness. The only light was the fire, as they were too far from the entrance to soak up any of the moon’s meager rays. “They are far less terrestrial than the Chupacabra that populate the areas near the Rio Grande.”
Castiel tilted his head. “Any reason why?”
“I don’t want to leave you alone.” He sobbed. “Why did I leave you alone?”
“Exactly what I said.” The hunter retorted. “You haven’t abandoned me, Cas, not really. But if you…” Dean inhaled sharply, preparing his mouth for the bitter words about to come out. “But if you kill yourself, you will have.”
Hanging up, he felt a tear run down his cheek as his hands begin to quake. Knowing it would be a few days before his Dad bothers calling him back, he resolves to call the only person he knows who always picks up on the first few rings.
Dean frowned as if he had no idea what Sam was talking about. “What? I’m a great shopper.”
Castiel grasped Dean tighter, lifting him up a bit to reduce whatever strain on his joint he might be causing. “Ol hoath.” He moaned in Enochian.
Dean stilled, and Castiel paused, taking the moment to squeeze Dean’s waist a little tighter. “He never replied.” The angel confessed. “I screamed, I cried. I prayed in Enochian, in Hebrew, in languages that have been dead since long before Noah built the ark, and he never replied.” Castiel murmured. “In my hour of need, my father did not come to answer. I fear that my repulsive actions when the leviathan were in me may be the closest thing this earth will ever get to having God walk the earth. I fear the closest I will ever feel to my father is what I felt when I housed his rejections.”
He clenches his hip muscle to try and figure out what’s wrong and yep, that’s definitely a vertebra out. Dean’s stupid and will brush off a lot of things, but anything that could potentially screw with his spinal cord he tries not to fuck with. Looking sadly at the ice below his ass, he sighs. The injury is low- L1 or L2, and Dean can still wiggle his toes so no real harm was done in the fall, but he knows falling again with a joint already subluxated could leave him paralyzed.
That morning, instead of counting calories, Dean drank his coffee and counted brushstrokes.
“I forgot how good his hearing is.” Sam muttered.
He’s back in less than five minutes with a ziploc bag of ice and a cola. “I’d prefer the other type of coke right now.” Dean joked.
“I love you so much.” Castiel murmured. “You complete me, Dean Winchester.”
worked) His hands clicked on his contacts list. It was short, and most of the names were descriptions of other hunters like
“Yes.” Cas replied. “I gave him some hydrocodone about six hours ago, so I estimate he’ll sleep for at least another two hours.”
Returning with a battered 1868 edition of
Cas set down the bowl in front of Dean, breaking him from his reverie. “Here.” He placed a small spoon next to it, a long-handled one the men of letters must have used for iced tea. Something about the daintiness of it made the soup feel less intimidating, like the size of the spoon was a measure of his greed, and Dean smiled a silent thanks.
“Do you think of it often?” Dean asked, fracturing the angel’s reverie.
Castiel felt himself continually sob, and Dean held him the entire time. After a few moments, Castiel regained his composure. “Apologies.” He muttered. “I did not mean to get you wet.”
“I love you.” Castiel said again. “I love you.” He repeated like a prayer. He cracked a smile. It was now, viewing his favorite of his father’s creation, that he felt seen. God may not have answered Cas’s prayers in purgatory, But as Castiel read the next passage, he remembered that God had sent Dean to him, and perhaps that was far better.
“Benny needs to eat.” Dean responded, and promptly ran the blade against his scarred wrist.
“I’ll be okay, Cas.” Dean reassured. “Put if roleplaying Florence Nightingale helps you, I will happily submit to you. I love you.” He replied, a cheeky grin crossing his face.
Dean makes it three days with Benny before his knees start to buckle every half mile.
Bobby looked concerned. “The night manager went to get me some uncooked rice.” He said simply. “Got any clean socks?”
Castiel rejoined the kiss, but it was softer now. He removed his belt and let Dean help him out of his trousers and boxers before pushing the hunter back onto the bed. “So beautiful.” Castiel admired, opening the bedside drawer and grabbing lube. He slicked a finger and pressed it into Dean carefully, watching as the man keened in response.
“Just shut the fuck up.” Dean snapped. “Both of you. I’m not some problem you can just fix whenever.”
“I’ve missed you so fucking much.” Dean purred. “My bed felt so cold without you.”
Dean gazed into his eyes before breaking the tension. “You’re such a sap.”
Dean has gone to bed after drinking himself into a stupor, and Bobby sits in the corner, searching for a way to power up Castiel. The angel himself is idly drinking a cup of black coffee, murmuring about what the molecules tell him about weather patterns in Sumatra. “Why is healing so difficult for angels?” Sam finally asks, slamming down another useless book. He might not be drunk yet, but he’s slowly approaching tipsy and the liquor burns like courage in his veins. “Shouldn’t that be like, your default?”
Dean walked up behind Cas and peered at the phrase
“Great, just great.” Dean muttered, sitting up carefully and swinging his legs carefully over the edge of the bed. “My fucking hallucinations are babying me.” He grabbed the tea, downing it in one go, before taking a few hasty sips of the smoothie and dragging himself to the bathroom with the wall as a support.
know that. I know you’re not going to magically start eating hamburgers three times a day just because I’m here. We need to work together- all three of us- to figure out how we can get you some substance throughout the day, though. There’s a lot going on, and I doubt you want to be incapacitated by starvation when we figure out a way to kill my father.”
Afterall, why bring Dean back to life just to leave him with the parasite of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome still attached?
Castiel moved to remove Sam’s hoodie from Dean’s lithe frame, the hunter pulled away. “I’m fine.” He snapped. When Castiel continued to look at him expectantly, he sighed and took off the hoodie and a flannel, leaving him still in a long-sleeved shirt.
“Please, Dean.” Sam urged. “What brought this on? You weren’t doing great when you first got out, but you seemed okay at least. And okay is a hell of a lot better than whatever you are now.”
“Dude.” Sam replied to his unvoiced disgust. “It’s kale. Vitamin K? Iron?
“Not sure.” Dean admits as he slows to a leisurely 60 whilst passing a school. “We’ll have to wait and see until after he’s gotten some rest.”
Cas hauls him to his feet carefully and rests Dean’s right arm around his shoulder, holding onto him while letting the hunter use the other hand to grab onto the railing. “Ready?” He asks, waiting for Dean’s nod before starting down the stairs.  When they’re on flat ground, Dean removes his arm from behind Cas’ neck, but the angel makes no move to let him go. “You should lie down.” Castiel whispers, feeling no need to be louder with their heads next to each other’s.
Castiel smiled, pressing a soft kiss to the hunter’s knee.  “Dean.” He replied seriously. “All I need is for you to be yourself. To quote the Elvis, you make me happy when skies are grey.”
Dean considered this. “Not in the living room.” He decided. “The kitchen, though.”
The angel complied, walking over to Dean’s duffle bag and digging through it, pulling out clothes seemingly at random. “Modesty is such a peculiar trait.” Castiel mused. “I know why Adam and Eve possessed it, of course, but with evolution I expected it to be bred out.” Stepping into sweatpants, (commando, Sam tried not to notice) and a T- shirt, Castiel looked strangely relaxed.
Dean shook his head. “Just a hand.”
The first time Dean falls apart after Stanford is the day Dad ditches him.
“Promise.” Dean replied. “Now, hand me that shower gel.”
Dean forgot sometimes just how
Cas sighed, his hand coming up to gently brush the nape of Dean’s neck. “I wish you could see yourself as I see you.”
Castiel scowled. “Food may be scarce here Dean, but a daily meal is entirely doable.”
cake.”
Sam pulled out his phone and texted Charlie.
Dean smiled sadly. “I think it is.”
Castiel pulls him close to his chest in a gentle embrace, their bare skin meeting as he holds him. “I wish I could say it was God given to inspire empathy and set you on the path to become the righteous man.” His fingers trace down Dean’s spine idly. “But there is no rhyme or reason for it.  You are innately in possession of the kindness and compassion to make you the most holy human to currently walk the earth. Your defects do not change that. Your illness may not be a blessing from my father but you must know that it is not a punishment from him, either.”
Dean nodded, letting Cas’s grace infiltrate him, a warm, staticky sensation so familiar it felt downright homey. He hummed in contentment as the pounding in his head retreated and warmth seeped down into his toes. “I forgot your secondary feature of being a space heater.” He teased.
“Cas is in the library.” Sam replied. “Sound like you two worked it out, huh?”
Bobby shows up seven hours later and does a double take when he sees Dean sitting nonchalantly outside his motel room. The only light is from a busted-out streetlight across the parking lot, and Bobby set down his first aid kit with a thump. “You goddam Winchesters.” He scolded. “When you said you were
Cas helped Dean get upright, an the two plodded softly into one of the bathrooms. Dean sat on the closed lid of the toilet, smiling as Cas drew up a bath. “You could have prayed.” Castiel said suddenly, eyes fixated on the tap.
“Don’t do it.” Dean warned. “Don’t try to heal me, Cas.”
He’s somewhere outside Bemidji and the winds are howling like the werewolf his Dad ditched him to fight when Dean realized if he wants money to sleep in the motel or eat something not off the dollar menu, he’s going to have to hustle pool. He gazed out to the snow, and with a sigh, pushed himself off the bed, determined to make it to the shower.
Sam was crying now.  “Dean, fuck, I-“
“We’re about a quarter of a way up a mountain right now.” Benny answered. “Your friend says it’s the quickest route to the exit.” He rearranged the fire, prodding the flaming logs with bare hands.
Dean sighed. “Cas, could you hand me those?” He asked.
He could ask; he really could. Cas was his partner, his lover, his everything. But when the words tried to come out, they caught in his throat. Instead, he calculated a plan. “You could be my hot water bottle.” Dean said slyly, then purposely took a step with far too long a stride for his current shape, causing his knee to buckle.
“No.” He replied firmly. He hated the fogginess they provided- he shuddered to think of how he wouldn’t be able to fight properly if something attacked while he was on narcotics. He thought of taking advil or drinking some whiskey, but he’d had so many stomach ulcers that he would need to eat something, first. He reached for his crutches, knocking them over with a grimace. He suddenly felt watched, like his vulnerability was on display, and felt like he needed to go somewhere or do something, shout or cry or do anything to get the two sets of pitying eyes off of him.
“Dean…”Castiel trailed off, unsure of what words to say next.
“Dean, I’m asking you for the last time.” Bobby warned. “What’s going on?”
“I know.” Castiel replied. “But I want to. I love you, and I want you to feel as good as you possibly can right now.”
“Because that’s what it feels like!” Dean yelled, standing up, ignoring the way his vision swirled. “You weren’t here, and you lamenting it now doesn’t fucking change it!”
“Cas...” Dean continued. “I might not know exactly what you’re going through right now, but I know how it feels to want death. To want an end. But I told myself for years that Sammy needed me, that people needed me. When I couldn’t live for myself, I lived for others.” He reached over and opened the forgotten beer, not caring that it had gone lukewarm by now. “There is no such thing as a stupid reason to live. If you can’t live for yourself right now, please,
“Thanks.” Dean grunted as he more or less collapsed into the chair, leaning his forearm crutches against the table.
“Checkout’s at nine.” He replied, giving a yawn. “So, do you come here often?” He jokes.
Dean nodded, sipping his coffee as Cas bustled at the stovetop, taking the chicken bouillon concentrate from the fridge and diluting it thoughtfully. “I’m going to go take a shower.” Sam blurted out, as if his hair wasn’t still wet from the one he took an hour ago.
“How long you got the motel for?” Bobby asked
Dean swallowed. “Nah, I’m good.” He lies. “I’ll catch you later, Bobby.”
Bobby looked skeptical. “I’ll be back soon.” He said. “I want to see that cocoa gone by the time I’m back.”
Dad is off to god knows where, likely far away from anything resembling cell service, his baby brother is at fucking
Dean felt sick, a nausea twisting in his guts, not a protest from his abused body but rather a response to the sheer guilt of it all. Sam had just been wrecked, thrown out to see without Eileen around to serve as lifeguard, Cas has been dealing with knowing he must kill his own father, they still are all mourning Jack and-
