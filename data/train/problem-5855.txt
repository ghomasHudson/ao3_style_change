One the bottle was empty and Loki burped by Thor he was put in his crib on his nursery with teddy beside him.
“Is okay baby I forgive you, but if they return I want you to apologize with Eddie and Venom yessir?”
-Daddyyyy!- both babies said making grabbing hands for his Daddy, there  diapers were full and wanted then out.
Steve clean Bucky taking off his clothes and putting them in the bin of dirty laundry.  Then he proceed to change Bucky and put the squirming boy next to his brother in the playpen.
"Of course you are. Now, let Daddy change you." Thor said, putting Loki on the changing table. He cleaned him well
It was dark under his crib. That was where Tony was hiding from his Daddy. Why? It was bath time and, unlike Bucky, Tony was not a big fan of getting wet. That made bath time a nightmare for Steve. After searching the whole tower, a few laughs led him into the Bucky and Tony's nursery.
“Baby is time to wake up we have some things to do today, we are gonna have fun and go to the park!” Steve said excited
-I can see everything is fine now- Steve said entering the room. he had listened to the whole conversation.
Steve was tired. It was the middle of the night and Steve was Like really tired. Having two over tired and cranky babies wasn’t a easy task. And all could be avoided if Steve would not have said “yes” to Bucky.
"Baby, do not cry. Accidents happen, I still love you, baby boy. Don't worry, Daddy is going to clean you."
Once dinner was over Janes help Thor washing the dishes while Loki went to the sofa searching for his beloved teddy bear, it was a big green teddy with red overalls but he couldn’t find it there.
"Hey do not cry angel, shhh everything will be fine love calm down" Steve Lifted Tony in his arms, the baby hiding his head in Steve's neck
Thor soon finish making dinner and before he could place the plates with chicken and French fries on the table the phone rang.
Loki in the meantime was getting bored. He start looking at his sorrows until he spot a big jar of cream. He got curious about what was In that jar. So crawling into the jar direction Loki took the jar and opened putting on his hands inside.
“Have you noticed that the Captain almost always brings us coffee when I’m out?” Bruce asked abruptly.
I really hope you liked this!  It was so fun to finally get Tony into this story!  Kind words cherished extra hard right now.
“I’ll do that. Sounds fun,” Bruce said, then added a little more softly. “You’re a good friend, Tony.”
“Tony?” he called, stepping into the workshop.  “I’m sorry about that, okay? I should have talked to you first.”
“Captain Rogers has been at the edge of the upper balcony for twenty minutes. He has made no move to climb over the railing; however, he is not wearing a coat or boots and he appears . . . distressed.”
Tony thrust again and ran his other hand up and down Steve’s back.  A tear escaped from the corner of Steve’s eye and rolled hot down his cheek. (Ah!)
“I guess he’s the one carrying the whip in your relationship, if you’re taking orders from him,” Dom sneered. Tom’s mouth nearly fell open. (Did the guy have a death wish?)
“Yeah, well, me too,” Tony agreed, rubbing his neck. He sidled a little closer to Bruce on instinct, then froze when he noticed.  “You’d better not bail on my spectrometer building party! Just because the glowing guest of honor vamoosed, doesn’t mean
Pepper’d be proud, though, right? They’d finally talked about Howard! And wouldn’t you know it, dear old dad was even a condescending dick to the man he later called his best friend. Name-dropping bastard. Tony grimaced.
“It matters to me,” Tony said softly, stroking Steve’s hair.  “But you don’t have to tell me about it now if you don’t want to.  You don’t
Steve fell silent, awkward and flustered. (Stupid, that’s stupid.)  He focused on the feeling of Tony’s hand against his cheek, the warm body against his--though, sadly through pajamas.
Tony rolled his eyes. “He’s such a diva now that he’s on TV. I think it’s gone to his head. But he’d do it if I asked since he’s gonna owe me always forever—I sent Captain America to him for a fitting.” Tony stretched. “Anyway, if I needed to ‘make it work’ at the last minute, I’d call Tim.”
and rotated his wrist in little motions, like Steve was a jar he was working open little by little.  (Oh God.)  There was an ache to the feeling, but not a bad one.  Tony scissored his fingers wider and wider as he pressed in and out, then crooked his fingers and sent Steve arching off the bed.
“Hey,” Tony said a little uncertainly, rubbing his hand up and down Steve’s back. Steve just squeezed him tighter. Tony bit his lip, then asked, “Rough day at the office, babe?”
The Avengers suites took shape quickly—amazing what money can buy! Tony actually enjoyed the challenge of designing a gym for a super-soldier and an archery range and training zone for crazy ninjas.  Ha!  Let’s see Barton keep his perfect record against Tony’s speedy little targets.  (Good luck with that, Katniss.)  So what if Tony gave up a private floor to communal use.  Big deal—he had all the amenities he needed on the top floor and, let’s face it, he spent 80% of his time in the shop anyway.  So, Tony told the three Doms that Stark Tower would be ready for them on Friday, any time after 9 am.
“Man, we were starting to think you’d been kidnapped,” Clint said.  Tony rolled his eyes. Clint continued with a sly look, “Or that maybe Steve went over to the dark side and was keeping you chained up somewhere as his sex slave.”
Bucky just followed his daddy quietly, afraid that maybe he would get even more mad. They arrived at the nursery and Steve put Tony back on his crib, kissing his cheek and wishing him a good night.
“Okay Boys lets pick up all this toys our guests are soon to arrive” Steve said going over his two little who where having the time of their lives playing with Tony’s blocks in the living room while inside out was playing on the TV in front of them.
Tony watched as Steve went to his crib and from there he took Tony's pacifier who immediately began to move asking for the pacifier that then Steve put in his mouth. Tony stood still and sucked the object in his mouth happily.
Steve went to the changing table and set Bucky down, he made a quick job changing the nappy, cleaning Bucky’s penis and bum then putting some rash cream and finally tapping the a new nappy in the baby. He went to the dresser and took a some jeans and a t-shirt’s for Tony and Bucky. Once Bucky was full dressed he let the little play around the nursery with some toys while he goes to take care of Tony.
“Okay boys come on” Steve lay down between his two babies a give each of them a bottle. He then start stroking the boys head, singing for them to calm down. After the bottles were finish he burp them and let them sleep for a while.
Bruce rush to the kitchen to prepare to bottles of milk in lest that 10 minuets he was back with the bottles. He put each baby in the playpen, put a Disney movie and give each baby the bottle. The two of them start sucking the warm milk until they fell sleep Hugging each other.
-Okay so let’s wait JARVIS to have the tub filed. Go and choose you pajamas while I put Bucky in the nursery so if he wakes up he can find us in the same room. Agree?-
Once the bottles were ready steve took his babies to his room to the big bed. The boys crawl still making grabby hands for Steve.
"He's in the living room watching a movie and drinking his bottle." Steve said, lifting Bucky in his arms and taking him to the living room. Tony sat contentedly on Thor's lap, drinking his bottle while Loki leaned on his daddy, hugging his plush goat. Loki noticed that his cousin arrived and he started to jump towards him eagerly. Steve dropped Bucky to the floor, where he smiled and ran towards Loki.
“Of course, but first I need to change these two smelly babies” steve answer. He went to the nursery and made a quick jog changing both babies. And then went back to Phil and Clint.
“But he still have some of his baby habits, like no telling his mommy and Daddy when he needs the potty” Jane said excusing himself to take Loki to the potty.
While Steve was busy packing Tony and Bucky decide they were boring of watching TV now that their bottles were finished.
"Hey don't cry Baby, Daddy doesn't like to see his baby sad. Do you want a warm bottle of milk?" Asked Steve, trying to comfort Bucky.
“Should I give you a bath?” Jane ask picking up Loki sitting him on the changing table while taking off his shirt
"Aww baby, your little tummy does not feel good eh, do not worry daddy will make you feel better, but first let me clean you I bet that diaper does not feel very good"
-No steve, stay calm Im gonna think of someone. You stay calm and layback- Bruce help Steve get back in bed
"Not yet, Baby. I need to change you of that wet nappy and then you can go play." Steve said, resting Bucky on top of the changing table. Thor and Loki left the room to give the two some privacy.
In one moment Loki start feeling a little itchy inside his nappy, so bringing the hand covered in cream he put the hand inside his nappy and start scratching down there, leaving some cream inside.
-Tony be nice your brother is playing with that one just wait a little so you can Okay later okay ?-
Tony just looked at Bucky with an unsure face, he knew how this was going to end. Probably daddy would hear them and he'll come downstairs to check where the noises were coming only on to find him and his brother.
“Maybe a bottle and a nap would be good right now, what do you think” both babies continue crying “I really could use a nap with my two favorite boys” He kiss each baby forehead before going over the table and strap his sons on the high chairs, obviously this only makes they crying louder.
Tony, hearing the words of his daddy quickly came out from underneath his crib.    Steve caught him and picked him up. Tony just hid his face in Steve's neck.
And now Steve was starting to feel headaches, pain all over his body and in some occasions he’s been sick.
If you're still reading this Thank u so much and if u wants to see more of this let me know or something that you'll like to see...Also I have a new story it's freaking weird haha
The little obediently took his toys away while Steve turn off the TV and then tony  walk back to Steve arms. This one picking his little up giving kisses on his cheek.
“I think we should let them have a little space let’s go and start dinner” Anne suggests giving Dan a small smile, Dan in return kiss Anne’s cheek.
Thor filled the cup to then give it to loki who ran happily to the living room to continue playing with his stuffed animals.
Back in the room Steve gave both boys the sippy cup and then settled into the middle of their two babies, each of them placed his head on each of Steve's legs.
Steve took Tony and Bucky to their nursery were he changed them in less than a minute. After cleaning all the boys toys and feed them some bottles the family sat happily on the sofa watching a movie while their guests arrive.
After the movie Eddie was sound asleep, Venom not that much he didn’t need it anyway so the symbiont with two tentacles start putting up the bed sheets over Eddie small body.
Bucky start to count while Loki and Tony run to hide, Tony decided to hide behind the door of the bathroom while Loki decide to hide in the babies nursery.
And now everything make sense. This wasn’t the first time Loki touched things and then with the dirty hand he touched his privates. The first time Thor was confused and took Loki to the doctor, who told him that Loki’s skin was more  sensitive and could get irritated very easily with some products.
"Breath baby, look same as Daddy" Steve start breathing calmly for Tony's sake, the little following his Daddy.
Both friends enjoyed the warm water after all the crying. And after a pull-up and pijamas were on place Eddie and Venom relaxed on Anne and Dans bed watching a movie while drinking a bottle of sweet milk. (With a little bit of chocolate, venom’s favourite.
"No!" said Bucky adamantly. Tony's eyes began to fill with tears as Steve immediately addressed Bucky.
“Okay babies time to eat” Steve said, he usually would help the boys to eat but because he made pancakes he could let them eat by themselves.
-how is my sweet baby boy this morning- Steve ask while picking up  Bucky how Also end his cries in the moment steve pick him up.
Steve was fast asleep in his bed, with a baby at his side. Bucky had refused to go to sleep in his own crib the previous night and to avoid a possible tantrum Steve decided that when Tony was asleep he would take Bucky to his bed.
Steve put Bucky on the table putting a bib on his little neck, he then went over to Tony picking him up and strapped him on his highchair.
"No way Tony this is our chance to be the first ones to try the new chocolate cookies uncle Thor brought yesterday"
“What monster baby” Steve ask looking at Anne and Dan who had an also crying little in his arms. And now it all clicked to Steve, Bucky had meet Venom.
-Hey Bruce don’t worry I understand. But I have to said I don’t have no one to take care of my two little monsters- Steve laugh
"Buddy smells" At first Steve did not understand until he came closer to the place where Tony was sitting with a block is his mouth.
Once the two little were set Steve made his way out of the tower and start the ride to they first stop. The mall. Steve was getting out of diapers and food so they need to do some shopping, then he would take the two Little’s to the park.
They were in the park for almost an hour until Steve saw it was time for lunch. and probably Tony and Bucky needed a change too.
“Come on baby the soon you sit and pee the soon we would be out of here and you can continue playing”
“Funny” Loki said to himself, the cream felt good in his hand. He continue playing with the cream. Grabbing and then letting go.
"Don't say that, baby boy. You're still good, you just made a bad decision. Daddy still loves you." Thor said, carrying his baby to the nursery.
Steve return moments later with the cream and applied some on Tony's and Bucky's butt's, before putting them on diapers.
Thor put Loki in the changing table and opened the nappy only to find Loki’s balls and penis all red.
After saying good bye to the other family Steve went straight to the nursery to have a talk with his boys.
Steve pass a hand through his hair, now he had two babies crying his lungs out. He went over and pick up the boys in each arm.
"Aw baby don't cry" steve pick up a half naked Bucky "in not mad I know you guys can be really curious at times, but you know better than to climb out of your crib and help Tony you know that"
-Boys please, don’t be rude with each other, was an accident- Steve tried to said only to be cut off
“I think is better if we just called out the day this was way to soon” Anne said sitting next to Dan murmuring something in Eddie’s ear.
"Daddy im sorry" Bucky whispered in the verge of tears "don't be mad" tears start rolling down his cheeks.
Steve has just finish with the two bottles when he suddenly hear the cries of some not very happy littles. He quickly ran to the room where Bucky was crying, a reddened mark on his arm. He ran towards his daddy while Tony sadly looked at them from one of the corners.
“Don’t worry Steve we understand that this my be a little to much for your little kids and besides this happened with just the two of them I cannot imagine how things are gonna go with the other little ones” Dan explains
-No baby don’t worry is fine I’m not mad, come on calm down baby I know you’re sick. Both of my babies are and don’t worry Daddy would take good care of you two.
“Is okay they deserve some time apart from me” Steve smiled he could have his baby’s anytime they deserve some time with their aunts and uncles too.
Steve put Toy Story and left both children in only the diaper in the room because of the heat was doing that day. He headed to the kitchen where two sippy cups served apple juice, making sure he sank medicine to help Tony.
Steve then came back with two bottles of milk. Tony and Bucky start drinking te milk until their eyes start getting closed.
“Then why people keep saying it” Eddie cry rubbing his tired eyes with his little fist while playing with his hair,  venom manifested in front of him one of his tentacles wiping Eddie’s tears.
A whole week was needed for the two babies too be fine again. And steve couldn’t be more happy two have back his two happy and lovely babies.
The three adults (and Eddie) make his way over the living room were Bucky was waiting for them. but in the moment he saw the couple he was fast to hide behind his daddy’s legs.
"Please calm down you two. Tony you are going to have ten minutes in the corner for biting Bucky. Bucky you will have five for throwing the tower down." Both children seemed ready to complain but the look of their Daddy was enough to leave them speechless. The two both dragged their feet on the way to the corners. After the time finished, Steve called both of his children and took them to the nursery. There he gave them their bottles and put them in their cribs. It had been a long night.
Later in the morning Steve was in the kitchen preparing waffles for his Little Boys, when he felt a hand pulling his shirt. It was Bucky.
"Yeah, I see Baby. A cute duck." Tony just giggled and continued playing, splashing it in the water.
Bucky was about to ask him to shut again but at that moment the lights decide to turn on and Steve silhouette with messy blond hair, pijamas and sleepy face appears in the kitchen door.
Toby just continue to cry. He in effect fell a little icky, he just want his Daddy to make it all better again.
"Are you done doll" asteve ask looking down at Bucky who was fast asleep with some milk dripping down his chin.
Bucky was already in the kitchen looking through the cupboards, while Tony just stop there thinking.
Steve finished preparing breakfast and catch both babies and sit them in their high chairs. Breakfast was a mess of honey everywhere and chunks of waffles on the floor, but both kids ate and that's enough for Steve to be satisfied.
"Boo is okay, I wasn't that mad I'm just tired" steve kissed Buckys cheek "you are just a tired little boy aren't you"
They took out Loki’s dinosaurs set that include eight different species also they build a pillow fort and start playing.
Sitting besides tony on the soft carpet they had in the living room Eddie saw someone staring at him, rising his head he meet the eyes of the boy with long brown hair.
They arrive to the mall in no time. Steve getting everything he needed while the two babies were happy in their pushchair sucking on his pacifier looking around with amazing eyes. They didn’t went out a lot. Just for missions because Little’s need more protection some times.
“We’re plenty focused.” Tony shrugged, trying to hold that sick sinking feeling at bay. “We fly in, deploy one of my handy dandy devices, and fly out. We’ll be back in time for
“But he does have admirable qualities!”  Steve looked like he would say more, then changed his mind and shook his head.  He glanced around at the glowing blue schematics and hesitated.  “Do you still have time for dinner?”
“Fine! Everything’s fine!” Tony said it too loud. (Shit.) Too little sleep and his defenses were down.
“Huh?”  Tony cut JARVIS off.  He flicked up the faceplate.  “That’s right,” he told Rogers in a neutral voice.
“Looking forward to it,” Steve added softly, probably too late for Tony to hear, but what he really wanted to say was “thank you” or maybe “merry Christmas.” And Stark Tower was still ugly, still sleek and strange, but it finally felt a little less cold.
Tony's head was tipped back against the edge of the tub, eyes shut and an inch away from sleep. Steve realized a little guiltily that he could happily keep caressing and bathing Tony until their fingers got pruney, but it would be terribly selfish of him to linger. Steve finished bathing Tony's lower half, keeping the touches to his genitals as gently non-sexual as he could, and then scooted up to take Tony in his arms, back to chest.
“There’s nothing wrong with therapy. But for it to work, you need to have trust, which I couldn’t give a SHIELD therapist either.” Tony smiled. “I’m way too paranoid. But Rhodey helped me find someone I could work with. I could put you in touch.”
“Ung,”  Steve let out a little grunt and squeezed his eyes shut, bucking up into Tony’s hand.  Tony felt a sudden heady rush.  (Steve liked it, it was good, he was good, he’d make Steve feel good . . .)
“Wait! Cap made breakfast and I missed it?”  Clint said.  “Well shit.  Hey, if you dating Stark means pancakes, I’m all in favor.”
“When was the last time you gave me gadgets anyhow?” Tony let out another little squawk. “And you still won’t give me more guns.”
“Hey, Pep?” Tony said, pouring them each a generous scotch. “What’s going on with What’s-His-Face? That guy.”
“Uh. So, the weather’s supposed to be decent today.” Steve shoved his hands into his pockets. “So I thought maybe it would be a good time to take the Dominator out for a ride. You busy?”
Steve gave a wistful smile as he said, “I’m supposed to be so strong now.” He shook his head. “I couldn’t even get out from under the debris.” Steve’s breathing was speeding up again; Tony squeezed his hand as Steve’s words came tumbling out, “I just kept squirming, pinned there while the water rose, and I wanted to get free and break the glass, try and swim, even though it was too cold to make it far and I wouldn’t know which way to go, but . . . but it would have been better than just letting the water rise higher and higher. And it was cold, so cold, like the forest but worse.”
“No,” Tony said, taking another shot, “we’ll have to make a subset algorithm for it to test conditions on the other side of the portal and then auto-adjust. That’s what the yellow, red, and white cords connecting to the jerry-rigged StarkTab are for. I’ll just have to come fix up the programming.”
“I’m afraid Dr. Banner is still out, Mr. Stark,” a voice said politely from the entrance to the lab.  “It’s me. Steve Rogers.” A momentary pause before he added, “But I’d be happy to help if I can.”
And re: the saints: St. Anthony is patron saint of the lost (also of women looking for a husband!)  Gabriel the Archangel is patron saint of “diplomats, ambassadors, communications workers, postal workers, emergency dispatchers, police dispatchers, broadcasters, messengers, and radio/television workers.”
“No, not at all!” He still sounded surprised, but pleased too. “That sounds lovely. I can meet you whenever it’s convenient.”
“I should get up,” Steve said with a sigh. “Gotta debrief with the Agents at SHIELD and give them some more training.” He snorted. “They have some trigger happy children running around there—I can’t see how Fury lets it fly.”
“And now . . .  I just . . .”  Steve shrugged again.  “I guess it feels a little weird reading about this, about how other people have
“Excellent choices,” the server said with a smile, “And I’ll bring the wine right out to you, gentlemen.”
Tony just grinned and turned to the others, “So—who’s up next? How about you, Bruce? Yep. Here we go!”
Steve’s voice was soft and sweet, but nearly startled Tony.  He hadn’t heard Steve approach.  He wasn’t sure if he should look up or not—it wasn’t traditional—and (God damn it!) since when did he get in a fluster over such minor—
“Yeah,” Steve said, with an unconvincing shrug. Then he added, “We’re gonna have to meet with SHIELD soon.” He frowned then asked, “How much longer until we can go to the ranch do you think? Are your projects almost done?”
“Tony, that’s ridiculous.”  Steve turned to fix Tony with an exasperated look which no doubt looked more besotted than chastening.  (Oh well.)  “You have to keep your strength up. That amazing brain does, in fact, need fuel to run properly.”
They were quiet for a moment before Steve said, “I’m glad you’re back.” He swallowed thickly. “I wanted to apologize. For the last time we spoke, before you left. I’m sorry for that. I hope I didn’t make you uncomfortable.”
Then, (thank you, thank you . . . ) Tony was entering Steve harder and faster.  (Oh fuck!  Please, please, please . . .)
Tony felt like he’d been punched; his stomach fell and the air rushed from his lungs so fast it left him half-dizzy.
By 3 pm they’d made some good progress on the hypotheticals, so Bruce left to practice yoga, earnestly inviting Tony to join him. (“Good for mind
Dinner passed in a pleasant blur of food and chatter, warmth and contentment. And now they’d reached the after dinner dilemma: which movie would they watch?
“Well, yes,” Captain Rogers says, rubbing the back of his neck, “But they gave us a pretty free rein since we got results.”
“Oh fuck!” Tony cried, arms tightening around Steve.  Tony’s eyes were bright and wide, his cheeks flushed.   “Talk like that and we’ll never go to dinner. Scratch that—we’ll never go anywhere again.  I’ll just chain you to the bed and keep you here forever as my pleasure slave.”  Tony kissed him.  “God, you have no idea what you do to me, do you?”  Tony groaned.  “Only you could sound sweet and innocent while begging me to teach you how to deep-throat my cock.”
Rogers shook his head with another disgusted noise and waved his hand angrily at the TV.  “All I know about that car is that it comes in red!  What kind of engine does it have?  How much horsepower?  Features?  Price?”  Rogers let out an exasperated sigh and changed the channel.
“Likewise,” Steve answered. They exchanged a solemn nod and Clint took his leave. Steve went straight to the taping station and began to wrap his hands.
,” Tony gasped.  He dragged Steve up flush against him, chest to chest.  Tony licked the cum from Steve’s face then seized his mouth in a fierce kiss. (Fuck!) He wrapped one hand around Steve’s throat, a firm presence without cutting off his air.  Tony’s grip in Steve’s hair eased slowly as his kisses turned languid, slow deep swipes of tongue.  Eventually, Tony pulled back to kiss Steve’s forehead, petting his hair gently and murmuring to him:
“I’m glad,” Rebecca said. She reached out to stroke Tony’s hair.   “Sam was very sorry he couldn’t stay in bed with us. He didn’t like to leave you sleeping, but I’m afraid he had an early meeting.”
Steve opened his mouth to say something, then closed it and just smiled for a moment before saying softly, “Thank you, Tony.”
“I’m way too old to sleep hunched over in the workshop if I don’t have to.  And, well . . .” Tony hesitated, clutching the coffee to his chest.  “Workaholic sleep deprivation isn’t gonna do much without some new data.  I’ve done everything I can think of for the portal devices, so . . .”  Tony trailed off with a shrug.
Thanks so much for joining me!  I hope you enjoyed this chapter.  Sorry for the delay-- for some reason I found this chapter particularly hard to write.  Kind of a mellow chapter, but I promise a bit more dramatic 'oomph' in the next two! :-)
“Would you pull up the Master Contract for me please, J?” Tony asked, voice a little softer that usual.
They chatted pleasantly for a while, but eventually Tony started getting restless--there were top donors drifting past and he needed to snag a few (and, of course, it had been a while since he’d caught of glimpse of Steve . . .).
The guitar turned to “O Come All Ye Faithful” and they both fell quiet, looking at the tree together. After a moment, Steve checked his watch.
“You’re so wonderful,” Tony murmured carding his fingers through Steve’s hair and rocking him gently as he spoke.
Natasha draped herself across the armchair and pulled knitting needles and yarn out of a small canvas bag.
Steve kissed first his left hand and then his right. He stood there, smiling down at Tony. Tony stood there blinking stupidly up and trying to catch his breath.
“Oh,” Steve bit his lip. “This afternoon? Sorry. I can’t.” He hesitated. “I have an . . . appointment.”
Also, major SPOILERS for Star Trek “The Devil in the Dark,” one of my all time favorites.  BUT you can watch it here for free!  Highly recommend!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkkvYIei5eQ
Steve went completely still. Tony waited, on high alert. (Was Steve holding his breath?) Tony gave it another moment. (Maybe Steve was just startled.) Tony’d figured that—like Bruce and Rhodey—Steve would find it easier to accept physical comfort under the polite fiction that he was the one
Tony wrinkled his nose and set down the rest of his sandwich. “I make it a habit never to read drivel and am frankly surprised to find that you do.”
So sorry for the long delay and the short chapter!  I really wanted to post this scene together with the next one, but the second scene is giving me lots of trouble and I didn't want to delay this part any longer.  Thank you for your patience and constant support!  You are wonderful!
Vast gratitude to rendingrozencrantz, multifandom-madness, and rex_luscious for their help getting these photomanips into the chapter!  (Seriously, I couldn't have figured this stuff out on my own.  I'm worse than Steve when it comes to coding.)
“I’m glad,” Steve said softly.  He turned off the gas and set the griddle aside.  “And you’re just in time for your breakfast.  Go on.  Grab a seat.”
The bartender automatically handed Tony champagne, and turned to ask Rogers what he’d like. Asshole. Tony slid the champagne away. “Scotch,” he ordered, “neat.” Tony thought his eyes flicked to the Captain for a second before making Tony’s drink, but he wasn’t sure.
Tony was swimming in adrenaline, excitement, hope, fear.  (What would they put in that contract? Oh shit.  Was that why Rogers was helping him?)
Resigned to his fate, Tony rolled out of bed with a luxurious stretch. (Perhaps he could still lure Steve back to bed?) Tony pulled on lounge pants and a sweatshirt and padded down the hall.
Tony huffed. He kept trying to describe the engineering work he’d done earlier, but instead he just kept circling around to rant about how pissed he was at Bruce for his lack of faith in the plan.
his way towards military research on the mantis shrimp’s cell composition, which naturally turned into watching youtube clips of mantis shrimps and the mimic octopus, then surfing the best animal videos on the internet.**
Steve nodded and just looked at him, smiling. Tony glanced away, feeling uneasy. The silence stretched between them.
“I’d better go change and get my coat,” Bruce said, “if we’re going to meet the others in fifteen minutes.”
Tony soon lost track of time, immersed in multilateration scans.  The steady stream of old timey music blurred together, less present and real to him than the steady background of Steve’s pencil scritching across paper, punctuated occasionally by frantic erasing.
Mrs. Rhodes shook her head and waved a hand to shush him, then turned to Steve. “Well, Captain, you’ll have to get an early start on that beast. I hear you volunteered to roast it.”
“I—“ Rogers finally looked at Tony. His brow was still creased, uncertain, his blue eyes wide and perhaps a bit startled. “Ok.” Rogers took the coffee, then held it close to his chest in both hands. Tony drank his deeply, scalding his tongue, but Rogers just clutched at it and hovered. Usually Rogers seemed willing, or even eager, to take the bull by the horns and talk, but today (perhaps for the first time) he looked desperately like he wanted to flee and the only thing holding him in place was that cup of coffee.
Trigger Warning: slut shaming, orientationism, sexism, mentions of psychological trauma, but if you've made it to chapter 29 none of that will probably surprise you by now...
“So hey,” Tony said as Steve plated his eggs. “Here’s a thought! How about we start things up a little early—I was thinking we could go to the Met this afternoon and then go for dinner. What do you think?”
Tony was just emerging from his bathroom, bare-footed and bare-chested, fitted gray trousers slung low on his hips.  The arc reactor glowed in his chest, rising and falling with his breathing, the scars around it clearly visible in the bright light.  Tony’s hair was still wet and dripping from his shower.  They stood frozen-- staring at one another—then sprang into action.
“Favorite?” Tony squawked, shoving him away. “You mean there are others? You’ve been running around with other billionaires behind my back? You cheating cad!”
“Tony?”  Steve murmured.  When Tony turned, Steve leaned down for an eager, open-mouthed kiss.  Mmm.  Tony let himself be swept up for a few moments-- tongues caressing, all wet heat, before he remembered his purpose and pulled away.
Everyone took a seat, except Johnny and Dominic who stood at the head of the table near the screens. Like the military, SHIELD loved their fucking PowerPoint.
Rogers nodded. “Yeah, no. I know.” He shook his head. Without seeming to notice it, he raised a hand to fuss at his bowtie again. “And I do want to help; it’s important. I just—I’m not very good at this sort of thing.”

Tony pressed kisses to every bit of Steve he could reach—his ear, his cheekbone, his hair—and wrapped his legs around him, as Steve shuddered and panted through the aftershocks, holding Steve close (Well, as close as he could, still tied securely to the headboard.)
“Doubt it,” Tony said with a snort.  If the afternoon’s weirdness was about anything besides Rogers' isolation, it was far more likely about the Doms' of SHIELD Bet, the Gentlemen’s Wager, than anything romantic.  Rogers was from the ‘40s.  He’d hardly go for an infamous bitch slut like Tony, not with a 17%-- weirdo coffee deliveries notwithstanding.  Still, none of those were things he wanted to admit to Bruce.
“I’m so glad,” Steve said. A moment later his smile faded and he added, “And I guess we’ll have to tell SHIELD eventually.”
Tony smiled, then frowned. (Shit. Steve. Steve was there.) Tony took stock of himself. At some point he’d ditched his button-down shirt, leaving only a threadbare tank top. He felt this was a problem somehow. A Steve problem, but he couldn’t remember why.
Tony worked on the training robots while Steve alternated between sketching in his notebook and working his way through a stack of reports.
“Of course you can!” Tony cried, starting to get excited. “And it’s good practice. It’s the weekend. Just come out here and
Eventually, though, Tony had to break the silence—he couldn’t hold it in. Very, very quietly he said: “Steve? You said you weren’t going to jump—” Steve took a sharp breath, and Tony rushed on, “No, don’t start. I believe you—the thought didn’t even cross your mind—but
“Mmmhmm.” Rhodey paused. “ ‘Cause, you know, I can’t help noticing Steve still calls you ‘Mr. Stark.’”
“I did get to see something while I was there, though.” Steve got a sort of far away look and his smile turned warmer. He took a sip of his wine. “We’d taken shelter on a farm in Northern France. It was winter—bitterly cold—and we were in occupied territory, and this old farmer made space for all fourteen of us, spread out in his cottage. He stayed up, smoking his pipe and watching the road for any sign of trouble, letting the men rest. I couldn’t sleep, so I was sketching.”
The lilt in her voice, the curve of her lips, the arch of her eyebrow all promised a shattering evening of mutual pleasure. A promise Tony knew she could keep. She’d hold him hovering on the brink, bound tight, begging and gasping and desperate for—
*re: dyke.  This was probably clear from context, but just to clarify: in this AU dyke is slang for a female Domme.  Though historically used as a pejorative, the word has undergone a process of reappropriation and is now often (though not always) used as a term of self-identification or affectionately in re: Dommes who like to use the term themselves.
“Oh bullshit!  This isn’t about the spectrometer and you can’t distract me, but hey, I’ll run with it for a moment,” Tony said.  “First, I bought all the materials; second, Bruce and I designed it.   It sure as shit isn’t yours.  Also, if you try to steal it? Refuse to hand it over or try to use it for something I disapprove of?  I built a fail-safe.  I can make the whole thing implode in a controlled detonation-- any time, any place.”
They chuckled.  “Yeah,” Rhodey said with a wry smile.  “Hell, I’m tempted to say it’s all your fault, Tones!”
It was a warm quiet evening in the Great Swamp Wildlife Refuge, but Tony shivered a little looking at it. They were damn lucky the energy field had showed up somewhere isolated instead of some poor dude’s living room.  Then again, maybe it wasn’t luck.
Tony snorted. “I’ve sent it to my lawyers and back to Fury nine times.  So, yeah, I’d say there’s something wrong with it.”
“We’ve met briefly,” he said with a self-deprecating smile, “But it was a while ago. No reason you’d remember.” He held out his hand. “Harry Silverstein.”
“Captain Rogers,” she said, turning to Steve with a polite nod. “It’s nice to meet you. Please follow me.”
“And you must be Steve!  So handsome!” Chad fawned.  “Oh, Tony, I’m just so happy for you--I could die!”
“Yeah,” Steve growled.  He hoisted Tony into his arms like he weighed nothing and Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s waist, rutting his hard cock up against Steve’s body.
“ . . . don’t massage or otherwise rub freshly released limbs, especially if indentations remain in their flesh from the restraints.  Such rubbing may be painful and cause tissue damage.  Let freshly released tissue re-expand at its own pace” (146).
Steve leaned forward and gestured, putting on a subtle Italian accent—not the heavy exaggeration of comedy, but a careful, affectionate imitation—as he said: “You grow up on bad Irish food, and look! You’re skin and bones, Stephano! Lasagna! Carbonara! We fix you up. Take, take, but don’t tell Anna!”
“If you like,” Steve said after a moment’s hesitation. “I feel terrible that I don’t have anything for you though.”
“Huh?” Tony looked up abruptly. Bruce was giving him an amused little smile as he gestured to the board.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, tilting his head for a kiss. Steve gave him a peck on the cheek and headed to the elevator with Clint.
“Yep. Sorry, big guy,” Tony said, patting his shoulder consolingly and clinking their drinks together. “Cheers.”
“Well sure,” Pepper agreed, “But, you’re The Avengers! People pay thousands of dollars to attend lavish benefits where they’ll get a chance to meet you. Even if they don’t learn any particularly unique moves, I think the Safehouse residents would enjoy the experience.”
“Shhh. . .  ‘m sleepin,’ ” Tony muttered, words blurry.  “ ‘m havin’ a good dream.”  Tony ran his fingers lazily through Steve’s hair and tried to suppress a smile.  “Can’t wake up . . . ‘m dreamin’ Cap’n America’s in bed with me . . .”
“Here,” Tony said after a few moments.  He gestured to the bags she’d left in the doorway.  “Why don’t I carry those over to the house and get you settled in with—“
“Legitimacy.  Accountability,” Tony said firmly.  “Without them, we look like vigilantes, running wild, doing whatever we want.  I know.  I’ve been there and it wasn’t pretty.  With SHIELD oversight, when people say ‘who authorized that?’ we can say, ‘SHIELD--and behind them, your own elected officials.  Congress.  The Commander in Chief.’
"Okay baby we are over, go lay down on the couch while I'm with Tony Okay?" Steve said kissing Buckys cheek taking off his nappy to let his bum get some air.
After that breakfast Steve took them both to give them a bath to quiet all that honey until their hair had lodged. As he began to undress the children Steve noticed that Tony had again dirtied his diaper. So after the bath Steve would put the two babies to watch a movie and give some medicine to Tony to calm his Little tummy.
"Sowwy Tony." Bucky apologized and continued his fun together with his brother. Steve contentedly headed to the kitchen to prepare two bottles for his babies.
-No baby we are going to the tower but I promise you, once Uncle Steve is all better they can come and you can show them your room- Thor said
“Okay we can go, but first we have to put you and you brother in the pushchair so we can go to the park”
“Boys what’s happening here” Steve said picking up Bucky bouncing him a little trying to calm him down
Loki and Bucky spent the rest of the afternoon playing without any more incidents. When the time came for loki and Thor to leave, both cousins said their goodbyes with tears. Not too many, for they would soon see each other again.
Loki then decided the cream was bored so he put the jar again in his place and continue watching TV, scratching some times his balls and penis that were a little itchy.
There wasn't a single soul in the tower, everybody was asleep except for two little rascals. Bucky somehow had figured out how to get out of the crib (by climbing it of course) and then helped Tony open his own crib so they both could do some wandering around the tower.
"Okay looking at the wall, were are gonna start....now!" Steve set the alarm before going leaving the room for a moment. Both boys sniffling sadly.
And then Tony’s letting out what seems like months’ worth of thoughts and frustrations, and Steve’s at a loss for words. No, that can’t be it, can it? All this time he thought they were on the same page, that Tony was the one keeping Steve at a distance, and he had understood, of course he had, especially after his breakup with Pepper. But now…now he is not so sure anymore. Maybe he’s just been too blind to realize he’s been stuck in the past for so long that he can’t live in the present anymore. And he’s been hurting the one person he’s never wanted to hurt all this time without even realizing it.
They’re eating pizza in Steve’s room, watching Star Wars again, and as the credits start to roll and Tony gets up to stretch, Steve gathers the courage to ask.
The Tower is quiet when Tony emerges, slow, careful steps guiding him toward the kitchen. He sees the team sitting on couches in the living room, watching a movie all cuddled up, and he smiles but continues to the kitchen silently, wanting to eat something before saying hi.
“Tony, I…” he doesn’t know what to say, doesn’t know what would make the situation better or fix the pain he’s been subconsciously inflicting on Tony all this time.
“I thought you were done drinking, Tony. What made you do this?” Steve asks as he takes a step closer to Tony’s slumped form at the foot of the bed, bottle and glass within grabbing range. The look flickers between worried and disappointed in Tony’s poisoned mind, not being able to gauge out which it is, but Tony settles for disappointed, since that’s the mood Steve seems to always be in around the genius.
The body next to him is warm, chest rising and falling softly with every breath he takes, and although Steve is right there, next to him, he’s never felt more distanced from Tony. Earlier, when he was resting his head on Steve’s chest, trying to catch his breath after one of the best orgasms Tony’s ever felt, he could faintly hear the other’s equally erratic heartbeat against his cheek. No words were exchanged between them, no “that was good”, no “did you like it?”, no words of comfort or affection passed between them. Tony’d just turned around, back to Steve. After, he caught his breath and waited until he heard the blonde’s own breathing calming down into the telltale signs of sleep to turn around and lie on his back.
Tony doesn’t talk to Steve for a week. He passes by him but doesn’t spare him a glace, sits next to him in debriefing but ignores him profusely, and even when Steve talks to him, the man acts like he can’t see and hear him.
Steve doesn’t give up though. He keeps showing up at his door every night, and even though Tony doesn’t open the door, Steve takes a seat on the floor, rests his head against the door and talks to him about anything and everything. He apologizes for breaking Tony’s heart every night, and he can hear the brunet crying half of the nights Steve’s there.
“Don’t talk,” Steve cuts him off with a kiss because he doesn’t want to use words now, can’t use words when he knows he might fuck it up even further. Instead, he wants to show Tony how he feels and apologize to him through actions. He drags them into the nearest open room, locks the door behind them and makes it up to Tony, loving the feeling of his skin underneath Steve’s lips and the sounds he can get out of Tony’s mouth.
Steve doesn’t look for him in the morning, doesn’t even ask JARVIS where he is when he wakes up alone in Tony’s room, and later when they bump into each other on the halls of the Tower –Tony in search of a sink to deposit his empty mug before taking a shower and Steve coming out of the kitchen– Steve doesn’t so much as nod at Tony in greeting, just pierces him with those judgemental blue eyes of his. Tony catches himself wistfully wishing that just once, they would look at Tony with warmth swirling in their midst instead of that iciness Steve seems to have reserved just for him. He stops himself before the thought can develop further when an aching sting from his childhood and a different name pop up in his mind (damn you, Howard) and simply slips right past Steve and into the kitchen, deposits the mug in the sink and bolts for his room to take that shower.
Still in shock, Steve remains facing the door and he can hear Tony muttering something to himself before he starts crying. It takes everything in Steve to walk away and not barge in there to comfort the man.
He ignores him because it’s the only time he feels in control in their relationship. Tony’s never been a control freak, mostly letting his partner lead the way unless he felt the situation required his input, but with Steve it’s different. There’s no relationship to speak of, and any friendship they might have had before is gone now. They were good friends until a couple months ago, and Tony really thought they were on the same page there right before they fell in bed. But turns out Steve only wanted sex and nothing more, and Tony, being the self-deprecating asshole that he is, just rolled with it, taking whatever he could get from him.
But he can’t let Tony go, can’t let him slip through his fingers just because he’s been a complete fool. He knows better now and he will fix it, no matter how long it takes. If it takes a lifetime to get Tony to trust him again, Steve will do it. It will be the best use of his life there could ever be.
It’s obvious Tony didn’t take his reaction well because the genius takes the farthest seat away from him in the debriefing room, doesn’t even look at him even when he’s talking
“Doombots seem to be taking over Washington Square Park, sir,” JARVIS informs him as soon as the helmet is on, and additional data pops up on the HUD as Tony powers up the thrusters and takes off in the direction of the park, closely following the Avengers Quinjet.
“Well, you swore to be my friend and not fall into old habits of judging me every three seconds too, but I guess we’re both bad at keeping promises.”
“C’mon, Cap, let’s just get drunk together,” Tony ignores the question and extends the bottle to Steve. “Forget we don’t like each other, huh?”
“Oh don’t play innocent now, Steve,” Tony huffs. “I thought we had something going on here, something nice, and then you fucked me once and decided acting like a literal block of ice was better. I’m tired of your mind always drifting back to Bucky, to Peggy, hell even to dad. I’m tired of living in their shadows.”
, having to talk about what’s bothering him. He will, probably, but in his own time, with someone of his own choice.
Tired of his mind making up would-be scenarios and fantasies to cover up the fucked up situation he’s in, Tony grabs a bottle of alcohol from the shelf and goes to his room to drink in peace. It’s not one of his smartest decisions, but at least it gets the job done –he no longer thinks of Steve. Well, he can’t think, period, but those are just unimportant details.
Steve smiles and nods, then hits play and snuggles close to Tony on his bed, where they remain for the rest of the day, well into the evening and even the night. They fall asleep like that, and for the first time in a long time, they both sleep peacefully, no nightmares or restlessness in sight.
He’s surprised. There really isn’t another word to describe it when Tony suddenly turns to Steve with a smile and hugs him after they take care of Doom and his bots. The feeling is nice, Tony’s strong arms wrapped around his shoulders feel right, like they belong there, and Steve wants to hug him back, he really does, but he’s caught off hard and he’s frozen, like a stupid teen with a crush, useless, and so he doesn’t do anything.
The sight of Tony shuffling to the kitchen, obviously in search of food, makes Steve smile. He gets up off the couch and goes after him, watching him prepare a sandwich before Tony finally notices him and turns around. He’s happy to see Tony feeling better, or at least looking better, but he can’t help the anger he feels at Tony relapsing the other night, at himself for not being there for him.
It’s obvious Tony’s been ignoring him, avoiding him. After the hugging incident, Steve thought everything was fine between them, but apparently not. He hasn’t seen the other man in a week if not more, and every time he’s tried to talk to him he was met with a locked door and an apology from JARVIS, saying Tony was busy.
The truth is, Tony adores Steve. From his lips and his eyes, to the curve of his back and his strong arms. From the sense of justice, his annoying humor, the cheekiness, to his infectious optimism and caring nature. It’s impossible for Tony not to love him, to leave him alone, he’s like a moth drawn to a flame.
“Don’t talk,” Steve interrupts and catches Tony’s lips in a heated kiss, knocking the breath out of him. He drags them in the nearest open and empty room, locks it behind them and works on undressing Tony wordlessly. Realizing that this time’s no different than before, Tony pushes down his disappointment and gets lost in Steve’s heated kisses and touches, accepting casual sex is the only thing he’ll ever be worthy of when it comes to Steve Rogers.
Now Steve’s face shifts into a pained expression and isn’t that something to marvel at? Tony ignores it, instead taking a gulp of his drink, draining the glass once more. When he’s about to pour himself another, seeing as Steve still hasn’t taken the proffered drink, the blonde angrily slaps it out of Tony’s hand hard enough that it shatters against the wall.
Tony pulls off almost immediately, a hurt look on his face, and Steve kicks himself but before he can say another word Tony’s off and out of sight. Sam gives him an incredulous look, Natasha scowls and shakes her head, and Steve just runs a gloved hand over his face in frustration, managing to resist the urge to bite it in anger.
Tony gets up and fills up a glass of water, then gulps it all down in one breath. Steve is still looking at him with shock, mouth agape but no words come out. Tony takes it as his chance to get everything off his chest.
Now the silence is deafening, the darkness is blinding and Tony’s heart threatens to break into a million little pieces. Knowing he won’t be able to fall asleep tonight, –he never is when Steve’s in his bed– Tony gets up carefully, picks up a ratty, old t-shirt and a pair of sweats then dashes for the bathroom, getting ready for another sleepless night in the workshop.
The blonde sighs once more then he gets up, gets dressed and leaves Tony’s room undetected. He takes a shower back in his own bathroom, then changes into a pair of sweats, a t-shirt and puts on his running shoes, ready to go for his morning run with Sam. He tries to put Tony off his mind and ignore the pang in his chest, but if Sam’s knowing look is anything to go by, he isn’t very successful at it.
“That’s what I thought,” he nods, then takes his sandwich on a plate and goes up on the roof to eat, wanting to bask in the warmth of the sun and the gentle wind.
He’s almost done with his sandwich when Tony feels another presence in the room and turns around to see Steve looking at him from the doorway with a soft expression. He’s never seen that look directed at him in a while, so Tony accepts it wordlessly, finishing his sandwich and taking a bite.
He doesn’t wait for the others to get in the jet, simply flies over to SHIELD HQ alone as fast as he can, and busies himself with annoying Fury while they wait for the rest of the team to get there for debriefing.
Right when he steps out of the bathroom, the alarm goes off and it’s all Tony can do not to trip over his own feet as he rushes to get dressed while he waits for the armor to come to him and assemble around his body.
The glow of the arc reactor casts a faint light on the ceiling right where Tony’s eyes are staring holes into the panel. The rest of the room is blanketed in darkness, not even the lights of nighttime New York disrupting it due to the darkened windows –courtesy of JARVIS.
He slides down the door until he’s on the ground, resting his back against the hard surface and clutches his knees close to his chest, breathing heavily.
“Lock the doors, Jarv,” Tony says once he steps foot inside, heading for the small kitchen tucked in a corner of the workshop to pour himself a hearty mug of coffee. It’s cold, as it usually is due to the malfunctioning coffee maker, but Tony ignores it and just sips at it. He’s been meaning to take a look at the old thing and see what’s wrong, but as Rhodey joked the other day, he fears he might get ahead of himself and make it sentient or add 30+ new settings to it.
“Tony, I…” Steve trails off, pain written all over him, from his body language to his facial expressions. Tony waits for him to say something, anything, but nothing comes out.
Tony smiles and it reaches his warm, brown eyes, making them crinkle at the corners. “Of course, Steve.”
After a week, Tony opens the door and lets Steve in one hour into his nightly monologue. Tony still doesn’t talk very much, but that’s alright. Steve can work with that.
Steve sighs, turns around until he’s lying on his back and throws his arm over his face, on his forehead as he stares at the ceiling.
The brunet stops and turns around. He almost experiences whiplash when he’s met with a smile, and hope soars in his chest.
The blankets shift with the movement as Steve turns around and stretches in bed. His arm instinctively reaches for Tony, trying to find his warm body even in sleep, but instead cold air hits his exposed arm. He blearily looks up through half lidded eyes and finds the other half of the bed empty.
“You don’t love me, so what?” he bites bitterly,” Big fucking deal. I’ll never tell you how I feel anyway, what’s the use.”
Natasha nodded, then in a swift and fluid motion, pulled something out of a concealed pocket or holster or something—she’d moved too fast for him to track it, but he hadn’t flinched when she moved. (Huh. I guess that’s trust.)
“Huh,” Tony pretended to consider it, stroking his chin, then shrugged. “Sounds terrible. Tell them to suck it.”
“Tony?” Bruce said, drawing his attention from the tensile graphs. “It’s getting late. We should have some lunch.”
Tony squinted at the Security Blanket sketch. (Really it would all come down to making the fabric not only stretchy and flexible enough, but also strong enough it wouldn’t—)
something, like it was special.  He approached Tony’s workbench, taking one hand from behind his back to present a white bag from La Fleur Patisserie.  “I was exploring the city this morning, getting reacquainted with it, and I stumbled across this bakery.  I thought you might like these.”
tell them it may look worse. Like we’re not being above board. Or like we think we have something to be ashamed of—which we don’t.”
Tony considered calling Rhodey or Pepper a few times, but he’d already talked to them and sworn he was just fine; he sort of hated to undo those reassurances, so he stayed in the workshop with AC/DC, Beyonce, and Dummy, insisting he was fine.
“I, uh.  Wow.  Steve, that’s…  Uh, I’m honored.”  (Pull it together, Stark!)  Tony’s heart was pounding hard and frantic in his chest—he wondered distantly if Steve could hear it loud and clear.  Tony took a deep breath.  Then another.  (Come on, stupid.  This was kinda what you expected.  Sort of.)
“No.” Cap said it so seriously. “I wouldn’t.” A pause, then he added with a frown, “You really shouldn’t do that though; the grease is blistering hot.”
“You’re so hard working,” Tony rambled, “Bet you’ll want to practice all the time, won’t you babe?  I’ll have to get you a dildo so you can keep working on it after I come.  I’d never be able to keep up with your . . . ah! . . . enthusiasm and dedication.  Oh fuck!”
That was Tony’s first thought as he drifted up into consciousness. He smiled as he blinked himself awake.
Tony’s eyes went wide. “Oh my God! It’s a girl! You met a girl. And she lives in New York! Am I right? I’m right. I’m right, aren’t I?”
And for the first time since they arrive Tony realize the little that was holding hands with Dan and Anne
They spend the afternoon watching movies. Steve has to change more that ten diapers that day and has two change three times of shirt because of two upsets tummy’s.
“Hay baby” Jane opened her arms picking up Loki giving him kisses all over his face while the boy giggled happily in his moms arms. Thor then when over them kissing  Jane on the lips earning a whine from  Loki causes both Thor and Jane to laugh.
"Daddy says I'm a big boy too. It's just that sometimes I need more help just like Tony." Bucky said.
“Now come on I have to shower, you can continue playing in my room and watching some tv okay” Thor ask
“We are not friends” Bucky said rising a little his voice. “You are weird Daddy told us you have a monster inside you”
The little went over his mom and dad’s room and opening the door he went straight to the bed they have in the room from when Loki wanted to sleep with them but he didn’t saw his teddy. Loki then start looking all over the room after a moment he went to the bathroom and for his surprise his teddy was right there on the on the bathroom floor.
"Come with me, Loki. Let's play!" Bucky said, grabbing Loki's hand and leading him to his play room.
After waiting for around five minutes a knock in the door was heard, Steve was quick to open the door with Tony on his hip while Bucky watch everything from the sofa.
After a couple of minutes Steve returned to his room with Bucky still in his arms and sat down in the bed. He put Bucky between his legs and approach the tit of the bottle to the baby's face who happily take it and start sucking fast.
"Oh I know would you like a warm baba, will get you one after this change" Steve didn't wait for an answer, he applied some cream on Buckys willy before close a new diaper around his waist. He then pick him up and made their way to the kitchen.
Steve was just finished making some sandwiches for dinner, keeping a close eye to Bucky who is in a chair facing a corner in time out while Tony was busy coloring while watching the little mermaid.
Thor came immediately at the sound of his cries, Steve followed him with Tony in his arms. Thor raised a sobbing Loki and wiped away his tears as he put him on the floor and helped him remove his wet pants.
“Oh come on baby today is gonna be a fun day we are going out wouldn’t you like that?” Steve ask, and I’m that moment a very hyper Bucky start jumping in the crib.
The two Little’s were running over all the floor screaming. Steve who was taking a shower didn’t listen to their Little’s  screams.
"Shh, it's okay calm down, Baby. Show Daddy where it hurts." Bucky refused to speak and instead raised his hands to be lifted by his Daddy. Steve complied and walked over to Tony, who still had some tears in his eyes. He lifted Tony and took  both his babies to the sofa where he sat each on one of his legs.
“Be good Baby” Thor said before enter the bathroom, the baby monitor with him to be sure that his baby was well.
“It’s was a pleasure knowing your littles Steve we will arrange another visit some time” Anne took the boy in her arms wiping away his tears.
“Eddie honey Bucky is still to little to understand what you and Venom have. And what you have is something beautiful because you are always gonna have each other your are never gonna be alone. We love you both of you no matter what”
“V are you in there”...nothing...”I juts wanted to say I’m sorry about what I said earlier, I didn’t mean it your not a parasite Daddy told we are unique, I like that word now. I love you V can we be friends again?” Eddie ask playing with his fingers.
“Okay Baby Im gonna change you right away” “Tony do you need a change” Steve ask while also touching Tony’s diaper and in fact he was dry.
thought it would be better to leave Loki without any underwear for the rest of the afternoon. Actually he was going to put some undies but he got caught on making dinner and then Jane arrive and he just forgot about it.
“Tell me about it but at the same time it was also our fault we should have wait for them to settle before leaving them in that way we could have avoided all the troubles” Dan stood next to Eddie’s door knocking softly
"Me daddy" Bucky said, he was the older he should was the one of the idea he should take the punishment first.
“And how’s this little fella doing” Steve said looking over Loki who was falling asleep in his Daddy’s arms.
“Of course no Eddie you and Venom are so unique, I’m pretty sure Bucky wasn’t even thinking he was just scared” Anne tried
“Hey, don’t be like that” Jane said, she then kiss Thor one more time before going after Loki to his room to play
Steve finished changing his baby's diaper before dressing him in a cute red onesie. He then took Tony to the livingroom finding Bucky sucking his thump furiously.
Tentacles appear from behind Eddie and start surrounding Eddie’s body giving him a hug that Eddie respond right away. They stood there for a couple of minutes until they both heard Anne calling for them to get in the bath.
Bucky was a bit confused, he did not like being woken up so roughly. He soon started crying and calling his daddy. Worried, Loki got scared and started to cry too. Both Thor and Steve rushed to the room and tried to calm the upset babies.
Bucky went over his daddy's lap, before feeling his diaper being lowered exposing his little bottom.
She was about to do so when she heard a click and then the door opening slowly, a tired looking Eddie emerging from it.
“He’s doing well, we had kind of a problem yesterday when he ate a little to much and believe those diapers smell like hell”
Tony stand up and when crawling towards his daddy who was setting Bucky in one of  the two seats it was a double pushchair.
The morning in the tower start like any other. Steve was asleep in his room without a care of the world. That until the baby monitor came to life with the stressful cries of two well awake babies who demanded attention.
“Okay boys is almost bed time what you wanna do?” Steve ask the two babies who were sitting in the room with toys around them.
While Steve was talking with Thor he heard through the baby monitors that his two boys were up. He went running to his room only to find his two babies making grabby hands for his Daddy.
Steve finish Tony change and places the baby in the playpen inside the room. He then took Bucky how was desperate crawling for his dad.
Steve took Tony into the room where Bucky had already started entertaining himself alone. All his blocks scattered the floor while he destroyed his towers. Tony made his hands toward the blocks and Steve slowly put him on the floor where he immediately starts crawling towards them. But before his grabby hands reached the toys he was stopped by Bucky.
"Okay, try to calm down, Baby. Everything is fine. I apologize for this, Steve." Thor said while rubbing the top of Loki's dark hair.
Thor could heart them from the kitchen with a smile on his face, he was happy his family was all together. After a while he went upstairs to call Jane and Loki and opening the door slowly he made his way in.
-It was Tony he is mean and I’m not gonna talk to him again- Bucky said before more tears start going down his cheeks.
Once the tree Little’s were clean. And Phil came back with Clint’s clothes, they start dressing the boys.
Eddie just looked down at his dinner not making a move to eat, while Anne and Dan just looking at each other not knowing what to say.
Immediately the room went silenced, Tony sat down on his crib sucking his dummy and playing with his stuffies.
Once the bath was done he carries both  babies to the changing table were he change them in some thick nappies and some cozy pajamas. And after a bottle and a good bedtime story all of them were fully pass out.
Thor and Loki were having a relaxing day. The two of them were watching movies. Well more like Thor was watching the movies while Loki play with the toys around him. In one moment Thor turn off the TV
Steve was on the couch watching some Bored documental when he heard the door being knocked. He signed and start going over the door.
-Is you brother still sleeping?- Steve ask referring to a sleepy Bucky In the sofa. Also only in his nappy.
Today was a rainy day, and the only thing that meant was that the little family would be stuck inside the tower. For Bucky it meant that his baby brother would be asleep for most of the day.
Steve really hoped that in Anne’s and Dan next visit thing would go smoothly. And also he hoped for the rest of littles to show up. They didn’t this time after Steve inform all the parents about the situation and They all agreed that was better if they didn’t come and reschedule for another day.
Thor picks up the two babies. He first change Tony about of that wet nappy and then do the same with Bucky.  He then take the Little’s to the playroom. to then take loki to the potty and then bring it back to the playroom.
Bucky who was the one being chased didn’t saw the door in front of him and a big knock of Bucky’s face hitting the door was heard.
-haha you’re right you'll be fine I'll be back at night call me if you have any problems. Bye baby- Bruce said kissing Tony cheek to then leave
“Why don’t we let them play a little so when the others arrive they can get along more easier” Steve suggest. Anne and Dan nodded in agreement.
sometimes babies get sick of their little tummies, but daddy always knows  what's best for their babies
Steve put Tony in the changing table, changing his nappy that was just wet and then putting clothes on the boy. Both boys have the same shoes and pants but the t-shirts were different. Bucky’s was blue and Tony’s was green.
A loud scream was heard, Steve emerged from the bathroom In some jeans and a shirt, his hair still damp.
-good morning my babies how are you ?- said Steve entering the nursery with a smile on his face but it seems that neither Bucky or Tony were in the mood this morning.
"Wook Tony, put this one here."  Bucky said happily. They were building a big block tower. "Yeah, very good." He encouraged with a smile.
"Oh, don't worry about it. I already wanted to wake him up anyway." Steve looked down to Bucky, patting his shoulder gently. "Hey buddy, you're okay. Look, it's Loki. He just wanted to play
-looking forward to see you, They hope you feel better soon so they can give you cuddles- Bruce said
Rember you can always comment what would you like to see and if you see any mistakes please tell me!
-Wait a minute baby, I’m just gonna change you’re brother. Both of you are a little a smelly don’t you think-
At the end, the three of them fell asleep looking at the film enjoying her company and mutual warmth.
Today was a rare day, both Tony and Bucky has woken up in a more bigger headspace. Bucky was eight and Tony was seven. very close ages.
-I’m gonna put you in your crib, after I give Bucky his bath a warm bottle would be waiting for you and your brother-
They enjoy the company for a while until the babies start demanding food, they all eat some pasta Steve made and after dinner Jane Thor and Loki went home.
“Yeah I understand at least Peter already knows him that makes things a little bit better” Steve smile “Still Thank you for coming I hope we can do this in other occasion. Bucky please apologize an said goodbye it’s been a long 30 minutes”
The baths were individual because the two boys didn’t want to be together. Meals were pass in silence. And each baby playwith his own toys not even looking at themselves.
Steve first went to Bucky crib to see the baby deep asleep, with a pacifier in his mouth drooling a little, all his hair messed up and a teddy bear in his left hand. In Steve opinion was a beautiful thing to see.  It's a shame he had to wake him up, they always look so peaceful when they were asleep.
“Oh wonderful I’m starving” Jane said placing the dinosaurs on the floor picking up Loki and going over Thor who kiss Loki’s head. The three made their way downstairs and sat on the table. They put Loki on a normal chair. He still wasn’t completely in his headspace. In front of him a sippy cup full of apple juice.
“Baby don’t do that you can get hurt and Maybe is because all the rash cream I put on you don’t worry it will pass” Jane kiss Loki’s cheek and pick up the boy tickling his tummy making the younger one laugh.
They enter to the nursery and Tony went directly to his teddies. But when he was grabbing his teddy he saw something moving inside one of the cribs.
Today unfortunately Loki has woke up in a older headspace (12 year old) and at that age he gets more complicated to control, always making a fuss and some times clingy to Jane and Thor.
-I hope Steve recovers and of course, Loki would be happy to spend some time with the Little’s. we'll be there in an hour- Thor Answered
He put him in a nappy also getting sure about the rash cream and in some white pajamas with stars all over it. And a red dummy in his mouth. He then put Bucky in the same crib as tony. Both babies were surprised.
-Okay so they already eat lunch so they probably won’t be hungry until later, his bottles are in the fridge and Steve is asleep in the room next to Tony and Bucky nursery. Make sure to change them and...- Bruce was cute by Thor
"Daddy stop I don't want!" Tony was crying hard and Steve had to stop too give his baby a moment to calm down
"Maybe you don't want to go play with Bucky..." Steve said as he got up and walked towards the door.
the sun had already been hidden and Phil was ready with Clint in his shoulder half asleep. The tree kids play for a while until Clint start rubbing his eyes to much.
Little’s were normal, all the persons knew about them, is just sometimes the crying of two Little’s could get a little annoying and Steve knew it.
“He is, Guys say Hi” Dan said picking up Eddie on his hip, but Eddie was quick to hide in Dan’s neck.
-No Tony I’m not, I’m really sorry I blame you for what happened, it wasn’t your fault was that stupid door-
"I'm not gonna talk about this now, please let's go to bed will discuss this in the morning come on off to bed" steve said picking up Tony checking his diaper to find it clean at least.
"No more bottles at night for you baby" steve cleaned his baby's privates before putting some powder and put a new nappy on. "And you are ready, go wait for me at the livingroom not running"
-That’s what I thought. How about I make some warm bottles for you two. Okay then wait here in the sofa watch some TV and I will back in no time-
After the two angels were asleep, Steve went to his room to rest. Tony and Bucky wanting to sleep in the same crib. Grabbing each other hands.
After some minutes the alarm went off, indicating that it was time for the spanking. Steve went over the boys.
Bucky of course grew anxious about his dad hearing his brother so he was quick to go over Tony and put his hand over his mouth making the younger one scream even louder.
"I forgot to bring extra undergarments for Loki." Thor explained, rubbing at the back of his head, wondering what he should do.
Loki and Bucky happily continued playing. Quickly the pressure on Loki's bladder got worse and he wanted to call for his daddy. But as he stood to go he felt like his pants were dampening without his control. Loki felt his eyes fill up with tears. Months had passed since his last accident, and now he was uncomfortable in his wet pants
"Buddy, I already told you no, it's raining and I don't want you to get sick." Steve said placing Bucky in his lap on the couch.
“Loki that’s something you shouldn’t be doing you could have gotten hurt” Jane exclaim going over to Loki helping him getting out of the bed.
"Bucky wait daddy here baby I'll be back quick and we can have breakfast, I'll just go change your stinky brother" To hear that Bucky just laughing before he became distracted by the toys around him.
Once there Jane sit Loki on the toilet, he wee a little before Jane clean him up putting some rash cream all over his bits, bum and between his genitals. Then she put the blue with clouds undies.
Jane then smile and start unbuttoned Loki’s pants then she pull down his boxers and Loki just look away.
Steve ran his hands through Bucky's hair whispering things in his ear until his baby fall asleep again, his pacifier happily in his mouth.
-Thanks boys love you too- Steve give each baby a kiss in their forehead. And also those two warm bottles.
-And I don’t want Bucky and Tony to be mad At each other, you are brothers you should love each other-
“Okay boys go and have some fun but remember don’t go to far” Steve said letting Tony and Bucky have some fun, while he just sit in one of the chairs and look at his babies running and laughing about silly things.
The three adults when to the living room to chat about “Adult Stuff” while Loki was sitting in the kitchen table.
then he put them in front of the TV with the bottles while he went to pack a bag with all the things they babies would need.
“Bye bye Eddie I liked your friend is so cool” Steve smile down at his boy full of proud he wished Bucky was the same.
Steve enter the nursery with a smile on his face, happy to expend the day with his two Little’s. They were going to have so much fun. But first he needed to wake up his babies.
“I know baby, and I know this can be a little confused for you and Tony but what you said today really made Eddie really sad.
Steve took Bucky to the nursery only to see Tony already up standing in his crib babbling to himself, he immediately start screaming when he saw his daddy and brother.
Clint happily take his clothes out and enter the tub with his cousins. The tree of them were having the time of their lives. While Steve was cleaning all the red sauce of their faces.
Once Thor arrive he was relive Loki was on his headspace, he missed his baby boy. The three of them made his way over Thor and Jane room with Loki on jane’s arms.
“Don’t be silly you know your undies are not itchy” Jane went over Loki’s closet and put out a pair of underwear and the rash cream
He put both boys in their high chairs and went to the kitchen to start breakfast. He made some pancakes and orange juice. He put a plate in front of each boys.
“Shh come on boys why are we so moody today” Steve start rocking both babies as they continue crying both firmly clutched tightly Steve's shirt.
“Is okay don’t worry” Jake smile kissing Thor’s libs, Thor then look at Loki who was looking at them with his mouth full of nuggets and broccoli
A smile showed up in steve face. He missed his babies so much but he was sick and a little week to get out of bed. Thanks to the serum he would be able to recover soon but until that he had to rest.
And when Steve saw the two bottles were empty and the two babies sleep. He change the two bottles for two pacifiers and kiss each baby on the head before going to his own room and fall sleep in the moment his head touch the pillow.
It wasn’t a lie. Yesterday Bucky had told Steve that he feel bad for saying that was  Tonys fault. Bucky knee he hit himself with the door. He was just to ashamed to admit the truth. That and also the fact that he thought Tony hate him now.
Steve proceeded to remove Tony's diaper, and seeing the gift that Tony had left for Steve understood why his baby's crying and displeasure. He was sick of his little tummy.
After Anne Dan Eddie and Venom went, Steve took his boys to their nursery and have a long talked about Eddie and his friend. Tony was okay with the situation but with Bucky was a little different he still didn’t understand, he thought Eddies Friend was a monster and that made it a bad thing. it was clearly that when on the first mission they meet Eddie Bucky didn’t realize that the suit he boy was wearing wasn’t a suit at all.
Tony just nodded as he let his daddy clean it. Once the change was over, Steve reloaded Tony in his arms.
"In sorry daddy no spanking please" Tony wailed running towards Steve making grabbing hands to be lifted up
The tree Little’s ended playing the rest of the afternoon without more inconveniences. And while Thor feed the babies with the warm bottles while Loki nap next to him Bruce arrive. And after he checked on Steve the kids says there good byes.
“She told me she is on his way don’t worry” Thor smile at his brother for then continue preparing dinner. Some chicken nuggets for Loki and spaghetti for Jane and Thor.
“Okay baby wait here remember the cream the doctor give us for This things, I’m going to bring it” Thor went to were the cream was and then he put some on Loki’s genitals.
“Yes Daddy” Bucky said still a little tired putting his thumb in his mouth after his pacifier fell in his crib.
The two brothers start searching all over the floor. When they decided Loki wasn’t in the same floor they decided to use the elevator to go to other floors. without permission from Thor.
-Tony put your toys away is bath time- Steve said to Tony who was in front of the Tv, a movie playing while he played with his toys.
“Why don’t you go play with you vídeo games” Jane and Thor had toys for both of Loki’s headspace so he doesn’t get bored no matter what age.
Loki sucked on his bottle happily while playing with his mom’s hair. “Such a beautiful baby” Jane said giving Loki a small kiss on his little nose
-Bucky told me he wasn’t talking to you because he think you are still mad at him. Maybe if you tell him you are not mad he would be okay- Steve tried
“Eddie! Venom! Dinner is ready” Anne called she was thinking maybe it was time to literally forced the door open.
“They are taking a nap, they are a little cranky so I hope now that they are napping they moods would change” Steve said he then look over Loki who was looking a video in Jane’s phone. He seemed to be in an older headspace but he would ask later.
Steve then got and idea, he put the two babies in the big crib he uses when tony wanted to sleep with Bucky and vice versa. The two babies start crying stronger with big fat tears going down their cheeks.
"Hey Little guy whats the matter" Steve ask as he held Bucky in his arms as they headed into the room where both boys were playing with blocks
"Boys enough, both of you know better than to fight and get out of your cribs I'm really disappointed at both for breaking the rules"
Steve sighed and saw the clock, it was barely seven o'clock in the morning, so Steve found it unusual for Tony to be awake, when normally Tony gets up at nine in the morning just like Bucky.
Steve led Tony to the bathroom where he quickly stripped him of his clothes, leaving him alone in his diaper while he prepared the tub. When it was at a good temperature he removed Tony's diaper and placed him inside. He put some toys in the tub, hopefully so Tony could get distracted. Steve started first with his hair while Tony was hypnotized by a yellow duck that made noises when squeezed.
And just with those words both babies stop crying, and magically a smile appears on their faces. They could be like that some times but Steve love them the same and some times even more.
Steve made quick work of the job, removing the wet nappy and wiping his bum with ease. He finished by applying some cream and dressing him in a new nappy.
Anne and Dan watching happily from the bedroom door. They both looked so cute. They definitely had the best boys.
"Hey, do not cry Baby, it's all good. I know you want to play with Bucky. I'll bathe you quickly and you can go play with him. He's waiting for you in the living room." Steve always bathed Tony and Bucky separately, it was easier. While Tony was hiding he quickly bathed Bucky and then went to look for his other baby.
Steve finished bathing Tony and wrapped him in a light blue towel, taking him to the nursery. There he changed him, first dressing him in his diaper and pajamas, then putting a pacifier into Tony's lips. He started sucking happily, smiling at the comfort. Steve held him in his arms and took him to the living room where Bucky was patiently waiting for them.
Tony smiled as he toweled his hair dry. No wonder Rhodey and Cap got along so well—they obviously had a lot in common: neither of them could shrug off shit they read on the internet. Rhodey’d go batshit and hit the shooting range. (Pepper’s outrage in contrast was a brief and quiet affair; she was far too efficient and restrained to waste time and energy on trolls.) It had been the worst during the Hanson trial. Tony tried to push the memories away. The death threats, rape threats—some of them amazingly lurid in their detail.
(“You’re so nice and tight, baby.  Yeah, fuck back on my cock.  Are you getting this, Henry?  Yeah, do a close up. Christ he’s gorgeous taking two dicks.”)
Steve’s hips rolled against his, not enough to satisfy, only pushing Tony’s desire higher and higher. He kissed Steve urgently and time slid by.
As everyone began drinking coffee and starting breakfast, Tony bade a fond farewell to enticing Steve back to bed. Tony accepted a bagel with cream cheese and tried not to pout as conversation turned to their training program for the day.
I was going to muck it up!  Walking on eggshells, terrified I’d do something awful that I couldn’t even understand, couldn’t anticipate, because I’m all wrong here--two left feet and five thumbs-- and then you throw it all in my face and now say it’s nothing!  How can you--”
“Oh, yeah, I’m not that good with kids,” Tony rambled awkwardly, “and this is kind of Steve’s special place, since his best friend grew up here. It was his idea and he’s the one who went out and selected all their presents and wrapped them himself—well, I mean, I tried to help, but it turns out I really su--,er,
“I’d have thought you’d like them,” Clint said to Tony with a puzzled look, then added after a moment’s hesitation, “Uhura and Sulu both get more screen time. And Sulu actually saves Kirk and Spock!”
“Put us in lockdown, J” Tony said. “I need to focus on finishing Cap’s suit, then getting Widow and Hawk up to speed. No time to lose. They’re being cleared for duty soon.”
Tony buttoned his shirt up all the way. He checked his phone, half expecting it to blare the Avengers Assemble or to be bursting with urgent R&D disaster emails from Pepper. There was nothing. Just his wallpaper: a photo of him with Pep and Rhodey squeezed into the frame, grinning like fools.
Steve leaned down for a kiss then took Tony’s other wrist and wrapped it carefully, meticulously with the soft thick rope.
“Nothing!  Well, okay, maybe not nothing.  But it’s not bad.  I’ll tell you about it over lunch sometime.  Anyhow, can’t I just show my appreciation for you?”
“Not at all! Totally understand,” Tony said, shaking his head emphatically. “Don’t even think of it. And, hey, look! Data’s all up on your tablet.”
“But since I have too much property already and I’m not gonna knock you up . . . ” Tony added with a grin.  He shrugged, “I think you should define it however you like.  What we already did could count.  Or you could hang on to the v-word until you’ve tried everything that interests you on the spreadsheet I made for you.”
Tony fell silent as Steve came tumbling into the lab, wild-eyed and breathing heavily.  He froze when he saw Tony—then hovered, panting in the doorway with
It pretended to be an unscripted reality show, but it was as choreographed as a B-film and half as good.  “Expert” Doms taught eager would be suitors how to woo bratty, feisty subs and force them to submit.  It was all totally fake, but it made his stomach roil all the same.  Master Marcus, the show's beefy host, held Tony up as the quintessential brat and boasted that, if Tony had the guts to come on the show, he'd be on his knees eating out of Marcus' hand in no time.  (Tony had talked to legal a few times about getting a gag order on that, but the legal precedents weren't in Tony's favor. It would have caused a huge PR backlash anyway.)
Tony was mid-sentence when the spectrometer began blinking and JARVIS cut in: “Sir? The energy levels are spiking.”
“Like this?” Tony breathed.  He slid his slick fingers down a little, caressing lightly between Steve’s cheeks, rubbing gently at his hole.  Steve jerked involuntarily at the touch and let out a little gasp, then nodded again.  His hips jerked again.
“I—“ Steve swallowed and took a breath, then mumbled hotly against Tony’s neck. “You’re so precious to me. You know that, right? So dear. I’d never—never—” His fingers clutched at Tony’s arm.
Steve swallowed and turned a little to look at the bike and run his fingers across the smooth leather seat. He turned back to Tony with a boyish grin: “You said something about taking her for a spin?”
Pepper was great. The very best. She didn’t press him for details--though he could tell she was tempted--but (tough talk aside) let him get away with a vague, “I went off book in a training exercise when I shouldn’t have and now Bruce is angry with me. So I’m giving him space.”
Tony shook his head. “I’m useless in the kitchen—if it were up to me I’d serve it half-raw or set the damn thing on fire.” (Of course, it would have been easy to hire caterers who’d have done it perfectly, but Tony was too nice to say that.) Tony shrugged. “I’m sure it will be fine.”
This might take longer than he’d been expecting.  Steve decided to do the easy part first.  He needed to put a note next to the first entry.  The stylus hovered over the glowing screen and Steve blushed.  He felt like a naughty schoolboy passing Tony a filthy note.  Or whispering dirty secrets in his ear, even though Tony wasn’t there to hear it and no sound was coming out.  After a moment’s hesitation, Steve clicked, dragged, and began to write next to ‘anal sex’:
Bruce glanced around the workshop--at Tony’s mostly bare bench and lack of screens--then gave a little shrug.  “I just thought I’d come see if you’d like some help. Are you working on the partial data again or -- ?” He nodded to Tony’s screwdriver.
Okay, maybe Katie was related to Natasha, because Tony heard the “you’d better have a moment” loud and clear through her professional tone.
(Tony made a mental note to see if JARVIS could find him a salvageable Norton Dominator anyway. There probably wouldn’t be any in working order, but maybe the body . . . He could do the rest.)
“No!” Tony protested. He waved his arms and knocked a screwdriver to the floor with a clatter. Tony scrambled awkwardly to retrieve it as Rhodey walked around the workbench to stand where he could see Tony’s expression more clearly.
Bucky was happy playing with some other Little’s while Tony was catching some bugs. It was cute to see.
Tony nodded and turned to the formation diagram.  “You’d group them in teams of three?”  Tony said tapping the paper.
“Nothing!”  Tony said, hands held up in surrender.  “Just, I thought only subs took Home Ec in the ‘30s.”
Steve’s breath hitched.  Maybe the roses meant Tony had something special in mind for tonight?  (Oh God!) It was warm in the room, but Steve shivered.  Maybe Tony was finally planning to fuck him?  His cock grew hard; he squirmed and adjusted himself in his trousers.  Steve’s thoughts were racing, barely lighting on one fantasy before whisking away to the next, but always Tony—inside him, above him, pinning him down.
