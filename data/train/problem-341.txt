"I'll be a modest bride, I promise. Just champagne and lilies of the valley for me; can even borrow a dress from Klinger. Pity we aren't the same shoe size, you'd like me in heels I think."
this, and by god what a feeling that was. Gingerly, he rolled upright and then sat on his bottom groaning as the plug rolled over his prostate. He was going to have to deal with his erection or possibly embarrass himself at dinner.
“Yes, I am very hard and very wanting; and it’s because of you.” John kissed at his fingers again before raising Sherlock’s hands to lay them above his head. “Hands here, alright? Just for now.”
“Beautiful... this is... if it’s too much-” John was growing thick, but not hard, against him. His cock lazily aroused but still seated against Sherlock’s still mostly flaccid but twitching cock. “Want to take care of you.”
The hot breath gave way to teeth just- there on his shoulder. He couldn't immediately recall the word. Nape... John was against Sherlock’s skin; it didn’t matter where because it was glorious. Sherlock felt his toes curl as he cried out then whimpered against the pillowcase, his face hot. Slightly wet. He was... misty. John pumped him fully then, fucking him in his earnest slow slide. Growling lowly. He let go of Sherlock’s spent cock to grip hard at his hip and keep at him until he orgasmed; spilling deep within Sherlock in stuttering waves.
“I’m. Not. Embarrassed.” He bit out as John’s hand moved to the middle of his back. “I had... have... a gift for you too-”
I closed my eyes and inhaled slowly through my nose, allowing the hint of his cologne to invade my senses for better remembering later.
“Dinner with someone you are interested with, compounded by the fact that they are not only younger than you, but that they are as mutually attracted to you, and against their own logic enamored is both amusing and ‘sweet’. The fact that I have little experience in the realm of the bedroom has also added a small amount of scintillation. ‘Deflowering’ and wooing me... I cannot say that I am impervious to your methods, John, nor do I wish to be.”
Sherlock felt soothed by the mild command even as his nerves jangled about making him a bit light headed. His stomach swooped at the praise that John was pouring over him, the words themselves kind. The meaning behind them, the feelings, unmistakable. He nodded and stood slowly, kissed John’s cheek then left to claim their coats. The thought of John having him further, of him riding the doctor’s cock, making him orgasm; just the fantasy made him hard all over again. Sherlock quickly tamped down on
“Oh, okay.” John would take that at face value for now. “But why hide your physiology at all? Sherlock, that is dangerous. Especially here on campus with so many different- look, I’m not going to out you, but at least tell me your records state that you are Vulcan.”
Could be due to the darkened setting of his room, the intimacy of the of the night always seemed to change people. Could be that John didn’t want to wake him, worried he might lose the ability to continue the gesture of their tangled fingers. Sherlock just pressed into that touch and reaffirmed the place of his fingers by squeezing them more tightly together before relaxing again.
Sally made me aware of another event looming on the horizon — she called the first Tuesday of March to ask if she should to invite Philip to the spring dance. "Are you sure you don't mind... I thought he might ask you because he really is an idiot when it comes to trying to make up for that shit he pulled; a dicks before chicks thing. Solidarity. Especially since Holmes has become his own frigid self again." she persisted when I told her I didn't mind in the least. "Still a dick thing, John. I thought, maybe, he had a heart."
She moved confidently about the room, settling on the chair closest to the corner and picked up what looked to be some wool yarn and knitting that had been stopped mid-progress. Sherlock couldn’t help but to try and focus his eyes, but it was making his head hurt so much more that he finally closed his eyes and let his neck relax so his head could be nestled against the pillow once again. He’d be able to figure it all out once he woke up properly soon enough.
When we got to the house, Greg finally spoke. "Um... you'll need to call Ella." He hung his head, guilty.
I decided to permit myself one glance at the table. If he was glaring at me, I would skip and try to see him after, before rugby. Maybe skip part of that, too, if it meant we could iron out whatever had happened. It was early days at this school. I might be able to get away with excusing my absence the next day claiming illness. Everyone would back me up, especially Mike, as concerned as he was. I must look miserable. I kept my head down and glanced up under my lashes. None of them were looking this way. I lifted my head a little.
Sherlock could not refute it; as much as it rankled him, Geraldine was correct. “That transparent are we?”
I looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up along the sidewalk and swirling erratically past my face.
“Don’t pine over the two-timing ex-wife, Major... forget her. There are millions of women out there.”
He could feel the warmth stoked to a flame within him. “I want you, sir. Want to be indelibly marked. Yours.” Sherlock raised his eyes to the glass and was shocked at the picture they made. Him, properly pinked, eyes glassy with want, lower lip dark from biting; John full of mirth and echoing the need in a much crisper way Sherlock felt so deeply. “I wanted to be somewhat open for you, to make the process easier on us both.”
"There’s no reason to cover here, John.” Sherlock once again held his gaze, the almost concern was certainly there. “Not with me.”
Sherlock moved slowly, feeling over full and tugged on but blissfully hazy. The plug made walking difficult because he felt so open; exposed. It felt like ages to get to the door and finally open it, and was quite surprised that he was met with a courier in his doorway holding a package obviously meant for him. Interesting. He signed for the thin black wrapped box and then closed the door before opening it on the spot.
He could feel his testicles settling not quite right and a dull ache start up in his thigh and he moaned in frustration.
to force the issue knowing that my family will move to have us married sooner. In reality, it will only assure my releasing her as I had wished to do before I came here for good."
“That. Was brilliant; really brilliant.” The doctor licked at his lips as his eyes brightened. “I am floored.”
“Sherlock, you’re my bunk mate. My friend, too. I hope.” This was hedging towards areas that made John’s pulse quicken just a bit. No, they were friends. No matter the bandy feeling that was currently tying him into a very pretty knot internally. “So, um, your... ears?”
Greg put one arm behind my back, in a half hug."If it's true that he had something to do with saving you, he's more than welcome at our house. Sherlock, you okay to drive?"
"Yes, and also has a fiance back home, ta. Name is David. They're to get married her next leave. It wouldn't be what I want. Bit of a romp, yeah, but then, well, I just wouldn't feel right. I'll set my sights on someone else, thank you very much." He poured them both another drink and sat on his bunk kicking his legs up onto the bed and crossing them at the ankle. "God, let's call it a night while we can. Introspection later. Means we've not enough alcohol and too little sleep, this talk."
"If John has said yes, then of course. We aren't Victorians and you aren't in danger around here, not with your dad being who he is and me being the D.I. round these parts."
They wheeled me away then, to get scans of my head and leg to make sure I hadn’t re-injured it. I told them there was nothing wrong, and I was almost right. I did have a concussion, but the leg was only scar tissue that was aggravated. I was trapped in the ER, waiting, harassed by Philip’s promises to make it up to me as they stitched the wound on the back of my head. He kept up a remorseful mumbling until I told him to be happy we were both still breathing. That and that Sally might have taking a fancy to him.
“Hush, darling, I’ve got you.” John brushed his beard lightly over Sherlock’s chest before nipping gently at a hardened nipple. “You are gorgeous, Sherlock.” He nuzzled his way slowly down Sherlock’s torso, obviously distracting Sherlock from him undoing his trousers until he wetly kissed a now exposed hip as the material had ridden low. “May I, love?”
“You’re welcome.” He sipped at the coffee wincing. God he needed to switch back to tea. This grind was utter shit. Bitter. This payday he’d do it. As he finished his coffee, he switched on the wall mounted telly to keep the cat company. “Don’t watch all day, yea? It’ll rot that pretty little head of yours.” He scratched between her ears then moved to leave, opening the door, a quiet sush of mechanical levers opening the portal to the hall beyond.
It was a relief to leave. I walked hastily to the mini, put in my earbuds and kept my eyes straight ahead, ignoring the looks I was getting from my friends. I hadn't noticed Mary sidling up beside me until I felt my right earbud pup out of my ear.
“Yes, just like this, darling.” John held him close, his front to Sherlock’s back. “In a moment, I’m going to have you kneel up, and I’m going to lower myself some.” His hands generously skated along Sherlock’s chest as he spoke. “I’m going to kiss you, spread you open with my mouth. My tongue. Would you like that, love? Nothing too rough, I don’t wish to overuse your body. Make you sore.”
“Oh, fighting for him now, are we?” John quipped back, the tight smile across his lips just this side of too calm. “Letting him see you fired up this way for your little tête-à-tête later? This putting wind in your sails, Philip? Come on, Holmes, let's get you properly settled-”
It was the same nurse, dressed as before. With his vision mostly back to normal he could see that she was indeed young
Philip Anderson, resident buffoon, Holmes’ mind supplied. Small snippets about the man shimmered around him quickly in lightning fast deductions. Married, no children. Posh himself, but also spoilt by parents. Only child. Middling surgeon, rushes to prove himself. Inferiority complex, covers with general smarmy attitude. Currently having an affair with nurse to his left.
hooded cock was thick even relaxed. It lay softly over his testicles, the curled thatch of crimson to ebon hair wasn’t even remarkable next to such a specimen.  Beautiful. There was not another word capable of describing him. Supple clear skin, uninterrupted in its perfection.
“Sherlock, my boy, sex is so many things.” John’s fingers ran lazily along his back in a soothing pattern. “Now sleep. We’ll talk in the morning.”
My skin felt cooled where his fingers rested against my jaw, the tingle of it pleasant. The kiss was soft and chaste, and I couldn't help but to hope that when I truly kissed him, that this was how it wouId feel. I felt shocked that it was already a foregone conclusion. Sherlock laughed quietly and I swore I heard him whisper for me to sleep, but wasn't I already?
John made quick work of Sherlock’s clothing as well, throwing them in the same general direction before kneeling on the bed and running his hands, open palmed, along Sherlock’s body from shoulders to hips, to thighs, to knees. It was relaxing and nerve-wracking all in one. His body undulated with the touch as if it couldn’t stand to be parted with John’s hands. Maybe it was so.
I turned my head sharply away from him, clenching my jaw against all the hurtful things that came to mind. "You could have."
His hands locked tighter as Sherlock pulled me within millimeters of him, our bodies pressed almost everywhere. My heart couldn't help itself as it raced along ignorant to the discussion we were currently having. When he looked at me, his eyes were near black, only an icy halo remaining.
John had just logged off the comm with his parents as Sherlock entered their rooms, multiple PADDs in hand. Seemed as if it had been a productive day for him, even his lips seemed to be slightly curled in a smile. It had taken a while for the two of them to not be cagey around one another, whatever it was always seemed to hover between and around them like an elastic band. It wasn’t uncomfortable, just odd. John’s mom had even mentioned if he’d found someone special to share his time with, but he’d replied honestly with a no. It had only been him and Sherlock and his study group because they were on an insanely tight schedule up to the upcoming holiday. She’d just given him a soft smile, his father just barked a laugh in the background and muttered something about not far from the tree.
"The glass. It shattering, specifically," Sherlock shared a look with his father. "Or, it's what my father suspects."
Sherlock bit at his lip, swallowing a moan. He was just this side of embarrassed. Maybe a little swimmy in his stomach from emotions he had yet to name. It was- it was
"I didn't have any trouble with it," I said, stung by his assumption. "I've done the lab before, though," I added before he could get his feelings hurt.
Greg fixed me with a firm stare but must have decided to let it go. "Alright, up you get. Sherlock, you got him, he's at least a stone heavier than you."
I couldn’t help but to smile, Greg had been very good to me since I’d been here. I knew it was something like that. Thinking of him making a fuss about me made me smile a little. It was different to be, well, cared for. Thankfully, Mr Gregson started class at that moment. Better than embarrassing myself, I tried to concentrate as he explained the lab we would be doing today. The slides in the box were out of order. Working as lab partners, we had to separate the slides of and label them accordingly. In twenty minutes, he would be coming around to see who had it right.
The words washed over him and went straight to his belly, feeding the heat and the butterflies that had been drawn to it. “Sir.”
“Are you allowed- I mean, I would understand if it was something only Vulcans learned but, it was so beautiful. Deadly too I bet.”
Our lips met, my mouth pressing to his, our breath mingling. It was absolutely everything I expected and nothing like it at all. As our chests brushed together I grabbed his shoulder to steady myself on my toes, then found that wasn't necessary as his hands were firmly at my hips holding me perfectly steady. The growl that came from him was shocking, but the kiss remained sweet. Chaste. Sherlock's hands gripped harder causing a whimper over the slight pain of denim biting into my hip. I was suddenly reminded of The Princess Bride and perfect kisses and if this didn't rate close to Buttercup and Wesley I would be severely put out.
No one seemed concerned about Sherlock, though I explained over and over that he was the hero, he had saved my life after all and risked his own; had nearly been crushed, too. Everyone else always commented that they hadn't even seen him there till the van was pulled away. Sherlock was never surrounded by well wishers or the curious. People avoided him as usual. The Holmes and the Wigging sat at the same table as always, talking only among themselves. None of them, especially Sherlock, glanced my way anymore. It stung at first, but I felt that it was mostly due to his siblings- cousins- family.
"I'm fine, really. Really. Just- thank you." I looked to Sherlock, who was still holding me close, but now in a more supported sitting position. "I've got it, just startled. See?"
Philip interrupted us then; he was planning an epic battle of the blizzard in the parking lot after school and wanted us to join. Sally agreed enthusiastically, baring her teeth and hitting him on his arm. The way Molly looked at Mike left little doubt that she would be up for anything he suggested. It was on. For the rest of the lunch hour, I very carefully kept my eyes at my own table. I tried to chat with Mary about the upcoming theatre performance she was in. Glared at Mike with false-gruffness when he tried to goad me into the slush-fest later now that I was looking better.
“Yes, I do know that it is, and no I am quite firmly in the male category both mentally as well as physically; though I do have to thank you for being... supportive of what you believed my proclivities to lie.”
After retrieving my cane from somewhere; his jaw suddenly clenched. "Your father is waiting for you," Sherlock looked almost uncertain as he offered the wheelchair.
"Incoming!" Molly had stood and downed her coffee mere seconds before the actual sound of the helicopters could be heard. She briskly left the mess hall and bee lined towards the communications office.
"There's a lad, come on then." He chuckled quietly, a warm amused sound that Sherlock wanted to hear more of. His hands pulled and help settle them into place. "If you could only see yourself. Next time, we'll move the mirror so you can watch."
"There's nothing wrong with me at all, but a little concussion," I complained. "Minor aggravation of previous injury. Had worse in rugby." I had a feeling he already knew all of this.
When I opened my eyes in the morning, something was different. It was the light. I jumped up to look outside, and then groaned as I took in the whitened the road. But that wasn't the worst part. All the rain from yesterday had frozen solid making the driveway a deadly ice slick, all glimmering and terrifying. I had enough trouble not falling down since my injury; I would have to be careful today.
“Oh, thank god.” The exhale and catch of breath was loud in the quiet room. “I was so worried, the chances of you... I’m glad you’re back. All the way.”
“What have you done?” John’s voice was right against his ear, soft but urgent. “If you- you need to tell me, Sherlock.”
"Oh," I mumbled. Honestly, if I were him the non sequitur would have thrown me as well. "I just, you said something about circulation issues? I mean, I'm glad you're better."
“I didn’t mind your fingers touching, it’s that-” God, I could not sound more like an idiot. “well, you must have scuffed your shoes along or something. Got a shock. I’m not-” I glanced up, and he was staring at me, that same inexplicable look of frustration in his eyes. Suddenly I identified that subtle difference in his face. “Hey, did you say you're anemic?”
“I’m calling bullshit, Doc. Kiss your pussy. I’ll see you tonight after hours and get it all fixed up.”
"Be careful," he warned as I struggled. "I believe you hit your head hard against the asphalt. You could have very serious damage."
“Yes. I have ways of disguising them, though I prefer to do so with my hair. The other choices are -uncomfortable.”
"Want to go first?" Sherlock asked, breaking my reverie. I looked up to see him smiling a crooked smile so beautiful that I could only stare at him like an idiot. "Or, I could start, if you wish." The smile faded; he looked slightly concerned. Serious.
"Well, as always, Sh'loc, despite your ribald behaviour, we are well." My'crof let a sigh be heard over the communication line. "And how is the human you have met? I have heard that he is staying with you in London. Do you think that wise?"
She tilted her head, the soft smile staying as if to comfort him. “I’m sure your friend is fine, no one here but us ducks.”
"My mother is going to visit. It is unexpected." Sherlock looked sharply at John but took the tea he offered. "There can only be two reasons for such a maneuver. One, is to persuade me to leave what she feels is a fool's journey. Two, because there has been a query from Ir'ene." Sherlock seemed to contemplate his choice of words before continuing. "She and I have been set to marry, but I do not wish the match. It is possible that mother chooses to ascertain if this has changed."
As the base came into view, Sherlock found himself almost ill. It was not the sparsity of the rambling thing that now had him on edge, it was the 'welcoming' party. Three to be exact. Forward Commander, Chief Surgeon, and someone who looked little more than a boy. American, too, he'd bet. Wonderful. Americans. Loud fractious undulant parties- well maybe his violin at three in the morning when he couldn't sleep might not be as hate-inducing as he first thought.
The next morning brought a silence that was remarkably pleasant, no one had died, everyone was healing without heavier than normal houses stacked against them; breakfast was even what could be called passable. Real eggs and damn good coffee. Not that chicory business. Made Sherlock wonder what the black market was like in the area, how infiltrated and what was being passed through it.
He must have dozed off, must have. It was obvious as he slowly awoke, slightly off-kilter as his brain was still sleep-addled. Sherlock blinked his eyes open and was met with a kindly, amused smile and deep blue eyes set in a face that spoke of desert sand and crackling thunderstorms. The man was slightly smaller than him in stature, but well defined under his clothing, one only had to look at the shoulders to see that. His hands were clasped, small as well, but looked steady. The scent of antiseptic was barely noticeable under the clean-milled lavender and cologne.
The next few days flew past, and yes people did talk. But not to us. But again, we weren't an us at school, only after class was out for the day. It was rapidly becoming habit for Sherlock to wait by my car end of day, so much so that he had ridden in a Landrover to school with his family instead of driving himself. It felt ridiculous to be happy about something so small, but it seemed as if Sherlock was trying to show that he cared in his own way. When he wasn't berating me for being an idiot in maths, but then he'd soothed it by claiming everyone was an idiot, but I was most certainly not incompetent as them, but more or less non-honed.
He closed his eyes, as they weren’t giving him any better information than what he had just gathered, and tried to breathe. Ribs. Broken... possibly total of three; more than likely four. Other bones intact, but leg compromised muscularly in some capacity. Allowing his mind to sweep further he found that his thigh itched terribly, but when he went to lightly rub at it, he realised it was bandaged. Broken then. Reconstructed in some capacity. Revised opinion: Very Bad Accident. But the rest of his body was mostly in tact? Sherlock realised that his head felt ‘sensitive’, as if the follicles hadn’t been disturbed- oh. Head injury as well. Could explain the eye sight as well. He hoped not, it would be a terrible inconvenience to have to go have surgery just to correct the issue, if it were correctable.
Thousands of cells formed in the heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements. The cellular bath begins to move, beginning an imprint of a very human looking body. A very tall one at that. As the bones re-construct, the scientist was in awe as to how perfectly balanced they seemed; then the nervous and muscular systems were overlayed by the threaders. The very male body reconstructed quickly right before their eyes.
Sherlock twisted in pleasure at the fullness as John’s fingers slid further into him to press against his prostate. His hips jerked in surprise causing him to thrust as his slender fingers twined through John’s sandy-silver hair. The doctor’s free hand that pressed him back into the mattress to steady him was calm and sure. He whimpered in delight, John’s beard tickling his thighs as he fucked into his mouth. Sherlock bucked against the dual pleasure, but John kept pressing him back against the bed.
“Captain Holmes! Great to have you on such short notice! I’m Lieutenant Colonel Gregory Lestrade, Greg if you please. This is Captain John Watson, the best damn vascular surgeon I’ve ever seen, you’ll be bunked together and elbow to elbow soon enough. Come on, boys, let’s get some liquor in us while we can. Radar,-”
Sh’loc flicked on the kettle behind him and sat on the floor, practically boneless. “Tell me, John. How do you feel about this break coming up? Do you feel like travel this time?”
“More like he makes eyes at you, feathers your hair when he thinks no one is paying attention... and you?”
“Get on... John?” This made him want to shift up so that he was more sitting and pin her with his gaze until she either withered like Molly
He didn’t know where he wanted to touch first. Eventually, the open halves called to him, reminding him that there was a wonder expanse of John that was bare to him. Sherlock gave in, raking his manicured nails along John’s back; digging in when John ran his mouth over his pulse and nipped at the tender skin beneath. Sherlock’s hips shuddered as he trembled almost violently, need coiling deep within him. He could feel John hard and frotting against his thigh. He knew then what he wanted. “No clothes. I want... not like this... nude. Naked. Skin, I want to feel your skin against mine, your cock hot against my thigh... not fabric.”
Sherlock dressed as quickly as he could, and ran product carefully through his hair styling it in its tousled but heavily curled way. He pocketed a small tube of lube along with his other items and locked his flat for the night. The cab was indeed waiting for him. This shouldn’t affect him the way it was. Closing his eyes, he went to his mind palace to help him ignore the swishy feeling going through him. It was all transport. He could do this. Soon enough, Sherlock was alighting from the taxi and heading into Le Coq et Chat. He settled his nerves as the door was opened for him and his coat was taken before shown to their table.
The fact he had longed to touch his friend, just companionably, fingertips resting on one another even. He craved it. Knew it wasn't customary though, with Vulcans being touch telepaths. It wasn't an aversion, it was- intimate. To know someone that way. John understood it implicitly, the reasons behind Sherlock's use of gloves, the care to not touch. To open oneself that way. But he could be careful with him. Being betazed, he'd been trained since a child how to shelter himself from unwanted empathic contact, had honed it so he could become a doctor and serve within Starfleet. He hadn't planned on Sherlock. It made him smile to himself in the near darkness.
understand. Irrelevant. It was tender. His heart stuttered in his chest as he felt every nerve in his body spark to life.
“After.” John wrapped his bathrobe around himself and left off the tying before taking Sherlock’s hand.
“Yes, here I am, with provisions.” Sh’loc ignored the residual warmth in his stomach and put his things on the counter handing the kimchi and then the silver cylinder to John. “Happy Festivities.”
Our hands wandered slowly, as we backed up against the large scrolled arm couch. It held about a hundred pillows of various sizes, but my god, did if form my body to his when he laid on top of me. Still clothed, this felt just this side of right. Not too much, but certainly edging the line. Sherlock seemed to sense that and laughed softly, breaking our kissing, but not moving otherwise.
Especially when it came to one John Hamish Watson, med sci track, bunkmate, friend. The second one in his lifetime to deserve that title. As he had watched John tonight, his heart had hummed with contentment while his veins sang of darker desires. Mate, his blood had whispered. Touch, his cells had cravenly murmured. Take, his soul had longingly spoke. But John was not his. He was not allowed these luxuries, so he listened to John's voice, cherishing the tone as he read aloud an old book from Sh'loc's collection. The memory was  marred by the communications panel that softly lit up on the bedside table.  My'crof. Of course.
"With the soon to be step-father?" Sherlock surmised, his tone still kind. “He obviously figured out that you had bisexual tendencies.”
“Bisexual?” Sherlock swallowed hard. This was a fantasy that he needed to rein in before it got away with him. John was
Sherlock hummed and breathily spoke thanks as John rinsed him off just as lovingly. There was no other word for it. He was fully relaxed against the now warm tiles, his body becoming aroused in increments as John lathered his curls, then rinsed down his body again, this time detaching the thin metal wand from its holder against the wall.
John trailed his hand down Sherlock once again, taking him in his hand and slowly stroking after holding him a few seconds. Acclimation. Sherlock understood again. John would take care of him. It was so much to trust him with, yet here they were and here he was so open and willing to be touched. He sighed and decided to relax into it. Let it be what it was. And at that moment, it was perfect.
Sherlock was visibly trembling, something that had John's instincts on high. "I will be fine. I am sorry for disturbing you this early in the morning."
"John," Whispering my name against my skin, his lips followed where his fingers had been, his hand now roaming along my shoulder, down my arm. "There are things, about myself, I am selfish. I meant what I said about it being dangerous-"
The kettle whistled, breaking his thoughts, most likely better for it. Sherlock filled the pot and set it on the small tray, his cup, saucer and a plate of the biscuits with the chocolate on top laid out perfectly. Deciding to settle on the long sofa, he brought it to the round side table and placed it just so before sitting and removing his shoes. Wouldn’t do to leave marks on the thing. He poured himself a cuppa and laid down, cracking open a book as he let his drink cool.
I was an idiot, right along with Philip. I couldn't believe the rush of emotion pulsing through me —just because he'd happened to look at me for the first time in a half-dozen weeks. I couldn't allow him to have this level of influence over me. It was pathetic; no more than. It was unhealthy. When the bell rang at last, I turned my back to him to gather my things, expecting him to leave immediately as usual.
"That's great," I made my voice overly excited to make sure the sarcasm hit it's mark through Philip's thick head. "and let me guess, you said no, like a punter."
I vividly remembered how pale he had been, the flat dark under his gorgeously dark eyes the last time he'd glared at me. The color was striking against the background of his skin and his auburn hair. Today, his eyes were a completely different color: a strange almost-grey, lighter than the moody sky that currently brooded over us, but with the same sort of silvery washed tone. I didn't understand. Contacts maybe. I looked down towards the lino, my ears hot now too, at the thought. Here I was blushing over Sherlock Holmes.
“I figured you might want something softer against your skin tonight.” John smiled impishly as his voice dropped. “Still a bit tender? You are-”
He hung up his gun belt and stepped out of his boots as I got out plates and started the kettle. As far as I was aware, he'd never shot the gun on the job. But he kept it ready.
My mind was spinning with confusion. Had I made up the whole thing? He was perfectly polite now. I had to speak; he was waiting. But I couldn't think of anything conventional to say.
"Tender?" he asked. "Stitches seem perfectly spaced and small. The laceration was not terribly deep, nor large. You should be fine in a few days."
I waited for them to get their food, and then followed them to a table. Twice Mike asked, with unnecessary concern, how I was feeling. I told him it was nothing, which it was, really; but I was wondering if I should play it up and escape to the nurse's office for the next hour. It could stop me from acting rashly, that was for certain. Ridiculous. I shouldn't have to run away. I could deal with this like an adult. Politely ignore and then try to discuss it with him at some point, but not in class.
The roughened fingers once against squeezed against his as if reaffirming that Sherlock was tangible. It struck him somewhere deep that John would so clearly be certain about such a thing when he, himself, knew there had indeed been a nurse watching over him before he had dozed off.
“Good,” The doctor inhaled as if to say something but stopped, a warm amused expression crossing his face. “You know, this is, well it’s rather lovely isn’t it?”
The sultry computer voice greeted him, telling him fuel levels, the temperature outside, rate and flow of traffic. As the seals begin to hiss and whine, the safely door opened to a view of the megalopolis that London has become. John wistfully thinks of pictures from his great-great-grandmother and how things used to be. Certainly not this writhing insane bustle. Maybe he needed a vacation.
"Actually, Greg, I was wondering if I may have John up to ours this weekend? To meet everyone?" Sherlock looked completely sincere, almost formal. "And if I may escort him to the dance?"
The water was pleasantly warm even against Sherlock’s sensitive skin. He hummed his pleasure and turned under the heavy spray to face John and wrap his arms around John’s neck. Their kiss was tangled; just as tangled as Sherlock was around John. His long leg was lifted in John’s steady hand, wrapped over John’s hip, their sated cocks and relaxed testicles nestled against themselves intimate in a way that had Sherlock dropping his head against the tile and rutting just to feel them slide together. John’s fingers found Sherlock’s loosened hole. Slipped in as his teeth found skin. Scissored against the pucker as John’s emissions slipped back out and down his own fingers, pooling lightly in the cup of his hand to be washed away against his wrist.
He changed the pressure down to very low and ran the side of the wand along Sherlock’s well washed skin. Sherlock moaned, his eyes closed heavily as he shifted his hips out further in acceptance.
He could hear Sherlock dressing and called out they should get a bit of a move on as that grouping was the last for the day and if they needed provisions that they’d need to certainly be in London at a decent hour. He couldn’t wait to see this place. Sherlock began explaining that it was by Regent’s Park and the old tube stations. That it was an old Victorian that had been restored, so it had four floors and a smaller basement turned lab as well. John could not believe that Sherlock actually owned it outright.
I laughed without humor. "It might not be, but it was my decision. I have more freedom here and dad- well I’m sure he knows, and he’s fine. So."
"Yes, this, this is just right." I cheekily moved my hand lower to his hip and held there. "Practically perfect in every way."
“The point is to bring something from your place of origin, where you grew up... celebrate diversity.”
Sherlock looked fascinated by what I said, for some reason I couldn't imagine. His face was such a distraction that I tried not to look at it any more than courtesy absolutely demanded.
“Let’s start with my pants.” This was not how he had envisioned John seeing his cock for the first time. Anyone for that matter. The thing was practically unimpressive at this point; just floppy extra skin and bits to get caught on things as the two grown men maneuvered and settled (the loose) boxers. He was slightly damp with sweat just from that small exertion and wanted to practically curse a blue streak as only John’s American friends could. “Ridiculous.”
“Yes, yes, fine.” His voice was low; resigned. John threaded his feet through the legs of the tracksuit then unsnapped the hidden side snaps to mid thigh.
The man came back through the arched doorway with a slightly larger tray with tea, two cups and saucers and more of the chocolate-covered biscuits. “Flat then? You don’t look homeless-”
Sentiment. Lovely. Absolutely exactly what he needed smack dab in this forsaken little corner of the world. As he opened the door to the barracks he shared with 3C he found himself hoping that the film made exactly the point they all wanted it to. He was a pacifist. Yes, he knew judo and bartitsu, fencing- these were purely academic aims. The same as his lessons in ballet and free-movement jazz had been, and hadn't those establishments proved enlightening in his formative years. This small act of non-violent protest would give a laugh to everyone enlisted, possibly piss his brother of properly, and probably have him end up in the 'hoosegow' with MP's rogering his ass for anti-war sentiment.
"Well..." He swallowed and wiped his hands on his trousers as he spoke. "I told her I had to think about it."
“Are you suddenly forgetting who sat next to you for over a thousand missions. I know how you drive, Major.”
“Hey, just found a picture of the two of us...” John gazed at the picture of the two of them in uniform ready to raze hell if necessary. “From the day. God fucking Commandos-”
Sherlock woke to soft short hair caressing his shoulder. Warm lips were trailing a lazy line along his neck then back down towards his nape. The insistent hardness that was gliding along his cleft was not lost on him, he had his own tumescence to see to it seemed. It was rare for him to wake this way, but with John behind him, gently waking him in this manner, how could he not?
Parched he reached for the cup beside him on the roll-a-way and found the cup in a still warm state... not quite tepid, meaning that it hadn’t been in the room lon. Mostly drank. Depressions on the right side of the styrofoam from meticulously filed nails. Wide bed, so male.
Sherlock could hear the genuine concern in his voice. It was odd; but not odd for John obviously. He concerned himself with others, that was obvious; this though had an edge of possessiveness to it that made Sherlock want to blush.
He gave us a rueful smile. "I know when a son is trying to shoo his old da away to sneaky kiss. Not like I've not done it myself, mind. Goodnight, Sherlock."
The nurse binned my shirt, but helpfully gave me a jumper out of his own stash in his locker. It beat having to wear a gown. It was amazing how small of a cut could bleed so freely once properly cleaned. It felt like hours later when I finally was allowed to doze.
he was feeling, was deep. A low thrum that he only picked up when they were both at their most comfortable. Like this evening.
"Actually," Dr. Holmes corrected, "Might prove better to have an orderly do so, it seems most of the school is in the main lobby waiting to see you both."
When he sat next to me in class, as far from me as the table would allow, he seemed totally unaware of my presence. Only now and then, when his fists would suddenly ball up — skin stretched even whiter over the bones — did I wonder if he wasn't quite as oblivious as he appeared. I wanted very much to talk to him, and the day after the accident I tried. The last time I'd seen him, outside the ER, we'd parted ways amicably, with a little flirting if I was understanding the signals. Maybe I'd crossed them all; had gotten it wrong. I couldn't get myself to believe that though.
John removed his thumb and gently soothed with soft strokes against his thigh and stopped stroking. “Shhh, shhh, baby. Breathe. Knees up, heels against your plush bottom. Now.”
If you need anyone to ask about these things, you may always anon me on my tumblr: Beautifullyheeled.
“Slight blurring, haloing. Sometimes.” He could see the gentle emanation of colour around John. “You look as if your edges have been dipped in sunlight or honey.”
"My sister is here to pick me up." His eyes strayed to the window behind my shoulder. "I need to go."
testing, ignoring the slight burn in favor of thoughts of John as he slowly pressed it all the way in.
Someone who confused and bewildered him, in the best of ways. John felt his heart beat just a little faster.
Why was I thinking like this? It had only been a couple of days since the Incident in the Kitchen with the Knife by Myself and I was going to meet his family and I'm already marrying him in my brain. Ridiculous romantic drivel. Though, if my life before coming here had been a dirge, now it was a waltz. Twirling, and colourful, full of life set at a pace where you can catch your breath, but only just.
Mr Gregson came to our table then, to see why we weren't working. He looked over our shoulders to glance at the completed lab, and then stared more intently to check the answers.
"Well, I have a few classes with a girl named Molly. I sit with her friends at lunch. And there's this boy, Mike, who's very friendly. Everybody seems pretty nice."
"On the contrary, I find you very difficult to read." Despite everything that I'd said and he'd guessed, he sounded like he meant it.
Sh'loc looked up to the roof of his room as he laid on the ornate master bed. Mrs. Hudson had done very well in finishing his home to his specifications, but the new antique, and the proportions of the item were not lost on him. Her human-ness was endearing, even though it had no right to be. She had even procured a second chair to go along side his in his personal parlour. Hope was evident in her thought pattern, even in her tone. She approved of John. He only hoped that it would not break her heart when nothing became of their errant friendship. It was true, he was unattached as arranged marriage for second sons was no longer in fashion, and though some still practiced it to be sure of the lineage of progeny, it would never be his path to follow. Of course his childhood neighbor, Ir’ene, had her eye on him for a very long time. Both were from Noble Houses, both attracted to the same sex. It could have been a marriage of convenience for them both, but as she had stated one night before he had left to go off-world, why settle? They both knew the pull off their emotions were strong; both a force to be reckoned with and yet perfectly cool and logical in their discussions with others.
"No, no!" I insisted, throwing my legs over the side of the bed and hopping down quickly, forgetting about my damned leg. I started to fall when Sherlock was, once again, right there beside me. Dr. Holmes and he both looked concerned.
“Yes, sir.” He sat up properly now, his finger shaking out his curls. He had to look sheepish. Innocently caught. Which he was, but Sherlock knew his normal acerbic behavior would not fly with this man.
Sherlock was waiting beside my car, looking straight forward, his lips pressed together. If looks to kill, I think we'd all be covered in blood spatter. I yanked the door open and jumped inside, slamming it as Sherlock folded himself into the passenger side and calmly closed it. His car was obviously still parked in the same spot as it had been this morning when he had arrived.
When the exercise was over, I tried my best not to limp back towards the our changing rooms. I quickly dressed back into my uniform, navy trousers, white shirt. jacket, dark blue tie as I hadn’t gotten my house assignment yet. I found myself hoping Ii was with Mike. He was talkative and friendly. It was nice. He also had stated he wanted to go go for some sort of medical career. I have always known I wanted to be a doctor, too, so it would be nice to have someone to revise with when the time comes.
It was hard to concentrate on anyone thread of thought. The soft buzzing in his head, from either medication or concussion, made it difficult. The slight ring in his ear wasn’t doing him any favours either. Sherlock sighed, breathing in as far as he could before exhaling and tried listening to his surroundings. Whirs, buzzes, simple grey noise expected in an urban hospital. Voices.
The shiny metal parted and reversed back from where it had come from revealing a humanoid, somewhere in their late twenties.
“John, please. I’m... I just need a moment is all.” Sherlock wanted to look up, to meet John’s eyes in the mirror, but he couldn’t bring himself to. “I have never wanted to please someone before, not once since I was a small child. I found myself
I couldn't fathom his acceptance, it had seemed so easy. He continued to stare at me with penetrating eyes, as if my life's story was somehow vitally important, yet his face had definitely softened into something almost kind.
Sh’loc slowly went through the intricate moves. The drumbeats the only thing filling his senses in the main space of their living quarters. He’d been off balance since Thanksgiving and needed to re-center. John said he would be gone most of the day shopping for Christmas, so this should have been the perfect time. Moving his arms and hands with purpose, his feet knowing this ancient art, he trusted his body to move as it must as he cleared his mind and worked ever inward. He no longer felt the sweat on his brow, or the stick of his curls against his neck. The sheen across his chest and arms the cost of physical mastery and exertion.
Not worth being tense waiting for an arrival that was not coming. It’s not like the movies. Even if he had suspected, there had to be some other reason that Sherlock Holmes seemed to completely reject me as a person before we could even say hello. I hoped that he would simply ignore me when we did see one another and prove my suspicions false.
John laid quietly in one of the guest suites one floor above Sherlock's. He thought of it as a suite, even if that wasn't technically the name as it had a small parlour, or morning room, attached to his bedroom. A set of 'pocket doors' with the most beautiful array of stained glass closed one space off from the rest if you chose; why you would, John wasn't certain, if for nothing else than to be able to gaze at the absolute craftsmanship of the antique doors themselves. He loved the novelty of them so had closed them as he had gone to bed, the soft light from his parlour caused them to glitter gently in the darkness. Suffused with happiness, his mind wandered to his friend, the man he was just beginning to know.
As the drums ceased and the single flute began, Sh’loc himself started pulling himself out of the meditative trance that the forms had brought to him. He felt much more centered. Better aligned and in understanding of his feelings towards his friend. It no longer troubled him, that what he possessed for John ran very deep. So deep in fact, he had almost not registered it. What a shame that would have been.  As Sh’loc became more aware, he realised he was not alone, but the feel of the air was familiar.
Despite my outright lies, the tenor of my e-mails alerted mom to my depression, and she called a few times, worried. I tried to convince her it was just the weather that had me down; wasn't used to the overcast, damp, or terrible snow. I sold it. She hadn't called back. Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness between me and my lab partner. I could see he'd been worried that Sherlock's daring rescue might have impressed me, and he was relieved that it seemed to have the opposite effect. He grew more confident, sitting on the edge of my table to talk before Biology class started, ignoring him as completely as he ignored us.
“Ah, yes, it did allow you to come to Starfleet.” John ignored the pull at his stomach of emotions, though faint, were not his.
I was showing off, just a little. I'd already done this lab, and I knew what I was looking for. It should be easy. I snapped the first slide into place under the microscope and adjusted it quickly to the 40X objective. I studied the slide briefly.
John didn't feel guilty over it; not really. Samarah and he had been lightly bonded and promised as children. She was clearly happy with him, as he was her, but it was a friendship only. There was no romanticism there. His 'older' sister though; the way they looked at one another. There was a definite spark between the two women. It would be lovely to see them pair bond. To truly complete someone- it made sense that he was chosen at the time, familial bonds being strong- so it did not surprise him that it was Harriet that would be the one for his betrothed. It could happen, though rare. Then again, so were twins. Would Sherlock be open to him courting him was the question. The
He smirked and pushed the microscope to me. I looked through the eyepiece eagerly; it was interesting to watch, so it gave me something else to concentrate on other than him.
Sherlock couldn’t help but to quip a ghost of a smile at the impertanence and seeming garrulousness of his welcome. Even with the laid back demeanor, he could tell by the callus on their hands and the creasing of their faces, that they were worn from a hard night previously, but knew when to celebrate and use their off time in their own pursuits. Greg, writing and fishing, well creating fanciful hooks for use at a later time. John though, he was a hard nut to crack. Obviously a bit of a womaniser, more likely that he was an easy lover ready for a tussle. Well read, crack shot, competent physician.
He turned his head a fraction toward me without meeting my gaze, nodded once, and then looked the other way. "Fine, John." It sounded normal, but also strained.
"They seemed nice enough to me. I just noticed they kept to themselves. They're, um, very attractive," I added, before thinking about what I was saying.
His hand ghosted along my cheek once more and then he hopped out the back and was gliding through the hospital doors. There was another flurry of movement and urgency; another stretcher brought to the bed next to me. I recognized Philip and took a moment to thank whatever God there was that he was alright. Alive.
By Friday, I tried not to think about him; it was obvious that he had no intention of coming back and there wasn’t even a rumor of where he had gone. So much for fixing whatever it was that had set him off the day we had met.
Blackwood laughed his goodbye and rang off. John shook his head at his friend. Fuck, the man knew him so well. It wouldn’t be too bad after all; catch up, have a few beers, maybe some poker with those stupid ‘racy’ cards they had coveted in the darker hours together. Sweetie was still meowing at him so he tapped another button and the small feeder opened from a space along the floor. She began eating, purring at him inbetween bites.
“Yes, love? That right?” His breath was hot against the shell of Sherlock’s ear. “Look at me. Come on... it’s all fine.” John continued to rub at the base of the toy, pressing at it. “Is it really too much? Do you need me to help you?”
I kissed the side of his face, little soft things offering comfort. I understood the confusion; would most likely deal with my own later that night. For now though, this was the most beautiful thing that had ever happened in my life until this point and I was not going to let it just slip away.
John huffed a noncommittal noise at that. “Do you live on just biscuits too then? Who cares for you?”
My fears were strengthened during lunch when she sat as far from him as possible, chatting animatedly with Mary instead. Philip was unusually quiet through lunch and was still quiet as he walked me to class, but he didn't broach the subject until I was in my seat and he was perched on my desk. I know that Sherlock was there, but I'd also become accustomed to him ignoring me. It was horrible, but I was learning to live with it.
“Well, a few of us are staying actually, in my study group, and we’ve discussed possibly having a dinner of our own. A real American spread, but with maybe one or two small dishes from our homes too. Like, for instance I could bring Kimden rolls and Uttaberry wine or I could also bring a good scotch and some Shepherd's pie... what about you?”
It sounded so very, very good. The heat that began radiating from his core had nothing to do with the shower and everything to do with John.
It rankled Sherlock that Geraldine seemed to have the upperhand. Utterly ridiculous. Who was this girl? She was most certainly a nurse, he could see that much, but she looked completely at odds with the here and now. Had that sense about her that John did, as if she had seen too much but had accepted it. Was it an impossibility that she had been to war? Most certainly.
Thank you all for reading and I am so happy that so many of you have enjoyed this little romp on the saccharine side!
Mr Gregson called the class to order then, and I turned to listen. I was in disbelief that I'd just explained all of this to someone I thought might have hated me just a few days ago. Maybe I was going a bit barmy with the weather. I knew I wasn’t; that this had everything to do with his voice and those eye. He'd seemed engrossed in our conversation, but now I could see, from the corner of my eye, that he was leaning away from me again, his hands gripping the edge of the table with unmistakable tension.
“Everyone, sir. Everyone.” He laughed, a harsh-sounding, half-strangled thing. “I think maybe it was a kindness, at first. To teach me to distance myself, but then the other children rapidly proved the words true... especially most recently. Adults too. It doesn’t matter... none of this matters-” Sherlock knew he was breaking down, he must have been exhausted and now John; his emotions were welling up higher than he liked. “Only the Work matters.”
“John, it is fine that I am not bound by the rules of the hierarchy that my family belongs. I am a second son, and the Gods must have found a moment of wisdom when it was done. Please, it is fine.”
Everything is great. Of course it's raining. I was waiting for something to write about. I met some nice kids who sit by me at lunch.
"It will be really fun." Her attempt to convince me was kind. "You know we're all going. Should drag your arse there anyway. What about Mary?"
"Oh, hell." John muttered curse came freely from him before he had had a chance to leave his bed. He opened the door at the second set of raps against his door. They were quiet, but the emotions he could feel were far from it. A snarl with a thread of fear running throughout. "Alright?"
It was a claiming, that I knew, and I accepted. I'd jumped both feet and was giddy with it. His arm holding me solidly against him, his other hand against my cheek slipping down to caress my jaw and neck, landing against my pulse; the sharp staccato even more pronounced against his fingertips. It was flying and I was soaring along with it, the thrill of his lips against mine, his mouth slowly opening, little sips of my lips, deeper kisses teased at. I was in the clouds and this had to be Heaven. Sherlock, my own personal angel. He bloody well looked like one, especially now, as I turned in his arms, the afternoon light filtering in. He positively glowed. Ethereal.
“Sure you are. I’ll go see about that scan, okay?” A soft snore was Sherlock’s only response as he slipped once more into the morphine’s loving grasp.
My mind was buzzing and I was almost sick with it. All I could hear was my step-father's voice, then Mary's. I couldn't breathe, but I refused to let go.
“No these are not stripper attire. Yes, they are posh, so let’s get himself all tucked in and arse covered, shall we.” The tease was pushing Sherlock to smile in spite of his mood. “Good, now roll to your left so I can... there!”
“No, I’m revising Chemistry. I take on cases for the Met when they are out of their depth. Not all of the time yet, but there is a D.I. that takes me seriously.”
“Says the young man who fell asleep on a sofa in a cottage that isn’t even his.” John sighed and stood, taking his tea with him. “Not on drugs?”
“Please, Sherlock, you’re as tense as a wet cat. I’ll stop questioning, I just thought you had a good relationship with your family is all. I’m sorr-”
“Yes, Sherlock it would.” At least he could be prepared if something happened if they were training together. “So, Kimchi?”
“I don’t want a million. I’ve had multiple world’s of choice... I just want one.” He sighed as he thought of a warm supple body he could hold. “A perfect one.”
His eyes seemed to almost glow in the light that filtered in from the windows in the hall. It was breathtaking. I didn’t know if I wanted to kiss him or ignore what was wrenching in my chest. He paused, and for a brief moment his stunning face was unexpectedly vulnerable.
Write me as soon as you get in. Tell me how your flight was. Is it raining? I miss you already. I'm almost finished packing for Florida, but I can't find my pink blouse. Do you know where I put it? Phil says hi.
I swallowed hard, deciding to ignore the heat of his breath against my skin. "Your room? I would hope-"
“You mean the forms I was working through? I only did the primary ones as it would be unsafe for me to take to the air or use some of the more punctuated moves in this space.”
We ate in silence for a few minutes before he cleared his throat. "So, how do you like school? Have you made any friends?"
“You’re welcome, but-” The ex-commando grabbed the rifle, lightning quick, out of the mugger’s hands. “You know these things are illegal and you could get into a
No, he couldn’t see himself ever wanting to get that close to another human being. He had his own version of pornography, and had even found a particular ‘type’ that he enjoyed looking at. But the chances of him ever meeting a military man that was intelligent, and wouldn’t mind if there was an age gap, were slim. Most people weren’t intellectually stimulating enough to want to be around for more than a few seconds, let alone the time it would take to have an orgasm, with them, so self pleasuring and sex aides it was.
“Whoever told you that? Did someone-” John cleared his throat and swallowed. “Whoever told you that and had the audacity to ingrain it to the point that is your automatic response is a right tosser.”
"The VanBuren Supernova," Sherlock answered, slowing moving his gaze away from mine back to the front of the class.
“So innocent,” The laughter was back as John comforted, his hand dipping low between Sherlock’s cleft pressing when he found the flat edge of the plug. “I can feel the lace... and this... what size?”
“I’m not a child.” His pulse was racing and he swore he could feel his heart trying to beat out of his chest. “I have no frame of reference for this. Any of it. You.”
. They’d barely met and yet his words... his actions had pinned something tender within Sherlock. Something fleeting and raw. Yes. He could do this. He
"Sherlock-" The tang of iron was stronger than it had been, I felt my stomach turn even as he brought his nose to the offending hand and nuzzled against it. "Is this happening? Are we?"
They laid together for a while just to do so, but eventually Sherlock began to feel sticky and a little used in all the right ways so John led them to his shower. It was largish, given the size of the cottage, but oh-so-very welcome. John twisted the hot, then cold taps adjusting them as the water rained down from the large showerhead. Sherlock reached out for the tubular metal attachment against the cool grey tiled wall.
It was better because it wasn't raining yet, though the clouds were dense and opaque. It was easier because I knew what to expect of my day Mike came to sit by me in English, and walked me to my next class. People also didn't look at me quite as much as they had yesterday. That was nice. It felt like I was deemed as close to local barring the tan and accent and that was alright. I sat with a big group at lunch that included Mike,Philip, Sally, and several other people whose names and faces I now remembered. I began to feel like I was treading water.
"It's still night until sunrise when on holiday." He tried to make light, but his attention was brought back around to the fact that he was
The rest of the night passed quietly and I fell asleep quickly. The rest of the week fell into place so that by Friday I was able to recognize, if not name, almost all the students at school. At the last class of the day with my new house, they were more respectful of my space even though it was rugby, because they knew I still was healing. It seemed as if Framingham might not be as terrible as I had worried it might be. There was only one thing that bothered me.
“Why do you say that?” Gerti’s eyes twinkled. “Aren’t really allowed to on shift-nights. You should know this. Don’t you get on with one of the girls from the Morgue? Oh, not in that way, I know you only have eyes for your doctor...”
At least I got to see his face one more time. If only it could have been a millisecond before he registered what he was about to see. Could have maybe been something. Maybe.
"As it was when our father and our mother met." My'crof's smugness was apparent. "Don't upset her, Sh'loc-"
John took the opening and brought their teas over to the sitting area, handing Sherlock his before seating himself. God, this wasn’t a date, why did he feel so... keyed up?
I had decided to read the novel we were currently studying after responding to mum in hopes of losing myself in it for a while, but my stomach grumbled reminding me the I needed to start dinner. I put the sausages in the pan and potatoes into the boiling water. With the rolls in the oven I figured it would be a simple, but much better than Greg had in ages at home.
“Oh, baby, darling. So perfect.” John was kissing him and wrapping him up in his arms. He was no longer very slick and he could smell a hint of lavender in the air. Washed him then, Sherlock supposed. Which was fine. “Sherlock, beautiful love. It’s alright.”
“This, is to help make sure you are extra clean.” The kiss landed on Sherlock’s shoulder as John spoke. “Want to kiss you,” His words prickled as his beard whispered against the wet skin. “Press my tongue in you.” John reached up and diverted the water and showed how the small holes created a sort of mini shower from the rounded end of it. “Now, I’ll not divert this much... this isn’t...”
,” The words were whispered low as he dipped his chin to his chest. The doctor’s name drawn from him in a lingering moan. “John...”
There was a knock at the door and he muttered to himself about Mrs. Hudson. Must have let someone up.
“So... do I-” This was all new and Sherlock felt his nerves work against the hot buzz that had built up in the shower. His cock was responding, the light torture of the towel around his hips enough to make him whimper as John arranged the bed and then reclined against them and the headboard. “I don’t-”
His fingers were always nimble and at the ready, whether in an operating theatre or playing his beloved violin, he was certain the former would gain him respect the later much ire as had been had at his last set of dorms. Sherlock knew he would be sharing a bivouac with two others, possibly three. It was hateful. He would have to get 'on their good side' and 'play nice with others' in order to show his contrition, of which, their was none to be had. Not his fault that he stumbled on that nest of Vipers who had been funneling intelligence to the United States media conglomerates. Magnussen was as oiled and as dangerous as any adversary he had ever had the pleasure of taking down. The man had made his skin crawl, all dead-eyed and cock-sure, to borrow the Americanism. How was he to know that he was also holding secrets on most of the British Monarchy as well as several other high-powered individuals not only in the United Kingdom, but elsewhere?
If there was ever a moment when I fully embraced going weak at the knees, it was this one. All over his voice and a few properly chosen words. I put my hands on the counter to brace myself, forgetting the knife under my palm. The cool bite of the metal brought me back from the thoughts that had begun to occupy my brain.
“Anderson, it would be wise of you to shut your mouth and let the adults have a moment of introspection for the lives lost today and to be able to think on the ones still here through sheer determination. We’ve just fought at Hell’s gate for, what? About twelve, fourteen hours? Shut it will you.” John Watson, vascular specialty, small hands, ambidextrous but dominant left, had roughly pulled off his surgical mask as he dressed Anderson down. “Give Holmes a break, will you. He’s a damn fine surgeon and a compliment to our unit. Now kindly shut the fuck up and go bury your dick in something warm and stick a tit in your mouth to shut you up, why don’t you?”
. A scrape of teeth, a touch of callused hands that weren’t his own. His cock twitched hard and he bit his lip. He was antsy, wanting to orgasm as he had with John, but worried it would feel... lacking. Empty? Half-cursing, he took his fingers out and pulled the stopper as he exited the tub, wrapped a towel around himself, and went through to his bedroom. He pulled the small silicone plug out from his bedside, then the lube. The plan had been to use it at some point; to feel the hedonistic glide within him for more than the few moments his finger normally was. To perhaps feel out if he’d like that sort of stimulation in a longer duration. Never would he ever had thought its first use would be to prepare him for someone else.
“Happy Thanksgiving, Sherlock.” John set the Kimchi on the counter and opened the holder to find a bottle of  2287 Uttaberry wine. “The year mum and dad married? How did you know?”
The tray clicking on his roll-away woke him out of the light doze he had fallen into. “Not eating much.”
"Mummy will be pleased to meet him then, when she arrives to visit, or had you forgotten that she would come to give her blessing to you while you are so close to the 'cottage'?"
Sorry this is Monday, not Friday or Saturday. I received some wonderful news that then sent my weekend into a bit of havoc, but in the best way. As a heads up, there will be no post from March 9th to March 13th, due to said news. This is the beginning of the E rating, though really it's maybe more M. Thank you to everyone who has kuddoed and commented, it means a lot after such a long hiatus. ~Bo
"It's Sally- Philip asked her finally." It felt like a relief; maybe she'd get busy with Molly over planning and everyone could just go about their business as usual.
"I don't think he likes me," I confided. I still felt queasy. But now for an entirely different reason.
I noticed, everyday, that he hadn’t been back yet, but that his family seemed to be acting... well there normal... so maybe he was just away. Not transferred or sick. Where would he transfer too anyway? This wasn’t Sydney. At lunches, the chatter around the table was for the trip to the coast that Mike was trying to put together to Aldeburgh in a couple of weeks. It sounded interesting at least. The music festival was supposed to be a big deal and even Molly seemed to chime in about it. The beach would be warmish, but the water would be cold. I wondered if people even swam in the water there.
I glanced at Dr Holmes as Sherlock waved the orderly away and began pushing me himself down a back corridor.
John and... someone else? He couldn’t make out who though he assumed masculine so Lestrade or... well it might be feminine just very hushed so Molly. If it were Mycroft or Mrs. Hudson, they would be in the room talking amongst themselves. There was a reason he was alone. News then, possibly a doctor? But then why in the hall and not here by his bedside. If only he could
"Just what I need, my intended towering even more over me, though it would give me better access to all those virginal places you've kept from all others."
