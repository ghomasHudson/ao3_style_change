‘Because I don’t know what to do and you’re the smartest man I know.’ Silence again before a short laugh, it doesn’t sound like Mycroft’s normal laugh and Greg wonders if he’s right in thinking it sounds self deprecating, that’s most likely some form of wishful thinking though,
He hears them before he sees them. From his position on the ground his sight is near useless but the heavy hum, the patter of high frequency artillery raining down from up above; the sound of salvation.
“Not the first, no, she was taken from me by a nasty strain of syphilis. The second however, perhaps, I gave her a job, certainly.”
Their absence that year had started a trend and every year Greg’s excuses became less and less tangible until he finally placed himself on the rota for working the blasted holidays every year. He had done that for the last four years and honestly he had been happier at work than he would have been at home. His wife was likely happier in his absence as well. But not this year. This year Greg had booked the holiday off, he had put to one side his plans for late night Chinese food and depressing conversations with Thompson, this year he was going home for Christmas. He had called his mother and made her promise to buy new tinsel, she had seemed surprised but quietly optimistic in the presence of his enthusiasm. When she asked if Denise would be coming for dinner Greg had said no., There had been silence for a few minutes before his mother simply said ‘good’ and they left the topic alone, his mother promising to make fresh minced pies in time for his evening arrival on Christmas Eve. His brother had called next, annoyed that Greg was promising his attendance when he had missed so many events over recent years but Greg had sworn to him that he would attend. His sister had simply sent him an email stating ‘I’m so bloody excited’ and numerous pictures of his nephews dressed as elves and snow men. Greg would admit to nobody that the sight of those three beautiful faces had brought a tear to his eye. He had missed so much throughout his marriage and it was time for that to come to an end.
While wiping porridge off the surfaces he thought back to the morning previously, 24 hours ago he’d been sat in his sad bed sit contemplating a second cup of tea before work, he’d slept badly, nightmares a regular occurrence again, and awoken with no desire for food but a strong need for caffeine. Now he was facing a lifetime of responsibility he’d never dreamed of and never understood how much he wanted. He’d thought about children in an abstract sense but they’d always been pushed into the future, something to discuss with a serious partner if one would ever materialise. Mina was no abstract idea however, she was also not in the ring of cushions John had placed her in, panic surged through John and he circled the table, had she fallen, where was she, had he remembered to close the front door, but she was there, clinging to the bars at the side of Sherlock’s chair and contemplating the skull on the mantelpiece, she’d pulled herself up to standing and John realised their little tests yesterday hadn’t taken into account mood, perhaps she could do more than they’d noted. He stood quietly watching her as she pondered the skull, she lifted her hand to her mouth and started sucking her fingers again, there was something in that John thought, some meaning behind the action maybe, was it comfort, some babied formed attachments to the sucking motions if feeds had been used for comfort or he supposed if they’d had dummies, was this a similar action.
“Yeah Mycroft, I’m alright. She’s kicking up a fuss but I’m not surprised. She’s just that sort.” Greg found himself picturing Mycroft’s pose; was he sat at his desk? Leant against it? Perhaps he stood looking over some highly manicured grounds. “Don’t suppose you know of any hotels in the area do you? Or somewhere close to work? I might just drive further in to the city.  You know, cut down on the commute“. Once again silence fell over their conversation; Greg took a left hand turn onto a ring road which would take him into the city. London at this time of night was no picnic but it also wasn’t hideous. Greg thought that he might consider cycling to work if he could find a place nearer the Yard.
“It’s on route Cap but…” John looks up in time to see the bullet hit Abdul in the neck. The wound is a mess; he can see that right off. They’d worked together for months. John had been teaching him English. Abdul had been teaching him to cook and now he’s lying there breathing out and John can’t help him because in their current situation Abdul is dead and he knows it, but the unknown soldier beneath him is breathing, be it shallowly, and John might still have a chance to save him, to save someone but the bullets are starting up again and John is forced to cover the dying soldier’s body with his own., His face is close enough now that he can see the man’s eyes and they’re glassy. The bastard’s bleeding out too fast and there’s nothing John can do. They’re under fire, there’s no let up and people are dropping all around him. They need cover. They need to get out of these bullets.
‘Actually John there was a purpose to my visit today. Seeing as we are discussing family it seems like an appropriate moment to mention it. My parents would like to arrange a meeting, one where they will have the opportunity to meet you and Mina as well as learn more about the decisions that are being made for her future?’ John lowers himself into the red chair framing the fireplace, he looks mildly concerned but Mycroft deduces the cause is most likely nerves,
‘Do you know what your first word was John?’ Siger poses the question, both the Holmes men seemed to have followed his example with allowing themselves more comfort, Mycroft’s risen to fix them what looks like glasses of whiskey, a known weakness of John’s,
I am nervous about my next move John. I am uncertain about the decisions I have made and the plan I have already started to enact. I have befriended the wife of my enemy in order to gain access to his home and remove him from this volatile equation.
“Why would Sherlock jump, truly, it never made sense, he wasn’t suicidal. We all knew that. I’ve been distracted. I’ve been focused on what I saw not what I observed. So stupid. God damn it!”
‘Do you want to put her down somewhere, there’s a cot all set up for her upstairs if you think she needs to keep sleeping. We haven’t got one of those travel cots yet but I was thinking of maybe setting one up in the living room. So she could nap downstairs when I work from home. I haven’t really thought it through properly yet but I thought it sounded like a good idea so you know I can be right here when she needs me. If she needs me, even if she is a good sleeper she may need me sometimes right?’ the whole speech comes out as a blur of words that he didn’t even catch. Turning he looks sheepishly and the brunette.
Familiar theme music fills the living room as the two friends fell into near silence, without looking at the screen John recognises it. He raises a single eyebrow at his new friend while the woman moves forward to capture the remote. He’d been a fan of Doctor Who growing up, the family friendly story lines being a hit for him and his mum, Harry had never liked them much, she’d stayed around for the story arcs with Ace but she’d preferred to mock John’s interest in them instead. They were a classic part of British culture though, there for few people in the country, who would fail to identify a Dalek or the famous Blue Police Box,
‘Alright good, second question, is there someone else in your home? Someone who shouldn’t be? A threat?’
She has invited me to her home tomorrow afternoon while her husband attends to business matters. I am hardly a master of seduction John; I have very little experience of the mechanics while sober.  Sex and cocaine went hand in hand for me for many years, my first and only experience of it while entirely sober occurred in university during my brief dalliance with the son of an ambassador; Victor Trevor, he was older and more experienced while I was unfortunately naive as to how these interactions should play out.
She was malnourished, underdeveloped, dirty, entirely silent and lacking in love. From the reports his team had been bringing in there was a high likelihood of abuse and as no one could find or identify the girl’s mother lord knows how the little one had ended up in that hellhole, ‘John I know it’s hard, none of us know what to do, but the DNA says she’s his. What can we do?’
“Are you alright?” The question as well as the quiet tone it was asked in shouldn’t have been enough to make Greg smile but none the less he felt the corners of his lips twitch. He had on the line one of the most powerful, most handsome, most amazing men he had ever met, who was concerned with Greg’s welfare.
Greg grinned. “I don’t know about that now, you’re the one with the royal links.” Greg moved his hands to cup Mycroft’s face. “I don’t want to start the new chapter of my life by running scared, Mycroft. I want to stand by your side and protect what we hold dear.”
Sherlock regarded the watch silently for a few minutes before looking back to John clearly bewildered.
John heard it but he wasn’t listening, he was remembering his dream and the words his phantom version of Sherlock had whispered in his ear;
‘Well her uncle Mycroft and my friend Greg, they’ve nipped out to get some things for her, bottles, formula the whole thing. I guess they’ll probably buy food too, isn’t there a terrible story about someone mashing bananas and sweet potatoes together, I think I heard that somewhere but if it’s what she wants then I can mash all the things.’
‘Did you know a honey bee had five eyes and can see ultra violet light?’ John can’t see the owner of the voice but its female,
‘Is that it then? You’ve decreed and therefore it will be?’ he can see the tears threatening but he is set on this. It must be John Watson and the reason is clear. Moving forwards the seats himself on the table so he and John can be on the same level.
“Yeah I know, but I don’t think it’s healthy. What about Mina? She’s going to have questions when she grows up and what am I going to say: ‘Sorry, sweetie, your real daddy is dead and none of us know who your mum is. Also none of us speak about your dad because it’s bloody painful because some of us loved him and never got to say it.’”
‘I can’t do this.’ The words passed through his lips without thought, so quiet he isn't convinced she can hear him.
It's been less than a week! What is this madness! Here's a slightly longer chapter which is mostly dialogue but it's rather nice to have a little calm before the explosion of drama which the next chapter is turning into.
Dutifully Mina stretched down towards him and with a slight crouch from Greg Mina was transferred to John’s hip. She snuggled into his side, ending up with her loose curls tucked under his chin, one hand wrapped tightly in his scarf and the other curled in front of her mouth. John felt the hand moving and could picture her running her thumb lightly across her bottom lip just as she did before falling asleep each evening. He had wondered, on the first few occasions that he had noticed it, right in the middle of their more melancholy initial weeks, why she would do this so religiously. It was not that self soothing was so unusual for children Mina’s age, it was more that at that point anything John deemed to be stifling her making noise put him on edge. Now he accepted it as one of her quirks; something unconscious she did to make herself happy or calm and John would support any and every one of those. Her GP had informed him, with good humour, that it was possible he was over analysing the behaviour of his eighteen month old but he refused to see it that way.
All praise, cat gifs and pictures of Paul McGann to my beautiful Beta Ruby who helps me maintain some semblance of sanity and bolsters my poor grammatical knowledge and poor concentration with phrases like; 'You've said that word 20 times in this chapter alone, pick a new word.' Any mistakes that remain are my own and I humbly ask your forgiveness for them dear readers.
‘Your father would have been so proud of you baby, we both love you so much’ he knows it’s true, whatever comes after this life, wherever Sherlock is, he’d be so proud today and he also knows he’d have been as besotted with their daughter as he is every day.
“If Sherlock failed to jump, if he didn’t kill himself, we would all die. That’s what Moriarty did; he threatened us?”
‘John there you are, I can’t find my crown have you seen it,’ she was dressed in brown leggings, riding boots and a long sleeved, loose fitting cream top.  Over the entire outfit suggest her theme was going to be historical this Friday but he couldn’t decipher which story or character she would be playing. He hoped he didn’t have to talk her out of a rendition of the latest Game of Thrones book, he couldn’t imagine that sitting well with the parents that attended along with their children,
They were drawing up to the car park now; one of the agents was navigating placing Mina in her car seat under the watchful gaze of Mrs Hudson. John could see the tail end of his scarf where it spilled over the edge of her car seat. She really was a deep sleeper.
“Darling Gregory, I would be your guide any day. Perhaps you would enjoy taking my direction?” Mycroft asked with a tone of faux innocence. The hint of laughter was still present in his voice and Greg liked to picture him grinning down the other end of the phone.
“Mr Mitrović, you’re wasting my time, I already know about your boss’ obsession and about my brother’s descent into heroism, if you can’t be interesting I’m sure Interpol will have more to say to you than I do.”
He feels the cool hand on the back of his neck and the soft baritone of Sherlock’s voice in his ear before he registers the other man’s imposing presence.
They all took some time to digest this information; Greg came to stand beside John so he could look at the picture as well.
John let Greg digest what was apparently a surprising reaction and contented himself with looking over what part of the grounds he could still see.  This far out from the city a scattering of stars were visible.
‘John, look, I don’t know you, not really and I don’t know her,’ Lisa points to the baby who’s started pulling the fabric of John’s jumper before releasing it to pat his neck. He was worried she was trying to tell him something before he’d looked down and realised she was fascinated by the slightly raised knit of the jumpers design, he decided it was some form of game and left her to her repetition, he decided if he wanted out of his arms she’d wriggle or in some way attempt escape but before then he intended to cling to the warmth and reassuring weight he felt with her in his arms ‘But I’m just going to say this because I think you’re lovely and she deserves someone lovely. You can’t replace Sherlock with Mina, this baby, she may have part of him in her but she’s brand new, she’s not him and you shouldn’t want her to be.’ He’d known that was how he’d sounded but it was never how he’d felt;
‘My father is not like me no, nor is he like Sherlock.’ Mycroft tilts his empty glass so it catches the artificial glow coming from the solar powered garden lights lining the veranda’s wall behind him, ‘my father is something rare in our family, you see he is kind, very naturally kind, he is a warm and loving human being who is completely devoted to his family, always has been. He never failed to be nurturing for either of his sons, we were never put in a position to doubt his affection and high regard for us. He can be a quiet man, quite the opposite of my mother; he contemplates his sentiments and statements thoroughly before stating them, which means he sometimes appears aloof. Nothing could be further from the truth however,’
Mycroft stood stiffly beside her. They had arranged for a safe house for the women but they had judged the children to be safe if they kept them together in the city. Clearly they had been mistaken.
‘Ah well the question is, John do you know about Sherlock’s final stay in a rehabilitation centre,’ Mycroft continued with his tea, the information he was sharing touched a deeply personal portion of Sherlock’s life yet here they were discussing it over tea. John felt himself sneering; the desire to tell Mycroft he’d caused enough damage by sharing Sherlock’s secrets already on the tip of his tongue, but this was a story he wanted to hear, even if It meant betraying his memory of Sherlock, he needed data and to be honest with himself he wanted to know more about the man he’d lost. So he held his tongue and allowed himself to make eye contact with Mycroft once more.
‘It is very kind of you to offer John but I have albums similar to this at my home, my mother goes through phases of interest in certain pastimes, a few years ago it was photo albums and she made two for both of us. I’m not sure what the third one could be but perhaps a notebook rather than something containing photographs? I fail to imagine Sherlock continuing our mother’s diversions.’
“I think he is D.I. Lestrade, it’s so hard for him some days and I do my best to help but really I think it’s Mina that makes him better. She’s a reason for him to be happy and to keep going rather than getting caught up in his grief. He cried so much at the start, when you first bought her home to him, he didn’t think he could do this, not without Sherlock, but look at him. He’s thrived with parenting her and just look at her. Isn’t she so different? She smiles all the time now, every morning when I go up to say hello she’s there with a smile and those few sharp teeth.”
‘Come inside John’ he left the doorway and moving back into the darkened corridor where D.I. Lestrade had been watching the battle of wills from a few steps up the staircase. The light crooning of a radio could be heard coming from the properties other occupant, one Mrs. Hudson, former client of Sherlock, former exotic dancer, former drug barons’ wife, she was always an interesting character, who overall filled the role of mother hen for all those she deemed worthy. Her love would be a valuable tool in the coming months and Mycroft would do what was necessary to keep her happy.
‘What would reassure you Vi? Mina has a doctor for a father, not to mention an uncle whose influence could get her pushed to the head of any waiting list; I think we have fallen into focussing too much on the negative darling. We promised we would try not to do that remember?’ John had released her hands so Siger could hold them once more.
‘You’re Gay! Oh well I guess that makes sense then. No don’t go getting worried it doesn’t matter, I’m bisexual and you’re not the only gay member of the team. We don’t care who you fancy as long as you work hard.’ The man looks relieved and Greg wonders if maybe this conversation was because Danny was worried about the comments people made about the MET being homophobic, Greg knows it’s true in some departments but it would never be in his, his sexuality had never stopped him doing a job why would he think it would stop anyone else, ‘Look Danny I know it’s a bit awkward around some of the other blokes sometimes because the banters very heteronormative but you don’t need to fret, throw back comments about blokes and no one will bat an eye lid, you’re a good copper Danny, your sexuality doesn’t change a bit of the respect I have for you. You’re going to do great work and we’re going to help you. You don’t need to hide who you are.’
‘I can’t,’ having now entered the room John’s knees seem to give out around the edge of the sofa. ‘What do we do?’
‘Don’t worry you’re merely educating her in proper entertainment from a young age’ Tammy offers Mina the cuddly Spok, Mina considers him while chewing the ear of the Ewok, that they’re now going to have to buy, letting go of her death grip on John’s jumper she reaches with her other arm bringing Spok close to her other side, she doesn’t relinquish the Ewok but ponders her new toy steadily, John wonders if the attention is being paid to the fact the squat toy looks vaguely human or the frankly huge pointed ears which adorn the sides of its head.
I yawned in agreement, allowing the magic to wash over me. If the major elementals were involved, merfolk, dragons, griffons, phoenixes, as well as a Unicorn, I’d be just fine, so far as appearance goes. My clothes would say what they needed to say, and I’d have gold and jewels, courtesy of the dragons. The local elementals would know me, and the Unicorn’s magic would tell them why I was there, if they didn’t know already. All I would need to worry about was the threat the Unicorn spoke of.
Father Simeon left the church, leaving a few candles burning behind him. I could sense a pair of salamanders keeping an eye on them, and begrudgingly felt myself start to respect this priest. I didn’t want to, it felt wrong, somehow, wanting to trust a man who served an organization that hunted my kind.
Holmes was at table when Watson arrived for breakfast. He watched Watson out of the corner of his eye as the man sat down, immediately reaching for the jam jar. Holmes nodded, satisfied. He handed over the letter he’d gotten in reply from Father Simeon as Watson started on his toast.
I sighed, leaning back against the tree, one arm across my eyes. I had to get a nosy salamander. “Fight. It’s what I’m for.”
“Well, I’ll leave you to your unpacking. I’ll send down to the village, see if the priest is available for dinner tomorrow night.”
He slowed his mad rush when he saw the old shepherd’s cottage. It was small, and part of the roof had fallen in, but it would serve for now.
A few lines to Mycroft were sufficient to outline the issue, and lay out his request. The kindest thing he could do for the pair would be to smooth the way to the dissolution of their marriage, and Mycroft could ease that considerably more than he could.
The sylphs coiled in the air before one dashed off. The rest separated to go their different ways, leaving one twining about his wrist.
Holmes settled on the balustrade, setting the sack beside him and pulling a notebook from his pocket.
Holmes stopped, opening a door and gesturing for Watson to precede him in. Watson entered the room, barely registering a servant stepping up to whisper something to Holmes. It was a large room, with tall, French-style windows opening onto a small balcony. The bed was a large four-poster, curtains pulled back revealing a feather mattress. There were bookcases, crammed full of books and loose papers, the closest surmounted with a stuffed goose.
The horde grew supernaturally still. Even the mortal birds and insects grew silent an a Unicorn stepped into the clearing.
He raised a brow at the sylph’s message, but nodded. He gave the driver of the hansom the address of the Arcadian Club and settled back, idly wondering what the summons was about.
“Well, he’s welcome to stay here as long as he needs to. I’ll have some notes to send off shortly.” He paused in his writing to glance up the stairs. “I’m taking the liberty of asking Drs. Anstruther and Jackson to see to Watson’s practice for the next few weeks, at least.”
I stopped, confused. Watson gestured to the table behind me and I turned. There lay my copies of the complete Sherlock Holmes books. I grinned.
He swore at that, abandoning the robe and reaching for the first pair of trousers that came to hand.
No packs. No wolves for hundreds of miles, at least. Any territory that large would have been filled before too long. Keeps the mages in line, and the infighting down. But if I was truly the only wolfwalker in the world….
“Once I was inside that room, I was to be raped regularly, until I was pregnant.” I couldn’t stop the frisson of fear that went through me at the thought. “Once the pup was born, the process would repeat. I was expected to remain there until I either died in childbirth, or was no longer capable of breeding.”
Holmes laughed. “Father Simeon has a proposal to turn my family’s home to an orphanage. I came to see if the plan had any merit.”
<You are accustomed to being alone. You have the strength to save this world. There, you will find a destiny worthy of you.> The endless blue eye twinkled. <And more, should you so desire.>
<Wolfwalker. Hunter. Lost child of the Pack. You are powerful, with the potential to be more.> The Unicorn angled its head, studying me with one endless blue eye. <We could use you, in a way your pack could not.>
No, Mary had never held all of his heart. If he was honest with himself, she never held it at all. It was Holmes’s, fully and completely.
I wasn’t made for subtle tracing like this. I sighed and dropped all my defenses. There was something south and west, minor, but coming this way. Close enough I should keep an eye out. But east… There was something huge, and evil, crouched east of here. I couldn’t tell you what it was, or where, exactly. But it was bad. I tried to focus on it, but it vanished.
But, no. None of the elementals I’d seen or sensed today had that sense of fear. No. This strange mage was likely either here for a social call, which had nothing to do with me, or he was hunting whatever I was sent here to deal with. Nothing more.
I noticed Holmes wince slightly at that. Ah, well. Not everyone is easy with the knowledge that everyone wants them dead.
So. The big house, where the money was. Newly arrived mage, probably wealthy. Either he was hunting the same thing I was, or he was hunting me. Likely we had the same prey. I doubted the elementals would alert mages to my presence.
I headed out of the door, walking around to the crates. I sat, considering Davy’s hiding spot, then sighed again. I took a step forward, gently biting the back of his jacket and pulling him free.
Fox lay on one side, breathing lightly. He was lying, half-wrapped in an old sheet. Watson winced at the sheer amount of blood seeping through the sheet into the carriage itself. He sent a brief tendril of a question down the bond, then sighed.
They entered, taking a moment to allow their eyes to adjust to the dim light after the full sun of the early afternoon. Holmes quickly scanned the pub, making a mental tally of the villagers. One brought him up short, and he stopped on the stair, studying them. He registered Watson coming up short as well, but set that aside in favor of his study.
“From what I can see, it does follow its own internal logic. I’m certain it would be a simple matter to sort it out, and add it to my criminal knowledge.”
“But that would be my strength, not yours. I’ll start looking.” I studied my plate, then sighed. “How much will my appearance offend the town, anyway? I mean, I’ll wear the dresses if I need to, but I’d prefer the greater range of motion that trousers would give me.”
He was gratified to hear a weak chuckle in reply.  “No, you haven’t come close to repaying that, old friend.”
“Either some of the caves, or an abandoned shepherd’s hut, south and west of here. Most likely the hut. People who go in for the nastier magics like their comforts.” I turned to Watson. “Look, there’s a slim chance I can take this guy alone, but it’s always easier with someone at my back. I don’t have a pack, and you’re the best I got.”
I slowed, checking the sky. Damn. If I wanted to do this dinner, I had to turn back. I scanned the horizon, annoyed. No sign of that cottage.
Father Simeon smiled. “I am well aware of what your kind has suffered. I am also aware of why you were sent. I know my skills do not lie in the direction you need, but I am sworn to protect my flock.”
I snorted. <I’m a wolfwalker. I’ve always been able to do this. Now, you know there’s something evil around here. I need to find it.>
I folded the paper, staring at it. Several artifacts, not yet categorized, had been stolen from the British Museum. And one of them was a wolfwalker tome of our lore.
It was raining. I sneezed myself awake, then shook the water from my fur. It didn’t do any good, of course, since there were still sheets of rain falling, but it finished waking me up.
He met my glare with a mild look, and I huffed out a breath, annoyed. I hate when people didn’t tell me everything.
He reached out, but none of the sylphs came to his call. He climbed out of bed, unease growing as a salamander climbed atop the embers in the grate.
That seemed to encourage the others. They swarmed around me, shouting their names as they each tried to get my attention first.
He could feel the warmth of John’s breath the instant before their lips met. He forced himself to keep his eyes open, to engrave every instant of this moment across his heart.
Watson nodded slowly. “Possibly some novice heading along the darker path. I’ll mention it to Holmes, see if I can pique his interest.” He yawned, the day suddenly catching up with him. “Sorry. I’ll drop by Baker Street in the morning.”
I lay back with a sigh. “Alright, lesson time.” I shot Watson a look. “I’d appriciate it if you kept this information away from your council, but I do understand if you’ve got to tell them.”
I had barely managed to get free of the boulder when the troll plowed into it. I waited, swaying slightly, but it didn’t emerge.
"I’m sorry, Doctor. I didn’t know that would hurt you. If you need to speak to someone uninvolved, feel free to send a sylph.”
I could smell the amusement off the two men, and about half the pub, honestly, as they looked toward Davy. I met their eyes over Davy’s head and flashed a grin. Sherlock tried to hide his smile in return, but Watson grinned fully.
“My father sold me to one of his cronies, the moment he knew how strong I was going to be. Not- not like an arranged marriage thing. It-” I took a breath, staring at the goose. “On the day of my sixteenth birthday, I was to be drugged and taken to my father’s friend’s home. There was a room prepared. It had no windows, and no latch on the inside. There was a chain and a manacle set into one wall. The only other things in it were a bed and a bucket to relieve myself.”
You did manage to recover enough of the Agra treasure that I can afford this divorce and move on with my own life. I simply ask that you do not interfere.
‘No don’t, God I’m a fool, it doesn’t matter, pretend it didn’t happen, please, just.’ Danny turns and leaves and Greg doesn’t stop him.
‘Mother if you could find it in yourself to stop the pacing my hearth rug would surely appreciate it’ the frankly withering stare he received in way of an answer had him pouring a far more generous measure of wine into the glass he was preparing for her.
‘In that case you simply must call me Violet; I hope you are ready for dinner John it seems Mycroft’s planning left little time for socialising before our meal, but perhaps you  intend to stay afterwards for drinks,’
‘John. Although sentiment brings few advantages to my life I feel myself moved to actions under its influence when it comes to our relationship. This journal being but one example.
Greg thought that might be the first time he’d ever heard Mycroft sound uncertain when making a proposal. He didn’t know how he really felt about the idea of staying in Mycroft’s home though. He’d just handed his wife divorce papers and the idea of then wrapping himself in the comfort of Mycroft’s presence, perhaps even arms, made him feel a little seedy.
‘Oh, um, yes, yes I do’ he waits for the young man to light up but he just stands there his arms wrapped tightly across his chest, he seems nervous, Greg thinks he might be about to be asked for Sally’s number or relationship status or something just as awkward already preparing a speech about how fraternizing amongst team members is risky and how Sally is older than him, ‘I forgot mine in the office, can I borrow one?’ Greg reaches for his packet and after Danny selects one he holds up his lighter while the young man pulls in a mouthful of the smoke, he splutters on the exhale and Greg wonders if they’re stronger than he’s used to, he’s been meaning to cut down on the tar, he likes the ones he’s shared with Mycroft on occasion, they leave him with a smoother taste than the ones he’s used to.
He set himself up as advised; in the back bedroom of the first floor, he called Mycroft again while searching out a wardrobe to save his suit from insurmountable wrinkles.
“He always had the worst timing,” John said, remembering his last date with Sarah; they’d been kissing on her sofa, it had been going well and John was feeling confident the condom he’d slipped in his wallet had been anything but presumptive when his phone had started buzzing across the table. He’d pulled away initially, but not far and the second it stopped he had found it easy enough to drop back into his kissing mind set, but after the forth buzz his curiosity had won out. What followed was ten minutes of back and forth texting. Sarah removing their glasses of wine without him realising, and when he finally did look up he found her smiling sadly holding his jacket for him. He took that as a hint but also knew that if he left then he wouldn’t get another chance with her. He still didn’t regret leaving. Sarah was a wonderful woman but they hadn’t been right for each other and he shouldn’t have been trying to fool himself.
‘Yeah, he’s the Dr. James we’ve all been hearing about, we’ve not got his real name yet but we’re running his prints for any other aliases. He took Summers down with one blow but we’re thinking that was by surprise, Sammy must have seen him, hence the scream I guess.’  It’s as good a guess as any before they get the forensics report. Four men walk into the closed off hallway, this section of the hospital has been closed off for police and official personnel only, they’re wearing thick black overcoats, crisp white shirts and trousers with such precise creases that Greg thinks they must be uncomfortable. Sally notices them too, sitting back slightly in her chair and eyeing their movements, two move to the end of the corridor and stop, the other two stay near the doors to the ward bracketing the doorway. They don’t move. They don’t speak. They don’t even make eye contact with Greg or Sally. They just stand like guards. Sally’s face is slowly devolving into anger but Greg grasps her hand,
‘When the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies.’ Mina’s laughter never failed to improve his move, it shone like a beacon though his grief had done since that first day, and John thought he had never known a more magical sound.
He’d started making up stories for her at bed time when she was restless, he based them on his and Sherlock’s adventures but re-enacted with animals. He’d yet to fix on a set animal as the lead characters but they added a nice variety for the nights when he was trying to sooth her back to sleep but was too tiered to read. She seemed to enjoy spoken word sounds above music; he’d tried her with nursery rhymes and classical music but fought sleep harder on those occasions.
“Well it needs to because if not I’m going to call your boss and cause a massive fucking problem. I’m guessing that if whatever is happening is bad enough for us to be redirected, this government issued car to be judged non-secure and for Greg to get a phone call about some unknown criminal being deported, my calling Mycroft Holmes and having a fit isn’t going to help any.”
It is with a heavy head and a heavier heart that John shuffles the few steps up to the front door of 221b Baker Street and he considers knocking and waking Mrs Hudson for all of thirty seconds, before dismissing the idea as bad manners, because the idea of having to rummage through his pockets to find his keys’ seems like far too much effort. He instead chooses to rest his forehead against the cool rain damp painted wood and wait for Sherlock who he can hear paying the taxi driver behind him to walk up and reach around John to unlock and push open the door.
‘Forensics on scene now, back up is on route, sir I think it would be wise for you to seek medical assistance now, the scene is secure, officers have completed a second sweep,’
Thank you so much to my beautiful Beta Ruby. I could find you a million cat Gif's and it would never be enough *air kisses*
‘You’re so wonderful, my beautiful Mina, so smart, Daddy’s so proud of you baby, God, my little dove,’ he whispers these to her and she pats his cheek in response. She’s always so happy when they engage like this, John hopes she always loves cuddles this much because he can’t imagine a time when he won’t want to keep her close.
“Come on little dove say something for the camera,” that was Tammy; John had been highly amused by the women’s determination.  The clip he’s showing them is one of four from this morning alone but it’s the one with the best moment,
“I know, you’re not alone in that, we all loved him Myc. No one is going to get to any of us. Trust us just like we trust you.”
She does so with a gasp, inside are three typed up outlines for stories based on his cases with Sherlock and a complete copy of A Study in Pink, rewritten in his 1920’s universe. He’d found it easier than he expected to get lost in a fictional world and the period research he needed to do for the case rewrite.  ‘Are you serious right now?’ John nods his head while Tammy breaks out in a happy dance. He catches her as she flings herself at him, she’s an awkward height for this type of hug bug he appreciates the sentiment.
“The Knight loved the Prince and the Prince loved the Knight. This was their big secret but it should never have been a secret because love is never ever a bad thing. But the Prince sent the Knight away to save one of their favourite people and the Knight, because he was brave now, because the Prince had made him better, he went to save the day, but the Prince had tricked him.
‘This one’s amazing’ John crouches to get a closer look at the material but as he does so he notices Mina stretch out a hand and touch the wing gently, she looks mesmerised by both the light and the swirling pattern on the wings,
‘How about the part where I’m now to be responsible for another human being? I know nothing about children? How am I supposed to raise one? How am I supposed to love someone when I can’t even love myself? You haven’t even told me how you now know she’s his? How Mycroft? You can’t swan in here and demand I change my life because you suddenly have someone else you need me to care for!’
‘I am not comfortable but such emotional scenes, I am sure this is no surprise to you but all the same I should explain that it is worse with my mother. Her emotions have such extremes, she is sometimes so very out of control and I have a strong dislike for such illogical reactions. This evening for example, she knew all of that information and yet still, that was her reaction. It is impossible to have a serious conversation with her when she is like this.’ Mycroft is breathing heavily after the outburst, his voice has risen by such a degree that John is glad his mother’s bedroom is at the back of the house.
‘They’re likely undercover officers come to secure the location and the witnesses, you know this happens sometimes.’ He can tell she’s still bristling but she makes no more moves to confront the men.
Mycroft pauses here, he’s clearly extremely uncomfortable, John can’t say anything about the last  two hours has been pleasant for him either but this must be more complicated for Mycroft. There’s a certain undercurrent to his relationship with his mother, clear adoration on one level and something like bitterness as well. The two juxtapose each other to such a degree that their interactions seem stilted. John had wondered if it was merely the presence of a stranger in their midst but it’s becoming steadily clearer that the two have some unresolved issues.
“With all due respect sir, no he does not. Detective Inspector, this is a matter of national security and we are not in a secure location. I am authorised to confiscate any and all methods of communication you have but I have held back from doing so out of courtesy. Mr. Holmes does not want you to feel like prisoners.”
Saturday morning started as it always did; early morning wake up, Mina not understanding the pretence of a weekend lie-in, followed by stories in John’s bed until their stomachs grumbled and he was certain their movements in the kitchen and living room wouldn’t wake Mrs. Hudson. She’d been fast asleep in John’s chair when he’d returned the previous evening, tea cup and saucer balancing precariously on the side table while the baby monitor was nestled next to her side.
‘She could have, I acknowledge that, however it has always struck me as odd the timing of Sherlock’s actions as well as the manner, he made the effort to get clean and I imagine this is why. This child, perhaps not in a solid form but the idea of her, of a child, my brother may have worn a facade of ice but he adored children, their natural curiosity and sense of adventure, he would have jumped at the chance to be a father, lost his heart over the idea of his child being in the world. I do not doubt this.’
The draw was full to bursting with costumes, more appropriately disguises, he recognised some; the hideous traffic warden outfit, the more memorable fireman and something that looked to closely resemble a bee keepers outfit minus the hat. In fact they were all minus hats, on a mission now to complete the disguises john pulls the chair resting by the desk in front of the wardrobe, standing on it he scans the top shelf until he sees likely looking boxes, he pulls them down before wrestling with the lid on one while trying to hold the other steady, his sense of balance being slightly off both boxes fall to the floor intermingling multiple hats and what looks to John’s eyes to be loose photographs and albums.
So she has significant connections but that's not why she's interesting. She has been working with her family, under the protective pretense of their pharmaceutical company, to develop a new methamphetamine compound that would improve the purity of their product.
With the front door closing solidly and Mrs Hudson taking herself off for a quick sit down in her own living room, John thought the whole experience may have taken more out of her than any of the rest of them, John was faced by an empty flat, he’d not been alone here for months but the space didn’t look as oppressive anymore. In all honesty the only place John felt uncomfortable was the room at the end of the corridor he was now facing. Truly accepting this space as his, removing Sherlock’s eclectic belongings and replacing them with his own seemed unfair somehow, insulting almost. He entered the room slowly, watching the dust motes swirl in the early evening light he tried to truly see the space objectively but it seemed impossible.
“Alright. The first of my question concerns your ex-husband.” Mycroft took a photograph out of the folder he had been carrying, showing it to Mrs. Hudson who took it gingerly to consider three men walking down a street. John could distinguish nothing special about them. One looked to be significantly older than the other two and all three men were well built and stocky.
“Alright Sally, I understand what you’re saying. Just keep me in the loop if you hear anything more. Do we have strong cases for the ones we’re keeping?” Greg shook his head slightly before hanging up his phone.
‘Greg it’s not possible, why are you doing this? Do you feel bad or something? Is this some kind of joke? Is it Donovan?’ Greg noticed the twist of hatred that covered the doctor's face at the use of his sergeant's name, Greg thinks it is odd how when the results had come through Donovan had made no comment, she had said nothing, her face had been a mask of shock. She had tried handling the girl herself when they had found her hidden behind that cabinet, one of the other children admitted to hiding her when specific clients had come into the derelict building, but the young child had fought so hard against Donovan's grip that she had been forced to hand her over quickly to P.C. Osborn who had pulled the girl against her chest and held her tight while they exited the building.
Light footfalls pass through the snows of the Siberian woods. A thin figure moves unseen through the shadows as if made of the nights air itself. It stops for a moment between two tall trees to catch its breath, the small clouds of white proving the figure to be a mortal man and one that is running as if the figure of death were chasing him.
Tammy swings her legs while humming a tune John once again recognises but can’t place, it pulls him back to his childhood but instead of questioning her he smiles and strolls, plates in hand, to the living room. Tammy bounces to the television ensuring the set up is complete before flopping on the sofa next to John, he’s not seen her this excited since he’d mentioned his teen obsession with Princess Leia, both the gold bikini and the badass attitude of the leading Star Wars lady.
‘Yes, Mycroft told me, I’m sure we can organise something. I just wanted the chance to meet you first, maybe answer your questions. I don’t like to talk about certain topics in front of her.’
‘Physically, yes, you will know of course that she has scars on parts of her body,’ Violet moves to clasp her husband’s hand tightly, Mycroft had shared this information with them but in his experience it is still very difficult to hear, ‘they have healed as well as can be expected and apart from that the issues when she first came into my care concerned nutrition, those have been for the most part corrected. She no longer has any vitamin deficiencies and has moved on to a diet of solid foods,  this week she is particularly taken with bananas,’ John throws a small grin in Mycroft’s direction, it is true that he has been ensuring abundances of any item Mina seems to favour, ‘Mentally the situation is more complicated, she has nightmares, as she continues to have minimal verbal communication skills finding out their contents is near impossible, certain situations seem to cause a variation of an anxiety attack, in her case this manifests as screaming or occasionally silent crying. She is a highly affectionate child, but her doctor has suggested she may have a form of separation anxiety,’ Mycroft watches as his mother systematically folds one of the lace handkerchiefs she always carries with her,
All of you have been so amazing and I love that this little fic has people following it. I started this with no confidence and i've grown with everyone of your clicks, kudos and subscriptions. I adore each of you and you make my day a little better every time you interact with this world so thank you, thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart.
‘I guess something simple, Gin and Tonic if you have it. Oh and I bought wine, I wasn’t sure what was being made for dinner but this one was recommended to me.’ He hands over the bottle and watched Mycroft appraise it with a small smile. He accepts the tall glass before following his host through the glass doors outside. The evening is cool but not unpleasant, John’s glad to see the seating area also has a heater though, November isn’t the month he’d generally hold anything outdoors, but when Mycroft digs a packet of cigarettes from a pocket inside his suit jacket John realises it’s not necessarily for comfort that they’re out here, they take sides on opposite edges of a square glass table that forms the centre of a seating area they reach.
‘Dinner sounds delightful, please lead the way’, Violet slips her hand onto John’s arm as the pair leave the drawing room, his mother had pushed for the formal dining room to be arranged and Mycroft had felt no great desire to oppose her wishes, it did mean they would be four eating at a table suitable for twelve but he supposed his staff would have found a way to make the space less imposing.
The evening draws to a natural conclusion there, Siger bids John farewell with a tight handshake and a few muttered words about ensuring Mina reads books on botany before heading upstairs. Mycroft and John linger a little longer, while a car is organised and Mycroft completes the transfer of his chosen files.
The radios have all been turned to their lowest settings; they’re effectively in stealth conditions until their presence is declared;
“Because what is a more vicious motivator than revenge. She is young and beautiful. The perfect target for kidnapping, powerful and rich family, a tragic back story. Her image in relation to some terrible tragedy, can you not see it John. It would break the country’s hearts and incite terror.”
John thought about making the same excuses he always had; Sherlock needed him, he would only end up getting hurt and John would have to patch him up, John was a medical expert and that was helpful on murder cases. But no, if he was being honest then none of those were the real reason.
One of the key messages of his childhood summed up in a sentence. His Mother and Grandfather had instilled the importance of appearance to both himself and Sherlock from the age they could understand such concepts. His Mother was possessed of a natural elegance which spoke to her years of ballet and an overwhelming charm she had perfected to blend more smoothly with British Society.
The chapter is also a complete beast, lots of background for relevant characters and some brand new people to meet, I hope you all love Siger as much as I do. I've divided it into two parts and the second half will be up later this week, in the next few days hopefully. I'm including a link to a twitter i've set up for my writing at the bottom, if there's ever going to be a delay in me posting i'll mention it there. Feel free to come say hi :)
‘The man you caught is a criminal known in most circles as Mr. Red,’ Greg snorts at the name, what is this some second rate detective show from the eighties, Mycroft spares his a short look as one corner of his mouth hints slightly at a smile, ‘Perhaps clichéd for a member of a Russian mob but stand assured he responsible for great acts of evil, you did the world a service Gregory, I could not be more sorry that two of your team members had to pay such a high price for a little more peace in the world.’ The words shouldn’t make him feel any better, nothing’s changed, but Mycroft’s voice does calm him, his mind feels more settled when he’s in the man’s presence. He moves to a crouch in front of Mycroft’s chair, his hand reaching out to capture the younger mans and bring it to his lips. Mycroft’s smile grows slightly but it still doesn’t reach his eyes. Mycroft shifts forwards in his seat to run strong fingers through his hair, the look he wares is full of what Greg identifies as adoration, he's flawed once again at this man's capacity to make him feel wanted,
‘I’m sure this weekend will work well John, thank you.’ He moves to the kitchen to collect his jacket, his visits don’t tend to last long and John will be glad to be free to return to his day, the laundry, although now expertly organised, needs placing in relevant draws and he’d thought about trying to organise the toys in the living room into something resembling order.
“Yeah, well, Mr. Holmes just royally screwed me over so honestly I’m not in the mood to do him any favours. And it’s Detective Inspector Lestrade, not Mr, I worked damn hard to get the title I have.”
“He wanted to live with the Knight but the Knight didn’t know why because the Knight didn’t see himself the way the Prince did. The Knight didn’t think he was brave anymore but the Prince knew differently. He took the Knight with him on his adventures and they climbed buildings and fought monsters and became the very best of friends. But they both had a big secret. It was so big that the Knight didn’t even know he knew it!”
“You ready to go to war?” Greg turned his head to send a wink to John who simply raised an eyebrow in confusion.
Mycroft chuckled in response but Greg was at least proud it sounded a little stuttered. “You don’t know how much I’m looking forward to discovering them Gregory.” They both paused, caught in their own imaginations; Greg’s taking him back to the moment they shared in Mycroft’s office, the scene continuing past the moment it had to include the DI being bent over a desk. Mycroft was the one to break the retrospective imaginings. “But for now I need you to take a left and then a sharp right. You’ll be on the right street then, stop outside the house with the forest green door. An agent will open the property for you in a few moments.”
Somewhere near his sleeping area a phone was ringing, that annoying Nokia tone, it repeated over and over again. John cracks his eyes slightly only to find them forced closed by the blinding light.
“‘Sir Knight, Sir Knight,’ the friend called and the knight stopped and talked to the man, who asked him how he liked the city. The Knight said he liked it very much but wanted to live somewhere else. What the Knight didn’t tell his friend was that he was very lonely and he missed his fellow knights very much.
But inside this room John was creating a haven; the lights were dimmed and classical music poured out of the Bluetooth speakers Mycroft had provided for him. He sat with Mina grousing at being moved and woken again and hummed along with the tune he recognised from nights of Sherlock and the violin.
“It’s dangerous for her though, it’s dangerous for all of you. Being loved by a Holmes, it makes you all targets.”
‘I don’t ever forget what she’s been through Mycroft’ he says it quietly because he doesn’t have it in him to yell, not about this, misplacing his anger at Mycroft was a mistake he’d made months ago when it came to Sherlock but with this there was no just cause.
If he felt a modicum of guilt for how far things had gone with Mycroft they were quickly smothered by his wife’s bedraggled appearance. She wasn’t even bothering to hide the wadded up underwear in her coat pocket and honestly Greg’s tolerance had come to an end.
Descending the stairs he poked his head into the sitting room only to witness the two men sitting with their knees touching, Mycroft his head clasped in the palms of his hands, Lestrade had moved to touch the slightly younger mans shoulders. John wondered how he’d missed this relationship, this interaction between two people he’d thought to know. Moving backwards as silently as possible he called from the corridor, hopefully creating the illusion of the pairs continued privacy, that Mycroft should instruct his men to remove the bed from the top bedroom. He was only slightly surprised to hear Greg’s voice answer in Mycroft’s place;
“Dada”  and there it was, he watched Mycroft’s face dissolve into shock as he dragged his finger across the screen to have it play again, which it did, Siger was wearing a grin the likes of which John wouldn’t have imagined a Holmes could make,  Mycroft moves to play the moment again but John raises his hand to stop him,
‘No offence Greg but you’re really not,’ he meets his juniors eye, there’s nothing but sympathy and sadness there. Greg doesn’t know whether he can bring himself to be angry with that man.
Mycroft repressed his initial reaction, he wanted to recoil, to express his disgust at the man’s words, but Mycroft knew this was the response the man wanted.
He handed me the paper. I scanned the headlines and pictures, trying to figure out what he was driving at.
He glanced around the pub, trying to spot the wolf hiding among the civilians. No luck. The villagers were paying no more attention to the pair than any group would to two strangers entering a pub at lunch. Wildly, he considered bolting, but the half-ignored words of his sylph gave him pause.
Well, it looked like I was right. He was just visiting Holmes’s mom alongside Sherlock. No biggie. I just needed to keep my head down and-
I bared my teeth in a grin. <Exactly. However, if the newly formed packs are in the Crown’s employ….>
I wrapped the blanket around me, getting comfortable as I began my search. Faint flashes of magic in the town, nothing major and nothing I could get my teeth into. A soulshifter would be able to tell more.
“I know how it sounds, Holmes, but you need to trust me.” He turned to the fireplace. “Can you tell me where Mr. Hunter is now?”
I was exhausted, poisoned, wounded, and weakened. Any time something like this had happened before, it was taken out by a full pack. I was just one wolf. Going on, continuing this fight, it was suicide. There were several mages over at Shanbrook. They had been scrying me since the sylph, as well. I could leave this mage to his fellows. No one would blame me for taking off.
I can no longer stand the secrets, and the lies. Nor can I stand knowing that he will always value you far more than he ever does myself. I will not abide being constantly cast aside. I know that asking him to leave you would harm him far more than it would hurt you, and so I will not bother. The only consideration I have for you is the knowledge that I would never have met John if it were not for you. Sometimes that is enough.
Holmes raised an eyebrow coldly. “I think you’ll find I can. Fox is a guest in my home, and you are not.”
I was in a copse of trees. Not the one I’d fallen asleep in, but that was to be expected. A pack was lying close to hand, tucked under a bush. It wasn’t the one the brownies had taken, but I supposed it was the one I needed. I raised my head, trying to scent where I was. No good. The rain and petrichor drowned out everything else unless I was practically on top of it. I shrugged and joined the pack under the bush. There were no people nearby, and I could figure out what I was supposed to be doing when it cleared up.
Holmes coughed, somewhat embarrassed. “That one was something of a terror when Mycroft and I were boys. Mother had it stuffed and mounted, to assure us it was truly gone.”
We ranged over the hills around the town, giving me plenty of opportunities to seek out the hidden danger. I managed to narrow it down to a small area when my stomach growled, much to my companions’ amusement.
Sherlock Holmes was sprawled in his chair, absently dragging the bow across the strings of his Stradivari. His most recent case had come to a close rather faster than he had hoped, and there were no further ones on offer.
Watson seemed to consider that. “It would also allow me to tell Acton that I have some manner of leash on you, as well.”
“They will do no such thing,” Holmes cut in, standing between them and the entrance. He felt Paget step up beside him, and Davy clambered to the stair ahead of him.
Simeon studied me for a moment, then turned his attention to the window. “It doesn’t matter, I suppose. There’s still time.”
The faun seemed to understand, silently pointing me towards a large fallen tree. There was space enough underneath for me to rest comfortably, and a layer of dead leaves looked to be a comfortable bed.
I took in what I could in a glance. All the kids, shoved into small cages. Most looked asleep. Thank God for small favors. A table, decorated as an altar. Mary laying on the altar, chains around her tiny wrists. A bowl, carved of bone.
“Good.” He looked up at Holmes, taking a shaky breath. “I tried to see what he was doing, but I don’t think I saw enough.”
<We can restrain the troll for her,> it said, <But we can do nothing for the poison she ingested yet.>
“If the bond is in place and I die?” I shrugged in reply to his nod. “You’ll both feel it, but the quick and dirty one won’t debilitate you. Plus, the elementals can take the remnants off, if I’m incapacitated.”
“There’s a poem that mostly applies. ‘As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back—/ For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.’ Wolfwalkers sentenced to exile go mad. That was the plan. Drive me until I had nothing, and then ‘graciously’ accept me back.”
He felt the words through his chest, an echo of the bullet he’d taken in Maiwand. He didn’t reply, didn’t turn, simply headed back to the door.
I studied the faun as my mind raced. It wasn’t getting drenched. Of course, elementals aren’t really real, not in the sense that flesh-and-blood creatures were. They were common in some ways, but in others, one was forced to acknowledge that they existed before humanity, and would likely continue existing long after us. I swallowed and forced myself to recognize what the faun said.
“Fuck.” I grabbed one of the pillows and dropped it over my face. I knew they could still hear me, through the bond, but damn if I couldn’t say most of what I needed to without some kind of shield.
The sylph flew off as Watson considered the message. That didn’t seem to be the kind of behavior of an abomination, and his- her- behavior at luncheon was more akin to that of a visiting mage. He considered his warning to the Council.
Letter drafted, he handed it of to the butler, then stood at the window, gazing out over the grounds.
“Rash, Sherlock. However, it was understandable. Paget, remove Lord Acton to the wine cellar. And do ensure the door is locked.”
“John.” She took a shuddering breath. Something about her tone made him hesitate. “I can’t keep doing this, John.”
Opening the pack, I decided to just dump everything out, just to see what all I had now. I spread the blanket out, setting the books to one side, then upending the pack.
Damn pack politics. If it wasn’t for the traditionalist, hidebound assholes calling the shots, I would be happily set up with a cushy job, a house, and a very healthy bank account. Instead I was left to work cash under the table jobs and keep moving across the US. Everything I owned was in the beat up backpack I was carrying around. Ah, well. It could be worse. Normal humans weren’t as durable as wolfwalkers, and I at least could sleep rough and hunt for my dinner.
He bit back a grin at Holmes’s flush of pleasure. That man truly was more susceptible to flattery than any woman he’d ever known. Watson shoved that thought down, locking it away with all the others, as Holmes approached the hall.
I considered the spell on the window for a moment. It was simple, and not well maintained. I bared my teeth, taking a few steps back, then flung myself through the window. The spell and the glass shattered around me.
The faun considered for a moment. <She broke her hip, and cracked some ribs, when she was thrown. She likely has a concussion, as well.>
I narrowed my eyes at his tone. “You know something,” I began, but before I could find out more, the carriage rattled to a stop.
Davy looked over his shoulder, then grinned. “Well, the tall one is Mr. Sherlock, Mrs. Holmes’s younger son. I don’t know the other, but I’d guess he’s Mr. Sherlock’s doctor friend. Watson. They’ve been working together for a few years now.”
I shook my head, annoyed at myself, as I reached a small clearing. It was in a little gully, out of sight of the roads and trails nearby. I dropped my pack to the ground with a sigh. I’d stay here, sleep through the day, and head out at dusk. No one would notice a wolf carrying a pack at night, and I could go far enough that the harriers behind me would lose the scent again.
He turned to Holmes and offered a hand. “Fredrick Burke. With your permission, I’d like to set a ward here, and send a warning to those who think Acton’s…”
Watson took the offered seat. Lord Acton said nothing for some time, allowing Watson to prepare and light his own pipe.
I could feel him watching me, and smell his amusement. I ignored it for as long as I could, but I finally snapped.
Watson studied the Hall with a raised brow. Somehow, it was nothing like he expected, and exactly what he expected. It was a modest hall, all things considered, short and sprawling. Vines grew wild along the facade, providing an interesting contrast to the manicured drive.
<As long as I’m not imposing.> I yawned. <Right. I’m going back to bed before Watson yells at me some more. I’ll likely start changing the potentials here in a week or so.>
There was a hill with a convenient view of the village, and I climbed it easily enough, settling in to watch the people. Dawn was just breaking, and I could hear cows and sheep nearby. People would be moving about soon enough.
Watson sighed and moved to the large French window, pushing it open. He had barely stepped aside when a massive black wolf jumped into the room.
He kept up a pointless string of complaints as Mrs. Hudson brought in the mail. He tossed the papers to Watson, scanning the letters with interest. Most disappointed, but a letter from Mycroft caught his attention.
That wasn’t good. One of each might show up to see a wolfwalker pass through, but this many? Salamanders, fauns, undines, sylphs, gnomes, and more? Something major was happening. I closed my eyes, sending out my senses for any malignant magics. Nothing. I knew there were no mages here, it’s most of why I stayed as long as I had. I opened my eyes again.
There was a corset. And a weird, lobster-tail-shaped half cage thing. And several more skirts, along with a shirt, a small jacket, some uncomfortable-looking shoes, and a hat.
I tucked myself under the log, shifting back long enough to search the pack. There was a blanket on the top, which I pulled out gratefully. It had been wrapped around my books, and I was pleased to see that they had been rebound, leather replacing the fairly cheap paper. I stroked the spines with a smile, tucking the books back into the pack.
“Hunter,” he said, inclining his head. “I have a simple supper laid out, and I have a room available for as long as you would wish it. Come in, and be well. We will discuss your task over dinner, and in the morning, you can begin your hunt.”
“Understandable.” He puffed on his pipe, eyes distant. “That seems agreeable. I will present your terms, and will send for you when I need your presence. Until then, feel free to make use of Shanbrook Hall as a base of operations. Mother will likely return in the autumn, but I will inform her of your presence here.” He smiled. “Likely, she will use that as an excuse to remain in Paris.”
I sat up, frowning at him. That was a bad idea, considering how everything spun around, but I didn’t back down.
Mycroft approached the table as Watson sat in front of the bowl, lit candles arrayed across the table. “Truthfully, this looks like some charlatan’s trick.”
“I believe we should speak to brother Mycroft. As you say, Hewe-Upon-Arun is made almost entirely of Potentials, so basing you here at Shanbrook would give you access to those you might begin Awakening. Additionally, it would give you a location to welcome new Potentials, assuming you could summon them from a distance.”
He felt a distracted snort. <Well, either get the village to string him up, or claim that Fox is your guest. The elementals can defend your hospitality.>
“Thanks again.” I turned to face Holmes and grinned. “So, we really don’t have time for the full explanation.”
I slowed as I approached the faun’s clearing. There was a man nearby. Not usually a problem, but I would prefer to not be shot at. Except I couldn’t smell any gunpowder. Huh.
Davy shrugged. “I had run over to the forge, to see if Mom’s pot was ready, and then there was a…” he trailed off, brow furrowing. “It felt like a sneeze, almost. And then I was in a cage.”
“No, you wouldn’t. You’re a kinder man than I.” Holmes smoked in silence for a few moments, then sighed. “I assume you wish her to keep her share of the Agra treasure?” Watson nodded silently. “Very well. I can afford to put you up for a bit, until you get back on your feet.” He looked as though something had just struck him. “You don’t mind, do you? Returning to Baker Street?”
As the unmistakable smell of human habitation reached my nose, I slowed my trot, categorizing everything. Lots of manure, and the smell of meat on the hoof. Mostly sheep, but enough cows and horses to be interesting. Loads of chickens and geese too.
He stifled a laugh at that. I smiled in reply, turning my nose back to the wind. There was some spell brewing, but I couldn’t quite place it. It was just off enough that I couldn’t place it properly.
If possible, the faun’s ears drooped even more. <Hunted. Slain. Mages fear your kind, and they killed all the packs.>
I drew up suddenly as something struck me. Exhaust. I hadn’t smelled exhaust since I spoke to the Unicorn. Or asphalt. Or any of the thousands of modern scents that formed the background of any human habitation in the twenty-first century.
He stepped closer, raising a hand. Watson stepped into it, eyes drifting closed as Sherlock’s long, graceful fingers brushed his cheek.
“Every faithful sheepdog was once a wolf, Hunter.” He rose as bells began chiming in the village. “Come to the church, and I will tell you what I know. I can also assist you in finding a place to stay, and navigating what may be unknown to you.”
This one gets into some heavy discussions. If you need to pull out, do a search for 'As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back—/ For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.'
Soon, now. There was much to be done, and little time to do it in. He could not afford to make a mistake now.
Watson shook his head with a small smile. “You know, I almost forget that you have a family. It sometimes seems as though you sprung up, fully formed, in Trafalgar Square.”
Watson looked up, startled. Holmes was rarely mentioned in the Arcadian, and usually only as a subtle reminder to keep the knowledge of what the Solar Council did out of his hands. Suggesting that he bring Holmes in to look at something for the Council….
I sighed, sitting just out of its reach. <I don’t suppose you’ll let me free you without you trying to take a chunk of me, will you?>
Being alone, surrounded by people who didn’t, couldn’t, know the truth was tiring. I was starting to see why loners went mad.
I trotted off, slipping into a lope that would eat up the miles. True, the kid was a Potential, but I wasn’t going to think about Awakening anyone until I had the measure of the mages here. And I certainly wasn’t going to turn a prepubescent kid. Teenagers were bad enough when they couldn’t turn into wolves.
This one looked like someone had tried to burn it, and I felt my heart drop. Oh, God. If someone tried to read that as a cohesive whole….
I grinned at the brief flare of satisfaction that garnered me, and returned to the bedroom. Things were looking up, and I could take the time to recover before I tackled the burned tome, the Council, and whatever was brewing in Europe.
I took advantage of the absence of the kids, following the track out of town. I found a small shed that smelled abandoned and ducked inside to strip and shift. I couldn’t help but sigh once I was a wolf again. Life was simpler this way.
He finished addressing the final envelope as Mrs. Hudson returned with the tea tray. Holmes made an absent note that she had laid the tray with all of Watson’s favorites. When she returned from puttering over Watson again, Holmes held out the small stack of letters.
<Here. Wear this for now, and I will fix the rest of this,> they raised the pack with distaste. There was a suit laying across the bed.
I sighed. “Longer story than we have time for, but the short answer is most everyone in Hewe-Upon-Arun is like me. The mage is probably trying to find a viable way of getting lycanthropy, or immortality, or some shit. We can figure that part out after the kids are safe.”
I nodded and turned to go. <Thanks. You go home. Whatever it is, you shouldn’t be tangling with it.>
I barked a laugh. “Absolutely not. We’re the balance between humans, mages, and elementals. Whatever, whoever, is doing this threatens that balance. If they won’t surrender, I’ll take them out. Tell me your Council would do anything different.” I flashed a grin at him. “Besides, wolves don’t really go in for the whole ‘obedience’ thing.”
The pair strolled through the town, each considering their luncheon with Fox. Watson idly looked around for a telegraph post. True, he could send an elemental with the message, but a telegram would be much simpler.
“Dominick Hislop, younger son of Lord Hornsey. He only had a simple talent for magic, so he was never taught.”
They disappeared with my pack, and I sighed. I didn’t feel like offending my only ally’s sensibilities by sitting for dinner nude, so I wandered around the room, studying the bookshelves. There was the usual expected ones, a few different Bibles, some ecclesiastical texts. There was also a surprising amount on magic, as well. I had just pulled one out, an old medieval text on wolfwalkers, when the brownie returned.
Holmes sighed, looking pained. “There is a Wolfwalker, one who can transform into a wolf, who is heading off to where he believes this rogue mage is. We were intended to join him, however we were needed to stall for time.”
We had left the village behind, climbing a small hill. The view was breathtaking. There was a small forest to one side, and I could see the lines of roads through it. To the other side was the village of Hewe-Upon-Arun, with the curve of a river beyond it. I suppose that was the Arun. In between stretched fields, spread out to the horizon. There were dots in some fields, sheep, cows, and horses, according to my nose. Other fields were thick with crops. I closed my eyes, enjoying the breeze and sunlight as I let my senses stretch out.
“Fox Hunter. Feel free to slap either a ‘Mr.’ or ‘Miss’ in front of it, makes no difference to me.” I shook their hands as I continued. “Or forgo an honorific entirely. That’s an option too.”
Watson had long given up on trying to track every way Holmes could read him, simply nodding and following his directions to the post office.
“Got it in one. Real packs are basically family units. The so-called Alpha is basically the head-of-house. Infighting is something of a rarity. Anyway, the original paper, with alpha wolves and dominance fights managed to get incredibly popular. And eventually, certain wolfwalkers decided they liked how it sounded.” I snorted. “Why wouldn’t they? This said they had the right to any female they wanted, provided they could fight off any challengers.”
“I’m sure we can spin some manner of story as to why you are presenting as male, that would satisfy him.”
“I will.” Holmes rose. “Mr. Hunter. I’ll send a carriage to the rectory for you and Father Simeon at seven.”
I caught the barest hint of of a grin as he climbed into the carriage, leaving me to clamber into the rear-facing seat.
She’d be happy soon, anyway. With tonight’s tips, I’d finally saved enough to move on. Granted not very far, but I’d at least make it out of this shithole of a town. Might even make it to a decent sized city. True, that would be suicide for me, but Claire didn’t need to know that.
The men nodded, grabbing the sheet and carrying Fox by the makeshift liter. Watson followed, barely sparing a glance to Holmes.
Watson sighed. “Oh, very well. I’ll go pack, and you can go warn your mother’s staff that we’re coming.”
Yay! So, this is done, and I'm probably going to wait a while before I start posting the sequel. Firstly, because I haven't written it yet, and secondly, because I'm still trying to figure out the plot.
“You’re up to something, wolf. I don’t know what, yet, but know I will discover it, and I will stop you.”
Watson turned to Father Simeon, eyebrow raised. “If you are referring to the wolf, some people can hide their true nature for years in order to manipulate others.”
I considered the dressing gown again, before giving it up as a bad job and just shifting. For some reason, I didn’t mind Holmes and Watson seeing me undressed, but Mycroft seeing me like that bothered me.
Holmes sniffed. “You might regret that. However, I would like your take on this priest. Seems he has some plan, something about using Shanbrook Hall as an orphanage or some such.” He turned to the window, but Watson could see the faint curve of a smile. “Mother would be happy. She hates the place.”
<The packs will never stand the loss of one who can bear pups, especially one with your strength. They will hunt you until you can no longer run. What will you do then?>
I rolled my eyes. <I can hear the heart beet in your chest from halfway across a room, and I can smell all the hormones and emotion you have at the same distance. Both of you spent the entirety of lunch and dinner pining over each other. And me.>
I couldn’t be sure, but it looked like a period in history where women didn’t have rights, and depended on the menfolk to accomplish everything.
John brushed his lips across Sherlock’s, then returned, lightly licking along the seam of his lips. Sherlock allowed him to take the lead, opening his mouth to John’s gentle proddings.
<There have been instances of pack bonds between non-wolves and wolves, Hunter. That would give you the connection you desire, while also granting them the space you wish.>
“Yeah. Anyway, I was approached by a unicorn a couple of days ago. I was told that there was a world in danger, and I was needed to help save it. I agreed, and was sent here.”
He gathered the tray, intending to leave it in the parlor for Mrs. Hudson. Later, he lay back against his headboard with his pipe, considering the problem of Watson.
Mycroft considered that pronouncement. It sounded preposterous, but Watson was more level-headed than that, and Lord Acton’s response seemed to fit that as well. He nodded, placing a firm hand on Acton’s shoulder.
Watson was sitting on the edge of the bed in his shirtsleeves, staring vacantly at the teapot. Holmes sighed theatrically.
What the Unicorn offered was purpose. People would die if I refused. Yeah, the elementals would find another skinchanger, but none alive today were as strong as I am. They’d fail, if they were to face this threat alone.
She could keep the flat. It was paid for. He would see her looked after. It was the least of what he owed her. He was only passably aware of boarding another cab, and barely noticed when it came to a halt.
I dodged through a flock of sheep, sending them scattering as I continued, <Personally, I wouldn’t touch this mess with a ten foot pole if I had a choice. You two need to sort out your feelings first, before considering adding someone else to your hot mess. But needs must and all of that.>
I sighed and dropped back into the shack. Damn puppies could be damn near invisible if they want to be, and I was too distracted by the fact that Sherlock Fucking Holmes was here, and invited me to dinner to look too closely.
Holmes schooled his face to not reveal the hurt those last words caused, turning and offering the teacup.
The troll flung its arm out, and I went flying. Luckily, my fall was broken by a large boulder. I slammed into it, hard enough to break something and send my ears ringing. I staggered to my feet, shaking my head to clear it as the troll rushed at me.
I sat up, still mostly asleep as I considered what I’d been told. Finally, I climbed out of the bed, a rather decadent feather bed, and prepared for the day.
There were eight of them, ranging from around maybe four or five to their early teens, boys and girls, and every single one of them was a Potential. I leaned on the gate, waiting for them to speak first, and actually looked at the town. The priest’s magic was everywhere, but fine as gossamer. Simple blessings and good health to the people, I’d say. There was another mage, well, not quite a mage I guess. The forge hosted a pair of salamanders, and the blacksmith could learn to be a mage, if he cared to.
Watson alighted from the hansom and approached the door. It opened before he reached it, and he froze, somewhat surprised. The maid, Mary Jane, was standing by the open door, obviously waiting for his arrival.
Carefully, he set his bag down and began cleaning the mess. Everything would need to be perfect, and then he would truly earn the power he was owed.
<Gale, Bubbles, Sparky, Rocky,> I called, broadcasting my comments to any elemental in range, <I don’t care how you do it, but I need Watson to meet me. Now.>
Wolfwalkers come in three types, although mages only know about two, and most humans have only heard of one. So, I’m a skinchanger. I can be a human, or I can be a wolf. Been able to switch at will since I was a baby. The second kind are soulshifters. Soulshifters can project their… eh. Call it their soul, or their power, whatever makes you happy. They aren’t as powerful as a skinchanger in a straight fight, but they’re considerably better at breaking magics and bindings. Better at the subtle stuff. And finally, we have Potentials. Potentials come from wolfwalker stock, on one or both sides. Usually, they’re indistinguishable from a normal human, unless you know what to look for. And, as you can guess, it’s easier to see it in kids. Under certain circumstances, if you need to build up a pack quickly, for example, skinchangers can Awaken Potentials. Basically, take that potential they have, and make it real.
There’s a new priest in Hewe-Upon-Arun, who was asking about Shanbrook. Wants to use it for orphans or somesuch. I have work, and from what I’ve seen, you have nothing going right now, so why not take Watson, nip down to Shanbrook, and see what’s to be done?
My books were stacked neatly on the bedside table when I returned to the room. I stripped off the suit, dropping it over the back of the chair, and flopped onto the bed. It was warm, and safe. I could feel the gentle brush of Father Simeon’s wards as I tugged the blanket around me, and then I was out for the night.
I abandoned my hill, making a wide circle around the town as I thought. There was actually a surprisingly few mages in the area, considering that the mages here were organized enough to wipe out my kind. Admittedly, the place didn’t look too big, only a few hundred people all told. The mages were probably gathered in some city somewhere.
I half-laughed, running a hand through the offending fuzz. It had grown out a bit shaggier than I liked it. I’d need to find the equivalent of a pair of clippers to shave it back. “I like it short. Makes it easier when I need to shift a lot.”
He arrived at the club, leaving his hat, stick, and Gladstone with the servants and headed towards the smoking room. Lord Acton was usually found there, when he wasn’t presiding over the Solar Council, and no one else would send a summons.
I sighed. “So, to deal with whatever’s happening in Europe, I’ll need to Awaken… a lot of Potentials. And teach them. And hope that the whatever council won’t try to kill us all.”
“That wolf. They’re bred, they can’t transform anyone.” Acton strode down the stairs, looking around for his mages. “Lord Bexley, Burke, Tabiner. Go in there and finish it off.”
Disquieted, I changed tack. With the storm, undines and sylphs should be having a ball. I sent out a thread of presence, seeking any local elementals that might want to talk. It was answered, not by a sylph or undine, but by a faun.
It was a stranger, with brutally cropped hair and a suit of good fabric. They were sat in a corner, with what looked like every child in the village attending them.
“I am Father Simeon. The elementals told me of your coming, Hunter. I offer what aid I can, as well as sanctuary, if you should desire it.”
Watson surprised him, already sitting at the table, in his accustomed spot. Holmes was pleased to note that he’d changed, at least.
I ducked into a thicker part of the underbrush, sending my senses out toward the stranger, then sat bolt upright in surprise.
<See if they managed to get everything out of the cottage. I want to see what he had, and I want Fox’s input on the book.>
Holmes laughed. “He wouldn’t. But Mother still resides at Shanbrook Hall, and he is loathe to do anything that might upset her. Apparently, as Mother is in France for the season, and a new priest arrived in the village, Brother Mycroft wishes me to go south and take the priest’s measure myself.”
Holmes followed his gaze. “I don’t know. But I do know that Watson is a brilliant doctor, and with these elementals assisting, I can’t see how he might fail.”
“I will set the wards tonight, but I will key them so you may pass unmolested, should you wish to begin hour search tonight.”
I was having difficulty keeping my feet as I approached the kelpie. Thankfully, it simply bowed to me and returned to its stream. I sat and stretched my senses out. All the bindings outside had been broken. All that was left was the mage behind everything.
As Watson entered the smoking room, he could feel the weight of Lord Acton’s gaze on him. Watson straightened unconsciously, approaching his table.
I shrugged. “Not much. The kids glommed onto me, and by the time I managed to shake them, I didn’t have time to reach the new mage.”
I felt both of them pull away then, probably to deal with the mages that arrived, and sighed. The rest of this run would be lonely.
Holmes studied his room, then nodded. Nothing important had been moved, and he was satisfied it would serve for a week or so. He settled down at his cramped desk, drawing up a brief invitation to the new priest, Father Simeon, asking him to come to dinner, both so they two could get the measure of the other, but also to discuss the plan to use Shanbrook as an orphanage.
Some of the packs kept them, notes on rituals and things to watch out for, things like that. They were never organized, from what I’d seen, usually a jumbled mess of pack notes and warnings tossed in among details of the really nasty rituals that would take a full pack or two to fix.
Watson glared daggers at him, continuing. “The artifacts that were stolen from the British Museum have real power. A mage, such as myself of Lord Acton here, could use them to power certain rituals. The man who stole them is planning on using them at moonrise, in a ritual that will kill every child in Hewe-Upon-Arun.”
The elementals who fought their bonds were nothing. An extra layer of defense, nothing more. His spells lay ready. The first would rise with the sun, the second, the moon. Everything was balanced.
“No. I think being back in Baker Street would help me a great deal. Although I do look forward to seeing your familial estate.”
I felt Holmes’s assent and turned my attention to the field before me. It was lousy with bindings. They were nasty, too. They had teeth. But for all the snarls and nastiness, they lacked anything like finesse. If there wasn’t a threat to the kids, I could just leave this alone. The elementals would be able to get free within a day. I approached the closest elemental caught, a sylph.
Watson sighed heavily, closing his eyes against the tears that threatened. “I understand. If that is what you wish, I’ll see it done.”
After dinner, I excused myself as the men retired to the smoking room. I found my way out to a manicured garden when I heard footsteps behind me. I half-turned, acknowledging Watson’s approach.
I nodded a goodbye and left the diner, stopping in the small alley in the back. I moved most of the money to a hidden pocket I’d sewn into the backpack, keeping about a hundred in my pockets. Once the bulk of my savings was secure, I shrugged the backpack on and made my way toward the bus station.
I sat and removed the cover, grinning at the plate left for me. Bacon and eggs, with toast and oatmeal. A salamander blinked at me, then wrapped around a teapot. I thanked the salamander and poured a cup of tea. Satisfied, I tucked in.
Well, if I could take out that minor evil south of here, maybe I could use that as a springboard to get on the mages’ good side. Assuming they had one.
I sneezed, the closest I could get to a laugh in wolf form. He seemed to understand and smiled in reply.
He studied her closer. She carried herself like a man, and from what he saw, the children were treating her as a man.
I flicked an ear at him before sighing and shifting. He didn’t react to seeing me nude before him, and I got the impression the brownie gossiped more than I was used to. I’d spent too long alone.
I licked my side to slow the bleeding and continued on. The ifrit proved saner than the Roc, merely bowing and dissipating when its bonds were broken.
Davy scowled. “He was talking a lot. I thought it was to himself, but...” he glanced at the gathered elementals, “I heard Fox in my head, before this.”
Holmes shoved the thought aside, settling down to his own breakfast. He kept an eye on Watson as he began to complain about the lack of cases lately. He cocked a brow as Watson felt something in his breast pocket, but as Watson didn’t mention it, Holmes declined to comment.
He pushed the issue aside as the cab approached his flat. Mary would be waiting, and he could wrangle Holmes in the morning.
Watson scrubbed a hand across his face. “If Lord Acton will stay quiet, I can scry, show all of us what Fox is doing.”
Holmes led the way through the village, pointing out items of interest and small details that Watson tended to overlook. As they walked, he kept an eye on Watson. His leg seemed better than usual, and he wasn’t carrying his shoulder as though it pained him. Good. But he was more closed off than usual, likely trying to avoid thinking of Mary.
‘Fine’ Mycroft walked the short distance to his coat rack, the dark overcoat may not have been the dramatic cape like creation his brother had preferred but it was cut to his body and provided the metaphorical armour this situation seemed to warrant.
It took five days for everything to come to a head, the new nanny was an imbecile who left Sherlock unattended the majority of the day, preferring to continue he dalliance with one of the kitchen porters rather than do her job, but Mycroft did not care too much. He was well versed in his brother’s care and capable of providing everything he could need, Sherlock had been screaming for an hour before Mycroft managed to liberate him from his crib, left to his own devices he had pulled one of the arms off a particularly ugly bear their Grandmother had provided Mycroft with on his fourth birthday, Mycroft had hardly minded the mauled object, what he had minded was his brother having a the animals stuffing running through his out of control ringlets.  Mycroft had collected him, moving into the adjoining bathroom to run Sherlock a bath, he had seen his father do so almost every day over the proceeding half a year and thought he could handle it. His brother loved bath time and Mycroft held him up so he could watch the bubbles blossom on the water’s surface.
Jesus Christ did John need a drink, pacing seemed like the only thing to do here but he couldn’t find the energy to move his legs.
Every person on that list, excluding Anthea, already had a security detail assigned to them and that would only increase.
‘If your question, D.I. Lestrade, is whether I want you,’ Mycroft’s voice comes out as a deep growl, he holds Greg’s wrists flat to the wall by his head, restraining him as he thrusts hard against him, Greg finds himself whimpering under the movements of Mycroft’s hips, ‘rest assured, I have never wanted another in the way I want you’ he feels hands running down his back, pulling him closer, their chest pressed together while Mycroft moves to bite his neck softly, the difference in pressure, the hard thrusts and soft mouth against him retches up his arousal,
How are we all? It's a week before my Birthday and I bring you a new chapter. It's a little dark but that's nothing new for this fic and we're working on the expectation that everyone reading will already know standard warnings for Mina and Mycroft being an icy bastard sometimes.
'I need you to come down to the station. As soon as possible really, this is quite time sensitive and before you offer, it needs to be you, not your staff’
“John, I apologise for the way your evening has ended and I will endeavour to explain the situation to the best of my ability shortly but firstly, Mrs. Hudson, I wonder if you might answer a few questions for me?”
‘As stated previously Lisa will accompany Mina here at which point you will become responsible for the child, any questions you have can be directed to Lisa or if required myself, this is my card’ a small rectangle of white card is forced into Johns slightly limp hand, ‘feel free to call me with legal questions or queries about procedure. Congratulations Dr Watson, may you home be a happy one.’ And with that the tiny man in the terrible suit, with the terrible manners and the surprisingly tiny hands left.
Mycroft had been about to step back into the street and drag John Watson in by his ear. He was entirely at sea and the good Doctor needed to pull it together because in reality only one of them could stand to have a break down at this particular moment and Mycroft was resigning himself to being the owner of that descent into madness. This entire afternoon was a nightmare. A nightmare he had never been prepared for.  This was not one of the magnitudes of ways he had ever anticipated his brother messing up.  He had never once considered Sherlock impregnating some drug fueled woman and producing a child. Dear God a child, Mummy was going to have yet another fit of hysterics and his father was not going to thank him for that. A genius his mother may be but emotionally stable she was not.
‘Sure, lead the way,’ he indicates for her to walk in front of him which she does after executing a perfect about-turn, the precision of her movements speaks of some military training and he thinks there’s a serious chance that everyone of Mycroft’s employees could kill someone with minimal effort of their part, best to stay cordial he decides, ‘Sorry I didn’t catch your name,’
The alcohol and residual adrenaline were creating a haze in John’s mind. He sipped at the glass in his hand, turning away from Mycroft’s probing gaze and wandering toward his daughter. Her lips had parted in her sleep, pressed in a way which made them look like she was delivering a kiss.
Every time the man calls him Mr Watson John nearly throws a punch, he’s wound up pretty tight from the overwhelming developments of the day and to now have this cheap man in an even cheaper suit evaluate his home and judge his ability to be a father, is putting him one step closer to the edge of violence. But John knows punching this tiny tiny man would do him no good, it could potentially lose him the chance of having Mina, so instead he grits his teeth and doesn’t force his medical licence down the man’s throat.
‘That’s good John, I just, I wanted to check. Look I should be going,’ Now John allows himself to feel panic, he’d not considered her leaving, she was the fountain of baby knowledge and John needed answers.
John does not mean to say it. Does not mean to threaten Greg but there is something in the way the newly single Detective Inspector is watching Sherlock play a game of pool against Sally that has John’s blood boiling. He is after all a man and Sherlock is his. Everybody knows that. Well perhaps everyone but Sherlock.
‘She’s pretty competitive isn’t she?’ Danny sits next to him tilting what’s left of his half a larger around its glass, ‘Sally I mean, she seems competitive’
Unlike last time there was no voice to follow but Greg let his feet carry him back towards where he was sure Mycroft’s office had been, the view from the window in the library had made him certain they were no longer in London and as well as finding Mycroft he wanted to know how long it would take him to get back to the office, having checked his phone he’d confirmed his teams wellbeing as well as noting the language his commanding officers had used in their emails. He wouldn’t be facing any disciplinary actions that much was clear and it appeared as if neither of his sergeants had reported the near miss involving him, his gun and a suspect. He felt the sharp pang of guilt and grief pierce his gut as he thought back to Samantha’s face, he’d tried to comfort her but he felt sure he could have done more for her, if only he’d not been shocked, he should have done more.
In total opening the pushchair had taken twenty five minutes, four attempts, one cut finger and some quietly muttered expletives but eventually John had been able to release Mrs Hudson from the chair where she’d been holding Mina and having bundled her up in both coat, shoes, scarf, mittens and a hat they’d left the house. Turns out making your way through London with a pushchair is a nightmare. You’re relegated to buses because no one thinks taking a pushchair on the underground is clever, you’re forced to have people move so you can navigate an awkwardly shaped piece of apparatus around with you and then there’s the constant worry about literally running into someone. The pushchair itself was nice, on the outside it was a plain black and silver but when Mina laid back or was covered by the rain guard the inner material was covered in depictions of star constellations, it was incredibly detailed to the point where John got distracted himself. The description said that in the dark the star shapes would reflect the light and appear to glow, potentially overkill for a child’s pushchair but John thought you had to love the ingenuity.
“No, there’s nothing I wouldn’t do.” The admission looked to pain him but John didn’t have time to wonder at why.
‘Anyone else feel slightly in shock right now?’ it was Greg, he was voicing the same sentiment John was feeling but John couldn’t find words anymore. Articulation had left the building and in its place he’d been left staring blindly at a small pile of papers on the coffee table, that and the small rectangle of card that was slowly digger its corners into his palm.
Mycroft Holmes stands behind a heavy mahogany desk, observing the grounds below. All Greg can see is his back but he knows it’s him, the late afternoon sun makes his red hair shine and its all Greg can do not to lean out and run his fingers through it.
“Okay. So, a while back, I don’t remember when exactly, some scientist spent a bunch of time watching wolves, and he came to the conclusion that wolves have what he called an Alpha male, the one that was biggest and meanest, and ruled over the rest of the pack. Now, that was bullshit. He was studying several wolves that had been captured from all over and housed together, not an actual pack.”
Holmes saw Fox waiting outside and approached, heart lifting. Something about them… it was freeing, in a way, just being in their company.
His eyes drifted closed and he allowed himself to focus on the sensations of John’s lips and tongue, his hands along Sherlock’s hip and hair, the feel of John’s heart pounding under his fingers. He pulled away the barest amount, trying to catch his breath and still his pounding heart.
I nodded dumbly as the Unicorn padded away. The other elementals followed, slowly branching out to pace an intricate pattern around me. I stripped off the dingy t-shirt and faded jeans, shoving them into my pack, soon followed by the tank I was using as an undershirt. I’d given up on panties shortly after I’d begun running. Too much effort. Finally my shoes and socks were stuffed inside. I stretched, allowing the change to take me. It wasn’t what most people expected. No cracking bones or screaming. Just, one moment I was a naked human, the next, I was a good sized black wolf.
<Nope. I’ve read the stories tons of times, the tome I want to look at is at the Rectory, and Mycroft is out visiting. My choices right now are sleep, stare at the wallpaper, or eavesdrop on you two. Option three is the most entertaining, so here we are.>
There was a faint shimmer of light, and where the wolf had been stood Mr. Hunter, stark as the day he was born.
“Keep an eye on my stuff, please,” I said, barely waiting for one of the fauns to reply before shifting and trotting off.
I sighed. “Well, that does complicate things. But you didn’t shoot at me, or attack outright, so I’ll let you make it up to me.”
I swallowed heavily. I knew, in the same way I knew magic, that there were alternate universes. Hell, most fiction novels came from people who could see into those alternate realities. But moving from one reality to another? That was practically unheard of. And if this many elementals were approaching a single, packless wolfwalker with the opportunity? Whatever was happening in that reality would threaten all of them, eventually.
<Smart pup.> He flushed, pleased. <But it’s hiding. I know roughly where it is, south and west of the town, but I’d rather not spend time looking for it. Where could something be out there?>
Holmes leveled Davy with a look, and he ducked his head. “I know. I’m sorry. I told him where the cottage was, and he said he could turn me into a wolf when I was twenty five.”
But Holmes seemed as indifferent to the many attractive men who found their way to Baker Street as the women. Maybe slightly more, actually. He usually managed to find some way to tease Watson about the women, at least.
<And since those fuckos would cheerfully let those kids die, I say you’re on the side of angels here,> Fox put in.
“I know.” She turned to face him, still hugging herself. “I do love you, John. You’re kind. Kind, and gentle, and loving. You’d be almost perfect, if you weren’t so bound to Holmes. I’ve had time to think, while you followed him on his cases. I loved you once. Maybe I could learn to love you again. But not now. Not when you keep jumping every time he beacons.”
I ducked the shirt flung at me, pulling it on and buttoning it up as the brownie helped me into the trousers and cravat. I was pulling the jacket on as I walked down the hall.
Watson gazed vacantly out of the window, barely registering the miles blurring past as the train flew south. In an effort to occupy his mind, he focused his magic, trying to see how many mages he could sense as the train passed. The number seemed to diminish as the train moved away from London.
That would explain why the Unicorn came. Wolves provide balance. If the mages had truly slain all of my kind, then there was nothing keeping the less ethical in check. And those less ethical mages were the ones the really nasty stories were about.
“Alright. So, I’m a wolfwalker, specifically a skinchanger. Exactly what it says on the tin, I can turn into a wolf. Skin changes, whatever’s on is doesn’t, so no clothes. Anyway, there are two other kinds: soulshifters and Potentials. Soulshifters… physically, they can’t change. They’re born human, they die human, and they spend every day in between human. But, they can project their…” I waved a hand as I tried to think of the best way of describing it., “their soul, their spirit, their power, and manifest that elsewhere. Usually as a ghosty-looking wolf. Dealing with that idiot earlier, if there had been soulshifters present, they could have unmade all of the bindings, and drained off the magic so he couldn’t whammy me during the fight. Things like that.”
“Females were bought and sold. I-” I glanced over my shoulder, feeling lost. “Vagaries of my biology aside, I don’t feel like a woman. Never did. I’d rather be a man, if it was a choice.” I took a shuddering breath, continuing to pace. “As far as my family, as the packs, were concerned, I was a female. On top of that, I was a skinchanger, and a damn powerful one, to boot. My father-”
Watson followed Holmes into the pub, amused. The amusement was driven from him as he stepped onto the stair.
Watson and I shared a look as Davy practically vibrated out of his chair. He looked drawn, this close, and I could smell some lingering hurt, but he flashed a grin, evidently amused by the puppies for now.
I trotted around the field, freeing the salamander, gnome, and undine. None asked for that final release, and privately, I was glad. I was a hunter, yes, and my nature was that of a predator. But elementals were friends. Most times, the only ones I had.
Lord Acton waved a hand, smoke trailing from his cigar. “Some artifacts were removed from the Museum. The usual ritual items, as well as an inscribed bowl. But whoever took them also managed to get his hands on one of the old grimories our men in the Museum were studying.” He took a drag off his cigar, considering. “Strange. According to what we know, the one that was taken was half-burned some years back. Can’t see how someone could get any use out of that.”
He settled back in the cab, considering his options. Manipulating Holmes was always a chancy endeavor. Half the time, he would dig his heels in and refuse any possibility of a case, and others… well he had gotten far closer to the truth more times than Watson was comfortable with. But with a grimorie taken as well…. Even if it was half-burnt, there was still a possibility of there being something one could use, if one had learned the basics.
Honestly, the kid couldn’t be older than twelve. I fought back a smile as even the older kids seemed to take Davy’s lead.
“Then the Council could not move against you. I see.” He leaned back, drawing a pipe out of his jacket pocket.
The man tugged his forelock gratefully, heading out of the house. Watson turned to Holmes, mind racing.
I snorted. <No. At least, not right away. They’ll work themselves up into a lather to deal with me, and by the time they think to look past the border, it will probably be too late.>
“This!” she exclaimed, sweeping an arm around the room. “You have a good practice, and you keep putting it on hold every time that man so much as crooks a finger! I hardly ever see you most weeks, simply because he has a case! I can’t-” She broke off, turning away as she wrapped her arms around herself. “I love you, John. But I can no longer stand back and be the least important person in your life.”
I shrugged on the suit. It was neatly made, and cut in a way that made it clear that I was AFAB. I grinned to my reflection in the mirror hung on the wardrobe and headed toward the smell of food.
I nodded. <There are potentials, people with the wolf blood who don’t know what they are. I can awaken that potential, make them into true wolfwalkers, train them in what they need to know. I can not take on the darkness in Europe alone, I will need to awaken more wolves to handle it.>
I threw the pillow off and sat up. It hurt, but I needed to move. I managed to stand up, clinging to the bedpost. Watson and Holmes shared a look, but didn’t argue, Watson merely handing me a dressing gown as I limped my way around the room. I shrugged it on, tying it loosely as I wandered, leaning on the furniture.
I turned to head back to the village, ignoring the prickle of unease. I should be hunting this thing. I knew where it was, and I should be dealing with it now.
Father Simeon smiled. “It might elicit comment, but the local manor, Shanbrook Hall, has produced far more people who stand out, than blend in. The lady of the Hall, Eurwen Holmes, has always stood out in a similar fashion. Her sons are a bit more… staid than she, but they are also exceptional men. The younger son arrived earlier today, and invited me to dinner at the hall tomorrow night. I accepted, and did ask that an invitation be extended to you, as well.”
I flicked an ear in response as I considered it. He was still kneeling, side-on to where I stood. He didn’t smell of fear. That was unusual. Wolves were big, and I was bigger. I wasn’t exactly a petite woman, and shifting didn’t make me gain or lose any mass. A 200 pound woman became a 200 pound wolf. Most wolves, the ones that stay that way, tend to cap out at 180, but those are rare. Mostly they weigh in at under 100.
The food was good, despite being somewhat simple. I smiled as I heard the brownie tutting behind me.
<That can wait, now that it’s out of the hands of someone who would abuse it. But I did want to talk to you, yes.>
The carriage rattled to a stop in front of the old pile, and a familiar footman helped him alight. Mycroft nodded to him, attention arrested by Sherlock and Watson arguing with the men from the second carriage. He was surprised to recognize the leader as Lord Acton.
Watson raised a brow. “I’ve never heard elementals to answer someone who wasn’t a mage before.” He shrugged as a shimmer coated the air around them. “Then again, I always heard that wolfwalkers are just shy of demons.”
He smiled and inclined his head, but didn’t rise. Points for bravery, at least. I sat taller than him.
“Good. Poor man was completely blindsided. I found this in his luggage, as well,” she added, handing over a sealed envelope.
I followed the gesture, then nodded. I’d need to be among humans long enough to figure out what was happening. And where I was. I eyed the pack as the rain slowed to a minor drizzle. In truth, I was still a little out of it from the transition. I grabbed the pack in my teeth, intending to find a slightly drier place to spend the night.
Lots of content elementals meant that whatever was gathering power wasn’t using elementals for strength.
<He will meet you in the garden, Mage.> It cocked its head, then continued. <It is likely that nothing will happen until moonrise.>
“Mr. Hunter. I have been informed that you wished to see this, and to speak with me.” He held up the burnt tome, and I nodded.
I shook my head and approached the town. The fun thing about being a wolf is how few people actually recognize wolves when they see them. Act the right way and everyone just thinks you’re a big dog. People can be blind about the strangest things.
The window to my room was open, and I jumped through it, shifting as I hit the ground. The brownie was waiting, foot tapping in annoyance.
Once I was out of sight of the diner, I changed my course. Some of the local men had decided to make a try for me, and I didn’t want to run into anyone on the way out of town. I hopped a small fence and  trudged across a vacant lot, heading to the woods. Once I was fully under the trees and away from any prying eyes, I took a deep breath.
The room was silent as they watched Fox free the remaining elementals. Mycroft had paled when the sylph asked for release, but he said nothing, simply standing as silent witness. Holmes didn’t move, eyes fixed on the image of the black wolf. He had seen the hesitation before she had killed the sylph.
I circled the cottage slowly, more out of necessity than a tactical choice. I doubt I could have run if my life depended on it. I could feel the oily magic of the rogue mage around the door and the windows. Not the rest of the cottage, though. Granted, it was stone, so I couldn’t go through a wall, either.
The cages could be stronger, but the children would sleep until he was ready for them. It would be fine.
“Why should we? The wolf can break itself on the elementals, and we can take out the rogue mage.” He shrugged. “It is possible some of the brats will die, but-“
My hand dropped to my neck, lightly brushing the scars circling my throat as the smile fell from my face. “Exile.”
I spared one final thought for my belongings as I drifted off. I really hoped they didn’t touch my books. I enjoyed the stories of Sherlock Holmes, and I’d miss them if they took those from me.
<Things are not always what they seem. Lies have been told so often they seem as true as fact. There is a darkness in Hewe-Upon-Arun, and allies, if you can see past the lies. Trust your instincts, and trust in Holmes. More than you know hangs in the balance.> So saying, the sylph released him, dancing through the open window after its fellows.
Watson nodded. “So, the poison, minor cuts, at least one that will require stitches, and what else?”
But I could no more change my nature than the Roc. I bit the bonds, freeing the bird, and dove to one side as the massive beak stabbed at where I was. Too close. I could feel a line of fire along my side. Damn thing had caught me.
I remembered why that wasn’t a suggested attack as the toxins that acted as its blood and bile flooded my mouth.
True, I could go back home, grovel. They’d take me back. Advantage of being AFAB. We never kicked up anywhere near enough females. But the pack would force me to mate, marry, and breed. Stay sequestered away from any rogue mages, and the duty my blood demanded. While that might be fine for the soulshifters in the pack, I was a skinchanger. My nature wouldn’t allow me to stay behind.
“If the house is what you want than alright. Do you have any other problems or will the amendment to the property be enough.” Greg watched Denise shuffle in her chair, she read over the list again tapping her acrylic nails against the table top as she did so.
‘What part would you like to discuss Gregory,’ His name sounds more like a purr than anything, this man is the only one that still uses his full name and Greg reckons it shouldn’t sound as sensual as it does,
Greg spotted Francis walking slightly further back and stopped momentarily. Waiting for him to catch up, he crouched down to mimic refastening his shoe lace. When he saw the two polished shoe covered feet stop just in his line of sight he turned his head to mutter quietly, “Do we know who he is?”
When Greg was younger Christmas was his favourite time of year. No matter how much money his family may or may not have had Christmas Day was always special; it was the one day a year when you could guarantee every member of the family would be under one roof, around one table. In their family missing Christmas dinner was equal to kicking the dog or blaspheming in their mother’s presence and Greg loved it. For the first thirty years of his life he never missed a Christmas dinner or a Christmas day with his family. His mother never failed to adorn his head with a foolish tinsel halo and his father never learnt to water down his punch. Yes, Christmas for the Lestrade family meant coming together as one group to share in the warm glow of their home. That all changed for Greg when he met his wife.
‘Tell me.’ It was an order and his tone did nothing to hide that, upon hearing the Detective's inhalation of breath, Mycroft made a judgment call and pressed the blue button on his telephone system, he'd used said button twice before and both in relation to incidents Sherlock had been central in creating, all communication through the office was now private, a data blackout, the normal surveillance footage and recordings would only replay white noise. It was supposed to be used for matters of national security but something about this conversation had Mycroft on edge, an adrenaline rush started surging through his veins.
He opens his mouth the tell Sherlock this, to advise him to abandon John in favour of Lestrade who is tall and distinguished in every way John is short and podgy.
‘Perhaps that is true, I have found myself more effected by sentiment since Mina has arrived,’ John thinks even admitting to this is a massive step for Mycroft, ‘John would you like me to cancel the dinner this evening, I assure you everyone would understand if  didn’t want to leave Mina.’ It was tempting, he’d already been nervous about leaving her alone with Mrs Hudson but he wanted Mina to have a relationship with at least one set of her grandparents, he doubted his mother would be enthusiastic once he informed her, as such he’d been avoiding the task for reasons he wouldn’t want to raise with Mycroft, not only that but John admitted to a degree of fascination in relation to the pair, the few conversations Sherlock had shared with John around the subject had created a mixed image, John wanted to know the reality of their personalities.
‘Yes Mr Lestrade, I am, but I have to admit for once you have caught me by surprise, I had not anticipated or expected a call. Although I assure you it is not unwelcome,’ he repressed the question that lingered on his tongue, it had become instinctual through the years of their contact to ask what disaster his brother was responsible for, he had missed the camaraderie between himself and the Detective Inspector over his brother’s antics. Mycroft missed his brother more however missed his sneer, condescension and the pure love he had felt every time Sherlock had laughed in his presence, even at his expense.  It had been four months, four months of grey and grief. Losing the only soul Mycroft had always loved had destroyed whatever hold on sentiment he had maintained. There would have been no point without Sherlock.
Lying as a wolf under a bush in a torrential rainfall is boring. So I closed my eyes and stretched my senses out, looking for any fellow wolves nearby.
There were other scars, criss-crossing my face and body, marks of fights with mages, elementals, the occasional human or animal, but the mark on my throat was the one that would always hurt the most.
The dining room was empty of the priest, but a covered tray sat at the place I’d sat at the night before.
Mary was there, obviously waiting. There was a tea service set, but it appeared untouched as she paced the length of the room. She stopped at the sound of his tread in the hall and she turned to meet him.
Dr. John H. Watson closed the door to his office with a sigh, locking it before turning down the street. His practice was enjoyable, and his life generally looking much better now than when he had first returned to London. He had a wife, friends, and a comfortable income from selling his versions of Holmes’s adventures.
He raised the silver blade he was sharpening, gazing at the edge in the lamp light. It was sharp enough. He set it aside, making final checks of the alter and the cages.
“He can’t possibly go on. He’s half-dead already,” Holmes exclaimed, transfixed by the scrying bowl.
He broke off as she yanked the letters from his hands. “I’ll see these get where they need to now. The post would take too long. You go keep an eye on him.”
There was a tinkle of laughter. <A simple trap. If we went too close, we would be bound.> Holmes got the impression of a languid shrug. <It was simple enough. And if we had time, we could have freed ourselves.>
I shook my head. “Most of that was incredibly off topic. Yes, I do want a bond. I want a pack, I want somewhere I belong, I want a home.” I blinked back the tears the thought brought on. “But you need to sort out your shit without adding my issues to it.”
“Yet you want to keep it.” Holmes was studying my face, and I could feel his brushing against the bond.
Holmes took the sack as Davy raised both hands to his mouth, whistling sharply. The chatter in the yard stopped as everyone turned to face the pair. Holmes suppressed a smile as he addressed the crowd.
They didn’t like that I was trans. They didn’t like that I could hold my own against any skinchanger I’d met. They wouldn’t allow me to run a pack. I could. I was strong enough to hold the whole pack in line during a hunt, and I could follow what the soulchangers did better than anyone else in my pack.
The salamander studied me in silence for some time. I could feel the tingle at the back of my mind, announcing the approach of other elementals. I cracked one eye open. The gnome wasn’t too surprising. Earth elementals were hard to avoid, especially in the woods. The undine in the trickle of a stream was a little shocking, especially how quickly the salamander appeared. And the sylph, well, they always liked spying on people. But having all four elements represented, without asking or summoning? That was out of the ordinary.
Something that big, to shield itself that well and that quickly…. There was no way I’d be able to fight that alone.
His heart twisted at the thought. Yes, he’d wanted Watson, still did, but now was hardly the time to focus on his own wants.
He sent a simple coded message to the Solar Council, alerting them to the presence of the Wolfwalker. Holmes was waiting when he left, and they returned to Shanbrook, each focused on his own thoughts.
“Quite.” He settled in at the table, eyes dancing. “So, Mr. Hunter, I assume you are the mysterious visitor Father Simeon mentioned?”
“Well, at least you seem to be recovering. I’ve sent round to Drs. Anstruther and Jackson to handle your patients for a few days, to give you some space.”
Watson scowled, then seemed to consider it. “It might also get them to help with Mary, if they believe that I’ve seduced you….”
Light began pouring from his hands alongside the bowl, and a mist rose on the surface of the water. In the cloud of mist, they could see a large, black wolf, running over the fields. Mycroft’s eyebrow rose as he watched.
I went along with it, noting the sympathetic amusement on the faces of the adults we passed. Names and occupations were shouted at me as I was swept along, but none of them seemed to be ascribed to any particular adult. Mentally, I shrugged. I’d get more formal introductions from the adults later. For now, I’d just let the kids show me what they wanted to.
Well, there wasn’t much I could do now. I mean, there was, but I hated getting rained on if I could avoid it, and I needed more information anyway. To borrow a quote, I could deal with it tomorrow. After all, tomorrow was another day.
The sylph nodded, and I closed my eyes briefly. I hated this part. The sylph fell apart under my fangs, and I felt the spell weaken.
“I have felt the beginnings of one such, in the countryside near the village. I can’t quite sense where it is coming from, but….”
I sat up again, wrapping my arm around my knee. All four elementals were arranged across from me, watching.
That was odd. I know we aren’t exactly common, but usually one could find signs of a pack within a few miles. It was hard to scowl as a wolf, but I did my best, flattening my ears as I settled down to meditate. Stilling my mind let me spread my senses out further, covering hundreds of miles.
