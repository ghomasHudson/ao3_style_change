Cas sighed and closed his book, but didn’t move from his spot.
Cas signed.
that will happen. Cas wants him, he told him so on Saturday night.
The other three stared at them in confusion, having no clue as to what they’d just witnessed.
“Why do you do all of this?” She questions. “I guess I just… I don’t understand how you do all of this without even knowing why?”
Dean indicated to the phone in his hand. “Sorry… I was uh… having a meeting with Professor Callehassi when I had to take this phone call. The room was empty so I thought I’d just answer it in here.”
Not long after the child’s birth did their father abandon him, choosing to leave Earth once and for all to be with his lover in heaven. The child was left with the shepherd and the seamstress, raised as a member of their colony. However, none of them could predict the vitality the child possessed, a power so dangerous yet pure. A vitality that would be passed down from generation to generation, until the end of time.

With that, he sent Claire a small smile before dismissing himself and heading upstairs. While John unwound himself from work, Claire helped Mary cook dinner in the kitchen, a simple pasta dish for the three of them to have. Mary had insisted that Claire stay the night since she hadn’t planned anywhere to go. Although hesitant first—she eventually agreed, especially after she messaged and go the thumbs up from Jody.
“Well, I’m assuming all the other monsters, in the other fortresses, disappeared the same way. The funny thing is, it looks a lot like the goo that is part of The Empty. It is almost as if… those monsters… were extensions of himself?”
Cas finished dressing and turned to face Dean, grinning.
It’s their usual Saturday morning, the two of them lounging together in the living room. They’ve been living together for three months in the apartment Cas has leased for about a year. However, Dean has practically been living there since their first month of dating. Dean’s on one couch typing up the end of semester reports that are due to go out in a couple of weeks, while Cas is going over his finances (like the biggest nerd he is). They have some quiet music playing in the background and the smell of their coffees lingering in the air. It’s honestly one of those blissful mornings that Dean wishes could last forever.
Dean knew that if it weren’t for the social life that college offered, he would’ve quit college within the first few weeks.
By horseback, it would only take a few hours until they reached the first destination of their journey. They were heading to the land in the north of Grace Island, the snowy region called Aether. It was there that the fae resided, a species that was known for their wings and magic and only native to the island, due to the fact that its soil was so rich with magic and vitality. The fae were beautiful creatures, well-loved and adored by the human citizens of Grace’s Island. Every faery had a set of transparent wings on their backs and glittery magic that swirled at their fingertips. Yet, each of them were different and unique. You never saw two faeries that were the same.
Kevin ended up spending his days lingering around the university, sitting in Dean’s lectures and others. Being dead, he had nothing better to do than to try and study as much as he could during his infinite stay on Earth. Kevin continued to learn everything his pre-med major had to offer, before continuing onto engineering, mathematics, biology and chemistry. He was a brain full of knowledge, which is why he was the first person Dean decided to turn to.
There, almost crushed beneath him, is a Silent Prince.
“I say we spend the rest of the afternoon up on the hills. I would like to investigate some of the wildlife here while I have the chance and I know you have been aching for the chance to practice some drills of yours in peace.”
It was a few days before Christmas, a crisp and cold afternoon. That night, Cas and his family were leaving for Washington, to visit their aunt and uncle for Christmas. In order to prepare himself for days on end of praying and church visits, Cas visited the Winchester household hours before, to spend some time with Dean and enjoy the other side of the holiday.
Between the four of them and the two other hunters, the wendigo was laid to rest. Easy as pie. After promising to grab a beer with them sometime, the four Winchesters waved goodbye as the two hunters drove out onto the open road. It was then that Sam suggested an addition to their trip, one that Dean was purely against.
“Charlie,” Dean says.
The story always embarrassed Dean to a certain degree, especially the wistful way his mother spoke about it. But to Castiel, it was his favourite story. He was always happy to hear it, no matter how many times Mary had recited it.
“And Charlie has met them all, they signed the treaties. Today we are here to celebrate a new order amongst our land, leaving the past behind and all of that.”
An hour later, Castiel found himself in the small patch of woods on the Aether hills.
“How’d you know my name?” he asks.
His first thought is:
He gets up close to it and hacks it hands off with his sword. Then he aims for the legs. Once the Nephilim is just a husk of a body, he brings his sword down and slices off the head, killing it cold.
A selfish and guilty part of Dean wished he could call this man beside him a stranger, nothing but a fling. Maybe that way, it would be easier to leave.
, Meg and Castiel sitting at a table making out with each other. All in all, those possibilities seemed to be more realistic then what he was seeing now. Because a quiet, empty café was not what he expected.
“Forever,” he remarks, “I could get used to that.”
A genuine smile formed on Claire’s lips.
His friends from back home had travelled to visit him for the weekend, only getting to Sioux Falls in the late afternoon. Benny had travelled from Louisiana, where he lived with his wife Andrea and their daughter. Garth lived in Missouri with his wife Bess, the two of them only having just married a few months prior. Charlie was currently living the single life in Wisconsin, working as an I.T. girl at a powerful firm. Due to the busy, successful lives they all lived, they rarely got the time to catch up. However, every once in a while, they made the time.
serving coffees. He was serving coffees to the most impatient of people. Shop owners, teachers, parents—all people who needed their daily caffeine fix before a day of errands and work. People huffed and tapped their feet, crossed their arms and narrowed their eyes at Dean. They were an intolerant bunch of people, but they were Dean’s most loyal of customers.
Castiel smiled, “Go Dean. Meg and I will not be long. Go and do some teaching. I am sure the soldiers will be far more capable of training than I.”
It’s early in the morning when Dean wakes up, the dream fresh in his head. However, as he stirs into reality, he realises that it wasn’t a dream. It was way too vivid to be a dream and way too real. And in that dream, he saw the prince, actually
“Why? He’s funny and confident. What’s not to like about him?”
He had said. “
by the Beach Boys. He knew Cas loved banter and knew many offensive jokes. He also knew that Cas was incredibly smart, despite how hard he tried to hide it.
He didn’t speak until Dean was almost seven. It was during Dean’s fifth viewing of Toy Story, when Cas made a comment about Buzz Lightyear being ‘a dumbass.’ Dean had giggled and Cas had turned his gaze to him, surprised. Dean realised that Cas was funny and found himself chatting to him throughout the course of the movie, out of his mother’s earshot.
Castiel couldn’t help but smile, knowing that Dean’s words were truthful.
“Sir Dean,” he greets, “I see you have returned from your slumber.”
Dean continued to grin.
Cas snorted.
your matching costumes. Real Bonnie and Clyde!”
“Oh… uh… you’re welcome Cas.”
“He’s so stupidly co-dependent with the Deafie. It’s almost as if Shurley’s dumbass can’t function without Winchester doing everything for him.” Alastair Smith chimed in.
As Cas began to date Meg—he began to spend more time out with her. Soon, Dean was rarely seeing his best friend, apart for some brief conversations extremely late at night or just before breakfast. With Cas’ schedule being taken up by college and work also, his friend rarely had time to spare.
. It laid there on the ground, covered in particles of dirt, oil and blood and for a moment, it looked like any other sword they had in their kingdom. But as Castiel looked closer, he noticed the soft, ethereal glow that surrounded it. A pale, soft blue that seemed to thrum and vibrate. Through Castiel’s eyes, it made the sword stick out like a sore thumb. An essence of light, amidst all the darkness.
Dean brought his other hand in to grip onto Cas’ other shoulder. He couldn’t believe he was touching him, that they were able to have actual physical contact. It wasn’t the same as touching another human, due to the temperature and the semi-permanence of it. He didn’t feel as solid as another person, more like jello. Yet, it was still something.
“I don’t even know how to change the oil in my car, or a flat tyre, Dean.” Cas responded, with a small chuckle. “I’m pretty sure you know a lot more about that area than I do.”
Claire winced and Dean nodded.
“Is it because I ate the last slice of pie last night? You said it was okay…”
While Pam continues to talk, Dean can’t help but freeze. All of a sudden, he feels his blood begin to run cold.
“Look… I know you mean well and you’re just being nice. And I’m glad,
all of this?”
Cas then stands, sending Dean a forced smile. “I’m afraid you’ll have to sleep out here tonight as my guest room is now Grace’s room. I’ll go grab some sheets. I apologise for the early night, I’m usually in bed by nine as Grace is an early riser.”
“How’s the wedding planning going?” Dean asked and listened to his brother go on a tangent about whether they should have lilies or roses at the wedding reception. Dean, not knowing nor caring about flowers, listened with a slight disinterest.
Now, as he neared the city he called home, he just hoped that Dean would forgive him for everything.
Cas fixes his tie slightly before grabbing his coat off the back of his chair, “I’m fine with that. But may I propose an alternative?”
He knew, wholeheartedly, that Hester really did not care.
Hester curled a strand of her blonde hair behind her ear and he could see the hint of a smirk on her lips.
“The reason I don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day… isn’t just because I miss Cas… it’s because I will never forgive myself for letting him go.”
She turned in the direction that Cas was standing, almost as if she was looking him straight in the eye.
missed one of their weekly meetings. He’d wanted to contact Jody to ask if Claire was alright, but didn’t want to come off as creepy for caring about the teenager. So, to say he was relieved to see Claire there, would be an understatement.
“Do you want kisses?”
Castiel opened his mouth to ask her,
By the time the night comes to an end, Dean’s had another champagne glass and a half, only stopping when Cas cuts him off. With Cas only having two drinks the entire night, he agrees to take Dean back to his place. They watch the newlyweds stumble into their limousine and say their goodbyes to family and friends before Cas helps Dean stagger towards the car park, ready to head home and attempt to sleep off his inevitable hangover.
Now the room had definitely gotten colder. Dean felt a shiver at the bottom of his spine. A breeze had also begun to swirl around the room. He heard Missouri huff.
He read about Mors’ deeds, how he is the one that those who die see. Apparently he appears to them and guides them to the afterlife. Dean believed that was total bullshit but he decided he’d ask the current expert.

She sighed.
Dean gulps. “Well is there another flight I can get on?”
Charlie beams bright.
“Sounds like a plan,” Dean said with a grin, “now are you going to keep standing on the doorstep, or are you going to come in so we can talk this whole thing out?”
He nods, before turning to look at Charlie. The two of them go to leave, but are stopped.
“Hello Dean.”
Tense silence falls over them as Amara and Inias take in her words. Amara is the first to break it.
Dean shrugs, “Fine by me.”
“Well… uh… actually, Dean’s slumber caused him to lose his memories,” Charlie admits, “I… I don’t think he remembers Anna. At least not right now.”
Over the course of a couple hours, Dean shifts from a thirty-three year old man to a sulking, petulant child.
She ran up to the counter and slammed the car keys down, a gigantic smile filling up her entire face.
He knows Cas’ words are meant to make him happy. He knows he should be jumping into Cas’ arms right now, dragging him home to his apartment so that he can fuck him senseless. This is his soulmate, a hot, smart, caring guy that Dean should be so lucky to have.
knew something was wrong. Michael was very stiff and visibly agitated and despite how hard he tried to keep his composure, Dean
The memory was still fresh in his mind, gnawing away at him as he cleaned. He was happy Jody had interrupted them because there was one point Dean had made a point of not mentioning to Claire.
However, it was obvious what his friend’s intentions were for college and soon, he’d leave Dean behind—no point bringing along baggage.
“Werewolves have yellow eyes and long nails, almost clawlike. To kill them, you need to drive your sword straight through their heart. Please be wary of these creatures on your travels.”
needed to know. However, there are things that you must know and only you.”
They went into the kitchen where Mary made both her boys some toast. Dean happily munched on his while Sammy ate his in small pieces, babbling the words ‘Dee’ and ‘nom, nom, nom’ as he ate. Dean watched as his mom had her coffee and immediately noticed how much more awake she became. After Dean finished, his mom ran him a bath to wash off the jelly which covered his mouth and hands. He was then dressed in his clothes for the day—which consisted of the school’s yellow polo and black shorts. By the time he was back downstairs and his mother was packing his bag for school, his dad wondered downstairs in his work uniform, ready to head off for his shift. Upon seeing Dean in his school clothes, his dad beamed and ruffled his hair.
Lawrence was surprisingly busy for 9am in the morning, people hustling and bustling about their days. Claire popped into the first coffee shop she could find. The relief that flooded through her as the caffeine entered her body was enough to give her back some of the motivation she lost. With determination, she drank her cup of coffee and had a look through the town, trying to see if she could find anything that connected her to the Shurley family.
The question came out hesitant, almost as if it were a question within a question. Castiel almost drummed his fingers on the table as he contemplated his answer, but knew it would be impolite. He wondered what the correct answer was, should he lie? Should he tell the truth? He did not know which answer would be more acceptable. However, in the end, he decided that the truth would be best.
Dean’s heart clenched. He knew he shouldn’t jealous or in the slightest bit upset. He hadn’t seen Cas in ten years and it was obvious that his friend would have had some sort of relationship during that time, even marriage. He also noted Cas mentioned that it was an ex, meaning
Duma paused for a few seconds and after one last glance up the stairs, she stepped away from the door to let Dean in.
Castiel leans down and grabs Dean’s hand with his own. He wants to argue and say that he is already home, right here with Dean, but deems it unnecessary to negate the point.
his brain cells leaving one by one. So, needless to say, he hated the well…
“What would you like?” He vocally asked the teen, noticing that the line of customers behind her was slowly becoming impatient.
Days like today, he was constantly reminded of Dean’s position in his life. Dean was required to be by him consistently and protect him from harm’s way. While that position was once a burden to Castiel, he now would be forever grateful for it, as it brought Dean into his life. Yet, Dean’s role reminded him that Dean was not here because he wanted to be, or because he really,
She gave a swift nod in response, before turning her attention to Dean who stood beside him. Immediately upon laying her eyes on him, her nose wrinkled in disgust and her gaze hardened.
“Don’t feel as if I am pressuring you,” Dean said, “but when I had nightmares as a child, I would seek out my parents in their bed. There, my mother would wrap me in her arms and hold me close. Somehow, it made all my fears fade away. I know it may sound strange, but if you are feeling fearful, sometimes being close to someone else can help.”
Dean finishes up the desserts and leaves them to chill while he helps Cas choose a movie. After questioning Cas’s sanity for even
The man stares at him in surprise, the blood drained from his face.
“Hello, Dean.” His boyfriend says, turning his attention to him. Dean smiles.
the boy had said through quivering lips,
“But really, it’s like you said. I’ve had time to mourn. I only have scattered memories of her, all pretty superficial. A memory of her singing me to sleep, making me soup when I was sick, making me pie for dessert, cutting the crusts off my sandwich. I can’t remember the sound of her voice and if it wasn’t for pictures, I wouldn’t remember what she looks like. There is always going to be this… this
“Please go now, Dean. The fate of Grace Island rests with you.”
This is a nightmare.
Cas replied.
He grins but shakes his head. “Nah, I was on the red-eye to Wisconsin. But because of your flight hiccup, it pushed us back as well.”
He was out in the kingdom’s gardens at the time. They were located in the northern area of the castle, just beyond the western courtyard and the eastern docks. Two knights stood on guard nearby, watching as the little prince wandered around examining bees. He had been absorbed in watching the way they moved and how they flew from flower to flower, that he had not noticed the other boy creep up on him.
“Sure, kid.”
and it infuriated Cas to his core. Dean was able to communicate with others, even without the use of sign language. Most people just weren’t willing to try.
The realisation that he was in love with his loyal knight.
Every part of his store was decorated with holiday decorations, from snowman cut-outs to wreaths on all the doors. Tinsel hung off every bannister and counter and a small Christmas tree was put up in the corner of the store—the presents placed under it being gifts for the local homeless shelter Dean frequented with bakery goods. The most important part of the Christmas festivities though? The Christmas themed food.
Dean and Castiel exchanged a glance and the prince knew that the same thought was circling through Dean’s mind.
“Eventually, I came to  accept it though.” Cas finished.
Cas told Dean.
Cas understood what Dean meant, knowing that it was a problem he’d suffered with before. Cas found it easy to interpret, considering he grew up with ASL as his first language. He did sometimes find it difficult to talk and sign at the same time, but when he was just signing what other people said, it was as easy as breathing. However, it wasn’t always as easy for other people and it meant that more often than not, Dean got left out of spoken conversations. It gave Dean headaches, as he tried to lipread and gain context clues as to what was happening. It never usually happened when Cas was around, because he always made sure that Dean was included in a vocal conversation. However, tonight was an exception.
With a sigh, he took a gentle step backwards towards the staircase. However, as soon as his foot made contact with the carpeted floor, a large creak echoed through the hall, bouncing and ricocheting off the walls. Castiel froze, immediately turning to look behind him, in the direction of where the guards were. He listened quietly, trying to hear if any of them happened to be approaching. He waited through a few beats of silence, trying to detect the sound of footsteps or any sort of movement. In the end, all he could hear was nothing but soundlessness, which made him let out a breath of relief. However, before he could bask in his consolation, something made him freeze again.
They both looked over at Dean, who looked like he hated being put on the spot. However, after a moment to think, Dean nodded. Yes, he would go with her.
Dean just huffed a small laugh and leaned back in his chair.
They both gave her another hug before accepting the pie in gratitude. They stood and waved goodbye as both cars drove off back to Kansas. They waited there until they could no longer see them in the distance.
Unfortunately, Cas and Meg were still together and better than ever. When Meg wasn’t over constantly, Cas was out at her’s. Dean still found himself rarely seeing his friend… to the point he practically began to long for him.
“I don’t think I ever thought I’d end up here.” Dean says honestly. Before he met Cas, he never thought he’d be able to do this. Be up in front of his family with a ring around his finger, with his arms around his husband and soulmate. He glances to the side quickly, seeing his family all sitting at the same table smiling at them. Kate is snapping photos religiously, with his dad making the exact same face he did during Adam’s first dance. Sam and Jess are smiling, Jess’ arms wrapped tightly around her swollen belly, Dean’s little niece two months away from being born. Adam and Michael sit behind them, huge grins on their face, obviously elated seeing both their brothers up there together. Even Gabe is smiling like a maniac, looking the happiest Dean’s ever seen him. And considering Gabe is never
It only got that much harder.
Dean watches as Cas leans in, ready to hook his arm around Dean to help support him over to the car. As he gets closer, Dean begins to feel hot and flustered. Cas’ face is inches from him, his soft pink lips practically all Dean has in his line of sight. The desire he’s been pushing down all night attempts to bubble to the surface, the attraction he feels too undeniable to ignore for any longer.
If there was one thing that Castiel Novak was familiar with, it was the concept of change.
In a quick movement, he turns and opens his sock drawer. He rummages until he finds the buried envelope and pulls it out. Cas is watching each movement cautiously.
Cas felt as the blood flooded his face which made Dean almost crumble in a laughing fit. He had no idea what he looked like, but he knew that his head must’ve definitely resembled a plump tomato. They stood like that for a few moments, until Cas got his face looking relatively back to normal and Dean was able to calm down. Dean then told Cas to head into the living room so that he could grab dessert.
The teenager just shot him a look, curling the broom up in the crook of her elbow so that she could still sign.
“I do not want you to feel as if you are required to be with me every minute of the day. I know that my mother believes that should be your job, but I can always have another member of the royal guard with me. I do not wish for you to feel that you need to be here out of a sense of obligation.”
He watched as the Nephilim walked forward, the sheen of its golden coat shimmering under the midday sun. One of the researchers had the control panel in his hand, bidding the Nephilim to move where he wanted it to. Castiel wished more than anything that he could be down there with him. He missed when he was amongst them, researching and tinkering with the Nephilims -- doing what he loved most.
“I’m heading to bed.” Dean snapped, shutting off the TV. Cas turned to look at him in a state of bewilderment.
He looked up towards his house for a moment, absentmindedly calculating how many trips he’d have to make, when he saw that the neighbouring house was no longer empty. Standing in front of the mailbox, with his back to Cas, was a man. He couldn’t see his face, just his broad shoulders, the groove of his back and the black cap he wore on his head. He assumed from his build that he was a man, but didn’t want to presume without at least first introducing himself.
He signed angrily, again causing Cas to stop.
or if it was tainted by my own prior knowledge. I kept our bond silent as I wanted to get to know you first, not jump straight into things without having more knowledge about who you are. Most soulmates jump right into a relationship with each other, without exploring their deeper connection. Tonight, I’ve learnt so much about you, about the wonderful man I am truly lucky to have as my soulmate. I know now how grateful I am that we are apparently destined.”
Dean signed.
The man blinks for a moment before smiling, “My brother pointed you out to me earlier. He wanted to make sure Gabriel and I were relatively familiar with the family that he has now married into.”
She glared at him but did as she was told, looking around the dark hall and listening. It takes her a moment, but eventually, her face brightens with an idea.
“Hello Cas. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“When I heard you say the words that I have spent the last fifteen years staring in the mirror at, God, I couldn’t have been happier. My feelings had been confirmed and I was almost about to tell you, let it be solidified between us. But all I could wonder was if this was really real, if our bond was truly there. I felt this awe when I saw you, but at the same time, I couldn’t help but wonder if this feeling was
“Do you want kisses?”
“What’s wrong?” Cas asked.
“My entire life, I’ve been destined to be a knight.” Dean said. “It was what my parents wanted me to be, as it was a duty that carried through my family. Each of us was a member of the royal guard. I was the youngest of all my family to not only become a part of the guard, but to be the chief knight of your protection. It was an honour, it still
Being in the foster care system growing up, Claire fabricated these unique stories about her life. The one she told the most was about how her dad joined the angels. She would say he was off saving the world and her mother was searching in Heaven for him. Of course, there were other variations of this—but this was the most consistent one young Claire stuck to.
(See the end of the chapter for
He looked back at Dean, still ruffled from sleep, who smiled at him.
Thank you again so much for reading!!!
Dean’s eyebrows furrowed. “What reasons?”
“Dean,
However, this time around they happened to be in the area.
SOCIALS:
All Castiel could do was run.
Turns out, Singer Woods was an enigma.
He threw himself in front of Dean with a cry and all of a sudden, he could see nothing but white. A bright light pierced the area around him, blocking his view of everything. At first, panic seized him and he wondered if maybe he had just entered the afterlife. Maybe the blast had actually hit him after all, killing him instantly. Yet, how could he have not felt pain at all? Though before he could ponder that thought, the white began to fade and after blinking his eyes for a few moments, Castiel adjusted his vision back into reality.
Sam rolled his eyes.
Now? He’s running late. Cas’ offices hours end in fifteen minutes. He has fifteen minutes to make it all the way to the university a good ten or so miles from where he is, in the midst of afternoon traffic. As he’s sprinting to his car, he tries to calm his thoughts. He can always go see Cas another day, or try to reach him on the phone. But no rational thought can clear the frenzy in his mind.
Castiel did not envy Dean due to the gifts he got. He envied how
She traces her finger down the spine of the book, a pensive look on her face.
While everyone in Grace Island knew of the woods, it was rare that anyone was able to travel through it. According to word of mouth, the woods were dark, filled with a variety of monsters that lurked in the shadows. It was dangerous and hard to navigate, hence why people rarely stepped inside.
Castiel felt parched, listening as his heart drummed rapidly in his chest. He had known about this prophecy for a while, he knew of the weight that rested on his shoulders. But for some reason, hearing it from the prophet’s mouth, made it all the more daunting.
Dean’s eyes widened.
Warning: Discriminating language shown to Deaf Character
With a relenting sigh, Dean indicated to Claire’s usual spot. She took a hesitant step forward and rested the broom against the wall, before slowly walking to the table and sitting down.
“How do you know?”
However, Charlie had a point.
Was how Mary always finished the story.

She smiled at him.
“And his loyal knight? The one who fought to protect him? Well, Dean, that was you.”

“Well, I am slowly remembering.” He says. “But I am nowhere close to remembering everything. I can’t… I can’t remember myself as a child, or my parents. I can’t remember why I became a knight or most of my memories of the castle. It’s just… fragments, hardly everything.”
“I haven’t seen Cas in 11 years.”
The moment broke when Dean lifted himself up onto his forearms, leaning forward to place a soft kiss on Cas’ forehead. He then, in one swift movement, rolled off Cas and onto the carpeted floor of their bedroom. He stretched for a moment and relaxed his muscles, before turning to Cas with a sly look in his eye.
DEAN SMITH
Dean watched as his mom’s eyes widened and small smile formed on her lips.
Dean shrugs, “Sure, go ahead.”
He watched as Missouri hummed to herself, pursing her lips. She quietly settled the bowl down next to the book, before finally lifting her gaze to meet theirs.
Dean. He found himself more determined on school work than ever, paying close attention to what his lecturers were saying so that he could block out the sound of girls gushing over what their boyfriends bought them as a romantic gift.
“Dean!” An angry voice called out, one that could only belong to Sir John.
was he going to speak to him in the middle of a funeral. It was then that Cas pointed and indicated to something at the front of the church. Dean followed his friend’s gaze and instantly his stomach churned at the sight.
“Which I’m guessing is the age of your little boy?” Dean’s mom chimed, her gaze set on something behind Michael.
Cas closed the door behind him and tentatively approached Dean. He lifted his hands to sign, but Dean stopped him with a shake of his head.
“Where’s the crown?”
“Now, about your training…”
Wanting to forget about Meg for just one night.
A part of Dean wants to protest and tell Pam to reschedule for a later date. He only just finished his first headlining tour, right after going on two back-to-back tours as an opening act. What he’d thought would be a short gig with 30 Seconds to Mars back in 2008, turned into a fourteen-month adventure across the world after Coldplay decided to take him on board. He began his tour with Coldplay only three days after finishing the first one, and he’d never before experienced that much
“Now.” He says, knowing that they will hear him.
… We weren’t like that. Well… he wasn’t just a fling. I mean he was, but… I guess there was more to it. I felt something with him? And… like I said, I trusted him with that secret. He knew that I was only there temporarily, that I was going to leave. We agreed to not contact each other. Yet… if what you’re saying he wrote is true…”
For the second time in a minute, Dean couldn’t help pause as his brain registered the language. He was unsure as to why this girl was asking who he was and why she knew to use sign language with him. Though, it didn’t take him long for his brain to remember the words of his long-time friend, Jody Mills.
of trouble, but it beats freezing to death.”
Without even thinking, Dean leant over and touched Cas. It first started with his fingers slowly seeping into his energy just like he’d done earlier that night. He watched as Cas closed his eyes as if he were in a bliss and hummed a low, deep sound that rumbled from the back of his throat. Dean carefully reached in further feeling the energy as it pulsed around his hand.  The more he reached in, the more Cas seemed to seize up as if he were in shock and pant softly.
Dean answered Cas’ question with a grin.
There was a handwritten note on the top and reluctantly, Dean opened it and began to read.
The wind began to pick up again, swirling around the room ever so slightly.
Charlie doesn’t reply.

She responded.
Charlie scoffs and throws her hands up. “Dean, I don’t know why you’re so worried! You and Cas don’t fight, you
“Go, Dean,” Anna murmurs, “he waits for you.”
“I have no idea how we’re going to get up there,” he whispers.
Dean just stared back sadly.

And with that, he closed his eyes again.
Whoever made this place, doesn’t want it to be found.
As they sat down on the couch, Claire began to sign, immediately going into her story of how she knew Dean. At first, Michael’s face was stone cold, almost as if he didn’t even have the heart to hear a word about Dean. Though as Claire explained more and told more of the stories, she could see him beginning to soften.
Cas frowns at him but does as he’s asked. He puts down the book and stands up, walking over to Dean.
“That makes me feel better,” he says, “thanks Cas.”
was all Dean could see and for a moment, his mind flooded with memories from the past. He paused as the past he had tried so hard to forget, attempted to wriggle itself from the box it had been buried away in. The eyes in front of him were so familiar, yet so different at the same time. It took Dean a second to realise these eyes belonged to a stranger and not the figure his brain had desperately tried to keep hidden away.
Dean looked over at his backpack, which he knew had homework he needed to do over the weekend. There was his spelling list, his math sums and the chapter he needed to read for his literacy assessment. He debated getting a start on them, going downstairs to get his mom to help him. However, he also noticed the small novel he was reading, sitting on his bedside table. After weighing the two options, the novel won.
“I guess this is my stop,” Dean says, hiking his bag onto his shoulder. He’s preparing to say his goodbyes to Charlie, promising to call and text now that they’ve exchanged phone numbers. He, however, is surprised when Charlie stands as well, lifting the handle of her suitcase.
He can’t help but think. He can only imagine how he looks.
After sometime, he felt the noticeable sensation of someone looking at him. As if there were eyes fixed on the back of his head.  He turned slightly to see Dean, who was staring over at him from the archway, a worried frown prominent on his face. Castiel realised his shaky breaths and muffled whimpers must have not been as subtle as he thought. Dean was one of the most attentive people he had ever had the pleasure to meet, so it did not surprise Castiel that the knight was able to pick up on his emotional state.
He replied, obviously curious as to how Dean knew. It was then Dean realised that Meg had never mentioned their encounter to Cas. Dean wasn’t surprised.
“I have never learnt archery,” Charlie admits.
him? It all made sense in a way and reassured Claire that she had done the right thing by coming here.
Cas signed, using the name sign he had given Dean. Dean only saw it every now and then as Cas rarely used it when speaking to him. It was the letter ‘D’ accompanied by the sign for ‘green’. It was fairly similar to Cas’ name sign—which was the letter ‘C’ and the sign for blue.
It all changed eighty years ago, when Castiel’s grandfather and Meg’s grandfather signed a treaty, promising no more war and hatred between the two civilisations. The treaty agreed that the kingdom would donate a yearly supply of seafood, grains and fruit to the town. In exchange, the town would donate some of their finest materials, including creating handcrafted garments. A part of the arrangement was that twice a year, the noble family of Hellian and the royal family would dine together. With one of the meals being in Hellian and the other being in the castle.
Cas and Dean sat and watched the cookies bake, the two of them talking about their week with one another. Cas was in the “nerd” classes as Dean called them, and he was top of the class. As much as Dean teased his friend about it, he was actually incredibly proud. When the cookies were baked and cooled, Duma placed them on a plate and brought them into the living room. The three of them cuddled up on the couch, with Duma putting on a movie for all of them to watch. After deciding on
He stands up to follow Sam out, grabbing the bloody jacket along the way and shrugging it on.
I’m sorry for walking away, and looking back, I wouldn’t make that same mistake again. I was scared and angry, but not once, not even for a second, did I not
“Sorry… I’m thinking. Marking gets boring, you know?” Dean replied, trying to pretend like he hadn’t been admiring the spirit’s face. Cas just continued to smirk.
“What’s up honey?” She inquired, ruffling a hand through Dean’s hair.
Dean blinks. “What do you mean?”
Cas asked Dean when Michael returned to Duma. Dean just shrugged.
“You too.” He said, as if she could hear him. Dean relayed the message, but Missouri’s almost
The Queen takes another step forward, to the point that Dean can see the faint lines of wrinkles, the ones that once showed the woman’s age when she was alive.
She asked.
He recognises himself, although he was much younger. He’s smiling in the panting, big and bright. The woman in the picture is smiling too, cradling him in her arms. She has long blonde hair that falls in curls down her shoulders and atop of his head. Her eyes twinkle in the painting, almost as excited and bright as his own. He doesn’t know whether that was what her eyes actually looked like, or the painter just made her that way, but he likes it nonetheless. A man is also in the painting, standing behind them with the slightest of smiles. He has dark hair and dark eyes as he stares straight ahead. Dean supposes he wasn’t as loving and affectionate as the woman, but he didn’t seem cold or callous. The people in the picture look like a loving family, a
Before Dean can even blink, his hand is reaching for whatever it can grab. It latches onto a large tree branch, gripping it tightly. Dean swings his arm out, wacking the closest one in the head with it. Then, he is up on his feet, doing the same for the other two. Swinging, hitting, swinging, hitting. Dean isn’t even thinking, his brain not computing the situation he is in. His body is working on muscle memory, beating all three monsters to a pulp. Eventually, he watches as all of them collapse to the ground, still alive, but unconscious. When he feels safe to do so, he drops the branch and begins running, running as fast as his legs will take him.
For years, he lived his life in stress.
By the time the sky was painted was an array of warm colours, Castiel and Dean were already on their way towards the grasslands.
Cas smiles for Dean again. He unwraps his arm from Dean’s shoulder and instead, holds out his hand to him. Dean grabs it and entwines their fingers. They then both lay back in unison, so that they can look up at the stars.
By the time the sun was high in the sky, Castiel was drenched with sweat.
The opening chords to
Castiel wanted to tell Benny all about the programming, about every single detail that they had found. Truth was, Castiel was actually the head researcher when it came to the Nephilims. There was no one else in the kingdom that had such intimate knowledge of ancient relics and machinery. The research that he had collected over the years with his father was vital to learning how the machines functioned and so he ended up directing many of the scholars in their tests and trials relating to the Nephilims.
“It’s true. Dean, that guy is head over heels infatuated with you. In fact, before we found out you were soulmates, it worried us. Because we could see how much you both liked each other, and were worried about you both getting hurt. I know you feel hurt and betrayed right now, and you have every right to be, but don’t go throwing away something so beautiful over a feeling that will eventually fade.”
Claire would have been polite and refused—however her stomach grumbled and she decided that she couldn’t turn them down. Especially since this was the woman’s who recipes she feasted upon back in Sioux Falls.
“Can I ask for my breakfast without egg shells?” Cas asks from the table.
Dean paused for a moment to take a deep breath.
By the time Castiel had finished his bowl, the chatter of the faeries died down as the dining hall’s doors opened. Castiel did not need to look up to know who was entering the room. He saw a few faeries quickly scatter, while others just quietly went back to eating. Only one FAERY remained in front of Castiel, looking over at the new person with a roll of their eyes.
“Like who?”
“I am here to return the sword, in hopes that when the time comes, it will be retrieved again.” Castiel stated.
Once he’s changed, he hesitantly moves through the dark until he makes it to an archway. He peeks out, seeing that it leads into a dark hall. He looks both ways, nothing that he can’t see a thing either way. It’s just endless nothing, a black abyss and Dean finds himself scared again. Almost as if it is instinct, he finds his hands trail up to the object hanging from his neck, clutching onto it.
“He knows.” Dean chokes out. “I promise you, he knows.”
Dean swallows, not really sure how to answer. It’s not like he can exactly say:
Cas shrugged.
Castiel hums, leaning back into Dean’s embrace.
Cas took a deep breath, “I was scared. I was scared of losing you and I was scared that I was going to ruin everything. I was scared that you wouldn’t want me in your life anymore.”
One minute, he was there in his bed, Dean’s voice ringing in his ears like bell chimes.
“Mom used to let me help her make them as a last day of summer treat and I would take them to school with me. Mom would only let me take sugary treats on the first day, as a small motivation to get me through a new school year.”
Inias and Amara exchange a look before the woman nods. Inias turns away and exits the room. Moments later, he returns with a large painting in his hands. He goes up to Dean and gently, he places it into his hands.
Dean narrows his eyes at her.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever. I’ll get the ball rolling and call you back on Monday. Enjoy your weekend, because you’re going to have a hell of a week.”
“Yes,” he agreed instantly. To share a bed with Dean, even in a platonic way, was an opportunity that Castiel could not refute.
He proceeded to his lecture, knowing it was way too late to abandon them right before their major assessments. He felt worried and out of it the entire time, trying to do complex algorithms on the board with only half his brain switched on. He kept losing his train of thought and sometimes would repeat things he knew he already said. His students were looking at him as if he’d lost his mind and that’s when he knew he probably shouldn’t have come in that day.

There was a middle aged woman sitting at the desk, typing on the computer. She had dark skin and short, black ringlets. She also had a large bright smile which upon seeing Claire, immediately brightened the room.
The supermarket was fairly busy when they arrived, with many people in the store there for the exact same reason they were. New Years Eve meant parties, which meant most people were hunting for snacks and drinks. Cas and Dean beelined for the chips aisle, stocking their cart full of various potato chips for the evening. Despite having lived together for over six months, the two of them had never hosted an event at their house, excluding the occasional times they had friends over. Having spent Thanksgiving in Chicago with Cas’ family and Christmas in Lawrence with Dean’s family, they decided it was their turn to host a celebration.
They sat in silence, Castiel going back to his drawing and Dean getting out his recess. He unzipped his lunchbox and immediately noticed the three snickerdoodle cookies he had baked with his mom and a large beaming smile formed on his lips. He did a quick side glance at Castiel, who was busy with his sketchbook before grabbing out one of them. He tapped his classmate on the shoulder and the boy jumped, turning to face Dean again.
He unlocked his phone and clicked on the voicemail. With a sigh, he lifted his phone to his ear, prepared to listen to Dean spouting some unintelligible nonsense, before he would call Charlie and make sure that both herself and Dean were home safe.
Instead of seeing the pleasant reaction he expects, Dean watches as Cas tenses up, furrowing his eyebrows.
“When did you accept it?” Dean asked Cas.
The voice doesn’t reply.

As he laid in Dean’s arms, he felt as if it were Heaven on Earth. He could never have imagined that he would experience a moment like this -- wrapped in Dean’s arms, safe and sound from the peril of monsters and entities alike. While he knew this moment would not last for long, that these few moments was all he was going to get, he made it his mission to cherish every single second.
“No,” Dean replies, “no I’m uh… painfully single.”
After the students left, Dean rushed to the bathroom before his next lecture. He walked in and looked around, sleuthing at toilet stalls to see if anyone was in the bathroom. When he realised the coast was clear, he took a deep breath and leant against the sink.
“My dear Castiel, you are so
Castiel rolled his eyes, but could not help the small smile that pulled on his lips from Dean’s teasing.
“Go away Claire.” He grumbled. “I’m in no mood to talk.”
Dean signed, taking a hesitant step into the room.
“No, Your Highness,” she said to him in a soft tone, “I told your mother, Her Majesty, all
And just like when Dean told Claire, Cas winced.
He was also angry at Kevin, wondering if his friend had done something stupid that cause him to be placed into the veil. He wanted to punch something, throw something across the room, do
When Cas Novak moved from Chicago to the small city of Lawrence, Kansas -- he expected to experience the things he’d seen in movies.
Castiel could not save them.
Castiel nodded solemnly, “I understand Mother.”
“You don’t mind if I sit here, do you? I find that the chairs are far worse for my back than the floor and this spot you got here is nice and cosy.”
“Charlie!” he called out grumpily, “I told you not to come over until noon.”
Then, he looks down.
“Well, I am glad to hear that the fortress is running smoothly. I am happy that the journey here brought positive news.”
“Why are you apologising?” he asks with the familiar tilt of his head, “Dean, you have nothing to apologise for.”
Sam grinned, “Good answer, if you’re wanting to score points with me.”
Cas thought about that as he drove, conjuring up an image of Dean’s soft smile, as if it were as easy as breathing. In a way, when they would go on those drives, Cas was worried as well. Whenever Dean was in a mood, Cas found himself worried for his friend; whether it be due to the strained relationship Dean had with his father, or the fact that his friend was a perfectionist. He was worried that Dean was beating himself up too much, letting himself fall into a pit of despair and a cycle of negative thought patterns.
Yet, he still hoped that he would have the opportunity to talk to him again.
“I um… Idon’tlikerollercoasters” Dean mumbled.
He is pissed.
Cas was laughing.
much you can learn about this world. I just hope that I will be the one to teach it to you.”
“Everyone’s arriving now,” she pants, “you two need to be down there.”
Dean reached out to grab his hand, gently leading him into the room and closing the door behind him. Once they were alone, Dean turned to look at him.
He feels the amulet, laying warm against this chest.
Cas melts like ice on a hot day.
Her face softened.
“Well, they sure as hell aren’t normal. But c’mon, use them. We don’t have time to waste.”
Dean nods and quickly makes his escape.
He wonders why he didn’t see it earlier, as now he can see it clear as day. It’s a large grey building, several stories high, void of windows. Red lights flash all around it, warning everyone of danger. From where he is, he can’t see much of it, just the basics but it is already enough to make him want to turn back. Compared to the warmth of the houses in Vale Village, the building above is cold and uninviting. He believes that it is meant to be that way, to terrify anyone from stepping foot inside of it.
Their letters presented more ominous signs of The Empty’s return. There was a rise in monster activity, more camps being found all over the regions. Animals were becoming more weary at night, the cattle and sheep constantly startled and unsteady. Some native trees and plants were beginning to die, as if someone had deprived them of all light and nutrients. The more Castiel heard, the more he could not shake the heavy feeling that soon, a battle would begin.
Castiel huffed.
presents.”
He makes it through the main gate of the castle and swerves left. He runs along the edge of the outer wall, remaining mostly inconspicuous as he does so. However, he comes across another Nephilim shortly after, which fortunately, is already missing its legs due to decay.
There were at least 20 frames on the wall, filled with different pieces of art from Cas’ childhood. Some drawings appeared to be from when he was young and his technique was merely only at its beginning, whereas others were from his later years. Claire could see the progression, from the pictures that Cas had drawn at the ages of six and seven, to the ones he drew in his mid to late teens. There were many of Dean that caught her eye, ones that seemed to pair with the stories. However, it was only one of them that stood out.
A familiar blue.
He turns around to see a man behind him, staring at him with crazed eyes. The man is tall, with sickly pale skin and a stare that screams
Castiel huffed, even though he knew it to be true.
“You’re right.” He directed at Sam. “This place is magical.”
“Now, I hope you enjoy your night’s stay in the village. However, I must travel back to the fortress to oversee the mechanisms. I do hope to hear that the other champions have been doing their part, as well.”
Castiel nodded and quietly, both himself and Dean stood up from the bench. As they went to follow Hester, Castiel forced a small smile to Hannah, who looked disappointed with her sister’s words. Instantly, she smiled back, a small burst of light returning to her eyes. The small gesture had obviously meant something to her.
Castiel did not know what his father meant, so instead he looked back at Sir John and his son. The knight seemed to be explaining something, pointing out towards the garden while continuously looking at Dean to make sure he understood. Dean nodded, seemingly latching onto every word his father spoke.
“Don’t worry Your Highness, I know you haven’t visited for me,” she said, giving a pointed look over in Dean’s direction, “but nevertheless, I am happy that you’re here.”
, the powerful sword, as the hero knight to wield it. Well, it jilted Hester to her core.
shirt and dark blue eyeliner. Dean raised an eyebrow at her when she made eye contact with him upon entering. She frowned at him before marching up to the counter and immediately beginning to sign.
“Baby…” Dean says, letting the name linger on his tongue. He determines that he likes it. “She looks like Impala, my old horse.”
Dean followed his mom’s gaze and it turned out the
“I’ve had this feeling since I awoke,” Dean states, “and I can’t quite place what it is.”
Cas looked shocked.
“You remind me of him, you know? Dean. I can see why you get along.”
He grabs Cas by the tie to pull them back together and this time, Cas hooks his his hands under Dean’s thighs and lifts Dean
“Dean…” Duma began with a sigh, “Castiel isn’t here.”
They shake one more time before letting go, hands returning to their sides. Garth decides to keep the conversation going.
“Cas… are you serious?”
He sighed.
Dean rolls his eyes. “No you weren’t. I bet when you hadn’t heard from me you contacted Sam and
“Can I just clarify something?” she asks, as if she hasn’t just bombarded him with 30 minutes worth of follow up questions.
“Party was lame.” Dean said with a shrug. “Thought we’d have a lot more fun hanging here with Sammy.”
Dean asked.
The Winchester, who had been quiet up until this point, let out a breath and blinked.
That night, Charlie and Dean attempt to get some sleep before the next day.
The woman laughs. “No… no you do not. At least… you cannot remember right now. However, you did know me once upon a time, a very long time ago. And the Dean I knew then… well, he definitely was much quieter than you are now.”
Dean tried to regain control of his body, having gone lax from the moment he laid eyes on Cas. He took a breath, wriggled his fingers and opened his mouth to speak—to recite Cas’ name. However, he was quick to remember that Cas wouldn’t hear him and that he only spoke before purely for Dean’s benefit.
grade and the fact Cas had now decided to turn his back on them? Dean felt betrayed.
glint in Dean’s eye.
Hell desert is usually easy to access, according to Charlie, if you follow the route that goes down past the castle. But because they are avoiding the castle, it is much safer to take the long way around.
Claire took a breath to steady herself, the nerves in her stomach causing her heart to beat a mile a minute. She walked over to the whiteboard by the front door, the one she used to communicate. While Jody was making a persistent effort to learn ASL and could even hold small conversations, the conversations they were about to have was nowhere near her fluency.
Dean fondly watches as his husband drew another shape in the sky—which Dean knows is Andromeda’s constellation. Again, he is unable to place it in the thousands of stars.
The sound of someone shouting caused both Dean and Cas to turn around in a flash. The both of them instantly spotted Kevin, who was leaning against one of the benches in the science lab. He looked the same as he always did--pale and thin with his dark black hair peeking out from under a blue beanie. His smile was the same as always though, just like it had been when he was alive.
Three days.
“Oh… you don’t know their name. Could you describe them to me?”
In fact, Dean didn’t know anyone who was LGBT until he went to college. In high school, you wouldn’t second guess a male or female being straight. It was just… how life
“The castle researchers are doing an excellent job of programming them,” Castiel said, “I have no doubt that eventually we will be able to use them as an advantage in the fight against The Empty,”
Tears began to well up in his eyes as for a moment he gave in to the fear and panic. He gripped Dean tightly, pulling the man to his chest, begging him to stay alive.
He remembered nothing of his past, at least discernable enough that he could find his way around. He could barely even remember his journey the day before, what path he took and in what direction. He was bound to get lost on his way around the island, which would not only lead to dangerous situations, but would waste time. Time that was needed in order for him to save the prince and save the island that he once called his home.
“Dean. Explain.”
“For my entire duration, being trapped here, I made it my mission to wait. Wait for you to arrive here and to tell you what happened all those years ago.”
Some of their guests arrived promptly at 6pm, while others were set to arrive later, closer to midnight.
He paused, looking back at the kitchen, remembering the amount of work he still had to do. However, there was the issue of Claire, who he couldn’t just abandon for his work. So after a few moments of deliberating, Dean sighed.
As if reading Claire’s mind, Mary smiled brightly at her.
As they got to top, Dean clenched his eyes shut as his heart began to accelerate in his chest. However before the cart moved any further, Dean felt a pressure on his hand. He opened his eyes and could see in the darkness of the ride that Cas was holding his hand for support. Dean blushed but wasn’t able to really think about the embarrassment that he felt as the ride picked up the pace again. And before they knew it, they were off.
“Nothing is wrong,” Castiel whispered, “I… I really should not have come here. It was childish of me. Go back to sleep and I will go back to my quarters.”
“I’ll watch from below with Charlie, so I will see when you return.” She says.
Dean watched his mom continue to bake until she had constructed the pie and put it in the oven. After his mom washed her hands, Dean went up to her and tapped her on the hip, wanting her attention.
Before he could finish the ride began to ascend and Dean knew he was fucking screwed.
Once they arrived in Hellian, they took a moment to settle into the inn. It was much cooler in the town’s inn, due to the stone they used for the walls and floor, that naturally kept the house at a colder temperature. Both Castiel and Dean had a refreshing glass of water upon their arrival, and laid on their beds for ten minutes to cool down.
Mary smiled. “Well your brother did miss you. I made pumpkin doughnuts with a chocolate topping if you’re hungry. I’m also sure your brother will share his candy with you.”
Once she had shown them everything, they all stood in silence for a moment, watching as a flock of birds flew by the window. Then, it was Anna who was the first to speak up.
Cas looks so heartbroken that Dean has to avert his gaze downwards. He watches as Cas puts his hand into his back pocket, pulling out his wallet. At first, Dean thinks he’s going to do something insulting like give him money for the ride home. Instead, he pulls out a business card and holds it out to Dean.
Nephilims.”
did his new neighbor jump to the top of the list. Defined cheekbones, tousled hair and a five o’clock shadow, Cas had only caught a brief glimpse of him the other day and was ready to fall to his knees and swoon.
He chuckles, before relaxing his face into a more serious expression. He leans forward so that he is closer to Charlie.
He follows her down the hill and into the village. There are people bustling around him, walking in and out of the different buildings, or chatting off to the side. It’s the most people he’s seen since he awoke, considering the only other people he’s seen is the Queen and the girl, and at least the girl is an actual,
He finds a safe place for Baby, settling her there. He leans in and presses his forehead to her nose.
Claire rose her hands to sign and a spark of recognition flooded the man’s gaze.
“That is something I can’t explain to you, only he can.” Meg stated. “However, you should never,
Later that evening, Dean watched as Michael left the house. Every Friday night was the nights that Dean spent over at the Shurley’s. It was how he knew that every Friday night, Michael had to attend business dinners for his firm. He watched as Michael drove away towards the city, leaving the gateway to Cas wide open. After waiting a few minutes to make sure Michael had well and truly left—Dean prepared to strike.
“I know you don’t know me very well, but I’m your dad… well, your other dad,” he says, looking down at her as she looks around the room. “I know you haven’t seen much of me, and I’m sorry I haven’t been here. I know you may not realise it, but I really should’ve been here to help your dad, to be here for both you and him.”

period science. He also told Dean about Gordan Walker being sent to the principal’s office during their AP English. The two of them shared their lunches with one another and promised to meet after school as they parted ways to their final classes. Dean was confused as to why, all of a sudden, Cas hadn’t wanted to walk home with him.
“Yes,
“I just…” Cas sighed. “I just need some space. Some time.”
“I had a good time. It was fun and… it was good to be a teenager for once you know? But when I got home… Dad was pissed. He asked why it took me longer to get home and asked me where the left over money was. I eventually told him the truth and… he was mad. Angrier than I’d ever seen him. Angrier than when I’d fucking stole that loaf of bread.”
girlfriend. Was Cas currently cheating on her? Was this just an elaborate prank?
The first words Dean ever said to Cas.
“I- I don’t expect you to return my feelings, now or ever. But Cas… I do expect you to start treating me like a fucking adult. I’m not the four year old, or seven year old or ten year old that you once knew. I’m a professor now, I own my own home. I know my thoughts and feelings. I know
“Not a lot,” Kevin admitted. “From what I can tell, spirits have been disappearing into the veil and are being trapped in there. Cause usually, we move freely in and out of the veil as we please. However, these ghosts aren’t coming back out. They’re… they’re still here in a sense. Still around but yet just not in the same reality.”
. Upon realising Cas wasn’t there, he sulked home—upset his friend hadn’t let him know. The two of them had completely different schedules now they were in middle school, but they still shared lunch together. At lunch Cas had been fine. He spent most of the time laughing at a story Dean told him about 2
. Those were the really the only things I needed to say to Castiel when he was here.”
Then, he proceeds after her.
He’s finally home.
Dean takes the man’s hand in his, ignoring the jolt that floods through him as soon as they make contact. He’s already given up on the idea that the man in front of him is his soulmate, considering that Cas had no reaction to Dean’s words whatsoever. He supposes he’s not surprised, considering that Cas is most definitely out of his league. He’s like walking sex on legs, with a suit that looks like it cost far more than Dean’s rented one. There is no way that the universe decided to pair them as soulmates.
Claire signed for paper, trying to mouth the word the best she could.  However, it turns out she was in luck as the woman’s smile widened.
Dean plucks it from the grass without thinking, bringing it between himself and Cas. Dean watches as Cas immediately recognises the flower and the moment it clicks in his brain as to why Dean has plucked it from the ground.
“I’ve heard about you boy,” he says, “the champion who lived, the human boy who survived. You think you’re just able to come in here and take what’s mine, huh? Well, I’m not going to let you go down that easy.”
Cas shrugged.
as his choice lullaby, but he’s not one to judge. He watches from the doorway as Cas tucks Grace in before quietly leaving the room as the baby sleeps soundly.
Mary’s face immediately lit up and she eagerly invited Claire inside. It felt so surreal to Claire that she was inside the Winchester home. As she followed Mary through the house, all the stories burned in her brain like the imprint of a hot iron.
rather than the fireworks. Jack was too entranced by the sky to even notice, something Dean was glad about. Having his brother witness that moment was enough, the kid would of just been mortifying.
“Let us go, Your Majesty.” he says. “Your kingdom awaits.”
Dean had sugar cookies his whole life, it wasn’t as if they were uncommon to eat. But that particularly night, standing in the kitchen with the milk and cookies, made one particular memory form in his mind. It may have been the familiarity of the situation, or the fact that he was constantly revisiting his past with Claire—but for some reason, a memory he had long forgotten—returned.
He would never forget the look of betrayal in Dean’s eye, the sadness that laid underneath his mask of happiness. Dean had tried to be happy for him, Cas could see that. He was grateful for his friend’s attempts to support him, through helping him find an apartment, to packing up his childhood bedroom. But he knew that ultimately, Dean was clouded by sadness and was unable to understand why Cas had made this decision. Cas didn’t blame him, for it was a secret that he wouldn’t dare tell Dean.
“… Sorry Mom.”
Castiel nodded, “Please proceed.”
Her plan all started with her going to Lawrence, the town where most of Dean’s stories all came from. She knew that the possibility of Cas living there was unlikely, considering he moved away for college. However, she knew from what Dean indicated that Cas’ older brother, Michael, still lived there.
All I could feel was fear and I just needed to get away from there. Once I began to wander though, I realised something.”
The cracks begin to deepen in Dean’s resolve, so he attempts to stay silent in order to see where the conversation will lead.
Together, they made the haste journey to the dining hall. Growing up in the castle, Castiel was used to its grandeur, including how long it took to travel from room to room. Sometimes, it took several minutes to get from one place to another, due to the many convoluted paths and the building being several stories high. It had taken Dean a while to get used to living there, due to the fact that his previous homes were several times smaller. Dean explained that it used to only take him a few seconds to reach the kitchen from his bedroom, an ideal that Castiel could not fathom.
“DEAN WINCHESTER!”
“Yes, I suppose I am,” Castiel replies with a sigh, “I just cannot help but worry. With all the new travellers here on our island, I worry that this was not the right choice to make.”
Dean watched as the fireworks began to explode, shooting straight up into the night sky. Upon seeing Cas’ face, Dean realised that he'd never seen fireworks before. The way they detonated in the sky creating a colour show that most would describe as beautiful. Yet Dean wasn’t watching the firework show like everyone else. He’d seen a million fireworks, even set a few off himself. All he could focus on and he all he cared about focusing on was the way Cas’ face lit up like the current sky.
He gets into his own cab, giving them Cas’ address, which he somehow still remembers. The car ride is silent, Dean too wrapped up in his thoughts to even try and keep up a conversation. He spends the drive watching as the buildings and streets of central Lawrence disappear to the fields on the outskirts, before altogether transforming to the quaint little town of Eudora.
“You seem displeased by that,” Cas says as more of a statement than a question. Dean shrugs.
He follows the signs that point to the different offices, following the corridors down to the area for soulmate and bond history studies. From there, he reads each of the names on the doors, slowly creeping down the hall. It only takes a couple of doors for him to spot it, the familiar last name embroidered into the gold name plate that’s stuck to the door on his left.
but his roommate just stopped him with a laugh.
Amara and Inias exchange another glance.
By the time Dean had killed his tenth one, Castiel could sense that he was dying. He staggered left and right, not being able to keep his balance well. Blood dripped down his face and arms, coating his tunic in a sea of red. His friend’s face was so swollen, that Castiel could barely recognise him. Castiel knew that if Dean took one more hit, his friend would not live to see the war end.
And then, right after finishing up his leg with Coldplay in Asia…
Castiel used to love Friday nights.
He listened as the Queen walked forward and he looked up to see her expression had softened.
Charlie’s jaw drops.
Dean goes to warn her to be quiet, to approach the room carefully, but it is no use. Her outburst has already summoned the monster, who appears behind her with a malicious grin.
Swallowing down his disappointment, he nods his head to the stool next to him. “Take a seat Cas, what’s your poison?”
“What?” Dean asks.
Mary left the boys in the kitchen creating gingerbread cookies, while she took Sam out to do some Christmas shopping. Only five minutes into their baking and the house began to smell like ginger and sugar as the boys got to work rolling out the dough.
Two weeks later when Claire stopped by, Dean was waiting for her.
He did not notice he was crying until he felt a warm sensation on his cheek. He reached up to feel it, realising that it was actually hot, salty tears rolling down his face. He felt his body heaving, dry sobs just aching to be let out. He curled his hand into a fist and brought it to his mouth, biting on it to stop the cries that desperately tried to escape. All that he had been feeling and experiencing over the past few weeks finally had overwhelmed him, rattling him to his core. No matter how hard he tried to stop it, there was no ceasing the wave of emotions that had stirred alive inside of him.
He hesitates for a moment, because in a way, he is safe in this room. Safe from the unknown, safe from whatever lies ahead. If the scars on his body are anything to go by, he knows that whatever,
Dean asked while yawning, tapping the back of his wrist repeatedly.
The moment her words hit, his nerves peak to astronomical levels.
“Look, he says he wants me, but his actions say otherwise. If he really wanted me, he would’ve told me the truth from the beginning, not played out this little experiment to see if I’m really the one.”
Castiel says,
“Dean, I have told you this a plethora of times -- I love you. I will keep telling you that until the day it finally gets through your thick skull. When you love someone and are in a loving relationship with them, no matter the turmoil, you work together to make it last. You trust one another and you rely on one another. I am committed to you with every part of my body and it will take a lot more than our silly little arguments to make me stop loving you. In fact, I see it as an impossibility.”
“I’ll do my best.” Dean promises.
“Winchester is attached to the guy.” He heard Gordon Walker chuckle. “Almost as if either of them would die without the other.”
“And it was not enough.” the Queen snapped.
Cas smiled before closing his eyes again, tightening his grip around Dean’s torso. He laid his head back on the pillow, deciding that he deserved a sleep-in after their busy morning the day before.
He’d had a plan, a simple plan to help calm his nerves. He’d leave work at four thirty, drive to the university, have a five-minute breakdown before going inside to see Cas, ten minutes before his office hours closed.
However, all Claire could think about was Dean and the guilt she would feel if she walked away. She wouldn’t be able to face him again, knowing she stood two feet in front of Dean’s best friend and didn’t say a word to him. To know that there was something she could have done and she didn’t take it. She had gotten all this way, there was no turning back now.
“You have to go, Dean.” He said. “But I just want to thank you for everything. You are a good fighter and I am looking forward to watching you tear that son of a bitch apart.”
He knew that Cas wouldn’t say any of this if he knew the truth about Dean--if he knew that Dean was bisexual. Yet, he was glad to know what Cas’ beliefs and opinions were, without that interference. There was no doubt that his words hurt, considering they not only attacked Dean’s own sexuality but the fact that his feelings for Cas could never be acted upon. Not that he wanted to act upon them, considering he’d kept them quiet for the past 10 years. Yet, the little dream that it
Dean looked over at Cas bewildered and gulped, “S-Sorry? About what?”
Cas began to tell Dean, but Dean stopped him by pushing his hands down.
The thought of going in alone petrifies Dean, but he swallows his fear.
Dean forced a smile and shifted a little, acting as if the sight hadn’t fazed him. He walked over to Cas with the dessert, placing it on the table.
Eventually he is able to shove Alastair to the floor, the monster falling back with a groan, which is enough time for him to pull out his sword. The monster is barely able to let out a cry before Dean lifts it and shoves it forward so that it digs straight into the monster’s chest. A large, high-pitched scream echoes through the chamber and Dean blocks his ears for a moment to save them. Then, the monster explodes in a puff of black liquid which quickly dissipates into the floor. The room around him is mostly silent, apart from the sirens that continue to ring.
He remembers his most recent memory, before he was sent to the bath. He remembers the excruciating pain as each hit he took from a Nephilim got worse and worse, to the point where could barely see anything in front of him. He remembers a large flash of light, Castiel’s screams and his body hitting the floor. As he laid there, he’d watched Cas through a hazy gaze, his eyelids swollen from the battle. Cas was mournful, teary-eyed, uttering apologies and words of regret into Dean’s hair. However, Dean had found that he was at peace, as that there was no better place for him to be than in Cas’ arms. That there was no better place for him to die, than in Cas’ arms.
“The good parts. You remind me of the good parts of Dean. I promise, that was meant as a compliment.”
“Where are we?” She asks.
“We are actually able to control them now, the next step is being able to manipulate it at a mass level.” Castiel said, turning to look at Dean with excitement in his eyes. Dean smiled softly back, showing that he was attentively listening to whatever Castiel had to say.
Castiel bowed in respect. “It is a pleasure to meet you Mary, I have heard nothing but lovely things from Dean.”
“You better. Now, we better get going so you can close up. You ready kiddo?”
“However, it pains me that he doesn’t speak to me. It has been almost a year since I’ve heard my child talk. I used to be exhausted, when Dean would speak for hours on end, his energy and voice unwavering. And yet now… I would do anything to hear him talk to me like that again.”
Dean waited until the teenager was fully out the door before he turned his attention to Claire.
He signed.
“Yes, Papa.”
“No… that can’t be.”
Cas gulps, seeming almost frightened of what he is about to say. But he takes a deep breath and begins to loosen his tie. Dean watches, his mouth dry, as Cas rips his tie off and begins to undo the buttons on his shirt.
Dean startles and jumps up immediately, grabbing his rusty sword and aiming it in the direction of the voice. A woman stands in front of him, a fair distance away, and is staring at him with a calm but curious look. He notes several things about her from first glance. He first notices her posture, how rigid and stiff it is. He can’t think of the word to describe it, rather that he knows that how she stands means something. The second thing he notices is the way she is dressed. She wears a very nice dress, way nicer than the clothing Dean has gotten on. It extends all the way down to the floor, poofing out slightly from the waist. As he continues to look at her, he notices a third thing, which is that she is quite pale. In fact, she’s almost far too pale.
Dean exchanges a quick bewildered gaze with Charlie. He goes to speak, but the woman just laughs.
“You ready?” He asks. Dean nods.
Dean and Cas exchanged glances, the both of them knowing what Kevin’s words meant.
“Good luck tomorrow, Castiel,” Anna said as they joined together again.
Dean helped his mom bake through the morning and got the snacks and the backyard ready for the afternoon. His mother came out to put trays of treats on the backyard table, before sitting down next to him.
Eventually it’s time for the meals to be served, and considering both Castiel and Dean are the immediate family of the grooms, they are placed at the same table. As luck would have it, their name tags are positioned next to each other. However, Dean doesn’t think luck has much part in this, considering the sly looks Jess, Sam and Gabriel are giving them. Dean was also certain Adam had mentioned to him that he was sitting between Sam and Kate for the reception meal.
After freshman year and the torment of finals, Cas and Dean went back home to Kansas. While they were there, they made it their mission to rent an apartment instead of going back to the dormitories. With Dean having his job during the colleges semesters at the local café and Cas having a job at the local bookstore—the two of them had enough to rent a small crappy apartment close to UChicago. Although the place was a trash hole, it had a kitchen big enough for Dean to bake. That was something that Dean had missed living at the dormitories—
He waved to Missouri from his car as he pulled out of the driveway and sped off down the road back towards Kansas. Once they were down the street, Dean finally let all his emotions and frustrations roll out.
He growled, slamming the book shut. He shoved his head into his hands.
He walks towards the elevator, making eye contact with the receptionist Tessa along the way. She smiles at Dean and waves in greeting, despite the phone that is perched between her shoulder and ear. Dean returns the greeting with a small hand wave of his own, and continues his journey to the elevators.
Dean raised an eyebrow.
Dean leaned on his elbows, “Well,
Dean gulped under the fierce stare of Cas but nodded. He indicated to the two seats by the window, his and Claire’s usual table. They walked over and took the seats down off the table. Dean sat in his usual spot, whereas Cas sat in Claire’s.
The party, or “gathering”, was a success. While it only lasted a couple of hours, everyone seemed to have a pleasant time. Dean met Cas’ older brother and got to relive the exact same argument that Cas and Jimmy had. But in the end, Gabriel warmed up to him quick enough, albeit while still remaining slightly wary of him. He also reunited with Hannah and Chuck, who both seemed pleased to see him there. Towards the end of the party, he ended up sneaking away at one point to update both Sam and Charlie, promising pictures for Sam and promising updates for Charlie at a later date. His new friend promised to stay in Lawrence for one more night so that Dean could meet up with her the next day and provide all the details she wanted (well, at least
Dean sighs.
Cas replied honestly. Dean rolled his eyes, a small smile on his face.
there. It’s a moment that he wants to cherish for as long as possible.
He pulled the sandwich out and was about to begin eating it when he noticed something out of the corner of his eye. It was Castiel, sitting silently and
Which leads him to his third perk, the fact that he is able to walk out in public without so much as a second glance. Most people who run in the music industry and beyond know who Dean Smith is, but Dean bets they’d never be able to pick him out in a crowd. Well, maybe they’d be able to if he wore his signature stage look, an outfit that had been recently dubbed “The Dean Smith look” in various magazine articles.
Dean begins to explain the events of Saturday night, from his and Cas’ meeting, to their argument at the end of the night. He tells them about Cas omitting the truth the entire night, only admitting once Dean began to catch on. By the time he’s done, his burger is cold and his heart is heavy. He feels too emotional to eat, having to relive everything he’s felt over the past few days. Sam and Jess both seem shell-shocked, trying to process the information.
--- asks, leaning back against the counter.
“If you tell me yours, I will tell you mine.”
What he didn’t admit to anyone though, was that he had begun to religiously bake around the time that Cas got a girlfriend.
After some time, Dean came back and Castiel watched in amusement as the two of them began to bicker -- bicker in a way where Dean did not even need to say a word.
He watched as Claire scanned over the savoury foods, pointing to one in particular.
Claire wrote her plan out onto the whiteboard, in small fine writing. When she was done, she handed it over to Jody with shaky hands. The sheriff looked at her confused and leant over to grab her reading glasses. Once she put them on, her eyes were glued to the whiteboard.
, were they more impatient than the last.
“Come on.” Cas whispers. “Let’s get back to bed, it won’t be long before the kids wake.”
sometimes.”
club--the LGBT club. Dean knew that Aaron was gay, it came up in one of their first immediate conversations. Yet Dean was confused as to why he was bringing
As he nears the building, he slowly creeps up to it. He has no idea if monsters ended up settling inside, out of his view. If there are monsters there, he wouldn’t want to alert them of his presence, especially without a weapon in his hand. He crouches against the wall of the building and carefully, with his heart beating loudly in his ears, he peeks in.
Dean instantly knows that it’s Cas, and he feels his breath hitch. He listens to the sound of rustling, more clattering, and the soft, padding sound of footsteps on the wood. Then, suddenly-and-not-suddenly, the door opens.
Dean could tell that story was still a sore point for Cas.
“Do you think this is a good idea?” Cas asked.
Cas just grinned, staring at Dean intensely.
“It is good to see you, Dean.” She says. “I always knew you’d make it here in the end.”
that they’re soulmates, and he didn’t say one word.
Mary gave three slow nods, starting at Castiel with a look in her eye that he could not place. However, before he could question her on it, she changed the subject.
“We have a big journey ahead of us,” Castiel stated, changing the subject. He gave Dean a small smile, indicating his head over to the inn. “Let us go have supper. I distinctly remember you saying that your village has the best vegetable soup there is.”
“You bet.”
“No, it doesn’t, but it definitely does help ease the sting. My parents died in a car accident, just short of four years ago. They were travelling to celebrate the anniversary of their meeting, when my father lost control of their vehicle. Nobody knows why or how it happened, but by the time emergency services were found, my parents had already moved on.”
“Uh, I’m Dean,” he says, holding out his hand. They quickly shake hands before Jimmy turns his full attention to his niece.
He looked as the
“I’ll drive you,” Dean says, “plus, we can hang out tomorrow night, or another time. No need to rush Cas, we’ve only got forever.”
Dean winks. “You know I can’t promise that.”
Another deep breath.
Dean and Cas stuck by each other’s sides, mingling with their classmates and enjoying the party’s festivities. Dean and Cas spent most of their time talking with Benny, who was also invited to the party, but other times found themselves talking with the other 8
He grabs one of the baby monitors from the dresser on his way out, before indicating his head down the hall. Dean realises he is gesturing for him to follow.
He attempted to get more work done, but his view was obscured by a foil wrapped item held out in front of him. It was some sort of food, judging by the mouthwatering scent. Dean attempted to ignore it, but Cas was persistent, shoving the item at him until Dean accepted it.
“She’ll be fine.” She says. “Take her to the infirmary at Hellian, they’ll help her recover.”
He forces himself to turn his attention back to Cas, who is still standing there dumbfounded. Dean feels a shaky smile form on his face, his lips wobbling as all the emotions he’s feeling suddenly bubble to the surface.
Dean raises an eyebrow at her, but she ignores it.
as apparently, the newest season had come out.
Cas rolled his eyes and huffed a small laugh.
“Kevin?” Dean said, going to move his hands away. Missouri clutched them tightly.
Dean stood still and rolled his eyes, showing that he was listening.
“Your Highness.” Were the first words she spoke, bowing her head in respect. She then turned to Dean, a smile forming on her lips, her brown eyes twinkling in the dim light.
Eventually, he turned away and ambled back over to where the two of them were standing. Benny was telling Dean a story about an incident at the mines and while Dean clearly looked intrigued by the story, he did not utter a word in reply. If Castiel was being honest, he knew Benny should be grateful for that. When he told Dean stories, the knight was notorious for continuously interrupting with a multitude of questions and comments.
much more than that,” he murmurs, before he captures Dean’s lips with his own.
“Excellent!” Benny exclaimed. “I have had a hard enough time working out the programming and controls for the fortress, I couldn’t imagine the job your researchers have with that machinery. It looked so… complex.”
After helping her clean up, Dean gave her a hug goodbye. With another long drive ahead of them, Dean wanted to leave sooner rather than later.
His trail of thoughts are interrupted by strong arms wrapping around his waist.
Midway through their pizzas was when the last few guests began to trickle in, two of them being Dean’s brother, Sam and his girlfriend, Jess. They had spent the earlier portion of their evening at Sam’s high school friend’s party. Immediately upon seeing his brother, Dean was up out of his seat and bringing the other man into a crushing hug. Sam, who was at least a foot taller than Dean, laughed and gripped on tightly.
Cas smiled back.
Feeling slightly angry and disheartened, Cas turned around and headed back home, placing his neighbour’s mail in his mailbox as one last good deed.
ones you need to read, so that I can finally get them out of my office,” Pamela says.
Cas opened his mouth, most likely to refuse but Dean shook his head.
As Dean finished his story, he noticed the line that is starting to get longer behind Claire. The next flood of customers was starting to arrive and
over and over again.
“I’m the college professor stereotype. I spend most of my days buried in books, at my house, with my cat by my side. I didn’t always have a cat, when I first started as a professor it was just copious amounts of literature I owned. However, I felt that if I were living up to one part of the stereotype, I might as well just go the full way.”
He walked up to the door and knocked. It didn’t take long for the door to open and for Dean to come face to face with Michael’s fiancée Duma. Dean liked Duma,
“I’ve had this feeling this entire time Cas and I never could place it,” Dean says, “this whole time, I thought it was something to do with my memories, like maybe I was mourning them? I couldn’t tell, until now. Right now, that feeling is overwhelming. But it isn’t bad, it’s isn’t dread or sorrow. It’s love, Cas. Gosh, I longed for you so bad that I literally ached. The grief was the fact that I knew all my memories of you were missing and yet, my heart remembers every bit of you. And now, I remember everything. I remember the way you laugh at my horrendous jokes or how bright your eyes get when you talk about your research. I remember your courage and determination, your sadness and grief. I remember it all Cas and I am so in love with you that it physically hurts, this love I can’t --”
“That’s because I
He and Charlie talk minimally on the trip, considering it is only a couple hours long. Charlie talks about her love of horses and research, along with adventuring and exploring. While Dean can’t pinpoint it, it seems so familiar that he finds himself warming up to Charlie considerably. While he didn’t think unkindly of her, they don’t know each other well. However, the little tidbits she shares to pass the time on their trip makes her much less of a stranger and he feels a blossoming camaraderie between them.
“I’ll come back for you, I promise,” he whispers, thinking of Impala who he was never able to return to.
This is definitely something he could get used to.
Cas’ shoulder fit tightly into the palm of his hand. Cas’
Or I guess arguments… whatever you want to call them. What you have with Cas? It’s nothing like that.”
“Okay.”
However, he wasn’t
Their connection is severed.
“I’m sorry I forgot,” Dean replies through a shaky breath.
Castiel forced a small smile, not wanting to mention the fact that his father was able to access his magic the day he turned eighteen. Instead, he tried to focus on the optimism of Dean’s words and desperately changed the subject.
“Good luck, Dean.”
His mom explained that the man was deaf, meaning he could not hear. She said most of the Deaf community have their own language called, ‘Sign Language’ where they communicate through their hands since they cannot hear speech. She told Dean how there were different types of sign language for different countries and the sign language Missouri and the man were communicating in was known as ‘American Sign Language or ASL’. Dean didn’t have much else to discuss on the topic, but had been really amazed by the newly discovered language. I mean, how
“Are you okay?” She asks.
Dean wondered if they were celebrating Cas’ college applications while they were there too.
“Grace Island has faced this evil before and the story is always the same,” Missouri continues, “the only ones to destroy this entity is a heroic knight, chosen by the sword of light and the prince, with the abilities of the angels.”
When Dean did not say anything in response, Castiel took that as his opportunity to begin his descent towards the horses. However, he was only able to take a couple of steps before something stopped him. He did not have time to even blink before two hands had spun him around, forcing him to meet Dean’s gaze. His friend’s piercing green eyes stared straight at him with tinges of concern and sadness around their edges. The look he gave seemed to ask him,
He shakes his head.
A yawn crept its way to his lips and his eyes began to water from exhaustion. It had been a long work week and the night had proved to be far more tiring, as he had attempted to work instead of enduring his feelings of self-loathing and isolation. He knew that it was unlikely that Dean or Charlie would contact him that night, and he was better off sleeping and awaiting their call tomorrow.
“Our beloved Kevin Tran, we bring you gifts from life into death.” Missouri repeated. “Commune with us, Kevin Tran, and move among us.”
She walks forward so that she is just a step in front of him and places her hand to his forehead. Suddenly, the pain Dean had felt from the fight disappears and his body feels brand new again, as if he has had the best sleep of his life. Well, the best sleep without a loss of memories.
Castiel opened his mouth to reply to Dean, but was interrupted.
They did not speak for most of the morning, not even when they stopped for lunch at Stull Lake, home of Grace Island’s fishermen. Stull Lake resided between both the Hell region and the Grasslands region, and produced most of the fish and seafood that was sold and eaten by the Grace Island citizens. Castiel ended up talking to most of the fishermen about some additional money for their boats, while eating a delicious salmon broth.
Again, as if Missouri knew, she smiled sympathetically.
Castiel’s eyes widened, “Of course I do! Dean, you are my closest companion. I cherish the time we spend together.”
occurred, some people from our town found two saddled horses on the outskirts. They were both your’s and the prince’s. We kept both of them here for a while and they both ended up breeding with other horses. While the prince’s horse and his foul ended up going to a family in the Grasslands town, your horse and his descendants stayed here the entire time. I heard your parents looked after them for a while, until they… um…”
“Yeah well… a little while after that… Dad let me go out on a case by myself. It was near Orlando, about an hour’s drive. He let me borrow the Impala and everything. The case went well and I killed whatever monster it was. I can’t remember anymore. Anyways I… I went to meet Dad back in a motel in Athens, Georgia when I decided… fuck it, I’m doing it. So I booked it to Orlando instead. To here.”
With one quick pull, he managed to yank his wallet free from his pocket, grabbing out both the rewards card and the credit card. Cas stood off to the side and waited as Dean paid, watching as the poor boy, who couldn’t have been older than twenty, apologised to Dean as overtly as possible. Dean just smiled, waving his hand as if to say: ‘it’s fine’.
“I think we’re almost there.” Charlie says after sometime.
The Empty is diminished in an explosion, sending Dean flying backwards towards the surrounding fields.
“Good morning Cas,” Dean’s voice said from above him, “Sorry for waking you so early.”
Before Cas can say anything further, Dean looks at them.
“Michael said Castiel should be…”
However, Dean was not just Castiel’s knight, but rather his closest friend.
Yet here he was right in front of him.
“Ah, so you got a family waiting home for you? Wife? Kids?”
“You’re a natural, Red.” He says, using the name he’s been beginning to call Charlie.
And he’s going to give that asshole a piece of his mind.
“Come over here Dean! Sit next to me!”
Sometimes—the nightmares became too much for Dean.
Although she was obviously not satisfied with that answer, Claire nodded and said her goodbyes. Jody did too and Dean watched as the two woman left his store, leaving it feeling emptier than before. With a sigh, Dean began to clean up—wiping down tables and stacking chairs.

Jack walked further into the room, looking over at Cas with a strange expression on his face. He looked perplexed and he stared Cas up and down, attempting to process.
She drove home, getting back at to the house at just past eight. As she walked in, she spotted Jody in the living room—watching some lousy reality TV show and eating leftover pizza.
“Whenever I was troubled, Mom used to always make me this drink.” Dean explained. “It was how I could think and work through my problems. Whether they were big or small.”
He eventually hissed, causing an alarmed look from a passing bystander. Dean just flashed them a sheepish smile as they scurried on.
It was safer if he took a page out of Dean’s book and just did not speak.
The worst part of it all though? He rarely saw Cas.
they don’t close for another minute. But he knows it won’t win him any favours and he has the feeling that he shouldn’t get on the bad side of this woman.
“You don’t,” Charlie reassures, “I… I can’t imagine what it is like missing all your memories, not remembering who you are.”
“All the time,” she says with a sigh. She stands up and passes Grace to Dean, while giving him a wink.
. The two of them together had watched many different shows, from Stranger Things to fucking
“What?” Dean replies, confused.
The camps are everywhere -- every few minutes they come across one. While Dean does most of the fighting, Elizabeth and Charlie join in too. Dean watches Charlie decapitate her first vampire and the look of pure joy that lights up her face.
Gilda leaves them as Charlie and Dean begin to travel back to Hannah, to explain the events of the past two hours. He tells it to Charlie as he walks, explaining his memory of Hester and the woman he met there today.
Ever since his trip to Mount Lebanon the previous week, Castiel had been trapped in feelings of despair and anger. He had spent each and everyday on his training, trying to work his mind and soul in order to unlock the powers he held within. Yet, no matter how much he tried, nothing seemed to work. No matter how many times he poured over the books, or chanted, or was distracted by Dean -- nothing seemed to help him escape the knowledge that he was a complete and utter failure.
Benny was a very kind man, despite the fact that his outward demeanor appeared unfriendly. Having lived on the mountain almost his entire life, Benny seemed at home there. The heat of the sun did not seem to bother the man, instead, he seemed rather indifferent.
He stares with amusement as Cas’ eyes darken.
“Hi!” She greets, a little too cheerfully.
And with one last wave, she turned her back and left the townhouse behind.
If you were to ask Dean, the next three days were the best few days of his life thus far.
“Thank you.” He replied, dropping his hand from the amulet. “Now that I am here, what would you like to talk to me about?”
“The nurses are going to bring you something to help with that soon.”
“Come in?”
something deep inside of him shouts,
“Very well. I suppose no harm can come from you going into the fortress. Well. no harm to anyone but you. I give you my permission to access the facility.”
He asked.
That was always something that Castiel found challenging. In fact, if it weren’t for his middle school biology class, Castiel wondered if he ever would’ve made a friend at all.
“That’s… interesting.”
Dean just smiles and leans over to grab Cas’ hand, tugging him along as they begin their journey home.
“You see, I am not like the others. My father, he created me first and I am the strongest of them all.” He seethes. “I don’t play their petty games, I don’t do their taunting. I just kill. It was why I was sent here, to this particular one because that girl. Mmm… did she put up a
“Dean. I am
Cas paused his typing to look over at the photo of Dean, Charlie and himself that sat at his desk. It was taken at their high school graduation, when all of them were in a moment of euphoria over completing their secondary education. Dean was front and center in the picture, one arm slung around each of his friends. His smile was dazzling, bright and infectious. Whenever he flashed Cas a grin, Cas couldn’t help but smile as well.
Cas nodded.
Cas spent the next twenty minutes getting interrogated by Sam, who he found was both very curious and very enthusiastic. Dean had mentioned to him months ago that Sam loved museums and studying topics such as language, culture and history. With Cas’ dad being a professor of American History, he had access to special tickets and memberships to the Field Museum in Chicago. A fact that he knew would excite Sam.
Dean exchanged a quick look with Cas, before panning his eyes around the room.
“Everything will be okay, Cas,” he said.
there, but I’ve moved on.”
He asked, holding up the Chinese food.
While he read the book, Dean took small bites of the custard pie, which sat on a plate beside him. He read as he ate, causing crumbs to fall over the pages of the borrowed book.
The conversation lulls into a comfortable silence for a moment as the music slowly comes to an end. Everyone claps as Adam and Michael tumble off the dance floor, hand in hand, heading towards the bar. As the next song begins to play, Dean turns back to look at Cas.
“I can’t help my curiosity, considering I am yet to turn twentyfcive,” Hannah, Hester’s sister, responded. She looked similar to Hester, with the same blue eyes, skin and clothing. However, Hannah’s hair was a rich brown, making her bright blue eyes much more noticeable.
It was then he decided he was going to be friends with the boy across the road. No matter what.
cause now we’re going to have to make up for lost time. We could’ve had years if either of us had the guts to say anything. So for today, let’s just spend it alone, and we can do a proper celebration once you’re officially back. It’s going to take a while for us to make up for the years we lost.”
The parents came over shortly after to say goodbye. Dean got a big smooch on the cheek from his mother and promised her he would have a good day. Soon after she left, followed by Michael. Dean took one more glimpse at the boy behind him, to see him looking sadly over at the door. Dean may have not known the boy very well… or
“We appreciate that sincerely…
“Like Missouri said, it’s going to take time.” Charlie replies. “You know… with your limited memories… something has always bothered me.”
“Perseus’ constellation is hard to find.” Cas tells Dean. “I rarely see it, unless it’s winter.”
There is totally a The Song of Achilles reference in here and I don't even care.
know who he is and just don’t care. He’s aware only a select handful of people know his real name. His team tells him it’s to avoid the risk of it getting into the public. Dean can’t imagine what kind of life he’d live if everyone knew who he truly was. No more walks to the coffee shop, or trips to the local grocers. No more family dinners in Sioux Falls or walks on the beach. No more freedom.
It takes him three deep breaths to steady himself, before he shakily knocks on the door. He hears a clatter inside and a deep voice calling out,
that he desperately wants to let slip. While he’s grateful for Pam and Lazarus Records for taking a chance on him and giving him the success he has today, he isn’t particularly fond of its founders: Alistair Smith and Zachariah Adler. He feels that between the two of them, the artists under their label aren’t seen as people but rather collectables. They’re pretty pieces for the men’s shelves — there to make them look good and bring in the dough. If it wasn’t for the loyalty Dean has to Pam, he knows he would’ve left this place long ago.
Dean sighs. “Well, I ended up in some town called Eudora, in Kansas. And there I met him. Castiel. Cas.”
Jody sighed looking back over at the whiteboard, a concerned look on her face.
“It’s on the house. Summer special.”
become a possibility that sat at the back of his mind, crumbled like a ball of discarded paper.
“Hi…” He began to drawl, watching as Cas walked over and looked at his ID badge.
“I was talking to Charlie earlier this week and… I guess I’m just… I’ve just been waiting for the other shoe to drop, y’know? I was worried we’d get into some blowout fight and you’d want me gone. Charlie didn’t think that’d happen, but I wasn’t so sure. She was obviously right… although, I’m sure you’re pretty pissed right now.”
Dean had forgotten what it was like to process input like a normal human being. How did he breathe? How did his heart beat? How did he even
They had made their relationship official in late September, several weeks after they first met. It took a couple of dates, lots of conversations and several clumsy kisses on the front porch for them to put a label on what they were. It came as no surprise to their group of friends, who had seen them practically attached at the hip for those few weeks. From the moment he’d met Dean, Cas had immediately noticed the chemistry between them. They were drawn to each other like magnets, continuously seeking the other’s presence.
“Don’t worry about it.”
“Let me guess… earache?” Dean asked, raising an eyebrow. “You and I both know if Cas had an earache, I’d been in there with him. There is something you and Michael are hiding.”
He sighs, soft tears pricking behind his eyes. Grace watches his every move.
Dean nodded, but before his mom could leave with the plate, Dean stopped her. He brought his fingers to his chin before extending his arm down, in the direction of his mother.
Charlie and Dean exchange a look.
He can barely see Charlie, but he notices the look of concentration on her face. He silences quickly, giving her the quiet she needs to think. He watches as she closes her eyes and leans her head back, taking in a deep breath. As she exhales, she opens her eyes and smiles.
But he looked over at Dean, who was looking over at him with both surprise and uncertainty, he knew that it was not his call to be made. He would be safe in the inn, there was no need for a personal guard. He knew that Dean stayed here out of a sense of obligation, but Castiel had not ordered him to.
The wind continued to create a tornado effect in the room and the temperature continued to drop. The sound of banging echoed from around the house as windows and doors began to open and close. The lights continued to flicker.
She grabs a large plastic bag out of the box and places it in front of Dean.
He began reading it, kicking off his shoes so he could rest his sock covered feet on top of his bed. For ten minutes he became absorbed in his book. He was nearing the end of the chapter and was so
Dean thinks as he watches the pathetic goo lie on the floor. He’s reminded of what Meg said about egos and how The Empty’s ego finally led to its demise.
(Dean was not willing to admit he had a hard time fingerspelling that word).
He has to see Cas today. He needs to resolve this
As he exited the street, he waited until Dean was no longer in the rearview mirror, before he let himself cry.
“Sorry Dean, it was what you’d call… a bad connection.”
so beautiful, to the point that I can’t even describe it. In my dream, she told me what my destiny is. That my destiny is to be a hero and to help a knight in need. When I woke up, I… I just thought it was all a dream, you know? Until I met you, a knight, who was about to travel alone on a dangerous adventure and I just… I had to jump at the opportunity to come along.”

considered Castiel his friend. While Castiel considered Dean his favourite person, he knew that those feelings were not reciprocated. Dean had his parents, he had the citizens of Vale Village, he had
Dean looks over at the man, no,
Dean then stumbled back as Cas barrelled into him, enclosing him in a tight hug. Dean grinned and hugged back, having missed his best friend over the past two weeks of not seeing each other. Cas pulled away after a few seconds and pointed to the container sitting on the step behind Dean.
”. It felt homely and welcoming, exactly what Cas wanted his neighbour to be. It gave him a bounce in his step as he headed up the two front steps and straight for the front door to knock. However, he noticed straight away that there was a doorbell, with a mini sign that said: “Please ring! :)”. So Castiel did as he was told and rang the doorbell a couple of times for good measure. No sound came from inside the house, not even from the doorbell. He pressed it one more time, scrutinizing it carefully as he did and concluded that the darn thing was broken. So he proceeded to knock, which led nowhere, so he came to the logical verdict that his new neighbour was not home.
As they neared the front, it was Cas that spoke first.
The next day as soon as Dean had gotten up, he had wandered across the road to Cas’ to see if he wanted to hang out. He had noticed something was wrong the minute Michael answered the door. The older man seemed cross with Dean, a scowl on his face as soon as the younger boy had greeted him. However, he reluctantly let Dean in and told him Cas was in his room.
He played it cool though, forcing a smile at his friend.
When Castiel moved away, he hadn’t even realised how much their tradition would change. Their Friday nights together were no longer held at Cas’ house and Cas was no longer there and instead over five hundred miles away in Colorado. While they still kept up the tradition, it was never
Fortunately, no one gives him a second glance and he realises that with how long it has been, anyone who probably remembered him has most likely died.
Cas’ lips quirked up slightly.
Dean seemed happy with that answer, shooting him a grin before continuing their journey to lunch. The meal was a simple affair, with both Castiel and Dean being the only ones in attendance. Quietly, they discussed their plans for the week, beginning with their journey the next day to the snowy region of Grace Island. Once their plates were cleared, Castiel retired to his study to tinker with his artefacts for a few hours, with Dean sitting just outside, on guard. When day turned to night, he said goodnight to Dean after dinner, heading upstairs to sleep before their early morning.
Dean sighs.
“True.”
“Sorry, man. I didn’t want to interrupt your sleep or anything,” He says, raising his arms in defence. “I swear, but you looked like you were having a nightmare.”
Dean grinned.
“Ever since I died here, Allistair has had me trapped for a century. I always wondered if I was ever going to be rescued, or if my spirit was resigned to spend the rest of eternity here. But thanks to you, my soul is now free.”
“Well, well, well, Dean Winchester. This is truly surprising.” The woman says with a grin. However, instead of it being comforting, Dean just feels exposed. Next to him, Charlie bows again.
he can’t talk to anyone
Cas let out a small snort before continuing onto a different shelf.
He offered up the cookie and Castiel looked at it warily. After sometime, he began to gesture to it and move his arms around frantically. Dean noticed that the boy wasn’t signing but was rather trying to communicate something else entirely to Dean. Dean was confused and stared back at the boy with a frown. He couldn’t understand what he was trying to say to him. It wasn’t until Castiel did it a few more times that Dean finally realised and his eyes widened with understanding. Castiel was asking what was in it.
Claire helped clean up the dishes, much to Mary’s reluctance. Claire insisted that if they were letting her stay the night, the least she could do was help clean up after a meal. After the dishes were done, Claire excused herself for the night to go up to the bedroom to sleep.
He saw Claire take a sip and saw how the tension in her shoulders began to decrease. After she took a few more sips, Dean decided to speak up again.
The drive to Boston took just over a day. Claire drove for most of the Saturday, stopping at a motel in Ohio for the evening. After a good night’s sleep, she continued on and felt relieved when she saw the sign welcoming her to Boston. With the address plugged into her GPS, Claire drove through the Boston city—almost dying from reckless drivers once or twice—until she found herself in a quieter part of the town, where many residential buildings were. When the GPS announced that she had arrived, she looked to see that she was out the front of a small townhouse. It was a rustic looking building—made out of concrete bricks and two paned windows. It had a large wooden door at the top of the four large steps to the entrance. From where she was parked, she could see the doorbell with a large sign pointing to it saying:
Dean almost gasps as he holds it, feeling the energy of the sword tingle all over him. He looks over at Charlie who is grinning brightly and then over to Bobby, who continues to have the small, warm smile on his face.
“If you want to do this, if you
And stare.
“Yes?” Michael asked, probably not understanding why the strange girl in front of him was still silent.
He sighed.
Sam decided the only time he was free to facetime his older brother was on a Wednesday afternoon in October.
As he drove away, he couldn’t help but attempt to leave the guilt-ridden memory behind him.
His current Friday night centered around him being sat in front of his computer, a cold, half-eaten bowl of ramen beside him. It’s how he spent most of his Friday nights recently, alone in his apartment, checking emails. Despite having lived in Denver for almost a full-year, he had never really made any friends. Sure, he had co-workers who he had friendly chats to once in a while or the occasional warm greeting to a neighbour, but
than I do, that patience is the strongest virtue. That magic is powerful stuff, it’s going to take some time to grab hold.”
Cas nodded in agreement.
him, okay? So…”
“Father!” Dean replied, sounding both grateful to see him, while also anxious.
Castiel blinked for a moment, before nodding his head in agreement. For the words he hoped to say to Dean, all the promises and regrets, should only be heard from his own lips. He hoped that the time would come, when Den would be able to listen.
“I am sorry, I could not hear you. What was that?” Castiel asked, turning to face his companion.
He took a few deep breaths once he made it to the door, calming himself down before he gave three swift knocks. Once he knocked, he brought his hand to his chest, holding both his hands there tight to his body, as a way to calm him from the abundance of nerves he felt.
“To think that about a year ago, I was sitting at that bar alone,” Dean whispers to Cas. It feels awkward dancing in front of their family and friends, when each and every one of them has their eyes trained on the two of them. However, he makes an effort to just stare straight at Cas, trying to block out the weight of all the gazes on him.

Castiel furrowed his eyebrows, confused, “what about the prophecy? I thought you told my mother all that we needed to know.”
He let’s them in, letting them get settled in the living room before he showers and changes. As soon as he’s in more comfortable clothes, he begins the process of making dinner for them. Sam and Jess try to protest, saying that they can just order take-out after Dean has had to cook all day. But considering this is his brother and sister-in-law’s last night in town, there is no way Dean is going to turn down the opportunity to make them his specialty burgers.
He didn’t know what he expected to see when he walked in; maybe candlelit tables with couples making heart eyes at each other or  hostess giving him a judging glance because he was there alone or even
“Dean Winchester, you know to wait for me when we cross the road. Never,

“Pretty cliché but we’re making gingerbread cookies. The masses seem to love them; everyone is always ordering some sort of batch. So I figured to help save me time, you could help me.”
Charlie giggles. Dean swears he can hear Castiel laughing from there.
“Hey…” Dean laughed, “no one can resist a good chocolate brownie.”
On their usual Wednesday afternoon, Claire sauntered up to the counter, pointing at one of Dean’s savoury items.
“But he can.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The tension in the air thickened.
Charlie sighs, “I… I like girls.”
Dean swallows, deciding to go with the truth.
“Yeah, I love you too.”
He’s never been the studious type, he’s always found that he is particularly too restless to sit down and read for long periods of time. He’s a hands-on learner, always has been. It’s how he learnt his way around cars and what made them work. It’s how he learnt to bake, just from experimenting in the kitchen. He never learnt by listening to lectures or reading
He extends his free index finger to the sky.
He wasn’t allowed to go out and socialise. Instead, he spent most of his time with either his team, or the band he happened to be touring for (there were always exceptions to the rule). No photos were shared, no details about his life of any kind. Yet despite their efforts, some of Dean’s personal information was still found by former-special-ops Cole Trenton, and used as a bargaining chip. It had been a rough two weeks, and Dean had felt as if he’d hit rock bottom. While it worked out in the end, with Trenton imprisoned and security increased, Dean can understand the precautions Pamela and his team are still now taking.
with him and then expected Cas to be fine with it. He may be tired, but the minimal night’s sleep did make him realise that he was a fucking moron.
Claire’s wince changed into a grimace.
“I thought… well rather hoped at the time that one day… one day our story would be written in the stars. It was this split second idea that disappeared as quick as it came. But… it was then that I realised that you were my one. It scared me at first… obviously I was
He looks in the direction that Charlie left in and sighs.
“Who?”
He steps out into another hall, however this one is more of a hole than a corridor. Bright light lies ahead, so bright that Dean needs a moment for his eyes to adjust. He blinks a couple of times, before heading towards the shining light, towards the large gusts of wind and the rays of warmth that shine through. He keeps walking forward until his shoes make contact with grass and he feels the breeze on his cheek. The sun shines down from above, making almost everything around him sparkle and glimmer. For a moment, he can do nothing but take in his surroundings and admire the beauty of the outside world.
Cas hums as he looks out at the mass of people. Dean sneaks a glance and realizes that Cas is frowning, almost as if he’s in deep contemplation.
to try and help that nightmare of a building. With all the champions dead, I believed it to be a lost cause.”
They’re both silent for a moment, until the stranger decides to speak up again.
His friends missed him, they missed the nights they used to have.
mean? However, the adrenaline in his veins was far more superior to Dean’s rational thought and his fight or flight mode began to ping. His biology gave him no choice, either to argue the situation or to run away from it.
expected little Dean Winchester from Sioux Falls to become Dean Smith, a Grammy nominated Best New Artist, currently finishing up his tour after two successful albums. It was a life that a kid can only dream of, that Dean once only ever imagined. It’s hard to believe he was now living it.
Together, they prepared a small range of finger food for the party, ready to go for when guests arrived. After they finished that, all that was left to do were the decorations, which took the two of them a grand total of ten minutes. They then stepped into the entry of the hall, surveying their work with pride.
“No you fucking
Cas’ eyes are watery. He blinks a few times before shaking his head.
One year of living in his new home passed-by quicker than Cas expected it to and suddenly, it was his one year anniversary of moving in. He spent the day prepping for his second year as a professor and watching a documentary on bees. While to some that seemed like a tedious day, to Castiel -- it was practically heaven. As evening approached, he decided that he was going to celebrate by ordering Chinese.
She smirks.
“Don’t die.”
“Maybe we can find who is in charge around here?” Charlie says. “They can help us find our way.”
Inias leads him to the largest building in the town, one that stands out from the rest in its regality. It has marble pillars and gold tiling and is pristine from head to toe. It is much fancier than anything Vale Village had to offer and it even feels out of place in this town.
that she was only saying that because it was her job. He can only guess how many kids out there want to be rockstars when they grow up. Yet not many of them ever achieve it. He knows that Miss Beck never expected to hear Dean’s voice on the radio, or see him headline his own tour throughout the States or parts of Europe. He knows that
, being gay was not common.
“Thank you,” he murmurs on his lips.
Dean nods.
“What?”
“It was why I had to kill that friend of yours, but, mmm, she put up such a fight. Her screams were

“Something you haven’t told me before.”
He is still angry at Chuck, who has taken
But he did. He didn’t know whether it was because of the sight before him, or the day he'd just had or because of where they were. Maybe he was tired, he had no idea. Though he listened to the voice and it actually made sense. A flare of impulsivity bubbled inside of him and it was then he that he decided, a split second decision just like the one he had made when he was 16 years old.
grade, Dean and Castiel had been inseparable. What started out as lunchtimes sitting together, turned into them partnering up during class time, with Castiel’s interpreter Miss Heather, being a buffer between them. By the time it came to winter break, Castiel and Dean were walking home from school together and spending the afternoons at each other’s houses. Mary and Michael were pleasantly surprised by the boys’ friendship, how the two of them could be close despite the language barrier.
in a way—still had the habits and features of their former selves who died long ago.
“Lastly,” she whispered, “I know you are worried about your magic, honey. I can’t tell you about your magic or what it holds, but I can tell you this. You are wondering, fretting even, over why your powers haven’t evolved. Why, no matter how hard you try, they will not come into fruition. I can tell you that the barrier to your powers is something you hold deep inside of you, something that you can’t embrace, something you can’t speak. It is what is blocking you, stopping you from accessing those abilities. The moment it comes forward, the moment you let it shine, your powers will be unleashed.”
“Charlie from Vale Village.”
Castiel rolled his eyes and noticed Dean stifling a smile. Traitor.
“Your Highness,” Sir John said quietly, giving the prince a quick bow, “I apologise for my son’s behaviour.”
“I can feel the energy of this fortress, I am one with it. My destiny is to pilot this, to control it in the fight against The Empty. And that I shall do. I can’t move on until this fight is over.”
The kingdom’s repair came slowly, with the castle taking nearly two full years to be rebuilt. They had only just moved in last month, re-establishing themselves in the royal home. It’s quite strange, if Castiel’s honest with himself, as he had quite enjoyed living in Vale Village in their tiny little home. But the castle is as good as new, better than it had been before. No more creaky floorboards or paint-chipped walls. Castiel is in awe with what his land’s people were able to accomplish, and although he compensated them greatly with gold coins, no money could repay the work they had done for himself, his family and the kingdom.
hit, Dean’s store exploded with Christmas festivities.

Dean does.
Claire got up then, the two of them saying polite goodbyes before Claire hastily made her exit. She tucked the sticky note into the pocket of her jeans and headed towards her car. As she got there, she stopped and looked towards the Winchester house, the one that stood in front of her in plain view.
Dean shoots Pam a look. “Trenton, the special forces guy who knew how to hack into government systems? No, we have
The cab pulls into Cas’ driveway just after seven, the sky a mixture of purple and blue. He pays his fare and waits until the cab is down the road before he even takes a look at the house. His heart is beginning to speed up in his chest as he takes in the sight of the building before him, the house a reminder that everything right now is actually happening. All of this is

When Cas stated that he did
When Dean reaches the main control room, the connection is severed. The room is a little different than the one in the Grasslands, but still the same in it’s function and purpose. Dean suspects what is going to happen before he has even stepped inside of the room, thanks to his last visit to a fortress. So he isn’t surprised that when he takes a couple of steps into the room, a figure appears.
And for two years, he didn’t have a problem. He kept to his studies, caught up with Aaron even when they were no longer roommates. He remained an active member of the LGBT society. Yet, his sexuality remained a secret and he never felt the pressure to come out to anybody else. He continued to date girls, continued to have the occasional hook up, continued to flirt as per usual. He never was attached to anyone and while he found guys in passing attractive, it was never enough to pursue a full commitment. Usually just the occasional, secretive hook up. He didn’t even think that he would ever
Dean’s eyes widened and he felt like he had been punched in the stomach.
Claire gulped, realising that
“I know this is strange but I just wanted to speak to you without my little brother being nearby. Castiel might not be the best at reading lips, but he’s good enough you don’t want to have a private conversation in close sight range.”
The next morning, Dean wandered downstairs to find his mom cooking in the kitchen. This wasn’t an unusual occurrence for a Saturday morning; his mom was usually so busy during the week she never got time to bake or try new recipes. So most of the time, Dean woke up on weekends to the smell of sickly sweet desserts baking in the oven.
Dean waits a minute. Then two. Then three, before he speaks up.
While the customers were still confused, Dean just grinned right back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Now cheer up, sunshine. Let’s get some coffee into you, and then after breakfast we can open Grace’s presents.”
“Who… are you?”
“Are we able to go visit Miss Missouri at the library today?” Dean asked.
Dean gritted his teeth. Sometimes it was hard for him to realise that Cas lived long before he did. Cas had views that were very old fashioned, despite the fact that he was currently present for the 21st century. While he may not have realised it, his views on the show and the person, were bordering on the homophobic line.
“What has to be done,” Castiel stated. “When… when he returns… will you give him a message from me?”
Charlie saw Dean as soon as he walked through the classroom door and immediately began to cheer.
“Hello? Uh, I’m your new neighbour? I’m just here to bring over your mail.”
Relief poured over Dean and he nodded, pushing forward his homework to Cas and letting his friend read over it. He then grabbed one of the sandwiches and took a bite of it, watching his friend as he attempted to explain geometry to him.
“Dean, if you move your hands away you break the seance. Just sit still and be quiet.” She snapped. Dean did as he was told.
They are only ten minutes into their hike up the path when they come across the first lot of monsters. Vampires, as Dean has experienced before. He is quick to charge at them, slicing off their heads in a swift and efficient manner. When he’s done, both Charlie and Elizabeth are staring at him in shock.
Cas smiles. “I guess we do. Now, let me help you to the car so I can get you home.”
he told Dean,
“Claire…”
Yet despite feeling physically sick as they got off the ride, Dean couldn’t help but want to go back on. He would lie and say it was because he enjoyed it, but in reality – he didn’t want to admit to himself that he missed the comfort of Cas’ hand on his. The way they were pressed up close, the way Cas kept him grounded through one of his greatest fears. And how afterwards, Cas didn’t say a word about the ride and just suggested that they go get Dean some water.
This time, Dean and Charlie are talking about a recent fight the couple had.
Yet, nothing much had changed.
Dean nodded twice. He agreed.
Dean grins. “You’re a sap you know that?”
Dean signed, interrupting Cas. Cas looked shocked.
He loved his job, being the associate professor of American Sign Language and Deaf Culture. He loved spreading awareness about the culture he’d grown up in. He loved seeing the way many of his hearing students slowly began to become more aware of the fundamental rules of the Deaf culture and slowly began to learn more and more signs. He enjoyed watching their knowledge of sign language progress over the year, to the point that by finals, he was able to hold conversations in ASL with the majority of them.
He listens to the voice.
So… all in all… he found himself baking.
Castiel nodded.
He couldn’t help but think about the fact that the last time he saw Dean was when he left for Denver. Dean had come over to help him pack the things into his car. Dean had been keeping it together all morning, joking around and trying to keep up a positive facade, But Cas saw right through him and knew that on the inside, Dean was hurting just as much as he was.
“What happened?!” Dean yelled and signed, anger filling every fibre of his being. “WHO DID THIS TO YOU?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean huffs, “Cas, I’m sorry for not hearing you out, properly. I… Look, I’ve been waiting for you for fifteen years and during that time, I lost a lot of hope that I’d ever find the person meant for me. I got scared, worried that… that maybe I wasn’t good enough to have a soulmate. And when you told me you were my soulmate, I panicked. I lashed out as I usually do, and instead of talking it out, I left you.”
Claire went inside and followed Michael into the living room. The living room was neat and pristine. It featured a large white leather couch and two accompanying living chairs, all overlooking a large plasma screen perched on top of a fireplace. On the ledge of the fireplace, sat family pictures. Most of them featured Michael and five other people, which Claire assumed were his siblings. Claire wanted to take a good look at the pictures, see if she could get an idea of what Cas looked like. However, Michael had let her in despite his reluctance to do so. She didn’t want to push her luck.
“Mrs. Winnigan.” Cas said. “What if… what if she isn’t in Heaven? What if she hasn’t moved on? There’s… there’s no way Moby did so… what if something happened to the both of them?”
“Hi, I’m Jimmy,” the man greets, introducing himself to Dean when he spots him in the kitchen. While Cas had gone to answer the door for him, Dean remained in the kitchen with Grace, making faces at her every chance he could just to hear her laugh.
He watched as Dean rolled his eyes,
“However, I can’t help but notice a small difference. Where’s your fancy sword?”
“Okay.”
He takes off his own tie and unbuttons his own shirt just enough to pull the top of it down, exposing his left bicep. He continues to stare at Cas, taking a deep breath, attempting to prepare himself for what he’s about to see.
“Yeah I’m at the Purgatory --”
“But I won’t.”
Cas is silent for a moment, barely having blinked during the entire time Dean spoke. They stare at each other quietly, Dean waiting for Cas to make his choice. However, he doesn’t have to wait long before Cas grips his hands tightly around Dean’s jacket. Then, before he can even blink, Cas is pulling him into a searing kiss.
