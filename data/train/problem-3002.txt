„And what about the stupid deal with him. His moment of happiness? Are you just cruel? Or is poor poor Shadow so in need to have a slightly happy angel around him between all these fucked-up demons? Do you feed off that bit of happiness? Is it a compensation to never really being alive? 'S that it?“
„After I died?“
„Okay, alright, I'm out.“ Sam stand ups, grabbing his laptop while Dean chuckles.
Cas puts his trenchcoat over one of the chairs and leans at the brick wall opposite the table where Dean is sitting and sipping at his beer.
„And … how are you?“
As silence stretches again, Dean turns on the radio and searches for a channel that pleases him. Cas opens the glove compartment and fumbles around with something, Dean notices from the corner of his eye, not daring to look over to him. „Erm … this doesn't fit here, or does it?“
„Oh come on. Was it awful? Under the shower? Is it too much!? We can take a break and cuddle and stuff. Do you want do break up with me? Tell me! I'm getting nervous here.“
What never was strange to anybody was that the both of them were a couple. There was once a drunken guy in front of the cinema who called them faggots after seeing them walking, Deans arm casually around Cas shoulders. Dean was looking up, while Cas was already walking away. He hesitated and really would have liked to beat the shit out of that little fucker. But then he looked at Cas, who seemingly didn't feel offended at all and didn't care. Why should he care? For a long time he wasn't needing to prove anything and beating that dickhead wouldn't do anything for his edcucation, nor opinion. So he shrugged it away and said to himself „I killed Hitler. And beat a cruel god. Why ruin this nice evening“ and they simply walked away.
„And now I don't want to mess up. I want to make it right. I want it. I want to keep it.“ Dean takes a sip of his beer. „He's better at this than me, you know. He learned much. He's going to be a carpenter.“
Cas nods, lets him eat and watches him until Dean finishes early, lets go of his hand. He stands up rushed and gets hastily rid of the rest of the pasta. Simply throws it in the trash can, unusual for him and storms out of the kitchen without even saying a word. Cas just lets him, closes his eyes and swallows away the tears.
She smiled brightly while dropping a thick envelope on the table. „Maybe I got something for you.“
„Tell me exactly what you want, Cas.“ And he stresses the words
„But it's okay to have a vacation from all that for now, I guess.“ Cas says, „At least for a comfortable amount of time.“
After a while they go harder, rougher, it's nearly as if they wrestle on his bed.
„Nah. We'll make it happen now. Guess you two better go. Enjoy the time off of me“, Dean winks.
Cas turns to him. Seeing his boyish grin, his anger fades. He feels stronger than he felt for years, yet he is disarmed by Dean again and again.
The day came at which Sam and Eileen moved out. Sam got a place at a college. Scholarships wouldn't work out, but maybe after a first semester if he performed well. He would look for a job and best case would get easier through the next semesters, worst case had to work to afford every further semester. Nevertheless he was happy. As they put their last boxes in the car they rented, Cas told them he had a present for them, which they would have to fetch in the garage. Curiously they went looking for what Dean already knew: a massive dining table Cas made on his own.
Dean whispers „I'm close, I'm going to come.“ And in response feels Cas tremble and shiver as they then seconds later come together, embracing each other afterwards, still shivering. The sound of breathing and kissing in between is the only sound in the room.
Cas falters, it's not that he cannot look through this scheme. This will literally bring them together. But that's nice, isn't it? Feeling challenged, he agrees. „You start.“
„Why didn't you tell me sooner?“ he then often asked. Some of the stories were more gory than his favourite horror flicks. Some of them were sad. The ones dean had no idea how to comment.
The stranger stops and just asks „So we don't know each other?“
„And why again!?“
„What's that?“
No reaction.
„Wrote it.“ Dean shrugged and inhaled deeply. „Made a joke of us. Playing with us.“
„Did I hurt you?“ asks Cas.
As he raises his head, he looks again at a version of himself, the Shadow. This time it's serious. No smirking, no shrugging. It just whispers „Say your goodbyes now, boy.“
Still silent, he just gazes at Dean, who suddenly feels like prey.
As the shivering starts, Dean pulls out, comes with a loud groan.
Looking at Cas for confirmation, for anything and bends over him as far as he can, embraces him, feels his warm body and how he grips his hands in his hair and his back.
„I mean … you and I were a bit … nervous, but it was different than everything I had before.“
„You annoy me. You don't belong here anyway. I'll send you back. Everything's in order again.“
The mind-game and questions were still haunting them a bit as they walked through the garage and entered the bunkers kitchen. But it seemed far away now. It was already evening and Sam left some messages. The case wasn't a case. Eileen and him would stay at a motel, because it is already to late and simply not necessary to drive back immediately. While Dean jokingly texts him to „enjoy their time together“, he glances over to Cas who tastes Deans coffee, shakes his head afterwards, obviously disgusted by it. He even takes a step back, which appears incredibly funny to Dean and sketches a smirk on his face.
„So then it's forever“ says Dean silent and stops himself from putting his hand on Cas', because it already feels too corny for him. But he cannot prevent himself from looking at Cas expecting, no wanting, to see him happy. And his happy face is a drug he likes to get high on.
As Dean still didn't face Cas, when they were sitting in the Impala and driving out of the garage, Cas asks „What's wrong, Dean?“
Their tongues are playing with each other. Dean feels hot, strips Cas off his shirt, gets rid of his own.
After a while Vincent died and Maude signed the workshop over to Cas. At that time Cas often fell silent. It hurt to stand in the workshop, see all the remainder and signs of a life full of hard work. He remembered how much he learned at Vincents and how unconditionally he taught him so much. Vincent treated him like an equal even if Cas couldn't answer many of his questions. Where he grew up. How he met Dean. Even Dean was hurt when he saw Cas just roaming around. He would visit Maude often, again for a tea and some chatting. At that time the two of them where remembered more often of Deans grey hair, his hurting knees but also how much time they had together. On these days it felt again like a gift as on their first days after Cas came back from the empty.
„That's not fair.“
They awkwardly sit next to each other, silently. Cars are driving by. Giving each other a small glance and then looking right away. „But what I did then … it wasn't bad, or was it?“
Cas knows where Dean is now.
This hurts and seems to pierce Cas. „Dean ...“ He circles Dean, touches his face and makes him meet his eyes.
Dean gets hard too.
After another uncomfortable pause, Deans stands up hastily, grabs his laptop, ready to rush away and even strips the desk with his laptop as Sam says „It's Cas, isn't it?“
Deans looks down at him, he is not yet hard again, but extremely horny.
„You have been very loud.“
Dean and Cas on the other hand were driving around, visiting Jodie, but seeing Castiel was hard on Claire again. After some further days Sam and Dean had the talk about how life would go on. They decided to „do it right“. No credit card fraught, no shortcuts, the real deal, a normal life, a normal struggle. But they would sell some stuff from the bunker that could be interesting for collectors, but isn't dangerous. Maybe some monster teeth and stuff to make a bit extra money. „Just to get something back from hunter life.“ was Sams view on that subject.
„And we're maybe going to have sex?“ Dean asks.
„These feelings. What if they are scripted. I felt betrayed by … by Chuck, by life!?“ Dean has to stop and collect himself, before he goes on „That's why I … that's really why I was so angry all the time. It felt like a bitter joke, man. I said lots of terrible things. To … to you, to Jack. Oh
The days went by. Sam and Eileen came back, maybe even happier as before. They noticed how comfortable Dean and Cas were with around each other and how their behaviour shifted to what could be called „a couples“. The uncertainty that somehow seemed to hover over the two of them and nervous glances disappeared. Maybe they were even too comfortable in certain ways. Dean at least. He welcomed Sam by saying „Sammy, just so that you know - we had sex in every room, in yours twice.“ much to Cas displeasure.
„Hey, watcha doing?“ he asks, leaning in the door frame.
Dean told him how he felt when Cass was offed by Lucifer the night Jack was born.
„Huh“, he simply says. „Well … I'm not sure if were stealing from the Men of Letters, but  without monsters!? Maybe you're right. Guess I'll talk to Dean about it. Speaking of  ...“
The tiny, little, very human feeling Dean finally found words for. Everything will sort out now. Suddenly he had a picture in mind. Suddenly he knew very well what to do with the handouts with job offers he took from the diner. Suddenly he became even eager. Eager for the ad, searching for a car mechanic. Eager for somehow finding back to an identity. To being something else than a hunter. Eager for a future, that wouldn't end in dying during a hunt. Eager for anything. Suddenly he knew he would tell Sammy to move „Dean Winchester“ from „active“ to „inactive“ in his fine and fancy system, he shares with their extended hunter family.
„Duty?“
Cas just blinks.
What if it is real and the Shadow is going to come and get him again?
„Yeah?“ Dean asks challenging, then his hand runs over Cas body, his belly, stops at his cock and starts stroking him. Pleased he feels him becoming even bigger. Cas shivers, breathes hard and feels his cheeks and chest becoming hot. His hands search for Dean, already wet with precum and he mirrors Deans behaviour. They start kissing and breathing hard in between, feeling each others breath tickling on their skin.
It's nearly an epic joke, that they didn't get here sooner. All that time. The expectations and secret desires made the last twelve years feel so much longer than the hundreds of years he called his existence before.
„You know what - you want to go hiking, we go hiking!“
„Not if it's done with love, I guess.“ Cas comes closer, kisses him and whispers in his ears to close his eyes.
„You drew me closer when that teller was watching us.“
Dean strokes Cas and as they come, he draws him close. His face on Cas' chest, smelling his scent from fesh air, strangely present even now that they probably were in this room for hours. He embraces Cas, who is still on his lap, draws him close to his body and Cas brushes gently through his short hair. Then they rest, Dean sleeps, they get up, kiss, they repeat.
„I want you. I can't explain why it has to be this. We don't need to do it this way, if you don't want to. Of course not.“ He licks his lips and Dean is somehow aroused, snubbed and curious. In sum a feeling he cannot describe. Something between love, lust, insecurity, fear and simple lewdness. It's all. Though he never imagined himself as the receiving part, he somehow likes this notion of Cas and likes to see what happens.
The realisation about Cas identity brought a hot topic at the table. In the evening Dean is about to phone his guy for fake IDs, but he doesn't know what to tell him. Earlier Cas used Jimmy Novaks name often and still felt connected to him. Understandable. But for all persons in their life he was „Cas“. For Vincent and Maude who started treating him like a long lost son, for the people in Lebanon, for friends, for their family.
Cas observes them, laughs and smiles softly.
Dean looks surprised at Cas, who too blushes. „I … I had to leave, because I thought the Shadow could come and get me again and you too. I feared the deal could still be active somehow.“
(See the end of the chapter for
They look silently at each other, smiling until Cas asks „What are you doing?“
Dean exhales and says „So. Do you still love me?“ and looks a bit cautious.
„Phew.“ Dean sighs. They smile at each other. „Did you know, that you are glowing, when you come? 'S that an angel feature?“
„You can be very sweet.“ says Cas, leaving Dean surprised.
„And you?“ he asks.
„No I tend to keep away from that, it's lots of spells. I don't want to get anyone involved in something they don't understand. More like Old Persian, Crimean Gothic, Gaulish language, Palmyrene Aramaic, and so on. Sometimes it's diaries, sometimes archives. Once it was a recipe.“
. I didn't wanted to gamble with it. I know it's cheap.“
„And …
„Ah, you perv. To end your suffering, I just let you know were taking turns and ...“
„And?“ Cas asks.
„What's wrong?“
„What do you want?“
„But“ says Dean and clears his throat, „I'm afraid we have to clean up a bit.“
„Hiking?“
Eileen laughs until Dean says „Enough now“, still coughing, then getting a grip on himself. Cas waits some  minutes, then asks inquisitively
„I don't want o get up. I don't want to shower. I dont want to wash your scent away.“ It suddenly breaks out of him. „Fuck, that's corny ... what am I saying?“ He laughs nervously and runs his hand through his hair.
„Oh really? But you are the reason why he is here, aren't you?“ he cocks his head, his annoying voice rings in Deans ears.
He fumbles around with some lubricant and condoms. „Damn my hands are sweaty.“
„Just get something else from our heap near the archive.“
As they arrive laughing in the war room, Cas sighs. Dean stands next to him. „Isn't feeling right anymore, huh?“
He told himself that it's
„Fighting death was less scary?“
„Well. Currently I'm you, so.“ The Shadows shrugs und smirks awkwardly.
„Yeah thanks man, appreciate your help.“
„Yeah, I see.“ Dean chuckles. „So what's in your mind palace?“
„I intend to come back - and not alone.“ he says more seriously. „But if something goes wrong, you go on. Be there for him. Don't let him make a deal. Make him end the search. Okay?“
„It was incredible. I somehow lost myself for some seconds. Completely. It was like I exploded and were framed again just a second after.“ Cas says and exhales. They simply look at each other. Overwhelmed and tired from devotion, finally at ease. Till Dean breaks the silence and says „even steven“. He puts an arm around Cas and whispers close to his ear „I love you“ to which Cas responds „I love you too.“
Dean swallows, Cas has no idea what these words do to him. Tenderly he runs a hand over Cas face and kisses him. While he cannot think of anything else, this simple consent and wish of the two of them to be with each other and be intimate with each other means a lot to him. It's precious to him as sex never was. As no flings have ever been. Flings, meaningless sex, that was just an instrument to cope with emptiness. Now his head seems to be empty, but his heart full.
Cas looks at him, soft, yet frowning.
„Should I stop?“ asks Cas carefully, feeling and seeing how tight Dean is.
„You made me a sandwich?“
„Yeah, whatever.“ And the stranger fumbles some crumpled dollar bills out of their pockets to pay and attempts to leave. The helpless and rushed gesture on shaky knees remembers Cas of his first steps as a human, when he nearly completely drained all his mojo before he really became human and the sheer memory stings. He feels empathy, where there was shock before. Dean too feels eerily remembered that time, when he left Cas alone while he was human.
„Yeah, I know.“ He sits on the other side of the table, facing Dean, who gives him an annoyed look with red marbled eyes, mumbling an exhausted „Good morning.“
Dean shifts his position, wants to push deeper into Cas, who finally allows himself to moan and bends, gives in into a motion, that hits something in him. And as they come, they collapse on each other, breathing and shivering. Entwined in each other. Their backs and bellies are lifting and lowering, unable to speak. Minutes after Dean moves slowly, puts a kiss on Cas chest, where he hears his heartbeat, then his mouth. Cas draws him again in a passionate kiss. Their arms run over each others body, they aren't finished yet. Years of longing breaks free. Questions if they liked it, if it felt good, unnecessary. After a while Dean collapses tiredly on Cas, wo clasps his arms around him.
The more Cas and him were invited to dinner at Deans coworkers and visited nice small houses with children running around the halls, they started missing buildings with windows and their life in the bunker was starting to feel unsual. It was full of memories of a life that now seemingly was really over. Cas was handling the workshop nearly on his own, Vincent and his wife Maude let him work there as he desired and they usually saw each other just for a tea and some chatting. When Dean and Cas were invited for dinner or went somewhere with friends, he would give him smirking glances as soon as he ate, knowing that most of it still tasted terrible for him and he was just very good at hiding. Sometimes Cas simply drank something and said that he already ate. Sometimes it bothered Cas, sometimes he missed certain food he tasted before from when he was human. Thankfully he was mostly distracted from all the different, positive aspects of living under humans very well.
„Ah, just me coping.“
„You could have helped him yourself. Why didn't you, new sheriff in town?“
He looked surprised to Sam and fell over against the wall, clenched one of his hands, in which he still holds shards and cuts himself even more. Sam runs to him, clouts Deans hand, so that he lets go of the shards, props Dean and helps him to get to his room while swearing.
„What do you mean?“
Cas looks worried. „Really?“
Cas nods and doesn't dare to say „if you want to“ again, because he already did and fears the answer as he fears the lack thereof.
„We're good. Glad it came out this way.“ Jody winks and Donna hugs everyone, especially Cas, saying she was happy to finally meet him. After they left and Sam and Eileen went in again, Cas thinks that's the moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean hesitates and gestures as if he wants to wipe something away „I'm not good at it. It always looked like so much more is at stake. Than just fucking and a bit relief and a bit fun. I was afraid to loose you, man. Everyone left me sooner or later. Mum, Sam left, Cassie, then Dad. You choose to stay with me. Longer than anyone who's not my blood. You've been a
And that's when he finally realized that it's not a dream. That he is there and not in the Empty anymore. It hits him that Dean
„Or it isn't.“ Sam patted Deans shoulder. „Today it's your turn cooking. But because I'm so nice I'll help you.“
Dean bends over Cas, grabs his legs carefully and pulls him gently closer to him while looking at him slowly.
„I have no idea what I would be doing then. Or
Still with this serious look on his face. Dean is mesmerized.
Dean is so close. It was even easier to face the apocalypse or so it seems to him at that moment.
„I think you love him. Not like a brother. Or a best friend. We've been here before, Dean. And now he's gone again and you are grieving. And you do it very poorly, Dean.“
„No I mean … that Jack maybe … brings him back?“
„Well … they're rich. They don't have to I guess.“
This hits. He feels his chin tremble. He looks around and down to Cas in his arms. Then the sound of a fight. To his right he sees himself beating Cas like he did under the influence of the Mark of Cain. His face looks nearly grey, his eyes lifeless as he stabs the angel blade next to Cas and rushes away after his gritty oneliner. Cas is heavily bleeding.
In fact Cas cannot sort that person into any label, nor can Dean. He couldn't tell the biological gender. He doesn't see definitive signs of age. Or ethnic. As if that person is everything, he sees stereotypical attributes from different origins, which makes nothing stereotypical. There definitely is a special aura around that person, but he reads a human pattern. That one is no one and everyone at all.
But whenever Dean passed him like this, like he just did after he said „Wanna go for the cinema?“ something wasn't right at all. In situations like this his face would be expressing that everything is fine, but it wasn't. And it was hurting to notice it and sad to notice that he is hiding something for whatever reason.
Deans hair is now more grey than anything and Cas „decided“ to have gray hair at his temples too in solidarity. After some intense weeks they got their first barbecue and invited Sam, Eileen with their little daughter Mary, the neighbours, Vincent and Maude, Jody, Donna and some colleagues from their work. They weren't really sure if it would work out to discuss „hunting“ whenever the neighbors and coworkers were busy or standing in another corner. But they believed it worked out.
„Well … it was nice.“
„You weren't hitting on anyone for a while.“
„You can't help me. I missed it. Missed the chance. 12 years long.“ Dean laughs in a bitter and dark way and Sam gets the hint that this will hurt for a while.
„So … you wanna, you wanna be the one to … you know. Or should I?“ And runs nervously through his hair. This gestures appears so much „Dean“ and Cas just laughs. His smile infects Dean, who blushes immediately and lays on his back, exclaiming
Dean lays on Cas chest, exhausted, destroyed, stretching is legs.
Dean hesitates and runs his fingers over his beard stubble. „Remember when I said hamster wheel? When I was so angry that I even pointed a gun at you, yelled at everyone and accepted Jack as a walking bomb?“
Cas is steadily shifting between passionate and insecure, attractive as hell in one moment, adorably helpless the next.
Home is …
Dean smells his scent of fresh air, tastes his lips, which are as soft as he imagined them. As their chins and beard stubble meet, it produces an uncomfortable sandpaper sound. He is so close and moves even closer as Cas is nearly sitting on his lap, kissing more passionately. For an instance Dean remembers not to go to fast and parts too hastily, their eyes meeting and they breathe heavily. Cas' runs his fingers through Deans hair slowly as he closes his eyes to just enjoy the touch and rests his head against Cas chest, who then presses a kiss at Deans head.
Dean asks Cas „What would you like to do?“
„If it's Cas and if it's what I think, it's pathetic if you keep on playing your … thing. Whatever it is that you are doing. It really is.“
Cas doesn't really know how to feel about that or how to react, so he just says „But it's healing at once, it wouldn't work.“ He grabs Deans neck and tries to meet his eyes.
Dean nods and just looks at him, frowning. All energy left him.
„Yes.“ he says self-assured. „So tell me where he is or bring him here or whatever. Or simply send us back.“ He adds „Please.“
Sex wasn't making him nervous for a long time, but tonight it did.
Sam passes the room again, saying „Oh wow. Guess I better walk faster.“
„Nah, I think that's just because we hadn't the time to … talk. There was a lot of unspoken truths and stuff. And I was very drunk.“ he paused.
„Figuring out a position?“ Dean laughs and tilts his head back. „Oh, look at us.“
„The rake?“
„Me?“ Cas looks surprised, thinks, exhales. „No. And he's doing ok, I think.“ Dean nods.
Afterwards they're laying exhausted on the floor, their breathing the only sound in the house until Dean exclaims „That was so good. But. Fuck. My knees.“
„Horny?“ asks Dean blatant, grinning, suddenly more awake.
Approximately 15 minutes after Dean went for a drive with baby, he recognized an unfamiliar stuttering sound and turned, right back again to the bunker, to take a look. His hands slick with oil, he is working on baby. Sams questions are all to present to him. It's true, he always knew the hunter life. The family business. But now hunting doesn't even come to mind, when Sammy asks about the future. But what else? Somehow he cannot imagine Cas and him wearing matching cardigans and sitting at home with some cats in front of their feet. As as he sees new rusty marks at baby, the failing parts, the needed overhaul, it awfully seems like the end of an era. Funny thing is – he doesn't know yet if it's a reason to laugh or to cry. Maybe neither.
If he wouldn't find any clues, he would have to call Cas and hope that something happens. That he magically appears. This was Plan A, simple as that. He checked the time at his mobile phone, but much to his horror time seemed to stood still. The phone wasn't frozen, but time seemed to be. And of course there was no signal. He couldn't even check the web if it's just his phone or if time was really standing still in the empty. Guessing the latter he started calling
Cas nods. „I like it, but … are you sure you are going to like it?“
Then finally says „There's no need to be.“ This time he makes the first step and slowly and gently presses his lips on Deans. Cas' lips are soft, his beard stubble the complete opposite.
„Better than I would have hoped.“
„What will you say to him?“
„Want me to come with you?“ asks Dean louder than he intended to and thinks to himself that he is a fucking coward.
It's been weeks since he heard someone say his name.
And without an answer their faces get closer and lips touch. Excitement boils in them with an intensity, that is new to Cas and a feeling long forgotten for Dean.
Dean is rocking forth and back with Cas in his arms, always repeating „Please come back to me“ like a mantra.
Dean Winchester, who never missed a chance with a girl. He would just make an idiot of himself. And tears streamed over his face and he decided to go to his room before Sammy sees him like this. Not in possession of his right mind, the glass slipped and shattered on the floor of the corridor. He cut himself trying to fetch the shards.
„Do you think this is trouble?“
„You will never sleep, will you?“
. If I answer your question with 'yes', I have to move one step towards you and you can ask further questions. If I respond with a 'no', I stay where I am and it's your turn. And vice-versa.“
„Come on, don't do that to me, Cas! I really got the impression you liked it judging from moaning and orgasms and …! You know!“
„No“ says Cas straight away, exhales and then says „So it's my turn now.“
„You're right.“
„Is this what you feel? Remorse?“
„I just … I just wanted you back, man. I … I love you and ...“ And know he couldn't speak anymore. He said so much. He believed he did good. Before in the Empty he said it all. And now he was too tired and too weak. Cas looks at him, stunned, just manages to put a hand at his shoulder as the door is screeching and Sam and Bobby rush in the room, seeing the two of them and stop suddenly until Sam says „Thank god - you're alive“ and collapses in the doorframe.
One day in the grocery store Cas noticed being viewed. A sensory stimulus that humans and angels shared, when something in their circumference is acting strange, unexpected or remarkable. An instinct older than the world. A woman watched him. Dark skin, reddish hair, dark freckles, friendly eyes. He saw through her vessel and recognized her as an angel, but not one he was familar with. He was able to read her name through her vessel, but that didn't told him nothing. He looked at her and she seemed to be similar stunned to see him. Like a rare animal, last of their kind they were staring at each other. But they weren't the last of their kind anymore, weren't they? Angel radio was more populated with all kinds of voices. A slight smile, he reciprocated. Then she turned and went away. Cas stood there for some more minutes, still smiling. He felt less extinct now.
„Why? What?“
Since Sam told her some details, she was fearing to hurt Dean. He may was doing better compared to what Sam told her about how bad Deans morale was over a month before. Having something to do that connects him with Cas and be united with Sam and her for a chance to maybe end his misery in whatever way was helping. But Sam and she herself feared to find nothing or that it hit Dean too hard to deal with it. Now they got something, but it hit her how uncharmingly and brutally the description fits Deans emotional state.
? Did he
„So the visit worked for you?“
„That … that's exactly it … I … haven't said anything when it would have mattered.“ Sam rushes to him and embraces him and whispers „Finally, you dickhead. I know ... I know.“ And Dean just shakes in his arms and cries like a little boy.
„I just thought it would last longer.“
„From porn.“
This small outburst of self-confidence is sexy. Dean suddenly feels like he moves in slow-mo, like he couldn't keep up.
They part, just a bit and their noses touch accidentally. Dean runs his fingers through Cas hair, his hand stops at his neck, a long glance and after it they share a kiss. First nice, sweet, slow, then they go faster. Something in the two of them breaks free, they start touching each others backs, their necks, their loins and start dragging at their clothes. Dean starts undressing first.
„Penetration, yes.“ Cas nods too, looks seriously, then breaks and smiles. Dean just thinks „He's playing with me. He learns fast.“
But that this realization happened was big and they knew. Just looking at each other, silently, observing every blink and breath of the other one, nothing was left to say.
„Because I don't want it to. Yet.“
Could it be another first next to sleeping with a man? Most likely, he thinks. In his now over fourty years he never felt this at ease. Some things were funny to him. Another hard throbbing cock, so visible display of desire, the feeling of strong, maybe even stronger, arms around him. Two pairs of hairy legs. He chuckled, noticing Cas confused look. As their eyes met his thoughts stop circling and melt into blank space as it did so often in the past. He looks at Cas, at his slightly darker nipples, the wet traces and slightly irritated skin where he sucked and kissed him. And this feeling spreads in him again. His heart, his chest, his stomach, his loins.
„For how many years is this going on? I assume some.“
Then the figure notices Dean looking, instantly flinches and seems to be really uncomfortable. „Should we leave? Talk to that one?“ asks Dean.
But if he would have to choose a surname, this would be Winchester, wouldn't it? And what would that mean for him and for Dean?
„Yeah.“ he sighs. „I … I had a moment in which I thought … that's it. And I … nearly let it slip away. It's stupid. Now it looks so easy. To say it. Love. I love you. Why was it so hard all that time?“
Dean breaks, tears in his eyes. He laughs bitterly and thinks about the print on his jacket. The jacket he didn't dare to wash. The jacket with Cas' dried handprint, he hid in his closet. The jacket he sometimes holds in his hand in these fucking desperate, fucking silent hours around midnight.
„I've never really paid attention to your tattoo. In all these years.“
Cas looks around him and realizes where they are. „You didn't … no.“
Cas smiles his soft smile.
me, Dean.“
Eileen on the other hand started working at a law firm next to finishing her studies. Cas and Eileen seemed most happy with their occupation, Sam too most of the time, Dean not really. He wasn't unhappy, but most of the time, when he came home, he was relatively grumpy and needed some time with Cas to come back to himself. On some days he said to Cas „It's normal, it's good, it's fine.“ But on others he said „My boss is a pain in the ass and it just feels … dunno, pointless. Doing the grunt work for what!?“
Dean couldn't distinguish where he ends, where Cas begins. His crotch, his stomach is prickling, it is tight and hot, and it drives him mad. The anxiety to fuck up, that increased just moments ago so fast is now arousel that feels like it's going to take over his body.
„Know what?“
Sam, Eileen and sometimes the kids are from now on visiting every weekend. While Dean is messing with the kids, Cas tells Sam where to find all documents and keys. He tells him, that he has to and will be following Dean immediately. They work things out. Sometimes Sam is in lawyer mode, sometimes he is Sammy and doesn't want to leave when it's sunday evening, but leaves nevertheless. Sometimes they can completely forget about it. Sometimes not.
„He was? How?“
He looks embarassed, clears his throat and says „Sorry.“
„I don't know if that's what he would want. As far as I know he rests in peace.“
„No. Not without him.“ Dean says and grabs Cas by his shoulders and shakes him, agitated, but not too hard. As nothing happens and he feels sorry for treating him like this he embraces him. Draws his body close. Presses one hand tenderly to his rigid, lifeless back, the other to his head and keeps it close to his face. He smells him. He smells
„Angel radio.“
He walks over to a tree and collapses against it. He should be happy, but all he feels is just
Donna looks at him unbelievingly. „Angel radio?“ and starts asking questions about heaven and hell again, drawing him in a confusing discussion, again with utter awe in her face.
„You done?“ asks the Shadow.
„But it's Jacks first week at kindergarden.“
That notion is completely different from what he expected.
„What? Whyyy?“ asks Dean, getting up to meet Cas face.
And Sam breaks again. Dean calls him a wimp while having watery eyes himself.
Embarassment and the effort to swallow tears reddens his face. He can't stand Cas look - that he sees him like this.
„Wait … did you …? Do you have your wings back?“
„Well, just if you … want it too. All the other things we did are nice too. And … as I said yesterday I have never done that … . But … I … .“ He hesitates.
Cas nods, laughs without a sound and looks down to the waffle in front of him. Dean observes him and feels like the weight of the world was lifted from his shoulders. Thinking that the first time in his life something seems to be working out. He looks in Cas eyes noticing how light blue they are. A shade the dimmed light of the bunker usually swallows and won't give back. One of the many reasons why he secretly liked it very much to go for a case with Cas, which happened too less. Him nearby, dailight, the road.
Cas frowns, clears his throat and says „And you won't think anymore that my mannerisms are cute. What was once funny or nice may starts to annoy and distress you. It's years. I'm living under humans for years. A decade. I know that relationships change. And I guess that happens especially when you don't have to fear each others death every week because of some near-apocalyptical event. I just like to think it's possible. I'm sorry I shouldn't have brought that up. You were joking and it's okay.“
„Look … forever is long. I know I said forever myself just a minute ago. And I mean it. But don't expect to much of me. You know me. I … I wasn't treating you always right. And later … you know. If I'm coming from work to meet you in our beautiful small house and I'm annoyed by my coworkers and the homework I have to do for evening school; I'll be a douchebag. For sure. I may take my frustration out on you and you will start hating me and then forever is no concept anymore and you maybe stop liking me and don't give me puppy-eyes anymore. Even a lifetime can be long.“
Cas looks at him. „Thats the most romantic thing I ever heard you say.“ and reaches to him. They kiss and whisper sweet nothings in each others ears in between. Finally they decide to shower and move to the bathroom. Dean fears the pipes will wake the whole bunker and hopes they are still sleeping off a hang-over from the bonfire. Jody and Donna intended to stay in an air bnb in the city, while Bobby would be in the guest room. They didn't notice them at all, they must have hit their matraces after Dean fell asleep. „Savely in the arm of my angelic boyfriend“ he thinks and chuckles.
It's obviously not good marketing (hehe ^^') to recommend another writers work at this point, but it's just fair (and we're a community). It has the in my opinion smartest approach to "how Cas could be rescued from the Empty" I read so far. It's hard to top that, which is why I was in the end not so happy with my own approach. But also not unhappy - I haven't changed it afterwards or anything.
„Ok, your turn.“ Relieved.
With a sigh he notices that his bag didn't travel with him and mourns the food and water in it as well as the backup gun. He takes his mobile phone from his pocket and turns the flashlight mode on. There isn't even a cone of light. A bitter scent spreads in his mouth as he asks himself how he is going to find Cas, not to mention an exit after he found him. Sam knew. If he would have been honest with himself, he knew it too. This was doomed to fail. He frowns, looks around him, mumbles „Damn, Cas.“ and just heads in a randomly chosen direction.
„No, it's not.“
„Was I … was it strange? Did I do anything strange?“ asks Cas, looking worried.
„A bit messy, hm? You know I could zap it … away.“
While Dean rambles, more and more angry, the Shadow comes closer, then squats in front of them.
But then notices the red face. And the hard-on in Cas trousers.
„Hey man, good to see you.“ Sam grins wide and pats Cas back.
The Shadow stops smirking, Dean notices and goes on, hoping to achieve something. Even if it means to piss it off epicly. Any reaction instead of killing him or sending him away will do. Anything. Because shooting or knifing sure will not, they may are just stuck here and he still doesn't know how to wake up Cas.
„Yes, there was some pressure from time to time.“
After which Dean mumbles „Ok well … it's already autumn, then this will be next summer then.“
„Me too.“ says Dean then with a rare soft expression. He leans on his arms and kisses him. Gently they tease each other with their upper or lower lip. Dean heads down to Cas throat. As he embraces Cas and rests his head on his chest, he doozes off and Cas just lets him and holds him, his chin burrowed in Deans hair. „Life.“
1 Special needs * Placebo
„Not anymore.“ he smiles, shortly. „My turn.“
„I hope it won't be one.“
Home is with Dean.
He tries to get out of him how arousel smells, but Cas smiles and just shakes his head. That he's going to keep to himself and enjoy how it will drive Dean crazy not to know.
„Don't relativize it.“ says Cas while carassing Deans face.
„What Dean Winchester really feels.“
Dean looks over to him.
„It was on your laptop, when I opened it a while ago.“
They plan to visit Jody and Donna and bring them the good news of the end of monsters. But first they drive back to the bunker and just want to be lazy. Dean would never admit it, but he was tired after their hiking trip. That hiking and even the shared silence with Cas was fun he wouldn't admit either.
Whenever he looked at Dean in the past decade since that day he raised him from perdition, a warm feeling and a shiver spread in his chest. It came with an unsettling nervousness, with craving for being acknowledged and noticed and a certain expectation that again and again fell into dark emptiness when they were apart.
„You are not really devastated by the news.“ Sam sips at his beer while Dean opens one with a characteristic fizzle, which unfortunately indicates he grabbed one of the cheap brands.
„Because that worked so well for you?“ Eileen smiles bittersweet. Dean wants to add something, but she interrupts „I know. I know, Dean. Just please come back, okay? Annoy the hell out of that thing and bring him back and be happy together with feathers, okay? I want us to have corny stupid couple dates. Exchange silly stories on how we all got together. Exchange stupid stories from our childhood and first dates that will embarrass us.“
„Yes. Yes, I am.“ And then remembers what they are doing. „Oh, right.“ And moves two steps towards Cas, giving up his comfortable place at the table and awkwardly shoves his hands in his pockets, thinking about his next big question. But first it's Cas turn.
fucking day with each other.“
Dean obeys, he lets him have it exactly as he wants it.
All happens very fast.
This chapter is my favourite. I really would like to read your thoughts on it in the comment section. Comments do help me to get better and understand what's working for you and what not. And of course I'm happy about every kudos. ;)
„Yeah … I didn't want to call you Nic Cage or Meg Ryan. So …
Sam passes in the corridor, saying „Great book.“ Dean rolls his eyes.
"Time works different around here." Cas grips him tight and feels somehow exhausted, lets his head sink on Deans shoulder. "Now I don't have to loose you again."
„Back in the days?“
„I don't know … wouldn't that be bothersome for him? And if I don't earn anything, I wouldn't be of much help for the household I guess.“
„Must be angel qualities“ he whispers, thinking that these blue eyes may truely looked all the time right into him.
But what troubled him endlessly was that it seems to be so difficult for Dean to admit being in love with a man or someone who appears as a man. Being bi, being gay, what's the matter with that? They met hunter husbands, they met so many people along their way. It never seemed to matter. Was it a daddy issue? Was Dean shaped like this? Believing that being him means being manly according to these false standards. Standards to which being manly equals being strong equals being a badass and not equals having emotions, fall in love desperately and ache for another
„Not convention as in 'Star Trek Convention' I assume?“ asks Dean.
Their stiff cocks are hanging between them in the air like flagpoles.
„Well considering official regulations I am resigned and officially dead. But I'm also not dead in the sense of humans being dead.“
„And now?“
Finally this day appears as long as it really was and takes its toll as Dean dozes off. Cas is relieved, words are coming back to his mind, that just melted. In a strange way he feels fulfilled if that makes sense. And as he holds Dean, he finds a new comfort space. Instead of the bunkers kitchen, he would now go back to this moment in his mind, whenever he needs to withdraw from the world. To Deans weight on him, feeling their damp, sweaty skin – skin on skin. And Deans arms around him.
again?
And Dean said annoyed „Oh of course you can, you geek!“
Dean feels Cas stubble at his throat, his chest, his nipple. And he feels the pressure in his trousers rising.
Cas rolls over on his back, laughs nervously and says „Don't do that … I'll … I.“
Cas gets nervous, evaluates how clairaudient Deans room is – wasn't there a grid at the lower part of the door? Helplessly he searches for the right response and finds none. „Sam, that's … erm ...“
Bobby nods and leans back. „You will.“
„Seemingly. You were right.“ Cas gives him a sideglance.
„You're … the Shadow?“ Dean swallows.
„Did you like sex? You had sex as a human, right?“
Cas nods, looks knowingly at the two of them, when he says „There is even room at the table for visitors“ and he looked at Dean, smiling. And at Eileen while saying „or for, well, children?“ Eileen smiled, obviously Cas knew what she hasn't yet told anyone.
„And you want to do that? Dean, you may don't come back.“
Sam leans against the doorway. „Yeah, I suppose so.“ He clears his throat, eyeing Dean. „You know, what Cas does is surely sorting out how life is going on. Where he is left off concerning Jack, heaven and duty. What about you?“
He wants to play by Cas' rules, but he also wants to challenge him and savor the mood.
„But Sam and Eileen … .“
„I'm sorry to say this and ruin the mood but I really badly want to ask you … wanna do more?“
came to get him and the weight of his words. And he exhales long and rests his head against the trunk of the tree and smiles with a somehow painful expression on his face. „So what Dean said ….?“
Finally it happens.
„No, look, that's not it. You mean … you mean
As he sits on the porch that evening he tries to imagine what life would have been if they would have taken another road. Made different decisions. If he would have given in to Michael. If he wouldn't have decided to search for his father. If he wouldn't have decided to work with Cas, to call him family, to tell him that he loves him. If he simply died by a random vampire or werewolf. Or if something would have happened to Sammy and the kids were never born. Eileen would never be a part of their family. What if he had decided to kill Cas? Not to save Cas? Not pray to Cas? There were so many crossroads. He's right as usual. It could have went differently.
„Searching for jobs.“
„What's that?“ asks Cas, interrupting Dean.
„What I would do?“ The Empty in Deans image frowns, then sighs exaggaratedly.
„Everything ok?“ asks Cas as they were sitting in the kitchen and Dean freezes while eating.
During the drive Cas hands wander over his woolen sweater. While feeling the fabric, he says quietly „It's nice.“ Dean gets some strange expression that life somehow maybe just started for Cas, even if he already was human for a while. And even if he certainly has been living for a while with them. With him.
That hits. Dean stops immediately.
. So much he never felt before. Even if he wasn't touching him, he could feel
Silence. Cas wanted to say something, stops, looks to Dean, looks to Sam, who says immediately „Me too. Very much.“ Cas and Dean say simultaneously „Thanks“. Cas quietly, Dean with much self-confidence. They look at each other, hoping that their aura as a new attraction to gossip in the bunker would fade now and Dean grins.
„Hell yes, that was some fucked up shit.“
„A penny for his thoughts“ he thinks, but says „You are beautiful“ and swallows hard.
Cas is panicking, grabbing Dean by his shoulders. They're faces are close, Dean looks at him, still happy, teary eyes.
„Really?“ Dean sounds a bit disappointed.
Bobby looks at Dean „You hungry? Your bag was still here. We didn't dare to touch the jacket, but we put that away. Wanna eat? And you? Ah you don't eat ...“ and gestures towards Cas.
„Ah, perfect.“ Dean chuckles. „That wasn't what I asked, but I note that. Good to know.“
Dean never felt like this. He never had this intense, intimate moments with anyone. This must be ecstasy and he doesn't want it to end. Everytime he looks at him, exhausted after sex and with loving eyes, he feels unconditionally loved. Had he ever tasted it? He doesn't want it to end. What's burning in his chest is love. As well as the burning wish to keep what they have, to make it last, linger, to make up for so much lost time. Does Cas feel the same? Dean looks at him and asks „Are you okay?“
„I don't want to make deals anymore.“
He searches for the Shadow. Appearing as Dean, it watches them from the distance, coming slowly closer.
„Seems to be a nice fella. Gramps.“
The bunker was so damn silent. No sound, no noise. Somewhere a ticking clock, that's all. Before it all happened, he sometimes heard Cas wandering around at night time. When he was there at least. When Dean would have to take a leak or wanted to drink some water or just couldn't sleep, he would stroll through the corridors and get a strange feeling when passing the corners, rooms, corridors. It took him a while to pin it down to
As his face goes up and down in Cas crotch, he catches some glances at Cas' face.
Absorbed in thoughts Sam emptied on of his bags from their latest hunt. Bloody shirts dropped to the floor. Where did he fail? Why wasn't it save enough for Dean to talk to him? Why didn't he said anything to Dean on his own? For a while, maybe even for years, he was thinking that Cas and Dean were practically married. He should have asked how it was for them. Why didn't he? Was he too always waiting for the next apocalypse to be over before considering living? But somehow he managed. Eileen and him were friendzoned for a while too.
„Are you holding back?“ Dean looks at him softly.
Truth is he never really considered that Cas could be doing him, but now that there here, he cannot refuse him. It even arouses him after the first minutes passed in which Cas slipped one, then a second finger in him. Dean tries to playfully hide his own embarrassement with remarks like „that wasn't in that porn as far as I remember“, but looking over his shoulder sees Cas face with a look of adoration and lust.
„No. I believe a part of you wants to live. I can arrange that too.“
The old man comes over and gives Cas a business card. „My son, call if you want to learn.“
„Tomorrow, ok?“
„Like you do.“
„First I thought it's Jack.“ Sam goes on, „That you need closure after the awful things you said before he became a walking bomb. Or that you now need to prevent apocalypses to be satisfied with yourself. But it's Cas. Am I right?“
„I know! It's too late. God damn it. Don't you think I know now? I tried to tell myself, that he was at peace. That thing took him how they agreed on. When he was happy. I tried to tell myself that he is okay with it. But he's dead. I lost him. And I fucking cannot stop thinking about him.“ And his angry voice breaks and he throws the laptop from the table. A metallic crash, Miracle runs away whimpering.
„I'm sorry to hear that. But it caused something good.“
He doesn't want to be treated like a delicate flower. He was a soldier and even if not visible he took many scars, injuries and even deaths without being scared. On the other hand it is nice to see Dean Winchester caring and gentle. And most of all this careful with him. While something in Cas shifts, he remembers Dean of the night they met. In that barn with his intense stare, like he could directly look into Dean. Like he did now. Dean clears his throat.
Dean sighs, he is not even looking at Cas, nevertheless appears angry. As he finally speaks, he sounds more sad than everything else. „Look … we had
„But it was great, wasn't it?“ asks Dean. „You good? How are you feeling?“
Cas caresses Deans shoulder, holds his face, looks at him saying „Is it .. because you are sad? Did I do something wrong?“
Cas turns to Dean and describes one of the customers, sitting alone at a table, gazing out of the window, absorbed in thoughts.
Unnerved by Cas' frozen, frowning, speechless face, Dean goes on „I'm stupid, I know. This is pathetic. Without even a propper party, without even a real celebration. Without a real proposal“ as Cas interrupts him „It's perfect“, laughs and has tears in his eyes at the same time.
„You ok?“ he asks Cas and feels terribly insecure.
He mumbles „The Empty, huh? No kidding.“ and then turns hectically.
„Wake him up!“ he yells at the Shadow, that doesn't react and just playfully walks around them in circles.
Cas swallows, blushes noticeably and his hands are trailing slowly down to Deans cock, stroking him.
It feels as if his face and mouth is dry from all their kissing, their stubble, but they won't stop. He's already getting hard again and reaches over to something in his nightstand. „I hope this will do.“
„...“
Cas face brightens.
„Let's see where this is going.“ Dean says. His smile wrinkles are small indicators how much time passed, how long he had to wait until they arrived at this point. Sitting here with his family, happy-go-lucky, including Cas. Bobby asks Cas something, waking him from his state of trance.
Cas looks at Dean and they both stand up slowly as if every move could be the one stepping on the bomb.
And then one evening they're sitting on the porch again; Sam, Eileen and the kids left; it's getting awfully cold and they decide to go in. As Dean passes Cas he knows it's today or tomorrow and it's as hurtful as if something cuts him. As if a part of him dies. He turns the porch light off and slowly goes in, tries not to appear as if something is wrong. As they go to bed, he tells him he loves him like he does everyday and Dean tells him too like he does everyday. As soon as Dean enters the deep sleep phase, he again tries to heal him. It maybe heals a bruise, but nothing more.
„A heart specialist ... I believe.“
cats are allowed exactly?“ She gave him a weird look while Dean turns the back on them, laughing.
„Huh. Problem solved.“ thinks Dean as Cas leans over and says „Why … .“ and stops in astonishment, eyes locked to the screen.
„Nah. Sounds childish, right?“
„Eager to go for the suicide mission?“ she asks.
„Because it was important that Dean does it himself. The hard way. I'm glad you sent them both back. Must be like back in the days.“
As Cas is hard too, they turn the water on again and rinse the foam away. Small drops rest on their skin, overall their body, like they are impenetrable for it. Cas fingertips wander over Deans shoulder, through small crystal clear water drops, leaving wet traces. They wander to his throat, which he kisses, then his mouth.
Since they started to get intimate, „want“ rises in him. He craves. Something he never allowed himself to feel. Unconditional, silent love always seemed to be enough till it wasn't. One-sided love. But it was gnawing at him. To be less for Dean than he is for him. And now he finds himself here doing all
„Very.“
Dean gives him a soft smile. The wrinkles on his forehead are a bit deeper now. His hair a bit greyer. „Nah. Not really. It's alright how it is. More than alright.“
„No. It's just a part of myself I didn't experienced … that much. I tried to lock that away.“
„Yeah … I know, but – how!? Were you always able to do that?“
Dean exhaled. „For what?“
„Oh yes we are.“ Bobby nods and frowns.
Cas puts a nice and gentle kiss on Deans mouth. Now that they both dared to show each other their weak points, they seem to be even.
Cas changed. How much he gave up, evolved and changed himself and his life. For years. Because of Dean. For Dean? Ready to start off new. And what was Dean doing? Suffering because he wouldn't be a hunter anymore. Cas changed for a decade after being „him“ for hundreds, if not thousands of years. This seems to be a lot. Dean fell silent and Cas noticed.
But then he realizes that he hasn't heard Cas coming in.
They look at each other, exhausted, pausing, waiting, Cas overwhelmed, finally he laughs.
He smirks, nods, licks his lips and thinks that Cas obviously knows how to play. „Ok, you're right. Go on.“ They both laugh.
Much to his surprise Cas says „I know“ and tilts his head as if he wants to challenge Dean.
Dean couldn't shake the thought how enthusiastic Cas suddenly gets. Maybe still low-key comapred to other people, but for Cas this is real enthusiasm. For even the smallest things. An apple. Craft. He himself was rarely like this. Maybe when it comes to food. When he was a child, he naturally was enthusiastic about everything. But that ended with his mothers death and the hunter life. Too soon trying to be the grown up. But Cas? He skipped being a child and being enthuastic and discovering and now maybe caught up on that. Maybe it's in our code? In all of us. Seeing the peaceful expression on Cas face and the slight hint of a smile touched him in a place buried deep in his mind. „Will you call him?“
After that Dean doesn't think anymore. He just does. Does what he would like, what would drive him mad with lust.
„He said that Cas wasn't doing his job, wasn't acting like all other Castiels from other worlds. He wasn't playing according to Chucks script. I remember that now. I do for some weeks okay. I get it. I missed my fucking chance, okay?“ As he raised his voice more and more it echoed through the library and lingered some terrible seconds between them and startled the dog.
Every touch of Dean sends a shiver through Cas. Like an electric charge. Not hurting, but stimulating.
Dean swallows and joins him. As the water runs over their bodies, they kiss and he gently touches Cas biceps, just with his fingertips. Surprisingly Cas foams some shower gel in his hands and presses it on Deans naked chest and starts soap him. Dean looks astonished and freezes. Better than porn is when it really happens.
„First he was okay-ish. He could be more happy about how we defeated Chuck. That's what I thought at that time. But I wasn't worried for the first couple of weeks. But then... you know maybe he should tell you himself. Let's just say – that was just the tip of the iceberg. And then I made an attempt to guess what's wrong. That he is mourning you, because he's in love and turns out that's it. We decided to find out how to summon the Empty and the rest is history.“
Slowly and steadyly he pushes into Dean. Both close their eyes in sweet pain. He goes faster and deeper and sees relieved how Dean relaxes and lets it happen. This time he seems to enjoy it and moans Cas name, grabs the bed-head, grabs Cas' bizeps. They don't last long and after that crash next to each other on the mattress. Dean jokes breathless that they get better with every time, they are tired and exhausted, arm in arm, rest, sleep, repeat.
After that he furiously opens the door and sits in the impala. Cas laughs, whipes his face, nods, sits too and adds „Yes.“
But it doesn't matter.
„Why are you doing this for me? What's in it for you?“
„But I feel ... more.“
„Ah, sorry, I didn't want to invade your room. Just was looking for you. Wanna go to the cinema?“
„Very observing, huh?“ Dean shakes his head. „We have no rules about having to explain our answers, but since you noticed on your own … . Lately I was drinking so much I was not myself anymore. Sometimes I was drunk for days without a clear moment in between. Because I was … desperate. Because you were gone. And Sammy was really angry.“ He inhales, looks down, feels a bit ashamed of how easy he fell for this pattern. During all these years, he met so many people, saw so many things. Defeated – that's how he felt about Sammys little intervention and it all comes back to him right now. It wasn't his intention to feel bad, when he started this game. When he get up from the bonfire and after Cas. He fears to appear weak in Cas eyes now. But as soon as he dares to meet Cas eyes, he just sees his worrying, frowning, caring Cas. Cas, who just nods and says „I understand. Thank you for sharing. Are you better now?“
„Want a sandwich?“
He never did that to a man and when he thought about having sex with a man, he would have enjoyed more to be given the blowjob.
„Huh? Yeah. Yeah, that kid. Unbelievable. I guess I shouldn't say kid anymore. Where did you get this from?“
Cas' face brightens a bit. He opens his mouth, closes it, wanting to say something, but seemed to be too overwhelmed to actually do.
„Yeah, he is.“
Cas laughs but looks around, frowning until he meets Deans gaze.
„Did the Shadow appear?“
„You were happy. And now you are even more. Of course you won't sleep now, facing opportunities and possibilities. It's different know, because of him. I'm sick of it. You cannot keep breaking the rules.“ Its voice is like a knife, cutting the silence with a harsh tone. „And this is why you'll better make sure you'll never land here again.“ With another wave of the hand he releases Dean from the pain, who still just sees flirring auras of greyish light as if all his nerves have been firing at once. He thought he's going to pass out.
„Cas!?“
„If I was you I would grip him tight now, Winchester. Because I don't want you here with me.“ And as his voice echoed, Dean looks stunned, grabs Cas with both arms as the Shadow pushes them hard and they fall in a puddle of blackness that seemingly wasn't there before. The sensation familiar to both of them returns, pierces their lungs and entrails and suddenly they disappear.
As soon as they entered Deans room, they started undressing and kissing in between. Letting any ghosts, pasts and serious thoughts about everything that happened today stay outside. And both of them needed that right now. They crash on each other at the bed. Kissing feels different today. As if they share a rhythm, as if it fits even more than yesterday. Cas feels Deans kisses at his throat, his hard cock pressing against him and is amazed to feel that his presence causes this in Dean. Attraction, lust, love. He runs his fingers over Deans chest, his nipple and loins and simply enjoys every sensation. Freed of the haunting unanswered questions and maybe pushed with self-confidence in form of mojo, wings and decisions made, he gets an idea, rock-hard, and whispers „I'd like to try something.“
Dean chuckles. „It was
„And the Shadow didn't came. Obviously.“
Next weeks chapter will already be the last one. Time flies!
„You cannot disappoint me. And by the way I don't want to disappoint you either. Okay?“
„You.“ says Cas dryly. It strangely moves Dean. As if something in him breaks – or more as if something shifts in place. He observes everything he didn't allow himself before. A curl in Cas neck, that gives him the look of a male model in hair magazines. He obviously made him a hickey under his collarbone. Isn't it healing automatically? He remembers how Cas embraced him. So strong he never thought it would get to him so much and looks down a him, actually sees some bruises. Damn strong. And he remembers everything from last night, Every touch, every longing kiss.
He remembers how disoriented and strange he felt, when he returned and dug himself out of the dirt – well, after Cas brought him back. He should given him space to breathe, to arrive beneath the living. And what did he do? He kissed him. Nice. He feels like a coward, even if the thought makes him blush. Just thinking of that moment fades all the voices around him out and brings back the warmth of Cas lips, his gaze at that moment, stunned blue eyes. Dean feels as if he's glowing like a middle school girl.
„I know it, okay!? I know I've done wrong. I KNOW IT!“ he yells. „HOW CAN YOU JUDGE? HOW CAN YOU JUDGE IF YOU NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH ...“ Deal with what? He thinks to himself. An apocalypse or two are a valid excuse, or not? Or not. He could have lived. He could have make Cas live. He could have done better.
„Yeah, I would like to share the bed with you.“
„So you guessed it?“ asks Dean.
„I hope you vomit over yourself and all your room this night and that you are so disgusted of yourself tomorrow, that this finally ends, you asshat.“
That talk wasn't at all what Cas wanted to bring up. He was simply happy Dean came up with „forever“ on his own. And he explains it exactly like this, adding „Forever can be a concept. If you want to. But its' also a long time. Maybe we shouldn't talk about this right now.“
„Lying is sinful.“ says Cas dryly.
When Castiel confessed, he had a hard time to process what he was saying about the deal, the empty, about Dean and when he finally realized what Cas was telling him, he thought „Now it's finally happening“. And as fast as it happened, it was suddenly over. Cas gone, the chance missed, expectations and relief died instantly – all that's left nothing but regret. How much he hated himself for not getting it earlier, saying just anything. He looks at Cas, says „I love you“ once more. Cas smiles. „I love you, too.“
„Maybe“, Cas thinks, but doesn't say it out loud. He is not scared, he is just about to  experience in reality, what appeared as fiction only until now. And he hopes he can keep up with his own fictious self.
Cas smiles and walks a step towards Dean, whose smile shifts to a real one. Happy. „Ok,“ Dean goes on, „Do you … generally believe that sex is something you want for yourself? In a relationship?“
Dean looks at him more seriously now. Silence stretches until Cas says „I had the impression that it was somehow unnatural that I stayed in your room yesterday. The atmosphere seemeed to be a bit tense and I didn't want to push it to much.“ Dean gives him a surprised look.
„And you did nothing wrong. No, I, I just … I could have lost you. I … .“ he says with a leveled voice, still trying to avoid crying.
Sam has the time of his life and laughs tears looking at Cas worried expression and tries not to imagine how „the talk“ or „first step“ between these two idiots would look like and swallows a comment about „so sudden“ is not exactly what over ten years really are.
Cas tells him how he slowly recognized how much he felt for Dean. Especially when Dean told him that he is family or his best friend, he started to feel disappointed contrary to what he thought he should feel.
„Are you disappointed when we don't put us on display?“ Cas didn't seem to understand. „You know … holding hands, kissing in public, all that corny couple stuff for everyone to see."
„I have to proof to you that I know how to take a shower properly“ Dean smiles over the extremely serious look on Cas face and just says „Mhm. You better do.“
day.“ And just as Cas wants to say something, adds „I asked you not to leave me and all we had is
„Where's your car?“ asks Dean breathless.
„Cas left.“
„Come on, tell me.“
He notices how he is less and less capable to contain himself, to suppress moaning.
„What? You're looking good, let me look at you.“ And he rolls on top of Cas, their cocks touch and immediately a jolt pierces through them. Skin on skin. Their fingers entwined. They're eyes are locked at each others until Dean cradles Cas face, kisses him passionately and says „I want you. I want you so damn much. Let me make you feel good.“
Cas is struggling for words. This is one of the most beautiful and adorably helpless gestures of Dean ever. Even the awkwardness of him not being romantic at all somehow renders it romantic again just because of his nervous look. Cas feels like laughing and crying at the same time. But feels it so strongly, it hurts.
„Hunting or summoning the Empty. Something like that. Or summoning Cas back from the Empty if that's possible.“
.“ he says self-confident.
When hunting days and being on the road without a stop came back to mind, this soon to be apple pie life felt surreal. When Cas started to remember stories from centuries and long forgotten battlefields before, he was unsure if he fits in. Then the rooms would suddenly feel small, cramped and strange. Sometimes they talked about it, sometimes not. On some days they shared the sentiment, on others not really. Mostly a glance over their shoulder to what they called their man was sufficient to bring them back to the present. And after the living room started to feel like one, the bedroom had their scent and some of Deans horror movie BluRays were piling up next to the TV, it was finally their home.
„You already did.“
„Maybe. It doesn't matter so much to me anymore. If angel comes back and is also not on duty anymore.“ he laughs. „Maybe it's time.“
Sam leaves and lets the thought sink in. For Dean the hunter life always seemed to be the only way of living. At least that's what he said on one or the other occasion. Judging by that case with the Jinn and his time with Lisa, a part of Dean is up for the apple pie life. Probably now he has to make a choice. What isn't present to Sam is that the idea has already seasoned. He wasn't thinking much about cases anymore. So Dean just says dryly „And you?“
He is nearly overwhelmed by all of this and unable to speak. Just listening to and looking at the family, he somehow belonged to for a while, but just now really feels and fathoms.
The presence in front of him just smirks. „What else?“
Dean is completely silent.
„So, Jack?“ asks Cas and brings Dean back to reality from very different thoughts.
Case shakes his head again. He doesn't look pissed or sad or nervous.
„... yes?“
„Patience was never exactly his strong suit.“ says Sam.
„Dean?“ Cas shifts, tries to look at him.
„I'm not going to talk you into something, you know. Especially not know, because what you said is very true. For a change.“ Sam laughs frowning responding to Deans offensive smirk. „We have to take good care. But you have it in you. You know, the leader type, little brother.“ And pats his back, before his eyes again wander off to Cas. The darkness around them in high contrast to the bright fire nearly lets the bunker disappear. Has he ever seen Cas smile so often? So casually? So happy? So many moments are flashing through his mind. When he met him at the Gas'n'Sip, his expression that moment. What he said that day in the barn after the spear wounded him and he nearly died. When he tried to tell him again and again that he loved him. Or simply when they grew closer over time. So many years, Dean thinks, getting somewhat melancholy and sips at his cheap beer.
Cas nods. „And … yesterday that was … okay?“
Sam sits in the library, checking their hunters discord servers for any signs, sightings and possible cases as Dean enters the library. From Deans tense look and grinding jaw Sam immediately gets the hint .
He finds back to what he's doing, struggles with his tie, exhales and hurrys. Dean sees Cas naked chest appear after his shirt and undershirt are gone, his nipples, a tattoo in enochian, he smirks and thinks to himself „Right, my angelic boyfriend has a tattoo, I forgot.“
„Why what? Why 'why'?“
The Shadow gets ready to rumble and Dean needs to do it right this time - now it counts.
And so they went looking for a house. It didn't need to be a model house out of „modern living“. They both decided they could do all work needed at the house themselves.	As the estate agent asks for some identification, the problem of identity itself crosses Deans mind and he silently thinks „aw shit“. While Deans slate as well as Sams is clean again thanks to friends of friends in higher places (they allowed themselves this much cheating), Castiel is „no one“ concerning the public. Of course they still have fake IDs with names from pop culture. But that wouldn't be sufficient for building a life and not for their new, for year old reality.
Before leaving through the door, he looks at a blushing Cas and smiles, while Sam rants „Get over it.“ He signals Cas to follow him. Jody and Eileen volunteered to prepare some snacks for later – not without complaining that its the women again, who need to care about food.
Cas nods and adds silently „I don't have much experience, I don't want to disappoint you.“
Dean licks his lips, „Because?“

„Jobs? Wouldn't you like to resume your studies at Stanford?“
„I did. I enjoyed it. So much I'm scared.“
His back and neck muscles are a tense, wiry, net, hard as stone. Cas pauses and caresses him with one hand before he starts stroking his nearly not anymore hard cock, gripping Deans hips just with one hand.
One evening Cas is sitting at the terrace behind the house, he build on his own. Muddy and dirty from working in the garden, where he planted some trees and bushes. Dean came home from work and crashed next to him. Cas shirt was dirty, he was dirty. In his hand he was holding a small rake and swirled it around like he used to with an angel blade before he threw it down fast, where it stood like a flagpole out of the ground.
„Dean – what the hell!?“
And the pass is just to good and Sam laughs and says „Oh I believe Dean gets some ideas what the two of you could do with your time“ and he immediately hates himself for saying that. Just a part of him always thought that Dean and Cas figuring out sex with each other would have some delicate comic relief. Again silence walks next to him. Cas face is of a nice blush, he just shortly looks to Sam and immediately away.
„Mhm.“
„But … you created spells, plans, ideas. Or not?“
„I need a drink now.“ Dean says to Sam next to him. „I'm not asking for your permission here.“
„Okay, then it's Eileen and me I guess.“
„Bible camp, hm?“ Dean mumbles, glances over to him questioning as Cas responds his glance with a dead-serious expression. Then he cracks and smiles, wipes over his face and blushes a bit. Deans face – priceless.
At least at weekends he fully relaxed. From time to time he went alone, with Cas or with Sam and exercised a bit in shooting. They had date nights, they even went on vacation. They had their swim. They had christmas. And after a while the job became a necessary labor he didn't complain about much. But whenever they talked about good old times, he had a strange look on his face, that expressed „good old times“ and a notion of „freedom“.
„Where was Cas?“
Dean looks puzzled at the table, then back to Cas. The old man asks playfully „Or maybe buy something so beautiful?“ and winks jokingly.
„Shut up.“
They are making a fuss, asking him what happened and he is just overwhelmed and annoyed. To him it feels as if he was just away for maybe five to six hours, but not nearly two weeks. He isn't even really hungry. But maybe that's because of the sight of Cas rushing out after all he finally managed to tell him. And he sees through their scheme, they want to distract him. Bobby and Eileen throw question after question at him.
For a second he thinks his eyes are still closed until he looks down at him and sees his boots and his hands waving through the air. Not his eyes are closed, there is just really only sheer blackness around him. Even if he himself seems to be lit. In whatever direction he turns, he sees
„Very.“ he just says, briefly. Just one simply word, that sends a jolt through Deans chest.
„Huh.“
Cas gives him a puzzled look. „Then I go to my own heaven, I guess. But I won't set foot on earth again.“
(See the end of the chapter for
„A prayer to the Nothingness. It's supposed to open a passage.“
„I don't know – the Shadow made him appear.“
Dean lays next to him, facing each other. „So?“
Dean brushes hectically through his hair and exhales. He just feels tired and somehow empty. „For love.“
„Hey … look, I really want you to be happy. And like I already said, I'm happy for you. But I know Dean all my life and know he is not the easiest with feelings. I guess you noticed.“ He is typing something into his laptop, once in a while looks to Cas, who finally sighs and relaxes.
As the blackness spreads around him Deans heart is racing. His instincts are telling him to breath, to hold onto something, he is panicking and completely lost in evaulating what's happening around him. Is this what Cas felt, when he left? When he was ripped from him? An invisible force drags him away. Even if he was able to breathe, it felt as if he was drowning. His lungs, his entrails seemed to be folded and squeezed  – but without any pain. The bunker fades to black. And then it is over. The terrible sensation is gone and around him his only utter, deep blackness.
After a moment Dean snaps out of his hypnotic state, deeply inhales and says „Sooo … how was it? For you? Did you … did you like it?“
As he still wouldn't tell them, Sam and Dean expressed suggestions what that job could be.
„But I want to. I want to make you feel good.
That talk wasn't at all what Cas wanted to bring up. He was simply happy Dean came up with „forever“ on his own. And he explains it exactly like this, adding „Forever can be a concept. If you want to. But its' also a long time. Maybe we shouldn't talk about this right now.“
As they sat there and were joking, their hearts were overflowing. With the feeling to be finally home. To have made it. They sat in the kitchen, retelling storys from the past with their point of view, throwing some soft gazes at each other, observing the other mans reaction.
„Oh and just because some late bloomers like you appear and want their boyfriends back I just give them what they want!? That's not how it works. That's not the natural order.“
„And I have rusty people skills.“
Cas ends up in front of him, spreading his legs, gripping his hips, his erect cock between them, breathing noticeably, licks his lips and looks at Dean as if he is waiting for approval. Dean nods, thinks „what a sight“. Cas has a look on his face somewhere between puzzled and determined much to Deans amusement. He would laugh if he wouldn't feel so exposed.
„Well, you know I have not much reference. But ...“
Their gaze is still locked at each other, Cas mouth still openin awe, unable to respond. Dean doesn't dare to look away from him, then just says „Say something“.
Dean inhales and straightens his back, nodding. „Yeah. It's not feeling like that anymore. Like ...“ he is searching for words. The library is all silent, just the floor squeaking a bit, where Sammy moves.
„And you … are okay with that?“
„Do they know? Do they all know?“
For a second he feels silly and it remembers him of women doing that in porn. Now here he is. So he's going to get fucked tonight.
„Well … I didn't. The first minutes I though 'What did I get myself into'. But then it was really good. You were awesome. I never saw you like this … you know.“ he paused. „Wanting. Longing. This much. I mean … you were seducing, but you know that, right?“
„What?“
As some tears roll over his face, Castiel caresses Deans back, presses a kiss on his cheek and gently brushes through Deans hair. It moves him how vulnerable Dean suddenly looks.
Cas gives him a look, grinning the slightest bit.
Apparently he was so excited to have his wings back, that he completely forget the car, that's still parked near the heavens gate. Dean agreed to let Cas zap them to it and drive it back together after they cleaned themselves. They still had much to talk and tried to catch up while driving back with Castiels dodge. But the mood was seemingly odd judging by the uncomfortable silence between their talks about Jack, heaven, Castiels rebuilt powers and „building things in heaven“.
While deeply inhaling the air with it's smoky odor of approaching autumn, his chest raises and lowers and his frowning forehead eases. The sun left a deep, dry warmth on his face - the real sun. So warm and penetrating, he could nearly smell it. A hint of bricks, fuel and metal in the air – the bunker, the impala.
„You watch porn?“
„Yeah? Why where you collecting humans then? If they didn't belong here? Those guys from eastern europe or whatever? Bending the rules yourself, hm? What did you want with them and their dull tiny feelings?“
„Ah not much. I already told Cas, but seemingly, were low on cases.“
„Fine. Then go get me Cas.“
Dean went on with this for a while. To mark his path, he left shreds of a handkerchief due to the lack of nearly all his equipment in the bag. That only worked until the handkerchief was used up. Just to himself he even made jokes he would probably shred his flannel and shirt to mark the way. Maybe he would get a chippendale bonus, if that's what floats the Shadows boat. Then he mumbled he doesn't even know why he marked his way, there is nothing there anyway. Somehow he felt observed and stopped talking to himself. Maybe it was just an effect of the absence of every other sensation and a trick of the mind to create what's missing. Talking to himself was somehow consolidating. Silence on the other hand was just setting his nerves on edge.
Dean is so close. It was even easier to face the apocalypse or so it seems to him at that moment.
While Dean still showers, fully dressed Castiel roams through the bunker and finds Sam, who too is already awake. His face reddens and he asks himself if he should avoid him. Sam is a wise man, he'll look at him and sense what Dean and he did last night. But before he can get away, Sam sees him and says „Good morning, brother-in-law. Guess you didn't sleep much?“
At which Cas looks shyly down, smiles and exhales.
As they enter the bunker Dean looks at his dirty jeans and hands and decides to take a shower. He looks at Cas, who's the same and asks with a challenging expression „Wanna join?“
„Yes I am.“ says Dean and smiles even more. The sight of his weary smile is saddening and she tries to keep a stern facade.
„And what do you think is that?“
Half-naked he hobbles with cramps in the kitchen, comes back with a bottle of water and downs half of it, exhales loudly and says out of breath „So, now. Tell me.“
„I do? … I had no idea.“ says Cas. „Anything else I should know?“
Now that plans about a house became real, they started packing their stuff in cardboard boxes. Dean fantasized about barbecues with the guys from work. But first they had some long weeks and especially long after-work hours in front of them. Tired from painting or building, they sat at the front porch in the dim light of the evening or on their tiled kitchen floor with a beer. Around them shavings, tools, dust. They looked at the wood and concrete skeleton that soon would be their home and had a strange feeling. Unbelievably tired from work on one, happy on the next day, but on some it felt like pretending.
„I wouldn't do it otherwise. Relax.“
8 Bird of Prey * Editors
Dean snorts and turns around, so that he lays half on Cas again, their faces near each others.
„What?“
During dinner Sam gives them amused glances, Dean cannot overlook while Cas acts as he would like to be invisible. If Eileen asks him anything, he responds suspiciously monosyllabic while Deans smirking is nearly offensive. From time to time Sam tries to communicate with him mutely with vague facial expressions and gestures towards Cas, when he turns his back at them. It is like a pantomime that swallows every chance to a serious conversation. Eileen is thrilled to observe these sillies running in circles and finally bends slightly towards Cas, saying „I'm happy for you two.“
„Bonfire?“ asks Cas and looks to Dean, who smirks with a nice blush and meets his eyes, somehow boyish looking.
household. Well … it's not like you need to eat or sleep. I'm just making you eat … . Seriously try it if you want to. Just don't … loose any fingers. If they will grow back, it will be hard to explain.“
„I want to do this because it troubles me. I want tabula rasa. I want to … come to terms too. There are just to many things that … are how they are because it's history. And I don't understand that. Shouldn't we learn from history and do better?“ The shadow turns around and listens to the empty nothingness, that's just empty for others. To all the mumbling around him.
As they resume on the trail, Cas asks him about evening school and Dean shares his plans to catch up on school certificates. He never thought about this kind of future. Sitting on a beach with Sam and Cas in matching hawaiian shirts was more a wish. He shares the picture with Cas, who asks what a hawaiian shirt is and makes Dean snort.
„Yes, I am now.“
„Gosh … are you …? Are you the
Which isn't true. Some days ago he decided not to overthink and just let things happen between the two of them. The last time he was overthinking he nearly messed up.
He just feels so much suddenly. Feels Cas again, his skin under his fingertips. They start to share a rhythm and Cas caresses Deans thighs. This one simple touch is like a signal fire. Dean pushes gently in Cas, slightly faster and leans over him, gaze still locked at each other.
„Sweet is not exactly what I am.“
Cas takes the envelope and finds the ID with his photo and reads
And Cas does and pushes into him. Slightly faster, deeper, back and forth. Dean feels the physical arousel, the hard, warm organ in him, pumping and pushing, feels Cas hands, firm grip – one on his hip, the other at his hard cock, his thoughts are melting.
He inhales and then gives Sam some impressions, which are eerily graphic compared to what Dean told him earlier. The pure emptiness seems so hopeless and cold to him, he cannot fathom how it feels to be left alone in utter nothingness. What he suffered and lived through in the cage may seem similar and Sam relates to what Cas suffered more than ever. Sam rephrases and asks him how it feels to be back and as Cas shares all his thoughts and doubts if this can be real. Silently Sam eyes him, noticing they never talked this openly and shared so much. Been here, done that, their thoughts are alike, they lived through similar events. „And here we are“ thinks Sam. We had to catch up with some stuff, too.
Dean laughed and smirked and made witty jokes, but Cas felt how tense he was. It's as if a persons muscles, emotions, fear and insecurities could induce a smell. It was invisible, but must be noticed and can be resisted. When he met Dean and started living under humans, he had a hard time to distinguish all these sensible, different emotions, that appeared like nearly indistinguishable shades of
(See the end of the chapter for
„Idjit. Of course I know.“
„What?“ asks Cas, suddenly slightly insecure.
helped.“
„I haven't given that enough thought.“
„With summoning the Empty?? No. Not at all. I thought he would walk into his sure death. But what else should we ...“
Though Sam felt like the small brother again and it had a notion he tried to avoid, he couldn't really say no. Dean made him promise, that he would pay back as soon as he is a famous lawyer or something like that.
They get faster. They nearly kiss as if they would like to bite and eat each other alive. Even their teeth meet painfully and with a hurting sound.
being an angel of the lord? Is he needed? The feeling of duty kicks in again, but he also has to admit, that he truely feels like this life ended. If he looks into the future, he sees Dean. But he doesn't see much more, which somehow appears troubling. Maybe he was just too distracted from apocalypses to think about what he wants from life besides being with Dean.
„At the beginning I noticed that you didn't like it at all.“
They part as Dean holds his jaw. „Oh boy.“ Dean exhales. „I hadn't this for a long while. Maybe never. Isn't lust a sin, angel?“
„So Jack did all this?“ says Dean looking around impressed and then at Bobby.
Cas is too puzzled to respond anything. „Here you got PB&J, I don't know what else you like. Or liked. What do you like?“ he asks.
„No, no .. I'm not sad“ he says, laughing and breathing heavily.
As Sam opened the door of his room and rushed near him, Dean already held bloody shards in his hands and bend awkwardly over on shaky feet.
„I hope so … .“
Dean.
. But as Cas suggests to take some vacation and visit Sam, Eileen and the kids or to invite them over for some days, he knows. Cas notices the anger and just before they visit he looks at him, touches him at his neck, draws him closer and says „But it has been a good life, hasn't it?“
„Having a relationship with someone who appears as a man – is that a problem for you?“ This evening is going to be really challenging. Cas hears his heart racing.
And as Deans gaze searches for the Shadow around them, he comes across himself and Cas with scrubs under his trench, toweling some dishes. Just that there is no cabin, no surrounding, just blackness and the two of them. Again he has to look at himself and how he treated Cas, who looks so soft, so troubled. He remembers that one too well. Angrily this Dean projection shouts „Nobody cares that you're broken!“ And after this something about cleaning up his mess.
They were sitting in the kitchen as she pulled an old pergament in an air-proof, transparent cover from the envelope. „It's called the manifest of sleepers. It's a relatively small cult, that was active between the world wars in eastern europe. Researcher believe the lore itself is much older actually. They worshipped … do you want to guess what?“
Cas looks at him, he still is breathing hard. And he is hard.
No answer. Jack smiles and goes on. „I'm glad you did. I wanted to talk to you for a while now and I could neither be here nor summon you.“
How can he always be better than everyone else? How can he be like this? Why does he always seem to know what to say? When to treat him like this and melt something in him?
While Dean was driving and searching for a diner, both of them were strangely smirking and didn't exactly know what to say. Deans heart was racing and he glanced over to Cas every 5 minutes, who too still was smiling. „Like teenagers“ he thought and grinned even more. It finally started to taste like a happy-end.
It just needs the word „inside“ to turn Dean on again.
Dean applied for a job as a security professional and made it. First he was working in building security and had mostly night shifts. Nevertheless he felt better off and had the feeling to do something thrilling – at least sometimes. It remembered him of plotting plans against invisible threats. Of hunting. Dark corridors, paying attention, observing and waiting. "No event" meant a shift, but maybe a boring workday. Similar to his hunting days. After some incidents he seemingly handled well he moved to personal security. The strange shifts are something he never missed. And after some months he was even promoted and was responsible for a small team. He may wasn't anymore one half of the "legendary Winchester brothers", but supervising and strategic decisions partly gave him his old self back and he found some peace with worklife even if stories about killing Hitler were still a good story on parties with old hunting buddies, sometimes more an insider joke.
No Cas in the kitchen. What a nice game of anticipation, he thinks. Though the corridors seemed colder as he entered the kitchen and didn't found him immediately. Dean calls him, wents into the war room, the corridor to their bedrooms and finally finds him leaning at the wall between his and Sams room. Cas sees him, looks down, smiles and says „After noticing that there is no salsa, I thought this is probably where you'll find me.“
seems surprising to me.“
„But then why?“ asks Cas.
Cas doesn't seem to mind, he was alone with his insecurity. Then he noticed a teller, who curiously looks at them, when they casually stand close next to each other watching the photos Sam and Eileen sent on Deans phone. Suddenly something in him shifts. Maybe they don't need to put it on display. Maybe they just were.
Dean crawls over Cas in his shorts and crashes on him. His arms entwined on Cas naked chest, he asks „Too heavy?“
Cas clearly doesn't and his face darkens a bit in disappointment.
„That's a shame.“ He may had a glass to much after dinner.
Dean looks, it's his Zepp Traxx Mixtape.His gift. The sight and gesture hits him. Immeditaley he feels his cheeks getting warm and clears his throat. „Ah, no, right, there's no tape deck in this car. Sorry.“
„You look happy.“
It felt a bit surreal. Yesterday he was silently complaining that he couldn't exactly picture it, the two of them, doing it. It seemed nearly too easy now. Like a perfect movie moment or like the two of them knew exactly what they were going to do.
„I don't understand. Why did the wealthy korean couple never recognized the safe room in their house? Do they really never go in the cellar?“
. Did he always smell like this? He touches his hair. Had he ever? As the thought crosses his mind, he starts to crack. Tears are running down his cheeks.
He outstretches and embraces him, they kiss, gently and slowly. He whispers in Cas ear that he waited for this all the way back to the bunker.
There is a free table right behind their person of interest and so they decide to head there as the stranger panics and calls a waitress to pay. As Dean passes, he gets an idea, turns and says „Sorry, we were mistaking you for someone we know, we didn't intend to frighten you. We good?“

It waits for Dean to react but he just looks at it, muted, teary eyes. He thinks to himself „Come on, Dean, come up with anything … anything.“
„Damn. Feels like a fucking romcom, guys. Cool down“  he wipes his mouth with a paper towel, crunches it in his fist and drops it to the table.
sleep? I thought you don't.“ asks Dean.
As Dean opens his eyes, he blinks and sees a calm Cas, who appears as if he's sleeping, but he most likely is not. He looks at his alarm clock. Hours passed, they are near sunrise, but it would be an exaggeration to call it 'morning'. He gets up a bit, not knowing how or if to „wake up“ Cas. He looks so peaceful. Does he even know how beautiful he is? Dean looks at his lips. Lips he finally got to taste yesterday. And he tries to kiss him, shortly before their lips touch, Cas opens his eyes, they stop, kiss nevertheless and laugh in between.
Their hands are tightly trailing over their backs, their necks, their chest. He feels Cas hand on his hunter tattoo, moving slowly and tenderly down to his loin, warm and suddenly trembling.
Deans expression shifts from angry to desperate and tears are welling up his eyes. His pulse is pumping and he feels a headache rising, his cheeks feel displeasingly warm.
Making Cas blush is his new fetish and he teases him „Dude, you did it so good to me, my knees are still weak.“
Dean pauses, looks around him and says more dryly than he intended to „Ah, I forgot. You'll probably survive me, hm?“
„Just … just give me a minute.“ And he sees something break in Deans eyes. Cas touches his back gently to give him at least something. „Just a minute“ he whispers and asks himself „Is this real? Because if it is real … .“
„No?“
„SHUT UP.“ It shouts, face distorted to an angry grimace. It startles Dean to see his own face this way. Then it disappears from one second to the next.
The brothers embrace and look strangely and speechless at each other. Their shared looks seem to say „It could have gone wrong“ and „good that it didn't“.
„Guess you deserve it. But … you know.“
Shit, he had no idea Cas was so good at non-dirty dirty talking and is pretty sure Cas doesn't know. Dean runs his wet fingertips over Cas body, both are already on edge again. Dean gives him eyes, that seem to say he wants to resume where they stopped of last night.
No, not a man. Cas.
„Of course. There is also a garden behind the estate … you and your partner will love it!“
„Yeah, now I can finally stop dissecting your feelings with you. You can just do your thing now and finally be happy.“ Sam exclaims with relief.
His voice sounded somehow unfamiliar. A bit more silent, but echoing with a strange undertone. Dull as if every emotion was stripped from it. Or more likely as if the Empty swallowed it? He called till his throat was coarse and already lost his sense of time. He would have guessed he's wandering around for at least three hours, but it also could be thirty minutes, he wouldn't know. First he started panicking. Fruitless undertaking. Stupid plan. He came this far – is this all? There must be something. Then heat and anger spread in his chest. Now that he is here, he would do everything. And if he could neither find Cas nor get any clues on how the Empty works, he would do the exact opposite. He would make sure, that something finds him.
„Well …
But he can't. He can't even think of anything else. He is happy to see them all again – their happy faces, enthusiasticly stuffing him with pasta and questions. Someone says something about a bonfire to celebrate. But he simply cannot just sit here. And after munching some pasta, being taciturn about how the Shadow looked, about what he did to wake Cas and if he wasn't hungry or thirsty, he suddenly stands up, swallows and says „Very good. Very good pasta. But you know what, I'll just, I look for Cas, okay?“ and storms out of the room.
„Which household!? Oh
„I know, I know“ says Dean, feeling the cool wall and exhales tiredly. Maybe he has done too much, maybe too less, he may said he knows, but feels like he knows less than nothing. Right now he just feels stupid and would simply like to vanish. Bobby pats his back and says „Let's go grab something to eat. It will be okay.“
As Dean enters his room after dinner, he finds no Cas. He sneaked away when Dean was arguing with Sam who repeatedly embarassed everyone with tales from Deans emotional struggles, first dates, strange bromancy-situations with Cas and as Sam says that he always predicted that „Destiel“ is going to happen, Dean has enough and bails while Eileen has the time of her life. As soon as Dean was out of the room, he even heard Sam saying „Do you ship 'Destiel'?“
Dean draws him closer and puts some kisses at the delicate place under Cas' ear, at his throat and rests his head against Cas.
„Oh my god, it's happening“. Dean isn't sure if he said it loud or if it was only in his head.
Then it hits them. The pitch in the voice. Not as annoying as in the Empty, but still familar. „I thought you probably know me. Because I don't do.“ And the person laughs nervously. Both Cas and Dean are speechless, just staring.
„Because it reminds me of last night.“
„It's okay. Everything is okay. We are here now. Everything is allright.“ he says, caresses Deans face and hugs him again, holds him as close as he can.
„I want to rest. Just … close it up. Take them away.“ And it makes a gesture as if it could brush it all away with its hands.
So he takes one of Cas' hands and sucks at his fingers, licks them, takes them in his mouth.
Cas grins and nods. „It was really good.“ he says and both laugh wholeheartedly.
Dean wakes up nearly explosively with a loud snore and suddenly shifts his head. He finds himself laying half next to, half on Cas' torso, one arm around him, one of Cas arms around his loin. Deans drool was dripping on Cas bare chest and left small, white, half dried traces. As far as Dean can see in the sparse light Cas eyes are closed and he looks peaceful. Maybe he meditates, thinks Dean still sleepy and dizzy. They're still naked and he looks up and down at them. „Ow my“ he whispers, licks his lips and mouthes the words „it happened, it really happened.“
„Not sure … I … I think I need to get out. Just to take a breath outside.“
„I … am, I am going to change.“ Gesturing at the dirty trench. „Guess I put it in the washing machine directly.“
Dean smiles softly, „Uuuh, that's … . That's hot. It really is, ...“ he stares at Cas' mouth, images are flashing through his mind instantly, he hesitates. „But maybe … .“
„That's some mean trick, you know.“ says Dean. He clearly doesn't want to talk and avoids looking at Cas. „I don't have a choice to escape this discussion?“ he asks, muscles in his jaw grinding.
„I mean … what would you like? How would like us to be in public?“
That this cannot feel good for Cas and he's doing it wrong. Doubts are torturing him and he avoids looking at Cas, thinking that he surely senses that something is wrong.
On his desk he finds the old mans business card next to a photo of Sam, Dean, Cas and Jack, next to the Led Zepp mixtape, an apple from the grocery store and a book Dean never heard off. Has that been in the bunker the whole time? „Tous les hommes sont mortels“? What is it even? At a coat hanger at the wall hangs his trench, over the chair his blue tie.
„Enochian?“ asked Dean.
„I could give you what you want.“
forever. Forever
„I don't know … I … don't know myself like this.“
He underestimated him.
And he wants to hear his sounds, wants to see his face in arousel. Then looks to Cas again, rushed, worried, „If you don't like it, I'll stop.“
„Anyways … guess what. They disappeared. All of them. Some people were searching for them and there are some historical papers and sources mainly collected by the research institute that focuses on cults and sects. And because I could exchange some information and some contacts helped me gather what they needed, the institute gave me something that we need.“
„You are very careful with me.“ says Cas a bit driley.
„You could have said that you stabbed me right in the heart as we first met.“ says Cas, frowning and smiling as they walk down the bunkers staircase. „That's a story that sticks, I suppose.“
„What did you do?“
Dean laughed dryly. „It says he is the angel of tears and temperance. Yeah, maybe it
„The car. You left with a car.“
„No, I don't think so. But it's somehow familar, I cannot sort it into … anything.“
„What do you mean?“
„Oh, yeah!? Joking, hm? That's new.“ and grins. „May I come in?“
„So … now that you got your wings back, everything back to normal, hm?“
„I don't owe you an explanation.“ A familar voice echoes behind him, but with the same annoying undertone. Dean turns his back and feels as if his hearts skips a beat as he sees the shadow-version of Cas. Surreal – the familiar face, the grotesque situation. Hands in his trenchs pockets, facial expression somewhere between angry and smug. He never saw the real Cas like this. But he knew the expression. It was like a childs. A huffed childs. As if to be certain, he looks forth and back between the shadow and Cas. Cas expressionless, but peaceful face. And over there this
Would Led Zeppelins "Kashmir" cover the feeling of Dean walking into The Empty? Mmmmh ...
Cas smiles softly and says „Odd. Everytime I come back I feel more and more disconnected. I … I don't know.“ He inhales. „It wasn't because of you. That I had to leave. I'm better now.“
„Yeah. That's the first thing I bought after we decided to find out how to summon the Empty.“
„How is it going to be? Did you saw Jack? Will you be taking orders from him?“
He hated it, when someone asked him what's on his mind. The idea, that someone wants to look into his head, he resents it. He liked to keep his thoughts to himself, most of all his feelings. Now he could understand „What's on you mind“ very well.
„Oh come on“ says Deans shadow. „You and your holy, tiny, little human feelings. I know them very well. Knew them for ages. It's the same dull carousel everytime. I cannot HEAR IT ANYMORE.“ Suddenly agitated the Shadows explodes and Dean gets the impression he hit something.
Dean finally gets a taste for vacation and says „Let's go for a swim some day. Can you swim?“ to which Cas nods „I believe so … I'm not sure“.
Dean laughs nervously „Well, so then Mr Winchester …“ and smirks awkwardly before they kiss. Usually they like to share a nice comfortable bed and wore oneself out just with their actions. But this time they fucked each other right in the library and complained later about their hurting muscles and bones. Or at least Dean did.
Cas notices and swallows his own embarassment. This is a side of Dean Winchester he for sure doesn't let anyone see so easily and feels in a strange way as if they have a secret pact, something they don't share with anyone. He for sure won't. And so he kisses him and invites him with his tongue, not knowing that he wipes away Deans doubts. Deans „what am I doing here“. Doubts about learning stuff from porn, not knowing if it does anything for Cas. It disappears, they're in a safe place, nothing is wrong.
„If I knew all these years that you are so good in bed … we could have such a good time. What a shame.“ and looks up at Cas,  who blushes to a significant extent.
„I stopped the car.“
And I'd be happy to talk to you in the comments, if you leave kudos or share your thoughts with me.
„You know … I'm not going to eat you alive. You don't need to go as far away from me as you can.“ says Dean, while Cas smiles and shakes his head in abscence of any words.
„And you?“ asks Cas. Seeing Cas form a life, habits and interests, Dean suddenly feels more motivated to look for a regular job. This is building a life. And his boyfriend is obviously going to be a carpenter. Damn now he has to think about fucking Cas on a massiv dining room table, shaped by his own hands.
„I'd like to be inside you?“
Dean dozed off. As Cas looks at the ceiling, he gets a strange feeling as if he is looking at himself. He feels different. Is that him? Wanting and wanting. It's unusual to him. He himself feels unusual. He has never been this aware of this body. It's like he could feel
Some days later he picks up the parcel from the post office after work and gets tense. As he arrives at home, he is relatively muted and Cas notices it. It isn't the „I had a shitty day“ tension, but he also knows, that it isn't always sufficient to ask Dean probing questions. After dinner they sit in the library, Cas goes through some housing brochures to get ideas which furniture would fit the house as Dean clears his throat and slips something over the table between their armchairs.
The brothers looked at each other. „Not bad. You found yourself a market.“ Dean sighed, „He's doing better than us. What's with our skills? We should get us ourselves some jobs were we could hunt and kill things.“
„I'm tired.“
What's left in the Empty is the Shadow, still as Dean. Near it a small, greyish spot pulsates at the exact location, where Dean and Cas disappeared. The figure watches the spot and cocks it head.
„That's the rules, Dean.“
„Dean? Are you okay?“
During their stay at the diner, they felt like the ghost of christmas past left and they were waiting for the next one to appear. It was eerie and haunting. Despite Cas being sure that everything is alright, Dean fell into hunter mode. Observing the people in the diner, his senses aware of everything and everyone, not in a mode to chit-chat. During their drive back home he said „So what? The Shadow wanted to be human after all?“
„It's hard. To say it, I mean. Isn't it?“
There it is again - wiping his face to cover his embarassment.
„Believe me, I come back as fast as I can. I want to.“
„Cas … I never had something like this with anyone. It was a frenzy, a fuck-fest, but it was also meaningful. I believe that. It wasn't just nameless faceless shit, man. I know it's not charming, but I've been there, I had that - insignificant shit I mean. And you were awesome. And I love you. Okay?“
„What? Hunters report? Plural?“
„That weren't the first and maybe not the last bodily fluids we're exchanging, I guess.“
Dean nods, „Oh, the other thing.“
This was actually my least favourite chapter ^^'' Except the part between Dean and Cas. It's hard to say why. Maybe because I think it would be implausible if Cas and Dean happily jump on each other and forget that Cas died and in what a dark place Dean was the recent months. Guess you cannot ignore that!? But it's not so much fun to write how they leave each other again - even if it's just for a short break.
Dean stands up and moves towards Cas, who takes the ring. A simple, silver ring without any ornament, but immediately a token that makes him understand the emotional value.
„Oh“ Dean thinks and says „Buuut you did just minutes ago.“ Raises his eyebrows, smiles nervously, knowing exactly what Cas wants to say, but had no idea that this would be what Cas wants. On the other hand why wouldn't he?
„Try me.“ Sams expression is like stone. He is angry. So angry he hears his blood rushing through his veins. But anger is usually Deans thing. He doesn't like it like this. He doesn't like Dean like this. He should be happy. And he doesn't like himself like this. It should be easier. After all they went through, he was hoping Dean would come to him on his own. They are over thirty and forty years old, they should be able to manage.
Dean draws away and puts his forehead against Cas', closes his eyes and mumbles „I'm so sorry. I was always waiting for the next apocalypse to be over. And I was afraid. I never had this in perspective. I never thought of myself as in love with a man. I told myself you are a friend. My best friend. I told myself you are not feeling it. You are not capable to love this way.  Or I said to myself It's okay to be just what we are. Just so I didn't had to deal with these feelings. I was stupid. I love you, I do. I did for a long time. I just wish … if I have one wish in this world, I wish you knew. Even if you may found happiness. I just wish you could hear it yourself one time. One frickin time. That I love you, Cas.“
They fall silent for a minute before Dean kisses Cas, looks at him and says "So, forever."
Is it failing? Where did it went wrong?
„For you this is like going home, right? But staying with me forever … does this imply resigning? What exactly would happen?“
To Dean it tastes … indefinable. Warm. Flesh-y somehow? Salty?
Cas looks down, silent. As he wouldn't speak, Dean slowly crawls to him on the bed, still exhausted and feeling at least ten years older as he actually is.
Dean isn't ready to not ignore him. He has no idea what to do, but he looks at this copy and says with not much anger or hope left with leveled voice „Tell me … what would you do?“
„Cas!? Cas can you hear me?“ he repeats and repeats, looks nervously to the other "Dean" that just observes them. First, he pats his cheeks gently, calling him again and again. His voice starts to sound more desperate, then he smacks him right and left while saying „Please please please, Cas, come on! Wake up!“
The nervous bulk in him, that seemed to make him trip, the warmth in his chest, the fluttering in his stomach, the dry tongue, the audible swallowing. Even if he tried hard, he couldn't ignore how nervous he was, when he left his room and how happy he was when he found Cas. Maybe scrolling through a book in the library. Sometimes he found him sitting in the kitchen. One time he was searching for a freebie in the cereals package. At the exact same spot where Dean was sitting right now.
Realizing his panicking, he closes his eyes and inhales deeply. What was always missing in the dreams the Empty gave him? They always felt
One evening the brothers were sitting in the library, they had a good talk about what they want from life, what they are hoping how life will be and what they plan.
He moves his hands gently over Cas back, down to his ass, to his crotch, strokes Cas' hard cock, who suddenly puts his forehead on Deans shoulder and hides his face with his palm like a child who hopes not to be seen while doing something forbidden.
„Oh that wouldn't have happened.“ laughing as if it mocks Dean.
The two of them dissect what Castiel tastes and likes to eat, what tastes more like molecules and they look at the landscape. It's silent, they nearly just hear leaves rustling, falling and wind rushing through the foliage. As they eat, Deans looks around and says „You know … all those happy hikers and campers are now safe from werewolves and stuff.“
Maybe Cas watched porn. Maybe Dean gets nervous too. Maybe there is more honest talk. Maybe there is also a bit plot. For sure this fic comes to an end.
They are moving farther away from the bunker. Wood is crackling under their shoes, the near sunset heaven and light throws peculiar shadows on the ground.
Cas leans on his chest, studys his face, his blue eyes close to Deans and says „I never felt like this before.“
Dean exclaimes. „Great.“
„Left.“ And he makes Cas go back to one of the pillars, determined and gets on his knees. Cas gets the idea what's going to happen as Dean unbuckles his belt. If he wasn't so surprised, he would stop him. To cope an argument like that with sex would have seemed wrong to him. But he was too overwhelmed.
„So?“
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean adds in, they kiss hungryly, nearly violently and suddenly Cas presses Dean against the shower cabins tiled wall.
Dean could have known, but he didn't pay much attention. Every sting and this strange weight on his chest were to him just signs of „getting old“. But the doctor tells him his heart and the results from all tests look more like that from a way older man. When he asks him, if he had a lot of stress and asks what his profession is, if he was doing hard labor or was under lot  of pressure for a longer time, it's sounds like a cosmic joke to Dean.
Dean enters thewar room, walking light-fooded, exclaiming with untamable joy „Look who I got here. The two people in the world I love most“ with a goofy, wide grin on his face.
„I don't know myself like this.“
„But the neighbors.“
„But I can be a dick. Just so you know.“
„Are cats allowed?“ Dean smirkd and had to look away from Cas' ultra serious face to not burst out in laughter.
But then Dean slips a ring over the table with a gravely serious face.
„We ask each other questions. About us. To clear the air. To get … I don't know. To get
Some minutes later Dean lays half on Cas, who tenderly carresses his back and puts a kiss on his forehead. He gets up, props on one elbow. Cas observes his movements, the muscles working under his skin.
„Yeah, I know.“ Dean swallows noticeably. „I'm sorry, ok?“
Cas touches his shoulder and Dean feels weaker than he likes. „Don't push me away. Not after last night. Not after just
Sam pauses, looks to him.
Eileen tells them how Donna and Jody were apparently sending some funny messages about a good-looking uber driver to Eileen after leaving. But then accidentally switched to a group chat with several other hunters and now Donna has a date with a hunter instead.
To notice it is one thing, to name it another. Knowing himself so less felt like a punishment, like waking-up and realizing that his existence was lacking something fundamental. It was easy to declare it as an unwanted side effect of sticking around humans. Over time he noticed, that it was depending much on Dean. Of course on Sam too. But with Dean it was different.
„You are not running away from me, so it wasn't that bad, huh?“
„That's a heavy burden.“ Cas exhales.
„No. Not without you.“ he looks to the Shadow, then back to Cas, determined. „Did you … did you hear anything? You didn't, did you?“
Cas hesitates as they sit down and observe the figure rushing away outside the diner, heading for the bus stop. „No … I don't think so.“
„That you helped me try this one last stupid plan.“
„It gnaws at my conscience.“ she says.
To which Dean responds „Hell, yes!“ and finally smiles again.
„It was intense.“
Cas laughs, wipes again with his hand over his mouth expecting something. Dean never noticed this gesture before. It was a nice surprise. Is this Cas being nervous?
„No.“ He hesitates. „Maybe it hurt a bit, but it was a good pain.“
And Cas kisses it, starting to heal it, which remembers Dean „ Why isn't that healing?“ and touches the hickey.
The morning passes with cleaning, tidying up and a lot of chatting and exchanging stories until Donna and Jody arrive and Bobby gets his things, ready to leave. They say goodbye to each other and Dean gives a short speech how much it means to him, that they all spent the evening and that they all were willing to do shifts while he was in the Empty, Cas and Sam chime in.
Warm lips on his. The scent of Dean. The
Cas and Dean let go of each other, Dean turns for a second to collect himself before he faces them. „How long have I been gone?“
So lessons learned ... don't compare too much, try to be positive and learn from others. At least that's what I learned. Check out SaltyWords/agent4hire22 fic - great author as well as artist!
„City of angels?“
Cas rolls back on his side, looking at Dean and nodding. They go on, talking about what Cas saw in heaven and his impressions. Lying there naked with his boyfriend, talking about weird shit, it appears somehow free and decadent as well. He eyes Cas, his hands, his body, bringing back to memory what they just did as Cas stops talking and looks at him.
„Tell you what?“
„Dean ...“ tears are welling up his eyes. Suddenly the Shadow appears next to them, still as Dean.
Dean offered Cas the rest of the water, who declined and then downed it himself. They showered and ate a small breakfast, during which they decided afterwards that this will be the day of the „experiment“.
„And this is why you are really just
Cas smiles, looks down and back to him with tears in his eyes, just nodding. "Yes. You too."
Dean choked on his food, coughing, while Cas says with a shocked expression on his face „He was? I had no idea.“ while patting Deans back.
They start with a shy kiss, teasing each other just with their lower lips.

„No. I think we have a lot to catch up.“
„Sorry ...“ Sam says. „That was too much. I don't want to overstep borders here.“
They finally were simply confident and content, that for once and finally, everything will just sort out on its own. And they can just simply be free.
But to Dean nothing is cute right now. „Look, just wait. It seemed like you're on the same page. If so, he knows what he's doing. Are you two on the same page?“
The same day he was still hyped about Cas and saw him with somewhat different eyes when they lay in bed. They were now together for over a year, but he never stopped surprising him. Cas lays on him, they were resting and relaxing. Dean looks down at Cas back, the muscles, his body calm and in a near-sleep-like-state. Dean strokes gently over Cas back. As he rests his hand in Cas neck, he looks up to him and Dean kisses him. Nice and sweet. Then grips him and switched so that he lays on top of Cas and starts kissing him. Wanders down to his throat and gets more passionate. He started biting and sucking him.
Afterwards he circles the furniture with an equally mesmerized look on his face.
Hope you like the update. :) I'd be happy to talk to you in the comment section.
„What game?“
They are so close, Cas just nods and Dean pushes in him harder and faster as to his relieve he feels Cas cock throb too.
„I'm right, aren't I? Shit, why didn't you say anything?“
It's just so few traces of a „being“, but it somehow looks so „Cas“. And somehow it stings. Especially the tie, the trench. Why did he never encouraged Cas to make himself comfortable here before? Dean thinks he'll definetily get the award for „worst boyfriend“ ever. And before that „worst friend“ ever. A frowning and a sad look spreads in his face. He remembers when he tried to persuade and blackmail death into killing Cas. Cas! How he said to him, that nobody cared that he's broken. It's just that he cared, thinks Dean. But he also starts hinking, that he should have cared more. He's dwelling on his failures.
Dean falls silent, Cas leans over and presses a kiss on Deans cheek. Who then breaks a bit, his voice shaky. „You are too good for me. You are forgiving, where it's not forgivable. And you're selfless as ... fuck.“
As you maybe already noticed I happily ignore the fact that Deans room is probably not that huge. But one of the biggest troubles with this chapter was actually the question: Did Cas ever met Donna? I don't think so, but I was unsure. Couldn't find any information on that, so here we are ... . Donnas positives vibes meeting Cas - IMHO it would have been awesome!
„Cas … let's just say, one could see in your eyes that Dean means the world to you.“
Dean stares at her, muted. Her scrutinizing undertone, her worried, examining look tells him, that she doubts he is able to say that he loves Cas. After she sees that Dean understood, she adds „This time it counts. And you want it right? Please don't make it a suicide mission.“
And as Cas lays one of Deans legs over his shoulders and again seemingly looks at Dean for approval, he just exclaims „Oh god, do it to me already.“
Humans were always a surprise. Moods changed from second to second. Nearly every word could induce a shift, could hurt. But he was able to read most of Deans pretty soon pretty good. And soon the capability to feel became for him the equivalent of being alive. And humans seemed to be so much more alive than he and all his fellows. And then he was so much more alive than he has ever been.
„The Empty?“ said Dean.
„And this is why you grill babys battery?“ Deans fake everything-is-alright-attitude fades and he seems agitated.
„I don't like it. It sounds too easy anyway.“ says Sam and exhales restlessly. „Are you sure about it? Last chance.“
Cas negates in a very down-to-earth and friendly way and Dean grins while observing how he talks himself out of the situation.
The Shadow shrugs „Tis all?“
He lowers to Cas under him and whispers in his ear „So then fuck me.“
„No. I … I cannot imagine you as something different. I just … I just don't want you to be disappointed if we don't act like others. I'm not an overtly touchy-feely-guy... .“
His fingers wander through Cas' dark hair. He does all the good stuff. All that Dean did to him yesterday and more. As if it's forbidden he just takes glimpses at Cas in front of him and how he caresses, licks and sucks. The sounds of Cas mouth are driving him crazy, adding to the arousel. To hold it a bit longer he has to close his eyes, tilt his head back agains the cool, tiled wall or watches the ceiling.
Kisses, touching, feeling him, feeling to be wanted. Sometimes he freezes, just looking at him, closes his eyes, asks himself if Dean will still be there, when he opens them.
Whatever Cas now regretted or what troubled his mind, sharing it seemed to made it easier. And to Dean it felt again and again as if a fucking wonder is sitting on his porch. One that from time to time was more or less comfortable with being or appearing human.
He watches him mesmerized and feels Deans sweaty hand as he fumbles a second ring from his pocket, Cas takes it and puts it vice versa on Deans ring finger while they look at each other.
„Don't you see? I'm trying to make a hickey here … at least one.“
„Am I that obvious!?“ Dean says, annoyed.
He looks at Cas and smiles. „And you?“ asks Dean.
After a while he joins Dean in the kitchen and observes him cooking. Dean is in an impossible happy mood, but looks incredibly tired. He lets him cut some cheese and onions and jokes.
„Give me some days and date nights with you and after that I guess I'm ready to find me an old gramps who wants to employ me too“, he grins.
Castiel caresses his side, which tickles and finally Dean relaxes.
„I'd like to do to you what you did to me yesterday.“
Cas looks confused. „I … what?“
He feels a warmth spread in his chest, feels nervous, thoughts rush through his head. „He wouldn't want us to walk around like brothers, would he? That's impossible after all ...“
„So what … it made you
„No.“
„Yeah.“
Booby sighs and Sam and Eileen look frowning and smiling at each other.
Somehow he felt accustomed to hunting. Even to being a leader or as whatever the hunters from apocalypse world saw him. It just seemed to him that everything leads back to the beginning again and again. Running in circles. They should be ready to live a life. He canceled the date with Eileen to be there if Dean needs him. Or simply not to rub his nose on how Sam and Eileen are happily together. What if Dean never recovers from it? Cas was in fact his longest relationship.
„Yes, but, let's give him some more days. Let him enjoy his peachy mood and stuff, okay?“
„You've been awesome.“ Cas tries but cannot suppress grinning and looks content.
„... what you wanted to say?“
Bobby nods and looks knowingly at Dean. „And to stay, huh?“
He has no idea where to put his hands. When to kiss him. But until now nothing seems to be wrong.
And after a moment he added „I thought I'm not made for that.“
The whole part about rescuing Cas from the Empty was maybe a bit too fast and even to easy. At least that's what I think now and this is why I asked for your feedback. While I'm still a fan of the idea, that there is much more to the Shadow than depicted in the show, but my whole misery was comparing. After I wrote half of my fic, I read the unbelievingly beautiful fic
„And that's that“ Eileen just states and shrugs.
„For example that time I tried to get you killed when you were playing god. Or generally all the years I ...“ his voice broke. He just looks straight through the front shield, swallows and seemingly isn't able or doesn't want to meet Cas' eyes. The look on his face is stern.
. As normal as it could be for people like them. Meeting, being amazed by each other, seeing each other again. Yeah, well, okay. Loosing each other once. Maybe that wasn't so different from Dean and Cas. Just in their case it seemed to be so much more ... what?
Suddenly he desired a cabin. Somewhere in the woods. Woods, that are safer now. A cabin they probably would build mainly on their own. A cabin where nobody would question the angel, appearing and disappearing once in a while. But always coming home every day. Coming home to him. Suddenly he knew it all. It felt like „prospects“. It felt like something he could never fully grasp. Could never see it for himself in the past. He could even smell the barbecue he would prepare and see Sam and Eileen come over.
(See the end of the chapter for
„Good … i think it went well.“ He looks happy, peaceful and in a strange way untouchable like Castiel from when they first met. Happy Castiel? Or brainwashed Castiel? And Dean suddenly fears that it's back to the beginning. But with Jack running the business it wouldn't be, would it?
„Very much.“
The Shadow pauses, looks at him like he was an insect and turns away. No answer.
„So … did you like it? Did it feel good?“
He throbs, shivers and hears Cas coughing. Cas stands up, leans against him and the tiled wall, kisses his temples and looks at him curiously, while he is still throbbing, exhaling and embarassed to be watched so closely.
„Why is everyone around me a nerd?“
„That's what upsets you!? I'm more distressed because that one woman is her own grandma or … whatever.“ Dean pauses before the next episode of „Dark“ starts and glances at Cas.
They silently shift position as Dean suddenly gets incredibly nervous.
„So ...“ Cas breaks the silence once again. „You obviously thought I would switch back to being a good soldier.“
