My knees are actually shaking now. "John... John... wait..." I pant. I have no confidence that I'll be able to stay on my feet any longer if he continues, and God, do I want him to continue. "Bed... please..." He smiles up at me and pulls his fingers away, eliciting a whine from me, and turns off the taps. With a last lick up my length, he gets to his feet. I attempt to step out of the shower, but these wobbly knees... I manage to tear the shower curtain off the rod.
"I think it's still a bit chilly for us to sleep outside, don't you?" Not that I would mind curling up naked against him again... I shake my head to clear away that errant thought. "I'm sure whoever lives in that cabin would be willing to let us sleep on the floor for a night."
"Really? May I?" I reach for the paper, and Sherlock hands it to me. "So, Lord Watson has no idea who it was, hm? So... anyone could show up and claim to be the Phoenix... reap the reward." I look again at the picture they've re-run from the morning edition. "Greg, surely YOU know who it is... that mask is certainly your work."
"No. No no no. I was trying to reciprocate." I grab him from behind and curl on to him as much as possible. "I like darling. Not so much when you refer it to Daisy." I start to kiss his neck and scratch my mild scruff against him.
I trade him tea for the envelope. Before he has a chance to say anything, like don't open it, I tear it open.
"Yeah yeah yeah. Unless you plan on an early dinner it won't matter. They only have," I pretend to look at a watch I don't wear, "about three hours left."
"Well, Greg helped... convinced me that I could do it, I guess. Being anonymous helped. I just didn't want Mycroft to find out I was there. He would be very upset with me."  I stand up and finish dressing. "And once I was there, chatting with you put me at ease, too."
"Never been better." I whimper as he pulls out of me, and grabs a flannel from the bathroom to clean us both up. "And a nap sounds like an excellent idea." I say with a slightly sleepy grin.
"Oh? Your brother explained all that in the letter, did he? What kind of would-be murderer writes a note to his victim?" I start pulling leaves and smaller twigs off the branches and putting them in a pile. "You could help you know."
"John?" I ask quietly as I grab a flannel to clean up with. "Mmm?" he responds. "I want to go home. Come home with me."
"Did you like it? When I talk to you that way?" I gasp as I grind against him, my cock almost painfully hard.
I see Lord Watson approach, a look of shock on his face. "My Lord," I bow my head curtly. "I should have security straightened out shortly." He stares at me blankly. "Erm... is there a problem?"
When John moves to Sherlock's side in a defensive stance, I assume a similar stance in front of Mycroft.
I wake to a commotion in the room. I sit up, bleary eyed, to see John pinning my brother to the ground. "John, you should probably let him up, since this is his room, after all..."
"I think that you have been seriously underestimated." The things I could learn from her. Oh goodie!! "Let me make you some more tea."
I reach into the tree hollow and grab my coat, slipping it on quickly. "Come on, John!" I'm anxious to leave.
"That's quite smart." I top off his tea. "Tell me something though, why did you leave your food and water?"
"Mum. It’s not going to happen. Thank you for trying. I love you for that." I stand and stretch some kinks out. "We've been at hours though. Let’s call it done now, ok?"
I pull out a chair for Mrs. Hudson, and take the seat next to her, right across from Jim. John takes his seat next to me, and Seb next to Jim. We all glare at each other for a moment, until Mrs. Hudson breaks the silence.
"You enjoyed yourself a few times tonight already. The blow job when you drove us home and again when I fucked you in the shower. I enjoyed myself as well. Least I was until you tried to slither out of here so that no one would see you leave but you have no problem greasing diplomacies arse in front of Queen and Country." How does this man make me so angry and yet we are both still rock hard.
My fingers curl into his hips as I pound into him, the heat curling inside my gut. "I never... make you wait... too long..." I gasp out, shuddering as I get closer.
His whole body spasms the moment before my mouth is filled with warm salty fluid that I swallow instantly. I keep his cock in my mouth for a few moments as he calms down. When he seems a bit relaxed I raise up and stroke his thighs. I watch him as he slowly returns to himself and opens his eyes.
"Don't take that tone with me, Mycie. I saw what I saw." I pull my fox mask off for a moment and run my hand through my hair. "I saw what I saw."
"Yeah. A bit. Angry at you. Angry at my Mum. Mostly just angry at me." I put my arm over my eyes and try to force my body to relax. The pain in my leg starts acting up so I massage it a bit and repeat -it’s not real- in my head.
"Sometimes something can seem so simple but it’s still hard to make yourself take that first step." I tug a bit more until I feel his boots hit the tips of mine. "Sometimes you just need a bit of help, or encouragement." As if we were still dancing I twirl him so that his back is against the wall and the curtain behind me. "Sometimes you need a nudge." I feel my way up to his face with my hands. Hoping that in the dark he will be less resistant to me moving his mask I take a chance and slip it up bit by bit. Though its not completely dark there is not enough light that I would be able to see any of his features. I pull my own mask completely off once his is resting on his hair. "Sometimes... Sometimes all someone needs is permission."
"Of course not... do you think I should? I look at the bottle, somewhat alarmed. "She said it was harmless when we made it..."
"Why do you care? Why would my eating be part of your price? I guarantee I will be able to fill your needs despite what I do or do not drink or eat." Why does he care? No one's cared before and no one should care now.
"We... we had just finished the last of the food this morning. That's why we were looking for a hot meal and a warm night's sleep. We happened upon the smoke from your stove..."
I smile into the kiss and push against him, sucking in his lower lip. "Yes, I will. Of course. I can't very well cook it otherwise. darlin'."
"Your sister isn't Mycroft. He may have a temper, and may treat me harshly, but he does care." I set my satchel on the bed in the main room - obviously John's bedroom.
"Oh, don't be difficult. I can carry you on my back. It's better than spending another night outdoors, don't you think?"
"Nothing. Empty. Neighbors didn't see a thing." I feel a tad guilty about using the warrant card I borrowed from Greg to gain entry into the flat. "Pretty dodgy area. Not the kind of place any one ever sees anything."
"One moment!" I holler down the stairs, quickly wiping my hands on my apron as I hurry down the stairs to the front door.
I park my motorcycle in the garage, hanging my helmet on it, and walk into the house, to find Jim lounging on the sofa (as usual) and Martha humming happily in the kitchen. I shake my head as I hang up my coat. "Hey, babe. Good day?"
"Maybe they broke in to get at Lord Watson... Shh." Though the few people who know Sherlock would not necessarily mind him getting hurt they definitively are not the type to do it themselves.
"Why would you do that to him?" I snarl. "Have you ever dealt with a panic attack? It was hard enough to manage when he was a child, but now... I don't know that I can anymore. And I have been dealing with his idiosyncrasies a hell of a lot longer than you have. Our parents never dealt with him properly, figured he'd outgrow his social awkwardness. Lucky them - they didn't see themselves proved wrong."
I exhale with a shudder as his slick hand closes around my neglected dick and starts to move. "Mmmm," I mumble. I can already feel the warmth from the lube, but I don't care - his hand feels divine.
I pat my mouth with my napkin before I stand up with my drink. "Lovely dinner. Thank you. Believe I'll go get the car now."
"Let's walk a few more minutes. There's a clearing not far from here where we can set up camp, if you want." I release him and get to my feet, putting out a hand to help him up, too. "Then we can talk." I take Daisy's reins and lead both of them up the path another 10 minutes to the clearing. Looking around, I notice the remnants of another small fire, and a large fallen tree, its center somewhat hollowed out. "I think we aren't the first to find this clearing..." I say, as I tie Daisy's reins to a nearby branch, and relieve her of her burden.
He's found that spot again - his cock rubs it much more insistently than his fingertips did - and I feel like every nerve ending is aflame. My own dick is in dire need of attention, too, as I try to arch against him for some friction.
"Erm, Holmes. Sherlock Holmes." I shake his hand briefly, then look around. "Do you know where they keep milk in this place? It's been years since I've done any shopping..."
"Lies!" I hide my head and laugh at my noticed attempts to go unnoticed. "It wasn't until I got quite intoxicated at Fathers Memorial that I finally had courage to talk to you. It was quite fortuitous for me that you stumbled over my chair."
He clenches tightly then relaxes even further as I'd hoped. I add a third finger while I take his dick all the way in my mouth as possible.
"Why, I should think since you brought me here, you'd know." I sit across the table from him and smile at him sweetly over the edge of my teacup.  My name is Martha Hudson. Just a little old woman who minds her own business."
I chuckle to myself innocently. "Oh, he was far redder than that when he found me in the kitchen this morning," I smile at him. "Somehow, I think I might have slipped his mind."
"I'm well aware of that." I flip on her pot and grab the box of normal tea. The door buzzer goes off and I jump. It is much louder in here. No wonder she gets so upset at us when visitors show up unannounced at awful hours.
"Mummy was going to kill you. I did the only thing I could think of. She thought you dead and I was disposing the body." I shudder at the memory of hoisting an unconscious Sherlock first to the wagon then to the cave. "My intent was to return the next day, but the snow storm..." My stomach clenches and threatens to expel the small amount I was able to force myself to eat.
His mouth is doing wonders for me. When I look down and see him playing with himself my cock throbs hotly. "Sher. Sherlock. That's so hot." I can see his arm as he plays with himself and his arse flexes.
I run my hand through my hair nervously. "Yeah, that was a pretty colossal misunderstanding, wasn't it? I don't regret it now, but when I figured it out, I thought for sure I'd insulted you to the point where you'd never consider me anything but a paying client."
"No. Sometimes she drinks more or makes a total arse of herself." Finally a waiter with food passes by. "I'll take that thank you."
"A pleasure, Mr. Stamford. My brother has mentioned you, as well. Seems you and he have a few common interests."
I can feel him swallow around my cock, and it's the most exquisite feeling. My fingers curl into his hair, holding him steady for just a moment before I pull him back slightly, so he can take a breath before I push him back down. "Just like that, darlin'... just like that..." I growl as I control his movements. I can feel the familiar curl of sensation in my groin.
I laugh at his not so hidden glee as he shows me the headline. "Oh trust me. I know. -Everyone- knows. What they don't know is who wore that mask. I have been contacted by no less than a dozen Reporters, Government Officials, and one person of dubious character, asking me who I sold that mask to." I didn't tell anyone anything but Sherlock would already have that figured out.
"I think we should... " I completely lose my train of thought as he drags his lips up my body. I lean up a bit and finish pulling off my vest with a chuckle.
"I was much younger - it was not long after Mummy and Father died. I decided to impress my brother by taking care of the shopping while he was at work. I was on my way home with the week's shopping, and a group of kids struck up a conversation with me. The longer we talked, the ruder they became to me. I got a bit scared, tried to get away from them, but they managed to corner me. The hospital had to call Mycroft at work to come get me."
Seb jumps up and has his gun drawn on the figure laying outside the kitchen door before I've even stood. I look around him and see: -- Sherlock with his arse in the rubbish bin, -- Watson with his gun carefully trained on Seb, -- Martha still happily humming away as she puts the roast, the final piece of dinner, on the table, -- and me. "Maaaarrrrtha. Dearie. You have visitors." I shrug and kiss Sebby on the cheek for being such a good protector. "I'll reward you later."
"No, I don't think so, John." I huff. "It wouldn't be proper. You have the space - he can sleep in the parlour."
"It's Miss, but you may call me Irene." I smile sweetly. "Are you injured? I might be able to lend assistance."
I haven't slept, spending the nighttime hours letting out the waist on several pairs of Mycroft's trousers.
I look at the carcass he shoves into my hand with horror. "What, exactly, do you expect me to do with this?"
"I'm glad I'm not the only one who's nervous." I chuckle. "So now that you've been discharged from the Army, are you planning to go into private practice? As a Doctor, I mean."
Once at the Castle I part ways from Myc and make my way to the parlor where Lord Watson and his family are waiting.
"Boiiiillllinnnggg..." He still looks like there's nothing going on upstairs. "Ugh. We have everything we need to heat up the water. Wow." If that was hard how hard is it going to be to tell him naked cuddling with our clothes over us would be the best way to survive this night.
I smile back at him as we walk the short distance to the restaurant. The manager nods at me when we enter, and he seats us at a table near the window. "Order anything you like. Dinner's on me tonight."
"Interesting. The balance of probability says you are more likely to get frustrated with me and leave. That's what usually happens, anyway. Though I admit, you've been around me longer than most.
"Well, John and Sherlock, it's a pleasure to meet you." I took a sip of my tea, looking over the top of my cup at each of them.
I slip his belt off and unbutton his trousers. "Well, that is an order I am most willing to obey. It's to my advantage, too, after all." I nuzzle against his stomach as I hook my thumbs onto the waistband of his trousers and pants, sweeping them to the floor in one motion.
“Don’t you find that odd? Given how long you two have been ‘other-than-professionally-acquainted’? You don’t
I snort a bit at the two. "Peas in a pod you two are. Get that from a book as well Sherlock?" All of a sudden I'm angry and tired and sore and very much do not like this woman.
Before I can decide if it's safe Sherlock appears in the clearing. "Dammit. I told you to stay put!"
"I... think I know where he's gone. Greg and I are going to go check on him, perhaps bring him back in time for dinner, if that's all right."
"Very much so." My voice rumbles as my clothing joins his on the bedroom floor. I climb onto the bed, almost cat-like in my movements, until I am straddling his thighs, my lips brushing his collar bone.
I try to arch my back a little, to take the pressure of his weight off my aching arse, but he forces me back down into the mattress. Still the combination of pleasure and pain sends a shiver through me.
"No?" I pout playfully. "What is tonight the night for, then?" I wrap my hand around his firm flesh and stroke firmly, my eyes never leaving his.
"She's a rascal like her rider." My hair started its systematic departing from my head when I was just nineteen years old. It needs no encouragement to leave quicker. Gregory has just started showing fine lines of silver that I do not believe he's noticed yet.
"Meet me by the fountain in, say, 20 minutes?" I nod to the fountain, just visible over the hedges from our vantage point.
I look at the trees and have a hard time figuring out how he will be able to see above them. "I believe I smell smoke."
"I suppose, if you insist..." I shrug. "But we'd make far better time if I carried you." I put an arm around his waist and lean down so he can put his arm around my shoulders.
"You are the best pupil." I briefly get lost in a fantasy of Lock wearing a school uniform, me in my BAF uniform, doing all sorts of naughty things on top a desk. "Now you're distracting me. Bad boy." I smile a bit so he knows I'm not really upset. "Since this obviously isn't shutting you up let's try something else."
"Because you're you. You're possibly the smartest person I've ever met. The way you eat peaches is pornographic. The biscuits were amazing and I do believe I was promised a pie."
"You’re still thinking. Hmm I must be doing something wrong." I grab the oil, that now lives in easy reach under the pillow, and put a dollop on my palm. I stroke his shaft a few times before I let it go and grab my own. "I wonder what is the best way to get that brilliant brain of your to stop."
I keep swallowing as he cums, until he pulls away from me and flops down beside me on the bed. I close my eyes and take a deep shaky breath as I continue stroking myself, getting close myself.
"I dunno, babe... she's making sense to me." I shrug. The glare I get in return makes me glad he's not sitting on the sofa with me right now.
My breath catches as he straddles me, rubbing against me in all the right ways and all the right places, thrilling me to the core. I feel his lips curl into a smile against my neck as he grinds his hips against mine. I curl my fingers into his waist.
My breath is ragged as I continue to thrust into his slick hands. My fingers curl tightly into the bedding as my orgasm overtakes me, and I spill over his hands and onto my stomach. He strokes me through until I relax, the waves of pleasure finally ebbing.
Oh yeah! That's what we were doing. "Sure, let's go." I put my hand on his shoulder and start the hobble to the cottage.
"Sometimes. When Mummy and Father are late at the shops, Mycroft will make our meals. He's a terrible cook, though."
"Sometimes help with chores??" I put my face into my palm. "You shouldn't just be helping with chores. You should have a job."
"Noooo. It will keep the cold from seeping up through the ground and we'll use my jacket as a blanket."
"He's just being protective. If I need to leave the house, he always comes along. Or makes sure someone is with me, like Greg sometimes." I reach for my shirt and slowly start to dress as I talk. "Mummy used to take me to do her shopping..."
"Excuse me? Are you saying I found the real desire to be your whore?" I try to shrug off his embrace or even push him away.
I look back at Mycroft for a moment. "No, no thank you, Miss Adler. We need to keep looking for him." I take a step back nervously - something about this woman just doesn't feel right. "If you do happen to see him, can you find a way to get a message to the town magistrate? That's where we'll be heading next, I think."
"Gregory?" I can barely speak but I feel the need to try. I don't know what to say or. how to ask. I've never been confused as much before.
"I'm at your service buttercup. What else you need? Maybe I help you find it and you tell me what to do for fun in these parts. Deal?"
"Just follow my lead" I grin as I take his hand and put my other hand on his waist. Soon we are waltzing around the room fairly comfortably.
Having pity on him, I relieve him of the tray, setting it on a nearby chair for the moment. "No, my brother is at home. He is quite busy, though... I'm not sure he has time in his schedule for another project."
My cock jumps at his description of what he's planned. I stroke my hands up his arms, stopping at his shoulders and pulling his lips to mine for a bruising kiss.
Sherlock shouts and I rush to his side with my knife out in front of me to protect him from his murdering brother. "What happened? What's wrong?"
I nudge him to lay down and put my hands above his head. I make sure that I'm not pinning him down so has plenty of room to move. He leans his head up and my head goes so far down his throat I can feel him swallowing around the whole thing. "Mmm. Mycie. Not gonna last." Someday I'll have to convince him to let me take a picture when we're like this. His hair is a mess, drool is coming out of his mouth at the corner, he's wanking himself, and the whole thing is ‘bout as perfect a sight I could ever see.
I wipe away some of the juice running down my chin. "This is just a very ripe peach - excellent flavor, too." I smile.
"I reserve the right to ask as the situation calls for it." I respond to his kisses enthusiastically. "I trust you to be gentle with me."
I try not to roll my eyes as I put down the pot I've been scrubbing. Grabbing a towel to dry my hands, I walk through the living room, past my brother, and open the door. "Hello, Greg. How are you?"
I watch him as he pokes at the fire. "I suppose I could. Been a long time since... since I've had a chance to visit any of the estates." 'Visiting' isn't exactly what I was doing at the Smallwood Estate, after all.
WHACK No noise, no warning, no way to be prepared before the last blow came down right on top of the first one.
A sudden realization occurs to me. "You mean, you plan on sleeping NAKED?" I'm positively horrified, and it shows.
I am sitting at the kitchen table as Greg chuckles to himself, putting the kettle on to boil. I am thoroughly confused by what I just saw.
"I confess, I haven't had a chance to attend many. Not a huge fan of crowds, it seems, though." With so many people there can't possibly be enough air in this room, and I'm feeling unnaturally warm. "Perhaps we can step onto the balcony for some air?"
"What for? To yell at Lock? To eat burnt biscuits? No. Stay with me love." I hold on to him tighter in attempts to get him to sleep in my bed tonight.
I huff. "Really, John..." I mumble as I haul myself up out of my chair. "I ask for one simple thing..." I head down the stairs and knock on 221A. No answer. I knock louder. Still no answer. "Mrs. Hudson!" I bellow.
I acknowledge the young man in the phoenix mask. "I'm glad you are enjoying your evening, William. And obviously my boy enjoys your company." It didn't escape my notice that John has not danced with anyone else tonight.
The moment he cums I immediately follow. The relief is so intense I get dizzy. "Gods I love you." I collapse next to him and grab his hand to intertwine with mine.
I turn us with the music, and glance at the man John selected. "Unhappy marriage. You see how he's holding his partner? That's his wife. Every time he takes notice of another woman, her grip on his shoulder tightens."
"Have you actually explained this to him, Greg? He may be brilliant, but relationships are not his strong suit." I take the towel out of his hand before he starts scrubbing the finish off the table with it. "And not just in the heat of an argument - as soon as voices get loud, he stops listening."
"Hmm? Oh, uh, no. No problem. How are you?" I know I'm blushing but I can't stop thinking about his rather interesting discussion with a particular silver fox.
I open his pack and find socks, spare shirt and britches, wine skin, a bag of fruit, and some dried leather. "All I found was fruit." I pull out my own food bag containing two types of cheese, the remainder of the bread, some grapes, and a flask of Brandy.
I give him a dramatic, wide-eyed, innocent look. "Me? I don't hide anything." I lean over and kiss him soundly on the lips.
"I'm high. You got me high." I go grab a honey cake and take a deep breath. "I am very ok with that." I pop the dissected treat in my mouth before flopping on the couch next to the arm chair Martha has taken over.
I fling open the door to find Andrew - one of the boys in the homeless network - standing there. "Mr. Holmes, sir," he stammers. "A man gave me this envelope and told me to make sure you got it this morning." I crouch down to be more at eye level with the lad. "Did he tell you what it was about, Andrew?" "No, sir. Only that it was really important. So important he told me he'd give me 10 quid to make sure I got it to you right away." Andrew's eyes sparkled. "I ran all the way here with it." "You did well, lad. Go get yourself something to eat." I hand the boy another 10 quid. He smiles broadly, and skips up the street. "John, we may well have a clue," I holler as I return to Mrs. Hudson's kitchen, where John has poured the tea and is waiting.
John     "No. The poultice is doing a great job. Can't feel a thing." I take a bite of the stew and set it aside. Something about it tastes... funny, off, what's that word again... "Sorry ‘bout us taking your bed. I don’t have any coin, but I could do some jobs around here to repay your kindness." Looking around I can't see anything that needs to be done. "Is this place new? It looks well made."
"I thought we were trying to find your brother... I was trying to stay on his trail as much as we could." I shrug off my clothes, laying them carefully on the blankets, then slip slowly into the hot spring with a sigh. "This is delicious, Mycroft... join me."
"Hey.. hey now..." I move quickly to gather him onto my arms as his knees buckle, lowering him gently to the ground. He's overcome with relief, apparently. I fervently hope I've not just given him false hope.
"Sherlock. I already told you. No one saw anything." As it's clear he is ignoring me I head down the stairs, again, to get the manager, again.
"I like to read, when I have time. Usually late at night when my... family is asleep, so I'm not bothered."
I stop the kiss because I hear something out of the norm. I look around and see Sherlock at the bedroom door. "Sherlock!" I jump up and the Sherlock in my lap almost falls to the ground. "How can you be there? And here?" I look from the Lock by the door to the one next to me but the one next to me starts to transform into something, someone else. "You? How? Why were you kissing me?" The woman looks smug as she stands and flicks imaginary dust off her gown. "I. I. Uhh. I." I push past the woman and storm out the front door.
"Fine." I swing my feet to the floor and right myself so I can eat. I take a bite of curry, and studiously rearrange the food on my plate.
"I could kip some from the kitchen if you want. Add it to the peaches." Score a point for Watson rambling. It paid off. "If it wasn't dark I would show you them. Maybe tomorrow..."
ForFuckSakeGodDamnItImGoingToKILLHim. Sherlock passes me and skedadles over to the kitchen door. I make hand motions to move. When that doesn't work I whisper, "move." If he doesn't get us killed I will kill him myself. Kill him dead. I swear.
Looking down and him I finish taking my shirt off and let it drop to the floor. "Undress me." Something in him makes me just want to dominate him from time to time. This afternoon appears to be one of those times.
"Nah. Jimmy just said he needed to go take care of his Grandma. He was good like that. Always doing nice things. Really classed the place up a bit. Gonna miss ol' Jimmy Wolfe and his guy." I'm itching to call my bookie and give him my bet. 40 quid on a long shot should do me nicely. "We done?"
I growl. "If I hadn't been snoring, you'd still be sleeping off your little experiment, not torturing me at 4am..."
"Luckily, the Chief guard didn't see it - I suspect I might have gotten a bit of a stern talking-to. I was
"Water and bridges, Brother dear." It wouldn't have mattered and him knowing would have made things between those two worse.
"If your parents adopted a fey child it would've been you, not him." Maybe that's his secret? He's half fey and half ... No. He's Sherlock. That's it. That's all. That's more than enough. "We should take the place from the back. Let me scope it out before you run in half-cocked and get your head blown off. I've grown quite used to it."
"It was apparent to me last night that you are... experienced." My hands trail down his sides, coming to rest on his hips. "We'll just have to see how much I have learned." I lean down and flick my tongue along his inner thigh.
Sherlock scoots back a bit and his butt wiggles a hairsbreadth away from my hips. My arm tightens around him without my consent. "Are you ok? Warm enough?"
"I worked up an appetite." I rack my brain for any questions I could ask and he might actually answer. "We have apples too. And bee hives."
"Most people think it's a silly name for a black horse... like she should be named Midnight instead. But when I looked into her eyes, I knew her name was Daisy, no matter what she looked like." I'm starting to get misty-eyed - time to change the subject. "What did you bring for lunch?"
I carefully listen to John's instructions - even though I've read how to do this in several books, and could probably figure it out myself, he seems to enjoy teaching me - and manage to strike a spark into the kindling, and nurse it into a proper flame. In no time, there's a decent fire going. John smiles proudly. Gods, he's got a gorgeous smile. Those soft lips. I shake away the thoughts again.
"Yes, that's good." I stroke his cheek as my head rolls back. "Now take it all." I apply light pressure to the back of his head - not forceful, but enough to make sure he'll do what I want.
I shrug my shoulders. "Nah, I don't want to go. It's a room full of mundane boring fishies looking for other fishies to make baby fishies with. Sebby named it The Fish Bowl. Just another reason I love him."
Pfft "Yes, thank you. I am not a small child. Nor am I 'darling'.  Are there many important people in your life?"
I climb into the bed - still perfumed with whatever floral essences Irene had used in her hair that afternoon - and pulled the blankets around me, leaving a space to my side for John to occupy.
"I'm open to suggestions. Suggest away." I lift the tea cup over my head to get the last few drops. Refilling it would take too much effort. Seb does the refilling. And the getting. And the making. And the buying.
"I have thought about this a great deal, Mycroft. I have no land or money to pass to an heir. What would be the point?" I shrug. "Besides, I've never considered myself much of a family man. My own family turned its back on me years ago."
With a whine, I writhe under his hips. I can feel my cheeks flush as I watch him lick and suck my fingers.
"Oh!" I jump up to try and help him back to his feet, but he decides to just sit on the floor. "Would like me to call him for you, dear? I don't think you're in a fit state to talk to him right now."
I nod quietly. "I think I have some leather cord in my pack - I will string it around my neck in the morning, if that suits." Working with my hands as I do, wearing a ring on my finger all the time isn't terribly practical. "Now go to sleep, love." I kiss the top of his head. "We need to go get your brother home tomorrow."
I bite my lip to keep from giggling, which would be wholly inappropriate given the current topic. "I noticed you're rubbing your shoulder, yet you complain of a limp and walk with a cane. Your limp is psychosomatic, of course. And right now, your hands are perfectly steady - likely because you're under pressure, trying to impress..."
I think back to all the nights he spent hours edging me. We have very different ideas of waiting too long. He does a twist of his hips and starts really pounding into me. I can feel another cum coming on. Oh fuck. So good. I'm so overstimulated but the pleasure in the pain is delicious.
My breathing is ragged as I try to maintain a steady rhythm, rocking against him. I wrap my hand around my cock, stoking in time with his thrusts.
It's not been to long but the pain in my ankle has turned to a dull throb. I could attempt to walk again but this is quite nice. "I don’t know. Maybe twenty minutes or so."
"Good Mikey. This is a friend of mine. Mycroft Holmes. Mycroft, this is an old school friend, Mike Stamford."
"Well. He was always doing puzzles and asking riddles and such. He was too smart if you ask me." And too gay.
"Does she, umm," is Gregory intentionally trying to be distractive I wonder. "Does she often have reason?'
"Roll over my pretty fishy." He winces when his sore flesh touches the sheet. There's no thread count that can make that ok.
I move around so that my head is slightly off the cushion, one leg on the opposite arm rest, the other over the couch. "I'd kill him for you if he was still alive. I would. Honest. And I would do it personally, not just have someone else do it for me." I stretch to reach for a biscuit but it's just out of my reach.
"You've been drowning your guilt, Mycroft. Between that and not eating, you're going to kill yourself before we ever find Sherlock. And that's not on. I won't have it."
There's no way I'm going to sleep like this. "One more move, k? Budge up a bit." After he leans away I move to lay on my back. "Lay on me. We can pretend it's like last night. Just without clothes." He seems quite unsure of all of this. "Think of it like an experiment. You can compare the warmth differences of snuggling, err sharing body heat, with and without clothes." Science. Science is good. Science is my friend. Thank you, Science.
"Two days is long enough then I'll be out of your way and you and Harry can be surrounded with all the appropriate and properly-vetted company you can handle." I grab the Phoenix mask from Harry's drunk touchy-feely hands.
I grab the lube and slowly sink to my knees. I put a hand on each cheek and my thumbs in between them. As I pull my thumbs away from each other I am shown a view of his downy-covered opening and the back side of his balls. I tentatively lick at the opening a bit to see what his reaction is.
"As it happens, Lady Watson is looking for someone to help with finding Lord Watson's mysterious suitor. Might be right up your alley. Interested?"
"Don't you think if he really wanted me dead, I would be by now? He could have poisoned the bread or whiskey, or just killed me outright." I rub my hand over his. "No, I think Mycroft was just trying to keep me away from Mummy."
"Congratulations Mr. Holmes." I smile brightly. This day has been a rollercoaster that looks to be ending on a very high note.
"I will be… just not immediately." I focus on palming the head of his cock while tracing my way to his arse hole. "Lift your knees up a bit, ok." Once he's in the new position I stop to add a bit more oil then rub my finger around his opening. The sounds he makes are musical encouragement that he's enjoying himself.
"Mmmm... that's nice..." I groan as he rubs his cock against mine. I stroke my hands down his back, following the curve of his arse.
Relaxing against the headboard, I nod at Mycroft as he enters my bedchamber. I have thoroughly enjoyed his company these past few weeks, even though I've paid dearly for it.
"Have you ever heard of a guy named Jim Moriarty?" Sherlock is furiously typing on his phone to the exclusion of all else.
I hug my Mum and give her a quick twirl. "I found him. Mum, this is Sherlock, aka Phoenix, aka William." I take Lock's hand as I introduce him to Mum. "Lock, this is my Mum, Lady Dove of Clan Watson."
I read over the note again. "Useless!" I huff, tossing it onto the coffee table. "Red Riding Hood went to her grandmother's house. She didn't kidnap her grandmother and disappear into London with her!"
Most of my body is pleasantly warm, being in contact with his bare skin... except my backside. Perhaps he didn't realize there was space between us.... I try to scoot back into him.
"Ok. Then tell me more about who you are." I head over to the rubbish sink to rinse my hands off and grab a towel for William.
"Watson pegged me right away for former military, of course. Asked if I'd served in Iraq." I rub his calves when I feel him tense up at that. "Didn't give him my real name, of course. Just friendly conversation."
"It's stupid. Forget I said anything." I go back to kissing his neck. I put my hands under his head, so I can run my fingers through his gorgeous locks.
"Yeah, um," I run my fingers nervously through my hair. "Ain't lookin' to get married. Not Jim's type of relationship." I shrug.
I consider protesting that I'm more concerned with his pleasure, but in my current position, that's fairly difficult. Instead I suck him into my mouth, my tongue running over the underside of his cock the way I know he likes.
I wake just as Mycroft returns with tea and breakfast. "Thanks, babe. You going to join me?" He may be paid company, but I do actually like him.
With a sly smile, I climb over him, sliding my body down his, kissing my way down his chest and stomach, smoothing my thumbs over his hip bones as I brush my stubbled cheek over his cock.
"Fine. Let me check in with Lady Watson, and we can go." I walk down the hall to the dining room, where Lady Watson sits with several papers, tut-tutting over the articles. "Madame, have you seen your son?"
I take Sherlock into my arms and rub my hands briskly up his sides to help him warm up. "You’re bloody freezing."
"Sounds good. Early start and all tomorrow." The tree is hollow is deep enough for two but not side by side as much. "You want to be front or back first?"
I mumble to myself, but when I open my eyes... I realize I'm not in my bed... in our home... where the hell am I? I am very confused.
"No. I did not. I said if they're here in 48 hours. Not in the next 48 hours." I put both hands on the table loudly. "Tell her why she's wrong Seb."
“Please.” I watch as Sherlock takes the cups and refills them. When he returns to the table, I ask, “So how did you spend your evening?”
I quietly slide my legs off his lap and get to my feet. Reaching down, I take his hand and pull him to his feet, too. "Join me?" I ask shyly.
"Last night was nice. Thanks." We had ended up going out to drinks after 'making-up' all the way through dinner time. It was different to be seen in public with him. No, not actually seen with him, but him not being afraid to be seen with me. We both ran into friends and no one said anything. That's what was nice. We'd been seen, together, doing friend stuff, together, and nothing changed.
I wipe at the back of my neck as Mum chastised me. "Just pointing out you won’t be killing him anytime soon. And don't bother Maria, he'll be sleeping with me.
I grab his hand and put it on my chest. "This isn't about you Holmes. It’s about me taking my pleasure from you." I come to a stop and stroke myself a few times. "Do you understand?"
I push the second finger in as far as the first and start to scissor them. I hold his hand on my cock to stop myself from cumming.
"You've already suffered from Society's judgement of your character. I would hate to be fodder for more. Especially now that you've overcome it." I look up into his eyes so he can see the truth in my words. "I want nothing more than to be with you. Always. But... I wouldn't have you be harmed anymore."
"Yeah. Sure." I start to rub my knee like I do when nervous. It's been a long while sense I've spoken about much outside of Medicine or Soldiering. "So, umm, what now?"
I chuckle. "I forget. You haven't known her very long. Have you ever wondered how a widowed pensioner could afford a place like this, John? With her own apartment, as well as two to let out?"
I watch as the cool, calm, collected young man I know becomes a puddle of instant infatuation. I push him towards Lord Watson and step away once we've finished the queue.
As he bites down I add my pinky to his entrance. Once he's as prepped as I can make him I grab his hips to position him above me with my cock head at his opening. "Take your time. However long you need."
I hurry after John as he limps out the front door. "Wait! John!" I catch up to him quickly, and grab his arm. "I tried to wake you earlier. I think you're right... about not trusting her. I think she drugged you..."
"Shut up, Sherlock." I snap. "Do we have any of those biscuits left? The unburnt ones?" I knew the biscuits Greg had given me were baked by Sherlock, which means he's hiding some somewhere. "Never mind, I'll find them myself." I turn and storm into the kitchen and start rifling loudly through cabinets.
I keep glancing at the clock right along with Martha. "Dear Martha. Martha Martha Martha. They're not gonna show. Even -if- he does he's already laaatee."
I will, however, enjoy the benefits of this mystery. I happily kiss him back, nipping at his lower lip as I stoke my hands up and down his back.
"Has it occurred to you that you aren't the only one hoping to enjoy this?" I arch my back and try to continue thrusting into him, but he manages to prevent it.
Haven't not slept a wink does not make for a happy soon-to-be-deployed Watson. With the obvious exception of a likely still-drunk Harry, we all gather in the breakfast room for brunch. Mum has forgone her normal pile of newspapers in favor of a crossword. The reason is soon apparent... The front page of every paper, even the local gazette, has a version of me and William dancing. The headlines range from Romantic to Ridiculous
"Yeah. It's good. Thank you." I stretch a bit, feeling loose and relaxed. "Sorry we're such a bother." I grab the bowl to continue eating. "What meat is this? It's good."
"It seems the man you spoke with was not a former corporal, but a retired colonel. Colonel Sebastian Moran. Ever heard of him?"
"So... what about you?" I take a seat near where he's working on starting a fire. "Anyone from home looking for you?"
"Good plan, Watson. Let me help." I quickly get up from the table and follow him out, letting Jim and Sherlock hash out whatever details they need.
"You honestly think I'm that stupid?" I look back and forth from the brothers. "I know a fight when I see one. Even a silent one. And I know a bully too." I look directly at Mycroft now. "Tell me what's really going on. The whole story."
"Sir, yes Sir," I laugh at his forceful action. I grab the oil and warm some up in my hands. "Remind me to thank Irene for teaching you to make this. It'll come in handy to have lube on demand."
"Let’s continue." I tug Daisy’s rein to get her started walking again. "What do you think we'll find?'
"I might question your visual acuity, actually." I laugh. "Or perhaps wonder if you'd ever seen yourself in a mirror." I shiver as his fingers dance up my inner thighs.
I close my eyes and purr at the touch of his hand, even when he presses into the handprint he left before. It doesn't sting so much now - more of a dull ache. My cock twitches in anticipation
"Yeah. You can have as many as you want. Make tarts. Or pies. Or Sorbet. Or whatever you want." I get lost in my own fantasy of William being covered in peach pie filling. Long thin slices sliding off his body slowly. Cool whipped cream being devoured the moment it's placed. His naked body on an alter out in the orchard where I could watch him ripen in the Sun. "I'm sorry? Did you say something?"
I stop as the mattress hits the back of my knees and sit onto the bed hard. I reach forward and grab Greg's belt, pulling him toward me with a grin.
"Myc’s brother made some biscuits and sent me with some." I put a few on an empty platter and take the tray over to her. "Try them?"
"Brandy is a terrible breakfast choice, you know." I comment. I saw the open flask in his hand as I opened my eyes. I sit up and stretch.
I let out a surprised squeak at his enthusiastic response. I drag one hand down his back, pulling him closer to me as he pushes me onto my back. I pull away to catch my breath for a second, and chuckle. "Is this part of 'having your wicked way with me'? If so, I approve.
I stop my eye roll before I get glared at, and turn to return to the kitchen for my own meal. I stop and look at him. "So you're going to the Mask Ball tomorrow?"
"Did I not fuck all that attitude out of you earlier? Shame shame. I'll do better this time." I roll off of him and bring him on top of me.
"You're leaving, then? Running off with the first person you meet? I can't protect you if you leave..."
The car pulls up silently just up the street from the address Mycroft sent me. "After you, then..." I nod to John as the driver opens the door. "Did you bring it?"
"Cool. Can you give her my number?" I scribble a number on the back of his receipt and hand it to him. It's a burner phone that I picked up the other day. "Thanks, mate. Great talking to you." I turn and walk back to the scooter, heading back to the restaurant to drop it off.
"Father was frugal. Mummy was not. If I wanted to feed Sherlock, or get him new books, or have such luxuries as clothes or heating or---. Never mind." I start to eat if for no other reason than to stop talking.
I nod appreciatively. "That makes sense. I think I'll just follow your trail - you didn't step in any traps, after all." I turn and carefully do exactly that, heading to the edge of the water. Kneeling by the river's edge, I put my hands in the icy water, rubbing them briskly, then rubbing my wet hands on my face. I also take a moment for a long drink. Drinking cold water like this is probably terrible in terms of maintaining my body temperature, but it feels so... damn... good.
I reach behind me for his trousers, blinding looking for what he's requested. Finally finding it, I push the trousers back away from the spring and hand him the vial.
I chuckle at the last comment. I'd noticed a few errant strands of silver, but didn't think anyone else had. "My father's hair - what was left of it, anyway - was completely white before he turned 35, so I count myself lucky to only have a bit of silver." I kissed him back with a grin.
I barely glance in that direction. "No. But I would love to chat with you about your time in Afghanistan." I try to take his arm and lead him out of the crowd.
I grab the last biscuit before he can change his mind. "Only because you insist." Having nowhere to set the tray I look like an idiot with an empty plate in one hand and a biscuit in the other. "Greg, Lestrade? said your baby brother made them. I was hoping to put in a request for more. Is he here with you?"
"Of course I have. He just doesn't care. When I brought it up this morning he just left." I go to grab the towel back but he pulls it away from me. "Hence the walk of shame you asked about. He made it clear. He cares more for his image than for me." I pace around tapping the counter and the box I brought over. "I told him I don't want hugs and kisses and flowers or any other bs like that. I just wanted to be acknowledged. A wave, handshake, maybe a drink at the bar after work. Nothing that says -"hey world, we're fucking"- but maybe something that says -"hey, we're friends, I know him, he's a friend of mine, I'm not ashamed to be seen with him"-. You know what I mean Lock?" I smack myself in the forehead. "Damn. Sorry. Stupid question."
"Tea would be nice. Thanks." I set down the box I brought with me on the counter. "Give that to his highness next time you see him, k?" I fiddle with the lid a bit.
I climb out of the blankets and step over to the fire, grabbing a bit of the food and some water. "All right, then." I walk over to where Daisy is tied, and check her over, making sure her hooves and legs are none the worse for wear after yesterday's trek. Popping the last couple of grapes in my mouth, I head back into the cave and roll up the sleeping mat and blankets, hefting the bundle onto my shoulder as I walk back to the horse.
I yawn as I didn't realize how tired I was til right now. Maybe it's because I'm quite warm and comfortable. Something about all this makes me feel needed and some how safe.
"At least he left me the flask and the bread. And a knife." I shrug. "Perhaps he thought I would manage to survive, with all my book knowledge of the required skills."
"Of course I'll help." I pat the edge of the bed, indicating he should take a seat. "Tell me what I need to know, and we can get to work."
I cough on my tea when it hits me. I force out words between coughing spells. "Marriage. Spouse. Lord. Sherlock."
I smack Seb on the backside, and nod toward Jim. "Go get washed up for dinner, you two. John, Sherlock - you, too. Get inside this instant." I scold.
I'm startled from my morning paper by the text alert on my phone. I read Sherlock's message, frowning.
"Agreed!" I escort Myc to the Corvette and we make our way to the Castle. "You really think William won't show up?"
Instead of picking the paddle up I decide to finish the rest bare-handed. Still nestled against him I do three hard whacks against the area where the thigh and groin connect.
"It's the nature of my job and you know it. Sometimes the wheels of diplomacy need to be greased..."
I take advantage of the new position to grab his wrists and pin them down. "Do you really think you're capable of that, Gregory dear?" I smile down at him slyly. "Somehow, I don't think so." I lean down as though to kiss him, but when he tries to stretch to meet my lips, I pull away with a grin. "Tsk, tsk... so impatient..."
I take more in my mouth, my tongue working along his shaft as I start to suck gently, listening to the sounds he's making.
"I'm sure Martha still has enemies - and 'friends,' for that matter - from before. But she's been lying low for so long, I'd be shocked if it was someone she knew." I steeple my hands, deep in thought. "And of course, I have numerous enemies, most of whom are known to you. Many of those are incarcerated at this time, due to my work."
I lock my legs around him and flip him on his back with my arse on his chest. "A promise is a promise." I work my way down to his body licking, nipping, and sucking as I go. I spread his legs with my own. I gently scratch my nails from his thighs down to his knees that I lift to hook around my shoulders. "Let me see you stroke that sweet cock of yours."
Sherlock slumps down in the chair looking more contrite than the situation calls for. Greg hands me the cocoa and I head over to him. "Here love." I sit down so I'm in between Lock and Mycroft. Greg sits across from me. "Look. I don't know what the problem is but it stops now. Got it?" I look at Mycroft who has a bit of a sneer on his face.
I comb my fingers through his hair with a grin, but say nothing. I growl as he kisses and nips at my collar bone.
"Yes it is. Helps that you're quite handsome as well." I push him against Daisy but she doesn't take kindly to being used like that and takes a large step to the side. We would've fallen if it wasn't for Gregory’s quick reflexes.
I can feel him pulse each time he flexes. The way we work against each other is a well choreographed dance. His sensitivity and pain is a pleasurable bonus for both of us.
I'm gasping for breath, a familiar heat curling in my groin. "John, wait... I want..." I shiver as I thrust into our hands.
The oil is easing the way quite nicely. "This is enjoyable but what do you say to going further? Still up for it after this morning?"
"Jim, darling, you are a madman. And the old woman isn't much better." I say quietly. I can tell he's only pretending to be asleep now. I wonder how much he heard.
I chuckle at him. "And she talked you into a bet... after getting you high. Wonderful." I roll my eyes at him. "It's a good thing you're cute..."
"You're an idiot." I pull him in to a hug. "I never thought I'd see you again. And then, the thing with all the fakes up at the Castle, and biscuits, and you're Mycroft’s little brother, and, wait." I let him go and back up a few steps. "You know about what's going on at the Castle, yeah?"
"Ta." I quick smile lights up my face as I think of such a big guy on such a small scooter. Upon entering the flat I call out to Sherlock. "Get up, food’s here." His curls are dragging on the ground and his normally beautiful cheekbones are covered in a light scruff that does nothing to hide the pallor of his face.
In an attempt to call his bluff I halt the kiss and lay next to him. "Any suggestions? Maybe I could go out there wearing only a sheet?" Maybe I'm still a bit upset at him walking out with nothing but a small towel. Maybe.
"Is this your first Gregory?" I reach further, and my forefinger touches his rim then circles around it.
I whimper when he moves away, then wrap my legs around him. "Yes, yes... I'm ready." I lean up and kiss him back.
"Sherlock. Yes. Ok." He flops down on the other side of the bed dramatically. "Perfect." I then take the position he had moments ago. With me on top we are more lined up, which I show him when I thrust my hips into his as the same time that I bite gently on his neck.
I look up, startled, as John st arts to direct me to a short blonde woman with an extravagant white-feathered mask. "Dare I ask who I am about to meet?" I whisper to him.
"You won't find any biscuits, if that's what you're looking for. Mycroft's nursing his broken heart with them, and I advise against taking any from him directly." I chuckle. "I overheard a conversation between John, his mother, and his sister. Seems his mother was quite annoyed at his decision to spend all his time with me - some unknown. She really laid into him. I left shortly after that, to save him the embarrassment of having to avoid me the rest of the night."
"John, wait!" I grab his arm roughly. "You can't do that. She's likely to just poison us if she finds out that we know she's drugged us." I say in a rough whisper. "We need to wait until dark, then sneak away... find that guard."
I look down sheepishly. ' Ah, yeah, that makes sense." Why do I even question him any more. "You are brilliant." A flush, this time of pride, goes through me.
I hum as I brush my lips against the skin on his calves. It's not nearly as fun to go straight to the good part as it is to make him squirm and plead. "You were snoring. Such a naughty thing."
On the way to the meeting site Sherlock confirms that Captain Lestrade is who he says he is. Out of respect for his status, and not wanting Sherlock to be hurt accidentally, I make sure to make some noise before I enter the camp. "Captain." I nod at him curtly.
"Why is it always Sussex? Does anyone besides criminals retire here? Be nice to meet some normal people who own property out here." I enjoy the scenery as the driver navigates the road. "Maybe a quaint little B and B after we get Mrs Hudson back."
He lifts his head up to take in more of me and starts sucking me harder. I rock my hips mildly making sure I don't choke him in any way.
The tug of my hair pulls my head back, and I look at him, eyes sparkling. I rest my thumbs just inside his waistband. "Oh, these?"
"I admit, I do wonder. But I like to think you enjoy my company, and not just for the sex. I won't force you to do anything you're uncomfortable with, though. If the only way you will see me is by payment, I can live with that."
Thinking back on the events I see where he's right. "Oh Joy. And I didn't even notice. No one did. Wow." I glance down and see my hand isn't shaking either. "Do you notice a lot of things like that?"
"He gets bored, too, you know. And since you've been spending so much time with John now, he hasn't seen you as often." My voice lowers to a whisper. "He won't admit it, but I think he might be a little jealous."
I shrug. "Don't much matter. Tea is tea. Y'all putting milk in it is just weird. What kinda milk does he like?"
His fingers found the exact right spot... finally. I gasp in relief, and I screw my head back into the pillows, crying out John's name with my release. My whole body is trembling as I become aware again, and I look down to see John staring back up at me with a smile.
"Good night, John." I start to relax against him, savouring the warmth. In a different time and place, this could have been a really fantastic night. Now I'm just hoping to wake up with all my fingers and toes in the morning.
"Nothing that would scare me away as yet." I take his hand, intertwining my fingers with his. "I even like your snoring."
I sigh, frustrated. "Why couldn't you have mingled properly... met some of the other people of status there..." I meet his glare. "And now you're running off to get shot at... again. I swear, you have less sense than your father did..."
My mouth twists in a frown. "Look, Mycroft... I guess it's just my way of telling you that... that I care about you." I stammer awkwardly. "As more than just someone paid to keep company with me. I have for a long time now.  I haven't used such a term of endearment in many, many years, if that's what you're asking."
"It's always harmless when -you- do it." I grab a smoke from the pack in my jacket and blow smoke rings into the darkening sky. "There's a different set of rules for you than the ones for me."
My jaw drops as Lock says he knows nothing about this. Nothing! "Have you been under a rock for the last three months?? Everyone's talking ‘bout it. It's tomorrow afternoon. How could you not know?" Mycroft! "I'm gonna go give him a piece of my mind. That bloody wanker. I'll take back the mask and return the money."
"Don't be silly. Gravy required a proper kitchen." I huff, pulling off another piece of meat. My stomach's growling is beginning to quiet. "And I hate Mycroft's cooking."
"Oh, he gets annoyed when I bother him with such things during the day." I reach for a small container of the full-fat milk. "I'm sure this will do." I make a show of looking over the labels. "I don't understand why he likes milk in his tea, either, but he insists on it." I shrug.
"Not hungry." I take a few bites of bread bit the cheese is too much. I sneak it to Daisy who eats it with joy.
There's something not quite right about what he says. "Artillery, huh. You looking for a job? I know a couple people at the Yard." Criminals get twitchy when NSY gets brought up.
I nod enthusiastically. "Brilliant idea!" I grab small containers of each type and tuck them into the basket. "I can't be wrong this way!" I smile, pleased with myself.
I take his arm and walk quickly back to the edge of the clearing where Daisy is tied. "Let's wait here a bit. She can't see us easily if we head that way a bit" I point to a small copse of brush. "If he's been here recently, and is on foot, then he might come back."
"Maybe an hour or two." I reply, brushing off some of the dust. "Should be an easy walk - the forest thins a bit in that direction. Trail will be harder to follow, though. You need a break, or are you good to continue?"
I put a hand on either side of his face as he starts to suck me off. "Bloody perfect." His mouth was made to do this. Suck cock and spin facts.
"Charles? How does kaylay make Charles? Why Charles instead of Wolfe? I think you might be wrong this time."
"It's ok if he's cheating. I encourage it. He says we're 'polyamorous'. I say we are allowed to cheat. Potato / Zucchini."  I pour my empty cup over my mouth sadly. I look at Martha Dear in hope.
"So you can go out but you choose not to?" My fear of his ability to consent are laid to rest. Now my heart is heavy knowing that he lives in fear of people. "How were you able to talk yourself into going to the Ball?"
"If you're just going to torture me all night..." I grumble, digging my fingers into his hips painfully.
All of a sudden I am wide awake. "What do you mean? Home? With you?" His face falls. "No no no that's not what I mean. I'll go anywhere with you. But by home you mean that place with your Mum and brother?? They tried to kill you! It isn't safe."
"She behaving herself? Not giving you too much trouble, is she?" I tuck him into bed gently and curl up beside him.
I set the rest of my grass aside and start to make a small fire to keep us warm and heat the rest of the rabbit.
I look at him in alarm. "This doesn't make any sense." I struggle to reconcile the conflicting information.
"It might take me a few more min---" Of course, I'm talking to dead air. I make my way inside and off towards the left before I am accosted by the Red Ferret again.
My curiosity about the Woman surges, but instead of asking about her, I nod at Greg. "I suppose I am to consider you my brother, as well?" I smile, motioning at the Holmes ring on the leather cord around his neck. "Well, then, brothers, let's leave this place."
"Take it easy, sir." I walk toward them slowly, keeping my hands visible. "I'm looking for Sherlock." I nod at the younger man, who is obviously Mycroft's brother.
I bust out laughing. "Oh. Precious. That's just precious." I head out of the Security room before Mycroft can deduce the reason for my hilarity.
"That's exactly what I was hoping for, Greg. John's getting a bit... frustrated... with the process, I think. The fewer men make it through your preliminary examination, the better." I glance at the bag he's set on the table. "What's that?"
Seb and John both start talking when the tea topples over. "Oops?" It's obvious Sherlock won't believe it was an accident.
I glare at Moriarty sharply as I jump up, minimizing the amount of hot tea that spills onto my lap. "You did that on purpose..." I snarl at him. I start to reach across the table for a buttered roll. I am about to fling it at Moriarty's forehead when Mrs. Hudson's shrill voice makes me drop it.
The faint smell of smoke wakes me. I uncurl myself from the little ball I had become, in my desperate attempt to stay warm and open my eyes. Stiffly getting to my feet, I step out of the cave, to see a man kneeling over a small fire. He has dusty blond hair, and broad shoulders - not a bad form, in fact, from what little I can see from this vantage. "Good morning." I mumble.
I press against his hips, trying to help keep him standing for a few minutes longer. I pull back and take a breath, then dive forward again. My own neglected dick is throbbing with need, so I give it a few strokes, my moans vibrating around him.
"Are you ready to get started, Greg?  I understand we are to use the drawing room for interviews, as needed.”
"Goddammit. You don't get it do you?? I don't want your devotion or whatever else the bloody hell you seem to think I do. I want you to acknowledge me, you utter moron. I want you to be willing to be seen with me. Not dating or any shite like that but no more hiding the fact that you even know me." I get off him and the bed and put my robe on. "I no more want exclusivity than you do. I like my life as it is. I like fucking who I want, dating who I want, not having to get permission for anything. I don't want marriage or any other bs but I am sick and tired of being your dirty little secret.  If you can grope Mr Diplomacy you can at least shake my hand on the street!"
"And to you, Mr. Lestrade." I summon the waiter and have him bring a bottle of champagne. "We've reach several milestones today. Definitely worth a celebration." I smile as the waiter pours. I raise my glass to him.
I smile up at him. "I hadn't considered oral sex as a way to win arguments..." I swirl my tongue around his head then take it in my mouth experimentally.
"Gun shot. Go on, touch it." Being under his curious stare is a bit more than a little tantalising. As he watches, I turn around so he can see the exit wound, as well as unbutton my trousers and shimmy out of them. Turning back towards him I hook my thumbs into the band of my pants and tug them down a smidge.
After a few hours have passed we come to a small river. "This is a good place to sit a bit. We can finish the rabbit and grab some water. Do you still have those twigs you say are edible?"
I chuckle a bit. "Iraq, mostly. You?" I already know the answer, of course - Jimmy told me - but I want to get him comfortable and chatty.
"You sure? I can get it and the shirt cleaned, and get them back to you..." Greg had already walked out the door before I finished my sentence. I shrug, and wander into the living room.
"I'm not jealous of that stupid goldfish." I mutter to my tea cup how stupid and goldfishy that dumb stupid goldfish it. "He'll get tired and come back to our game. I just need to remind him he can't stop playing just because he has a new toy to play with." I absently grab a biscuit and crumble it. "Let me guess. He saved you from something and now you feel loyal and blah blah blah."
I swallow my wine. "Actually, Mr. Stamford, I may be able to assist with that, if you'd like. If I can handle international diplomacy, I suspect this particular crowd won't be difficult."
I look up at the stars but all I see is a different configuration that what I saw for the last six years. "I, uhh, I meant, what else do you see about me?"
With my hands behind his neck he cannot see what my fingers are doing. "Gregory, I have to ask you one thing. It's very important."
“She kept me around for a few years – longer than any ‘stable boy’ she’d had before, I’m told. But one afternoon, I came across a letter from Ginny’s father – seems Alicia had given him the money to pay for Ginny’s passage. I asked Alicia about it, and she flew into a rage, slapped me, called me an ungrateful little whore. I ran – grabbed Daisy from the stable and high-tailed it back to my father’s house with nothing but the clothes on my back and a few coins in my pocket.”
"We are close. Friends I mean. Close friends." Memories of the dream come to the forefront of my mind as Irene fills a bowl with a delicious smelling stew. "The pain must have gotten the best of me or I'm more tired than I thought."
His command makes me moan and I can feel my brain relaxing. I stop sucking and focus on licking his cock from base to tip and back again. I pay particular attention to the vein on the underside, intermixing kitten licks with long stripes before suckling on the head again.
I look around the room. "All the outfits are so extravagant. Honestly, I find my own lacking somewhat, by comparison."
"Now, now, there's no cause for shouting, young man," I scold the well-dressed man. "I was just being friendly..."
I sit back and watch his hands near my cock. "Thinking about doing something love? Or just going to be a tease...?" I place my hands on my thighs next to his and wait to see what his next move will be.
"Uh, hello, my name is John, I'm a hunter. You are...?" Judging by the voice I'm either trapped with a kid or some posh idiot who got lost like I did.
I look at the ring, then at him, clearly shocked. "I can't accept this! What of your brother? Or his children, should he have any? Your family property should rightfully be theirs." I put the ring back in his hand and fold his fingers around it with my own. "Besides, I don't want you for what you have. I want you for who you are."
"Couldn't be more fitting for you." I drop into a very serious demeanor. "You're a good man, Sherlock. One day you might even be a great one. But not if you stay here. You need to get out, see the world, fall in lust, maybe even fall in love." I put both my hands on his shoulders, so he knows what I'm saying is important. "You’ve been burned enough, my dear sweet Sherlock, now it's time to fly." That's enough seriousness for now. "Go. Change. I'll get this room clean."
"She has a car?" There's no keys but there is something. "Sherlock." I point out a cup of cold 'soother' tea next to the doily Sherlock made her when he was infiltrating a craft group he suspected of killing their husbands. It didn't matter how many times I told him that men in their older nineties would easily have a heart attack when taking knock off Viagra they got online to sleep with their thirty-something mistresses.
"Gregory." I enter his chambers wearing naught but the dressing gown that he prefers. "Would you like a massage tonight?" I loosen the tie on the robe and let it slip open a bit. "Or would you prefer something else?"
"Nah. I'll take care of that Princess myself." I finally take pity on him and eye the biscuits wantonly. "A few of those would go a long ways. You always make the best sweets."
I am most happy to oblige him, and close my eyes with a moan as my hand moves over the hard flesh. Even with my eyes closed, I can feel him watching me with rapt attention.
My abs are starting to ache, but I just can't get enough. I thrust up as hard as I can, my hand squeezing and gripping his cock as we stroke it together. "You like this." I say breathlessly, the hand on his hip gently pulling him, rocking him so that I'm pounding his prostate with every thrust. "You're too good to me, sir... too... good," I groan, shaking with the effort of holding back my own pleasure for his.
I'm dancing and having a good time. This is new. I nod to Mum, Sis, and a few business associates as I pass. Everyone is looking at my escort. "You never did tell me more about you. What do you do? How long have you lived here?"
It takes me a moment to find my voice. "Y-yes... there are a number of oils in her apothecary cabinet... what kind do you want?"
I squirm beneath his grasp, and manage to slip my hand between us, wrapping my long fingers around both our cocks as they rub together.
"Mmph," I mumble, careful not to glare at him as I clean up with the cold flannel. "You're lucky you're so damn adorable," I say under my breath.
"You’re having a go at me, aren’t you. That’s not funny." No... ? "I assumed she invested well or maybe inherited this place."
"If I were to come back here for drinks it wouldn't be with you dear one." I chuckle at his disgusted face. "Come on." It takes only a few moments to walk to the shop and pick up my car. All eyes are on us when we get out of my brand new 68 Corvette Hard Top Convertible.
"I'll take you to my rooms. Mum, we'll see you at diner." I'll need to arrange to get the rest of his stuff. Oh... "How do you feel ‘bout asking your new employee, who happens to head Security, to get your things for you?" I ask with a smirk.
I nudge the tray away from his hand. "I think you've had enough honeycakes, Jimmy. Save some for tomorrow." I set down my cup of tea. "Now you - you seem to have a decent business head on your shoulders. How are things going for you?"
In an attempt to stretch out the experience I turn us again so he's on top. I thrust up into him in counterpoint to his rocking.
Your instincts are good. He was with the 19th, but not as a corporal. His real name is Sebastian Moran. Colonel Sebastian Moran.
"No, not really." I shrug. "Everything gets done..." I've put in more effort in the last 12 hours than I do in most weeks at home. "Despite my brother's letter, I can tell you the family doesn't need my support."
"You. Noticed. Me. You noticed a small change based on humidity in the air. That may be the most romantic thing I've ever heard of."
"It's not uncommon for guards to travel in groups, John. There's safety in numbers, especially in a forest such as this one." I look at him somewhat numbly.
I check him for injuries from his slip down the out cropping. "I could have told you I smelled smoke from the north. How far do you suppose we are?" I estimate we are an hour's walk at most.
I take his hand and get up behind him. "I'm sorry. That was rude of me." I put my hands lightly on his hips.
I seize the moment and reach up to grab his tunic. "You are entirely too dressed," I growl, pulling the tunic and vest off in one movement. Sitting up on the edge of the bed, I grab his arse and pull him to me, licking over his stiff nipples.
"Are you not allowed to shop alone? Or talk to people? What the hell is wrong with him?" I start to get angry remembering all the things Sherlock has alluded to about his brother.
I pull him forward a little, letting his knees rest against the mattress between my thighs, but don't relent.
"Yes! You are the one not taking it!" I cease fighting and go limp. "I am saying, with this ring, that you are my family. You, and William when we find him, are the only family I have or will ever want."
"I'll have you know, I've been cooking for myself for a long time. Haven't poisoned anyone yet." I give him a cheeky grin as I pull the fish off the fire. After letting it cool a bit, I hand a fish to him on one of the small plates he thoughtfully packed, and sit back with my own, watching him decide if he's going to attempt to eat.
I pull him into my bedroom and close the door behind us. "If you want to continue, may I suggest we not talk about my brother right now?" I lean in to kiss him - more boldly than before.
"No. This is not ok. I won fair and square." Martha smacks my hand so I sit back down. I glare at Sebastian for his mutinous behaviour. I mouth the words "you're dead" but the bastard only shrugs.
"Are you sure? We recently discovered that our hostess has skewed our impression of the passage of time, remember?" I lean up and kiss him lightly on the lips.
"A poker player you are not. Maybe it is because you believe your own lies. You wonder what will change when we return. You question if I will continue our arrangement now that no money will be exchanged."
"You have me. However you want. Just tell me how." I run my hands up and down his sides. There's too many ways that request could be construed for me to hazard a guess.
"We are a matched set, are we not? One idiot determined to save the other." I relax into his hold. "In this case there are two idiots."
"In have other friends but they're not as fun as Lock. I have my very own goldfish, his name is Seb, you should meet him. I'll have him come over for dinner tonight. Won't that be fun?" I text Seb a note about dinner and to bring the good wine. "And I have Eurus but she's... She's not always there one might say."
"Oh a bit of this. A dash of that. Just a simple stew." I hand him a bowl and fresh bread roll. "Eat. You look hungry. So skinny. Your John must not be too good of a hunter or you wouldn't be so thin."
"I was thinking ‘bout that. I could ask Irene to show me what parts of the deer she wants preserved. You can get the potions then. After you're done and she comes back in you can meet me outside. We'll leave while she thinks we're cleaning the carcass." It seemed a safe enough plan that even Sherlock shouldn't be able to put himself in danger.
I pull up until only a few inches are in my mouth. I scissor my fingers so that his prostate is being constantly stimulated. His body is starting to tremble in its voracious need to get off. I look up at his face and his pupils are blown so wide that his eyes almost look black. A brief image of a Demon with an Angel's Halo flashes across my mind. I want to whisper words of encouragement but more I want to taste him when he cums. All I can do for now is moan to show my appreciation of this experience.
"I don't really know. It's so dark I can't even see my own hand in front of my face. You're welcome to come back here, out of the wind."
I grab his hand, pressing it flat against my hip. "That tickles, John..." OK, it doesn't actually tickle, but he really needs to stop doing it.
"How are you frustrating? Besides running away... Or avoiding answering questions... Or... Never mind." I'll take this up with Mycroft later.
"But she made it very clear she does not approve of me... for all I knew, she was going to throw me in jail... or worse." I shrug. "Better I remain unknown, in that case, don't you think?"
I reach two spit slicked fingers behind his balls and stroke upwards against his perineum to stimulate that spot inside him. His dick starts to throb in my mouth.
My moan is loud enough that the neighbors may have heard it. I stumble a bit and try to right myself but that's damn near impossible when a mouth made from the gods is sucking my brain out from my dick. I end up hunched over him with my hands on his shoulders to keep from falling over.
"Why? Because you've succeeded in embarrassing the family? Look at this one - 'WAR HERO WALTZ - At last night's masquerade ball, Lord Watson's time on the dance floor was monopolized by a certain unknown gentleman. Requests for more information about this mystery man have not been answered, but rumor has it, he is a commoner from a neighboring village.'" I roll my eyes at him. "People are going to talk, John."
I quickly grab one of the blankets and wrap it around him. "Can't have you catching your death out here..." I murmur as I use the blanket to dry him and keep him warm. I quickly slip back into my own clothes, and drape a blanket around myself, too - it has become decidedly chill, since the sun began to set. "If we hurry, we should be able to get back to our camp site - and get a nice fire going - before it's completely dark." We make sure we everything in hand, and quickly find our way back. In short order, I'm able to get a nice warm fire going, and I sit beside Mycroft on the sleeping mat.
"John, Mrs. Hudson hasn't brought up biscuits this morning. Can you go down and get them?" I call from my chair in the living room.
"Oh Thank You Your Highness." I bow for added sarcastic effect. "I'm so glad you've decided not to freeze to death."
His eyes sparkle like they did when he ate that peach, its as if his eyes are saying 'this is a happy story?' His kiss plumped lips are better than I imagined they would be. As I go to kiss him again I am sprung by a spring. "Ouch." The offending piece of metal jabbed itself into my bad leg.
"Yes. Please. Your tea is the bestest." My head feels fuzzy. "But don't tell Sebby I said that. Shh."
"Afraid? No." Nervous, petrified, concerned, prepared for the worst. "I'm sure it will be palatable."
"Just curious." My heart, and I do have one, sinks a bit knowing he calls others by the same names. "Yes, I believe the cliff is where you said." His wrists rest on my thigh cause a conditioned response that will hopefully not become apparent.
I look at the biscuit, and my stomach growls. "No, I shouldn't, My Lord, it's your last one. You take it." I reply, trying not to sound disappointed. "I know the baker, do I?"
My head falls back as he rides me hard. The rough treatment takes my breath away, the pleasure building very slowly. Every time he sees a glimmer of it on my face, he changes his movements - both to his benefit and my detriment. I growl in frustration, glaring at him.
"I could, perhaps, make sure she sleeps VERY soundly." I start going through my mental catalog of herbs, thinking about what I have quick access to in her kitchen. There are a few combinations that might work and might not be terribly obvious to her. "That would be helpful when we leave, after all."
"Since I was sixteen or so. Left home, was in the army for a bit, got injured, now I do hunting in winter and other odd jobs." I notice my tea is empty when I go to take another sip. "That was much more than you asked. I don't usually ramble like this. Could I get a spot more tea?'
I unfold my arms and place my hands on his hips. "If that's the case, Mycie, let me help you dress."
"I'm sure." I suddenly realize my state of dress - or lack thereof. "Greg, my offer of dinner still stands. It sounds like you'd like to avoid your shop for a while anyway."
"He should be down in a few minutes." I hand Greg two bags of biscuits. "Give one of those to the Royal family, will you?"
Pfft. "Promises, promises, Gregory." I pull him down for a rough kiss. "Prove to me that you're half as good as they say you are. " I purr in his ear.
"I would appreciate the guidance, as I'm... well, I've never..." I blush furiously. "But I don't need a running narrative."
"Wha- jealous? Really?" My eyes are glittering with amusement when Jim and Seb walk back into the kitchen and take a seat at the table.
I am watching the blissful look on his face as he rocks his hips, letting me take more into my mouth, when suddenly he pulls away entirely, climbing off my chest and laying beside me, finally letting go of my wrists to stroke himself suggestively.
"Well, when you say you are going to 'set up a bed' I assume you have appropriate materials to do so." I shrug. I have a feeling my books have missed some important data points.
I hesitate, but take off my jacket, laying it out beside his. "Why are you taking off more clothes? The layers are supposed to keep you from becoming hypothermic..." I ask curiously.
I call Mycroft, rather than text. As soon as he answers, I begin to speak. "Look for records relating to a Sebastian Kalay." A pause. "No, I don't know how to spell it, but I'm suspecting it's a derivative of Charles." Another pause. "Fine. Send me the information as soon as you can."
"An interesting problem. If I were a minor, I wouldn't likely have pointed out the adult who brought me here, allowing me to partake of champagne and other spirits, would I? Law enforcement never looks kindly on someone who contributes to the delinquency of a minor, after all." I smile back him. "But, if that doesn't convince you, you'll just have to take my word for it." I put my hand out for the beer.
I let out a cry at the last impact, my last shred of control gone. "14... Thank you, sir," I sob, my whole body trembling at this point.
"I'm not your housekeeper!" Pfft. The nerve! "Jamie and I talked. If the poor boy hadn't been so sad about his friend ignoring him he wouldn't have had to resort to bringing me here."
"I wasn't talking about her, or right after we get her back. I was talking about..." It's no use. He's already on his phone again, wait that's my phone. "So, what's the connection between Kale and The Wolf?"
His breath on my neck makes me curl my toes. "What..." My eyes flutter closed and I moan. I never realized how sensitive my neck was. Of course, no one like John has ever taken an interest in it like this, either. "What else?"
I chuckle nervously. "My first name actually is William, but I go by my middle name, Sherlock. My full name is William Sherlock Scott Holmes." I look at him. "You are angry with me."
The thought of someone, anyone, else cooking makes me shudder. I have been cooking for myself and family since I was seven and my real Mother passed away. By the time Gregory returns I've stoked the fire, fixed the bedding, fed Daisy, and nearly succumbed to death my boredom.
I hear the blond one - John - come out of the bedroom and settle himself by the fire. I walk quietly up behind the chair and reach over it, rest my hands softly on his shoulders. "Feeling better, are you? Let me take a look at your ankle, hm?" I walk around the chair, never taking my hand off his shoulder until I kneel by his bandaged foot.
I stop moving the moment he says to wait. "Tell me Sherlock. What do you want?" He is still thrusting into his own hand and the sight is bloody fantastic. His naked body flushed, back arched, his hand on his cock, bottom lip being bite... "What my love?"
Moran startles me when he tries to make small talk. It takes a moment for me to respond. "I wouldn't know. I haven't slept on the couch in C before. You should ask Sherlock." I happen to glance at Moriarty as a piece of potato flies off his plate and hits Mrs. Hudson's tea and spills all over Lock's lap.
Don't just see, observe "Looks like he's holding her to make sure she doesn't fall. She's grabbing his coat to keep from tripping. Her feet are in house slippers. That's all I see. 'Cept the obvious of course. I assumed you didn't need me to point out the wolf tail attached to his jacket." I squint as I look closer. "Hey. That's a Belstaff just like yours. I think you even have that shirt."
"NoPe," I say it just like him. "I asked about renting a flat in the building, and he said Mrs. H was 'out', but that's all."
"Sure... thanks..." I try to calmly set down my cup and not run from the kitchen. As soon as I'm out of her sight, I nearly sprint to our room, closing the door behind me.
I am waiting for John in my drawing room - hopefully, a comfortable enough locale for meeting the men lined up outside. "Now, John, the security team will allow one man at a time to come in, and you can speak to him if you wish. Do what you need to do to see if he is, indeed, your Phoenix." I point to my desk, where the delicate black-and-red feathered mask sits. "If you think it's him, have him try on the mask, as well. The final decision is yours."
I at once terrified and desperate to have him inside me. I take a deep breath and slowly lower myself onto him. I feel Mycroft's lips trace over my jaw, whispering encouragement as I move, ever so slowly.
"Must be why we get along so well." We've come to a fork in the path, and I stop for a moment. "Let's go down this path. I hear water nearby - he might have thought to follow it."
I place one of my hands over his and play with his hair with the other. "We also had a lot less clothes. It was so hard for me to not to pull you closer and have my wicked way with you." I kiss his forehead and take a moment to just breath him in. "Did you use some cleaning product today? You smell divine."
"Isn't that the whole point of this party? For you to be able to get to know people for who they are, not what they look like?"
I crack an eye open to glare at him. "Pfft. I'm not high... I was high. And we didn't smoke it. She makes these ah-may-zing honey cakes. And her tea is sooo good."
I wake up with a start, to find that John is not in the room. Worried, I climb out of bed and tiptoe to the door, only to find That Woman kissing John breathless, right there in front of the fire. I clear my throat loudly.
I clap my hands in glee. "Excellent. So, finish up your dinner. I made dessert, but you don't get any if you don't clean your plates."
"Sleep, yes. That's what you two did so loudly in your flat," I frown. "I'm sure you would have woken his boyfriend if you went to his flat." I lift myself off her desk. "If you could get me that phone number soon, that would be brilliant." I breeze out of her office as suddenly as I arrived.
I sort through the pile of clothes I'm huddled under, and pick out mine, putting them on while exposing as little skin as possible to the cool cave air. "I read something the stars being used as navigational tools once. I don't know how to do it though... must've forgotten it." I pull my boots back on and shiver. "How far is it?"
"Oh, I'm too old to work for someone else, dearie. Besides," I set down my teacup and look him in the eye. "My residual income takes care of my needs. I have no need of work... I quite enjoy just looking after my boys."
"Really now? What else did that wo--- Irene, suggest?" That smile of his is like a siren's call to my groin.
"With my brother there? It's a bit early for you to be drinking, isn't it, Greg?" I roll my eyes. "Besides, I've got plenty to do here - easier with His Stubbornness out of the house."
"You wanna be helpful? Tell me which pony gonna take it next Sunday. Not that I'd believe ya, but might make me 'member a bit."
"Please, John. I'm sure she will want to get home as soon as possible. Even she would be rattled by such events." I shake my head.
I try to untuck the blanket so I can be the one who sleeps on the floor. "I can sleep on the floor. I'm good with that."
"No matter. Not in the cards for me anymore." I get up, wanting to exit this conversation more than anything. I walk over and check Daisy's ties, making sure she's secured for the night.
I suddenly find myself with my back to the wall, the near-total darkness limiting my sight, so my other senses take over. I feet the warmth of John's fingers, the whisper of his breath as he speaks to me softly. I tremble as he gently slides my mask up and hear him take off his own. "I... I suppose I should... give myself permission..." my voice is hardly more than a whisper.
I roll out the meager padding and start to prepare two sleeping mats but there is only enough material for one.
I look at him confused. "Jim? From last Christmas? No. He was a bit weird for me. Something was just off about him." Didn't help that his boyfriend didn't like me much.
"I am aware of that. I am also aware that although you had your cane with you when you met me by the fountain, you left it lying in the brush when we hid to dodge my... that Red Ferret and the Silver Fox. Since then we've walked the grounds and done a fair amount of dancing, and you've not limped even once." I smile.
John shifts, and his hips rub up against me, and now I'm wide awake, and thinking inappropriate thoughts again. Sheesh. "John, please hold still... we both need to get some sleep..." I mumble against the back of his neck.
"Quite a bit of work just to eat. The flavor is wonderful." I get another bone stuck in my gum and have to stop to pull it out. I set the fish aside and make note to insist I cook next time.
"Lower your voice!" I hiss at him angrily. "This is still my house." I take a deep breath, calming myself. "You hardly know this... person. You can't have developed an attachment to him so quickly."
I intersperse our kisses with my own observations of him. "When you smile the left side of your mouth goes up slightly more than the right." I lean down to kiss his neck before I gently nip his ear. "You prefer sweeter fruit in the evening." I kiss my way across his jaw to the other side. "You'll choose coffee over tea but you know that I prefer tea so you drink it without complaint." I kiss down his neck to graze my teeth on his collar bone. "You are developing silver in your hair even though you've not reached thirty years of age."
I watch his thumb smoothing over the back of my hand, then realize he's stopped talking. "What? Hungry? Yes, definitely. What do you have in mind?" I can't imagine we're going to take off for the nearest pub...
I pull him down to lay his head on my lap so I can pet his hair. "Ok, you're not answering so I'm going to assume you haven't read much." His reticence makes me nervous in a weird over-protective way. "Sex is a lot like what we did last night, and started this morning, but instead of oral, it's... umm... Not oral." I'm grateful he can't see my blush.
I am able to let him come up for air once more before I push him back down, his moaníng around my cock enough to put me over the edge. I let go of his head when I cum, and his throat strokes me through as he swallows it all. Sated, I relax limply against the headboard as he crawls back up the bed to nestle alongside me.
"That sounds like a perfectly good compromise, John. What do you think, Sherlock? Jim? Will you two behave long enough to do that?"
"He loved fairy tales. Said they were the best riddles of all. Whatever that means. He was always going on about how the villain isn't always a villain. Sometimes it's a misunderstood anti-hero. I mean, I could see his point sometimes, but those stories are for kids. You know?" This is quite possible the longest conversation I've had with Sherlock about someone other than Sherlock. Every time he opens his mouth I expect the insult to come out but it's just more talk about Jim. "Anyways, I'm done with him. I've moved on."
I pull him down into a rough kiss, wrapping my arm tightly around his waist as I stand up, turn, and set him on the rocky ledge where I'd been sitting, before pulling away. I slide onto his lap. "Are you?" I whisper in his ear.
I drag my fingers along his rapidly-hardening cock. "Me? A tease? Perish the thought..." I smile up at him.
I bend over to tend the fire for a moment, providing John with an excellent view in the process, of course. "You are not a bother in the least. I enjoy your company. How long have you been travelling?" I ask politely.
"I'm sorry, Mycroft, but we can't afford to support him any longer." Mummy Holmes sighs. "Ever since your father died, things have been tight. Now that Sherlock is old enough, he needs to either contribute to the family financially, or marry, if he wants to stay. Since he refuses either, there's no other choice."
"Busy. Go get them yourself." Brat knows I'm doing dishes which is a bit more important than sitting on a chair waiting for a nice old lady to bring tea and biscuits.
Just as the tea is done a nice young man enters the kitchen. "Oh. You must be Jimmy's boyfriend. Aren't you adorable. Tea?"
"Did someone tell you that?" He and my therapist would get along fabulously. Maybe he should go next time.
I follow him inside and head towards the kitchen to make lunch. "Hey, Myc, c'mere." The kitchen is messier than I've ever seen it. A mostly baked cake is still in its pan on the stove top and the back door is propped open a bit.
"Sh'lock," I call out hoarsely, "where are you?" My voice barely above a whisper. "Sh'lock... Shhhllll."
I walk into the living room and give him a stern look. "According to our little wager, they have until about 6:30 this evening, dearie."
