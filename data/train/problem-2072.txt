‘Well, yes, you didn’t seem - ‘
I felt an irrational anger at the girl before me, who had in a matter of weeks seen as much of Holmes’ heart as I had seen in half a lifetime of friendship
‘Watching you. When you do this.’
‘We walked and talked for ages, every night. I’m not usually that much for talking, ‘cept as now, of course,’ and here she looked at me a little embarrassed, ‘but... you know as when your wif someone and its like you’ve known them ages, like... its comfy, you know.’ She looked to me again and I stared back in surprise. I knew exactly what she meant, but I would never have expected anyone else to describe Holmes’ company in that way. I reminded myself that the stage had lost a fine actor the day Sherlock Holmes turned to detection.
Holmes was frozen in place, wide eyed and unresponsive. His voice, when it eventually came, was so quiet I could barely hear it.
Without turning, he walked into his room, and closed the door.
My choked off words caught Holmes attention and I felt his focus shift to me across the table. ‘Ah. An acquaintance, I perceive. Not recent. A medical man, so once a colleague. Not in practice, so from your army days. Afghanis-‘
John snaps, ‘What’s the matter with you?’
I frowned. ‘I’m fine.’ The weight of his hand on my arm. I felt a smaller hand in its place. Will she be alright, Doctor? A small trusting face gazing into mine. God, how they had cried, her children. The look of betrayal on the littlest girl’s face. There was nothing I could have done, I had wanted to say. Nothing. I took a breath. ‘I’m fine.’ I repeated quietly.
, I thought, and cast a quick glance in the direction of his room. To my surprise, his door was open, and man himself was on the threshold staring with wide eyes at our guest, who remained unaware of his presence, positioned as she was with her back to the detective. Before I could open my mouth to introduce him, he shot me a wary glance and retreated.
He continued. ‘It was a ruse. To gain the young lady’s sympathy.’
‘Of course I would have wanted.’ I said with certainty. ‘But I didn’t know. I didn’t know that this was even possible. How could I have hoped for this?’ I drew his face to mine and kissed him lightly, still glorying in the freedom to do so. He made to speak and I stopped him, brushing my fingers against his lips. ‘If there is blame to be laid then it must be mine also. It took two virtual strangers to show me what was in front of me all the time.’ My voice began to shake slightly as I continued, ‘Your genius lies in deduction, in logic. I am supposed to be the one who understands the softer emotions, but without Miss Robson I would never have spoken, and without James I would never have realised-‘ I stopped, suddenly, absurdly – given our intimate situation – feeling exposed.
I made a mental note to relay a slightly edited version of this compliment to our landlady at the first available opportunity. Praise from Holmes was always worthy of record.
‘What what is like?’ He is deducing me again. ‘John. Tell me.’
I said, ‘He is well. And I do believe he is happy, yes.’ On impulse I added, ‘We both are.’
‘I will fetch Stamford.’ He rises with decision.
I try not to sound bitter as I say lightly, ‘Perhaps I grew tired of watching and wanted the experience for myself. You made this particular cocktail sound most enticing – morphine and cocaine, in such precise amounts.’
I held back a smile. Holmes’ last case had required extensive use, not only of the irregulars, whose attendance alone was usually enough to excite our usually imperturbable landlady, but of various boat builders and dock workers whose presence had eventually driven Mrs Hudson to complain loudly and at length to Holmes about the standing and reputation of this household in the eyes of the neighbours, and the difficulties of removing dockside mud from the carpets.
Mrs Hudson sighed. ‘A missing person, she says. Not worth Mr Holmes attention, I’m sure, but this is the third time she has been here, so I said I would speak to you, if only to be rid of her.’
Holmes spoke after a short pause. ‘As you wish.’ He returned to his post.
We entered Baker Street together to be greeted in the hallway by a stern-faced Mrs Hudson. She addressed Lestrade firmly. ‘Mr Holmes has given strict instructions that he is not to be disturbed this afternoon.’ Her voice assumed the tone of one quoting, ‘He is undertaking some delicate and time sensitive chemical reactions.’ My spirits sank. Still, I had not had a chance to read today’s paper, so at least I would be entertained whilst I was overlooked all afternoon.
I hesitated, seeking a gentle way to phrase the question I needed to ask. ‘Forgive me, Miss Robson, but is it possible that Mr Escott disappeared simply because he did not wish to.... pursue the engagement?’
Now it was my turn to stare in disbelief. After a moment he continued, in a softer tone. ‘I came back to London, you know, when my tour of duty concluded. I wanted to see you. Make sure that civilian life was treating you well.’ He addressed this to the fire. ‘It was after your first few cases had been published in the Strand. I read them. I concluded that my presence would be....unnecessary, shall we say.’
His eyes open in horror as I jam the needle into my arm. As I depress the plunger I feel a slight pressure beneath my skin as the liquid enters my veins. I can hear my blood rushing in my ears and for a brief moment I am afraid. Then peculiar kind of peace descends with the knowledge that whatever happens now is unstoppable.
He is wide eyed. ‘Watson. You are…. frightening me.’ His voice is unsteady, and lower than I have heard it before.
Sherlock lifts his chin, says, ‘A fellow army man. Not a medic, a soldier. Assigned with you in Afghanistan. Died there. Important to you, since you have his dog tags.’ He stops, as if choosing his next words with care.
I left Raleigh Street late the following morning. I knew I needed to return to Baker Street and face Holmes but my conversation with James had given me much to ponder. The late autumnal weather had turned London's parks into a riot of colour and natural beauty but I walked unseeing through it all. To my own surprise, I had slept, when exhaustion from the emotional stress of the last few days had finally overcome me, but I felt far from rested. Taking a meandering route home through Regent’s Park, I sat on a bench near the lake and stared out over the water.
He caught my intent and tightened his grip, holding me against him before I could draw away again.
‘Er - okay. If you’re sure -’
. I hoped the sound of pieces falling together in my brain wasn’t audible in the room. This was worse than I had feared. The poor girl was hoping to engage the services of Sherlock Holmes to find Escott the plumber, an alias of....Sherlock Holmes.
I said quietly. ‘He is good man. I would even say a great one. I have never known anyone like him.’ There was an absurd catch in my throat as I added. ‘I just don’t know if I can live with him.’
‘No!’ I say emphatically. ‘Just the –‘ I wave my hand ‘– effects are different. But this –‘I put my hand over my heart, without releasing his ‘– is the same. I hate it. Please stop. Please.’
He is afraid for me, as I had hoped he would be. He looks pale. Too pale. His hands are unsteady. I feel a spark of guilt. He is my friend and I am making him unhappy. But no, this is the aim of the exercise. I have become distracted. I intended to say things. My good mood slips and I frown in concentration.
‘God, do you talk to Holmes like that? No wonder he loves you.’ I blinked. ‘Well,’ he continued. ‘I won’t argue too hard against your flattering portrayal. But you do place me in an invidious position, my friend.’
‘Ah.’ Was all he said. Then, awkwardly; ‘You would not like to retire ….with me?’ He flashed me a quick half smile.
His eyes widened. ‘A week? You exaggerate, Watson.’
John swallows hard, says, and his voice still doesn’t sound like his own, ‘Accurate now?’
He swirled the dark liquid in his glass and regarded it as he said quietly, ‘Is it Holmes?’
‘Wh-,’ began Lestrade.
All pretence was gone now and he looked at me, directly, seriously, and his eyes were sombre.
‘Well Watson, it was as I feared. An abysmally average performance delivered to rapturous applause. I was invited backstage afterwards, but I made my excuses and left. Really, it was too much.’ He reappeared, cravat and cufflinks also removed, pulling on his smoking jacket. ‘I’m sure compliments would have been expected and even my acting skills were not equal to the task.’
‘Oh, there’s no need to bother yourself Doctor, not on your day off. I shall simply tell her that Mr Holmes is far too busy with more exalted clientele’ - a muffled thump and a curse from the direction of Holmes’ room – ‘to take on such a case.’
hurt.
I said simply, ‘Can you doubt it?’
‘Oh.’
‘Good afternoon, Doctor.’
‘Well,’ he said quietly, waving a hand. ‘It is done. We should not-‘
‘I must catch a cab or I’ll be late. Good evening Watson.’ He barely spared our client a glance. ‘Miss Robson.’ She gaped at him, her hard fought courage temporarily deserting her, and sank quietly into the dining chair behind her.
‘Then what?’ He was twisting the pipe in his hands, an anxious gesture that reminded me oddly of her.
I flushed. ‘James-‘
John says, ‘These aren’t about you. Or – or Adam. Or Mary. They’re about me. My life. My survival. The people l lo- ’ He breaks off.
On this otherwise quiet day, Holmes, with unusual sociability, had accepted an invitation to attend a charity concert hosted by a former client of ours, on the promise that the soloist was a violinist of world class renown, of whom I had not heard, but whose name made Holmes’ eyes light up.
'...my dear Watson, do you imagine I have no respect for your medical talents? At four yards I could deceive you. If I failed to do so, who would bring Smith within my grasp?’
Holmes crossed to his room, and I turned my gaze to my desk, pulling out some files of old case notes, determined to make constructive use of my time. I heard Holmes clear his throat as I opened the first file. There wasn’t enough to make a complete story in any of these cases, but perhaps a series of vignettes....
‘This is what it’s like.’ I whisper urgently. The room is so, so bright, but I can’t take my eyes from his face.
I moved him back towards the bed. As we sank onto it, he drew my nightshirt away with shaking hands. His hands roamed my back, arms and sides, uncertain, exploring. As our naked bodies came together on the bed we were both trembling. I kissed him with a fervour which was returned in kind, catching his lip between mine as my hand roamed to his nipple, rubbing and pinching gently. His gasp was lost in my mouth as my hand roamed lower, glorying in his smooth skin.
I opened my mouth to protest, but he continued, ‘Understand, Watson, that I did not know.’ He looked at me again then, a plea for clemency, and I had to fight the urge to move closer, to reassure. ‘I thought that with your marriage, you would not feel the loss of a friend so deeply. Had I known the grief I would cause, I would never have-‘ He broke off, worrying at the skin between his eyebrows with his long fingers as if trying to physically erase the lines there. ‘I-‘ he broke off again, and addressed the carpet at my feet. ‘I missed you terribly. You can have no idea how often I wished to see you, to speak to you.’
I summoned a weak smile. ‘Forgive me, my mind wandered for a moment.’ I rallied myself. ‘May I ask then, Miss Robson, if you do not wish to continue the engagement, and you believe Mr Escott did not love you, why you want to find him?’
He misunderstood. ‘I realise you suffered far more, but,’ he clenched his fists ‘- I did not know. How could I hope, how could I imagine that you would….do me the honour…of grieving for me as….as…’
Holmes was standing by the fire, one arm resting on the mantle, staring into the flames. He didn't move as I entered and I was surprised to see him fully dressed in his grey morning suit. His usual habit at this time of the day would be to have donned his smoking jacket, or even his dressing gown, in preparation to retire. He was still far too thin, and exceptionally pale. I remembered Mrs Hudson's claim that he hadn't eaten, and frowned. It was still too soon after his self-imposed ordeal to trap Culverton Smith for him to be refusing food. This concern pushed the thoughts of my carefully devised apology from my mind, and I opened my mouth to insist that he have at least some of the food our landlady had left on the table before we spoke.
he is. ‘Do it again.’
He was still holding himself like an animal at bay. ‘What is it then? Enlighten me.’
‘What did she say?’
‘I think,’ I say with certainty, ‘that you should have the full drug addict experience. And that means watching. With no intervention.’ I smile at him again, and he stares back in angry disbelief, his former lethargy fallen away.
‘Now,’ I continued gently, ‘you were saying?’
She continued, ‘An’ when I hugged ‘im, he held himself all stiff at first, but then he held me so tight, it was like no-one never held ‘im at all.’
‘Holmes,' I began. My tone was clearly sharper than I intended, for he visibly started at my voice. Seeing how close to the edge of his nerves he was, I began in a softer tone. ‘Holmes, you really should...'
I gave her weak smile in return.
I gave him a weak smile. ‘Thank you.’
He said quietly, ‘Be quick, John.’
‘Holmes, it matters to me. I am your friend. If something is making you unhappy, and I can help-‘
She took a breath, ‘It’s only right to say that I ‘ad recently split with Harry, the baker’s lad what brought the morning delivery, but he was still hopeful. And I tole John – Mr Escott – that, straight from the off, I said so.’ She looked at me as if I would challenge her honesty in this regard and I nodded hastily.
I said, ‘There is nothing-‘
, I thought, giving her a tight, virtue-approving smile.
Then: ‘Since - when?’
‘Watson! This is a wholly unexpected pleasure.’ He ushered me to a chair in front of the fire, into which I sank gratefully. ‘Can I tempt you?’ He gestured with his own half empty brandy glass.
His face tightened. ‘I can hardly be held responsible for the romantic fancies of women.’
Holmes’ voice came from behind me. ‘Watson.’
, I wanted to say,
I stood frozen, listening to the sound of my breathing. Sounds drifted in from the street outside, people living their normal lives, whilst mine fell apart around me. I fought the impulse to flee Baker Street. Instead, I crossed the room before my courage could fail me and knocked on the closed door.
He said, uncertainly, ‘You...would not have wanted...’
‘And this person is...?’
‘Would you thank Mr Holmes for me? I ‘ope as how he didn’t go to any trouble for me, as ‘e was so kind not to take no fee, and to find John- ‘
‘I – I see.’ I said. She looked from me to my notebook on the table, expectantly, and I obediently lowered my head and wrote,
I spoke around a lump in my throat. ‘I will put the case to Mr Holmes. Is there an address we can write to you?’
I stared back in nightshirt, slippers, and dressing gown, at nearly midnight. He didn’t need to be Sherlock Holmes. ‘Yes.’ I said patiently.
‘Oh good God man, do you have to be so bloody-‘ I cut myself off. ‘Holmes, this isn’t pity, if you see nothing else, see that.’
I started. ‘What?’
‘No. We didn't. Not today.' He put his other hand on mine. ‘But we will. Another day. Not every day will be like this, John.'
I do.’
I laughed. ‘I’m afraid you can’t get out of the concert now, old chap. Besides, you’ll only intimidate the poor girl. Now hurry, or you’ll miss the start.’
‘I know,’ I said patiently, ‘but there may be no need for you to do so. Mr Holmes was consulted by the police on the matter of Mr Milverton’s death, and it may be that enquiries he has already made will allow us to find your answer.’
So, he does. More confidently, this time, pressing his lips more firmly against Sherlock’s. He slips a hand around Sherlock’s waist, pulling them closer together, and cards the other through that ridiculous hair, which as it turns out, was absolutely made for this sort of thing. Sherlock has leaned only a little more into the kiss this time, still not really reacting, and John is just beginning to worry that this is a mistake, when Sherlock gets with the programme. All at once, and with characteristic energy. His arms go around John, pulling him flush against Sherlock’s body, and John is being kissed back with the kind of ferocious passion he wouldn’t have credited to his flatmate. John Watson has never gone weak at the knees in his life, and fortunately he has plausible deniability on this occasion as Sherlock’s grip on him is the embrace of a man concerned that if he lets go the loved thing will be ripped away.
Sherlock keeps hold and he ends up almost ripping them from his flatmate’s hand. 'Sherlock, what the hell? They’re
My hand reached its destination and I stroked along his length. He gave a cry and arched against me. His free hand grasped mine, halting my movement. ‘The sensation,’ he gasped. ‘Oh god, John, it’s too much.’  I rested my hand on his hardening length, and used my free hand to push his hair away where it had fallen across his forehead, lightly kissing his neck. It my wildest dreams I had not imagined him this responsive; it was almost unbearably arousing.
Holmes nodded. ‘Good. I did advise Miss Robson away from Mr Stokes, although I could hardly hope she would heed my advice. Young women are exceptionally single minded in such matters. Anstruther is remarkably pig-headed and has an eye for the ladies, but I believe those to be the worst of his faults. Nothing Miss Robson won’t be able to manage.’
He was sitting on the edge of his bed, his head in his hands. Before I could think about it, I crossed the floor and knelt in front of him.
‘She wishes us to track down Mr Escott.’ He leaned back on the settee, closing his eyes and pressing a hand to his forehead. ‘I do not believe my deductive skills will be equal to the task.’
On his slim form the space between his hips was almost concave. He held his breath as I caressed the area, moving closer to his stiffening member but not touching. I bent my head to his nipple, kissing and sucking, and he released a long, shuddering breath that was almost a moan.
I looked up. ‘What?’
He is kneeling before me now, staring into my eyes, checking my pupils as he passes his hand over my forehead. His touch leaves sparks of sensation over my skin and I fight the sudden urge to laugh with glee. I move my head to follow his hand and he looks at me in alarm.
I smiled. ‘And a great friend.’
I sat forward, bringing myself closer to him, and lowering my voice. ‘Holmes. She said that –‘ I coughed, ‘that is….she was very concerned for you – for Escott. She was quite convinced that he – that you – loved someone that you couldn’t have.’ The words came out in a rush. ‘That you were, somehow…. deprived of physical affection.’
James raised his eyes to the ceiling. ‘I only have your stories to go by of course, but he doesn’t strike me as the sort of man who touches people a great deal. Certainly not voluntarily.’
He whispered, ‘No.’
‘It is to me.’
Sherlock draws back just enough to see his face. ‘Whatever you want, John.’
But he is, after all, Sherlock Holmes. I could not believe that I truly kept anything hidden from him. I had assumed that, in the turmoil of emotions that followed his return, somehow, at some time, I had betrayed myself, and that Holmes was aware of my feelings, and my thoughts, and had - I hoped – forgiven and accepted them, and chosen not to act upon them, as they were not reciprocated.
‘You are still cold. Your room will be cold.’ He brought my hand to his face. My fingers were cold against the warmth of his cheek. ‘You should stay in mine.’
The detective bursts out, ‘You weren’t with me. You were
The days that followed, in any other circumstance, would have been unbearably awkward. But we were fighting to save lives, against terrible odds, and there was no time for my anxiety and fear about the night before to take hold. Our lives went on as before, but we still lost more than we saved, and even those we saved were often ruined men. And sometimes, after the worst days, in the seclusion of his room, we found comfort in each other again.
‘Yes.’ His response was immediate. ‘Yes, I do, I  still wish to, very much. I was so preoccupied, I didn’t think -’
Sherlock, wide eyed, nods slowly. John can’t help but smile at his transparent sincerity. He takes Sherlock’s hand, takes a breath, says, ‘Okay. Good. Right then. More?’
I cleared my throat. ‘Much as I hate to compound a lie, the only alternative is to tell her the truth.’ It was my turn to sigh. ‘And I believe she would find that distressing. She is a kind girl, motivated by concern for a man she is fond of, who she believes to be honest. I should not like her to think her trust was misplaced.’
I couldn't stop myself. 'Oh was it, Holmes? Was it necessary? Like it was necessary last time?' I laughed then, bitter and slightly hysterical. 'I suppose I should be grateful. At least this time I found out quickly, not three years later.' My voice rose on the last words to almost a shout and he flinched.
She smiled shyly, muttered another thank you, and slipped after Mrs Hudson with every sign of profound relief.
‘It’s as I said, sir, ‘e was real worldly in some ways and real innocent in others, and I jus’ want to know as ‘e’s okay, and safe, like. An’ like I say, I’ve got a bit now, from me aunt, I thought mebbe if ‘e needed a bit, jus’ to get ‘im out of trouble like. He was a gentleman, you see, sir, an’ I don’ think ‘e would ‘ave left, not without good reason, even if as how ‘e didn’t want to marry, an I thought as how mebbe ‘e was forced to- to-.’ The rush of words began to trail off under my gaze.
I breathed out in relief. ‘Then let us forget the conversation.’ I moved to stand.
Sherlock says, and his tone of voice is one that John isn’t used to. It sounds like he’s deducing through fog. ‘You’re not gay. We’re not a couple. You’ve always said that.’
For one long moment he held himself tense and unmoving, then I heard him release a long, shaking sigh, and all the tension drained away. He relaxed into my arms, lowered his head to my shoulder, and I felt his hands drift to my waist, and as I continued to rub his back, his hands encircled my waist and held me tightly. I have no idea how long we stood there, but it was worth every moment of pain in those three long years to know how dear I was held in the affection of Sherlock Holmes.
‘Watson.’ He imitated my tone. ‘If memory serves, we were preoccupied at the time with housebreaking, destruction of evidence, and obstructing the police in catching a murderess. And as you rightly observed, my rival was ready to cut me out the moment I left.’
I bent my head to rest against his. ‘As am I.’ He murmured something into the intimate space between us that it took me a moment to decipher. ‘Three continents Watson?’
I cut him off. ‘It isn’t that.’
I rallied. ‘Nothing. You are quite right.’
‘So you believe.’ I say firmly. ‘I say you are reckless and selfish.’ I am beginning to feel an odd tingling under my skin. The light in the room seems brighter. Is this an effect of the drug, or am I imagining it in my hyper-aware state?
He took me in hand and I bit back a gasp. He stroked me as I had done him and I moaned aloud. His gaze sharpened as he adjusted speed and pressure, watching me intently the whole time, reading every tiny reaction. Feeling my fantasy made flesh was too much and I was on the edge in moments, mumbling incoherent words, ‘Sherlock, oh, god, so good, please, yes -.’ I seized his arm in warning. ‘I’m so close.’
Returning to our living room, I retrieved my novel, said, ‘Goodnight, old man’, and gathered my dressing gown around me, heading back to my room.
John frowns. ‘Yep. Accurate then. Accurate now. Still not gay, still not a couple.’
‘Miss Robson,’ I began, meaning to apologise, but she interrupted me.
‘Yes. As you say, with our history, and having read all your stories, I simply assumed. In fact,’ he continued, ‘I wondered how you were getting away with being so – forgive me again – open about it. I assumed that with Holmes’ contacts in the police that perhaps ... a blind eye was being turned, so to speak.’
I dropped my head into my hands. How could I even begin that conversation?
He swayed slightly, and silence fell. After a few moments he gave a small, tight nod. ‘I understand then.’ He sounded almost business-like. ‘Would you like any assistance with your things?’ He had turned away from me again and was rearranging the oddities on the mantelpiece with unsteady hands. ‘You are welcome, of course, to any souvenir you would like from Baker Street, I have no particular attachment to anything. I take it you will be moving to Raleigh Street.’
‘Ah, ah. None of that. You are always welcome here. At even more unsociable hours than this.’ The smile that accompanied these words was warm, and I felt myself relax a little.
‘He isn’t.’ I said with certainty.
I hurried blindly on. ‘And if you wish, we need never speak of this again.’
‘Do it again, John.’
During my time in the army, and before, I had enjoyed the company of women. I did not consider those times in war a crime, nor did I consider them as defining my sexuality. As far as I was concerned, I left behind any interest in the male form in the sands of Afghanistan.
I leaned over the banister and called to Lestrade who bounded up the stairs, but not after a triumphant glance at our landlady, who looked like she was trying to commit her own murder with the force of her glare.
My overwrought emotions of the previous night had faded, giving me some much needed perspective. I had, I perceived with some distress, badly over reacted to Holmes' actions. Yes, it had been inconsiderate, hurtful even, but it had been done in the pursuit of a dangerous, homicidal man without whose presence London was a safer place. It had been, as it ever was, about the work. Holmes had done what was necessary to ensure the conviction of a criminal. It was unreasonable of me to expect any less from him. I had fondly imagined myself at terms with Holmes' return. Clearly, I had failed to reconcile my own emotional state and my failure in this area had led me to abuse Holmes with what to him would have been the most abhorrent emotional display.
I rested my cheek against his, my lips close to his ear as I murmured, ‘Then don’t try.’
‘No,’ I said, not without a little sadness, ‘we couldn’t.’ His head turned to me. I reached up a hand and traced the outline of his angular face with my fingertips.
He gripped me harder and breathed, ‘I want to watch you,’ as he leaned over and sucked gently at my nipple.  I came with a shout that he quickly smothered, covering my mouth with his. He kissed me, gently, fervently, with utter thoroughness as I came down, exploring my mouth, my lips, my face, even as I gasped for breath.
I realised I hadn’t spoken in some moments and the room had fallen silent. Miss Robson was watching me in confusion. ‘Are you alright, Doctor Watson, sir?’
‘It’s Mrs Anstruther now, sir,’ she said with obvious satisfaction. I stammered my congratulations as she continued, ‘And I’m so glad as I ran into you, I was hopin’ to find you at home.’
John stares at the bedspread. It’s a rather hideous shade of pastel purple. With flowers. One of Mrs Hudson's. Even after all this time she still seems to view him as some lost waif who needs to be supplied with life’s essentials. He’d like to refuse more, but the happiness in her face when he accepts stops him doing so too often. This particular item is beyond the pale though, he thinks. Aloud he says, ‘I’m not gay. I’m - a bit bi.’
He nodded, his deduction confirmed. Then hesitantly, ‘But not – the night you spent there recently?’
‘Oh, I don’t think so.’
I drank it in one swallow, dropped the mug, and gripped his hand when he went to move away.
‘I’m sorry.’ I said immediately. ‘I….you are quite right. An old friend from my army days.’ I avoided his gaze, afraid my face would betray my thoughts, my memories of James Paulson. Holmes could not know. ‘He is in newly arrived in London and looking up old acquaintances.’
I surged forward and kissed him again, firmer this time. He tasted of brandy and tobacco, with a scent that was intoxicating and uniquely Holmes. I slid a hand beneath his dressing gown, desperate to be closer still to the warmth of his skin. He began to tremble in my arms. I stopped, suddenly anxious.
As if divining my thoughts, she said immediately, ‘Oh no, sir, he’d never ‘ad no-one, that was clear as day. I said ‘e was a gentleman, sir, an’ he was, but it was more than that.’ She lowered her voice and almost whispered to me, ‘I asked him to kiss me, you see, and ‘e said as.... he didn’t know how.’
He began again. 'Watson-'
I stopped his rambling by the simple expedient of taking his face in my hands. ‘Holmes, it’s fine. Really. I know now. When you’re on a case, you’re busy. All the time. I won’t take it as a slight.’
‘Mrs Hudson?’ I queried. Our fine landlady tended to sweep magisterially into our rooms, not hover doubtfully in the doorway.
‘Don't be.' His chest was still warm against my side, and I hoped desperately he wouldn't rush to move away. In that moment, isolation was more than I could bear. ‘You did well today. Hold on to that. Nothing was your fault. It's a natural reaction to a bad day. It does get easier.' He sighed, his breath hot against my ear.
I took stock for a moment trying to surmise why Mycroft would even care if John thought he was mad or not. He gestured towards for the guards to give us some privacy.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I ignored his words, desperate to change the subject.
“John”.
It worries me that Mycroft felt he needed to contact me about John being in danger. It must be serious for him to be calling me back. I am so close to finishing things up here that I really cannot leave now. I have to believe that I am doing the right thing. Mycroft has many resources at his disposal. He will be able to cope with whatever is happening in London. Why would anybody be going after John, though? Is it something to do with Moriarty? No, it cannot be. I have meticulously been trying up all the loose ends; there is only one left. Aggrieved client? Something to do with the army? Oh, what is the point? I cannot deduce anything from this far away. John will be fine. I must try not to think of him.
It occurred to me this morning that I should be penniless. I haven’t been into work for six months now, not since everything happened. I didn’t phone and tell them; I just didn’t turn up. No-one’s contacted me to ask why. I didn’t have much in my bank account to start with. All those taxi journeys around London chasing after the bad guys with…him. Anyway, all those taxi journeys which he expected me to pay did not have a healthy effect on my savings. It came to me this morning when a couple of serious-looking ‘final demand’ letters came through the door for this flat’s previous occupier. I can admit to myself, although not to anyone else, that I am barely coping. I scarcely move nor eat nor sleep. I certainly haven’t been paying my rent or bills.
“I’m seeing a dead man. Of course I’m fucking mad… Great, now I’m talking to a dead man too.”
When you get here. –MH
Why?-SH
“I’m not thirsty.”
“Interesting that you feel the need to lie.”
John froze in panic trying to figure out how he would explain his presence in Sherlock’s room. Whilst still attempting to concoct a story convincing enough and void of any mention of nightmares, John turned towards the bed. John sighed in relief to see that Sherlock was still sound asleep and sleep-talking rather than speaking directly to him.
“What I mean is…” A wave of tiredness suddenly overwhelmed him and he sighed deeply. “Nothing...I mean nothing.” Sherlock furrowed his brow and focused on John as if he was the most complex puzzle in the world.
John looked so small in the hospital bed. I craned my neck, face pressed up against the window in the door of his room whilst strong-armed buffoons held me back from entering. Mycroft had stationed security outside so that I could not get to him. I started shouting just as Mycroft walked around the corner. He had put on some weight and had some extra lines around his eyes, but was otherwise the same old Mycroft. The same self-satisfied grin that came with knowing he was in control of any situation that might arise. I stopped grappling with the guards.
“Sherlock, we need to talk about this.”
Danger? I’m preventing the danger sorting out things here. You can deal with whatever’s happening there. Friend is also capable.  – SH
“Get out,” I said whilst my whole being screamed at him not to leave me again. Sherlock did not move a muscle, merely sat in his chair with his hands in the prayer position beneath his nose.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry for causing you any suffering. Trust me when I say that if there had been any other way that avoided that; avoided all of this, I would have done it.”
John snickers and turns away from the wind to light the cigarette. That’s when he sees her behind him. Sally is standing feet away, smoking with Anderson.
John pushes the thoughts out of his mind and heads upstairs.
“Oh, fuck!” John groans loudly.
John rubs his hair roughly and licks his lips.
“Okay.” John peers through the window, then back to Mycroft.
Sherlock climbs quietly out of bed and begins to make his way to the door.
John eases his way up, trying not to disturb Sherlock. Still thinking about what he'd like to do to Jim, he looks out the window onto the street below before he walks towards the kettle to make tea.
Sherlock pulls away, smiling despite his apprehension, hand still on John’s face. “John, I -”
“I’m enjoying the texture of this glass right now, thanks,” John responds as he strokes the rim of his glass with his thumb, “Strange how you don’t really notice things like this normally, isn’t it?”
Sherlock turns to look at John with a genuine but exhausted smile, “You’re much sexier than you realise, John. My physical response to you should be evidence enough of that.” John chuckles, shaking his head. They stare ahead at the fireplace, John gently stroking Sherlock’s chest.
“No,” she replies, shrugging “I just ask.”
? It’s just a mess of chemicals that leaves you distracted.”
“Mycroft. If this is to discuss the American tour, I’ve -”
“You could say that.”
“I don’t actually smoke, that was sort of an excuse to follow you to the roof that night.” John grins ruefully.
“No, I just,” Sherlock sits up and leans across John to retrieve the lubricant that they had used for the massage a few days before. He pours the liquid into his hand before taking John’s in his, slicking them both.
John turns his head, laughing and Sherlock climbs into the tub.
John just nods his head and looks back to the crowd of people, “Right, well. I think I’m going to head back. Is there a metro 'round here?”
if that’s the term we’re using - that it’s quite possible for nearly anyone to be attracted to another person regardless of gender. It’s insignificant, really. It’s almost a minor detail when looking at the whole picture.”
John furrowed his brow in confusion: what on earth was Sherlock dreaming about? He was strongly tempted to stay and hear more but John shook himself with a reminder about privacy, knowing that Sherlock would not like to be spied upon. He knew that he needed to leave the room as quickly as possible.
Sherlock remained stock still in the same position as John had left him for a long time. Again and again he ran through what had happened but refused to believe whist his deductions had led him to conclude. A tiny fluttering of hope was welling up inside him and he stamped it down as violently as possible. Still, once you eliminate the impossible, whatever, remains, no matter how improbable must be the truth.
“Really, John. You can’t go asking medical professionals whether they can see people right in front of you. They’ll lock you away.
There is no case to solve here. The quicker you accept that, the better.  – MH
Mycroft was obviously choosing his words carefully and I pondered on what he had said. He was trying to protect me in his role as big brother. This was not about me, though. It was about John and whatever happened, I would just have to live with it.
He quickly moved into the kitchen, passing Sherlock who groaned dramatically and thrust himself backward onto the sofa. He covered his eyes with one of his hands and breathed deeply in an effort to not reveal to John how disturbed he was feeling and to try and tamper down his arousal. John watched him whilst the kettle boiled. He did not relish the conversation that was about to happen. In truth, he wanted to avoid it as much as Sherlock did. It needed to happen, however. John was not willing to risk losing Sherlock for what potentially could just be a quick shag or some comfort.
They’re working on him now. – MH
“Why couldn’t you have told me? Let me know you were okay?” he asked. I could hear the emotion thick in his voice and I attempted to swallow down the lump in my own throat.
I knew rationally that he was right. I was not what was best for John in this situation, but I needed to be with him nevertheless.
I know you’re lying.  – MH
“Good to know I couldn’t be trusted.”
You need to talk.  – MH
I glanced once more through the window.
“What makes you say that?”
“Sod off back to bloody Minsk or wherever the hell you’ve been.” I closed my eyes and concentrated on my breathing as I began to feel the emotion about to burst forth again.
When John began to stir out of his sleep, my hand shot from his wrist automatically at risk of being caught. I had not realised I was still holding onto him until that moment. I could not help but call his name, but that was utterly stupid of me. It obviously distressed him to hear me. My heart was in my throat and I completely froze when the alarms started ringing, signalling that something was wrong. Nurses and doctors ran into the room and injected him with a sedative.
“There really is no need, I…” John started.
“Right Doctor Watson,” she said. “I’m going to have to give you a sedative. It seems there’s been too much excitement this afternoon and you need to give your body a chance to recover.”
“Next time I go gallivanting, I’ll be sure to invite you, instead,” I said, forcing a smile on my face in a desperate attempt to lighten the mood.
I stayed silent. I could feel the emotion welling up inside and I desperately tried to quash it.
“Come on. Back upstairs.” John did not release his hand from Sherlock’s and guided him back into the flat. As soon as the door was closed behind them, Sherlock pushed John against the wall and initiated a desperate kiss. His hands ran underneath John’s t‐shirt where he focused on stroking halfway down the torso before edging higher and higher. When his hand brushed over one of John’s nipples, John gasped and he felt himself becoming dizzy. With every ounce of willpower, he put his hands against Sherlock’s chest and pushed.
“That’s what this is, then?”, John started tentatively. “Some, erm...sexual activity?”
Just get back here. –MH
“He was just going to ask you for some water. Isn’t that right, John?”
I supposed I should look into it. I could not remember my internet banking password and I really didn’t have the energy to be phoning the bank. I realised it had been a couple of days since I had eaten properly so I went to buy some food and got a mini-statement from the cash machine whilst out. There’s £42, 000 in my account and it looks like the bills have all been set out to come out of that. Six months ago, £50, 000 had been deposited. I know it was Mycroft; there is literally no-one else it could have been. I need to thank him. Part of me knows I should be offended, but if it wasn’t for him, I’d have financial troubles now as well as everything else. There is no way I can speak to him; he’s too much a reminder of his brother. I’ll text, though. I owe him that. Well, that and fifty grand.
“Sherlock wouldn’t have wanted to see you like this. John, are you listening to me? He was…”
He moved into the room.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“What?” I asked through gritted teeth.
He could not bear to be in the same room as Sherlock any longer. John knew he would not be able to bear the look on Sherlock’s face when he inevitably clicked onto what he had been thinking. And it would not be long until he realised. John felt transparent and Sherlock could see through people like nobody else.
“It’s only me, Sherlock. Stay calm.”
“You know, you’ll get out of here a lot quicker if you play along with the medical professionals.” A thought hit me. “Assuming that’s what you want, of course.”
No answer.
John took a deep breath and turned to leave, before something inside him snapped and he spun back around again.
I knew that voice. I was dreaming, then. I tried to make his voice appear again, but it didn’t. Then the pain was back, the pain I had been trying to escape. It eclipsed everything else as I felt panic welling up inside me and heard the beeping of the heart monitor going crazy. Medical alarms started ringing and I heard people bustling into the room. I must have been injected with a sedative because my panic quickly turned into the overwhelming urge to sleep.
“Where the fuck have you been until now?” I demanded.
“Goodnight”, Sherlock said with a steely air of finality in his voice.
“Hardly,” Sherlock replied seriously. His eyes were fixed on John as if he was in a trance,
“You’re not mad.”
Is he going to die? – SH
“Stay, Sherlock. Please.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Thinking of how humiliated Sherlock would feel to find John witnessing what he would be perceive to be  weakness, John made a compromise. He decided that he would return to his own room, but if the screaming began again, he would do something. He lowered the gas lamp from above his head and turned in the direction of the door. He tip-toed in order not to wake Sherlock but just as he was about to place the lamp back where it belonged, he was startled by Sherlock murmuring his name.
It’s been two months since Sherlock jumped. I can’t seem to pull myself out of the stupor in which I find myself. I try to make an effort. I am reassuring when Mrs Hudson phones to ask if I’m okay. I invent extravagant excuses when Lestrade invites me for a drink down the pub so that he does not suspect the truth. And really, these are the only people who bother with me. Harry stopped bothering soon after the funeral, no doubt enmeshed in her own issues. Mycroft, well Anthea, used to phone at regular intervals, but I could not face his calls and they soon stopped. The lack of demands on me allows me to maintain a socially acceptable mask when required. The rest of the time I am free to wallow in numbness. I know I’m being melodramatic. I know it’s unhealthy and needs to stop. I just can’t.
John pulled himself together and moved out of Sherlock’s reach, he leaned on the arm of the sofa since he could not trust his legs to keep him upright.
What? That was not happening, I thought. All I knew is that I had to be as close to him as possible. It may not have been rational, but I did not care. It clicked that this was what Mycroft was trying to stall.
I did not trust myself to speak; I returned the grip on my hand in answer. This was a vulnerability to Sherlock that I had never seen before and I began to wonder something had happened to him to bring it about.
Just keep moving. Get to the airport. One foot in front of the other. Fucking hell. Find a cab. Get there now. Oh my God. Must keep moving. Breathe. This cannot be happening.  Get to London. Have to get back. What the fuck? Shit, John. Please. Don’t think. Move. Move. Get to the plane. Just get to the plane. John. John. John. Stop. Quickest route to airport? Focus. Oh my God. John. GET A GRIP. Fastest way to Minsk-1. Get to Minsk-1. Mycroft must be wrong. Get to the airport. Why is this happening? Suicide? John.
“Want to go get some fresh air?”
“You should eat now while you’re feeling all right. You’re still feeling okay, right?”
“But -”
. Quite tongue-in-cheek. There’s a funny story about this song, actually. Serge Gainsbourg first recorded this with his mistress, Bridget Bardot, but when her husband got word of the liaison that inspired the song, Bardot begged Gainsbourg not to release it. What you hear is the second recording. The remake with his wife.”
When John arrives to his room - bigger than expected and tastefully furnished - he settles in for a quick kip. When he wakes up about an hour later, mostly refreshed, he heads to Ricky’s room, still unsure of what’s expected of him today.
“You fucking twat!” screams Molly between sobs.
“Well, I’d say that’s a wrap!” Greg exclaims when the new song has finished. “Nice one, Sherlock! I smell a hit. What do you think about the bass?”
“No, Thomas Wolfe did. But more to the point, I see your loneliness because I’m no stranger to the feeling myself,” Sherlock responds, looking ahead at nothing in particular.
“No,” Sherlock groans.
"Please."
“Yeah," Greg smirks, "like you and Sherlock?”
Greg looks at Molly with a smile, “He beats that twat Jim by a mile!”
“Yes, I’m sure,” He cocks an eyebrow, “Anyway, I’ve got news.”
Despite himself, his cheeks moisten as he bats his eyes closed and covers his eyes with his hand.
“They gave me a gastric lavage, otherwise it could have killed me.”
“So you are?”
bloody city?” Greg asks, concern evident in his voice.
Sherlock smirks, then uncharacteristically moves into the group hug.
“John, it’s not that you seem unlikeable, it’s just, well, I recognise your loneliness.”
Sherlock scoffs, “I wouldn’t say that. In fact, I’m quite afraid of failure, if I’m being honest. It pushes me to work hard, maybe too hard sometimes. Feeling like this right now, I can’t see the use of it,” He sits down next to John on the edge of the bed.
"Oh, piss off! Do you have any oil or lotion?"
Then before Sherlock can respond, he feels his hair being pulled roughly, forcing his head back.  He moans as John greedily imbibes the soft skin of his neck with his lips and tongue. When John makes his way make to Sherlock's mouth, a guttural groan escapes him.
It’s more hugging than dancing to the slow melody, and John leans into the sound of the organ, experiencing pure exhilaration with every note. He’s startled by the sound of a woman moaning.
“Dance?”
The kiss turns from tentative and tender to exigent when Sherlock grips John’s waist and pulls in him tightly.
“John! Have a shot of sambuca! We’re going to America tomorrow!” Molly beams.
he thinks. Perhaps he’s still coming down from Saturday, but he’s over the constant travelling and parties. He feels like he’s caught in Sherlock’s orbit and if he gets too close, he’ll burn. They’ve become quite close and it’s destabilizing. They kissed, for God’s sake! His current life is such a contrast from Bosnia, it’s a real mind-fuck. He has to to get his bearings.
“Honestly, John," he says, rolling his eyes, "Didn’t we get past seeing each other naked in Amsterdam? I didn’t know you were able to delete memories as well.”
Outside, Sherlock lights a fag and looks up at the sky, “Beautiful, isn’t it?”
They’re still for a moment, then Greg breaks the embrace, “Jacuzzi, anyone?” And before waiting for a response, he strips down completely naked and jumps in.
It's surreal. It's too much. For the second time now listening to
John puts the two pieces of toast on a plate and hands it to Sherlock, then puts two more in the toaster for himself. “And here’s your tea,” he hands the steaming mug over to his friend.
“I think you’re describing exactly what drugs do.”
“John?”
“The way you took care of me the night I, erm, overdosed. Being a military doctor, I don’t imagine you encountered many drug overdoses with work. It’s obvious someone close to you has had similar… issues. Probably not a parent since you wouldn’t have had the medical knowledge to deal with this type of situation whilst living at home. So, a sibling. A recent problem,” Sherlock turns to John expectantly, “Just a guess.”
“Maybe let me have a look at that now?” John asks as he stands.
“You’re right, John. Take it.”
Don’t you know you might find
“Yes, well.” John looks up at Sherlock for a moment, surprised at the emotion he's seen from the man tonight.
“Too bad.” Sarah smiles, “Want to go outside.”
John nods in response, and Sherlock slowly unbuttons and unzips before pulling down his jeans. Sherlock caresses John’s solid thighs, then plants soft kisses up and down their length. John tries to control his breathing, but it’s a losing battle. Sherlock looks up at John’s face then closes his eyes before brushing his cheek against the front of John’s pants, exhaling hot breath against his cock.
“Not likely, I need to rest,” Sherlock responds flatly.
“Are they actually having sex in the recording studio?” John asks into Sherlock’s chest.
“I’ll go with you, Molly.” John hears the small drummer with beady eyes speak up for the first time.
“Let me look at that,” John says as he walks over to Sherlock.
“Yes, well, thanks for being here,” Sherlock holds John’s gaze intently.
He walks back into the bedroom and pauses for a moment before sliding into the empty side of the bed. Sherlock is lying on his stomach, and though the pills are definitely wearing off, he still craves touch.
Their first single,
“John, the only person I’ve kissed this entire tour is you,” Sherlock says as he looks John square in the eyes.
“I would ask if you’ve visited, but it’s obvious you haven’t.”
After a few minutes, Sherlock drops John’s foot and declares, “I’m going to take a shower. A bit overheated,” He gets up with a slosh. His usual alabaster skin is pink and his face flushed. John notices that both sets of cheeks have the same rosiness. He averts his eyes when he realises he’s staring.
John wipes his eyes, blows out a breath and looks up, “Erm, how much?”
“Wait, but that I article I read back in London, I think it called you a
“Too many clothes,” Sherlock mutters into John’s mouth as he gently pulls John’s layers over his head before leaning in to envelop him. Sherlock brings a hand up to John’s short hair and plants a kiss on his forehead before reuniting their mouths. John’s hands are back on Sherlock’s arse, massaging and pushing their erections together. Sherlock grabs the other man’s cheeks, grinding lightly, creating even more friction. He moans deeply into John’s mouth before whispering,  “Just let me make you feel good, John. Do you trust me?”
“You didn’t take mine from upstairs, did you?”
He’s never considered emigrating, but New Zealand has a certain new world freshness that appeals to him. Since Harry wrote to him about her local clinic in Christchurch urgently seeking a physician, he has gone from completely discounting the idea, to seriously considering it. He’s been back from Europe for nearly two weeks now and job prospects are not looking promising. The one NHS clinic he felt really good about had called him for a second interview, only to choose another applicant instead. When this opportunity had fallen through, he briefly considered joining Velvet for their American tour. It would be great money, sure, but he’s uncertain whether it would be the right move for him.
“A talking encyclopedia? Sounds familiar,” Greg laughs. “Listen, boys, I’ve had enough of a history lesson for today. I saw a little French dive bar over there. Might check it out.”
“I hope you’re right. Otherwise, I’ve got my work cut out for me.”
“It’s my pleasure," John stops himself, "well, I mean... it’s fine. It's all fine. You’re my friend, it’s what friends do. Plus, I am a doctor.”
“If you’re referring to what happened back in London, I can assure you that it won’t be a problem.”
“Better acoustics.”
John’s eyes blink open, “What, here?”
“Good,” John says quietly.
Sherlock chuckles, “Oh, I know what I want, John.” Sherlock looks at John with sudden intensity, “I know exactly what I want, right now, at this moment.”
“How is Sherlock doing, by the way? I read about what happened in the paper. Is it true? Is he really clean?”
“Yeah, well. I’ve been busy trying to figure things out, a job and such. Plus I didn’t want to bother you.”
John hears a moan escape his friend and notices his eyes still closed, his hands rubbing his own thighs. He notices the sharp angles of his face like he’s seeing him for the first time - he has the sudden urge to touch Sherlock. He touches his own face instead, likening the stubble on his chin to sand on a warm beach. He closes his eyes and smiles, noticing how the light lingers behind his eyes.
“You’ll shrivel up like a prune,” he warns, smiling slightly.
“No. I was chatting with Julien on the balcony. Greg said you were looking for me.”
“Like this?”
John starts at Sherlock’s shoulders, which are very tight indeed. He kneads lightly until Sherlock pipes up, “I’m not an invalid, You can go harder.”
“John. He’s awake, but can I have a word first?"
“Not too bad. We’ll just wash it out and I’ll put some butterfly stitches on it.”
“How could you
“You too.” They look at each other as though daring the other to go first. Sherlock breaks the tension with a passionate kiss, tucking his hands down the waistband of John’s pants to caress his naked arse. He lets go and swiftly removes his own trousers and black boxer briefs, standing fully exposed in front of John. John looks at Sherlock and exhales, “Oh, God.”
“Not quite,” Sherlock responds with a smirk. John grips his waistband, then pauses before he removes his own boxers and sits down. Sherlock kneels in front of him, bringing his mouth up to John’s face first, kissing him slowly and reassuringly. His hands then moves down to John’s thighs, stroking lightly. John hums at the touch, his cock twitching with anticipation. Then, using both hands, Sherlock begins slowly stroking him. John lets out a startled gasp. His eyes close again when he feels Sherlock’s tongue lick from the base to the tip, stopping to tease the head with a circular movement. John reaches out to grasp Sherlock’s curls.
"Anyway, I just wanted to talk about the bass line in the new song we’re working on.”
By Simon Jones
The water is gloriously warm and bubbly. John closes his eyes to take in all the sensations, vaguely listening to Molly and Greg, who are deep into fervent conversation about how lucky they are to be experiencing the kind of success that allows them to travel luxuriously around Europe. He silently agrees, then his thoughts are interrupted when he feels the most delightful sensation in his left foot.
The blood rushes to John’s face. “Jesus. Am I that obvious?”
“Yeah?”
John smiles, looking at Sherlock incredulously. “And how do you know all this?”
John looks away. “Right. I guess I’ll be off, then.”
“Jesus, Sherlock!” shouts Greg.
“Well, Greg’s pretty good about checking his insulin levels, and Sherlock…I think he’s all right. I mean, I don’t think you need to worry about a repeat of a few weeks ago... hopefully.”
“I guess I’m afraid you’ll relapse.”
“Oh, that’s nice,” murmurs John.
John chuckles, “Oh, it was exciting. Everything you’d expect.”
“Well, that has been part of it for me, I suppose. But I’ve realized certain drugs not only hurt me, but my… my
“Oh, shit. I’m --”
John releases him and opens the box. He promptly takes the heroin out of the box and walks into the loo where he promptly flushes it down. He paces back into the kitchen and stands inches away from Sherlock who’s looking ahead at nothing in particular.
“Sally,” John responds, furrowing his brow.
“You consider the Solar System useless?”
“Yes, I agree, Doctor Watson. But for now, at least, we know Sherlock will have nothing to worry about.”
Who’ll throw it all away
“Of course,” John sighs and rubs his free hand over his face, “Of course I’ll be there. Where is he?”
In one swift movement, Sherlock snatches the box out of John’s hand. “I want to keep the box, at least.”
? You?”
Sherlock reaches the top of his head and pushes in softly with the heels of his hands. John’s eyes roll back in his head and he moans with delight.
“Yeah, I think so,” Molly says, obviously exhausted.
You said that you’ve never been
The song doesn’t have the answer.
It’s Sarah, the girl from the first night at Sherlock’s. John thinks back to that night and all that has happened since. Mostly, he’s proud of how far Sherlock has come since the self-inflicted overdose.
Of a rock n roll band
“Sherlock, how are you feeling?”
Stop talking.” John murmurs.
“Oh, Sherlock! You’re one of my best friends too!” She squeezes his arm and turns to sit down opposite Greg. Sherlock takes her spot and reaches for John’s right foot this time.
“Thank you, John,” Sherlock says, looking at John earnestly.
“I heard there was some good French food and wine back here!” shouts Greg as if on cue as the band walk into the backstage area.
“Well, the idiot refused to stay in hospital, and we couldn’t let him go through this alone, could we?”
he thinks. The air is slow and melancholy, but slightly out of tune. It reminds him of the music Sherlock played that night back in London, just more relaxed - playing to himself rather than performing for an audience. He lingers for a moment, just taking in the sound, then makes his way toward his door.
“Mycroft, it’s -”
“What?! Why? Is he all right?” John’s chest suddenly feels heavy and there’s a tingling sensation in his hands and feet.
John tries to stop his racing thoughts and focus on the morning at hand. He turns his attention to the music playing on the radio. It’s a familiar song from about ten years ago.
“Hi, Sherlock.”
“Well, that’s not going to happen,” Mycroft says shortly, “And, while we’re at it, perhaps you’ll reconsider the American tour? For Sherlock’s sake.”
“Okay. Come with me. I’ve got my kit in my room.”
“Good. Julien’s doing well, don’t you think?” Molly grins.
“Just come here,” John says calmly.
“Fuck. Oh, Fuck!” He lets out a sound that’s somewhere between a moan and a growl and Sherlock purrs in response. The vibrations intensify the pleasure and John looks down at Sherlock on his knees in front of him. “You’re fucking incredible, you know that” he pants.
“Honestly? I don't know, John. The work, the music, it's not always enough. I want more, I need more. I just don’t always know what that is, or sometimes I do and it's unattainable. It’s not that I’m discontent, there’s just... a void. Heroin, drugs, is -
“Of course. Julien.” John grimaces from the drink or maybe the news, “Sally’s here. She said she’s here to see you, Molly. I just wanted to warn Sherlock.”
“Shut up! Morning wood! Surely even the aged like you experience that sometimes!”
John follows Sherlock up the stone staircase and onto the small street outside the club where Sherlock lights up a Benson. “Would you like one?”
“Yes, well, it probably is for you!” John laughs, “Maybe.”
“I don't know! A drugs and sex thing? It looked like you were about to kiss in that photo.”
he thinks
“And I’m supposed to believe that your military career is all there is to you?” Sherlock turns to fix his eyes on John's.
He sits up and scratches his head before getting up and walking to the door. He looks through the peephole and sees Sherlock leaning against the doorframe. He flings open the door,  “I was sleeping!”
“You wouldn’t have bothered me,” Sherlock responds matter-of-factly.
“Of course. Of course I know that,” John says almost defensively. “I’m just not sure it was a good idea to cross that boundary with you. You’re my friend, and I mean that. I don’t want this to change anything between us.”
John suddenly feels a great urgency to hear more music.
“Sherlock?” Greg calls as he looks around.
John frowns, "Are you saying I remind you of your grandmother?”
“John, are you sure?” Sherlock tilts his head, uncertainty creasing his forehead. It’s almost endearing, but John is too consumed with wanton hunger to smile.
“He’s quite good,” says Anderson, nodding.
“Well, at least this article makes it look like you’re having fun on tour instead of just being an insufferable cock!”
It’s a song he’s heard on the radio recently, he thinks it's Radiohead, but the lyrics seem particularly poignant in his altered state. Sherlock sits down in the chair at the desk where the record player sits.
“Methadone.”
“Then why didn’t you throw it away, dammit?! Tell her to shove off?”
it’s not due to my posh public school. My maternal grandmother was French. I visited her in the summers growing up and we would walk the city. She was like a talking encyclopedia. Some of my fondest memories are here with her.”
“Ah, shut it, you!” Greg replies, laughing, as he heads toward the service table.
John glances back to look at Sherlock, but he’s no longer there. “Where’s he gone?”
“So, what now?” Molly looks around at the others. With her fresh face, her hair pulled back, and her simple babydoll dress, she looks more like a seventeen-year-old than her actual age of twenty-seven.
“John, I –“ Sherlock looks down at his clasped hands.
“Okay,” John concedes.
“We’re in public.” John’s voice is steady and his eyes are still shut.
“It doesn’t smell like flower petals, though,” John observes. “Your hair smells like tobacco and…is that lavender?
“Yes, everything feels better, as I said. Close your eyes.”
“Fine,” Sherlock sighs, then chugs the full glass on his bedside locker.
“John?"
They’re quiet for a while, then John asks, “So, what’s this about, anyway?”
“I’m honoured,” John is suddenly glowing with love for his new friends. Before he can say any more, Molly’s arms are encircling him, then he’s hit with Greg’s stronger embrace.
“Bring your foot up so I can do yours at the same time,” John suggests, a soft smile on his face as he looks across to Sherlock. He obeys, and John begins mimicking the touches, pressing gently into the ball of his foot, stroking upward.
“Okay,” John looks up at Sherlock, “I’m going to ask you something, Sherlock. Is there anything going on with you and Julien?”
“I’m Marika. Are you in a band?” she asks coyly.
“He was drugged. He has pulled through, but he’s not well, John.”
“Good.”
“Well, that’s what I’m here for, isn’t it?” John smiles lightly.
“What’s your name?” she asks in heavily accented English.
“Given the dose you were given, I’d expect so. Even after having your stomach pumped.”
do anything, if you know what I mean. Vasoconstriction is a side effect.”
The room is cool and empty when John wakes to the sound of rain falling through the open window. He checks his watch; it's 9 am. He’s got an hour before he has to be at the bedsit for the walk-through and to turn in his keys. He rolls over and rubs his face.
John is inside and up the stairs before he can hear what Sarah was saying. As he enters the flat, he looks around for Sherlock, eager to warn him of Sally’s presence. He doesn’t see him. He walks over to the drinks table where Molly and Greg are downing a few shots.
On the next downstroke, Sherlock places his thumb is on the sensitive head, massaging in a circular motion.
!” Julien protests, citing that it’s the last night of the tour.
John laughs, “That’s what I’m afraid of.”
“No, Sherlock. I don’t feel like talking, I just feel like sleeping.”
“John, it’s over.”
“Oh, right,” He looks around awkwardly.
His fingers start lightly moving at the base of John’s skull where his head and neck meet. Then he begins massaging his scalp in slow, rhythmic circles.
“Of course you are,” John smiles, “I like it. I don’t think they’re idiotic at all.”
John isn’t sure if he wants to move, but doesn’t want to be selfish. In fact, he wants Sherlock to feel as good as he’s made him feel.
Sherlock seems to be lacking his usual charisma. He looks as striking as ever, but somehow even paler than usual.
Sherlock stands and gently pulls a few inches away in order to look John in the eyes. He smirks, but it’s markedly more vulnerable than usual. He moves his hands to John’s lower back, pulling him in closer to press their bodies against each other. John, still influenced by his anger about the drugs, needs to regain control.
“Sorry to break up...whatever this is,” Greg says, startling John into snapping his eyes open. Molly looks down at the glass in her hand.
John pulls away gently to catch his breath and looks up to meet Sherlock’s eyes, but Sherlock’s head is tilted down, eyes averted. John brings one hand up to Sherlock's jaw, and the other back up to his satin hair, taking in a strand and rolling it around between his fingertips. They kiss slowly.
“Oh, dear! Well, at least you’ve got Doctor Watson here to take care of you!”
“In more ways than one!” Molly replies.
John looks across the room to Sherlock, who’s stood by the drinks table chatting to Julien, “Yeah, noticed that. Do you think he’s all right?”
The song starts with a 50's era drum beat, then a deep male voice. The words John doesn’t understand, but it reminds him of spoken-word poetry.
“Oh!” Molly exclaims.
Mycroft raises an eyebrow, “You would be paid a tidy sum, of course.”
“Breakfast?” John asks Sherlock as he puts two pieces of bread in the toaster.
John stands still for a few seconds, eyes closed, fists clenched. When he opens them, Sherlock is standing before him, hand extended. He steps out of his trousers and lets himself be led to the sofa.
"I assure you, Scotland Yard has nothing on Mycroft. He's very... persuasive when he needs to be."
“Well, actually, I thought I’d go out on my own a bit.”
“Drink some water, kids!” John shouts over the music.
“Well, if you’re sure, mate?”
“I am
John exits the room and calls back as he walks upstairs, “Yep, it's fine. See you tomorrow, Greg.”
“Really, Greg? We were all naked together in a hot tub just a few weeks ago, now you’re embarrassed?”
John frowns slightly. Sherlock catches John’s eye and smiles. Moments later, Sherlock makes his way to the table and Julien follows.
Sarah hands John a cigarette and a lighter, “These things will kill you.”
John exhales, “Okay.”
After they’ve each showered, Sherlock sits down beside John on the sofa, steaming mug in hand.
“It doesn’t change anything, John. It’s fine. And you know how I feel about romantic entanglement, anyway. It’s not what I’m looking for now, maybe never. And nothing has changed, nothing
“What are you anxious about?”
“Whiskey?”
Sherlock slowly brings his hand down and wraps his fingers around John’s shaft, gently stroking up and down. John mimics Sherlock’s movements, and soon they’re both stroking at a steady pace, not kissing, but breathing hotly into each other’s mouths.
happened.” Sherlock leans back into the sofa, “You know I’m often bored with the mundane, and though I might not project it, I firmly believe we should take any pleasure we can squeeze out of life. Of course, as long as it doesn’t hurt anyone.”
“I think it is,” Sherlock says dismissively, “I just think most people are too closed-minded to accept that.”
“John?” Sherlock looks up at him, “Sit down on the sofa.”
John moves his hands to Sherlock’s shoulders as they move to the beat.
John unsuccessfully tries to force a smile and sits down in a chair by the bed. “Sherlock, are you all right? What's happened?”
“What are you having?” asks Sherlock out of nowhere, and John feels the other man’s heat on his back and notices a sweet, musky smell.
“No, I don’t, but I vaguely remember being wet and cold afterwards. Cold shower, I presume?”
“You know, it’s like I’ve been waiting forever to feel like this. I’ve never felt so…free.”
“Well, not so much, thankfully. The band were on good behaviour, for the most part.”
“Oh, John! You’re such a wonderful boyfriend!”
“I don’t read French, but the magazines seem to be implying it, and he has quite a reputation for drugs and debauchery and," John sighs, "I want to know if you're using with him."
John stares back for what seems like minutes before he looks away, contemplatively. Sherlock stares back defiantly.
“I just look…ridiculous,” John chuckles, “Drugs.”
“John, can I come in?” Sherlock asks evenly.
, thinks John.
Ricky turns to look at John, “To be honest, I don’t know. I presume it’s more of a precaution. Of course, I know all about Sherlock’s…afflictions, but part of my job is to make sure Sally doesn’t make an appearance during the tour. If I’m successful, I think you’ll be all right. Greg, however…he really needs to take his condition more seriously.”
?” Sherlock answers, “And I agree,” He grins.
John stands and hands Sherlock a towel from the cabinet. Sherlock gets out and unabashedly begins to dry his body and hair as he walks into the bedroom. John follows.
John’s not sure if he’s referring to the massage or to their close proximity. Sherlock’s fingertips are on his wrists, thumbs stroking small circles.
is so boring about your life?” John raises his voice.
“Dull?”
“Are you sure," John licks his lips, "Sherlock?”
“I’ll go see if I can get her to leave, shall I?” says Molly, “Oh!” Molly shouts, already a little drunk from wine and sambuca. “After this song! This was my favorite song in primary school! Always a romantic at heart, I guess! Greg, would you do me the honour?”
“Alright,” Sherlock acquiesces. The two of them dance in silence, moving quite expertly in sync.
“John?” Sherlock calls as he comes down the corridor from his bedroom.
Sherlock walks over to John and reaches out to grab his upper arm, looking at him questioningly. John takes a few heavy breaths, then clashes his mouth into Sherlock’s, moving his hands down to grip his hips. He breathes in the other man’s tongue in one movement and they drink each other in thirstily, nearly forgetting to come up for air.
Mike had pointed out a few weeks ago - this one was in French.
John’s anger resurfaces momentarily before he looks at Sherlock, who is obviously truly miserable. This softens him a bit. “Try me.”
“I…she was flirting with me. That man was bothering her!” Jim slurs.
“Fancy seeing you here!” a woman’s voice calls out.
John’s laugh hides his growing concern.
“Probably, to be honest, but let’s just sit here for a moment.” Sherlock shifts his limp body to lie back on John, who wraps his arms around him. John, feeling less vulnerable with Sherlock’s gaze diverted, whispers, “You know if you weren’t so… whatever you are - unfairly gorgeous, brilliant - I wouldn’t be having an existential crisis, right?”
“That was a great final performance. I think we should be proud of ourselves!” Molly grins.
John waves his hand in the general direction of the room and opens the door wider. Sherlock follows him in.
“Well, I’m tired and you’re keeping me from sleep, to start.” John sits down on the end of the bed, pulling his legs in underneath him.
“Come up here.” He says softly and moves his back up against the armrest, parting his legs.
They both giggle as Sherlock slowly loosens his grip on John and looks back at Molly and Greg. “Mmmm, yes. I think that’s best.”
John looks at his mug of tea, “I don’t regret it if that’s what you’re thinking. It’s just, this is not something I’ve ever… given much thought to.” John clears his throat and licks his lips, “I’m not gay,” John turns to look his friend in the eyes. “I know you’re not either, but it’s different for me. I’ve never even been... turned on by another man.”
They finish their breakfast in comfortable silence, then John pipes up, “You know, it might be nice to get some fresh air while you’re in good shape. Want to go on a walk?”
“I’m not sure, I think it’s something to do with his blood sugar.”
a trashy French gossip magazine that Greg had picked up. It features an article about Julien’s joining
“Right,” John clears his throat and looks down, “Anyway, I just don’t trust Julien.”
“God, yes.”
“Yeah, you can really feel the music on this stuff, can’t you?”
“I do,” Sherlock responds and reaches out with his free hand to clutch John’s. John entwines his fingertips in Sherlock's, getting the contact he craves. They stand like this for what could have been a minute or an hour, looking up at the stars, blindly caressing each other’s fingers. Finally, Sherlock lets go and lights up another cigarette. He inhales, then hands it over to John.
“No, no, it’s fine. I’m fine. Go back to Julien. I just wanted to warn you that Sally was hanging about.”
They stare at each other and it feels like a silent question.
“Excuse me, Sarah,” John takes one inhale then stubs the cigarette out on the brick wall, “I’m going back inside.”
A few strokes later, John is on the precipice, the burning feeling more smouldering than electric this time, but when it hits him, he’s able to luxuriate in the release. His whole body shudders as he continues stroking Sherlock, who follows just moments later.
Sherlock takes off his shirt as he heads toward his bedroom, returning with a bottle in hand.
“You’re not going to use it? Then get rid of it!" John shouts angrily. "Jesus!”
“Mmmm, probably. But that’s over, and so’s this side of the record.”
He uses even more pressure, utilizing the palm of his hand to rub from his spine to the outer muscles. John moans in pure contentment.
“Should I?” John tries to smile. Sherlock just kisses him in response, then drops to his knees and begins to undo John’s belt. “Alright?”
“Sounds amazing!” adds John, nodding his head.
“So I’m correct?"
A lopsided grin appears on Sherlock’s lips. “So, Doctor John Watson. Tell me a bit about yourself.”
Mycroft looks disgusted by the idea, “
“Me? Oh, I'm sure, I just didn’t think you-”
“What?” Sherlock asks, a bemused expression on his face.
John takes a shower, makes some more tea, and orders them Chinese takeaway. When they’re finished eating and John has done the washing up, he takes his place next to Sherlock on the sofa after turning on some music.
“Well, he won’t be alone, will he? Not with you’re here," She beams.
Sherlock walks back to John, who’s standing still with his eyes closed. “John?”
“Chris Isaak. This album is everything. Perfect for coming down.”
“Fair point. But uh...” Greg looks down and clears his throat, and Sherlock’s eyes follow.
“I didn’t hear from you either," Sherlock replies defensively.
“It was,” John smiles, “completely insane!” He strokes soft circles. “But yeah, also fun. I agree.”
John looks down and brushes a stray curl from Sherlock’s head before withdrawing his hand. He looks at Sherlock with a tenderness the other man does not expect.
“Well, don’t worry, symptoms of withdrawal should set in by this afternoon or tonight unless you’re very lucky. You really should eat now -  I’m not sure you’ll be able to keep anything down once the nausea sets in.”
“Nothing. Go back to sleep, John.” Sherlock whispers.
“No, Sherlock. I don’t… after all this? After we’ve worked so hard to get you clean? You’re hiding
“Right, good,” John responds as Molly walks over and plops down next to Greg. “Greg, you feeling any better?”
“Well, that will be...
He lightly strokes his cheekbones with his thumb, matching the intensity he sees in Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock suddenly walks in and John notices he’s wearing a t-shirt in addition to his black pants. Greg spots this too and shouts out, “Hey! No Fair! You’re overdressed!”
“I could... give you a massage, if you like,” John clears his throat, “I do owe you one, you know, from Amsterdam,” John frowns then chuckles nervously, "but we don't have to talk about that right now."
Slowly fade away
don’t.”
Sherlock looks at him and narrows his eyes.
John pulls up a chair in front of the sofa, “Are you doing ok, Molly?”
John walks down the rest of the flight of stairs and enters through the front door.
“Sherlock, erm, you can wait on me to leave!" John startles.
“You know, the first night I met you, we had you in the tub. I’m sure you don’t remember.”
though John can’t understand much of the text, it seems to speculate about the drummer’s relationship with the band’s enigmatic frontman. John’s lips tighten. He doesn’t think he likes Julien, though he’s not quite sure why. He puts down the magazine without closing it and walks over to the drinks table. There are loads of people milling about but he doesn’t feel like talking to anyone. The angry Grunge music playing doesn’t easily allow for conversation, anyway.
“John, I’m not interested in Julien.”
soft.”
They hold each other's gaze for a few moments until John feels his eyes moisten and looks away.
Sherlock manages to eat a bit and is now back on the sofa covered with every sheet and duvet he could find. Mrs Hudson helps John with the washing up and excuses herself back to her flat. John walks over to Sherlock and places his hand on his forehead, “You feel a bit warm.”
“Fresh air? I need a fag.” She giggles.
“You’re not in love with her, then?”
“Right.
Don’t look back in anger
“Yeah, well. I guess we’re all sort of mates,” John looks to Sarah’s hand, “Hey, I think I’ll have a drag of that after all.”
Everyone climbs out and gets dressed (though in very little.) They all drink some water and lie on the giant bed, relaxing. After a few minutes, John feels the bed move and Greg is on his feet, flipping through his CD collection. His senses are overwhelmed by a slow, steady drumbeat, then upbeat disco music.
“Yes, of course. You go on,” Sherlock scoots forward and jumps up. “I’ll make tea and go after you.” John gets to his feet, reaching for his pants.  “You should probably leave the tea to me.”
“Are you his interpreter now?” Anderson rolls his eyes, getting up to leave. Julien downs his water and starts toward the exit.
“It’s ok not to know what you want, but --”
“Shhh!” Sherlock points to John who lay next to him on his back, lightly snoring.
“Okay, everyone. We should take a break too,” John advises.
“We don’t, really. I mean, we haven’t in the past. But she’s off...whatever she was on and has settled down with her girlfriend, Clara.”
Molly’s reaches over and grabs Sherlock’s wrists, “Trade partners?”
“I’ll kill him,” John looks at him with sudden rage in his eyes.
“Sit in the chair. I’m going to rub your head. I know you like that.”
he thinks. He looks down the alley one last time, then back to the couple. This time, he makes out John’s face in the shadows.
But all the things that you've seen
“Actually, Greg,” John chimes in, cuppa in hand, “I’m not very hungry. You’re welcome to mine - it’s Thai. I’m going to have an early night,” he looks at Greg and then to Sherlock, "it's been a long day."
As he walks down the corridor toward his hotel room, he hears violin music coming from Sherlock’s next door. It’s high energy this time, not mournful. He’s in a good mood, he thinks, but then why isn’t he celebrating a successful tour with the others? He considers knocking but decides that being on his own is what he needs. He’s knackered and doesn’t even turn on the lights before taking off his jeans and getting into bed.
“Life is not something to fear, John.”
“Right,” John chuckles, “Says the man who’s afraid of nothing. Up there on stage baring your soul to thousands of people every night. With your cool clothes and your...cheekbones.”
“Fair enough. Well, I’ve one sibling, Harry. We don’t talk much.”
“Listen, I have a great idea. Hot tub back at the hotel!” Greg smiles widely, “Actually, I have the room intended for Sherlock, but this idiot prefers smaller rooms, apparently.”
“It’s fine,” Sherlock says as he grabs a cocktail napkin and wraps it around his hand. “Get that vile man out of here!”
John looks from Sherlock to Molly, then Greg. “Molly, are you going to be all right?”
“He means
“I think he already has! Anyway,
“It’s already decided. Julien, the drummer for
“I’m in!” says Molly straight away.
Here in Britain, the lead singer is known simply as Sherlock. The band, Velvet, is simply the next big thing. In fact, Velvet are already huge - their debut album just entered the British charts at No. 1.
“Hmmm. Maybe I could get Mycroft to send his massage therapist our way. On second thought, that would require talking to Mycroft.” Sherlock smiles sluggishly.
“Of course. We’ve been rehearsing. It appears that Julien is going to be joining us on a permanent basis.”
“John. This is oddly reminiscent of the night we met, though I’m sure I was in something more flattering than a hospital gown at the time.”
Sherlock nods and walks into the bathroom, sitting down on the toilet seat cover. John unravels the paper napkin and holds out Sherlock’s hand, examining the damage. Thankfully, the broken glass hasn’t done much other than inflict some superficial damage.
After a while of only the sound of the road and his own thoughts, John notices someone stirring in the kitchenette area.
“Jim. He’s pissed. He’s said or done something to Molly. I didn’t see, but --”
He gets up and walks to the bathroom for a shower.
as well.”
“Give me your arm,” John looks down at Sherlock’s extended arm and notices the scars for the first time. His nose flares and his lips tighten.  He takes a deep breath and tries to evoke sympathy rather than anger. “Why anyone with such a charmed life would inject drugs into their veins is beyond my comprehension.”
John chuckles and stands up. Sherlock grabs him by the arm and spins him around.
Sherlock groans, “Being sick is so tedious. Do you think I’ll be able to rehearse Friday?”
Sherlock walks over to John and looks at him almost apologetically.
"No, not at all. I've heard I'm all right at it."
As John walks back to his room, he realises he’s clenching his fists.
“Very much so.”
“I’m sure I knew that at one time, but I’ve tried to delete all the useless information I’ve acquired over the years,” Sherlock states.
“Better, I haven't been sick in hours. But to be fair, I don't think there's anything else to throw up,” Sherlock says as he sits down gingerly on the sofa beside John.
“I assumed you would,” Sherlock responds almost too nonchalantly, “I would be lying if I said I won’t ...miss having you around, but I understand. I want you to be happy, John. Do what makes you happy.”
Sherlock moves his lips down to John’s, only making light contact. The sensation is staggering, too much and not enough at the same time. John exhales shakily, enjoying the electric connection.  Without thinking, he pouts slightly, increasing the pressure between the point of contact. Sherlock responds in kind, then tilts his head to the side, parting his lips. They both groan as John takes Sherlock’s bottom lip into his mouth. He sucks lightly and is overcome by an urgency to feel more. Sherlock’s tongue moves searchingly, and John offers his in return, savouring the feeling of wet velvet. Sherlock intensifies the kiss by sucking lightly on John’s tongue. He tastes like sweet earth and vaguely of tobacco - it’s intoxicating. Soon, they’re clumsily lapping at each other, both panting and moaning unabashedly. Sherlock purrs and it feels magical. It’s a sloppy, wet kiss, extremely sensual, yet not urgent.
------------------------------------------------------------------
“No...the drugs are part of it, but I’m addicted to the chaos she brings. Life can be so mundane, John, but Sally is never boring.
“Er, sort of. I picked up some Ecstasy earlier. A legitimate source, might I add,” Greg clears his throat, “I thought it might be fun to take a bit and go dancing!” Greg looks from face to face, “Who’s in?”
“Er...yeah,” his frown turns into a nod, “Yes, definitely.”
“Whatever, mate. Anyway, I have an idea. Hear me out.”
“Good.”
“You two are proper mates now, aren’t you? That’s nice. Sherlock needs someone, you know, someone other than his bandmates.”
“Woo hoo!” She knocks, “Oh, Sherlock! What terrible business! How are you feeling, dear?”
“So, how long have you been working with Velvet?” John asks, making small talk.
“John, two people who are attracted to each other had a sexual encounter. It doesn’t mean you’re gay. There
It’s a cool, windy night and they can hear the leaves of the trees rustling somewhere in the distance. John looks up at the clear sky, the moon and the stars visible, “There’s Orion’s Belt.”
“Get over here, you git!” Greg exclaims.
He sighs,
John suddenly feels guilty. Sherlock needs him and he’s moving to bloody New Zealand in a couple of weeks.
“You mean recognize
John scowls up at Sherlock, “You think I seem like someone who doesn’t have any friends then? Right. Nice,” John looks down at his feet.
“This is amazing! I mean, I’ve always loved dancing, but it feels incredible right now! Cheers, Greg!” Molly leans in and hugs her dance partner.
Sherlock looks over at him dubiously, “You’ve been watching this for a quarter of an hour and don’t understand a thing?” John makes eye contact and shrugs. Sherlock frowns, then his lips curl.
John bolts upright from somewhere between sleep and wakefulness as Sherlock walks into the sitting room.
“Yes. Right now, I just want to experience this moment - I’m not usually able to do that. You’re here with me, the world’s problems are not."
Sans his perpetual scowl, John notes how young and innocent Sherlock appears. His chest tightens. For whatever reason, this man’s well-being has become important to him. He observes Sherlock for another moment; his colour’s slightly better and he’s breathing rhythmically. He gently touches his wrist to check his pulse -
The look of embarrassment is mirrored on John’s face. “I won’t ask. Lie down,” John commands, avoiding eye contact.
Sherlock smiles back, “Want to go outside? I feel like I need some fresh air.”
“Oh, Right,” John looks at Sherlock as seriously as possible, “Maybe we should...er, leave.”
John muses.
Sherlock reaches for the remote on the coffee table. Seinfeld appears on the screen.
“What? No!” John shakes his head, “No! I’m offering to keep an eye on you, make sure you don’t fall asleep in there!”
“John, I’m-” Sherlock whimpers, “I’m almost there.” John increases his speed and Sherlock’s certain he’ll die right there on the sofa. It feels like drugs shooting through his every vein, igniting a fire in his arms and legs. John slows down as he feels Sherlock’s body spasm. Waves of pleasure take over as he comes hard in John’s hand. When Sherlock becomes aware of his surroundings again, he’s lying back on John whose sticky hands are resting on his thighs.”
Twenty minutes later he’s in a cab headed east and there’s nothing to do but think. He thinks back to Sherlock’s words from the night before, that there was nothing wrong with… what they had done. In theory, John believes this, he
“Sherlock?” John calls as he walks into the flat later, arms laden with takeaway. There’s no answer. John sets the bags down on the kitchen counter and begins to fill the kettle for tea. He turns the switch and reaches up to get a teabag out of the cabinet. There, beside the box of Tetley’s is a cigar box that wasn’t there before. John opens the box, dismayed, seeing some sort of heroin kit. Presumably Sherlock’s.
“Okay, well, I won’t let you drown.”
Greg lets go of John and reaches out for Molly. He dips her immediately and they both break out in a fit of laughter. Sherlock grabs John’s hands and spins him under his arms, back around, and pulls him in close to his body. They move slowly with their eyes shut until they both hear moaning. Their heads whip around at the sound simultaneously. They're nearly cheek-to-cheek as they observe Greg and Molly kissing hotly.
). But that’s nothing compared to his intimate moment with Velvet's new drummer, Julien Delaplace. Rumour has it that Britain's hottest rockstar has left Sally Donovan from the punk band
“That’s… brilliant!”
, he thinks. He reluctantly gets dressed, dreading the heat and confines of jeans and a jumper.
“What the
“How about we sit for a minute, eh?”
John growls and pulls Sherlock closer, noticing the other man’s erection for the first time. He looks down and then back to Sherlock.
or something. But you’re saying you’re not actually…that?”
A couple of hours later, Sherlock awakens to a light knock at the bedroom door, Greg poking his head in.
“So you were using heroin?” John frowns and purses his lips.
Sherlock and Julien are huddled up together at the bar, chatting.
“Stay?”
“Ok, I’m going to start with your shoulders,” he whispers.
“You’re not wrong,” John contemplates then looks over to Sherlock, “but I hope you’re not referring to drugs.”
“Soft,” John murmurs, looking into Sherlock’s eyes again. “Everything is so fucking soft. Want to feel mine?”
Sherlock has both hands in his curly mop, pulling his hair through his fingers from root to tip. “Touch it,” He moves his head in closer to John, leaning over the bed. He looks like a cat demanding to be stroked. John plunges in his hand and fingers his hair back from the forehead to crown.
“No... No, It’s fine,” John looks at Sherlock reassuringly, “Like I said, It’s all fine. Just talking. How are you feeling?”
Sherlock pulls away and looks him in the eyes. “Well, I am the only other person in this room.”
“Nonsense. Greg and I are going to walk the entire city. You won’t miss a thing.”
Sally stands with Anderson, both of them mouths wide open. “I knew it!” She finally exclaims before grabbing her bag and running toward the door.
“Okay. I’ll be right back.”
won similar honours in Select magazine. Their third release,
Least not today
“Well, what’s there to know? You already guessed the important stuff.”
John considers his options for a moment. He wants to see the Eiffel Tower, but as lovely as Molly is, there's also Anderson and Jim. Despite hating being told what to do, he decides to accompany Greg and Sherlock in the hopes of seeing as much as possible. It will be better than wandering around aimlessly as he had planned.
“Foot massage,” Sherlock says as he lifts John’s foot out of the water to demonstrate.
next month!
“The new song
You ain't never going to burn my heart out
John laughs, “Yes, but you know what I mean. The hard stuff. The oblivion of herion.”
“You were sick after the last time I was up with you?” asks John.
“I bet that does feel good. Molly, would you like to experience your first massage during euphoria?” Greg offers.
“Two nights ago, and I didn’t feel any adverse effects until last night when I woke up in a cold sweat, heart racing, and quite nauseated. I wasn’t able to sleep through the rest of the night. Today the gastrointestinal issues have mostly cleared up, but I feel anxious. As I’m sure you can see, I’m sweaty and I’m shaking,” Sherlock holds out his shaky hand, “I would really appreciate it if you could give me something to sleep.”
“Cheers,” John replies as Sherlock hands him the small glass, their fingers brushing lightly.
“Molly’s right - you should dance,” Sherlock speaks into John’s ear.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Sherlock sighs, “Oh. Sorry about that.”
The impossibly long song that had been playing ends and Greg and Molly walk over.
John looks over to Ricky, chuckling.
“Ok, hand me a towel,” Sherlock concedes.
John sits down on the bed beside Sherlock and places the back of his hand on his forehead.
When the cigarette’s out, Sherlock looks up at the top floors of the hotel, “Let’s go back up.”
“John. You’ll come with Greg and me,” Sherlock declares without taking his eyes off the map.
“I know that.”
“Take those off,” Sherlocks demands gently.
Sherlock blinks, “Can I just… just for a moment. Please.”
she’s a musical genius. Have you heard her music?”
“Fine,” Sherlock responds, diverting his eyes.
“Ok, well. Just rest here. I could tell you weren’t feeling that great on stage.”
“What?” John furrows his brow.
“I think I’m melting,” he giggles.
John chuckles, “No, I’m not. Does that disappoint you?”
“What’s going on?” John asks Greg.
We have inside info from abroad that
“I thought you weren’t sure about crossing this boundary? Are you sure you want to -”
Greg overhears John and turns around to face them, “Go on, Johnny! A little bit won’t hurt. It’s safer than drinking!”
“Yes,” Sherlock smirks and flings on a wool deerstalker.
He reaches up to unbutton the top two buttons of Sherlock’s shirt and stares consideringly at the long porcelain neck before him.
John walks over to Greg, who’s sat on an ancient sofa in the corner, “All right, Greg?”
“Dull,” Sherlock laughs as he stands up.
The kiss is a frenzied and impatient, but also deep and lascivious. When John pulls back to look at Sherlock this time, his expression could be mistaken for a man on the verge of committing murder. Sherlock wonders for a second if John might actually strike him, but a quick deduction - tight grip, pulse racing, eyes nearly black, the hardness he feels pressing against his thigh – tells him that desire, not anger, is the overriding force guiding his friend.
“Ok,” John takes his wrist to check his pulse, “I’m going to give you a Beta Blocker first of all for the physical symptoms of anxiety. You can take them twice a day for a few days; that should help with your heart rate and the shakiness. I’ll also give you a small dose of Ativan to help you relax and hopefully sleep. You’ll need to drink loads of water. I can give you some IV fluids if you haven’t been able to keep down liquids.”
“A bit more human.”
“Ok. Right. Let's hit the pavement.”
It means,
“Loneliness is and always has been the central and inevitable experience of every man.”
“You mean you don’t trust
“Mmmm. Thank you, John. For this, and everything. It was,” He pauses, “fun.”
“I don’t know!" John throws his hands up, exasperated, "forget I asked.”
“Why not? Though I think we’ll need to reposition ourselves a bit. Sherlock, trade places with me!” They both stand up, crossing each other in the deepest part of the jacuzzi. Suddenly, Sherlock stops and reaches out to give Molly a brief and unexpected hug.
“Thanks. I appreciate it. I wasn’t sure how you’d take it. I’ll worry about you, of course.” He looks over to Sherlock.
Sally takes a few steps over toward John, “Piss off, John. I’m here to see Molly.” She takes a drag of her cigarette then flicks it to the ground before she turns back to Anderson.
John frowns and shakes his head. "I'd rather you report this."
“You’ve taken care of her during a recent drug problem, not in New Zealand, I assume. She’ll have gone there for a fresh start. Recently. That, and in Paris you mentioned you don’t talk much.”
“Oh, you know how the media is. Anything to create intrigue, sell a story.”
“Hmmm, just a bit beat up from the stomach pumping, other than that, fine.”
Sherlock turns, hesitates a moment, then slowly brings a hand up to John's shoulder with a squeeze.
As John enters his hotel, he shakes the rain off his umbrella and looks up to the lift in front of him. He had considered bringing Marika to the club the others were headed to, or back to his room, but found he couldn’t be arsed. In fact, at the moment, he wants nothing more than for the tour to be over...
“Well, it is what it is. We’re fine at the moment.”
He doesn’t really feel like sitting any longer, and he has an unprecedented yearning for human contact. He reaches for Sherlock’s hand and is pulled to his feet, immediately enveloped in his long, thin arms.
“One, two, three!” Greg shouts and the three of them take their shots of the bitter liqueur.
. The acoustics in the larger venue give their music a haunting quality, and the band really know how to play off the cheering audience, particularly Sherlock. For someone who makes it very clear that he’s often bored, on stage he’s the embodiment of charisma and charm. He sings and moves like he’s sharing his deepest secrets with close friends rather than thousands of strangers. His tight jeans and black fitted t-shirt are a sharp contrast to the others’ more grunge-influenced look, and John muses to himself that Sherlock’s lithe, darkly-clad figure wouldn’t look out of place in the 70’s punk scene - minus the pins and studs, of course. The music, however, is distinctly modern; moody, yet polished.
“It’s,” John clears his throat, “fine.”
“That, and we dumped a tray of ice cubes down your pants.”
John hesitates a moment, then says reluctantly, “Mycroft, I’m actually thinking of going to New Zealand to work. My sister’s there.”
the handsome Frenchman, formerly of
“Are you following me?” He smiles and shakes his head, turning to descend into the metro without making a purchase.
“Oh, I don’t mind! Mrs Turner next door’s got married ones!” She beams at John, “Anyway, what you need, Sherlock, is a nice bath and a hot toddy to fix you up.”
“I know it’s fine,” Sherlock quips back.
“Sorry.” Sherlock murmurs.
John hesitates, then reaches forward to cup Sherlock’s face. Their lips come together, hard and rough for an instant, then soft and searching. Sherlock brings his hands down to the nape of John’s neck and they match each other’s pace.
“Sex, drugs and rock n’ roll?”
Without hesitation, Sherlock walks up to the drunk man, catching his gaze and narrowing his eyes. “You think you can just do what you please to Molly? Is that what you think?!” Then without waiting on his response, Sherlock’s fist collides with Jim’s jaw. Jim gasps, then a painful groan escapes him when Sherlock’s other fist makes contact with his stomach. Sherlock steps back, looking around at the group that has gathered round.
Please don’t put your life in the hands
“Yeah, everything was spot on. Sherlock, you were incredible as usual, you git,” smiles Greg.
Suddenly, time is suspended for John and he pauses. He realises this kiss is unlike the previous ones in Amsterdam, which could be explained away by the brain rush of serotonin and oxytocin. Kissing Sherlock here and now is deliberate, this would change everything. His own emotions – anger, tenderness, lust – and actions are taking him by surprise. He momentarily considers pulling away, but John’s body and not his mind takes action. He swiftly wraps his hand around Sherlock’s neck, opening his mouth and gasping in Sherlock’s breath before sliding in his tongue searchingly, shifting the atmosphere from tentative to insistent. At first, Sherlock receives the kiss passively, then, like a light switching on, John’s kiss is reciprocated. Sherlock sucks at John’s lower lip before offering his own tongue in return. Their teeth clash together lightly before their tongues meet. The world around both of them fades away.
he thinks, but he’s not sure if that’s what he really wants. This train of thought, however, gets him thinking that today is the last day he’ll see Sherlock in who-knows-how-long. Not just Sherlock, but Greg and Molly too. His heavy heart makes him wonder if skipping out on the American tour and moving to New Zealand is a good move, but it’s a bit late to second guess himself now.
“I’ll give you an Ibuprofen as well, then.”
A few minutes of silence pass as the two men stroll whilst taking in the sights.
“Where’s John?” Sherlock snaps, ignoring the compliment.
Sherlock just chuckles and holds John at arm's length, “Music? Music!” He grins and swiftly kisses John’s forehead before turning away and walking back to the record player. He takes out a different vinyl and puts it on. There’s a smooth guitar melody and silky male voice singing about doomed love.
“From what?!” John snaps.
“Can I… can I kiss you? Properly?” Sherlock looks into John’s eyes with serious focus, his pupils blown impossibly wide.
“I think tonight proved that you’re, in the very least, not averse to excitement, John.”
It’s early evening but no jackets are required as the group walks along the streets of Amsterdam. The smell of flowers is in the air, and there’s a festive atmosphere amongst the masses. With no show today, the band have the day to recuperate after nearly a week of consecutive performances. Greg, Molly, and Anderson spent the day exploring, while Sherlock and Julien caught
“Well, I’m here as your doctor, after all,” John laughs sheepishly, looking over to the hot tub, “Everyone seems to forget that, including me sometimes.”
“Usually, yes. But it’s certainly gorgeous to look at right now.”
As the door opens onto the room, he sees Sherlock in the bed, hair a mess, drowsy looking, but awake. He perks up a bit when John enters.
Sherlock lies still in the tub as John sits on the covered toilet seat reading.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Mycroft briskly walks in the direction John has just come from while John hesitates outside the hospital door. He takes a deep breath, preparing to see his friend in a hospital bed before turning the handle.
“Plenty of water! Yes, you’ve only said it a hundred times, mate!” Greg laughs and slaps John on the back.
“Hmmm. You can stay here, you know. I’ll be in America - even if I wasn’t. Until you leave for New Zealand, that is.”
“Right, I’m sure that’s what you’re interested in, Anderson,” Greg quips, “Actually, I’ve got a treat for us tonight, kids.”
When John reaches the lobby, he’s surprised to see the whole group standing in a circle, looking mostly revived, apparently discussing their plans for the day.
Sherlock heaved a sigh. “Really, John? There are seventeen-no, eighteen, indicators that you are lying.” Without taking a breath he continued, “If I were not in my boxers, maybe I would illuminate you as to what they are. As it is, I would appreciate it greatly if you returned to your room right now; I’ll clear up the glass in the morning.”
I know I don’t need to explain why I’m doing this. You already know. I can’t live like this forever. It’s been over a year and it’s not getting any better.  Please don’t come looking for me. You won’t find me. You’ve been a better friend to me than I deserve.  You’re so good a friend that I know you’d have half of London out looking for me if …
Sherlock took a moment to recover. “And what if I were to stand inside the bedroom? What would tradition dictate then”?
“If you’re real, tell me something my subconscious would not know.”
“I care because you care, Sherlock. John has had a difficult time recently and I’m sorry to say that you’re the cause of that. You need to be prepared that he might not want to see you.”
“Y’know, traditionally, it’s considered pretty creepy to stand in the dark outside someone’s bedroom.”
“What were you dreaming about, Sherlock?”
“Tea’s ready.”
There is no clock in the room, but judging by the darkness outside, it has been at least six hours since it last looked like he was going to wake up. The lump in my throat and the dread in the pit of my stomach remains, but the adrenaline has long gone. My damned body keeps making me drift into sleep, but I must stay awake.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Just believe me, you idiot.”
How are you, John? – MH
“Please don’t leave. Let me help you”, John pleaded.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Give me one week. Surely you can keep him safe for that long? – SH
“Nurse!” I shouted at the top of my voice. “Nurse!”
“Do you need something, Dr Watson? Are you in pain?” she asked.
What’s happened? – SH
Don’t ask silly questions. – MH
Sherlock wriggled to free himself but only succeeded in turning his body around so that he and John were not facing each other.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Believe it, brother. I had to intervene but played my hand badly. – MH
“Of course I want to leave. I just don’t feel like a need to be sedated at the moment. I’m a medical man, I can make that judgement.” I said.
My knees buckled from underneath me out of sheer relief. Mycroft gestured towards one of the security guards to hoist me back up. I wiped at my face trying to hide the tears that had appeared. I hated Mycroft seeing me out of control. To be fair, Mycroft did not seem to be enjoying it in this instance either.
“You want this. Your pupils are dilated, your breathing is accelerated, you heart‐rate has increased.” Sherlock eyes darted towards John’s cock which was making its presence known through his boxers. “You want this,” Sherlock repeated with an hypnotic air. Still, he sounded less than totally certain. He paused.
John became absolutely lost in the moment. Looking down at the flushed and vulnerable Sherlock, he stilled as a wave of emotion ran through him. Unconsciously, he moved his face towards Sherlock’s and glanced down at this plump lips before returning to look him in the eye. Sherlock stopped struggling. They stared at each other panting from the physical exertion. Just as John moved to release Sherlock, Sherlock lifted his face and kissed John chastely on the lips.
“Brother. How nice to see you. I trust your trip went well,” he said.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
A petite woman entered the room looking a little startled, no doubt at the panic in my voice.
Sherlock considered John for a moment. He could barely think straight but forced himself to make some deductions.
, Watson. I needed information. How else could I have got it, in the time required?’ He turned on me. ‘And I don’t recall you being quite so squeamish at the time.’
.’ He sounds hurt, he even
It was whilst he was in his room, making more noise than was strictly necessary for a gentleman preparing for an afternoon of musical entertainment, that our landlady appeared at the door of our rooms.
‘Yes, thank you, Mrs Hudson.’ I looked pointedly at the door. She fixed our client with another disapproving glare, as if challenging her to make away with the silver, and then left abruptly, huffing down the stairs.
He breathed out in relief. ‘Oh thank God. If I lost this now, after-‘
He turned towards his room. As he reached the door, I felt hope drain away, and I said to his retreating back, ‘It’s love.’
‘Please, Holmes. Forget everything I said. I have no wish to lose your friendship over this.’
He exhaled sharply. ‘Well, that is kind of you to say.’
I returned to my place in front of the fire, but I was no longer interested in my paper. The conversation replayed in my mind.
‘There is a....person... downstairs, Doctor, who is insisting that she would like to consult Mr Holmes.’ Mrs Hudson could not have looked more disapproving if it were Moriarty himself, back from the grave.
I drew a shuddering breath. The idea of moving back to my lonely cot was more than I could stand. Before I could stop myself, I whispered, ‘May I stay with you?' I felt him tense to draw away. ‘Please. Just for now.'
He stared at me. ‘Eight days?’ I could see him calculating in his head. He reached his conclusion and looked at me in barely concealed panic. ‘Watson, I – ,’ he crossed the room to me, moved as if to embrace me then stopped, uncertain, almost stammering, ‘The case, you see, the case. I didn’t mean to – God, I have neglected you entirely.’ He was gazing anxiously at my face, trying to deduce my response. ‘John. Please forgive me.’
The flat is unusually quiet, so John reaches the doorway of his own room before realising Sherlock is even home. When he sees the tags in Sherlock’s hands he says, a sudden rush of apprehension making his voice even sharper than he intended, ‘We’ve talked about you going through my things.’ He holds a hand out for the tags.
‘I’m delighted for you.’ I said sincerely.
The drug affects him in a way I am horribly familiar with. He becomes languorous, his movements slow, that great brain idled. It doesn’t seem to be having that effect on me. I am across the room, at the door, and locking it before he can react. The metal key is deliciously smooth and cool in my hand. I pocket it and smile at him.
He laughed. ‘I am a lone traveller and confirmed bachelor. At my age, that is plenty of eccentricity to be going along with. And besides, you flatter me. My accomplishments, such as they are, are entirely undeserving of such praise.’
John stares at him across the room, struck. He says, ‘Sherlock,’ swallows, forces himself to continue, ‘Of course I loved – love – you. Of
The euphoria is fading but his hand on my face is still a source of tender sparks. I lean my head into his hand, chasing the sensation. I almost miss the flash of his rare smile as he does not pull away, but rests his hand more fully against my cheek. I lean into it, feeling a peaceful lethargy begin to settle in my bones.
And it's so fucking hopeful and sincere that John feels his heart tighten in his chest. He won’t fuck this up. He won’t lose this, not again. He draws away slightly, enough to look to the floor where the dog tags fell at some point, disregarded by both. He picks them up, removes Sherlock’s, and hands it to him.
I walked across London in a daze. I had no destination in mind, but I knew I couldn’t be at Baker Street without saying something irreparable. Eventually my steps began to find a destination. I needed a friend, someone to talk to, who would listen without judgement. After less than an hour of walking, I found myself outside James’ rooms.
‘Which he has apparently done,’ I said, scanning through the letter. ‘He says he has enjoyed my stories very much, had no idea I had any literary ability-‘ this caused me to smile inwardly – it was just the sort of thing James would say. From the tone of his letter he had changed little in the intervening years - ‘and,’ I continued, ‘he is an admirer of yours.’
It was early evening by the time I arrived. ‘Doctor, oh Doctor!' Mrs Hudson appeared the moment I opened the door to 221B and seized my hand, positively dragging me towards the stairs. ‘I'm so glad to see you. Mr Holmes said you might be gone some time, but I knew you wouldn't leave him in such straits.' She patted my hand approvingly.
‘No,’ he recoils, shakes his head. ‘This is very different. You are different.’
I looked at my friend. He had stopped explaining and was looking at me, a slight frown creasing his brow. I became aware that I was not reacting in the usual way to this demonstration of his cleverness. The knowledge made me angry at both of us, and the emotion loosened my tongue.
‘No, Holmes! No doctor.’ I spread my hands. ‘We have a doctor!’ for some reason the thought tickles me, and I laugh. ‘I am here.’
‘You can. Trust me.’ I kissed him again. He thrust into my hand, over and over, his breath coming in shallow bursts. I breathed against his cheek, ‘That’s it love. Come for me.’ I squeezed his length, running my thumb over the leaking head. His body convulsed beneath me as he came with a cry that was almost a sob, tears standing in his eyes. He moaned my name incoherently as I stroked him through it, pressing kisses to his bare skin. I had never seen anything so erotic in all my life. I was painfully hard, but it seemed almost irrelevant after seeing the man I loved; my aloof, reserved, sometimes distant friend, so utterly undone. I loved him so entirely in that moment I thought my heart would burst.
I regard my roommate with equanimity. ‘So let us test your theory that this mixed solution is entirely harmless.’
, glad of the opportunity to hide my expression. She began speaking again carefully and slowly, as though this little speech had been rehearsed.  I noted down salient points in what I hoped was an appropriate manner, although my mind was whirling.
‘Mary.’
She looked up at me then and said, ‘Be gentle with him, Doctor, please.'
I frowned. ‘Holmes, you can’t possibly know that, you haven’t even seen her. It’s on the mantelpiece, next to the skull. Behind the knife.’
He smiled then, some of his uncertainly falling away. He bent to kiss me, almost shyly, murmuring, ‘Always.’ I felt I thrill run through me as I reached for the ties of his nightshirt, loosening them one at a time, and revealing the pale skin beneath. I ran my hands possessively across his chest as I pushed his nightshirt away entirely. I wanted to see all of him. He shivered, and I murmured, ‘Cold hands?’
He crosses the room, telegraphing his every move, and takes me by the arm, leading me back to the settee as one would a skittish animal. I find his exaggerated care amusing. His hand on my arm is incredibly warm, even through layers of fabric.
He huffed a resigned sigh. ‘Very well.’ He looked at me. ‘You obviously have some notion how we should proceed.’
‘Not to anyone else, perhaps. Was she right?’
He waits for Sherlock to roll his eyes at his ongoing stupidity, but he doesn’t. He just carries on, in that uncertain voice, ‘Interested. In - that sort of thing.’
I slammed the letter down on the table. ‘Holmes, stop.' I didn’t want to hear anything else he might deduce.
He takes it in confusion. John closes his hand over it, says, ‘I never want to need that, Sherlock, you understand? No stupid heroic gestures, no unnecessary risks. This is –’ his voice chokes, and he tries again, ‘This –’ he gestures between them ‘- is too important, right?’
I said, ‘You were going to give a speech? About Holmes’ behaviour being unacceptable?’
These thoughts had distracted me, or I would have noticed Lestrade before he hailed me on the doorstep.
His breathing became laboured and I looked at him in concern. He had turned his face away from me. After a moment the dim light revealed glistening tracks on his cheek. I reached up and traced one wonderingly with my thumb. ‘Sherlock,’ I said, moved almost beyond endurance.
‘I don’t think-‘ I began, then stopped.
Reassured, she continued, ‘But ‘e didn’t mind, said ‘arry was a fool to let me go, and he’d be honoured if I would consider walkin’ out with him a couple of evenin’s. Such lovely words ‘e always had.’ She smiled happily as I struggled to reconcile this romantic image with my own knowledge of Holmes, even as she continued, ‘An’ it turned into nearly every evenin’, he was so keen,’ she caught herself, adding seriously, ‘but always a perfect gentleman.’
I fumbled for the words. He had not so much as looked at me with anything other than friendship in more than a week. Had barely noticed me at all, other than as colleague on the case. ‘It’s just...we have not, in the last week or more, and I thought-‘ I broke off, fearful lest I betray my anxiety on the subject.
I rested my head on his shoulder, feeling tiredness creep over me.
‘So if Mr Holmes could just find ‘im, like, an’ I could mebbe see ‘im, or, or even write, if ‘arry could help me. Just to end the engagement, official-like, and see that ‘e’s ‘appy....’
‘I’m sorry to-‘ I began, but he cut me off with a wave.
I smiled and rose, opening the door for her. ‘Mrs Hudson will show you out.’ Our landlady had appeared as if by magic at the foot of the stairs. ‘And we will contact you shortly.’
I blinked. ‘You seem awfully certain.’ An obvious reason suggested itself. ‘Perhaps, he didn’t seem like the kind of person to...fall in love.’
I said, ‘James, whatever happens –‘
‘Years ago, John. I said so
my mind supplied.
I looked at him fondly. This was my Holmes. I was almost overcome in that moment with the desire to kiss him. To claim him as my love, as he had always been my friend.
Lestrade bridled. ‘I would hardly be likely to disturb Mr Holmes for a matter of little import.’
Radiating resigned disapproval, our landlady turned back to the staircase. As she departed, Holmes appeared, still not appropriately apparelled for the concert, but at least in the right suit, collar open and hair awry. ‘Mrs Hudson is right, Watson, this is highly unlikely to be of any interest. Where is my blue cravat?’ I forget sometimes how excellent my friend’s hearing is.
James looked up and gave me another of his wry smiles, but this time there was a bitter edge to it. 'Are you really going to make me sit here and convince you of the correct course of action? Because I think I have expended my reserves of nobility this evening. The man is clearly a heartless bastard. Stay here.’
His arms tightened reflexively around me. ‘Rubbish. I won’t hear such nonsense.’
I remembered times he had taken my arm, held my hand, brushed my shoulder. How had I thought I was the only one taking comfort from those small signs of affection?
After long minutes, as I quieted, I came somewhat to myself. ‘I'm sorry,' I muttered. I still couldn't release his hand. He moved his other hand to my back, rubbing small circles.
Holmes had begun to pace in front of the mantle. After a moment he stopped and again stared into the flames. His voice trembled slightly as he began, and then gained in certainty as he went on. ‘I am a vain and selfish man.' I stared at him in disbelief. ‘All my life I have done as I wished, with no thought for the feelings of others.' I wanted to interrupt, to point out the demonstrable untruth of this statement, but he continued, ‘I have always believed the solution, the ending of a criminal career would justify almost any means. Too late, I fear, I have realised I may be wrong. In pursuing my investigations, I have twice now caused you distress. To do so once may be forgiven, I think, as in my haste to dismiss the softer feelings from my calculations; I had not anticipated the hurt I would cause. To do so twice, however, is entirely unforgiveable.'
After a while James said, ‘Well, I understand your anger. Even by the standards of great men, that behaviour is….eccentric.’
He was standing only a step away in the firelight, his hand still resting on my arm. I was almost overcome with the pathetic desire to step into his arms and be held. I made to move away, but as if divining my thoughts he took a step forward, and put his arms awkwardly around my shoulders. For a moment I froze in surprised pleasure, then quickly wound my arms around him before he could change his mind and move away. In my haste, my hand slipped beneath his dressing gown, leaving only his nightshirt between my hand and his bare skin. He hissed and I made to move away, worried lest this was an intimacy too far, too soon, but his wiry strength held me in place and his voice murmured in my ear, ‘Watson, your hands are freezing.’ I huffed a relieved laugh against his neck. ‘I’m sorry,’ I replied, in a tone that hardly conveyed repentance. He murmured back in a reproachful voice, ‘And you a doctor.’
I frowned. ‘I don’t recall you mentioning it to me beforehand; if you had I certainly would have objected.’
Sherlock looks at him. He doesn’t understand. John can see it, and he’s suddenly too tired to explain it.
‘For trusting me.’
In spite of the late hour, he was still awake, and welcomed me with genuine fondness, if some surprise.
As I draw near home, I noticed a light still glowing behind the curtains in our sitting room. Holmes must have left it on when he retired, I thought. So I was gladdened to see the man himself in his dressing gown, curled up on his chair in front of the still smouldering embers of the fire. He was wrapped in a blanket which slipped to the ground as he stood. He looked me over briefly and moved to the sideboard, pouring a drink.
I raised a hand to stop her. ‘Mr Holmes gives me a great deal of discretion in these matters. In certain circumstances we have waived a fee altogether if there is little effort required to reach a conclusion. I feel sure that this will be one of those cases.’
Lestrade grabbed my arm and roughly pulled me in front of a mirror; I hardly recognised myself. The body in the mirror was way too thin. My hair was unwashed, greasy and in need of a cut. Dark shadows emphasised the bags under my eyes and my beard was a straggly mess. I pulled away from Lestrade in shame, anger rising within me that I had allowed him to see me like this. I tried to be nonchalant.
John looked like a rabbit caught in headlights. He took a large gulp of tea and opened his mouth to confess he wanted more. Had wanted more since the first day they had met. At the last second, his courage failed him.
“Could you give us a minute please, Doctor?” She remained unmoved so I got up and ushered her towards the door. “We have an important matter to discuss, you may return in a few minutes”.
“If that was an attempt to make me believe you do not need to be calmed, Doctor Watson, I’m afraid you’ve failed.” The doctor viewed John determinedly and before I knew what I was doing, I intervened.
John could see Sherlock’s mind racing, making deductions, worrying.
Still, I could not believe it.
“John.”
Which means his chance of survival is low and you’re trying to protect me. Who was it? Why? –SH
?????  – SH
“I’m fine, Greg. Nothing a meal and a haircut won’t fix. How’re things at the Yard?”
John winced as he saw the mask, which Sherlock usually wore in his dealing with those such as Anderson, come down and rearrange his face into a haughty glare.
Silence.
John had not expected Sherlock to come to the kitchen to get it and his mouth curled upwards in amusement when Sherlock did not moved nor acknowledge that he had heard John. John took their mug into the living room. He placed Sherlock’s on the coffee table with a loud thud which jerked Sherlock out of his reverie.
“Don’t make me leave. Please.”
“That’s better.” I laughed, still crying.
John paused, not knowing what to do next. Clearly, Sherlock was having a nightmare and he could not decide whether to wake him or not. On the one hand, Sherlock was an immensely private individual; one who denied his capacity for emotion. On the other hand, John knew what it was like to be trapped in a nightmare and it choked him to see Sherlock’s suffering.
“Let’s get back upstairs, shall we? Mrs Hudson’ll have a fit if she finds us here like this”.
I don’t mean you need to talk to me but talk to someone. I am sorry. - MH
“Please be assured that I don’t want to hurt you, but if you refuse to let go of me this instant, I will not be held culpable for my actions. Final warning. Let me go or I’ll be forced to use physical force.”
My hallucination stood up and appeared in my line of sight.
“This argument is pointless. I am going in there. I can and will cause problems to direct your attention elsewhere if you…”
“You don’t even sound like him.”
“What have I missed? There’s always something. What is it?”
“John.”
“I still have to go in there,” I countered.
“My God, John. What have you done to yourself?”
“With due respect, I’m hardly going to be able to do much apart from rest whilst I’m restricted to this bed, am I?”
“John...Please...I...Not good…”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and flopped down dramatically onto the bed.
A terror gripped me when the doctor announced that I was to be sedated and I ended up shouting at the poor woman. Forcing myself to calm down, I tried to pinpoint the reason I was so afraid and although it was pathetic, I had to admit to myself that I was afraid I would re-awaken to find Sherlock had left. Obviously, I could not tell him that. Sherlock had managed to get rid of the doctor and was expecting me to explain why I was refusing a sedative, though. I had to say something.
“It’s only to help with the pain, I’ll just…”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Sherlock nodded dumbly and John huffed out some air in a scoff.
“I’m real. I staged it. You’re not mad, John.”
I am so ashamed of the way I reacted. Another mention of his name caused me to fly into an uncontrollable fury. I slammed my hands on the table in front of me and shoved everything off it. I turned towards Lestrade, fists raised, and started grappling with him. His hands gripped my shoulders tightly and I struggled against him. It was like I was disconnected from myself. Some small part of me was watching what I was doing and was urging me to stop, but I was beyond being able to control myself.  Eventually, I just started crying. Poor Lestrade didn’t know what to do.
Please leave me alone.  I just wanted to say thanks.   - JW
The punch was a surprise. I removed some tissues from the box next to the bed and staunched the blood running from my nose.  I sat back down in my chair, pulling it back and out of John’s reach whilst watching his face, trying to figure out how much to tell him.
It’s time to come back.  – MH
A tsunami of emotion washed over me. This was real. The nurse had seen him, interacted with him. And he had obviously done something to annoy her, as was typical of him, because she seemed to hate him already.
John is in intensive care..  – MH
“I know you’re going to think…” I started, but the apparition interjected.
“I heard a noise and came to check everything was alright. Then I tripped over my own foot on the way out. Like an idiot. And...I...uhm...accidentally fell onto your lamp”, John babbled. He had the urge to swallow loudly but refrained from doing so lest it become a sign of incrimination.
Sherlock? – MH
“You need to snap out of this. It’s nearly been a year” he murmured.
He stayed frozen to the spot trying to hear whether John was packing; he knew it was a strong possibility. John always ran away from emotion. Suddenly, the door swung open.
The very idea that John might have wanted more terrified and thrilled Sherlock in equal measure. All this time he had been concentrating on hiding his own feelings, he had never thought to look for anything more than amiability from John. He re‐lived every past interaction with John in his head with a renewed perspective. He cursed himself for not noticing sooner, and, although his usual assuredness had deserted him, he got up determinedly and walked towards John’s bedroom.
As I pushed her out of the room, I muttered a thank you and spun back around to face John once again.
The nurse pointedly ignored Sherlock. “Well, there’s a reservoir down the corridor. I’m sure your visitor here wouldn’t mind getting you some,” she huffed. “Give me a shout if you need anything, I’ll be around.”
Sherlock sat up and uncovered his eyes. “Whatever do you mean?”, his eyes were piercing and intense.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I have no idea why that was a silly question, but I will not give Mycroft the satisfaction of asking him. One could assume that he has no experience of working with agents undercover. Texting for idle chit-chat? I suppose he has just remembered he has a brother and wanted reassurance that I am still alive. That, or someone up top wants progress on the operation. There’s no point in me dwelling on the strangeness of it. Boring. I need to focus on other matters.
Then why ask at all? – JW
There was no time to play his silly games. He was obviously aware of what I would want to know and I had a dreadful feeling that he was delaying from telling me something I did not want to hear.
“By virtue of how you came to be in this room, I think your judgement is impaired. Wouldn’t you say?” His voice was barely above a whisper and he sounded exhausted. A wave of guilt washed over me and I had to look away from his dejected staring. We were not having this conversation.
He turned and walked away slowly. I was free to enter the room.
What a fool I was to fall asleep. John clearly thought he was hallucinating. I did not know what to do or say. There is no precedent, no data available on how one should act in the event one comes back from the dead. I just wanted him to stop crying;  I could not bear to see those tears streaming down his face. I was close to crying myself; I barely managed to control it. It would not have helped John believe I was real if I started acting so out of character. I reeled back the emotions that were coursing through me and focused on logic and getting him to believe me.
After a moment frozen in shock, John ran after Sherlock. He turned just in time to see Sherlock’s coat billowing out of the door of their flat. John almost fell down the stairs in his attempt to catch up. He reached out and grabbed Sherlock’s wrist just as Sherlock’s other hand clasped the door knob.
“There you go”, he said. “Drink.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“It was touch and go for a while,” he ruminated. “I did what I had to do.”
“Is it?” John asked warily.
“Now I’m doing what I have to do. Don’t try to stop me, Mycroft.”
I tried to return to Baker Street after the funeral. I knew I would be unable to continue living there, not with the memories of Sherlock seeping through every pore of the place. I did need to pack my belongings, though. I ran up the stairs trying to trick myself into walking through the door before I lost the courage but came to a stand-still right outside the door willing myself to open it. My arm did not comply with my brain’s request. I think it was some sort of self-preservation kicking in. Subconsciously, I had acknowledged I would be unable to cope with seeing everything as Sherlock had left it, awaiting his return. I felt light-headed and sat at the top of the stairs to stop my legs from buckling from underneath me. Mrs Hudson appeared and made the journey towards me warily as if I was a skittish animal. She sat next to me in silence waiting for me to speak.
I honestly thought I had had a mental breakdown when I saw Sherlock sat by my hospital bed. I considered him numbly as if he were a foreign object, my brain trying to catch up with what I was seeing; Sherlock slumped in a chair asleep. When the ridiculousness of the situation dawned on me, I resorted to a state of hysteria; laughing and crying simultaneously. I stared at the ceiling above me trying to figure out whether I would want the apparition to still be there when I looked back towards the chair.
There was a long silence before Sherlock finally decided to speak.
“You have to accept what happened. Sherlock…”
Before I could ponder on it too much, the doctor returned to the room and asked whether I had seen sense yet. I allowed myself to be sedated safe in the knowledge that Sherlock would be there when I woke up.
Halfway up the stairs to his room, he heard Sherlock utter “Don’t go”, but he pretended not to hear.
Sherlock covered his eyes with his hand again. “John, we really don’t need to talk. We are two available men who wish to partake in sexual activity. I can’t think of a single thing that needs to be ‘discussed’, as you put it.”
“What are you doing in my room?” Sherlock demanded.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
John suddenly became aware that Sherlock was shuddering beneath him. They were right next to the draughty front door and Sherlock had neglected to actually dress himself before putting on his coat. However, John could feel the heat radiating from him.
“What?”
“This morning I was in Minsk, here is a napkin from the café from which I bought a coffee. Here is my phone. You can use the search engine to check the café exists.”
Gunshot to the chest: punctured lung and internal bleeding. – MH
“I phrased that wrong. He cannot see you yet.”
Mycroft. - SH
Sherlock tried to yank his wrist from from John’s grasp, but John was too strong.
“I SAID NO!”. This was not like John and before I could set my mask, my eyebrow shot into the air. “Sorry,” he continued, catching a hold of himself. “Sorry, I do not want to be sedated.”
I texted Mycroft to get John’s laptop brought to the hospital so I had more data to figure out what has happened here. John has lost an inordinate amount of weight. His hair has thinned and contains much more grey. Deep lines have appeared on his face and he has several days beard growth. He has been chewing on the skin on his fingers. His limp must be back because his shoes have worn down unevenly. Everything points to what Mycroft said about suicide being true. I must be missing something. I need him to wake up and tell me what has happened so I can fix it. It has to be fixable.
“Just tell me if he’s going to live.”
“Stop.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“Don’t say his name.”
It’s the anniversary today; I can’t do this anymore.
“Anderson still doing your head in?”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“I can’t go in there,” I admitted.
John felt stupid now he had a chance to think about things. Sherlock had never shown any romantic interest in anyone. Ever. Even when Irene was throwing herself at him and they had that intense bond between them. Even when he had Janine on a plate. He was married to his work. John flushed with embarrassment for having thought he could be anything more than a distraction; a way to chase away the remnants of a nightmare.
“Great. If you don’t want to drink, you can talk.”
John’s heart stopped but he could feel Sherlock’s heart beating wildly. He leant down and kissed Sherlock gently on the side of his neck, beneath his jaw bone. Sherlock moaned helplessly as John inhaled his scent. Their lips met again and this time they did not leave each other until they both became desperate for air.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I have to do this for Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade. And for John. Moriarty’s gone but his network remains. I have to bring it down; there’s no way that Moriarty would have been so lax as to not have a back-up plan in the event that I somehow survived. I have to go; it is the rational decision. I cannot let emotions weaken me.
I was terrified.  Mycroft said that he would be okay and I could see nothing in his medical notes to indicate that he would not pull through. I just could not shake the fear that gripped me. Although I could view the heart monitor, I had to reassure myself when I first entered the room. I wrapped my hand around his wrist to feel myself that his pulse was still beating. I sat there willing, almost praying, for him to wake up.
“John, would you just stop it?” The apparition pulled down the sleeves of its suit jackets and awkwardly wiped the tears from my face. “It’s perfectly simple. I pretended to die to fool Moriarity.”
“Surely it’s part of your job to not let your patients die from dehydration.”
“It seemed to me to be the opposite of boring. What is so boring that it makes you scream so loudly that I’m surprised Mrs Hudson hasn’t phoned the police?”
It was a suicide attempt. -MH
John raised an eyebrow. “I’d like to see you try”, he challenged. “Army, remember? Don’t be such a bloody drama queen.”
“Ermm…yes.”
“Look, Sherlock…”
“Mate, I know that you miss Sherlock. I do too, but life goes on. You can’t carry on like this.”
“Are you okay”? he asked gently.
John dropped the gas lamp in alarm, the glass breaking into a hundred pieces. His eyes snapped towards Sherlock who had jumped up out of bed, now awake and looking terrified.
Something snapped inside a quantum of hope began welling up that this could be real; I stamped it down as hard as I could.
What are you sorry for? He was your brother, not mine.–JW
“Of course, you know you won’t be able to see him yet,” he said icily.
Sherlock’s decision made, he yanked the arm that John was holding above his head, pulling John towards him. In counter-attack, John slammed into his ribs and twisted around to kick the back of Sherlock’s knee so that he buckled to the floor. Before Sherlock could get up off his knees, John pushed his whole body to the floor from behind, pinning both wrists down and weighing him down.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“LET ME GO!”, Sherlock commanded.
Greg,
Now. –SH
“Sherlock Holmes. Don’t you bloody ignore me. Tell me what’s wrong.”
“And you’re a bloody terrific liar, which is why I don’t know whether to believe you when you say there was no other way. Another way that didn’t involve you going off gallivanting leaving me to grieve for you for TWO FUCKING YEARS!”
You’re not always right. You must have missed something. – SH
“Why did you call me back here so urgently if you did not want me to see him?” I asked.
“Interesting.”
“I’m waiting for an answer, Sherlock.”
I furiously tried to read his face for any clue of what was to come.
“Not possible. I have to be in there,” I said trying to gauge John’s current state through the window.
The urge to call out to John as I watched him at my graveside this morning almost overwhelmed me. I cannot let that happen again. Logically, I know he’ll be fine. I know he is, or was, fond of me. It was a shock to see the state he was in nonetheless. Knowing I could halt his grief by simply announcing my presence tempted me to throw the plan out of the window. I so much do not want my only friend to suffer. He will get over it, though. John has other friends, people upon whom he can rely. For that I am glad. If the roles were reversed, I think I would be incapable of overcoming his death. I would try to bury myself in cases, but it would be so different without him beside me. I would probably allow old habits to resurface and get pulled into that world again.  John will be okay, though and I can leave knowing that. It’s time to get to work.
One week. – MH
I’m fine, thanks. – JW
It will all have been for nothing if I come back now. – SH
“I’ve fucking cracked. This is it,” I gibbered to myself.
At the beginning of this operation, I would find my thoughts drifting to think about him frequently. I was rather surprised. I am not accustomed to missing people, probably because John is the only one who has ever put up with me long enough to become a friend. If I thought about him for too long, I would become overwhelmed by the longing to be back with him. It meant I missed important clues so I made a conscious effort to banish him from my mind. It is more vital than ever that I concentrate fully on the task at hand. One more week. One week. Then I can get back to Baker Street  and we can get rid of whatever danger exists together.
“I was talking about you!”
He’s overwhelmed and after a moment’s consideration, decides that taking one of Sherlock’s Ativan will allow him to sleep through the anxiety of thinking about it. He takes the pill, washing it down with his tea before turning off the lamp.
But there are also echoes of other '70s icons such as T. Rex, Cockney Rebel and Mott The Hoople in the Velvet sound. Holmes and his four bandmates, Greg Lestrade, Molly Hooper, Phillip Anderson, and Jim Moriarty have graced the magazine covers in Britain for the past 12 months.
"Right."
"Neither did you!” John snaps back.
Velvet "have it in them to be just about the most extraordinary, intelligent and potentially enormous guitar band this country has seen in a decade," according to Q magazine. Rolling Stone has cited them 'the best new band in Britain' on its November 3rd, 1993, cover - and all before Velvet have even released a single.
“Nervous as well, to be honest. I don’t really know what to expect from all this.
“Did you just come up with that?” John asks flatly.
Sherlock looks up at John indignantly but smiles when he sees the playfulness in John’s expression. “So what about your sister then, is she in London?” Sherlock asks as John begins to remove the spent drip.
“No, I haven’t. But-”
“What is?” Greg interrupts Molly to ask.
John returns to Sherlock’s room with the IV kit and medicine.
John tries to follow the rest of the episode. He’s not sure he’s understood, but it seems as though Sherlock was right.
, thinks John, suddenly thankful for the vasoconstriction he pointed out to Anderson earlier.
John and Greg begin to move together, though a little less gracefully.
“Quite. But perhaps I’ll be able to get some real rest after the bath.”
“Good to hear I’m so boring," John forces a smile.
Sherlock’s mouth quirks into a half-smile.
"Right now, is this what you want?” John whispers.
“Yeah, go on then!” John gets up and flops onto his stomach on the bed. Sherlock walks over and sits on the back of his legs.
?” An arched eyebrow.
He looks back to the dance floor, then around for Sherlock. He’s still not in the flat as far as he can see. John walks over to the fridge to grab a beer to rid his mouth of the bitter taste. As he opens the door and peers in, he hears his name and jumps with surprise.
“Of course not, I’ve been tapering down slowly. I thought I had the exact schedule down to avoid any withdrawals, but obviously,” Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Even
, as they say?”
“Trust me,” Sherlock smiles.
, This is the Day, a blast from the past - 1983 to be exact. Now, I've got something new for you!" The animated radio host announces.
After confirming Greg’s glucose levels are back to normal, he heads toward Sherlock’s room and knocks. The door opens, and John is taken aback - Sherlock’s hair is dishevelled, there are dark circles under his eyes, and a patina of sweat coats his face. He looks absolutely awful.
When Sherlock breaks the contact, John hears a quiet whimper, presumably escaping his own lips.
Without speaking, John walks behind Sherlock and begins stroking his hair and massaging his scalp as Sherlock had done for him.
“Ah, John! Yes, you’re free to explore. In fact, the band left a few minutes ago to do just that. Of course, you have your pager if you’re needed.”
“Yes. Let’s go.” she grins back eagerly.
After a few minutes, John breaks the peaceful silence, “Right, well… I think I need a shower, what do you think?”
“John, Sally brought it today, said she was... returning it," Sherlock says meekly.
I could delete the image of Greg’s naked body.”
