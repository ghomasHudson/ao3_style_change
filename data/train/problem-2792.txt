“So tell me.”
“Well, this is me,” Donna said, turning to face him with her hands in her pockets. Dean was helpless not to smile back down at her. She was actually really cute, and if her smile were any less tired at the edges, if he himself weren’t so much of a walking bruise, well, in any other circumstance there was no way he wouldn’t shoot his shot with a woman who could not only handle a gun, but could match him waffle for waffle. Her smile turned a little smaller, a little more knowing as if she could tell what he was thinking. “Good to meet you, Dean,” she said. “Stay outta trouble.”
God, how had Cas lived without this for so many years?
“Mmhm.” She waved over her shoulder and disappeared, closing her office door pointedly behind her.
how tall he’s gotten, but like, he’s so smart and he’s gonna get into a good school and they’d be so happy, I swear.”
, but what the hell. “What the hell,” he said. “I’m in.”
“Course,” he said, lump in his throat. He washed it down with hot coffee. “But why shouldn’t I be worried?”
“Protective, I know,” Sam supplied, without looking at him.
“I’d like that.”
A tentative smile stretched the corners of her mouth, ever so slightly. “Yeah.”
That gave Dean pause. It was a damn
“Zachariah, if what you say is true my work here is more important than ever,” said Cas. “I won’t abandon my post.”
“Romantic? No.” Cas flipped the phone shut and set it down on Dean’s other side. “They don’t need to be romanticized to be called lights in the darkness. That is what they are. But more than that, there are the keepers. Every night, without fail, they must keep the light burning. They don’t know if anyone needs them. There could be no ships out on the dark sea, or there could be one passing every moment. They must have faith that what they do matters; they must work at their post each and every day believing that what they do is important. And in return…sailors have faith that the lighthouse will always be there, guiding them through the night. There is great power in this reciprocal faith,” Castiel concluded. “Don’t you think?”
Now Dean was able to form a lot of impressions from walking into a motel’s front office. How old it was, how clean the room would be, how much the owner or manager gave a shit, how hard he’d look for bedbugs, how guilty he may or may not feel committing credit card fraud there. Tired as he was, Dean could tell immediately that if he could afford it, he would not be D. Hasselhoff here.
“Good,” she said, and turned back to her computer. And with that Castiel was dismissed.
“Cas?” said Dean. “Oh shit.”
Dean felt his stomach dropping out from under him with every word, his world rewriting itself, his old instinct to protect Sam at any cost rearing its head. He squeezed the beer bottle in his hand. “Why didn’t—why didn’t you tell me? I would’ve helped you, I would’ve—”
“You too, Dr. Moseley. But it’s not my fault you left to get yourself this fancy gig.”
“Student teacher,” Cas emphasized, in case that was the issue.
The kitchen was noticeably warmer from the oven, and was filled with the rich smell of meat, tomatoes, and cheese. Sam opened the cupboard to get plates. “I miss Karen’s lasagna,” he said. “You know how to make it, right?”
Castiel rolled his bike to a stop near the Impala, where she was waiting patiently at the diner for Dean’s return. When Dean slid off the back of the bike, Cas immediately missed his warmth. Still he smiled when Dean handed him his helmet. He loved Dean all the time but he treasured moments like this, when he radiated the softness he so often hid. Sometimes Cas wished he could whisk Dean away on his bike forever, leave their baggage behind and travel light for the rest of their lives. As it was, he settled for allowing Dean this escape whenever it seemed he needed it most—and sometimes when Cas needed it most, too.
.” A bemused smile lifted up one corner of the Rider’s mouth. Dean rushed to explain. “My car’s a ‘67. Black Chevy Impala. She’s gorgeous, I keep her up myself. I’m a mechanic. I mean obviously I work at the diner but I’m a mechanic, too. That’s why I really appreciate your ride, man. I think you’d like my Baby too, maybe next time—I mean—”
Sam felt instantly cold all over, but also hard as ice. “Who else?”
Cautiously he obeyed, standing awkwardly a couple feet from her chair. “That’s me,” he said. “And you’re Patience’s grandma.”
“What. Are. You.” A tear dropped from one of his own eyes and dribbled down his cheek. Dean ignored it.
Dean drank the last of his tea. He set his mug next to Cas’s on the rocks, then knelt to open the bag. He snorted. There were a couple of empty water bottles and a tube of sunscreen, but it was mostly a jumble of music paraphernalia, snarled cords and at least a couple more ipods. He tucked the one he was holding in with the rest and flipped the cover back over the whole shebang. “Need any help?”
Over breakfast he casually cleared his throat. “I was thinking about the backlog, Bobby. You’re probably right. If you’re okay with it Karen, I’ll keep you company today?”
“Fine,” she said. She leaned back in her chair, propped an arm on the boards, and slung an ankle across her knee. “What do your new musicians have to do with me?”
A couple hours later, entrenched in the book, he thought he heard someone calling. Dean craned his neck to see a short white guy in an old hoodie waving at him from the shore. “Oo-kay,” Dean said to himself, and waved back.
“Just forty dollars a night for a single room cabin,” said Castiel. “Breakfast is included.”
“Heya, Cas.”
“Yeah. Exactly.” Dean shrugged, sitting back. “That’s what everyone wants to read. Those are the stories people want to hear. Like, would Marilyn Monroe be half as popular now if she hadn’t died young? Would people still think Kurt Cobain was a rock god?”
Insubstantial and sticky until washed away
Just like when they were discussing whether or not Dean should take the class, the man was a poor judge of his own abilities. Castiel cursed whatever teachers he’d had in the past who hadn’t nurtured his gifts. How many other adults were walking around these days erroneously thinking they were incapable because of a poor school experience? “If I had to make a guess,” he said, “I’d say you wrote that in one sitting and didn’t look over it again. Am I wrong?”
“Nah,” he shrugged. “I keep meaning to because Led Zeppelin references it a lot. But it’s pretty long.”
Dean ate the pie.
But mostly, Dean was reading and looking at poetry differently because of the way Cas talked about everything surrounding it. The way he painted a picture of the society of the time, in the different countries, the wars and the politics, the madhouses and the rich estates, the poets’ personal struggles and triumphs. And no matter how interesting it was, sometimes Dean heard nothing but the cadence of his voice, saw nothing but the shine of passion in his eyes, and the adorable way his tie sometimes came loose and hung backwards down his chest…Or the gorgeous days when he didn’t wear a tie, and left the top couple buttons of his shirt undone in the warmth of early fall. Dean caught himself dreaming, then. Just a little bit. It was nice, in a way, having something—someone to dream about. Maybe Dean was a little Hot for Teacher, but that was alright, with the whole classroom between them.
Sam parked near the front door and Cas parked with a space left between them. He hopped down from his truck and joined Sam where he was waiting for him. “Welcome to The Roadhouse,” he said, opening the thick wooden door. When Cas stepped in, it took a moment for his eyes to adapt to the dark interior. It seemed the proprietors hadn’t bothered adjusting the lighting to the dimmer day outside, the brightest lights coming from neon beer signs and old lightbulbs beneath green shades that hung over the booths. Opposite from the booths was a long bar, between them some small tables, and the back was a rec area with pool tables and darts. Sam led him to a table closer to the front door and took the seat facing the bar. He swept his wet jacket from his shoulders to hang over the back of his chair, and Cas followed suit. Sam reached back and pulled the tie from his wet hair. He shook it out then ran a hand through it, and to Cas’s bemusement his locks—longer than he’d ever worn it during his touring days—fell perfectly into place, framing his strong jaw and bouncing lightly onto his shoulders. Some people just had
Claire shrugged. Her hair was very long now, just as blonde, a single small braid woven on one side of her head. “We do alright,” she said. An understatement: their last record had gone platinum. She led him deeper into the house, where he could hear music going. Not live music, but a good sound system, certainly. They turned a corner into a wide den with a large black lounge set with deep cushions, where three other girls were sprawled. He’d never met them before, but he recognized them from having kept up with Claire’s career: Alex, Wayward’s bassist; Kaia, whose body language was surprisingly meek and unassuming for someone who went wild behind a drumkit; and the youngest band member, Patience, who was a virtuoso on the guitar.
That gave Castiel pause. He halted and turned on his heel to glared down at Chuck. The prophet glowered down at a bottle of whiskey he was unscrewing. “How long have you been here, Chuck?”
. Still, Dean combed them all carefully for clues on this case or any other potentials.
“Ugh!” she exclaimed, smacking her forehead. “Yes, sorry. Hey,” Charlie said, switching gears like she suddenly got a bright new idea. Knowing her, she probably had. “Let’s go sit at the table!” And she tugged Castiel, trench coat and all, and plopped him down right next to Dean.
“This is a date,” said Cas firmly.
“I. Don’t. Bluff.” He flipped the knife around and brought it down to Dean’s belly.
Cas embraced him then, gently guiding his head into the crook of his neck, where Dean could cry freely.
“Just like riding a bike, hm?” When he looked back up, she was smiling with something like pride.
Songs this chapter:
“Come on, you piece of shit!” Dean tried turning it again until he realized he was using Sam’s housekey. He ripped it out and fumbled with his keyring, trying to shove them in one by one, not even caring, and when none of them were going in quite right he started over,
, and held it like an uncut gem, chiseled it, shaped it, uncovered the hidden facets for all to hear and understand. The bitch of it was that he hadn’t produced the song to oblivion, the way everything on mainstream radio was these days. He’d actually made it better. In one session. What would a song become if he were given a studio and a budget and—
A long knife and pie server were already laid out neatly on a small plate next to the pies. Cas cut himself a generous slice of blueberry, grabbed a fork, and sat down across from Dean. He broke into the tip of the pie with his fork and separated a piece from the main, but…left in on the plate. It didn’t feel right to eat it while Dean was having a tough time. He tried a different tack. “I didn’t see the Impala out front.”
The rest of the drive back to Sam and Eileen’s was quiet. The radio was on, but so low that Dean didn’t register it much beyond his loud thoughts. He felt himself in the eye of a dark storm, so many memories vying for attention that he had to carve himself out a space of blankness just so he wouldn’t crash the car. It was nice, having something to do with his hands. He kept them both on the wheel, though he was usually a more relaxed driver, and conscientiously signaled when appropriate, looked twice before turning or changing lanes. The fine tremor in his fingers was lessened that way, with something important to concentrate on.
Everything was great. He wasn’t sure what he did to deserve it all, but he chalked it up to him being lucky. Jo sure as hell did. Dean had a good life and if he could do it all over again, he wouldn’t change a thing.
“Yeah. I mean,” he stopped to think about that. “I think I did.”
He stopped on Jo’s name and clicked it without thinking through what he might say. It’d been months since they really talked, aside from the odd text message here and there. But, the good thing about Jo was that she wasn’t high maintenance. She didn’t need Dean to call her every week to know that he cared, or was there for her. And Dean felt the same.
“Dean,” Castiel said, but this time his voice was low and quiet like a whisper.
The elementary school got out at four. Twenty minutes after that, Jack’s bus pulled up on the curb. Dean waited out with the rest of the parents to meet him. When Jack got off the bus he practically skipped over to Dean with a bruise on his cheek just below the barely healed eye.
the eye-roll over the phone.
Castiel continued, “You seem to enjoy casual relationships, while I do not. You may very well not be interested in me at all. And above all, I do not think it would be a good idea to even try something like that with the father of my daughter’s classmate. So,” he cleared his throat. “No, Dean. I don’t think it would be a good idea if we were to ‘hang out’ on a regular basis.”
Dean was still just staring. He could only pray that he wasn’t looking like a complete moron.
Dean tried not to think about what the hell was even up with that, and focused more on the fact that he was still pissed about the day before, and how their last… hangout… had ended. Even if Castiel’s ears, and face now, were still inexplicably red.
“Degrade you?” Dean’s face scrunched in confusion. “What the hell are you talking about?”
Jack looked down at his lap and nodded, “Okay. I’m sorry I disappointed you, dad.”
Castiel slowly turned his head to look straight into Dean’s eyes. He narrowed his own and snarled, “Did you instruct your boy to do this?”
“Yeah, I’ll keep my fingers crossed,” Dean smiled, then got up. “Come on, buddy.” He held out a hand and Jack nodded before taking it. “You ladies have a lovely rest of your day.”
Dean squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head, “Slip of the tongue. What do you say? Come by once school’s out.”
“And then I’m gonna beat your ass, Dorkchester,” Claire said with a fist raised.
“That is to be expected. You did call me and request our presence, Mr. Winchester,” Castiel said, sounding less agitated than the last time, but noticeably curt.
“Claire,” Castiel chided. “Let’s go.”
“Sorry, Casanova. Maybe next time,” the man said as he started pulling on his clothes from last night while Dean went to his dresser for boxers and a pair of sweats. He didn’t think it would be right to mention that there would never be a next time.
“Well,” Dean scoffed and motioned toward him with a wave of his hand. “You’re kinda acting like you did.”
“Claire,” Mrs. Karmichael said, drawing everyone’s attention. “Could you explain what came over you during the bathroom break?”
It was while Castiel was working on the third button that they heard the door open and close. There wasn’t much time to do anything about it. The kitchen was in full view of the front door. At the very least, Castiel did jump off the table, but with his half-unbuttoned shirt and ruffled hair, it was pretty hard to act natural. Dean hadn’t even managed to put his shirt back on, but he still attempted to play it cool.
“My what?” Castiel growled.
“Old man,” she repeated defiantly.
“Hey,” Dean said, turning until he was right on top of the semi-stranger and kissing him. He vaguely wondered if he was even up for a round three. Or was it four? He wasn’t necessarily counting the night before.
“Hey, uh, you got a minute?” Dean said, staring down at his cup of coffee.
Another slow thrust helped him push that thought out of his head. He leaned down and kissed the guy again, feeling him up with his hands while he worked his hips.  But then, the doorbell rang again. Whoever was there had started vigorously pressing the doorbell button, and Dean was truly pissed now.
“Yeah, about that,” Dean lifted a hand to rub over his stubble. “You wanna explain this recent attack from your little princess?”
Claire paused to give Jack a small wave and Jack happily returned the gesture. And just like that, they walked out and were gone.
By twenty-one, Bobby gave him a piece of the company and made him the manager while he retired to his home. Insurance from his parent’s deaths gave them a head start, and when Sam turned seventeen he was ready for pre-law, tuition and all. Sam was a freshman when he received that odd call from Dean. And maybe it was because Dean’s life was, in a way, on track. Maybe it was because he was finally financially stable enough to stop living paycheck to paycheck. Or maybe he’d gotten more lonely than he’d ever admit with Sam off to school doing great things. Hell if Dean knew the real answer, but four months after that call he was driving home with a six-month-old baby strapped in the back seat of his impala.
“Yes?” he said, then looked around Dean to see the two guests standing behind him. “Hi, Novak,” he said pleasantly. “Is that your dad?”
“Okay. I’ll be there shortly.” And then he hung up.
Dean was chuckling when he looked up at Castiel, but froze at the sheer shock that took over Castiel’s expression. “You’re…?” Castiel started to say, but seemed to stop himself short.
“Right, because you wanna know how Jess salts her ice cream now, or all the lamaze classes?” Dean could really
“I’m gonna take that as a compliment,” Dean said decidedly.
And then they were just staring. Right about now would be a great time to lean in. They were so close, it would only take a second or so to close the distance. And, oh God, he hadn’t realized how much he wanted to until this very second. Here, staring at those insanely blue eyes and a second later when they darted down to Dean’s lips.
“It’s true! I’m
Three days after that, it was Friday. Jack had come home in a good mood and was reading in the living room. Dean sat with a beer and a leg propped on his coffee table watching the news. An odd thing he did that reminded him that he was only thirty going on thirty-one, and yet acted like he was in his fifties at times. But aside from porn and cartoons, he liked watching the news.
“You’re telling me you don’t know what types of shows she likes?” Dean asked, and it wasn’t meant to be judgmental, but he silently reprimanded himself anyway.
Dean rolled his eyes, but continued to focus on his son. “Yeah but, I thought Novak was a boy.”
With Jack and Claire off to college, Castiel was there to keep him company so that he could abstain from flying out to Michigan University to stalk his children and make sure they were okay.
“Great!” Dean stopped there for a second, noting that he sounded way too excited for a kid’s play date. He cleared his throat and said a bit more cooly, “I mean, yeah. Awesome. Sounds good. How about Saturday? My place?”
“Wait. So, the guy thinks you’re attractive?” Sam asked, voice raising along with his confusion. “I don’t get it.”
The anchor was going on about some car accident when he heard his doorbell ring. He wondered for a moment if it was Sam, visiting from his busy life as a lawyer. But his wife, Jessica, was seven months along, so that visit didn’t seem right. It could’ve been Bobby, taking time off from binge drinking in his cozy life of retirement, but he usually called with his grunts and griping before a visit. Despite the logic behind it, he assumed the latter was more plausible, so when he got up and answered the door he’d already started speaking, “Bobby! You old bastard. Nice of you to come vis—”
Dean smiled as he thought about Jack and Claire running around playing soccer. He snorted out a soft laugh and said, “Yeah, actually. It did.”
“Yeah, it’s me. Look, we got off on the wrong foot. You just kinda took me by surprise. But, uh, why don’t you bring your little hell spawn over and we give you that apology you wanted.”
Dean, for his part, was just staring with his mouth hanging open by an inch.
For a while, they were just trying to catch their breath. Minutes later it was Castiel who broke their silence when he started chuckling.
“What did you want to say that couldn’t be said over the phone?” Castiel said and Dean felt the pressure of an uncomfortably enormous bundle of nerves building in his gut.
“That, uh, well. That I don’t just sleep with guys I don’t care about.” It wasn’t exactly what he wanted to say, but it was a start, he supposed. Might as well keep the ball rolling. “It’s not like I’ve never had a relationship. Or that I wouldn’t be interested in one.”
“But he didn’t say that,” Dean said, sounding dumbfounded.
Castiel cleared his throat and looked toward Jack with a sliver of concern crossing his usually passive expression as he said, “Perhaps Claire owes you an apology in return.”
Dean felt his lips tugging up into a smile and he tried and failed to fight it off. “Awesome,” he whispered and Castiel’s smile grew wider.
“All I need,” he assured her, watching Jack as he babbled at Sam how cool the car is.
“Hey,” said Billie, softly this time. She came up to him and cupped his elbows. She waited until he met her eyes. “Charlie’s got everyone on the look out.”
“With me?” he asked excitedly.
Castiel’s face fell, visibly fell, and Dean’s breath caught. But he covered it quickly with his “I am here for you” professor face. “You won’t be handing in a final paper?”
The professor blinked, then a wide smile spread across his face. “Yes, I’d love to! Sit, please. We’ve got a bit of time before class.”
Cas shook his head.
Dean clicked his tongue. “Sorry to hear that. They’re good people.”
So they decided since Dean was lending Sam his car for the weekend, that Saturday morning they’d drive out to the yard. Whatever he’d been expecting Sam to roll up in, it was not a large black boat of a car. “This is Dean’s car?” he asked, sliding onto the leather seat.
“Yes,” said Cas. “I do.” He shrugged his shoulders, and thunder cracked again. The lens turned in the lighthouse, lightning flickered to life, and stretched behind them over the lake, from one end of the horizon to the other it seemed, seventy some stories tall, were two identical shadows: wings. Giant, huge, spread-wide fuck-off wings. Both lighthouse and lightning caused the shadows to pulse, darkening and fading over the background of clouds and churning water.
The sirens grew louder. Some people tried venturing the from the house, but Jody shouted at the to get back inside. An ambulance was first to turn through the gates of Singer Salvage, then a trail of police cars not long after. “Jody said she knows this place pretty well,” said Vic as they watched them enter. “Got some guys from the sheriff’s department running the perimeter of the property with their trucks. Even if they try to jump the fence, they won’t get far.” He chuckled to himself as he walked away, off to greet some of the officers when they got out of their cars.
Of a sudden Dean was overcome by a wave of immense gratitude for Charlie. They barely knew each other, but her empathy and kindness about this little thing, that from the outside must look so trivial—it gave him the final push he needed not having to go it alone. He swallowed the swell of emotion. “O-okay.”
. He ripped it out and slapped it on the wall with some tape.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean and Sam had spent a good portion of their childhoods hanging out here whenever their parents were working and unable to watch them. Once Dean was in high school, it was a cheap place to hang out that didn’t consider them hooligans (they knew better than to cross Ellen). After they’d all graduated (or dropped out, in Dean’s case), they’d kept up the habit because, well, it was still cheap, they were busy and it was an excuse to see each other, but also…they loved it. They had their own lane, the one farthest from the front door so there’s less traffic to bother them. You can’t
Looked like someone was awake after all.
Cas was shoving his papers back into his bag, but he took a moment to look up and smile at Dean in response before securing it closed. "Is she yours?" he asked. When he saw Dean's confusion, he nodded his head toward the Impala. "The car?"
“Um, what?”
The bar was already busy, so Cas watched with interest as Ellen and Jesse slung burgers and Dean stayed busy at the stove, while Jo and Billie were in and out with trays and orders. So it was with some surprise that Cas noticed, while staring at Dean’s shoulders while he was stirring something at the stove, that this corner of the kitchen was very warm, and soft, and spicy, and…
“I night drive all the time.”
Dean crossed his arms and stared at the floor, thinking. He didn’t like that this guy just happened to show up in Bumfuck, SD out of coincidence. He didn’t like that it’s put some idea in Sammy’s head that writing music that makes just the two of them happy isn’t quite enough. And he really didn’t like that having the guy’s blue eyes on him for the whole show with some kind of insane laser focus had, at the time, made him think there was something there other than professional interest. But whatever. He looked up. “You actually trust this guy?”
“You need determination, imagination, the willingness to spend years honing your craft.”
Dean glanced up at her family’s table to find Tess watching avidly. He nodded so she knew he got the message; she smiled back. Then he grinned down at the little girl in front of him. “You’re welcome. Seagulls are pretty awesome, huh?”
. He shoved his socks in his pocket and slipped his boots on, not bothering to tie them. “See ya around,” said Dean.
“Months? For a dumb poem?”
. Pretty sure I've read
“It would make you even hotter.” Holy crap. “No! I just mean—” Dean hoped it was dark enough to hide his blush, despite the streetlamp. He was a second away from tossing himself over the bluff as it was. “Like, you’d be hotter, like your bike is hotter, ‘cause it looks like it’s in space, and in space blue is the hottest color, and all those other assholes have red and orange and stuff which is cold. Not that, not that you’re not hot, I mean obviously that was the joke, but I wasn’t like, coming onto you, oh god.” Dean facepalmed, because his dignity was already a distant memory.
“Dean, Dean, Dean,” said Alastair. He grinned wolfishly, the sort of thing that used to get Dean excited for trouble afoot. But now that he knew what kind of trouble that meant, it made him sick.
It was no doubt that what Dean was feeling was fear, or something like it. All his life was a string of fear punctuated by moments of fleeting bliss: a hug from Sam, a smile from his dad, a forkful of freshmade pie. What was so frustrating was that this shouldn’t scare him, right? It’s just that Castiel felt so steady and solid pressed against Dean, giving the impression that Dean could fall, just a little, and still be caught. That he was happy to let Dean take the lead but could easily take it back any moment. That, given how he’d told his stories, he was the least likely person to ever judge him for wanting something he’d never let himself have.
fearing the chronic angers of that house,
Lightning flashed—
Somehow, his definition of too close got narrower and narrower. Soon he was foolishly agreeing to small hikes in the mountains, which Dean wasn’t that fond of, except he might have, maybe, been fond of seeing Cas in shorts. And sitting alone with him on lookouts over the picturesque New England landscape. And teasing him about his homemade trail mix.
had really gotten Dean into poetry, but that was a common one to talk about, right? He should pick something no one else is going to pick. There was “Death Be Not Proud,” the one he riffed off of when actually writing his first poem, but he sure as hell wasn’t going to tell a room of twenty-year-olds and some hotshot professor that he sometimes suffered from delusions of being a writer.
The two glared at each other. This was the moment.
But John Winchester didn’t even need to be in an adjacent state to effortlessly breathe down his son’s neck. There was still too much to do before he could relax, and it almost took less energy if he didn’t think about it too hard. He dropped his bags on the small kitchen table and dug out his salt supply and started by lining the door, whose lock he double checked. Then the window in that same wall above the table, and the smaller one above the sink in the kitchenette. A twinge of guilt delayed his hand before pouring it out in a long line on the low sills of the large back windows.
At that Dean sat up so he could see Cas’s face. He looked so damn sad. “But you do help people, Cas. They love it here.” He swallowed. “I love it here.”
“Yeah, Cas,” said Dean. “Do it.” He lifted his hips and Cas peeled his boxers away.
until he breached, coughing violently, gasping for air.
“Cooking for him, reading to him, changing him, bathing him, listening to his stories…everything I do for him, it was never Dad that did that. It was you.”
The band’s noise petered off. “Any requests?” Billie asked into her mic. The tone seemed rhetorical—aside from Ellen and the man in the hat, no one else was there to answer—but there was empty air, and Sam took it.
Dean shook. “So what are you?”
He stood and went to the kitchen sink, taking his empty plate and half-full glass of wine, and poured the rest of it down the drain. Castiel was well below his limit for a safe walk home, but he’d had enough of indulging in dangerous thoughts. For the next few months it was imperative that he treat Dean like any other student. His duty as a professor demanded it.
James turned to look down at him, eyebrows rising above his sunglasses.

“I, I can get it,” Dean managed. “I live here. I mean—”
“No one!”
Rufus settled down in the chair next to Dean, and Bobby in the one next to that, both with beers in their hands. “It’s a Jewish prayer praising God,” said Rufus. “Though in that case,” he nodded toward the book, “it’s specifically about praying in mourning.”
Dean sat there stunned while the discussion devolved into debate about what constitutes real literature, and whether poets should be concerned about writing “pop poetry” as opposed to “real poetry” that referenced “real literature.” He wished Charlie were here so she could be suitably outraged. And then remembered that he hadn’t told her about trying out the class, because he was too chickenshit. Stupid.
Castiel didn’t understand but worse than that there was no
“Well,” said Bobby, “what do you need it for?”
Dean thought about how, for a dozen years now, Dr. Moseley had taught at some fancy little liberal arts college just an hour away from them.
“Peachy,” he said. “You?”
“Come ON, Dean!” shouted Sam, putting his pillow over his head. “Asia? Fucking Asia? Really?”
“Well,” said Dean, “you do know it’s just covers, right? Sam ain’t even here.”
“But it gave him something to write about.”
He searched his eyes, blue and wide and utterly sincere. Dean licked his lips and nodded. Cas undid the first two buttons on his coat, revealing hints of a soft sweater, and reached a gloved hand into an inner pocket. He drew out a small rectangular gift, wrapped in sparkling black paper and one of those silver bows that were really more tinsel shaped into a glittery fountain. Also taped to the front was a small silver card that read
“It’s below freezing, Dean.”
It was perfect.”
“Jonathan Lethem.”
“No.”
“Yeah.” Sam fell quiet, but again, Dean was determined not to break the silence. He wanted to yell, he wanted to cry, he wanted to beg. His free hand twisted in the sheets; he wanted Cas here, next to him, holding his hand, as he tried to give Sam his space, tried not to demand a reply when he’d never wanted anything more. Yet again, he was rewarded. “If I tell you something,” his brother asked slowly, “do you promise not to tell Dad?”
Dean just shrugged and plopped the box in Cas’s lap. “There’s a long drive ahead of us. We’ve got time.” He tugged the angel closer by the trenchcoat and gave him a kiss. A firm one at first, then a few softer ones until the last of his fear faded away. “It’s your turn,” he said, shaking the box so all the cassettes rattled. “Pick an album, Cas.”
He loaded the last of her crates into the trunk of her car parked behind the stand as she buckled her kid into his seat. With a quick hug and kiss to Cas's damp cheek Nora was off, along with most of his other neighbors. He realized in that moment, rain running down his neck and inside his jacket, that with Cain in the hospital after Colette took a turn for the worse the night before, it was actually going to take a lot longer to dismantle his stand and get everything loaded into his pickup.
Instead of pestering him, though, Charlie dug through her threadbare satchel for her school-issued copy. “I haven’t started it yet because I’ve read some things people have said about Kerouac…but if your mom loved it, must be worth reading, right? Since we’re both behind, want to keep track and help each other catch up?”
“Why?” asked Dean quietly. “What’s the point?”
In the first second he understood: I’m about to die. Either from impact, or from drowning—the lake does not give up her dead.
“Did they what?”
His forefinger curled in toward his thumb, which he brought level with Dean’s face. Then he flicked.
“Oh, would you now?” challenged Victor.
“Speak for yourself,” snapped Josephine. Definitely one of the ones getting her credits out of the way early, then.
“Uh, one more thing,” said Dean, rubbing the back of his neck with his free hand. “I got my GED.”
“Thought my vocab quiz days were behind me,” Dean muttered, scanning the first page. Apparently anaphora was the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of lines or stanzas. A little unnecessary to have a separate word for a specific kind of repetition, if you asked him.
banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.
At every step you missed
,” was the prompt reply.
“Another one?” Castiel was watching her instead of the coffee, so that the cup began to overflow onto the saucer.
“What do you want?” said Claire, though it wasn’t quite as biting as it could have been.
Sure enough, “Hello, Castiel!” Missouri called from the back of the house.
“Do you think I’m bluffing?” Alastair hissed.
he seemed to say.
A long pause followed, in which Dean was too chickenshit to face him. Just when he was about to bring up another subject, though, Cas answered. “Yes,” he said.
“Who is it?” he asked.
“True,” said Cas, running a hand through his hair. It stuck up in a delightfully tousled look. “But all those reasons you’re wary of me?”
like never before, too. Partially this was because Cas liked to neatly split the elements of a poem into separate categories which he made them recite whenever they took a deep dive into a particular piece: typographical, sonic, sensory, ideational, and—putting them all together—fusional. It was also because of Cas’s insistence that poetry
The band crashed into the chorus, and Cas was transported by the earnest feeling. It was a love song, but not for him, he knew. It was for Hans Zimmer, and the farm, and for letting music rearrange your world. Not only had Dean understood what Cas had been trying to show him, but Sam had been right all along.
“You’ll be happy here, won’t you, Dean? We’d really like the help to cut down on daycare costs, but if you don’t want to—?”
“Dean!” the Rider called over his shoulder. Dean blinked a few times, and looked up from the bike into the opaque shine of his helmet. That was all of his usual gear that he was wearing, actually, in jeans and not leathers, but he had no time to wonder. “Dean, get everyone in the house!” But Dean just stared back helplessly. Who
“At least take some time to think about it. Please?” Sam’s eyes grew three damn sizes. Damn puppy look. Little bastard had that figured out from a very young age.
“No,” said Sam gleefully. “School for
ready.” He saw Naomi stiffen in the corner of his eye, but poured all of his energy into keeping a straight face. He stepped around the lectern, unbuttoning his blazer and pulling the glasses from an inner pocket. Then he shrugged it off, revealing the short sleeves of his graph paper shirt, and of course the pocket protector where he’d gleefully placed some pens. To complete the look, he popped the glasses on his nose and spread his arms. “Now I’m ready.”
“I’m—I’m a writer!” said the guy excitedly, pointing at himself with both hands. Great.
“So,” Cas started, sitting down behind his desk. “Missouri tells me that you’re an old student of hers. She speaks very highly of you.”
“No, of course,” he reached out a hand, but dropped it when Dean flinched. “I meant—they were sending you to hell. But you’re not marked for hell, Dean, why would they do that? Did they say? Was it—was it because of me? I’ve been with others before and no one ever—”
“Ah, but it’s above zero.”
“Wait here,” Chuck said.
When he was done he zipped up his duffel, slung it over his shoulder, and tossed the newspapers in the recycle bin. Outside the family was still horsing around in the pool while grandma was reading under an umbrella on the far side. Dean smiled to himself and kept walking past the ache that was building in his chest.
Then another feeling surged in his chest, small but bright. The small seed that grew every time his scores rose on his practice tests. The thing that blossomed when he’d taken a chance on the Rider, and was rewarded a hundredfold. The one that pulsed
“Very well,” said Cas, with phony magnanimity. “I won’t look at your condoms.”
Dean laughed; couldn’t help it. “Shut the fuck up, dude.” Then Cas started laughing too, and they set each other off the rest of the way out of Paradise Cove and onto the highway.
Sam swallowed and took a big breath. “I hate Dad,” he spat. “He neglected us and abused us and he sucked the life out of you like a goddam vampire. But I love him. Because he did love me, and he loved Eileen, and he gave us the Singers, who gave us the Turners, and Charlie, and Missouri. But mostly I love him because he gave me the best big brother I could ever fucking ask for. A toast,” he said, voice regaining its strength.
An answering grin grew on Claire’s face, some of that gleeful little girl peeking through her rough-and-tumble façade. “Niiice,” she teased him. Then she put an arm around Kaia, giving her a kiss on the cheek. When Claire saw him watching out of the corner of her eye, she winked, and Cas knew. Wayward would help them.
When he burst outside, his fears were realized. Sam and Jake and the Banes twins were going at in the parking lot with Hellraisers, and losing. Lily and Ava looked torn at what to do, but Dean didn’t hesitate. He grabbed the nearest leather vest and
“Hm, now he is an interesting one,” she said. “Most of what I get from him, even after all this time, is…colors.”
“Hello,” said Patience curiously, though the other two gave him wary, calculating looks.
Cas raised an eyebrow but bent his head back to work. Reluctantly Dean flipped through his pages to find the answer key and go through the practice set. He was disappointed, but not surprised to find that he’d gotten three right out of ten.
There was just no time. Castiel got right in the little man’s face, curling both fists in his shirt and hauling him up off the couch. “What have you seen?” he growled. “Have you had visions?”
talked to us about that. And he had that soccer trophy I’d won in sixth grade. It was weird that you put it there, but—”
Missouri sucked in a breath and shot out her hand to hold his, squeezing as he worked through the memories. It was strange; usually this sort of thing would be stalking his nightmares but it’s almost like he forgot about it until reminded, then it came rushing in. One swift push.
“Are you…” Sam sighed. “Are you having a bad trip, Dean?”
“Your homework for tonight,” Cas said, switching gears, “besides the syllabus, is to pick a poem that means something to you. And I mean specifically
“Oh,” said Castiel. “Generator, yes. Would you like me to accompany you back to your cabin and see what I can do to help?”
Dean snatched his hand away and took a step back. “Who are you?”
Then again, who was he trying to impress? Was his dad going to come out of a drunken stupor halfway across the country and know that Dean was pussying out? If nothing else, Dean had to protect Baby, right? That deer was like a warning shot across the bow—if Dean wrapped the Impala around a tree, John Winchester would kill him. Then salt and burn his body to make damn sure his sorry spirit didn’t stick around.
When Alastair saw it his face lit up in triumph. He stood, legs still either side of his bike, and pressed his advantage. “No one else has to die, Dean. Just say yes.”
“What do you know?” Castiel asked.
That Tuesday, Dean pulled up to the little cabin on the far edge of the Mullens’ property to find Cas kneeling in his garden. The blooms were plentiful, and the tomatoes were crawling up the poles he’d set there for the purpose. Cas didn’t turn to acknowledge him, though, and when Dean got out of the car he saw why: Cas was wearing his headphones again, those expensive white ones, which stood out starkly against his dark hair.
Dean did not email Dr. Novak, Cas of the high cheekbones and deep, sexy voice. He did go to the registrar, however, and pay to audit the class. Kid behind the desk could only have been nineteen at most, but she didn’t bat an eyelash. “Townie?” she asked.
His clothes had barely begun their cycle in the dryers when he heard talking and the unmistakable flap of people walking in sandals. The family from breakfast the day before was coming to use the pool. Patience was more hopping than walking, excited and already wearing orange floaties on her arms. Her mom already had her swimsuit on too with a pair of shorts over it, and her dad was wearing trunks with an old t-shirt and a pair of goggles perched on his bald head. Grandma was wearing a purple summer dress today. All the adults were carrying beach bags, looking well prepared for whatever a five-or-so-year-old might throw at them. They gave Dean smiles and nods, which he returned.
Cas played devil’s advocate. “Between youtube and spotify and the rest of the internet, you can still find that sort of thing. You might have to dig for it,” he allowed.
God, that was it. That was
Every muscle, every bone and sinew in Dean’s body pulled tight at the words. But he had practice with the Hellraisers. He kept his face smooth, his voice light. “You don’t know that.”
“Everyone’s seen Shrek,” he retorted. “But not quite. Shapes, the way most people think of them, are just lines a page, right?” He shoveled more cobbler into his mouth before pushing his plate aside, shuffling through his piles for a clean graph paper. He positioned a pencil so that it was touching somewhere near the middle. “A dot has no dimensions. A line, one dimension.” He drew a line across a few boxes. “Add more lines to get a two-dimensional shape.” His pencil went up, over, and down again. “Now, you may look at a nerd and see nothing but this square.”
Dean knuckled the bridge between his eyes, trying to stave off a headache. “You and Jess both? That’s good.”
“Ah.” Cas pinned him with the full weight of his attention, which was considerable. “And why do you like it?”
“I understand,” said Cas, and he did. Some artists fell into obscurity because they fell out of love with the life. Others because they fell into rehab, like Sam. And then there were the unlucky ones. There were just as many people adjacent to the industry that suffered the same fate.
Dean huffed half chuckle and looked down. “Yeah. Had to learn to make ‘em myself, after that.”
“But this guy?” Kevin waved the packet around. “The bio Novak wrote up about him? Born in Japan but immigrated to America. Was a huge influence not only by publishing his own poetry, but by discussing Japanese literary aesthetics with Brits, and other Americans. Like Imagism might never have happened without him. He’s the first really important Asian American poet and I was in advanced placement! I spent two years at Harvard! And have I ever heard of him before? No.” He angrily dropped the poems on top of his bag and thumped back into a sprawl on the chair, but a couple tears escaped again. With a jerky movement he wiped them away and crossed his arms.
“Yeah, yeah,” he said. “Now be quiet. I’m reading.”
Dean slumped against the nearest car. Sam and Jakes friends ran up to talk to them, and why did they sound so excited? Did they have any idea what had almost happened?
“Petty? No no no.
“Please, Klara. I need to know.”
,” Cas rumbled, more wrecked than he’d sounded the whole time. Still in the throes of orgasm, Dean let himself be pushed onto his back while Cas kissed his slack mouth fiercely, finishing himself off. With a final shudder Cas lifted away and collapsed on his back, the mattress bouncing a little underneath them.
“What she said,” Charlie nodded.
Cas snapped his fingers. “Staind. ‘Mudshovel’.”
Without missing a beat, Sam pushed a stack of napkins toward him. Ah yes, Dean remembered those days. With kids you always had to be prepared.
, said a voice in his head, mischievous and gleeful with Schadenfreude: a perfect imitation of Gabriel. He finished off his wine to flush it out.
Dean growled and gave him a quick, hard kiss. “Shut up.” He untangled himself from his headphones and slipped out of bed, careful to hide his own smile. The temperature had dropped enough that he wanted his clothes, now. By the time he’d tugged on his pants and found his shirt discarded in the hallway, Cas was in and out of the bathroom.
At that Missouri chuckled, the mood lightening considerably. She withdrew her hand and gave the back of his a parting pat. “You keep telling yourself that, Dean. I can see Castiel swirling around in that thick skull of yours.” She resettled in her chair and grabbed her book and sunglasses, signaling the end of the conversation.
The class tittered, most in agreement, only a couple people quiet, bored out of their minds. He swallowed and looked down at his book, his mother’s well worn copy, and wondered if it was a lie, if he’d just misunderstood, or even if he’d completely misremembered his own mother.
The sun didn’t set ‘til closer to nine o’clock these days, so the evening sun still cast a warm light on the big, sandy brick school behind him. He rocked up on his toes and tried not to fidget too much with his hair; he’d styled it a little bit more than usual. Instead he smoothed down his black button-up shirt, though he’d already ironed it before he’d left to Sam’s relentless teasing. He still wore jeans, of course. Dean didn’t want to dress too formally, because it was a high school musical, for one, and for another he was half-expecting his Rider to show up in full leathers anyway. If he even came.
If he stayed, he’d have to deal with…things.
The cabin felt cold and empty in comparison, the bed uninviting, the fireplace a gaping black maw. Every time the lightning flashed white in the blue-black darkness shadows danced in grotesque shapes along the walls.
Dean turned his head to stare him down, eyes making subtle movements like he was searching for something. “What about your family? Why didn’t you go home for break? Aren’t they missing you?”
Dean snorted; Castiel looked back up. Dean had a sour smile on his face. “’Cause they’re, I don’t know. Happy.”
When Sam rolled in with Jack in tow, he let himself be distracted. His brother went to change out of his monkey suit while Jack told him about his whole day, then demanded that Dean read from the Star Wars Little Golden Books he’d bought him for last Christmas. When Sam came downstairs in old jeans and worn flannel (and a soft smile at the sight of his older brother reading to his son, which Dean pretended not to see), he started on dinner. Still, Dean said nothing.
“Who?”
Shit, that sounded good. Dean officially no longer cared about extra cost.
a big deal, Dean!” Sam burst out. “He crossed the line long before he ever hit you. He crossed the line when he left us alone so long we had to steal to eat. Though I wish I’d stolen a lot more because he
“May I?” asked Cas, the cool rush of his breath skating around Dean’s bellybutton.
He sat up and cleared his throat, telegraphing his readiness. Cas positioned himself by his laptop, ready to scroll the text down on the overhead. Studiously ignoring everyone else in the room, he plunged headfirst into a poem he hadn’t read in a long, long time.
The conversation on their side of the table soon devolved into a series of pop culture references he couldn’t always understand. “Who hasn’t heard of Caddyshack?!” Dean exclaimed. “I’m done with your whole generation.”
“Thank you for the song.”
He swung his leg over the bike and settled in the seat. It was worn down and a bit uncomfortable, but the tank was full enough to get him started, so it would do. He put the keys in the ignition; the engine only took a little coaxing to roar back to life. With the ease of experience he steered her through the Pit toward the open garage door. He barely breathed as he rolled out onto the road, certain that Al would come careening around the corner any moment on his chopper of the week. But by some miracle, the neighborhood remained empty of traffic and he slipped seamlessly into the bustle of a Milwaukee rush hour. Dean’s apartment wasn’t near the Pit, exactly, but still too close for Dean’s liking. Fear lent him speed as he threw the bike into park and ran into the building.
“No, I don’t need to make breakfast yet. I was wondering…will you show me again? The lighthouse?”
Castiel watched a series of expressions tug Dean’s face, worried he’d somehow made whatever turmoil his student was experiencing worse. At last Dean laughed, a quiet, broken thing, and pinched the bridge of his nose. He took another breath and looked at Cas. “Jack Allen is your favorite poet?”
that I should really be taking classes for so someone can stay on top of it, and like, I want to expand our restorations but no one wants to entrust their classic cars to someone without credentials and fuck if I can get credentials without taking classes but I can’t take classes without even a GED and that’s what I’ve been studying, okay, I need my GED but I keep failing the practice tests over and over and all my friends are getting careers and building their adult lives and I’m just stuck here and I can’t even” —he clutched at his necklace— “How can I, how can my family even want me around when I can’t even do what they need?”
“Me too. A play, actually. Karen lent it to me. We were reading together at the hospital.”
Cas smiled, crows’ feet deepening around his eyes. Clearly didn’t feel an ounce of shame, the heathen. “Well mine is a gentleman, and his name suits him.”
Another flash of lightning glinted off of something just to the right, almost hidden in the corner made between the stone fireplace and wooden wall. It was an old black and white photograph in an unassuming frame. A wide shot of the Paradise Cove Lodge. The woods seemed very close in the picture, or maybe the building was smaller. More interesting was the figure standing just in front of it. There was a young woman in a long skirt and neat jacket buttoned over a blouse, all in light colors stark against the backdrop of the dark wooden building. A small cap was tilted artfully on her upswept hair. Her face sat in stony, solemn lines, her eyes large and piercing. Something about her seemed familiar, though he couldn’t quite say what. There was no title or label to the photo for the curious, only a small metal plate screwed into the bottom edge of the frame, on which was etched “1901.” Another spike of lightning lit up the room, streaking white across her eyes. The resultant crack of thunder was so close it made everything shake.
Wide, she wasn’t too far off
Saturday morning, Castiel stopped at the garage office only long enough to let the Singers know he was on the property before he was gone again, Karen’s cheery “Good luck!” and Bobby’s grumbly “Don’t be an idjit!” barely escaping out the door behind him. They’d already made him promise not to take his bike off the property until they were sure he’d gotten the hang of it, but Cas didn’t mind. The scrapyard had loomed vast and intimidating at first, though the longer Castiel hung out there the more he understood the ways in which everything got shifted around, why some cars did or didn’t get compacted, all the open space that shifted around within it. Nothing much moves over the winter, so he knew just where there was enough open field for Castiel to have some fun.
“Mmm,” said Cas. “Mulled wine.”
of them?
Dean hid his blush by keeping his eyes on the ipod, and shook his head. He kept scrolling up and down, but he didn’t really have a hankering for anything, and the thought of taking the energy to listen to something new was suddenly exhausting.
Which is why, when he walked in to a very busy Harvelle Bowl Dean almost missed his friends entirely. He was already intent on dodging strangers in the darkness, amid the blasting classic rock and the vibrant glowing stars when a whole mess of people yelled, “DEAN,”—and not just his friends. He whirled around to find Victor, Charlie, and Billie holding down the first lane, and at the scoring station that they shared with the second lane were Donna, Jody, and the Singers. He opened his arms as he backtracked. “What gives?”
“What, he can quote half an Eastern religion but he’s not quoting Tennyson?”
Nothing compares to you…”
Dean was startled into a laugh. “Never thought I’d need to know that bullshit again.”
“Well it’s very good,” said Cas. “Tall, please.”
Sam seemed to note his line of thought. “You might have heard of his old band, though they never got signed. The Vampirates?”
Dean looked up in surprise. They did such a good job of minding their own business, rarely talking more than it took to exchange food and complain about homework, that Dean hadn’t really expected to be noticed. Now her light eyes were bright with interest in her thin face, and no hint of ridicule. He couldn’t bring himself to brush her off.
“This,” said Dean, twirling a finger to indicate the room, “is your job. How about something not math-related?”
“As you may remember, Ms. Milton told you all that I’ll be taking the lead on most lessons for the rest of the year. I’ve been working hard and I think I’m ready. Or,” he held up a finger, “
Everyone in the parking lot whipped their heads around to look. Five motorcycles were speeding down the road and careening into the parking lot. Ugly-ass choppers with ape hangers and garish fire paint jobs.
Like a Dust Bowl carnival pitched by deadbeat dads,
Over the next two days, Dean angsted over what poem to pick. Sure,
“Uh, Imagism?”
He sprinted across the bowling alley, shoving people aside as he went. His friends were yelling behind him, but there was no time, no time. His past had come home to roost and Sam was about to pay the price.
Dean could barely pay attention to the lesson, still reeling from what Castiel had revealed. Jack Allen was Cas’s favorite poet? Was it true? Had Missouri known?
“In that case,” said Cas.
Cas finally dropped his gaze and sighed. “No, not really. I think I’ve been working from my parents’ projection of me for too long.” Then he smiled to himself, like a ray of sun through a raincloud. “But I’m finding new angles.”
“And now maybe,” the man continued, “some would say your life was sad. But you lived it anyway.”
“Like all these records!” Dean jumped up from the couch, grabbing a piece of Castiel’s sweater along the way, tugging him up and over to the shelves. “Some of these are really old. Your great grams started this collection then, huh? Or maybe one of her kids.”
, he was going to take a goddamn crowbar to this car and it was going to feel absolutely
“How is it?”
A bright flare for a single second, sharpening the shape into focus—
Dean didn’t know what to say to that. His silence at last prompted Kevin to open his eyes again. He sat up in the chair to snatch the packet back. He read the page again himself, shaking his head.
“I’m several years your senior, Mr. Winchester, but yes, I was scouting in the nineties, as a teenager. The label was my family, in a way.”
“Good. And?”
“Congratulations.”
“I know it, Dean,” Cas said, his eyes crinkling in an amused little smile. “It’s my job to know it.”
, and never heard a damn word of thanks for it, and I should have said sayonara and see you later when he needed me the most?”
Bobby chuckled. “He’s a pretty famous poet, Dean.”
She looked up from her computer screen. “He’ll be fine, Castiel. He isn’t giving you trouble in class, is he?”
“Are you living the life
Cain’s entire body shifted, limbs pulling straight and turning him into a steel wall. “None of your business,” he said. His blue eyes were chips of ice.
Cas paused there, clearly waiting for him to fill in the gaps. Dean was hardly going to tell him that his last collection had been shortlisted for the National Book Award. Or rather, that he was Jack Allen, and Jack Allen had been shortlisted. Then again, he had no idea how Jack Allen played in academic circles. Could be considered a hack, for all he knew. Dean simply raised his eyebrows, dared the professor to finish his thought.
Dean’s head snapped up. Castiel had turned on the projector, and one of Dean’s poems was on the screen. No. God, no. Could this get any worse?
of drumsticks tapping a snare, the deep
good enough?
Bobby rolled his eyes. “Go inside and ask Karen if she needs help making lunch.”
Klara wiped the edge of her mouth with her thumb. A trace amount of lipstick remained on the digit, and she rubbed it away. “Your only question was where, and so I answered you. The safest place I could think of. I was still devout then.”
After getting home and having a quick lunch, they walked a couple of blocks down to the park so Dean could sit for a bit and Jack could run around to his heart’s content. There were a few other young kids there; Dean recognized a couple of them now that he’d been watching Jack for awhile. But of course Jack ran up to one of the new kids first. Dean smirked and pulled out his phone, opening the group text he had going with Sam and Eileen.
“Yeah, I
“And how,” said Dean.
“You got that one, nice!”
“When you rolled into town a few months ago, when I saw you at the farmer’s market the first time?” Sam chuckled, self-deprecating. “I thought it was a sign. Like some kind of miracle. I would never have thought of you in a million years, wouldn’t know how to reach you even if I had, but there you were: a neutral party with the right talents and contacts.”
I said nothing can take away these blues
to be good for each other. So maybe that helped. But, uh, when you knew it was close to the end and you called me in, and I walked into that hospital I had all of these things I wanted to say to him. All of these really well thought out, lawyerly answers to any argument or accusation he’d ever laid against me. I wanted to rip him a new one for all the things I’d found out from your poetry, too.”
If Castiel trusted Sam even a little less, he would have jumped out of the car once Singer Salvage and Auto Repair rose into view. It was far enough outside of town that there was nothing but grass and sky all around it. The property itself was partially fenced in with chainlink and barbed wire, and the drive they pulled into was flanked by an open gate with a visible padlock and chain hanging from one end. The interior proved to be a large yard with grass on one side and dirt on the other; normal-looking cars were parked neatly to one side, while the asphalt drive became gravel and wound through the grass to various buildings, one of which was a garage with a few doors, another of which was a nice two-story house painted blue and trimmed in white.
“Good.” Cas held out his hand, and Dean shook it bemusedly. “You’ll find my email address on the syllabus. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. Otherwise I’ll see you again in two weeks.”
The third time I saw you I thought that I could—”
“Come on, close up shop for a few hours, it’ll be fine.”
“Right, can you even understand it, though?”
“What happened?” Dean asked quietly.
Of course he didn’t have to buy a car, but his brain kept circling back to cars because it kept circling back to Dean. He’d had no idea what was in store for him a couple weeks ago when he’d googled what to do on a Thursday; he’d run a particularly good math club that day and felt energized enough he was willing to try something new. When Dean had come in for the kiss Cas had thought that maybe Dean had changed his mind. Learning that it was a dare might have hurt more if Dean hadn’t blushed and looked away every time they caught each other’s eyes.
Dean couldn’t let it bother him, not when it was time for the big musical wrap party/early graduation bash had planned for Sam and the other seniors—and Cas with his masters, of course.
“And you’d sit there on my couch, holding your baby brother in your lap. How is Sam anyway?”
“Last chance, Castiel,” said Michael. “You were a good soldier. You can be again.”
“Fucking locals, man,” Dean laughed.
Claire didn’t stop. “Guys, this is Cas. Cas, the band,” she said, headed down the hallway.
“You tired yet?” he asked.
When he reached the parking lot Baby was one of the few cars still there, and none were nearly as gorgeous. The dim light of the cloudy sky still caught upon her polished frame, the drops of mist glinting like little lights, the black incongruously the brightest thing against the old asphalt and faded yellow lines, the wet leaves, the bare boughs of damp fading trees, overcast sky. Instead of getting in and heading out right away, Dean leaned against the driver's side door, jeans thick enough for the bare moisture on the car not to bother him. There was something so quiet about this Thursday afternoon, students off campus and looking for fun, professors closing up their offices and making themselves scarce. Just him and Baby and the wind, but it didn't feel lonely like it usually did. Alone, yes, but not lonely; alone like there's enough room for the self to expand to its full breadth and height, like the thing that makes you you inside is actually monstrous in size, multi-headed and many-eyed, sharp and soft in equal measure, and only during times like this can it stretch its wings. And it feels good. You breathe deep, you expand, and it feels good.
“Awesome,” he said, and dug through his bag again. A life on the road meant you never know when or where you’re going to end up eating, so he’d long ago made the habit of grabbing plastic silverware packets from food joints. He handed one to Charlie and opened another for himself. Without another word they cracked open the old tupperware, and Charlie ate half of Dean’s pie without knowing what it cost him—though he hoped that, maybe, she got the gist.
Not monsters. Not even demons.
kids.”
And still, the man sang: “But you left me far behind…”
After taking a leisurely sip, Dean eyed the menu. It was foxed at the corners, covered in old-fashion black type. Might have even been done on a real typewriter, not that it mattered as along as he could read what was on offer, and boy could he read it: bagels with cream cheese, eggs done to order, various breads and muffins, sausage or bacon sides, french toast, homemade waffles with maple syrup and whipped cream. The only real question was how much of this could he order without paying extra, because he could probably devour everything on the menu right that second. It might even be worth the extra money.
All that night he tossed and turned. Two tickets sat on the nightstand: one for Castiel, and one for the biker that everyone still talked about Thursday nights at Harvelle’s. He stared at them, gleaming white and ghostlike in his dark bedroom.
“I’ll try him next. You just do what you gotta do, okay?”
“Oh god, am I getting the ‘ogres are like onions’ talk?”
Somehow Cas still found his way to the diner most nights to get his work done anyway, and Dean sat with him on break, or when it was quiet in the later hours, and got work done of his own. And whenever it became too much, when he couldn’t smile at one more customer or do one more practice test or live inside his skin a single minute longer for having brought danger to his family, the Cool Rider always seemed to know.
Castiel dropped his bag, uncaring, and hurriedly tapped out a reply.
The flash of rage burned hot inside Dean, but he stayed still out of self-preservation as she turned and sauntered away. When he was sure she was gone he threw the wrench back onto the table and redirected his attention to the bike.
“I have to tell you—”
. Turned the heads of a group of girls drinking milkshakes as he walked by, too. When Castiel sat down they immediately leaned toward each other over their table to giggle and whisper.
“So good.” Dean used the napkin around the sandwich to wipe his face a bit, resulting in a glob of jelly hitting his shirt. “Definitely going to need to do laundry ASAP, though.”
So Cas found a seam, dug his finger under, and ripped. The paper tore easily to reveal a plain white box, and when he ripped the tape on the box and unfolded the tissue paper, there lay his gift: a white shirt with a blue grid pattern that made it look like graph paper, a pair of thick, black-framed glasses hooked in the collar, and in the front pocket…a protector.
the best big brother I could ask for. How our parents lived, he practically raised me. I’ve been following him around since I can remember. Been looking up to him since I was at least four, studying him, trying to be just like him.” Cas could imagine it well; he’d once looked up to his own brothers that way. No longer. “I know him,” Sam continued, “better than anyone else in the entire world. He’s settled in not because he no longer wants it. It’s because he’s too terrified to jump back in without a push.”
“Kevin Solo,” he tried. “You okay?”
Dean had nothing to say to that. He was crying again, they both were. How could he deny it?
“I guess we needed more evidence,” Alicia conceded. “He seems pretty cool, though. Does he write a lot about gender norms?”
Thank you for reading <3
Dean released his breath on a huff of laughter. “Yeah, tacos are great,” he agreed, hating himself more than a little for struggling to say the rest. But Jack was just a kid and damned if he was going to pass on his issues to his nephew. “Love you too.”
“Well,” said Sam, with that note of caution that Dean hated. He didn’t need the fucking kid gloves. “You moved up here for a reason, didn’t you? Maybe it’s to figure out what you want. And if Dr. Moseley thinks taking this class will help you, isn’t that a chance worth taking?”
“What do you mean?”
“Shut up,” he said, then did a double-take. “Wait, did you get all that recorded?”
“Thanks, Missouri,” Dean added.
“I know. But I’ve come to hear you.”
Dean looked down at his plate, not sure how much he agreed. It couldn’t possibly be that easy.
Dean had a chill that had nothing to do with the wind wicking the sweat from his skin. By the time he and Sam had settled in the area permanently, Cain had already established himself in the community. He was Colette’s husband, for one, and she was well liked. Besides which, if he kept to himself and didn’t add much to a conversation, well what was the big deal? There were plenty of people around who could claim Scandinavian ancestry. Being stoic, guarding your privacy, these were things the locals understood. If Cain kept his head down, who would think to question him?
Dean was hooked immediately because it was a howl, it was! Relentless and passionate and loud and
Dean hesitated. It was hard to gather the energy to move, but the thought of a hot shower was enough to give him the will to try. The car door creaked open and Dean stepped out into the cool night, biting back a grown of his own. After a couple hours in the car his whole damn body was a bruise. He patted his pocket for his wallet, and finding it there he shut the car and headed for the building. Ducking under the cloud of insects he quickly grabbed one of the large wooden handles attached the the double doors. With a sigh of old hinges, the door swung open and he slipped inside.
“Heh,” breathed Sam. He ran a hand through his hair and looked over at the arch that led into the family room. A children’s show could faintly be heard playing on the TV. “Let’s see. Our education was already spotty because of the way Dad moved us around, I could never make any friends, and just when Sioux Falls was looking like somewhere we could stay, my brother was dropping out and splitting his time between Sioux Falls and Lawrence to take care of our sick father who didn’t deserve it, and you really think school would have been my priority unless I made it my priority?”
A sharp pain, direct in both temples. A ringing in his ears like the high-pitched whine of a drill. Castiel gasped and leaned over, clutching his head.
John Winchester’s boy. I thought I recognized you, but you were a really goofy-looking kid back then so I couldn’t be sure.”
Sparks of electricity began licking at metal all over the platform. The lens kept moving.
to learn it—”
Dean knew that feeling. He remembered it. It rose up in him now, causing his eyes to water. He thought that childish little part of himself had been scrubbed out, but it was there, a tiny seed suddenly bursting a shoot, deep in his chest---
“W-what?”
Dean awoke to a clap of thunder.
probably included setting up tents and stages and all around acting as his own roadie. Instead he said, “Thank you.”
Good smells were beginning to waft from the kitchen, and loud, tipsy laughter filled the room. Castiel turned back to his grading, sipping his wine, and content to be surrounded by the easy fellowship Missouri fostered in her home. He got through a whole paper before some bickering caught his attention in the kitchen.
“Done this before?” he asked.
Castiel stood in front of the lodge where Dean had dropped him off, and watched as he immediately reversed and peeled back out onto the highway. So many, many people he was failing to help. “Gabriel,” he prayed.
Dean held up his little flip phone and waited for the next burst of seagulls rising up in a swirling white column and snapped a picture. Patience’s back was toward the camera, hands stretching up toward the birds who were just out of reach.
“It’s a very handsome face,” said Cas matter-of-factly.
Even as he’d grown older and Castiel had realized that reinvention was an illusion—how much of his own person could he possibly be, walking the path his parents had set for him?—he’d never quite gotten rid of that giddy feeling in his stomach when he breathed in the cooling air, or walked under orange and yellow leaves. It was like an instinct, his body priming itself for new challenges. For the last few years he’s shoved it aside, but now…now his family had no control over him, he was in a small Midwestern city they’d probably never been to, and it was autumn.
For a split second Dean didn’t turn; he knew that voice, that impossibly deep voice, but if he turned and it
“You seem happy enough out of it. So does he.”
No response. What was Kevin’s last name, again? Dean eyed his Star Wars shirt, which had Han splashed across the front. Good taste.
Not everything was turning up peaches and cream, though. While Cas continued his highly focused one-man mission of exploring every single inch of Dean’s body and how it responded to various ‘stimuli’ (holy shit), he was increasingly distracted outside of bed. Dean annoyed Zachariah off the premises a couple times, but Cas insisted that wasn’t the issue. Sometimes Dean wouldn’t even find him in the lodge; later he’d inform Dean that he’d been walking around the edge of the property, making sure nothing was amiss.
“Hey, Dean?” said Sam.
been his charge at one time, he'd fought hard to get her out from under Garrison, and that was the sort of habit that was hard to break.
The heavy mood lifted almost instantly. “Geometry?” Castiel asked.
“It is the End Times, Chuck Shurley,” said Castiel, rising from his chair. “And you will tell me
He thought of the music he liked. He loved a good rock song, about music and women and beer but what he really loved…Was Led Zeppelin poetry? And it wasn’t weird for a guy to be into poetry, was it? If the rock gods wrote lyrics, if it was good enough for Plant and Bowie and Queen, was it good enough for him?
Billie adjusted her bass and looked at her bandmates, or more particularly the man with the guitar, who shrugged. The space for the band to play was small, so their two mics were toward the front, and the blonde’s was set further back, closer to the drums, likely only for backing vocals.
“Coincidence,” scoffed Todd.
“Shaddup.”
“Yeah, but I do other things, like playing video games with my brother, or watching movies, going drinking with my friends.”
“You know them,” said Jody, in that fond long-suffering tone she’d perfected since becoming a foster mom. “Ever since Claire and Kaia got their own place, they operate on Claire and Kaia time. Need some help?”
The trip was a bust, just as he’d suspected it would be. But since he was already here he may as well go whole hog and check one last place the guide mentioned at the beginning of the tour: the lookout point. There was a trail that led down in to the woods and spit you out somewhere with a good photo opportunity. So he wandered through the trees on the short hike and eventually found himself on a beach.
I don’t hear the skeletons banging in the closet,
The guy nodded and waved.
Dean’s breath stoppered in his throat. “How—”
Cas considered his angle. They didn’t know each other except by reputation: Sam was a rock star whose meteoric rise to fame was accompanied by an equally spectacular crash; Cas, he was sure, was known only as the unfeeling and cutthroat exec for Garrison Records that created one of the greatest music empires, and then just as quickly was never heard from again. It’s possible that Sam’s intent this afternoon was to beg Cas for favors. Could be that he wanted Cas off his turf. Needed some kind of insider information. Wanted to take out on him what was no doubt meted out upon Sam by his own record company, Hellfire.
“Sure.”
again, and set about doodling something in his notebook to make it look like he was taking notes. God, if that wasn’t like old times with Charlie back in high school.
“Gilgamesh.”
That should have been the end of it, but no such luck. “Whatcha doin’?” the guy called over the wind and the waves.
“Yeah. You?”
“Maybe I’m wary of me, too.”
Castiel smiled. “Usually a good sign. What about?”
“He was right,” said Jody. “In the house, now. No—Dean!”
“He’s always wanted it. Both of us have always wanted it.”
“Yep,” he answered, since it was easiest. And that was that.
“What’s there to be excited about?” Dean lifted his beer, elbows on the table, and stared into it. “A thirty-two-year-old undergrad. Pathetic.”
My mother’s countenance
Missouri laughed. “Be careful or next time you turn around, he’ll be a full grown man.”
…And like it still happened every night, Dean remembered: how when Sam and Dean were still small, their father tucked them in at night if he was home, giving them each a soft kiss on their foreheads, his hard laborer’s hands gentle and comforting. He used to do that, he did. When did it stop? Which job was it, when he came home, and for the first time gave them nothing more than a squeeze on the shoulder?
Dean clapped his shoulder and squeezed. He waited until Sam’s sniffles died down before pulling back. He poured them each another finger.
, and Dean was rereading
“You feel sorrow,” Klara said wonderingly.
“Fuck yeah, dude,” said Dean. “Though, er, maybe not this stuff so much.” The big band warbled from the player, underlining his point. “I love the classics but this is a little
“No!” cried Ash, and to Cas’s astonishment, fully opened his eyes for the first time. “Tech is good. It’s how you use it,” he said wisely, like a master imparting his secrets, “it’s
you’re wearing a jacket,” said Dean, “it’s the whole—” He waved his hand up and down.
“A minute, Jo!” he called back. “Well,” he said to Cas. Dean held his eyes, just long enough for Cas to wonder. “You staying for the show?”
Castiel did not waste time. Dean’s boxers were still up in the air from Cas’s careless toss and already his dick was in Cas’s hand, running up it slowly as if examining its length, its color. Cas nudged his legs a little further apart to better fit his shoulders between them and applied the same curiosity and concentration he’d spent on the rest of Dean’s body. He used just his hands, at first, clever fingers exploring his sac, too, and pressing up against his taint. Dean already felt half crazy by the time Cas even bothered using lips and tongue, sucking and licking and staring up at Dean’s face the whole time. There was none of the theatre that Dean was used to in this either, the coy looks from under eyelashes, the
“Just Cas,” he interrupted, holding out a hand. “I work with the Mullens at CC’s Bees.”
“I bet,” Sam grinned. “I was in a few myself. Much younger than I should have been, but you know.”
“You know very well,” said Cas. “Why did you bring me here?”
It was frightening. Dean was in freefall without a parachute, but Cas was there, strong. After a month of knowing Cassie Robinson he’d confessed to her about hunting, what he’d thought was his darkest secret. She’d dismissed him out of hand—and out of her life. But now here he was, knowing Castiel for a little over a week and confessing to him the ugly, monstrous secret that lurked in the deep recesses of his heart. “He used to love me,” he confessed. “I don’t think he loves me anymore.”
“Ugh, TMI!” Sam shoved his shoulder hard. “I mean like, what’s his name? Does he have a job? Does he live around here or what?”
A chuckle swept through the club. “Cared about him, did you?” Alastair asked. “I’ve been asking around and no one seems to know who he was. Ah well. He’s dead now, so I guess it doesn’t matter.”
“He doesn’t get the family discount,” said Jo, unrepentant.
It was the moisture building in the corners of his eyes that did it. He needed to move, do something, anything. “Fuck,” he gasped. “Stop.”
“Absolutely not,” said Charlie. “Who else has seen him at the diner? Rufus? Has Cas seen him?”
“Because you made it,” said Cas. “You understand the current musical climate. You have a good head on your shoulders, good people behind you who know how to handle the PR and all that. You made it well enough to not have to sign a contract with another label once your last record was done and that is what I need.”
Dean quirked his lips in a smile and took it. “You too. Interesting name.”
“It still didn’t in its own day, popular or no. Because ‘real’ rock fans said it wasn’t really metal, or even really rock. You know why?” Billie asked, but didn’t wait for an answer. “These bands were pushing packaged pop off the tops of the charts, rock fans should have been happy about it! But nu-metal took grunge and hip-hop and their parents’ metal and put them together. Hip-hop? In rock? Strike one according to these 'fans.' Like, for real? The racist little pissants have no idea who fucking started rock as a genre. Strike two: it was unflinchingly honest. You got a man like Jonathan Davis ending an album by singing a raw-ass song about how he was raped and then sobbing for minutes. How uncomfortable do you think that made people feel? And strike three: who were in these bands? White guys, yeah, but black guys, too. Asian guys. Latino. Mixed race. Rock had been whitewashed for decades and as soon as we push back?” She mimed it, pushed her hands forward into the air and then out. “The douchebags kept saying it wasn’t really rock, and before long history started to believe it. So you can dig for today’s version of all of that, yeah, but you didn’t used to have to.”
Cas swallowed. Carefully he took off the bass and set it neatly in the stand. “No, Sam. I—I just think this isn’t what you asked me here for.” He squeezed past Dean again, but kept his eyes trained on the door. He hopped off the stage and picked up his coat. Eileen looked up at him with worried eyes, which made him pause. He attempted a smile at her, and turned it toward Sam and Dean, too. “I know I only heard the one song, but I did like it. Do what feels right to you, but for what it’s worth…you’ve got something special.” He looked down at his jacket, which he was squeezing between his hands. Taking a deep breath, he flapped it open and shrugged it on in one motion. “Thanks for the beer,” he said, and left.
Dean shrugged.
Dean stared at the words, a wobbly sapling of a beginning. They were small and pathetic on the page and shit, even his handwriting looked awful from lack of use. Who the hell did he think he was, writing down his poor verse like an angsty teenage girl, who the hell—
“Just saw Max from Gay Club. He said you were going to kick off this year’s Queer Heroes campaign?”
Cas went over to the door to watch him go. Dean was most of the way down the hall, and as Cas watched, he clomped down the stairs, presumably to the second floor where class would soon begin. Castiel was left feeling wrongfooted, and like he’d missed something very, very important.
Stone Temple Pilots -
that whispered with every beat of his heart.
“Ano,” said Castiel. “Jsem já.”
Michael closed his eyes, then turned his head to his partner. “Raphael?”
“Only last night, but, ah, no.” He swallowed. Now was the time. “I’ve actually been auditing a class.” And the whole story spilled out, how he moved out here because something was driving him, how Missouri convinced him to take the class, what it was like learning from Castiel, last night’s talk with Sam. Or, just enough of their talk that he could explain how something shifted, and the words had come to him again. How he was
. Its thudding rhythm and wailing brass overlaid with a delicate but knowing clarinet. There was a strange undercurrent to it that highlighted the emptiness of the lodge. But there had to be someone around, right?
He glanced at his classmates and quickly looked away. They were all riled up, half turned in their desks to face each other, and now looking to him to support their side. But the thing was, he supported both. Or neither. Dean cleared his throat and ignored them, narrowing his gaze to Cas. “What if…sometimes it was a dance, and sometimes it wasn’t? Like there’s love there, but it’s buried under all this…” He waved his hand, unsure how to say it. How do you even begin to describe a father like that? One who tried and tried and so often failed?
, though true crime was more Sammy’s thing, and a small one about shipwrecks on Lake Superior. Then he slid over to the newspaper rack and grabbed one of each: the
“Don’t care,” said Karen cheerfully, giving him a kiss on the cheek for good measure.
“It’s still new,” he hedged.
“You hear that, Bobby? Do I know Allen Ginsberg,” he muttered into his beer before taking a swig.
That forced Dean up. It was easier to look at Cas when he wanted to glare. “I don’t want your fucking charity.”
A pause. Dean turned around. “Your company?”
The men always came, and they liked to tell me
Dean lifted his hands. “Fine, fine.” Though he did as he was bid, Dean was not about to be outdone. Once they reached Dean’s cabin, he circled to the passenger side of the Impala and opened the door for Castiel. After a moment of surprise, Cas smiled and walked over. He put his hand on Dean’s where it was resting on the car door. “Thank you, Dean,” he said, more quietly this time.
They ran.
“In about an hour.”
There was a pause before Naomi answered. “You want me to look like the bad guy here.”
Castiel drooped, his face in a grimace of pain and fear. “I’m afraid it was more than that.”
Erasing her erases us),
Nine Inch Nails -
Unbelieving, Dean raised his eyes and looked into the deep-space dark of his helmet’s visor. The Rider lifted his gloved hands to its edge as he watched, but without thinking Dean grabbed them and pulled them back down. Maybe it wasn’t fair, but if the Rider had a face, Dean couldn’t imagine it anymore. Not that he was imagining anything in particular; he was just imagining
Cas tilted his head in silent question.
The last night Patience and her family were staying at the motel, Castiel decided to hold a bonfire. With the promise of s’mores on the horizon, Dean made sure to leave the Two Harbors Public Library with plenty of time to spare. Happily Cas took little convincing to accept help this time, and soon enough the two of them were lugging bags of marshmallows and boxes of graham crackers out to the firepit. “You got a table or something?” he asked.
Dean opened his mouth, coaxed the Rider into taking the lead. He didn’t jump in with the rushed energy of a drunken one-night stand, or take rough, biting possession. The Rider swept in with confidence and control of a man who knew exactly what he was capable of. Took what was offered to him and nothing more. Gave Dean everything he needed. Christ, were his knees actually going weak? It might have just been exhaustion, because after an age of deep, tingling kisses his mouth went slack. He dragged his wet lips across the Rider’s stubbled jaw and dropped his head onto his shoulder. The Rider adjusted their embrace, arms steady across his back, body soft to the touch but harder than steel, supporting Dean’s weight with no effort. He was so fucking solid, like nothing could get through him. In that moment, Dean believed it. Tears pricked in his eyes. He couldn’t even remember the last time he didn’t have to be a son or a brother or a worker or anything that someone needed. With the Rider holding him, he could stand there and just
At this, Sam was surprised. “But…you were considered one of the best in the business. They said you could scout talent from three beers down and 50 rows back.”
It was Cas’s turn to be surprised. “Of course. It was my job to know all the popular kinds of music. And the unpopular ones too, in case the pendulum started swinging the other way.”
“Finally,” said Brady.
Dean shrugged. “Gift from Sammy. You ready for the Dean Winchester Experience?”
“Well,” said Charlie, who walked home, “see you next week.”
“Why don’t I remember that?” Castiel asked. A terrifying new feeling was growing inside him, something that burned hot and squeezed his organs. Panic. “I don’t remember.”
. And I work hard at my job and Eileen works hard at her job because that’s how we keep what we’ve earned. The point is…if you have the opportunity, education is a powerful tool. But to get out of it what you need, you have to know what you want.” He eyed Dean earnestly, as if he could read his desires on his face.
“No shit,” said Cas.
“Right,” Dean echoed. Shoving his papers back into his bag, he shuffled over to the coffee pot. Karen had clearly already laid out the mugs, all of the holiday- or winter-themed. He picked one with a gingerbread man speeding around the lip. After filling it to the brim, he cautiously sat down at the table across from Karen, next to Cas. He dropped his bag on the floor near his feet. “Um. Good morning.”
“Boy, you’re talking to me about knowing Allen Ginsberg and you’ve never heard of Langston Hughes, one of the greatest poets this country ever produced? Harlem Renaissance? Nothing?”
original because of all the quotes and allusions?”
Billie took over the lead for the next couple songs and no wonder. But then when Dean stepped up again, something softer. A plea. The band went more esoteric than they usual traveled and played Radiohead.
“You are the most New England ever,” Dean joked.
Won’t you come with me?
Dean tightened his grip on the wheel, skin pulling tight over raw knuckles. He was so tired.
“Hell no,” said Billie. “This jacket’s expensive.”
So he hopped on.
“You think?”
“What’s it doing in your nightstand?”
“Relax,” said Dean. “I can keep my cabin for another night?”
“When the show’s over,” Billie continued, “and they search the audience for the people they look up to, when your brother comes down out of the booth, who do you think they’re gonna want to see?”
Dean’s dream was still alive. And if he ever asked for help with it, Cas planned to be there.
“That’s right,” Vic said, snapping. “We heard about nothing else from you for a week. But since then?” He shrugged.
“Well, yeah, but you know.” He smiled, trying for charming.
Instead he looked at Cas, and was surprised to find him looking back instead of following the new debate. His expression was open but complex, something of respect, somewhat calculating. Dean couldn’t parse it. He got that feeling of being
His brother grinned in victory. “It’s Sam.” He kicked Dean under the table. “Jerk.”
“Nope,” said Dean. He shivered, and Cas immediately raised his arm for Dean to duck under. Fuck it, thought Dean, and accepted the offer. Cas was wearing another sweater today, in a black and white knit pattern. It was soft. His sweaters were always soft.
At least once a week he treated himself at the diner. Dean wasn’t always working when he came in, but he always made an effort to say hi. Cas liked that Dean’s smiles were easier around him, and he also liked that Dean’s friends sometimes came in on the nights Dean was working and said hi to him too—even sat with him to chat over breakfast skillets or pie.
Dean hadn’t written poetry in years. Hadn’t read it in even longer.
“The hell are you talking about?”
“He definitely meant some of the shit he said. And I might be a little bitch but I am long, long since past caring what other people think of me. Or I thought I was. Because…” He drained his glass, poured himself a third. “I haven’t thought about him in a long time. He died and I thought, well, that’s over then. But I’m thinking of him now and you know what I remember? Not all the shit he said, ‘cause those days when he was mean were a dime a fucking dozen. Not that time he left me behind at that boys’ home as a punishment for stealing food, even though the moment I realized he wasn’t coming for me was one of the worst moments of my fucking life. Not the couple of times he raised a hand to me—kids out there get beat a lot more than that, what’s the big deal?”
“Thank you, Dean, but this is the headspace I’m in right now.”
Well. There goes that excuse to stay.
Dean shook his head and started the hike back up to his cabin, rubbing at an itch just under his necklace. The trees protected him from some of the wind but the drizzle collected on the leaves, which released them in big fat drops on Dean’s head. Halfway back up his side began to pinch something fierce. Sitting in one place for so long probably hadn’t been a good idea. At least he had a nice clean bed waiting for him, he could read there until it was time for dinner.
Great. Good sign. Dean plowed on anyway: in for a penny. “In the end, the way his poetry works? Isn’t it
Cas sat back and regarded Dean for a moment.
Colette was waiting for him on the porch, standing in front of the screen door with hands on her hips and a smile on her face. She was wearing some old overalls and a plaid shirt underneath, her graying hair swept up in a messy bun. The cold, early spring breeze swooped by and set the wind chimes dancing around her.
“Goodnight, Dean.”
There was no thought, just pure instinct as Dean slammed on the brakes, a shot of adrenaline leaving him wide-eyed and shaking.
He sighed and wandered outside toward the bleachers. Ash and Aaron had already made a home for themselves beneath them, and looked relaxed and ready, like the rest of the day, the entire week could wash on by and it would be all the same to them. Dean hesitated. They’d let him bum the odd hit before during the course of the year, and he could really use something to dull him. In a different way from English being dull.
In the fifth: If anyone’s got their ears on, please protect them from this, whatever it is.
“Sounds like a stupid college assignment to me,” said Krissy. “Some of us aren’t college material.”
He spoke then of starting at Old Nick’s, where his talent was recognized very quickly. The Pit he spoke of with equal reverence and fear, the size of the place, the heat, the endless stripping and rebuilding of bikes. He described the network of thieves, some of them freelance. The skill of the mechanics and engineers, the painters and salesmen, and most of all the Hellraisers who ran it all. “They built their empire on their chop shop,” said Dean. “But they used it to finance a lot of other hinky stuff. And I mean hinky. We all knew it, it’s just if you weren’t a member of the gang…”
“So many things have changed over the course of this world, but still there’s a constancy unspoiled for many millennia. Sometimes I fear a greater change. Other times I wonder whether I’m letting my fear mislead me.”
“What did he say, then?”
—the poem ripped something open inside of him, drew out his veins, and pulled the tangled strands south, planting them in the fertile soil of his first home, rooted in his family history and for the first time…
Sam gave Cas a weird look for his blunt statement, but just shrugged for Dean’s benefit. “His name’s Cas. And we got to talking about music, so I, uh, thought he might like—”
It was on one such spring evening when they left the local Indian restaurant, Castiel eating the candied cardamom they kept at the register, when they found themselves walking along the riverbank. The low sun pulled in the water threads of gold and orange.
“Dean,” Castiel damn near whined, his voice gruff and winded.
“What?” Dean asked, looking down at Jack.
“Alright, okay, maybe I was a little harsh,” Dean walked over and pulled out two mugs from the cabinet.
After that, he packed his work away and walked over to the couch to collect his son. He pulled Jack’s bag over his shoulder, then snuck his arms under Jack’s knees and head. He lifted him up and carried him out the shop to his car. He strapped him up in the back seat and drove home, reminding himself the whole way that there was no reason to feel even an ounce of excitement over a goddamn play date.
“I mean,” he started. Paused. Then started again, “I mean, are you free to come over?  I don’t know if you’re working right now or…”
“Have I mentioned that I hate you? And are you gonna let me tell you, or you gonna crack wise ones the whole time?”
“Good point. Did it work?” Sam asked, and now he was chewing like he’d settled down for snack during Dean’s
“I suppose… I could stop by. Is Claire there? She should be in school,” his tone was getting more strict, and Dean couldn’t help the little chuckle that escaped him.
But Castiel was just staring back, determined almost. Those big, blue eyes were searching Dean’s right back. Likely looking for anything to suggest that this little stunt was some sort of farce; looking to see if Dean really meant it.
and then leaves? Dean had never felt so equally turned on and rejected at once than he had in that moment.
He nearly popped the glass door off it’s wheels as he yanked it open. He yelled out, “You two,” he pointed at Jack and Claire. “Come inside. Claire’s leaving.”
Jack was oddly quiet for a while after that. He seemed to be in his head until dinner when he made his way back to his usual, carefree self. Dean thought to ask about it, but figured it was just nerves from the minor altercation at the front door.
“Hey, loser,” was the first thing she said when the line connected.
“What’s there to explain? I tell you I’m gay and you start getting twitchy,” Dean uncrossed his arms and motioned toward Castiel. He shoved them into his pockets after that and leaned against the doorframe.
He sat Castiel down first, then went to his DVD player to pop in Jack and his traditional Halloween movie.
Because Dean wasn’t one to sulk and brood for long, he decided to take matters into his own hands.
To Dean’s surprise, Castiel was an excellent kisser. He bit and licked and sucked on Dean’s mouth like he was mapping out every curve and dip. Dean was more than appreciative to the treatment. And by then, Dean’s blood had drained down to his cock. He could feel it swelling with need and desperation. His hands traveled down and gripped Castiel’s hips. In one swift movement, he lifted Castiel, turned and walked until he was able to sit him down on the kitchen table. It was so fluid that Dean would’ve thought they’d been doing this for years.
“I am not answering that and you are not changing the subject,” Sam said once he’d collected himself, not even close to budging.
Once they were there, Jack sat on the couch in Dean’s office while Dean found some ointment, alcohol and bandages to clean the kid up. He wiped away the bits of dried blood, then dabbed at Jack’s split lip with the alcohol and covered it with ointment. He did the same for Jack’s cheek where the skin had broken, then put a bandage over the scratch. Once he was done, he leaned back to look over his handy work.
The doorbell was still ringing when they got down the stairs. Dean rolled his eyes and shouted, “Alright! I’m coming!” The doorbell stopped.
“Everyone says that Novak has a crush on this other girl, Kaia. They started  making fun of her, calling her a dyke. Novak started yelling at them, and I remembered what you said about using words. So, I told them that I was a dyke too, so she wouldn’t feel bad about it.” When Jack finished his explanation, the office grew quiet while Dean digested the information.
But, given the admission, Dean wasn’t capable of much at the moment, let alone laughter.
Dean had figured things would get a little awkward after his last conversation with Castiel, but he didn’t think it would be as bad as it turned out to be.
Dean answered the door wiping his hands with a small towel after having just washed them. “Hey, Cas,” he smiled and looked down at a sulking Claire. “Claire,” he said and she rolled her eyes.
Dean chuckled. “See you then, I guess,” he said as he pulled the phone from his ear.
Dean ignored him, “I was thinking you and Claire should come over for a little play date?”
“What?” Castiel’s eyes widened. His face flared up and his ears were extremely red.
Dean gave her a look, then to Jack again. “You punched a girl?” he asked, barely masking the humor in his voice.
“Two…” Dean continued. Then paused before he got to one. He was looking deep into Castiel’s eyes, searching for anything that might allude to a slap on the cheek or being cursed out by the world’s most eloquent professor.
Dean leaned back, away from the kiss, and sighed. He felt his lips spreading into a grin, and he would’ve felt bad about it if he didn’t see the way Castiel smiled at him in return.
“Seriously? Novak? What’s this kid got against you?” Dean let go of Jack’s face and walked toward the door leading into the house. Jack clutched his book bag straps and happily followed his father.
Dean scoffed, “I can see that. By who?” His nerves flared as the question left his lips. It’s not like he could go to the elementary school and pick a fight with the little shit who did this to his kid. But the thought did cross his mind. Who the hell would want to hurt his Jack? The kid was a saint.
“Super. And, uh, you can call me Dean,” he was smiling now, and he wasn’t really sure why.
“Oh yeah? Then why did you call?”
Dean and Castiel looked at each other. Castiel looked mortified for the most part. Dean could only smile weakly and shrug.
“Okay, but seriously, Dean. Why the hell are you telling me all this? Doesn’t the solution seem kind of obvious?”
Dean did laugh at that. “Why?” He couldn’t help but ask.
“Yes,” Castiel said, then waited while Dean fumbled in his mind for what he wanted to say.
Castiel’s eyes narrowed further. And great, now Dean was pissing him off.
He had the money. Oddly enough, he wasn’t doing too badly. At twenty-one he was living at the family home in Lawrence, Kansas. His mother and father long gone. One from liver damage caused by alcohol poisoning, the other killed in a fire at her job at the hospital. He’d been working since he was sixteen and able, earning money for Sam to go to law school and living with his surrogate father, Bobby, until he was old enough to inherit the property. He’d dropped out and settled for a GED and took odd jobs until Bobby let him help out at the auto shop.
