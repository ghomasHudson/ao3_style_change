“I'm alone, and I'm thinking about you. Of course I have my hands down my pants. Take your jeans off. Leave the purple sweater on.”
Sherlock didn’t want to say he’d already considered this and gotten stuck on the idea of leaving Scotland and his honeymoon behind, even for a day or two. He knew it was selfish of him, but he also knew there was little to be gained by looking into an empty trunk.
Sherlock's numbers skyrocketed, and by the next to last day Sherlock had a very respectable 3,546 followers.
Sherlock didn't answer, preoccupied as he was running his fingers up and down John's back, over his shoulders, into his hair, behind his ears, everywhere and anywhere he could reach. John giggled when Sherlock ran his thumbs into the hollows of John's armpits, but Sherlock was not deterred. The surface of John's skin must have been radiating pheromones, or maybe it was serving as some sort of testosterone amplifier, or perhaps it was even an aphrodisiac specific to the Watson gene pool. Sherlock needed more.
Sherlock watched as John closed his eyes, a satisfied smile still plastered on his face. He shifted onto his side under the covers, shrugging the blanket up and over his shoulder, and continued to stare at John. Post-coital John, his husband. His husband, after sex. Fascinating.
John started humming small sounds of satisfaction as he licked and kissed. Sherlock adjusted his palms on the wall, and tried to string a thought together.
Instead of racing away, John held out his arms in a dancer’s position and let Sherlock skate into them. Hands on shoulders and waists, they made their way around the rink to the sound of Johnny Mathis crooning decades old Christmas music.
Tendrils of steam drift over the huddle, slips of warm air sent upward as emperors shift against each other. The whisps soon disappear, but while they exist, they are tinged with the pinks and oranges of the sun as she rises over the sea.
“Yes, fourteen so far, but always in the mail, untraceable. I hadn’t received any in the last eight months, and this is the first one I’ve found in my house.”
. She was trim, and had long, thick, strawberry-blond hair with a no-nonsense center part. She didn't wear makeup, which the adults would like, and although, yes, she wore a dress, it was navy blue with long sleeves, and a demure collar.
John had never been easy to ignore, even when they were children, what with him popping over to the Holmes’ farm whenever he’d finished his chores. Sherlock had tried to stay where he was comfortable, on the far side of civil, but John Watson had remained a child-sized force unto himself, and unto Sherlock, too, because that’s where John Watson had aimed himself.
“Ignore Charles. Everyone else does.” In No-Body-Hair’s place stood a man in his late-twenties with shaggy blond hair, freckles, and deep set brown eyes. “Hi. I’m Rudy.” Rudy held out his hand for John to shake, then reached over the counter and shook Sherlock’s hand.
John rested his head on the heel of his hand, and stretched his legs. “No, not as such. But I do give it thought, from time to time. I’m not getting any younger, and – no, hear me out – neither are you.
Sherlock puffs up like a blowfish, full of pride at their success, and John sneaks him a quick peck on the bill.
Molling dips below, then pops back up with a small herring in her bill. She swallows it down, whole, and Sherlock wants to throttle her. Why is she
John is in my bed and he is taking off my clothes and he is very good at taking off my clothes but then again John Watson is talented in many unexpected ways
“Doesn’t matter. We’ll both last longer when we’re old and grey, and then you’ll apologize for taking too long.”
“Jesus, Sherlock.” John rubbed his hands up Sherlock’s sides, to his shoulders, and gave them a quick squeeze before petting back down his back to his hips. “You give me so much, you know that? You’re so open to me. I don’t know which I love more, giving you pleasure, or watching you take it.”
At some point, John came in and set a cup of coffee and a plate of buttered toast down on the desk. He ruffled Sherlock’s hair, kissed the top of his head, and left again.
“While you were sleeping. I got extra towels from housekeeping, and these glasses and candles from the front desk. Is it okay?”
Sherlock watched as John came closer, as he gently pushed Sherlock onto his back, as he hovered over him. John’s first kiss was a tease, just a brush and a nudge of breath and lips. It was what John’s hand was doing under the sheet that had caught Sherlock’s full attention. John’s hand had drifted down Sherlock’s chest, over his ribs, over his hip, and was now pressed high up on Sherlock’s inner thigh. Sherlock tried to turn into it, to trap John’s hand between his legs, but John held him in place and kissed him again. This kiss was firmer. This kiss said that Sherlock was to listen, to follow John’s lead. John had said that he had an idea and Sherlock generally liked John’s ideas, so he stilled his body and kissed back.
Sherlock sank deep into the rise and fall of John’s body as he breathed, the vibration of his voice in his chest, and the stroke of John’s hand caressing his neck and playing with his hair.
Kevin pressed his fist to his mouth and tried not to laugh, while Greg failed to close his dropped jaw and jabbed his fork at Kevin. “I told you! I told you the walls weren't as soundproof as you thought they were!”
to instruct, advise, save the life of, spare, preserve, conserve, show, point at, point out, guide, direct, indicate.
Back to the pots and powders and creams, he selects a powder rouge and puts the brush aside, using his finger instead to swipe and gather the colour. He tugs his corset down a bit to make sure his nipples are uncovered, then swirls the rosy pigment onto each oval, making the peaks stand out, popping pink against the pale skin of his lean chest.
“According to her, she’s known since we were in diapers.” John sat on the edge of the bed and snagged a piece of toast from the tray. “She worries about you, you know. She wants you to be happy.”
Greg waved the remote over his shoulder, not bothering to turn around. “You guys go ahead. We’ll wait for the food to arrive, and shower after dinner.”
“Okay. Go on then. Get going. The sooner we do this the sooner we can start thinking about the next time. There's nothing left for us in this one, so let's just think forward to the next one, fifty-three days from now. It'll go fast.”
“Sometimes I forget. No, I don’t forget, but I lose sight of the significance of it, I guess. You lost half your family, Sherlock. And then Mycroft left, what, two years later?”
Sherlock closed his eyes and gave himself a mind palace smack-down for contributing to that mess. This was not the time to be a drama queen. He was Sherlock Holmes, for Christ’s sake. He had always relied on logic to understand the world around him and he needed to do so now. The solution for this situation would not be hard to find if he applied a few basic rules of deduction.
Now Imi peers into its depths, her petite fingers gently rummaging until she finds something that catches her eye.
started. The woman next to him whispered, “Off you go, sir! Good luck!” Sherlock stepped out onto the veranda. Across the length of it stood John, dressed almost exactly like Sherlock but for a navy blue tie and waistcoat.
"But I only had a drop, just a taste! Was it that potent? Would one little drop have been enough to cause that kind of reaction?"
He is surprised when he wakes up the next morning, because to wake up means he fell asleep, and he was sure he wouldn't have time to sleep with all the scenario planning still left to do. But he wakes up, and when he does, Anahera is just coming back with a long strand of Himantothallus grandifolius, and Tui rushes over to inspect it, humming and hawing over the best way to utilize it.
Sherlock couldn't stop now, not after what John had just done for him. He could have followed John back and tied the numbers again, but he was too selfish. He needed this too badly.
John touched his chest, his nipples, his belly, letting his fingers drop to tease along the edge of Sherlock's pubic hair, the follicles there tingling, murmuring messages to his groin.
The compliment is unexpected, but comforting. Sherlock ducks his head in acknowledgment, then changes the topic.
John stands and moves toward the kitchen with his cup and saucer, then stops, turns, and puts it back down on the coffee table. He grabs all of the chocolate biscuits from the plate on the tray, picks up his jacket from the back of a kitchen chair, and walks out the front door.
John nodded. “I agree, it was one of the most amazing sexual experiences we've ever had. And yeah, we were already there. I've been there for a long time.”
"Tell people in notes that I said to grab a fire extinguisher before reading because spontaneous combustion is likely."
“Yeah, I’d like to know that, too,” Mary said, blowing some fringe out of her eyes before resting her cheek on the floor.
”I’ve held on to this guilt for half my life. I’d like to say that I’ll wake up tomorrow and see everything differently, but I don’t know if it works like that. I’d like it to, though, if that helps.
Satisfied that he wasn’t completely hideous, Sherlock tugged on the white silk boxer briefs that had come with his wedding garments. He shimmied them over his thighs and snapped the elastic along his waist, then stood back and stared. John had guessed the measurements of the pyjama bottoms and two tops perfectly, but perhaps measurements of a more intimate nature had been harder to gauge because these did not fit Sherlock at all.
They’d been teasing each other all day, glances and touches, little things only the other would catch. Sherlock had sat at the picnic table, watching John run his thumb and index finger up and down the neck of his Budweiser bottle, and gone hard. Sherlock had retaliated by licking butter off his corn-on-the-cob, sucking each and every finger into his mouth when he was done.
It was quiet and single-minded and fast, their hands pulling them toward release. Afterward Sherlock panted into John's hair and said, “I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I couldn't wait.”
“No, it's not. At least it doesn't have to be.” And with that John grabbed his laptop and made a few definitive taps with one finger. He dropped the computer back down to the desk and said, “There. Now I'm following you, and so you've won by one.”
Sherlock fairly bounced up the steps to his flat, if bouncing was something he’d ever done before, shook the rain out of his hair, and dumped his backpack just inside the front door.
It had a floral print, with huge red and burgundy roses unfurling on a creamy background, and leaves in a half-a-dozen different shades of green. It had deep pockets, and short sleeves, and a fabric belt that she always tied in a low, loose knot at the back. He loved that dress, because she looked like a garden of love when she wore that dress.
Overly full, warm and tingling from the wine, flushed with contentment from the events of the day, Sherlock jiggled his shoulder under John’s arm and pulled one knee up into his lap.
Sherlock’s mind kicked into high gear, temporarily displacing the John-John-John-John-John-Paris-Honeymoon monument that had sprouted up and taken over his brain. Stay over? Was the sofa a pull-out? How much privacy would they have? Sherlock planned on having epic sex with John as soon as he could get them both naked. Would Greg and Kevin hear them? What if someone walked in on them? On the other hand, wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Lake Michigan, a fridge stocked with food and drink, and probably 100% Egyptian cotton towels. That shower for two …
“I feel great about bathing together,” John beamed. They climbed into their seats and John turned the key in the ignition. “Do you want to take a bath together?”
Greg asked what they were planning to do with their remaining time, which led to a list of recommendations the likes of which set Sherlock’s head spinning.
“Of course not. I’m happy to fuel the fires, John.” She poured more milk into both their glasses, then pushed back and began gathering the dishes.
Grabbing for each other, blind with tremors, they came back to soft and slow and sweet, to gentle kisses and secret smiles and all the whispered words. What they had now was perfect, and what they’d yet to discover would happen in its own good time.
Sherlock shuddered. “God, hush your mouth. If she ever heard that she’d steal the idea. Have you seen what elephant dung does to a lawn?”
The chicks have circled back around and are jumping on Ariki and Kahu, who are pretending to be injured and calling for mercy. “They’re all right, Sherlpeng. I’d leave our little one with them, you know?”
A little buzz moves up Sherlock’s spine at the thought of him being noticed. “Everyone else is an idiot.”
Sherlock stands wing to wing with John and takes in the vista before them: hundreds of chicks with all their cuteness and curiosity and chaos to spare. “Look at them. Look at how amazing they are, growing and learning and exploring all the time, every single moment. They have everything ahead of them. We could teach them so much, John, couldn’t we? Wouldn’t we be good parents?”
John returned to 221b a changed man. He was no longer as pliable, no longer as prepared to sacrifice his own sensitivities at the altar of Sherlock's madness. He had been lied to, walked over, abused, and dismissed, and now he fairly thrummed with “don't even fucking try it” vibes. He seemed intent on exhibiting this newfound independence and fortitude through the most subtle of manoeuvres. He hogged the bathroom, he stopped buying the milk, never took out the garbage. He began using Sherlock's favourite mug, and rearranged the paperwork on the desktop to better suit him, and then he stopped asking if Sherlock would mind cleaning the body parts out of the fridge and began discarding them himself.
Sherlock filtered what John had said through his own research on sexuality, which was admittedly very little. “How many labels are there?”
For a moment Sherlock knows what skybirds know. His toes clear the sea and he is airborne, soaring at great heights over the earth. The sun breaks the horizon in ribbons of pink and orange and Sherlock greets her, breathing in crisp, cold air as gravity brings him home. He meets the ice with a graceful skid and lets momentum carry him, then pushes off with his feet lest he comes to a stop.
Sherlock touched one of John’s nipples with the tip of his tongue, felt it harden, and licked at it again. “Like I said earlier, it’s most likely the one who’s lost a brother.”
“No harm done, John. We need to join the others now, but there is one last thing I must say before we reach the council grounds.”
forever, but Tui stops him, and says that forever isn't only until they stop being pengs. Forever means always, for the rest of time, even if there comes a time that there are no more pengs, no more ice, no more sea. It means there can never be a different interpretation made, by anyone, about who they were to each other.
John’s fist connected squarely on the side of the doctor’s jaw, and Laffitte went down like a sack of potatoes.
“She has all these printouts that she says prove it but she wouldn’t let me see them. She gave them all to Detective Donovan and she said she’d give them to a financial forensics investigator and in the meantime, I’m out of a job and I’m not supposed to come here at all.” Molly wiped at her eyes and tucked a strand of mousy brown hair behind her ear. “Why would she do this to me? Why does she hate me so much?”
This has really gone on quite long enough. He’s going to need more than Harriet. Sherlock swivels 180°, then again in reverse, until he spots who he’s looking for. He gives a sharp call, and the other peng twists around, sees Sherlock, and waves. He drops to his belly and toboggans down a short but steep slope, picking up good speed. He slows himself by dragging his wings as he gets closer, comes to a complete stop near Sherlock’s side, then bill-plants and pops back up.
"Both. I like the silhouette it lends this dress, I like the way it supports my posture, and I like the way it looks ... without the dress."
“And we both appreciate your focus, but nothing is going to happen for at least another day or two, if not longer, and you can’t not eat or drink until then. Plus, after this we’ll go on that hike we talked about, so you’ll need some energy.”
“I will. And you, too. We talk all the time about what I’m comfortable with, but you should tell me the same things about yourself. You’re more experienced than I am but that doesn’t mean you don’t have preferences.”
He was buttering slices of toast and steeping the tea when he heard the doorbell. In his anticipation of the night to come, he had forgotten that Annette, the waitress’ sister, was starting at the house that day. He wiped his hands on a tea towel and made his way to the front door.
John kissed Sherlock with a wide open mouth, slipping his tongue inside and licking against Sherlock’s lips and tongue. Sherlock groaned and grabbed at John’s shoulders, his hips rutting into thin air.
. Sherlock flanks Tui’s other side, and they dive down and away from Pobeda, just enough, just exactly enough and not one iota more. Sherlock lifts his free wing in front of them and waves it, one — two — three, and they’re off.
They turned the last corner and the club came into view. The low-key, brick facade and red awnings could have belonged to any local business, but the crowd of meticulously coiffed and fastidiously dressed young men outside screamed
“I thought maybe I had killed the mood with my panic attack and condemnation of the gay club scene.”
Two-and-a-half weeks into the wager Sherlock logged onto Tumblr, checked his follower count, and frowned. He had lost ten followers. He pursed his lips and pressed his index fingers under his chin. Why had he lost followers? Had John lost followers too? If so, it would indicate a problem on Tumblr’s side and no wrongdoing of his own. After all, he had perfected his posting formula. He had computed the proper subject matter ratios (no more than three posts of any nature before throwing in an otter picture), he knew the exact times of day to post in order to ensure the highest number of potential new followers (between 7:00 pm and 11:00 pm), and he had set up his queue to do most of the work for him.
John smiled, placed the lip of the bottletop against the edge of the counter, and slapped the bottle with his hand. The top popped off and rattled to a rest somewhere near the glassware. “You can keep it, thanks.”
on it but pengs, which is why they make do without building nests or presenting relics to their mates.
“We can order delivery from one of the restaurants listed in the guest directory, eat in bed while we watch a movie, then you know, stuff, then shower and get ready to go out –”
“It's perfect. You're perfect.” John shifts to the edge of the bed and leans forward, planting one small kiss at the centre of each of Sherlock's glistening arse cheeks. Sherlock rocks back on his heels and wiggles, so John grabs him by the hips and licks one unbroken swipe from perineum to sacrum, then tugs him back, seating Sherlock on his lap, back to front.
John’s bottom lip glanced off Sherlock's, and Sherlock’s tongue darted out to explore where John had touched him, elements of everything Watson seared on his skin.
Janine talks about the recent changes in emperor laws as a result of the tooth and heartstone and the ban on Apologist behaviours, but he tunes out again when another peng comes to stand by his side.
John sips his tea, loudly, because this is beginning to feel like a competitive tea-sipping contest.
The answering call comes from somewhere nearby but out of sight, and they follow it, Anahera calling, the other bird answering, until they meet in the middle.
Sherlock took a step back and looked up at the original windows, the bird nests on the chimney, the patchy, shingled roof. “You must like something about this one very much.”
Terina arrives, rushed and out of breath. “Oh, good, I was so afraid I would be late, and miss the start. How are you all this morning?”
Sherlock pressed his cheek into John’s hand. “I hope he knows he can always call Mycroft and talk to him about how he’s traded futures and all that. Mycroft would help him in any way he could.”
Sherlock watched in wonder as John picked up the pace. The harder John rode him the harder John’s cock got, until it was rigid and smacking against his body with each thrust.
They made quick work of the rest of it, then Sherlock turned off the bedside lamp and climbed in after John. They were on each other immediately, mouths coming together in the dark. Whatever arousal Sherlock had tried to tamp down since John arrived earlier in the day rushed back to the surface, almost overwhelming in its strength. He moaned into the kiss, and grabbed as much of John’s ass in his hands as he could.
“Excellent. Let's go in and ask Granddad where the photographs are, and we'll find one for the party.”
Outside of conscious thought, Sherlock’s cock was having the time of its life and his balls were singing in praise of their imminent release. His arse ached with the repetitive contractions and his thighs were straining, but Sherlock’s physicality was in a secondary dimension to the emotional and mental bliss of taking John so thoroughly apart.
Annette threw her head back and laughed. “Seeing James? Romantically? Lord, no. He has been dating a little bit, though. Only men, as far as I know.”
"I would love that!" Sarah twiddled her fingers, let John open the car door, and whispered, “You both might want to leave, too, and give her a bit of space.”
“So, tell me again, Sherlock. You woke up from your unconscious state, a state in which you fancied yourself able to breathe on the ocean floor and chat with mythological seals, as well as fly to the heavens and converse with the essence of the gods, and then removed the item you’ve been charged to protect with your very life, and decided to take a nap. Do I have this right?”
They sat in companionable silence for another minute and then Annette hopped down and rounded the table again. Sherlock watched her carve the chicken and arrange slices of it on an antique-looking ceramic platter.
“And how about this?” Sherlock sucked John’s fingers down deep and tight and bobbed his head up and down.
“I do not have that journey in me right now, to be honest. It was essential when I left Cassiopeia, because of Moringa’s subversive actions regarding the tooth. That was absolutely a matter for the High Council. And the heartstone is, as well, but we need time with it here, in our own colony, if we are to benefit from what it represents.”
John turned his head to the side and Sherlock saw the smile play over his face. He didn’t say anything, so Sherlock settled his hands under John’s shoulder blades and dug his thumbs up toward John’s spine.
"Elder Erebus, excuse me Sir, but that sounds like a purposeful misinterpretation of the legend to suit the wishes of a small contingent of pengs."
They kissed, then kissed some more, until the kisses faded into the edges of exhaustion, fell silent, and slept.
His thoughts drifted to his childhood, to the before-times, when his world was a patch of earth lined with corn and dirt roads and a straight path to John Watson’s house. That life was underpinned with the safety and security of his parents’ love and attention, the presence of an older brother whom he shadowed like a puppy, and the doting care of Mrs. Hudson. He’d never stopped to question that life when he’d had it ‒ and why would he have?
"It's very considerate of you to take interest in my arousal, and I do appreciate your attempts to move things along, but –"
Underneath him, Sherlock was one long moan, trying to rut against the weight of John on top of him. He straightened and lowered his legs, letting them hang just above the bed, and squirmed, looking for that perfect angle. He whimpered when he found it.
“Mmm, that’s beautiful, Sherlock. A work of art. I’m rather proud of the results, to be honest with you.”
They have summarily dismissed the idea that they simply approach her and ask for it back, proceeding with force if she refuses to cooperate. They suspect that she suspects that they suspect that she has the tooth. If they confirm that they know, there is nothing to stop her from using its inherent power, swiftly and without remorse, to her advantage. Unless, Mycroft reminds them, she has hidden it elsewhere on the iceberg, and does not have it on her body.
“I swear to God, Sherlock,” John said, voice breaking as he released another fistful of torn paper into the air around them. “Okay. Listen to me. I appreciate this, I do, and I know you were just trying to take control over something you feel you have no control over, but I do not want to take you up on this offer. I'm not seeing other people because I don't want to. I don't need to. If I ever do need or want to I will tell you, I promise you, and the same goes for you, Sherlock. You have the right to do the same, okay? You just tell me. So, you've made your offer and I've rejected it. Are we clear?”
Then, finally, he sees John, and they are in each other’s wings. John rocks on his feet, both tugging Sherlock against him, and pressing himself flush against Sherlock. They kiss each other’s bills and faces and necks, and then John rests his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder and whispers, “You came. You came.”
“I'd like that. I'll stay all summer, just you and me and Granddad and the bees. Can we watch a movie tonight?”
“Oh. Um, I don't know. I think some of the things that turn me on in theory might not actually turn me on in practice. I haven't figured that one out yet. I like it when you swat my ass during sex, but that's not really the same as putting me over your lap and spanking me.”
Sherlock sat. “You’re very sexy sitting there like that in your skin tight underwear, but those socks have to go.” John knelt down and pulled at Sherlock’s socks. He looked up at him and smiled. “Go on. Tell me about the porn magazine. Tell me what you learned, or what you liked.”
Sherlock hailed a Yellow cab and opened the door for John. Once inside, he asked the driver to bring them to Foster and Clark, and leaned back against the seat. “Professionals with long-term partners, maybe some kids, and a second home in Michigan.”
“Sherlock, for heaven's sake, stop skulking about in the hallway and come have breakfast,” Mummy said, teaspoon clanking as she stirred.
Sherlock soars. He soars and soars and soars, and the lonely sky descends to meet him. The sky is honest. It may be cruel, but it is always honest. Sherlock floats to the heavens and feels silky cloud fluff press against the bottom of his feet. It seeps into his tail feathers.
Sherlock did. He knew exactly what John meant. It was the anticipation of seeing each other again, and the excitement of John sneaking into his house in the middle of the night, and the conversation with Mrs. Hudson, and wanting to tell John that he loved him, and then holding back, and then the mess with Mrs. Watson and Sarah, and his own insecurities, and then finally telling each other how they felt, and then planning for what they’d done that afternoon, and then doing it. And it had all happened in about three days.
Sherlock’s eyebrows rose, his eyes skating between John’s eyes and the hand that clutched him. John swallowed and released him, smoothing out the wrinkles in the sleeve of Sherlock’s tweed blazer.
Pōrangi swims around him in a slow circle, her body twisting, undulating. She blinks at him as she passes, great sweeps of smooth eyelids over round, black eyes. She is graceful. She is sleek. She is enormous. She could swallow him whole.
In the kitchen they find the tiara and a tiny magnifying glass, and in the lounge they find a tube of cherry-flavoured lip balm. John sets the tiara on her head and slips the lip balm in her bag's front pocket, then says, “Shall we check the back garden, see if you left any faerie dust or hair ribbons?”
“Indeed.” Anahera looks back and forth between Sherlock and John, and smiles. “It sounds like a thoroughly exhausting afternoon, all told. Why don’t you leave these little urchins with us, and go take some time to yourselves?”
“No, no one. I’ve been solicited by my district AMP agency again in the last several months. They keep sending me folders to look at, but I haven’t gone on any dates.”
Once again he was rocked, sung to, and put to bed with the lavender bear, and the next morning Mummy found him still asleep in the cot, lying on top of the stuffed bear. His flushed cheeks and slightly damp curls indicated a long, restful sleep, and it appeared that Sherlock's nocturnal wanderings were over.
Sherlock leans down and kisses him on the forehead, then pulls back and says, “Never fear, John, I fully intend on being in my own bed tonight. I might need help with these barrettes, too.”
“Think back to when we first met. You tried to get me to leave your house. You wanted nothing to do with me. And now you’re talking about all the things you’d like to do with me. Sexually. Some of which you’d probably never considered doing with anyone else. Familiarity, trust, love, wanting to make someone feel good, all that stuff factors in.”
They are swept away by the romance of the legend: Leo, attempting to rescue one of his own, plunges from the heavens and into the sea. Unwilling to sacrifice the kitten clutched in his jaws, but unable to resurface with the extra weight, Leo begins to drown.
“You know how to kiss me, right? Let’s do that, and then, I think, we’ll know. We’ll know how to move forward.”
He glanced over at John as his laughter gave way to a low chuckle, and let the sound die in his throat as he took in the sight next to him. John was sitting up, too, and the light from his bedside lamp had cast his bare chest in a lovely warm glow. His silver-gold hair was mussed from whatever he’d done to it as he got ready for bed, and he was beginning to get circles under his eyes, most likely from the exhaustion setting in after such a long, eventful day.
Sherlock bit his lip again, but he couldn’t keep the laugh down. “You’re ridiculous. And hot. You're ridiculously hot but mostly ridiculous.”
Sherlock sat up on the edge of the bed and yawned. “You should've woken me up. I wasted the whole day.”
He and John made a point of sticking around for a while that afternoon. They cleaned up the kitchen, and Sherlock helped Harry with some research for an upcoming Women’s Studies paper. Mr. Watson watched the game, and John caught the last half-hour of that with him, and they worked on a jigsaw puzzle of hot air balloons that had been sitting on the coffee table since Thanksgiving.
Sherlock pressed his forehead to John’s temple and whispered back. “You were fantastic. I might as well have heard the whole thing, the way you were acting. You had him eating out of your hand.”
“At the passing of her parents, having spent half her life in a colony not her own, Moringa sent word that she wanted to come home. Arrangements were made to meet here, on Cassiopeia, to discuss her intentions.”
Sherlock rested his elbows on the table, crossed his hands under his chin, and waited for the next volley.
John stopped talking and stared over Sherlock’s shoulder. Sherlock could tell that right then, in that moment, John was standing next to that frozen skating pond from their sophomore year of high school.
“The captain took off one glove and put it in the kid's mouth to bite down on so that he wouldn’t cry out, and that’s when the kid started to get hard.”
Sherlock dug his fingers into John’s thighs as John sank down a little more. John took his time, took great care with little rolls of his hips, his thighs flexing as he raised himself up incrementally and lowered himself back down. Sherlock found it hard to look away from John’s face, reading waves of tension and relief in the set of his brow, the flutter of his eyelids. He was beautiful.
Sherlock giggles, and that makes John giggle. They go inside, the telling of their shared lives held in their hands, and close the door behind them. The sun slowly sets, the garden grows dusky and damp, and the honeybee goes back to its hive.
As if reading his mind, John glances over and says, "Don't worry. You'll start any day now. Lots of us haven't started yet."
. I was just noticing that both words mean lightning, and both mean to grasp, or catch. It's almost as if our language were created to name someone
Sherlock clinked his glass to John’s, took a long sip, and set it down on his nightstand. John did the same, then stepped closer. Sherlock knew that if he closed his legs just a few inches they would press against John’s naked thighs, and that was a scenario far too tempting to resist, so he did it. They were warm and as strong and hard as they looked. John responded by resting his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders, sliding them up his neck, and cupping his face. Sherlock looked up and John leaned in for a kiss that turned open and wet from the start.
He felt something soft and leathery flap against the nape of his neck, and then a tiny tug at the curl of hair there. Little pinpricks stabbed into his earlobe, and a bit of fluff went up his nose. The curl-tugging was rather pleasant, but the earlobe-stabbing had to stop, immediately.
Before parting, Sherlock wraps his wings around John and holds him tight. “I love you, Johnling. I love you so much. I didn't think I would be all right with this, but now, with the realization of our dream so close, I feel only great joy and anticipation for what is to come.”
Sherlock didn’t respond. Obviously something was getting in the way of John’s proposal, and Sherlock was frustrated with the situation, but mostly frustrated with himself, because who even was this person who had gone from holding the institution of marriage in such terrific disdain to one who stalked the mailbox and chewed on his fingernails as he waited for a proposal to join said institution?
“Little bit, yeah, ‘cause it's thick at the bridge, thick all the way down. And your neck? Jesus, Sherlock. I admit, when we were kids, you were like this beanpole, with this big head on this skinny little neck, like one of those bobble-head dolls.”
He tried to see himself the way John might, but he knew he couldn’t be that objective. He saw himself as gangly, pale, all pointy joints and sharp bones. He squinted at himself, making his vision go blurry, to see if maybe he could see what John saw. Tall, the messy dark brown curls contrasting nicely against his complexion, a smear of full, pink lips. Long neck, straight shoulders, clean lines, soft curves, and … well, yes, his ass was very full and round and pert, wasn’t it?
Sherlock was fascinated. John was always affectionate and tactile, but his behavior since this morning had been unprecedented. Even now, sitting in a booth across from Greg at Stan’s Donuts, so much of John was so firmly pressed against his side that Sherlock was having a hard time lifting his arm to drink his latte. He put his own donut down and picked his coffee up with his other hand.
“Okay. What is it?” Sherlock couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen John so nervous. He ran his thumb over John’s knuckles and gave his hands a little shake.
“A few. One was curious about a body fluid that was difficult to identify from the photo I posted; the second was a graduate level chemistry question, and the third was some intelligible nonsense about otters and hedgehogs.”
“James, are you sure you can trust your driver? Surely he’d have known if someone else was in his car?”
“No, no, it really couldn't. I would not be able to, Johnling. It would have to be you, but with whom?”
They went through that shoebox and made their piles of photos, and then stacked them all up on the dresser and got back on the bed. John curled around Sherlock, arm over chest and arms, leg over legs, head tucked under chin. His stomach growled. Sherlock laughed.
Sherlock kissed John’s shoulder, and squeezed him tight. John was everything. His man, his tiger, his very own sex test subject. Sherlock wasn’t sure if there was a word for
“Oh! Yes, of course. On the back of the tooth, sir, toward the pointed end, there was a shape, like a snowflake, with six points. It looked as if it had been etched, but there were no grooves at all. It was a slightly different colour, too, quite golden. It was very peculiar.”
“You make me so hard, Sherlock. When I’m with you, when I’m not with you, doesn’t matter. You get me so – fucking – hard.”
“You're mine, Sherlock Holmes. You're a fucking gift, a treasure, and you're mine. I'm going to take you now, and I'm going to keep you, and this is where it ends. No more betrayal, no lies, no leaving, no ploys, no manipulation. I'm going to take you, and have you, as my equal, as a partner, and that's how we'll stay. Not as your lap dog, not as your side kick, not disposable or replaceable or forgettable. Do you understand?”
John had expressed serious doubt that his transcript would be “spotless,” and had reiterated that he’d never be able to afford University of Chicago’s tuition. Sherlock knew better than to suggest that John let someone else pay it—someone like him—at least for now. Still, though, in another year he was going to come into some substantial funds, and would John really say no to some financial help if it meant they could be together? Stubborn ass that he was, he probably would.
He thought he heard the crunch of tires on gravel outside. He closed the closet door and looked around the room. Clean sheets, tossed in the dryer with one of those fabric softener sheets. Extra pillows, plumped. Candles, six of them, assorted sizes and shapes, all of them set in saucers and lit, glowing golden around his tidied room, on his desk, the nightstand, the windowsill, his dresser, the bookshelf.
James met his eye and raised one eyebrow. “That it’s hard to have a personal life, period, in the military.”
That night they ordered dim sum from their favourite takeaway shop, and John broached the topic as he popped the lids off plastic containers and dished up their dinner.
“Did you know that the sweat under your arms and in your groin is thicker than the rest of your body’s sweat? It’s produced by your apocrine glands, instead of your eccrine glands. That’s why.” Sherlock ran his hands around John’s rib cage, and palmed his pecs. He spread his fingers and stroked over the swell of John’s muscles, tracing the lower curves, his thumbs working John’s nipples. “You like it when I do this. You’re aroused by it, and your core temperature is rising. You’re sweating again, aren’t you?”
They pushed back from the table, chairs scraping across the floor, and made their way to the side door. Mrs. Hudson waited while they zipped up, and for Sherlock to grab his bag, then she pulled him down and kissed him on the cheek, and then kissed John, too.
John stared at the scuffed wood planks under his feet and nodded. That was fair. He had given Sherlock no sign that he might be interested, and he had pursued women with a ferocity designed to quell his other, more Sherlock-centric desires. “I’m sorry for that. I should have been more direct with you from the start. It’s just, I was sure you’d reject me, or worse, ask me to move out.”
“Not at all. I was going to ask if you would read it for us.” Sherlock shuffles backward and pulls out the largest pieces of shell from between his feet, and lays them flat on the ice in front of Olive. Olive moves closer to study them, then closer again.
“We are safe again, because of you, Sherlock. Our kind. We are safe. We can bond, we can parade, we can coexist, without fear of our families destroying themselves, without fear of being separated, or alienated, or exiled. We are safe in the arms of our colonies, Sherlock. All I have done is given you an egg. Now, if you will excuse me, I have promised Tui that I would spend the day with her, and only her, and I believe that I hear her calling.”
Sherlock and John, having no patience for plants and no time for a pet at this stage of their lives, had found two armchairs (metal and leather for Sherlock, red upholstery for John) at a used furniture shop and put them in the sunroom over a threadbare rug. Over time, almost a year now, they had added stacks of books, their chemistry and medical journals, and a short, squat table they’d taken from Sherlock’s house to sit between their chairs and hold their cups and plates.
. So I asked if I could look at the book, and I remember that I laughed, because it really was funny, but also out of relief. Do you remember the line?”
“But in reality, I would never have wanted to get together that way, by being forced, or by something as cheesy as a kissing booth.”
Underneath him, John’s breath had evened out. Sherlock lowered himself down to John’s side and wrapped an arm and leg around him. He tucked his nose against John’s neck and took a deep breath. Slowly, the erection that was nudging up against John’s hip settled down and went away. Sherlock was tired. The house was quiet. He closed his eyes and slept next to his husband.
“Okay. I have something for you, but it’s kind of little. The thought behind it, though, is sort of important.”
“Sherlock, I know you said you didn’t like to be touched, but I’d really love to kiss you right now. Can I kiss you?”
Sherlock turned off the water and stepped out onto his bath mat, turbaned one towel around his head and wrapped another around his slim hips. He could do this. The academic part of this study date required no preparation. He’d simply bring his nanomaterials notes with him to Percolate, and a pencil. If John was intent on studying, or if things got awkward, he’d work on his diffraction peaks equations.
John raises his head and blinks at him, smacks his bill together a few times, and slumps against Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock perseveres.
Sherlock noticed that his penis was unable to discern John’s massage voice and his sex voice. They were kind of exactly the same thing, to be fair.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Sherlock said as he rifled through some junk mail for men’s hair growth products and real estate agents. He tossed the men’s flyers in Mycroft’s direction and flounced off to his room. It had been three days, and there was still nothing in the mail for him.
Sherlock stayed on the bed and stared at the ceiling and thought about New York and tried to come up with some new ideas. He wondered if John had started packing yet. He thought about John getting home and dumping everything out on his bed and then repacking his month’s worth of clothes and gifts and souvenirs into his duffel bag and suitcase, maybe shoving his dirty clothes into the bottom under his shoes. Or maybe John would do all that later, after he spent some time with his parents and sister, who must be packing up, too.
Sherlock watched John walk up to the self-serve counter and consider his options. Specifically, he watched John’s ass as John walked up to the self-serve counter. He slipped his phone out of his pocket, opened the camera app, zoomed in, and took his shot. John leaned over a display case of chocolate pudding, lemon meringue pie, and carrot cake.
John bumped shoulders with him and looked up at the stars. “I get it. There’s nothing to do here, and we’re both used to living in busier places. Still, though, it’s beautiful out here isn’t it? So quiet.”
John smiled up at him and Sherlock hunched down for a kiss. “It’s been a great trip. It’s been perfect. I’m ready to go, but I don’t know if I’m ready to go home. It’ll be pretty quiet and dull after being here with you.”
Annette shrugged. “I know you said that I couldn’t help but I was so curious, is all. I’ve heard enough over the last few days to piece together what was happening, and after leaving your place each day I’ve been coming back to the hotel to see what I could figure out. I’d seen this one,” she said, glancing down at Mary, “in the hotel bar with James’ date, so I figured she was the one staying in his room with him. I had no idea what she was up to ‘til today, though.”
“I have not come for an apology, Sherlock. You have done nothing wrong. I have come so that we can support each other. Alone will not protect us.”
Sherlock sighed. “We were such idiots, John. That’s why I pushed you off, because I was afraid you could tell I was getting, you know, hard.”
“It’s a small forest preserve, technically closed for the night, but the parking lot will still be open.”
If Sherlock thought his house would be still and silent after the buzz of Chicago, he’d forgotten about the communicative storm that was Mrs. Hudson. The minute he walked through the front door she was on him, kissing his cheek and helping him line up his bags at the bottom of the stairs. She dragged him into the kitchen, pulled out his chair, filled two cups with coffee, cut an enormous slab of coffee cake for him, and sat down in her own chair.
“Oi. Stop that. Imi is going to be back inside any minute and we're going to have breakfast and act like respectable grandparents, not horny old men. Let go of my dick and get the orange juice out of the fridge.”
Those four words were enough to make Sherlock go from pretty thick to pretty hard. “Yeah, you really are.”
John tugged on Sherlock's balls and gave his cock three tight strokes. “Let’s see if I understand. My body acting on your body, plus the right angle, direction, and velocity, will give us the optimum momentum for fucking you against this wall?”
“Well, I do have a very fancy hair-do, thanks to you. What do we have that could dress Granddad up just a bit?” Sherlock nods his head toward the kitchen where John is straining the pasta and pouring it into a serving bowl.
John smeared more lube on his fingers, and on Sherlock, then ripped the condom wrapper open with his teeth, and spit out the little foil strip he’d torn off. He looked down at Sherlock, spread open below him.
Erebus leads the way, with John at his side. Sherlock falls a step behind, allowing John all of the elder’s attention. He wants John to feel comfortable with Erebus, and to trust him, just as Sherlock does. He wonders, when John remains silent, if he will have to broach the topic himself, but then John begins.
“Of course not.” Sherlock's eyes were stinging. He wrapped his arms around John from behind, and pulled him close. “Go on. Get dressed, and go, and text me later. I’m going to use the bathroom.”
Sherlock winced. Theirs was not a relationship he could relate to in any way whatsoever. “Greg, I don’t know you very well. Well, not at all, really. But you deserve better than that.”
“So tonight I’m changing the rules. Tonight, whatever the white silk touches is where I want you to touch me.”
“Don't even get me started on the way you two look at each other. And really, Sherlock, with that voice of yours, even whispering sounds like a hog trailer bouncing down a gravel road.
Sherlock slipped out the back door again to take care of the milk bottles and the bins. He carried the milk bottles to the front door where the coop’s milkman would pick them up when he dropped off the fresh milk. After that, he went to the barn for the trash bin and rolled that to the road, rubbed his cold hands together, and headed back to the house.
They fall silent, looking at each other, touching each other’s wings. This, Sherlock thinks, this is the reunion. Make this what you have dreamed about, now. Show him.
John’s moans were getting higher, shorter, and his thighs were trembling. Another wave of arousal flooded through Sherlock, and he felt it start, in his belly, in his balls, and he whined in the back of his throat, a questioning sound, and John answered with one of his own. Sherlock dug the fingers of his free hand into John’s hip, rammed himself into John’s mouth, and clamped down on John’s cock. He felt John’s nails dig into his thigh, felt him jerk, and then he was spilling into Sherlock’s mouth, gagging him. He pulled off and managed a short
Sherlock stepped forward, ringing his hands in front of his belly button, wondering if he should make a noise and call attention to himself or just walk to the bed and see what happened. What happened was that John saved him from making a decision by looking up just then and practically dropping the bottle.
There are many like him, and more still coming, working their way out, joining this place. Each scene is identical. One tall, coveting one small, both surrounded by fragments of something previously essential. The larger scene surrounding these dyads is a little more varied, but not by much. He inventories concepts yet unnamed:
Sherlock rolled to the side and curled himself around John's warm body, and John yawned and ran his fingers over Sherlock's arm and shoulder, and
Sherlock didn’t want to wake up. He wanted to sink as far as he could into his bed, sink down with John, limbs tangled, and stay, cocooned, for the rest of time. But he sort of had to pee, too, and that was not compatible with the sinking cocoon fantasy.
When they parted ways James headed back in the direction of Annette’s flat, leaving John and Sherlock standing in front of Victoria’s. John stepped forward and straightened the collar of Sherlock’s jacket, then went up on his toes for a quick kiss.
, he thought. “Once I look at the data on the memory stick and figure out what Bea is hiding, it’ll be a win-win for all of us.”
Sherlock thought long and hard about why John needed to speak with his parents. It didn’t make sense. Only Sherlock would be required for a proposal, unless John planned on marrying all three of them. Sherlock thought about John’s recent silence and of his admission that he’d needed to take care of business. Perhaps that business was with the other person John had been dating? Perhaps he had proposed to
“Well, you know, the things we do. Hands on each other, mouths, bodies moving together, that kind of stuff. There were some stories. I liked those because I could use my imagination and make it more real.”
“We’re in between there and Aberfeldy. We’re at the base of the highlands, which puts us in an ideal location. We’re about a kilometre from the River Tay and not far from Loch Tay. We can go into Perth, too, if you’d like.”
John smirked at him and finished towel drying his hair, then wrapped the towel around his waist and tugged him out of the bathroom. “How do you think I know, gorgeous?”
The battle for the sofa, however, was perhaps the most significant display of the tremors running deep and furious under John's surface.
Sherlock knew a finely honed distraction technique when he saw one, but that didn’t stop him from falling for it. Indeed, he welcomed it with open arms, and John with spread legs, and they hadn’t talked about it again until the next morning. John had been insistent that they let the idea rest for a while and talk about it later, but he had then refused to give a definition of “later” that was measurable in any standard unit of time. Instead, he’d made Sherlock eat something wrapped in a green tortilla.
Hank looked down at Mr. Watson in a way that made it seem as though he were looking up at the Grand Tetons, and said, “No, sir. Not at all. I just didn’t reckon that’d be okay with you. Doesn’t seem like the way you’d raise your son, is all.”
“Oh! John, that’s it! Yes, of course!” Sherlock braced his hands on the sides of the tub and pushed himself up to standing. A small tide of water sloshed over the side of the tub as he stepped out and slid across the tiled floor.
“I don’t know how to do this. You’ll teach me.” He leaned closer, and laid his lips over John’s, and pressed, ever so slightly, and then a bit more.
“Sherlock, I really do want to hear what I should have told him, I do. But let’s get inside, where it’s warm, and we can take off our clothes and I can spread you out naked on that big bed, and we can do all sorts of things to each other, okay?”
John just huffed out an embarrassed sounding laugh and walked around to the other side of the bed. “This should work out well because I always sleep on the left side.”
“Tell me what you just figured out,” John said against his lips. He ran a hand up Sherlock’s arm and to the back of his neck, holding him there, kissing him through and over his words. “I want to know what’s going on.”
“That’s the plan.” Sherlock tried not to think about his birthday, as his and John’s plans had no place on the table between him and his brother. “We haven’t picked an exact date to go back, yet. John goes back to school on the 19th.”
Sherlock snapped to attention and crossed the room in four great strides. “John, can you please disarm the rifle?” he said as he helped Annette to her feet. She had a smear of blood on her lip and a bruise forming under her left eye, and when he laid a steadying hand on her shoulder she flinched.
The trick to thought-challenging is to turn these statements around into something more balanced. We do this by flipping our two statements, erasing the "but" and adding an "and".
"Shh, we're just teasing, pengheart, don't be cross. Come here, let's try this on for size." Anahera winks at Tui, and Tui smiles back.
Sherlock poked at his food while Mummy scanned what she could see of him above the surface of the table, her critical glare missing not one thing. “You look so good, Sherlock, so healthy. You're sleeping almost regularly, and eating, aren't you?”
Sherlock slinked back down the hallway and up the stairs. Dammit if he didn't feel like a five-year-old caught with his hand stuck in the cookie jar.
Sherlock opens his mouth to deduce that the armchair John is sitting in used to be owned by a Peruvian llama farmer when John leans toward Sherlock’s chair, grabs his suit jacket lapels, and says, “Deduce this, you mad git,” and kisses him soundly on those brilliant lips.
People in Chicago love to argue about who has the best deep dish pizza. According to Uno, they invented it. All I know is that it sits in your gut like a bowling bowl, but I guess that's good if you need to fuel shoveling three feet of snow.
“We aren't sea urchins, Tui, we’re pengs! The biggest in the world! The fastest, the fiercest, the –”
They drove on, meandering their way through the rest of Wilmette, and then Evanston. The route through Evanston took them past Northwestern University, with its open lawns, Shakespearean garden, and combination of Norman Gothic, Italian Renaissance, and modern steel architecture. As they rounded the south end of the campus, Lake Michigan came into view, boundless and blue under a calm sky. South of the campus, Sheridan Road began to boast long rows of Victorian, Queen Anne, prairie, and arts and crafts mansions, some painted in pastels, others built of hearty Indiana sandstone.
Sherlock hugged John close to him and kissed his forehead. “Not bad. I’ve been concentrating on the dynamics of our bodies in motion, and ideal angles in consideration of our heights and weights.”
“Oh, I don’t know! It was far easier for me to tell you that I had no need for emotions of that nature, or for intimacy, than to face your rejection of
He instinctively wrapped his arms around John, who had collapsed heavily on top of him, and stroked his back, his shoulders, his hair. John pressed his mouth to Sherlock's neck and licked at the sweat there, whispered, “Magnificent,” and fell silent again. Sherlock took a moment to index and catalogue the new environment surrounding them, paying special attention to the altered states of their bodies: heart rate, perspiration, respiration, muscle strain, fatigue.
John pulled the silver pitcher down the length of the steam wand, gently aerating the milk. The initial banshee screech was subsumed by a rich gurgling, all of which lasted eight seconds as the foam began to rise and then John set it, carefully, back onto the grate of the drip tray while he pulled the espresso shots.
“All right. Thanks, Holmes.” Lestrade coached the team on plays for the second half, and Sherlock stood to the side, trying not to stare at Watson’s thighs. Padded as they were, it was hard to accurately estimate circumference and muscle mass, but based on what he’d seen in the gym earlier that day, John had been taking his workouts to the next level.
“Maybe going to bed at a reasonable hour might help? Instead of staying up until all hours studying? Or spending less time in the morgue, maybe?”
"Not at all, don't be silly. I'll be downstairs if you need anything, all right? I know Sherlock isn't always the best caregiver, with him being so cerebral and in his mind palace all the time and all."
“We have asked for the right to partake in the same freedoms that all other pengs enjoy, freedoms that should have been ours all along. The right to bond with anyone we choose exists as one of the most personal freedoms I can imagine, and we had to involve the High Council to ensure us that right.
And that's how far he'd fallen, he thought to himself. That's how far. He couldn't even come up with a proper criticism or scathing put-down of these half-crazed otter aficionados.
“I was. I didn't get rid of anything of yours, but I went through just about every other room in the house and purged all the years of accumulated crap.”
to be missing, lost, to be hidden, out of sight, covered, disappeared, absent, secretly, hidden, undetected, unnoticed
“Okay. I’ll put that on the definite list. What about restaurants? Do we need to make reservations?”
Sherlock watched his man head in the direction of the concession stand, then turned back and watched the Zamboni do its thing. The sun had just gone down and the outdoor lights were coming on. Sherlock didn’t have to look at his watch to know that it was coming up on 5:00. He wondered what John had planned next, and if they’d have time to head back to The Willows before dinner.
“Of course.” Sherlock licked at John's mouth one more time, then propped himself up on his elbows and looked down at him. John was gold and blue and pink against the white of the pillow.
Then, she tells Sherlock, Maryle invited John out for a walk on their own, which precious Johnling had politely declined. But
Erebus’ eyes shine. “It would be my honour, Siger, to support the new rulings in any way I can. I will do it for Pobeda, and for Selvic. It would make him proud.”
Mrs. Hudson served up the cake and hot chocolate for her boys, and took her own mug and dish with her into her bedroom. Sherlock was relieved. Had all three of them sat down together, John might’ve started asking her questions about Mycroft, too, and Sherlock had had enough of that conversation to last quite a while.
There was nothing for it, Sherlock thought. He knew how he’d be most comfortable, and if John was sincere in his wish that Sherlock be comfortable, then John wouldn’t mind. He stood up and pulled on the pyjama bottoms, then slipped the long sleeve shirt over his head, adjusted the seams to rest on his shoulders, and tugged the cuffs down. John must have been much better at observing than Sherlock had given him credit for because the fit of both items was perfect. He looked down at his feet, where the bottoms pooled gently along the high arch of his foot, and he looked at his hands, where his sleeves fell to just below his wrists. Lastly, he slipped the robe on, tied the sash, and left the bathroom so that John could have his turn.
John hummed, an appreciative, content sound. Sherlock glanced up at him again, a movement that repositioned his lips so that only the lower one was in contact with John. Staring up at him, Sherlock held John’s cock in his hand and rubbed the head of it over that swollen lower lip, back and forth, again and again, as if adorning and preparing his mouth for making love to John. John sighed and settled his head into the crook of his arm.
John nudged his forehead against Sherlock's cheek, and Sherlock turned to find John's mouth waiting for him. The kiss was wide open, all tongue, aggressive, wet. They were breathless now, panting their way through the song’s crescendo, hands sliding and seeking. It was good. It was so, so good.

He allowed himself a minute. He let it bubble up, all of it; the sadness, the guilt, the anger, the emptiness, the shame, the dread, all of it, and then he packed it up, and replaced it with the happiness he'd found with John. John, who intended to stay. John, whose love filled him up, buoyed him, kept him afloat.
Sherlock took the phone back and studied them. It was true. He and his niece did look like his mother. It wasn’t just the girl’s hair and the color of her eyes, but something in her smile that mirrored his mother’s quick laugh, her light touch, her ability to connect.
Kevin and Greg arrived at the table in a rush of cold air and chatter, and when Mycroft stood to shake Kevin’s hand, Kevin swept him up into a hug and slapped him on the back.
“Yes, maybe. Maybe that's part of it. And whereas I always feel close to you after we're together, and what we just did was one of the most amazing sexual experiences we've had—at least it was for me—it doesn't change the fundamental bond between us, or what I feel for you, because we were already there. Does that make sense?”
Dinner proceeded from there without a hitch. They had attentive, if overly flirtatious service, delicious, bacony brussel sprouts, and three cocktails each. Sherlock made hilarious, yet accurate observations about the men around them, and unbeknownst to them, the men seated nearby made several assumptions about them, most of them incorrect.
Erebus does not speak at first, and the silence stretches long and soft under the star-bright sky. When he does speak, his voice is cracked, dry.
“Ah, yes. Well, my dear child, we certainly do hope that you each find your match and that you enjoy each other for the rest of your time here on earth. It could happen, however, that one of you will survive the other by many years. We live in a very harsh environment, as you will have realized by now. We endure the coldest temperatures known to penguinkind, we swim in the most hostile waters, and we risk all manner of threat and hardship to feed our young. Unfortunately, every year, some of us do not return home from the winter feeds. Some of us will not make the migration after the summer hunts, either.
In the evening, "God, you're such an idiot!" meant that John wasn't undoing his flies fast enough, and that Sherlock was about to quite literally take things into his own hands.
“Ah. Well. You have to understand, Sarah, that the year before that, when we were seniors in high school, I had found myself in the unfortunate situation of falling madly in love with my best friend, and thinking that there was no way he could ever feel the same way about me.”
John flipped over again, and jostled around until his cock was a few inches from Sherlock's mouth, making it easy for Sherlock to lean in and press his nose into John’s pelvis. He took a deep breath, then used his tongue to draw John’s plump cock between his lips and into his mouth. He felt John’s hand wrap around the base of his erection, and his tongue lick up the shaft, again, and again, teasing him.
Sherlock took a deep breath, ducked under, and started counting. He couldn't outcount this, but still, he stayed submerged. He pushed his arms through the resistance of the water, forcing his descent, and looked up toward the overhang. John stood at the edge, a rippling mirage in faded jeans and a red polo, hands framing his hips. Sherlock let a few bubbles escape.
The May evening was clear and dry, the sky above dotted with orphaned wisps of clouds, the grass below them fragrant like cut hay. The music was fine, but what Sherlock enjoyed the most was the people watching. Here, on his own blanket island with a rapt audience of one, Sherlock could deduce to his heart’s content and be told he was brilliant. And if Sugarhill Gang played in the background, so be it.
It is not until he sees Tui approach that Sherlock understands that the weight of his own sadness might add to her grief. Her shoulders are bowed, and her eyes are dull. She looks only half herself without Anahera by her side. He becomes more aware of himself as he observes her, noticing how hard John has worked to keep him groomed, and warm, and safe. He pulls himself up to his full height, and takes the first steps he has taken in days. His body feels stiff, and heavy, and if he weren’t trying so hard for Tui, he would feel even worse for having let himself drift so far away, from himself, from John, from the colony.
Erebus stops now, and sighs. He looks out over the rippling water and scans the neverending sky. “We’ll be leaving soon, young Sherlock. Perhaps I should save the rest for another time?”
John nodded again and held up a finger. From behind Sherlock, their server appeared, balancing a tray on one hand.
“And is the footage kept on site or farmed out to a different company?” Sherlock asked, striding confidently across the room towards the front counter.
Sherlock shakes his head in defeat and moves to look out the back door. It's a gorgeous day, bright and blue and dry, and the garden is standing full and lush, an explosion of colour and texture. "Imogen," Sherlock says, "Granddad's flower looks lonely now, doesn't it? Why don't you run out to the garden and pick some fresh flowers to keep it company?”
John opened the door a minute later and smiled at Sherlock, and Sherlock smiled back, a sleepy, dozy smile. John’s face was flushed and his hair was mussed—had he been pulling on it as he touched himself, or had he run his hand through it when he was done? Sherlock held the covers up as John climbed into bed, then lowered them back down. John wrapped Sherlock tight in his arms, kissed the top of his head, and hummed.
Sherlock grunted and drove them on, fucking into John, taking him. This was what it was like, he thought, this was the other side, the exaltation of bringing someone such powerful pleasure, not with your hands, not with your mouth, but with your cock. His whole body sung, but his cock screamed.
Sherlock felt John's weight press down the slightest bit, felt his glans begin to breach John. He bit his lip. He watched John's face.
“It’s mine. I mean, it’s based on mine. But in miniature. Obviously. Molly said I should give you something that represents what you mean to me, or something that you would value, and I thought this would meet both those criteria. You could wear it with your others, if you want, or not at all. It’s really meant to be more of a symbolic gesture. It’s up to you. John?”
John ran his fingers through his hair, pulled just enough to release the stress that Sherlock unconsciously stores there, each shaft tingling with the slight stretch and release. Sherlock planted one kiss to the bulge near his lips, took a deep breath, and fell asleep.
When Sherlock lifted his head just out of reach, John followed, tilting his pelvis up in search of those curls. Sherlock turned his head to the side and wrapped John in the thick hair behind his ear, then in the bangs across his forehead, and down the other side.
The second time they woke, it was to the sound of the housekeeper’s vacuum bumping up and down the hallway outside their room. Sherlock pulled a pillow over his head, and John mumbled something about the crime of driving a vacuum cleaner without a license. They fell asleep again.
“It went well. There are so many I don't remember, especially of me and John from when we were really young. But of course, I wouldn’t remember most of those.”
“We're going to start like this first, alright?” Sherlock covered himself in lube while he explained. “You're going to take control of how you take me, how much, how fast. You're going to stop if it hurts too much or if you don't like it, okay?”
Erebus bumps to his belly and toboggans down the snowdrift, calling hello to John as they pass each other.
They did the closing moves over and over again, until they were both sweating and breathing hard, and at the end of La Cumparsita's last refrain John took full control, pulling Sherlock into a chest-to-chest apilado embrace, then pushing away into a slide. He stepped back into a wide-foot stance with one leg at the diagonal, and Sherlock ended the dance with a high leg wrap, his groin and inner thigh hugging John's hip, and the length of his calf pressed to the side of John's thigh. He slowly slid his leg down the length of John's, and then they stood, swaying, until eventually they were standing still, pressed together, unaware of the other dancers arranged in a circle, watching them.
“He’s been much like this,” John answers. “He sleeps a lot, but he’s in good spirits, and very vested in caring for the egg. I knew he wouldn’t ask, so I asked him to hold her now and then so I could stretch and walk around, and he was delighted to do so.”
John shook his head. “I have no idea, but I’m willing to do it. I’d like to think that even if someone harassed us, someone else would stand up for us. And maybe that’s what the world needs, right? More people just being themselves and not apologizing for it. More couples doing what straight couples get to do in public all the time. Maybe that would help normalize it.”
God, what was wrong with him? This was worse than blurting out people’s deepest darkest secrets. This was him turning into a brainless ninny, a lust-induced, selfless fool using his body to pray to the altar of John Watson. He needed to get a grip. He took a shot at sounding normal.
In the end, it was John who woke Sherlock, slipping his hand into Sherlock's pajama bottoms, tickling through his pubic hair, cupping his balls, stroking his inner thigh.
They fell silent then, slipping into a light doze, then a deep sleep, with their hands clasped together and pressed between their chests.
“No. I’d never even thought about it. But then once I saw it all, I couldn’t unsee it, and then, I couldn’t stand it. It was like it’d been secretly holding me back.”
“There’s very little not covered, you gorgeous man.” John stepped forward and stood in front of Sherlock, put his hands on his shoulders. “But what about your mouth? That’s not covered.”
Sheridan Road swung to the east again, and for a short stretch they found themselves bordered by the lake on one side, and a vast Victorian graveyard on the other. After curving around the graveyard, they made another left turn, and Evanston was behind them. They were in Chicago.
John flopped back on a small futon and patted the seat next to him. “Sounds good. It’s almost five o’clock. Think we’ll be done soon?”
“Are you kidding? I wouldn’t be caught in that house for fame or money right now.” John gave Sarah a hug and stepped back.
Later, wrapped in each other, wrapped in blanket, John held Sherlock tight and played with his hair and murmured sweet everythings in his ear. “You’re gorgeous, you’re mine, you’re my life, and I love you, okay?"
Siger raises his gaze from the tooth to his son’s face, then lifts his wing and touches it to Sherlock's cheek. It is a gesture so unexpected, so tender, that for a moment Sherlock forgets why they're there.
Sherlock picked at his pumpkin pie and sipped his coffee, and tried to listen to Mrs. Hudson on his left, and still catch bits of conversation between John and Sarah across the coffee table and to his right.
“So, you’re incredibly smart, and super busy, and fucking gorgeous. I guess I’m kind of wondering why you’re here with me?”
. So, he tells them he’ll let them in if they let him buy them a drink, meet up with him later, that kind of thing.”
“I wanted it to be special. Not just my same old room with the same old stuff. Not just, I don’t know. Regular.”
Everyone turns and looks at Mycroft now. Sherlock must admit, he’s rather intimidating when he wants to be, and the roar he just let out was enough to startle an elephant seal.
This was everything, and Sherlock was going to come if he couldn’t get control of himself. He tried to focus on John, on how John was feeling, on what John needed, but it was hard to ignore the way his cock was throbbing against the crush of John’s body as he slid inside for the first time.
“Anahera. Thank you. I cannot believe we haven’t properly thanked you yet. Please, let us do so now.
He gave one final push toward Sherlock’s mouth and froze, his body taut and vibrating like a violin string under Sherlock’s constant, expert tuning to John’s responses. Sherlock slid the tip of that one finger into John’s body, just enough to breach him, and John, with one last stunned-sounding “Oh!” spurted his orgasm into the heat of Sherlock’s mouth.
“I see. Right. So, before I can even begin to process any of that, I need to know what you were thinking. Why did you do this?”
John looked at Sherlock in complete horror, his mouth falling open and his eyes going wide. “No!” he mouthed.
“It’s late, no one will see.” He pushed John’s coat up and undid his button-fly, spread the two sides apart, and buried his face in John’s crotch.
John kissed Sherlock's collarbone and groaned. “Are we going to talk about inches again? How long until the streets are cleared, do you think?”
Sherlock had vibrated with unresolved energy, climbing up and out of the pit, cannonballing back in, over and over, while John floated, arms and legs spread, his eyes never leaving Sherlock as he jumped, swam, climbed, jumped, swam, climbed.
Sherlock worried at the hem of his sheet and took a sip of his tea, then set the cup down in its saucer and pushed it away from him. “But can you honestly say that you wouldn’t have liked that, spending your nights beside me?”
John’s voice had gotten softer as he spoke. He stroked Sherlock’s arm absentmindedly, up and down, up and down, lost in the story he was telling.
“It was on page seven. You and John will enter from opposite ends of the veranda and meet at the start of the aisle. You’ll be preceded by two flower girls and two ring bearers. When you get to the top of the aisle you’ll stop and face each other. The bishop will guide you from there. Clear?”
Sherlock rolls to the side and grabs a handful of tissues from a box on the floor. The cleanup is quick and efficient, almost an afterthought. Sherlock pulls John tight against him, settles the duvet around them as John tucks his head under Sherlock's chin and draws circles on his chest. Sleep comes easier these days.
The festivities commenced and Sherlock found himself standing next to John at the head of a long receiving line. He had no idea how he was expected to greet, smile at, and speak to over three hundred people, almost none of whom he knew, so he eliminated the smiling part first, then shortened the greeting part, and eventually settled for various iterations of, “Meet my husband, John Watson. John, meet someone my parents know.” Mummy was not amused but Sherlock did not care. He had found someone who wanted to be with him and that person wasn’t any of the people waiting to shake his hand.
Sherlock meets with Siger, Erebus, Mycroft, Vela, and Pavo again a few days later. This time, Olive joins them. The first issue they discuss is who will accompany Vela, Pavo, Moringa, and the heartstone to the Shelf.
“So you think he’s trying to tease out more information from James about what happened that day?” John asked as they got ready for bed. “Maybe information specific to his brother?”
Lestrade told them to have fun, walked into the throng of people gathered at the nearest bar, and disappeared.
“I feel like there was a storm in my head, but I didn’t realize it until everything got so quiet. It feels quiet now.”
Sherlock walked around the makeshift dance floor and headed toward the dining room. John was chewing the last of his egg roll, but put his still-pretty-full plate down and wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s waist.
“Mike is a friend, someone I studied with at Bart’s Hospital before I went to Afghanistan. I ran into him in the park when I got back and we had coffee. He’s actually the one who helped me get going with the Programme application. I wasn’t going to do it but he was quite encouraging and helpful. James Sholto was my commanding officer. We were quite close for a while. I’ll text you their names and addresses right now.”
John lay in Sherlock’s arms, his head on his shoulder, one leg tossed between Sherlock’s. Sherlock ran his fingers up and down John’s back, and over the arm John had wrapped around Sherlock’s waist.
“Do you believe you would be able to teach this skill to other pengs? Perhaps other pengsitters, and parents?”
“I must say, I am impressed. I guess what they say is true about Ginger Rogers doing everything Fred Astaire did, but backward and in heels. You’re doing a fine job in her position.”
“Where else would I be, you insufferable dick?” John whispers back, lifting Sherlock's hand to his mouth and kissing his knuckles. “Where else?”
Eight hours later John and Sherlock ended their date chuckling over dinner and a bottle of wine at Angelo’s Ristorante. They reviewed their adventure: several forced suicides, a pink suitcase, part of a named scratched into the bare wood floor of an abandoned building, and a cranky cab driver with a fatal bullet through his shoulder.
“Yes. And you’re right, I do have certain expectations. I just don’t think you’re right about what they are. So why don’t you go get cleaned up and I’ll get your wedding present, okay?”
“Yes. Wow. They’re really growing up. Well, not growing up. They’re still young. Little.” Sherlock nodded as if he’d just said something profound. John kicked him again. “Um, do you have any pictures of them?”
John slammed a drawer shut and stalked over to Sherlock, insinuating himself well inside Sherlock's personal space, which was normally preferred, but now a little bit intimidating.
“Yeah, I'm fine. I like this, being here with you, doing regular things with you. I like standing in the kitchen, drinking out of the same container, knowing how much butter we each like. No one at school knows how much butter I like or that I prefer whole milk over skim, or that I like the way Tide smells, or which way I angle my pillow when I go to sleep.”
Vela nods sympathetically, as this is an insecurity shared by young penguins everywhere. “Well, first, I want you to know that this rarely ever happens, especially for first time courtships. It does sometimes happen that we have more females than males, or vice versa, but most of the time the eligible population is evenly matched. Some penguins may choose not to mate, which could also alter the potential pool of mates, but again, this is rare. If a call goes unanswered, we encourage you to consider that it simply was not your time yet, or not your mate's time, and to wait patiently for the next season. I, personally, have never known of a situation where a desirous penguin was not bonded within two seasons.”
“No, you go up and get changed. I’m dying to see you in the g-string. I’ve been thinking about it all day.”
"John, I am so sorry to keep you waiting. I had a private ballet lesson in the smaller studio, and didn't allow myself enough time to prepare for you. I must apologize for my appalling state, as well. I'd rather you hadn't seen me like ... this." He gestured to himself and patted the towel against his face and neck. "I would completely understand if you would rather reschedule tonight's lesson for a time when I am less ... like this."
”It doesn’t change what happened, Mycroft. They left the party because I was sick. You called them because I was sick.”
James didn’t look at Sherlock as he spoke. He’d set his sights somewhere in the field stretching out to the forest behind the house. He cleared his throat and recrossed his legs.
He closed his eyes and revisited the sensations again. John’s tongue swirling, John humming, John looking up at Sherlock and winking as his head bobbed and bobbed and bobbed. John’s fingers smoothing, stroking, exploring. The tip of John’s finger tracing that delicate seam, John sliding his hand under Sherlock’s arse, palm up, his thumb sliding between Sherlock’s cheeks, seeking.
John giggles and nods. “I do! And you said I was ridiculous, and you said it like being ridiculous was the very best thing in the world. And I thought, I will be all kinds of ridiculous for this peng, for as long as he’ll let me.”
He set the kitchen table and opened a bottle of wine, then sat down with a glass and waited for their dinner to heat up in the AGA. He was still feeding his intellect, of course. That would never stop. But now, with the additional experience of loving and being loved, of being responsible to someone else and allowing that person to be responsible for him, Sherlock better understood the power of his emotions. Now, he let them tamp and balance his intellect. It was one thing to know that the shopkeeper was having an affair with his accountant, it was an altogether different thing to destroy the shopkeeper’s wife’s life by telling her. Sherlock no longer let his intellect run roughshod over emotional engagement. By fully experiencing his feelings for another person, for John, his intellect was more likely to stay put when necessary.
“Coffee’s in the kitchen. Go grab a cup if you want.” Greg gestured over his shoulder with his free hand, then settled back against the cushions and against Kevin’s arm.
It's Thanksgiving week here in the U.S., and that means my kids only have two measly days of school, and then on Thursday we'll all be eating fifty-seven pounds of food, and then Friday we'll all be in pumpkin pie comas. I am going to do my very best to keep this on schedule, and get the next chapter up on Monday.
“Yeah, I know. Listen, Sherlock,” John said, pulling back enough to meet his eye. “If you pull that shit again, shutting me out, I’ll drive this piece of shit to Cambridge and beat the crap out of you.”
“She intercepted me, right here, at this very spot – I was coming to look for you, you see, and she stopped me, and she said that it was urgent that she talk to me, that she set things right, because she needed to explain why she had done the things she'd done, why she had pursued me, even when she knew that I was with you, even that first summer, on Cassiopeia, all those times she tried to manipulate me, like the time she tried to stay behind and find a place on the Junior Council, do you remember that? And you talked to Erebus, and he intervened, and sent her on her way –”
Anahera seems so proud of herself, and Sherlock feels a wave of humility and self-consciousness wash over him. He stands by John’s side, and tugs on his wing, until John finally looks up from that distant hatchling shore on which he’s been so focussed.
headbutts the interior walls, wriggles her head through the crumbling hole, and shakes herself into awareness of the outside world.
In the box lay several neatly folded and wrapped bundles that looked to be articles of clothing, at least half-a-dozen, from what Sherlock could gather. Upon further inspection, he found that they were all the same fabric, white silk, and appeared to be of the utmost quality.
“I thank you both for presenting to us today. It has been most informative, and extremely interesting. You have taken great risks travelling for so long, so far from home, but were right to come. You have kept safe and delivered a piece of emperor history previously thought lost to the ages. You have presented a compelling personal narrative, and proposed several significant matters for our consideration.
“I’m sure we’ll be there for a good part of it, unless we decide to go somewhere. You never know, we might become world travelers. I’ve always wanted to go to London.”
Sherlock watched Laffitte walk back to the table with a tumbler in one hand and a shot glass in the other. He turned his head toward Greg, but didn’t take his eyes off the screen. “I would do anything for John, and he would do anything for me. He’s more than my … my boyfriend. Boyfriend sounds grossly inadequate for what John is to me.”
He was still swiping through his phone when he heard someone say, “Welcome to Percolate, what can I get you this morning?”
“God, fuck,” John swore, reaching with one hand to turn off the floor lamp. “Off, everything off, right now.”
Annette greeted them when they arrived at the house, ushering them in with warm hugs and huge grins. “Come on then, come and see what we’ve done to the place,” she urged, reaching to help with their bags. “Here, put those near the stairs and I’ll put the kettle on.”
It was John’s turn to shrug. His fingers were making sloppy circles over Sherlock’s lower back. “For me, it’s more about the act than the taste. I don’t have to, though, if it bothers you.”
Sherlock’s hand was splayed over John’s chest, and he wanted very badly to tease John’s nipple. That would defeat his objective, though, which, for once, had nothing to do with having sex with his man. He ran his hand down John’s arm, instead, and encircled his wrist with his fingers.
Mummy asked questions, John answered, and tea was served. Sherlock stared at them over the rim of his fine bone china cup as they talked.
Kolachy is the word Chicagoans use for this type of cookie, which is a buttery pastry with jam or preserves inside. You can find different spellings and origins all over the internet. Here, they’re Polish.
Sherlock practically threw the lube onto the counter and started pulling loose bills out of his coat pocket. The woman with the pink hair smiled at him and came over to ring him up.
“John. Eat these french fries in order from least to most ketchup, then tell me which one you like best.”
Sherlock’s orgasm raced forward, prolonged by John’s body clenching around him, claiming and clutching him. The effect of it left him blinded with pleasure, unaware of his body except for where it was joined with John’s.
“Come here.” John had his hand inside Sherlock’s underwear before Sherlock could say ‘nine,’ and holy mother of God if that wasn’t the best thing he’d felt since, well, since the last time John had had his hand down Sherlock’s pants. He wasn’t going to take long. John was right, they didn’t need anything more involved right now, not wound up as they were. They needed release. He slipped his hand inside John’s undone jeans, and a minute later, whining for breath, Sherlock pulled John down to sitting on the edge of the bed, angled their spread thighs toward each other, and smeared their mouths together, too close to coming to kiss.
I don't view the comments field as a place for a critical review. If I've misspelled something, or made a grammatical mistake, or if something doesn't make sense, I would love to know. But if you don't like my writing style, or my story, or the way I'm telling it, just move on. Writing fan fiction is a labor of love, and I want to surround myself with people who appreciate and enjoy what I offer.
Sherlock is sure that they are going to send Mycroft back to the Shelf, and he is equally sure that Mycroft is not ready to go. He is also sure that
Now, John rolled onto his side, told Sherlock to lie down on his back, and then climbed on top of him.
John rolled onto his back and ran his fingers through his hair. He scratched at his chest with his other hand and squinted up at Sherlock. “Is that what you wanted to tell me? Because I’m fairly confused, to be honest.”
“Our shared location hardly assures us a shared experience, though. After all, I have something you do not.”
Sherlock is pleased. These are compassionate, open-minded emperors. It will do no harm for the High Council to see highly respected members of the Rūnanga colony showing support for their cause, especially as one of them is a High Council member’s sister, and another is her niece.
Sherlock slid his hand off John and curled it against his own chest. “I loved it. I apologise, though. I was excited and I opened my mouth before I stopped to think. Now you’ll be left unsatisfied.”
John disappeared upstairs and Sherlock went to the kitchen to put his boots and coat back on. Harry was in the pantry, whispering to someone on her phone. He knocked on the door, pulled it open, and waved.
John bit his lower lip and clenched Sherlock’s thighs, hard. Sherlock’s eyes fell shut as his mouth fell open, unable to stop a ghost of an
Sherlock doesn’t know what to say to this. He has already decided that he must be with John, forever, no matter what, but he hasn’t thought ahead to the calling, and doesn't know if it’s possible to choose a mate without the calling, or if it’s possible for two male emperors to be together.
When Sherlock picks up the story again, it is to tell his father that he snuck away from the crèche, and spent the night trying to figure out where Moringa had been when she fell, and what she had been doing there. He loses himself in the recalled images and descriptions of the ice cave, and the realization that there was nothing there, nothing to find. He only pauses when he tells his father that no matter what the tooth may be able to do, he doesn't need it, because he has John, and if he has John, he can do anything.
With one last, slow drag over Sherlock's lower lip, John rocked back on his heels, straightened his coat, and winked. “Happy birthday. Again.”
“John, even if I sold it to him at fair market value and didn’t give him a deal, it would only be about sixteen acres a year.”
John rolled his hips, keeping his eyes on Sherlock’s face as he pushed inside, inch by inch. Sherlock bit his lower lip and made small humming sounds, and when John grunted through his last thrust, and was fully inside, Sherlock’s mouth made that perfect “O” shape, then he smiled, and whispered, “Perfect. That's perfect.”
“Well, partly. Mostly, it was because you were fucking hot when you were practicing in those little shorts, and playing in those tight pants, and strutting around school in this jacket. John, I can’t stand football.”
Sherlock released John’s hands and reached under him, finding his cock with one hand and his balls with the other. With his arms under John he found he had more leverage to rut, and so he did, hard and fast, fondling John as he drove into him. As Sherlock got closer he found himself completely, utterly infused with his feelings for John. There was nothing else but this connection, this most heightened intimacy between them. The sweetness of his approaching climax fed into the flooding of his heart, and that in turn brought him even closer. “John, oh, John—”
“Done already?” John murmured, nudging the cup away from him so that it wouldn’t spoil the surprise.
He went to his bed that night feeling unsettled, not unlike the sensation he got in his stomach when sailing, just when the boat sat at the highest peak of a wave before plunging down to slap against the surface.
“It's a necessary sacrifice. If the drones don't leave, the entire bee community will suffer. Without enough honey to make it through the winter, other bees, more important bees, will die.”
“Mmm.” John took a big bite of the carrot cake and nodded. “I’ll be an expert in Sherlockian anatomy.”
He felt John's hand slide up his arm and into the curls at the nape of his neck, the other one slipping from waist to hip. How interesting that John and I have been pressed together so many times while we've danced, and yet this, this is so much more. It was just half a thought, not fully formed, and then that gave way to the fractured notion of having arrived as John brought his lips to the corner of Sherlock's mouth and brushed back and forth, tiny little caresses charged with sensation.
“I’m not going anywhere, you know. I was disappointed, and I’m sure it’ll happen again, just like you’ll be disappointed in me sometimes. That’s life. But I’m not leaving, Sherlock, I’m not saying well, that’s done, then. Can’t imagine I’ll ever say that.”
Sherlock flung the covers back just as Tiny Bat John re-latched himself around Sherlock's now exposed cock, and try as he might, which was not at all, once the little bat began suckling at the tip, Sherlock couldn't stop him. The bat was moaning and squeaking and lapping up the leaking fluid, and his wings were stroking and squeezing, and his belly was pressing his bat boner into Sherlock's frenulum. Sherlock grabbed handfuls of blanket and trembled. Sweat trickled down his neck.
He had to take a moment to allow all of his insubordinate body parts to collectively shudder and twitch, and then he was there, one long index finger hooking under the waistband and lifting it up and over the bounty of Watson cock hidden underneath.
Sherlock checked in while John grabbed freshly baked chocolate chip cookies off the plate on the reception desk and rifled through a rack of brochures. He passed a cookie to Sherlock in the elevator, and said, “This hotel has free cookies. I love this hotel.”
“Cetus is very wise, Anahera. I trust in what he says. Do you need help gathering food for her, or anything at all?”
John closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “Sshhh. It's tempting, but we're going to follow the rules and save it all up for tonight.”
Sherlock lowers his mouth to John’s ear and lifts his other hand in front of them. He points. “Right … there. Watch.”
“I'm okay with that,” John said, holding onto Sherlock's arm for balance as he pulled off his socks.
Sherlock sat back on his heels and rested his hand on John's upper thigh. “John, you're just like me, but... better.”
Sherlock stares. He holds his teacup and saucer over the table, not looking at his aim, and hears a clatter and splash when he let’s go.
Sherlock and John stare down at the precious stone sitting on the ice in front of them. They stare at it, and then Sherlock looks up at John, and sees that John’s face is bathed in soft pink and ruby and violet, the result of the late afternoon sun casting out its rays, hugging the stone and spreading its light.
She looked at their hands, just a glance, not even long enough to blink, and put the pancakes on the table.
John interrupted halfway through Paul’s description of a cashew-lime puree and said, “Perhaps we could place an order for cocktails before we order our dinners?” He had that closed-mouth-smile and raised eyebrows expression on his face, and Sherlock knew what that meant, and it never meant anything good.
Now though, he focuses on the weight against his chest. Each day it gets heavier. Each day it seems to cling tighter to him, as if sinking right into his heart. He is not entirely certain anymore where he starts and the tooth ends. Is this what it was like for Pōrangi?
The third time they woke up, it was because John had to use the bathroom again. Sherlock stretched his arm across the warm spot John had vacated, and rolled onto his stomach, spreading himself out wide, limbs reaching to the four corners of the bed like a Sherlock-compass seeking John. Sherlock's north shuffled back to the side of the bed, flipped the covers back, and settled himself squarely over Sherlock’s back.
“I’m glad we’re doing this,” John said. “I really do want to thank you for helping Molly. It’s good of you.”
“Good lord. Our first Christmas party, remember? With Lestrade and Molly and Mrs Hudson? That must've been the year we met.”
Erebus, quiet until now, nods and stops walking. He waits for Sherlock to catch up, then says, “I appreciate your condolences very much, John. I can tell that you are a very caring young peng, and that you are struggling with what you perceive to be the injustice of my earlier life circumstances.”
Sherlock wrapped his arms around John from behind, and kissed the back of his neck. He could feel John’s body throwing off heat, and the rise and fall of his chest under his hands. He started unbuttoning John’s shirt, and when the first few buttons were undone, he kissed lower down his neck, and across the top of his shoulder.
Sherlock was up and out of bed before the door was fully open. He crossed the room in three long strides, grabbed the edge of the door in one hand, the collar of John's jacket in the other, and yanked him inside.
“Not important? The seal tooth that we’ve been obsessing over for the last several days is not important? The one that Moringa stole from us, and we stole back, and have been protecting with our very lives, is not important?”
Sherlock let the hot water soak through his bedhead curls and stream down his shoulders and back. He smiled as he sudsed up, thinking about spending this day with John. It would be the first of either of their birthdays spent together since they’d become more than friends. John’s birthday was March 31, and although Sherlock was looking forward to spring break, he was disappointed that the week of vacation would fall two weeks earlier than John’s birthday.
“To Percolate. After you buy ten drinks, you get one for free. It’s a … Percolate perk, or at least that’s what I’m supposed to say. It’s basically a loyalty card.”
Sarah set down her tray and shopping bag, hung her purse and coat over the back of the chair, and sat down.
“I did bring it upstairs, but your glass was empty, and you were half-asleep. I put the medicine on the nightstand and went to the bathroom to get water. When I came back you were fully asleep. I thought—I thought I shouldn’t wake you. I thought I’d check back in a few minutes to see if you were awake, and then I’d give it to you.
“I don’t think I need to spend much more time with Sherlock at this point, really, to say what I need to say now. Mr and Mrs Holmes, may I ask for Sherlock’s hand in marriage?”
“May I ask, which of you will be responsible for her care? We must talk about her ongoing treatment.”
“Shhh, s’okay, you’re gonna get everything you need, I promise.” John flicked his tongue fast and hard, then sucked and blew on the erect tissue. He moved to the other nipple and repeated the process, and above him, Sherlock panted into his palm.
“Jesus Christ, I love you so fucking much,” John said just before closing the distance and taking Sherlock’s mouth with his own. “So much,” he murmured against Sherlock’s lips.
Later neither of them would have a single recollection of the dance lesson. It must have happened, though, because at seven o'clock the music stopped and Sherlock stepped back and said, "I just have to change, it will only take a moment."
John straightens to his full height and kisses Sherlock again. They kiss and kiss and kiss, and then John stops, and with his eyes still closed, says, “Sherlock. Touch me?”
“No, you can have it. I need to think. Will you bring Mrs. Hudson back with you when you come over? I’m going to walk home and think some things through.”
Greg came back with a tray of drinks, and over the next few rounds, John filled them in. He tried to keep it short and to the point, but his storytelling was constantly interrupted by fits and bursts of laughing from the others.
John put the truck in gear, winked, and pulled away. At the end of the drive he stopped, adjusted his rear view mirror, and turned left onto CR-18. Sherlock waited until the dust settled, then walked back into the house.
Five minutes later John came back to the room and threw himself into the chair next to Sherlock's. “This place is incredible. I don't think we have any collections like this at the U of M.”
“I don’t understand. You just said that we don’t need the tooth, or the heartstone, to find our own answers, or to have hope.”
Mycroft fidgeted with his cufflinks and inspected his perfectly manicured nails before answering. “Perhaps I came to see how my younger brother is faring. It seems married life suits you, Sherlock.”
“Well, yeah. What if he’s already set up the date? And how do you know which of the candidates it is?”
They laugh at the inside joke, Sherlock into the pillow, John into Sherlock, and John replies, as he always does, “Where else would I be, you insufferable dick?”
John handed Sherlock his glass of wine, stepped into the tub, and lowered himself into the water. Holding his own glass above the bubbles, he leaned back between Sherlock’s spread legs and against his chest. He wriggled until he was settled, then let out a long sigh.
“All right, love. I will wait. And I must thank your friends as well, for travelling home with you.” Olive looks over at Tui’s huddle, and sighs. “Cetus told me one of them was gravely injured, but has a strong chance of recovering, thanks to you, and thanks to his apprentices.”
“John, listen, she'll realize it's gone soon enough, no matter how we try to hide it. We need to figure out what to do with the tooth, right now. My father will be back in three days, and we will either tell him we have it, or we won't. We need to figure out if we should tell Erebus and Mycroft, too.”
“Hey, come here,” John said at one point, stopping Sherlock’s rapid stride with a touch of his hand on his lower back. They stepped off the path and under the canopy of a nearby tree, startling a red squirrel that wasted no time skittering away into the underbrush. John rubbed at Sherlock’s shoulders until he let out a long sigh and met John’s eye.
John shakes his head, confused, so Sherlock continues. "His feathers have only been groomed in the front, where he can reach. He has a small injury on his left leg that is not being tended to properly. Look, there, at the side of his neck. Those feathers should be slick and shining from where a mate would rub hugs, but his are dull and ruffled. It's been at least two full moons. See?"
“Besides, John, James has already told us he was going to set up some dates. Remember? He may have already been in touch with the Agency.”
The line inched forward, and soon they were only a few people away from the entrance. Sherlock opened his wallet and pulled something out, then put his wallet back in his pocket.
“I appreciate his help, and yours. I still feel horrible about interrupting your honeymoon, though. I’m serious about staying in town, John.”
Most of the Māori words in this chapter have been used before, regularly, but here are their translations:
“Mind? Not at all. It makes sense, actually. There's nothing about you that's not ... more ... than everyone else. Your mind, the way it works, so many angles, so many dimensions. You've never been containable, have you? Never been predictable."
"Hello! Lestra?" The bird he thinks is Lestra looks at him a bit oddly, so he dials down the intensity of his grin - no use looking like a maniac - and adjusts his pace so they can swim together.
“Exactly. No one is that perfect.” Sherlock splayed his fingers over John’s arse and guided his hips into place so they were better aligned underwater. John was nicely erect and Sherlock was mostly there. The slippery brush of the head of John’s cock along Sherlock’s shaft went a long ways towards finishing the job.
“Here, I found some for you.” John handed him two matching light blue hankies, then tucked another one into his left pocket so he had a matching pair, too.
John laughed, then giggled, then snorted. He swallowed, cleared his throat. “Sherlock. I love you so much. I’ll be so good to you. I’ll make it so good.”
Sherlock stretched, fingers and toes splayed, back arching, thinking about what made this time different. Maybe it was the novelty of what they’d just done, although everything they’d done before was novel to him at one point. Maybe it was his complete, unwavering focus on John as he took a more active role, although he’d certainly been focused on John before. Or, maybe it was just them growing together, so trusting, so safe in their vulnerability, that Sherlock’s brain had given up the fight and let him be for once.
When Sherlock reached out to take John's phone he let the deductions wash over him, and later he categorized them and volleyed them back to John, sat near him in the back of the taxi. He did not tell John everything. He did not tell him the things he did not yet understand, such as the way the scent of fabric softener on his clothes made him feel unbearably exposed and young and wanting.
Without the movie playing in the background, the room was filled with the sound of John’s breathing, which was fast and heavy, and the occasional slurping sound of Sherlock kissing slick flesh. John was usually vocal in bed, but he hadn’t uttered a word since that last
He was just finishing when Mrs. Hudson came into the kitchen, ruffled his hair, and clicked on the coffee pot.
They faced off for a minute, then John ducked down, lifted the Afghan, and crawled up the length of Sherlock's body until they were eye-to-eye and both under the blanket.
“I like the way you taste,” John said without pulling away. He deepened the kiss and squeezed Sherlock’s upper thigh. “I like everything about you.”
Later, Sherlock wouldn’t remember making the decision, but he must’ve had some sort of thought process that involved flipping John onto his back, spreading his legs up and back, and attempting to pound him through the mattress. Hips and back and arse driving him forward, Sherlock fucked.
“Better than incredible.” Sherlock wrapped his arms and legs around John and stroked his hair and neck and back. “It was amazing. You’re amazing. You’re a God, a sex God, and you’re all mine.”
Sherlock wouldn’t have seen a herd of elephants charging them, he’d been so obsessed with John’s forearms. He looked out the window and saw that, yes, the city lights were quite dramatic from this elevation.
Sherlock backtracked to the closet and swept the sliding door open. John’s shirts hung on the left side, haphazard, half off the hangers, collars underturned and cuffs still rolled up. Sherlock’s were on the right, the hangers evenly spaced, his shirts arranged by color, the top two buttons of each one done up to keep the shape of the cut. There, however, between his dark blue striped polo and his light gray button-up, was something new.
“Mm, yes.” He's just barely moving, nudging himself against the head of John's cock, eyelids slowly closing as it breaches him. “Buckaroo? Bucka … fucka … shit. God, that's good.”
Sherlock pushed up with his arms and put his hands on top of the headboard. John realigned himself, putting his mouth directly under Sherlock’s balls.
"Oh, sure, try to distract me from my own stupidity with talk about inches. Whose are we talking about? Yours, or mine?"
“I’m going to try something fancy,” John said under his breath, the two of them standing at the counter.
They march for days, and then the first chinstrap colony breaks away, heading west. Another goes, then another, and more and more, like fibrous threads of floating seaweed, floating away in the pull of its own current.
“I do? Two Ketel One Krushes, please.” John pulled some money out of his wallet and turned back to Sherlock while they waited for their drinks.
“Yes, well, obviously I remember that conversation.” Sherlock was only giving the conversation a tiny bit of his brain power because remaining standing while John’s hands slid up and down his torso and his fingers rubbed at his nipples was requiring the other 98 percent.
John rolled over. He was still panting, breathing as if he'd run a marathon, or been fucked through one.
Sherlock choked on his own spit and raced for the front door. He grabbed Sarah’s coat and hid behind it as he held the heavy wool up for her to slide into. John was right behind him, Sarah’s purse held out like a baton. She twirled from Sherlock, grabbed the purse, and stepped out onto the porch. All three of them were halfway to her car when Mrs. Watson made it to the front door and called out after them.
They retraced their steps, crossed Foster, and continued north. On the corner of Clark and Berwyn they came across Lady Gregory’s Irish Pub and Restaurant, scanned the posted menu, and went inside. It was a huge, two room space made cozy with a deep-set, dark wood bar, oversized booths, and low lighting hung from tin tile ceilings. At the end of the main dining area was a smaller lounge with a roaring fireplace and walls lined with bookshelves, and because it was a slower Tuesday night, they were able to be seated right away near the warmth of the fire.
“Mmm, I want to, I really do, but if we get naked right now, I’ll be here for hours, and I have to get home, for at least a little bit. Have to make an effort.”
“Tell me one.” John wriggled out of his underpants—blue with white birds, today—pushed Sherlock down on the bed and patted his hip to get him to move up toward the pillows. He settled between Sherlock’s legs, sitting back on his heels, stroking Sherlock’s thighs, just barely petting them while Sherlock talked with his eyes closed.
He felt around on the floor where he’d left his phone before turning out the light. Swiping over the screen, he opened his text messages and read through the most recent exchange.
“Well, we could, but to be honest I tend to be a bit superstitious and I’d rather not risk any bad luck if it’s all the same to you. You can take the garter toss and cake-feeding and all that other shite and shove it, but I’d rather not see each other tomorrow until the ceremony.”
