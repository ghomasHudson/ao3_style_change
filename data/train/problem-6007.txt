Tony tied his robe closed, giving the blond a dirty look. "What's wrong Rogers? Can't keep up with the times?" He smirked at the other man, who responded with his own dirty look. "Just turn the music down would you?" He skulked off, leaving an amused Tony to himself.
“Well, what are we all waiting for?” Tony asked, about to dive his fork into the ham. “Wait! We need to say grace!” Pepper swatted Tony’s hand away, and the man groaned. “Really Pepper?” She shot him a look that needed no explanation. Everyone joined hands, and Pepper allowed Steve to do the honors. “Dear Lord, we thank you for these gifts were are about to receive. We thank you for our family and friends, and those we hold close to our hearts.” Steve gave a quick squeeze to Tony’s hand. “Thank you for allowing us to spend another day on this Earth, and allow us to spend a few more.”
Clint and Natasha followed him, seeing the dark, ominous cloud roll over New York. A lighting bolt struck down, and the smile on Bruce's face only grew wider. "C'mon! We gotta go meet him!" He pulled out his tracker, the small blinking light showing the exact location of the god.
"Well, Tony-" Clint began, but a quick cough from Tony caught his mistake. "Uh, I mean
Tony pulled Steve closed, and allowed the blond to begin the lead. "Let's see what you got Cap." he said, eyes full of passion. Steve led him backwards, and Tony lifted his leg to allow Steve to dip him. He did as prompted and lifted Tony back up only to spin them around. Neither noticed the dance floor clearing in order to make way for the dancing couple.
"Oh?" The blond shuddered under the man's touch, responding with light kisses against the brunet's neck.
"Hey babe, so I was thinking we-"
The blond looked at him, a broken smile on his lips. "I hope everything works out for you and Pepper." Steve stood, picking up the folder. "It was nice while it lasted." And with that, he turned around, and walked out of the cafe. Tony was left alone. He had expected it, but... He thought he would be the one to do it...
Tony felt a pang from Steve's cold words, and half of him wanted to walk off the roof at that moment. But he couldn't just leave him here, and so, he joined him. "Move over." he grumbled, making his way towards the super soldier. Steve looked up to see the arrogant man positioning himself near the edge, and the blond smiled softly, trying to keep it hidden, but he was touched. It was nice to know he was thinking of him.
"Oh please Capsicle! You've been frozen in ice for seventy years!" Tony lowered his voice, to help protect Steve's identity, and keep the newly found fans from swarming them.
"No you listen. I went to a whole lot of trouble planning this damn thing out, and you two are going to sit down and talk this thing out like two civilized adults. Is that clear Captain?" Pepper said, voice demanding. Steve couldn't help but laugh. "I'll take that as a yes. Get dressed soldier, you have to be there in an hour." She hung up before the soldier could protest. He sat up, looking at the clock; it was only 12:30, way too early for him to be dealing with this. Nonetheless, he got up and got into the shower. Part of him, a part that he had been hiding for a very long time, was happy to be seeing Tony again. Maybe, this would be a chance to get them back together.
"Maybe it's cause you're blond." Bruce joked, causing Steve to laugh harder.
Steve opened the bottle, taking two pills for himself, and as Tony sat next to him, handed the open bottle over. "Thanks." he muttered, pouring out two pills into his hand. He downed them with a sip of his coffee, and then turned to Steve. "Alright, so what the hell happened last night?"
"What's what going to do to Peter?" The two men looked up to see their son standing in the doorway, backpack slung over his shoulder. He looked confused, lost. "What's going on guys?"
Steve sighed, and lay back in the bed, pushing the sheet away from his face. He looked out the bedroom window of Stark Towers; now renamed Avengers Tower after it had been fully remodeled. A light snow had begun to fall, sticking to the glass. Today wasn't exactly the best day for Steve to be out. He wanted to just stay in bed, and not deal with the world outside. Not deal with the fact that today was the day he had lost his best friend.
it long.” Thor taunted his tone serious but his expression full of good humor.
"Alright, my turn." Tony whispered, switching positions so he now had control over Steve. He looked partly shocked, but allowed it to happen. Tony pushed Steve back a bit, giving him some space so that he could spin into Steve's arms. Steve gracefully caught him, and lifted him back up. They danced close once again, and their legs brushing together slightly aroused them both.
"I mean neither. You're going to destroy the pictures, and I'm gonna do what I need to do." Steve said, eyes dark. "And how are you going to-" "Either you destroy the pictures," His voice deepened, "Or I tell everyone myself. And completely destroy your little story, and you become a laughing stock for trying to hook up with someone who doesn't even like you, or what you have."
Steve turned around to see a petite blond, wearing a low cut and extremely provocative red dress. Steve looked indifferently; he wasn’t into easy girls, or any girl at the moment. “My name is Christine,” She smiled, sticking her hand out towards him. He took it, and smiled. He may as well be polite. “I saw you on the dance floor, and I thought to myself, I just couldn’t let a man like that slip through my fingers.” Christine batted her eyes, touching Steve’s arm.
Steve sighed as he lay back on the bed. "I don't know Pepper, I don't think it's a good idea, me and Tony haven't talked in at least two months, and I don't think Christine would really appreciate me seeing him, not after what he said to her." he justified, and Pepper scoffed over the phone. "That's why I planned this whole thing. You two need to start talking again, Tony hasn't been the same since you two had your fight." she said, and Steve ran a hand over his face. "Listen-"
He held the kiss as the other couple walked by, making it seem as real as possible.
Steve looked back at Tony, who was just standing there, a triumphant look on his smug little face. The soldier wanted nothing more than to just punch him. "Come on Tony, time to get you out of here before you ruin anybody else’s good time." Steve growled, slightly tugging on the man's arm. Tony yanked his arm away, stumbling backwards. "Don't put your hands on my like I'm your property! I'm not your bitch." The man glared at Steve with hazy eyes, and he found it difficult to stay standing for too long.
“When? I want to be there when the truth comes out.”
Steve flicked on the lights to his room, looking around. The Avengers were gone, leaving him alone. They had all decided to go to Shwarma, grab a bite to eat. Steve sighed and tossed his keys on the table, closing the door and turning around to the large and empty room.
Toni glared down at her watch, beginning to grow impatient. She was one to show up late, as she had done, but this was just ridiculous. The waiter came over and poured her another glass of water- her fourth that night. She thanked him with a smile, beginning to turn the ice with her straw as she continued to look over her menu.
"Sleep well Stark?"
Steve thought as he twirled the shorter man, and then stopped him so he was now facing him. He extended his leg so that it fell behind Tony, and slid into it. The beat of the song picked up, and so did they. There movements became one. No longer did there “rivalry” show, now, it was a tango. They moved in such a way that the audience gasped with each twirl, each graceful step. They had never seen such a display. The dancing couple was making love to the music, and using each other as simple bodies. The song ended, and Steve dropped Tony into a dip while falling to one knee.
He finished up and grabbed a towel wrapping it around his lower body. Walking into the kitchen, he found a note, and picked it up. It read:
"STAAAAARK!"
"I love you too," the other whispered, and moaned loudly, feeling himself close. "Come with me babe, make my wish come true." the soldier said, voice almost teasing. Tony laughed lightly, and moaned out Steve's name as he came, listening as his lover did the same. Steve pecked his lips quickly before pulling out, and lying next to his lover on the bed. The brunette began to sing happy birthday softly, and the blond laughed as he pulled him close, and wrapped them beneath the covers.
"I um, so what kind of movies do you like?" Ashley asked, So far, the conversation had been going well, the topics had been keeping away from more modern day topics, that is, until now. Steve ran a hand through his blond hair; trying to think of the most recent movie he had seen. "Um, I'm a real big fan of war movies. That new movie that's out, Argo? It seems really cool. I've been waiting to go see it but-" "But you haven't had anyone to go with you?" Ashley asked tilting her head. Steve was caught off guard.
“Not fair Tony,” Steve teased, nuzzling his face in Tony’s blazer. “You know you love it.” Tony teased back, breathing in Steve’s sweet, masculine scent. “Want to go inside yet?” asked Steve, hoping the answer would be a no. “One more minute. I like this.” Tony whispered. It was nice, the fact that they could simply stand there and just enjoy each other’s presence. Tony didn’t feel judged, or like Steve wanted anything from him. All he wanted was for Tony to be with him, just to be there.
Tony smiled as he watched his friend inspect the gift, and laughed at his sudden surprise. "I made the chain out of adamantium  Thought you might be a little sick of replacing your punching bag every time,” he joked, and Steve gave him a strong hug, lifting him a bit, and the man gasped. "Thanks Tony, this is the best gift ever." He muttered into Tony's shirt, and Tony smiled. "There's a lot more to it, let me show you."
It just didn't seem real, the whole war of the worlds thing. It was... almost like a dream... But it wasn't. As much as everyone wished it was, it hadn't been, and it never would be. What happened happened, and nothing could change that. Tony shook his head and flipped on the plasma screen, trying to find something to watch. Anything to get his mind off now.
"I'm gonna kill you both!" Steve yelled, a hint of teasing in his voice. "Come on now Steve! That's not very patriotic of you!" Clint joked, looking over his shoulder. A cold snowball smacked him hard in the face, and he fell. "Clint!" Tony said over dramatically. "Leave me Tony! I'll hold him off!" Clint yelled, matching Tony's tone. Steve laughed as he grabbed Clint by the ankle, and began to playfully drag him across the snowy lawn. "No! I can't let him take you!" Tony cried out as he quickly spun on his heel, and launched himself at Steve. Steve fell back, and Clint joined in the dog pile.
The room fell silent, watching to see what would conspire. Silence passed for about a minute, before a loud thunder broke in. Everyone but Tony and Steve looked up, and Bruce gasped. He ran out the sliding glass door, onto the patio.
“Are we talking about dinner or Tony?” Steve joked, and Natasha almost fell out of her chair laughing.
Steve turned around to find a scowling Tony behind him, taking the plates from his hands, and murmuring something under his breath that the soldier couldn't quite catch. Regardless, Steve carried over the glasses and moved to where the other man was standing at the sink. Tony smiled, and began to do the dishes. Steve helped, and the two laughed at the unsaid joke.
Steve was about to say something, but Tony cut him off. "No, Steve was just leaving. Weren't you Steve?" The soldier looked at Tony, a hurt look on his face. But the other man didn't seem to care. He simply continued sipping on his drink, and completely ignored Steve. Bruce watched the two of them, sensing something was wrong. His eyes connected briefly with Steve's, who looked on the verge of tears.
"Come on Tony; let's let the two love birds have some fun." Steve flipped out the ring, and Tony followed after. The two laughed at nothing, and Natasha watched with curiosity. "I wonder what's gotten into them?" Clint asked, stretching his arms. The woman shrugged. A thought passed through her mind, and she shuddered. Just don't let it be what I think it is.
"Investigating is a better word for it." Christine said confidently. "You can keep those, I've got plenty." Steve placed the photos back in the folder. "What do you want Christine?" he muttered. "Hm..." she tapped her finger to her chin. "I want you Captain."
Steve quickly spun Tony out, expecting to catch him off guard. He should have known better. Tony planted his feet firmly and pulled Steve towards him instead. Steve gasped and prepared to hit the floor, not expecting Tony to catch him. He pulled the super soldier back up, not missing a step. His eyes flashed with a playful look.
The music resonated through the bodies of the dancers, hot, sweaty bodies coming together and pulling apart as they moved along to the music, creating beautiful images to those who stood aside and watched. And if Steve had his sketchbook, and if it was even remotely acceptable, he would sketch these people, as crude as their moves may have seemed, it simply blew his mind that some people could be so in sync, that they could just read one another's body language enough to move as they did...
Steve finally decided to loosen up a bit, and with a bit more direction, he actually was pretty good at it. Or maybe Tony was just that drunk. Either way, they were getting it on on the dance floor, and Steve couldn't get enough. The song ended, but neither made a move to separate themselves.
She was really angry for Bruce having sent her on this blind date in the first place. Really, she could have at least picked someone who would show up on time, and NOT be an hour late! Not even a call, seriously, this was insane.  "Oh you're just going to love her Toni, she's tall, blonde, blue eyes, just gorgeous. Just give her a chance! Ever since you broke up with Pepper, you've been such a Debby downer! It's time for you to get back out there!" The words replayed in Toni's head, and she snorted. "Get back out there my ass." She began to collect her things, before someone began to approach the table.
"Come on Cap, I'm starved." Tony said as he removed his coat and boots. Steve nodded, doing the same. They walked into the large dining area to see the other avengers gathered around the table, eating. "Hey, Tony! I got great news," Bruce said excitedly, wiping crumbs off his face. Tony and Steve sat and began to load their plates with food as Bruce told them the news. "We got invited as guests of honor to attend a special technology convention dinner party! Guests, of, honor." he tapped his finger on the table with each word, and Tony nearly dropped his plate. "Are you serious? That's great!" Tony had been a guest of honor to quite a few things, but he knew how much this meant to Bruce.
The blond nodded, and the tears came too fast for him to try and hide them. Tony had died almost five months ago, he was shot down in battle, and died in Steve's arms. Tony told Steve with his dying breath that he loved him, and Steve was too much in shock to say anything. He kissed the dying man for the first, and last time. Five months had passed, and he still had dreams where he had been the one to die; and Tony was okay. Five months, and nothing had changed.
The next morning, Tony woke up to Steve still sleeping. He watched his strong chest rise and fall, the sun causing his body to almost glow. He didn't want to get out of bed, but he knew he would have to. So with much resistance, he lifted himself out of his bed and threw on a pair of boxers. He made his way to the kitchen yawning.
He ran at Tony, and punched the man square in the face. He yelped in surprise, and grabbed Steve's arm, throwing him over his shoulder and slamming him into the ground. Steve just lay there for a moment, trying to catch his breath. Tony floated over him, gloating. "Had enough yet Captain?" Steve's eyes flickered with mischief, and the blond flipped over, using the wall as a back spring, and dove at Tony, who allowed himself to be caught. The brunette flipped up his mask, and stared at the blond.
(Major Character Death)
*Dances because of the painful angst in this chapter*
“Don’t break him Thor.” Jane laughed, patting the seat next to her. Thor joined her eagerly, causing her to bounce with the force. “So you’re Jane, it’s nice to finally meet you.” Steve greeted and offered her a hand. She took it with a smile. “Alright! All the guests are here, so why don’t we head into the dining room and enjoy ourselves a nice Christmas dinner?” Pepper suggested, Tony hanging on her waist. Steve swallowed hard, that jealous feeling rising in him once again. “Hell yeah! I’m starving!” Clint cheered as he headed into the dining room, Bruce and Natasha following after.  “I’ll be there in a sec. You all go ahead.” Steve mumbled, jerking his thumb in the direction of the bathroom. Everyone else nodded; Thor and Jane got up from the couch and followed the other couple into the dining room.
Any way that he could piss off Steve, he would do it. But he decided to let Capsicle have this one. Tony walked over to the large red couch, and lay back, thinking about the past few months.
Bruce in this fic is female. However, I don't lke calling her Brenda, so I feel better keeping her name Bruce.
"Keep up Mr. Stark."
"Mr. Stark, may I please try and talk you out of this?" JARVIS pleaded with Tony, who was slipping on his helmet. "JARVIS, I'm not in the mood. Capsicle needs to be put back in his place, because he's apparently forgotten." Tony walked out of the suit room, and walked up to the test room, where a very tall Captain America stood before him, hood up, and shield polished.
"We've found that one of our agents had been leaking some of our plans to a terrorist organization. We need you to go in there and stop them, destroy the plans, and all traces of it." The Avengers picked up on his emphasis of the sentence. He wanted them to kill anyone that seemed like a threat. "Why are we going after them? Doesn't this seem like something for the army?" Tony questioned, a little more than confused. "What does it matter? We have a job to do, and we need to do it." Steve growled, glaring at the brunette. He glared back, before pushing his chair out. "Let's go then. The sooner we get these guys the better."
Steve grabbed his arm, stopping Tony in in his tracks. "Hey," He embraced the brunette in a long hug, nothing special, just a simple hug. But it meant everything to them; they separated, and headed back to their tables. "You okay Tony? You're shivering." Pepper mumbled as Tony sat down. "Um, yeah. It's pretty chilly in those bathrooms." He tried to cover his tracks, and his girlfriend seemed to buy it. The waiter returned, and they placed their orders.
The funeral, empty casket, lasted all day. There were ceremonies held across the nation for the fallen Avenger. Everyone gave Tony his privacy; they could tell he was taking it the hardest.
Originally a three part fic, now rolled into one.
"What are we Tony? Are we friends? Are we together? Or am I just your fuck buddy?" Steve's words stabbed through Tony's heart. He felt his lip quivering; he didn't know what to say.
"Steve, come on, don't do this." Clint tried to reason with Steve, who was currently destroying a sand bag. "Don't try and talk me out of this Clint. I've been waiting for this day for a while." The blond muttered between swings. One last jab, and the sand bag separated from the beam. Oh yeah, he was ready. Steve walked to the locker room, a worried Clint following him. "Come on Steve, Tony's a joker, you can't-" He was cut off, freezing under the blond's cold glare. "You can't keep making excuses for him. It's about time this guy stopped talking, and showed me what he's got."
"I like this song, it's fun." Steve said into Tony's ear. "Yeah, it is." He smiled, closing his eyes and still dancing with the man. The song ended, and some couples began to leave the dance floor as a slower song came on. "Uh, would you, you want to," Steve stammered as he let go of Tony, allowing him to turn around. "Get some food? Sure." Tony finished the man's sentence, a bit saddened to leave Steve's arms, but he knew he had to.
"Uh," Tony began, but couldn't really think of anything to say. "Trying to remove myself from your grip of steel."
“Merry Christmas Cap!” Tony said as he welcomed the super soldier into his home. The Malibu house had been decorated in the most beautiful way. “Pepper?” Steve asked as he waltzed in, gifts in hand. “Who else?” Tony chuckled, and patted his lover on the back. It was the best they could do considering all the guests. “Well, she did a lovely job.” Steve muttered as they walked into the living room. “Why thank you Steve. It’s nice to know
"Hello. If you're watching this, that means my suicide was a success, and I'm dead. I think that I'm supposed to leave a list of reasons, why I chose to do it, isn't that what people do? I'm not sure, I've never done this before. But I've thought about it. You all never seemed to pick up on the fact that I was depressed, or maybe you chose to ignore it. Either way, it won't matter in a few minutes. In a few minutes, I'll shut off the camera, and take the coward's way out. It's like you said Steve, I should stop acting like a hero." Tony lifted the gun, showing it to the camera. "I hope you have a good life with Ashley. She's a beautiful girl. Really. And Clint, sorry I won't be able to attend your wedding. I'm sure Natasha will look beautiful in something besides her usual black and white get up. Bruce, keep working on our projects when I'm gone okay? And Thor, I hope you enjoy all the pop tarts and drinks you can get. Take a little extra for me would you?" he sighed. "And Pepper, I love you. I do. But before I go, I thought you should know, I loved someone else too. I won't say who it is. He should know." Tony put the gun to his head, and smiled one last time. "Goodbye."
"Come on Stark, almost to your room." Steve said as he lifted an incapacitated Tony into the long corridor. The drunk man hung onto the blond's large shoulders, and tried his best to walk straight, but that bump to his head only made his condition worse.
A few had gathered in Clint’s penthouse, which over looked the whole city. He and Tony had fought immensely over it, before they decided on a drinking game to settle their problems. It surprised everyone that the older man had lost, but everyone suspected that the usual drinker had thrown the game. Natasha joined Clint and Steve on the balcony, dressed in a flowing black nightgown. Her red hair suddenly shone in the sunlight, and the male assassin raised his hand in mock surprise. Natasha smirked at him, and kissed him good morning.
"Hey Tony." Tony's head shot up from behind the machine, eyes glaring at the tall blond. Steve stood in his old army suit, his hair combed perfectly. "Where are you going?" The dark haired man growled, getting up to refill his glass. He tried to act uninterested, but he really was curious; and actually a bit jealous. Steve picked up on Tony's cold attitude, and bit his lip nervously. "Um, me and Ashley are going out for some dinner thing- are you okay?" The blond tilted his head, following the man with his eyes. Tony slammed the bottle down on the counter, refusing to face him. "Me? I'm great."
"Come on Capsicle, don't be so pissy. You got her number didn't you?" Tony grumbled, not taking his eyes off Steve. "Yeah, no thanks to you." Steve huffed, collecting the plates. He stared at the half melted candles, hoping that they would set aflame once again, and with them, the night would once again set back to the way it was, the way it was before they went to the bar, before Tony decided that getting drunk would be a good idea.
Tony rubbed his eyes, wiping away tears that finally managed to spill. He grabbed a napkin from the table, and pressed it into his bloody palm, blood leaking from where his nails had dug into his skin. The pain from his failing arc reactor was getting worse. It wouldn’t be too long till he finally passed. He knew he had a week at best, a week left to live. A week to let everyone he loved go.
"Ooh, vanilla!" Steve chuckled, and Tony sighed with relief. The rest joined him, and they all proceeded to eat cake off each other’s faces, and throw it around the room. Natasha and Clint dominated the cake war, with Clint going so far as to get a rubber band and fling it at the others. Steve was having a great time. It was the first time in a long time he didn't think about the war, or Bucky.
"Natasha, there is nothing going on between us. I promise you that." Tony crossed his arms, and began to walk back into the hotel room. "But you want there to be don't you?" The woman muttered, and felt smirked as the man stopped dead in his tracks, and his whole body tensed. The brunette thought of all the nights that he dreamt of Steve, about how his bed was so cold without someone beside him, and how he only wanted Steve to see how he felt. How he
"Rise and shine soldier!"
thought that since you've missed so many birthdays, it wouldn't hurt to throw you a surprise party!" the assassin corrected himself, but not before Tony sent him a dirty look.
"Hey! Stop! What the hell are you doing Stark?" Steve cried out, trying to fight off the clingy man. "Hey guys did I-" The fight broke as the two looked over to see the stunned Natasha standing in the doorway, mouth gaping open. Steve's shirt was half off, exposing his abs, and Tony had him pressed up against the refrigerator.
A few months had passed since the incident. New York City still has a long way to go until it would ever be close to being the same, but everyone is helping out. The Avengers have become very popular in the eyes of the citizens. The destruction of the city paid little heed to the saving of their lives.
“I’m not stupid; I know exactly who you are.” He smiled, and leaned in close enough so their faces were only inches apart. “And also, I’m not into blondes.” Steve straightened, gave her a small nod, and walked away, leaving Christine open mouthed and pissed.
"I've um, I've missed talking with you Tony. I mean, yeah we talk back at S.H.I.E.L.D, but I mean," Steve dropped his gaze to the table. "I miss our real talks." "So have I Cap- Steve." The brunette corrected himself. "Even if we, you know, that doesn't mean we can't still be friends, right?" "Yeah, it's not like we still," the blond said, dancing around the word. "I'm sick of trying to pretend like I don't want us to be close again. I mean, friend close." he muttered, and Tony nodded in agreement.
"Shut up and buckle up." Steve ordered, cutting Christine off. She scoffed, but still did as she was told. "Where the hell do you-" She began again, but the soldier glared at her, nostrils flaring, and eyes dead set. "How long do you plan on keeping me your little prisoner Christine?" he growled, and began to drive. "I'm not sure, why? You thinking of just giving up and letting me expose you and Tony?" She threatened, smiling deviously. Steve laughed, which caused the woman's smile to fade. "What are you laughing at?"
He began crawling out slowly, and Steve chuckled as he watched the grown man crawl across the floor like a two year old. "You'll never cease to amuse me Stark." Tony peeped up from behind the couch, a scowl on his face. "Shut up and make the coffee. I'm going for some aspirin." he grumbled, continuing his journey to the bathroom. It was then that Steve noticed Stark wore nothing but a pair of boxers, and a blush crawled slowly up his face. He couldn't break his stare with Tony's butt; it was...
"Are you calling me a liar, Ms. Stark?" Stephanie asked. She looked quite offended, and the other woman couldn't help but smirk.
"We'll get you a woman!"
Everyone smiled at each other, knowing exactly how much Bruce and Thor had connected. Tony walked out from the bathroom, adjusting his belt buckle. "What's going on?" he asked, looking around at everyone's amused faces. "Thor's coming to town." explained Clint, getting up from his bar stool to grab himself  a refill on his drink. Tony groaned, obviously not excited for "Blondie's" arrival.
Tony looked up, a little more than shocked. Bruce was rubbing his temples, trying to keep calm. "You always try to keep secrets, and look where that's gotten you." He said, and walked over to his friend. "You need to stop hiding, and just let everyone know what you feel for Steve, the fact that you love him." He reasoned, placing his hands on his friend's shoulders. "I can't do that Bruce! You don't get it!" Tony exclaimed.
"So... You and Tony huh?"
Steve stood outside the cafe, eyes darting around, foot tapping with nervousness. "Hello Captain." An icy voice said, and Steve's eyes fell upon Christine Everhart. "I'm glad you took my offer to meet me." She smiled, and Steve snorted as he looked away. "Of course." he muttered, and got the door to the cafe for her.
"Hurry up with that coffee. I don't know if you forgot, but we need to meet with Fury in less than an hour, and," Steve paused as he looked over Tony's undergarments. "I don't think you want to go looking like that." The brunette scowled, and sipped his coffee. "Like you're any better off. Is that my shirt?" he questioned, recognizing the large brown grease stain against the purple fabric. "Oh, yeah I-"
After the fight, they began cleaning up, as the cake had gotten just about everywhere. Tony poured drinks; he had bought Steve's favorite, blueberry schnapps. "To Captain America, the best and only super soldier I've ever known." He raised a glass, and all joined him in the toast. "Speech! Speech!" Clint said under a cupped hand. Steve smiled and got up from his spot on the couch. "Well, what is there to say except, thank you. You guys have made life so great, and," Steve paused, looking around the room, before his eyes fell on the brunette that he had been fighting with so often.
Tony smiled as he lit the candle for Steve's cake, and held his hand in front of the flame as he began to slowly walk towards the bedroom. He opened the door quietly, not wanting to wake the still sleeping soldier. He shuffled over to the bed, holding the small cake in one hand as he climbed onto the bed, settling in beside his lover and kissing his neck tenderly. "Happy birthday babe," he whispered as he saw Steve stir, and finally wake.
Steve laughed at him as he got up to help Tony up. He scowled at the helpful hand. "I can get up myself Cap." He attempted to get up again, but once again failed. Steve rolled his eyes and grabbed the man's arm, gently. "Easy Cap, we're not all indestructible." Tony joked, his voice low. He looked up to see the blond with a strange look on his face. It was something he didn't recognize...
"I'm sorry Tony. It's better that I leave for a while. Maybe this is a sign, a sign we need to break up for good. I mean, look at us, did we really think we would last?" Steve shook his head, laughing so he wouldn't cry.
Steve’s lips twitched; and he looked down at his hands. “I hate this.” He muttered to himself. “What?” Tony asked, focusing his attention on Steve. “This. I finally find the love of my life, and I don’t even get to hold his damn hand.” Tony pursed his lips, and placed his hand beneath the table, placing it on Steve's knee. The blond smiled, and placed one of his hands beneath the table as well.
"Stark! Stark it's over! Come in Stark!" Clint's voice broke through Tony's blind fury, and he landed, falling to his knees with exhaustion.
"Me? Oh what on Earth would give you that impression? I'm simply saying that you're withholding some amount of truth from me about certain information that seems quite, oh, I don't know, necessary, for two people to begin to form a relationship of any kind." Toni sipped lightly on her water, helping to hide her smirk.
He didn't bother to turn on the light, considering it better for both of them to leave it off. Steve finally reached the bed, but as he was about to toss Tony onto it, the brunette wrapped his arms around the blond and fell on him. The bed creaked under their combined weight, and it was too comfortable for Steve to even try and get up. Tony's breathing slowed, and the blond could tell he was asleep.
They finally made it to Tony's room, and Steve reached into the other man's pant pockets, looking for the room key. The brunette pushed off Steve in protest. "The hell are you doing Cap?" he asked angrily. "Listen; just give me your keys so we can get you to bed." The soldier ordered, not in the mood for Tony's petty games.
He tried to pull away, but Tony wouldn't take no for an answer. He continued to sing, and Steve simply laughed as he was pushed onto a stool that they had set out. "Oh, cant you see? You belong to me. Now my poor heart aches with every step you take!" he serenaded Steve, watching as his face turned red and he tugged at his ears. Tony smirked, and took his hand. The song began to end, and Steve seemed to stand up to be leaving. The brunette looked at him sadly, before the soldier kissed him, and uttered the final words for him. "I'll be watching you." he smiled, and left Tony up on stage, grinning like a fool.
"Good, he's up." laughed Tony, and he turned down
"Wow Stark, you really went all out!" Steve smiled as he looked at the wide array of food on the large dining room table. "You make this yourself?" he joked. Tony smiled, and rubbed the back of his neck. "I'm an engineer, not a chef." he muttered uncomfortably. "Come on. Enough chit chat, I don't want this food to go to waste!" The pair sat down on opposite ends of the table, and toasted to their glasses of red wine.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Keep doing that and we're both going to drown." Tony warned, not wanting him to stop. "It'd be worth it." the blond whispered, before letting go of Tony. The brunette turned around, confused. "Where'd you go?" he called, not seeing Steve at the surface. He felt a light tug on his foot, and he held his breath as he was pulled down into the blue water, his lips being met with Steve's.
He counted them off. "One, two, three!" They downed the shots, and Tony fell out of his chair.
*Dances while chanting* Birthday sex, birthday sex.
"My name's Ashley. It's nice to finally talk to you." She smiled, and Steve smiled back. "I'll leave you two alone." Tony mumbled in the blond's ear, and he got up, leaving the two to mingle. The brunette sighed, and walked to a booth, figuring Steve would be able to fend for himself, which meant Tony could get as drunk as physically possible, and get rid of the impending jealousy.
Tony rubbed his temple with his free hand, the noise of the city construction not helping his severe hangover. He went back inside, slowly sipping his coffee as he tried to remember any more of the night. Nothing came to him. He'd have to talk to Steve after breakfast. But first, he ran into the bathroom and puked his brains out. Never again, never! "God damn super soldier." the brunette growled under his breath, wiping his mouth with a wet towel. What had he been thinking anyways? Why was it so important to prove himself to the other man?
Steve drummed his fingers on the table, wishing everyone would get here so he could go home. He didn't mind the fact that they had a job to do; it was the thought of seeing
"Hey Cap," Tony murmured. Steve looked over, and was immediately doused in orange soda. "Dammit Tony!" he yelled as he scrambled for a towel. Tony laughed by the pool, teasing Steve with his towel. "Looking for something?" he smirked, and Steve stood. "Oh come on, you know that was hilarious." Tony said, trying to hold back more laughter. "So is this." Steve smirked, and pushed the brunette into the pool. Tony cried out as Steve grabbed the towel from his hands. The brunette came up a few moments later, sputtering and coughing. The super soldier smirked by the edge of the pool, toweling off. "You're an ass." Tony muttered, swimming to where Steve stood. "Help me out." "No you're going to pull me in with you." Steve laughed, tossing his towel to the side. "Shut up and help me out will you?" Tony demanded, and Steve rolled his eyes.
Natasha smiled, knowing that he took the bait. "You, you are a tricky one Romanov." Tony chuckled, laughing so he wouldn't start crying. He turned around slowly, putting his hands up in mock surrender. "Alright you caught me. So what? You gonna go tell everyone?" he asked, staring down at the ground, a forced smile on his face.
Tony stared out into the room and sipped his coffee. The burning sensation had gone, and a dark stain was visible against his light skin. "I dunno. If Bruce can't get anybody, I'd be glad to go. But I don't like just being handed things." He smiled, thinking about the great days he had spent with Bruce in the lab. The guy truly was a genius, and often helped him out when Pepper was off at meetings. She'd been gone more often than usual, and he missed her...
appreciates my decorating.” Pepper teased as she greeted the blond. “I never said I didn’t appreciate it!” Tony laughed, pulling her into a kiss. Steve fought back the jealous feeling rising in him.
Inspired by the song "I Get Off" By Halestorm.
"I can feel you breathe; I can feel your heart beat faster! Take me home tonight; I don't want to let you go till you see the light! Take me home tonight! Listen honey, just like Ronnie said, be my little baby!" The crowd sang in unison, including the two men. "You've gotten better since we last danced." Tony noticed, eyeing the soldier up and down. The blond shrugged. "Practice makes perfect I guess." "I wouldn't call it perfect," Tony teased, and Steve scowled. He reached his hand out to give the man a light shove, but he dodged it and instead, took the hand in his own and intertwined their fingers before turning into Steve, pressing his back against his chest.
He felt himself move forward, and Bruce wrapped him in a tight hug. "I'm sorry; I didn't realize how difficult this was for you." He muttered as Tony hugged him back. "No, you don't need to apologize, you're right... But I just can't do that. Not yet." He pushed his friend away, giving him a sad look. "I think it's time you knew, the truth." Tony pulled Bruce over to the chairs, and they sat down. The man explained everything that happened after the fight with Steve, he explained the deal with Christine, how if he tried anything, the pictures would leak, and it would completely destroy Pepper, and Tony's reputation.
Tony pulled Steve closed, and allowed the blond to begin the lead. "Let's see what you got Cap." he said, eyes full of passion. Steve led him backwards, and Tony lifted his leg to allow Steve to dip him. He did as prompted and lifted Tony back up only to spin them around. Neither noticed the dance floor clearing in order to make way for the dancing couple.
He moved up to the man's neck, kissing his way up to Steve's lips, tangling his fingers in his short blond hair, tugging lightly. The other man felt his chest rising and falling more quickly, and he pulled down the brunette's boxers, sitting up a bit to pull them down all the way, and Tony allowed himself to be put back down on the bed, smiling up at the blond, a gentle but hungry look to his eyes, he had been waiting for this night to come once more. Steve smiled back, before reaching into the nightstand, grabbing the lube, and looking at the brunette, who gave a small nod. "I need you, now." he begged, and the blond nodded, placing some lube in his hands, warming it, before hovering over Tony, and watching as he spread his legs, allowing the man to insert a lubed finger.
Tony's eyes flew open, and he sat up to see Steve sneaking out the door. He was in complete shock... Steve had just told Tony, that he loved him. "Where you think you're going soldier?" The brunette asked, a playful tone to his voice. "Get back here and give me twenty." Steve smirked, and climbed on the bed, crawling to where Tony was laying, and kissing him again. "Sure thing, Mr. Stark."
Stephanie couldn't hide her confusion. "Excuse me?"
Steve looked around once more for Ashley, but he didn't see her. He sighed heavily, and began to walk out of the bar with Tony pounding his fists into the man's back, trying to get the man to put him down. But his efforts were in vain. So, he decided to get a little revenge. Just as they were walking out, he grabbed a handful of Steve's ass, causing the man to yelp, and jolt his shoulder upwards, right into Tony's crotch. The man groaned in pain, hiding his face in the blond's back, and listening to the soft chuckle that erupted within him.
this was some hot shit. "Come on Capsicle, you gonna just stand there and get a stiffy or are you actually gonna give a little here?" Tony breathed, nibbling lightly on Steve's ear. He could give less of a shit as this point, he was so wasted that this could be not even Steve anymore, and it wouldn't even make a difference. He just wanted to fuck something good and hard, and if was the hot blond named Steve Rogers, bonus points.
Steve looked up at her. "Excuse me?" "You heard me quite well. I want you. And if you don't accept my offer, these photos get leaked." Christine threatened, and Steve stiffened.
And so, he did. Without thinking, Steve stepped up to Tony and kissed him. Their lips danced with each other, a spark- no- a flame igniting with the simple touch between them. The soldier held Tony tight, wanting to be as close to him as possible. The brunette pressed against Steve with a passion, the cold of the metal seeping through the blond's clothing, but he felt nothing. His body was on fire, and it was the only thing he could feel. Tony's body melted under the blond's touch, and he wanted to shed the metal that encased him, the metal that kept him from truly connecting with this man, the one man that he finally realized he
The solider tried desperately to ignore the tightening in his groin. His eyes followed the other man's hand, an unknowing guide as it reached down between Tony's spread legs, grabbing his prick. He began to stroke himself slowly, hand moving up and down his shaft. Steve felt his knees buckle; his pants only growing tighter. His breathing quickened as the brunette's hips bucked up into his hand, giving the soldier a good look at Tony's, everything.
The blast flew them forward, and they were caught by the Hulk. "Thanks buddy." Tony said as they were dropped. "Are you insane? You directly violated my orders!" Steve yelled, standing and brushing himself off. "Excuse me? If I had listened to you, you'd be dead right now!" Tony remarked, glaring at the blond. "I would have been fine, and you wouldn't have put yourself in danger! We don't need two dead heroes!" The soldier retorted. "Why can't you just be grateful? You know this is the second time I've saved your ass!" The brunette snarled, taking a step towards him. "And I recall you being more than grateful the first time."
He sighed, and changed into some nice dress pants, and one of his famous shirts.
"What are you staring at Capsicle?" Tony asked, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
Without another word, Steve headed into the showers, wanting to be fully ready when he beat the shit out of Stark.
He checked his watch, seeing it was 9:34, and his eyes widened. He looked back at the window again, but saw no sign of Tony. His curiosity flared, and he got up to walk as casually as he could to the kitchen. He dumped out his drink, trying to keep an angle on the window at all times. He noticed a bedroom mirror reflecting the bed, and his heart raced. He watched in silence as Tony laid back on the silk sheets of the bed, one hand in his hair, the other traveling and studying the contours of his own body.
He looked up, staring at Tony, dropping his gaze whenever he looked up at the blond.
"I promise though, I won't tell anyone. I'm good with secrets."
He splashed some cool water on his face, looking at himself in the mirror. Why was he so nervous tonight? It was like any other show that he had done, nothing was different! So what was making his nerves go insane? "Mr. Stark? You're up." A voice at the door notified him that he would need to be getting his ass up on stage in front of all those people. "Alright." he muttered, and grabbed a towel to dab the remaining water off his face.
“Mm, smells just like mom’s.” Steve announced, walking into the dining room with a grin on his face. Tony sat at the head of the table, Pepper on his left, then Natasha, then Clint. Jane sat across from him, and Thor of course sat next to her. Bruce was seated next to the large God, and an empty seat by Tony was obviously Steve’s. He smiled, and headed to his seat. “I hope you’re hungry, I made a lot of food for all of us.” Pepper told him, looking in Thor’s direction.
"I didn't. And I'm pretty sure you haven't told me what you really do, Miss Rogers." Toni knew when someone was lying, and this woman had bullshit written all over her face.
Tony's head was spinning, and he released into the blond's hand as he moaned out Steve's name, eyes fluttering as he rode his orgasm, and the soldier came a moment after, pulling out of the brunette, and pressing their sweaty foreheads together, kissing each other breathlessly, mutterings of "I love you"s repeated over and over, seeming as they could never say them enough.
“Natasha taught me; told me if I was gonna keep you I had to learn how to show you up every once in a while.” Steve said, lowering his voice as they reached the couple.
. Bullet number three.
Steve began to get the hang of it, and Tony decided to let him lead. The soldier was a bit awkward with it at first, stepping on Tony's toes every now and then, but once he got the hang of it, Tony realized Steve was very graceful. That super soldier serum didn't just make him another pretty face. The song slowly ended, and Tony and Steve separated. "Thanks for that Tony." The man said, a blush threatening to ravage his face. He rubbed the back of his neck, and saw Tony heading towards the bar.
“Heard you and Tony yelling last night, what the hell happened?” Clint asked, early the next morning. Steve looked up from his plate of eggs and French toast, only half eaten. “For your safety and mental health, it’s better if you don’t know.” the blond muttered, moving his eggs around on his plate. Clint decided not to push the topic, seeing the tired look in Steve's eyes. He simply sighed and took a bite of his chocolate doughnut, admiring the view.
Pepper bit her lip, and kissed her boyfriend. "Sounds like a plan." she muttered, and they headed back to Tony's car.
Steve took his head away from Tony's metal hand, the cold no longer affecting his heated face. "You don't get it do you? I can't tell you what I need to tell you!" he yelled, becoming more and more frustrated with himself. He got up from his spot on the edge of the building and moved towards the door to the stairs. He wanted to clear his head, and Tony being there wasn't helping. The other man quickly got up and blocked his path. "Move out of my way Tony." Steve growled, glaring at the iron man. The brunette smiled and crossed his arms across his chest. "Make me."
Tony turned the corner of the hedges and gasped. He watched as Steve kissed the blond, and his heart sank. Tony felt a sick feeling rise within him, and he hoped it was the booze finally getting to him. He turned around, keeping his head down. He was thankful for the snow falling. It would give him an excuse as to why his face was wet. He got back in the car, and slammed the door. Without buckling in, he sped off, wanting to be as far away from the house as possible.
Steve rushed to catch him, and the two fell into the snow as he caught Tony in his arms. Tony brought his face to Steve's and laughed. The blond's hair was covered in snow, and the scowl he wore only made it funnier. "It wasn't funny! You could have hurt yourself!" Steve growled, not in a hurry to push Tony off. "Oh come on, you know you love being a hero." Tony said with a smug look. Steve smiled, and without thinking, they kissed. It was short, but Steve thought he felt the snow melt beneath them as soon as their lips touched.
They all go out on a mission, and someone doesn't come back.
"Nothing. I just kind of guessed." Bruce tried to hide his grin, and Steve looked at him. "You slick son of a gun." He laughed, and ran a hand through his hair. "Damn... You think I would have seen right through that one."
"Just relax." Steve smirked, effortlessly turning the brunet over, and digging around for the lube in the bedside drawer. Tony waited with anticipation, staring out of the corner of his eye as he watched the other man finally find the lube and pour some into his hands, warming it up before he pressed his fingers into Tony. The man groaned into his pillow, biting down on it as Steve's fingers moved inside of him, moving effortlessly.
"That's Captain Rogers to you, Stark!" Stephanie hissed, before her eyes widened in realization. She opened her mouth to cover her tracks, but Toni put up a hand, stopping her.
"Stop being so selfish Stark! I need to do what's best for me!"
"It's my favorite flavor of soda, and besides, I don't drink." Stephanie said plainly, looking over her menu absent minded. "So, Ms. Stark, what do you do for a living?"
Tony groaned slightly, turning over so that his back was now facing Steve's chest. He reached up and began to untangle the blond's arms from around his body.
“Oh, my, God.” Christine gasped, not believing what she had just seen.
"Nothing." was all the man said, before jamming a finger on his button. The elevator doors shut, and an awkward silence passed over. The couple quickly got off on their floor, continuing with the argument in a hushed tone. Tony tapped his foot impatiently as the car went to his floor, finally stopping. He ran off, in desperate need of a drink. He and Steve haven't fought like that in forever. It scared him, and he didn't want to deal with his fear right now.
The sudden sunlight caused Steve to go temporarily blind, as he tried to look for a dark corner of the couch. "What's all the noise- what the hell Romanoff?" Tony cried out with surprise as he walked into the living room, and the sudden sunlight caused him to cringe. "I got a hangover!" "You're fault, not mine!" Natasha replied in a singsong voice, and she left the room to go wake Clint.
In no way do I condone suicide as a way to solve your problems. This was a request made to me.
Tony didn't trust Steve one bit. "Alright, how about this, I'll lead, and then you can take over." The brunette quickly placed his hands in the correct positions, and Steve did the same. Piano Man began to play in the background, and Steve felt himself swaying to the music.
“You were smart. I could probably eat more than these four men combined!” He laughed, patting Bruce on the back. “Is that a challenge?” Clint asked, his eyes flickering with mischief. “Now boys, let’s keep it civil. You can settle your little challenge after dinner, if there’s any left overs left.” Natasha teased, kissing her fiancé on the cheek.
Steve moaned at the feeling of Tony's stiff cock against his own, loving the way his heat felt. Tony grabbed Steve's shoulders, and spun him so that he was now below Tony. He smiled, and dragged his teeth across his lips. He grabbed the blond's firm ass, and quickly grabbed his cock with the other hand. His eyes widened, and filled with pleasure. Tony began to stroke him, and moved his way down to Steve's body, kissing his neck, his chest, and finally reaching his pecs. He bit down on Steve's nipple, and he cried out. "Like that big boy?" Tony growled, letting his tongue flick over it, showing it some affection.
The brunette turned on his rockets, and flew at Steve.
The cake exploded, and the Avengers ducked; but not quick enough. Tony took his free hand to wipe cake out of his eyes, and immediately gasped at what he had done. "Shit..." he whispered under his breath, and he noticed the others with cake splattered on them as well. They got up slowly, and gave Tony a dirty look before their eyes fell on Steve, who seemed to have received most of the blast.
"Alight Stark, you're on."
Tony woke up from his horrific dream with a start. It was another nightmare of New York; another nightmare that he would only vaguely remember. He was in his large bedroom, the curtains closed, but still allowing some sunlight. He got up and realized he was still in yesterday's clothing.
Anger and hurt flooded him. He went blind. All he could hope is that it wasn't painful. It wasn't as painful as the scream that tore Tony's throat apart as the realization of losing the man he loved washed over him. It wasn't as painful as the feeling of his heart being torn from his chest as he went temporarily insane, blasting everything and everyone with his repulsors.
“You two go have fun, I’m going to try and talk to someone.” Bruce said, putting his drink down, and looking at the crowd. “Good luck buddy. See you back at the hotel.” Tony and Steve headed off in the opposite direction, Steve a few steps behind. They didn’t want to draw any unwanted attention. “Slow down a little would you?” Steve said through clenched teeth. He had finally caught up with each other at a secluded table, one that was out of sight. “Slow down? I thought I wasn’t going fast enough!” Tony replied, examining his drink. “You forget how long your legs are Cap.”
He looked at Tony, who looked at him, and they smiled. "I thought I would have lost you there Captain." Tony panted. “Consider it pay back from a few months ago." Laughed Steve, and he rose from the snow, cringing as he finally put weight on his ankles. He cried out with pain, and the brunette caught him. "You alright?" he asked, giving Steve a concerned look. "I'm fine, but I'll need some help getting home." he said smiling. "Think you could give me a lift, Mr. Stark?" Tony placed the man over his shoulders, adjusting him so he was splayed out against his back. "Of course, Captain."
"I have a few friends on the inside. That, and S.H.I.E.L.D isn't too hard to break in to when you've got technology like mine." Toni spoke with some pride, earning her a quirked eyebrow from the woman before her. "So, Captain, now that you know I know all about you, does that make you want to get up and leave?"
“I’m not stupid; I know exactly who you are.” He smiled, and leaned in close enough so their faces were only inches apart. “And also, I’m not into blondes.” Steve straightened, gave her a small nod, and walked away, leaving Christine open mouthed and pissed.
Stephanie glared at the brunette before her. "A liar, then? And what happened Ms. Stark? I thought you felt quite strongly against me and you having any form of a relationship, and yet here you are saying that me holding something back would threaten that?"
"I want you." The smaller man begged, and a small voice in the back of his head screamed at him for being so easy. That was quickly drowned out by Steve's response, "My place or yours?"
. He wanted them to become one; he wanted Steve to know just how long he had waited for this man to realize everything he felt about him. The soldier slammed Tony against the metal door, the force causing a small dent; but neither noticed. They could have fallen down the stairs, and they wouldn't have cared. Steve tried his hardest to just lose himself in this man, to just let it all go, forget everything that had ever happened to him, and  not care about whatever would. He wanted to live for now, for
Steve watched her as she left, a feeling of relief flooding through him. He looked down, groaning. Damn broad. He thought sourly, and went about handling his new problem.
"Steve let go of him!" Bruce yelled, and Steve was tackled off of Tony, who had to be held back by Clint to avoid him going after Steve once more. "Get him up to his room!" Natasha ordered, and Bruce nodded. He had to wrap his arms around Steve's waist and arms, which wasn't easy for someone who was as small as he was. Steve kept screaming at Tony, words incoherent over his loud sobs that he tried so hard to hold back. Tony was yelling back, telling Steve to pack his shit up, he was gone. He wouldn't be allowed in the tower again.
"Steve? Steve wake up!" Bruce shook the soldier hard, and he jolted awake. "Wh-what?" He rubbed his eyes, and checked the clock. Ten a.m. "You were screaming in your sleep again," Bruce muttered. "Sorry," Steve sighed, and quickly wiped a tear away.
Tony grabbed a bottle of lube, moving his hand from himself and spreading it between his hand, applying it to his shaft, and now moving lower to his entrance, pushing inside of himself. Steve pumped himself furiously as he watched the show, moaning and groaning like some type of animal in heat.
The blond began to fumble with his own pants, struggling with the stubborn belt as he fought to relieve himself from the agonizing pain that he could no longer ignore. Tony continued his rhythm, picking up some slight speed as he reached down to palm himself. Steve felt a moan escape his own lips as he was finally able to grab hold of himself and start pumping.
Steve bit his lip, tilting his head back. Snowflakes caught on his lashes, blurring his vision along with the tears. "I can't talk about it, it's too painful." he whispered, blinking back more tears. Tony nodded knowingly. "Okay, okay, I understand, you don't have to." he held the blond tightly, letting him have his moment.
"Wait, Steve, if this is about what I said earlier, I'm sorry! I didn't mean it, I love having you in the tower, I love you..." His voice dropped to a whisper with in the last words, and the blond felt tears trying to escape. "I'm sorry too, I'm sorry for wasting your time with this stupid little dream we had, thinking that we could be something more." Tony thought he was going to cry. "Steve..."
Steve immediately tensed, and glanced at Bruce, who now leaned on the counter casually. "I'm sorry?"
“Well, what are we all waiting for?” Tony asked, about to dive his fork into the ham. “Wait! We need to say grace!” Pepper swatted Tony’s hand away, and the man groaned. “Really Pepper?” She shot him a look that needed no explanation. Everyone joined hands, and Pepper allowed Steve to do the honors. “Dear Lord, we thank you for these gifts were are about to receive. We thank you for our family and friends, and those we hold close to our hearts.” Steve gave a quick squeeze to Tony’s hand. “Thank you for allowing us to spend another day on this Earth, and allow us to spend a few more.”
"Alright!" Ashley's face brightened, and she grabbed a napkin and a pen from her purse. "Here's my number. Why don't you give me a call when you’re free?" she asked, sliding the napkin his way. He picked it up, grinning like a fool. "Sure. I definitely will." "What the hell Steve, I leave you for less than an hour and your talking to some blonde?" Tony's angry voice caused the two to turn around, Ashley confused, and Steve, he looked as if he had a mix of anger and embarrassment crossing his face.
"So what you're saying I'm bad for you? Have you forgotten all the shit I did for you?"
"We can move past it." Steve smiled back, trying to disguise his heart break.
"Yes sir." Tony muttered, curling up in Steve's arms and falling asleep.
He had been working in his lab alone when it happened. A familiar voice called out to him, but he chose to ignore it. I'm just hallucinating again. He thought, and continued his work. A pair of hands turned him around, and pulled him into a tight hug. "Tony! Tony it's me!" the blond said, on the verge of tears from happiness. "That's wonderful." Tony grumbled, pushing the other off of him. Steve stared at him in disbelief. "What? Tony, I'm home, I'm alive!" he said, tears streaming down his face.
He shook his head as he went into the kitchen to make breakfast, getting eggs and bacon out of the fridge. He whistled happily to himself, and heard an annoyed grumble come from the bedroom as Tony stirred, and got out of bed. He strutted out after a few minutes, wearing a robe and some sweats. "You think it's funny to have me wake up alone? I'm sick of doing that you know." he growled, pressing his forehead against Steve's bare bicep, kissing it. Steve chuckled, and turned away from the food to wrap his arms around the man. "Well, I figured you'd be hungry after last night." The blond teased, kissing Tony.
A blush rushed up to Steve's face, and he looked away, desperately trying to keep his feelings hidden.
“I guess that makes me first.” Jane said, reaching out for her gift. They had done secret Santa’s figuring it would be the best way to get everyone a gift while not spending too much. Jane got a pair of shoes, red and silver, to match Thor’s Asgardian outfit. Bruce got a pair of elastic pants, wide enough to fit the hulk. Natasha kept her gift hidden from the rest. Clint got standard S.H.I.E.L.D targets; Pepper got a long and elegant dress, an obvious gift from Natasha. Tony got a new pair of high tech goggles, ones that tinted when working with brighter lights. Thor received a cell phone. “I’m not sure if it’ll work in Asgard, Clint shrugged, “But it’s worth a shot.” Steve had convinced the other’s to allow him to go last.
"Hey, where's Steve?" Bruce whispered to Tony. The man looked around, noticing everyone was distracted, and Steve must've slipped out. "I don't know, I'll try to go find him. Make sure everyone keeps having a good time, I'll be back in a sec." Tony quickly mumbled to Bruce, who nodded, and grabbed a bottle from the fridge. "Who's up for some drinks?" The whole room cheered, and Tony made his exit.
"I knew you'd like it." The brunette muttered as he kissed some frosting off his lover's lips. Steve kissed back, dipping his finger into the cake as well, and spreading it along Tony's jaw, making a trail for his lips to follow. The smaller man smirked as he realized what was happening, and began to spread some of the cake over his half naked body, giving the soldier a sweet surprise. The blond smiled, and sucked some frosting off Tony's neck before moving down to lick the crumbs off the other man's torso, dragging his tongue along the contours, and listening to his lover moan beneath him.
They each took a shot, and the game was ready to begin. "Count of three. One, two, three!"
It was easier said than done.
A half-naked Steve stood there looking at him, his eyes serious as always. He looked as if he had just rolled out of bed; his hair was still not brushed out, and the fact that he was dressed in sweats with no shirt, well that furthered his suspicion. The brunette motioned for him to come in, and the blond accepted. He took the bottle from Tony's mouth, still not saying a word. He examined the bottle and sat on the couch, his jeans making a noise as they slid across the soft fabric.
Tony was screaming into his pillow, and Steve was pretty sure he wasn't being too quiet himself. He reached around to Tony's front, pumping the other man's cock with the motion of his hips, wanting to get him off, wanting him to call out his name, to be the one to make Tony Stark, the Tony Stark, to beg for more.
Tony froze, closing his eyes to hold back the tears that threatened to spill. "I wish I knew." He whispered, and ran a hand over his face; he felt so tired... "I'm going to go take a nap." The brunette muttered, heading out, and almost running into someone. He looked up, glaring, ready to yell at the person, when his eyes met a pair of blue ones. "Steve!" Tony choked out. Oh god what did he hear?
"You want to join us blondie?" Tony raised his eyebrows, his old habits returning, and causing the girl to blush furiously and look away. "That's it, I'm taking you home." The soldier quickly turned around to apologize to Ashley, but she was gone. Steve sighed and picked up the napkin, shaking his head in upset.
“Hello American man! It is nice to see you could join us.” Thor laughed, wrapping the soldier in a hug. Clint and Natasha quickly stole the presents from Steve’s arms, before he could crush them. “Thor! What are you doing back so soon?” Steve asked, struggling to breathe.  “My father let me back for a day. I’m not staying, but he said the King of Asgard should spend his days as he pleases.” Thor grinned as he placed his friend back on solid ground.
Tony gave her a small smile. "Well how was your trip?" he asked, resisting the urge to pull away. "It was fine, first class paid by a very loving boyfriend." she giggled. "Only the best for you." He chuckled, and she pecked his lips.
