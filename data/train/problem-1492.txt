He laid his head on Sherlock’s chest, heard one faint beat of his heart and nothing more.
“I could snap you in two,” said Sherlock.
times have changed. Will you get it or do I have to go through back channels?”
So Sherlock had left the lamp off, and they’d made love by touch alone. It wasn’t the same as when only John was blind. It made locating the lube far more difficult, for one thing.
For the rest of the day, Harry seemed to have forgotten about John’s wardrobe, his love life, and the conjectural relationship between the two. She took a bath and made a shopping list that John went out and filled. They ate vegetable lasagna from Tesco.
Sherlock cleared his throat. “Once upon a time...”
They talked about small things — things that John would have normally considered too trivial or boring to share.
“Nevertheless…”
“I… erm…” was all John managed to get out before Mrs. Hudson poked her head back in.
“Iron?” It took a second for John to dredge the relevant fact from his sketchy knowledge of folklore. “He was a…?”
John closed his eyes and put his hand on Sherlock’s throat — feeling the movement of muscles and tendons as Sherlock kissed him. He swept his hand over Sherlock’s shoulder and down his arm. Sherlock was larger now, but other than that, he felt the same as when John touched him during the witching hour.
“Then you lay your hands gently on them, petting them, soothing them. You run your hands down my body — exploring.”
“I must rely on others to do the legwork,” said Sherlock, his lip curling momentarily. “They catalogue the scene, take photos, sometimes they even notice things. Nothing useful, of course, but as long as they’re thorough, I can usually find what I need.”
“As long as we’d like,” groaned Mycroft.
“You look so sweet, sunshine.”

Sherlock shifted in his chair. “I suppose they have some charm,” he said with forced nonchalance.

Molly didn’t look up as she said,
“You didn’t tell me you’d bought a new frock,” he whispered in her ear. He eyed the emerald green halter-top dress with no little appreciation.
I went for my bag, and in an instant, was by his side.
The clerk turned pink. “We receive a good number of donations, especially this time of year, there are quite a few bequests when members….” He waved a hand. “This book appears to be among a set accepted very recently without our usual careful examination and cataloguing.

“Let’s see, can’t be my maiden virtue, I lost that long before I met you.”
Mycroft met Lestrade’s gaze, which was strangle impassive.

“Don’t go yet.” The Detective Inspector leapt toward the kitchen, open a cupboard, and plopped a box on the counter.
Molly unfastened the top of her bathing suit and pulled it off.
Mycroft freed his erection and sheathed his prick in a condom. He leaned forward, bracing himself on the padded counter, and angled his prickhead just-so.
Just to see him. Just to be near him.
“Taste for yourself.” Sherlock’s mouth covered John’s in a hard kiss.
“Oh!”
“Holy Mary,” breathed Jim, turning and following Seb’s gaze. “Of all the coffee shops on all the corners in all the world, she had to walk into this one!”
Things he and I recognised at once.
The bed is too soft. The room, too quiet, too dark. He’s too rested, too clean, too alive…
“Do what?”
Lestrade was in agony. “Then what do you need to tell me?!” he moaned.
Lestrade grinned. “With all respect to your baking, these are my favourite kind of ging—“
“My first appointment’s at noon.”
Sometimes, an escape is required, and I find it there, in tiles and cushions and shining brass and polished woodwork.
Lestrade looked down, and the image his words conjured was too raw.
“Oh, you greatly underestimate my capacity to dream or philosophise, my dear man,” I said sharply.
“Couldn’t you?” He turned his head. “Look at that little table. What do you observe?”
Seb deserved all the blades he wanted, and Jim intended to see he got them.
Harvest time.
He imagines Mycroft launching himself over John or scurrying around the bed, that he might hide beneath the sheet and tongue-fuck Sherlock, unseen, unheard, until he comes. Until they both come, perhaps, if Mycroft’s hand is on himself as he rims Sherlock.

“Yeah?” John closed the doors of the van.

Jeanine whimpered.

Stella giggled. “He didn’t see me coming, did he?”
“Thanks. Bridesmaid dresses have such funny names. This one’s called…”
“Hand delivered,” said Lestrade. “And, yeah, there’s a note.” He turned the cup where written in an elegant hand was:
The puzzle had been completely disassembled and reassembled in a more complicated form.
John’s eyes traveled up and down Sherlock’s body, admiring the purple nightgown as well as the body it sheathed.
And because Mycroft had hoped, he’d worn the suit, the one that had caused the Detective Inspector several months ago to do a subtle double take. Only someone who had been paying very close attention would’ve noticed. Mycroft always paid very close attention.
Whack! Whack! Whack!
“Think this old man’s back can’t hold out until you come?” teased Lestrade.
Stella’s lips trembled against Sally’s as she came.
Mycroft and Sherlock glared out their respective windows. Then Mycroft pressed a button on the intercom. “Baker Street, please,” he said and leaned back against the leather seat.
She didn’t take her eyes from his as she pushed in, pausing every so often to study his expression, which never changed.
“Always. It’s my favourite night of the year.”
“Makes me think of Mummy Holmes. Might be nice to send her the recipe.”

But, oh, that tricky copper chloride. Copper creates blue, and the temperature must be within a very narrow range. Too hot or too cool, nothing, but when the elements are just right—BOOM!”
In an instant, John was up, and the mad chemist was down, and his beautiful face was covered in John’s spunk.
“I saw what I saw!”
“So soft. Oh, God, you were made for petting, weren’t you?
“It wasn’t easy. Or cheap. And I had many other things to do today.”
I dropped into my armchair.
After a few minutes of silence, Mycroft asked,

Seb knew it was ‘right there’ because he felt the trembling. “You’re going to be the naughtiest Girl Scout in the land, boss,” he groaned just before he spent himself.
“Yes,” he replied. “I took the liberty of one additional preparation.”
I steepled my fingers at my lips and closed my eyes. It was my signal to Watson and anyone who bothered to call that I did not wish to be disturbed.

Yes, that a good one. But let’s pluck another.
“Listen, Sherlock. You’ve got an interesting set-up here, the coffin and heavy curtains.”
“Can you do it?”
Lestrade gave a mock groan. “But wait, we haven’t even had a first date and you’re already whisking me away on holiday?”
Mycroft watched him go.
Chester had to get got, that was all there was to it, and if he had to get got in a place Jim wouldn’t normally be caught dead in—dead like Chester was going to be very soon—well, there was nothing for it.

As Holmes ran his fingers along the case’s interior, I noticed the discrepancy of the exterior bulk and the interior shallowness.
Jim made a show of straining against his restraints, but he would have cut off his arm—and someone else’s—before he’d fail to honour a bet with Seb. Jim was a psychopath, not an idiot.

“My dear, I’m a doctor! If you’re injured, I have things in my bag.”
“Oh God, Sherlock.” John sat in Sherlock’s lap with his costume bunched at his waist, grinding his bare arse into Sherlock’s glitter-and-pants-covered cock. Then he leaned back against Sherlock’s chest.

Mycroft tests a young Sherlock's intelligence.
Sherlock holds the apple in front of him, twisting the dowel, examining the half-devoured fruit from all sides.
John doesn’t know where Sherlock’s been. Maybe the lab. Maybe a case. Maybe getting blown in some alley. Who can say? Not John. John isn’t the one who can tell a life story by the mud on a trouser cuff.

I hoped that you’d forgo your plan, and what a wonder it was when I saw that you had, the day that you walked into that laboratory at Barts.”
“No,” said Seb, after a quick glance.
“Lovely! Don’t understand a word, but lovely.”
He sighed. “I haven’t anything for you for Christmas, my Queen, except devotion.” He neared her and licked the snowflakes from her neck with the tip of his tongue. He caressed her racing pulse and felt his own leap response.
“Doctor, this is my older sister, Violeta. She heard of my injuries from my landlord and insists on taking over the care of me.”
Scrape, scrape, scrape.
He fondled her until she moaned and turned in his arms.
Sherlock returned the gloss and compact to the purse. He drew out a few notes and studied them.
When he’d finished, we stared at each other in silence, the exchange temporarily driving out all thoughts, at least in my mind, of the horror we’d witnessed some hours before.
It probably didn’t help that when it came to doing
“Want to hear a story?” asked Sherlock. His voice was coming from near the doorway now, and John could hear him getting comfortable on the sofa.
“Broken.”
“Anything else?” asked John.
John stifled a giggle. “Oh that’s… that’s excellent.”
John’s other senses felt bigger in a way that they hadn’t while he wore the blindfold. He no longer had the anchor of knowing that Sherlock could see. They were at sea and navigating the dark together.
Later, when they sat in Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen, finishing the first meal Sherlock had eaten in 132 years, Sherlock apologised for frightening them both.
“Military man,” said Sherlock with great certainty. “Army surgeon,” he added only slightly more speculatively. “You’ve been in the Middle East.”
“How am I supposed to do everything I want in an hour?” asked Sherlock, his nose brushing John’s sack.
John woke to the sensation of falling.
John tore his eyes off Sherlock long enough to make a quick assessment of the room. It appeared largely unchanged from four days ago.
John didn’t have time to feel guilty about it though. He could see cobwebs collecting in the corners of the room.
I’m made to endure for over a century, that simple comfort is denied me. It sits right there, where I can see it every day. If I move it, hide it, it turns up there within the hour to taunt me with its presence.”
“Or be ravished myself. As long as I can do all that, I’m ready for anything.”
He had no idea if it was necessary, but he didn’t want another dry wank, if that was what Sherlock had in mind.
They talked about Brexit and football and other safe subjects that were unlikely to get them angry — with each other anyway.
“I prefer to be alone for that part.”
“You should really be more careful about your language even in just a pocket dimension of Faerie,” said Sherlock.
“He made me look like this,” Sherlock reminded him. “That’s certainly within his power. He found Merryweather — I’ve no idea how — just after this woman essentially killed him, and offered to keep him alive — ish.”
“Don’t go.”
John cleared his throat. “I see. I should warn you — lube tastes awful.”
“Alright.”
“Lucky he had a friend nearby,” said John.
“I’d… kiss you, I guess. If you’d like that.”
“Maybe I wouldn’t need so much fresh air if the flat didn’t smell of burnt rubber and old eggs?” John observed.
Sherlock slid his prick into John’s hole. He leaned forward, reached forward, and squeezed a pendulous breast.

“Well we did eat an awful lot of it. Honestly, I think I’ve had enough gingerbread to last me until next Christmas.”

“’Fraid not. How about a martini, shaken, not stirred?”
Mycroft’s mouth is moving against the side of his neck. “Take my time? Make you beg?”
“Holy Mary!” exclaimed John at the smoke puffing out of the flask.  He hurried toward the stranger, who fixed him with a hard stare.
“What did you bring originally?”
He glowed, wan and emaciated, with powder-white hair which hung longer than I’d ever seen on him. He wore a kind of long, billowy nightshirt. He might have been the spectral remains of a Romantic poet who died of consumption.
Someone else took the seat on the other side of MacCoy, but his back was turned.
Jim kissed her cheek.
But this job required him to blend in with this posh crowd and, without protest or complaint, he did.
Sherlock, taking his cue, rolled onto his back and began to perform: spreading his legs, twisting this way and that, slapping his buttocks, tweaking his nipples, and, eventually, dry humping his way across the bed.
It was, indeed, a straightforward case of murder until the testimony of one witness. She was a striking woman, dressed in a deep mauve frock and matching hat with veil. One needn’t have been a world-famous detective to recognise her trade by her appearance and mannerisms. Her evidence confirmed it.
And then they settled into their rotation. A prick inside her, a hand fondling her, a pair of lips kissing hers, and another suckling her tit, careful, she made certain, not to disturb the lipstick prints.
Let him, let him, let go, and let him.
“I’m John. Nickname.”
And just like that, the breakfast table was clean (Mrs. Hudson was later to remark dryly it was astounding how apt Mister Holmes was at housework given the right motivation) and the puzzle pieces were spilled upon it.
Jim peppered Molly’s face with kisses as the sound of gunfire and glass breaking erupted above them. “Too rough, my Queen. Too rough by half. I’m so sorry.”

He groaned aloud.
“—it’s you. You’re amazing. Wait, you had a bad day? Sherlock?”

“Show him somewhere else. I’ve got work.” Molly took a long swig and handed the flask back to Sherlock. “Thank you so much for everything. Now get out of here or I’ll call Mycroft, then security.”

The face itself has changed a bit over the years, but the expression, the reaction, is immutable.

John stifled a groan. “I’m sorry for putting you in this position.”

“Oh, yes, Daddy.”
“Have it your way.”
The pain blinds him.
“Oh my,” said John. “That’s it?”
“At your service,” said Lestrade.
“Fabulous. Go with that.”
“Seb, are you telling me that my loose end is still dangling because you’re too busy stuffing your face? I sent you to New York because the job’s important and I needed my best man on it. So get on it!”
Irene gasped. “Oh, my.” Molly’s pained face worried her. “Does it hurt?”
“Really pretty,” added Kate, encouragingly.
“Sorry. How long have we been playing intergalactic chess?” asked Lestrade.
Not real stars, of course, not even New Year’s Eve pyrotechnics. These were horizontal flashes of bright pink against darker pink, the inside of Sherlock’s own eyelids, the result of muscles and nerves and penetrating light, a normal biological process.
Lestrade grunted and held up a jug, empty save for tiny amount of red liquid. “I saved you a taste.”
There were lips on his neck and a filthy whisper in his ear.
“I don’t blame you, mind. I’d fuck a bloke myself for less.”
“Yeah.” He stepped into the entryway. “Alright. Thanks.”
The music halted abruptly.
“—Gay, John. You’re not gay.”
“That’s no longer common knowledge?”
“Irregular collectors of information?”
John suspected that having a nice long brood hadn’t produced the results Sherlock was hoping for.
“That’s… wow,” said John.
Sherlock spent the next few days sulking. John knew Sherlock was sulking because, rather than sulk in his room, Sherlock was sulking all over the sitting room and, occasionally, the kitchen.
“Are you naked?” asked Sherlock.
“They can do other things, surely.”
John folded his arms across his chest, whacked himself in the shin with his cane, and decided it was best to just take the rather comfy-looking armchair opposite Sherlock’s. “So who cursed you? And why?” Although, truth be told, John had the beginnings of a hypothesis about that second part.

Just enough heat to maybe take the edge off Sherlock’s cold.

“Influenza is serious. You need to see to your sister.”

Sherlock snorted.

“Me neither. Goodnight.”
“How did you know I’m unemployed?” John realised the stupidity of the question as soon as it left his mouth. “Never mind. I go for walks…”
Sherlock opened his hand and closed it again around both of their shafts, so that they glided alongside each other with every thrust.
Sherlock smiled. “
John picked it up and read the article. He suspected by the tone of the piece, that it had appeared in a rather sensationalist sort of publication. The gist of the story was that charges of murder against a woman in the U.S. had been dropped when the husband she had allegedly killed turned up at a logging camp in Canada with no memory of the violent death to which she had already confessed to subjecting him.

John and Sherlock discuss the sorts of punitive measures that were taken against men who were caught having sex with other men in the Victorian era.  Blood, beatings, and attempted rape by deception are also mentioned.

Maybe I’m attracted to all of this…” He waved his hand at Sherlock’s body. “…because I also like all of that.”
“Yeah.”
John went to the sitting room and stood beside Sherlock’s chair. “So you’re hoping that Detective-Inspector… erm?”
John turned the knob and walked in.
“Do you like that idea?”
“Sometimes there are others.”
“I could use it to write, I suppose. My therapist has been encouraging me to…”

Sherlock went silent then, apparently watching the movie.

“But when one of them conceals a fatal crime, much less so?”
“That’s very troubling, indeed,” said Holmes. “So sorry to have trespassed on your time.”
But in a minute, a stranger appeared.

And so, the dying days of winter are, for one vampire, much like the dog days of summer.
“You’re sparkly, John!”
“But I’m grateful no one, including you, was hurt.”
And that was just what he got.
Oh, yes?
I dropped her rather ungallantly on the ground and then collapsed beside her, panting and sputtering and mumbling incoherent assurances which were probably closer to madman’s ramblings.
A pale chartreuse shadow eclipsed the sun.
“Uh-huh.” Lestrade licked his lower lip.
“See, Watson?” Holmes’ tone was pure vindication. “There’s nothing like a driftwood fire when it gets started at last, and our little one is on its way.”
“Is it?”
She leaned forward, towards the camera and rocked a bit, letting her breasts hang and sway for his enjoyment. She remembered riding him and the way his hands guided her up and down and played with her breasts and caressed her stomach and buttocks.
Naked except for those woolly socks!
“Please don’t stifle yourself on my account.” I sank my teeth gently into his skin. “It’s incredibly arousing.”
John walked until he began to break a sweat beneath his heavy coat. He walked until his leg screamed. He collapsed on one end of a park bench, his ragged breaths forming foggy clouds in the dark.
“The ones you got for recovering that painting?”
He smiled. “Are the peacemakers…”
Holmes and I stood by as Lestrade interviewed the grieving cousin of the late Angus Unworthy whose body lay on the floor.
As Irene wept, Kate felt her eyes sting as well. She did nothing to stop either flow of tears. She caressed Irene’s face and hair and kissed her sweetly and gently and whispered over and over.
“…so I decided to don a disguise and do some sleuthing. I successfully tracked Rako from the docks to a gambling hall and then to The Mystique, but I was spotted by a pair of the individuals entrusted with security and order at that establishment, and they let me know I wasn’t welcome. They might have killed me if…”
It took a minute to find her rhythm, but she found it.
The coffee shop was overcrowded.
Jim collapsed back with a groan when Seb swallowed him anew.
Sherlock opened a third drawer.
Mycroft was Lestrade’s only regular. Mycroft’s schedule, or so it seemed, was as bizarre as Lestrade’s, and Lestrade would smile as he watched the purple square marked 314 on his appointment app disappear, then reappear the following week.
But, really, what was the point of running a successful international criminal enterprise if you couldn’t take a few minutes for yourself?
“Good. Because you’re a shit hypnotist.” John shook his head, then grinned. “What was that shagging bit about?”
“There’s a false bottom,” I said.
Moriarty gave a rueful smirk. “That’s final?”
“Naturally. It’s what’s been missing all these years.” Mycroft kissed Sherlock’s bare shoulder, then scraped the skin with his teeth. “Someone to balance us.”
“That’s right. Come for me, my good, good girl.”
“Did you…?”
Giggling.

“No, a cream-filled pastry.”
“I tried to find an angel to go on top of the tree,” said Sally in a husky voice as she reached up to caress Stella’s lovely breasts, "but none of them were even remotely suitable for this household.”
It was then that Doctor Watson extolled the benefits of the English seaside cure. The siblings Lomax set off that very morning.
“Believe it or not, Margaret, common criminality is a refreshing change for me.” She shot a rueful look at the ceiling. “How was the christening?”
“Someone’s doctored the drawing!”
“Christ, I don’t know which seems more impossible: you, solving the Jack the Ripper case or you, wearing a mistletoe hat.”
“Not just Alpha. You’re a Sentinel.”
“Gawk at,” interjected Holmes.
“Yes. Don’t start yet. I am going to get my notebook and the blindfolds.”
He made a theatrical flourish.
John and Greg grinned and pointed toward Sherlock and Mycroft. Sherlock and Mycroft immediately raised their glasses and donned expressions of faux cheer.
“Brother following o’er t’ brink,” interjected Holmes. He whistled and made a diving motion with his hand.
And a star. They’d paid a pretty penny for it, but the boss had been right, it’d been perfect.
“The public library?! Since when do they stock sex toys?!”
“Hello?”
Sherlock paused and met his gaze and nodded. Then he jerked his head and quirked a wicked smile. “I’ve got an oral fixation.”
“So am I, Holmes.”
“Ah, but the tea?”
Driven snow is white chocolate liqueur, blackstrap rum, ginger liqueur, and ice.
He kissed her lips gently and pulled away. She bit at his mouth savagely and did not.
“Are you living nearby?”
“He could be between us, Sherly. Sucking your cock while I fuck his hole. Or vice versa. I’m also generous. We’re a generous, almost chivalrous, pair.”
John stumbled out of the pub.
“New skill acquired?”
“Hello!” said Sally, coughing. “Are you…?”
My soul recoiled once more. What was he doing here among the infamous and the black-hearted?
Your invitation did surprise.
Sherlock nods.
“So, how did you do clear the garden?” asked Molly breathlessly.
He woke, refreshed and confused, and with a prick as stiff as wood.
“Breathe, please. Again. Again.”
I rallied on the final day of the month and invited Sherlock and Doctor Watson to dine with me at the club. We ate early but feasted handsomely. It was very late when I finally bundled them into a hansom cab, fill to their hat brims of our cellar’s finest vintage port, and sent them on their way.
My cry was the oft repeated lament when clients compensated me with goods rather than currency.
Margaret bit her lip. “Phillip died six months ago.”
Holmes glanced at the undisturbed pile of morning newspapers, then scanned his breakfast companion’s face.
“C’mon, you mangy cur, I don’t have time for—”
“Hi, lads!” cried Lestrade. “Missing something?”
“I know what you like.”
“Put my half on a little cottage for when I’m too old to catch crooks.”
“Are you going to come on our cocks?” asks Mycroft.
Sherlock’s body jerked.
Sherlock howled.
“See, Watson? I told you there weren’t any biscuits in that tin,” said Holmes as he extricated himself from beneath the kitchen table.
“Left.”
For Kinktober Day 9: Pegging
Seb held the silicone fist up in one hand and balled his other hand beside it. “See? The exact same thing but 30% smaller.”
“Here’s where I find you!”
“Simple chemistry.”
“About the case?” I queried.
“Happy birthday. On the house,” said the barman.
“Not the nightingale,” I said ruefully.
Holmes nodded.
“This.”
Kate quickly cleaned herself, slipped back into a dressing gown, and circled the bed until she was in front of Irene’s head.
“No, no,” he agreed.

Because I had an actual dream about the character Moriarty this past weekend and he  was very nice.
“You can do anything you want with me, my queen.”
Watson said,
Holmes lips curled in an amused twitch. He blinked.
“It can be,” admits Mycroft. “I prefer to sleep,” he pauses, “suspended.”
A salty dog is gin (or vodka) and grapefruit juice with a salted rim.
“Nah. He said things like ‘You’re my fixed point in a changing age’ and ‘I’d be lost without you’ and ‘You’re the whetstone of my mind.’”
But that didn’t stop me, of course, from riding the train of thought to its destination.
“You’re not traveling this weekend?”
“Perhaps. Let’s ask him.”
“No, but I'll keep you company if you desire it.”
And as I turned, there was the strike of a match and a cry,
“Ha! Fifteen!”
“More skin?” asked Sherlock.
“Uh, yeah, but I’d rather meet as few people as possible on the way.”
Title: Strong Spirits (aka Revenge of the Quilt)
“No, thank you.”
He rummaged in the bottom of the paper bag and found what he sought.
“This,” said Lestrade as he poured a small bit of thick white concoction in the mugs, “is a Naughty Snowman.” He set the thermos flask down on the desk and raised one mug. “Here’s to a very Naughty Snowman getting the melting he deserves.” He waggled his eyebrows and grinned.
I scowled not at Holmes’s words, but rather at his waistcoat, which peeked out from a dark blue dressing gown.
“Dear me,” said Mrs. Hudson. She squinted at the note in the girl’s hand. Then she took a step back. “The man who came to see about the flue brought his young son with him. The lad was no doubt bored while his father worked. I suppose we should be thankful he only applied his vulgar scribbling to Mister Holmes’ note and not something more valuable.” She cast a wary look in the direction of the Stradivarius and was relieved to find no phallic doodling upon the case.
“Come on,” he cooed. “Come up and play. Come out and be played with. Don’t you want to be sucked?” He began to pepper kisses about the growing bulge in the thick fabric. “That’s it. Oh, God, I need your prick, John.”
“He should be in prison!”
“Fuck, that’s good.”
When the boulder roared into the lake, I raced up the ridge.
“No? What about a Pot O’Gold? A Shamrocked?”
“I want to…”
John opened his shirt and pressed his chest to Sherlock’s back. Then he leaned back and, looking at the two dark stains, said, “Shirt’s all wet. Guess you’ll have to take it off.”
A Lust Gin and Tonic is gin, strawberries, and pink pepper tonic.
The car blocked most of the light from the street.
“And much less pleasant than this,” I replied with a gentle smile. Then I looked down at my two features of interest peeking out from the mass of blankets.
A rude gesture is flung Seb’s way.
“We all wish that, Doctor.”
“Sorry, sorry. I meant to growl, ‘Well, too bad. You’re in one!’ and then bite your cock off.”
“On our knees.”
He exhaled deeply as he surveyed the landscape. Then, with a quick glance at the note-book, which I’d placed on the grass between us, he said,
“I shall return shortly for the rest,” she said mildly as she exited the room.
Holmes met me at the bathroom door.
In a few minutes, their glasses clinked.
“How do you want it?” groaned John.
“Hush, Mister Reindeer, or I’ll fit you with a bit and bridle to match your lovely antlers.”
“Can’t one hard-working friend stop by and see another hard-working friend in her workplace and bring her an Iced Cascara Coconutmilk Latte?” He produced the beverage from behind his back.
, “is always available. I am always hungry for you.”
“What’s your name, love?”
“And how many cocks you take here?”
“Alone protects me.”
Sherlock smirked. “That’s not coffee he’s stirring. It’s Hotel Chocolat’s dark cocoa supreme. Lestrade wouldn’t spend that kind of money on a hot beverage, so it’s a gift, and that,” he nodded to a thermos flask on the desk, “is not his. Arrived this morning. With a note?”
“Jacuzzi.”
“Okay, Alpha-y strength! I take you in my arms!”
John’s head was hidden by the short yellow-and-black skirt. He was nuzzling and licking the pair of tiny black knickers stretched across Sherlock’s erection.
“Then what the hell are we still doing here?!”
Sherlock sank his teeth into John’s thigh when Mycroft slammed into him for the last time.
Sherlock wanted to focus his attention on John’s mouth and the wet, tight heat that was quickly enveloping the length of his prick and the exquisite, yes, pretentious, but, in truth, no other word sufficed, pleasure that was resulting.
“Not with you in my corner. I didn’t kill her sister, and I’m glad the bastard who did is going to eat his Christmas pudding in hell. Sherlock, you were magnificent, and I’m not just saying that because it was my arse on the line. Really, you outdid yourself.”
I knew myself to be alone, but I still cast a furtive look about the room. Naughty thoughts at the breakfast table about one’s friend and fellow lodger were unbecoming.
“Fuck, Sherlock!”
Summary: Lestrade seeks assistance.
“Fuck me, John. Please.”
He, however, laughed.
A 'Remember, Remember' is apple brandy, cider, honey, lemon juice, and mulling spices.
“Holmes, if you are doing something dangerous this evening, I would like to accompany you. Or at least be available for proper triage when you return.”
Sherlock finds a reanimated corpse that resembles himself. Clone sex.
They will fuck, eventually. They’ll slick and probe and breech and sink and sheath and thrust, with all the heady acoustical accompaniment and the twisted sheets and the sweat pooling between shoulder blades. There will be pleas and urgings and profane cries swallowed, bitten short.

“Have a seat, please.”
“You like those, too? What about scary films?”
“Ride Seb’s, suck yours,” replied Molly. “On the rug.”
I looked up and nodded.
An air mail is rum, lime juice, honey syrup, champagne. Served with a stamp on the glass!
“Yeah? Do you want to…?”
“Perfect,” said Sherlock, reaching for his mobile and tapping the screen. “War hero wants Afghan tea to end his heat. That’ll give us twenty-eight minutes. How do you feel about lying close and embracing as a sign of affection?”
“You won’t sit comfortably for days,” Sherlock reassured him. He eased his own pants down and rubbed his prick in the cleft of John’s arse. “Feel how hard I am. When I get like this, you know I’m insatiable, especially when you parade your sweet hole like a tart. No pants? Naughty John.”
“I shall feel rather foolish unpacking what I have just packed, Holmes, and sending the cart away.”
Mycroft looked at the puzzle and smiled and realised something very important:
I do remember saying,
This is a follow-on to
John didn’t know how he’d got here. Well, that wasn’t true. He knew exactly how he’d got here, but it beggared belief all the same.
Pairing: Holmes/Watson
John doesn’t know whether to shrug it off or not. He opts for ‘not.’
Molly frowned and tapped her tablet. She shook her head. “No new arrivals since early this morning.”
A loud snort produced a moment of breathlessness in my companion, which was sufficiently disturbing to wake him. He muttered to himself, then grunted happily at the apple’s discovery.
John padded towards Sherlock and licked his cheek.

She was so beautiful.
“You are marvelous,” he said with undisguised admiration. Then he kissed her lips. “How? Please tell me.”
The parish clock boomed twelve.
“Oh, God, yeah,” she moaned, “hard, please, Jim. Hurt me just a little. I want to feel it tomorrow.”
Lestrade ground his lower half into Mycroft’s. “Think again.” He jerked out of a garishly printed shirt.
“Absolutely. You have my number.”
“It will be my pleasure.”

“Um, better not risk it, let’s walk—very fast.”
“I was hoping you’d say that.”
“And you’re here. An ocean away, as you say. Flattering. And arousing.”
Sherlock smiled. “I meant the hand job.”
Unicorn Kisses is what pops up when you google glitter + cocktail. It's purple and sparkly and sweet. Vodka-based.
I enjoy watching Holmes at work, for while gardening is mere hobby for me, I consider the hives as much my companion’s vocation as solving crimes was. He looks so at home, with his bees, his cone and bellow.
For DW Octobercest and Kinktober 2019 Day 2: Begging.
“Oh!” She closed her eyes and smiled and hummed. “Like honey dripping. Let’s keep it going. Switch before it fades.”
“Yeah, you ate too many. And they aren’t so appealing when they’re—“
“I didn’t know what I was doing.”
Just before supper, Watson placed the final piece in the frame.
“…I don’t know, Detective Inspector.”
He rubbed the front of his trousers.
“It’s happening, gorgeous. Right now. You don’t have to wait anymore. I’ve got you. I’m going to give you exactly what you need.”
Jim winked at Molly and strolled back to the fire whistling.
Lestrade produced a red-and-white striped band and set it across his head from ear to ear. Affixed to the band was an arch that extended forward with sprig of green with white berries hung from the tip.
“Yeah, that’s right, baby, filling you up again, such a sweet arse. Come here, let me tongue it.”
This ficlet builds on the previous one, and there are plans for a final segment following this one.
“The time you lured me to top secret military base under false pretenses, dressed up like an alien, strapped me to a table and shoved eggs up my arse to be the ‘Best First Date Ever’? Yes.” He grinned, then looked about. “So, dinner and a film? Is it as conventional as it sounds? Or is there something popping out to get me?”
“More!” Sherlock’s heels clicked on the floor as he stomped, then wobbled.
“Maybe he is,” said John, returning to the sitting room. “But how would you know? It’s like that tree falling in the forest. Unless, or until, he starts sending you taunting clues, where would you start looking for the perfect crime from the hermetically sealed comfort of your own flat?”
Of course, John could’ve brought the kettle and tea things in the bedroom, but that seemed wrong. He couldn’t do what was required of him with the tea things watching.
Somewhere in my torpid mind, a penny dropped all the way to my cock.
Sherlock’s gaze narrowed, then he smirked and ran a hand up the centre of John’s chest. “That was just a rehearsal,” he purred.
“But no bouquet for me?”
“Eleven. Oh, I didn’t mention that? Details.”
Just like when she rode him. When he thrust up in her tight pussy. He tightened his grip on himself and began to stroke faster.
“Holmes.”
Toby’s meowed reply expressed his hope that the company was bringing appropriate gifts for the true proprietor of the residence.
“Meaning ‘fantastic extravagance.’”

“Like this one?” Moriarty ran his hand down the length of Sherlock’s shaft.
“Me, too, but I shall be alert to any irregularity on the train!”
“But that was years ago. She married another fellow. The jilted one graduated and became a doctor. Sir Adrian went on to get his eyeful somewhere else. Water under the bridge.”
Sherlock fell to his knees, helping John strip Molly from the waist down. Then he stood and John took hold of Molly’s calves.

“Is this the point where I tell you that I don’t go home with every fellow who flaunts a pumpkin-spiced, mocha-drizzled, java-chipped, whipped-cream-topped obscenity in front of me?”
And then Kate was being led inside the cosy cabin and peeled of her many layers.
“Yes?” I prompted, like the good whetstone I was.
A mickey finn (the cocktail) is  crème de menthe, ice, pastis, dry vermouth, gin.
“He can come in, Stamford.”
“But it might be important.”
“Bedlam?”
“Fuck, yes.”
“Holmes, would you be disturbed if I asked you to vow never to shove a squash full of angry bees up my arse?”
“Holy Mary!” breathed John. He glanced at Sherlock, whose face was buried in his hands.
“Yes, but how?”
Mycroft drew apart the sides of his dressing gown and yanked down his pyjamas and fed Sherlock his prick. Then he released his clothing and began to rub Sherlock’s cheeks. He loved how they changed when Sherlock took him.
“I am making you hard, I hope. And encouraging you to read my monograph on glitter.”
“I will be there. We learn from our own mistakes as well as those of others.”

He set the case on the counter and opened it.
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
SOD OFF, BROTHER MINE!
“Do you know what I was thinking?”
“Sebbie.”
“She simply smirked and said she thought as much.”
Moriarty tilted his head and said, “Sideways, then. Together.”
“More dancing,” said Irene as Kate adjusted the skirt of Molly’s gown, which was slit in several places. “Then the devil worshippers will taste the virgin.”
I've been telling myself this little bedtime story for the past few nights. If you think you'd read more, drop me a comment, and I'll contemplate fleshing it out. I've not read a whole lot of ACD Omegaverse, so I'm not certain it should go beyond that bedtime story stage.
No sooner was Seb swallowing a mouthful of bitter seed than he was being yanked to his feet by a man half his size and at least two weight classes below him.
Perhaps there is some route by which we might both survive together and Moriarty be felled?
“Don’t worry, little lady. I’ll fix your wagon.”
“Yeah, nice waistcoat, by the way. Your tailor is still—“
“The one I lived with when..."
“Please, Detective Inspector, I’m a naughty little cockslut who needs his hole filled, please.”
“Please, John.” Sherlock palmed the front of his own trousers.
“John doesn’t know that I can make tea,” said Sherlock. “I’d prefer to keep that bit of knowledge a secret, if you don’t mind.”
Like a seed.

I scowled. “And I daresay she wouldn’t have been brought to justice if the attendees of this quaint village fete hadn’t included the great Sherlock Holmes.”
“But what I’d really like to do is open these trousers and help you out of this erection.”
Molly rolled her eyes and huffed. “Always a pleasure. So, are you just here to fuck with me?!”
First, there’s the soft light that breaks into the room like a seasoned thief. It rolls across the floor. When it reaches them, Mycroft’s hair and skin glow, and Sherlock yearns to touch that warmth.
The padlock, the click, is for show, an illusionist’s trapping. The confining mechanism is much more secure. Your prick will not be released until I free it, and no fumbling on your part will change that.
“Shall we move to the fire? There are cigars and strong spirits to be felt, uh, had.”
Jim Moriarty woke in a comfortable but unfamiliar bed. Feline eyes bore into his.
Mycroft’s hips lifted, thrusting gently. He gripped Sherlock’s hair in both hands and moaned Sherlock’s name as he came.
“Will you make Daddy happy and play with yourself, Sherlock? Will you play will that sweet pink lolly?”
Locks are meant to be picked. Cages are meant to be sprung.
“I was just following orders.”
I righted myself and looked in the mirror.
I leaned forward. “Your sources are good.”
“I heard something about you today.”
Sherlock hummed. “First drone’s always the most eager.”
“I think you’re set.”
“Sounds more like an invitation than an accusation, Mister Holmes.”
“Back to work, ensigns,” barked Lestrade, and, following his own order, he immediately sunk himself into his own work, the better to not betray his curiosity about what he’d heard.
Back and forth. This, too, pleases, but does not calm him.
“I can do that.”
Mycroft nuzzles behind his ear. “Happy Christmas, Gregory.”
“I never dreamed, Gregory, that—”
“As you wish,” he said and squeezed my hand.
“Fuck yeah and getting bigger by the minute.”
“Think nothing of it.”
Suddenly, John jerked up, reached back, and grabbed Sherlock’s head by the hair at the scalp. Then he pressed the side of his face to Sherlock’s and forced them both to look toward the silhouette.
Mycroft realised he’d been waiting five years for this moment and no other.
“I don’t give credence to rumour.”
Molly and Irene’s eyes met, and they laughed.
‘Naughty!’ mouthed Lestrade, casting an anxious glance at Mycroft, ‘Okay but be quiet!’
“It was a difficult situation. I’m glad I made the right decision,” said Lestrade.
“Did I?”
I was frozen. I don’t know if I was actually speaking or moving my limbs or simply wishing to do so.

Twenty minutes later, Sherlock knocked.
“Not in clever ways, either.”
“Sorry to hear that,” said Raffles, accepting the puppy and passing it promptly to me.
Grey eyes studied Watson carefully.
“Do you deny it, Watson?”
“Fuck, yeah,” said John, smiling. He curled a hand in Sherlock’s hair and met his dark gaze. “I’m your slave tonight.”
“Very well, but I will say the mood has shifted.”
“No, I’m needed on standby for a developing domestic situation.”
“Mycroft was just about to ply me with his fancy bourbon, but there’s a snag. Seems you’ve got the key to our naughty evening and we’ve got the key to yours,” said Lestrade, laughing uproariously.

“Case?” he called.
It was but a single moment, but I felt seen, and seeing, at once.
I broke the lock.
“Watson…”
Now what is that, I ask myself as I stand with my hand on the rake, surveying my realm.
“For goodness’ sake, Holmes, get on with the spadework!” I teased as I turned round and offered him my puckered hole.
Lomax nodded.
“All right.”
“Guilty. I didn’t know you were going to get yourself embroiled in a murder. That was my Christmas gift, I suppose.”
“The course of a doctor’s true retirement never did run smooth!”
“That’s good. Herb?”
“Not all of us look so distinguished in our natural state, Gregory.”
They sighed and, without suspecting, shared two thoughts.
“No. Richard hadn’t time to tell him.”
After another long while, Kate was very carefully sinking her cock into Irene’s cunt.
“This isn’t mine."
“Water. We need water.” John tumbled out of the bed. “God, those shoes,” he said as he spotted them in the corner.

Just then, the car lurched sharply to the right. John and Mycroft fell against Sherlock.
I frowned. “Why?”
“Your mobile. He says to call him when you wake and ‘Chester’s taken care of.’”

On the side table were plates and flutes, cut fruit in small bowls, and cakes and honey. A harem’s worth of cushions was piled on the floor. A grin split my face; my weariness evaporated like morning dew.
John laughed. He was too full of humour and… joy not to. He lifted his head and looked at Sherlock with a big, fond grin on his face.
“No kidding.”
“I can if you like,” said John, nuzzling his face into the crook of said neck. “Am I following a script?”
The door had a heavy brass knocker and, seeing no other course of action, John lifted the knocker and let it drop twice.
“I don’t eat,” he said. “And my sense of smell is very keen, making food just another source of torture, really.”
He pressed his forehead against Sherlock’s chest, against his heart. “I love you.”
“Maybe so, but I can’t believe God will not forgive me, nor you neither, sir, when He forgives murderers and worse.  If He even thinks it is so bad.

“And what did you do that was so ungrateful?”
“Yes. Christ, John. I want that.” Sherlock’s voice was tight with need.
He fell back on the old standby.
“Because the way I remember it,” said John, “you promised to grab my arse.” John found a spot on Sherlock’s trapezius muscle and tested out a gentle bite.
John grinned. “Alright.”
Sherlock followed suit.
“Are you in pain?” asked John.
John checked the applications installed on the machine. Sherlock came around the table and bent low enough to see the screen over John’s shoulder.
“It must be for you,” Sherlock said, wiggling his… digits as if John needed the reminder. After all, he had John pick up or open things for him five or six times a day on average.
“You didn’t enjoy it?”
And Sherlock drew a deep breath and roared — deep and wild and loud enough to shake the window.
“You’re not—” John reached out and took the tie from Sherlock’s claws. “Here. Let me.” He tied the belt securely with a slip knot.
Sherlock stood up, and John laid himself out on the couch with one foot still on the floor.
… pretty amazing, actually.
“Then she had a second baby.”
Life settled into a…
“Hmmm. Then what?”
John turned and strode to the kitchen. He threw the vial as hard as he could into the cast-iron sink, smashing it into a thousand shards.
“And that bothers you, so you go over it again when you’ve nothing better to do?”
“Fairly.”
Sherlock was silent for a moment.
That set them both off.
It wasn’t the release of drugs that Sherlock was looking for.
“Not while you’re holding it, for gods’ sake!”
No, that had to be it.
“Sherlock!” he shouted, wondering how long it would be before someone reported him to the police.
To his credit, Sherlock managed nearly 20 minutes of playing before he set the violin down and put his hand on John’s head. John suspected he was using the other to brace himself on his chair. A moment later Sherlock came, growling John’s name.
“I think it’s safe to say that I’ve never had a patient present quite like you,” said John, chuckling.
“And that’s what happened to you? You broke some rule you didn’t know about?”
He leaned forward and nosed his way under Sherlock’s horn to kiss his jaw. “Maybe.”
“I knew you weren’t in the fucking Hebrides!” Harry shouted down the hall behind him.
“Harry?” Something wasn’t right, but John couldn’t put his finger on it.
“Dr. Watson, you’re astounding.”
Right. His window. In his room, or at least, his until he figured out how to break the enchantment keeping him here.
suffering at the moment. Every time John checked, it was still beating steadily.
“Moriarty is wicked and obsessive and dangerous when he’s bored, which is most of the time.”
John could feel his hand trying to curl into a fist.
That out was obviously death — something Moriarty had gone to great lengths to deny Sherlock until now.
At approximately 5:30, he woke from another nightmare to a motionless and silent Sherlock. Still only half-awake, he’d immediately attempted to perform CPR — and broke Sherlock’s sternum on the first, and only, compression. John had nearly abandoned the whole idea of sleeping with him at that point, but Sherlock assured him that the fracture had healed almost immediately.
“You are magnificent, Holmes.”
Margaret glanced at the backseat. “Martha…”
“Molly?”
“Oof!”
John caught sight of Sherlock in the mirror. “Give us a minute, yeah?!”
Sherlock turned in the doorway. A dark suit blocked his retreat.
“Maybe this can be a thing for us, chess, nightcap, second nightcap. Until we get bored, of course.”
I tapped on the open page of the note-book, blank, save for four scrawled words.
“Why the fuck would I stop?”
I saw only trouser hems and slipper feet peeking out from the far end of the sofa.
These pumpkin lanterns on the ground,

MacCoy closed his eyes as if in prayer or sleep.
It was nice, being exposed like this, knowing there were a pair of grey-cat eyes out there watching.
“Hmm?” Sherlock seemed to snap back from wherever he’d gone. “Yes. His lover, a remarkable woman named Irene Adler, slipped the chain around his neck — under the pretence of some sort of erotic game, presumably. The tag on the collar had an ‘M’ on one side and ‘Property of The Woman,’ Ms. Adler’s
“Feel better, Harry.”
Now that he thought of it, the blanket did feel like the quilt that had covered his childhood bed, courtesy of his mother’s aunt. It had felt lovely, really, when he’d stripped down to his undershirt and pants and crawled under it last night.
“Alright, but leave yours on.”
“Sherlock.” John shook him.
“God, that’s—” John couldn’t help but push into Sherlock’s grip as well. “—that’s… fuck… amazing, but we’re going to need lube and a spot to lie down, or at least brace ourselves, if you plan to keep that up.”

Holmes sunk into his armchair.
“My dear Watson, I cannot bend the British justice system—.”
Sherlock opened his eyes.
Lestrade approached. “That’s it, lads. Let’s get out of our fairy kit and bid farewell to this enchanted forest.”
“So you like…?”
John smiled and shook his head.
“Happy Christmas, Boss.”
Sherlock licked up his shaft. “I’ve missed you, John.”
“Oh, Johnny!” she groaned. “Oh, my sweet puppy, yes.”
“Already wet.” His eyes were dark and glittering.
Sherlock’s eyes lit. “Want company?”

Christmas.
Mary’s death had proved the final impediment to fantastic notions overrunning common sense and decency and taking residence in my brain, and the most macabre of the collection was my obsession with recovering Holmes’s corpse. I spent days, and nights, planning a return journey to the dreaded cataract that had taken Holmes’s life. I’d decided that I would devote the rest of my days to single-handedly dredging every mile of tributary to recover his body. Then, or so was my scheme, I would bury him, digging the grave myself and laying him in his final resting place with a proper marker.
Mycroft’s eyes widened but he said, slowly and hesitantly, “To a melting Snowman.”

A gentle moustache kiss to his lashed spine.

John stared at Sherlock’s caged cock. When speech returned, he screamed.
“Mmm?”
“Presumably.”
“Odd bit of gambling—.”
Summary: Holmes visits the circus. Watson’s naughty thoughts get the better of him.
“Vigorous enough?”
“There are no Guides.”
Mycroft grunted again, but this time the noise was a discernible word.
“Detective Inspector, this is highly irregular,” began Mycroft.
“Suck them?”
“Sorry, mate. The other Dracula’s been chasing me for the last half an hour, and he can’t seem to take ‘no’ for an answer. I’d rather not make a scene; everybody seems to be having such a good time.”
In one smooth motion, Jim set his glass on the table, leaned forward and took her hand, and kissed it. Looking up at her, he asked,
That was spring, this, autumn.
Holmes and Watson investigate a case of grave-robbing.
“Gregory?”
“Good,” said Irene evenly. She wiped her face with her hands. A tiny smile curled her lips as she asked, “Will you fuck me?”
“Not-your-face is so lovely, but your lips and your tongue, oh, God. Can I—?”
“Yes, thank you.”
“Well, that’s one mystery solved,” said John. “But I wonder what’s with the Bible verse.”
“Work? For what
The next four ficlets are going to be linked by a (thin) plot thread. Here Moriarty mentions a Halloween party that Sherlock and Mycroft are going to attend. The next ficlet is the party and so on.
One appeared.
“They get lots of driftwood here on the Cornish coast, Captain Braddock says. A driftwood log must be a valued companion on this lonely stretch. Still a great many wrecks in those waters.”
Holmes poured tea. Watson poured coffee. Bessie brought a cup of hot cocoa and went as red as the strawberry jam when she was thanked gallantly in Spanish.
Lestrade yawned and stretched his arm across the back of Mycroft’s seat.
“Goodness, no,” Watson touched his upper lip reassuringly, “I’m stopping smoking, all use of tobacco, in fact.”
Title: Messers. Vigor & Co.

Lestrade grinned, “Good thing for you that Famine comes before—and after—War.”
John grunted.
The first bite was always the loveliest of the lovely.
He sighed.

Green stems as muddled as I was.
Cock filled Mycroft. Teeth sank into his shoulder. Thumb and finger pinched, then rolled his nipple.

Holmes and Watson are too late to catch a bank robber.
“Well, when you ask so nicely…but, uh, you really love me?”
“It’s over. I told them no more.”
John grinned. “I guess I’d better see to it. Wouldn’t want ‘Men in Kilts’ cleaning service,” he gestured to the lettering on the front of his shirt, “to get a bad reputation for leaving a job undone, even if I am just filling in for Stamford for the day.”
“The Adventure of the Blue Detective.” Watson shaves his moustache.
“You’ll only hurt me. A little. You hurt me all the time.”
“A work of art!” exclaimed Alphonse Unworthy with manic glee as he stood before his easel, dabbing from palatte to canvas. “A masterpiece! Angus concealed a lemon behind the cushion! But I was too clever for him and his fruit! I had a grapefruit in my pocket! And a palatte knife!”
“Like a wedding ring?” I asked.
John threaded his fingers in Sherlock’s hair. “I say I’m fine. Other doctors say I’m fine. But why don’t you come inside, judge for yourself?”
“Gladly. After your second orgasm, though, because—“
“You know how to have a good time.”
Sherlock was in the tub, on his knees, arms stretched wide, in unbuttoned shirt and pants.
“I told you I’d win,” said Sally, grinning.
“You’ve got to be kidding me—mmpfgh!”
“Oh, Mrs. Hudson, smoke!”
“Oh, settle down. Not one I would even consider.”
“Who, indeed?”
The case. No smut.
Irene was showing off the gargantuan cock hanging from her harness. Then she took up her position behind Molly.
Margaret shot her a glance, then batted her eyelashes in mock coquetry. “Well…”
Sometimes John can’t believe his luck. What are the odds that his path would cross that of someone as extraordinary as Sherlock Holmes? And added to those odds (or multiplied, John’s never been good at maths) are the odds that this extraordinary creature would accept, nay, desire John as a partner in every sense of the word!
Talk about filing things for later!
The stranger exhaled. John inhaled.
“What’s that?”

He rose, found his slippers and dressing gown, and padded downstairs to the guest bedroom.

Then, with a magician’s flourish, Seb produced a second, identical knife. He held it up for Jim’s examination while he continued thrusting.

John took the glasses and deposited them in the refrigerator. Then he returned and lifted the dressing gown by the hem. “Christ, you put a plug in.”
“That’s what they call braces in the States, John. I got them for Mycroft’s birthday. There’s a specialty shop in New York City he favours. I ordered them online. I don’t usually get the prat anything, but I suppose I was feeling sentimental.”
