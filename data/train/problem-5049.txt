about Steve. Something eternal and powerful - something that wasn’t listed in any of the official reports.
Tony felt a plunging sense of exhilaration, right to the very pit of his stomach... and an entirely different sort of thrill, when he realised that nothing was going to stop it. That there were none of the usual breaks on his reaction to Steve – there wasn’t going to
more, the longer I let it go on. And how can I let it go on, knowing it can’t go anywhere? Knowing it can only hurt him… And
Bucky, at least, was only being quiet because he was tired… and perhaps a little lightheaded. For those first few minutes, he’d been quite content to sit there and let the ache throb its way out of his calves, and enjoy the cool reprieve from the afternoon sun…
He dropped his arms immediately, and softened his face. Like Steve, he mistook her for a child, at first. And then he saw the lines around her eyes, and the bluish tint of her skin. He recognised that her face was alien… but still, the expression was so familiar.
“And, look – I’m not an expert on Anni-Varian social interaction, maybe if you don’t have shame, you don’t have lies, or whatever” Tony carried on, breezily, “But, on human beings, you’re just going to have to trust me. I know it probably seems an irrational mess of contradictions, to you – and it is – but this is what I do. So, since I’m not telling you how your guys think, don’t tell me how my guys talk, okay?”
to go along with whatever intimacy came afterwards, if it proved to be a fundamental part of it – even if he was mad at Tony, or dealing with his own issues, or just not in the mood?
Sometimes he thought of Steve begging to be bitten… And in an instant Tony would remember that that was terrifying, and exciting, and disgusting, and soothing, and vindicating in two entirely separate directions… And it was a crap shoot as to which line of thought he followed for the next few seconds.
“…Like the night Obie bit me,” came out as a whisper. Tony dropped his eyes before he could see Rhodey’s reaction – but he heard the sudden intake of breath.
making him feel like this, for the fact that Tony would never be good enough for Steve, for the fact that he simply
Steve could hardly bring himself to look. He was fighting the growing urge to scream at Adam to shut up – to just let him panic, right now. All traces of his earlier inebriation had completely evaporated under the white-hot fear coursing through him. This creep had the power to destroy
, I think I know where they’d be doing both of those things …” He pointed to a rough little diagram of The Facility that he’d sketched out in squares “So, you know the main corridor we walked down when we went on that
He found a guard cowering in the darkness, right in the middle of being shocked to her core by the sound Tony had just made. He saw the semi-professional marksman stance dissolve completely, as she registered that Tony was something
The background noise had fallen away now. There was no room left to wonder if he was a terrible person, or the relative wrongs at play… or even what was about to happen…
Now, it was only too clear that he’d just been grasping for some structure - some distraction, even - to help stave off a potential mental crisis…
And he’d feel so disloyal anyway, if he and Bucky got into a discussion of Tony’s life behind his back.
But still, Tony knew. He knew all the ominous thoughts going through Bucky’s mind, all the unnatural ideas that had just flashed up. Tony recognised every part of that reaction, from the panic to the cover-up. He
“Well, she’s seen me, anyway.” Steve mused, reaching out to take the final drink. Thinking he’d clear the table, before they took a break from this. “Do you want to go looking for her again?”
Steve wrapped his arms tight around Tony, arching into him, parting his lips the second Tony kissed him again.
And then he watched, in slow motion, as Tony flashed an empty smile and made to lead Steve past the photographer with that same easy confidence-
And he remembers… He remembers the smell of blood, and the screech or tortured metal… the sound of people crying…
“It’s… I just… I need a minute here and this is all…” Tony muttered, still not looking in Steve’s direction.
Tony ignored that final, spiteful whisper and recommitted himself to his original plan. Reminding himself that it wasn’t about forever, it was about right now. Telling himself that this was undeniably for the best, right now.
choice Steve. It wasn’t ‘a’ mistake you made, in the moment, under the conditions. It’s a mistake you made every day you saw me after that. Every time I thought we were just having a chat, that I knew who I was talking to. And,
dollars – and I assumed he’d said it wrong. Because, at the time, I was thinking… I remember, when I was a kid, my mother raving about the injustice of Henry Ford having a hundred million dollars to spend – and Mary Kelly, from next door, rolling her eyes and telling her that
“But no, I just finished a meeting,” Tony carried on breezily. “Made the mistake of ‘quickly’ checking my email before I left the room.”
Steve’s vision flashed with stars, his spine jarring with the inhuman effort it took to stay still and quiet. A more immediate desperation flared up in him, a wordless urgency shouting in his head.
“The clothes they’ve given us,” Nat replied. A cold feeling of dread rose up in Tony’s chest as he realised…
,” Tony hissed, as he began to move faster, his hand moving on Steve’s cock in time with his hips. Steve moaned, rocking back against him now, searching for that release with increasing desperation as grew closer and closer to it.
Steve felt Tony unfasten his jeans with quick, efficient fingers – and then press another warm, slow kiss to that newly exposed, especially sensitive skin. Steve let go of a sharp hiss, all of his muscles contracting as Tony let his lips trail an inch lower.
So, he found the nearest empty couch and fell into it, tugging Tony onto his lap. Tony immediately wriggled closer, pinning Steve between his knees and grinding against him-
“The thing is Steve…” Tony sighed. And then there was that little, almost self-conscious smile that had
… All those violations and cruelties that Steve had never had the chance to address, that he’d been forced to let go…
And then Steve melted into a puddle, lying flat out on the patio, chest still heaving, without an ounce of resistance left in his body.
“Oh my God, where are the others,” Tony managed, breathlessly, fighting the temptation to throw his arms around him, he was so relieved.
And Tony had just decided that he believed him. That there was nothing useful to be gained from this man. That it was time to toss him aside and carry on down to the basement-
that connection, I suppose,” he took a deep breath, and ran a hand over his face. “And I don’t know whether Talleroy’s interest in the serum, or any of the information they used to get to this stage, is based on what they’ve learned from Hydra – but that
expertly… Or, everyone is always ready to say something mean about you, for no reason, so you’re always in there first, saying something before they do, or cutting yourself off from people in advance, and…”
For so long, Steve had blindly accepted a certain definition of these things… That selfish and human were basically interchangeable. That any slip in his constant efforts would be a failing of some kind.

were tumbling through his head. Hoping Bucky would be okay, trying to think of what he’d do if something went wrong, trying to figure out how it all worked… Tony could almost hear it all in Steve’s voice.
More real than anything Steve had ever experienced in his life. Free from the self-deception and prejudices and assumptions that were just the background noise of every moment. Free from the need for words, more than the social construct of language. Steve just
That same frantic hunger for more, growing more painful and desperate with every second. That feeling of being repeatedly pushed up against the very edge of himself, never quite being able to push through it. The feeling of complete and total fullness swelling up in him again and again – the feeling of falling away from it over and over. The frustration growing at the same pace as the pleasure. That pressure building, under his skin.
How easily Steve and Tony shared affection, how happy they looked - how natural it was to be around it…
, Steve was already quite sure that Tony had never said he liked him. Steve had spent hours combing through every conversation they’d ever had… Sometimes looking for that, specifically.
about anything of substance, and hadn’t told him much about Steve, and was hardly enough to catch Tony up on the decades of social interaction he’d missed – still, Tony just felt like it would be like that again. That Steve was easy to talk to. That Tony
here that we can drink without getting stoned or drunk?” Tony asked him, with an irritable edge on his voice. Steve felt himself pinching back a smile - another sensation he knew from planet Earth. The mundane, run-of-the-mill warning not to smile too much, or at the wrong things, around Tony…
,” Tony gasped, pushing his hand down between them and over the outline of Steve’s cock. The almost frightened tone of Steve’s urgent whine shot through Tony, setting every nerve alight.
Some tension began to gather back into Tony’s shoulders, as he eased his way out of the shock and back into his real-life thoughts.
Judging himself by the same criteria he thought fair for other people… That… seemed like quite a sizeable revelation, now that he was thinking about it…
want, and would want all of, if it weren’t impossible. The job you’d give anything to take. The family you’d give anything to have… the man who’ll never love you back. So,
A startled gasp was tugged straight from his lungs when Steve went to pull his clothes down over his legs, the simple feel of his skin sending sharp shocks of pleasure deep into his muscles.
, the slaves in your basement are being drugged into submission – do you know anything about it?” He demanded, a slight edge of aggression on his voice. Which just made Maribelle more eager to comply.
Tony found himself standing alone in the dark silence of his suite, his ears ringing at the sheer abundance of thoughts and feelings and…
“What?” Tony demanded, somewhere between irritated and anxious… and, even as he said it, he realised-
Because it seemed to Steve that the only alternative to saying any of that was lying about it. Pretending he was sorry for things when he wasn’t. Pretending he’d come to think things he didn’t think at all. He couldn’t see how that would make things better between them, either. And, seeing as he was
More worryingly, it also meant that the throng of brightly dressed revellers was already beginning to thin out...
A low growl rolled from Steve’s chest as Tony’s cock pushed past his rim, a pleasant heat flooding up in his loosened muscles as Tony slowly filled him up. And then Tony caressed one hand up to Steve’s shoulder, grinding into him and he leaned down over him, his chest finally pressing against him as he took Steve’s mouth in a possessive kiss-
, that you have a room full of very entitled people, who were all told – like we were – that they could basically do whatever they liked here, have whatever sex they like, take whatever drugs. And every single one of them said, no thank you, we’re just going to make like everyone else and spoon in the lounge bar?” And then he finally looked back at Steve-
“Oh, I’m sorry Steve…” he whispered – and he saw Steve’s eyes widen in alarm, which only made Tony love him more.
And then he pulled out of Steve - taking the opportunity to push his pants and underwear down over his hips, clumsily kicking them over his legs as he crawled up into Steve’s arms. Immediately Steve’s fingers were at the front of his shirt, fumbling slightly as he unfastened his buttons-
And there was no emotion in the delivery, no attempt made to sell it - but it was as much effort as he could manage.
He could so easily imagine the two of them sitting side by side in some nursing home, seventy years from now, and him still being interested in everything she had to say. He could believe he would be learning from her sage advice until he died, that he would enjoy so many of the wonderful things he wanted to do for her, that he’d never tire of watching her smile. He knew he would beam with pride at everything she was sure to achieve, and never stop being amazed by each new limit she broke…
“Of course not!” Steve exclaimed, faux outraged. And then poured a confident glug of his drink over the back of Tony’s neck. “-
“Hi” Tony gave him a little wave, and Andrew waved back, like he was mimicking him. Tony waited until Vanessa had taken her seat, and gently mimed Andrew into doing the same, before he said, “This is Steve.”
he always had a snappy comeback, and every argument he ever made was entirely reasonable and contained only truth and rightness – but that’s because he literally has a team of writers. People who spend two weeks crafting that snappy comeback, and rewrite those arguments thirty times, and just don’t have anything controversial come up. They’re never angry or hurt, when they write that dialogue. And no one can talk like that in real life. I’m sorry people expect you to. I’m sorry I did. But… If you always have to mean every word you say, you’re never going to be able to say what you mean. You’re never going to be able to share anything if you have to wait until you’re sure it’s perfect first. I mean, you’re talking to someone who lost their temper three days ago and yelled at you because I felt
Now, it was simply a case of figuring out what she needed to know, and the best way to explain it, and-
“I don’t know – are you ‘the sort of person’ who puts their foot in it and uses outdated terms all the time, just because you keep doing it?”
“This rant can run to over three hours,” Bucky added, sardonically, and Steve huffed a little laugh.
he was just trying to earn Tony’s trust back. That he had to prove to Tony that he wasn’t as bad as that outcome had made it seem. He’d thought he was supposed to be slowly rebuilding this team. And now he thought of Tony being
“Uh, one moment…” She mused. Tony could hear her frowning as she searched for the details. “Oh, okay… So, I can’t find any more information listed on the internal system, but Captain Rogers has a note on his desk planner, Meeting Talleroy Communications, 12:30 ‘til 2:30.”
And it had nothing to do with personal security or the future of the company or the integrity of the Avengers. It wasn’t any of the reasons he’d given to Pepper, or any of the objections he’d been listing in his own head for days. This was something right from his gut. A sudden
And then Tony curled his fingers over Steve’s waistband, and tugged his pants and his underwear down over his hips in one rough movement – never remotely distracted from what he was doing. Steve barked a surprised moan, his cock burning under the sudden exposure, his hips lifting in an offering, a
his life, understanding what he’d been looking at all this time. It was like he’d been agonising over a puzzle for twenty years only to realise it was upside down. This one burst of revelation had made sense of a thousand impossible questions. Things that were once so complicated and unfixable seemed to just fall into place, forming an obvious pattern, a self-balancing equation.
, I just had the most wonderful night of my life, and it’s really made me think that something could be better. Or, of course, there’s the chance that I just have the best night of my life… and that’s it. Or, maybe I just had the best night of my life, and the price is going to be suffering so much more for the next few centuries...” he trailed off, running out of energy.
“Because the only way to beat Thanos was to use these… they’re called Infinity Stones, and I can explain all about them too, later… But, there was no way to beat Thanos without them, and by 2023 they didn’t exist anymore. Which should have made it impossible to beat Thanos, but… well, you know how you deal with impossible…” and he paused to smile at Tony - and he could swear he’d almost seen that hopeful look again, a shadow somewhere behind Tony’s features… “So, yeah, since we needed something that didn’t exist in the present, you invented time travel so that we could get them from the past. And then you used them to defeat a Titan Warlord and his entire army, even though it cost you your life.”
That, one day, he would be talking to Tony about how much he enjoyed being with him on his birthday…
He didn’t even hear Bucky’s loud stream of profanities until Bucky was running out into the courtyard.
-Just gave up and threw his arms around Steve. The same unthinking way he’d immediately try to cover a bleeding wound. He’d process the rest of this in a minute, but right now he just had to- He just had to
Which, incidentally, was how men were told to deal with their mistakes when Steve was a kid. You accepted you’d fucked up, you vowed not to do it again, you didn’t whine about the fact that you’d lost that job or that opportunity or that friendship. An apology was simply that, in the forties –
Steve. He felt like he could guess Steve’s opinion on topics they’d never discussed, that he could predict his reaction to things that had never come up – that he just knew what sort of person he was.
And then, as he was emptying the contents of yet another box onto his work desk, wincing at how many unmarked pages there were in this one, it suddenly dawned on him-
“Who’re you?” Tony demanded. It was an obvious effort for the guy to answer him over the violent trembling of his chest.
“It would be my best recommendation, if you want to feel most like yourself,” Freddie confirmed. Steve felt his jaw clench.
“Well, it could have been worse,” Tony muttered, pinching his lips together in a performative smile. And then he glanced away again, before he added, very carefully, “at least I’m not actually attracted to Clint. That would’ve been more awkward…”
Everything shifted out of focus for a few seconds. Steve lost track of where each of his senses began and ended, he couldn’t understand his own thoughts, he didn’t recognise the sound of his own heart pounding in his ears…
Even though, when he thought about Steve’s behaviour in general for the best part of a decade… He should have
Tony saw Steve’s attention get snatched away, his eyes catching on his own hand, and then focusing more intently on his fingertips. His eyes melting from shocked to questioning to quietly amazed… and then Tony turned to follow Steve’s gaze… and found that cut, completely closed.
. Believe me, that’ll be the thing they hold on to, if everything you’re scared of actually happens. It’ll be the thing that saves them, whatever they end up losing.”
Steve blinked, momentarily shocked that Tony knew that name… But then he remembered the throw-away joke that Bucky had made earlier in the evening, when it took him two attempts to jump up onto the operating table.
He still hadn’t processed a lot of his recent revelations… But he felt them all, somehow. It no longer felt unnatural or ominous to see himself as human - he didn’t immediately kick himself simply for being tired in the first place.
But there was also this feeling that Dimitri had done the exact opposite thing to Tony… That Dimitri had always been taught, or always assumed, that being bonded to someone was a beautiful, precious, perfectly natural thing… and, as such, found endless evidence to back him up. Everything he loved about Ottilie was another piece of evidence that he had found his perfect partner, and that in turn could only mean he was living his
in that moment. He wasn’t bothering to hide his concern or his sympathy or his pride – and he didn’t bother to dress any of it up. He wasn’t making sure Tony saw any of this, or thinking about how it would come across, or mentally collecting brownie points for being so considerate… he just
And then Steve broke the kiss with a gasp. He ran his hands up along Tony’s back, rough and possessive, before he moved to cup Tony’s face between his palms. He looked at Tony with such intensity that it almost hurt to look back at him.
“Hey, Tony? You okay?” Sam asked. Tony blinked, his eyes still a little unfocused when he looked up at them.
A thoughtful look came into Steve’s eyes for a second – not sad, exactly… but somehow sad to look at… And then, just as Tony thought the pause had drifted into a stop, Steve blinked, and carried on,
And Steve knew that he could let Tony get carried away with that outrage. He could allow Tony to forget his earlier question, let him take the conversation down a different road-
“Thank you,” he smiled, as he reached out to take it. The paper gave way easily under his fingertips, revealing a glimpse of white fabric. “Oh…”
However, much to his own surprise, Tony had found he rather liked it. Which wasn’t to say that he wanted to do it for any
sound like a pretty dumb plan,” Tony acknowledged, with a self deprecating sigh. But, before he could try to think of a better one, Bucky lifted his robe away from his shoulders - presumably looking for some relief from the heavy heat of the outfit - and sparked such a blinding array of flashes that it made Tony’s eyes water.
he could say. It would do. “We’ve been invited to a party.” He snatched the envelope from where he’d left it, beside the coffee pot, and handed it to Steve without looking at him. By the time he could bring himself to glance up again, Steve was already reading the card.
had the feeling that ‘going with it’ might not be quite as simple now as it was last night… Now that he thought of it, he was beginning to recognise that this feeling came in waves. That it was stronger at some times than others. That it didn’t always feel the same…
symptoms suddenly overwhelming him. The dry mouth and the tightening in his chest and the frantic racing of his mind-
“No, it’ll have to be sooner than that,” Tony answered, easily – because, hey, he knew that one. That was the whole reason Bucky had to call him right away and report this symptom. Tony knew, if he acted quickly enough, he could use that pain to locate the problem. If he waited, the ‘bad connection’ would just find another inefficient way to mask its own issues, and possibly infect all the work Tony had done so far.
… There was quite often a strong link between the biological process of sex and the human understanding of love – a link that often led to confusion and heartbreak in the real world... But it wasn’t the case that people should actively separate sex from love, or that the emotional significance of procreation was ‘made up’… Or that there was any less confusion and heartache, in a world where love and sex were kept separate.
And so it was that Tony found himself curled up in a ball on the couch at three in the morning, soaked through with misery and feeling trapped inside his own head. Veering wildly between bitter self-justification and aching self-doubt, not sure whether he was angry or insecure… and it occurred to him that he had the perfect word for this.
And Tony kept thinking he was in a room that he recognised… the workshop, or his bedroom from when he was a teenager, or his dorm room at MIT… but it seemed to shift in front of his eyes. He kept recognising it as somewhere it obviously wasn’t.
That knowledge clearly outranked any instinct to sink his teeth into Steve’s throat. It spoke over any neurotic overthinking there might have been.
sorry that I was so… insensitive, when we first met. For lots of times I wasn’t really thinking about things from your point of view” Tony breathed, “I am sorry for not giving you a bit more credit when the whole thing with Bucky was happening, and for not listening more… I
Tony remembered far too many infuriating arguments with his father to believe that any good could come from trying to explain.
“Yeah, I… know…” Tony answered automatically, his mind already racing ahead to the obvious follow up question-
When he finally managed to look up at Steve, he could see the visceral fury that still tensed his muscles, the naked instinct in his eyes - the pure, inhuman power that still radiated from him. Tony knew that none of that was...
“Get inside before someone sees you,” Tony snapped, squeezing his eyes shut and gesturing wildly towards the living room.
“JARVIS, put my room into Migraine mode and clear my calendar for the rest of the day,” He decided, somewhat irritably.
being tempted back into the middle distance by these ideological musings and moments of introspection…
And then, when the room had stopped shimmering and his heartbeat had settled back into his chest, he glanced up at Steve again-
“I might have let my emotions get the better of me, once or twice. I might’ve made poor choices sometimes. There
to say – he just wasn’t going to be able to. It was inarguably beyond his capabilities to articulate
Also, just to reassure you, there is *certainly* an element of the unreliable narrator at work, when Steve is musing about why he and Bucky could never be a couple - obviously, these ideas develop and get rethought before too long, and there is a reason we start here. But it *is* a Stuckony Story, I swear to God 😂
He knew, on this part of the mission especially, it was just too risky. He had literally no idea what would happen if his intervention tipped Clint off, or convinced them to turn back and rethink the plan - Strange had been adamant that there was only
His birthday was considered a networking opportunity by so many people that he sometimes wondered if it came printed on corporate calendars.
those sorts of things… and the people you just don’t. And… I guess that’s what I mean, really. If he can go to the two of you when he wants to talk, and he can go to Nat when he needs help, and he has his own friends to share the ‘my friend’s not dead’ news with, then… That’s no one’s fault, and that’s good, and… anything else is just more of me being ridiculous.”
it was a bad idea to find Steve. He didn’t really have a conscious reason to think it would be - his mind was too frazzled by now to come up with any.
And then, when he had done everything he could think of to trick his body into a distress response, it was time to focus his thoughts. To intentionally commit to any idea that would make his heart race.
“Hey,” Tony smiled, his eyes soft and dark. Steve let it wash through him like warm water, before he answered, quietly,
But his thoughts were too sluggish right now to push that train of thought out of the station. So, Tony let it dissolve into nothing, and tried instead to think about how to answer that text…
And then he glanced over Tony’s shoulder, and saw that one of the guests had noticed them, watching them in the same mindless way she might’ve watched people dancing at a gala on earth…
“There’s so much I don’t know about you,” he grinned. A throw away comment, a bookend to Steve’s joke – but still, Steve felt compelled to answer it,
Which was as far as he got, before he heard the footsteps approaching from the end of the corridor. A flutter of anticipation broke out in Tony’s stomach as he turned towards the door-
really big!” Rhodey insisted… But his serious expression bubbled under the sound of the two of them still giggling, and giggling…
the insensitive ass that he’d just tearfully begged forgiveness for being… But he knew it was true that he’d never put himself in Steve’s shoes, not really. That he’d put Steve on a pedestal, that he’d not been fair to him – that he
And then the hesitant excitement of wondering if there were more possibilities than he’d previously realised… other choices besides ‘live for other people’ and ‘live for yourself’. Maybe there were ways of doing both. Maybe there were moments that weren’t one or the other – maybe that was okay. Maybe Steve
It wasn’t so much that he was questioning any of that, so much as that he’d just stopped believing any of it - he didn’t believe anything, anymore.
“So, I was thinking about a possible alternative to that Siberian Bunker,” Tony announced, out of nowhere.
“Yeah, main door and the elevator,” he managed, still trying to steady himself. “Just let them right through.”
“I want it to be. This is all I’ve ever wanted – well, I mean, there will probably be less alien sex drugs, and less public sex, cos y’know, we both have jobs...” He mused, his tone entirely serious – and Steve just laughed.
And, thankfully, his legs seemed to remember where the nearest soft room was – because his head was suddenly of no use to him, at all. His head had completely whited out, washed into a general glare of pure emotions. Just endorphins, and adrenaline… and a lot of drugs, by now.
Steve's surroundings melted around him, as he lost tension necessary to keep himself upright in them - like some grand metaphor for the whole thing.
Of course, it hadn’t grabbed his attention as it probably would have, if he’d been even remotely able to concentrate. As it was, it had become a sort of harmless game he played as he tidied. Every so often he’d spot another page much older than the others, and feel that little lift of achievement that came with collecting another prize-
, there was literally nothing he had to worry about or ‘keep in mind’ right now. He could just be spaced out and drug fucked and feel
Tony curled in on himself. Just like when he was a kid, waiting for his mom to come and tell him off.
to,” Tony babbled on happily, taking no particular care when he reached over to close the door. “But I think I actually could run out and get something from the car. Like it wouldn’t kill me if the ceiling collapsed right now.”
Steve’s stomach tightened at that, his shoulders tensing just slightly at the sound of those words. There was the shadow of a memory – the sound of people screaming, and the smell of smoke.
was in Nevada, or where Steve was staying… and SHIELD would probably never think to look for either of them here.
And it occurred to him, that one issue would be enough to fill a hundred evenings of anxious self-analysis. He could talk to Rhodey for hours, just about the fact that he was foolish enough to fall in love. That was without everything else-
Steve had never been as thankful for that particular aspect of their friendship as he was when he got back from Tony’s that night.
Steve felt himself break out into a grin, his thoughts briefly overwhelmed by a burst of bright, shiny happiness-
Steve felt it swell up in his chest, as he became more and more aware of what this really meant to Tony. How happy Tony was… How much better this made things…
and… I don’t know, all this ‘show your feelings’ stuff, and ‘say what you’re thinking at the time’ and ‘be honest with people’ is probably okay if you aren’t a complete nervous wreck
“Tony-” It just broke out of Steve’s chest, like he’d have yelled if he’d burned himself. A physical reaction – fuck knows what he thought he was going to follow it up with. But by now his ribs ached with the force of just,
“Well, you’ll never believe the evening I’ve had,” he answered tersely. Steve felt a cool churning of discomfort, somewhere low in his stomach… A shapeless experience of something out of place.
But, before Steve could feel any of the emotions that were probably about to crash over him, Tony carried on, casual as you like,
want to live differently, and think differently to this… But it’s still going to be hard, and, you know, probably more hassle than anyone else you could date.”
And it was wonderful, of course. Even more so now that Tony’s mind wasn’t a dizzy mush, now that he was remembering what it really meant in the real world-
Tony all but growled when he was forced to prop himself up again, grabbing mindlessly for the bottle on the bedside table - a luxury hand cream that the hotel provided, and that Tony just-so-happened to know made an excellent lube…
Now that he’d used up all his adrenaline, and wasn’t able to flinch away from it so forcefully, Tony found himself thinking that these weren’t the eerie,
“Come to bed,” Tony whispered. He felt Steve shudder against him in response before he managed to whisper back,
“So Genesis Day is the day you drug everyone on Earth with ‘reasonableness?’” Tony exhaled, growing ever wearier with this cryptic guessing game.
“Yeah, I am - as well as being a nervous wreck, and wracked with guilt - so very happy,” Tony sighed. “And I just spent the most amazing night of my life with the most wonderful man who I am hopelessly in love with, and I think that he might actually kind of like me…”
part of things was about Steve - that Steve was the one who was going to be really hurt by this, and that it was for Steve to decide what they were going to do…
not invited to, and I get two minutes to process that information before you’re all rolling your eyes like,
And somewhere in the middle of that task his thoughts had slowed just enough for him to hear them – enough that he could get completely distracted by them, no longer aware of
“Sorry,” he murmured, looking between Tony and the floor. “Yeah, I’m okay. Just… a bad day at work,” he shrugged.
“We were never going to hurt him. We only wanted some medical data, to take a little bit of blood, just to-”
“Look, if you don’t want my opinion, don’t bring me into it,” Rhodey asserted coldly. “You want to bring up my feelings about Tony, then I’ll say a few things.”
He again wondered about his decision to keep his former self in the dark about everything. Not that Steve had any doubts left about any element of his plan… But as he had nothing else to think about for the next...seven minutes and thirty seconds, he decided to run though all of his very good reasons one more time.
“And, you know, I’m sorry for the general tone of a lot of it. I was yelling at this really arrogant, thoughtless ideologue who – on closer inspection – I have completely invented in my own mind. I know that isn’t you. I also know that you aren’t Clint, or Nat, or Scott, in case you thought I’d lost my damn mind” Tony sighed, and Steve breathed a soft little laugh. “And I think we can all agree that, whatever you could’ve done differently when you put that team together, or whatever – you really can’t be held responsible for Clint’s choice of words on the raft. When you weren’t even there. I don’t know why I was yelling at you for something Nat said to me, when you were half way across Europe. And just, in general, I’m sorry for always treating you like you were some sort of… figurehead, responsible for the whole organisation and never allowed to be… I’m sorry I always looked at it as how far you fell short of this arbitrary,
me is that I’m not… taking care of him, right now. So, I don’t know. Maybe I’m just losing my mind…” he conceded, letting his head fall back into the couch cushions, his eyes drifting aimlessly over the workshop as he got carried away with his thoughts…
And if he’d given any thought whatsoever to the setting of his many detailed fantasies, he’d probably just assumed a generic black-tie gala, like the thousands he’d been to back on Earth…
So, wondering whether he should have any passing interest in Peter Quill was very far down Steve’s list of considerations.
“...Yes,” Steve realised, the smile growing as he the true potential of this gift unfolded in his mind…
“Because… I don’t know, it’s like that thing, with your dad. Like how I acted when I met you ended up proving your dad ‘right’ about a whole load of …ridiculous things, and it wasn’t even about you. I didn’t even know you then. That was just because I was… scared… and really angry, I think… I don’t remember, and I don’t really know what I was angry

They didn’t really need help, from Zan or anyone else, to interrogate a staff member. And since, in reality, they had their pick, they decided to go with someone Zan hadn’t been tipped off about, someone they didn’t have to wait hours for-
He couldn’t risk a justified rant about how presumptuous and creepy and potentially dangerous this whole thing was, for fear of the deeply buried truths that may come pouring out after it…
“JARVIS, bring up every piece of information you can find on Talleroy Communications,” he demanded, as he sprinted over to the cabinet in the far corner of the room. Already running contingencies and arranging priorities and sorting through a thousand lines of thought-
So, as usual, he didn’t say anything. He just stood there and watched as Tony slowly melted into sleep, thinking all the things he wasn’t allowed to say.
Steve was starting to see that he’d even kept Bucky at a distance. That, in all the time he’d spent trying to save Bucky, he’d never let himself think about having him
Also, in what is a very typically Wilma note, I know I *said* this update was all smut... But, as usual, you've got a couple of pages of introspection to get through, first 😆 HOWEVER, please be aware, there IS smut in this chapter - do not let the opening paragraphs trick you into thinking you can read it at your grans house, or whatever.

little lecture. He’d had twenty years of this from Rhodey and Pepper, from every conceivable angle. He knew how to politely fob this one off-
Bucky already knew that it was likely to start them bickering, that there wasn’t really anything to be
That low throb of adrenaline spiked up along his back, same as it always did when he saw Tony. Fight or flight – Steve didn’t know which.
“So, the first thing is that none of your bloodwork has been comprehensive enough – no one has done the right tests. And there isn’t really much choice about how we do that one, so, if you have a problem with needles… the best I can do is put you out first,” Tony shrugged.
Maybe that didn’t make sense, after a couple of hours of shallow chit-chat… but over the course of those insubstantial conversations, Tony felt like he’d
“And he said that we should try taking Ambience and, um, Tranquil, Tranquilly, whatever the fuck stupid name they gave it – because the effect of those drugs is directly proportional to the concentration of the ‘natural minerals’ in your system?”
needed Steve to show him who he was talking to, before he could talk. He couldn’t have understood Steve’s actual mistakes and empathised with his genuine situation if Steve hadn’t shown him what they were – he couldn’t be expected to forgive the man Steve actually was, based purely on actions that had been given no explanation.
sort of a way, while the others barely acknowledged it – and began to carry on the conversation amongst themselves….
“Come on, let’s see.” Tony muttered, walking quickly and carefully toward the railing. Steve fell in step beside him, both of them slowing up as they got closer, trying to get a subtle look at what was down there before anything down there could see them.
And Tony smiled back, sadly. He sank to sit on the floor, his back against the couch, so that he could briefly rest his head against Steve’s knee when he said,
And possibly take another moment to berate himself for ever getting into this ridiculous situation, just for good measure.
“Well, you don’t need me to tell you that the timeline I came from is completely separate to the world we’re in now,” he began, gently. “Just because things happened in my timeline, doesn’t mean they’re going to happen here - in fact, I can promise you that none of this is going to happen to you. I won’t let it.”
No. No, of course not. Obviously the suffering of other people was every bit as important as his own. Obviously a person couldn’t judge these things entirely from their own perspective…
Tony went to scream, but it was cut off as Steve thrust into him again, and again, and again, immediately setting a fast, fluid pace. The rush of sensation crashed into Tony like a tsunami. It was like being thrown out of himself, his conscious thoughts instantly overwhelmed by the intensity of this. He couldn’t process this; he could only feel it.
And then Steve pushed another finger into him, pushing deeper this time, brushing against Tony’s prostate in a shower of sparks.
And then Rhodey’s step stuttered to a halt, his eyes drawn to the gauntlet. Then he looked up at Tony, a quizzical expression on his face.
There was barely the ghost of a smile before he added, “but it’s more comfortable than the clothes I came out in, so I might just stick with this ‘till we go home.”
of that at the time, about just being scared and thinking you could fix it – even if you’d never mentioned how you felt about me… I’d have got it. I even
tell you.” Steve sighed, “When it later turns out that she already killed a hundred people or something, and didn’t think to mention it. Or we find out that her fathers research is something evil…”
However, there are some not very subtle parallels here to a sub/dom sexual scene, in so far as Tony is, quite knowingly, excited to finally be in control and to assume some power - and Steve is quite knowingly excited at the idea of being powerless for once, and even the idea of Tony 'punishing him' - in this case by yelling. (these are themes they continue to explore in the next update, but under very different circumstances)
like things were hopeless. Like he’d been standing in St Pauls Cathedral and fretting about the state of the window frames.
Over thinking the fact that Steve hadn’t called since he left - and occasionally talking himself out of the impulse to call Steve.
“No, not really.” Tony answered, honestly. “On this occasion, I don’t see anything the team or even the government could provide that’d be a better bet than us going in now. They don’t know what this special project is any more than we do, so they can’t provide us with any specific back up. They’re just as likely to make things worse – and I think they’d say that. I think if you gave any of them the facts, and asked them for the optimal solution, they’d say it was to get in as quickly and as quietly as they could, and find out as much as they could, before taking this thing down the best way they could. And that’s us going in now. So.”
And then they both changed position, so that they were standing side on rather than with their backs to the door…
Tony wasn’t mentioning it, why he wouldn’t meet Steve’s eye… And Steve could think of all sorts of things that he
But this time - and right in the nick of time - Steve managed to catch the briefest hint of something else in Tony’s features. The tiniest flash of hope, or the most subtle little gathering of courage, or something… Something so swift and so small that Steve didn’t even know what he’d seen.
And then Steve found out about the Hydra occupation of SHIELD, and Bucky… And sex had fallen well down the list of priorities. Steve had even actively pushed it down that list, because it felt like one of the frivolous things he
He’d been so sure that he was going to be angry at Nick forever - that no amount of time would diminish the hurt Nick had caused him, or the wrong he’d objectively done… But Tony couldn’t deny, now that someone had actually done something about it, he was so much less bitter. He didn’t like Fury any more than he had, he didn’t think his actions were any more understandable. But the spite wasn’t there anymore.
For a moment, there was nothing more than the feeling of Steve’s chest pressed against his, and the smell of Steve’s skin, and the overwhelming joy of knowing that he was here, and safe, and
“You’re probably going to have to sit through a really detailed debrief about it in, oh,” Tony checked his watch, purely for dramatic effect, “five hours, ish, so…”
sort of reverence as he let his gaze rise up to meet Tony’s eyes - as the true significance of this finally started to dawn on him.
And then Tony had briefly considered whether he should drink again before Steve got there. Seeing as he hadn’t, since that first bag of Steve’s blood. Experience told him that it was an awfully long time to have gone on so little. Reason told him it probably wasn’t ‘healthy’. That, and a gnawing little concern from the darkest corners of his mind, something he didn’t want to think about too deeply… something that told him it would be better to be full when Steve arrived.
And, above all else, Steve had vowed never to lie to Tony, or keep secrets from him - or decide what he was ready to hear - ever again.
Steve’s hands ran under Tony’s shirt, seeking out more of him, delighting in the sensation of Tony’s skin under his hands and the way he writhed up against Steve’s touches and the soft little sounds he made against Steve’s lips.
Steve felt his body soften, instantly. There was a pleasant swell of dizziness when he managed a slow, deep breath. There was even the faintest tingling of a smile, as noted the familiar defiance in Tony’s eyes, the battle-ready posture, the thousands of calculations that he could see Tony running in his head…
“Hey. Yeah, I’m okay,” Bucky smiled, a little self-consciously. Almost shy. “And no, Steve isn’t here. Steve is at home, waiting to murder me when he finds out I came here.”
As he always did in times of crisis, Tony thought of Rhodey and Pepper, and the various disasters they’d helped to steer him through…
Because, actually, there weren’t that many… and, apparently, every one of them was a formative moment for Steve-
you were some cute guy I’d met at a conference. I couldn’t just go with the moment and kiss you, if I wasn’t really sure. Seeing as, you know, you’re
A heavy fog seemed to close around him, his vision darkening, the whole world falling away from him…
Steve broke the kiss with a gasp, pulling his legs out of the water and turning to kneel on the edge of the pool, all with Captain America speed and efficiency. Tony’s eyes barely had time to widen, before Steve had grabbed him by the hips and bodily lifted him into the same position, pulling him hard against his chest-
“Jesus Tony,” Steve breathed, as he climbed up onto the bed and crawled on top of him, his knees on either side of Tony’s hips, his hands by his shoulders. Tony didn’t even
that he should have to deal with this, that he’d be pushed into giving bad responses when he’d never consented to being asked.
Every one of those moments had ripped the very soul out of him, left him shaking and panting pointlessly for air-
didn’t want to go here, but you have forced my hand. You have forced this upon us both, and I hope you’re happy.” And then he sat forward again, resting his weight on his knees and fixing Steve with a serious look. “I’m going to have to
from signing them. I just said what I thought, and did what I thought it was right to do – I wasn’t making choices for anyone but myself. And the actual choice I made for myself was that
Because Tony had spent the last two days having to pay attention in meetings, and make small talk with business associates that he’d likely never see again - and having to think about his expression. Several times he’d caught himself, halfway through some detailed memory of Steve, this same silly grin plastered all over his face. And every time he’d been forced to drag his thoughts back into room, Tony had petulantly bemoaned the fact that he couldn’t even
Tony just looked at Steve for a moment, while a thousand thoughts clamoured for his attention, struggling to be the idea that shouted louder than the rest-
Wishing he’d not been so needy and demanding when Tony tried to explain, that he’d been more understanding of what Tony was trying to say
it wasn’t 260 instead… So, I pointed it out to Fury, and I asked. And I either expected him to say it was an error, that it was supposed to say 170, and that you were actually
. He broke down and told you he was heartbroken that you’d lied to him and that he was disappointed and hurt and
His body reacted before his head could work it out. A rush of excitement that made him feel weak and heady, a sudden burning need that was almost painful… a queasy sickness in the pit of his stomach…
Of all the things that occurred to him during that long and painful night, that was perhaps the worst. The slow, sad understanding that he really was just hurt because Steve didn’t care about him. Whatever proper sounding, principled points he had… he probably
“Which meant we couldn’t even pretend we were going to be late for something else,” Steve carried on over-explaining.
“Honestly… I don’t really know what my line is, or what I even think about, sex or…well anything, half of the time. But, I think, wherever my line is… I don’t think anything that could happen here would be worse than being frozen for seventy years. I don’t think, wherever my line is, that something like this would be, uh, closer to it than the helicarriers. I mean, unless I upset you. So, I don’t know, maybe I’m just saying the same thing…”
Actually, Tony had carried out most of his experiments on the living room floor, using a Kevlar undershirt as a mat.
. “He came over, after all the official ceremonies and celebrations had taken place – that was taken at about four in the morning.”
And, in that same moment, Steve had realised that there would never be anywhere for that anger to go. That he would never be able to confront any of the people who did that to him. That too much time had passed. That it could hardly be considered important now, in light of everything else…
He hadn’t had to worry about that, back when he was trying to be all Greatest Generation about the whole thing. The year he’d spent on the run, Steve at least had the comfort of simplicity. The purity of self-flagellation as a response to guilt and loss. It didn’t
And then he put the glass back on the table, along with all the complications and contingencies that he still had to deal with, and left it until the morning.
Acting on that instinct alone, Steve dropped his head and sucked a long, slow kiss to Tony’s throat, caressing his hands over Tony’s back. Tony moaned, letting his head fall back as he grabbed at the back of Steve’s hair, writhing into him,
Steve didn’t even remember bolting for the front door. He only knew that he appeared to be standing right there when Tony knocked.
And Steve saw the self-conscious little smile. The way Tony dropped his eyes briefly before he answered,
This was just the beginning of this relationship – the very start of the great love affair of Steve’s life.
“So, what do we do?” Maribelle demanded – completely skipping any scrutiny of Steve’s non-explanation.
He turned the cold tap on full, and put his face under the spray, and tried to focus on the sting of the water.
And immediately Tony recognised the feeling of Steve positioning himself between his legs, the way Steve pushed at Tony’s thighs. Tony arched his back, letting his legs fall apart, one of his hands grasping at Steve’s hip, trying to urge him on.
tell me anything, don’t you?” Tony told him, his voice soft and serious all at once. “You know that I…
It was a night a few weeks after that, when he was still staying in a sterile hotel room - on account of his home, and all his possessions, being destroyed. A night when, for no obvious reason, everything seemed to pile on top of him, and he found himself spiralling into thoughts about Bucky, and fears over lying to Tony, and finding out that so many people he knew were Nazi spies… And just as he felt himself welling up, it had occurred to Steve that someone might be watching him.
certain of this plan. It was the first thing he’d been truly sure of since he came out of the ice. He’d just felt like he understood it, like it all fell into place and made such perfect sense – that there wasn’t anything he could possibly be caught out by.
Tony stirred into consciousness with the resentful, disappointed feeling of someone trying to hold onto a pleasant dream…
Tony wrinkled his nose, and shook his head, as though he could physically dislodge that thought. He didn’t like that question. He didn’t like any of the places it could lead him. And he didn’t particularly like the memory of Steve saying
Worse even than the thought of never seeing Tony again was the thought that he’d be so casual about it, that he’d nonchalantly throw it out there as a bit of cheerful news – that he didn’t even look at Steve when he said it.
to pass. And in that time, Steve had run the full gauntlet of human emotions, in no particular order. He’d been nervous. He’d been excited. He’d been resentful and grateful and generically overwhelmed. Mostly, he’d been incredulous that it

Even without his sudden focus and enhanced processing capacity, Tony had always been able to understand any weapon at a glance. He was familiar with them on a theoretical level, and a functional level, and a historical level-
So, somewhere between reconciled and begrudging, Steve sank back into the couch and threw Fury’s folder down onto the coffee table with a satisfying slap. With his irritation still grinding somewhere in the background, he forced a checklist into his head.
And Steve’s body seemed to follow that command directly, his head falling into the pillows, a pleading little
He hated this feeling. All of these feelings. He hated himself for being this hopeless and he hated the whole world for being so difficult and he
… But I’m not sure a heist is a good place for me to be Hulking out. Especially since I don’t know how that works here. Apparently,” he shrugged, embarrassed. “It’s fine - I’ll try to cover for you and… Stay out of direct sunlight, I guess,” he gestured down to his robes again. Tony smiled at him, and then looked up at Bucky and Sam,
“Okay, so, do you want to spend a fun packed day going through the employee files we do have, and trying to plan our escape routes?” Tony suggested with comedic enthusiasm.
“Sit down,” Tony instructed, glancing at the bed. Steve felt strangely clumsy as he rushed to comply, all awkward excitement next to Tony’s smooth command of the situation… But he didn’t mind. He might even have liked the novelty of it, the feeling of being in a role he was never usually allowed to play…
He didn’t much like the way Nick had just spoken to Tony – it felt like taking a liberty, in a way that Steve couldn’t explain.
had reason to think of Captain America in the last few weeks. They’d reminded themselves what he looked like. They knew he was alive, and they were already searching for him.
Steve let his head fall back and closed his eyes. He took a slow, comfortable breath, and waited to see where his mind would take him…
thing that came up. Always worried that he was about to make an ass of himself or put his foot in it or ruin what they already had. Nervous and guilty every time he felt better for letting some human detail in. Terrified of taking even a tiny step closer, because then he might have to think about… God, all sorts of things.
The pleading was swallowed up by an almost pained gasp, as Steve dropped his head and took the length of Tony’s cock into his mouth.
had a hundred shots of me before Steve broke your arm - but you just kept going. And the only reason for that is that you still didn’t have what you really came for. So, I’m going to ask one last time, and then I’m going to let
“It’s okay Steve, we’re good,” Bucky reassured him, as he knelt to untie the ropes around Steve’s wrists. Steve pulled his arms free and flexed his shoulders – but stayed seated for a second.
Tony had spent so long petulantly asking himself if he had been a) right about everything or b) wrong about everything… which now felt a bit like asking himself if he should a) ignore this injury completely or b) hack his own arm off. When, obviously, treating this was always going to require a delicate, time consuming operation – a string of procedures, each building on the last. And it would probably involve a few stitches, and some uncomfortable healing, and there might still be a scar left at the end…
Of course, he knew it would help to analyse the technical set up… But that was a Tony thing. That was something that he would obviously, naturally talk to Tony about…
“I had quite a nice time, actually,” Steve answered… realising the truth in it as he spoke. It hadn’t been the
“So, was that awful or nice or both?” Tony enquired kindly - which was actually stepping pretty close to the bounds of their relationship, but still technically okay, he thought.
“...I don’t know what that means,” Tony admitted, his voice trembling. Because he literally didn’t know what being in love with an immortal looked like, or what changes he should be frightened of first, or which vague, shadowy feelings this might yet explain…
“Oh, fuck more, please more,” Tony begged, even as that deep friction curled in him. Steve pulled back and pushed into him again, a sharp desperate pleasure that immediately consumed itself, twisting into an urgent need for
And he just about caught the delighted little grin that broke through Steve’s serious expression, before Steve grabbed him by the hips and pulled him up off of his feet. Instinctively, Tony threw his arms around Steve’s neck, pulling himself up into Steve’s embrace and wrapping his legs around his waist. A jolt of friction shot up along Tony’s spine, sparking a flood of hot, tingling excitement-
He knew it was the best option available to him. Taking things as they were, rather than how he wished them to be… Thinking about what would be most efficient, and practical, under the circumstances… Then, logically, Tony should just swallow his resentment and make chit chat about the h'orderves. He should
“Jesus, look at you,” Tony breathed, running a firm palm over Steve’s shoulder, and then over his neck, tilting Steve’s head to meet him as he leant down and kissed him again-
– rather than jumping from being hyper focused on his own failings, to being hyper focused on Steve’s mistakes, and then being confused because it all looked so different…
on doing whatever Tony said right now. He’d forgotten there were such things as ‘surroundings’ and ‘rooms’ and ‘furniture’; he was genuinely surprised to feel the bed hit the back of his legs.
It was, therefore, about ten minutes after sunset when Steve rapped authoritatively on Wesley’s door.
It was one thing to think that he’d gotten into a relationship with Steve while he was a vampire – that was probably reckless enough. But to think that they’d gotten into some sort of
himself to break the stare, glancing down at his hands while he filtered through this new information…
He was already picturing the building as he knew it really was. Laying the blueprint in his mind over the top of the structure in front of his eyes, slotting in all the details he had. He knew that this place had once been rigged with some very innovative, very
had been the most horrific part of the worst experience of Tony’s life, the part he could never bring himself to revisit, not even that night with Steve. The terrifying, disgusting moment when Obie had grabbed him by the back of his hair, and forced his wrist into Tony’s mouth, and barked at him,
“But… You were always so aware of everything I was doing,” he muttered in Bucky’s general direction, “And, if I ever could get you to agree to a general anaesthetic, Captain Rogers was right there the entire time…”
Steve swallowed roughly, sweat prickling his forehead and the small of his back as he made a genuine attempt to twist away. That time Tony had to tense his arms, the muscles in his shoulders rippling under his skin…
Steve felt a cold, creeping horror cover his body as two lab techs appeared, each pushing a medical trolley… one of which was laid out with syringes, and tourniquets, and IV bags.
Steve is in trouble. And I haven’t got time to convince you that I’m okay right now, so you’re just going to have to trust me,” Tony explained in a rush, trying to keep his voice level. “But I’ve got to call the Avengers back, and then I’ve got to work on finding him, and – you can either stay here and watch me do it, or you can go, and I’ll call you later,” he concluded, putting the flyer down on the counter top so that he could fish his phone out of his pocket again.
“Fuck, Tony, Jesus Tony, Fuck-” Steve screamed, sounding almost frightened by the sudden onslaught of sensation. Still, Tony could feel that last shred of resolve, the final, desperate attempt to hold back-
Tony could picture Steve’s beautiful lips… and remember the feeling of them against his mouth…and his chest… and his cock…
And then, in a burst of reckless inspiration, Steve shifted Tony’s weight - so that he could stand up with him held tight in his arms.
Steve threw it over to the left of the room, immediately, just because Tony had told him to. Tony snorted another laugh.
Tony… Was it then? Was there a moment later on when it became something else, a reason he had to think that word for the first time… When
trying, but I thought it must’ve seemed like… Like I’d say anything to shut you up? And, I’d like to say I’m sorry it
“Oh, Tony,” Steve whispered hungrily, as he dragged a slow, firm grip over the length of him. Tony screamed soundlessly, already chasing that aching friction, arching his back off of the mattress. Steve rolled his palm roughly over the head of Tony’s cock, sending another shock jolting up along Tony’s back.
Steve had tried very hard to convince himself that this was all just a professional concern – that he’d been awake for three days because he was worried about this mission going wrong.
It was a completely separate question, and it had nothing to do with what Tony wanted, or what he thought was a good idea. It didn’t matter. The fact was, he just couldn’t look at
“What, you mean you’d die for me more than you’d die for other people?” Tony quirked an eyebrow at him.
“So, before we go out tonight, we should probably talk about…what might happen.” Tony spoke as though the words tasted bad. And there was a peculiarly exciting rush of horror as Steve realised what Tony meant. A strange bracing feeling in his stomach.
...And Bucky found himself wondering how many other details of Steve’s life he’d forgotten to ask about.
“I… haven’t found that yet… But, yeah, you could do a lot of damage from here” Tony answered the real question. “If I wanted to, I could shut this place down right now, in any number of ways. I found the control for the power” He gave the file reader a little wave to demonstrate. “So, yeah, whatever Varian they’ve given access to this system – and they’ve really gone out of their way, to help some Varian access this system – then that Varian
developed, and… and then he’d done it. He’d drugged a platoon of Council troops into submission – so now he
He couldn’t even be bothered to finish the thought, before he was scrabbling to his feet and bolting for the door.
And maybe it was the effects of the drugs, or maybe he’d been paying more attention than he realised to Bucky’s rant… But, quite out of nowhere, things started falling into place.
Tony left the empty bag in the indentation on the countertop, and moved to cast an eye over the research that JARVIS was still loading for him.
“No, actually” Adam breezed – like he’d expected the question, and had been looking forward to catching Tony out. “If it helps ease your corrupted morality, as it currently stands –
And - as of thirty seconds ago - he was sure that he couldn’t trust anyone else on earth to take it seriously…
since he’d felt that perfectly human anxiety of wondering whether he’d gone too far, not knowing what he did the night before…
had wanted it. Even when it seemed ridiculous to hope for it, even when Steve hadn’t let himself think about it… He’d always wanted this.
And the words, they weren’t enough, they weren’t big enough or harsh enough or nasty enough to express this passion surging up in him-
“My name is Steve Rogers,” he started, leaving a pause for Tony to register the name. “My plane went down over the Arctic seventy years ago, but I was able to survive because of the serum. A SHIELD exploration team found that plane, and they were able to wake me up.”
“Tony, this is amazing,” Steve found his voice at last. Tony glanced up at him, a hint of genuine emotion flashing up in his eyes before he smiled shyly and replied,
And then the evening had just melted away from him, and before he knew it he was following Tony back down the same corridor, in the same dull haze.
He saw Nick’s face shift into the superior expression of a parent who was about to humour an irritable toddler. Which irritated Steve even more.
the particular way Steve melted back from that. He liked the way Steve’s eyes widened, the way he smiled against Tony’s fingertips.
“Interesting fellows,” he commented, in a very level voice. And Steve knew, if he wanted to, he could take that as,
awake - full of graphic images and fragmented thoughts and noisy jumbles of ideas, like the aftermath of some horrific accident. He knew there was literally no chance of him actually falling asleep. That he’d feel even more agitated and ridiculous, trying to think about all this while lying poker straight on his bed-
And then he went back to rest his weight against that same spot on the wall, and began taking deep, calming breaths as he counted down that last thirty seconds-
“Well, Rhodey said that they’re going to finally announce the results of this thing in about half an hour, and then we’re supposed to go and meet Bruce backstage. So, if you want to catch up with us later, that’s where we’re supposed to be,” he smiled.
But that I wouldn’t have said it to you? I mean… this sounds awful, but I’d completely forgotten you were there… And, I don’t know… That whole thing actually becomes less reasonable in my head, just because you were…”
And now that he had the words for it, he felt so overwhelmingly sorry for Tony… He actually   loved him
The pressure in Steve’s head built and built, to the point of a blinding headache, as he tried to work out whether he was delighted that Tony was home or devastated that the moment had come - whether he was dreading this reunion, or dying for it to happen-
And then, as he bent to seal the box file, his eye caught on a little scrap of yellowed paper, peaking out at him from beneath the more modern paperwork-
Steve looked back at Tony again… Tony, looking up at him with expectation and… hm, Steve was clearly meant to say something now…

because it’s actually a healthy blood sample, as compared to the crap I usually get,” Tony carried on, “or if it’s just because of the serum, or just because it’s…
“...Beautiful,” Steve breathed, as he traced a reverential touch over the edge of it, his eyes widening like he was trying to take in the night sky.
In fact, at the time, it had felt like a bit of a cop out - following a desire so small and simple, because thinking about what he really wanted, and what consequences really meant to him, had seemed too daunting a prospect.
that his world hadn’t ended like that. Not the compromised relief that he usually felt when a crisis had been avoided - not just the release of adrenaline at the end of a panic, or the queasy comfort of thinking about all the ways that things
“Whatever,” he sighed, opening the data case and placing it on a work desk before he turned his attention back to Pepper, “Miss Potts. Got a minute?”
