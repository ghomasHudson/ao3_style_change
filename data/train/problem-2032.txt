“Nonsense,” I said, to say something. “My body may not have moved but since this morning I have resolved seven little mysteries and one rather interesting old murder case all described in those letters stacked on the mantle, mailed here over the last fortnight.”
The shock of seeing his figure in this room, this city, had not yet faded even in the several weeks since I had returned to London, and since he had returned to our rooms in Baker Street. Against the window, I allowed my eye to sweep across his tidy hair, the curve of brow and nose and his mustache and strong jawline, the slightly irregular set of his shoulders where the left was pulled tighter into scar tissue and tendons.
“Come here,” he said and, not understanding, I crossed the room to him. I wanted to leap into the certainty of determination, reveal his intentions to myself before he revealed them to me and also - I did not dare to guess what he was thinking. I did not want to dare.
“Since we’re both awake and I find the cursed eyeglasses weighing on my mind,” I said briskly, like I had never intended to say anything else, “I may play something. I had the Stradivarius retuned last week. Mycroft kept it in relatively good condition, considering how little he knows about instruments.”
Watson laughed, a genuinely amused version of that sound I cherished most. He had one version that turned a little vicious, for when something wasn’t actually funny. And another that, years into our friendship, I had been astonished to find came out only when in bed with him.
The paper dropped. He was, indeed, holding onto the corner of a book beneath the paper but it wasn’t, as I had guessed, the hated Verne adventures he kept bringing home.
It felt self-aggrandizing to assign myself all the blame. I could not determine, without data, which of the changes I could see stemmed from my own actions, from the loss of his wife, from the simple passing of time. Perhaps they were all tangled together.
“That I have,” Watson said, glancing my way as he tossed his outer garments across the back of a chair with vehemence. “And you remain in the exact same position in which I left you this morning!”
He didn’t have to say it. I could see it like it was printed on his features, a warmth in his blue eyes and the softness of his jaw. How strange it had been, understanding I was the cause for that warmth for the first time - and every time after, now years on. What was unnatural in myself came unbidden to him. And, in some ways, the inverse was true too. A theoretical puzzle - if we two, in time and our close acquaintance, had grown closer to find those traits missing in the other and endeavored to fill that gap? Watson would say we completed each other. He was the writer, and the romantic.
And even with this surplus of data about my new flatmate at my disposal, Watson had managed to surprise me.
“Then I can be thankful for my own face,” he said, smiling. “I’ve been called an ass before, but not for that reason.”
“That you were dead,” he said, ending his own sentence like I hadn’t spoken at all. I had missed something. He turned to the window again.
That made him chuckle, as I knew it would. He liked Shakespeare’s romantic stories best, much more than the histories. I always preferred the tragedies.
From a distance, I saw Watson approach the scene of my fabricated crime. It would have been the scene of my demise, without luck or chance. I had written him a letter knowing it might be the last thing I ever put to paper - knowing that he would want those final words for himself. When we'd met he had been a shell of a man who'd previously been a doctor and he'd transformed, with slow time, into somebody very nearly a writer. It shouldn't have mattered to me, whether or not anybody heard the record of my last thoughts. My triumph should have been able to stand on its own. But it would matter to Watson. And I found, as I wrote them down, that I very much wanted him to know them.
And so we returned to Baker Street. Watson held onto his own elbow in the cab, careful to not put weight against his own shoulder. I stared past him at the dark street, and said nothing.
For a moment, still pressed together, we stared at each other. I didn’t dare to exhale. As soon as he’d fired the shot, Watson had gasped in great breaths of relief. The action blew hot across my neck and my ear.
“Usually,” Lestrade said, sour-faced, “I appreciate it when you’re right, Mr. Holmes. Can I ask how on earth you knew all that?”
It was something in his step, a figure disembarking from a train car at the other end of the platform with a careful unsteady grace. Head bowed and collar turned up, he paused to allow a young woman to cut in front of him, steadied her down with a smile I could not see but could imagine, then moved slowly into the throng.
“I have not,” I said, trying not to smile, “and I might like that if I had any reason to believe you were actually reading the newspaper.”
“We hardly parted on good terms this morning and you’re asking after the paper,” I pointed out. I could still hear his angry footsteps, the sharp slam of the door.
What I did next was an impulse. An illogical one, crossing an unspoken line we two had walked for years. Since I had returned. Perhaps since the very first day we met.
My hands were unsteady, a tremor in the knuckles I could not stop. The purely physical reactions of the body to its own emotion were inconvenient, and fascinating.
The platform was crowded with people, all impatient that the train should arrive. It felt strange to be in the city again, anonymous in a crowd when I had gotten used to a room turning to ask my advice. I relished it, and pulled my scarf around my face tighter against the chill. Even the press of bodies and rising voices couldn’t cut it, and it wasn’t until the tracks began to rattle and steam that time began to snap forward again.
“I have this feeling,” Watson said, and his words were slow, coming out of him in starts like he wasn’t sure of their destination, “that I can’t seem to shake.”
“She was,” Watson said slowly. He was careful in a way I appreciated, meticulous with his study if not with the details he pulled from them. “But that isn’t what killed her. Look, Holmes.”
“Mr. Holmes,” Lestrade sighed. “Dr. Watson. I should pretend to be surprised to see you here when we barely found out about this a half hour ago, but I haven’t the energy.”
But an idea in concept was not the same as being faced with a moment of physical terror, no matter how often considered. Watson belt double, clutching his left shoulder with his right hand. I absorbed detail; the tear in his jacket, the smell like burning fabric covering a low coppery tang, the pulse in his throat right under his jaw. His eyes looked to mine, their color lost in the late night gloom, and whatever he saw on my face must have startled him because he straightened faster than I could stop him. All in a matter of seconds, precious time to lose track of our target.
We sat in companionable silence for a long moment, looking at each other from our respective armchairs. The fire threw steady light and shadows across his familiar face. Watson sipped his whiskey, propped his bad leg up and opened the newspaper with a rustling of paper. I relit my pipe and watched the snow, now coming down in earnest.
The train disembarked in a slow exhale of steam, cutting through the cold air quick enough to prickle heat under my scarf. Passengers began to exit, jostling and shouting and waving.  In the steam and commotion, a hundred tiny reunions took place around me and I could count them all if I cared to. Couples and families and children calling beloved names.
“They could try harder,” I said. “So many of them are so obviously fake. I much prefer a good murder.”
“Well,” Watson said, smiling with a kind of open mischievousness that I’d come to recognize through long experience as an indication there was something he wasn’t telling. “I’m afraid it’s one of those mystery stories you abhor. The kind with pining lovers, and twins separated at birth, and a lurid murder. I’m also afraid that I did very much notice my bookmark has been moved since I set it down yesterday.”
My own knowledge, its scope and utility, hard-studied and well-earned I had always thought, felt momentarily insignificant.
“That I was gone,” I said. Completing his statement, stating the obvious. He didn’t move. I found myself talking still, nearly inappropriate in the night quiet. “I can’t say I’m surprised, given the general state of things there. It’s more of a surprise to discover one of their officers has the makings of a logical brain in his head. But I had hoped one of them might learn something.”
“Behave yourself,” I said, and swatted him away. His grin was boyish. It always drew to mind an image of the very young man he had been, long before we met. Round-cheeked and rugged and easily charming.
He ran, alone, away from the falls and towards the town and help. I turned, alone, towards the cliffside, and the future.
We had hoped to reach the street quickly enough to stop the impending disaster, but we arrived too late. It had taken me far longer to sort through newspaper archives than I expected, and so by the time I returned to Baker Street and all but pulled Watson out the door behind me, the sun was already darkening the sky. He had been surprised but game, already a pattern in the three cases I'd invited him to sit in on. Since the night of the Hope affair I'd had no reason to ask him to dash after me to follow a developing trail, and there was a part of me that was eager to see what he'd say.
“You honestly listened to me for once, that’s not like you?  Did you think I’d turn you down or withhold attention from you because of what I said?”
They made their way back to their tents and turned in for the night, after cleaning up the cans and making sure the fire was out.
John couldn’t help but gasp when he saw Sherlock’s bare arse, he had dreamed of it so often and now here it was and he so wanted to reach out and touch it, but he wasn’t sure how Sherlock would take that.
It may have taken several minutes more than anticipated, but soon they were on their way walking to Angelo’s since the evening was mild.  Sherlock could tell John was a bit apprehensive leaving Rosie alone for the evening since this had been the first time he’d ever done so outside of work or a case.  Sherlock guessed he didn’t want to make it a habit, yet he knew John needed some time away just for him.
John swiped his tongue over the shell of Sherlock’s ear, “oh, I’m quite impressed then. Not a peep from Mycroft all night. That must mean you were a perfect angel, a reward is order then I do believe.”
It took Sherlock no time at all to set up his tent and place everything in order.  John was actually impressed.
“Alright Sherlock,” he replied peering up at the mad man. “You have my full attention. Now tell me, what is it you would like me to do for you exactly?”
John smiled, “Yes I did, I guess it’s catching up with me, all the running around and back and forth.  I haven’t done that in quite some time.  It was nice.”  It was something he’d only admit to Sherlock.  “I think I’ll make some tea, would you like a cuppa?”
John could do that, though he made one slight adjustment. He moved the angle of his hips and adjusted Sherlock’s just a bit so that the next time he thrust he hit Sherlock’s prostate.
“John, I’m not so sure…” he rasped as John scooted closer in his bag and inched up to Sherlock’s ear, “Please Sherlock, for me.”
“Oh John,” she said waving her arm at him, “we’ll be fine. Now go on the two of you, you don’t want to keep the movers waiting.”
Of course, one appeared out of nowhere as if especially waiting for Sherlock and they got in and gave the cabbie the address.  John looked at his watch, “the movers are going to be there already.” he stated.
Donovan chuckled, “just a few more moments, I want to see if this is real or if they’re just messing with us.”
“Because then I couldn’t do this and have you actually feel it, it’s real and not a fantasy,” he purred before swirling his tongue around the head of John’s cock, stopping to pay special attention to John’s frenulum.
Sherlock smiled with tube in hand and made his way downwards, kissing and sucking marks onto every inch of John’s skin he could get to. He couldn’t believe what John had just asked of him. When he got to John’s hips, he kissed and licked from one side to the other and John fisted the sheets and tried not to buck his hips. He wanted to make this perfect for John in every single way.
John smiled and snuggled closer to Sherlock’s side.  A place that would no longer be empty now that they had each other.
Sherlock was silenced as John took him in his mouth and slid about half way down, pulling a delicious moan from Sherlock.  He pulled up slowly and let his mouth slide down again a bit further this time, before pulling almost all the way off and focusing on his crown and foreskin.  “oh God John.”
“Heavens no.  I was just about to sneak off to the loo and take care of myself because I thought you were asleep and the way you look was really turning me on, I can only imagine what you must have looked like in that tux.”
John nodded continuing with his ministrations, lewd noises falling from those sinful cupids bow lips and that’s when he heard the first branch snap and leaves crunch, but Sherlock was so focused on John’s fingertips to hear and much less care about anything else.
“No, listen, I wasn’t finished.  Sherlock, I hadn’t forgotten you but I thought you were dead.  You had been my whole life, the one thing good I had going for me and when you ‘
John thought about the prospects of making who knows how many phone calls and said, “I think I’ll take you up on that offer just this once.”
John’s thrusts were becoming erratic and he was so close “Sherlock I’m gonna come..” John gave him three more deep thrusts hitting that sensitive gland and that’s all it took. Sherlock momentarily stopped stroking himself as he came, white ribbons coating his chest. John felt Sherlock tighten around him and it took only two more strokes until he exploded in Sherlock. John collapsed on top of Sherlock, but only stayed there momentarily before rolling off to the side. He removed the condom and binned it then turned back to Sherlock.
Believe it or not, I did understand why you were angry with me when I returned.  I was angry with myself for what I had done to you and I would have done whatever it took to make things right and somehow, things worked out and tonight we stood on the cusp of something new.  And it terrified me because I know it will only end with me hurting you.
John thrust three more times erratically until he stilled and spilled deep into Sherlock and slumping on top of him.  He chuckled.  “Do not think it eludes me that those beads happen to be the same colour of that damn gem you were asked about this morning,”
Sherlock shook his head, “no, I’m rather enjoying this, but will you do me a favour?  When you go upstairs for the evening, can you take your journal along and put it somewhere away.”
Sherlock’s breathing hitched, “let me dry my hands and I’ll get it for you and I would like a cup of tea as well. Also there is no reason for you to help, I made the mess, it’s mine to clean up.” Sherlock finished, his voice shaky, he was hoping John didn’t notice all he wanted this moment to last, it felt surreal to have John pressed against him like this.
He deepened their kiss as his fingers trailed across Sherlock's plush arse and between his cheeks, teasing gently. He made several light passes across Sherlock's hole, letting him get used to the feeling, while getting used to the feel himself.
John’s girth and length were amazing but Sherlock was most pleased at John’s reaction while he hummed and pushed himself further down John’s cock.
Sherlock gave a noncommital shrug and continued staring at the screen.  “You seem to be enjoying it.”
Sherlock wondered why and wondered how to bring it up.  John was surely more comfortable here and Rosie loved it, Sherlock didn’t know why John continued to torture himself by going home each evening.  As he sat listening to the static on the monitor he was making a list of ideas in his head of how to bring John back to Baker Street for good.
Sherlock drops a finger to John’s lips, silencing him and shaking his head no, ‘I want all of you John, now and always.’
The next pass, he takes John further into mouth and he presses against his perineum and then trails back to his tightly clenched hole. Yes, it has been a long time since Sherlock’s taken him, way too long. This brought a smile to his face though, that means he would get to tease the good doctor longer.
“I swear, I only read the first page, and then put it down, it was your private journal and I know how you feel about your privacy. Although I did flip through and look at the dates.  It took you six months to forget me.  So I can only assume that’s when Mary came into your life.”
It took them about three hours to make it to Grantchester instead of the usual two, only to find it was a bottleneck trying to get into the town.  Sherlock motioned Lestrade to pull over so they could talk since cell phone reception was nonexistent.
Sherlock swallows thickly, ‘I want… I want…’ his voice trails off as he buries his head in John’s neck.
It started as any typical day at 221b Baker Street. John had made his tea and was sitting at the desk staring at the blink of the cursor on the screen. What should have been a quiet morning that allowed him time to update his blog was slowly turning into the morning from hell, all thanks to a certain consulting detective who was frantically pacing back and forth between the kitchen and living room. John couldn’t help but stare at him for a moment. Even in this manic state, the man was gorgeous. Tall, lithe, just plain bloody gorgeous, and don’t get him started on those lips – those stupid cupid bow lips, or the hair. Oh God, those curls. What John wouldn’t give to run his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. John snapped himself out of his reverie and returned his focus to his laptop. This was going no where fast. He should give up now. He knew there would be no way to get any work done until he found something to occupy Sherlock’s mind.
“I’m sure it was, but I saw your face when I referred to Baker Street as home.”  He took another sip and hoped he wasn’t about to ruin dinner.  “Sherlock is there something you wanted to ask me?”
“You want me to make love to you? For some reason if this ever happened I thought it would be the other way around.”
“Well just by quickly glancing around, this place should be easy to move in a short amount of time.  It’s got an updated kitchen and it’s in a good location, close to schools.  Perfect starter home for a family with three bedrooms and two loos.”
These thoughts are not good. You know how Sherlock feels, married to his work and all… Damn it, John could feel the blood rushing south and his jeans becoming slightly tight.
Still no movement from Sherlock.  John looked at him and sighed exasperatedly.   He moved towards the bed now and sat on the edge.  He wanted to take a hold of Sherlock and shake some sense into him, instead he placed a hand on his cheek and turned his head so their eyes met even though Sherlock looked past him, over his shoulder at some point on the wall.
“Thank you he whispered,” as he took the tea and placed it on the counter.  He didn’t know why, but he moved even closer and closed the last bit of space between them and rolled up on his tip toes again, their lips so close, the closest they’d ever been.
“No, definitely not, just let me have a moment….ahhh” John began as he felt a slick finger circle around his puckered hole. It wasn’t hard pressure, just enough to keep him interested but enough to come down until Sherlock began licking the underside of his cock very slowly.
He'd apparently spent too much time on this thought because John politely cleared his throat and motioned towards the box that occupied Sherlock’s lap.
I know you must be sorely disappointed in my earlier actions and spent a good amount of time debating whether to even open this and read it for an explanation and since it seems that you are allowing me the chance to explain, I want to say I am deeply sorry but thank you for at least reading this.  I assume you are most likely ready to leave Baker Street for good, this being a wakeup call and I cannot say that I blame you in the least bit.
It’s been two weeks and the transition of moving from the flat to Baker Street had been relatively easy.  Rosie took to her new home like it had been her home her whole life.  Of course, there were days where she was fussy, but that was due to her teething.  She had just had her six month checkup when the
John ran his nose down the long span of Sherlock’s neck, huffing warm puffs of breath as he went, his tongue licking here and there.  When he reached Sherlock’s collar bone, he kissed along the length, then down his shoulder to the crook of his elbow, before moving back up his body to the hollow of his neck, tongue darting out to lightly graze at his peaked nipple as he went.  Sherlock arched his back in anticipation of more, his hands raking up John’s back who had somehow now managed to position himself between Sherlock’s legs and effectively pin the lower half of his body firmly to the bed.
Sherlock had to try and keep from smirking but he was tired of waiting for things to progress.  Since that night they had slept together in Sherlock’s bed, it had happened a few more times and Sherlock knew how he felt and he was sure he knew how John felt, he just needed to help things progress along to the next step.
Speaking of Sarah, he was extra thankful she hadn’t fired him for leaving without so much a word, but then she knew the effect this would have on John.  In fact, she was one of the few that had helped him through the tough times and kept him from doing something stupid by giving him a reason to go on – a job and a purpose – in the end she was a good friend and he was thankful for that even after their bungled beginnings, and that is why she understood the effect Sherlock could have on anyone.
John agreed and looked quizzically at Sherlock.  He was up to something.  He followed Sherlock into the kitchen and watched as he clicked the kettle on and got the mugs ready.
Sherlock looked down at the box.  It was oversized and had a good bit of heft to it and he had no idea what it could possibly be.  John had truly gone out of his way to make sure whatever was in this box had stayed secret and as he finished tearing the paper away and removed the lid, he understood why.  In the box was something he thought lost to him forever, his beloved Belstaff, repaired to almost mint condition.
“Worked didn’t it?” Sherlock asked as he watched his fingers disappear in and out of John. It was the most amazing thing to watch, well almost, only one other thing beat it and John was soon ready for that part. He drizzled some more lube on his fingers and sat back.  John whimpered at the loss.
Did you bring camping gear, there’s a place I know out of the way that’s private, that’s where I planned on staying.”
“I’ll be up shortly dear.” she said as she turned to go back into her apartment to finish getting ready.
She apologised for having the party against my wishes, that she should have listened to me.  She hadn’t realised how cruel other children actually were, not when she had been blessed with two brilliant children herself.  She went on to explain that she thought by inviting the children into our home for a celebration, it would help them see how we actually were, she didn’t realise that these were not the type of people you could reason with.  She was only trying to help because she thought I was lonely which is why we were now headed to her friend’s estate.  I remember groaning because I thought this meant she was going to try and get me to socialise with other children but was shocked to see that when we arrived at the estate, there was a large kennel on the grounds. Her friend was a well-known dog breeder and apparently there were several litters that had puppies available.  When we walked into the kennel she leaned down and told me to go choose a puppy as my birthday present, that I had needed a friend and this seemed the most logical solution because she knew I adored the neighbour’s dog.
John snuggled in closer to Sherlock’s chest.  “You make me happy.  You always have.  Somehow we just lost our way from each other.”
About an hour and a half after John had left the flat, a grin spread across Sherlock’s lips as he sat at the kitchen table peering at a slide through his microscope as he heard John ascend the stairs to his old bedroom.  After John had left, he had raced up the stairs and dusted and fluffed the bed, he knew John would be back.
A devilish grin spread across Sherlock’s perfect lips. So perfect that John just wanted to lean over and lick them. They were just mere inches from John’s and all John wanted was to experience how those lips felt and taste them. Where was the harm in that?
With that first kiss out of the way, many followed.  It became a game while whatever was growing between them happened slowly.  Which in all honestly was fine with both of them, no need to rush what was becoming the most important part of their lives back together at Baker Street.
He was six when his family split up and fled the home-country – him and Harry were two weeks away from their first mandatory donation.
The disquiet between the two men is palpable, like magnets placed in proximity they are violently repelled by each other.
Which is to say, the style of clothing was not to his personal liking. The glow of the laptop lights up Sherlock’s features in an underwater shimmer, he’s already a thousand miles away, engrossed in code-breaking.
“You could have chosen more appropriate attire when rummaging through Erik’s room. A sheet is hardly decent.”
She had laughed. “Oh, don’t put words in my mouth, love. Let’s see. You know Mozzie’s can twist your thoughts around, right; make humans do things they don’t want to? Sometimes, if they’re really old, they can order each other as well. But Harry and you are special. Mozzie’s can buzz around your ear, whispering all sorts of nonsense; but they can’t change your thoughts. They can’t bend your knee. You’re my golden pair.” Her hair was curling in the breeze, there wasn’t a speck of blonde anywhere on her body. John had her nose though - the same frank assessment in his eyes.
John’s born in central London and smuggled over the sea; raised under desert skies, with a landscape that’s treacherous, shifting underfoot. He dismantles guns, learns to read, grows up with Baharat fragrant in the air and on his tongue. He sits cross-legged at morning, watching the raptors plunge downward on a draft, turn on a wingtip. He grows into a tidy child, small in stature and quick to offer his help. His mother, Dr. Eleanor Watson, supplements his education with field medicine and whatever books she can find.
Sherlock peers over his shoulder, trying to see into the house proper. “By the stench of it someone exceeded their monthly quota. I would have suspected Mycroft for gluttony, not you Councilman.”
“Oh, do shut up,” Sherlock says, irritably. Erik’s mouth snaps closed. “I was going to ask for a blood sample but you’ve fed since, haven’t you? After you drained Ms. Watson dry? Used your rations and more, now there’s no evidence of her left in your system. A tissue sample then. You said you had her head? Where?”
John basked in it. In the odd silence of his new commander, the camaraderie of his unit; in the rustle of his backpack as he jogged down a sand dune. Like Eleanor before him, like a palimpsest on DNA and history, war suited him to the bone.
It’s on the tip of his tongue to say something aloud, make his supposition known, but Sherlock’s face is bright with interest, distracted by his little game of intrigue.
With a ponderous sigh, the door eases shut. Outside, the sky is mauve with a single dagger of gold cresting the horizon.
Mycroft shrugs. “Clara Sullivan was registered as a nurse at the Mulgrove Centre. A curiously well placed job if one were inclined to ‘fiddle with the accounts’, as it were. She’s been arrested. The charges pending include misnaming of blood vials and the wilful tampering of government records. Given the amount of media coverage on her recently deceased spouse, I doubt Ms Sullivan will be executed for her deception, clemency might be best.”
“The borders are closed to outbound human traffic but that won’t sit well for long. ‘Sides, there’s nothing to say our shooter wants to leave the country. He could be taking a stroll up to the Lake District for all we know.” Lestrade trails off, looking from one to another. He scrubs his palm over his nape vigorously. “Lookit, I know things went down rather quickly, but neither of you saw the shooter? A glimpse? Not even a whiff of his scent?  Something that we can use to track him?”
The memory is livid. The shock in her eyes; the curious pause - how every man of kin froze in place, like wind-down toys – one: two: three seconds of absolute silence, then she was swarmed.
A line forms between Sherlock’s eyebrows: “What? You said compelled. Your exact choice of word is ‘compelled.’ Then how did she —?” A bullet collapses Sherlock’s right lung. It splinters the breast-bone into fragments, while the question is still half-formed. Stupidly, he looks downward.
Erik has masturbated to the image of tiny Harriet, enfolded in his arms; has seen footage of the riot that occurred afterward, when he realised there was nothing left in her veins and started tearing at joints, skin, muscle fibres instead. He thought the government had taken the rest of the video down, tagged as inflammatory, but it wasn’t done quickly enough to stop the beheadings in Basra, or the kidnappings of their brethren in Lyon. There’s been a surge in HLF recruitment, the dark Web filled with propaganda.
It feels like a crown circlet around his temples, a ratchet that tightens with each word, until his skull is split open and his secrets spilled. He haemorrhages words like a wound. “I could smell the injury when she fell; such an innocuous thing, a skinned knee, isn’t it? But her scent…Christ, her smell. I tore off every limb on her body. I drained her to a husk. Her head…her head’s still inside. I walked down Regent Street with it clasped in my hand, her hair knotted in my fist. I kept it. I can’t stop licking at the flesh...”
“It’s a rather distinct and overpowering scent,” Mycroft allows. “And it masked his own completely. He maintained a suppressing fire until we were locked inside the house.”
Pinned under Sherlock’s weight, Mycroft collapses, both of them sprawled haphazardly on the parquet floor.
Disgruntled, Sherlock turns the amputated head over in his hands. He had found it earlier, left neatly at the end of the long table, when there was a refrigerator in perfect order half a step away!
“Or a well placed spy.” Mycroft crosses his ankles. “Erik Dobson’s heart was obliterated. A kill shot made from considerable distance, and through the bulk of your own body mass no less. That takes luck. Or an extraordinary amount of skill.”
“If you are about to refer to my kind as a ‘Mosquito’, Detective Lestrade, I strongly advise you to reconsider.”
The exit wound is a pulpy mess, a through and through at a severe angle. The impact staggers him forward by a half-measure. Silver, he thinks, the casing consecrated by holy water, something else inside the mix, something excruciating. He has a millisecond, maybe two, before the agony hits and when it does, it razes every question from Sherlock’s mind.
Sherlock couldn’t help but fidget now. He wanted to run out of the flat. Sherlock looked at John in disbelief. “Would you like a list? 1. As you would most likely remind me, I am married to my work. 2. I am a machine with no feelings. 3. You are not gay 4. Being in any kind of relationship with me would be detrimental to anyone’s health and well being. 5….”
Sherlock’s brain nearly went offline, “no,no, this is fine for now, in fact I’d always wondered what  it be like to have this.”
“Seriously John, that sounds like it could be fun, interesting even.” Sherlock teased as he tilted his head and raised his eyebrow. “Would you use rope or handcuffs? And just my hands or would you also bind my legs? It would definitely help alleviate my boredom.”
John released the breath he’d been holding and Sherlock’s breath had hitched.  He was surprised and John beamed.  He loved this, being able to make Sherlock smile like this and take his breath away all in the same moment.
“Yes, it’s fine.”  John replied sorrowfully, “Same as it’s always been unfortunately.” He finished quietly more to himself than to Angelo.
“If you recall I did mention that the village was hosting a beer barrel rolling contest this weekend.”
Sherlock held her over his head and blew raspberries on her belly.  “How wonderful little bee, you get to try new foods.”
He slowly got closer and circled his finger around his hole, careful not to be too rough.  When he felt Sherlock's legs fall open further on their own and a moan rumble through Sherlock's chest, he pressed a little more, adding pressure in small increments each time he circled until he finally worked up the courage and slipped just the tip of his finger inside.
Sherlock had flipped through the sizable notebook trying to think of one reason to read.  He wasn’t even looking at the words, rather the dates and the further back the journal he got, the worst thing happened, for 3 weeks nothing, the fourth was
He got the tea and turned to hand it to John.  John had the brightest smile on his face, the one that was reserved specifically for Sherlock.
That’s what they did, they talked very little of the specifics and decided tonight they would give it a trail run.  See how Rosie would be sleeping overnight and Baker Street and see how things would proceed between John and Sherlock.  The finished the bottle of wine and their dinners and Sherlock opted for the tiramisu for dessert which he allowed John to have a few bites since Angelo gave them extra.  In the end, John ended up leaving a generous tip since Angelo never accepted money for their check and they found themselves walking the long way back to Baker Street through the park.
They removed the bed from Rosie’s room to make room for her rocking chair and dresser.  All in all, things went smoothly.  Mrs. Hudson stayed to keep Rosie occupied and to give her evening feeding so the boys could continue working on putting things away.
“John, don’t worry, I think everything will be fine. For Christ’s sake, you’re a doctor so I would imagine you have some practical knowledge of what you’re about to do.”
“John scooted down in the bed so it was more comfortable for them both and he replied “Deal, as long as I get to was your body.”
he screamed as he slammed the phone down and clutched the pillow tight to his chest, falling to his side, tears starting to fall, “except John.” He whispered into the otherwise silent flat.
Sherlock nodded and reached for his cup and took a small sip.  It was wonderful, exactly how he liked and he couldn’t remember the last time he’d had something so flavourful, not since John had gone out of his life again.  In fact, he’d gone back to his old ways of barely eating and drinking since that night four months ago, so he obeyed when John told him to eat and drink.
He kept the light heartedness going until they gave Mrs. Hudson her flowers and explained that John and Rosie would be moving back into Baker Street as soon as possible, to which Mrs. Hudson winked and said, “Tonight may as well be the night because I put her down for the evening.  She could barely keep her eyes open and I didn’t know how much longer you two would be and it would be such a shame to wake her John.”
New Year’s Eve arrived quickly and John had suggested they go to Angelo’s for dinner.  Sherlock had been delighted by the idea and called to make the arrangements.  The day had gone by quickly and around five, they both retired to their rooms to get ready for their seven o’clock dinner date.
Sherlock melted into the bed as John moved down his body, kissing and licking every exposed inch of skin, stopping and sucking on each nipple, causing Sherlock to arch his back off the bed.  He kissed down his stomach to his navel and then licked the tip of his cock, there was no more reason to tease.  He gently sucked him between his lips and took things slow, no need to rush things and have it over so soon, Sherlock had just made him feel like he was in heaven and John was going to do the same for Sherlock.
“John, I haven’t forgotten, I’ve accepted that I made some terrible mistakes and that it’s ok because we’ve ended up here together now.”
They stayed locked together, their bodies close, taking what they needed from each other and when Sherlock's fingertips dug into his back, John moved faster and Sherlock cried out 'yes, more, don't stop, don't ever stop.'
John met his eyes, “you have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do that.  He leaned in again, this time sliding their lips together, keeping the kiss relatively chaste, but more than just a brush.  He heard Sherlock whimper and smiled against those irresistible lips.
Traffic was light and it only took fifteen minutes for them to get to John’s flat.  As on cue they found the movers already working.  Rosie’s room had been entirely packed except for the cot and changing table, they had no use for one since she already had one at Baker Street. “I figure you can sell them on consignment or along with the rest of the furniture with the house since you won’t be needing it.”
Sherlock blushed and followed suit. He’d had nothing to be ashamed of, it’s not like they hadn’t fooled around before, they’d just never gotten quite to this state of undress. As he dropped the last bit of his clothing on the floor, John grinned and grabbed his hand.
John didn’t have to be asked twice and he didn’t mind Sherlock giving the orders for a few moments because soon enough, the tables would turn and John would take control again.  He helped Sherlock push his bottoms down his thighs and lie back on the bed so Sherlock could peel the offending item of clothing off.  As Sherlock tugged at the fabric, he peppered kisses down John’s torso, moving from spot to spot, avoiding the ticklish areas, then teasing at his waist as he finally removed the godforsaken bottoms and threw them across the room.
Sherlock had never considered this and as he went over all the indications that had been there, he cursed himself for not taking this possibility into account.  He was so lost in his thought that he hadn’t even noticed John preparing his fingers with the lube.  John circled his hole several times, relaxing him, making him forget how to breath.  As he slid the first finger in, Sherlock winced slightly, scrunching his nose.
John complied and within minutes, Sherlock was bringing him off, John having lost all sense of composure slumped over and begging for Sherlock to finish him off like only Sherlock was aware of how to do that.
“Ruining the mood love,” John jested before returning to Sherlock’s cock bobbing his head up and down slowly while he was opening the packet of lube and slathering two of his fingers then sliding those fingers across his perineum then slid back to his tight hole causing Sherlock to drop his legs wide open giving John more access for what he was about to do.  He began to circle his furled hole with his index finger until he felt Sherlock relax and then he slipped his finger in to his first knuckle and Sherlock gasped.
“Mmm, yes please,” Sherlock craned his neck, he wanted to feel John’s lips and teeth on his pulse point, he wanted so much from John, but that would be a nice start.
Soon Sherlock added another finger and John gulped and grit his teeth, tightening up around Sherlock’s finger.
“Nonsense,” Sherlock said waving his hand in the air, “he owes you for letting Mary slip by all of us.”
Sherlock wanted to scream, he didn’t know what to do.  He should have seen beyond the carefully constructed façade John had had in place, but he had been too worried about not letting his own mask slip that he completely missed that there was so much more to John Watson.  Sure he had seen through the most obvious parts of the façade, but John was cleverer.  John had hidden much from Sherlock, from everyone really and now it may be too late to fix all that was broken between them.
An hour and a half when Lestrade finally returned with three tents and meagre supplies, Sherlock was glad he brought extra provisions, however he did observe that Lestrade had managed to find two cases of beer. After twenty minutes of cursing by all three, Sherlock walked over, huffed and pointed “all three of you stand over there NOW.”
Sherlock lay on his bed, still dressed in the outfit from their evening out.  He was on top of the duvet, his arms crossed and fingers steepled under his chin.  He didn’t move, he didn’t acknowledge John’s presence.
Sherlock thought this was a crazy idea, but then he did like crazy although he didn’t know if after he could go back to normal after something like this.
Excuse the brevity of this chapter.  It's meant to be a transition and the muse isn't cooperating as much as I would like him to.  Hopefully this will ease me back into the story, I just wanted to let you guys know that I haven't abandoned it or given up on it, it may just take longer than usual between chapters.  And thank you for being patient.
Sherlock turned back to the stove top and picked up the spatula and finished cooking their breakfast.  He evenly dished out the food onto two plates and placed them on the table.
Sherlock was surprised, he did want to read, but somehow it still felt wrong even with John’s permission.  “I don’t know John, I’ve respected your privacy and I think it would just be easier to communicate openly from now on.  I will consider it, but it doesn’t matter now.  I think it’s better I hear it out loud from you, besides, you conveyed your feelings quite loud and clearly for now.”
The most cherished though were the silent perfect kisses.  When Sherlock would be at the table bent over the microscope inspecting a slide and he would feel a whisper soft brush of lips against his neck and a warm feeling flooding his stomach and a shiver running down his spine while a smile formed on both their faces. Or when Sherlock would sneak up behind John who was sat in his chair reading his paper, novel or medical journal, maybe even typing up their latest case.
He returned quickly with the candle and the rest of the dinner went beautifully, until dessert.  They had taken their time, spent hours talking about everything, things they’d never discussed before, well John had done most of the talking, but it didn’t matter, it was perfect.  There was just one thing that John had wanted to ask, he’d been waiting for the perfect moment and it seemed that it was after Angelo had delivered the tiramisu and disappeared.  The restaurant had thinned, as most people had left to go to New Year’s Eve parties and the such and it was just John and Sherlock and one other couple left who had begun to get ready to depart.  Now seemed like the perfect time.
“You were listening to our conversation when I went to get Rosie from her nap, hence the supposed slip about Baker Street being home.”
John loved it when Sherlock played coy. “Oh the possibilities are endless, maybe I should make you deduce it?”
In the end, they said their good nights and John scooped up his new jumper and disappeared upstairs to bed, while Sherlock hung his Belstaff on its rightful hook by the door and spent the rest of the evening cleaning up the downstairs and doing the few dishes left from the party before retiring to bed himself.  He had stayed up cleaning to distract himself but when he finally laid down in bed, everything he tried to keep himself from thinking finally came rushing in.  What exactly was happening between the two of them?  He tried not to think on it and willed his mind empty so he could sleep.
John shook his head and breathed out, “give me a moment.  He took a deep breath and then exhaled, “more lube.’
John craned his neck and looked up from his current position which was right above Sherlock’s left nipple and chuckled, “Sherlock, is that all you have because I can stop?  Go have a shower and then breakfast,” and he began to push himself up off the bed.
It had taken John Watson six months to forget him and it took Sherlock almost a year and a half when he got home (coincidently almost the same length of time he was gone, right after John had forgotten about him) to destroy all the good doctor ever wanted, a wife and a family and ironically, that turned out to be a façade as well.  A baby that wasn’t his and a woman whose proper name he didn’t even know.
John got the kettle going and made their tea the way he always did, Sherlock’s with sugar and milk and his black.
Sherlock hummed and shook his head.  “No, I’m fine and Rosie’s comfortable, did you enjoy your nap?”
John smiled; he liked the prospect of Sherlock sleeping in the same bed as him even if they weren’t intimate yet.  It was nice to share Sherlock’s bed and have the detective all to himself in a way he never thought possible before.
It wasn’t often he’d gotten like this but when he saw the picture of the jewel today, it made him remember the set of beads he purchased and he couldn’t think of a better time now than to try them.
He was wearing that damn purple shirt and John just couldn’t help but stare. He got up and quietly moved behind Sherlock and tried to get something from the cupboard above Sherlock’s head.  He know he had no chance of reaching it and he inched closer until he was pressing up against Sherlock’s back, and he felt Sherlock stop all movement.  John smiled, this was almost better than he could have hoped for.  He stood on his tiptoes and reached up failing to reach the cupboard and he felt Sherlock’s breath hitch.
John shook his head and let go of the sheets and went straight for Sherlock’s curls, guiding them back to his cock, “Please no more teasing. I want the real thing; I’ve dreamt of this for years.”
Sherlock remained on the sofa watching John’s every move.  John had glanced at his plate and was glad to see he had finished the toast.  “Do you need more tea?”
In no time, Sherlock was rolling the condom over his very hard, throbbing cock and reaching for the bottle of lube to slick him up a bit.
Sherlock and John were lost in each other.  John let go of Sherlock’s hands, whispering in his ear, “would you like me to take your cock in my mouth and give you the best blow job you’ve ever had?”
Time passed quickly and soon enough it was the holidays.  And even though it had been a short time that John had been home at Baker Street, he wanted to celebrate it properly, with the people that truly mattered to them.  They didn’t decorate, because Sherlock had always detested it, but they did have a few people over Christmas Eve – Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, Molly and Mycroft.  It wasn’t a big to do and John didn’t even have to threaten Sherlock to behave once.  Things had definitely changed, you’d have to be blind not to see it, but no one mentioned it.  Sure he still had his moments and could be a terror at crime scenes on the few cases they had worked as a personal favour to Lestrade, but there was now a softer version of Sherlock reserved for this room of people – those who had helped him or accepted him back without any pause after disappearing for two and a half years, oblivious, they had been part of the reason he’d left, to save their lives.
Rosie had been sleeping about an hour and John about the same length of time and Sherlock was still no closer to an answer on how to bring John home.  Just then, Mrs. Hudson popped her head in the flat and took survey of the situation.  She quietly made her way to the kitchen to join Sherlock.
He grabbed Sherlock’s legs under the knees and pulled him close. He lined himself up with Sherlock’s hole and looked at Sherlock as if asking his permission. Sherlock nodded his head.
John couldn’t believe his ears, “I’d like that very much.  I take it Mrs. Hudson didn’t rent my room.”
I’m sorry.  I know this doesn’t make any of this easier to hear or forgive the error I made in leading you on like I did, but I just need to let you know this is on me John, because I allowed myself to dream for a moment.
John nodded and thanked her, it was only half nine, but it was late for little Rosie.  Thank goodness for all the extra things he kept for her at Baker Street.  They showed Mrs. Hudson out and thanked her again and she said it was no trouble at all, anytime they needed a sitter, just ask.  They both laughed and thanked her again and wished her a good evening.
“Well then brother mine, shall I ring Mrs. Hudson, she’ll be delighted to come up and take care of you.”
They took their leave and headed back to Baker Street with all of John and Rosie’s belongings.  He was coming home for good.  Relief washed over him.
“Because I didn’t want to be rude and wake you last night when I finally came to bed.  I wanted you, but you were fast asleep and well… I do recall you telling me not to wake you and to go straight to bed because I needed to catch up on my sleep as well.” Sherlock’s voice trailed off as John inched closer.
It takes unnaturally long to shake himself from the memory and reorder his wits. They are both watching. “If this is to be a discussion of length it should wait for an appropriate time. It’s early, gentlemen. Return to your vehicle while you can, unless you prefer a crisp tan.”
After the wood is flushed, or tweezed out, Sherlock will need to replenish his lost supplies. Vampire blood would promote a faster rate of healing - preferably his maker’s - but they are not kin and some instincts can’t be bridged. Certain rules remain inviolate. Besides, he can hear the drumming heartbeats of Lord Dobson’s unsanctioned meal from upstairs.
Mycroft kneels upright, one hand on Sherlock’s chest to stop the random flailing. He rifles through the younger man’s pockets until he finds the mobile, extracts it, and places three calls in quick succession.
“I don’t have time to track down her wayward foot!” Sherlock snaps. “Not when I know you have her head! Give me a tissue sample! I need to run tests.”
John smiled softly and leaned up to brush a gentle kiss against Sherlock's lips, barely a brush, but he tried to make it feel like a promise, hoped that Sherlock would understand.
"No, I just... I thought we could go out this evening.  Dinner at Angelo's, you were very helpful on this last case, you've earned a reward and I know you enjoy the food there."
"I'm not asking you to change Sherlock, I know how important your work is, it is too me too," John promised.  "We can make it work.  If you want to.  If you don't, it's... I'll understand.  Nothing will change."
"I'm certain, Mycroft is grateful that you didn't..." John said.  "I'm fairly certain, I'm grateful too."
Last night had been fun, relaxing, the sort of thing John would like more of, but had never pushed for, because he was afraid it would give his feelings away... and he'd almost done that, hadn't he...?  He wished he could blame Mycroft, say it was his fault, that he'd stirred something in John, but it wasn't true, the feelings had been there for a while.  Mycroft had just made him think about revealing them, when he thought he'd long since decided he never would.
"You keep a steady supply of abandoned warehouses and car parks just for these meetings don't you?" John said.  He looked tired, no doubt because of the most recent case he and Sherlock had been investigating, Mycroft knew John hadn't slept more than an hour in the last forty-eight.
issues as a result.  He does not allow himself to care, John, because he fears that people cannot... that he is incapable, of being
Mycroft's bizarre conversation, if not forgotten, at least unimportant in the face of such a pleasant evening with his friend.
Disappointment, settled alongside dread and confusion, in his guts and he took himself off to bed, so Sherlock wouldn't see it.
Mycroft allowed him to leave.  He was certain he'd given John quite enough to think about anyway.  And he could always revisit the conversation later if John didn't react as he expected.
"I don't know if you've noticed, but I haven't exactly been doing a lot of dating recently," John interrupted, finding his voice again
The ten minutes John allowed himself to change and clean up, helped centre him a little.  Enough that he was pretty sure, Sherlock wouldn't notice anything amiss at least, even if he hadn't entirely been able to push the conversation with Mycroft to the back of his mind.
He stumbled downstairs and into the kitchen, flipping the kettle on and pulling two mugs down, automatically.
"Yes, yes, fine, I suppose," Sherlock mumbled.  "But if he'd stayed, I wouldn't be able to drag you down on the couch and practice my new found sexual skills..."
"Thank you, John, that would be lovely, but I'm afraid I'll have to take a rain check.  I have plans this evening," Mycroft said, standing, umbrella in hand.
"I..." John floundered.  "Really?  But what does this have to do with... I mean, I... we're friends, if my friendship is what... you can't think I'd just up and leave him because he doesn't return my feelings?  I care for Sherlock, I'd never, his friendship is enough."
This was, Mycroft supposed, the moment he had to make his choice, reveal something about his brother that if Sherlock ever discovered it, may irreparably damage what little affection Sherlock might still hold for him, or allow John to leave thinking that the whole matter was over with.
Mycroft shrugged off both John's question and the mild feeling of concern, for the man who was his brothers only true friend.
John laughed and followed him out the door and down the stairs, calling out a goodbye to Mrs. Hudson when Sherlock did.
Sherlock swallowed.  "I... I do... care for you... love you," he murmured, nervously.  "But I've never... relationships were never a priority, I don't... and the work..."
"I'm not lying, or saying it because I don't want to hurt you, or whatever else you're thinking... I mean it Sherlock.  I love you.  I was never going to say it, because I never wanted to make you uncomfortable, or lose our friendship, but if you... if you feel the same... maybe we can... try this, us."
“And now,” he continued, “that we are back here I seem to dream that I’m there again, and that when I open my eyes that none of this will be real - “
It was a marvel, how he said such things aloud when I had barely begun to try and make sense of them in myself. Baker Street - its busy street and seventeen steps, the things I had left behind scarcely moved, and its three inhabitants - nothing more than a dream. A reprieve, more mutable than memory. I was no stranger to that.
An inverse of what we knew. Old rhythms, well established, turned on their heads. I couldn’t bring myself to care  Where he led, I followed.
“Holmes,” Watson said, voice soft in that tone he adopted when talking to the families of murder victims and sobbing widows in armchairs. Something delicate, as if he expected me to flee. In spite of all my attempts, I was doing a poor job of disguising my own malcontent. “I promise, I am quite alright.”
The victim was a young woman who, two days before, had sat herself in front of us in our rooms at Baker Street and told us a strange tale involving doors that should be locked, and a gentleman following her in shadow late at night. From a distance, I could see her neck was bent and twisted. Nothing natural about the shape of her fallen form, nothing living. Two days ago, Watson had brought her brandy to calm her nerves, brought laughter to her face in spite of her fear. He attempted to peer past both Lestrade and myself into the alley, and I turned to block his way.
“She was struck from behind with something sharp,” Watson said definitively; if it were somebody else I might have snapped to spare the obvious but I let him finish. “While somebody had their hands around her neck. More than one man was here?”
“I’m fine,” Watson snapped this like a command to my unasked question, a rare tone of near-military precision that didn’t suit him or the words.
He had slammed the door behind him leaving that morning, an uncharacteristic physical display. And now, head tipped back over the chair, he returned without that thread of argument hanging over us. Either he was waiting on it - or he had elected, some time during the day, to let it go. I wasn’t sure which felt worse.
“And you loathe pointing out the obvious,” Watson said, which was well deserved. “You’re right as usual, old man. I can’t say that I am. I thought it might improve, moving back here. It did, after the war. Eventually.”
“Did you already exhaust the newspaper?” Watson asked from behind the folded pages. “Or would you like me to read you the agony column?”
“Eventually.” I remembered those early days. His chronic insomnia, his nightmares. They followed him like a shadow. The ones I saw around him now were different, slow to lift. That was true for both of us.
“My dear,” he said, “I was rather vexed, and now I am not. Tomorrow, you may well set fire to the curtains and vex me in a new way. I await the surprise. If you think you are capable of vexing me enough to truly drive me from this armchair, well - “ he squeezed my knee, his fingers now warm through my dressing gown. “You can certainly try. Will you hand me the paper?”
“It shouldn’t have happened at all,” I said sourly. “He caught me entirely off-guard. I should have expected he’d know we were on his tail and been prepared for that, should have known he’d retaliate - “
It was a curious thing, his anger. Sometimes it rose with a righteous determination from the bottomless well of his steady hands. Sometimes it was quick like a flash. He rarely held grudges, but he remembered arguments, like conversations, from the perspective of a storyteller. For my own sins, I had been known to linger on frustration or jealousy for hours or days. Watson didn’t like to let things fester.
I waited, raking the commotion with my eyes in search of my target, increasingly desperate as the minutes wore on and the crowd pressed closer to the train. I didn’t know what he was wearing, where in the train he’d been seated. I only trusted my own ability to know him through anything, no matter what.
“Don’t worry, Mr. Holmes,” he said, shaking his head. “You know we admire the doctor around here. He’ll be alright.”
When I least expected it, I seemed to discover a new expression on his guileless face, unfolding like a line of facts to be read and understood. His humor, his well-mannered bearing that nearly prevented any polite inquiry into my work, no matter how I paraded it in front of him. His level-headed awe that buoyed him through the Jefferson Hope debacle, and how he wrote down the details afterwards. His delighted surprise when I presented the twist in a case and my own reasoning that brought me there - which was nothing more than that. Delighted surprise, free of suspicion or unnerved disbelief, like I had never experienced.
Across the room, Watson tilted his head back to listen. One sour note, but he didn’t comment or notice. Quite the wrong tempo too. It didn’t matter. I followed the line of the music, the swell and pull. He didn’t comment as I finished the Brahms, but smiled, and so I rewarded him with ten minutes of Gilbert and Sullivan. In his face now I could see some measure of peace.
Then, suddenly, he moved into action. Watson exhaled sharply, and then began to pull at his own tie, and then his collar. He tossed both aside before I could open my mouth to ask if, perhaps, his wits had been shot clean off when the bullet grazed him. He had already turned his attention to his shirt buttons, his precise doctor’s hands flicking them open at his throat.
“Praise he didn’t attempt a head shot,” Mycroft murmurs. Beside him Sherlock moans; his short nails leave gouges in the patterned wood as he scrabbles as the floor. His grey eyes have gone hunter yellow, animalistic; his teeth have descended.
Mycroft leans forward to examine the shine on the point of his shoe. “It’s best if we can supply – or manufacture – a story regarding the brutality of her death. Especially at the hands of someone as old as yourself. Your drug excuse may well work, Erik. If a new chemical has interfered in how we process food, then your reactions were incited. If that is true: then we need to find out where it came from, who produced it, and tighten the laws regarding humans.”
“You mean the little tidbit I caught? The girl obviously took an illegal substance, a drug of some kind; I can’t be held accountable if my meal was tainted at the source. As the catch-phrase says – we are what we eat - but I do apologise if the result appeared... unseemly.”
“Did Harry leave London?” Australia, he muses, or maybe Africa. The hot places are best. Where the ground is baked; the sun worshipped for its devastation.
Eight steps up, one and a half-metres to the front door. It’s been so difficult to reorganise his thoughts, Erik’s’s been bogged in a quagmire for days. The smell of them, foul with excrement and sweat, heavy with blood, yanks at his feet. Before he can turn instinct into motion and move inward, upward, Sherlock catches him by both forearms. He stands torso to torso, uncomfortably close, and examines Erik as if he’s a particularly interesting bug. “Relax now, Councilman.”
The Holmes line took its stock from a single human tree; and in return, protected its wealth and estate over generations. Meanwhile the humans married, had children, grew up, grew fat; withered and died, until a descendent worthy of immortality was found. Rumours were, Mycroft had waited centuries. Rumours were, someone else poached from his human tree.
“The HLF have turned her into a martyr. A Collaborator with badly dyed hair. She never did anything noteworthy in life. A nobody. Why would they decree her a saint?” He peers into her milky eyes as if expecting an answer to shake itself loose.
Mycroft is a tall man with a hooked nose, his hair ginger but with enough product in it to render it near brown. He couldn’t have been more than twenty when turned; there’s a softness to his body, a perpetual roundness to his face, and an exacting demeanour that crushes any sign of puerility. Appearances aside, he is immeasurably old.
Standing directly in front of him, the bullet left Sherlock’s body and struck Erik Dobson in the left pectoral. It’s not a small wound. The bullet is not a neat, cylindrical object anymore.
“Your goons? I was shot, Mycroft! Twice! And I daren’t leave it with Lestrade; he couldn’t find his own arse with both hands in his back pockets.”
He was older than Mycroft when turned; almost thirty, and his body is immortalised in its prime, none of which is healing. Sherlock is riddled with sawdust and until it is flushed from his system the wounds will not close. His only saving grace is that he was standing with his back to the shooter, his wounds the mirror opposite to Erik’s heart shot.
It takes concentration to stand. His legs feel wobbly. Mycroft peels the bloody shirt from his chest with distaste, but leaves his personal armour on. He can’t hear anything on the street, doesn’t know if his driver is alive, if the armoured car had moved position, or if it’s now blocking the doorway. Nothing from outside can be heard and so it follows, too, the opposite is true.
“To be honest, not a lot. We found his nest on the second window of the third floor, along with an L115A3 with it’s A-frame, but Anderson’s not pulling up prints. Aside from Dobson, there were no other persons on the street other than yourselves, and this is a Moz – ”
Erik doesn’t take much from the conversation – his attention skips upstairs, to the warm bodies, it staggers across the road like a drunkard, to where the painter works in his derelict building, heart-rate steadysteadysteady – the only thing Erik gleans from Mycroft is that there is nothing left of Harriet Watson.
“We are what we eat. But we are also the palimpsest; the impression our fore-makers etched into our DNA. Abilities run in blood-lines but the more companions we turn the more diluted the power becomes. My maker didn’t like sharing; his abilities were for him alone. He didn’t need company. Or desire friendship. He wouldn’t weaken his position by creating another of his ilk and didn’t; for him, whole millennia’s passed by. He was insane when he found me in 1883. Quite insane. But I was the first human he turned – and he – he was my first blood.”
“Turpentine,” Sherlock says from behind his computer screen. “I could hear his heartbeat from across the road but I could only smell turpentine. He was perfectly calm. Even when he pulled the trigger the pulse didn’t falter”
Sherlock smiles, and Erik thinks he can see it, the shared madness like a sun flare in his grey eyes. The terrible power they would have wielded.
Mycroft smiles thinly. “There are matters we need to discuss, Erik, at length. Notably the events of Tuesday morning.”
“An oddity,” I agreed. “London seems to be awash with them these days. And they do have a way of finding their way here.”
He had seen more bodies with the life removed from them in two years before we met than I ever had, even considering my occasional excursions into the St. Bart’s morgue after hours. And he has seen men die. Men he knew, or even cared for. Men he had tried to save.
It was late, the night quiet. And it had been some time since I’d played for him or anyone to hear. I ghosted fingers over strings in scales, perfunctory. He was quite right; he could never tell a well-performed piece from a poorly presented one, and always mixed up his Baroque composers.
“I know that I am difficult,” I said, stiffly, “erratic, messy, and exhausting. A sane man would find me impossible to live with, no less weather it for years. I can only admire your patience."
“Well, that may have gone worse. The greatest casualty of the whole encounter is the state of this jacket.” Watson held the tattered garment up with one arm, frowning. “Torn clean through. And this stain! I should know better than to wear new jackets out when you get ideas in your head.”
“For about twenty minutes,” Watson said, genially. “And then I was too tired and too cold to be angry any longer. The older I get, the less pleasure I find in it.”
Watson’s eyebrows were set, a particular shape and cast I hadn’t yet seen on his face. In the first weeks of our cohabitation, I had made the kind of erroneous assumption that can sink a line of deduction like a clean shot; I’d assumed I had all the pertinent facts.
Watson lowered the pages halfway, to reveal his raised eyebrows. “You accuse me of pretending?” He asked. “If I wish to fall asleep before supper I will do so without shame, my dear Holmes.”
Sensation, surprise. I couldn’t hold onto detail fast enough. The weight of his upper lip, underneath it, his teeth. He tasted of tobacco. His mustache tickled. We were at odds and awkward until I turned my head and then we fit in a rush of heat. His hand on the side of my face; he touched my bottom lip with his thumb as he pulled away like he wanted to follow his touch with a second one.
I had taken stock of his tanned wrists and military bearing, his distinct limp and the way he pulled one shoulder tighter than the other - and made deductions. His tendency to startle at a sound from the street, and his late-night pacing, and his brother’s pocket-watch and nearly vanished accent - and made more. His carefully controlled anger, his deflection toward his own past and attempts to look like he was interested in my own, his obvious gambling habit and aversion to drink unless prompted. They painted a picture of a certain kind of man - unobtrusive, moderately intelligent, middling good company with shattered health and a few bad habits.
“I will have one more scar where I already have many.” He was watching me study him, and the act of being observed made the process more intimate. “In time, nobody will be able to tell it even happened.”
Sherlock smiled, leaning down and licking the come that had pooled on John’s stomach, all the way up his chest until their lips met.  John groaning as he tasted himself on Sherlock’s lips and tongue.
The more Sherlock begged, the harder John became. He was going to make this last as long as he could. They had both waited for this for so long and he’d be damned if it was going to be over in the blink of an eye. Besides, he had to admit, he kind of liked the fact that he could make the 'Great' Sherlock Holmes beg.
He leaned in and captured Sherlock's lips again, distracting him while he slicked his fingers and rubbed them together warming them. He was trying to remember everything he'd read to make first times enjoyable because the last thing he wanted to do was make this a terrible experience for either of them.
They both raised their hand as Lestrade went over and grabbed a bag and one of the cases of beer.  It didn’t take long before they became loud and raucous recounting stories of murder scenes that Sherlock had never been a part of. This went on for almost an hour.
“John,” Sherlock swallowed, he was pretty sure this wasn’t a good idea because of the way he felt about John but then here John was insisting they fight fire with fire.
Sherlock was beginning to see and understand John’s reasoning, but it did little to explain why he still chose Mary then.  “I couldn’t tell you.  The danger it posed was too great.”
When he returned however, he was surprised to see Sherlock sitting on the sofa with a beautifully wrapped gift in his lap as well.  He blushed when John looked at him and quirked and eyebrow, “Well, you didn’t think I would let you celebrate all alone do you?  I hope you like it.” He said quietly as he extended the package out for John to take.  Before John could take the gift though, he had to place his gift for Sherlock in Sherlock’s lap.  Sherlock looked down at it and couldn’t discern its contents by the weight or size of the box.
He closed his eyes and sighed as John’s almost illegible scrawl invaded his thoughts, John’s voice whispering in his ear as though he was sitting there lamenting over the choices he had made.
Sherlock waved his hand, “We have all the time in the world to figure it out, plus if we need to enlist the British government, we have Mycroft.  Our friends will be delirious, they’ve think we’ve been shagging for years, they probably assumed your marriage was a midlife crisis, and Mrs. Hudson will be over the moon.  Now let’s enjoy our first night out as a couple.”
The house is a sanctuary, built for his senses and it is blessedly soundproof. He’s tempted to ignore the salutation; slip inside and shut the world out, have a hot meal but that would invite further scrutiny and he can’t afford it. Best to face them on the street then.
He was thirteen when first bitten: the Mozzie whispered ‘Calm down, little one. Sleep. It won’t hurt.’ John had thrashed, cried out, fought ever harder.
A chandelier is positioned overhead, the electric lights glow soft orange as the motion senses kick in one by one. The house is hermetically sealed, solid as a mausoleum.
It’s Erik’s turn to recoil; possessiveness drops over him like a haze. “What about the Centres? Every citizen donates on a tri-monthly basis. There must be a blood sample somewhere.”
He has used Dobson’s shower twice in the interim. Mycroft had shoved the shower nozzle straight through the wound, chasing the bullets trajectory, stretching the hole obscenely. Sawdust splattered against the grout tile with a great gust of water: Sherlock remembers screaming once, then nothing. He awoke much later, tacky with human blood, and panted through a different set of memories, his body nauseous and his mind infected with alien emotion. The sound of Mycroft moving downstairs had stirred him into activity eventually. He stood. He had showered again. Now he is curled up on Erik Dobson’s couch, clad in a stolen sheet. His bare toes curl and uncurl on the armrest. He tosses Harriet Watson’s head from one hand to another.
