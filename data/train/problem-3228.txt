A cold chill suddenly invades the room, despite the heat the fire should be providing, and Dean shivers. Dimly, he registers Sam resume his reading, and starts working on the next step.
“You don’t look gay.”
No thoughts of Cas. Nothing bad.
he wants to see——is Cas.
It’s been two hours.
Cas appears seemingly out of nowhere. He looks tired——exhausted, actually——and a bit miserable, but Dean has never been more happy to dream about him. Cas looks around like he can’t see Dean, and slouches into himself. The shadows of the empty creep into his eyes, darkening them and draining them of their formally hopeful shine.
“It just didn’t seem right,” he says when Dean asks. I figured you’d want me to get out of the life, so I... I left.” The regret buried in Sam’s voice is so strong Dean can practically feel it. “I left her.” A lone beat of silence transpires before Sam speaks again.
And there you have it! The next chapter will be up in 3-4 days, or maybe sooner if I get a bit too excited about posting it :)
It’s not that Purgatory has changed, so much that it’s just really friggin’ huge, and Dean is noticing for the first time just how big it is. Pretty much every other time that he’s been here, he’s ended up losing and/or looking for Cas, and distance has seemed trivial with Cas’ life on the line. This time, however, there is no such motivation, so the journey drags on at an almost painfully slow pace.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean starts for him.
“Mmm-hmm.”
The painted sigils on Dean’s body have started to itch. He wants to pick them off, but that would mean almost certain death.
Chuck seems mostly occupied by Sam at the moment, so he doesn’t hear Dean approach, or if he does, he doesn’t have the time to pay attention to it. Normally, Dean would have no qualms about stabbing Chuck until he can’t get up, but this is Chuck in
for his family. It was all for nothing, though, because at the end of the day, Dean is just a person (and not a very good one at that) and Chuck is the capital ‘G’ God.
Dean isn’t going back to hiding. He’s not going back to thinking he’s not good enough.
Dean sprints the rest of the way to Cas, and drops to his knees when he reaches him. Cas’ eyes are closed. He looks peaceful like this; undisturbed and rested.
The minor headache Chuck ends up with is more than worth it to hear the sadness and anger that Jack screeches day and night. Apologies, promises to the Winchesters and Castiel that he has no hope of keeping, and the occasional threat when he tries to sound like Dean. The passion that goes into Jack’s attempts and rants is commendable, but——like the toddler that he technically is——Jack eventually tires himself out, and retreats back into his own mind.
See y'all soon!
He’s so cold. It feels like there’s a slab of ice in his chest, around his burning hot, pounding heart.
Dean can’t answer. Maybe he won’t, he’s not quite sure, but the words won’t form themselves correctly. He knows he should say he’s fine, brush off the sick, tar-like sorrow coating him, and get himself to Sam and Jack so he can help, but none of that happens.
Dean bites the inside of his cheek. This is all his fault. Fuck. “It’s——I’m not gonna do that anymore.”
He just needs to stay calm. Professional.
Of all the off the wall, batshit things that he has done, Dean Winchester definitely never expected to kick god in the balls. All the same, that is what happens next, because what the fuck is Dean’s life.
They come consistently. In the three weeks that Cas has been stuck in this illusion, he’s had a nightmare almost every time he’s slept. They’re not much different from the mockery of reality that Cas is stuck in now, save for the fact that Sam and Dean are always cruel. Cas wishes they would be more like that in the Shadow’s main reality. It would make it so much easier to hate Sam and Dean that way.
that it sends Cas spiraling again.
Maybe next time will be easier.
“Cas, do you think I would have stopped talking for
Nothing feels different by the time it’s finished. Dean doesn’t feel like he could punch a hole through a mountain, or cause an earthquake with a snap of his fingers, but he doesn’t know exactly what he expected. From the look on Sam’s face, he doesn’t feel much different either, but neither of them comment on that. At this point, all they can do is hope for the best.
Unfortunately, the wind——and accompanying dust——decides to change directions, and both Dean and Cas end up with a face full of ash. Cas doubles over coughing, and Dean is frantically wiping ash from his eyes when a familiar bright red car pulls up in front of them. The engine cuts, and a moment later, Sam steps out of the passenger’s seat.
Dean lets it go to voicemail. He doesn’t think he can move. He can barely breathe.
It would be so much easier not to fall for Dean all over again, even while knowing he’s nothing but a fake created by some petty cosmic entity.
Cas nods, listless.
Forever.
Cas opens his teary eyes, and focuses on Dean. This
Cas likes to think he’s good at acting when he works at it, so he starts to pretend.
Cas nods, short and jerky. He doesn’t think he could handle solitude at the moment. “Your room?”
Cas walks over and crouches in front of Dean. “You’re lying to me.” He places a hand lightly on Dean’s shoulder.
He reaches the top of the stairs, breathless, and pauses for a moment——just half a second——to calm the racing thoughts running through his mind.
wrong here.
Whether he does or doesn’t know, Dean will find out where the door is eventually. That, or he’ll punch monsters until they tell him where it is.
“Can——“ Dean pauses and clears his throat. “Can you give that to me?” He gestures at the bottle.
Next time Cas won’t want to stay.
of here, and we can get back to earth from there.” Dean trips over his feet and grabs onto a tree for support. Sam winces in sympathy. “And once we’re back on earth, we can nuke Chuck’s ass for real.”
That’s not really anything new, either.
Jack hopes that Dean sees him as a son, but sometimes it’s hard to tell, and Dean has said that he doesn’t think of Jack as family before. That had been a rough time for all of them, though, and the regret that had broadcasted from Dean after he had said that had been almost painfully strong, so Jack had no idea what Dean was thinking in that moment. Regardless: Dean
It’s familiar, even darkened and slightly dusty. Blood-tacky and entirely wrung-out, the Winchesters stumble into the bunker, and it takes everything Dean has not to collapse right then and there. Sam looks exhausted, too: eyes are ringed with dark, his hair is frizzy (which
And then, seemingly out of nowhere, a deep score appears in the earth on the bank opposite to Dean’s. Behind Dean, Sam goes completely still, and scans the bank. Another divot scars the muddy bank, but no beast shows itself.
Dean wishes that he had packed the holy oil glasses, but, in his defense, he hadn’t known the damn bull-snake would be
Tonight, Dean needs more sleep.
“Dean, please. I’m not——“
So why is it so difficult?
he wants to say.
Cas flips open the book and skims a couple of pages. “I can see.” His eyebrows pinch together, and he runs his hand down the page to better pinpoint the line that he’s frowning at.
Cas was making a peculiar sound too, very low and very soft. Dean could feel it in his chest pleasantly. He’d never made a sound like that at home. Dean pondered this drowsily, drifting. He felt relaxed and warm and like he was exactly where he wanted to be, Cas near and cherished. Cas’s funny vibration resonated in Dean’s chest. Watchdog snuffled at his feet, and that was a Hellhound, but she also liked belly rubs and they’d played earlier, so who could be afraid of a dog like that?
“Great,” Ella said, equally dry.  “What did Lucifer mean by everything’s dark?”
” blurted Ella. “Lucifer never does stuff like that. Also, like, now isn’t there a dead angel in your pocket?”
“Midsummer Night’s Dream,” Cas said, because of course he knew that one. Metatron had definitely dumped Shakespeare in his head, that time.
Ella beamed back at him. “He’s much kinder! He doesn’t kill people, for one. Pretty low bar. Also, he loves Chloe. He loves her
Actually.
“Alright,” said Cas
“So that was the creepiest question you could have possibly asked,” Crowley said conversationally.
Cas pulled out his cell phone, and suddenly Dean understood who all those other numbers in there were. He kept Daydream World phone numbers. Just in case he found his way back. He really cared about these people. Well, that was obvious, but it was still hitting Dean, with each new bit of evidence.
Turiel,” said Castiel.
“I will go whether you participate or not,” Cas said flatly. “They are not equipped for something of this magnitude, which is why I was
Aziraphale looked at Dean. Dean looked at Aziraphale. Dean had no idea what the Hell was happening.
“Perhaps—sometime between one and two hours. It may differ in this world, though.”
“Would a rogue angel just attack Crowley?” Ella asked. “That doesn’t seem likely. He’s Lucifer’s Left Hand. Attacking him is like attacking Lucifer. It’s an act of war, and Heaven and Hell have a truce.”
, if that helps,” said Dean.
“Oh! Oh, no, I’m sorry,” Decker said. She grimaced, awkward. “Lucifer here isn’t like your Lucifer. I’m not doing this right,” she said, kind of to herself. “We have
_______
Cas chuckled. “Me too,” he said. “This Lucifer is much preferable.”
Cas chuckled.
,” muttered Lucifer.
“Please don’t,” he said.
“He was a douchebag in our world, too,” said Dean
Actually, it was a relief. He had someone to take care of him, once Dean was gone. Crowley was clearly very protective. And this world seemed bizarrely safe. That was—good. That was very good.
The thing that had wrenched squeezed. “So are Crowley and Aziraphale.” He could see that, sense it, even having barely been here a few hours.
“He does not abuse me,” Cas added, startled, before Dean could say more.
Dean felt Cas relax beside him. “I see,” he murmured, and the worry melted into amusement.
Sam, clearly following his train of thought from whatever look he had on his face, rolled his eyes.
This had gotten wildly out of control. All the warm fuzzies were gone. The worst part was that Crowley was right.
“Daydream World,” Cas said, and he was sort of smiling. “It’s Daydream World, Dean. Everything here went right.”
Michael thought this was cute.
Cas grimaced. “She may be wary. Crowley says I traumatized her when I put her in that cage.”
“Uh, Cas,” said Dean, starting to feel awkward.
A wounded sound. The feeling of being rejected, unwanted, excised, useless. Leaving, leaving, leaving.
Sitting in the chariot was a demon. Well, presumably it was a demon; Lucifer had called the guy. He just looked like a guy, though he had a few weird, out of place scratches on him, and two small horns that curled behind his ears, like a ram.
“Yeah,” Dean said gruffly. “With Michael, and an archangel’s blade. But—you have to understand, that Lucifer—he tried to end the world, he tortured my brother, he possessed Cas—” Dean couldn’t really believe that he was justifying this, that he had to justify this, but Chloe watched him, assessing, and he knew that he did.
“What the Hell do you take me for?” Dean shouted, defensive. He stepped forward furiously, getting right up in Crowley’s face. He clenched his fists. “He’s family! Of course he’s part of the team!”
“Uh,” said Dean, who had no idea what a Greater Demon was, but it sounded bad, “Why?”
Cas’s feathers had ruffled up and he was clenching his fists, eyes fixed on Aziraphale, love and loyalty shining from every pore. Cas had looked at Dean like that before, Dean thought. It was weird seeing it directed at someone else.
“No, you may not do that again immediately. I might vomit, and I would dearly like to give that particular human experience a miss.”
Mantling, of course, around his most precious human.
“Yeah. Take care of yourselves,” said Sam, worried.
“No nothing,” said Dean.
“I want to trade,” Dean told Cas fiercely.
like Hellhounds. They had literally dragged him to Hell, once. It had been the opposite of fun.
“Not death, not really—”
alright? Crowley, you made eggs again.” He was of course unsurprised, but he still looked unhappy.
“They’re home,” Cas murmured. He shrugged his shoulder a little—not enough to remove Dean, but enough to jostle him a little. “Dean. They’re home.”
There was a brief silence.
“Beats me,” Crowley grinned at him, enjoying the attention even if Aziraphale had skipped the shampoo and was totally doing it wrong. “It was your idea.”
She smiled, hesitant, but she let him hand her up into the chariot.
“You’re not—” Dean told Cas, confused. He didn’t know what to do with that
, their city was in fact called Sunny
And he just gave Cas a hug. Like, a real hug. That was very different from home.
Do you know what a creep Paimon is
“Crowley is incredibly protective of those he loves,” Aziraphale said quietly. “And he cares for Castiel a great deal.”
“Then find another seraph,” said Dean, crossing his arms.
“Chloe’s house won’t permit imps to enter,” Aziraphale added. “Those are what you call demons, in Nightmare World.” He smiled at Dean. “And at Lucifer’s—only angels with special permission may go there.”
Crowley and Aziraphale came back late. The sun had gone down, and Dean had sort of drifted to Cas’ shoulder, curled up next to him on the remarkably comfy couch, while watching a frankly awesome movie series called The Weaponizer that didn’t exist in Nightmare World. They’d sent a letter to Sam, assuring him that they were alright. Sam had replied; Jack had apparently come out of his room in search of food, so that was good.
“You keep saying that,” muttered Dean. He pushed open the door.
They followed Lucifer and Chloe down the stairs and out the front door. There, waiting for them, was indeed a green freaking chariot, the royal kind, a stagecoach
“Oh yeah,” said Ella, examining the body. “Crowley wrote it. Amenadiel and Lucifer both signed it, and Michael and Maze witnessed it. It was super-duper official. Wings and everything.”
“Always,” Aziraphale said, and he smoothed down some of Cas’s feathers affectionately. “And while we’re at it we can get these sorted, hmm?” He patted Cas’s wing.
of love that was, though. It was the intense kind, the scary kind. He had labeled it
Dean exchanged a glance with Cas, and they got into Ella’s car. The interior was very tidy, and weirdly nicer than the exterior, seats leather instead of felted. The console was nice, too—it looked more modern than the rest of the car, like she’d had it replaced. Weird.
“Divinity,” Cas said suddenly. “Divinity works differently here, doesn’t it? It affects you more deeply if you’re not used to it. Lucifer doesn’t show you his wings very much, does he?”
Ella stared at him. “No,” she said. She sounded upset. She also sounded like she knew the gravity of it, the anathema of this demand. Maybe she had brothers, too.
“Satan help me,” muttered Crowley.
“I’m sorry, did he just say that Azazel is having a
“Look at this.”
He closed his eyes. Cas squeezed his hand.
“Thanks,” Dean muttered. He straightened and turned.
“Oh, yeah! I work murder cases with Chloe and Lucifer,” she said.
“So,” he said. “Paradox, huh?”
“My humans like flying,” said that first voice, defensively.
Besides.” He stood up straighter. “You do things for Angel Network.”
Dean snorted. “It’s totally for humans.”
“I’m sure he will, but you know Chloe. She’s awesome and independent. She won’t like it. Besides, being cooped up anywhere with the same people is rough.”
“Who’s that?” said Dean.
“We can start visiting,” Cas told him, still amused.
“Uh,” Dean said, eyeing their twined fingers. “Isn’t that a little—” he wanted a word that was like “chick-flicky” but couldn’t think of one. Cas’s palm was very warm, for a guy who wasn't technically human.
That—was a thing that Dean had absolutely seen in spell books before. He’d always thought it was some kind of plant or something. Come to think of it, they had always seemed to have an endless supply. “Huh,” he said.
“That’s an exaggeration, Crowley,” Cas said, though he sounded shocked. “We don’t die if we lose our feathers. We Fall, maybe. We lose our powers. But we don’t die.”
Secret dreams of Cas living in the bunker full-time, always, without ever running off alone. Of being able to wake up in the mornings and see him there, the first person, before Sam, even. Singing along together to the radio in the Impala. Meals where Dean ate, and Cas sat with him. Playing games, watching movies, teasing, just to see the confused look on Cas’s face. Cas teasing
“I’m sorry,” Cas blurted. He sounded frantic, but to Dean’s relief he looked unharmed. He was fidgeting his wings on his back nervously but didn’t seem to be in pain. “I know you don’t kill angels here, but he attacked Crowley, and I didn’t know how else to stop him.”
Chloe smiled. “Thrumming means ‘I love you,’” she said. “You know, that big deep one, that resonates in your chest?” She looked around and then made the sound, low and soft—it didn’t resonate right but it was a damn good impression.
a Hellhound?” Dean blurted, watching the dog cower. “Seriously?”
“Alright?” Dean asked, concerned.
She smiled. “He’s kinder than he thinks,” she said. “And he’s been in love with Chloe for so long that it kind of hurts. He follows her around like a puppy. He’s super generous, too, and he likes people a lot – you can always find him in the precinct making friends or trying to solve people’s problems. He doesn’t do favors in the precinct – I think Chloe told him not to – but he still helps. You can just—you can just tell how much he loves it here. Earth, I mean.“ Her smile went fond.
“And it’s more than you think,” he added to Dean. Dean blinked at him.
Below them, the Fourth Circle of Hell flashed by as the chariot made its dogged way through Daydream Hell, on their way to Nightmare World, and an increasingly bizarre Nightmare experience.
Sam chewed his sausage. He held out a hand. Dean gave him the letter and watched his eyebrows climb up his forehead.
“Oh, yes,” Aziraphale replied mildly, strolling over to help Watchie out of the hedge. “Now, do you have any thoughts as to materials?”
Serpent, knowledge; teaching people was kind of his thing.
“Ask Lucifer,” Cas said, mouth all quirked up in a smile.
“Thanks.”
Dean nodded. He did want to do this, after all, though he said nothing because Cas seemed worried. He didn’t like to see Cas that worried, especially not about something that everyone else seemed to think was like, the ultimate good thing. Even Ella had been excited.
“Dude, gotta say, this is my favorite Hellhound.” Watchie wagged her tail. “Don’t get too excited,” Dean told her, amused, “the competition wasn’t that steep.”
Lucifer knocked on their door, way too soon. “Are you finished fornicating?” he demanded.
“So, it
“You got it, buddy,” Dean said warmly. He could whittle something.
“Yes, but we try not to kill Greater Demons here,” Cas said.
it right back to Crowley’s place, far more urgently than before. The car lunged forward unexpectedly, and they hurtled down the quiet street.
“Angel attacked Crowley,” said Cas into Dean’s hair. His wings tightened around him protectively, and Cas’s other arm went around Dean’s waist, holding him close. It was awesome. Dean really liked those wings. They were soft and good and they were
Dean took a step back himself, reeling. “You have no idea what you’re talking about,” he spat.
“What do you mean he’s not taking care of himself?” Dean said, alarmed. He felt pulled in kind of two directions, here. In one, this demon was being a douche. In the other—what was that about Cas neglecting himself?
, you know. We all love you here.”
“You will not go to war,” Cas said firmly. “It is not just you. It is Lucifer as well, and it is us, the ones in Nightmare World. War is not for you, Crowley.”
Dean gave him a weird look. “Funny way of showing it.” Watchie left the stone and rolled in someone’s yard in the corner of his eye.
that held up a black feathered wing. When his eyes met Dean's, he
“What?” asked Lucifer.
Next to him, Cas’s feathers fluffed indignantly. Some part of Dean thought that was hilarious. Another part thought it was incredibly weird that Lucifer of all people was demanding that Dean

“No way am I telling you,” she asked, coy. “No
And it was a sight. At home when angels died, they left sooty impressions of wings, great and splendid on nearby surfaces, but here there were
He gave the wooden, scaled one to Dean.
Watchdog inched from behind Cas and very carefully sniffed Dean’s palm. He was kind of bracing to be bitten and bitten hard, but she didn’t do any of that. She sniffed, and then she licked him, and then she bolted back inside.
“Very good,” Cas murmured. He spoke on top of the sound, at the same time, like he wasn’t using his breath to do it.
And Cas was immediately mobbed by a man in a tweedy, old-looking jacket, with blonde hair and great, off-white wings.
He sometimes put footnotes into Aziraphale’s letters. They were usually funny. He liked to doodle snakes in the corners, too. Honestly, Dean really should know their names by now.
“Mom.”
“Really evil,” she said.
He had fair blonde hair and blue, blue eyes. His breathless words were intelligent and somehow more English-accented than Crowley’s had been, and he also had the mannerisms of an extremely gay human. This would normally make Dean nervous, and it did make Dean a little nervous
“But the Nightmare World angels can find you there!” Lucifer cried.
“Masaharta never threw me out of my own house!” Crowley snapped. “Never left me lost and alone after Kemset died! He cried on my
Jack can be ignored, though. He can be, and he will be, because he needs to be for Chuck to find his missing toys.
Cas… well, he goes through the motions as well as he can. He’s already tired, but the hopelessness of knowing everything is fake drains him further, and there are some days that he can’t make himself get out of bed until Dean urges him.
He keeps stacking papers. He’s spent hours gathering everything he can find on how to kill a god. It’s all stuff him, Sam, and Cas have gone through before, but there needs to be
Jack attacking comes as a slight shock, but it isn’t too much trouble to take care of in the long run. A couple well placed blows to the head, and shrinking the room that Jack is in until there's no space to move works wonders. Still, by the time that Chuck forces Jack into sleeping, he’s completely lost track of Sam and Dean.
“Sorry,
She had gotten worried when Sam hadn’t answered her calls and texts after a week, and had tracked his trail to a possible djinn case in Dakota. And that was where she had found Sam’s body, drained of blood in a barn eerily similar to the one that Dean had died in. The Impala——covered in two weeks worth of dust and grime at that point——had been parked in front of the barn.
It’s very...
Thank's for reading, comments and kudos appreciated!
He shifts in his seat to face Cas better. Cas scrubs the last of the tears from his face, and looks over at Dean. His eyes are tear-glittery, too, but not broken and dull-looking like they normally are when Dean breaks down. It’s all tears of exhaustion, joy, relief. Not sadness.
Okie dokie, end chapter two! We'll get to Heaven next chapter, and the plot will really start to move.
Dean doesn’t do that, though. Instead, what he does is curl up on his bed, and let his tears soak into the mattress until he passes out.
Later, Cas overhears Dean talking to Sam about it. Apparently Cas had been out of it for the better part of an hour before Dean was able to get through to him.
And, of all the possible things, Dean is currently leaning against the outside wall of a building in a grimy alley, covered in blood, and waiting for Sam to emerge from the sketchy convenience store. Sam had taken all of the money they had, and run in to get the basics: food, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and first aid supplies. He had chosen himself over Dean, because Dean was more than mostly drenched in blood in various states of drying, and dirt.
“Dean! Hey, Dean! Wake up!”
he stuck to girls? One night stands, hookups, and quickies in the car are more his style anyway. Dean has never been good at relationships anyway, and Cas——or any guy (or celestial wavelength who just so happens to present as a man)——is probably better off without him. Why had he even tried? He's probably just keeping Cas shackled more than anything. Maybe Dean is faking. He probably is. Just wants the attention.
He appears to be having a difficult time of it. There are tears now, large and salty, coating his cheeks and dripping onto his arms, which are folded on top of his drawn-up knees. Jack is too tired to notice, and Sam pretends not to in order to help preserve Dean’s dwindling pride.
Maybe Dean can reason with the empty——the Shadow. They’re both dark creatures now, both nearly on the same level in terms of power, so there’s no reason that Dean shouldn’t at least be able to try to reason with it.
Sam just looks plain disgusted, but that is slightly offset by the fact that his daughter has started chewing on the collar of his flannel. The velvet scrunchie pulling his hair back doesn’t help his somewhen serious expression either.
Cas says irritatedly. “So much to think about and I can’t——I can’t turn it off.” He sniffles. “This——it’s what you do when you don’t want to think.”
Dean. There’s a brightness in his eyes that the empty will never be able to replicate, no matter his hard it tries. It’s his soul——his pure, beautiful soul——shining through. Even with his grace so wrung that it’s practically useless, Cas can see it.
“I don’t know!” Dean leans back against a tree. “I don’t know——okay!” His eyes are shiny, worried, and bloodshot. “There's always a door, though, and I know that I’m grasping as straws here, but I need——I need
Behind Sam, Dean manages to get to his feet, and nearly collapses as he does. It feels like his entire chest has been shattered——and who knows, it might have been——but he stays on his feet, and surveys the scene with pain-bleary eyes.
But, in the moment, it feels real enough to Dean to ease the persistent ache in his chest, if only a little.
He’s startled out of his solemn disgust by Cas’ voice, and his sudden appearance in the doorway.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean sighs, waving Sam off. “Better question:
Jack usually spends his weekends at the bunker, and weekdays bouncing between Sam and Eileen’s place, and the bunker. He’s finally not in the middle of some world-ending event or another, so he’s learning how to socialize, and finishing up school. It’s all going surprisingly smoothly, which is a relief. All things considered, Dean had expected everything to be a bit more stressful, but it just... wasn’t.
Dean hadn't meant to fall asleep.
“I think we should burn it.”
It’s in the being.
Sometimes Cas still has moments. Times where he can’t remember what’s real or fake, and what’s real or not. Sometimes things that the Shadow did will blend with what’s happening in the real world, but never badly enough for Cas to hurt anyone.
are we?”
——they’ll work. They have to, because otherwise, Dean is going right back to where he came from, and he has a feeling it won’t be pretty.
“North?” Sam groans in pain as he stands up, and runs his hands through his tangled hair. It falls perfectly into order, and Dean wonders (not for the first time) if Sam has magic hair. “I don’t know for sure; I was kind of busy saving you.”
It’s quiet again. The silence isn’t awkward, per se, but it isn’t entirely comfortable. There are too many things hanging between them. Too many words left unsaid.
It’s not there.
(Of course, it wasn’t really ‘after’ Chuck, was it?)
“Of us.”
Dean braces himself, and barely manages to keep both him and Cas upright. “Hey, hey, you okay?”
“Dean, what are you——“
Then the bunker collapses in on itself, with Dean at the heart of it.
Maybe the constant driving is a good thing, now that Dean considers it. Driving keeps him moving; he’s not on the run exactly, but stopping feels dangerous.
“I’m fine.”
They had gotten to Jody’s at about noon, but didn’t manage to leave until past seven. And when they did leave, Dean had upgraded from the passenger’s seat of Cas’ Pimpmobile to the driver’s seat in the Impala.
“Oh, Dean.” Cas hugs him. “I’m sorry.”
In a dramatic sun of events, Dean Winchester is not dying. He is simply in an almost unimaginable amount of pain.
“I——I think I’d like that.”
“Are you okay?”
Dean decides that now isn’t the time to mention that Cas isn’t exactly a man. Instead, he just focuses on not crying.
Surprisingly enough, that seems to hurt Chuck more than the angel blade had, and it makes him angry enough to slam Dean into a tree. Dean yelps in pain as a sharp branch tears his clothes and scrapes against his ribs. His head knocks hard against the tree, and everything blacks out for a second.
Cas wants to say that he misses Dean, too, but he won’t give the Shadow the satisfaction.
It’s gross. He’s not going to pretend it’s not, because there is
“Anyone else you can think of?”
It’s almost like they never died in the first place. They’re still cooped up inside, what with not being able to leave their carefully warded home without Chuck crushing bones to death. It’s terrifying, of course, but it’s a steady terror, and Dean acclimates to it easily. Of course, food is going to run out eventually, but Dean has gone days without eating before, and he can do it now.
Cas is dizzy. He’s cold, and his eyes are watery with pain. He can barely see through the tears, and everything hurts.
He walks into the void, and it closes behind him.
Dun-dun-dunnnn!
“Dean?”
When doesn’t he?
is real.
With the threat of the world ending gone, a weight had been lifted from Dean’s shoulders, and it had taken a couple of months of panicked nights and reassurances that everyone was still alive to and from everyone on the board, but eventually Dean had been able to let himself start to smile again.
Though he had no words for it, Dean was wanting Castiel to be comfortable, and to have a gender that was closer to what he actually felt, which was agender, rather than male, instead of spending so much time and effort mimicking something he was not. Aziraphale would have cooed over a choice like agender, a human gender that was close to the genderless state of an angel, while still maintaining a multifaceted human experience. Of course, Castiel never would have thought of this on his own; it took Dean, a human, because at the end of the day only humans understood gender. One day, when they had this discussion for real, Castiel would decide to keep ‘he,’ since he was used to it and the word was rather meaningless to an angel anyway.
She woofed at him, very quietly, tail still wagging. “We gotta get one of these for Sam,” Dean murmured.
“You have to stay with Jack,” Cas said.
“Chloe does Lucifer’s, Linda does Amenadiel’s. I should have taught Bakt to do it, but I was too messed up in those days. Total lost opportunity. It’s a family gesture,” Crowley told Dean. “Preening. It’s the sort of thing your family does, or your close friends or your—I don’t know, angels don’t have spouses, but that’s the gist. It’s incredibly isolating when no one does it for you. You should have been fixing his wings years ago.”
Dean blinked at Aziraphale, very confused and a little annoyed that he was poking Cas when Cas was clearly so relaxed, but then Cas sighed, and he made that weird sound again, the low, soft one from last night that resonated in Dean’s chest.
“Sorry,” said Dean gruffly. “Thought you ought to know.”
--------
“Absolutely not,” Cas said, horrified.
“Surely Lucifer will help with that?” Cas asked from the back.
“Much,” Cas agreed, warm and fond.
An act of God. An act of God to violate a treaty to start a war that could end in the apocalypse—
Funny or not, a demon was a demon was a demon, at the end of the day. Betrayal wasn’t a matter of
“He has a red blankie,” Castiel said gravely. “He hides under it.”
“Absolutely not,” Cas snapped, cutting off Dean’s “Hell no!” before Dean could really get more than a few sounds out. At least they were on the same page there. “Amenadiel,” Cas added, weirdly desperate.
Love? Since when were they talking about love? Dean clenched his fists, but Aziraphale spoke before he could say anything.
“No,” Dean said again, a grin tugging at his lips. “You’ve got to be kidding.”
“You know. Small stuff.” She grinned. Dean hooted a laugh. He hadn’t expected her to confirm it!
“Wait—wait—” said Dean, catching up. “
. “He’s not useful! He’s a
“Seriously?” Dean muttered, but he continued.
“Union of two opposites,” Cas said. It was exactly what Crowley had said, so it was less than helpful. He looked uncomfortable. “They are unnatural, and they do not—feel—good on the senses of another Celestial. Both parties must be—keen—in order for it to work. It cannot be forced or done unwilling, and it requires trust. Truth be told, Dean, I know very little about what it actually entails for the participants beyond that fact that everyone seems very enthusiastic about it.” He was flushing, a little
It was an ironing board with a pillow and a blanket on it.
“It’s fine,” Dean said, a little bewildered. “I have literally never seen you sit backward in a chair, but it’s fine.”
Now that was handy. “Huh,” said Dean, watching as the giant dog peeked at him from behind Cas, all sad eyes. “So, if I named one, say, Terminator it would become the Terminator?”
“No, it’s not,” said Aziraphale softly. “Come sit,
“The what?” asked Dean.
“Is there anything that might make an angel crash through the First Sphere?” There was a pause. She frowned. Her frown deepened. “Lucifer?” A beat. “Lucifer, you okay?” Another beat, and her eyes widened. “Oh my god is this a Fall thing? It is. It so is. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean—” He interrupted her, clearly.
“Good—good,” said Cas, relaxing. “I will not be able to speak to you once we get to Hell; I’ll be carrying the spell,” he said. “I know it is still strange—but you can trust Lucifer.”
Chloe looked at him skeptically
“To you?” Dean asked, frowning.
.  “But Castiel will catch on eventually. Look.” He paused and shifted his weight, like he was uncomfortable. “I’m kind of getting a miscommunication vibe here? Angels need preening. It does things to your head when you don’t get it. I would know. Your boy down there is particularly bad – he never does it himself for some reason. It itches when it’s not done. It hurts. It affects your balance and your flight and your health. He says you’re his family. If you’re his family, he needs you to do this for him. He’ll never ask, because he’s a prat, but it’s important.”
Chloe wriggled out of Lucifer’s embrace. “Alright. Are we done? Because Dean and I really do need to talk.”
“Different,” Cas gritted, like he was in pain
. “Seems a little extreme,” she said. “Will that make it stop? I mean. Heaven and God are different, and Heaven is just as manipulative.”
Dean threw it anyway.
She leaned back a little.
It was a short drive. The body of the angel was in a tree, blue-and-silver wings stretched limply, long enough to almost reach the ground. Its head was lower than its feet, and strange, silver-colored something oozed slowly from its mouth. Cas had stabbed it through the heart, because he was nothing if not precise, Dean thought with a weird kind of pride.
“Ouch!” Dean had tried the same thing, though much more carefully. Castiel didn’t stutter in his song, but he flailed a little, pulling Dean away from the sharp feather and looking aggrieved. Dean had cut his finger on the feather, just a little, but it was still deep enough to be vicious. Angel feathers cut humans like butter. “Still sharp,” Dean said. “It’s not him; it’s you.”
freaking out about was the dude-shape. Who cared if Cas was dude-shaped? Cas was Cas. And damn it all, but he really did love Cas. Had for a while. A long while.
Ella kind of wanted to know what the Hell Castiel meant by
—And that wouldn’t help him save the world! This was a losing battle, Castiel thought, grimly amused.
“What even
” she blurted. “Linda and I. Special-human-support-group. I wanted to invite you.”
The thirty minutes passed slowly. Cas eventually got his coat off, and both of their shoes, and he tugged them to the bed. Dean was incredibly up for sex, because he wasn’t over Jimmy but hot damn he wanted Cas, but this was apparently the last thing on Cas’s mind. He pulled Dean close and stretched a wing over him. That was good. Wings were Cas and wings were good.
, even if the process of him getting it back had been incredibly bizarre.
“And you think we could do that?” Dean asked. That could definitely come in handy. He trusted Cas a whole Hell of a lot, after all.
The interior was beautiful, all modern furniture, wood floors and a clean paint job. Lucifer hurried them along up a curling, fancy staircase and then into what was clearly a bedroom.
And then he died! And
Which was how Dean ended up with Cas grabbing him from behind. Arms like steel bands wrapped around his chest and under his arms. Dean tried and mostly succeeded not to scream at each beat of those evil, terrible, and not beautiful at all brown wings because he could
“Nah,” said Crowley, playful. “You love us. We’re your favorite. We’re taking you to the Sunset House, and we’re going to feed you good food and better wine, and you’re going to forget all about this.”
Cas was standing on the house’s large deck, with Crowley leaning on his shoulder. Crowley was breathing hard, slumped. He looked—wrong.  Cas held him up, wild-eyed.
----------
“He was given direct orders,” said Michael, from the grass.
“He wants me to kill my brother,” said Dean.
“Am I supposed to offer you a hand?” hissed Cas, looking distressed.
Dean looked at Aziraphale, who nodded, and carefully pushed the wing closed, so it folded neatly on Cas’s back. Cas sighed, and kind of slumped forwards.
Dean looked up. Lucifer was standing on the porch of a great, sprawling Victorian house that definitely hadn’t been there before the paradox. Dean and Cas were on the front lawn.
. It was gilded, open and large with a bit for the guy driving the horses and a big section for everyone else.  Of course, there were no horses; it was pulled by
“Oh, no,” said the black angel.
noise, but she got her arms around him anyway, warm and soft, and she squeezed him like he was a tube of toothpaste. She stepped back. “I’m Ella,” she said. “I belong to Lucifer. Or he belongs to me. Not sure how that works, really. You’re one of Castiel’s humans, right? The hunter?”  She bounced.
“Everyone keeps saying that,” said Dean.
Cas gulped a little. “Ella,” he murmured. “Would you mind waiting in the car? I have never done this before, and I do not want—well—”
Cas nodded. “I know. But it’s—good. This place. It’s good.”
“Yeah, and he says it’ll take an act of God, or an order from God, to make an angel crash through a Sphere like this.” She nodded at the angel. “So, what am I looking at?”
Good feelings gone. Dean glared at her and spluttered, insulted.
“It’s a game,” Cas said, amused. “It makes Watchie nervous. She thinks they’re fighting. It’s alright,” he added to the Hellhound, reaching down to scratch her ear. “They’re only playing.” She whined again and put her head in Cas’ lap, begging for scratches.
It was easy work. Dean could smell that comforting dusty honey smell, and he hummed a few bars of
Ella seemed curious. “What did he do? You keep saying he was a dick, and I’ve heard a few stories, but I don’t really know.”
and he loves that girl, but he doesn’t know what he’s getting himself into. She’s fourteen! What’sss he going to do when she starts dating for real?”
“Dote, seriously? What the Hell century is this?” Dean said, to cover the fact that he was also embarrassed.
“Huh,” said Dean.
He would move worlds for her.”
“No,” said Chloe. “Promise. Just—”
like nothing Dean had ever heard, a demonic growl, and the hairs rose on the back of his neck. It was deep and menacing and Dean would have reached for a weapon, except Aziraphale made a bell-like noise in reply, and they were off at a dead run, racing to—somewhere deeper in the house.
What was that about Cas?
Cas had settled right beside Dean, carefully curling a great brown wing around his back. This was feathery and kind of nice, and Dean permitted it, especially since Cas’s wing was big enough that it didn’t hamper any sort of movement. Also, it meant that he could fiddle with that sharpened primary. He kept tearing paper napkins on it, just for the Hell of it. Cas seemed to find this amusing.
“My dear!” gasped Aziraphale. Crowley took his hand but otherwise said nothing. He looked directly at Dean, instead.
Aziraphale’s forehead wrinkled. “I thought he was dead.”
It also meant that Dean was his vessel. He met this angel’s eyes head on, a challenge, and they looked back at him, calm and amused, like he had the best secret ever
He and Sam could never leave the life. But Cas? Hell. Cas could. Wow. Wow. He had friendly angels, a family even, just itching to take him in. That was freaking excellent, actually. “What about Jack?”
Shepherd, of course, was guarding the entrance to the lift in Lux, because she was a good dog, while Maze stalked through the club, looking for intruders.
“Yeah. It’s weird. I know it’s weird, and the timing’s weird, and everything’s weird. But we’re the only two humans to successfully pull off a full paradox. We’ve got to talk. Linda’s—not quite there yet.” She shrugged.
Cas came back over, having hung up. “He is—very alarmed,” he said. “He’s taking Michael and they're going to go to Heaven to investigate from there. He doesn’t know who gave that order or why. I do not know who is dangerous in this Heaven; I’m told that Uriel is dead.” He sounded worried.
, with his mortal enemy no less. That changed everything. “And I took a walk with Aziraphale, and Crowley and Cas went flying to cool down.”
Cas had massive clumps of the stuff like knots under his coverts. He pushed his wing into Dean’s hand when Dean got a good one, and that made Dean grin. This wasn’t so hard, and it wasn’t so bad, either. That honey dusty smell was comforting. “What’s it feel like?” he asked Cas.
This was all true! Castiel had no idea what he was doing, paradox-wise, or Dean-wise. “It’s not like sex, you know,” Crowley had told him dreamily once. “Like. Not even a little bit.” Which was just unhelpful. Castiel was so confused.
“Who are you calling?” Cas asked.
Dean was sort of half-asleep. Cas was warm and pliant, and the movie played quietly in the background – he’d turned down the volume, but Dean was too drowsy to really do anything about it. Dean was curled up all along Cas’s side, Cas’s arm over the back of the couch. He wasn’t really sure how they’d ended up like this, especially because he was quite sober
“Angels need things,” Crowley said, eyes like poison, fixed on Dean.  “They need preening, they need faith – in something, doesn’t have to be Him Above because Him Above is a prat – but they need
Amenadiel nodded. Dean watched them walk off together down the lane, until abruptly they vanished, presumably flying away.
What. No. No way. He smelled like pie. Really good pie. He was stinking up the room! What the Hell! What angel smelled like
Sam chuckled.
“Seriously?” Dean asked, delighted, “Since when?”
Dean had still killed an alternate Lucifer! What the Hell! How was that okay?
“This one’s not,” she said. “Evil, I mean. And he’s—mine. Don’t—don’t hurt him.” She swallowed, but otherwise held his eyes, almost fearless. Dean was impressed.
before the sulfur in Dean’s face cooled, and the air went fresh, and the light brightened. He felt it when they soared up through air, up through a Hellgate; they were on Earth again. Somewhere down the line, Lucifer stopped singing, once the sky had turned earth-blue and not Hell-red.
Dean thought about what had happened. It had been awesome, and full of honest-to-Chuck joy; they’d definitely warded this invisible house, and its invisible contents, to the teeth. The place felt kind of saturated with them too, and there were others—Crowley and Aziraphale, he could feel them too, they felt like eggs, like raw eggs—was this why Crowley kept making eggs
Dean Winchester had a lot of things on his mind.
Amenadiel used that one a lot. He did it when she came home from work, even, a pleased sound that she interpreted as “I see you and I’m glad!” when she came through the door. It was incredibly endearing. Angelic  vocables were complex and varied and also fascinating. Though in Linda’s definitely, absolutely unbiased opinion, thrumming was the best one. Chloe agreed so it must be true.
Not that Watchie would know what to do if Dean really did try to hurt her Crowley. It confused her when humans were the bad guys. She could watch him, though! She was good at watching.
Another letter. This one zoomed into the room and dropped on the floor. Cas picked it up and opened it, but Dean could see it.  It was very short, and written in ornate, elegant script, different from before.
Lucifer huffed
“Hello, Beatrice,” Castiel replied warmly. Apparently, he knew her, and that was another level of weird, somehow. “You’ve grown.”
, even if Aziraphale really did seem to dote on this one.
Michael did have such fun teasing his eldest nestmate.
“Shut up, Lucifer,” Cas muttered.
“I kind of do too,” said Chloe. “Nightmare World sounds terrifying. But it’ll buy us time to find a solution. Besides—You’re my partner. I can’t let you go alone.” She smiled at him tremulously.
“I beg your pardon?”
, so let’s not tempt him.”
Aziraphale had gotten Dean a sandwich from somewhere, because it was lunchtime. It was a good sandwich, too. Dean was pretty sure it had fancy cheese in it. After, Aziraphale beckoned Watchdog, and he and Dean walked through the small neighborhood. The place was pretending to be suburbia, but the houses were all just a little too big, just a little too stylized, to pull it off. They were mansions, all, and it was a little intimidating.
“We just need the right spell, and I don’t have anything of that magnitude in my library,” said Lucifer firmly. “It’s worth the risk.”
sticking up in the sky, and it totally hurt to look at. They crossed over onto a disk and the whole world reoriented itself and Dean wanted to vomit. There was shrill screaming and song, not just Lucifer’s, but then there was another disk and they were over a city, and then a marsh and then mountains and on and on and Dean just shut his eyes and worked on not shitting his pants. Dimly, he noted that the guy with the orange wings flew off as if ordered elsewhere, but only dimly. This was way worse than flying at home.
Alright then. Dean got his nails in there and pulled and got a whole clump. Cas sighed and slumped a little, like Dean had scratched a particularly bad itch. Huh.
“This place is so weird,” Dean muttered. Case in point: the Hellhound begging him to throw a stick that had been a stone two minutes ago.
“Boof,” said Watchdog, looking at the stairs. Dean followed her gaze.
“Helloooooooooooo! Anybody home!” said that other voice peevishly. “Castiel! Snap out of it!”
, Crowley.”
. These two things together were almost funny, except that Dean was in Hell surrounded by the loosest definition of
Cas shook his head. “A living human can’t pass through their Hell without a special spell. It requires two seraphs—”
Aziraphale did not rise, instead cradling Crowley close. “Stay safe,” he said, solemn and sad. “You too, Pigeon, Dean,” he added.
She led him outside again. The back porch was large, and it looked out onto a perfectly sculpted backyard, all inside the paradox-wards. The porch ended in a big round area, covered and with a fan. There were couches. Chloe sat on one, and Dean sat across from her.
But there were serious things happening, and it was time to talk to Lucifer. He squeezed Cas’s hand, and then opened the door.
“Dean. Jack just got his soul back. He’s a little freaked out,” Sam hissed. “
“You can’t live with Maze, Monkey,” said Chloe, amused.
This was saying something because Azazel was also a creep.
gone to shit, because Dean really wanted to tack a ‘sweetheart’ at the end of that sentence. He stopped himself just in time.
Fair warning: Dean's got some internalized homophobia. But he's also kind of love-drunk and a goofball, so these thoughts should hopefully come off as kinda funny (Dean oh my god are you serious) rather than painful. Dean doesn't hate anyone; he's literally afraid. He's got lots of things to be self-loathing about, but falling in love with a man(shaped being) isn't one of them. He's just a pile of flailing question marks and mental gymnastics in this chapter. It's okay, he gets all the cuddles.
Dean slid Crowley’s dowel under the feathers the way Aziraphale had. It wasn’t that hard. The down was coarse and scratchy under his fingers, like dust, and it did indeed disintegrate. He rubbed at it. It had kind of a smell to it, too, though nothing bad. It smelled like—well--dust, but a little sweet, distinctive the way honey was distinctive. Weird.
Dean only knew about Lucifer’s Cage. “Who’s Islington?”
Amenadiel muttered something uncomplimentary. That lie had saved all their skins!
“All good things, then,” Dean said, gruff.
Dean laughed, delighted. “I have to know what you did. I
This was—kind of weird and awkward. Dean didn’t really know what to do with that. Luckily, Watchie ran full tilt after a crow, missed her lunge, and crashed into a nearby hedge. It kind of ruined the moment.
“Thanks,” said Dean. He watched Cas kneel down to hug Aziraphale and run his fingers through the feathers of Crowley’s good wing
The demon nodded. His jaw was clenched, but he didn’t say anything else.
Sam nodded. “He mentioned Lucifer.”
“Dean?” he asked, anxious.
--------------
“Lucifer,” sighed Chloe, though she looked amused. “Okay. So—trapping—God? What would that even look like?”
“That upsets the natural order,” Lucifer said with a frown.
It was Beatrice, oddly enough, who made a funny small angel sound at him, kind of a cooing low in her throat. The fire in Lucifer’s eyes died down, a little.
----------
her, he thought. She continued, “Then he kind of followed me around and became my partner. Work partner. I had no idea that he was
Aziraphale was trying rather desperately to teach her that life without her llama was not terrible, and sometimes left it behind for short walks if he could, with varying success.
“What do I need to do?” he asked, taking a step forward.
The world was great. Every world was great.
Dean looked down. His fingers were covered with pale brown powder down. “Oh. Yeah. Hey, Cas, do we use this stuff?” He shook his hands and some of the dust fluttered to the floor. It wasn’t particularly gross; it felt like very, very fine sawdust.
Lucifer pressed closer to Chloe at that, clearly disliking the thought of her dead. Though there were still seeds of red light in his eyes, he frowned. Concern for Amenadiel? Dean wondered. “More than that. They’ll pinion him,” Lucifer said, soft.
Thing was, he liked Ella. She definitely reminded him of Charlie, and she was spunky and thrilled and she knew about cars. That she somehow—belonged—to Lucifer the way Dean belonged to Cas was incredibly confusing. Never mind that Dean had always thought Cas belonged to
“Shit,” said Dean.
Cas snapped his fingers. The body shrank into a pebble. He picked it up and pocketed it.
Forensic scientist, Dean thought again, impressed. They so needed one of those.
“Yeah,” Dean interrupted, raspy. “It means I’m yours. And you’re also mine. Decker and Ella said it went both ways.”
“How?” said Dean.
Crowley barked a laugh, and Amenadiel groaned, “Michael.”
They landed in a driveway. Cas carefully put Dean down. Dean got his breath back, hands just above his knees, bent over and gasping. Crowley and Aziraphale were nowhere to be seen.
“Vengeful bastard, ain’t he,” Dean shrugged.
Cas shrugged. He still looked embarrassed. “No one with ill intent can enter Aziraphale’s bookshop,” he said. “Linda’s house is similar, though I’m told it won’t show up on GPS maps.”
“Yes,” Cas said. “Are
“He’ll try,” said Dean. “Billie—that’s Death—said he was ganking everyone. That he was almost done.”
“I know how many of your so-called friends die. And that’s your world. But in
“You’re the only human in the room,” Crowley told him wryly. “And therefore, the only one who actually needs to eat. You get first pick.”
Ella swallowed and looked up the stairs. “What do you think we should do? About this. This apocalypse—thing. Everyone says you’re a professional.”
“None of this
A lump formed in Crowley’s throat. No, there wasn’t a catch with him, he promised silently, touched.
Aziraphale smiled. “I miss him, too. Crowley worries endlessly for him. You have quite a few monsters, and that Naomi.” He pursed his lips.
“A half life,” spat Crowley. “Like Raguel. I won’t stand for it, not for you, Pidge, not when all it takes is for some
He shook his head. “Unless he gives me a reason, unless he hurts people, I won’t.”
Dean nodded against Cas’s throat. Jimmy’s throat—Cas’s throat. Whatever, the angel was the only one home. Cas’s throat. “Yeah. Yeah it can. It will. Promise.”
“I can handle myself,” Dean said gruffly.
Lucifer harrumphed, still looking beyond pissed, but he still led them inside.
“Hellhounds are different here,” Cas said. “They are defined by their names. A dog named Killer will become a killer. Watchie is called Watchdog. Her function is to guard Crowley and Aziraphale, and also humanity, if she can.”
“And the more difficult you make it, the better it is?” Dean asked wryly.
“Yep. Got it, and something extra.” He pulled two, like,
Dean swallowed. Cas was an angel – this was not even close to news. He’d even brought up his long lifespan a time or two, but it was not the kind of thing they generally talked about in detail. It was—weird, knowing that Cas had some kind of plan beyond Dean’s lifetime. Good weird, actually, but still weird.
“All good things,” Cas agreed. “Of course, all good things, Dean.” He sounded drowsy.
from Nightmare World, and he killed Nightmare Lucifer. Who knew what this man was capable of? He was all sweet green eyes and asking earnest if slightly awkward questions about how to take care of an angel; it was clear he cared about Castiel. That was a point in his favor, but this level of intensity about murder was kind of alarming, never mind that he’s actually killed Nightmare Lucifer. Maybe it was worth it to keep an eye on him, Chloe thought. Just in case.
“Uh—what?” Dean spluttered. What the Hell? “You have a mom? Cas?”
On the other side, Dean’s boots sank into muck, and a really, really foul stench made him gag. The place smelled like an eight-day old carcass after a rainstorm on day three, with a heaping helping of literal shit on top. It was much brighter, too, for a given value of bright. He was standing on a huge mudflat, instead of amongst craggy stones. The light was reddish and dull, but no longer blocked or distorted.
“Will it help if I keep mine out?” Cas asked. “Or if I remind you that he was trying to kill Crowley?”
“No,” said Aziraphale. “The more effort you put in, the more of yourself goes in, too. Chloe’s porcelain was not especially difficult to obtain or to make. But she was choosey and thoughtful. Linda’s was quite easy; she’d had that plant for years, simply growing in her house. I believe it took her a few hours to make it properly. It all depends on what you put in it.”
“Crowley!” gasped Aziraphale and lunged for him. “What happened?”
“Not if it’s what—what Chuck wants.” She gulped, clearly unable to bring herself to say
Cas—well, Cas actually
“He came back,” said Cas.
“The first thing you are going to do, Dean Winchester,” Aziraphale said, still severe, “is pull all of this out. Powder down is made to crumble; it will disintegrate in your hands. You will not hurt him.”
Yeah. Paradoxes were the best.
Cas, Cas was the best friend he’d ever had, more than a friend even though Dean still wasn’t sure what that entailed, Cas was family,
“Yes,” said Michael. “But we need more than just you.” He looked around the room. Dean had no idea what the Hell he was talking about. And what was with all the dogs?
Ella put her hand over her mouth, eyes huge. “What about us?” she whispered.
Dean blinked down at the letter. “What?” he blurted.
This just kept getting stranger. Cas didn't seem alarmed, though, so Dean followed the famed Chloe Decker out into the sunlight, curious about what she had to say for herself.
“That,” he said, “is
“He wants to go to Nightmare World,” said Trixie, hands on her hips. “To straighten this out. I told him he was being stupid. I also want to know why nobody paradoxed little pendants, you know, like necklaces? Then we could go to work and school.”
“He’s also going behind Cas’s back,” Sam said, and that was kind of a compelling argument
“What about now?”
“How quickly?”
“Doesn’t make it less annoying,” Crowley muttered.
to Amenadiel! Even Maze doesn’t behave that way and she’s one of the
“Tell me about it. But he has wings. Does he need this, too?”
“He will not hurt her, Crowley,” Cas called back, exasperated.
So, like, that was weird. Big head angel liked humans. Go figure. “No offence,” said Dean, “But what are you doing here?”
“High as a kite?” Dean said.
“Doesn’t mean he has to be a douche,” Dean muttered, kicking a stone. To his left was a great house that sprawled in all directions, including up. How could anyone live in that much space? The bunker wasn’t small, and it echoed sometimes, with just the three of them. These houses looked twice as big.
showed up in front of the Sunset House.
“What do you mean?” Dean asked, feeling less charmed. This universe was so weird, man. And it didn’t look like there was any pie here at all. That was disappointing and kind of a cocktease. Pie-tease. What was with that smell?
“Different world,” Cas said. “Different rules. Trust me, if not him. Let him heal you. I promise he won’t hurt you.”
“I can also transform the body, afterward,” Cas said. “Into something innocuous.” He cocked his head. “It’s not in a vessel—I can manipulate it.”
“Are you knocking my baby?” Dean said, warning.
?” That had been in Aziraphale’s letter, come to think of it. He hadn’t made the connection.
“Crowley,” Cas chided again. “In the other world they
Crowley made a whining sound that even Dean knew was bad. He lifted one of his wings. Dean had literally just learned angel anatomy this morning: most of his tertiaries had been torn out, and there was a vicious slash in the skin beneath, like someone had tried to cut off his wing midair.
“That——uh——yeah,” Dean says. A weak, teary smile crosses his face. “That works great.”
That makes Chuck even more angry than he already is, and sixteen seconds later, Dean’s right arm looks like it’s grown an extra joint. He just grits his teeth, lets blood dribble from his mouth, and tells himself that it will all be over soon. Either Jack will win, or Chuck will. He stops hurting both ways.
“Cas——“
“Look alive, Sammy,” Dean calls, trying to keep his tone upbeat as he tosses part of the organ Sam’s way. Sam makes a both disgusted and exasperated face, but catches it anyway.
(Unless he dies again, that is. Who knows what’ll happen to him then.)
“You scared me,” Sam says, decidedly not eating whatever he’s burnt. “Do you have any idea what you’ve done to yourself?”
because otherwise——fuck.” Dean raises a hand to his face, and fresh blood coats his fingers. “T-this is why I’m not supposed to think about it. This is what happens if I do.”
*Carver Edlund*
It’s been a few hours since Cas came back, and things are surprisingly calm. Sam and Eileen had gone off to bed after they were certain that Cas we okay, and now Cas is alone with Dean. They’re sitting close, next to each other in the slightly uncomfortable chairs at one of the tables in the main area of the bunker. There’s so much that Cas wants to say, but he doesn’t know where to start.
“Cas!”
Cas is home!!! Gay feelings talk time!!!
Am I posting on time? Probably not. Anywayyyy, Cas! He's in this chapter! Fuck yeah!
Just like Dean has always been the muscle, and he’s not even that any more.
The phrase ‘absolute power corrupts absolutely’ comes to Dean’s mind. If he looks it’s easy to see where Chuck’s powers have formed fissures in Jack’s being. Cracks in his skin, dark veins... it’s too much for the kid, and his body isn’t going to be able to take it for much longer without breaking down.
much less four hours a night (which really isn’t enough for him anymore).
Dean doesn't have it in him to fight against it.
Again.
He’s angry, and he has every right to be. Two choices are in front of him: kill his son, or back off and probably plunge to world into some sort of disaster or another. It’s fucked up, and entirely unfair, but since when has anything ever been fair for Sam Winchester?
Well, Dean is certainly not thanking Chuck.
Dean reaches out, shakes Cas’ shoulders roughly, and Cas makes a small, annoyed noise before cracking open his eyes, just slightly. All the air rushes from Dean’s body, and he shakes Cas again. Cas coughs, and looks up at Dean with glazed, half-lidded eyes.
he prays, though some small part of him knows that Cas will probably never hear it.
That thought in mind, Chuck attacks.
Something tells Dean to step out of the car. He does, and looks off the edge of the bridge. Quietly, so subtly he’s hardly aware of his thoughts, he wonders what would happen if he jumped off. A low, nervous tug in his gut tells him to stop considering it.
Briefly, Dean wonders what happens if you die in Heaven.
Despite appearing to drink nothing but alcohol, the sheer amount of tears that Dean manages to produce is, quite frankly, shocking. Still, Chuck is just a little bit disappointed. Dean hadn’t been created to
fine.”
so he tries to fix it.
Sam hopes it’s not too late to patch things up, especially after he pushed her away. What he did, he’s not exactly sure (thanks, Chuck), but he prays it’s fixable. He doesn’t want to lose something he was so close to having. He’s endured enough loss over the years.
toilet.
And things like Jack.
Cas traces the faint outline of the sigil he had used to keep Billie out, which is still imprinted on the dungeon door. He wonders what would have happened if the warding had lasted another few seconds, and how Dean would have rejected him.
He blinks, and tears cascade down his cheeks. They run along Dean’s already tearstained jawline, and land on his jacket, above the handprint. The noise coming from Dean’s still-ringing phone is the only sound he can seem to hear; even his own panicked breathing and the erratic
Sam doesn’t know exactly why he had insisted on patching Jack up. Maybe it had been just to fulfill the instinct to protect Jack, to make sure he was okay. Sam knows that it was stupid, he probably wasted resources, but having at least tried to do something to help Jack heal up makes him feel a little better. He thinks that he’s finally starting to understand why Dean would get so meticulous about patching up even little cuts after a particularly stressful hunt.
Dean watches Sam walk into the main part of the bunker, and checks the garage’s locks for the third time before he follows his brother into the empty shell of the place he calls home.
“Cas,” Dean says, placing a steadying hand on Cas’ shoulder. “There’s something you need to do before we can leave.”
“I have to,” Jack insists. His eyes are bright with determination, and just a hint of worry. He takes a deep breath. “The sooner we do this, the better. If I can open the door, you have ten, maybe twenty minutes to find Cas before it closes again.” Eyes dark, he looks at Dean. “Forever.”
It’s colder on the other side. Colder, but somehow still muggy, but it’s more homey than Heaven. It’s where they need to be, and even with all of the monsters there that certainly have blood out for Sam and Dean, it feels miles safer than Heaven.
“Cas.” His voice is softer this time, packed with emotions and overflowing with things that he had been too frozen to say earlier. Yes, they’re pressed for time, but that doesn’t stop Dean from crushing Cas in a hug so tight that it nearly knocks the breath out of both of them, and maybe Dean is crying a bit, but he thinks he’s earned it. Cas, on the other hand, seems damn near hysterics. He had looked shocked and a little confused when Dean had turned to see him, but now he’s downright terrified.
However, also due to his past experiences in Purgatory, Dean knows the place like the back of his hand, and that means he knows exactly how to find the door back to earth. Or, well, he should.
You’re my brother, you haven’t done any of the things Amara did. You don’t deserve this, and I’m not doing it.” Sam straightens his stance, and squares his shoulders. His body crackles with power——angry, but not dangerous——and light sparks behind his eyes.
Cas lets himself be led to Dean’s bedroom, but hesitates once he’s inside the room itself. The only light is a faint glow from down the hall, and that’s not nearly enough to see what Cas needs to. His night vision is newly lacking, and now is not the time for that, because the second that Dean’s hand slips out of Cas’——the second Dean all but disappears into the shadows of his room——Cas’ heart drops. All of a sudden it’s too dark, too suffocating, and entirely too much for Cas to handle at the moment. He feels his breath quicken, and his pulse nearly double. His legs threaten to buckle in on themselves, and he stumbles back into the wall.
“Your voice,” Cas says worriedly. “It’s——“
“The what?”
He hadn’t wanted to. He had needed to, but he shouldn’t have, because sleeping means dreaming, and dreaming means that Dean can’t escape what he want himself to see.
Dean mimes dusting his hands off in grim satisfaction as he presents the long sought-after portal to Sam.
“Ready?” Sam asks, looking down at the protective sigils that cover his arms.
Chuck doesn’t think he’s ever seen Dean look so scared. In the few seconds that he’s back in control, all he seems to be able to do is attempt to focus on Sam’s teary face, and try to breathe as confused thoughts rattle around inside his fractured mind.
deity——
Maybe he can get rid of it this way.
So, in a stroke of genius, Chuck decides to put a stop to it. All he needs to do is flip a few switches, and Dean will go back to how he should be. No more Cas, no more grief, and no more unchoreographed emotions. That decided, Chuck quickly knocks Dean out, and traps him in nightmares long enough to get his work done.
Dean shucks off his jacket and spares one last, lingering look at the bloody handprint soaked into the fabric before throwing it atop the worst of the fire. The dark, murky swirl on the wall spreads, then shifts into an amorphous, rolling plane, and the fire calms.
The more that Dean looks at the list, the more hopeless things begin to appear. What they have on Chuck isn’t a list of
From where it is sewed into his jacket, Dean’s other, other, other phone starts to buzz.
He’s killed his son.
Every inch of his body is on fire, but at least he doesn’t feel like he’s going to drop dead at any moment. Small mercies.
He adjusts his grip on the steering wheel and presses down harder on the gas pedal. His shoulders are so tense they hurt. It’s a deep, aching throb that cramps his muscles, but he ignores it as well as he can. At least the gradually increasing muscle pain distracts him from his worst thoughts.
He was lucky enough to get it for a while, too. The wife, kid, dog, picket fence... All of it.
“Cas——“
More often than not, she convinces Dean to stick around for a day or so, but Dean always leaves sooner rather than later. He doesn’t want the corruption of others on his hands; he doesn’t want to hurt anyone. And more than anything, he’s trying to keep everyone else from finding out how badly he’s hurting.
Sam is currently squinting at Dean’s cobbled together, chicken scratch spell in the dim light in an attempt to understand exactly what Dean has written. It’s all Enochian phonics, and Dean hasn’t included an English translation——some of the words don’t have an English equivalent anyway——but somehow, Sam trusts Dean.
“No.”
Thanks for reading, comments and kudos are always greatly appreciated and will be kept in a little zip-lock baggie for me to snack on when I need some serotonin!
Another growl shifts the ground, and knocks Dean off his feet. He goes to catch himself, grabs for the area that should be the edge of the door, and keeps falling.
if I didn’t care? Do you think I would have spent
Dean’s not exactly sure what Sam’s trying to do, but it doesn’t work, because all Sam does is swear loudly. Dean clutches his aching head, and curses whoever made coming back to life so difficult.
Sam is coping with everything surprisingly well, all things considered. He’s as mentally intact as one in his situation can be, but under his relative mental stability, there’s a strong undercurrent of sadness, and a painful amount of loss.
of being able to help that’s appealing.
“Heaven.” Sam says flatly. He tips his head back against the headrest and sighs heavily.
Dean doesn’t want Cas to end up like that.
He carries on.
Alive and breathing, in... somewhere. Dean hopes they’re still in America, at least.
Dean reaches inside of his jacket and grips his angel blade with a blood-slick hand. He should fling it into Chuck’s throat, and call it a day. Theoretically, that could do it, but the idea of spearing Jack through the neck without even giving him a chance to escape from Chuck’s control seems inhumane. Instead, the angel blade hits home in Chuck’s shoulder. If they’re lucky, that will throw Chuck off long enough for Jack to at least make an attempt at taking back his body.
“Ssssssam?” He slurs, still attempting to bring his body completely online. “Sam, whasss——“ he rolls to his side and vomits blood all over the floor of the car. “Wh-what happened?” His arm twitches up to his throbbing chest, and he moans in pain.
“I’m working on it,” he repeats.
See y'all soon? I hope? Fuck if I know.
So yeah, Cas probably isn’t going to be getting up for a while, and when he does, Dean wouldn’t be surprised if he just stayed in bed.
They never do more than sleep in the bed. Cas keeps expecting——and somewhat dreading——anything more, but Dean doesn’t seem to be in any hurry to do more than what they’ve been doing. He doesn’t want more, and he won’t take it. Not like some of the other Deans have done.
That wakes Sam up, and Sam (being the horrifically traumatized person that he is) almost punches a hole in the wall in an effort to——to——
Dean keeps his foot on the break, and his hands off the wheel, but that doesn’t stop the car from rolling forward just as if Dean was driving it.
Cas wishes all of this was real so badly that it hurts, but he knows Dean could never love him. Not like this.
He still doesn’t talk in his dreams.
“He wrote his own ending,” Cas answers flatly. “We didn’t like it.”
Cas wakes up to muffled words. He can’t make them out exactly, but the voice sounds like Dean’s, and helps ground Cas, if only a little.
If something
Something could go wrong. Something could always go wrong and then Dean will never be able to——
He’s so, so cold, and so, so tired.
Cas nods, and both him and Dean almost seamlessly switch into action, and Cas sticks next to Dean as he scopes out the way back to the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean doesn’t know what he is. He still doesn’t know what was manufactured by Chuck, and what he did on how own.
“No. It’s...”
Dean falls asleep in Cas’ room one week after they bring Cas home, and——as luck would have it——that’s the day Cas finally wakes up.
It’s nice, and——for a moment——Cas can almost believe it’s real.
She looks up from her book——some shitty romance paperback that probably belongs so Cas——and waves a bit. She looks awkward, like she’s not quite at home yet, and that makes Dean kind of sad, but it’s a lot to get used to.
Dean’s (the empty’s approximation of Dean, anyway) arms tighten around Cas, and Cas can’t stop himself from hugging back.
They spend the better part of three hours warding the walls of the bunker from anything and everything. Sigils and symbols from every religion are scattered across the outside door, and the molding of every entryway.
(Of course, save for the panic attacks that he couldn’t talk about to a wife he can’t remember. And the persistent voice in the back of his head telling him to drive off a cliff. And——)
So he keeps driving.
body, which makes everything about ten times harder.
Cas looks up and over to Dean, away from the half-empty glass of whiskey at the table, and it’s accompanying (also mostly empty) bottle. Cas’ eyes are shiny, and uncharacteristically dark with drunkenness’ telltale sheen. It’s a kind of shine that Dean knows all too well. The kind he was determined to replicate in his own eyes tonight.
Dean hums in agreement, pulls Cas close, and walks them into the flickering, slowly shrinking, tear in the world.
pretty much juiced him. He looks back to the road, and settles into the driver’s seat the way he should: confident and relaxed. Sam gives him a worried look.
over trauma that Chuck had put up more than enough walls in Dean’s mind to block out.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s not here. I looked.”
It takes five minutes for the realization of what had happened to sink in.
“Tired?” Dean asks, blinking back the last of the wetness in his eyes.
It’s quiet.
Dean can’t answer. His throat is clogged with emotion, and he wants to talk——wants to explain everything to Mary——but the words won’t come.
Dean's eyes burn with exhaustion, and he grabs for the stacks of notes he had liberated from one of the back rooms. It’s papers upon papers in his own spiky print-cursive amalgamation, Cas’ careful (almost font-like) English, mixed with occasional Enochian, and Sam’s almost illegible lawyer’s scrawl. It’s everything they’ve found, everything they’ve thought of trying, boiled down to the basics.
He had lied to Dean about Cas being in Heaven.
