I lied.  It took 2 weeks.  But hey, some kind of plot is beginning to appear!! So this isn't 100% a self indulgent character study of Tony and his relationships with other people.  (That's another lie.  We all know it's an incoherent study of Tony Stark mascaraing as something with plot and purpose.)
Instead, he had turned to AI and JARVIS.
Tony lets out a hissed breath, something twisting in his face, and Steve has to look away, looks down so he can’t see the regret on Tony’s face. He’s relearned the emotions that Tony lets bloom on his face during their combined time in the lab.
The doctor’s brow wrinkles for a moment before he goes, “Oh they hadn’t gotten to implants yet in the early 2000’s.”  He taps the corner of his right eye. “Camera’s in my eye. Holographic display too.”
Steve pulls back after they hit the wall and checks to make sure that this is okay, that this is what Tony wants. Tony chuckles before bending down and kissing him breathless again.
"It..." He fought the need to immediately deny, looking out over the land that they owned. Miss Margaret had found them a great spot, nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. What he called the Rocky Mountains anyway. He refused to remember what it was called in Steve's universe because he liked the way Miss Margaret's lips pursed in annoyance and Winter's eyes crinkled with laughter whenever he used 'Rocky Mountains' instead.
Rhodey moved in with them when he was finally ready to retire. Pepper chose not to, though she visited with Ben until her husband was bed-ridden. Burying her next to him and having to walk away was one of the hardest things he'd ever had to do. Steve, U and Harley found a clearing near the house and turned it into a memorial space for those friends whose final resting places were a universe away. Eventually most of the Avengers he'd known had their names carved into the marble statue, and soon after that he and Steve stopped visiting.
"Thank fuck. You've been so deprived. I'm glad I could help you live your best life."
Captain America
And if, in the process, Tony got one step closer to retiring and coming to live in his world? That was just a bonus he would be quietly thankful for.
He did tell me a little bit about his team, though I noticed that he was careful only to talk about heroes who have an equivalent in our world. Steve is a man who takes his responsibilities seriously and he was adorably earnest in his quest to keep from 'breaking the universe'. They aren't called 'The Avengers' there; his team took the name 'The Defenders', though he says this decision wasn't his. There is an Iron Man on that team, along with a Black Widow, Hulk, and Thor. "There are others, but I don't want to accidentally out anybody, you understand."
"Would it help if I reminded you that you're the only one that gets to touch it?"
Loki - 'his' Loki, even if he grimaced to admit it - would be watching that test as well. Thor's brother would only interfere if absolutely necessary, since the Rogue's didn't know he was (kind of) a good guy now. Thor himself had been impossible to drag away from New Asgard, but had insisted that Tony bring Steve and the kids by soon to talk over the 'big meeting' and any impact it could have on New Asgard's treaties. He was a surprisingly good king... and Loki was a surprisingly good ally.
“It’s a wonder the both of you don’t look like beach balls with the way you eat.” Tony scoffed as he pulled out his phone and ordering them the cheesy goodness they both needed after that ordeal.
“Yeah, it was dead out there so I just...” Peter smiled sheepishly, rubbing the back on his neck as the genius held his gaze and chuckled.
“You’re early kid.” Tony greeted as Peter walked into the lab. He looked up only after he finished typing a line of code. He smiled widely at the boy just as he usually did.
If there was one thing Peter knew, it was that high school fucking sucked. He might be Spider-Man when classes ended and when there was evil afoot but that didn’t change a thing for the boy trying to survive the rest of his life. He groaned as Flash threw him against the lockers in the changing room after he’d once again beaten the boys' scores in their latest physics test. Needless to say, the bully hadn’t been happy about being shown up again, so he had waited for Peter after gym class and once they were alone he wasted no time in once again taking his anger out on the other boy.
"His creations. Your children, I suppose you call them. It's remarkable, really.
The plans to abduct Stark were extremely worrying and may require a harsher punishment than Captain Danvers is permitted to hand down. All information, including a recording of the incident, has been forwarded to the Accords Committee. It is expected that they will convene a hearing and Rogers will face additional reprimands. Stark has been given cursory details of the situation so that he is armed with the knowledge to keep himself safe.
“Steve… you’re
"Of course ya wanna put a workshop in. Anythin' else ya want?"
made that even harder, hence the lateness. ^.^;;
"What? What the fuck are you talking about?"
The little girl blinking huge brown eyes at him looked like she might cry at any moment. Cupped carefully in her hands was a squirrel who was vocalizing pretty much non-stop. Curiously, the thing seemed to swing between scolding them and trying to comfort the girl. The girl, who looked like she understood
"Sir."
"Team building exercises are actually good for something. Who knew?" Tony kept his voice light, refusing to think of the one Avenger who was still stiff and awkward around him. "We should implement some of SHIELD's techniques at SI. Maybe a retreat where our workers can all shoot paintballs at each other and play capture the flag."
. It's a process."
Steve's lips were warm and dry against his own and quickly opened to swallow the rest of his nervous babble. Strong, slender fingers gripped his jaw to hold him in place, while the man's other hand twisted in his shirt. In a few short steps - stumbling on his part, purposeful on Steve's - he felt the edge of one of the workbenches digging into his upper thighs. The other man's mouth never left his for more than a heartbeat the whole time, not even when one of the blond's arms swept out to clear the surface behind him.
"That's enough, I'm thinkin'." Steve interrupted again, giving his elbow another squeeze before his fingers slid down to tangle with his own. No matter how pissed he was at the invasion of his tower and the assholes doing the invading, he couldn't help but look down at his
They had clearly decided that he didn't need to be even a tangential part of their conversation anymore. No, they were ignoring him and continuing with their own talk. It was probably for the best since it would maybe help him get himself under control.
Tony had never really enjoyed the glitzy parties he had been attending since he was a kid. There had been the years of boredom and wishing he could kick certain adults in the shin followed by two years of faux rebellion - sulking in one corner while being vaguely rude to anyone who talked to him had nothing on what came next. The drinking, sex and drugs that had hallmarked his true rebellious streak had made the parties only a little more bearable.
That was a talk he had to give himself several times as he headed down for the workshop. He was just glad Clint had swung by to grab Rosie and left already by the time he came out of his bedroom. When he had looked in the mirror he was worried and hopeful and confused as fuck to his own eyes; Clint absolutely would have noticed all those things. He would have noticed and either started teasing or gotten all sweetly, annoyingly concerned and butted in. It was better that he didn't run into anyone on the way down to the workshop.
"I get my own workshop?"
Dimly he heard Rhodey order Harley off the field to replace his suit; further away still was the panicked revelation that Gamora and Drax were both out of commission and being taken to the infirmary. They were losing bodies too quickly, with too little to show for it. If they couldn't change the lay of the land
"You said ten year plan earlier. So I had five years to fall for your sneaky charms... what happens in the next five years?"
"Yeah. Maybe it does." There was a stretch of silence where he tried not to feel guilty for not ruining his brother's optimism. He liked that Peter looked on the bright side and he didn't want that to ever stop. Harley didn't want to be the one to take that away. "Now go to sleep, alright? You did good today and you deserve some rest."
"Not really. But if I'm translating right... that means we're going. Grab your coat or he's gonna start poutin'."
Regarding the two alien members of the team, apparently of a race called 'Skrulls': Captain Danvers has vouched for them, and the Accords Committee claims to have vetted them extensively. It remains to be seen if the general public reaction to this decision will be positive or negative. Certain news outlets have claimed that this is just another, more extreme example of aliens stealing American jobs. So far there has been no reaction from the New Avengers regarding these allegations.
He couldn't help but stand when he heard someone approaching. He'd never taken a dame to a dance, not for real, but he guessed this was probably close to what Peter'd felt when he'd picked up that Liz girl for Homecoming. Should he have brought flowers? No, that would be weird. Very weird and also likely to give Winter the wrong idea. Flowers were definitely not called for except that they would give him something to fuss with other than his sleeves.
"Pretty much the best. Anyway I... after you all imprisoned me in medical for no reason--" Steve growled before he could stop himself and wasn't quite as amused when he felt another laugh against his neck. "Sorry. It was then that I realized I'd been being kind of oblivious. I can't believe it took me so long--"
Now he was sort of tempted to chug the scotch and do a line of cocaine in front of Rogers just to show the man how much he didn't care what Captain America thought of him.
"Of course we are. And Tony? I don't want any red in my suit."
“Okay. Here’s how this is gonna go.”
"Nah." It cost him to sound so nonchalant, but he saw some of the tension drain from Winter's shoulders. "That was... it was a lifetime ago. For me too. Neither of us is who we were then. Sure would like the chance ta get ta know ya again though. Pegs seems ta think you're pretty swell, after all, and she's a dame after my own heart."
Whoever he was.
"I'm gonna kick her--"
"You should marry me," popped out of his mouth unbidden, which what the fuck? It was not even remotely the time for that shit, not when this could still easily turn into a real fight. Not when that bastard Rogers was still breathing in his general vicinity with the other traitors who had broken the Avengers along with his goddamn heart. Not when four members of the Defenders were still waiting upstairs to take his Tiny Adorable Steve away.
Tony's hands lightly touched Steve's shoulders, then his chest and stomach, and they would have gone lower if Steve didn't stop him.
«I take delight in it, yes.»
«Tony…»
Head.
Their eyes locked one more time. Steve's icy irises always generated a sort of concern in Tony's heart. Those eyes shouted all the affection the captain felt towards him and this was a huge responsibility. Tony tried to destroy him in every possible way, yet he was there, in front of him, trusting him like no one else did.
When Tony eventually let go, they found themselves facing each other again, foreheads pressed.
«You're undecipherable, Stark. You switched from at least ten moods by now.»
«Of course, everyone would be incredibly excited to do this stuff at three a.m.»
«I doubt you'll do something I don't want you to».
«Enterprising, Rogers.» Tony's voice was hoarse and needy as their erections impatiently pressed and rubbed against each other.
«Well, that's way more on your stile than candles, Stark.»
«Not necessary, you don't have to if you don't…»
He knew he could do that. He was not afraid anymore.
Stark did his best to let go of the bewildered expression painted on his face and smiled softly, trying to make the other as much confortable as possible. He took the body wash back and gently massaged Steve's shoulders. For its part, the Captain let a sigh escape his mouth and looked up at him again.
And he couldn't screw this up and make him suffer again, not this time. He had to wipe away all the pain he caused him and, as Steve himself said, put down the mask and let his true feelings come to surface.
«Maybe YOU had to do more» observed Stark, opening the monitors again and looking at them with distracted eyes. «In case you forgot it, I dragged a nuclear missile to an intergalattic portal and-»
«I've been waiting for so long I don't want to waste time anymore» Steve's lips lapped Tony's clavicle, savoring every inch of his skin, but it was not easy to go deeper in that limited space.
«I KNOW!» Steve tipped one of the monitors over and Tony finally turned his fully attention to him. «I don't know if that already existed in your day, but I would suggest you try a beverage called “chamomile”. No steroids, no free radicals, the colour's a bit awkward but the taste is very pleasant-»
«No, I couldn't have. It was all figured out and calculated. I'm not the guy to make the sacrifice play, you know that. You actually were the one who told me that, to be honest.»
«Which part of “I'll leave the moralism for you” didn't you understand? My conscience is clear and I have nothing and no one on it.»
«It's the…I mean, I have never…»
He could recognize Tony's silhouette through the opaque glass of the shower, as the inebriating smell of the body wash reawoke his senses and libido even more.
Damn it.
When he was fully inside, Tony stood still to allow the other to get used to that intrusion.
«I just wanted to be here and meditate.»
His gaze had never been so intense.
«And since when do I listen to you?» Steve pointed, gently opening the shower door and slipping into it.
Those words were enough for Tony to lose it all and pressing his bodies together, wrapping his arms against Steve's waist and pulling him as close as possible. The Captain lightly touched his neck with his lips as his hands slided through his spine, making Tony shiver and arching his back in response.
Tony drag Steve along on the bed and the other leaned across him, letting his tongue explore his chest and his stomach, until he reached his inguinal region and stopped, hesitantly looking up, waiting for Stark's approval.
The other one seemed quite surprised by his initiative and quickly got lost in that gentle and sensual touch, allowing their lips to meet again and then open slightly, letting their tongues intertwine.
«What the hell are you doing here?»
That sight was perfect and Tony couldn't resist anymore. He delicately took his fingers off and carefully opened the lube bottle, spreading a generous amount on his penis before positioning himself over Steve, who wrapped his legs aroung his waist, giving him a better angle.
Stark knew he was going to say those two words he so often spoke in his head, but… was he really ready to hear them?
Tony couldn't keep pretending anymore, nor he could escape. Steve would have followed him to the end of the world to take him back and if he refused, he would have just accepted that and stayed there with him and he couldn't let this happen.
«How can you confess something like that?» cursed in a loud voice, imagining ridiculous situations involving him, Tony and bunches of red roses.
Iron man lost all sense of control and arched his hip, pushing himself deeper into Steve's throath, reversing the positions a few minutes later. Steve abandoned himself to that pleasant sensation he never felt before, his eyes following each movement of Tony's mouth, as if he wanted to be sure it was all real.
«For once, I agree with you. Make yourself confortable, I'll be back soon.»
«I want to improve my armor and I have some good ideas, so why shouldn't I begin now?»
And Steve didn't want to have other choices. The world could make do for that night.
There was no need to fight something or each other. Eventually, they simply were two normal men who made war for so long they just wanted to give the other all the love they were capable of.
"Yes Boss?"
more disturbing in Tony's opinion. It was a threesome full of danger, snark and a fierce kind of love. Lokes stole apples for the mortals almost immediately, delighted with the way it lit up his counterpart's eyes. Shellhead was less impressed, at least until Peggy had a baby with bright, mischievous green eyes and named her Antonia. After that he made more of an effort to get along with Winter, though they would never be friends.
Tony had dreamed of his Tiny Adorable Steve coming back to him so many times that when he began to wake up he was sure this time wasn't any different. Sure it had felt real, but it always did. He always had trouble in the moments between being fully asleep and fully awake, because it always felt like his
“Nope.”
God, it was like watching Rose and Matthew find each other all over again. He wasn't sure if he hoped Peggy was smitten too or if he hoped Winter had just imprinted on her temporarily, like a murderous duckling.
But we can't do it without the two of you. I brought you to Soul, Tony, and with Time I brought you and Steve together. I've touched both of you, even if I didn't claim you. Soul doesn't really need my help to use you, though.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Jan is small, but her heels are sharp and she has good aim." When Winter shrugged, his broad shoulders and built arms gave the impression of a small mountain shifting. "And Agent Carter is... she says she is not my handler, but..." A tiny frown as the man searched for words, and then an even smaller smile graced his lips. "She is fierce and she does not mind telling me what to do or when I am being... sometimes the soldier comes forward too much. She is good at helping him stand down."
"Let 'em land, Fri."
"Shaddup and get ready to lose."
I was so startled that I dropped my open water bottle, and I'm sure my mouth was hanging open and making me look like a complete moron. Tony began cackling - there's no other word for it - while Steve stared back at me with wide blue eyes. A moment later he sprang into action with Tony still laughing and me still gaping. He ran to the kitchen and came back with a washcloth, and I'm ashamed to say the water bottle was still on the floor, liquid still pouring out of it. Steve was the one who finally righted it and even put the cap back on before mopping up my mess. I was so embarrassed I wanted to floor to open up and swallow me, but thankfully the two men were so busy teasing each other that they didn't seem to notice.
"I know I fucked up your timetable already."
Sometimes he didn’t know what to do with how much Steve cared.
"Jesus fuck. Whoever came up with the idea of focus groups should be shot."
Which I have totally thought of and am not at all stalling on that. :'D
Someday he would return of his own volition, bringing his children and his lover with him, and Soul's realm would be filled with the laughter and love their souls would bring. Waiting was no hardship, not for an Infinity Stone.
Thanks so much for reading, comments are much loved.
won't let that happen because you know you deserve better."
He got the uncomfortable feeling that Bruce was talking about a lot more than just the whole tea drinking thing. Usually he would be hot-footing it out of the room, because emotions gave him hives. But his science bro was smiling a soft, gentle smile that showed just a hint of dimple and crinkled around his eyes. It was probably the happiest, the brightest, he had ever seen the guy look - positive reinforcement had to be given. High-tailing it wouldn't give Bruce any incentive to keep smiling like that. Sacrifices to his own comfort had to be made.
"Shut up. How far up do you figure you wanna move things?"
"But it was the right thing to do." He pulled Steve closer, squeezing the man's trembling fingers with his own. "We would have come through ourselves to explain things if we hadn't been running short on time."
“So do you know what you’re gonna order yet?” Steve’s voice was close enough to his ear to make him shiver.
"Handlers take out anything interesting. Oh, no asking about Budapest."
"Boss? They're coming down the elevator now."
"It better fucking not be," the other Tony said, breaking away from where he and Loki had been saying goodbye to the metal boys. "We've got communication devices, you asshole. I want to hear from you hourly."
"You don't." That was... that was an unfair point to make. He wanted to say that Harley didn't understand what he was asking, but that wasn't entirely true. The kid had seen a lot more than the glamorous, glitzy lie of superhero life. He'd been there for some of the ugly parts, had been there during some of Tony's own worst times. Maybe he didn't have a full and complete understanding of what his request entailed... but it would be wrong to treat this like a silly whim.
"Twinkle, you still on the field?"
"Yup. Bought a building, hired some staff, the works. Those rats lived like goddamn kings for the rest of their lives. Shelter's still up and running, actually. They take in all the odd and weird kinds of pets that people get rid of or mistreat. Great place that he never tells anyone about. Won't let them list him as the founder, won't attach his name to it at all - he was always afraid the people who hate him would do something to the animals to get back at him. They send him pictures, I think, and he funds all their day to day operations as anonymous donor, but otherwise he keeps his distance."
It was a nice feeling, even if Tony had no idea what it had meant to him.
It felt like family, the same way Rhodey, Pep and his boys made him feel. Best of all he was snuggled up to Steve while it was happening. The first time he yawned, the blond softie took his plate and set it aside before grabbing the afghan off the back of the couch and to wrap  around them both. He was warm and comfortable with his head tucked under Steve’s chin and his friend’s voices soothing him to sleep in the background.
Tony hadn't exactly cleared out a space for him in the workshop, not like the one Bruce had been given, but he still had an area that everyone considered his. It was pretty much the only clear patch of table space in the whole room. Sometimes he had to shove spare parts or schematics out of the way a little, and every once in a while there'd be a few mugs half-filled with sludge that had once been coffee. Whenever Tony noticed that he would hurry to clear it though, which was awful sweet of him.
"Nah. I ain't that smart - just stumbled across it on the Google--"
"Yeah. Hit the road soon as Fri let them know the fight was over. Kamala's with them," he wasn't surprised by that at all. Kamala was six months away from being allowed to be a full-time Avenger instead of a junior member. She'd been devastated not to be allowed in the fight. "Leavin' now would be dumb. You should take pops home though."
"Pfft. Never, ever believe that he's dead. Not without definitive proof, and even then you should be on the lookout."
"No, it's because you showed me the next evolution of the design just after you brought your family to invade my tower. Just because someone is hurt doesn't mean they can't pay attention - remember that, Harls, might save your life someday - and so this is a ploy. A complete and total attempt to get my attention all to yourself and let me tell you something. I wholeheartedly approve of the result, but you don't need to pretend you need help for that to happen, got it? You never need a flimsy excuse to get me to come hang out with you, okay? People with weird connections don't need excuses. All you need to say is 'Tony, I want to spend some time with you'."
"If you keep staring," she said quietly, sensing he wasn't really in the mood for a Russian lesson. "He's going to catch on fire. That or you'll manage to actually kill my archer with a look and then I'll have to kill you."
. Steve didn't need that to change.
"I do apologize for that Captain. I had no intention--"
, and he hoped like hell another one of his kids wasn't about to form a crush on one of his friends. Especially since Loki lived so far away.
"It's the martyr in me."
"I would like to meet them," he finally said, thankful for the silence his Tiny Adorable Steve had given him to process. "It'd be... maybe it would be... nice. To have a re-do with some of them I mean. Won't be happening for a while though."
"I wish you were real," he whispered into his pillow… or what he was pretty sure was his pillow. It was warmer than usual, maybe a little firmer, but there was no way… there was just no way. He was a fuck-up, with a laundry list of evidence to prove it - no one would ever come back for him. That Rhodey and Pepper were still around was a miracle, Vision was too young to know to avoid him like the plague, and he paid Happy to care about him. Everyone else left and they were right to do it. Tiny Adorable Steve had gone off to do great things. There was no way he was going to come back for one Tony fucking Stark. "I wish you were really here."
leave ya, Tony," he whispered while lifting a hand to stroke the man's cheek. "Never. Not willingly. If someone or somethin' tries ta take me then I'll fight like hell ta get back home. Ta get back ta
“You don’t need to thank me Tony. They shouldn’t have…” Steve’s lips went thin with disapproval, prompting another smile from him. “I didn’t like the way they were touching you,” he finally said. There was a touch of something dark in his voice that sent a tingle of delight up Tony’s spine.
At least they were in a remote part of the compound, where the only people in the rooms surrounding them were their human sons, Rhodey, Pepper and - now - the Defenders. The former Rogues were several buildings away, as were newer teammates they weren't completely sure about.
“I can't… I don't wanna joke about this Tony. When I saw…” He stopped and took a deep breath before pressing his lips together again. “I thought you were dead. You weren't answerin’ and JARVIS-- I haven't ever heard him sound like that. I never wanna hear it again either. So just… maybe just can it with the smartass remarks about dying. ‘Least until I can get the picture of you crumpled beneath a goddamn streetcar with a telephone pole crushing your torso outta my head.”
"Tony, you don't mean--"
"...what?"
"Mebbe. But once it was over ya woulda got right back up and cut 'em all ta pieces with that tongue of yours. I just got there first is all. Ya ain't no damsel in distress. Didn't need me ta rescue ya, and maybe I oughta be ashamed for steppin' in the way I did." Because Tony
They were going to be okay. And if she really wanted to be a card-carrying Avenger... well. He thought the team was going to end up being okay too.
Sam was the only one who didn't look ready to attack, but he was still geared up just in case, and fuck. It just made his stomach want to rebel because he'd redesigned those wings too. He had streamlined them, given Sam the means to really compete on the super-stage despite not having any powers or Black Widow training. Maybe the guy didn't have his finger on the trigger the same way Rogers and Nat did, but Tony couldn’t take much comfort in that. Not when he knew that Sam wouldn't hesitate to jump into things if Rogers' finger even twitched the right way.
Her hair still smelled like that cheap apple blossom shampoo she'd always loved. It was so familiar and comforting that it made his chest ache for a moment, remembering all the times he'd kept her safe from nightmares when they were little kids. Harley wondered if she knew that protecting her sleep had kept his own bad dreams at bay, wondered if he should tell her.
but I don’t complain about it."
~.~.~
"Nope. Most of it was just surface stuff, and her leg was sprained instead of broken. She's doing just fine." Sensing they were talking about her, she gave a soft 'wuff' and hit her tail against the floor a few times. "Vet says as long as we take it easy with the exercise but make sure she gets some it shouldn't be too long before that's one hundred percent again."
He still wanted to know just how many more kids his fella had tucked away in the shadows.
and he knew he was going to fuck it up... but he had two amazing kids who wanted him to try anyway. Three if you counted the tiny terror that was Laney, who would probably be demanding a suit of her own any day now. Seemed to be the trend.
But they aren’t friends enough for those sorts of talks.  Those are the discussions for Rhodey or Pepper, who lean close, so close and look at him like he’s something already far outside their grasp.
It’s still not enough.
The chill in the face of the king had burned.  “We want nothing from the Avengers, let alone the Starks.  Keep your blood money Iron Man.”)
"Sir, I don't think it would be great to begin your first training exercise with specifically targeted attacks on the Avengers that could potentially isolate everyone."
.  Knowing this is his fault, everyone of these deaths are on him.
I wish I still could be
He fights back a chill.  The churning of His stomach.  The chill creeping in with the reactor gone.  The slow horror of wondering,
Tony, just take the thanks.
"What about the - " Tony starts.
Tony's grateful for it, but would also like a distraction.
(It still aches though).
He turns back and Vision’s eyes are clear, a small smile on his face.  “Wanda thanks you for her worry,” he replies. “But yes. My systems are running perfectly fine,”
There feels like a million shattered pieces inside of him, illusions, ideas, and so much anger that broke and what's left is stuffed inside of him. Moving with him and pressing against vital organs and just aches.
That he can keep this candle flickering a little longer, his faith the only thing feeding it.
Maria had stared at Howard for a long time before she nodded and reached out.  He had taken her hand and they had gone back into a room, and Tony had creeped back into his bed.)
Maria grins.  “Oh you never know.”  Her smile softens. “Close your eyes Tony.  I’ll hold you until you go.”
Until one day he won't.  And they both know it )
Tony rubs a hand behind his head, caught off guard a little bit. He had wanted to be here to see the kid in person, but had expected suspicion instead...this.  "It's Tony," he offers.  "Heard we were training the next generation."
"I'm sorry," Vision utters quietly.
Tony tugs off the glove on his right hand before leaning over and wrapping his fingers around Steve’s wrist.  It’s warm.
Tony’s throat doesn’t catch, but he has to swallow down a few memories, some other choice words, along with one question.  Instead he just says, as fiercely as he can, “Assemble.”
Tony thinks of,
Tony has to force himself to let go of the ARC reactor, the shape of the metal is indented onto his hand and stinging slightly as he relaxes the joints.
He blinks mid sentence and opens his eyes to the old manor.
“It’s not that hard when I am the only program who chose a female designation.”
“Was he happier?” Tony asks, twisting the blanket between his hands before he sits up and hunches over.
Steve’s under the ice now, and maybe it’s poetic justice he goes under as well.
Tony stands there and thinks about silence, about friendship and thinks the noise the shield made against the suit.  He thinks about his mother’s fading smile.  His father’s stern face.  The thinks about Obie and Pepper.  Peter’s carefree grin.  Bruce at work.  The picture of the frozen face is lined with pain in the glass chamber projected in the lab.
(Thanks for reading and reviewing. I'm not going to lie, every review guilted me into writing some more and poking at this chapter.  Seriously.)
She takes a few steps forward, and there is no whine, no noise.  It simply moves along with her, like it’s her real leg just encase in one of his boots.  She does some quick running in place, and the back opens minutely to cool down the leg.
He screams at the pain, the unnatural angle.  FRIDAY tries to move the nanobots, but they are frozen.  Someone is yelling in the comms. Multiple people actually, but Tony is caught, head up towards the sky, looking to the cloud rolling in.
You really don’t have to
Tony watches, stolen heart in his throat, the whole way. It only settles when Rhodey sinks into the couch, proud grin across his face.
Tony grins and pulls closer and can see the second Steve decides to make a joke. "Just let me know when you decide to formally adopt Peter, so I can be prepared to fight Rhodey to the death to be the second name on that form."
Tony flicks open a new screen, rough prelim schematics he originally had for the next armor version after he had finished some test runs on the 46th.  “Only if the anomalies are outside the 28% range in a majority of cases.”

All the men look to the one facing Cap before rushing him.  Cap gets lost in the rush, and Tony can’t breathe.  Can’t find any air in his lungs until Cap is pushing back the first rush of people.  One man goes flying, taking three more down with him.  Cap goes low, taking another group of them out with a quick hit to the legs.  The first group goes to stand up, and Cap punches the first guy square in the face, takes his helmet as the guy slumps and tosses it at a second guy, hitting him square in the throat.  The guy gasps and goes down as well.
They find common ground, a friendship of sorts, and Tony can across a room and read T’Challa’s face without needing an debrief later.  T’Challa can do the same for him.
she is a patchwork girl, held together by the seams she has done herself, done by other people, by the pieces she has stolen from others
Tony can’t bring himself to care about the destruction around him, drum up the emotions, instead something in him itches, like when he’s in the suit and hits the villain of the week a little harder just because he wants a fight. Wants to get his fist in someone’s face and just wants to work off this energy.
but Obie keeps needing him strong,
Peter snickers, but his eyes are watery.
"And out," Steve adds.  "You can talk your way out too."
He and Bruce go up the stairs, leaning heavily on each other as they laugh over the video FRIDAY replays of Spidey saying hi to Rhodey.
Steve's eyes meet the ceiling in confusion before the beeping registers and then he sighs, a tired worn sigh of someone who knows a hospital too well.  Tony watches as he closes his eyes, like he expects to be alone in the too white room with the loud beeping.
Bruce clocks her immediately, but doesn’t move, just watches her from across the room with the same steadiness he watches Tony interact.  She does something that makes Bruce grin a little ruefully, but it’s the hesitant “Mr. Stark” that gets him to turn.
Tony watches as he pours himself two fingers before filling another glass and and pushing it across the table.  Tony weighs the action and reaction before picking up the glass and taking a sip. Howard smiles against his own glass.  “Anton Vanko,” Tony voices finally. “What do you think about him?”
Tony bites his lip and presses his face into the pillow and grips Steve’s shoulders, unable to do anything beyond keeping from moaning loud enough that the people three floors down could hear him.
“What are you drawing?” Tony asks.
“Death,” Thanos utters, words echoing through every bone in Tony’s body. “I call you to me.  I have the prize you asked for, and now I ask for your hand. May we rule side by side forever.”
“Yes,” he confirms.  “You find him. You save him in my future,” Tony grins a little.  “You always save the day Aunt Peg.”
From 54985-466-8653
Spreading his hands across the smooth glass of the table, T’Challa meets his eyes when he says, “I wanted to know what you were presenting to the UN about the accords in a few days.”
Peggy keeps the gun firm on him. “Howard Stark doesn’t have a child.”
no no no no don't do that for me. don't come back for me.
“Then finish it,” Death says simply before stepping back into the yawning chasm of space.
It feels like a sparking battery to his chest - the hope he has.
“No Tony,” Rhodey absently responds with.  He grabs onto Tony’s feet and starts rubbing down Tony’s arches.
Tony grips the podium tightly, fingers flexing against the wood, but the strain is hidden underneath his suit. "You know to never to listen to rumors," he retorts.
Tony leaves, grin too bright, looking like he does when Steve catches him in the news.  A reporter badgering him with questions about the Avengers and the clean ups after fights, SI's stock’s latest tumble, or about the latest lady in his life.  The one he uses when he’s about to lie or fake his way through something.
He turns to Daniel, distraught.  “What did I do?”
Consider us even, finally, Steve.
Tony suspects it wasn’t exact science.  It was someone playing God with two angry kids, and there is enough evidence to support the fact that they survived is a miracle that 83 others didn’t get.  It’s isn’t really science. It’s the same sort of science that brought Frankenstein’s monster to life. It’s chance. An actual miracle.
Rhodey snorts, “I don’t think you do genius.”
Tony's smile is a fleeting twist of the lips at the sight of Rhodey standing, Rhodey moving. "Only you would know Rhodey."
It's silent across the battlefield as Steve thrusts the blade into the ground and turns back to where his Tony is still down, but his mask is up. He's looking at him, eyes wide. But he nods.
Tony waves him off and treks out of the room, embarrassed.  “I can do it. I can do it,” he repeats as he heads to the shower.
Even for him, it sounds like science fiction, but what Tony is quickly realizing is that everything he imagined before is limited when it comes to the future.
without verbalizing it.  “Ugh,” Steve groans.  “Just go away.”
Steve turns to him, oddly distant in his gaze.  "I wish you the best," he says, off and wrong.
Three weeks later, Steve reaches an arm around Tony’s shoulder and reels him in during a rewatch of the fifth incarnation of Wrath of Kahn.  Kirk is young, darker skinned and has an accent that makes no sense.
His eyes met Primrose's and she made a soft 'whuff' before hiding her nose against his stomach and then promptly sneezing. Everyone was a damned critic, it seemed. He couldn't be mad at her though, just gave her one of the butt scratches that she lived for as he pondered J's suggestion.
"We don't deserve her. Hers?"
He wanted to be there for Tony in every way he could. Steve wanted to support his fella without following him blindly. The genius needed people who could argue with him, challenge him without being against him. Rhodey and Pepper weren't enough, not all the time - he wanted to be that same kind of influence. He had no desire to be the 'boy toy' that Harley still teasingly called him. Steve was hoping that this could be the start of that.
"Yeah?"
Dum-E and U were going to be a disaster as groomsmen, and he couldn't wait to see it.
"Did you..." Tony sounded disbelieving, blinking several times with wide eyes. He was probably 'blue-screening' as he put it at J's gumption. "Did you already tell everyone?"
Insubordination, Incitement to Insubordination, Conspiracy to Commit Kidnapping
son?”
rough on them.
"Won't be talkin' much at all, this goes right."
"Sweetheart?"
"Seriously? Harls, that's... why is there not anything for Yale or Harvard in here? Even with the two years off you had the grades, and
"Well, yeah maybe, but I got Tony'n Harley'n Peter here, not ta mention the bots and Fri and all my friends--"
"Don't you 'aww Tony' me, Captain America. J, we're gonna enter lockdown mode, buddy. Nobody in or out of this workshop until I say so."
"We can't just adopt every super-kid with sad eyes that the Defenders throw at us,
“I’m not sure I can go on at this rate. There’s a white light and soon I’ll be bored enough to head into it. I've survived an attempted crushing only to--”
"That's not necessary, Boss. We have countermeasures--"
"Too much." Steve agreed quietly, glad he didn't need to explain. Harley and a few others might complain about the human noise and light pollution, but for him it was just... just the whole place that was too damn loud. "We used to do this."
"Damn straight I did. Deserved more, the little punk. Thinkin' he could bust in here without even askin'. His ma's prob'ly rollin' in her grave ta see him bein' so damn rude." He ran his fingers over Tony's jaw, which had gone tight, then cupped his cheek. "Hate that he did it when he did especially. Worst timin' ever I think. Are ya... I know it had ta have been hard, seein' them. Seein' him."
"Sure you don't sweetheart."
~.~.~
that time, and he did it best in the workshop. A few hours of tinkering and building would do the man some good, and maybe he'd come to the realization that Steve really hadn't been trying to hurt him. Dinner would probably do a lot to cheer him up too, what with all the shenanigans their kids were always getting into. The two of them, Rhodey and Alicia were usually in stitches halfway through the meal and even Pepper had been known to giggle helplessly from time to time. After dinner he'd take Tony to bed and try to soothe over any remaining hurt feelings with words of love and devotion.
"Okay Tony."
"Just what?"
"Sorry."
"They're pajama pants."
“Tony, anything I could come up with ain’t half as bad as the things that drop out of your mouth on the regular.”
"Ya don't gotta do this, ya know.
"Hey Steve?"
, and Thor would have somewhere to stay when Jane kicked him out for disturbing her experiments. He could give them all that - he could give them a home.
"Wasn't sure you were ever going to join us," Tony said, turning so he was only talking to Steve. He knew it shouldn't be anything that made him perk up, but he still did. "Want a turn?"
Like the Howling Commandos here, his team The Imps was responsible for dealing with the Hydra threat. "We also looked for any concentration camps we could and liberated 'em." He went really quiet after that, his eyes haunted even after Tony pressed a kiss to his temple. "I saw things in there... I don't like to talk about it much, but I guess it's why I can't stand for that kind of hate. Even just a sliver of it is too much, and it ain't what I fought for. Maybe I did the fighting in a different America, but still."
Fuck, he couldn't wait until they could put the common floor to use again. Pepper would be able to have a space to spread out her work for SI and still be with them, and Alicia and Steve could have another table for their college coursework. The human kids probably wouldn't want to do
Mr. Stark has equipped the Avengers for years. It would be ludicrous of him not to offer his expertise in this matter. And despite what everyone seems to believe, Mr. Stark learns from his mistakes and works hard to keep from repeating them. He is also very clear-eyed when it comes to what is required to implement something like this. Having one person or one viewpoint be solely in charge of a project of this magnitude wouldn't work. Not only would it risk overlooking innovations that could be the key to saving lives, it wouldn't make people feel very safe during times of peace. As ideas are developed and tested, they will be presented to the UN before any implementation occurs on a large scale. They can be voted down just like any measure, Mr. Poppleton, and I resent the implication otherwise from you and a few other members of the Committee.
"I will if you ever start the damn game."
Spear chick was doing a decent job of fending Fri's attack off - from the bit of debris at her feet, she'd even managed to disable a few of the weapon orbs completely. He might have respected that if he didn't want her the hell off his lawn. "Give me a hole, Fri." Immediately the orbs shifted, clustering more densely in most places to give him a clean shot. The cluster cannon felt right, and he activated it quickly; as the cannons on his back unfolded, Captain Marvel closed in from the other side. FRIDAY was amazing so she adjusted her orbs without being asked, all of them still firing and making a nuisance of themselves. The chick with the spear was so distracted that she didn't notice Captain Marvel until one glowing fist had almost reached her - she never noticed Tony's attack at all.
He knew Captain America didn't like him very much, but he still felt for the guy. Captain America deserved better than squatting at SHIELD HQ.
So I finally got rid of all that crap and started fresh again and am mostly happy with it now. Yaaaay. Now I'm gonna go do the same with the next two chapters and get them up before Friday - scout's honor!!
"You're not."
"Hell yes." The shorter man caged him in, then climbed up over top of him. He was pressed down until his back was flat against the workbench and his hands tangled in those soft blond locks. Steve's hips rolled in a way that made his eyes roll back in his head. "Fuuuuck..."
I let you talk me into this blindfold."
The two Starks grinned at each other, and despite himself he started to smile too. During their little exchange both of them had relaxed, their body language now open and engaged. Tony's hands were flying a mile a minute while he talked, while Shellhead was slower but more expansive in his movements. It was sort of... surreal to see them both at the same time, sitting across from each other and wearing nearly the same smirk.
"Yeah well. There isn't anyone more qualified unless you're hiding someone in one of those big purses you like to tote around on the weekends that you think no one knows about, so--"
"Tony!" Why there was that harsh bark of authority in Rogers' voice he wasn't sure. The guy was still bleeding on his patched-up suit and had very obviously taken a beating at Steve's hands. There was also a pretty awful looking burn high on the man's right cheek that he really shouldn't be proud of but was. He wasn't coming out on top here, so Tony didn't know why he was trying to sound like he was in charge. "What the hell is going on?"
“We all know you like spicy food Thor. We also know that it gives Tony heartburn.”
He fell in love all over again, which just wasn't fair.
"Yeah yeah. You're a big ol' smarty pants, but you get that from your dad - me dad, not Tiny Adorable Dad - so I wouldn't be so smug about it. This is really killing my dramatic reveal, so fuck it. Just go ahead and take off your blindfolds."
“Sure as shit do. But I don’t wanna… can we not talk about that? Gets me all heated’n ready ta punch someone, which is not… Christ I just wanna cuddle ya until we fall asleep again. I missed ya so much.” Now Steve’s voice sounded choked and it was enough to bring a round of tears to his eyes. “Every damn day. It was like I had a big hole inside’n even the good days hurt because ya weren’t there for ‘em. I was better off than ya were because I had people there that I could really trust, but it never… it was never enough. Not really. So I just—“
He rolled his eyes and didn't dignify Tony's snark with a response. 'Just Dance' was a weird game and that was just that. Still, he didn't mind the warm laughter at his expense or the way they'd all rack up scores that left his in the dust. It was the way things went when they played this damn game and everyone knew it... just like they knew Steve could kick all of their asses when it came to most battle royale style games.
Rhodes had ended up staying in his room for the rest of the night - they'd finally fallen asleep on the couch and woke up cuddling. That had cemented their friendship, apparently, because now he was under strict orders to call the man 'Rhodey' and to get in touch if he needed anything. It was almost enough to leave him feeling starstruck. Rhodey was the center of almost half of Tony's stories and Tony admired him,
"I suppose I can do that. Is there a shooting range nearby where I can break the news?"
Iron Man, after all. He didn't know how to be Tony Stark without also being one of Earth's mightiest heroes, not anymore.
Good morning Ms. Potts. Thank you for making the time to meet with me today. I understand you have a busy--
He ended most drawing visits to Tony's workshop by setting up a mug full of his favorite pencils, but he never started out having it handy. Butterfingers like to take the mug and hide the pencils, and the silly 'bot would spend at least five minutes engaging Steve in a game of keep-away that almost always meant he wasn’t doing the real work Tony had given him. U would chase after the both of them, scolding in whistles, until Tony threatened to send them
"And you'd be a junior member--"
And Steve...God, Steve. The blond always seemed to be touching him now that they both knew it was allowed. Sometimes he wanted to just sink into his arms and bask in the warmth of the man forever. But was it really affection, or was Steve just as touch-starved as Tony sometimes got? He'd had almost a century of going without any contact at all - sure he'd been frozen, but it still counted. Probably. And he was weird about who was allowed to touch him in non-battle situations. Tony and the other Avengers were fine, but once he'd clocked a SHIELD agent for grabbing his arm without warning. So it was more than possible that he wasn't really... well. That he was just getting what he needed where he could. Maybe the fact that Steve was getting so much of that from Tony didn't mean anything at all.
“It doesn’t look ruined. Tell me that’s not the kid’s report card. He’s not failing anything is he?” Tony asked as he glared at the thing skeptically hoping that he hadn’t misjudged how the kid was doing in his classes.
May smiled softly as she handed him the envelope, she sat down on the couch, her hands folded, the thumbs twitching nervously as she watched him open it and pull out the papers inside.
“Tony Stark, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, housekeeper.”
Tony rolled his eyes at the texts, May never gave him an option to back out of anything anymore and he couldn’t help but like her more for it. They might not have been close after they first met, but over the past year they had started speaking more and more often and with all the dinners and movie night she had become a close friend and he loved her for it. Peter might have brought them together, but it was the grief of losing the men that they loved that forged their bond. They often talked about Ben and Steve, comforting and consoling each other through the hardest of days. He had told her about him by mistake one night as they were watching Casablanca at Stark Tower they were both more than a little drunk on wine and Peter had knocked out hours earlier. As he watched the movie he had remembered watching it for the first time with Steve years earlier, he had assumed he was thinking about the memory, remembering Steve’s soft smile as he had told him about watching it when it first came out back in the ’40s, he was more than shocked to realize he had said the words out loud on accident. He was thankful for his drunk brain for that mistake. Since then the two talked constantly, often about loss, sadness, and loneliness, occasionally about Tony seeing the captain again, but usually about supporting one another. They both needed a friend and thanks to Peter they had found that in each other.
“Oh come on!” The teen whined as he swayed from side to side from one foot to the other, his grip tight on the bottom of his shirt and he pouted as hard as he could.
“We could order him a salad and force him to eat it while we eat the pizza?” May offered with a grin, Tony’s eyes catching hers and smirking right back her.
wouldn’t be the day he lost everything but also the day that he got everything he could have ever wanted.
He stopped at a picture of his mother and father on their wedding day. His mother looked beautiful, his father looked happy and content. He had often wondered as a teen if the reason they were always so unhappy in front of him was that he was a failure. Maybe he really was the problem, the anomaly. He had mentioned it to Pepper once when he was spiraling through a depressive episode and rethinking every decision he had ever made. He often wondered if he was cursed or something, doomed to destroy everything he ever touched. Whether that be his family, all the friends he had lost through the years, Pepper, the Avengers, and worst of all his relationship with Steve.
“First you invite me here and then you tell me to leave. Way to send some mixed signals May.” He shot back as he did exactly what she asked him to. Whether he liked to admit it or not that woman had him wrapped around her little finger.
Tony and Mays eyes widened as they exchanged looks.
“Because… Because he’s-“
“I thought it was about time we make it official!” May added with a smile. “Well technically I wanted to adopt Tony but then he would be my kid-“
But that wasn’t what happened. That wasn’t why they had died. They had been assassinated.
“Yeah and this was Armani so thanks for that.” He stated as he looked pathetically down at what had been his favorite suit.
“You are about to say something stupid.” She said it with a smile so soft that it made Tony’s heartache as he spoke.
“But-“ Tony cut him off quickly before he actually gives the lecture he was already dreading.
“Hey, I detest that!”
“Because he’s already your kid Tony. He’s as much yours at this point as he is mine. Don’t get me wrong I didn’t think I would EVER be doing something like this, but at this point what’s the point of pretending that you aren’t his parent.” Mays' hand squeezed his as he forced himself out of his own mind. In his periphery, he could see a picture of the three of them from Peters birthday. They were all smiling, Peters cake was bigger than any of them had the ability to finish but fuck were they happy.
“But do you want to? Do you want to be his father Tony?” She asked softly, her gaze holding his like a vice grip that he could not turn away from. He couldn’t look away. “Tony?” She asked again, sliding closer to him as she pried the paper out of his hands and took his own in hers.
“Yeah. They are.” Tony replied. He and May locked eyes as soon as the words were said out loud. She smiled softly, nodding back at him the understanding between them as strong as it was silent.
“I would be a great housekeeper! Just imagine me in an old fashion maids uniform.”
“You would be the worst housekeeper in all of existence.” She scoffed.
“Don’t worry it won’t change much. You’ll still be my son Pete and I’ll still have custody of you. You’ll live with me the way you usually do, but Tony will have as much of a right to you and custody of you as I do.” May explained as she came closer to him, resting her hand on his shoulder.
“Yeah, that’s right. They’re bigger then you wanted them to be, but I think it’s better to work towards downscaling.” Toney explained as he got up and walked over to a different table where said nanobot prototypes were waiting.
was the day they had died, the day he had been orphaned, the day he lost the two people who meant the most to him. He might have hated his father, but he still loved them, they were his parents, for better or for worse. For years he had blamed himself, if only he wasn’t such a fuck up, maybe they wouldn’t have been desperate to get away from him. Maybe they would have stayed home that day, maybe they would have never gotten into that car, maybe just maybe they would have never gotten into that accident. He had assumed his father was drunk, and when it came to his father that wasn’t a hard assumption to make. He often wondered if his father drank to forget how much of a letdown Tony was. He’d ran through the argument that they had the day him and his mom left over and over again, wondered what would have happened if he was better, kinder, smarter, better put together. Maybe if they hadn’t fought then his dad wouldn’t have drank that night and then they would have been alive.
Tony collapsed on the couch with a groan, after finally finishing cleaning the entire damn kitchen with May. The devil herself collapsed next to him not a second later her own exhaustion catching up with her. This was supposed to be an easy dinner damn it and how the hell she had messed that up she didn’t even know.
“You’re word vomiting.” He stated, his body still shell shocked.
“How the hell did you even-” Tony made a mental note to find footage of the look currently on his face and frame it because damn was it hilarious.
“Good afternoon Spider-Man, welcome back to Stark Tower. The boss has been notified of your presence. He’s waiting for you downstairs.” F.R.I.D.A.Y greeted. He thanked her in response as he walked into the penthouse and towards the room Tony had given him. He Changed quickly before running to the elevator and making his way down to the workshop.
“Karen” Tony replied, somehow keeping his voice even and not laughing at the kid’s misery.
“Mmhmm and how was school today?” The skepticism in his voice was thick but even he knew when to drop a subject.
“No no those haven’t come out yet. Don’t worry I’m sure they’ll be fine since you have been helping him study.” May replied, comforting his anxieties about Peters school life.
“Just go shower while I clean this up. See, I told you that keeping a spare set of clothes here would be a good idea.”
He thinks about calling Tony about Bucky. Asking for help, but it feels wrong. Like this is a favor he doesn't have the right to ask.
He catches Tony watching him in the hours that drift between too late and too early, staring at him and the book resting in his lap where he is curled. Steve makes sure to acknowledge him before going back to trying to draw Bucky when they were young, dumb and stupid and causing trouble in Brooklyn.
“You don’t get it,” Tony counters, furious, because this is what could screw up everything.  “You will screw this up. You need to step back and leave this alone. I’m doing what is needed here.  This is inevitable.”
The destruction, knowing how it ends, watching his teammates get batted around like they are nothing, makes some long forgotten anger bubble in Tony’s gut.
Grabbing Cap's tablet is easy. Tony ignores the browser window open on an article about the Beatles and opens the command prompt. It's takes a few more keystrokes than he would like, but JARVIS is paying attention like always and prepopulating the terms in the window to help him navigate down to the private server level he has set up specifically for the Avengers related items. He eases his way past the firewalls and security measures with JARVIS by-passing them before he even pulls up the next one.
It doesn’t come because he flies out an open back half.  Tony comes to a halt and check the ground, not seeing anyone looking in his direction.
There is a quiet beep, FRIDAY taking note and already tracking down some leads. "What else Tony? I can hear your moans from here."
, he thinks - knows now.  That is the moment when he became a competitor to his own father.
“So do you!” Bruce cries, waving his hands at Tony’s head indistinctly, and Tony has to hide his grin at Bruce’s clear indignation at this entire topic.  “And you’re older than me. You’re the old man!”
Enroute
Steve apologizes once, and Tony brushes it aside.
The other object neatly skims the bottom of his boots, and Tony shoots it, just to break up the organic matter  before it rains down on the people underneath him. “Who threw that Fry?” He asks, as the screen zooms in on Thanos.
“And you got into a fight with a cat and lost an eye,” Peggy continues before turning to Fury with a bandage across the side of his face.  “An alien cat,” she corrects before he can reply.
“Yeah,” Steve sighs.  “She remembers me sometimes.  Others she doesn’t, and those are the hardest moments.  When she sees me for her first time again.”
It’s taken two years, but he’s clawed his way back to an equilibrium, and Tony isn’t looking to lose it any time soon.  But the way Steve’s looking at him, he thinks Steve already knows everything he wants to say.
Tony puts his head in his hands.  “I’m not a baby, you know that right?  I’m a man in my forties.  I am an adult in every country.”
“Who do you think will be the last one standing out of us?” Steve asks, eyes dark with grief, still.
"Stark!" Ross bellows. "You do not have any power in this situation, I can throw you in a hole as deep and as dark as I want, and I will have the backing of the entire UN. Don't cross me."
Maybe she already had.
“I didn’t want someone blaming my work on the Accords on that,” Tony finally says.
Tony turns slowly, takes in the larger hat, the lack of grey streaked red hair, and says, “Hi Ana.”
He says it like it’s a dismissal, and the doors to the lab open. Steve takes a few steps, closer to Tony until Tony has to look up at him, because in the end, they are all fighters and know to keep an eye on your opponent. Tony is weary, and tired, and Steve feels it just standing across from him. “I’m not here to watch you,” he says, carefully, quietly. Tony snorts, and Steve reaches out before aborting the move. Tony is on edge right now, and he won’t accept the touch, even for a second.
He knows he would be.  He always was, of the smallest to largest thing.
She had shaken her head and added, “I should have never listened to your miserable promises.  You could never keep them, and I knew that, but I got caught up in sentiment and forgot my training.”
"So why do ya look like ya been suckin' on lemons? And don't ya shrug at me like that, sweetheart. I wanna know what's goin' on in that busy brain-a yours. Whatever it is, it won't ever be so bad that ya can't tell me."
Tokra
"Pretty damn sure, yeah."
"I am... surprisingly okay with that. We should get a welcoming room or something set up though. I wonder how well we can refine that inter-dimensional GPS..."
"I would have," Steve admitted while popping the top off of two bottles. He didn't like the taste of beer in modern times very much, but he still liked to drink socially. Well, not when he was Captain America - his super-self didn't drink. Plain old Steve Rogers was the one who sipped a cold brew from time to time with his buddies. "I always cave if he cries."
That... hurt, but it wasn't Winter's fault.
"I'd hate you if I didn't love you so much. Please, please don't let them paint it red, white and blue. Please. If you do I'll never, ever, ever make you any upgrades ever again."
“Yeah, yeah. Life or death. It is. So--”
"No, you're breathing crazy. Come on pops - in and out, nice and slow. Steve--"
"Yup."
“Worry wart.” Steve just shrugged at the teasing accusation, giving him another squeeze. He was tempted to deliver another kiss - a friend kiss! - but settled for patting the blond’s chest instead. “Okay. Let’s feed me so I can drink and woo the mayor, who is not so happy with the way those buildings got damaged while we were fighting the Wrecking Crew.” They both winced at the memory and the scathing interview that had been circulating on the news since the battle.
"I still don't understand what you're doing here. Captain Danvers said someone was coming to
"You are a cruel man, friend Steven."
A weary sigh was his only answer, and he was pretty sure that poor JARVIS had had just about enough of being their go-between in moments like this. He just wished he knew what had gone wrong, and why the genius kept blowing so hot and cold. Maybe he should have pushed before now or even sent Nat snooping but he just... he really had wanted Tony to tell him what was going on in his own time.
"Agent Carter?" Both Winter's voice and facial expression shifted just a little, a touch of warmth entering that cold facade. "She isn't so bad, even if she kept me locked up for so long." Natalia said something in Russian that set STAR to giggling while Winter growled back at her; thankfully the animosity seemed more playful than anything. "Ignore her. Natalia thinks since I once taught her knife work I won't stab her with one."
"Induction?" Steve's brow furrowed, and he found himself trailing after Rhodes like a lost puppy. "What am I getin' inducted into?"
"Always will."
Tony was gaping like a landed fish and couldn't do anything to stop it. Captain America -
"Right! And so she said that I was being dramatic--"
"... I think just the fruit basket'd be fine, but do what ya wanna. It's what you're gonna do anyhow."
"Deckin' me out in your colors," Steve purred, prowling even closer. "Makin' sure everyone knows I'm yours... you claimin' me sweetheart?"
"Nope! You don't get to absolve me of that sin, young grasshopper. It's one I have to live with and learn from. Fuck, being so zen is hard. We need to find you another mentor STAT."
"You shouldn't have to."
He hadn't known that, but now he did know the first kind of flower he was going to buy for the genius. Though he did sort of wonder why Tony knew about their meaning.
When Peggy and Loki came to their floor early in the morning, Steve feared another descent into worry and guilt and fear on Tony's part. Instead his lover gave him a quick kiss, then announced he was going to talk to Pepper about official SI business. He took that as code for 'gossiping about the Defenders'. Peggy stared after him with keen interest, probably cataloging all the same differences that he had always taken note of. Loki merely yawned and draped himself in one of the chairs because he was a dramatic fuck who was probably almost fanatical in his devotion to Shellhead.
“Because you'll go right down to your workshop and stay there too long. It's one more day, maybe two. You can make it.”
"I don't have to do anything." The lazy, smug arrogance in Winter's voice probably shouldn't have made him as proud as it did. "Not anymore. But I am choosing to do this, so don't worry so much Stevie. Besides," he shrugged, the motion making Steve think of mountains slowly shifting. "Tony Stark did not have to help me but he did. It is my turn to... pay it forward. Terrible movie." Winter was adorable when he wrinkled his nose. Probably wouldn't appreciate being told that though, so he kept his mouth shut. "I don't know why your Antosha made me watch it."
"Boys." Peggy's exasperation drew his attention back to what was really important. The scold in her voice was enough to make even Loki subside. "He was nearly feral when we first brought him to the mansion and he realized we were not going to allow him to return to his... handlers." The moue of disgust and hardness in her eyes suggested that if he ever met said handlers he would be sorely tempted to beat them black and blue. "He didn't... he still doesn't remember much Steve. And overwhelming him with the past right now--"
"Better give some parameters or they'll be poppin' in and out all-a the damn time."
"And when it warms up a bit we can set up a tent in the yard for ya'," he added when Doreen still didn't look quite convinced. "So whattaya think? Wanna come check it out?"
"Rhodes? I thought you were with--"
~.~.~
being petty on his behalf, because he knew his lover wouldn't take it too far. Probably.
"I get it kid. I'll get ya in, I promise. Have a little faith in me, yeah? I'm Captain America after all."
Harley's warning had him rolling in the air, only just quick enough to dodge the... the...
"And Antosha. And Tony Stark"
"Tony," Rogers greeted, eyes only flicking to his for a moment before he zeroed back in on Steve. "It's not even three yet - not sure you should have that scotch."
Sara Rogers would be ashamed of him for it, but his ma was dead and buried in a whole other world.
"Of course they do. You're my sweetheart," he said like it was really that simple. "Always have been. They'd love ta meet ya after all the stories I told. Showed some of 'em some of the pictures too. And they..." The pause couldn't mean anything good, so he braced himself only to have Steve kiss his temple again. "They know that ya might not want ta know them right away. Some of 'em look an awful lot like the people who hurt ya. They don't want ta bring up any bad memories or anything. Shellhead says I should punch Rogers in the dick for him."
"There we go girl. One of your brothers is gonna come pick us up and after that we're gonna get you feeling so much better. That's right sweetheart... we're goin' home." The dog gave a sigh that - to his ears - sounded pretty damn happy. She pressed her head a little harder into his stomach and settled one paw on his leg, tail thumping away as he carefully scratched her side.
"Sure did, and she's at least seven, maybe eight. We're gonna have ta get her ta a doctor, and see if she's been goin' ta school and such. Gotta decide on if we wanna send her ta school or do it at home until she settles."
"Steven Brian Rogers, I am incredibly disappointed with you." Peggy had always been able to make him feel like his ma was scolding him. He couldn't help but wince away from her voice and the displeased purse of her blood red lips. Loki, meanwhile, was smirking as the boys rolled over to poke and prod and investigate. Probably would have made Tony crazy with worry, but he knew the mage would be gentle with the kids. "It's been months and we've heard
"Trust me, we were all scared. With the older Avengers maybe they weren't afraid of... of getting hurt, but..." Harley paused and tried to pull his thoughts together, wanting to get this right for Peter. He was the big brother - he
"Yeah yeah. See you soon."
"You're a good kid." Harley's cheeks pinked, but the young man didn't even try to dodge the hug Steve wrapped him up in, just returned it with equal strength. "We did somethin' right with ya. I'll drag your pops home and we'll see ya tomorrow."
"I'm not here to reassure. I'm here to make sure he doesn't panic and stab you." STAR growled at that, then zipped over to Natalia and tried to singe her ear. The super spy dodged, of course, and the wall ended up with a tiny streak of black instead. "Calm down, little firecracker. I'm sure it won't come to that."
Steve had been solemnly presented with a golden apple years before that. Tony and Shellhead had been doing experiments with the version of Extremis cooked up in Steve's universe, and something had gone horribly wrong. The race to save them had ended with the pair of them forever altered. Tony confided to Steve that the change was one he welcomed; something about the way Extremis worked inside of his body eased the pain that lingered after Soul. Once he understood what had happened, Thor had obtained an apple for Steve; they had been forced apart too many times, he told them, and if it was within his power to keep that from happening again any time soon, then by the Norns he would do it.
been the first major battle the boys had taken part in. His sour patch was pretty resolute that one day Harley and Peter would be leaders in the Avengers Initiative. He'd want to start training them in the minutiae that Tony and Steve never had to bother with anymore.
Of course Shellhead would know what he wanted to do.
~.~.~
“No. That shit smells disgusting and I don’t care that you only get it on one pizza. It stinks up the whole tower.”
"All-a that stuff is..." he stopped and considered, then shrugged a shoulder. "Way above my pay level ta be honest. Not much good at that kinda thinkin'. Battle strategy and such is more my area, but it could be your friend Ned is right. Maybe he ain't, I dunno. I'm actually from... well. A whole other world. Shellhead and Lokes were always talkin' about some kind-a multiverse or somethin'? Anyway. My world is really close ta bein' just like this one, but they ain't the same. Came here ta be with Tony and I'm real glad I did. But no, I ain't... 'Cap'."
. He'd kept that quiet and didn't think much about it, because that was even less of a possibility. Going to look for it would only end in him bloody and bruised in some back alley and Buck being ashamed of him. So there wasn't gonna be a fella or a dame, no kids or even a dog. It was gonna be him all alone at the end, and that was just the way things were. Hadn't stopped him from dreaming sometimes, but he'd never really expected it to change.
He couldn't help but start to laugh, a real one this time with shoulder action and everything. Nat looked like the cat who'd gotten into the cream when he peeked up, her mouth curved into a barely-there smile. She ruffled his hair one last time and slipped from the table; he mourned the loss of both her company and the way she'd been petting him. The look she gave him while crossing to the couch was very much 'double-dog dare ya', and the skinny kid from Brooklyn had
If he lost Tony, Steve knew that he would never be okay again.
"I promise I'll keep in touch, Lokes. I didn't mean ta... I was just so damn happy ta be back. I got lost in that for a bit'n I didn't wanna... Tony worries that I'll leave again."
He took another gulp of water to earn an approving grin, then downed the rest of the glass for good measure. “I’m not getting my other drink until I put some food in my stomach, am I?”
"That's... amazing."
"Oh, but the suit just magically fit my exact measurements, huh? Because I know enough about engineering to know that that didn't just happen, Tones. You made that suit for me." Rhodes followed his words with a kissy face, which made Tony giggle and Steve growl under his breath. "Thank you for the present, and if the Air Force wants to change the name of
"I'd say it's nice of you to say that, but you're a hallucination so I guess it's nice of me to say that."
"... you think?"
"Prob'ly a good idea. All-a our girls on one team? We'd be doomed. Wouldn't abandon ya ta join 'em, but yeah. We'd lose." Tony sniffed a dismissal at the notion even if he agreed with it. Pep opened her mouth and he was quick to head her off by clearing his throat.
As he ate and waited for Peter to come back, he weighed his options. On the one hand, Tony had apparently forbidden Fri from even
The flight home was an exercise in endurance for both of them. It took everything he had not to curl up in Tony's lap and just fall asleep there. All that really stopped him in the end was knowing that Tony was just as tired and was still managing to fly them home. If the tower had been any further away it would have been a problem; even the half-hour it took them was a struggle.
None of us require your admiration, Steven.
Bruce had been doing so much better since he moved into the tower. Some of the tension had drained from his shoulders and he didn't look quite so hunted anymore. Tony had even heard him laughing a few times, and he knew his Brucie-bear enjoyed having a lab of his own again. They were becoming friends, which gave him a warm fuzzy feeling he refused to acknowledge (
"From a mad scientist. Never got much bigger'n I already was, but I got some muscles outta the deal. Hey, if I called Pepper and got her ta stop by'n confirm she sees me… would that help?"
"Yeah. Yeah you are. This is what you agreed to."
"Because the way you all keep asking about it is way too good to give up."
"Didja gimme a new name?" Tony would have answered, he would have, but Steve chose that moment to sink his teeth into the side of his neck. It was just this side of painful, and all he could do was buck up in response while giving a hoarse cry. Steve chuckled, then gave the same spot a few kitten licks to soothe the burn. "Bet ya did. Bet ya came up with somethin' all meaningful and sweet and all-a that. Ya can tell me all about that... later."
He didn't know how to fix it, didn't know how to say 'hey, could you please start touching me' to a friend. When he thought about it, really thought about it, Nat and Thor were the only ones who ever did. They were the same friendly, familial touches he'd gotten from Bucky and it didn't take long until it didn't feel like enough. How did you tell someone that you wanted to wrap them up in a hug? How could he ask Tony to snuggle up to his chest so Steve could tuck that dark head of hair under his chin? How was he supposed to let Tony know that he might wither up and die if Tony didn't start granting him the same level of casual intimacy that he gave the rest of the Avengers?
The story Rhodes had told about the animal shelter stuck with him. He had thought about going to visit but with Tony working so hard to keep his distance, Steve knew it wasn't his place to arbitrarily step in. Still, he loved knowing about it, loved that Tony's heart was big enough to save even lab rats that probably hadn't known love a day in their lives. He could see it, the way hearing about them would have put little lines of distress around Tony's eyes. He'd probably planned for months how to get them out of their cages safely - there was no way it had been a spur of the moment decision. Maybe he'd needed to be drunk to put it into motion, but the idea had been rattling around that genius brain long before that night.
It wasn't that he disliked Colonel Rhodes, who insisted Steve not use his rank when they were in the tower. When they were one on one Steve thoroughly enjoyed their conversations. The man was brilliant, fierce and skilled, a credit to the Air Force and the country. He was glad Rhodes had been born in a time where he could achieve the high rank he deserved; he'd known too many soldiers held back by the color of their skin while white men less deserving claimed all the honor. Race relations had gotten better, even if he was learning that there was still a long way to go.
"Sounds like whoever's been takin' care of ya
"Ya ain't shootin' nobody," he interrupted while Rogers took a deep breath, looking ready to start bellowing the way he always seemed to. "This is why nobody wants ta take ya nowhere but The Vortex, ya savage. Sorry 'bout him. Manners are--"
"For fuck's sake." His fella sounded more amused than anything now, thank God. "Stop breaking him Harls. I only just got him back."
It was like a scene from his best fantasies. He whimpered and arched up against the other man, who promptly shushed him and curled one hand around his hips. Those elegant fingers squeezed down, first reassuringly and then hard enough to leave the best kind of bruises. A moment later Steve gave him a push; he fell onto the bench, legs splayed and hands behind him to support him. The way the other man was licking his lips was extremely promising, and he couldn't help but shiver at the look in his
"That was... that was really sweet. You're both gross though and should remove yourselves from my person." Thank fuck they both knew him well enough not to obey the order. As he watched Rogers swagger forward, offering his hand to Rhodey to shake, he was torn between fear and fury. The mixture was causing panic instead, which was
"Okay, here's what we're gonna do. We are not going to only get tacos - dessert is the best part of any meal. Because I am a generous man, I will let you decide if we're going for ice cream or pastries. And Steve? I said some shitty things that I didn't mean back then, and I thought after that you wouldn't want to be anything more than teammates. Super happy to know I was wrong, but this is absolutely not the bribe I am using to buy your silence. We're friends, I'm sorry for that bad first impression, and now we will never speak of that again. Hey, how are you on art supplies? Because I can definitely see using art supplies to keep you from running your mouth."
He had such good kids.
Before he could try to explain the whole complicated mess, which he honestly didn't fully understand himself, they'd arrived at their destination. He could hear Rogers through the door assuring Bucky that it would all be alright; that would probably change once he realized just what kind of outside help Carol had called in. Rogers really, really didn't like him after all. And what he'd do when faced with a different James Barnes was anybody's guess.
“I still have some people to shmooze. Fury gave me a list.” He laughed at the look on Steve’s face and took the glass that was pressed into his hand. Water first of course, and he took a generous sip before he even looked at the scotch that would hopefully get him through a few more annoying conversations. “So if we’re gonna be glued together you’re going to have to put your game face on and give ‘em the old razzle dazzle with me.”
"I'm not going to run again." Bucky's voice was stronger than he would have given the guy credit for, and he was still looking at Winter head on. Maybe there was more there than met the eye and he needed to stop judging situations he didn't know anything about. It was just... he looked at Bucky and saw exactly what he hadn't wanted for Winter. "You kept the name?"
worse things to use as blackmail. Besides - dancing while he worked was part of his process and he had mad moves anyway. His singing voice was a little more questionable, which was why he mostly only mouthed along while jamming out. He didn't need his boys judging him, which they absolutely would. So it was better to limit himself to the dancing and the lip syncing because he excelled at both.
She evaded Captain Marvel's first strike only to have his ion beam skim over her left shoulder. As she tried to readjust her stance, head whipping towards him, Captain Marvel struck again. This time her fist collided right into spear chick's jaw and shoved her right into the ion beam that he'd never let up. Her shriek echoed over the battlefield and everything seemed to stop and go quiet for just a few heartbeats. He didn't feel anything but triumph as the ions ripped through her armor and then through flesh - he was pretty happy that most smells couldn't make it through the suit's air filtration system, because from Captain Marvel's wrinkled nose, spear chick was definitely smelling like barbecue.
"Is that right?" There was a smile playing around Cap's mouth again, and Tony hated the thrum of happiness that started up in his veins. "Well I'm gonna have to disappoint you, I guess. 'Cause I can't think of anythin' I could tell you that'd compare to that."
"Tried ta be. For your sake, mostly. I left ya - had ta try'n make it worth it. Don't think it really was."
“I want pizza. The place in Brighton Beach does a wonderful
With his mother had gone the apartment, of course. The landlord had wanted them out for a while, but kicking the beloved Sarah Rogers out onto the street would have garnered him too much ill-will in their tightly knit community. Her son, a skinny scrap of nothing who was sweet but useless was another matter entirely. He'd been without a home practically before the body went cold. It had been hard, losing the place they'd lived in together so soon after losing her... but he managed okay. He always did.
Steve looked down at his favorite set of comfy clothes and could admit that they were kind of shabby. He'd ripped the sweatpants in a few places and stretched the t-shirt out; both were stained and verging on gross. If they weren't so damned comfortable he would have thrown them out months ago. So sure he didn't exactly look his best, but he'd only expected to see his Rosie and the other Avengers for the rest of the day and they'd all seen him in that particular get up before.
seemed to have a different opinion.
"Don't look like your archer right now." Sulking was childish and wouldn't change anything, but it was really hard not to pout. "Looks like he might be someone else's."
"The park is a great place for Tappy ta live, but I think maybe for little girls it ain't the best."
"You had no right--"
He didn't see STAR zoom inside of the thing, but he could see the way her signal went patchy on his UI, and he could hear her trying to sass at them through the static that was drowning her words. There wasn't much they could do but keep the Nightmare Beast occupied, because now Tony could see why Harley had needed a new suit. Coating those fucking tentacles was some kind of corrosive substance. While the hit he'd taken had only left a few pits in his armor, prolonged contact was devastating.
"Also a possibility, yeah. We good, Pep?"
to actually
The machines he was hooked up to didn't appreciate the way his heart was pounding, and they'd given a few warning beeps already. Thankfully they weren't set up to alert Rhodey or Pep first for small jumps anymore. Fri got the initial reports of any small periods of hinky readings and if Steve was really back then she would know exactly why it was happening. She wouldn't get worried unless it lasted for more than a few minutes. If Steve was... if he was really there, Fri was definitely going to get worried. They might have a doctor walk in on their morning kiss, but that would be fine because it meant Steve was there.
"Vacation." Steve agreed firmly. "We're takin' one with most-a the kids. Dunno if Harley or Peter'll wanna come. Laney's got school, so she probably wouldn't be allowed. Alicia's serious about education. Should I get Pegs ta start lookin' for a beach house?"
, but even the brief (but
"Well yeah. I mean,
"I want ya ta come on over ta the tower soon as ya feel ready, Peter Parker," he said as the kid got ready to go home and finish up his homework. "I'll talk ta Tony, find out why the hell he's bein' this way, so just get your butt ta the tower and I'm sure it'll all work out just fine."
"He's tricking you, Tony. Let me help. Please. We had our disagreements," there was that word again, so dismissive and so fucking hurtful it made it even harder to breath. "But that doesn't mean I'm going to let you get hurt."
"Was that back when you had to walk ten miles to school in the snow, barefoot and uphill both ways?"
"'Course he is. Why'd ya think I wanted ta get back ta him so bad?" Loki only rolled his eyes, but that was fine - his brain was busy whirring with questions. He'd always thought of the 'bots as people, and Fri too. Maybe she didn't have a body and maybe they didn't look much like regular people, but they'd never felt like simple machines. He guessed them having
Heartfelt gratitude and shmoop it was.
sweating, which was rare outside of a real fight. His body ached pleasantly, and he had a few minor cuts and bruises that were already healing. "I know that ain't how you really talk."
"Don't you two start - I want to focus on this because it's hilarious."
"Not that it was
"Nah. We've got a connection - I think I'd better stick with you."
"They can't have you," he announced which was what got everyone else looking. "I don't care if they're your friends, your
already got it, no words needed. It was nice to be able to hug Pep tight and plant a smooch on her forehead and know without a doubt that Steve wasn't feeling jealous or threatened. Even nicer was the way the two of them could be close again without it feeling awkward or forced.
"You're not going to cut me any slack, are you?"
"Not the time," he bit out as he fought for control of the suit. Before he managed, somebody else caught him - Shellhead, back from the evac. "If it's not life threatening, I don't want to hear it, okay baby girl? You keep your focus on your jobs."
"Did you smoke any strange roots or anything while you were in Wakanda?" Nat didn't give anything away, but Tony could read Rogers and Sam like a book. "Oh please. Where else could you have gone? It wasn't that hard to figure out. I am surprised T'Challa gave you an aircraft."
"Ya good, sweetheart?" Steve's voice was full of concern on their private channel. His
"How would I know enough about your missions to pick one?" Tony tried for an innocent look, but from the way Clint snorted he didn't wear it as well as he had when he'd been a doe-eyed twenty year old. "It's a fair offer though. SHIELD's reports are pretty dull."
“Precautions, pranks, whatever. The point is that Captain Wet Blanket is about to burst through those doors and I need you to protect me from his wrath. So. Bucket and Bolts! Where are y- oh, hey.” Clint fist bumping with his ‘bots would never not bring a smile to his face. The way Butterfingers immediately pulled back and dove into a more complicated handshake was just… perfection.
a huge name here, pops." Tony's eyes flew up to Harley's, and his kid looked as serious as he ever had. Did that mean... did Harley want... "One of the best for robotics, actually. Jan and Shellhead said that if I'm lookin' for a school, that's the one I want. Said that for backups I should look at--"
~.~.~
"It is."
"You don't know anything about me or Bucky, so why don't you shut your mouth? We got a reading on Loki's magic here just a little while ago - I know you're just one of those clones he can make. I never believed he was dead no matter what Thor told us. Now I know what scheme he's been working."
. I'm old, I'm tired, and he's better off without me."
~.~.~
"You're kind of scaring me J."
"Because she's a bloodthirsty savage. All-a the rest of 'em are with Alicia'n Pepper is stayin' with us. That okay?"
"He might say no."
"But anyway, my friend Ned likes to read about those kinds of theories. You know, about parallel universes and stuff. Like every decision spawns off a different one, so there are countless like, threads of this world, you know? Like, you meeting me here is happening in
"Not making a promise like that." Winter cussed at him, though Steve still wasn't exactly sure what that particular Russian word
"Sounds good." Sounded almost like a date, really, but it couldn't be. Not with the way Tony had been so strange around him lately. Not with how he'd avoided him for that past few days. It was just a friendly movie between friends, so he absolutely should not try to sneak a few kisses once they were snuggled together on the couch.
It was probably too much to hope that Tony wouldn't call the woman a 'mean old witch' to her face though.
"Peter's got that project for school he's workin' on."
He got what he wanted in the form of a nod and a mouthed 'you big sap'. Beaming, he mouthed back a 'thank you' before turning the whole of his attention back to Doreen.
"They'd be outta danger. And since the only way Thanos is gettin' 'em is over my dead body, we weren't sure the portal would still work if'n we lost. It was better ta send 'em before the fight in case they couldn't have gone after. I'm sorry we worried ya--"
"Could you equip maybe half of them with timers?"
"What? Oh, I... I'm sorry. It's just..." Rhodey could understand her awe and disbelief, but none of it helped the two men who had somehow done the impossible. Tony and Steve had been in a coma for almost a week - one of the longest weeks of his life. He had watched the both of them fall after defeating Thanos, too far away to do anything but give a wordless cry of fear. Of course he had shot straight towards them, all of the Avengers and the borrowed Defenders doing the same... but none of them had been able to get close.
"Yeah." The more the thought about it the more he warmed to the idea. "We could take the bots'n Starry Skies with us for sure, and didn't ya say that ya were close ta figurin' out a way ta transport Fri too?"
"I can't," he said, staring down at his bottle. "I... there's... I've got this plan. I don't... I don't want to spook him or make him feel like me bein' his friend was just me tryin' to... if he never wanted anything else, I'd be honored to be his friend. I don't want him to think--"
"I am very sorry for not visiting earlier, beautiful. If I'd known that this lug--"
"Didn't say you were."
"Go ta the workshop'n play with the numbers, yeah? I'm gonna go play with that metal clay stuff ya bought me."
"I pay attention, since I love you and all."
“Uh--”
"That's what big brothers are for." Usually Peter would argue, and they would bicker over how much difference a few months really made. Harley thought maybe the idea of having a big brother just then was more comforting than annoying. It was... it was nice, really nice. Being a big brother was something he was good at, something warm and good and true that nobody could take away from him.
"So I know we don't hug, but I totally want to give you the biggest bear hug ever. Consider this an air hug, okay? Because nobody--" Tony bit off the rest of his sentence, shoulder going just a little tight as he looked away. "Most people
After Howard had died, Tony had been able to forget a little of that. He had other things to think about - booze and drugs, beautiful women and men who were more than happy to come to his bed. There was a company to pretend he was any good at running, weapons to be designed, wars to be won and soldiers to be protected. Even if disappointment had wrapped around his bones tightly enough that it never really went away, Tony didn't dwell on the reasons why very often. He didn't have time to think about all the ways Captain America would loathe him, and he hadn't realized how much more it would hurt now that Howard's happiness was no longer the trade-off. Hell, Tony had given up any real hope of Captain America ever being found years ago anyway.
"I am not
"Smiles don't talk, Tony." The genius scoffed and Steve hid another smile in the fur on top of Primrose's head. Once he felt like he wasn't so happy he could bust, he directed a look back up at Tony. "We were just about to settle in for a movie. Wanna join us?"
My internet situation is going to be a bit more iffy than I initially thought - I knew I was moving before, but my mum ran into some unexpected expenses because my brother is a moron, so. She can't change her cable plan for a couple more weeks, which means I only have internet at my apartment, where I will only be a few days a week. Depending on how it goes I might just aim for a different posting day.
It was better this way... but whiskey still burned all the way down.
"You can't even get drunk. Why the hell would I give you any of my beer?"  Rhodes' shoulder bumped playfully into his while he entered, another small smile on his face. "Though I am willing to hand one over for your induction."
During their side conversation Rogers' face had turned a deep shade of red, one that appeared a lot whenever he was in the room with the guy. At least he'd relaxed his fists. Though the way he was edging closer to Bucky and trying to step out in front of him wasn't a great sign.
Tony had grown up knowing with absolute certainty that Captain America was going to hate him. He guessed it was a good thing that
"You do the same, alright? I might not be ready to visit-visit, but I'll totally come kick some ass with you if you need it."
team," and was that a tiny wince on Nat's part, or was it just his ego talking? "And leave."
But Mr. Stark is only considered an auxiliary member--
Tony was almost 100% sure that he had never given birth to any flesh and blood children, and that sliver of ‘maybe, who the hell knows’ remaining was all the fault of magic and weird dimensional loop holes. He was 110% certain that in the universe they were currently in he had never gotten busy with Captain America and then brought a screaming, squirming Hawkeye into the world. That was just… it was a no-go, on all fronts. The only part of that he was only a little sad about was the whole not getting it on with Steve, which--
“I hear you’re being mean to our son.” The blond stopped dead in his tracks, the fury melting from his expression. He looked absolutely dumbfounded and turned impossibly redder. Tony was tempted to try and throw a few blueberries into his slack mouth. “I would like an explanation from you, Steven Grant Rogers.”
Tony's entire body froze, eyes wide and startled enough that he worried the man would run. "Really? You wanted... but she's your dog, Steve."
"And ya beat it all ta hell before ya left him bleedin' out, didn't ya? Put your shield through his heart hard enough ta make all that metal buckle. What the hell do ya think was under there, ya stupid fuck? That was flesh and blood underneath and ya left without even lookin' back. Not once - didn't even hesitate. Gotta say, if the Bucky I know is anythin' like the one ya had as a friend... he's gotta be awful ashamed-a ya, and your ma would tan your goddamned hide. Since she ain't here ta do it, I'm happy ta step in."
. So if there are any... trains--"
"On it da." Without being asked, Kamala let them go and stepped away, bouncing over toward Jess. That was a pairing he'd never understand, but the hard-ass detective gave the girl a fond smile before going back to completely ignoring Natasha. Meanwhile, Harley's armor was emerging and wrapping around the teen; Tony knew he could call forth his own, but he'd rather let his kid take care of him. "Come on. I'll get you home and we'll let Aunt Pep say 'I told you so' and then we'll go down to the workshop and blow some stuff up. Or we could watch a movie with Dum and U. But first you gotta stop breathing crazy so I can take you up into the air without you passing out."
Obviously they got it from Tony, since he'd never been stubborn a day in his life.
Dum-E handed over his last pencil, and he broke out into a brilliant grin. "Thanks Dum-E! That was the fastest you ever got 'em back to me yet." The 'bot lifted up straight and made a cheerful little sound that never failed to lift Steve's spirits. "Yeah buddy - you did great. Always do. Wanna get your ball?
