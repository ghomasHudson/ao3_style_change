“No, you were better this time so I’ll give you that” Castiel smirks behind his towel- he couldn’t let him see his disappointment after all “Just spit it out- I don’t intend on testing my people skills today”
Dean commented as he made his way towards Castiel’s ruffled tent, the sky was stagnant the moment he left his cabin and only blurry images of their conversation existed in that battered head of his. He felt his fever rising again as his stomach growled uneasily, he couldn’t comprehend over the fact that he was actually getting back into his old roots again.
“I know. I trust you” Dean kisses his hair and lets his hand rub Castiel’s waist slowly, he pulls him in even closer and Dean laughs at the gesture “I’m…I’m glad you’re here, Cas”
Castiel had to stifle a smile during this “I have come to help you out. With your trap” he moves away from Dean and goes towards Sam, whose mouth is still agape by shock.
Dean looks up from the rocks and twigs lodged into the heels of his boots, the ground was shaking by the myriad of boots banging against it- he clenches his chest harder, the amulet digging into his skin the more he pulled it around his neck. He clutches harder as the gaps between his breathing become more stretched out; his gritted teeth weren’t helping him keep his tears back- he swallowed hard and waited- waited for whatever was going to come. He didn’t care. He chose not to care.
"This isn't making any sense, bu-but why have I heard someone say that to me before? Why does it feel like you've given me that name?"
Dean blinks and hums the tune that floats in the air- he lets the song flow over him once more, he forces himself to think of nothing more- only the song remains, only the song
“It isn’t…” Castiel clenches his fists upon his knees as he bites his lips slowly “…it isn’t like that. I’m not unaffected or pretending I’m just… I just want to talk to you, that’s all” his words come out as a whisper. The gentility in his voice was loud in Dean’s ears and still as warm and fragile as he remembered- he felt it crumble inside of him all over again, his faint breathing so human and numbing that he found it hard to believe that he was anything
“Well shockingly just two days, I guess it must’ve been some deep sleep you boys needed- especially after what happened”
, as much as Sam and anyone else on this goddamn planet because…you’re the only part of me that deserves to…that deserves those fleeting moments more than anyone”
“Why do I keep doing this to myself? It’s not so bad right now, so why do I…?” He speaks at his reflection; he sees the answer in his eyes and found it senseless that he even asked himself that.
He watches them stand far away from each other, Castiel is sitting in the truck's carrier, holding his chest and breathing deeply. Dean does the same, but he stands alone near the hollow drained trees, stifling whatever emotion he felt now, something he’s been doing his entire life.
“Aah, fuck this” you mumble under your breath and decide to stand beside Castiel again, even as he attempted to keep you behind him- but he should know by now, you didn’t need any angel boy toy to protect you.
"Dean?" Sam whispers as he closes the door and makes his way inside, the wooden floor creaked underneath and he winces internally. Dean stood up from his short stool and dims the yellow glow slightly, he turns the lantern dial slowly but his eyes are fixed the on the window to his right. The fog rose with all of it's glory and thickened with every breath they took, the blue lit atmosphere a daunting weight upon their shoulders. The wind was obsolete and no foreign shadows appeared in the darkness-thankfully. Dean takes a sigh of relief as he slowly walks towards his stool again, away from the aggravating view. Sam crosses by him with a sullen look in his weary eyes and rests upon the wall nearest to Dean.
“Well, this is the worst situation we’ve ended up in, yet” Dean speaks into the huddle you created, Sam shows the number of bullets in his hands, maybe 10 or so, but all useless. Your angel blade is intact but it took a lot of your essence to even manage to get to the creature’s head, Dean shows his handgun, a few salt coated bullets and flammable rounds looked useable “This is better than nothing, I didn’t try burning the thing” You muse and look at Dean who also manages to make a small smile, his gleam returning again if only for a moment.
Castiel’s eyes reflect an unknown sadness, something Crowley picked up on instantly “Okay-okay I take that last comment back. Who are we kidding? They never get over anything; we wouldn’t love them if they did! But I’ll say this…don’t make the same mistake again. Things can be different if you play your cards right and honestly this might be the best thing for both of you-who knows how much of that grace can protect you out here. With them at least you have someone who you can fall back on-god I sound just like them now” Crowley winces internally at his comment, it brought a smile to Castiel’s face “Just…consider it before they lock me up and torture me for information again-just like the good old days” Crowley takes a few steps away and watches the wind blow through Castiel’s hair and coat, his face a little less strained from before “Oh and no promises on me telling them how you named your cat Dean. That’s just too precious for me not to squeal about” Crowley winks and waves with his fingers
“You see, isn’t it nice when you reunite? I really wish I could thank you personally for everything you did for me and my nest in particular. Especially your dad” Luther pushed the hair from his face and saw the rage beginning to build up inside Dean “I honestly couldn’t believe the words that came out of my soldiers mouths! They kept on claiming that
“Yeah… I know this sounds weird but- it’s not his memory per say- but I remember something from our conversation with that thing”
him! I honestly couldn’t believe the words until I was able to see you for myself. And well, look at what we have here…” Luther continued his speech as he walked circles around him. Dean was choking on his own blood before he managed to pick himself up from the ground, spitting out the excess blood as he did. He glared at Luther and tilted his head slightly, clearly showing him his tough side
Why does the ground seem so unscathed? No footprints, no form of life existed near him, Castiel murmurs something under his breath but it's so faint. Dean looks at him with worry in his eyes but feels powerless to do anything. He lifts his eyes and looks at the eerie calm that invaded their space.
Dean gasped and bit his lip, he ran towards Sam's unconscious form and pulls him by his shoulder. He watches his brown hair flow gently from his dim eyes, he looked paler than he had remembered; Dean starts saying his name and shakes him profusely but he didn't respond. He places his fingers on his neck and his ear on his chest simultaneously.
“I wonder why” Crowley mumbles as he fiddles with his thumbs and looks away. Sam tried to hide his laugh but couldn’t do so in time.
Dean rushed towards the direction where his cage was and he fiddled with the pockets of the bloody corpse inside, he felt the keys jingle as he laced his finger around the chain and he chuckled almost maniacally. Castiel moaned again as he heard Dean and he got scared by his silhouette, he tried to shuffle away at the sight of him and he winced in pain. Dean patted him lightly and smiled at him “Hey, hey it’s me… I’m getting you out of here so you need to be extremely quiet okay, Cas?” He calmed him down by rubbing his chest and Castiel just hummed and fainted again. Dean rolled his eyes and pulled him towards him; he lifted his limp body effortlessly and dashed towards the trees in order to sneak past the crowd. The sound of a screech made Dean stumble in his wake and he continued to run towards his destination. Dean blinked in a dumbfounded fashion as he sees Luther’s nest scramble about from their meeting point, several others were running in the opposite direction as tears streamed down from their face; he couldn’t understand what was happening across the field until his eyes grasped onto a strange figure appearing above the fire pit.
“Okay-that’s it” Dean wraps his arm around his waist and lifts him up from the floor while his other arm supported his frozen legs “Dean! What are you?!” Castiel retorts as he buries his face in Dean’s neck, he didn’t even want to open his eyes as he carried him to the bed and placed him slowly. He’s shaking in his arms-he doesn’t want to but his jittery body didn’t feel like it could contain the emotions surging through his veins. It was all too much
“Oh, so you do remember me? I wonder if you’ll remember this too!” and with his sentence he kicked Dean once more but this time in his stomach. The persistent throbbing began to rise in his gut and Dean was coughing hysterically and failing miserably to breathe in some air.
The sound of crackling wood occupied the remnants of Dean’s mind, he could hear it at a short distance but he couldn’t really open his eyes to see it himself. The smell of ash lingers in the air from the remains of burnt wood and he could hear the hissing sound of a beer can being opened. Dean feels at peace by these senses alone, until he hears a voice.
Balthazar stared with no ounce of remorse, he simply chapped his lips and looked annoyed by Castiel’s hesitant tone- how has he managed to live this long with them and still feel like he didn’t belong? Was he missing something?
His eyes are frozen- the blue in his eyes disappearing like the clouds in the sky- he speaks again but in the same tone as before, completely unaffected “I know I haven’t been the best person to rely on in recent times… and I do not blame you for not trusting me now- but believe me when I say this. I want to
“Then what else did you mean? What else did you fucking mean when you told me to fucking leave? You want to know what my problem is?” He takes two steps closer to him while Dean takes one step back “I’m always, and I mean ALWAYS thinking about how inevitable the despicable crossroads have been in my life, thinking that it may get better but alas there’s always something that ends up taking all of that away. And all I’m left is with this hollow sack I call my own, my body that refuses to acknowledge that it’s changing even though it feels as if it wasn’t meant to change-”
“God damn it Cas!” he screams with his eyes closed, the light was starting to burn his skin a little. Dean lunges towards him in one swift jump and manages to get a hold of him. He places his hand at the back of his neck and pulls him in, forcing his own weight on him so that gravity could do the rest, but it wasn't working.
“Tell ya what- I noticed you looking at this-eh-” he takes off the mp3 player and the unused headphones around his neck and places it in Castiel’s pulled in hand
“They were werewolves! I couldn’t bloody remember what had attacked us! And I honestly can’t say why I considered being bait- I didn’t really have any other choice I suppose”
There’s a knock on the door and Castiel is brought back to his senses, his bag is open in front of him, the prickly fresh scent from his clean clothes and skin soothing his thoughts. The veins in his wrists pop a little more than usual as he assembles his belongings and wraps his bowls, flask and ruined pages of ancient maps and drawings, he had no recollection as to why he had collected these scribbles in the first place, maybe he intended on getting out of here one day? Getting out of America? That would be a nice change of pace, if there’s a slight chance that something still exists out there.
“Be quiet, all of you” his gaze wanders to you as he speaks, you try to form a sentence but for some reason you can’t- his slow breathing inundating in your ears. He closes the door as you and Sam try to catch up to him but only find yourself locked inside. You fiddle with the doorknob maniacally and try to push it in synch with Sam- but the strange warding upon the door only sizzled your skin as you do. Sam winces and rubs his shoulder before he looks at you, wide eyed and frozen.
The orange specks on its white fur was completely soaked but even then it refused to move-their little body quivered from the cold as they sat pouting with their folded paws-it was hard to look away “Hello. I’m…Castiel” He whispers in its direction “Wouldn’t it be better if you sat underneath this bridge instead? You’re not doing yourself any favors by sitting outside in the rain”
"Hey! Were you in this class?" He pounced when he noticed how much I wanted to avoid him. "Umm, yes I was" I murmured. He kept looking at me in such a distinct manner, his eyes were squinting for some reason, it felt as if he was trying his best to know who I was, or was I just imagining it?.
I grin at his answer, surely I wouldn't leave him but his serious tone made me a little scared too. I wrap my arms around him and take him all in. His heart was beating fast, and so was mine.
I hid behind a nearby tree and placed my back against its rock hard wrinkled skin. I took a deep breath and muttered insults while I stood. He was taking so damn long. I needed to know how his exam went, hell I didn't even care about the exam I just wanted to see him.
Dean's heartbroken tone was ringing in my ears, no matter what I did I couldn't stop thinking about him. The moment he touched me I knew something was wrong, but I refused to run away, I had to hurt him instead. I rolled over to the other side and buried my head even deeper inside the pillows, hopefully I wouldn't choke myself to death.
Sam stops the truck and starts fiddling with the items in his bag, making sure he sets the apparatus accordingly- to say he was panicking would be an understatement but he was steadying his breathing the more his hands grabbed onto the pieces. Dean is already out of the truck, banging the door behind him and standing underneath the largest tree in the area. Sam follows him outside the car, Dean continues to be distracted by the tree- his hazy eyes lingering on the uninteresting leafless branches.
“About… about where we’re going and what we’re going to do- do you really think it’s going to work? This plan you refuse to tell us about?”
The windows begin to shake the heavier the air becomes, everything floats and twists inside of you, completely out of your control
“Wait hold up, just one more thing” Dean waddles slightly as he closes the zipper of his bag and adjusts the holsters wrapped around his waist.
“You know what? I think I’m really tired, Sam will you do the honors?” he pushes on the break so hard that the truck makes a menacing screeching sound, Sam and Castiel both lose their balance and use their hands to keep themselves firm in place. Dean gets out of the truck and opens Castiel’s door with brute force, his eyes suggesting something he doesn’t understand.
Dean looks down as he waits for Sam’s answer; Bobby passes a concerned glance his way and gets closer to him, almost a shoulders length away from Dean as he continued to look up from his book.
" I saw your wings, they were burning away in the light. They were ju- just being erased. I couldn't understand what was happening, I called out to you, but you didn't turn around. I thought that I had lost you, I thought that I had lost everything". I gave into the pain and fell on my knees, just looking at the floor while I held my head in my hands. I started to sob, but not menacingly thank God. I shifted my eyes and looked at him instead, adoring his slender body and long legs "You fell from grace Cas, everyone in heaven did, somehow our memories were erased. And somehow.. We were given a second chance? Even I'm not so sure- gah".
“How about we settle for something on the radio? Maybe hear something other than outdated tracks?” Sam taunts him in a sarcastic way as he pulls out his book and looks back at Dean-who is most probably already planning his murder in his head-even joking about Zeppelin can strike a nerve.
“And what did that bring us? Do you know the fucking colossal damage that you have caused? Not only to us but to every other person on this planet?”  Dean bellows, it wasn’t his intention but he didn’t know how else to respond. Castiel looked so ashamed, his eyes were distant as he tried meeting Dean’s- he didn’t know what to do, he’s never had trouble talking to him before- even when he didn’t reveal himself when he raised him from hell.
“Oh hush now” Balthazar chimes with his annoyingly positive tone “He’s hiding something and honestly I think he’ll be useful to us”
Does it matter? I don’t think it should. They were safe, that’s all you intended to do-permanence, right?
Cas looked worn out, his life source almost drained- there was this strange terror in his eyes and the heavy eye bags were only adding onto it- his mouth was agape and he was having difficulty in saying what he wanted but none of them knew what it was. His stubble had a few scratch marks over them, nothing deep but still concerning to look at- his uncombed locks were falling over his eyes and he kept digging his nails into his scalp incessantly. He wasn’t doing this in an erratic way- Dean believed he was trying to compose himself- for what reason he didn’t know.
. He screams as he crushes the skull in his hands, the blood mingling with the black that laced around it- but never joined. He places his wounded hands on his ears- helplessly trying to make the incessant ringing and beating stop-the world didn’t exist around him, nothing existed around him.
“Those things weren’t supposed to enter this place! Their kind exists in much colder regions than this! Maybe it was just a normal shape shifter!” A relatively older woman exclaimed as she held onto the hands of her companion “They’re not supposed to attack us any way! How is that even possible?” Everyone started to shuffle around in peril and huddled closer to each other as the conversation occurred.
‘What is that message, Cas?”  Sam’s narrow eyes are locked onto Castiel, he struggles to find the strength to say any further as he kept exchanging glances with Dean-who is watching him unnervingly- what was happening?
He hears shuffling behind him and reacts in the most childish way when Dean appears from the back of the truck. His tired green eyes were squinting and trying their best to not seem that way.
“Who’s your little friend?” Cam speaks in the foggy atmosphere and comes closer with Joe, his eyes wide at the sight “You’re really cute aren’t ya?” he flicks his finger towards his little ears but the kitten only digs deeper into Castiel’s coat, hiding in his little burrow “Woah! Okay-okay I won’t bother you” he laughs and steps away-Cam pats his shoulder slowly out of pity but has a smile plastered on her face “You never had a way with animals man, stop trying”
He feels his haziness fade and blinks excessively at a panting Dean. He stops talking as he watches him cautiously “Cas?” Dean shuffles on him a bit and grabs his face recklessly “Cas? Hey! Are you listening to me?” he worries as he shakes him a bit, the green in his eyes becoming dull the longer Castiel stayed quiet.
The shadows lunge towards him with full force, gratifying themselves by the pain he refuses to elicit; they emanate ludicrous snickers and sneer around him with their extended claws and unshakeable grins, they’re enjoying every carved piece of him, his lips moist by the crimson that seeps out. They stare at Castiel with a broken gaze, Dean still scuffles in Sam’s arms and even tries to shake him off with his wounded leg, but to no avail- the three of them wear the same face of defeat and only Dean was the one still fighting back.
They continue forward as you share your looks of discontent and worry with both Sam and Crowley- the three of you stand together as Castiel leads the way towards another door and into yet another hallway- how many were there? On and on you go as he turns to another corner, another room- and another and another and
“Dean!” Sam pulls my arm out of nowhere and he starts running, his bright smile hides something much deeper but his golden aura makes it hard to see through it.
“Well nice to meet you Jimmy. Call me Cam” she nods gently and occupies herself with her cigarette and her companions once more.
“A BIT?” Sam taunts him in his usual sarcastic tone; Dean looks at him and then Cas, giving half an eye roll in the process. They tried to deafen out the tiresome scenario in any Winchester way possible , because Cas was about to snap.
“I’m… going to go get some… stuff, for the journey” he walks away robotically, as if something was caught between his legs, all jittery and confused. Sam and Crowley watch him walk away towards the store.
“…are someone who possesses so much good within yourself that you end up breaking apart from time to time” Castiel kisses his cheek slowly and continues doing it without any restraint “There’s no shame in being broken Dean. You are much more than your parents’ concocted idea of you. You are more than just Sam’s older brother...you’re more than the words you use to bring yourself down and you’re so much more than what your failures define you…you’re
Maybe I shouldn't open it, I thought. Maybe he'll think I'm not here and just leave, that'll do the trick, it wasn't my first time.
“All we’re saying is…” Sam spoke after him, Bobby turns around- the shock on his face excessive and over the top, just as they had remembered him since they were kids “Dad isn’t really the best example we have, hell we don’t have a lot of examples to begin with. But us Dean? We’re different from the rest, you taught me that. You taught me how important it is to save and hunt and also stay true to ourselves- no matter the hardships we always managed to find a way to overcome it, we always did
Sam twisted the fragile doorknob and pushed the door silently, the hall consisted of some shelves and counters with ancient looking books and flasks on them. Some of the shelves also contained empty bottles of whiskey and old drinking glasses. Sam twitched a the messy sight, the atmosphere of the house smelled very moist and raw, as if the walls absorbed the liquor and rain. To his left there was a small, unused kitchen with just two or three counters and an ancient looking stove, it almost felt like a witch lived here. Sam gulps uneasily and continued to the last room on his left, which he assumed (And hoped) Crowley was in. He pokes his head in through the door, emerging slowly so that he could react accordingly once threatened.
"Ugh. THAT'S WHAT I DID YOU MORON, WHAT ELSE DID I DO?!" He bites back, I loosen my grip on him and let his body slide down, he starts breathing easily, there was a sign of a little annoyance in his body language, taking a deep breath I look at him and his stance softens.
A short muscular man wearing a chic yet old looking indigo coat shouted as he kept power walking in the other direction, a skinny man-probably in his twenties- ran towards him with his fists in the air in complete distress and rage. Sam hid behind the tree he laid his back on but he wasn’t fully confident whether it was able to cover him completely.
"Cas? What the hell are you doing? Don't run off- aaaand he's-" he spoke, as fucking patronizingly as he could as he sought after him. He saw his agile body go deeper into the cemetery, getting harder and harder to keep up. Dean was already out of breath as he climbed the steep edges to reach him, he felt like he was chasing the terminator for Christ's sake.
It’s completely dark outside; you couldn’t really see what was in the distance, a few run down houses and gas stations maybe? But there was no electricity surging through any of those structures. It felt like they were a submarine floating in the darkest depths of the ocean, Castiel grew worried the longer he stared, how could Sam even see where he was going? He looks up and does see a road going somewhere, he kept exchanging glances from a marked map, just swivels and pencil drawings all spewed about the page. He wished he never asked to stay here, but the longer he forced himself to stay away the more he felt compelled to self-destruct.
The halls seemed so much narrower and unreceptive as you ran through them while Sam followed swiftly, even with your fazed state you managed to lead yourself towards the right path and reach the meet up point.
"I'm not, actually. A friend used to force me into watching these old movies and..." Castiel ponders as he tries recalling the exact moment but he could only see blurs and distorted figures. It made his skin crawl and he clutches onto his chest from the discomfort.
You run towards their bodies as you hear the skull banging on the smooth floor a few feet away. You place your index and middle finger on their necks, their breathing slow in this unknown comatose state. You close your eyes and place your palms on their foreheads and clear their foggy thoughts towards consciousness once more.
The grass is vast as you step throug them, as though buried in the Moors of places unknown. You balance the angel blade against your palm, it slides to and fro inside your sleeve, you realize this act was reckless but you do it anyways.
“After the blast of energy from Castiel Sam woke up almost immediately, as if whatever spell he was under finally broke” Bobby whispers this for some reason, maybe he feels daunted by the thought of it. “I don’t know about you boys but I think we have ourselves a very peculiar chain of events that we need to discuss amongst each other”
Dean could see a vibrant bite mark on Castiel’s neck, constantly pounding and pulsating in front of him. He felt something crack inside of him as he started to shiver by the encounter, he felt himself redden by the abhorring sight and he shuffled onto his feet and rammed himself into Luther’s chest as he distracted himself by his own maniacal laughter. The crowd shuffled back and went mad by the entertainment they were having and Dean kept bashing his head into Luther’s ribs, trying to damage him somehow for all of the bullshit he was spewing. His guards came and grabbed him moments later and Luther was still recovering from his laughing fit “Take him and his boyfriend to one of the cages, I’ll make sure we make good use of the both of them for the long run” He snickered as he licked his lips nonchalantly. Dean was being dragged by a massive hand clutching on his jacket while the other hand dragged Castiel from the back of his collar. Dean felt his eyes burn when he was closer to Castiel and saw the mark on his neck, a colossal guilt began to erupt inside him.
“Hmm” Dean swallows a few warm pieces of meat and, what is that, peas? All in all his throat felt at ease the more he ate.
Dean’s eyes waver at his words, confusion and shock rebelling against each other as his teary eyed stares find the words again
He shoves his hand off from his shoulder and stomps away from the fire pit, the ash rubbing into the soles of his shoes as he walks away. Sam calls out to him but he knows too well that it doesn’t matter what he could say to him- he just needed to let him clear his head for now.
It was that same dream again. Its been the fifth one this week. I was drenched in my own sweat as I woke up, my hair was a mess, no need to comment further. And as usual my alarm failed to cooperate with me. How was it Monday again?
Dean shakes his thoughts away and watches the others commune- his eyes wandering each and every one of them- his shaking hands dug deep in his pockets. The sky is clear above them- everything is as it should be.
"I know that its hard to believe that we were given a second chance, me being here in your arms, touching you, all of this still feels like a dream. But I've learned to accept things just the way they are."
You feel the air in your lungs be filled again, a strange coldness making you slip as you try to grab onto something in the fog-the world blurry and small in the palm of my hands. These legs shiver from the strange cold but still aid me effortlessly no matter how much I wanted to fall again. The world whispered at first but now I see clearly, the trees arching above me and giving me a dark piece of the sky. Something beautiful no doubt
“...And what if we don’t make it? What if one day…we turn against each other and forget everything that felt human about us? About you and I?”
Dean turns his head and pulls Cas’ eyes into his own. Castiel was scared-even if he was fighting the urge to tear himself away from him.
Hey everyone. I've been in Destiel hell for weeks now, I always was but its just been harder to cope somehow these past few weeks. I love writing this fanfic even with all of its flaws but somehow I feel like this is such a bad way to cope- the conspiracies, the constant notifications on tumblr and twitter, it just reminds me of the good old days. I've been rewatching the show and watching all the episodes Cas was in. Ughhhh my heart still melts when I see them, especially Misha. I just hope all of you are okay too, hanging in there like the bad ass you are.
"It cuts off from here..." Castiel distances himself as he felt haunted by Sam's words but it was Dean's reaction that he feared the most, especially because he was silent this whole time. Dean gulps hard and slides his fingers to another page and sees if he's missed any entries ahead. Instead he found pages filled with scribbles and messy drawings, Dean's twitching was very apparent and Castiel was somehow afraid of what might happen next. He looks over his shoulder again and sees the drawings himself, feeling his intestines twist and turn as he kept glaring at the images. At the beginning the drawings were simplistic, just swirls and symbols but then they became more clear, faces appeared in the form of goat skulls and long shadowy claws, figures stretched and filled to the brim.
"But I wanna, I'm not a hard ass." He said, clearly praising himself. We started to walk simultaneously, we took a few steps on the sidewalk and stepped on deliciously crunchy leaves until they were no more. I looked up at Dean and he looked back; I smile at him just to show him that we can do this. Being together was all we ever hoped for, and we would fight to be with one another because we had to.
- why couldn’t you do that?” Dean stares wide eyed and looks away, he bit his lip suspiciously and slowly begins to regain his composure- his rough voice never faltering.
I smile at him and he cradles my face in his hands, his warmth was the best thing that ever happened to me.
Dean started stripping off his jacket which was also severely covered in blood stains, his arms were toned quite nicely regardless of the current lazy condition he was portraying.  He lets out a disgusted groan the moment his eyes caught sight of the excruciatingly large stains. He tore off his t shirt as he groaned with every stretch and pull-Castiel watches him dip his clothes into the river as he tries to scrub the blood out somehow, slowly but gradually we get to see his clothes resonate with the same dull colors once more.
Cas gives off a laugh, the most heartiest one Dean’s heard in a while, even with his veiled anger he couldn’t help but beam by his sound.
“Why do you sound so scared all of a sudden? You know they’re all heretics, and how can you not be? Especially after all of this…”
“…I promised…I’d watch over you. I intend on fulfilling that promise…” Castiel places his hand on Dean’s face and allows his fingers to tickle his cheek and graze the ends of his hair, so gentle they felt upon him, Dean was holding back his tears as he shook his head in disbelief. Castiel grasps onto Sam’s elbow and holds him for a while, his gasps leaving his lips as he smiles melancholy. Sam’s eyes water by his gesture as he twitches and swallows with remorse, they had somehow forgotten the situation for a bit and it filled him with dread to do this now.
“I think we’ll need to find shelter soon, the light seems so be dying out” said Dean as he quickened the lightness in his steps. Castiel placed his hand on his shoulder and looked at Dean’s nervous face with a calm expression and Dean reacted accordingly to it.
Castiel was still horrified and found himself immobile, he honestly considered pretending to faint again.
I hope everyone is enjoying it thus far! I intend on focusing the character development in my work and mostly the relationships they have with one another. I hope you're enjoying it so far and I'll be updating the chapters quite frequently too! There's gonna be a lot of twists in my story and I hope you'll suffer along with it. MWAHAHAHAHAH
Crowley stared at him for some time before he started to walk in the other direction, the boy sniffed as he stared at the ground with his lifeless eyes.
"That..." Dean croaks as he places his hand on Castiel's, the small contact made his temperature flicker, his battered self feeling a little vibrant in this bleak interior.
I sat on my assigned seat in our rambunctious classroom, everyone was already hyped up about the new session, their souls just chatting away as if nothing else mattered in the world. Females acted extra feminine in front of the males, and males acted like typical males; disgusting and ostracizing their own genetics to those who were vulnerable. Humans never ceased to surprise me, that's why I'm glad I wasn't counted as one.
There is a small knock on the door- Bobby enters with a small food tray in his wrinkly hands, he has his hat off and continues to walk in his slow pace towards the bed- he smiles wistfully as he does so and watches Dean from behind- he hasn't turned around to acknowledge him but he remembers his sounds and movements so well that he finds no reason to guess anymore. "I got you some dinner, it's baked potato soup- I spiked it with a special something to take you off the edge a little- God knows how much you've been doing that" He places the tray slowly on the bed and sits down at it edge, Dean's back is closest to him this way and it made him feel guilty for creating such a fucking mess in his house- even after everything he still manages to be this steadfast, calm and conscientious man- something Dean hasn't been for the past few years- maybe even his whole life.
They slam inwards, the cold air swallowing them instantly. The domed room bleeds from the ceiling, the roots swaying and cooing as they descended like treacherous vines. The windows are covered by the same black mass, it's seething like quality spreading the more they looked.
-". The sudden ruffles of the green curtain brought in an ample amount of dirt and pebbles into the dimly lit tent, Castiel squinted as the visitor invaded his space and delayed him from rejoicing. The shadow spoke in a gruff rugged voice as he placed one foot inside the shade.
"Shut up" he scolds himself and walks towards Cas' door, his weapons were wrapped around his waist and pockets with endless holsters. He opens the door and Castiel, lifeless as he was, fell towards Dean and he caught him, why did he feel so much colder?
"I haven't laughed like that in a long time. I didn't think you were the movie watching kind" he fumbles as he stifles a laugh, he was glowing over the compliment and Castiel only rolled his eyes, he wouldn't allow himself to be sucked into his whims again.
You give a small nod, slightly dazed by how unaware you were about your journey but you agree anyways, because you trust him. Sam waves a small brown bag that gives off a warm floury scent
Dean diverts his focus to the road again, for some reason his gut flinches and churns uneasily and he couldn't understand what made him so impatient. He places his foot a little harder on the acceleration and breathes cautiously with the swift vehicle. Castiel turns and watches his movements, the veins in his hands were popping out much more and his usually calm face seemed tense and overwhelmed by something, for a moment Castiel himself felt nauseas just looking at him. The slight wrinkles around his eyes deep and his focus never wavering. Something right out of a movie, but which movie he couldn't put his finger on it.
“I can’t believe you managed to make another sex dungeon Bobby. I’ll admit you have some mad skills” Dean jokes with his usual head nod and idiotic grin, Sam watches him and shakes his head in dismay.
Dean felt tense and even more nauseas than before, he felt his eyes twitch uncontrollably from the images that kept circling in his mind. He bites his lower lip and presses the back of his hand on his eyes, he gasps as quietly as he could-there was no need for this but even so he couldn't control the swelling that choked him.
“Who am I kidding? I have no idea what I’m doing, it seems I’ve forgotten how to talk to people” he smacks his head as he walks away and unzips his bag “I can only talk to cats now, cats, Sam and Dean” he sighs and hears his meows, begging for the treats he got him, his thoughts dissipate again and he forgot what he was saying “You always know even if you’re just hungry. I guess I won’t delay it any longer” Castiel spots a bench towards the northern side of the road and takes it quickly; he ruffles his hair and scratches the itch under his eye as he pulls the items out from the store’s tote bag. Dean bounces out and sits beside him, awaiting his treat as his eyes wander over the pie “I honestly don’t think pie is the best thing for your diet” he laughs as he places a small piece on the bench, Dean happily munches and licks away the cream and crust instantly “Well, at least you got what you wanted” Castiel sighs as he watches the warm sandwich in his hand and feels no urge to feed himself “What is wrong with me?” he murmurs to himself and pulls his eyes away from it. He watches the sun through squinted eyes as he steadies his breathing again, he feels a cool wind tickle his skin and his slightly soggy clothes-he reminded himself that he was due for a change, maybe before they head out again? That would be preferable I suppose. It seemed like they were in the middle of a desert from where they sat, the oat colored sand circling like waves by the wind-it was mesmerizing and depressing at the same time. Castiel looks at his withering shoes, the edges all torn and in dire need to be fixed-maybe even thrown out.
Castiel came to a sudden stop with his slightly twisted foot, the footsteps behind him fade as the stranger pants and speaks more softly. "We had an arrangement...there were some ghouls and...they got to him as he tried to..." he pauses hesitantly but continues when Castiel didn't respond "he said you were the only one who knew how to get to the place where I need to be.
“Well it doesn’t fucking matter what you want, now it’s time for you to step up and fix all of this- I don’t care how and I don’t care when- I expect you to clean the mess you so happily created- if only you could bring back the six years all of us lost!”
“Try me” Castiel’s voice becomes three times deeper; Sam and Dean’s eyes waver with confusion as Dean tries to make eye contact with him as Sam lingers close by, he swallows hard by the heaviness in the air “Cas, is that kind of power even possible?” Dean whispers near him as he pulls on his sleeve, he doesn’t respond.
Dean clicked his tongue as his head continued to pound by the sudden rage building up inside, he nodded and started walking towards his right. Castiel didn’t move for several seconds before he realized the widening distance between them. He held his grey denim jacket close to his body and kept his hand over his chest for some time, he felt a strange cold feeling erupt in his chest and he wanted it to go away somehow. He huddled close behind Dean, he saw him crouch behind one of the broken walls of a local juice shop and Castiel kept following him with his eyes. Dean looked up at him and sighed in response. He shook his head in disappointment and walked over to Castiel and spoke so softly that he had to get in closer to understand.
“Grugh, what the actual hell” Dean coughs, shaking his head, his spiky hair falling sloppily on his forehead, he rubs his eyes and flicks away pieces of concrete from the back to the front, Sam takes a lot longer to get up because his large stature was buried under a myriad of shards and bricks, he was unharmed thankfully, but his blown up chestnut hair could be considered a casualty. “Cas? What is happening? Why is everything destroyed?” Sam juxtaposes as his head twists and turns, making sure he didn’t place his hands on any sharp objects on the shattered floor.
“Don’t. Just…don’t” His tempered voice booms at first until it becomes a whisper “You can’t keep…babying me. I told you I’m fine and that’s it, okay?”
Crowley watches him, slightly drunk as his uncertainty lingered with Sam’s wavering words “You… you actually believe me, don’t you?”
“Already forgotten it” Dean beams and kisses the top of his head, his hand pulls him in the more they lost themselves in the box-the cat watches them from afar, his eyes black from all of the adrenaline surging through his little cat brain from all the objects he was tempted to chase. There wasn’t much inside the box and it left a strange hollow gape within them, Castiel wanted to explore a lot more in those photographs, those memories that he kept hidden from everyone else-memories he thought best to remove rather than keep. He hates himself as Dean assembles it all over again, the sound of the padlock loud in his ears. Dean could sense his stiffness and pulls him into a warm embrace, Castiel is taken aback by his grip over his own toned body-a spectacle itself really but nothing compared to Dean’s. How could he even compare at this point?
“Dean, Cas let’s just sit down and talk about this okay? Dean is just angry about, well… things. And there’s a lot to process here- especially the fact that you were able to resurrect not one but maybe a lot more. What’s concerning is-”
Silence ensues between them, their stares are constant- resonating the same energy and grief into each other but, still so separate.
I looked at my wrist watch and glared at the damn thing until my eyes got it's focus right. 12:00 pm. It was Saturday.
“Here’s your surprise!” Luther exclaimed as his minion came back, dragging something along with him.
“That still doesn’t justify you leaving me behind, and with a note? Damn it Sam the things I’ve gone through to get to you”
Dean's hand start to slide up my back, tickling it gently. And within moments his hand is in my hair; soothing my scalp, feeling him this close I start to cry, I hide my face in his shoulder just so I could hide my face from the embarrassment.
“Arthur’s got the keys to the truck but we shouldn’t be planning our escape without a proper plan! We need to act fast before the demon comes here!” The husky voiced man erupted again.
couldn’t be. I emanate a stifled cry and fall to my knees on the open road-I felt the hurt all over again, it peels my skin and dries the veins that can’t bleed anymore. An angel who’s lost their way again-it’s all quite poetic isn’t it? Like Icarus falling to the sea…his wings all charred and useless-
The monster’s morphed finger nail gently lifted your head and placed it sideways so you could look to the ground, on the ground where they lay.
Castiel stared in awe even after realizing that he should look away. His silence was actually starting to petrify Dean, his eyes glistening by his concern, the green pools dimmed as he stared back. He widened his eyes and smacked his lips as he drew himself closer to Castiel.
Dean licks his lips and supports his slouched body by placing his hand on his knee “I am fucking fantastic. Perfect. Amazing. Never been better”
“Well, let’s narrow this riddle down and then look for a map? Either way we’ll need a map for this” Crowley rolls his eyes as he bends down, his head hovering above Cas’ “Unless our cosmic GPS here might have a different approach”
You bite your lip and cock the gun, a loud clack inundated around you as the monster stared- it had no nervousness in its tone, no insidious remarks other than the things it just did- things unknown to you.
. All this time I thought…I thought I failed you and I was too late to save you and that I…I had lost my
“Dean?!” Sam yells and waits for an answer as he looks at the contents inside the bag-who the hell buys so much?! So he did bring a cat home! “Dean?” Sam leaves the bags and starts marching towards his room-he had so much he wanted to get off of his chest and he couldn’t contain it any longer. All these months of searching had led him nowhere and he needed all the help he could get, maybe he had an idea that didn’t drag him out and make him waste the precious hours of the day.
Castiel's eyes start shifting over his hands, they exist and then they didn't. It was a confusing sight to behold, the bone just clawing it's way out from his skin. It shifts to Dean and then to his hands again and for some reason he couldn't understand what he was trying to remember just a few moments ago. His fingers feel twitchy from the inside and he rubs his hands to lessen the resentment somehow.
“No fucking way” he mutters as he jogs towards it, his hands didn’t hesitate as he wiped the soot like texture off the glass screen. An old and small record player sits lazily inside it, the list of songs a bit blurry to him but still legible. Dean cups his eyes and pushes the buttons that flip the song sheets but to his dismay the old thing wasn’t working “Why did I even think this would work?” he talks to himself with a disappointed head nod. He steps away from its auburn texture and dusts his hands again, but this time more slowly.
“Can you just…” Dean holds back an exasperated sigh, his eyes shut as he got his point across “… Never mind, let’s just forget I said anything” Dean says this but still doesn’t look away while Castiel does, his gulps weak and hard in his throat. Dean senses this from him, he always has- even after all these years nothing has changed between them, or is he holding onto the past?
“Cas, I never asked you for any of this, I never asked you to mourn me, to depend…” Dean moves in closer as he holds him by his shoulders, so stiff and lifeless they felt in his trembling hands
“Heh. Whale in the sky” Sam muses with a smirk. The sky’s inky texture held a few dim orbs of light within them- all 14 perfectly placed above them- as if it hadn’t cracked itself open a few years ago.
the urge to not give up even if I don’t want to-because the people around me refuse to give up on a lost cause like me” Dean scratches his chin and rubs the remnants off his face. His one leg stretches out while one is upright and bent from the knee, his arms rock him a bit as he diverts his gaze upwards and then looks back at Castiel, the impact his beauty had on him was something unknown until this point “But you…heh…you just thought better and bailed on me when you got the chance. Not giving a damn about how it would affect Sam…how it would affect…
He bobs his head a little as he says this “I never planned on staying this long either, so I can never really say I’ve thought it all out” Castiel grins awkwardly as he stares at his shoes and rubs the soles into the ground hazily.
His solicited looks were starting to dig into him, Dean kept shaking his head; hoping that he would change his mind somehow- but nothing moved him.
His confusion is clear in his eyes and parted lips, he turns with no hesitation in his movements and seeks for the source- oddly enough he felt like he knew where it was coming from and the thought kind of worried him. He sees a dim glow from the glass screen of the jukebox, at first the static sounds were distorted and unpleasant to the ears but it regulated within a few seconds- Dean keeps staring at it with his wide eyes- watching how the cards started to flip on their own, he gets close enough to see a small record be switched over and replaced by another, the clicking sounds seemed so ancient to him the longer he tried to process any of this.
After a few minutes of their heated passion they pull away, Cas falls to his left and they stare at each other for a while, the soft glimmer in both of their eyes reflecting the same drunken and dazed adoration they felt for one another. Castiel was the first to break eye contact because he got distracted by something near the top of his head. His eyes widened at the sight as he raised his voice “DEAN!”
“Sam what the hell are you doing?” Dean sidelines through the doorway, evading Bobby and his large belly blocking his way “Can you at least tell me what you plan on doing?” Sam walks over to Dean’s abandoned bedroom, he shoves his bed sheets and cushions around the room- frantically tossing his items and his hair at everything he sees. At long last something laying in the corner catches his eyes and he darts towards it, his grimace never left his face, Dean was struggling to understand his motives, worryingly so. Sam’s elbow twists and his right hand clutches on something burnt on a large black string- they both look at it and clench their jaws in unison, Bobby stands at the doorway behind Dean staring in awe.
“What?” Dean takes a step back and turns the other way, he didn’t want him to see the hurt in his stale eyes.
It had been a week since the incident occurred between Dean and I, my mind was already faltering in my current state. I poured myself another cup of coffee, visually it looked as if it was brewed moments ago, but it had been cold for quite some time now. My clumsy yet buzzed body dragged itself to the nest, or foxhole you might say. The afternoon glimmer was slowly fading away making my room look even more miserable, I sighed and crept up to my bedding and sheets. Taking a sip I place the cup on my nightstand and curl up into my blanket, covering myself from my head to my toes. Hot breaths were accumulating within it, and I felt nothing but peace inside it.
You smile at the memory, remembering the eyes and lips that pulled you in before everything slipped away. It wasn’t out of happiness but from something else entirely-the familiar ache rising again.
“We’re wasting time this way- juh-just wrap it up and lets go” Dean heaves lethargically the more you try to neutralize the damage “Are you kidding me? Pulling that thing out was already a bad idea- so let me do this, okay Dean?” you are stern with your tone as you pour the alcohol over his wound- a strange sizzling and bubbling erupting within the wound itself. The bleeding lessens as you dress it neatly- a tight knot there and a dab there until you feel satisfied with the result “Will you be able to stand?” you straighten yourself up and extend your arm out if Dean required it, he bites his lip as he shuffles and stands upon his stable leg and slowly places the damaged one on the ground and winces instantly by the pain. You watch him cautiously and let him try again, this time he does stand upon it but with a limp.
He sees him. Complete and real underneath the moonlight, his clothes and hair disheveled perfectly upon his sculpted face and body. Completely out of breath and eyes wide at the sight
Castiel wants to laugh at the absurdity of it all but somehow his eyes always ended up on Dean, or his frozen silhouette more like.
“….Never mind, I think I just hit my head a little when I woke up” Dean scratches the back of his head uncomfortably- something he’s been doing a lot these days.
Dean patiently listened as he drew nearer towards the counter and placed his hand on it for support “Luckily after dragging you for several hours I grew the distance between the gun shots and I found this place just in time. The house clearly looked new and I hoped that the appliances were functional too and luckily I found this! I fiddled with some of the wiring on this stove and made it work and don’t ask me how I did it because I just ended up hurting myself more for this luxury” Castiel chuckled as he spun the spoon around, Dean could smell some spices and vegetables in the pot and he drooled over the thought of what it might be
“I never…I never meant to take that moment away from you…I was just so…stupid, Dean. I can never forgive myself for what I did to ruin your life…
“Cas…it’s okay. He didn’t ruin anything” Dean pulls the box towards him and inspects everything inside it; all were just as he had left them. Castiel cozies up to Dean and places his head on his shoulder as he looks inside the box “Is it okay for me to-? I can close my eyes” Castiel speaks and actually does close his eyes-Dean wants to kiss the cuteness off of him before he could burst “Don’t close your eyes! You can look at it. Sam’s clearly messed with it so…here-I’ll show you” Dean rubs his chin lovingly into Cas’ scalp as he pulls out a few photographs. He showed him his childhood photograph, a child with his bowl cut hair style and a young Mary Winchester, it was folded from the edges but he kept it well. He slides another one into Cas’ hand, this one was of Dean, Sam and Bobby-his aura the same as any bulldog he’s never come across.
They're surrounded by the same blackness from before, but in closer view it sent a vile chill down their spine.
“It does. It always did. But it’s not that…I…” Castiel chokes on his words but he continues to weakly “All of this is confusing, difficult and…frail-how can we keep something like this alive? How can we stay alive long enough to see it through? Does it not terrify you?”
“Is that really how you saw me? That I was going to bring you to ruin? That I was going to tear you apart?”
“I did everything that I thought was right, that I thought would save you and Sam- that would be good for everyone. But my powers… it was a serious lapse of my judgment and I never wanted this to happen-”
“The amulet…” Sam resumed as he sat uncomfortably on the sofa, Crowley crouched as he smacked his lips as he sat down in his arm chair, Sam looks at him, mixed with fear and confusion and waiting for Crowley to continue.
The room was very much similar to Castiel's, stucco and wooden panels all around with the exception of a large window, it was covered by thick maroon curtains and only a trickle of grey light entered the room. Dean sat beside it on uncomfortable wooden seat, his bandaged arms were crossed over his toned chest. His face looks worn out and his eyelashes bobbed with every stale twitch.
“Luther, was it?” Dean replied as he twitched momentarily while he made himself somewhat comfortable on the ground, Luther pushed himself off of his throne and gave out a hearty laugh. He took a few steps towards Dean, laughing as he did and threw him off with a jolting kick to his shoulder. Dean fell to the ground, slightly paralyzed by the sudden contact and coughed uncontrollably as he hit his head on the dry floor, the crowd went nuts and hooted and hollered from the back.
“How can you say that? He mumbles to himself “How can you keep saying shit like that and act like a dick even more!” He shouts while he wipes the sweat off his forehead. He follows him back to where Sam and Bobby were and saw him saying his goodbyes
“Dean- you’re practically my own boy- all of you. Even your Castiel, I’ve seen the way he looks at you, he can’t help himself from helping you- and you know why. You can deny it all you want but we know what’s going on inside you even if you will never admit it. And we’re not asking you, all we’re asking you is don’t let what John  thought of you be your only guiding light. That man did what he wanted because he could never let go, even after he had gotten what he wanted; and we all know that didn’t end well for anyone. I don’t want the same fate for you too- alone and wasted and bloody somewhere in a ditch when his own god damn family is worried sick about him, using whatever coping methods he has to shield himself away from everything and everyone.”
Sam rolls his eyes at Crowley’s unusually flirty tone “I’m only calling you because I saw your texts, did you really have no one else to bother even after everything?”
“You know who should’ve been fucking wiped off the map long ago? So that he could give his brother a fighting chance out there? So that he could actually let the people he cares about have a fucking life outside of this shit that I choose to lead and face every day? You think it’s easy for someone like me to…”
The ground erupts and breaks apart, pieces of the road fall towards them and leaves scratches and dents almost everywhere. They float a few feet above the ground, the panic in their eyes and throats shut off completely as the shattered ground pulls them in completely. Dean covers his face with his arms as he hears Castiel shout from within, he jumps towards Sam's body and covers him completely. That was the last thing he saw before the suffocation took over them completely.
“Cas?” Sam conjectures in a hushed tone with his neck slightly twisted, Castiel can only see half of his face in this dim lighting “I know…I know if you think badly of us but there’s something we’ve been meaning to ask you for quite a while”
