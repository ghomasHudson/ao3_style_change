Dean, and not because he should, not only because it's the right thing, but because Dean wants him to, and Dean is
what Cas missed, not what he can do, not the things they've done together. Just him. And Dean finds himself thinking that he missed Cas, too. You can't really miss what you're not even aware of, but he does anyway. He misses the time they can't get back.
Dean's shoe abruptly collides into his under the table. Castiel snaps his gaze up, his eyes narrowing. He's apparently damned to being kicked now. Wonderful. Marvelous. He turns away, ripping at his garlic bread with possibly too much vigor. Dean kicks him again, his boot heavy and harsh. He does it once more, then once again, and Castiel snatches his leg back further, sure that there will be a bruise.
"Okay." Dean swallows and nods. "So, we fight to keep it, all of us. That's what we do, and we'll do it again. I swear we will."
"It's—it's—" Dean opens his mouth and closes it, searching for some kind of response that will let Cas off the hook. But
Sometimes it's not just pinning your own unknown values on another person. Something it's like something inside you that you don't know yet  is trying desperately to get out. So, when you give advice, maybe it's something you need to hear."
"It's interesting to examine how humans approached it with what information they had." Castiel narrows his eyes. It isn't actually something he's terribly interested in, but it doesn't require all of his focus when reading, seeing as he knows the material already. He can be distracted by Dean and read this book. "Give it back."
The thought is like a zap down his spine, calling on some old kind of instinct that he's never truly lost, dusting off the grit-your-teeth-and-bear-it kind of sacrifice—the kind he does, not because he wants to, but because he has to. It's a conundrum, this
Benny has a thing about necks, which is funny because he's a vampire. Excusing that minor detail, though, he has a thing for necks that have nothing to do with the blood flowing in them, and Dean would know firsthand. You'll find yourself doing the wildest shit in Purgatory, Dean has learned, including letting a goddamn vampire attack your neck in a way that's more fun than harmful.
"I'm gonna start calling you Casanova," Dean says weakly when he drops his hands and picks up his head to stare at Castiel a little helplessly.
Dean wonders what he thinks when looking at the flower. He's pretty sure Cas doesn't talk to it like it's a real thing, like it represents someone, but maybe he genuinely thinks of it as the flower it is. Dean can almost imagine his internal monologue.
The ninth thing that happens is that Castiel comes clean, and Dean never knew he was hiding anything at all, but that's how it usually goes, isn't it?
"Yeah, we did. We got the answer." Dean takes a deep breath and lets it out. "You're good, Jack, and what you did was give us another person to call family, to care about."
There's still much to do, Dean is sure, because there always is. He doesn't really care. The kid and Sam are dropped off at the Bunker, and Dean doesn't get out when they do. Sam turns back, waiting, and Dean puts Baby in reverse and doesn't look back.
Cas is back when Dean gets out, and he's put away his food, too. Dean doesn't have to look to know that he didn't finish it. Is he hungry? Is he used to being hungry? Dean's gone hungry before, he knows what that feels like, and he doesn't want Cas to have to suffer through that. He almost opens his mouth to ask Cas to eat, beg him if he has to, but then he can't force himself to do it. He dreads what comment he'd get as a rebuttal and where it might lead.
you're jealous? If you don't, lemme tell you why," Dean says with a soft laugh. "It usually comes from not wanting to think about someone being with anyone else. You don't want me to be with anyone else. Anyone else but
Dean spits, ripping his hands away from the pillow to slice one through the air, jabbing a finger at Sam. "You don't know shit about this, Sam!"
"Well, you're up now. We're just stealing away the child of divinity for a little while. Couple of days, at least. A week, at most. Don't worry, we'll return him in the same condition we got him," Claire says.
Castiel stares down at the space between his shoes, the knot in his chest getting more and more restricting by the second. "I
Zoey watches him fumble for words, then snorts and signals for more drinks. "Oh, baby, you're a real softie, aren't you? Come on, let's drink."
"Because I'll just—I don't know. I'll make you think of all the ways in which you are good, and beautiful, and worthy. I'll make you list them and come up with new things every day," Castiel warns, knowing that's a bigger threat than if he said he was going to give Dean a bruise every day of his life.
Before Cas can respond, Dean's tugged away by Sam calling him. He walks around, talking to him for a little while, narrating his day. Apparently, Sam and Eileen are off to handle a case in Virginia, and since she's driving, he thought he'd see what Dean was up to. He seems to find the fact that Dean's just lazily walking around a flea market with Cas absolutely hilarious and also delightful.
The conversation ends when Cas marches out of the room, slamming the door so loud that it echoes through the room. Dean ducks his head, pressing his fist against the table. His throat is sore and achy, thick with hurt. Grief burrows in his chest.
because Cas is gone—and it's true. Hell, even Jack. What was it that Jack said? Dean's still making mistakes, and he has been, hasn't he? Jesus.
Castiel presses his lips into a thin line and leaves, going to take a shower, trying not to let the mystery of it get to him. He pushes it away, focusing on the shower itself. This is another human experience that he enjoys—the hot water feels good, the chance to be clean, and by his own hands, is a wonderful thing. He refuses to feel as if he's intruding when using Sam and Dean's things, their shampoo and body wash. If they don't like his presence, then they can take that up with—quite literally—God.
"I'm not opposed. You're more than welcome to join me," Castiel tells him, arching an eyebrow. Truly, Dean has no idea just how true those words are. It only angers him further, just how deeply he wants exactly what Dean cannot and will not give him, especially when Dean continues to mock him for it.
When Cas breaks away, slow about it, Dean's breath stutters over his lips. He doesn't open his eyes until he's sure that Cas has dropped his hand and leaned back, too afraid to see him so close. With the space between them, Dean's eyes slowly blink open, and he stares at Cas with parted lips, stunned stupid by a fucking kiss.
"I've got him," Dean snaps, his words coming out harsh and cutting, steady despite how unbalanced he feels currently.
things, then life ain't so bad. We got Jack back, and that's a win, right? We're on our way to complete freedom. Cas is
"Hello, Dean," Cas rumbles—that familiar drag of his voice, a growl threaded through every word, even when he speaks gently.
"Uh, yeah, sure. So—so, we're leaving now?" Dean darts his gaze to Cas helplessly. "We aren't going to, uh, wait around for a few hours, maybe?"
Cas just hums. "Possibly. He has a lot of habits that I've decided to blame on your influence. His most annoying traits, generally."
Dean gasps out a deep breath, eyes rolling around underneath his eyelids. His hands scramble at Cas' belt, no finesse to it. They're not going to make it to getting fully undressed. Cas seems to share this sentiment because he's yanking at Dean's belt—one Michael put on him, the fucker—and doing a much better job at getting it open than Dean is with his.
Dean scowls and snatches it from Sam's grip, immediately elbowing him in the chest hard enough to make him wheeze, then whipping around and marching out of his room. He prowls through the hall, pissed off and pent up, and he whips around with a glare when he hears Sam laughing behind him. Sam just grins and goes into his room, shutting the door, leaving Dean to keep marching on.
"Yes," Cas agrees roughly—everything he says is rough. Dean's known the guy since getting out of Hell—or known him as much as anyone can really know him, which ain't much—and the voice is still a little insane every time he hears it.
So, now, here Cas stands, explaining something that Dean didn't want to actually acknowledge. And there's panic clawing on the inside of his chest because there are tears forming in Cas' eyes. There are things being said that they've never said before.
who is just sitting hunched against a tree, staring at him with slightly wide eyes. Dean's breath punches out of him as he lowers the gun, everything relaxing in him all at once. He nearly cries again.
"Pretty fresh," Sorine comments idly. "I'd tell you that it gets easier by the year mark, but I'd be lying. So far, it's the same as the very first day, like it just happened. Like it keeps happening over and over."
wanting to be anywhere else than around him, he sticks around because he doesn't have much of a choice. It's cheap, a mockery of what Dean wants out of him and won't dare ask for.
"It is, mostly. I keep making revisions and adding stuff as more ideas come to me. The bulk of it is handled, though. Eileen looked it over, said it looked good. Would you, uh…?" Sam looks at him hopefully, just like he used to when he was a little kid, wanting Dean to look over his homework—not because he was scared it wasn't right, but because he wanted Dean's approval. It makes Dean's heart clench.
It doesn't help that Dean has this constant nagging feeling that something bad might happen to Cas. After spending time believing Asmodeus was Cas, Dean kicks himself for a long time afterwards, feeling that he should have
The windmill creaks a little, turning and turning. Dean follows it with his head, smiling slightly as he tilts along with it. It's a Cas thing, cocking your head like that to the side. That far. He can picture it perfectly in his memory.
A bee bobs into a flower, bumping against it a little stupidly. How it flies, Dean will never know, and yet it does. The damn thing doesn't seem to know what it's doing, but it still gets it done, somehow. Insane how that works. Cas liked bees. Maybe he related to them, or maybe he just liked honey.
Cas' lips twitch. "Nothing such as that, not in those terms. He did, however, wake up every demon, reaper, and angel in the Empty at once."
The bee thing again. Castiel rolls his eyes, but he doesn't see the harm in helping clean up. It's only fair. Standing next to Dean at the sink invites close proximity that Castiel feels prickle over his skin. The knot in his chest jerks viciously, but he ignores it. He isn't doing anything wrong.
He knows it's stupid. They're fighting, two sharp edges cutting into each other when they can't and won't agree on this. Cas is in too far with the kid, and Dean doesn't like it any more than he does, but it has to be done. It's
He stares down at the flower with half-lidded eyes, careful not to disturb it, even in his inebriated state. There's been some wild swinging between crying and just staring blankly, and fortunately for him, he's in the middle of doing the latter when Sam pokes his head into the room.
Castiel immediately pivots and heads into his room, because he doesn't know how he's supposed to look Dean in the face after he just said something that ridiculous, all without punching him. There's no way. He doesn't think he can pull it off.
The first week rolls into the second, and it doesn't change that much. Dean mows the lawn. On Sunday, he goes with Cas to get groceries again, chuckling when people at the farmer's market comment on him coming back. He learns how to fix the wiring for the fan in their room, so Cas doesn't have to struggle with it anymore. He fucks it up bad enough that the fan doesn't work at all one night, and Cas genuinely doesn't get a wink of sleep, so Dean stays up with him in solidarity. He has it fixed by the next night, and despite his exhaustion, Cas looks like he wants to kiss him again.
Sam's jaw goes tight, gaze darting between Dean and Castiel, and maybe he is no longer a safe alternative. That remains to be seen. "Okay, what the hell is going on? There's obviously something wrong between you two."
When he gets home, he's worked himself up into a pretty big panic. He comes barreling in and tosses his bag on the table, just as Cas is coming into the room. "Hey!" he calls out.
"Let me go, Cas," Dean snaps, which gets him no results. Cas—the rebellious little fucker—just seems to wrap around him tighter. Dean goes limp in the bed, blowing out an explosive breath. After a beat, he tries a different tactic. He brushes his fingers over Cas' arm, and his voice goes soft. "Hey, pal, you with me? You hearin' me?"
Castiel narrows his eyes at him. Dean has always been very ridiculous in certain moments, but this is starting to get annoying. "Why would I ever do that?"
"You're not upset," Cas notes, scanning his face like his reaction is a marvel. He sounds...reverent.
Dean marvels at the fact that just some odd hours ago, he wasn't aching to break back into life after dying, but now he's already looking forward to tomorrow. To be fair, tomorrow has the promise of cowboy-related things, so who can blame him?
Like this, Cas is the first to win the battle against the complicated pants. A strategist, indeed. He's patient, surprisingly enough, all while somehow being impatient about it. Peeling Dean out of his jeans—and subsequently his underwear—while he's sitting down turns out
that?" Sam whines—an actual, pained whine—and lifts his head to stare at Dean despairingly, eyes wide. "Dean, come
The problem is, Dean doesn't know how to explain it to himself without...seeing it for what it is. And it's pretty obvious what the fuck it is. He grew up in the eighties. This isn't something he can just vault over every time it threatens to cross his mind, except that's exactly what he's doing. He'll keep doing it, too, because not doing it is worse.
"Whatever you're about to say, Dean, just don't," Castiel warns, the knot in his chest seeming to tighten in anticipation.
The moment he sees Dean, his eyes fly open wide, his mouth falls open a little, parted around a small huff of shock, and he looks so goddamn stunned to see Dean at his door.
That draws Dean up short, admittedly. He hesitates for a brief second, turning his gaze to the water. Cas could just fly out, right? He's an angel. What's a little drowning to him, in the grand scheme of things, if he even can drown? Dean wavers in place, heart thumping in his chest. He doesn't know Cas, not really, but he saved Dean's life. He's done it a couple of times by now, actually. That's literally the very first thing he ever did as an introduction—save Dean Winchester.
"I know. Dean, I know," Sorine whispers, hesitating only a moment longer before she scoots closer and wraps both arms around him. She doesn't say anything else, doesn't try to lie and say it's okay again, doesn't do anything but let him cry it out.
Sam takes a deep breath, then slowly lets it out. "You're not the only one who lost people, Dean. I lost them, too. Jack lost them, too. He didn't even get them. And I—I know now that it's different for you when it comes to Cas, but I've
Dean's body doesn't relax, but his eyes light up yet again. "Right, because you have a lot of things you'd rather be doing than sleeping." He grins, gesturing to his own body and waggling his eyebrows, seemingly smug. "Namely me, obviously."
Jack's already in the kitchen, standing at the stove, and he whirls around the moment that the door swings open. His cheeks are puffed out, no less than four bacon strips stuffed in his mouth, some of it sticking out. He's frozen for a second, then his eyes land on Dean and bulge. He starts frantically chewing, then swallows quickly.
"Fair enough," Sorine says. "Levina and I used to get high, and she was—well, she was a flirty stoner. She'd put her hand up my shirt, like she had a right to it. She'd get all over me, and I'd let her because… Anyway, the next morning, I'd catch her looking at me, ya know? Really,
"The Empty had invaded Heaven and wanted Jack, so I offered it myself in exchange. The—the price was my life, but there was a catch." Cas drags his hands down the sides of Dean's neck, resting on top of his shoulders. "When I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned, and it would take me forever."
"I'm glad you're alright, Dean," Cas tells him, once he's dressed again. He moves towards the door, pausing only to turn and take him in for a long moment. He opens his mouth like he wants to say something, then closes it and swallows. He gives a nod. "You should get some rest. Goodnight."
Eileen proceeds to send him a long stream of messages listing various embarrassing moments in Dean's life, courtesy of Sam. All of it predates Castiel, which is nice. He likes knowing things about Dean that he wasn't present for, and it's not often that Dean will share them.
With the prodding, Shawn takes them to the stables. He tries to talk to Castiel the whole way there, and Castiel doesn't seem to mind that at all, but Sam shoulders his way in between them and takes control of the conversation. Castiel doesn't seem to mind that either, simply letting Sam do it.
of being angry, and he doesn't know how to stop, but he just doesn't want to do it anymore. He doesn't want to keep watching Cas walk away. He doesn't want to keep fighting and placing blame where it shouldn't even be. He doesn't want to be wrong, but he was. He
Cas not only wins the battle, but he wins the war while he's at it. He finishes what Dean started, getting out of his own pants, which is great because Dean was
It's stilted between them. Uncomfortable. Castiel despises it. He misses Dean fiercely, and Dean is sitting right across from him. Is this all they can be now? Castiel doesn't regret doing what he did to save Dean's life, but he sincerely wishes there had been any other way. He'd been happy to die with the assurance he wouldn't have to lose Dean. It's a relief that did not last. Castiel feels as if he's watching Dean slip right through his fingers, and there's absolutely nothing that he can do to stop it.
He has just a moment to puzzle over this before Claire is marching right up to him, drawing her fist back, and punching him right in the face.
"I'm tired," Cas announces abruptly, heaving a sigh and snapping the laptop shut. "Was the dishwasher still running?"
Dean's lips curl up. "Yeah? She's got the right idea, then. Who the fuck wants to be normal anyway?"
"Wouldn't you like to know?" Dean grins when Cas yanks on him again, pinning him more forcefully against the counter. It's not even six in the morning. He couldn't care less. "Why's it matter so much, huh? Didn't take you for a possessive bastard."
"Death wish!" Dean calls out to him, flinging his hand out and turning around, shaking his head as he starts towards Cas, who is standing very rigid and still glaring. "Hey, Cas, look, it's not—ah!"
it, the catch of teeth, the supple density of chapped lips above his own, and it's the motion, the slow drag of tongues, and he's gone.
Dean thinks muzzily, still just slumped against the tree, sticky in places he doesn't want to be and twitching in the afterglow.
Sam stares at him incredulously, jerking back in his chair. He blurts out, "Dean, what the hell are you—dude, have you been
Dean grunts when he finally collides into something. There's a rattle behind Dean's shoulder, making them both break apart for a second, blinking at each other. Dean cranes his head, then finds himself laughing a little ridiculously.
Dean nods, bracing his hands down on the counter and looking down at his feet as he mumbles, "We should do it more often."
Dean hums. "A vacation couldn't hurt. We could all go. You, me, Cas, the kid. Eileen, too. Shit, even Jody and the girls if they wanna tag along. Have a beach weekend or something, ya know? Toes in the sand, listen to waves crash together, eat lobster. Sounds pretty damn good, doesn't it?"
Sorine chuckles weakly. "Yeah. She knew, though. Her mom died a little after she was born with the same thing, and she told me at the end that she knew she'd go the same way. Somehow, she knew."
Castiel listens. He does not interrupt once. He can't. His jaw feels wired shut, teeth clamped together so hard that they're grinding. With each word, falling faster and faster from Jack's lips, Castiel feels a fury unlike any other swelling within him.
Dean makes an odd, distant noise that's small and quiet, his head wrenching back as he starts unraveling from where he folded in close, and Castiel follows him up. He just—forgoes common sense and follows, standing up at the same time that Dean stops bending down, raising up at the same pace, keeping them that close. Dean nearly knocks over the second chair to start backing up, but he also doesn't really seem to know where to go, his eyes wide in a way that makes Castiel want to just—
Cas chuckles, low and warm, then reaches out to grab his hand, tugging on him. "Come here. Relax. We have time, Dean. We have
"The Winchester Way, as many put it. You would think that the various enemies you accumulated over the years would have no interest in seeing anyone affiliated with you and Sam win anything, but a surprising amount seemed amused that you two not only continued in the same vein of stupid as they knew you, but also passed down the tradition to a younger generation," Cas tells him.
He does it again. The look on his face. He looks cracked open, his eyes so glazed that he seems inebriated. His chest stutters under Castiel's hands, and the breath that falls from his mouth is so faint and thready that it's barely audible. It comes out in a small croak, like his throat is dry or thick, or both.
Dean retorts, reaching out to lightly shove him in the shoulder, scowling at him. "Which you're not allowed to do again, by the way. I forbid it. No more, Cas."
"Very," Cas murmurs, his gaze fixed on Dean's mouth in a very obvious way. There's so much want slapped onto his face that Dean considers breaking shit in the house just to fix it. He wonders what Cas would do if replaced a door or something.
"Was that weird? That was weird," Dean mutters as he shuffles over to the bed. He sits down on the end, his back to Cas.
Dean's head spins, because he didn't really think this far ahead, and he doesn't—he doesn't know what to
Castiel trusts that Dean would stop him in whatever way necessary if he needed to. But this—he's outright asking Castiel to silence the storm in his mind, and if he's absolutely sure, Castiel will do his best. He genuinely can't refuse Dean anything, but this only works if Dean is sure.
It's the same as with the fingers, but on a border scale. Bigger, for a lack of better term. Because, well, Cas' dick is bigger, so Dean's mouth is fuller, and this somehow correlates as better to Dean's brain. He's not aware of the ache in his legs, or the strain in his knees, or the twinge in his back. He actually
him how he felt about Anna, and Dean weaponized that knowledge. They've hurt each other before, but never like this, and Castiel can't fathom how Dean can just...do it that simply. It's wrong, and it comes from a place of anger, except Castiel doesn't know what Dean's even angry about. And, still, Castiel loves him, loves him, never wants to stop loving him so.
"Hey, Cas," Dean blurts out as Castiel heads for the door. When he turns back, Dean offers him a slightly lopsided smile. "Thanks for coming to get me. And for bringing Baby. And for...taking care of me."
Dean tells Cas things he never did while he was alive. He kicks himself for it, for never saying them while he had the chance. Even the simplest things.
It's the jacket Dean had on display in his room. The handprint is gone entirely, no traces of it at all. Castiel smooths his thumb along the fabric, the knot in his chest seeming to roll up with endless string, getting heavier and bigger. It makes him feel cramped on the inside, like the knot is shifting up to put a lump in his throat.
Dean still sees Cas in his dreams. He thinks about him too much, what he's doing, where he's at, if he's okay. He wants Cas to be here, and he wants Cas to never come back, and he wants them to have sex so rough that Dean is sore for days afterwards. Helplessly, he still wants Cas in all the ways he shouldn't, and he
"Oh, yeah, for sure," Dean continues, dragging his gaze down the line of Cas' neck. "He had this thing about biting, funnily enough. It's ironic, 'cause he was a vampire. Anyway, he
Dean can still feel Cas trembling slightly when he reaches out and hauls him closer, kissing him hard and fast. Cas drops their softening dicks, one hand sliding down the length of the side of Dean's thigh. He squeezes it, gripping hard, and then he gently trails his nails back and forth. The kiss turns lazy, sated, sweet. Dean's humming into it, pleased.
A few minutes later, Sorine is walking back over to offer him a beer. She drinks out of a can, because she apparently has no decency or taste. She makes a comment about his car, and he spends the next twenty minutes leading her around Baby, rambling on about her. Sorine doesn't seem to have much knowledge or opinion on cars, but she claims that Baby looks nice and—when Dean cranks her up to show off her growl—sounds nice, too.
Castiel glances at him, amused. He has admitted that he finds it endearing when Dean calls it this. He just considers it him being open and honest about his love for Dean Winchester, all with the added bonus of making him blush. Dean, however, can't really get enough of it. When they're alone, wrapped up together in their own safe bubble, Dean usually can work up the courage to ask for it.
They do spend the next hour going over the basic rundown for car maintenance, and it's a little painful how much Kaia just flat out
Dean's suddenly angry at Cas, specifically, rather than just in general. It all comes to a focal point, zeroing in on Cas. He's not Dean's friend. He's not even fucking human. He's the angel who was willing to betray him, the angel who went behind his back with Sam, the angel who thinks Dean is gonna give a fuck if there are centuries ahead of them. He's the angel who thinks he can stop him, and one who will make good on his threats, Dean knows for sure.
Like Dean, he enjoys the finger in his ass plenty. So much so, in fact, that he asks for it deeper. Then asks for another. Then a third, even, his face and chest flushed, eyes hazy, legs spread. He looks so damn good that Dean groans just staring at him.
"If—if—if you keep doing that," Dean stutters out, his fingers clenching the sheets, "I'm going to—"
"Dean, Cas is—" Sam's eyebrows furrow, and he frowns behind a swallow of his beer, no doubt gathering his thoughts and figuring out how to say what he wants to. He smacks his lips after, looking dissatisfied. "Just the way he
"No," Sam says, like he's trying to remind Dean not to believe it so easily, like he's struggling not to hope for the same damn thing. "You're dead."
Small warning for Canon Temporary Character Death...again. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Also, you may be worried Dean will Do The Thing, but rest assured, Dean will not Do The Thing.
When he has no choice but to rise up and shift around to get the rest of his clothes off, he braces himself, fully prepared to just fucking choke himself to get it done—maybe looking forward to it—but Cas relents. He slips his fingers out to the tips again, and Dean takes the silent cue to fuck his mouth onto them as he moves. Cas moves
They're both bloody, though Cas is more beaten than Dean. That doesn't seem to matter. He hardly seem to care. He kisses Dean deeply, with intent, releasing a soft sigh into it like he would stand here and be drenched in blood just for this.
The way that those words hit Dean can't be described. It leaves him speechless, face going slack as Cas begins to talk, to explain. Dean finds himself looking over at his brother to make sure that he actually did come back to life after all. Yeah, Sam's alive, and so is Dean, and so, apparently, is Cas.
They've fought. Of course they've fought, but Dean had known, deep down, that he would forgive Cas. He always does. He'd even known, less deep, that Cas would forgive him. They always find ways to soften the sharpest edges of each other.
"If you're sure," Castiel says, staring into his eyes, searching them. There's no fear, just a swirl of desire and anticipation that rocks between the good kind and the bad kind. He can't seem to figure out if he's looking forward to it, or if he should be running in the opposite direction, and Castiel supposes that's what he's meant to be stopping.
Things get harder and more fast-paced after that. His dad comes back at one point, and the whole world falls out of whack. Dean finds himself thankful that Cas isn't around—or, not
He's not out here judging Dean's vast and various escapades, including the ones with questionable characters. No, he's just...jealous. Well, would ya look at that? Dean clears his throat and cocks his head. "Yeah, we had fun, Cas. Me and Lee, we always got along like a house on fire. He was a pretty charming fella."
And so, Dean shakily gets out of bed, stuffing himself in his hoodie on the way out the door. There's a chill in the Bunker, and it's only worse at night. The hoodie helps, and he flops the sleeves as he walks, just because he can and Sam isn't around to tease him for it.
Cas chuckles warmly, pressing his thumb into the corner of Dean's mouth, his eyes brightening when Dean's breath catches. "You're the one who said that love is like this, so I imagine so. I can't foresee myself loving you any less than I do at this moment, only more. Can you?"
"Right, of course," Cas says, and a small smile plays at the corner of his lips like he can't hide it.
that Sam is gone. Sam is safe, and Sam is gone, and Castiel feels ridiculously betrayed all over again.
There ya go, simple. Doesn't mean a damn thing unless he acknowledges that it does, and Dean's most definitely not doing that. So, this is what it is. A mixtape, a gift, not a big deal.
for Dean. He has for years, but it was hidden before, or as hidden as he could make it. Now, it has seen the light of day, and it has no intentions of receding to the dark once more. Castiel did let the sun shine on his face, and for all that he feared it happening, he never prepared himself for the loneliness that would cling to him in the aftermath.
Dean leans back on Bobby's couch, staring off into space in front of him. Bobby and Sam have already slipped off to bed, muttering goodnight under their breath, not looking at the warding against angels and not looking Dean in the eye, either.
When Benny pulls back, he glances over Dean's shoulder, and he chuckles. "Hot-wings doesn't look very happy right now."
Dean pretty much likes it instantly, which is weird because he's really in no state to be forming opinions about anything. He's idling at the turn-off that will lead him to park right next to Cas' truck, and he's so stiff that it's a wonder he's not a goddamn statue; he's doing a fair impression of one.
Dean chokes out a laugh. "Dude, I hate to tell you this, but I'm wound so tight I'm pretty sure I'm gonna lose it in, like, five minutes. If that."
Cas says more urgently, a thread of alarm slipping into his tone. He steps forward, finally looking at him, and he's immediately reaching out.
There's nothing. There's no one. Dean swallows and thinks, his mind racing, eyes flicking back and forth like the foliage will open up and spit out answers. Or, better yet, spit out
when it's fighting to fix something that he fucked up. But he's not gonna blame Cas for feeling differently. He doesn't like it, and something in him withers because of it. That isn't Cas, not really. He always tries to do what's best; it's just that, now, he's convinced he only makes things worse. It's like Dean said, they're all cursed, and even if Cas is
of all things, when he's quite sure he's definitely not that. But the way Cas had said it, like it's inarguable, like it's a simple
Castiel turns that over in his mind, curious about it. He thinks about Dean's response to Castiel slamming him against various surfaces, the way he just—gives into it. He thought it was a defense mechanism, and perhaps it can be, but there is a chance that it's just… Well, maybe Dean simply enjoys not having to decide whether he wants something or not before sensation takes over for him. At least in some cases.
Dean flicks his gaze over Cas before he can stop himself, considering it a little more seriously than he has so far. He'd told himself that it wasn't attraction, that it didn't have to be more, but at the same time…
Castiel shakes his head slightly, though she can't see it. "Nothing would stick, as you say. I won't move on. He is, quite literally, everything to me."
Dean feels like he's just swallowed acid, recalling what he always used to ask it before. He can't ask that again. Cas does know; he died knowing. He died
"He's…" Dean pretty much gives up instantly, shrugging and tipping his head back. He can feel Lee staring at him, no doubt adjusting to the news. He's the first person alive who knows about this, and the realization is daunting.
"Okay, okay, enough," Dean blurts out, dropping his face into the curl of Castiel's shoulder, heated skin against heated skin. He closes his eyes, breathing around the flare of warmth tucked under his ribs, making his heart expand. "Cas."
"Yeah, sure. I mean, the song comes from a place of loss, you know? But it's...sort of intimate, which is kind of weird. It's weird that millions of people have heard something that only me and one other person will really understand, but I guess we all go through things that make us connect with different songs, so I'm glad that a lot of people have."
He did not. He has never wanted this for Jack. Not this young boy who deserves far better. After all that he has been through, even from the moment of his birth; after all that he has done, all that he has given. It is wrong. Castiel will not stand by and allow Jack to go through it alone, not if he can help it.
"It's the dishes, isn't it?" Dean asks, squeezing Cas' wrist. He knows already. "We didn't rinse 'em off."
Dean stares at her for a long time, not really understanding what the hell is happening. "Why would you do that?"
there's this kinda hot alien chick with these—well, they're not tentacles, but I like to think they are. Anyway, she can
"That's—wanting to have sex with you wasn't the point," Cas snaps. "Yes, it was the implication, but the problem isn't that I want to have sex with you. I am perfectly capable of coexisting with you in spite of that desire.
But it's different like this. It really shouldn't surprise him. He remembers how he didn't talk after his mom died.
"Kid, I got at least twenty years on you. That's never going to work. Besides, I'm not...a good best friend."
unrelated again, if you've ever had your parents divorce when you were really young and you couldn't understand why they weren't together and you were aware that they wanted to be together and you acted out because things were different etc etc, then you know exactly what jack's going through rn. or, close to it, at least.
It's urgent again, a little frantic. Dean wonders if that's ever going to stop, if how much they want to touch will ever soften. The sappiest parts of himself are looking forward to having so much of it that they learn to take it with leisure, even take it for granted, a sure thing that they don't have to worry about not having. He shies away from those sappy parts for now, though. It's too soon. They still have to talk.
Honestly, Dean doesn't think he's felt as powerful as he does for that first moment where he's cranking his mouth down Cas' length slowly, going as far as he can, watching in real time as Cas' expression all but falls apart, shattering around pleasure. Dean's almost convinced that giving a blowjob is better than getting one, and he has no idea what that says about him as a person, but this is fucking
He didn't ask for any of this. Jack brought him from the Empty and deposited him here. Jack made him human. This life, this permanence—it is not his fault, and he cannot be blamed for it.
Castiel scowls and whips the covers back, irritated that he has to be awake now. He would much rather be asleep. That had been—objectively—the best thing that's happened to him since getting back.
again, nothing to seriously warn for in this chapter, i don't think. mild inebriation, maybe. people being extra dumb. clutch your pearls now, fellow humans and various others, because dean can and will get more ridiculous! 😃
Dean hangs back and listens with half an ear, mostly distracted with glaring at Shawn's pink-stitched boots through narrowed eyes. Objectively, they're very nice boots—clearly broken in, well-worn, and while the pink is a surprise (and clearly a statement), it's actually quite nice. On Shawn, however, they're very stupid and Dean does not like them.
He's still doing it when he hears Dean's boots stomp up the hall, pausing at his door. Castiel's eyes snap open, and he drops his forearm, holding his breath and holding still and holding a full-blown staring contest with the door. He waits for Dean's steps to continue on, but they don't. He waits for Dean to barge in and see something he won't like, but he doesn't. He waits. Dean eventually walks away.
Which, ya know, that's fine. It's not like Dean's not happy. He could do with more, but as long as he doesn't have less than exactly this, he's perfectly content. It's just that, if Cas
that Castiel can't quite get past it. He's trying to come up with some counter-argument because this isn't how it works, because he knew and has always known that this would never happen. He didn't even allow himself to hope for it. This can't be right—a trick somewhere, or another Anna situation, perhaps. But no. Just
Dean chuckles, sitting his coffee down on the counter and spreading his arms wide. "Well, I got some extra sleep, had a really good dream, then woke up with the sun. Nothing to be upset about."
to handle this properly before he overflows. He feels like a corked bottle about to shatter under the pressure.
"That's—very rebellious of you," Castiel says haltingly, his voice strained. He swallows and looks at Dean's lips again. "It's very attractive."
"Cas," Claire mocks, and he can't see her, but he knows she's rolling her eyes. "It wasn't that hard to put it together, you know. Jack told me about the deal, and I thought—hey, what would make that sad sack really happy? Had a good, little think on it. By little, I mean it took me less than a minute to figure it out. How's being gay going for you?"
old, not yet, and he's reacting accordingly to Cas kissing him like a drowning man coming up for air and shoving him back against the counter with no hesitation whatsoever.
"Then stop being a fucking idiot," Dean snaps back, jabbing a finger towards him. "Your plan? Your stupid fucking
There's not a lot of ash to gather. What remains of Cas' has already started to be swept away by the wind, traveling far and wide. Cas always did like to fly, Dean thinks. He'd like that he still gets to do it.
"You're not going to be a dick to him, are you? C'mon, Sammy, don't be like that. You're his friend, too."
rips free from Dean's mouth before he even knows it's crawling up his throat. All bitterness seeps out of him in a second, replaced with dread and just a touch of fear.
moments that always slip right out of his fingers because he lets them. He doesn't try to hold onto them, and neither does Cas, and maybe they shouldn't.
He's in such a steady mood that he has absolutely no issue with just barging into Dean's room, practically daring him to say something unacceptable. It's a dare that goes unanswered because Dean is not in his room at all, and the jacket with the handprint has been removed from the chair. Castiel narrows his eyes at the empty space, wondering.
"I kinda do, though." Dean grimaces and looks down at the floor. "Part of the reason Jack thinks that way about himself is because of me. I wasn't—I said some things to him and around him that…" He clenches his jaw and looks up, forcing himself to meet Cas' eyes. "I was wrong about him. I tried, but I didn't treat him right, not like I should've."
Castiel had hoped that admitting to Dean that his feelings are pointless and that he's aware of that would make Dean back off and stop with the mockery. It does not. In fact, if anything, it somehow seems to get worse.
which is already enough of a struggle and a general bad time? Sure, Dean is a looker, and he's good in bed, but anything more? He's not someone anyone would want to saddle themselves with, not if they actually knew him,
Sam stares at him with wide eyes, and Dean snaps his laptop shut, pushing to his feet to march away. He regrets it pretty much immediately, because Sam has only just started to come around after killing Rowena. Dean almost had him convinced for a while that things were okay—eating a lot, cracking jokes, steering away from any talk involving Cas. He's been doing good. He's been
Dean looks up in surprise when his door eases open. Cas. Well, this is going to be good. He usually knocks. Sighing, Dean sits aside his laptop and swings his legs over the side of the bed, pushing to his feet. He always has an absurd urge to stand whenever Cas enters a room, even if he has no fucking clue why.
"I'll be extra careful, and it's not—a lot of it is just reading, you know. Studying. It's kind of like a subject of its own. I honestly think there should or could be classes for this kind of stuff. I mean, dude, there's a whole history that goes into it and—"
"Um. Well." Dean shifts, his fingers flexing at his sides. His heart gets an uptick in speed, and just that small reaction eases that pull to Amara, just like that. Just that easily.
"I loved her, regardless of those things, and that's what this is about, right?" Sam holds his gaze, not backing down. "That's—that's what you meant when you said he was…"
And then he's just the one doing the kissing at all, his hands coming forward to grip Dean's hips and yank him in, his head tilting just so, giving the room to fully fuck Dean's mind up good and proper.
"Then—ah, what's the term?" Cas grits out, his hips rocking down on Dean's hand. His chest heaves and he chokes, "Dean,
"Well, that's just too damn bad, Cas. Fucking newsflash, that's just how life works sometimes! Shit happens, and then you've gotta deal with it!"
Dean holds onto Cas afterwards, arms around his shoulders, hands tangled in his hair. He closes his eyes and pants, feeling like the aftermath of an explosion—shaky and dazed, the world coming back into focus after shifting underfoot. He lets his temple rest against Cas', slowly calming, feeling sated for one blissful moment.
There's a notable shift, and fingers are wrapping around his arm, squeezing tight around his leather jacket. Everything feels different and—dry. Dean risks peeking one eye open and immediately sees the sun shining, Cas' expressionless face right across from his, a little too close for it to be normal. Dean's breath leaves him in one desperate exhale, and he shuffles back to press his hand to his sternum, his heart racing wildly in his aching chest.
I mean, yeah, he's a little weird and quirky, but he's funny as fuck. He won't roll over for anyone, and he
An hour later, as promised, Dean's slicing the heads off a couple of Leviathans, and there's nothing for him to really think about. Pure silence in his mind. The benefits of Purgatory.
it was for them. They only had an almost, for what that was worth. Neither of them could take what they wanted, not without losing each other. All those times Dean ached because he was so in love, and Cas was suffering in the same way. Dean was so
"Whatever you need, Jack," Castiel murmurs. He turns, heading for the refrigerator again, opening it and peering inside curiously.
"Yeah," Dean agrees glumly. "You said you know about this sort of thing. Your best friend fall in love with you too, or something?"
Dean kinda wants to crawl in a hole and never resurface, but for some reason, he doesn't think Cas would help with that. He coughs. "Yeah, uh, sure."
and it hurts, but it feels good, and Dean can't think straight for shit. Literally as well as figuratively.
"Would I fucking do that? Get a fucking clue, man. I think I'm kinda obsessed with the idea of us having sex. It's
He's just standing there, looking a little tired and grumpy, his hair a mess and a spot of dried toothpaste at the corner of his mouth. It's a little strange to see him out of his trenchcoat getup, especially when that's what Dean saw him in last. Instead, he's just wearing a thin, black t-shirt with a hole in the collar and a pair of blue plaid pajamas pants. He looks frighteningly normal and human and kind of—naked, in so few clothes. Dean doesn't think he's ever seen Cas' bare feet before now, and he
And they hadn't talked about anything. They hadn't figured anything out. It was just a tentative thing between them, sex and maybe the hints at more. Dean didn't think that could last forever, but he never considered it would end like this. He'd go back and take that over this any day of the week, and he wouldn't even complain. If that's all he can have, then he's pathetic enough to take it.
"You said he's his own person, that he can do whatever he wants," Sam reminds him. "Who says he won't want to leave one day? The Bunker might not be his forever home, and maybe he'd like to be, uh, away from—well, a lot of things."
do anything like that again, Cas. Do you hear me? Never again," Dean says harshly, his voice cracking as he shuffles closer.
Castiel nods against his pillow, releasing a deep sigh of exhaustion. "Yes. I am...adjusting to the news."
"Oh," Dean says, face going hot in an instant. It really is starting to become a normal thing around Castiel these days. Fucking hell.
"Mhm," Cas confirms, sighing in faint exasperation. He shakes his head. "He's very excitable, especially about the library. He volunteers to read to the children on the weekends. I've been told that he's exceptionally good with them, but I suppose he would be. He is in their age range."
Dean huffs out a quiet laugh. "Okay. Then I love you. I love you, Cas. I'm just stuck loving you all the time, and I'd really appreciate it if you could stick around and let me do that in peace."
Cas hums quietly, his fingers wrapping around Dean's wrist to lift his hand to his mouth, bringing his lips across scars on knuckles, soothing. "I had a very different perspective of that time, admittedly."
Seems like a good idea at the moment, as far as he's concerned, so Dean does. He moves his mouth, completely blindsided when Cas
"Why didn't you fall in love with him, then?" Dean mutters, the weight of his gaze brushing the side of Castiel's face. It feels like a test.
A little desperate, even, but not rushed. Just really, really felt. Dean can feel it all the way through, every catch of teeth and every slow slide of tongue and the soft sensation of their lips moving together. Union hinging on reunion. Dean doesn't want it to end, and if it has to, he wants to immediately do it again. He wants to keep doing it over and over for however long he can.
Then, he clears his throat, grits his teeth, and turns the key. Just gotta do it and get it done. What's happened has already happened, and that's all there is to it. Dean can't change anything now.
Dean's mouth is very dry. He flexes his fingers and clears his throat. "Glasses, too. I wanna see what you look like in glasses. Any kind. All kinds. And maybe different jackets. Leather would be—ah, that would be very…"
Purgatory is freeing in that most of his human obligations are just...gone. He hasn't taken a piss in months and doesn't need to. He's not hungry, or thirsty, even if it's nice to drink from a creek. He gets weary, but not exhausted beyond the ability to function, and snatches of sleep are like gifts—not required, but nice all the same.
the pain in his jaw, and nothing seems as important as how good it feels to kneel here and do this. He's lost to it, his eyes closed, in a trance, simply just...happy, oddly enough. Yeah, he's fucking delighted right now. Relaxed in a way he's never felt before. At this point in time, Dean would be more than okay with just—doing it forever.
"Sometimes, on days like this at sun down, I'll go out to squint at the horizon," Sorine says, pointing out at the sky. "Right there, that thin line between earth and sky, I
Dean lifts his head, blinking slowly. He stares at Cas from up close, stunned. "Are you serious? Just from… You did?"
He gives a harsh yank on the tie, then stills when he sees Cas' head duck, his shoulders jerking a little. "Are you
"Well, if you'd just talk to me, this wouldn't happen," Dean mumbles, his lips turning down at the corners. That unconscious frown seems to almost instantly curl up into an unconscious smile, his eyes bright with humor, his words turning a little playful and mischievous, borderline unfair. "I mean, I get that you'd rather use your mouth for other things when it comes to me, but—"
"C'mon, Cas," Dean mutters, wincing preemptively. He doesn't want to talk about this. He barely talks about it with Sam. He'd prefer to ignore it.
The only option is to push back and find safety in release, because without it, he's sure that things will get infinitely worse. He and Dean have a knack for getting into very serious fights, and Castiel doesn't want to fight about this. He can't. Yet again, he's struck with the thought that he won't be able to win.
"They already know," Jack murmurs. "They're here, outside the kitchen. And you cannot come with me. You know why. It's okay, Castiel."
"Fuck you." Dean huffs out a harsh laugh and shakes his head, tipping his head back and tossing his hand up. "Actually, no,
Dean has to clench his jaw and not blink for a few minutes to dry his eyes out, his fingers tightening around Baby's wheel. He doesn't look back at Cas after that, needing to breathe. He thought it would get easier, but that's the thing. It's so easy that it's like he's drowning in air, too much, lightheaded where it doesn't hurt anymore.
On the ride home, Sam clears his throat. He's been looking at Dean a little oddly ever since that little moment with Tim. Dean hasn't said anything about it. If Sam wants commentary, he's going to have to buck up and bring it up first. Dean's almost curious to see if he will.
Dean takes a small sip of air, his heart hammering away. It's now or never. He scans Cas' face, his eyes, trying to see if Cas has any idea.
cruel. It's not right. If he keeps pushing, Castiel may have to leave, and that's the last thing he wants to do.
what it was—what my true happiness looked like." Cas smiles at him again, a full smile, like there's nothing horrible about this at all. "You. It looked like you, Dean."
"I know you said you didn't love him, but…" Sam tips him a look, eyebrows crinkling together. When Dean looks down at his beer, swallowing, Sam heaves a sigh. "Okay, well, you could—I mean, have you considered...fighting for him, I guess?"
versions of ourselves, Cas. It can't be that farfetched that there's a Dean out there somewhere who would have said yes if you asked."
curious." Lee keeps moving in, but he props up next to Dean against the other sink, eyebrows raised. "Tell me about her."
Cas exhales shakily and walks over, peeling his coats off as he approaches. Dean's too torn up to react to that as he usually would, and he swallows thickly from emotion and not arousal when Cas puts his knee on the bed and swings his other leg across Dean's lap. He dips down, hands framing Dean's face, and he lets a kiss unfurl slowly between them.
He looks like he belongs out here, among nature, a byproduct of earth's most magnificent beauty. It's like he's become roots on his own, breaking soil and planting his feet, blooming before humans and letting a specific few be his sun.
"Good morning," Castiel says roughly as he comes into the kitchen with a scowl, stuffed in Dean's hoodie—and doesn't
"How is she?" Castiel asks, vaguely amused. He wonders if Claire knows that her voice automatically softens when saying Kaia's name, even if the rest of her words are harsh and flippant. It's very...cute.
After a beat, Castiel hugs him back, and it doesn't feel any different than any other hug they've ever shared. It feels the exact same, and Dean doesn't know what that means. Has Castiel loved him through every hug they've ever had? Will he always? The most selfish parts of Dean hope so.
The sun is starting to go down, almost like a reverse sunrise. There's orange and pink and purple bleeding across the sky, a line that shrinks as more time passes, being swallowed by dusk. Dean watches and thinks about the passage of time, about how he'll have eleven months of this, of no Cas, just like Sorine has already of no Levina.
"What? Woah, uh." Dean blinks rapidly, looking as if he just bumped his head a little too hard. "I wasn't asking. I was just telling you that my lines are very thin, dude. More...emotional than physical. But, uh, I'm not gonna say no, because I mean…"
you knew, don't you dare lie—that he was gay before Dad ever found out. You didn't think it was a problem until Dad did."
His hopes that they're finding their rhythm again are promptly dashed when Dean crowds right up next to him at the table in the war room after breakfast. He braces his hands on it, leaning in and down as far as he dares without touching, quite literally breathing down Castiel's neck. He's so close that Castiel can
"Yes," Dean blurts out stupidly, his hands coming up to land on the top of Cas' arms before dragging down. "C'mere. Cas, get down here, Jesus Christ."
Sam has water in here. Dean has beer. He takes a beer before he can stop himself, standing there with the door open as he twists the top off with a hiss that immediately makes him think of Dean all over again, which is counterproductive to helping rid himself of the shame and—and—
Cas lowers his coffee slowly, almost hesitant about it, and he doesn't lean forward. It looks like he wants to, like he's actively straining
Things go from bad to worse, but not before the pretense that things have gotten better. They have located the blossom—that's
Cas steps up to him, his lips twitching. He reaches up to cup Dean's cheek, leaning in and up just a little to kiss him. It's so,
this close. He's so angry, and he's all but begging because he's got this burning hope that Cas will give in, just this once, just for him.
It's nice to hear her peal of laughter when Sam gives her a flat look and tugs her out of the room to, presumably, go do things he can't do in polite company. Dean considers teasing him about it, but Eileen flips him off behind Sam's back, like she can sense it, and so he's too busy snorting on laughter to come up with anything good. Sometimes, Dean's convinced that Sam doesn't even realize how impish and ridiculous his girlfriend is.
There's not a word exchanged between them for the rest of the journey. The Leviathan leading them along keeps throwing awkward looks over his shoulder, far too interested for his own good. Dean wants to shoot him in his stupid fucking face.
"Well…" Dean chews on the inside of his lip for a long moment, a low sense of dread starting to curl in his chest. He doesn't know if he can keep talking about him. He tries anyway. "I made him a mixtape once. He had shitty taste in music, to be clear. Liked pop music. So, I...uh, I educated him properly. Traditionally, I mean. Dunno if he ever listened to it, though. He never got a gift before, so he tried to give it back. Like I said, he was a dork."
Cas snaps, his face scrunching and relaxing in quick succession. He seems to like the feeling of Dean's finger tracing over his right eyebrow.
From there, things only get increasingly worse. When Dean realizes that he can't lie, he's so fucking grateful that Cas isn't around. Besides, with the way things are going right now, he doesn't think his feelings for Cas will come into question anyway. So long as no one brings it up, things are fine.
is what they're doing? Fine. "Well, there's no point in sticking around if we don't have a reason to. Might as well head out now."
It takes grandiose effort to keep flipping through his book, pretending Dean isn't there, that he can't feel him in a way that makes his arm-hair stand on end, goosebumps traveling over skin. It's such a stark, near-alarming human response, but it's also heady. Castiel keeps his head turned down and away, hiding how his eyes flutter shut, how he has to grip his own thigh with his free hand under the table. The knot squirms in his chest, so damn distracted that it doesn't know whether to relax or tighten. Castiel is somehow sure that it's a minor miracle he doesn't snap and just—just—
Dean's eyebrows jerk up despite himself, and she gives a wry grin. He coughs. "Oh, wow, that's… I mean, that was cool of you."
He watches as Cas uses his wet fingers to slick himself up, pumping his hand right in front of Dean's face with no shame. Dean's nails curl into the top of his thighs. His breath hitches in his throat. He's only distantly aware of the tiny ache in his legs and the feeling of their scratchy carpet under his shifting knees. His entire focus is on Cas' dick right now, and he's not even ashamed of it.
"Yes, you did," Dean says knowingly, turning his gaze back to Jack, who's clicking away innocently on his computer, oblivious to the adult conversations. That's for the best. "Sam, all we are—me and Cas, I mean… We're just—we're friends. That's all."
Cas sighs quietly, and his head comes down to rest on Dean's chest, maybe over his heart to listen to it. His hair tickles Dean's nose. "And I take it that this life you want to have feels impossible."
He's been desired before. He's had people want him, people hit on him, people smile at him slow and lazy with naughty thoughts swirling behind their eyes.
Cas snaps up straight, suddenly looking both offended and appalled. "Who said I don't want you? Why would I ever tell you that?"
"Sounds to me like he was pretty sheltered." Sorine pauses, then clicks her tongue. "Hey, what's wrong with pop music? No one hates a whole genre of music. Even if you don't listen to that genre usually, there's always a few songs you end up liking. Or, if you don't like it, you at least connect to it."
"Because it can feel—it can be so good," Dean says, pushing himself to the side. He reaches out, putting his hand on Cas' arm, listening to the hitch in his breath, noting the tingle in his own palm. "When you love someone, they just do something to you, ya know? And there ain't no rhyme or reason for it. It's just them, and how you feel about 'em, and it can suck so bad, but when it feels good...it feels better than anything else."
"Yeah," Dean agrees. "I figured why the hell not, you know? And maybe—I dunno. It's good to get practice in, anyway. By the time we kick the bucket and get upstairs, I wanna be so fucking comfortable and sickening that my dad has a stroke."
He doesn't think he dreamed last night—that leftover angel quirk of his—but apparently his body finds something to do in the absence of what would likely be nightmares. This is certainly preferable, to be fair. It's just that Castiel can't help but wonder what has brought this on.
Any other time, Dean would laugh. He almost does, regardless of the swarm of emotion that assaults him now. Of course Cas did that,
feel better, at least. He sprawls out in bed, only slightly calmer, though he doesn't doubt that Dean will infuriate him again. He ponders this cycle they're stuck in, wondering if there's any solution in sight. He can't find one. Dean's going to just keep pushing him, and pushing him, and pushing him. Eventually, if Castiel doesn't crack first and do something unforgivable, Dean will explode and let it all out.
"I know, Cas. It wasn't just that. I mean, when you were possessed by Lucifer... Dude, I was—there were those who wanted to respect your decision, and I just wasn't having it. I couldn't just—just let you go. You were so
As it turns out, he cares quite a bit. It's a bitch, truth be told. He finds himself standing at his closet door more often than he would like, not having the courage to bring out the flower and ask it the same question that he always does. Is this love? Is it?
Okay, now Castiel is even more confused than he was prior, which is not a feeling he enjoys when it comes to Dean, for all that he deals with it frequently. He doesn't understand what Dean isn't getting about this. Does he just...not want to be okay ever again? Their friendship relies on Castiel's ability to keep himself together and his feelings in check. It always has.
Cas swoops in to pick up the bottle of lube he must have thrown there when Dean was too busy wanting things in his mouth. He waits until Dean is settled before following him down, slotting in between his legs and ducking in to kiss him.
A knock on the door makes him jolt at the stove. He hastily slides the burgers out of the pan, flips the stove off, then darts out of the kitchen. He's not really sure who would be stopping by, outside of Sam and Eileen, or maybe Jack came back early for some reason. The shower isn't running, so Cas must be finished, but he's not out yet, so it's on Dean to answer the door.
when the Empty swallowed you up, you know that? I—I ignored Sam and Jack, gave no fucks about Chuck, and I got blackout drunk. Then Lucifer showed the fuck back up and pretended to be you, and I—Cas, I was… Yes, I'm fucking angry. What did you expect?"
"Well, I ain't got a new skincare routine or anything, if that's what you're hinting at," Dean mumbles, brushing his knuckles in his fingers against one another from where his arms rest on his legs and his hands hang between his knees. "S'just, ya know, getting to rest a little. You should try it, man."
"Goodnight, Dean," Castiel says, smiling to himself as he slips into his room before Dean ever manages to remember how doorknobs work.
"Jesus Christ, Cas, your hand is so cold, what the fuck." Dean's eyebrows furrow, his fingers curling up to hold on, his other hand flying over to cover the back of his hand. He's warm to the touch. A hearth. He starts rubbing Castiel's hand, and it feels so nice. Dangerously nice. "I was just gonna let you hold my hand so you'd feel better, but this thing is like ice."
"I like to talk about her sometimes," Sorine announces at one point, her feet dangling near the exhaust pipe. She swallows harshly enough for it to be audible, and her nails click against the aluminum can between her knees. "Other times, I can't even really—I can barely think about her. I never know what it's going to be. I don't get a choice in the matter, and I don't think a lot of people get that."
"Dean, in what world would you have ever agreed if I did happen to consider it and want it?" Castiel asks pointedly, raising his eyebrows. When Dean snaps his mouth shut, he nods. "Exactly."
Dean feels like he's going to scream if nothing gives. It's driving him up the goddamn wall, and all he wants is the one thing Cas seems dead-set on not giving him. Of all the places to plant his feet and never waver on, why did it have to be this? Why can't Cas give in
"Oh god, yes, oh my fucking god," Dean chokes out, bucking up into it and nearly fucking losing it right then and there. Cas' hand tightens on his wrist, bearing down, and Dean's free hand flies up to grip his shoulder, nails digging in and scratching at his skin without even really meaning to.
make out one of the doors that's open, revealing a flickering light like from a TV. If he strains hard enough, he can hear the quiet sounds of—is that Scooby-Doo? Probably Jack's room, then. All other doors appear to be closed.
"I just wanted to check in," Cas tells him, stuffing his hands in his coat pockets. "I saw that your light was on, so I thought you wouldn't mind me stopping by. You were exceptionally quiet over dinner, which isn't like you at all."
he's going to say it, admittedly. It's likely to be a disaster. He doesn't tell people that he loves them. Usually it's sort of just known, or implied through gestures, but Dean doesn't think he can just talk around this one and maybe make Cas a sandwich he won't even eat. Also, fucking isn't the answer, because they've already done that, which has clarified exactly nothing between them. In fact, Dean thinks the sex might have muddled things even more.
He has no idea what his response would be, not initially, not without all of this hanging over it. He's pretty sure he knows where it would have ended up, though. He clears his throat. "To tell you the truth, I don't have a clue how I would have reacted without all this shit. I do know that I would have eventually come around and got my head out of my ass and realized that I'm kinda stuck with you."
sex, and he opens his mouth to tell her this. Before the ready agreement can leave his lips, however, a thought crosses his mind like a gentle, yet persistent breeze. Just one, just a name:
that suggested they breeze past this. That's the thing about the pesky, persistent turmoil of emotions. They're all over the goddamn place, and despite
Dean's heart does some kind of gravity-defying flip. He nearly clutches his fucking chest, but refrains at the last moment, clenching his fist instead. "I, uh, meant more of an activity, Cas."
"You didn't—" Cas falters, his face softening with genuine concern. "After the Empty took me, you didn't… Dean, did you—"
Vaguely, he thinks that this makes complete sense. Trust him to be able to say this kind of shit when he's angry. It's always anger with him, isn't it?
Dean coughs. "Kinda missed it, actually. Um, these past few months, I mean. The special treatment, because you—well, now I know why. I
"Right?" Dean asks, turning his head to look at him. He feels smug as fuck at the blissed out expression on Cas' face. "Years of wanting it, I guess."
(to clarify, i actually usually hate/don't enjoy miscommunication and this level of dumbassery with my ships, but something about destiel's brand of stupidity gets to me)
Castiel places his hands flat on the counter and bows his head, breathing deep and slow, trying to get a grasp on the swirl of anger, hurt, and rising panic that riots within him. For emotions to be so inherently impactful, they're not at all physical, despite the effects they have, and he cannot wrangle them. His eyes burn. He's thirsty again.
"Oh." Sam slowly closes his mouth, then opens it, then closes it again. He looks more and more confused by the second. Finally, he opens his mouth again to say what he needs to. "But you said—you
"Did—there wasn't a wedding I missed, right?" Sam asks, as if he won't count it out, because who the fuck knows with them? In his defense, their lives are always a little crazy. Or, they used to be.
Despite knowing this, Dean can't help but keep going. When he woke up, the very first thought he had was about Cas—as it often is these days—and with it came the strong compulsion to turn his head and hack up his lungs, intestines, and any goddamn thing in him. He just—he wanted to get all of it
I just think you could use a little lesson in how friendship works. There's not this extra fun subsection where fucking gets thrown into the mix, and I
Castiel has a place with everyone as well. He and Claire have an odd, not-talked-about relationship that belays a deep fondness for one another. Kaia seems nervous around Castiel at times, like she's worried about making a good impression, which is—objectively—hilarious. Castiel and Eileen, of course, get along like a house on fire, both because Castiel knows sign language and because they both have an appreciation for the same types of books.
Dean stares at him, his throat bobbing, and then he blurts out, "Leaving. Don't—don't leave. Don't even fucking talk about leaving."
"Yeah, she's great," Sam says—again with the being besotted. There's no hope for him. Eileen's got him wrapped all around her finger.
It's not, and personally, Castiel is having a marvelous time. He thinks he'd like to do this every day for however long he can get away with. Just this is enough. Less than this was enough, so really, this is exceeding his expectations—mostly because he didn't actually have any to begin with.
"Would you look at that?" Dean taunts. "Looks like we were doing it backwards all this time. If only you'd
working that stupid trenchcoat off. He'd burn it if he didn't remember what it was like watching it burn.
"He should have taken me with him," Castiel says harshly, the words escaping him as angry as he feels. It's true. It would have been so much better.
He doesn't think he's going to get a wink of sleep tonight. He should have apologized. He should tell Cas that he's proud of him. He can't tell him about the fact that angels can't get back into Heaven. There's so much to say, and so much he can't say, and Dean doesn't know how to say anything at all.
Well, as it turns out, it's kinda great. Dean doesn't think he's got the stones to admit it out loud, but it's mostly perfect. The only downside is that Sam isn't here, which just feels
"Dean," Cas rumbles, a rough sound, just his name and somehow a moan that's towards the growly end of the spectrum. It makes a shiver roll through Dean's body, his breath hitching in his throat.
Turns out, the kid might have found a case. Well, it sounds like some bullshit grave-robbery, but Dean is in rallying support because of the
"That's what I was asking," Castiel reiterates, frowning at Shawn. He tilts his head, and Shawn's lips part around a sigh. A dreamy one. "Is it safe to ride the horses if they're possessed?"
"Actually, I'm helping her with a case. Her and Kaia, more accurately," Jack says cheerfully. "She asked if I would like to, and I said yes. I like Claire a lot. Kaia is wonderful, too. They're my friends."
"I was curious," Cas admits, lips curling up as Dean leans away from him. "There were a few times that I had my suspicions."
"Mm." Castiel looks at him with a small smile, amused and still so unbearably fond, and yet so tired as well. "It would be worth it."
Dutifully scraping the hair off his face is the one thing he allows himself, the one thing that feels like his most human act. It sometimes leaves his face a little raw and sensitive, but he doesn't mind. When he finishes up now, he moves over to the creek to crouch down and wet his hands, wiping them on his face to soothe his skin.
"Jesus. Yeah, okay, let's pretend that never happened. Moving along." Claire huffs out a harsh breath, sounding genuinely disgusted. "Bad news incoming. Brace yourself. The thing is, Dean's kinda the worst in a lot of ways, so no matter what his feelings are, you probably won't find 'em out. He probably doesn't even know, in his defense. I mean, he's still the worst, but the whole gay thing is a struggle on its own without trying to figure out if you're gay for an angel, ya know?"
"Shut up," Dean mutters reflexively, biting the inside of his lip again. It's becoming a habit now. The gum is getting a little sensitive. "It's
He's such an asshole, because Dean knows his face does something obvious in response. He can feel his expression going slack with hurt, with preemptive loss, and some heartbreak for what they almost were mixed in as well. He realizes that Cas sees it, and he can't think of one goddamn thing to say to fix it.
However, Eileen isn't alone. Claire and Kaia are here again, and this is slightly surprising. They haven't been back since Claire punched him in the face, but the invitation wasn't closed, so it's fine. They must have just got off another hunt because they're both clutching their coffee like it's their only source of energy. Claire looks very tired. Kaia has her head resting on her shoulder, eyes drooping.
"Well, I can think of one thing more enticing," Cas tells him, his eyes bright with humor, pleased. All his shyness has fled.
Stupidly, it's kind of a relief. Dean much prefers that to Cas not wanting him at all. He'd literally rather Cas want to fuck him than want him to go away. He's not sure what that means, or what that says about him as a person, but there it is. It's as simple as that. And hey, this is even something he's good at. Sex? That's his pièce de résistance.
"Go," Cas murmurs, leaning away to survey him with a much more relaxed expression than he had before. "When you're finished, we'll…"
"You did," Castiel agrees, because he did. He doesn't particularly want to think about it, but he's aware that Dean never did it to hurt him specifically.
work around Castiel's weird, picky eating habits. He has a thing about certain textures, so Dean has to work with what he's got.
miss him, huh? Bad enough to follow him home. Looks like you were the dog in the scenario, after all." Claire's voice is strangled with laughter, not with him, but blatantly
"God, Cas," Dean chokes out when he feels fingers slide into his short hair, knuckles against scalp, fisting it and giving a harsh tug.
So, it's pretty simple. It's a lot simpler than Dean would have thought, considering that Castiel confessed his love and has since made absolutely no moves to hide it. He's not shoving it in Dean's face, but he doesn't shy away from it either.
Cas picks up the pace of his hand, thumb sliding over both of their slits to spread where they're leaking, and Dean sobs helplessly into their kiss. He arches up into it, back coming off the bed, hips jerking a little wildly. Their kiss breaks because they both seem to need to gasp and pant.
stupid. Dean's pissed off about it in a heartbeat. A part of him wants to do it any-fucking-way, because what does it matter, right? This shit with Cas… It's a goddamn mess. It's always going to
of Sam opening his beer, followed by the sound of him taking a swallow. Dean's too tired to open his own at the moment.
All that's left to do after that is drink, which he does. He chuckles ruefully to himself as he goes about making up a flask, because there's no way he can do this sober. "Here we are again, last moments on earth. Cas, if you can hear me, I'd sure like to go out with a bang, man."
he could say. But, for some reason, he doesn't think that would go over well, so he keeps his damn mouth shut and says nothing at all.
Cas' hands slide up Dean's arms, hesitant at first, then in a sudden burst of motion like he can't help it. His hands fit into the curve of Dean's neck and shoulder on both sides, tugging, and Dean goes without a second thought. They come to a halt in a not-quite embrace, their cheeks and temples resting against each other, Dean's hands digging into Cas' arms and Cas' hands sliding back and around like he's seconds away from pushing his fingers through Dean's hair. Friends absolutely do
back, even if he's not here. That gives way to resignation, just sort of kicking at the ground, waiting with a sigh. Eventually, that turns into doubts, little worries that maybe he made it up somehow, or Cas will get stuck in Heaven, or
For one second, Castiel considers doing exactly as Dean suggests, if only to be spiteful, but he would much rather get into the safety of his room to find release that won't change things between him and Dean even more. The frustration spikes hot, slamming into him hard, because Dean just keeps pushing, and pushing, and pushing.
So, sexual release is a...bandaid, at the very least. It's something that can help filter this, acting as debris in a dam to redirect the flow of water. At the moment, it's the only thing he has.
"About...Dodge City?" Cas asks weakly, his gaze darting towards him, then away. Bouncing back and forth, unable to hold still for long.
"We're—together," Dean says, testing it out, and he likes it instantly. He's almost baffled by the genuine delight that squirms in his chest. It feels like a step closer to something solid, something that fear and restraint can't find a place with.
but then I annoyed an ancient cosmic being so much that it sent me back," he says, completely serious.
Castiel's slightly foggy blue eyes slide over to him, lips twitching down. "This is a part of being human, Dean, and I
***if you wanna skip the majority of it, it starts getting pretty heated with, "At some unclear time later, Cas tugs himself away just enough to sit up and start working his shirt over his head." and you can probably stop skimming and scrolling when you get to, "Was that alright?" Cas asks.***
But then Shawn suggests they can stay the night and gives Castiel a very unsubtle look when he does, so Dean's mood only plummets further. Shawn has absolutely no problem making his intentions clear, and this only infuriates Dean more. Fortunately, Sam is the best brother to ever brother because he declines for everyone and insists they need to leave.
Cas is, like, not small. It's a stupid realization, because Dean sort of knew that, deep down, but this is something else. Cas isn't just
Claire coughs around a laugh. "Yeah, that kinda comes with the experience. It's normal. You want the good news or the bad news first?"
When they get back to the Bunker, they all do, in fact, have a nice reunion. They sit down with beers, and Castiel explains how Jack plucked him from the Empty to help reconstruct Heaven. Dean figures that makes sense. As hands-off as the kid wants to be, Castiel was always gonna be his exception. Dean's pretty grateful of that fact, admittedly, and not just because Castiel saved his life. Again.
"I don't—Sam, I don't fucking know! I don't think about this kind of shit." Dean throws himself back into his chair and crosses his arms, scowling. Sam just keeps staring at him, unwilling to let this go, so Dean reaches up to run at his temples. "I guess I would...I dunno. Depends on what you and Eileen are doing. Do you need me to stay? Then I'm staying. Shit, I might stay on principle alone, and I'd ask him to stay, too. 'Cause...I mean, I didn't before, and I think he wanted me to. Are you and Eileen gone, off on your own? I'd probably just go with him, then. No reason
in his chest. He wants this. He wants to make Castiel make those sounds again, wants to lick them out of his mouth, wants to make it so good that Castiel doesn't know who Shawn is, so good that Castiel will never want anyone other than him, so good that Castiel will love him harder, deeper,
"I'll try my best," Cas breathes out, the flower going to the side in his slack fingers as he sways closer, eyes fluttering shut. "I love you very, very much. More than any words in any language can properly express. More than I'll ever be able to say it. I should have said it from the moment I met you and every moment since, but even then, that would not be enough."
"Look at you," Sam murmurs, sitting next to him on the steps of the porch, beaming at him. "You look
Dean blinks slowly, so slowly that it almost counts as closing his eyes for a beat. When he opens his eyes, he stares at Cas some more. That ache that has fled him doesn't so much as return as it spreads out, warm and fluttering, turning soft instead of ripping at him. From a sickly sensation to butterflies. There's a nearly-overwhelming pulse of
They groan into each other's mouths at the same exact time when they finally fucking manage to get each other's pants open, because Dean started in on Cas' the moment after Cas started in on his. The noise of them both, passing the sound of pleasure back and forth, it reverberates in Dean's head. It fills up the silence waiting there, spurring him on.
"Jesus fucking Christ," Dean chokes out, tipping backwards and sliding his hand away from Castiel's leg. He turns around on the stool, facing the bar, his heart racing in his chest, his face hot. "You can't say shit like that, man. I'm gonna—I'm…"
the time. Finally, Cas says he should just start small and see what it will be like, figure it out as he goes, because—in his words—that suits Dean's personality more than just settling on one idea he's not mostly sure about.
"I'm just gonna go use the bathroom, and I'll put some coffee on for you, okay? Then I'll be right back. Sound good?" There's no response, and Dean sighs. "Cas? I'm coming right back."
The next stopping point turns out to be the table, Dean's hip knocking into it until Cas turns him so it presses into his back. By the time they get there, Cas' chest is mercifully bare and Dean has already been freed of his jacket and flannel. His t-shirt remains, but Cas is making quick work of that, too. He breaks away to slip it off and toss it aside carelessly before diving back into the kiss. Dean is currently fighting with Cas' belt and so distracted by everything else that he's sort of losing.
"And why the fuck not?" is not the reply he's expecting, but it doesn't come from Sam anyway; it comes from the doorway, from—
Castiel squints, sharing a look with Sam, who has his eyebrows raised and his lips pursed. When Shawn approaches him, taking off his own hat, he frowns and says, "What are you—"
Claire wrinkles her nose. "I don't wanna know what you two get up to in your free time, thanks. It's gross. It should be illegal for old people to be sexually active in any capacity."
There's a quiet tap, and Castiel looks over to see Dean holding his hand out on the table, wiggling his fingers. "Here, give me your hand."
It's not so bad, really. From his perspective, Castiel has all rights to be cranky. He's not feeling too hot, clearly, and it goes without saying that he no longer has his grace, so he's dealing with that loss on top of everything else. Also, Dean's pretty damn sure that Castiel has never been sick before, so it's probably not a fun introduction when his immune system kicks back online and puts him through hell.
with his grace, and that's probably the hottest thing Dean has ever seen in his life. It's such an absurd thing to think at that moment, but it crosses his mind that Cas isn't human. Dean's fucking someone, yes, but also
When they finally reach a room—Dean's room, by the looks of it—Dean can barely walk straight. He feels a little kiss-drunk, stumbling along, cursing under his breath every time he nearly trips over his own boots. He presses a laugh into Cas' jaw as he fumbles with the door knob, his free hand already getting a headstart on yanking off his coats.
"What are we doing?" Dean mumbles, suddenly unsure. They both tumbled into bed, shirtless, definitely heading in a different direction from where they've apparently ended up.
Perhaps Dean will avoid it. He is very good at doing those things. When faced with something he simply doesn't want to acknowledge, that's his first method of handling the situation, and Castiel is sure that it will go this way again. He is banking on it, in fact.
There are two messages on his phone, unopened and recent. Only a little over a week ago. He sits on the edge of his bed, and he thumbs them open.
Jolting, Dean sits the flower back where he keeps it, then steps back and closes the closet door, whirling around with his heart in his throat. Cas hovers in the doorway, hesitant, eyebrows furrowed.
He would probably suck his dick, if he could force himself, if he thought he'd be any good at it. What's a dick in your mouth, really? What do they even
Shuddering out a deep breath, Dean picks up the latest flower on his nightstand as he sinks down on his bed, twirling it between his fingers. He's past the point of needing to talk to it, or he thought he was, but he learns quickly that there's still some things he doesn't know how to say.
Sam shrugs. "Yeah, sure, why not? What would happen, then? Hypothetically? You gonna ask him not to? Go with him?"
Sorine hums. "People act like talking about her will help, or something. It...doesn't, really. Sometimes it's nice, sometimes it's impossible. People who didn't know about her suddenly want to, and they'll ask me. Half the time, it's like they're asking me to throw up right at their feet."
"Like...at the same time?" Dean asks carefully, glancing at the packaged blanket. It's heavy as fuck, but it's not that
"Not really," Cas mumbles. "If I hadn't left, and I told you this, would this be the same response?"
more so than you. Yes, it was for you, but this shouldn't have affected you. That's not what this was about. I'm sure that you missed me from time to time, as friends do, but you had complete authority on—well, us. When you wanted to talk, you were free to contact me. If you wished to see me, you had the liberty to visit, or request that I visit you."
Dean can't do this today. He can't go out there to the meadow and find Cas where he won't be, not right now. He doesn't want Cas to be gone. He's so fucking
His phone ringing pierces through the quiet of the car, making Sam wake up with a muffled groan. Dean barely spares the phone a glance as he answers it and holds it to his ear. The first thing he hears is the breeze in the background, like a sudden gust of wind has kicked up close to the caller, as if telling Dean hello. That makes Dean's chest ache, and a second later, it feels like his chest splits open.
however, has got a date with the lovely Eileen," Dean says, waggling his eyebrows with a small grin.
He's standing in a patch of sun, in a direct ray of light that casts warmth through his dark hair, drawing out the lighter undertones. His hand is ever so gently cupped around a flower, not plucking it from where it grows, just examining it with a strangely solemn expression. His head is tipped back to stare up at it, because it's placed just a little higher than his head, and the sharpness of his jaw is somehow emphasized by the softness of the flower.
With no warning and with urgency, Dean is suddenly crying very, very hard. He keeps asking himself that question over and over, and it rips at him when he has no solidified answer. It could be anything, and nothing he guesses will ever be confirmed, because Cas isn't here to confirm it.
Dean flops back down on his bed with another groan, covering his very hot face with his hands again. Of course it is his pleasure.
Tabby abruptly sweeps in, placing their plates down on the table between them, making them jerk apart. Castiel doesn't recall them getting that close. "Here you are, boys. Everything looks alright for you guys?"
"It's a color that represents vitality. Life itself. Earth, and all those on it." Cas pauses, his lips parting as he takes a small breath. "You. Your eyes."
"I don't think that's gonna be possible, sorry. Just in reference to you, though. Ya know, knowing what's too far. Where the line is."
"Well, it does when you're gone." Dean hesitantly pushes his fingers through Cas' hair, carding through it slowly. He's never done it like this, without being in the middle of sex, with such reverence. "You gotta be here for it to work. I need you here for it to make any kinda sense."
It's a really nice dinner, all things considered. Dean likes having family here like this, even if he's not going to be the first person to say it out loud. Claire and Kaia in general are just
who says shit like that? Farther away, small and a little broken, there's the ridiculous thought that maybe Castiel will say it again, because he really,
Dean licks his lips, then really wishes he hadn't. He presses them into a thin line, glancing towards his future self, then back to Cas. "Are you and him…?"
Along with many, various other things, Dean still has that famous anger kicking around in his chest. Is he mad? Hell yeah, he's
Slowly, Castiel does. He knows he shouldn't, but he's just—well, he's weak, perhaps. He wants to touch Dean so badly that he's holding his breath in anticipation. He's careful about it, laying his palm over Dean's, loose and unobtrusive.
Things get weird with Cas again, somehow. It becomes so blatant that Sam and Cas leave to go handle a case on their own, and Dean's stomach squirms with an uncomfortable sense of envy. Dear god, he does
It's only after he sends the text and rereads it that he distantly realizes he's missing some key words in there and his grammar (and spelling) has gone to shit. He squints at the screen, then very deliberately fishes his keys out of his pocket and waves them at the bartender, who takes them with a small smile.
Mostly, it's just a heady, powerful thing. Dean's hands are shaking from it, from the realization that Castiel wants him
The shower starts up, and Castiel closes his eyes again, tipping his head back and covering his mouth with his forearm again.
the dude is bulky. He's—well, he's sturdy-looking. He's not some thin, dorky guy being swallowed by a trenchcoat. He's—he looks—
"Jack," Castiel cuts him off. "He claimed he wanted to be hand's off about everything, as...what he is now, with only me as an exception."
It would work out for the best if they didn't know, especially Dean. Actually, Castiel doesn't need to struggle with shame as long as Dean doesn't know. He is not eager to be here, to stay here, if Jack isn't.
"Except you clearly kind of do," Sam tells him, fixing him with a serious look. "I get it, Dean. I really do, okay? You think I didn't catch some of his shit sometimes? He found out I liked Celine Dion and called me Samantha for three days straight. You thought it was a joke, so you started doing it, too. You didn't
Shawn likes it, obviously, because he grins and winks at Castiel before continuing, "Anyway, you wanna help me ride the safe horses across the way? You said you know how, right?"
John Winchester would have wanted to toughen him up, too, would have told him to man up, and it wouldn't have been right. Dean knows that, because he forced himself to never do it, to not regurgitate the shit he had to hear. He stepped back and let Jack be happy, however the fuck he wanted to do it, and there was absolutely
It's a short kiss, chase and simple. It still puts a warm feeling in Dean's chest. Though it's not like it was last night, it's definitely not bad. There's something soft and sweet about it, and Dean doesn't really want it to end.
Castiel doesn't make him, thankfully. Maybe he senses what Dean is trying to do, or maybe he wants it himself, but he takes the metaphorical steering wheel and sets the course. He kisses Dean deep and slow, intimate, hungry but not starving, warm but not scalding. He's so
"So," he starts, ever so originally, "you told Tim that you're taken, and that your husband is dead."
Dean hums into his skin, sounding pleased. "I guess the whole point of giving yourself to somebody, or something—a cause—is to not have to decide what's good and what isn't. You can mistreat me, or not, right? What's the difference? How am I gonna know if I'm just—ya know, off being yours? It's my one job. Easy enough. You figure out the rest, man, I'm so lazy."
Dean's head shakes, and he's looking at Castiel like he's looking at him for the very first time, like he's been looking at him for years. He huffs out a soft laugh and croaks, "Okay, great, so I'm in love with an idiot, too. Wonderful."
"Heya, Cas," Henry says brightly, offering a little wave as Cas comes to a halt beside Dean. "Sorry, I don't mean to drop in on you unannounced, but I wanted to stop by and let you know there's gonna be a storm tonight. We've got some leaning trees far in the back that might give in the wind, so I didn't want you to freak out if you heard 'em falling. Also, we almost always lose power out here, so we've got some candles up the road if you need some."
"That's…" Cas steps closer, clearing his throat. "I would have access to all memories, even those not connected to Michael. You would have to trust me."
Dean exhales and opens his eyes. "Cas was weird. I used to—well, I got a thing for cowboys, so I used to make him watch things with me. Tombstone. Wyatt Earp. Young Guns. Plenty of Clint Eastwood, too. Oh, he'd bitch about it the whole time, but he'd watch it with me anyway. He was way too attached to his coat, and he sucked at staying put anywhere. He liked goddamn emojis. He used to replace words with 'em all in his texts, so it was like trying to work out fucking hieroglyphics sometimes. He'd send one outta that blue for no reason. So stupid."
that it hurts. Everything hurts. It all comes crashing down on him at once, and he covers his face with his hands, hearing himself whimper and whine, tortured with continuing.
and it's doing a helluva lot of damage to Dean's refusal against Sam's claim. He knows he shouldn't, and yet he does, feeling too much and refusing to accept any of it. Why not add more fuel to the fire?
that's probably one of the most selfish things Dean has ever done. What, he's that desperate for someone to actually
And, later, when Cas looks into his eyes and harshly asks, "So, this is goodbye?" that cross gets heavier.
"Gonna start riding around on broomsticks, Sammy? You can't have the one at the Bunker. I already broke that one in. Buy a new one."
Cas considers him for a long moment, then his lips twitch. "No, I suppose it can't." He ducks in unexpectedly and presses a warm, sweet kiss to Dean's lips, a chaste one. When he pulls back, he drops his hand and sighs. "We should be going."
Oh, his brain is really fucking scrambled from this kiss if he's trying to figure out ways to rotate between the two guys that seem to find simple pleasure in nearly coming to blows. Dean doesn't know how to ask them to get along, because it'll just sound like a girl with two boyfriends asking them to take turns, and that's not what Dean wants. Well, okay—no, no, that's not it at all.
"I wanted to break your jaw," Castiel admits in a whisper. "I wanted to kiss you, too, even then. You can't possibly know what I—"
Dean nods and comes to a halt in front of him, trying to figure out what he wants and how to do it all at once. His throat feels dry, leaving him to swallow compulsively. He darts his gaze away, back again, then away once more. The sight of something in the bag snags his attention, making him go still and tilt his head to better examine it.
"What I was going to tell you…" Cas releases a shaky breath and swallows. "When Jack was dying, I—I made a deal to save his life."
The case with Lee puts about four different things into perspective. At least three of them have to do with Cas, ironically enough.
"I can totally say it normally. I'm just choosing not to," Dean tells him in the way that means the exact opposite.
Dean's mouth goes dry. His dreams haven't been particularly pleasant as of late. Just a constant replay of Cas' death, over and over, every single night. He couldn't get any rest without waking up and feeling dead inside. It's a peculiar sensation, but he knows it well. He's been through enough that he should.
He does not apply his metaphorical bandaid in the shower. Not tonight. Not with the hand that Dean held onto.
Well, if he'd known, he would still have done the same to save Dean's life. Or, perhaps, he could have found another way. In that moment, it had felt like such a relief to confess. He meant every word. He has never meant anything more. Now, that confession feels like the metaphorical nail in the coffin of his and Dean's normalcy. They will always be different because of this, never the same, uncomfortably altered. Castiel still cannot force himself to regret it.
into it. It's impossible not to get swept up in Cas' storm, because the bastard is like a whirlwind. He's so fast and efficient about everything he does, getting Dean out of his shirt with ease, licking into Dean's mouth like he's trained for it.
Castiel shoots him an odd look. "Botany is when someone studies plants, Dean. Different from gardening. More...scientific, I suppose."
All that's left to do, as Rowena said, is to watch over Jack and be by his side as he dies. As expected, it has gotten worse the closer it gets. It's so
Dean snorts and evicts him from the lie viciously, because of course he does. "Yeah, no dice, buddy. We both know that's complete bullshit. A for effort, though."
Cas sighs again. "Dean, I understand that you're angry, I do, but it would be helpful to remember that my decision to leave was never because that's what I truly wanted. I have never
"The thing about crime scenes, Cas," Dean murmurs, inching closer to the table, "is that they're busy, but they linger, ya know? Nine times outta ten, the person in charge shows up late anyway. And uh, this crime scene is close, isn't it?"
"Love you?" Cas asks, his voice softening, and Dean manages a very tiny, very stiff nod. "That's like asking why the world's tilted a little. There are countless explanations, but when it comes down to it, some things just are, and we're better off for it. We'd never know the seasons without that tilt, and I'd never know love without you."
too. God, kissing Cas never fucking gets old. Why doesn't he do it more? He always wants to do it more while it's happening, and with good reason. It's unbearably good, a maddening thing, cultivated to drive him up the goddamn wall. All the shit he's been through, and kissing Cas is gonna be the thing that does him in.
Dean turns, then freezes in place. Sorine has worked herself back towards the main part of the meadow that Dean usually goes to, where most of the wreckage didn't reach, thankfully. She's staring down at the empty container—the makeshift urn that still has a small film of ashes clinging to the inside of the glass—and the flowers Dean always leaves next to it seems to tell her all she needs to know. Sorine glances over at him, her throat bobbing as she meets his gaze. He expects pity based on assumptions, but there isn't any.
For a split second, they both slow to a halt, staring at each other when their fingers interlock, far more intimate and—and gentle than Dean's ever been with a man outside of a high stakes sort of situation. All those times he cradled Cas' face were pretty obvious, even for him, he's got to admit. But this is different, somehow. This is something they've never done before, and they both look at each other like they need a second to feel it out, to see if they're okay with it, to see if the other likes it as well. It's almost like two teenagers fumbling through a crush, which is ridiculous as two middle-aged men who have had various forms of sex, but there's also something kind of...sweet about it.
He can make that joke because Cas has not, as of now, been a legitimate pain in his ass. They haven't quite made it there yet, but Dean suspects they eventually will when they have more time. And vise versa, probably. They have not had nearly as much sex as Dean wishes they could. If the world would chill for just
"Just touch me." Cas scoots across the last stretch until they're as pressed together as they're going to get, and he flexes his fingers on Dean's arm, a plea in just that. "Dean, just touch me."
Castiel frowns, reading the two messages again. He wonders who told her. Do they tell her every time he dies, or only when it seems permanent? Every time seems permanent, until it isn't, but this time…
to. He knows that he can't be miserable like this forever, even if it feels like he's always going to be.
of everything around him without even looking. Maybe it's the bulk of his arms, the furrow of his brow, the unfaltering stride that demands all obstacles to get the fuck out of his way before he
Like this, right now—Cas coming into the shooting range just as Dean puts his gun down, the both of them freezing in place for a moment, eyes meeting and getting locked there. Cas looks away first, but it's only to drag his gaze slowly down Dean's body before oh so slowly crawling back up. Dean's heart starts thumping heavily almost instantly, his mouth going dry, tingles starting up under his skin.
"Some," Sam says, shrugging. "I've talked about it with Eileen. She's not—she isn't the type to want to just...throw in the towel and settle down into the apple pie life with approximately two and half children. You know how she is. But...slowing down. She doesn't hate the idea. She likes it, actually."
The tenth thing that happens is that things keep happening, and they always have been, for a very long time. Dean's only just realizing it, but that's sort of how his life works—maybe life in general. Things happen. They do, and do, and do.
"Well, damn." Dean props himself up on his elbow, chewing the inside of his bottom lip to stop himself from grinning. Castiel watches him, curious, and Dean reaches up to slide the pads of his fingers over the warm streak beneath his skin. "I do love you. I think I have for a long time. I also think I've been falling in love with you for years. I'm pretty sure I fall in love with you every day."
Dean's whole world lurches as he's shoved aside, tossed across the room and onto the floor with a harsh exhale. Billie walks in, scythe in hand. Dean forces himself to sit up, his panic setting in deeper, keeping him prisoner as he meets Cas' eyes one more time. Cas smiles at him, then looks forward.
Dean is in control, though. He is, and that's why he wheels around after kneeing Cas in his stomach to toss him across the floor, watching him slide into the pile of books. He heaves a breath, stomping out the urge to go back and finish it, turning away as Cas stumbles to his feet.
"We've been over this," Sam replies, rolling his eyes. He chuckles and swings the beers from his fingers as Dean grabs the wine, already carrying the kool-aid. "Besides, I don't think it's the man part that makes it right. I'm pretty sure it's just Cas."
Cas is shaking his head before Dean has even finished talking. "No, I can't. I'm not doing this with you again, Dean. All we can ever be is
Yes, Castiel would like that. Both or either, it hardly matters. Dean doesn't have to point it out. His nostrils flare, and he snaps his book shut as he slowly turns in his chair, even more furious when Dean's eyes light up with triumph. He's being childish. He's being purposefully awful, and Castiel loves him so much that he can barely stand it. The knot in his chest is starting to squirm again.
His anger evaporates like it was never there, and all his focus sharpens on the way Cas leans in like he can't help it. The anticipation skitters underneath his skin. He's already so fucking hot from anger that he's restless, itching to get Cas against something so they have the space to kiss harsh enough to leave their lips swollen and throbbing. He's so turned out right now, and so
it be an issue. Whatever Sam may think, he's not expecting his little brother to be anything like their dad. He tried his damnedest to make sure that would never happen, and maybe he fucked up in regards to himself—daddy's blunt instrument and all—but Sam turned out
family, but not...like that." Dean flicks his gaze back and forth in front of him, searching for the right words. He can't find them.
Dean is fully aware that a quick kiss is going to lead to some very impulsive, frantic reunion sex that's going to slow down the progress towards handling Michael. He kisses Cas anyway.
Frankly, it pisses him off more often than it doesn't. It makes him grumpy. It makes him ache even more for a life of freedom, because as
Dean doesn't think about it. Not about what it means, not about what it makes them, not about how it affects him. This life—that's not how things work. It's just this, these
"I did it wrong. Sorry, I was trying to, uh, keep it...not that," Dean confesses. "I didn't know it would
Zoey chuckles and raises her hand for another drink, because apparently she has the tolerance of a goddamn brick wall. Dean has cut himself off, so he just watches her drink and teases her a little. He knows she's not in the life, but if she was, he'd like to think that they'd have a lot of fun on hunts together. From what she said, she's traveling through, but if she were local, he'd make the attempt to do this again because she's nice to be around.
"It took a while for me to learn how to use it. I still don't know all the settings, admittedly, but it does come in handy when I have no desire to wash dishes by hand. Jack doesn't like it. He prefers to do it traditionally," Cas murmurs as he puts the glass in the dishwasher, closing it back.
"Hey, I've been in a pretty good mood lately," Dean mutters, raising his eyebrows in challenge as Cas comes to a stop next to him.
"So much," Dean tells him, his fingers wrapped tight around the counter, whole body on tenterhooks and
Dean has just a second to be pleased by the feeling of Castiel's weight against him, and then the kiss itself is changing direction. Castiel dips down, so Dean follows automatically, sort of sure that they're just going to kiss until they die, which is a helluva way to go. He doesn't think he'd mind, honestly.
Castiel's restraint has been hanging by a thread for a long time, if he's honest with himself, but Dean's just tugging on it now. It hurts. It feels so good that Castiel doesn't know what to do.
"No," Castiel admits, shaking his head, thankful to have the right answer to give to this, at least. Or so he thinks.
about it, furious with himself, furious with Castiel for choosing the worst piece of shit in the world. Why?
It's just that he made a mixtape for Vickie Rickfield in middle school because he was macking on her and wanted to sneak off to the janitor's closet before math class. And, well, when he was in tenth grade, he made Loraine Lewis a mixtape of all her favorite songs because he wanted to get past first base. Also, the mixtapes his dad made his mom burned in the fire, but Dean recalls Mary—pregnant and beaming at everything—letting him pick which one they would put on. Dean himself has an attachment to mixtapes—the ones in Baby are proof of that.
He goes through the motions, speaking when spoken to, making sure to keep space between them, distracting himself only a bit with other things. Yet, he is still too aware of Dean. He knows it when Dean approaches him and has to force himself to ignore it. That plan is ripped right from him when Dean rips the book right out of his hands.
Cas doesn't respond, his hand limp against his stomach, his dick equally so against his thigh. He's fully just knocked the fuck out, and Dean chortles to himself as he goes to get a small wash-cloth. He wets it and brings it back, gingerly dragging it over Cas' face, trying to wake him.
"Yeah, we were en route. I waited until I saw this…" Cas reaches into his coat and pulls out a Leviathan blossom that's a little wonky. He waves it around a little wearily, a wry smile playing at the corners of his lips. "It got a little smooshed. Once I had the blossom, I fought. Caught them off guard, and they fought back. I managed to get away."
"I'm not sure if there's anything better," Cas says, lips curling up. "To be loved by you is—is… It makes me very happy."
"Sorry. I thought it had one of those little stoppers, like Bobby used to have." Sam grimaces in apology and follows him into the kitchen. "So, uh, you wanna tell me what that was all about?"
Another sound tries to escape him, and Castiel squeezes his hand over his mouth harder, tightening enough to make his jaw ache. His head tips back, his chest heaving. He can feel the approaching release swell within him, rushing him before he can get his bearings. It's quicker than it has ever been and brought forth from such small amounts of stimulation—just the heel of his hand rocking faster, faster, faster. He clings to the memory of Dean against him, his warmth, his smell, that little breathless
Once, Sam finds a few petals in the crevice of Baby's seat. He makes a joke, no doubt trying to get Dean to crack a smile or loosen up. It has the opposite effect. Dean clams up, stricken, realizing that he's finding Cas in all the places he looks for him, and that's still not enough.
With a scowl, he swings right past Dean with feigned disinterest, pointedly walking around the table. Dean swivels, never leaving his back to him, his eyes still wide. Castiel takes the seat across the table and drags his book back in front of him, his eyes set into slits. Dean stares at him.
Dean considers that, then nods. "Yeah. Does that make me gay? Settling in more comfortably with a man than I ever did a woman?"
he thinks. It's such a miserable, lonely thought that he wants to turn around and leave as soon as he has it. What the hell is he
"Okay," Sam says softly, his throat bobbing as he looks to the side and blinks hard. He nods jerkily at Dean. "I'll spread your ashes where you spread his."
"I don't want to kiss you if you don't want me to, Dean," Castiel says softly. He doesn't. He always wants to kiss Dean, yes, but he has no desire to do it if Dean doesn't feel the same.
He half-ass listens as Cas gets dressed, grunting in thanks when Cas tosses him his pants and underwear. He flops around to tug them on, then settles back down. Jesus, he feels good. Better than good. He feels kinda floaty, like he's drifting off, and he thinks he might actually be half-asleep by the time Cas comes back.
"For as long as he's not looking, he can decide that you've done what you said you would. But, at the same time, he's content with not knowing either way. It's—you know, the cat in the box. Is it dead, is it alive? Is Dean rinsing the dishes, is he lying? It's both or neither, and there's probably something kind of comforting about it," Sam suggests. "If he knows one way or the other, it'll just upset him if it's not the way he wants it. So. Schrodinger's cat."
"Okay, well, uh…" Dean sits his coffee down and nudges Cas with his elbow in the process. "Look, parents—or parental figures—shouldn't have favorites, but they do. They can't help it. I was Bobby's favorite by only a little, but that was because Sam was Dad's favorite by a lot. Mom was complicated, 'cause she never really got to be a mom to us at all. Think about it like Chuck, right? Who was his favorite?"
"Jack," Castiel says, because that's generally a good answer to give people. Short and simple and to the point. No one ever doubts it.
Cas spends another few moments just working his fingers in and out of Dean's mouth, watching the progress of it, likely seeing Dean lose himself to it. And then, slowly, he pulls his fingers out completely. Before Dean can even make a noise of disagreement, Cas leans in and kisses him
The moment he opens the door with no problems, Cas whirls around and squints at him. "You fixed the doorknob."
Dean's in some kind of trance, admittedly, and Cas doesn't look better off. He's just staring down at Dean with the utmost intensity, looking so enraptured that it makes Dean feel good—too good, stupidly good. On the next pass in, Cas curls his thumb a little and presses down on his tongue, trapping it in place, and Dean moans without meaning to. His eyes close halfway, only to snap right back open when the thumb in his mouth pulls free all the way. He sways forward, blinking rapidly, feeling like he's just been smacked down to earth, his mouth feeling
He doesn't care if they stay the exact fucking same, so long as they don't leave each other alone. He doesn't know
"One moment," Cas rasps when he pulls away. Dean's eyes flutter open, only to shut again when Cas thumb drags across his bottom lip. "Lay down."
Castiel smiles at him, amused. "Dean, you already know my feelings. There's nothing for me to hide."
in love with him that it makes him angry like he never imagined he could be. Dean has always made him feel things that he didn't even know were possible, and this does not appear to be an exception.
Dean thinks. They'll get all of this shit figured out, and it will be fine. They'll get Jack and Mary back, they'll kill Lucifer, and then they'll all have time. Dean thinks that's where he'll find the moment, and from there…
"I'm listening," Cas assures him, coming to a halt right in front of him, looking like the most patient man on Earth. For him, waiting comes easy. He's lived so long and gone without so much.
In a way, there's relief in it. He'd been so worried that Dean wouldn't even be able to look at him, and now he's doing it too much.
"I don't think I could pity you more than I do at this moment," Claire says in mock-sympathy. "Dean was your mentor? I'm so sorry."
Sorine's eyebrows jump. "Bullshit. No one? Ever? Bruno Mars? Maroon 5? Taylor Swift?" She pauses when he shifts, then she leans in. "Ah, yeah, Taylor Swift has that effect. This is her world, Dean; we're just living in it."
Castiel watches as Dean abruptly whirls around quickly—too quickly, making him run right into his door. After a day such as today, Castiel finds it to be almost liberating to see Dean do something so mildly embarrassing simply because he's flustered.
"Jack," Dean says, pained. Usually, he ends up letting Jack drive Baby, simply because Jack wants to and because, well, he's never seen someone as excited about his car without looking into a goddamn mirror. He's never let Jack drive her
else, until you are your truest self, bared to me, no longer holding anything back. I think it would be a release for you, but for me… I want to. Is that alright?"
"Oh, right," Shawn mutters, grimacing a little. He coughs and smiles sheepishly. "She's like your kid, isn't she? When I asked why the Winchesters would ever help me, she kinda hinted that you'd insist on it. Something about you feeling obligated to help her out and look after her. I'm guessing you don't wanna hear about the kid you took under your wing being sexually active and stuff. But hey, listen, man, it's really healthy, ya know? It's good that she's comfortable with it, and that you help with that."
Dean's throat visibly bobs up and down. "I don't, uh, actually know? Okay, so maybe I'm being an asshole, too. Fine, whatever. I just want—I just think you should
It's so easy to do this when there are absolutely no thoughts in Dean's head. Everything is raw and real, and every response he gives comes naturally. He grunts when Cas' knee presses down into his thigh too hard. He clutches at Cas' shoulders and runs his hands up into his hair when their dicks catch against each other the first time, both aroused. He makes trapped noises, small whines in the back of his throat, when Cas starts rutting against him with a bit more purpose.
Dean holds up one hand off the wheel in silent surrender. "I'm not, I promise. You do you, Sabrina. No judgement here. Pretty sure your little stumble into Hogwarts doesn't have to end in a big ol' battle now that Dumbledore has been taken out of the picture."
For a long time, Dean sits right there on the floor, staring into space. There is no pain. There is no joy. It's just...empty. Like maybe he got taken, too.
"Thank you, Dean," Cas says, offering him a soft smile, and then he turns and goes to hand out the other drinks to their proper owners.
cursed, he doesn't really give a fuck. It's not always about the winning—you fight because not fighting is wrong, because losing while trying to do the right thing is still better than standing back and doing nothing.
Oh, this again? Castiel knew it was coming. He's in no mood for it. His voice is harsh when he snaps, "The only person here who seems interested in doing so is
This is the kind of thing that can only exist while it's actively happening. It's like object impermanence, not knowing it's real if he can't sense it. Where does it go when it's not happening? Dean wouldn't be able to say. He refuses to look for it.
Dean yanks back immediately, and Castiel looks at him, trying to brave his inner storm. He looks like he's on the verge of a minor breakdown. His eyes are wide again, and unconsciously or not, his fingers have fisted the back of Castiel's shirt like he needs to hold onto something. He's not breathing.
out for this right now, like not getting it would be the end of him. He's so confused about all of it, what this means for them, but he doesn't really care, either. Because his lips brush the corner of Cas', and he's
Cas obliges, falling back into him to kiss him again, and they've got it all figured out now. They're really fucking good at this, as it turns out.
Sam sighs and shifts to sit in front of Dean, crossing his legs like a first-grader, planting his elbows on his knees and his hands together to rest over his mouth. He nods to the flower. "What's that?"
Castiel thinks Dean's being a little ridiculous about this. He's not going to—ah, what's the saying? Attack Dean's bones? Jump them? Something to that effect. At most, he just wants to touch Dean in a way that's already established as acceptable. He won't push for anything more unless Dean asks.
that, but every part of him outside of his mind hasn't seemed to figure that out yet. Everything else wants to trail after Cas like a goddamn puppy begging for some fucking attention.
"Whatever you want. I know you're an angel, and you don't really care, and you're attached to this whole getup...but it would be a whole lot more convenient if I didn't have to fight with fucking buttons and layers and
"Do you often speak of a father who did better? Do you ever mention a life without pain, or one without ever having gone to Hell?" Castiel murmurs, cleaning the last plate and passing it to Dean.
But, when he gets there, he sits down in the grass and closes his eyes, breathing in the smell of the earth, listening to the chirps and buzzes of insects, feeling the breeze through his hair like fingers. He thinks
Dean didn't know he was capable of hope like this. He didn't know he could believe in something like this so wholeheartedly. He thought he lost that ability, like maybe it died with Cas. But here he is, his heart thundering with it, with how deeply he's clinging to this. He needs this. He
He sincerely doesn't want to, for more reasons than just because he's drawn irrevocably to Dean. What about Jack? He wanted Castiel here.
"Okay, but Eileen is...yours. I mean, she's not anybody's, and she'd kick both of our asses for saying it, but you know what I mean," Dean admits. "It's kind of like...having a sister-in-law. Sort of."
Even if he does end up right back here, he won't do it. If this is all he has, if the one thing that he can do right is refuse, then that's what he's going to do.
Dean huffs out a croaky laugh and grips Cas' hands, letting him help with the whole standing thing. His legs are not very happy with him at the moment, but he doesn't give one fuck. Right now, he's sure that he'd hit his knees again if Cas asked him to. There's this quivering excitement in his chest that beats out the pins and needles in his legs, and he's grinning. He knows he's grinning, doesn't know why, doesn't care, just can't stop. He feels—he
Dean's jaw works, and he says nothing, pressing forward without a word. He feels like he's exploding in slow motion, everything harsh and brittle crumbling down within him. No, he didn't stop Cas. He wanted to. God, he really wanted to. And he didn't, not at all. It's so fucking
fixate on, thank you very much. He's not thinking about it, or how he and Cas are kissing and fucking now, or what any of it means. They're in this in-between stage, and things are fine. No use in shaking things up when they're finally evening out. It's good, and Dean is happy, and Cas is happy, and it's all—
"Yeah. Dude's, like, happier than a pig in mud when he gets to plan shit out. He likes lists and stuff. Ya know, schedules and set plans, things like that."
Dean tilts his head back obligingly, lips parting around a hiss as his fingers slide up into Cas' hair, tangling the strands and tugging on them. Just a little distractedly, he mumbles, "Anything. You can have anything you want, Cas. I'll give you any goddamn thing you want."
And oh, he tried the Jack route. He caved pretty quickly on that one. Seeing as Jack got Cas out the first time, Dean sort of just hoped he'd do it again, no matter if he's leaving everyone to their freedom or not. He had prayed and prayed, and he received no answer from Jack at all. Little twerp. If he ever shows his face again, Dean's going to hug him, and
He can feel himself rearranging accordingly with every slide of Cas' mouth against his own, every swipe of tongue, every scrape of teeth. Just like that, he's not the same anymore. He's practically obliterated, come to think of it, because the kiss reduces him to a shaking mess of want, nothing more than shrapnel in a storm. He knows he's going to want to do this all the time, whenever, every day. He's going to want this, and everything, and
much and deserves to live freely with his family—and, if he's decided that Castiel must be a part of that, then so be it.
Yes, nothing. Castiel cannot and will not look at Dean, or speak with him. Ignoring him is the only option. The safest option.
"Hey, you either want details or you don't, pal," Dean cuts in quickly, holding up his hands in some semblance of surrender.
Breakfast goes smoothly, as far as Castiel is concerned. He's tentatively hopeful that he and Dean are finding common ground again. Well, he's not looking at Dean, or engaging with Dean, but that's probably for the best. Castiel knows he's watching him, but he's almost sure Dean can't tell what happened when he first woke up, then in the shower, just by looking at him.
"Mm," Cas says agreeably, dragging his thumb over Dean's slit, spreading Dean's spit from where his thumb was in his mouth a moment ago as well as precum. Dean's eyes roll back a little. "Is the lubricant still relevant, or would you prefer this?"
