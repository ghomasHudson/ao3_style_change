“Are you still angry with me?”
“Oh my… Oh good lord you’re…”
“Sherlock… Even if that was the case, it doesn’t mean that you’ll have to quit work. You know how it usually is, most of the time you can solve a case through a few lines of text without leaving the house.”
“Damn it, Lestrade! If you had just listened to me about the likelihood of him running, this wouldn’t have happened!”
“Heh, it must have been years since I’ve dipped my feet into the ocean…”
Sherlock was peacefully asleep in bed with his body pressed to John’s in search of warmth under the thin blanket. His leg intertwined over John’s to keep them together with his restful face pressed into the crook of John’s neck. The definition of heavenly in John’s eyes.
Sherlock’s expression soon turned from one a silent joy to pure worry as he turned his attention back to Victor and his hand moved to grip his.
He made his way to his office as soundlessly as he could, the lack of glances he received when exiting Sherlock’s cabin gave him some relief as he opened the door into the infirmary and quickly shut it behind him.
“Sherlock, I am so sorry. I shouldn’t have gone to such an extreme length to get you to focus… I just, I don’t want you to lose yourself like that-“
cabin, on his way to the infirmary. He pulled open the door, one last glassy gaze was shared between them, before John lowered his gaze to the floor and shut the infirmary door behind him.
“Sherlock, this may be difficult right now, but are you able to speak?”
Carefully, Sherlock turned himself to fully face the man and put on his most convincing contented smile. “do you possibly have a cigarette?”
“I don’t want to wear these.”
have been, he instead found a very similar jar that contained rapidly coagulating blood; If he was a little less aware of his being that morning, he would have likely made that mistake.
“Hm?”
“…I suppose not, yet I do appreciate the gesture.” He reached for the cloth in the man’s hand and slipped it to sit it on the nightstand, pressing a tender kiss to his palm before he pulled Holmes under the covers with him. Their hold on each other being a more sufficient supply of warmth than the blanket was able to give.
“So… That’s a no to tea?”
The two stayed quiet as Sherlock examined the scar with increased intensity, finding that the man muttered underneath his breath while taking mental notes of it. The sensation of his breath against his skin finally became too much and he had to turn away from the man red-faced, leaving Sherlock to stare at his back in the darkness.
Sherlock soon pulled him from his thoughts with a gentle tap on his shoulder, giving him a slight smile that John returned after a few moments of pondering. “Alright, you may.”
The light brush of calloused fingers across his scalp stirred Sherlock from an exhausted slumber as he looked up to see the heavenly glow of sunlight that surrounded the face that he had unconsciously memorized down to the last miniscule detail. His hand moved to reach up and rested a gentle palm against John’s cheek, which he instantly leaned into. The delicate movement of his fingers traced over the gentle outline of his jaw while unintentionally he drew John closer, and John hardly objected.
A meek voice spoke up from the crowd of men, John turned to see a young man with shaggy brown hair that was far too lithe for the clothes he was wearing. “Lestrade, we were all there when Captain Holmes gave us the order that you were captain. He doesn’t often change his mind, and why would he give it to someone he barely knows?”
And here we are my lovely readers, 9 chapters, and over 16,000 words. I cannot tell you how much this story has grown so much more than I ever expected, the story between these two could not have happened without all of your continuous support. I feel as if I've been spoiled by all of your lovely and hilarious comments that have inspired me to continue to write this.
“Are, are you sure? I wouldn’t want to take something so precious away from you.”
“Sorry John, just.. do you think he’ll be alright?”
John could easily feel the way Sherlock’s torso curved to move into his touch as John’s hand rested on his hip. The faded transition from skin to scale caused a wandering hand to rub against the conversion. They both found out that Sherlock had ended up practically pressed against him from that touch before they broke away from their kiss with quickened breaths, and they eventually needed to rest their foreheads against one another’s in order to keep their wits about them.
“Anyway, I suppose a proper introduction is in order. My name is Sherlock Holmes, and this is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, with whom you may speak as freely as you would me. Now,”
Ah, there it was, the man gave just a little too much away in that moment.
I could not tell you why, but this particular part of writing had issues with line spacing in one particular spot that I could not fix. Ah well, what can you do :/
(Another very lovely and detailed prompt and I had to break it up. either way, I hope I managed to capture your wonderful idea)
“God- Sherlock this is what I’m talking about!”
Sherlock was jolted awake by the practically demonic sound of his cell door sliding open, the sound usually meant one of the guards was going to stare at him until he ate. That was perfectly fine with him, they would be there for hours if they persisted before they decided to give up.
It was now Mycroft’s turn to let out a sigh with a muttered
What had brought John to his current circumstances, John could hardly recall his thought process that had brought him to his current circumstances when he had sat in his chair for the entirety of the night. His gaze locked upon the open window in front of him that exposed the cool night air to the little warmth his room still held.
Sherlock broke the limp hold Lestrade kept on his forearm, and felt his feet begin to move. The guard held his pistol in his sprint to them and with sloppy accuracy, pulled the trigger.
John only realized that he should have started to hide far too late when the door was quickly pushed open and Lestrade entered with a usual handful of fresh clothes and a small tray of food.
“Oh my god please don’t look up,
John let out a tired yawn and attempted to wipe away the tiredness from his eyes before he lifted his head to look at him. A small painful feeling in the back of his throat built up when he looked into his eyes and saw the worry that was attempted to be hidden.
He wished he never needed to know why when he looked to see a tall, lithe man in an expensive ebony coat make his way to the ship over the haphasard bridge they had made. His face was hidden under his equally dark hat until he lifted his head. A piercing gaze of ice blue eyes locked onto John before they moved to other men of his crew. His voice a silky baritone that held the attention of everyone who heard it.
>>>>>>>>>
The room stayed quiet for a moment, the two of them just enjoyed the stillness after such exertion that Sherlock didn’t expect for John to speak up again after that.
He finished putting the perishable food away and left the rest to be put up later. He slipped off his coat and scarf and placed them on the coat hanger before turned his attention to the staircase of John’s room.
They both let out a small chuckle as they soon hesitantly parted again. Sherlock finished gathering his things and took a fleeting glance back to Victor, a slight sigh escaped him at how easily Victor thought he could hide some things from him.
“As a matter of fact, yes I am. Now if you’ll excuse me…” John made his attempt to walk away, which was a futile accomplishment when he heard an irritated sigh behind him and hands gripped each of his shoulders. It was hard enough not to cry out in agony, and became all the more difficult when he was dragged by his wound back to the hotel. He finally could not take the pain any longer and did what his instincts first told him to do, a swift step on one of the men’s feet freed his shoulder enough to pull away. An attempted grab to his wrist sent his heel into another man’s shins and caused his leg to buckle, he took his opportunity to make a run for it, and just
“I know John, I was here when she told me.”
“The victims were poisoned through their tea.”
Sherlock did not sleep much that night.
John poked his head forward into the room and took a look around. It wasn’t a very large cabin, but there was enough room to place a wooden desk, chair, an extra table, a few barrels, and a simple cot similar to the ones he saw below deck. The window brought in the dim rays of light already beginning to rise and brighten the room much more than any of the infirmaries he’d worked in before.
Sherlock’s tail was somewhat of an anomaly within its self as far as John could understand. Unlike the other, more animal like tails such as John’s own which was fairly goat-like in appearance, Sherlock’s was… Well, it was fairly interesting. It resembled more of the shape that a 17
It was likely half an hour before he decided to open his eyes once again and prepared to leave, when his eyes locked with a small rock that peaked from underneath the ocean. He could only blame it on the idea that he swore he saw movement amongst the stone.
He moved closer to the side rail to peer at that figure, the man himself unmistakable as Mycroft, who appeared to be staring right back at him.
He quietly slipped outside his cabin and looked around deck, it was mostly barren, but he knew Lestrade was always lurking somewhere to work on something.
He had dressed himself not long after he had been confined to his room, the rumpled sheets upon his bed were only a cruel reminder of what had occurred that last night.
Warning: This chapter does contain scenes of violence between Sherlock and John. It is written as crack, that is the tone I chose to take with this chapter in order to fit the request. This is in no way a proper way to deal with drug addiction of someone you may know, hopefully I wrote it in a way that comes across. If the idea of violence between these two make you uncomfortable, even though it is not written too graphically, I would not recommend reading this chapter.
John took longer than normal to catch his breath, his gaze moved from Sherlock every so often before he felt stable enough to turn to him. “You… If MI6 knew about that, you’d be weaponized for sure...”
He hadn’t realised he closed his eyes until he heard the sound of footsteps once again rattle the ship’s floors. He looked up to see men of all shapes and sizes board the ship with any and every weapon john could think of. To John’s surprise, they didn’t immediately begin running to every person to chop off their hands to retrieve a miniscule piece of jewellery.
(See the end of the chapter for
John made a swift turn to Sherlock, who now sat up to look at him with a slightly concerned expression, which was greatly increased when John cupped Sherlock’s head in his hands.
He had just slipped under the covers, the almost silk like texture eased the tension in his shoulders as he stretched to take up the rest of the space in the bed, when he got the most peculiar feeling in his shoulder.
Sherlock hesitantly moved to hold onto his shoulder as he sat down on what used to be his bed and Victor followed suit. The slightly possessive grip Sherlock held onto himself told Victor to just drop it.
“Heh.. I suppose that may have changed after a while… I don’t remember when it started, but I just started thinking of us as a couple that didn’t actually sleep in the same bed. It’s ridiculous, isn’t it?”
He was about to sit down on the steps and give himself up as he couldn’t possibly think of a way out without certain needed materials, when a familiar voice pierced his ears in the echoed stairwell.
“You… You still didn’t have to go to the trouble to get me such a gift…”
It was just then Sherlock exited his bedroom and shut the door behind him with a loud thud, nearly sending both Miss Stoner and John up and out of their seats.
“Well, I don’t know what that could be, I do care about him, I know I do. The way I smile when I see him, I can feel myself become red when he speaks to me, and something inside me just seems to… flutter. It sounds so ridiculous, but It’s just a feeling that I…”
He only received a nod in return, Sherlock made quick work of the pads and went to throw them away when John grabbed his hand. “Sherlock, please sit down. We’ll worry about those later.”
“Um… W… What were you doing?...”
“Right, um…” John turned his attention back to Sherlock before he looked down to his sword and unclipped it from his waist.
He made the effort to swim after him around the cave but Sherlock never managed to sit still for even a moment. It was just when Sherlock began to swim out of the cave again with another bag full of books that Victor had enough of playing follow the leader, and lightly gripped onto his wrist to sit him down.
“Are, are you sure? I wouldn’t want to take something so precious away from you.”
“I would be grateful for it.” He gave him a gentle smile as they began their way down the pier.
It was certainly a calculated risk to take, but something about him seemed… trustworthy to say the least. That was already something to John as there were no longer many people that he was able to trust.
“John, you’re not observing again, but it’s fine. I’m tired and miss things too. Your blanket, me holding your arm, I literally hit you in the jaw when you yanked your arm away… What does that tell you?”
“Gentlemen, I am Captain Holmes and you have been boarded by the crew of the Redbeard. I suggest you make this easy on yourselves, come up from your hiding places before my men come and search for you. They become much more hostile the longer they need to look.” At his words, a few men John recognized yet never caught the names of come into view once again as a self glorified smirk grew on the pirate’s face.
this could be considered torture...”
“Yeah um, it’s more than okay.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Perhaps we could find something to distract ourselves from the hunger.”
John hurriedly swam his way over to the man, who was struggling to the surface until his ankle was released and he broke to the surface with a strangled gasp. This moment of hesitation and pause gave John just enough time to get a good grip on the flailing man. This did not help much as he received several scratches and kicks to his person that led to small droplets of blood finding their way into the water while he struggled to swim back to the dock.
Holmes’ face feigned to a disheartened pout as his eyebrows scrunched and his lips shook. It almost made John feel a small pang of guilt as it was not as though this was his proudest work and he was paid well, he simply did not prefer the idea of being aboard something possibly more abysmal than what he had already experienced.
“How do you know so much about doctors? Do you have your own?”
“So, why have you brought me here? You seem like a man of remarkable social standing; I can’t possibly understand what you could want with me.”
“Alert the crew, we’re about to be boarded.”
The Captain shrugged as he made his way through the room and took the same position as John, bracing his hands on each side of the table and lowered himself to look into the man's eyes. “I make it important for every member of my crew to be in the best shape. I would expect nothing less.”
He soon made his way back downstairs and found Sherlock had moved to lay on the couch, His hands rested on his chest while his tail laid limply on his lap.
John couldn’t help the thankful breath that escaped his throat when he heard the television turn to a commercial. He loved his daughter more than anything, but the programmes she watched were grating to his senses after a certain period of time.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Maybe it was just some dream you had. The mind does do mysterious things when it enters the REM stage of sleep.”
“Good lord, fine!”
don’t look up…”
“Do you… Do you think we’re…”
“Okay, no need to get smart with me.” He looked down to give him a smile and was met with the gentle tilt of Sherlock’s head so their lips just barely brushed against each other.
The faint press of their lips together once again drew an elated sigh from the two as though both men had finally found the light at the end of the tunnel, the water within the desert, the treasure beneath the sea; It was a challenge in itself to allow the other to break away from the needed touch, but was soon needed when John slipped away only to rest his hand along Sherlock’s head.
“Yes, yes thank you Mrs. Hudson. You may send her in.”
He hardly realised how long they had held that tender embrace until he needed to pull away for air. Small gasps for breath escaped him while the young merman gazed at him with a look that John had not received in a very long time, yet he knew could grow quite fond of.
Sherlock merely let out a hum as his fingers ran across the glands of John’s penis. The shockingly cool touch from his fingers ripped a gasp from his throat and caused his hips to buck into his hand. His face grew red from embarrassment at how sensitive he was just from his touch.
“I don’t know what to tell you, I do care about him, that’s already a rarity for me…”
“It’s just a simple sandwich that many people enjoy with their tea. I brought along some for you to try.”
John met his eyes for just a moment before Holmes thumped the end of his sword against the floor; a man from his crew easily came behind John and dragged him away as if he was a sack of flour. He kicked and screamed as he was led back to the pirate’s ship, going so far as to punch the much larger man who was carrying him in the face, yet he had seemingly no reaction to this. He simply picked John up at a different angle for the rest of the way until John was thrown into a room and the door was locked behind him.
“Hello Dr. Watson. Going for a walk?”
A gentle hand was placed on his arm that he barely discerned as Lestrade’s that began to pull him back to the boat. His eyes moved swiftly from John locked in the same spot and the man struggling against Mycroft’s men to get past. He could not be serious; John could not possibly think he was just going to leave him here after everything.
An unusually high pitched gasp left Sherlock as his hand tightened in his curls, his hips soon thrusting to meet John’s strokes as he grew closer and closer to his orgasm until he spilled over. The sight of Sherlock seemingly lost in ecstasy at just the touch of John against him was enough to follow him over the edge soon after with an almost pained groan in his throat.
John felt as if his body was weightless, floating off in another plane of existence as he watched Sherlock crumple to the ground. The scramble to run to him drained him when his eyes set upon his colourless face. The lack of tint in his skin, combined with his already gaunt features, only added to his lifeless look.
It was a mistake to let that thought in as soon as he managed to think of it, as too many questions came to his mind once it surfaced. Was there more to mating with them? If so, was their mating more similar to their human part, or a fish? These thoughts grew to evolve to a more… human form. John thought of what it would possibly look like if Sherlock had legs, even if it did seem impossible, he imagined that he would have long, lithe legs that seemed to go on forever, with defined muscles and just the slightest number of curves in all the right places.
The cab ride home was a rather strenuous and uncomfortable journey as he knew that the water from his clothes was soaking into the leather seating, he would likely never hear the end of it if his driver decided to start a conversation when they reached his hotel.
A cold sweat broke out on his skin as the many stories he’d heard over the years of a pirate’s cruelty ran rampant through his head. He stood up; doing his best to makes his way away from the door and to find something,
A hand slipped away from Sherlock’s face and fell into his lap, which was quickly taken up by John’s own. The comforting warmth of John’s palm against his own left the rest of his anxiety to drain from his body, this allowed for a final comforting silence to spread its way through the room, where the only noise was their mingled breaths.
Sherlock was just about to give a light knock on it when he heard John murmuring something on the other side. He let out a small sigh as he knew this was invading his personal space, but he had to know what was going on with him, and so he slowly turned the door knob and pushed the door open just a crack.
“Would you like some tea? I’m sure today must not have been easy what with a woman going into labour in your office and another doctor calling sick…”
“Ah, alright.” He contentedly took the sandwich John had offered him, and took a bite. It took only a moment of his chewing for him to realise this was not something he wanted to swallow. He gave John a slight smile as the man waited for his reaction while he avoided letting anymore of the so-called food to touch his tongue, and shortly had to spit it out into the water when John turned away from him.
Where his legs should have been, a long fish tail that reached down to the water with shimmering scales that seemed to shift from a navy blue, to black, to almost an aubergine color when the light hit them, sat in place of his lower appendages.
Another bout of quiet washed over the conversation as both tried to think of something to say to the other.
“…Why are you worried about me?”
He took pity on him, as he knew this was something very different to his understanding of intimacy. He pressed a gentle kiss to his lips, and held it for a moment until John relaxed enough to continue. He moved his kisses down his face, pushed away the collar of John’s shirt and nuzzled his nose into the crook of John’s neck.
Sherlock made his way back to his cot and sat down, the glass was soon set down on the table beside him. “We didn’t make a deal, you only stared at me until I stood up got what I wanted.”
At least he was mad whenever Captain Sherlock Holmes was around.
Sherlock perked up at the sound of his friend calling to him, and swam just that little bit faster to meet him at an entrance to the cave with the giddiest smile he had ever seen on him.
“Have a good first day,
A shudder ran through his spine as he allowed once again for his hand to move beneath his covers, the searing touch of skin against skin forced him to hold back a whine that would have undoubtedly alerted his fellow residents had he not covered his mouth.
Sherlock was the first to slip away, but not for the reason John expected. He allowed the waves to lap against his skin as Sherlock kept a hold on John and kept their fingers interlocked before a gentle pull of John’s arm motioned him further to the edge.
The man’s head tilted at the question and let out a low sound that John had to guess was a chuckle. He then received his own question to answer in turn, one that he neither enjoyed, nor wished was said out loud.
“Good morning, miss…” He took a moment to take out the card Mrs. Hudson had slipped him again and actually read it as he couldn’t for the life of him remember what it had said.
Sherlock’s dexterous fingers moved from its grip on the nape of John’s neck to run their way down his chest, watching as a simple graze against the sensitive nubs one the man’s chest caused his whole body to shiver and his hips to stall as he attempted to hold back the wonderful noises he so often made only when he had truly lost any restraint.
This instigated a look from Mycroft that John did not dare return, but the feeling was noted when the blanket was then thrown at his head rather forcefully. It was yanked away quick enough to turn his attention back to Sherlock.
“… You are insane if you think I’m going to come with you so willingly.”
“Good lord!”
He gripped the door handle and was about to pull it open when Lestrade gripped his wrist. John looked down at their connected hands, and was about to cock his fist back and finally get this man away from him when Lestrade held up a sheathed sword to block him.
A flat palm to Sherlock’s face reverberated through the small cab just as the sting ran through John’s hand and Sherlock’s cheek. It went quiet for a moment again, John easily thought that they were about to be thrown out of the cab but it soon stopped in front of Baker Street. John swiftly paid and pushed them both out of the cab and towards home.
His first thought was that it was a shipwrecked sailor that had been stranded not far from shore. It was a likely possibility as there seemed to be a large quantity of men that have been found washed ashore much like this one. He had just stood from his place on the dock to gain a wider field of vision and potentially to alert the authorities, when he looked to the rock again to see that there was no one there.
The gaze Lestrade received back to his comment made him regret ever mentioning the place in front of the doctor.
The pain of his hands slamming down on the old wood of the window ceil drew him away from the cool night air, his legs gave away just as he made his way back to his chair, the cigarette case sat temptingly beside him, yet only cast another dark shadow upon his wall. His hand moved to rest on his bitten shoulder, the darkened marks dipped into his skin gave him some comfort while the impending feeling of doom began to loom within those shadows.
“John?...”
“Sherlock, just put them on.”
He let out a short breath as his head buzzed with unanswered questions, maybe it would be possible to ask Sherlock once he saw him again. The thought itself made an unnoticed smile grow on his face as he moved back to clean his desk up to pass the time.
It was hardly fast enough for him as he watched the sun above him begin to dim further beneath the horizon. John could have already left after waiting so long, what if he decided not to come back after that?
A moonlit stroll draws the pirate and doctor closer, much closer ;)
The room seemed to stand still for a moment, the beeping of Sherlock’s monitors blurred from John’s hearing as he could only watch Sherlock stare at him while he seemingly did not breathe.
They were interrupted when they heard Mycroft clear his throat behind them, which caused both them to look back to him as he set the satchel and blanket down. “It’s lovely to see you reunited, now may we get on with this?”
“Yyep.” He let the p to make a pop as his tail moved again to pick up a cup of tea that he’d made earlier, which he soon took from it and had a sip.
“The process will only work if the person completing it has a compelling reason that will let them complete it. If one does not have a good reason, what is the point in taking the opportunity?”
After they had made it to land, he was quickly placed in the nearest prison one could find in the southern part of Cornwall. A transfer was likely the next step as Mycroft was adamant that he was to be held in London.
No one managed to make it to anything resembling a bedroom in any sense of the word. A sitting room became the next best option, as that is where they were found by the staff that began to carry the soaking books inside to dry off. Mycroft was sat within a reading chair, his head resting against the back of it, with a decanter and half full glass sitting beside him on a side table.
“Do you really believe Lestrade is dim enough to believe the ravings of a criminal?”
The clerk returned to look at John shake his head his assumption. “I’m afraid I am just a doctor, my lad.”
Victor let out a small sigh and let his hand fall loosely into Sherlock’s own to pull him back to the cave.
“For god’s sake, Hit me!”
“My darling,
Sherlock finally returned his smile and moved to press a true kiss to his lips, and they held it. Nothing else seemed to matter in that moment as John sat on the edge of Sherlock’s bed, held his hand against his face, and held out that kiss for as long as they possibly dared.
“Ah, well that is to be expected. My men I’m afraid haven’t had proper care for a long time and they are all but weary from a lack of proper medical attention, I’m sure you can understand.”
Sherlock quickly ran over to the edge and looked to see the man had grabbed onto the ledge of the next building and pulled himself up from the edge. Sherlock felt a shiver run down his neck as he watched him run away.
His head quickly darted to the man as he stood up from his chair, and made his way over to him, the way his unsettlingly warm hand rested on the crook of his neck made Sherlock want to crawl out of his skin.
Sherlock slowly pulled his hand away, wiping his hand on his coat at he gestured towards his office. His eyes glanced towards John and quickly dropped at the expression of what could only be described as anguish at his description that he was nothing more than a lowly doctor. He’d heard it all before, yet it had never hurt him so deeply.
He did not get that.
His daily promenade instructed by his physician only seemed to accentuate the pain in his leg, and he was relieved when he found a small dock that remained away from the rest of the droves of individuals that gave him passing glances when he walked.
He was able to drag him over to the sofa and pushed him off there, and watched as the man curled in on himself like a freezing animal while John tried to catch his own breath.
He was instead stopped a few steps away from him by a sword to his chest. His eyes met with John’s and he somewhat enjoyed seeing the look of utter determination and anger on his face before it melted away in recognition and relief.
He took to the stairs two steps at a time before he stood in front of john once again, and watched as John’s hand extended towards him, patiently waiting.
Sherlock was quiet for a little while; his small pile of fruit was abandoned while his attention was turned to focus on his tail that just slightly drifted in the water.
It was quiet for a moment, a pleading stare for this young man to tell such an intimate detail of his life without the slightest hint in his eyes that he wouldn’t spread this news to the rest of London while John is carted away for indecency.
John remained silent as he watched Sherlock finally looked back to him with tears in his eyes that burned his skin as they rolled down his cheeks.
“My lad, are you alright? Do you need help?”
It took a moment for both men to gain their wits about them again, which seemed to be a great help to Sherlock’s mind set as he sat straight back up again to gather himself. John was not as level headed about the incident.
“I suppose it is getting late…”
He began the tedious task of placing the food away, but barely got through most of the perishables before Sherlock stepped into the kitchen from his bedroom, which he obviously just awoke from even if it was already the middle of the day.
“Alright.”
Sherlock had just locked the door and turned to face John when he felt their lips collide once again, the gentle heat coursing through John’s body only intensifying once they touched. They soon moved to the desk in the center of the room, Sherlock ever so gracefully leaning against it to brush away his mess of papers as he held John’s head to press their lips together after what felt like an eternity of them apart, even if it had only been a moment.
The pleasurable abuse to his cock continued on for a few agonizing minutes, every so often feeling so close to the edge before Sherlock would pull away and press kisses to the inside of his thighs and everywhere else except where he needed it most.
Sherlock turned to hold a finger to his lips as he slipped away from John and swam deeper within the water. It was then that John took the opportunity to look beneath him at how deep the ocean had become as they swam further out from shore, to where he couldn’t possibly see the bottom.
He left after that, he just left with John spiraling in his seat with the kitchen a mess of spilt milk and a boiling kettle. John didn’t even bother calling after him; he just stood up, turned the kettle off, cleaned up the milk and went to bed. He was not ready to dealing with anymore nonsense today.
It was finally then that Sherlock dropped the tensity he held in his shoulders and ran his hands over his face to calm himself. His hands soon falling back to rest on Victor’s.
“…How did you know about that?”
For a mere second, the normally smug expression melted away into something almost resembling empathy. The look shook Sherlock to his very core and he wished he could hide away from the look for the rest of his life.
“John, it’s fine…”
“I… Just a moment.” He moved to his desk and took out a piece of paper, and quickly scribbled down a note before he unclipped his sword from its buckle. He set it across his desk and stuffed the note inside, finally he moved from his desk and began to follow Mycroft outside.
“n… No, it tasted metallic… and i… I tried swallowing but I couldn’t..” He looked back to Mrs. Hudson with a look that she had never seen on his face in all the years she had known him. Fear in its purest form stared back at Mrs. Hudson as both their eyes moved back to Sherlock’s arm.
“It’s alright… Did something happen today?”
By around 9 am, he had read half of the book and had already began to lay bored upon the salt-stained wood as he watched the clouds pass by above him. He enjoyed trying to find the many shapes that they took the form of.
John turned to give him an astonished look on his face as it felt fairly odd that Sherlock thought he was not in fact genuinely complimenting him. “Of course, it was. it was absolutely extraordinary.”
Sherlock hardly even looked at him, and seemed to stare to the wall behind him to avoid eye contact.
He felt himself nearly leap from his skin when he looked into the water to see a dark tail pass underneath his reflection. The animal it belonged to must’ve been an absolute behemoth of a creature to possess such a tail. Perhaps it was a dolphin that had been washed into the dock, or possibly even a shark.
The anxiety what he hoped was only a passing thought became more prevalent as the seconds ticked by without a hint of breath from him. He could feel the will in his body begin to slip away, the urge to fall on the ground beside him and curl in on himself was tremendous that he hardly noticed the waving breath that fogged his mirror.
That’s what he thought, until he watched the man’s frantic eyes run over rooftops and he turned, took a few steps back, and jumped.
Yet that would be too late, wouldn’t it? He’d need to fire sooner, and so would his adversary.
John eventually couldn’t take the silence anymore and he moved to press his lips to Sherlock’s. He had to admit that it didn’t feel as different as he expected, it was more… gentle, sweet. He also could have contributed that to both of them being dead tired but he wasn’t going to think about it.
Lestrade gave a small nod even if he didn’t agree with the decision he made. He knew Sherlock would want John to be there no matter what, and he was certainly right about that.
Sherlock hardly seemed to be able to contain his anticipation when he awoke the next day.
John managed to pull Sherlock into his arms and thread his fingers into his curls after a painfully long moment of anxiety between the two. “How is this going to be done?”
(See the end of the chapter for
John gave him a small nod as he set the cotton pad away to focus all his attention on Sherlock.
Mycroft comes aboard the Redbeard, nothing goes well
He then simply walked out of the room and shut the bedroom door behind him. John hardly had time to finish buttoning his vest and cover his lap with a nearby cushion, when the door opened and Mrs. Hudson popped her head in.
“So if I supposedly do join your crew, I refuse to take part in whatever just occurred out there.” He waved his hand in the general direction of where his ship last resided, and looked out the closest window for a moment to notice that it was no longer there.
Sherlock didn’t like that, he couldn’t have it, he wouldn’t have it. After all of this work, all of this effort in order to prove that this man was in fact guilty, and they were just letting him get away?
“Sherlock… can you let go? I have to go to bed so I can get to work tomorrow…”
John has an unpleasant conversation with the ship's first mate, it leads to conflict throughout.
He received no answer.
“Thankfully, we have a treatment where we can reduce the swelling and you should have complete movement in your limbs within a few days. You will however have to wear a back brace for a few weeks, but after that you’ll be perfectly alright.”
“I look at you, and I just love you, and it terrifies me. It terrifies me what I would do for you.” -Anonymous

“… I used to have a dog named Redbeard.”
Sherlock could only smile as they began to make their way down the rest of the stairs, avoiding guards that carelessly passed them without a second glance towards the three men that clearly did not work there. None of them gave it a second thought when they reached the exit door and pushed it open.
John could not shut his door fast enough behind him after he looked away from Sherlock, his tears threatening to fall any second, but he would not let them. He made quick work of a few with his sleeves, and laid down on the small cot in the corner. Even with so little room, the bed felt so empty without
“Good morning Sherlock how are you…” he stopped when he looked to see John underneath the covers, peeking from underneath them before he dived back down.
They sat in a calm quiet for a moment, as Sherlock picked at the fruit, which he seemed to have a fondness for, until Sherlock decided to speak up over the crashing of the waves that filled their silence.
John let out a small chuckle as he pulled Sherlock closer to him; Work was forgotten, breakfast was forgone, anything outside of their small bubble was unnecessary to remember as they soon fell asleep in the others arms.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
He watched as this merman turned his head just slightly, as if he was confused by his response to this new discovery. This marvel of a creature was openly sitting in the public, when it could so easily be taken by someone with a less savory intent.
“The sarcasm is not needed right now. Are you alright? Is anything damaged?”
The sound of joy he would have made was interrupted by a nurse that knocked on the door and then made her way inside.
“Jes- Don’t do that!”
He dared not to keep his touches more than a slow and light stroke of the hand against his aching cock, as whatever caused this sudden need that rumbled deep within him wanted it out as quickly as possible, and that was not what he needed quite at the moment.
“Yes, I am Doctor Watson. May I help you?”
It became much more of a possibility the longer he thought about it, Sherlock was prone to not eating for days, hiding himself away within him home, and hardly seeing anyone. It wasn’t a far stretch to see him easily starving himself to death. His visits to John were the most motivated he was to leave the house in a very long time, and he could hardly ignore how happy he seemed.
They both turned their attentions to the ambulance where Sherlock was and John quickly made his way to step in and sit beside him. He watched as Sherlock’s eyes scanned over everything with a panic-stricken gaze before his eyes locked with John.
Mycroft had found himself stood somewhat back from the current agony that took place, as he couldn’t stomach to watch this. “This process is not an easy one, it isn’t as though there is a puff of smoke and everything is perfectly in order. Muscles must be ripped apart and shifted, bones are broken and regrown. It is often many a merfolk dies from this procedure.”
Sherlock head gave a small tremble as he gripped his wrist impossibly tighter to himself, they pulsating feeling within his shoulder gave him some much-needed reassurance as to his decision when he finally allowed himself to nod. “Yes, I am certain.”
Mycroft then slipped his little black book into his pocket, and hardly missed a beat to begin another speech. “If you need more convincing, I’m sure we can negotiate later on. Although, I am sure you will see my offer is more than… sufficient…”
“I know, I know. It’s just what I do to help Rosie when she’s upset. Just breathe for me, okay?” He looked to meet his eyes but ended with their foreheads pressed together instead. It didn’t matter to him, as he savored in the quiet moment between them with a few sniffles intermingled.
“That is… um, well thank you, I think, as much as I enjoy the backhanded compliments and imprisonment in this hotel… Do you think it is possible to go now?”
Sherlock delicately managed to pull the book from John’s grasp and moved closer to him, he closed the space that lingered between them and turned John head to face him. It was then that he noticed the slightly nervous look in John’s eyes at was about to occur.
“Gentlemen, I’m afraid I must retire early tonight. Do continue and do not stay up until the ungodly hours of morning, good evening.”
“Oh my god, Sherlock I’m so sorry, are you alright?”
“… Slightly. I just need you to understand that you can’t put yourself in that situation again. I know you have little regard for your safety when it comes to cases, but promise me you won’t do something like that.”
“Doctor Watson, you are under house arrest for treason against her royal majesty. You are to remain confined within this room until a trial date is to be arranged.”
“Hmm?”
“Do you really mean all of that? You’re talking to me like we’re a couple.”
“What… what is that?”
I've been thinking about that idea, but I unfortunately can't write Johnlocks hehe. -Guess_This_Guest
“Sherlock, you really shouldn’t use it like that so much. You’re bound to hurt yourself.”
He eventually felt one of his hands lowered down by Sherlock’s and he looked to see one of his impish grins plastered on his face as they looked at each other.
Holmes let out a small groan as he thought the offer over. He certainly wasn’t lacking in men to take part in raids as it usually meant an increase in pay for them to spend how they wanted. It was a ridiculous idea to allow such a rare commodity as a doctor risk his life when he could provide plenty of care to his men after the fact. It seemed to be the most obvious solution.
They remained locked together as the moon continued to rise along with the ocean’s waves, to where John could often see Sherlock’s tail fins float near the top of the dock. John’s hand discreetly slipped away from resting on Sherlock’s hip into his vest pocket to pull out his watch. It was nearly ten at night and would continue to grow later until they both decided to take their leave, which seemed to become less and less appealing as more time went on. Their grip on one another only seemed to tighten more than any of the previous days.
(Also, another explanation that a gave to someone who asked. maybe this will also help bc I am horrible at explaining)
“See? Everything will be alright.”
“Believe me, you will want this.”
“Well, he did! But noooo, apparently someone isn’t likely to jump two stories without a way to get down, yet look where we are now!”
John ran his fingers over the salt-stained cover that was already unreadable and turned to the first page that read
“Yes… I suppose it would be.”
By 12 pm, he had finished his book and began to feel dry, so he went for a little swim nearby the dock. He watched as fish swam beside him in their little schools amongst the lively coloured corals. Sherlock sat up on his rock to see the many children that ran through the waves while mothers tutted at their antics and went to promenade with their other socialite friends. He never cared for how they hardly just let their children be kids in this society before they were obligated to fulfill a role in it at the age of 18, that could explain all of the absurd antics of adults he had seen.
He couldn’t explain why the sudden urge to stay up until two in the morning was so attractive to him, especially due to the multiple exhausting days he’d suffered through at the clinic, but it was finally his few days off and he was now on autopilot as he scrolled through some random website he’d found earlier that day.
“Come on, kid. I know you’re not asleep. I’m not going to play this game with you again, so we can do this the easy way, or the hard way.”
He felt his body go rigid and his testicles tighten as his climax overtook him, he was faintly aware that one hand had ripped away the sheets from the corners of bed and the other had found its way between his teeth. His back arched itself from the mattress beneath him as he relished in the unbridled ecstasy of his orgasm till, he fell boneless back onto the rumpled sheets of his bed.
“You are about to fall asleep on my shoulder, you want to head to bed?”
As well as different AUs, I always thought the idea of different universes the two actors have been in Ex.) The Office(UK), Doctor Strange, The Imitation Game, The Hobbit, and Fortysomething. These are just suggestions of the ones I can remember, and you do not have to suggest them, it's just an option if someone would like to
“Okay, now let’s get some dinner. Does take out sound good?”
“For the love of god John, do not stop.”
He happily accepted it when he didn’t realise he was dying for one. The man helped light the cigarette and he took in a long puff of it, the smoke pooled within his throat and lungs in a heavenly burn until he let the smoke escape his lips.
“Sherlock, you know your voice is such a low octave that I can’t hear you when you do that. What did you say?”
John took a breath and fully turned to him, his hand resting on Sherlock’s hip as his thumb rubbed small circles into his skin. Possibly for himself more than Sherlock. “I suppose a conversation Lestrade had with me today has made me… disquieted.”
Sherlock nearly went boneless when he felt a light touch from calloused fingers wrap around his hand and soon pulled Sherlock into his grasp without so much as a greeting between them. The soft brush of skin against his shoulder was what caught his attention as John buried his head into the crook of Sherlock’s neck and didn’t move for quite some time.
“Oh, alright then. I’m afraid I am not well-acquainted with stones.”
*I will add to this later on if I need to
Several others came after it, all seemingly aimed to crack in his skull as he endeavored to dodge them until he gripped the pole of the dock and meekly poked his head out of the water to see what was going on.
“I want to sin every time I am with him.” -Ming D. Liu (He wants to corrupt me, and I let him.)
Sherlock remained mute as he kept his gaze on John’s forehead, his body soon moved back to its original position, Sherlock’s face now pressed into the crook of John’s neck.
>>>>>>>>>>>>
He was nearly to the door, so close to his small world where there was only one other thing that mattered, when he saw
I was initially hesitant on starting such a project, as I already have a lot of ideas in mind for the future, but I would like to try my hand at your suggestions as there has not been one of these for quite some time if I recall
Lestrade let out a sigh behind him as the creak of wood alerted John to him rising out of his seat. “It would be easier to let you find out yourself, Sherlock is a complicated man to explain. His past is bound to catch up to him sooner or later…”
He did his best to keep quiet as he pushed the door open, silently cursing himself when the door made a horrific squeak as it swung wide to reveal Captain Holmes working on straightening a chair when he looked over to John. An obviously tired smile met John’s eyes as he walked in. “Ah John, I was expecting to have a little more time to finish up but, since you’re here you can tell me what you think.”
Sherlock had to pull away for a moment to allow himself a quiet laugh as desperate John was so much more fun. “Aw, are you sure? I could easily do this all day...”
Oh. Apparently, he did think about it.
“I meant that you both could move in with me once I’m finished here.”
He despised how the offer began to grow more and more appealing the longer he pondered on it. A disposable income, a few rooms to himself that allowed him to wander about as he pleased… He felt a lump begin to grow in his throat as his hand slipped into his inner coat pocket and felt the gentle velvet box rub over his knuckles.
(I forgot to mention - John has a short tail, something like a goat's if I remember correctly and Sherlock had what I imagined a devil's tail would look like.)" -Shadowsoul_954
He moved the kneel down on the deck and watched as a young man that gripped onto the dock’s pole came into view. Soaking curls that dripped water from their ends framed the man’s face and drew John’s attention to his eyes, the bright contrast of their pale hue and the murky water that surrounded him could only make him stand out more. These things, added on with prominent cheekbones and supple, full lips that John had never seen so full even on a woman, added to this lovely mystique about him as he hardly looked afraid like he thought he would be, but rather interested.
The light wade through the dark water hardly allowed for John to drift from Sherlock, as just a light brush against his foot from some kelp or a fish that couldn’t see him caused him to grip onto Sherlock tighter. He hardly minded though, as he only held John closer to him.
They both shared a soft chuckle as John finished up with wrapping his hand, Holmes soon stood up to grab his jacket as he looked out the window to see the sun now rising. “I suppose I should go, this isn’t exactly how I wanted to professionally meet you, but it certainly hasn’t been a waste.”
He fell to his side and turned his attention from Lestrade on the other end of the phone, to an unconscious Sherlock. He pressed his finger tips to his neck and felt a very faint pulse underneath the skin.
“Well, of course I want that, but how will you…” He took a glance towards Mycroft, and he could have sworn all of the salvia in his throat evaporated at just the slightest idea of how this was to happen. “Oh…”
“Well, for the moment, you will stay at my residence until we find suitable lodgings for you two.”
John soon made his way to the bathroom and hit his hand against the door, the shockwave of it certainly caught Sherlock’s attention as the water turned off and it went absolutely silent on the other side of the door.
This hidden need, this ache that had sat inside him longer than he had known possible, bubbled up to sit within the confines of his chest. If he had described it as a fire within him before, it was nothing compared to this.
“Sherlock, I wish I could promise you that all of this is just a bad dream and it will all be fixed when you wake up, but I can’t… But I don’t want you to think that you’ll be left alone in some home to rot away into nothing, I won’t let that happen. We’re um.. We’ll go home together after this, okay?”
Mycroft took the opportunity for the question to linger in the air as he made his way to a nearby decanter, and poured himself a rather large glass of whiskey before he downed half of it on his way back to a chair close to John. The burning helped to sate the sudden need to be back in the water and away from this conversation.
Victor took a moment to look down at their intertwined hands as he began to take in his words. A slight trembling overcame his hands that Sherlock must have noticed in an instant, but did not bother to comment on. He only sat and waited patiently for Victor to calm himself, which took awhile longer than either expected.
The two men made their way out onto the moonlit deck as the sounds of cheerful eating and drinking began to fade from them. The two leaned against the edge of the ships as gentle waves crashed beneath the ship.
“I don’t want to hear of you going behind my back again to “warn” John of anything. I won’t let anything happen to him, perhaps your idea of loyalty needs to be reevaluated.” He soon turned to walk away, a shot of anger running through his spine when he heard Lestrade’s voice once again.
John let out a small sigh as he pinched the bridge of his nose; this is not where he wanted to have this conversation. “Sherlock, I meant to speak to you about this earlier. You can’t just live off of… whatever it is you eat, if you eat every day at all. It can’t possibly be good for you in the future.”
“Oh um… thank you.”
person he wished was not here to see him like this.
He listened to the small chuckle from Sherlock that his eagerness caused, his face only grew redder as Sherlock moved his head closer to John’s own head and allowed his already accelerated breath to travel over the hot skin. A genuine smile growing on his face as he watched the member in his hand twitch and release a drop of precum on his wrist, which he promptly licked away.
He was easily dragged down to Sherlock’s lips while his hands fumbled to undo their trousers, and dragged them down to join the rest of their clothing. Hands continually dragged him back to the safety and comfort of his lover’s lips as their hips met each other, causing breathy moans to escape them and fall into the other’s mouth.
John only shook his head as he placed the weapon where it rightfully belonged. “I was never good with hand-to-hand combat. I always preferred a firearm.”
Mycroft let out a long sigh as he ran his fingers over his eyes, trifling with children was something he thought was long behind him. “Yes, I was assigned to take you back to England as a prisoner. Are you satisfied with your answer?”
“Seeing as he is now dressed, are we ready to go now?”
Ugh, I'm making this sound as though I'm leaving forever. Thank you for all your support on this story, and I hope to see you all again in the not too distant future :)
John had to let out a small chuckle in amusement at his antics as he allowed his hands to wander over Sherlock’s chest, often slipping beneath his robe to grasp at the pristine skin of his shoulder.
He had to take a breath as he reached the top of the stairs, his limbs were stretched to levels that shouldn’t be possible to the common person just to avoid a series of creaks that seemed like he would fall through the steps if he placed a foot onto them. He soon turned his attention to John’s bedroom door and made his way over to the piece of peeling wood.
The ride home was anything but settling, as someone who was completely new to the experiences of life that he was now to live in, Sherlock was stood from his seat at every moment, watching the people that they passed by. His eyes scanning the figures that they passed by in quick succession, the multitude of observations and questions building up in his head, many of which likely should go unasked.
Sherlock and John could only stand watch as the man drew a pistol from his coat pocket, the object left a sinister gleam in the sun that it took to be held firmly in his hand.
He stared at him for a moment, and watched as he shivered to the point he nearly fell off the couch, and John had to relent and picked his blanket up to cover up Sherlock.
“Jesus Sherlock, for once can’t you clean up after yourself?”
Sherlock let out a light chuckle and shook his head as he took another bite of fruit. “I quite like it. Doctor John Watson, it sounds very important.”
He hardly got a response until Sherlock set his cup down and shook his towards the counter.
“Sherlock?”
“you’re enjoying this aren’t you?”
He continued to slowly slink his way down the stairs, wary of footsteps seeming to come from every direction of this place and caused him to hide in a small alcove for a good part of half an hour before he could be certain no one was coming down the passageway.
John brushed along Sherlock’s cheekbone as he watched the man beneath let out a soft chuckle. Just to see that smile again, the way his face seemed to glow whenever he managed to pull a laugh from him, was enough to draw him in once again to lightly brushed their lips together.
I’d like this to be the start of a new phase in their relationship. Happy ending please. -ShakespearelovedLadyMacbeth
I feel that I should explain the way these marks work as they can get a little confusing. These marks are somewhat similar to the ones you would find in an ABO universe, although they serve a larger purpose than to mark that the two are exclusively together. It's more emotionally based so if one were to feel very strongly in one way, it would influence the other as they could feel whether their partner feels love, lust, anger, sadness, etc. Hopefully that helped a little as I feel I can never quite get the intention through with these things in just my writing.
“Watson, are you alright?”
“Now this might sting a bit, but I have to keep the wound together in order for it to heal properly.” He only received a simple nod in return; enough of a confirmation to continue as he delicately threaded the needle and held the man’s thin arm closer to him. The simple touch of their fingers against one another was sufficient enough for John to feel his usual calm demeanor slip away, and cause him to break out into a cold sweat. This was highly unusual for him, was he possibly growing ill from his earlier fit the previous day?
The travel from getting his food to find a place at the table was mostly uneventful, only having to dodge suspicious looks as he attempted to eat his food in peace. The staring was only made worse when Captain Holmes began to speak.
His men made a collective cheer and wished him the same. Sherlock began to make his way out, but not before signaling for John to join him.
(See the end of the chapter for
He refused to let out the groan that wanted to escape his throat when he took a seat on the sea worn wood of an abandoned dock that allowed enough privacy for him to finally enjoy the gentle crash of waves against the structure as he allowed it to fill his senses.
Lestrade seemed confident enough to understand that this was not Sherlock’s normal bout of irritable morning attitude, and soon set down his papers to walk closer to him.
The two others were still attempting to calm themselves from the previous exertion, as Sherlock removed himself of his coat and shoes. Discarding a few more things that he preferred not to lose before he took a step back, breathed in the cold day’s air, and ran over the old wood past the two men.
The clerk seemed to notice the newly formed grimace that appeared on his face and quickly stepped in to protect his sale.
“…I don’t think it is…”
The two curled up together underneath the covers as John ran his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and Sherlock ran his thumb over the smooth skin of John’s arm.
He didn’t need to focus on the matter, Lestrade was just protective of his friend. That was all, yes, just protective.
John soon gave into the thought that he was possibly overstepping his boundaries and let go of Sherlock’s face. He took a few steps away from the side of the bed as he ran his fingers through his hair, an attempt to get his thoughts together.
Apparently,
“It’s… its very nice, thank you Captain.”
“Wha… Why? Is everything alrigh-“
John let out a light, nervous laugh as he had never even thought of what colour he wanted. He wanted something distinctive about Sherlock, and the one thing that stuck in his mind was his eyes. The piercing, almost indescribable blue that seemed to dim every other thing around them and could capture your gaze within a second.
Sherlock gave him a small smile before he moved his tail up onto his bed.
I will be more than happy to write fluff or angst( Moffat and Gatiss have inspired a generation filled with it), I am a little rusty with my smut but I will do my best if you suggest it!
“We need to tail that ship, keeping about a 300-meter distance in order for them to lose visual. Luckily, we’ll keep ours as the fog has lost most of its coverage.” He closed the telescope and turned back to Lestrade, how seemed so giddy at the moment as he looked down to John. He cleared his throat and turned back to the crew before John took too much notice of it.
They both found their way up from their chairs and to the hotel door, John was fairly relieved when he could so easily walk through the doorway and take in the London air, before he was persistently pushed into the awaiting cab by Mycroft and they began to drive off before he even knew it. He took note of the leather bag and knitted blanket that sat in between them as the ocean air began to fill his nose and excite the exhausted nerves in his body.
“oh, um… do you want to?-“ He moved to pull them back together again, which Sherlock appreciated but again, was not what he meant.
“Jesus…” He dropped his bag on the floor, and was somewhat thankful by the loud thud it created when it made contact with the already abused wooden floor.
Mycroft expectantly turned his attention back to Sherlock to explain the strange, short man that had just escaped from his cabin, but Sherlock cut him to the chase. “He’s... He’s a doctor we took prisoner, from a ship we raided a few days ago.”
“Why? I’m perfectly comfortable the way I am now, and John doesn’t seem to have a problem with it.”
“I couldn’t think of a better man for the job.”
“You certainly can sir, I believe the jeweler called it Aquamarine. In the past the stone has been used as a talisman to keep sailors safe at sea.”
“Fuuck Sherlock- Oh God you feel amazing…” He spoke with what little breath he had as Sherlock seemed to give it his all after his little comment. His free hand that wasn’t holding john’s legs apart moved to fondle his balls as his head moved back for his tongue to run over John’s head before moving back down.
It was difficult to disagree with him as the appeal to settle within the lapping waves and allow the cool currents to envelop him completely with Sherlock beside him grew far too tempting too quickly.
“Yeah, that sounds alright.”
The man in question let out a small sigh before he went to grab his dressing gown, and stopped. The small glance John had given him only gave him conformation of what he suspected over the last few weeks; the dancing around each other was tiring to Sherlock and he may or may not have upped the number of experiments just to start something, as John would likely just ignore every other of Sherlock’s attempts at flirting.
John quickly turned to look back at Sherlock. “Sherlock, what did you do to him?”
The shudder of relief that fell away from John’s shoulders at the sight of him drew him away from the shield that was Mycroft, and allowed his feet to travel down the dock until he was knelt at where Sherlock’s head fell upon the wood. His hand instinctively moved to run itself through the silky curls that he had missed and ached to see.
Sherlock gave him a small nod and adjusted himself to meet his gaze. “It’s feeling so much better that, thank you doctor.”
A heavy silence made its way between the two as a piercing wind grew in the evening’s breeze. There was no possible way Mycroft could know about it… Could he?
“What? No, John I can’t.. can you fix it?”
“You think so?”
“Sherlock, can we not do this right now? We are nearly almost home and we’ll settle this there.”
Both of them couldn’t get up fast enough from the floor to dust themselves off, the awkward silence between them was too much for Sherlock after so much of it already and he had to speak up first.
“Damn, I thought he hit the wall harder than that…”
“Good morning, I was told I was to meet a mister Sherlock Holmes?...”
They went quiet for a moment, and John just knew he had said the wrong thing when Sherlock let out what was akin to a snort as he moved to press a kiss to him before he slipped back down into the water.
The texture against Sherlock’s palm was fluffy and warm from how close it was pressed to John’s body. It was rather comforting to just hold for a few moments to keep that warmth, before he flipped open the lid to see polished gold that was shaped into delicate hands with the thumb and index fingers clasped around a shimmering light blue stone, intricately cut, that seemed nearly blinding due to the last few rays of the dying sun that still peeked over the horizon beside him.
“Sherlock…”
It took a moment for John to understand what Mycroft had just said. It was obvious he would never understand the complexities that he had found himself surrounded in, but to say something so cryptic as to what Sherlock did for him, it did not level off the anxiety that John felt building up inside him. “Why… Why would he do that?”
“Well, I suppose I should get going… I have to pick up Rosie in the morning and then I have to head to the clinic… Would it be okay if I stopped by after my shift?”
Sherlock turned back towards his ship in a feeble attempt to see John one last time, just to catch a glimpse of his gentle eyes and soft wheat coloured hair. He didn’t look forward to seeing a look of utter betrayal that met his eyes and made them sting and his throat burn.
The young man was then called into a back room as he left John to sulk in his words at the counter. John glanced up when another man entered the store, a tall, stout man that was dressed some of the most expensive clothes a gentleman could wear at the time. What could he possibly want in a small shop such as this one?
Lestrade gave them a small nod, and soon left them alone to warm up and dry off in peace. It was only then that Sherlock managed to curl up within John’s lap with many layers wrapped around him. Yet, he still visibly shivered when he eventually emerged with his legs perfectly intact.
“Hm? Oh, it’s John Watson. It’s a little plain compared to yours.”
Also, completely off topic but also on topic mention, but did you know Sherlock was leaving Netflix on May 14th? I do not know how many of you knew it was on there, but it was certainly upsetting when I first learned of it.
The two bickering men turned their attentions back to the squirming merman as he had slipped from John’s arms only slightly, which caused him to try and claw back up into them as though he would slip through the cracks in the wood beneath him. It was then that John managed to move Sherlock into his lap with his head cradled within the crook of his neck. The instant iron grip Sherlock took onto him, combined with the small whimpers that escaped him and collected in John’s ear only drew him in closer as his fingers ran through his curls.
“Wait, wait a minute. I may have not known you for very long, and so far, that relationship has been strained at best. Why, why now have you just given him the chance to change his life for me?”
The carriage ride home was a mostly silent and awkward one as John managed his wounds while Sherlock stole most of the blankets. Sherlock did not know why the air between them had suddenly become tense, but he knew he was likely to find out soon enough.
He allowed his hand to slip away from John’s with, luckily, not too much pain as he tried to roll over. That did not illicit the same, as throbbing discomfort ran all through his left side.
“Perhaps this will spark your memory, Doctor Watson. A rare book is given away, just to see another smile. A kiss is exchanged, that leads to something more… Intimate.”
“Don’t talk about yourself like that! You’ve accomplished more in your life than many others could only ever dream of, and that makes you anything except worthless. This injury doesn’t make you any less of the man you were, especially to the people who care about you.”
“Oh my god, Lestrade!”
The sounds of metal hitting the wooden deck rained through the air as they turned to see hooks latching onto the side of their ship, practically dragging the Redbeard along side them. Their ship had no choice but to cease their endeavor and surrender.
The relief only further came when his phone began to ring. He quickly dried his hands from the wash up he was attempting to finish with the noise, and picked up the phone to see Sherlock’s icon on the screen. He swiped to answer it, as he hardly seemed to see him recently with the task of taking care of Rosie.
It was a quick relief to his quick forming headache, which was soon drawn away by the burning that pressed to his cheek as John pressed a cotton pad soaked in disinfectant to the newly formed coat he had placed on his cheekbone.
Victor could not help the small smile that graced his face when he watched Sherlock looked so happy at just saying a man’s name. As much as it pained him, he decided to indulge his friend just to see that smile that was so often hidden from everyone.
With what little awareness he still had, he attempted to move his head to see that he had now entered a room with nurses surrounding him. Hands moved and turned him every which way, needles were inserted in his veins, oxygen was moved in his lungs, and the sudden beeping that began beside him removed any peace and quiet he would’ve likely gotten without it.
John was fairly hesitant at the unwarranted touch and what he knew what the man was looking to find, and likely would. The mangled mass of discolored flesh sitting at the crest of his shoulder, the look of it so appalling to John that he hardly worked without a shirt anymore as he could not stand for another person to see it. Yet the very idea of showing this man, this
Sherlock had to let out a groan as he attempted to swim past him, but he was blocked with every attempt he made.
“There is a car waiting for you two to take you back home. I’m sure you will want to go home and light a fire.”
There is nothing you have not seen before? Hm, I'd challenge you on that but I dont know if you'd do a long fic (4,000+ words). Soooo, my other suggestion is John finds out that Sherlock sleepwalks and have odd conversations with the doctor. This leads to a love confession or something. If Sherlock is pulled from his sleepwalk, he tends to get violent. I imagine he punched John square in the face because John accidentally woke him, lol
“…Figure out what, might I ask?”
>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“You know waiting here all day in the sun is not good for your health, brother mine.”
“I… I apologise, I shouldn’t have…” His hand began to slip from John’s shoulder, letting it trail down the man’s chest as he wagered whether or not to walk away now and attempt to avoid him for the foreseeable future, when a calloused yet gentle hand was placed along his cheek and he was pulled back to this heavenly embrace between them as their mouths met once again.
He did his best to dig his heels into the stone building and drag the line back up to him, praying that she didn’t look up to see him and alert everyone within a two-block radius; he let out most of the air in his lungs as she walked right past him and turned the corner.
Where his legs should have been, a long fish tail reached down to the water with shimmering scales that seemed to shift from a navy blue, to black, to an almost aubergine colour when the light hit them, sat in place of his lower appendages.
Small growls were exchanged between them until Sherlock took it into his hands to get out of his seat no matter what. This solution ended up being a headbutt to John’s nose, which caused John’s immediate reaction to be a punch to the face that knocked the man to the side.
“Alright. What is it?”
He couldn’t remember what happened between that moment and the moment where he watched the paramedics move Sherlock onto a gurney, attach a neck brace to him and carried him into the ambulance. He didn’t pay much attention to the criminal that caused all of this, he apparently lived but was bashed up enough to be placed chemically unconscious.
“You know, Mrs. Hudson will be leaving next week to visit her sister for a few days…”
John began to understand the use of the word intimacy as he felt truly hot under the collar, and everywhere else for that matter. Although he didn’t understand how it seemed intimate to Sherlock, until he felt the gentle scrape of teeth against his skin that were soon soothed by the small licks to the newly reddened areas.
“Speaking of gifts, I have one for you.”
“Is your tail feeling okay?”
Mycroft still did not move, and instead only softened his expression in an attempt to appeal to his younger brother.
“next time, don’t think you can’t call me about something like this. We’re a team Sherlock, I don’t want you to think you can’t tell me when you think you need help.”
The bartender interrupted what would likely have become an exceedingly bloody battle, and John reluctantly relented as he released his grip of Mycroft’s arm and took a step back from him. He couldn’t help the self-satisfied sensation he had in the pit in his stomach when he saw the way Mycroft almost fell to the floor and pulled his arm to his chest.
“Hey John…”
The room went quiet again as John pulled away from Sherlock only slightly to look at him. The look in his eyes was enough to settle the thought that was bubbling to the surface.
“Your loyalty will be the death of you, Watson. I’m only here to give you fair warning of that.” He had just made his way out the door, and John went to close it with a sharp thud when Lestrade’s boot stopped it.
It wasn’t good enough though, as John’s expression went from an exhausted contentment to concern as something about Sherlock’s face did not sit right with him. “Sherlock, I know you probably don’t want to talk about this now, but… How did this happen?”
The two met one another’s lips with an unbridled passion that lead to Sherlock wrapping his arms around the expanse of John’s back. It was hardly shocking when John lifted Sherlock from the dock with ease to sit him in his lap, the abandoned velvet box was soon stripped of its contents and was now settled on Sherlock’s wrist.
John only received stares from both of them as his fingers moved up to Sherlock’s curls once again. I was likely to become a nervous habit if he wasn’t careful, but the way Mycroft looked incredulously at him was enough to let his fingers move.
“Hey, it’s alright. Just… I know you’re sensitive about your tail, but I just want you to take care of yourself. I don’t what I’d do if…”
John could hardly exit the coach fast enough; a random toss of money was thrown to the cabbie as he sprinted inside and hovered by the lobby door until he saw the man drive off.
“Do you maybe want to explain what the hell happened last night?”
“Damnit…” John pushed himself up from the dock and threw his jacket and shoes to join Sherlock’s in a pile, he was just about to follow Sherlock’s lead and jump in, when Lestrade gripped his arm to stop him.
“Don’t apologise, let’s just go to bed. Okay?” John linked his hand with Sherlock’s and took a moment to gather himself before he began to walk hand and hand to Sherlock’s bedroom.
The next movement was gentle, yet without hesitation as their lips met and each could describe as if the world had come to a halt. The rapid beat in John’s chest would only crescendo as the feeling of gentle hands on his skin, heated breaths, and soft lips against his filled his senses until the delightful touch retreated, as Holmes pressed his forehead to John’s, needing to catch his breath.
The nerves Sherlock had earlier felt began to fade as the light drag of John’s fingertips against the pale skin of his back, a hidden twinkle appeared on his face at hearing how much he enjoyed the book.
“John, I’m always-“
He was silenced by a swift kiss before he had time to let his mind wander on the subject further. The lovely light buzz that accompanied their connection was almost too indulgent and before he could pull away to catch up with himself, John pulled away just to attach his lips to the pristine skin of his shoulder.
He sat back down beside John and opened the kit up, a few minutes of staring at everything prompted John to intervene before they were there all night.
Mycroft let out a slight groan as he set his cane down and listened to the waves crash against the craggily rocks beneath them.
Over the last few months, Sherlock’s experiments had begun to get out of hand. They spread throughout the kitchen and often into their sitting room to where John often found himself waking up to the smell of burning hair, or would find the dishes needed extra sanitization after he left eyeballs on them for too long.
"It is quite confusing, it's more like... It is a lot more like an emotional bond that doesn't exactly become whole until it's reciprocated than just a mark that says "you're mine and no one else can have you". For example, if John did not feel the same way (Or if he were to suddenly die very unexpectedly) the marks would begin to fade. The reason they do continue to darken is because this feeling is reciprocated and John feels the same, if not more for Sherlock.
Lestrade let out a soft sigh as he set the items on Sherlock’s desk, he made his way to the bed and gently tapped Sherlock on the shoulder.
“Mycroft, please don’t do this to him. I cannot live without him…”
When he was finally free of the constricting garments that had fallen to the floor in a wet heap near the bathroom door, he managed to find a nightshirt within the bags he still had not bothered to empty.
“Mycroft, what is going on?”
“You know, I’d still like for you to stop bringing so many body parts home.”
“See you tomorrow.” Sherlock pulled him for one last hug for the night, never paying attention to the pain that ran through his left arm as he had John in them after so long without it, and he was not about to complain.
It all came to a head at one point when he felt his nose brush against John’s shoulder just out of habit, which seemed to drag away that pain and agony that easily could have lasted hours, and left him with only a groggy feeling that settled within his stomach. In reality, this torture had likely lasted longer than thirty minutes, but he had found himself settled within a comfortable space, and allowed his mind to focus only on that.
Sherlock quickly shot up at the sound of John’s shouting, and hurriedly attempted to pull the blanket off his head only to see him laying on the floor and holding his mouth.
He gave John that same smile as he slipped on his coat, making his way to the door before he turned to shake John’s hand. “I think you’ll do very well here. Again, just let me know if you need anything,” John was about to respond with a friendly goodbye when Sherlock pulled him close by their intertwined hands to speak softly into his ear. A small shiver ran through John’s spine at how eerily similar the feeling was to the threat the man had made to him just the previous morning.
“John, what’s going on?”
“You cannot be serious; we are not leaving you here to get shot at.”
The reinvigorating scent of salt-stained air hit their senses before their eyes became adapted to the natural sunlight. Their disorientated motions were too noticeable in broad daylight that they surely attracted attention, yet there was no sound of alerted guards or sirens. Absolute silence filled its place instead.
Sherlock eventually managed to pull away from John’s shoulder enough to rub his eyes. The sudden intensity of light to his sight drew him back to John and he couldn’t help but hold him close again.
“Hello, brother mine.”
He turned back to his merman who looked back at him with a sudden worry in his surprisingly expressive eyes. He pressed one last quick kiss to John’s lips and hastily spoke once again.
John simply grinned and pressed another quick kiss to his lips. “I hardly think it’s trouble to see you smile.”
Mycroft was already making himself comfortable in his desk chair when Sherlock turned back to him, the slight creak the object made practically impending its breakage. “So, what is this time, brother? 12… no, 15 pounds?”
John backed away from him as he came to the horrible conclusion that finally caused him to see through this pompous façade. The red hair, and that pale skin…
The movement was subtle, and many others would have claimed that there was nothing there, but the many years of trying to avoid being shot at made him keenly paranoid of even slight movements.
He had just tucked the book under his arm and swam out of his cave when he was greeted with possibly the most displeasing sight of the day; Mycroft.
This managed to silence Mycroft, even if it was just for a moment. They sat in an awkward quiet for far too long, Sherlock was just about to leave and go back home to fall into a comatose state, when Mycroft irritatingly spoke up again.
John soon shut his front door behind him with a sigh as he dropped the groceries to the floor and had to take a breath. He was certainly not going to be doing that again, no matter how much they needed a tin of beans.
They remained in each other’s arms for a little, or what they could both manage, until Sherlock’s breathing calmed.
“And I suppose coming home with you is also not a possibility?”
“John, it’s fine.” He laid a gentle hand on top of the one John had rested on his face, a still slightly shaking finger ran over the man’s faintly bruised knuckles from the last time this happened and kept his hand close to him as John continued to lightly move the pack every once in awhile to keep the distribution even.
Sherlock placed the small bag in his hand and watched as it disappeared within one of the pockets of his coat, likely to be properly thrown away later with Molly as an assistant. Wonderful, that was the last thing he needed.
He allowed his eyes to close for just a moment as his hand continued its own ministrations, the idea of what had caused such a predicament wormed its way into his thoughts as the vision of sinfully full lips and stunningly angled features were the first to come to mind.
He had to be correct, even with the crashing waves that obstructed his view, he thought he could see the faintest sight of ebony curls that peaked over the rock every so often.
Sherlock finally gave up attempting to get a decent moment of rest, and threw off his blanket. The smile he received from the guard only made him want to go back under again.
This jar, this insignificant little jar of blood that replaced his missing jam was the breaking point. This all was getting out of hand and he was not about to deal with this anymore; for God’s sake, this was his flat too!
He hardly felt the man’s fingers move into his hair and turn his head to look at him until his eyes met Sherlock’s hardly open ones. “Your thoughts are deafening, John. What’s on your mind…”
Reading had become common place for his sleepless nights, as it became a nice challenge to help him fall asleep and, in this case, it helped to settle his mind.
The slightest hint of a smile graced Sherlock’s features as his hand moved to rest along his shoulder. Light brushes of his fingers against the dark marks on his skin, and the swift return of the feeling just a moment later gave him some relief that John was still alright.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
His movements were swift and elegant, seeming to float rather than walk as he stood in front of the shorter man and looked him over. Paying no mind to the screams around them. “Join my crew.”
>>>>>>>>>>>>
He finally turned his attention back to his phone when he heard the unceremonious screams of Greg on the other end.
He noticed only too late when he heard the muffled noise of shouting from the upper deck, the thunderous sound of footsteps running towards his door as the same young man he had just treated came barreling through it. “There… There is a ship in distress spotted a hundred yards away, the captain wishes everyone available to assist...”
“What happened last night?”
Mycroft let out a small tut as if Sherlock was still a small child, which he most likely still saw him as, and therefore he was superior. “Now Sherlock, surely you are intelligent enough to figure that out. You are a fugitive pirate and I was aboard a naval ship, what might we conclude from that?”
This comment was clearly amusing to Mycroft as a melodious chuckle escaped his throat and he took a sip of his whiskey when the drinks arrived. “I occupy a minor position in the British government. It hardly gives me a remarkable social standing. I decided to bring you here because I believe you know my brother.”
He quietly groaned as he moved to rub his eyes open, glancing up to Lestrade with a tired smile as he stood up to dress without a second thought of the awkward situation between the two other men in the room.
“I am sure. it doesn’t give me much interest, and I believe it deserves to be read by someone who will appreciate it.”
“May I see this one?”
“I think we’ll stay here for a moment, if everything is settled with him?”
“Oh my… Oh good lord you’re…”
The doctor thought for a moment at what he was getting himself into. Turning against his country to become an outlaw on the open ocean, possibly never returning home without his head on a pike, he could feel the mental agony he was going to give himself and before he could stop, he heard himself say “Alright, I’ll join your crew.”
“No, nonononono-“
“Sorry, I should’ve asked-“
A slight smirk grew on John’s face at the question, taking the brief pause to brush a curl from Sherlock’s face. “Possibly, many years ago.”
“Oh? And what was this conversation about?” Sherlock soon sat up and rested on his elbow, his free hand kept its place with John’s on his hip.
“I just… I couldn’t blame you for moving out after everything that happened and with Rosie… I didn’t take into account how… lonely I would be, if that’s the right word for it. It started getting out of hand again a few weeks ago, I um… There was a lull in cases and I didn’t have anything to stop my minding from… John, I’m sorry. I really am, I just didn’t know what to do and-“
“I must say sir, If I didn’t know better, I would assume that you were a writer.”
“No, no it’s fine. Yeah, let’s go.” He pressed another kiss to Sherlock’s cheek and gave him a tired smile. Sherlock returned the same, and they continued to walk together until they shut the door behind them, turned out the light, and curled up underneath the covers. With Sherlock curled up on John’s side and his body wrapped tightly around his arm.
John eventually needed to break the kiss after some minutes or he feared he would become unconscious; it did not help that blood was rushing much faster to other places than his head.
“I am happy to see you too. I quite expected you to be long gone when I came, I’m sorry to have kept you waiting…”
John looked around him and nearly fell off the dock many times to see underneath it, it was only when he was about to give up and return to the plan of alerting the proper authorities, when he looked up and met those piercing blue eyes and that sweet smile as the man leaned his upper torso onto the dock.
Sherlock watched with batted breath as the guard broke through the men holding him back and he charged forward, the movement slowed in his head as he waited for the right moment to move.
“That is not the point, Mycroft. You of all people, someone who hardly comes to visit me because you claim it’s too far, suddenly is up on land even with the constant siren that is your voice that constantly says ‘I despise legwork’.”
Victor turned his attention to the faint voice that called out to him and looked around until he saw the crop of dark curls and light eyes that crossed his vision.
“Oh.. are we?..”
John Watson gains a new job oppurtunity.
He eventually nestled into his bed, the gentle touch of seaweed underneath him and the rhythmic currents that ran over his skin settled his nerves for the next day before he managed drifted off to sleep.
Men began to run in every direction possible, many ran to reach for the wheel to turn them away to make an escape, but it was too late. The ship was so close, so close that John was able to see the dark oxblood coloured writing on the side labeling the ship as
He let himself lean over just slightly, and fully expected the man to be exposed there as well, but what he found was nothing like he could have thought of.
“…Why?”
The two reveled in the peaceful moment in the other’s arms as John allowed Sherlock to sleep a little longer he continued his quiet admiration of his lover’s tranquil self until it was rudely disrupted by the rapid knocking on the cabin’s door.
He turned back to John, a slight anxiety hanging between them once again as it was down to Greg’s decision. John held the note tighter than he would’ve care to as their eyes met and the softness in the man’s eyes that met his own gave him more relief than any glass of water could have even in the most arid of places.
“I can and I will, Sherlock. We’ve been through hell together; do you really think I’ll let you go after everything we’ve done? You won’t be alone; I can promise you that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The night sky was in its rarity tonight. It could possibly be the only time any of them had ever actually seen a vast array of stars in central London, but that didn’t seem important at the moment while they ran through a rain-soaked alley and chased a criminal wanted for three counts of murder.
“Hey, hey, don’t try to move too much.” The same hand rested on Sherlock’s side and carefully righted his position in bed. A quick movement of wires and he was right back where he started, with his gaze now locked on John’s own.
“That is the last time someone locks me in a bloody room again!”
“Why are you complaining about this now? You’ve never once acted like this was an issue!”
“I certainly hope you don’t plan to publish this; I would not mind reading it, but I cannot imagine what the general public would think.”
John did as requested, starting up his pace again to both their delight as a low groan escaped his throat. His head soon coming to rest in the crook Sherlock’s neck and nibble on the salty tasting skin, he quickly let out a small groan as the action caused Holmes’ hand to grip hair and pull. John’s hand moved much quicker after that.
Sherlock took notice of his new appendages a little later when he removed his head from its contented resting place, and stared down at them as though he had never seen anything like them before. He unconsciously allowed a hand to move over the pale, smooth skin and drew his legs up to his chest before he turned his attention to John with one of the happiest smiles, he had ever seen him have. It was practically contagious.
Sherlock had taken up the tiresome task that morning of being nice and deciding to get the groceries for once. He didn’t let onto the fact that he was somewhat banned from most of the shopping centers in their area and had to travel around an hour away just to find a suitable store.
John braced himself on the desk and pulled his body up from the floor, feeling as if his legs became two useless masses as he narrowed his eyes to give an illusion of confidence that he did not have. “Not really, why do you ask?”
Sherlock could hardly sit still as he began to scramble around him before he began to shove Victor out with less care than he usually gave him.
Sherlock let out a small sigh before he winced at the icy touch of the pack pressed against his already sore cheek.
“Sherlock, there are a lot of things you think I don’t want to know. Right now, I want to know what drove you to start using again.”
He moved to sit down in the living room, and momentarily muted the television, much to Rosie’s displeasure.
Relief was hardly the word for it as he straightened himself up and stretched until he felt himself freeze in place. In every ordinary way a man walked, they lifted up their cane alternatively, while John leaned very heavily on it. This, coupled with the significant weight difference between John and whoever this was… He felt the cold grip of a hand against his shoulder before he had the chance to get away.
“Sherlock?”
He somehow managed to find his way to a cigarette case that was hidden away and lit it with trembling fingers before he threw the match into the fireplace. The smoke that engorged every inch of his lungs quieted his thoughts as he returned to his chair.
He opened the box to find the delicate bracelet sat inside, in place of the rather dull and blackened stone that used to sit within the fingers, sat a lovely pale blue gem cut in a pleasing circle with so many edges that no matter which way you turned it, it would glitter when the sun hit it.
“I just remembered something.”
London was absolutely bustling with life that next morning as John made his way down the street. The many shops he passed by never held anything of interest, until he set his sights on a small jewellery shop that he hadn’t seen before.
It was quiet for a moment, Sherlock’s hand had stopped within the tangle it had created, until he gave the smallest nod he could possibly give.
It took every last morsel of his being to hold his composure as John turned away from him, passing Lestrade and his cabin,
“What do you mean is that all? I did what you wanted, I told you how I felt about him. Isn’t that enough?”
John let out a small huff before he collected his thoughts and went to go find anything useful. He looked through his wardrobe and the best he could find was the finger splint he used when he messed up his index finger. He was for once grateful that it was a thinner part of Sherlock’s tail that was broken, otherwise he’s would’ve had to build a new bloody splint.
“Yes, I’m sure I could have...”
“Sherlock!”
“Sherl-ock
No one stopped to turn back to Mycroft, to check on the guard that now laid dead on the cobblestone laden ground, nothing else seemed to matter in that moment.
“I do, I’m afraid it has been an all too common occurrence. Speaking of proper medical attention, how is your hand?”
The bedroom door was firmly shut when John practically pinned the taller man to it when he wouldn’t even attempt to face him.
He glanced behind himself every so often, and he swore he could see that the breeze blew silky and ink-coloured curls back into his view from behind the stone that peaked from the sea.
They stayed in that position for a little while, the gentle embrace was enough for them at the moment until John’s knees began to get tired and Sherlock moved to stand up, a gentle tug on John’s arm was enough to tell him to follow.
Lestrade stood still for a moment before he turned to John to gesture for him to open the letter. John could feel all eyes of the crew on him as he delicately unfolded the parchment and attempted to read the hastily scribbled and hardly legible writing.
“Oi! What the hell is going on here?”
“It’s just a few things I noticed about you. You carry the somewhat typical dexterity of a doctor; it was fairly easy to see from the way you made the sandwiches and cut the fruit. You also have stitching on your coat that show a typical surgical stitch that you would likely know.”
This is what Victor first concluded when he stopped by for a visit and came to see the destruction that Sherlock’s home had undergone. He hurriedly swam inside and attempted to look through the cave to see if he could tell what had happened. Animals had a habit of swimming in unannounced in the middle of the night, perhaps this was another case of a shark mistaking this cave for a sunken ship.
Thank you again to Shadowsoul_954 for suggesting I should continue this story as I now have so many new ideas for the future of it
“But what if it
“Sherlock, what is going on with you this morning?” He placed a hand on Sherlock’s shoulder, only for the man to yank it from underneath him as if he was disgusted by his touch.
“Careful.”
“I did not travel out into the middle of the ocean to have a spat with you, Sherlock.”
“My name is Sherlock. meet me here tomorrow, please…”
“I suppose… I suppose you would like to understand why I was in Captain Holmes’ bed this morning. I can explain everything- “
“Yeah?”
“Sherlock?”
The movement was subtle, and many others would have claimed that there was nothing there, but the many years of attempting to avoid being shot at made him keenly paranoid of even the slightest movements.
None of what he said seemed to help however, as Sherlock merely looked away from him for a moment. John didn’t realise how much his words affected him until he saw Sherlock’s Adam’s apple tremble in his throat.
“John…Please…”
His brother went still for a moment, another cigarette had found its way to his lips and his lighter sat limply in his palm as he allowed the smoke from his lungs to blow out between them.
Sherlock gave a small nod at the now seemingly forgotten incident and the domestic tune the conversation had now taken. He was just about to make his way downstairs when John took his hand in his own once again.
“What the… Sherlock did you put all of it away?”
John once again pulled Sherlock closer to himself, a comforting hand trailed down Sherlock’s spine as John could almost sense the nervousness that ran through him.
It was now John’s turn to look confused at such a bold and brash statement that he could be so certain of. He took this quite obvious bait and leaned forward just slightly to listen to him. “And how would you know that?”
John finally looked up from his bed to meet Sherlock’s gaze, the indescribable look that graced his face was enough to tell him that he his prediction couldn’t be farther from correct.
Sherlock had sat that next day along the dock with a book in his lap as he watched the sun rise. He made sure to arrive much earlier than necessary as he did not want another repeat of yesterday.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No wonder you’re here, you’re a pain in the arse.”
Hopefully that helped, I feel I'm absolutely terrible at explaining this process that's really in my own head and I've never had to put it into words"
He didn’t receive a response, which was fairly normal for their conversations. He decided to let it go as he was probably just thirsty, and turned back to his computer. Content with just letting him get what he needed without bothering him. That would have been a possibility, if not for the fact that Sherlock began to mumble under his breath.
(See the end of the chapter for
“…aw, damn it!”
John looked up from where his head had fallen and back up to where Sherlock continued to stare at him. The look of fear and anxiety that previously stayed on his face had melted away into a more serene expression that John had only seen when Sherlock had passed out on the couch.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
“I know Sherlock, have you found a case that’s at least a six?”
“Heh, you’ve seemed to knock my center off.”
John took a chancing glance towards Sherlock’s lower half and watched with nervous anticipation as he saw the slight twitches beneath the blanket. It easily could still be his tail, inflamed and aching with the slightest touch, but he took the risk and began to pull the blanket away.
“Sherlock, could you please just drop whatever this is and tell me what’s going on?”
“Don’t touch me.”
The man seemed to beam at this news at him being correct, as a quick splash underneath him seemed to signify his legs kicked with happiness. Except… this dock had to be at least eight feet from the water, and unless this man was truly longer than that, there was something going on here.
Sherlock stood there for a moment before he held him back, wrapping his arms around him as his face quickly pressed into the man’s shoulder. A trembling that started in his shoulders and moved throughout his entire body when he registered that he truly was with him again.
The supple touch of his lips against John’s was enough to leave john boneless, it led John to lean into the silk like texture of the man’s skin that seemed to draw him in and made him never want to leave it.
His hand instead enveloped his entire wrist to pull it close to his chest, a slight trembling grew in his throat, but he soon swallowed it in order to speak.
He picked one of the many books placed into the stone and moved back to sit on his bed. The gentle glow of the lanterns gave him the sight to try and turn the pages, that seemed to want to fall apart at every opportunity, but he wouldn’t allow it.
Sherlock laid down beside him and ran his fingers through John’s hair, wiping away a few drops of sweat from his face before he placed a kiss to his temple.
The tingle seemed unnatural for him, possibly even worrying, yet he could not help the instinct that caused him to run his fingers over the soft skin. It made a small smile grow on his face, even if he was not entirely sure of why he had such a reaction.
John seemed frozen to the ground as the crew cheered in celebration and lifted him up, the swift movement unnerving to his head as he attempted to catch up with the world around him.
Wow, I am honestly so glad to be back after a week of not writing. This is going to be a fairly short chapter, but I decided since I missed last week's post, I am going to post chapter four sometime later this week. I hope you enjoy this chapter!
He almost didn’t pick up the light footsteps that made their way from Sherlock’s room, past the bathroom, and into the kitchen. His attention was only drawn away from his computer screen when the kitchen light turned on and he saw Sherlock stood in the middle of the room, facing the cooktop.
John looked around himself and nearly fell off the dock many times to see beneath it, it was only when he was about to give up once again and return to the plan of alerting the proper authorities, that he looked up and met those piercing blue eyes and that sweet smile as the man leaned his upper torso up onto the dock.
It was now Sherlock’s turn to wake up early that next day, the discussion he had with John the previous night did not sit well with him. He was somewhat relieved that was able to talk to someone he could trust, but he was infuriated above all else at Lestrade for confronting John on something that was certainly none of his business.
Sherlock quickly slapped a hand over Mycroft’s mouth, his teeth tightly gritted together as he had a slight grip on his face. “Do not finish that sentence if you value your fingers, Mycroft. He’s just our doctor, that is it.”
Lestrade’s smile grew as he placed a hand on his shoulder and led him to the door. Both of them pulled it open to witness the crew just standing around, seeming unsure of what to do with themselves now that their captain was missing.
“Yes… I am looking for a gift for someone, particularly a piece of jewellery, but I am unsure of what could be of interest.”
A small shiver of repulsion ran through Sherlock at the reminder that he lived away from the rest of their pod. He knew Mycroft had a very similar situation to his, but he seemed to constantly draw attention to the fact that Sherlock was especially alone.
and took John’s hand to lead him into his bedroom.
“But… It is true, correct?”
They were so close to the door, and John was so tempted to run out and find his own path to the dock by himself, but something did not settle with him. It all felt too simple, too put together.
“John, again I’m so sorry-“
Sherlock let out a small sigh as he crossed his arms over his chest. He couldn’t stand anymore of the lying, especially if it was done as terribly as John was managing.
He quickly ran his hands over his face as he knew he was over thinking this, and quickly rose to get dressed. He took a scrutinizing gaze over the barely touched meal when he made his way over to it, reminding himself to ask of Sherlock’s eating habits later when he had the time.
“Yeah, and then I left for a week to go visit my sister in rehab and Lestrade calls me and tells me that you showed up to a crime scene delirious and obviously high as a kite. You can’t fool him Sherlock, he’s seen you at your lowest more than anyone else.”
What he was able to do was roll over to face the small cave opening that sat beside his bed, which at least gave him more of a view.
The consequence of him staying however, was the mumbling began again.
It was days later when John came home after work to find Sherlock leaned up against the kitchen counter while he drank a cup of tea. His tail was surprisingly immobile as he took small sips from his drink.
such a sensitive part of him was not making him want to run and hide.
It was rather difficult for John to manage the task of covertly covering his mouth in order to hide the distinct
“mm, yeah I guess I do.” He was eventually able to lift his head up enough for Sherlock to help him stand, before he needed to grab a nearby table for balance.
They were so close to the boarding ramp that was placed on the pier, their vision seemingly dead set on making it there that they never heard the commotion behind them. The sound of men being pushed aside and struggling until they heard the sound of Mycroft yelling after them; the sound was desperate and anxious as it always was whenever he found the courage to raise his voice.
Sherlock went quiet for a while as he watched Mycroft take a long inhale of his cigarette, then looked to him and handed it over. Sherlock took it, drew in a deep breath of the smoke that billowed from it, and put it out beside him as if he’d done it a hundred times before. He never was sure if he liked them or not, and he often checked to see if his decision had changed.
By 6 pm he had himself anxiously flipping through the book pages again, his eyes never read a single word as he kept looking over his shoulder every two minutes.
It almost felt too quiet as Sherlock ignored John for the rest of the day without so much as a conversation starter during any point to try and break the tension.
John slowly came to moments later when the quivering throughout his body had mostly subsided, and he emerged from his bed to make his way to the washroom.
“But Sherlock-“
“Oh, I wouldn’t know if we did, I’ve never seen one. I mainly try to read books that I find, they do help quite a bit.” He drew his attention back to the book that resided beside him and handed it to John. It was still soaked in water, but the sun had already dried a few parts of it off.
“Yes, yes I’m quite alright... I suppose it is still sensitive is all. Nothing to worry about.” He waved his hand off to the side as he attempted to calm his rapid heartrate, not understanding the sudden bout of emotion he underwent just from an innocent touch; such an insignificant thing sent him into a spiral of heat that made him want to dive into the ocean to escape it.
It seemed to be a perfectly wonderful day beside the beach. Men and women walked along the seaside, and the women hid underneath their parasols while their children abandoned shoes and books to dip their toes into the foaming ocean spray.
He had to think of something, after all this time he was not going leave John to die for his sake and due to his own negligence. He couldn’t lose him now, not after everything. He had to do something!
Another sigh escaped Mycroft’s throat as he turned to see his brother, a man so defined by his cold understanding and rational, reduced to tears over some pathetic human.
. The bunks were orderly and neatly folded, with trunks for each man and their personal belongings. Small flickers of light from burning candles on nightstands were their only source of light as John was led to his own bed.
Sherlock hardly flinched when he heard him approach, and turned to look to him. “Hello again.”
This seemed to soothe him fairly quickly, as Sherlock ducked his head underneath the blanket and settled there for a while. John did not know why and he wasn’t planning on asking.
The men began to change course towards the ship as a crew member located in the crow's nest looked to see if there was any crew aboard the ship. As he looked, he reported seeing many a men lying on the deck covered in blood, none of them seemingly left alive. They were around 50 yards away when they saw a man run into view, duck behind the flag staff and lowered the flag.
beneath his breath as he made his way over with the bag and blanket, he had carried with him. Even with his previous hesitation towards what was about to occur, it was still better than having to watch Sherlock and his lover be intimate in front of him.
The pain grew significantly worse after that, it felt as though fire had crawled through every muscle within his lower half. Muscles he hardly knew of constricted, the joints of his tail fused, and the fins of his tails seemed to tremble in the air as Sherlock’s nails found themselves clawed into the sleeve of John’s coat while he was hardly able to hold back a cry of pain.
He soon set the book down and went to lay down, this usually meant that he needed to help a tiny snail that had somehow wandered its way up to his bed, and set it on the small opening in the stone that provided a way outside.
He’d barely laid his head down on his pillow before he fell asleep. The soft fabric around him could not allow for more comfort as the troubles of the day already began to melt away, until his phone began to ring.
Sherlock gave him another smile at that, and they soon remained quiet as the last few rays of the sun disappeared beneath the waves and plunged the world into darkness. They curled up closer to one another once this occurred, the far-off roads behind them began to illuminate as the street lamps were lit.
“You’re rather captivating like this, this early in the morning.”
A shiver ran up the back of John’s neck caused him to turned back to the edge of the port to see if anyone was staring at him. He saw no one, and turned his attention to water, where he saw the reflection of pale arms settled in the water with dark curls that wavered in the reflection against the murky deep.
“Yes, I guess that’s what I’m attempting to say,” He finally had to take a seat beside the bed as he took another glance at Sherlock to see if he was opposed to the idea or not.
That managed to get a slight smile from Sherlock even through their argument, even through his supposed rage, that smile still managed to soften John in ways he hated and adored all at once. it was enough for Sherlock to know that John’s anger had rather subsided for the moment. He took this opportunity to lean in and pressed a hesitant kiss to his lips, hoping that would deplete the last of his irritation with him.
He had just about made it to the dock, the light of the day nearly gone along with his hope that John would still be there, when a rock dropped down into the water next to his head and swiftly sunk to the ocean floor.
It was very easy to agree with what Sherlock was asking as no matter how much concern he held for his flat mate, it would always be dulled by the small flame of anger that built in his chest at seeing the complete lack of respect Sherlock held for himself. It couldn’t have been an easier choice.
John stopped in his ministrations to stare at Sherlock, a very obvious look of shock graced the doctor’s features even when he thought he hid it well. It was rather endearing to Sherlock.
John then turned his gaze back to Lestrade, his scrutinizing eye seeing the level composure the man held for such a statement. “Is that some kind of threat?”
“Damn it.” Sherlock took a deep breath as he ran to the side of the ship, pulling out a small telescope he kept in his pocket, and looked through it to the ship. A small growl escaping his throat when he saw unmistakably plump and tall figure of his brother.
“Thank you, Sherlock. I know this wasn’t easy. How about we go downstairs and order takeout for supper?”
Sherlock swiftly left the room after that. A loud slam from his door signaled that he didn’t want to hear from John for the rest of the day, let alone the rest of the week. John let out a small sigh as he set his paper down and rested his head on a hand.
He began to swim out of the cave, when Sherlock got ahold of his wrist and pulled him back inside.
The room was quiet for a moment as both of them took in another puff of their cigarettes, the frightfully calm demeanor in the man’s voice threw Sherlock off his game. He let out another breath of smoke, watching it curl and blow away in the wind as he allowed it to calm his nerves.
“I have not seen you in days, is it not normal for brothers to spend time with one another?”
“The bees, John! The bees are the answer!”
“I have to go now, and I’m sure you will need to get ready as well. I’ll see you soon.” He pressed another kiss to his cheek as he stood up, motioning for John to indulge in his virtually untouched breakfast as he slipped his jacket on and quickly left after that.
“Alright?”
John made his way into the kitchen and slammed the refrigerator door closed before Sherlock could grab the milk.
“I wouldn’t have the slightest clue as to why. I never have understood any of the decisions he has made in his life, including you. Now, if you’ll come with me, we’ll take a cab to the dock.”
flat mate told him he was just dreaming and that nothing he was seeing was real. He was not about to sit by and go through that.
John looked up to meet his eye, the sudden grip Sherlock had on his hand was enough to keep that gaze.
“See? It’s already swelling. I’ll get something for it later, it’ll help with the swelling and pain…”
“Do not play coy with me, Dr. Watson. You may think that I merely remain an unseeing fool who follows Holmes’ orders, but I saw you last night on deck. There is no hiding the fact you have started something with Sherlock that is far more trouble than you’re worth.”
When I wrote there is nothing I haven't seen, there really isn't. Do not be shy to comment me a suggestion!
“John, I, I can’t do it- It, god- it, it feels like I’m on fire…”
“…What do you mean?”
John could only let out a shaking breath as his gaze turned down once again to the bed. His stare only lingered on it for a moment before he returned to look back to Sherlock with an unstable gaze.
“John, you don’t want to know that…”
Sherlock let out a small huff and smiled at him as he pressed the book closer to John’s chest.
“Just pick up the little cotton pads right there- yeah, those. Then get the peroxide… It’s the small white bottle with Peroxide written on it. Okay, then just soak the cotton in peroxide.”
A sharp gasp escaped Sherlock’s throat as the light scrape of teeth reddened his skin and tender laps of his tongue ran over the hardly there marks, that would evidently grow darker as the days passed until one could scarcely deny their existence.
“Yes, there is Sherlock! This stuff could kill you, how the hell do you not understand that after all this time?”
Sherlock had to let out a groan as he attempted to swim past him, but he was blocked with every attempt he made.
“Well then, it seems like the perfect time for you to start again.”
“Take your time.”
Oh dear, I do believe I am really starting to enjoy these two as a pairing. Do let me know what you think of this story, and if you like it and have your own ideas of how to continue their story, you are perfectly allowed to suggest something.
He could not seem to help the smile that appeared on his face as he made his way along the sea-stained wood, and sat down beside him.
His answer came back in the quietest tone he’d ever heard John’s voice take on, it gave the impression of a small baby sparrow that looked towards its mother and wondered whether if it would be pushed out of the nest, or be fed.
He let out a broken sigh as his sight must beginning to go as well as his nerves. He settled back down on the dock; his cane mockingly laid beside him as he gazed down into the water that waded in against a barnacle covered pole. It must have just been a bundle of seaweed is all, a clump of weeds that were sucked away by the current when he looked away.
Held cupped his head in his hands, the tremor was apparent in his fingers as hot tears blurred his vision. He needed a moment to wipe them away before he had enough courage to grab a small mirror from his pocket and held it to his lover’s mouth.
Do let me know what you think of this story, I am always grateful for constructive criticism or just what you thought
“Tell me what exactly has brought you to need my assistance.”
“I can… I can’t move it..” His cup soon fell from his hand and tea soaked into the carpet as he attempted to stand. His legs swiftly gave away from underneath him and he fell to the floor, Mrs. Hudson’s cries for help were the last things he heard before his vision went dark.
“I also observed a minor tremor in your hand as you sutured up mine, now I have a theory about this. Would you mind if I?..” He placed his hand gently on the man’s forearm, looking to John as he wasn’t going to continue until he gave his permission.
What he saw instead seemed to rouse him from his happy stupor as he sat up again to see the sight of his old friend that swam by. Auburn hair, dark blue eyes, a thin wiry frame much like Sherlock’s own, and a pale complexion that made him unmistakably recognisable as his old friend which he hadn’t seen for many years.
“…How do you know about him?”
The hallway that greeted him was the same one he’d stared at for the last few days. The darkened stone only lit by dimming torches that lined the walls and seemed to accentuate the dirt and other unnamable substances that coated the stone.
“I see we must’ve struck gold on this ship, seeing as you have an actual doctor on board instead of a drunken barber. He might be quite useful.” He soon turned his gaze back to John as he stood by the fore mast, that same grin on his face as he watched John’s jaw drop.
They both let out a sigh in unison, but made no attempt to release one another from each other’s arms. It wasn’t until Sherlock rested his head back on John’s shoulder that he finally decided to speak up.
He then turned his attention to John, the sheer resolved look he held on his features only added to the need for him to get him on the damn boat.
“Mm, a little of this, a little of that. Don’t worry John, it is completely controlled so there’s nothing to worry about.”
“Thank you. I know you don't enjoy taking my advice."
The look of hurt he received in return made him rethink his statement, and the way Sherlock laid down on the dock and curled up in on himself made Mycroft walk back over and sit down beside him. A light brush through Sherlock’s curls caused the merman beside him to curl up tighter and let out a pained whimper as though he was a shot animal.
He received a few pats on his shoulder as he tried to stay out of the general merriment as he usually did, that didn’t last long as he was practically pounced on by a relatively young man by the look of his features, yet with silvering hair and a generous smile. “Hello John, I don’t believe we’ve met so far. I’m Greg Lestrade, Sherlock’s first mate.”
“Hm, thank you, I do try so hard.”
“Found it!”
He wanted to check on him after all the strange actions over the last few days, but he didn’t want to disturb him if he was sleeping after a long shift at the clinic. He slipped off his shoes and ignored the cold touch of the wood floor against his thin socks as he began the treacherous journey of avoiding each and every creak on the staircase.
“What?”
“Sherlock, do you think you could stand up for me?”
He turned his attention back to his work, as he attempted to ignore the sinking feeling of there being something more behind Lestrade’s intentions than just to scare John off “for his own good”.
The usually morose expression on the older merman’s face was now covered with an attempt at what Mycroft most likely thought was understanding, but seemed more patronizing than anything.
He refused to let out the groan that wanted to escape his throat when he took a seat on the sea worn wood and listened to the gentle crash of waves against the dock as he allowed it to fill his senses.
“It’s a shame then that I wasn’t asking.”
Sooo... I may have gone a little overboard with this one. I sincerely meant for this to be some crack and I- I have no clue. either way, I hope I accomplished the tone you imagined.
It was with relief that John was finally able to follow Sherlock into his room and take a seat beside him. Both seemed content to stay where they were and to never move again.
Sherlock managed to get a few others ready before he pulled john’s hand away from his face. Blood quickly oozed from the small gash he managed to open a few inches away from his mouth, and he began the somewhat painful process of having to listen to John wince every time he pressed disinfectant into the wound.
John gave him his usual friendly smile while trying to ignore the slight irritation that began to build from all the attention he was getting. He mindlessly shook his hand, and soon began to stand up when Greg stood up along side him. “I suppose you’re going to show me where to go?”
A frustrated sigh escaped John’s lips as he set down his utensils to rub his temples. “You, out here in the middle of the night, screaming about bees or something while you made a mess in here, then screwed off back to bed and left me to clean it up. That is what happened, Sherlock.”
“Very well, well I suppose it was. Not many men most likely even knew that it was now an infirmary and no longer a broom closet.”
“Then perhaps you should lead me out of bed more often…” Sherlock let out a small chuckle as he leaned down to press a kiss to John’s lips, to which the man beneath him pulled him closer and allowed for his hands to push away the robe from his shoulders to give his hands more access as they trailed down his chest and swiftly undid the belt that was doing its best to protect the man’s dignity.
“Earlier you said… You said that other have gone through this and have died. Why did you have confidence that this time it would work?”
John let out a small groan as he turned on the light on his bedside table before he managed to pick up his phone. He was expecting a random late-night call from Sherlock, or perhaps even Mrs. Hudson calling to tell of her day. What he wasn’t expecting, nor wanting, was a call from Mycroft.
“It’s just a simple sandwich that many people enjoy with their tea. I brought along some for you to try.”
His only strategy left was to pretend the man wasn’t there and continue to sleep. He had just closed his eyes once again underneath his blanket when the man’s rough voice disrupted his sleep and patience.
“Damnit… why does there have to be so many stairs…”
John took the opportunity to tap away his excess ash as he listened to his accusations, even if he still continued the conversation with the utmost courteousness, he began to feel put off by the assumption. “Mr. Holmes, I’m afraid I don’t have a clue as to who you are speaking of. Perhaps you could be less vague and actually tell me what in God’s name you are insinuating.”
His admissions hardly stopped John, as he drew away from Sherlock long enough to slip his hand into his inner coat pocket and pull out the slim black velvet case that was soon pressed into Sherlock’s grasp.
He decided that he wouldn’t sleep that night, as a continued tingle ran from his head to the tips of his fins, that seemed to be at its most prominent at his lips.
convince me while still caring about you. And by his own accord he has come to the decision to sacrifice a lot for you. More than you could ever hope to understand for as long as you live.”
“How dare you, to think you can just bribe me-“
“Oh good god, you’re… How are you?...”
That guilt easily drained from his body as Holmes leaned in close to his ear, his hushed words caused John to strain to hear him over the violence around them. He would later wished he hadn’t.
He gently waved a hand in front of his eyes, which they hardly moved to follow. At some point John was going to call the nurse when Sherlock stopped his moving hand and held it.
They both were soon stripped away from the confines of their somewhat still damp shirts and found their way onto the bed. Roaming hands scoured every inch of one another with memorized precision, gentle fingers found their ways to the darkened marks that hardly lightened over the past year. Each brush of fingertips along teeth marks sent shivers through one another’s spines until they found themselves positioned with Sherlock’s back pressed into the bedding while John sat in between his legs.
This story has been somewhat of a lifesaver over the last weeks as its always given me something to look forward to. Now, I have exams to deal with but I swear to you, after the horrors of exams are over, I feel like I want to start a request fill during the months I have off. I'm not sure If that interests you, but It is something different that I'd like to take part in. Maybe I will see some of you making requests, only time will tell. Thank you again for your wonderful support throughout this story, I could never imagine it would receive as much support as it has.
Neither one of them hung up immediately, the gentle crackling of what John assumed was Sherlock moving around his flat was the only sound that passed between them before John made the decision to hit end call. The lack of crackling caused another wave of stillness to wash over the room before he turned his attentions to Rosie.
“Hey, hey shh..” He was up from his chair before he even knew what he was doing with his arms around Sherlock. His fingers made their way to his unkempt hair that had been horribly kept over the last few days to comb out the knots and tangles.
He wouldn’t stand for this; he couldn’t stand for this. He took a few steps back, let out a shallow breath and jumped.
“Oh.”
A warm hand cupped John’s cheek and finally closed the few last inches that separated them. Small drops of water fell from the merman's hand and ran down the side of John’s face, likely to leave the stain of salt in its trail. The breath the two began to share almost began to burn until John ultimately sealed their lips with one another’s.
“Alright. What is it?”
“You can’t think like that, Sherlock. You never know what that scan will say.”
He moved to bury his face within the already heated skin of John’s shoulder, rapid kisses were pressed here and there until he felt that familiar heat that settled within his lower abdomen. A locked spring coiled within his stomach, ready to burst at any moment, his hips pressed impossibly closer. It was only when he heard the rapid groaning that John released into his ear that he felt himself release into his lover’s hand, John was not far behind from his own orgasm, and soon fell to lay beside Sherlock when he had done so.
Sherlock gave his head a small shake, and it made John’s face absolutely light up. The reaction made Sherlock smile as well, and caused John to wrap his arms around him again. Only this time, John’s embrace was met with a gentle pat to his back, which turned out to be Sherlock’s arm; it was shaking and weak, but it was moving.
make with every languid touch he wanted to give to him. the slow and doting moments in bed between the two of them when nothing else outside the four walls their room mattered and they could spend hours together, or a quick and fervent moment alone together when they had no other time and they had to rush to finish one another off before someone came to look for them.
The warm light of the next morning poured into the room over the two in their lingered sleep, John awoke moments later to a ray of light in his eyes and was greeting with one of the most pleasing sights he had seen in a very long time.
The lack of oxygen began to burn his lungs and he swallowed the last bit of oxygen he held in his cheeks with some difficulty, that was until Sherlock stopped in front of him and held his lips against the other’s. He didn’t understand it, he most likely never would, yet when he was held against his lips a certain amount of calm began to bleed into him and the need for oxygen suddenly became irrelevant as Sherlock pulled him along through the water.
Either way, I hope you enjoyed this chapter and will (hopefully) see you the same time next week :)
He brought her upstairs to brush her teeth and tuck her in, a happy reading of some story about bees sent her to sleep with sweet dreams before John made his way to his own room. The soft bed looked almost too inviting for him to complete his own routine, but he relented and did what was needed before was able to retire to sleep.
“…Are you out of your mind? You cannot just drag me into this bar, courteously speak to me for half a minute and then tell me to do something you have no right to meddle in!”
John turned his gaze back to the young merman that sat beside him, who eagerly awaited to see his reaction, and a reaction he did receive.
The assumption made John’s blood boil where he sat, how could this man be inane enough to say he could not handle a man such as Sherlock Holmes. “What you’re implying, Lestrade, is none of your business.”
He didn’t have much longer to study the other passengers of his carriage before the tube came to a quick stop. He was somewhat thankful he had the handrail at that moment before he gathered his few bags of groceries and did his best to escape the oncoming pushing and shoving that ensued between the people who wanted to get in and out.
He moved the kneel down on the deck and watched as a young man that gripped onto the dock’s pole came into view. Soaking curls that dripped water from their ends framed the man’s face and drew John’s attention to his eyes, the bright contrast of their pale hue and the murky water that surrounded him could only make him stand out more. These things, added on with prominent cheekbones and supple, full lips that John had never seen so full even on a woman, added to this lovely mystique about him as he hardly looked afraid like he thought he would be, but rather interested as they met John’s own stare.
It felt as though the world went still once Sherlock’s eyes met the water again, his hand lightly rested against the crook of his arm and he flicked his tail up every so often just to watch the water fall in droplets from the tips of his fins. It never occurred to him that he could lose something that mattered so dearly to him, no matter how deeply he attempted to hide that want, but was it truly worth losing John just to have a child with someone he could never care as much for?
The man seemed to beam at this news at him being correct, as a quick splash underneath him seemed to signify his legs kicked with happiness. Except… this dock had to be at least six feet from the water, and unless this man’s legs were truly longer than that and he had not already been sent away to one of the many freak shows that were currently touring Europe, something was not right.
“Why?”
There was just a moment when they were all frozen in place, a collective thought running through them all that he had changed his mind, they were all going to be arrested and hung for treason and whatever else could be placed on their heads. Oh, how wrong they all were.
:)” -booksaddict
He only got a sleepy laugh in response as Sherlock wrapped tighter around him. John was now stuck to that sofa until Sherlock decided to wake up or until his arm was crushed by his serpentine like grip.
The agonizingly slow ride from the hotel to the dock was only made worse by the constant bout of silence he received from Mycroft that began to make him nauseous from some form of anxiety, so John could not be more relieved when the carriage stopped and he made a hasty exit to get some air.
Sherlock had moved his attention to the difficult process of undoing the buttons of John’s vest and shirt, the tie and collar was swiftly pushed aside to allow his lips to travel over each inch of him that he could manage to find. It often meant that he found his way to multiple scars, which he lightly brushed over to give a soft kiss to each one he managed to find.
Sherlock let out a gentle sigh as his head was drawn back to the shoulder, he had just marked the previous day. A gentle rub of his nose through the many layers of fabric seemed to calm his doctor well enough from the tensity he had brought upon himself.
John slowly raised his head to look to him, and to the sword. A small shiver ran through his back as he looked over the small details cut into the leather by undoubtedly Sherlock, he quietly cursed under his breath as how this was such a horrible idea as his hand gripped the sword and began to clip it to his waist.
“Sherlock?...”
“Sherlock, you cannot seriously believe it’s not true. Your life is already far too dangerous as it is, and now you are bringing this man into your life with no knowledge of what he is getting himself into! I could not sit idly by without giving the man some warning out of human decency.”
“Childish? I’m childish? You nearly crash a hole into my ship, you board it with your navy lackies, and expect me to act like this is a gentleman’s warfare? In every case, that makes you the childish one to think this would be so simple.” He soon slipped his sword back into his sheath, and crossed his arms over his chest.
“Oh, I wouldn’t do that, I’ve grown too fond of you. How could I possibly manage to accomplish that now?”
“How… How could you possibly know I took an overnight train?”
Well, I just live off of the angst here don't I? But do not worry, this story will have a happy ending! As much as I love bitter sweet endings, I could never do that to all of you
“Sherlock, it needs to be set in a splint. I don’t have anything I need-“
Greg’s smile still persisted however, as he handed John the note Sherlock had tucked into his sword. “Captain Holmes gave me the authority.”
“… Tell me about you, you seem to know many things about me, I’d like to know the same.”
Sherlock froze as the two of them embraced when he felt the gentle brush of Victor’s nose to his exposed neck. He couldn’t explain why, as a few days ago he would have been happy to feel such a sensation against his skin caused by Victor, likely happier than he’d ever truly felt, but this felt… wrong.
“Oh, good lord, he truly did it… How could he be so idiotic-“
He did not bother to think about it any longer, as he moved from his bed to run his fingers over the stone of his home. It was not much to look at, but he did his best to make it comfortable for him. Stacks of books were placed in small alcoves of the cave, half burnt candles sat in corners, never to be lit again.
“Goodnight, Doctor Watson.”
Nothing else needed to be said as Sherlock pulled John into his arms, his head quickly went to the crook of John’s neck. John let his hands rest on the man’s lower back and ran a hand up and down to soothe the shaking that he felt run along Sherlock’s spine.
He sat on the cave’s floor in front of a cracked mirror that he begrudgingly dragged to sit where it was, and fiddled with a few curls that never seemed to stay where he liked. He soon became fed up and swam away from the mirror, it was not as if his hair would stay the way he wanted out of the water when he spoke to John.
