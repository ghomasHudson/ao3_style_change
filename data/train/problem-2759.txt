Tonight would be the latter, he knew. Even before Dean tipped his chin up, brushing their lips together and murmuring gently, “No honey tonight.”
“Come on, why not?” Sam whined, trailing him to the kitchen. “I already packed, and I’ve got homework I can do, and- “
Castiel’s eyes rolled back as his mate resumed his punishing pace, hips slamming into him hard and fast until the human came with a sound that was so raw Alpha it made the Omega quiver. It took every last shred of self-control, and recitations of Old Tongue verbs, to keep that sound alone from sending him over the edge. Gradually the punishing pace slowed, Dean going still when he was buried to the hilt.
Castiel rolled over, stuffing his pillow under his chin and folding his arms under it to peer in the direction of the newly erected filming area. Generally Dean did this in his home office, but sometimes he did it in other places. Today he’d set it up in the corner of their bedroom, on a desk where two chairs had been pulled over, the frame wide enough for two people.
“And at the time I was pissed enough to let him,” Dean admitted, shamefaced. “I got maybe three miles before I turned around again, doubled back to look for you. We’d been in this stretch of desert, I’d cooled down enough to realize he’d get heatstroke before he got picked up. But I went back four miles and couldn’t find him. I tried calling him, he didn’t pick up. There was nothing on that stretch, just sand and dirt and some tumbleweeds. I…kinda freaked.”
While Dean had been the one to ask many questions at the start, things had evened out. Castiel had wanted to know as much as he could about him as well, after all. He wanted to know everything about the Alpha who'd entranced him so.
Castiel was reaching for the first buggy when Margie's machine began to print the receipt. He was used to this taking mere seconds, so he didn't think much of it. But when it kept buzzing he turned to look, and his eyes widened yet again. Dean was being handed the end of what was already a yard of receipt, Margie holding a section near its middle as it continued to spool out. She wasn't able to tear it off until a full six feet of white paper had been printed, the entirety of it covered with numbers. It took Dean a moment to get it folded up enough to stuff into his binder, which he tossed onto the least burdened buggy and began the process of getting all four out the door.
“Hello, Sam.” Castiel looked at the hand offered to him for a moment, then visible realization crossed his face before he reached out to grasp it. He had fully returned to the calm if curious state he’d spent much of the morning in, studying Sam with what looked oddly like contented interest.
"Apparently a particularly snobbish client has been making themselves a nuisance. Who's in charge of the investigation?"
“They were. If one of Alistair’s pets found out they let me get away, he probably ganked the failures. And witnesses. It’s how it’s done.”
It was barely passed noon, and he'd just handed a lottery ticket to one of their regulars, when someone swaggered up to the counter. "I'll have some beef jerky and a pack of Menthols."
“It’s not so much a complaint as it is an observation of something that can be occasionally irritating. Yet it seems to require too much effort for your bottle caps to make it all the way into the trashcan.”
“Yes, gods yes, Jimmy please, need your knot so bad,” the Omega gasped. He whimpered as the Alpha thrust roughly back into him, his hole left swollen and puffy and tender.
Considering Lucifer had previously only poked fun at Castiel for his taking part in his husband’s videos, it didn’t take much to get his consent for the kids to be in one. In his defense, Castiel had tried to ask out of their earshot, but they’d heard anyway. The next thing he knew he had two youngsters bouncing around him asking if they could be on the internet. Whatever he thought of his brother, sociopath or no, Lucifer regarded Ruby and Alfie and heaved a long-suffering sigh.
Slowly, when Dean was sure the mate mark would take, he dislodged from the bite. Castiel whimpered quietly, but remained still beneath his Alpha. Dean gently licked at broken flesh, reaching over to the bedside table to grab a rag and press it over the wound. Castiel had also set out bandages and antiseptic.
"I knocked it out!" her cousin added with equal pride. Apparently the slightly older Max had forgotten about his panic when he'd initially hit her with a baseball.
“Are you hungry? It’s almost noon, you should eat something,” Dean suggested abruptly, pulling away from their kiss.
Dean considered it, torn. This wasn't the strongest case he'd ever heard, and he had half a mind to walk away. But it was mid afternoon and raining, even if he left now he wouldn't reach the next town until nightfall. Besides, Impala was tired. She'd earned a rest and some oats. He'd made sure to give her a good rubdown before coming inside, flipping a stable boy an extra copper for the good feed. No, he'd stay the night at least. And Dean knew if he did that then he'd get talked into checking out this dragon one way or another.
Gadreel raised his gaze, stepping forward cautiously to accept it. Standing out of Dean’s line of sight, Samandriel beamed encouragingly and gave him a double thumbs up. For some reason this seemed to increase Gadreel’s concern rather than lessen it.
They’d ended up using the entirety of their drive home from Pontiac to discuss children as a whole. How they wanted to try going about it, what routes to take, and the logistics. Castiel used up what cell data he had left doing research as they debated. In the end they decided to adopt, and to keep it domestic. If they wanted to do more in the future they’d look into international, but domestic seemed less complicated for round one. As for surrogacy…they’d agreed it just hadn’t felt right. Especially since there were already so many children already in the world that needed a family.
Castiel coasted to a landing just outside their gate now, letting himself inside first it then the front door, walking right into a wall of scent and sound.
Dean didn't think, he just moved. In seconds he was around the table and grabbing John's jacket, slamming him against the wall. "What happened to my mate?" he snarled. "Cas is a lot of things but he sure as hell ain't fine."
The Angel wasn’t entirely sure why Dean had gone from a rough if caring manner to pouting on the couch. Writing it off as one of the Demon’s oddities, he went to pick up the list. Between the food, the rest, and having tight muscles loosened, now was the best time to go and do his supply run while he could. Even when Dean was in better condition it still would be up to him to do it. When he left the wards, it would have to be when Gabriel came to fetch him.
“Of course there was a difference! It creaked when you looked at it.” Huffing, Castiel continued, “The moment they set it down, the stand broke and the TV fell screen-first on the floor. Honestly I was amazed it survived.”
Right when Dean was sure he was about to find out if Pastor Jim had been right all these years, it started to hail. Or it sounded like hail. The roof started to rattle like hundreds of baseballs were being dropped onto it, so loud everyone stopped fighting to stare up at it. Then the walls began to shake, crystalline blue light pouring into the windows.
He was so busy talking to himself, absorbed in his personal dilemma, he didn’t notice he had company until one of them spoke.
That was the odd part, his headache had spread to his eyes and ears. Not his temples, teeth, jaw, or even nose, just his eyes and ears. He found himself wearing sunglasses inside, which made him feel like a douchebag. Needless to say he fled the lecture hall the moment class was over.
Alpha. When he didn't spot Dean right away, he sent a careful inquiry through the tie, projecting a soft but firm,
“What does it matter what you believe? You’ve got your head so far up your ass, Dean, you don’t even realize we’re already done for. ‘Angel knows it. We are never gonna make it with him next to us, glowing like a beacon.”
There he had more luck. He’d no sooner opened the door than he smelled traces of sulfur. Instinctively palming his blade, flipping on the electric light, Castiel slowly descended the stairs. This level was a single, open space, and a quick scan showed him to be the only occupant. He still kept a hand on his blade, though. It was hard not to, with the reek of Demon blood in his nose. It hung in the air, for all the hunters themselves had bathed and discarded their clothes. It looked as though they’d hosed down the area, traces of blood clinging to the drains, more clinging to the table that had broken manacles dangling from it. Tools had been left on worktables, which had not been cleaned either. Likely the source of the blood scent in his nose as well as the Demon’s wounds.
Banishment was considered the strongest punishment handed down, even by law enforcers. Executions were saved for the truly depraved of their kind, considered unfit to unleash even upon humans. He’d been five years old when the last one had been done. The will-o’-the-wisp in question had had an illness of the mind. They’d thought her three younglings had died of natural causes, which while sad did happen at times. She’d been caught smothering the third in their crib. They would have just banished her too, but it had been decided she might continue to breed and kill, or just kill younglings indiscriminately. Even human pups didn’t deserve such a fate.
The hand drifting down his side slid around his stomach, pressing to his lower belly. He was nearly to three months now, and while it wasn't blatant yet his stomach was starting to harden a bit. If he were any thinner it would be rounding out already. Last night he remembered the Alpha paying an interesting amount of attention to that part of his anatomy, taking the time to virtually worship his growing belly and the white scars already marking his hips and waist.
"Eventually everyone dies," he reminded the boy gently. "Leaving is not an immediate death sentence. I will simply age at a human rate. Between my magic and human medicine there's a chance I can still live well over seventy years more. This is my choice. I won't make you do the same."
At that exact moment, Dean was sorely tempted to light out after Sam. His brother had probably just grabbed a bag and left on foot to hitchhike, he hadn't heard a motor running. Things had been tense for years now, but it'd never been like this. John had never crossed a line like this. It was one thing to rule your kids with an iron hand when they were children, it was another when they were grown up. It was a whole different ballgame to exert the Alpha's Voice on another's mate. Dean could overpower whatever orders were given by other Alphas, but not if he didn't know there was something wrong. An order given in that state would be one an Omega had to follow. Dean had always hated the Alphas Voice, had refused to use it on Castiel to this day. No matter how angry he got, he'd never take his mate's will away from him.
As predicted, Castiel was again carted away to the infirmary, where he was scolded for finding trouble twice in the space of a week. At least this time it was an easier fix. The plasma and holy oil had been the root cause for his previous slow recovery, but this time Ephraim was able to heal him with relative ease. Enough he was cleared for duty once more in time for his next patrol.
Per usual things died down once the sun went down, and after nine it was dead. Castiel had just finished restocking the milk and was wandering back around the counter when the door dinged, announcing a new customer. It went off just as the Omega knocked his inventory clipboard from the counter. He sighed, absently bending to pick it up and looking it over as he straightened.
“No, you won’t.” Sparing his husband an irritated look, he refocused on the camera. “So he goes over there halfway through Thanksgiving day with Sam, whom he roped into his scheme, and waits in line. Both of them spend money they barely have on these big TV’s. Sam leaves his in the car to be driven home, and they carry this monstrosity up to our apartment and attempt to set it on the table serving as a TV stand. The old, rickety, barely standing TV stand. Guess what happened?”
It was short and sweet. Dean could work with that. Then came the process of promising Hanna she didn’t need to change clothes, she looked beautiful as is.
That was not the Castiel standing before him now. There was no eyeliner, no black nail polish, no piercings to be found. Gone were the varying shades of black, gone were the ratty jeans and black denim jacket. In their place Castiel now wore a pair of intact, unworn jeans, and a pair of unremarkable tennis shoes. They were paired with an untucked white button-down shirt and a beige trench coat, his tattoos completely obscured. Even his hair was combed, which had only happened for their mating ceremony, and he’d given Dean plenty of reason to ruin it shortly thereafter. What’s more, Dean had distinctly heard a few bags drop to the floor by the door. Apparently there was more where this came from.
“Henry’s watching Jimmy, the twins are watching Henry, and they’re all supposed to be taking turns churning. I’m guessing we’ve got a few hours before they start trying to weasel out of it.” He set the tray down on the bed, rejoining his mate on it. He cupped the Omega’s chin, kissing him tenderly. “Sleep well?”
“Enochian brass knuckles. And some sort of weapon the Men of Letters produced. No. I need to retain my current state.”
“Don’t!” Gabriel tried and failed to grab his hand, eyes wide. “Look at me, Cassie, she almost killed me!”
Dean finally tore his eyes away, staring down at the menu before him instead. He deliberately focused on the entrée listings, trying very hard not to look at the opposite page. Set between dessert and drink offerings were what was tastefully referred to as ‘Other’. Blood, in the usual three size selections, was near the top of that list. It was accompanied by a little asterisk and the prompt to ask your server about what types they had on hand daily. There were also pig and cow hearts, which were served alongside your choice of side dish. Artificially produced brain fluid and pituitary glands were also offered, but it was more of an appetizer for those who required such things, a category he truly hoped he would never fall into. The real thing was rare, and you had to go through official channels to get it since they couldn’t be donated like blood. Not that he wanted to find out if there was a quality difference firsthand. Typically pituitary glands, and sometimes brain fluid, were the first things extracted from organ donors. They were regulated, and unless you were a child or otherwise had a significant need they could be hard to get ahold of. To discourage people from just harvesting straight from humans, heavier penalties were laid on those who tried. Not that it stopped all of them. The fact that other options had been cultivated, and the willingness of humans to help where they were able had encouraged wraiths, kitsune, and others to police themselves.
Dean trotted between barn and tavern as a downpour began, ducking through the cracked door and glancing around the taproom. There wasn't much of a crowd here yet, despite the weather. It was easy enough to take a seat at the bar and flag over the innkeeper.
Once they'd eaten their fill Castiel found an Alpha nuzzling his neck, twining his arms around his waist from behind, a low thrum in his throat. The sound reminded him of the purr of a cat. Again he found himself cracking a fond smile, reaching a hand up to stroke the Alpha's hair. Warm lips brushed his neck, teeth nibbling at the shell of his ear. It provided a pleasantly tantalizing sensation, making him arch into the touch rather than shy away.
You couldn’t fly through a Heaven’s gate, you had to land to pass through and take off again from there. A minor annoyance that had become part of his routine these last years. Each day, when he was off duty, he would return home without fail. The only exception had been when he’d been on the battlefront, sent there during Raphael’s tantrum over his taking a non-Angel mate before Gabriel could talk the other Archangels around. It helped that the brothers had become invaluable, both as sources of information and strategic advisors. Particularly since they could now communicate with each other, and were allowed set hours of visitation each month.
Dean glanced up from the road long enough to give the camera a smile, but most of his attention was on the traffic around them. As it should be. They’d agreed it would be best, to set a good example. “What’s up world? Your friendly neighborhood Batman is back with a Thanksgiving special. I know, I don’t do these much, this time of year is freaking insane, but I’m making an exception. Cas and me are on the road to visit his family for the holidays, but we’re gonna answer some questions along the way.” He glanced over at his husband, nudging him with an elbow.
The resulting squeals made Castiel wince, the cumulation of so many high-pitched sounds acutely painful.
It was nearly midmorning when he finally did return to Kansas Haven. He walked through his back door only to be ambushed by three eager children, apparently running rampant under Gabriel's wavering control. Once it was established everything was intact, they were simply on a sugar high after chocolate chip pancakes, Castiel relieved his brother and sent them out back to play until they burned through the high. He waited until later that evening, when things had settled down and he could afford to have a private conversation, to bring Balthazar down to his workroom.
This set the rhythm for what remained of Dean’s time in the cabin. Castiel did try to stay vigilant, he still trained, still drew up reports, still did his patrol route, but he didn’t do it as often as he once had. He left out the evolution of their relationship in the few messages he sent to Gabriel, which just provided the requested updates on any new information and Dean’s healing progress.
Dean stood up stiffly, grimacing as his headache redoubled its pounding, pressing the heel of a hand to his forehead. He stretched both wings out, then carefully curled them forward so it would be easier to get a look at them. Their movements were still jerky, uncoordinated, but he was getting better.
“A date is like courting. People who are interested in each other spending time together to see about developing a relationship.”
“You’re not wrong,” Castiel admitted. He studied the Demon for a moment, then asked, “Have you given it any thought? What will become of you when you’re fully recuperated?”
He and Dean often coordinated their friends nights, today being one of those days. While he went out with Meg, Dean was currently in a battle royal via video game with Charlie, Gilda, and Sam. From the sound of it, he wasn’t winning.
Castiel hesitated, then fumbled for his pants. “I have time to eat and still return within the expected window. But any longer and they will start to wonder if something’s wrong. Any sort of suspicion will be bad. I won’t allow for it.”
Mom was frozen, staring at them still, but he looked utterly relieved. Meanwhile Grandmother and everyone else was gaping at them with odd expressions. Some just looked stunned. Others were horrified. Most seemed to be doing both at the same time.
“Moving on!” Dean declared dramatically, snatching the paper. “’What are your favorite cuss words?’ I know I asked things to stay PG, but I figured our favorites fall into that category.”
He smiled fondly over the camera. “Yes, Dean.” He found it sweet when his husband got flustered, especially when he’d learned these parts weren’t edited out.
Silence rang in her ears. No one spoke. Swallowing thickly, Charlie raised her head from where it had been buried in Dean’s chest. The Alpha slowly loosened the arms wrapped around her, looking down and making sure she was okay. His own face was ashen, an unsteady hand pressing to her cheek before he twisted to look back at Naomi.
His mate nudged his left thigh over a bit more, draping his right thigh over his own shoulder and hooking his left hand over it. The digits of his free hand stroked down his taint, brushing over his hole as he took the Omega’s cock centimeter by taunting centimeter.
Rather than let him go, Castiel found himself pulled back around. He had every intention of following through on his warning, his blade even dropped into his palm, but before he could begin to raise his weapon the Demon had fisted both hands in his lapels and yanked him forward a step. He stumbled, foot bracing once it touched down, only for his entire body to go ridged, freezing from head to toe.
Mom glanced down at his belly, then regarded his own mother with a tilted head. Charlie doubted Naomi could see it, or anyone else, but she could see the faintest shimmer of a shield go up. Dean still stood halfway between Castiel and them, but the shield extended to cover him too. A barely-there, transparent thing that would stop if not reflect whatever Grandmother hurled at them. Good.
“Well, yes. I think we’ve established I have no idea what I’m doing, and surprises aren’t taken well.”
“Have you?” Castiel asked absently, studying the projector that would have ghosts dancing over the front of their house.
They’d just begun February, he was roughly halfway through his pregnancy, and he’d begun packing. Subtly, of course, but he already had two crates packed and sealed. Both held the majority of his tools and supplies from his workshop. No one came over, never mind went poking around, aside from Gabriel. The kids noticed, though, and he’d had to tell them they weren’t allowed to pack yet. They’d pouted and whined but had grudgingly begun taking their clothes out of their trunks.
He was lowered back to the ground in such a slow, gentle fashion Castiel didn't even notice until his back touched the nest floor. He was too busy clinging to the Alpha's shoulders, enjoying this new marvel. A soft, wanton moan was drawn from his throat before they parted for air, panting. The Alpha took his time, exploring his mouth, and the Omega let him.
Meg smirked at him over the rim of her glass, taking a sip of the liquor before drawling, “You know what I’m talking about, Clarence. Those videos? Where you’re all sappy and domestic?”
It wasn’t until some of the broiling sensation eased that Dean started putting two and two together, ears still ringing, head still throbbing. Nerves. The nerves had connected. Everyone said that was the worst part. That was good, though. It meant he was nearing the end.
Grimacing, Castiel returned to the story. “So he set his coffee cup on the table, right next to my computer. Bear in mind there wasn’t any food or drink allowed beyond the second floor of the library.”
It occurred to him as he carefully lowered himself back onto hands and knees, pulling his underwear back into place and flushing the toilet again, that he’d have to be careful in tight spaces now. Humans with new wings were notorious for knocking them against walls, door jambs, and clearing entire shelves. He’d once seen one poor mook accidently clear a solid six feet of cereal off a grocery shelf when he’d turned around.
“If there’s still any around, I would have shifted, and same thing. Their wings match whatever fur they get. You think I haven’t been trying to crack this? I should be able to pin down exactly what they are now, but I still can’t.”
This particular day had followed one of John’s drunken rampages. One in which Dean had been too tired to dodge fast enough. He’d tried to cover the bruises as best he could, but apparently he hadn’t done it as well as he’d thought.
"Perhaps," Castiel agreed, reaching the meadow's edge and approaching at a nonthreatening speed. "What is your name?"
When he finally realized bliss, it was a truly wondrous thing. Like nothing he’d ever managed on his own before. He couldn’t remember ever having an out of body experience as he trembled and whimpered his lover’s name helplessly. Perhaps he passed out for a moment, he wasn’t altogether sure. But when he focused his eyes next, Dean’s movements were frantic and a bit jerky. He wondered why this was, but before he could ask, or even loosen the grip that had him clinging to the Demon, Dean’s eyes rolled back as he reached his second orgasm that evening.
Slowly, in a quiet voice, Castiel told his brother of his ordeal. Sometimes simply showing was easiest, though he didn't surrender the more intimate moments. Those he wanted to keep for himself.
Sam’s spring break, when it came, was spent with them driving up to South Dakota. It seemed the Singers wanted to meet them, post haste. Jo even came home for the occasion. All four were very interested in the Novak’s, to the point Dean was routinely pestered by texts. That was the surname Castiel’s last alias had had, Novak. He was in the process of arranging last name changes for himself and the three younglings. At least their soon-to-be sibling could just have ‘Winchester’ put on their birth certificate. They’d get their documents honestly. Unlike theirs, which a contact had had to draw up. Younglings born in Havens didn’t have things like birth certificates or social security numbers.
"You were following them, right?" Sam made a point of taking one of several fake ID's off the table to regard the name. "Mr. Smith? Seriously?"
One of them finally noticed Dean was conscious and staring at them. As concerning as their words were, realizing these sons of bitches actually knew who his soulmate was, he was just as unsettled by the fact that he was looking at such a variety of people. It went beyond gender, age, race, though there was a hearty range in those departments too. It didn’t matter if they were currently hiding their natures, he could see exactly what they were. Vampires, at least six different breeds of shifter, djinn, wraiths, demons, dragons, sirens, nymphs, nereids, to name a few. He even saw a pair of tengu, a phoenix, and a mer. All of whom were now staring at him. Some looked uneasy, others looked annoyed, or angry, a few just looked arrogant. The only commonality between the group was that all wore the same pen. He couldn’t make out what it was exactly, none were close enough, but they were on lapels, scarves, blouses.
"Of course, of course." The innkeeper waved over a maid as he spoke, perking up. "Maria can take your things to a room. We do have a dragon, Mr. Winchester."
Gabriel cocked his head slightly, golden eyes twinkling as he waved a finger at him. "So you're the one who convinced my goody-two-shoes cousin to make a jailbreak? Congrats. You wouldn't believe what it took just to get this kid to help me swipe some cookies."
“That’s it, good boy,” the Alpha hummed, massaging his own cock through his mate’s throat. “If you want that knot you’re going to need to take a few loads first.”
Now, if he could survive whatever his mate had concocted this time without needing to regenerate his taste buds, he was overdue to enjoy what humans called ‘marital duties’.
He wasn’t sure what to think when Dean actually seemed to think about this. Then he sighed, glancing down at himself. “I guess it’d be warmer. Fine. I thought Angels didn’t care.”
Charlie had never seen that spell before, of that she was sure. She’d expected something, of course, she knew Castiel had been too. But she saw her own mother’s eyes widen in horror when that spell was unleashed, thrown by her now stony-faced grandmother. She took a step forward without thought, even as the spell shot through the air.
That was when their waitress came by with fresh drinks and a plate, whisking away the empty ones. The scent of warm pretzels drifted to his nose, a dish next to the sticks holding beer cheese. If memory served, they were every bit as delicious as they smelled.
“You wear jeans and t-shirts,” Castiel protested. “I don’t think that counts as an evolved sense of fashion.”
Rather than answer, the Omega waited until he was up the stairs and in the apartment, sitting down at their small kitchen table with mismatched chairs. The brothers followed him, of course. Sam closed and locked the front door as Dean stalked over to him, agitated. "Where were you?"
Castiel was still frozen, a death grip on his weapon, when the Demon pulled away. For a long minute they stared at each other, faces mere inches apart. Perhaps it shouldn’t have been a surprise his mouth was so soft, his lips looked soft, now that he thought about it.
“You made a demon deal?” Dean asked incredulously. They weren’t exactly common knowledge, even now. He only knew about them because he’d tripped onto texts detailing the ins and outs of such things. Mostly why you shouldn’t, but if you did, how to do it properly.
“There have been rumors among my informants. Word is a Knight of Hell was the target of an assassination. One that failed.”
The knot of traffic finally eased up, and they made better time. Shortly after this they stopped for lunch, refueling with cheeseburgers before running the gauntlet. Traffic always seemed to get worse the closer they got.
“I’m supposed to be dangerous,” Dean whined, bringing over two platters. “You know, one of Hell’s greatest badasses.”
Eventually Dean gave up. Castiel still had an issue with personal space, but he didn’t have to kick him out of the bathroom anymore. Besides, odd or not, the seraph was his soulmate. Something that became easier to see with each passing day. Even when he technically had his own apartment as the owner of the building Castiel still refused to live elsewhere. Hell, after the first week Dean relented and let him sleep on the same bed. But only because the angel refused to budge from his couch, which he insisted was perfectly suitable.
“When I met you, you had this drawer devoted to ridiculously bright sweatshirts. You wear the same stuff to work everyday because you
“I wasn’t joking, barring an emergency you are not to set foot outside these walls until told otherwise, understood?”
Castiel shrugged, glancing down at the crossbow. "I was old enough to leave home, so I did. I didn't want to be a burden. Unfortunately I've yet to find an Alpha I wish to call mate. I'm happy here. There's hives nearby, flowers, deer."
As he took down the mostly full bottle, his brother ordered, “Eat something, it’ll metabolize faster. Then we’ll work on your wings.”
Castiel drifted forward uncertainly. However he felt about Dean, he’d never actually met Sam before, and he’d spent a lifetime being weary around new Alphas. Balthazar peeked out of the doorway, as weary as his mother, opting to wait to see what happened before making his presence known.
John was looking down at his hands on the table, into his coffee mug, out the window, anywhere as he spoke but at the Omega. Castiel slowly lowered his coffee, uneasy. "What did the tests say?"
“Because you don’t just ‘flip through’ a super old, illuminated manuscript,” Dean argued. “Like….like Atilla the Hun was big, old.”
“We were just wondering if you were going to keep doing videos with Dean? Because we just really love watching those but if you don’t wanna do them anymore that’s okay too.” The second sentence came out all in a rush, and took a moment for Castiel to decipher.
“It’s working slowly, what they did to you. I would estimate you have ten hours, perhaps more. What do you wish to know? If it’s not confidential I’ll tell you. Impart information of your own, and I’ll end your misery.”
Heaving a quiet sigh, Castiel set down the extra handouts and made his way to the back cluster of desks. He could hear Dean’s dialogue now, well enough to tell which video it was before he caught a glimpse of the title. It was the ‘Never Have I Ever’ video. A week prior to its filming Dean had asked for suggested questions, and he’d picked ten of the few hundred to use, though the numbers weren’t quite so staggering once he’d removed the repeats. They were almost halfway through the twenty-minute video, and Dean was in the middle of reneging how he’d gotten a speeding ticket.
“Huh. I mean I’ve had some time to think about it, but I still don’t know. For a while I thought this bike I got when I was ten was the most awesome present ever,” jerking a thumb at Castiel, he continued, “but then this guy got me tickets to Led Zeppelin’s last concert ever.”
“Meg, don’t,” he protested, grabbing a napkin to wipe up the sugary liquid as best he could. He’d probably have to go to the bathroom to really get cleaned up, that glass had been almost full when it was brought over. He could already feel his shirt sticking to him.
It took well over an hour, but by the time it was sunset he had several neat stacks of freshly cut coupons and a trash bag of the remains to be added to Bobby's overflowing recycle bin. Castiel yawned, stretched, then went to check on Dean. When he peeked into his boyfriend's room he found him passed out on his bed, hair still damp from the shower, barefoot and in clean clothes.
"We didn't know," the Omega mumbled into his chest. "Can we please leave? Can we go with Sam? Or hunt alone? Please, I don't care, just...I don't want to live with him anymore."
“Now would you leave him alone? Seriously. I appreciate the dedication and all, but you can’t treat him like that.”
“I’m aware. You should have enough groceries to last you until I return. If it will take too long I will arrange for Gabriel to come back, though he will likely only get confections and baked goods.”
Castiel smiled, sluggishly wrapping his arms around the Demon. He did try to return the favor, stroking the bones of Dean’s wings, until he was asked to stop. Apparently it didn’t have the same effect. It wasn’t as enjoyable, and when the bones were handled it was more erotic than soothing.
Best of all was when some of the boys came over and asked if they could look at Dad’s arms. Their parents seemed flustered, apologizing, but Dad didn’t mind. He crouched down, pushing up his sleeves so they could see them. Hazel watched with pride as her Dad elevated to official awesome status, her classmates oohing and awing over the inked pictures in his skin. They just wanted to look at them, ask what they were. Dad seemed to get annoyed when strangers did this in public, randomly asking things like what their meanings were or why he’d gotten them. But now he seemed more amused, answering their questions, letting them poke when they asked, answering the more basic questions. Yes, they hurt. No, you had to chose carefully. No, he didn’t do them on a dare. Yes, he only put special pictures on his skin.
Dean's eyes narrowed, but he did drop down into one of the seats. Sam looked as much thoughtful as he did worried, brown eyes calculating. Deciding that stalling would do him no good, Castiel got right into it. There were only a few interjections as he told them everything, from when John came to the Gas-N'-Sip to when he'd left the diner. Dean looked pissed, but he did agree to put off going after John until after his mate was done.
The chest wound was easier to tend, for all it took a good thirty stitches to close it up. Getting the other gash to close was trickier, he had to hold things in as well as keep the flaps of skin together long enough to secure a stitch. It was slow, bloody work, but he managed. At least the Demon wasn’t awake to howl when he poured alcohol and peroxide over them, before and after. He doused them in water too, washing out the wounds. The old man had apparently liked his comforts as well as isolation, he’d kept a generator and a water pump, both of which still worked. The shower even had hot water.
“Yes, and thanks to these wards, so long as you stay within this structure not even Lucifer will be able to find you.”
"Oh. Right. Yeah, I bought this place three years ago, lock stock and barrel. It's been doing better since then."
Castiel settled Jimmy on a soft blanket when he reached his library, setting out his favorite toys, all carefully crafted by their father and fireproofed by their mother. What little remained of the afternoon Castiel spent working on his catalog system. He managed to get most of it done by the time Mary came to fetch him for dinner.
Reminded that their forty-minute window was rapidly shrinking, a majority of the crowd scattered. A few more faithful fans stuck to the retreating man’s heels, asking about his car. Instantly a broad, proud smile spread across Dean’s face. Shaking his head morosely, Castiel turned to head towards the teacher’s lounge. He doubted that particular group would ever get their lunch, if they were to spend the whole period listening to all Dean had to say about Baby. He adored the man, and he respected Baby, but when it came to things his husband was really passionate about he turned into an enthusiastic five-year-old.
“What do you mean where?” Dean demanded, dragging himself upright. He winced as stiff tendons creaked, sore vertebrae protesting. When he looked back again, they were still there. It was hard to tell what color they were, but the feathers were dark, each of them sheening softly even under the mess that covered them. “On my back, where else?”
“Yeah, and some people have problems with people like me. I don’t mind it when people are like your classmates. It’s…innocent. They don’t do it to be mean, they’re just curious. But if they’re doing stuff like that to be mean, or because they think they’re better, that’s not nice.”
“My what?” He grunted as Castiel nicked his arm, drawing a line of blood long enough to get some into his palm.
Dean winced as Sam gingerly brushed fingertips amongst soaked feathers, but to his credit his brother tried to be gentle about it. The water got redder again, though, so he kept his mouth shut. Seemingly in sprouting from his back they’d essentially been dipped in blood.
“Didn’t they bring in nude models, like for the body painting classes?” That one a mutual friend had taken.
"I guess so, if you already offed three mooks before me," Dean muttered, a distant look in his eyes.
His mate nodded once, then pistol-whipped the Alpha. His eyes rolled back, his head falling forward.
A smile began to crawl up Dean’s face as he took down the camera. “Admit it, you had fun. Watch over it with me after I’m done editing, alright?”
"Our fathers had a falling out. Gabriel was the only one whose presence I enjoyed, but when I saw him last I was...twelve?"
The Omega didn't go directly to his meeting with John when he clocked out. For well over half an hour he alternated between pacing among the boxes and shelves of back inventory and sitting uneasily on the edge of a folding chair as he tried to make up his mind. Ever since that night at the hospital it had become a survival instinct, keeping his distance from John Winchester. In the end only that they would be in a public place and that he'd promised made Castiel cross the street rather than go home. He couldn't bring himself to forgive the Alpha, and forgetting was an impossibility, but he didn't have to if he was simply going to hear whatever John had to say.
Castiel held his peace, letting the gears churn. Dean would come to a conclusion in his own time. Just the fact there wasn’t an immediate response meant John’s visit was being seriously considered, not outright discounted.
The Angel grunted at his weight, but didn’t protest. It was all spread out anyway, and oddly comfortable in a way. Comforting.
Castiel set it in the buggy as they rolled on. He did manage to get passed that section without picking up anything else, at least. His husband was right, it was something of a weakness.
His legs buckled, and Dean gently rolled him onto his side once the orgasm had ridden its course. Castiel’s eyes fluttered closed, but he did open them a crack when Dean tugged his jaw down, opening his mouth and sliding fingers in. It took a moment, but he realized his own cum was on them, which he obediently sucked off. Dean repeated this twice more, cleaning up the cum and sliding it into his mouth.
The Omega found it funny at the time. He found it less funny when he was put in the man’s shoes a few weeks later. It wasn’t the drive to South Dakota he minded. It was feeling like he was facing a firing squad when they got there. Particularly since by then it was April and Missouri had pinned his due date in July. Snow had melted and heat was setting in. Considering Omegas retained heat the worst out of all three breeds, he was sweating more often than not.
The Alpha hitched his hips up a little, sliding a hand around until his fingers brushed the crack between his Omega's cheeks. A soft whine reached his ears as his lips curled up in a satisfied smile. Castiel was already wet for him, slick dripping from his entrance in need. He shifted his weight so he could use both hands, pulling both cheeks apart.
He straightened, leaving the table and striding towards the door. Castiel was on his heels, a faint smile on his face. Perhaps it was silly, but it gave him something of a warm and fuzzy feeling, being defended in such a manner.
“Yeah, right. Okay, so we’ve got another ten questions we’re gonna go through. These were taken from the most popular suggestions, including one I’m told Cas here was nagged about personally. Yeah, I know, there’s a lot more, but let’s take it in stride. Also before I forget, tune in tomorrow morning for my first shot at a Live Stream. Me and Cas finally haggled out an arrangement for a video with Baby.”
Castiel’s stent on the battlefront, fighting for his life and those of his soldiers, had only lasted six months. To this day it was the longest he’d been parted from his mate. Never had he thought such a thing would cause him pain, and never in his angelic life had he felt a pain like it. Not physical, he’d had the healers check. It had been something in his head, they’d said, though the pain emanated from his chest. The letters had helped, but he’d only been at peace when he’d been allowed to rejoin his mate. For his part, Dean had been outraged, refusing to provide the Angels with anything until Castiel was returned. He hadn’t known until some time after his return, but the less patient of his cohorts had tried to force more information out of him. Dean hadn’t mentioned it, likely because they hadn’t succeeded. Only in recent times, when higher ranking Demons had been captured, had he begun relaying things he’d learned at Alistair’s side.
“Who the hell did this?” Dean demanded, though he did as he was told. Both of them winced at the wheeze being hoisted off the ground caused, but at least the Alpha tried not to jostle him as they hurried him back to the house.
"You're making a life, Cas. I know you deal with a lot of magic and shit but come on. That's awesome."
The Angel blinked, realizing he’d gone still, his face blank. He jerked back, fumbling to palm his blade in one hand and putting on one of the brass knuckles with the other. The second he thrust at Dean, saying, “My base is under attack. Hannah only has three others with her right now, and she says there’s thirteen of them.”
Or at least that was his hope. Castiel got all the buttons undone, sliding one hand around to the small of Dean's back and slipping fingers under the waistband of Dean's boxers as his boyfriend fumbled for his belt. He was working on a fresh hicky just above a delightfully freckled collar bone when feet smacked down the stairs on the opposite side of their wall.
In a heartbeat Castiel repositioned himself, putting his back to Dean and backing closer to him until he had all three in his sightline. “Stand down,” he ordered, tone hard.
“I said he’s my brother.” He was quiet for a beat, then added, “Always knew he’d do better. Live longer. Nice to have it confirmed is all. Kill the light before you finish me, would ya? Last request?”
“The ward tends to work best if you don’t fight it. I was worried if you were aware it might interfere. I anticipated your displeasure when you found out, and I am sorry, but….considering the circumstances I thought it a worthy price to pay. As for my mother, the only reason I did not return the favor is because that would have sealed my fate. If we’re lucky, she will attempt an approach again and I will have an excuse to remove her from this world permanently.”
He’d like to test that, but…later. He was tired, and he was due back on duty in another ten hours. Reaching up to take his chin between thumb and forefinger, Castiel mused, “There’s a lot I’d like to surprise you with, but I’m afraid most will have to wait. Will you settle for christening the backyard?”
"Thank you," he said absently as he crossed the threshold. "Yes, he did. I got the papers last night. Oh, and Michael let me use all the computers at his business."
Mutely, he reached over to shove up his own sleeve, baring the markings he’d spent countless hours staring at. When he looked back up at his soulmate, they were rolling their sleeve back down and turning their attention back to him. The glow finally faded from their eyes, and though it was hard to tell he was fairly sure they were still blue.
For all they were in obvious pain, the Demon still glowered at him darkly, lips curling back in a snarl. “Say I did have an amulet, why would I let you have it?”
Castiel thought fast, gripping his blade tight. He’d stupidly left the brass knuckles in his trench coat, but then he didn’t want to get in close quarters with Abaddon. Nor did he want to send his squadron to the slaughter by summoning them here.
The Omega strode down the steps, circling the house, Dean falling in step with him. “Where is he?” He’d jammed his feet into a pair of old boots, barely laced enough so he wouldn’t step on the laces.
Castiel hummed what sounded like an agreement. He straightened, then reached down to pull the Omega upright. One foot wouldn't support his weight, but otherwise he could stand just fine. "Like hell you're going inside. You're going to the hospital."
Dean grimaced, but didn’t answer, for multiple reasons. The cameras might be on a loop, but Charlie had made it very clear that the audio was still active. This old coot had actually gone for the good tech. Even if this wasn’t the case, he had a damn penlight between his teeth.
Well, it made sense. He’d heard Hell had become somewhat divided since Lucifer had been letting new Demons take power. Considering it was hard earned he had thought it understandable, even though it meant he had new problems to deal with.
As soon as the camera was off Castiel demanded, “Why didn’t you mention the prospect of more before we started the video?”
He was setting his trunk outside, by the Impala, when he noticed Tessa walking up the lane. He turned to face her, frowning.
Gabriel chuckled. “At least I won’t have to.” He hesitated a moment, then said, “If you do this, I’ll owe you. I already owe you for what you’ve done. I know you don’t go looking for favors, but don’t try to tell me this didn’t cross your mind.”
The snowman’s base was the size of an exercise ball when they were done, Samandriel helping to pack on handfuls of snow for a somewhat lopsided effect. The middle section was beachball sized, and a bit more rounded. Dean had sent Samandriel to find suitable arms, then gone to fetch coal from the shed. He even had a carrot in the fridge for a nose.
The words had barely left his mouth when the side doors, the ones that apparently hadn’t been bolted, began to bang. They hurled themselves against the wall, back into their frames, then back out again. Over and over, adding to the chorus of increasingly loud pounding and shrieking wind outside. Yes, alright, they were in Kansas, but they had alarms for tornadoes. This was not a tornado. These people wouldn’t look scared shitless if it was just a tornado. Even Azazel and the dragons looked genuinely afraid.
Castiel took over the camera as they left the store, transferring bags to Baby’s trunk before climbing back into her front seat.
“Don’t speak to the commander in such a fashion,” Hannah protested, bristling. She always was a stickler for protocol. It could be problematic at times.
Hazel frowned, trying to think over what all Dad had done since he’d gotten here. He hadn’t been rude, he hadn’t raised his voice, he hadn’t even used any bad words. That last one was what Papa had insisted on last night when he’d been able to confirm he could come today. Hazel didn’t even mind it would mean the swear jar wouldn’t get anything for a day or two. That jar paid for their Saturday ice cream and pie date. Every Saturday afternoon, even if he had to come home from work, Dad would take her to Uncle Gabby’s Tricks and Treat’s shop. She would get ice cream, two scoops of cookies ‘n cream with chocolate sprinkles, and Dad would get a slice of pie. He couldn’t choose a favorite flavor, so it rotated based on what they had. They would sit in the corner window table if it was raining, on an outside table under an umbrella if it wasn’t. He worked a schedule that wasn’t always predictable, but he always made sure they had their Saturday. It was time she had Dad all to herself.
“Not yet,” interjected Lilith, eyes still on Dean. Charlie didn’t like the way she was eyeing him. “Perhaps there’s a chance of redemption here. That is the Alpha you bred with, correct?”
When she seemed satisfied with this, Jo released him and shuffled over to Dean in turn. He cracked a grin at his shivering sister, swinging her around a bit before dropping her back down to her feet. “Cold, Jo?”
Dean's eyes narrowed, but Castiel pressed a hand to his shoulder, guiding him away. He'd been too out of it during their initial mating, but a week or so afterward he'd marked his mate as Dean had him. Gabriel had barely waited a day, seeing as he was in a more open environment. Both Alphas had been more than willing to bear their marks in turn.
Samandriel drifted over to the cooling pie, sniffing the lattice-topped surface as his parents bickered. You got used to it. The day they stopped bickering was the day he’d call in all his siblings for an emergency family meeting.
"Since always." Castiel closed the flask, trying not to think about where it'd come from. "It's one of our best kept secrets."
Trying to tell himself it was foolish to be more worried about facing them down than his own mother, Castiel went to take the chair obviously meant for him. He cupped the warm mug between his hands, bringing it up to inhale the rich scent of java. Without looking up he asked, “What do you wish to know?”
“Mmm, that’s it, good boy,” the Alpha rasped, kissing him slowly. “So pretty on my knot. Stupid bastard doesn’t know what he lost. My pretty little Omega. Can’t wait until you’re healed up, going to have some real fun then.”
Before either Castiel or Sam could comment Dean came up behind them, hands in his pockets. "What's the holdup?"
“You enjoy some of them as well,” Castiel protested, folding his arms. “And I’m not the one obsessed with Dr.- “
The Omega stared at him. Castiel didn’t swear often. Not unless he was worked up about something or they were being intimate. “Is that what you think- “
Gingerly, he let his own grace out a bit more, but only for a moment. If it was a friend, they would know to approach him before conclusions were drawn. If not, their reluctance would be answer enough.

“I’m sure.” Smiling, he leaned up on his toes so he could lightly kiss Dean’s forehead. “I appreciate your concern, love.”
Very much regretting opening his mouth, the Angel turned away, only to freeze when Dean caught his arm.
Pocketing the notes and coins, Castiel set about warding the cabin. Nothing fancy, he could add more later, but enough to shield it from notice for the short term. Only when he was sure he’d done a passable job did he take flight again, going high enough to scan the surrounding hundred-mile radius or so. There were a few small, scattered towns about, but considering it was roughly midnight in this time zone he’d have to find something that was open so late. As it was he had to fly nearly two hundred miles to the nearest settlement.
“The only reason we were able to afford what we did was because neither of us wanted a wedding,” Castiel added. “We simply went to the courthouse and were witnessed by family members and a few close friends.”
Dean looked like he wanted to say something, but then he glanced at the guards. They were a safe distance away, but they were watching the Demons with weapons at the ready, just waiting for them to make a wrong move. He hesitated, then pressed a hand to the side of Sam’s neck.
The Alpha grimaced, glancing at him ruefully. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry, I’m just…yes I’m in withdraw and it’s not fun but it will be worth it. Besides, secondhand smoke is very unhealthy. Especially for pups.”
He could actually feel the last of his concerns melting away as the Demon grabbed him by the lapels, yanking them flush, arms wrapping around his neck as he kissed him. Castiel reached up, stroking his fingers through Dean’s hair. It had gotten longer since he’d been here, but he wore it cut short along the sides and back of his head, longer on top. It was still just as soft as it had been in their last encounter.
Dean looked around Baby’s interior slowly, gears churning as they pulled forward. It was cool out, enough that the heater was on. It was rattling, but that was normal. Legos he and Sammy had shoved in there ages ago. The windows were up, which…didn’t make sense. Yes it was cold enough to warrant the heater usage, but whenever Dean got into the car with Castiel like this the windows were always rolled down. It was one of his own rules, the only way Castiel was allowed to smoke in Baby was if he was in dire need and the windows were rolled down. It had been cause for more than one fight over the years. Once he’d even kicked Castiel out of the car because it was practically a blizzard and the Alpha needed a fix bad but refused to let in the ice to get it. Granted Dean had doubled back to get him less than a mile later, but he’d made him put the smokes in the trunk so as to remove temptation.
“I suppose I’m relieved, as well as happy. I enjoy spending time with you. I don’t look forward to returning.” As the Alpha turned under his hands so he could wrap his arms around Castiel’s waist he added, “I realize I won’t have to worry about that soon enough, but…”
The smile she gave him was downright predatory. “You’re good,” she purred. “You made me drop my gun.”
The floors were swept stone, dead torches attached to the walls at regular intervals. There was not a bone or piece of trash in sight. It even smelled nice, no doubt due to the seven vases of fresh flowers scattered around the room. The fire pit was dead, and near it was what appeared to be food stores. Cabinets with dishes and utensils and spices and two loaves of bread. There were also several slabs of cooked venison on the small table, one that came with mismatched chairs.
“How’s Sam doing in Heaven? Is he on house arrest? Is he in one piece? Does ‘Haven’s most terrifying weapon’ have to walk him on a leash?” Considering he was dying, the Demon managed to sound impressively cocky.
The Alpha didn’t answer right away. He was gripping the steering wheel with white-knuckled hands, eyes narrowed as he sniffed, taking short, shallow breaths. His head tilted slightly, eyes narrowing. “I am sorry. I thought…I had thought I was accustomed to your scent.”
Balthazar was leaning back in his seat, arms folded, eyes narrowed suspiciously. "Did you do something? Is that why you've been acting funny? Grandma won't punish you because you made a mistake."
Hurridly he jammed the garage door button, ducking inside and shutting that door on his heels. He dumped the mail on the kitchen counter, grabbing the envelope and ripping it open. Fingers a little unsteady, he pulled out the letter inside and unfolded it. He read it over hurridly, then made himself slow down.
“Thanks.” He braced a hand on the coffee table, which he’d been slumped over in an uncomfortable position, and carefully dragged his feet under him. Sam grabbed his arm, helping him as he carefully straightened. His back ached, but more like it had taken a beating than sprouted wings.
“Choosing to be selective in lovers is hardly unnatural. Just because we need not worry about illnesses- “
If Balthazar was annoyed now, Castiel didn’t look forward to them finding out about all the shots they’d be getting. They wouldn’t be alone, they’d come up with a few new ones since he’d spent any amount of time among humans, but he wasn’t sure how much that would ease things. He was pleased with how far human medicine had come, certainly an improvement on days when blood letting and quick-sawing surgeons were considered ‘the best’. They may or may not work, but they certainly couldn’t hurt, and if it meant they wouldn’t have to endure chicken pox or worse like he had he was willing to let a human doctor stab them. Balthazar and Charlie would need some sort of program, according to Dean, to make up for not having had them when they were younger. Samandriel too, most likely. At least the one still growing inside him could get them on a traditional schedule.
He missed a second duty rotation on the healer’s orders, consuming extra rations and resting. He still looked a bit battered, his body bruised, but the major wounds were closed and mostly healed. Castiel commended their work, adding Uriel’s ill-gotten weaponry to their arsenal. He logged them as such, then helped himself to the brass knuckles. They struck him as something handy to have, particularly since he was down a blade.
Castiel had no idea how wet he was, Dean was lapping it up as quick as he could produce it. Meanwhile his cock was very hard, every time he gave in and gave a little buck into the Alpha’s touch it would bounce against his stomach, smearing precum. His thighs quivered as a second finger joined the work, spreading him a bit so Dean would have more space to work with.
When he went limp Castiel actually felt consciousness slip away briefly, his eyes sliding closed as teeth detached from the new mate mark. Still, it couldn't have been too long, as knots generally stayed for about half an hour. Dean's was still inside him when he stirred, feeling idle kisses being pressed along his neck and shoulders as fingers stroked his hair in a remarkably pleasurable fashion. He hummed happily, leaning into the touch.
Castiel managed to tug off his jacket and shirt as Dean kissed him breathless, drawing the Omega's own shirt over his head before descending onto his neck. Their belts went next, then Dean's boots and socks. The Alpha dumped his breathless boyfriend onto the bed, taking a moment to yank off pants and underwear in a single maneuver before taking care of his own. Castiel scooted himself farther up the bed before Dean crawled over him, attacking his mouth again. Long, nimble fingers tangled in his hair, a leg hitching itself around the Alpha's hip.
Castiel turned, going back to the door. He was reaching to open it when he heard two grumped syllables. The Angel paused briefly, but then decided it would be best for their working relations that he act as though he hadn’t heard. Still, he appreciated the gesture. Not to mention the simple fact Castiel had never heard a Demon say “thank you” before.
At that he barked another laugh. “Let’s assume there actually are angels around. Do you really think one of them would get stuck with me as a soulmate? I’m not cut out for that, trust me. Even if I was, I don’t want to get stuck with some holier than thou dick.”
‘Wow’ was good, right? Castiel still might not have been convinced, if Dean hadn’t broken out into a wide grin. His shoulders sagged in relief, his eyes fluttering as a hand brushed over his scales.
Though Dean did occasionally give a sharp thrust, for the most part he settled into a steady rhythm that made the Angel moan. He even wrapped a hand around his cock, stroking it in tandem to his thrusts. Castiel was staring blearily up at him, panting, when Dean’s free hand moved to his shoulder, sliding up his arm until he reached his palm, lacing their fingers together. Castiel’s left hand still clung to his shoulder, but with his right he gladly clutched his lover’s hand. It struck him as an oddly tender gesture.
It took a minute before the Alpha caught up to him. Castiel let him get close, not bothering to turn and continue on just yet. He had to trigger this human's own instincts, the ones that would drive him to pursue an Omega in heat well beyond the point of clear-minded caution.
“I give you a flower and that’s how you thank me?” Dean demanded as Castiel went to place it on his trench coat, where it was tossed over the table.
Bobby came trotting over, one of the only other people here today, first aid kit in hand. “Damn it, what happened? Let me see.”
The Angel made himself walk rather than trot to the cabin, keeping his head, reaching up to knock briskly as a warning before opening the door. He closed the door, making it two steps before Dean came to meet him. He’d worried more than he’d wanted to admit, that there was a chance he’d been wrong, that he’d been tricked into letting his guard down, that Dean wouldn’t be here when he returned.
“You’re not a fool.” Backing away from the bed, he remembered the Demon’s initial greeting. “Did you consume all the food? I told you to make it last.”
The Omega froze at the greeting, eyes finally leaving his quarry to stare at the speaker. He was dismayed to realize he hadn’t even heard the car drive up. A newer car than Baby, different make, but still black. At first he wondered just who this was and why an Alpha would be here. Then he recognized him. Dean hadn’t mentioned Sam coming by today, or had he forgotten?
Even so, as he got closer Castiel realized he was actually missing the constant noise. He’d come to appreciate quiet, but this noise he didn’t mind so much. It was…subdued. Just there to indicate life or divert a bored mind.
Castiel pocketed his phone, going back to using both hands. Dean had been out on a werewolf case out in Portland this week, it would be nice to have him back again. These days Sam was knee deep in books, but when breaks allowed he did join Dean on the road for a more local hunt. Castiel did too, but it was easier for him. Sam's scholarship didn't cover everything, only half the housing cost and no other living expenses, though it did wonders to just cover tuition and books. Accordingly, as the only member of the trio with no record and the one with the least investment in anything else, Castiel had managed to get a job within walking distance of their tiny two bedroom apartment. He got as many shifts at the Gas-'N-Sip as they would let him have, plus any he could pick up for the other workers. He spent as much time there as he did at home, sometimes more. Ergo when he suddenly needed five days off here or a week there, the general manager was more than happy to give it. Particularly considering he was a model employee. Always on time, never clocked out early, diligent, well mannered, and efficient.
Castiel shivered, dropping his gaze, stroking Jimmy’s hair. It had been an honest accident, but he was looking forward to the results. They’d agreed to keep things tame in the presence of their children, for all they both delighted in making their kits shriek in horror and dismay when they kissed. As much as Castiel loved being dominated in every aspect, he wanted them to grow up knowing the difference between a healthy relationship and an unhealthy one. That said, he rarely left the tower. Today had been one of the two trips he was allowed to take to a monastery each year, provided he was neither pregnant nor nursing. He was allowed to leave at sunrise and required to return by noon, and normally he was quite good at following those rules. He had flowerbeds, a small vegetable garden, even bee boxes to call his own in the safe confines of his tower home. Dean had ensured it, to make it easier for him to remain within the walls where he would be easier to protect. There were other rules too, but that was the major one. Don’t go outside the perimeter, and if you do don’t stay out longer than your allotted time. But on those occasions he was unable to follow those rules, Dean either took extenuating circumstances into account or Castiel gracefully accepted his punishment.
Dean drove out to the gated neighborhood across town, the first time he'd actually used the gate as he was supposed to. There was no guard there at this hour, he just had to punch in the code Castiel had given him. The streets were otherwise silent as Baby rumbled passed house after large, fancy house, then pulling into an otherwise empty driveway. The Alpha hurriedly cut the engine, climbing out and trotting to the front door. Before he could do more than reach out to knock the door was jerked open, Castiel pulling him inside and shoving it shut again.
Castiel stood right where he was, watching as Dean stepped back and trotted back to the cabin. He came back a minute later, as promised, even took the liberty of rolling his trench coat around in the brush to dirty it up a bit before helping the Angel into it. As he did, Castiel saw the flower tucked into an inner pocket. Inconspicuous like.
The Omega sat cross-legged next to the human, moving his head and shoulders into his lap. As he'd done three times in the past Castiel laid a hand on either side of his face, bracing the heels of his hands against his temples and wrapping fingers around his jaw. This was a part of the breeding process. Once they were old enough every will-o'-the-wisp knew this. He knew how to make it quick and clean, painless even if the Alpha in question wasn't in a magically drug-induced slumber.
Samandriel threw open his door, lurching out with a sigh as he got upright again. He slammed the door shut, casting a general net out. It was subtle, just enough for him to feel where everyone was. Instantly he got a returning wave from inside the house, and a warm wordless greeting from his mother. A beacon of contented anticipation was radiating from the garage, which wasn’t at all surprising.
"It must be getting desperate," Castiel mused. That last bit of shouting had been in Sam's voice. "I'm surprised it's being so persistent."
A frown crossed Dean’s face, his eyes darting down briefly then back up again. He only had the one necklace, one he never took off. A small bronze idol on a sturdy black thong. Sam had given it to him when they were pups as a Christmas present.
Samandriel remained quiet as he grew up, more interested in books than sports, happy to do his schooling online so he wouldn’t have to deal with crowds. Eventually, when Dean pointed out social skills were a survival tool, they coaxed him into trying new things. Granted this just led to the chess club, but at least he made friends.
Dean had declined his help, for all he mumbled a reluctant thanks before fleeing the janitor’s closet he’d been yanked into. As soon as he was home he and Sam got together what they could carry and went to Bobby’s. Their surrogate uncle had had an idea of what was going on, but had been unable to do anything and was furious because of it. He’d gladly taken them in, offering them shelter while the CPS representative Dean had called talked to them.
He was pulling up weeds from his bed of dahlia’s when their back door opened, boots making their way out onto the porch. Castiel only turned to look back when he heard slow footsteps making their way towards him. He frowned, sitting back on his heels and tipping his hat back a bit to get a better look at Dean’s face.
It took well over an hour before they were able to leave, though thanks to the medication they had to roll him out to the Impala via wheelchair. A crutch went in the backseat, and Castiel parked long enough to call in the medication. That done he drove them home, and Dean found himself in a very light mood now that the pain was gone.
Bobby had the feed from a camera pointed directly at the middle bay filling one screen, and was fast-forwarding through the morning. It was a little disorienting, seeing himself and Benny darting around at hyper speed. When he got closer to the current time, Benny slowed to normal speed. They watched as the Jeep Wrangler was pulled into the bay, the hood lifted, he and Benny taking a look. There was some back and forth, Dean stepped away briefly to grab a rag….then it happened.
"Won't work until I go off the birth control," the Omega gasped as his pants and underwear were pulled off at once. "And heat suppressants."
Castiel spared a glance for the clock. He had a minute, maybe less before the bell went off and his class fled. “Anymore questions?”
“I know a guy,” the Demon mused, tone thoughtful. “He got his hands on a few of these, melted them down into bullets. You guys got anything like that?”
His husband grimaced. “Yeah. Captain America was a close second, but…cowboys.” Castiel was smiling as he added, “What about you?”
"Ditto." Gabriel flicked his magazine closed, rolling off the bed and wandering over. "They're just having a pricy bitch fit. Hate to break it to you, but you're going home empty handed."
Choosing to ignore this argument, as usual, Castiel turned back to the original question. “I also enjoy reading and hiking.”
At least he didn’t yell at someone to boil water this time. He did that during a false alarm when Gabriel was visiting, and the elder Omega had ended up on the floor howling with laughter. Castiel had thought it was amusing too, after the fact. At current he was just glad Dean focused his energies on riding the hospital staff. He’d called Missouri on the way over, and made an utter nuisance of himself breathing down necks until they got Castiel into a room. The Omega forbade him from annoying the staff after that, lest they get annoyed with them. That was the last thing he needed right now. At least he knew it wasn’t a lack of confidence in modern medicine that had Dean on edge, he was just panicking about the birth. Castiel had been assured this was absolutely normal, even if it was unpleasant.
The Omega glanced over in time to see Castiel shove his mate and call him an assbutt, scowling at him.
“Hardly,” Papa grumbled into his milkshake. Worried blue eyes peered at her, and he asked slowly, “Are you okay with this?”
Charlie felt the shock before the outrage overwhelmed it. Apparently Balthazar hadn’t told him yet, or he’d lied well enough to keep the truth hidden.
And this was why it was almost noon and Dean still had questions. He’d gotten a lot of answers, but Castiel tended to go down rabbit holes if you let him. He’d spent far too much time just talking about bees, and Dean had no idea how they’d landed on the damned things to start with.
Dean started laughing. “We started arguing. It got heated, it got loud. They called security to escort us out. We got banned from the university library. You think they’ve got our mugshots somewhere in there still?”
Sure enough Sam was still walking along the side of the road, bag over one shoulder. He slowed, turning to look over his shoulder as Dean brought the Impala to a stop. Castiel rolled down his window as the Alpha leaned over and called, "Get in."
Benny slowly took his arm back, examining it himself. Turning it this way and that, flexing his hand into a fist then splaying his fingers, poking at his own flesh and squinting at it from close range. “Huh.”
“Dude, you remember the exact date of when we met, when we got married, you remember birthdays, anniversaries, random holidays. You’d forget to tie your shoes if you didn’t trip over the laces, but you can tell me when Pi Day is. And yes there is such a day.”
As his lollipop's tart cherry flavor rolled over his tongue, he took his time in watching the human before him work under an equally cherry red hood. He kept a 1966 Ford Mustang Convertible in a nearby storage unit, to enjoy during his occasional romps into the human world. While normally he went out of his way to maintain it, today he'd committed something of a transgression against the car gods. He'd driven it halfway across a state, then pulled over just outside a town to pop the hood and find something minor to damage. Enough to warrant a trip to a mechanic, but not enough to cause serious damage or keep it from being driven.
“I pulled into this diner just sitting in the middle of nowhere, and he’s standing outside the payphone like he’s waiting for a bus.”
All in all it was a very long, tiring day. It was also one of the most enjoyable Castiel had had in some time.
The elder Omega heaved a sigh. “Fine.” He was hungry too. And it had been a long time since he’d had some good French fries.
Castiel froze, along with every other member of his squadron. He half turned, staring at the Demon, feeling the grace leave his eyes. Dean wandered forward, cocky smile on his pretty lips, no doubt enjoying keeping the Angels off kilter.
"They weren't even aware I was dating. They didn't notice and I didn't go out of my way to tell them. At the time I was afraid they'd keep me from leaving if they were made aware. Now I suppose it would have to entail Gabriel's death or the production of a grandchild."
“Found a book seller who was willing to trade it for a few month’s salary,” Bobby muttered into a beer bottle.
It seemed a casual enough greeting, though he was keeping an eye on the perimeter as much as he was the exchange.
“We need to work extra shifts now so we can still pay rent when we have to take off for exams,” Benny reminded her. “We can’t all work from home.”
Despite his own misgivings over his son's prank the Omega felt his own lips twitching in amusement. "Perhaps to you. You did not have to apologize to the mother of the child he gave the prototype to."
“When I got down there I asked him just what he thought he was doing. The deal was ten years, not ten days. He said ‘accidents happen’. Some shit about he can’t control everything. I called him on his bullshit, and he sent me down anyway. Five months later, Sam shows up. Apparently that fucker let a few more accidents happen. They made it to the ship. They made it to a trading post where they could go someplace to start over, but by then things had run out. Sam found a place, laid out a plan, then found a crossroad. He knew what I’d done, he always was smart. He told me later he’d gone back alone to find me. Found what was left of me. He’s too smart to be an idiot, but he still made another deal. It was the same Demon, too. Said if he could guarantee all three of them made it safe and intact, he’d get his soul. They made it, but there was a riot in a market a few days after Sam had found work and a roof to live under. He got caught in it. Couldn’t get out fast enough. Someone pushed him into the town well. We couldn’t swim, and no one found him fast enough.”
Dean kept staring, even as the angel bent to pick up the bottle, putting it in the trash and cleaning up what had spilled. He knew Castiel was his soulmate, had been very aware from the jump that the angel’s preferred humanoid form was male, but honestly it was something he had managed to successfully avoid thinking about. Maybe once upon a time he’d thought he might swing both ways, but among John’s other shinning qualities was intense homophobia. Neither Bobby nor Jody would condemn him for such things, but by then it had been firmly anchored in the ‘deal with it later’ column.
Rather than answer the Omega turned himself around, taking the Alpha's face in his hands. He brushed the human's temples with his thumbs, gazing into eyes not yet glazed with lust. This human truly was a rarity, beautiful and gentle and tender. It would be a shame to kill him.
“Dean…what the hell happened?” Sam spread his hands as he asked, brown eyes worried and dead serious. It took a moment, just because it didn’t make much sense, but something very important clicked.
Dean's hand curled into a fist on the door frame, rage starting to build up in his chest once more. His first instinct was to go after his brother, try to call him, anything. Any other day he would have done it without a second thought, but any other day he didn't have a rattled mate on his hands.
“No!” Dean protested, pulling away to glare at him. “Hell no, Cas, you’re on a roll. You’re off and you’re gonna stay off, you hear me?”
Bess reached over, putting a hand on Garth’s arm and giving it a squeeze. “If you haven’t convinced him yet, I don’t think you will now.” After a beat she added, “It’s not like he’ll be able to make this mistake twice.”
The Angel’s last trip was to acquire a meal. He was glad to be done with it all by that point, more overwhelmed by the supplies than the actual healing he was carrying out. Deciding he deserved a treat, he found a pizza establishment and ordered four of them. One was just for himself, the other three were for Dean, seeing as he would need something to eat in Castiel’s absence. Perhaps it would even last a day.
Castiel was trying to decide how to answer that when the door was pushed open, making Jo stumble. She jerked around, and was met with Dean’s scowl. The Omega’s heart had just enough time to sink when he realized it wasn’t directed at him. Dean was scowling at his sister.
A flicker of guilt sparked in the Omega's eyes. "Yes. Once. When I was very young. I can't remember what I was angry about, but....I started a forest fire. It didn't go far, a storm began not long after my tantrum. When it was over and I'd calmed down I saw what'd become of the land. Everything was gone. There were skeletons in the ashes. No human ones, but..."
“Alright, you’re turn. Last one.” Dean turned his attention and his camera on Lucifer, circling around him.
About an hour after they’d left Mary’s, when the hot coca was finished and the barrage of less-than-quality Christmas songs on the radio were beginning to annoy Dean, Castiel cleared his throat. “Would you like to do a few questions now?”
His brother had the decency to wait until they were in the street to demand, “You warded your human?”
They’d been having a nice conversation, Dean grumbling as they ganged up on him regarding his lacking table manners the moment he had his favorite food in front of him, when the door opened. Castiel hadn’t known why at the time, but every singe family member had frozen, Dean going ridged at his side. At first things had been tense but not explosive. Castiel had initially introduced himself as a friend from college before anyone could say otherwise, but before he could shake John’s hand Dean had grabbed it, lacing their fingers together. Even before he’d stated the truth John’s face had gone red. Amid all the yelling that ensued as Dean stood up for both himself and his then-boyfriend, the extent of John’s prejudice had come to light. Mary had joined the argument at that point, furious that he’d raised a hand to their son. Castiel had tried to stay out of it as much as he could, but then John had turned on him, apparently convinced he’d somehow managed to do something to his son. Just when it looked like he was about to start swinging Mary had kicked him out of the house with an ultimatum. He could either accept all his children as they came and come back in the morning, or he could be a stubborn bastard about it and come back in the morning to pack up his things. His response had been to disown Dean. Mary had promised to have all his things boxed up in the yard by morning.
He watched as the sigils began to glow, the guards stepping back. He expected this. He also expected Gabriel as he stepped out of the light. What he didn’t expect was the second, much taller person who stepped out with him. He heard Dean’s breath hitch, but even as Castiel registered the non-feathered wings his new mate was lurching forward.
Trying to ignore the irritation that sparked at the 'one stupid Alpha' comment, Castiel stated, "Dean."
Castiel peeked long enough to see the Demon march over to the refrigeration unit. Then he folded his arms on the table, using them as a pillow, eyes closed. Perhaps he should have slept more.
“Indeed.” Uriel studied him for a moment more, then offered, “Would you mind if I accompanied you for the rest of this patrol? Let me satisfy my concerns, then you can reclaim your solitude.”
“Alistair never gave a shit about safety. Last I checked Men of Letters didn’t care about their attack dogs much either.”
Dean took off his sunglasses, squared ones he liked because they reminded him of the movie-star kind, and looked directly into the camera.
“Did this dick even change the oil?” Dean wondered aloud, only to wince as he pulled out the dipstick. Judging by the coal-like coloring at its end, that would be a ‘no’.
“I didn’t, but it’s a circle, remember? Not an exact border. It goes out into the back a little. Close enough for me to get to some of the plants.” He folded his arms, a frustrated scowl on his face. “Jeez, Cas, there ain’t no pleasing you, is there?”
"So do you, but last I checked being a hunter doesn't pay the bills. And to answer your question, poker. Well, I do make candy and deserts to sell at farmers markets, but mostly poker."
Castiel looked up at the sharp demand, absently munching on his last slice of olive and extra cheese pizza. “’Well’ what?”
The Omega stirred, trying to sit up at his mate's voice. He sounded upset. Unfortunately the movement sent a jolt of pain up his shoulder, making him suck in a sharp gasp.
Castiel made a face. “I’m punctual when it matters. When there were reservations or a movie with a specific time I never ran late.”
“Yeah, but not tonight.” He’d waited eight years, he could wait a little longer. That was one thing Bobby and Jody had enforced over the years, they weren’t about to let him become one of those people so obsessed with finding their soulmate they ran their life into the ground. He was welcome to dig and hunt all he wanted, but sooner or later he’d need a life to come back to. It was something Dean appreciated as he got older, witnessing such fallout firsthand. Currently, it meant he had classes to get to in the morning, a job to clock in at.
Castiel did not rush back to the cabin. He did that very deliberately. He was no lovesick fledgling. But if he was efficient in his duties, no one could fault him that.
“For now. I’m…I’m tired, and I’ve got enough to deal with. I’ll start looking again when this settles down.”
“Well I assume you were both trying to kill each other whenever you’ve met one,” Castiel pointed out. He kept one ear cocked towards the road, but so far he hadn’t heard anyone. His senses were sharper this way, far more than a human’s. His ears sat atop his head on either side, not unlike a horse’s in shape and just as scaled as the rest of him.
Every now and then, when he started to overflow the basement, Bobby would help him make a run to the local shelters. Though that had only happened twice, mostly because word got around he was willing to part with things for minimal payment. Depending on the person he'd set different parameters regarding payment. For friends who were fellow students and/or on a tight budget he'd take a dollar per item. Charlie and Jo both went to him for quality feminine products and made him promise to help with their wedding. He'd offered more, but despite the fact they scraped by in a tiny studio apartment they generally refused. For others, who were in the same situation he and Sammy had been in, it was reduced to either a penny per item or nothing at all. It was advertized by word of mouth only, to help ensure only those who needed it came knocking. Castiel was honestly quite impressed with the entire system.
Castiel giggled softly at the sensation. “Yes, my love. I look forward to a repeat performance. You do have a promise to keep, don’t forget. I expect another kit before the year is out.”
Castiel smiled sleepily, stroking his face and kissing lazily up his arm as Dean rode it out. He didn’t lie down so much as he collapsed on his side, the Angel rolling over a bit to face him. For a long minute Castiel lay there, staring at the blitzed-out Demon before him. It hit him then, that whatever doubts he might have harbored were evaporated. This beautiful creature cared for him, though why he wasn’t sure. But he did. And Castiel cared for him in turn, more than he had any other being since his human birth. Well, perhaps not his children, but it was hardly in the same manner, thank you.
Dean was standing at the sink, rinsing dishes and placing them in one of the many new inventions humans had these days. A dishwasher, Castiel believed it was called. Considering how long he'd anticipated this, planned things to say or ways to make himself known...it was suddenly very difficult to follow through.
“Fair point,” Dean admitted. He’d taken a few steps back and was slowly circling the Omega, openly staring at him. “You, uh, spend a lot of time like this?”
Satisfied his patient would last the night, Castiel washed the blood from his hands and checked the money box. He carried human currency, but it was from his last light-duty posting. America, not Canada. He’d need Canadian currency if he was to purchase supplies.
Only when he was satisfied they’d be oblivious to his presence, save the sigils if they ever dealt with other Angels, did Castiel start seriously searching their bunker. He checked the front rooms, but while he did find an arsenal and a lot of salt, there were no tools for spell work. Seeing as there was no attic, he turned his attention to the basement.
“No, turkey dance. It’s why they strut and fluff their feathers, to attract mates. We do the same thing, traveling, making meals, participating in the rituals.”
“Every goody-two-shoes lies! No one’s that good, believe me. I’ve never met someone, Angel or not, that’s actually
He gave them a brief explanation, then urged them to bring him and the corpse back to base. Where it was safe. They didn’t question it, as much because it was true as because he was their commander. It was easy enough, and they flew him away from the hidden cabin without a second glance in its direction.
“What the hell?” Despite how much blood had managed to escape Benny’s body, the source of it all was nowhere to be found. He grabbed Benny’s wrist, turning his arm this way and that, even rubbing at the top of his forearm where the gash had been. Nothing. Not even a scar.
The store’s interior was clean, well kept and well lit, with an easy to navigate layout. He nodded to the clerk, who appeared to be working over a textbook and flash cards, then set about looking for what Dean had requested. He found the lube area easily enough, but he hadn’t anticipated there would be such…variety. It occurred to him, as he stared at over two dozen different bottles and tubes, that he really should have asked for specifics. At least water-based narrowed things down a little, but not over much. There was flavored lube, lube that would warm once applied, lube that would become chilled once applied, ‘natural’, even organic.
Before Dean could respond the bells were thrust into his hands anyway. He slowly sat down his crossbow so he could slip the stick off, giving one an uneasy tap. It sounded like a cowbell to him, but Castiel seemed so very proud of them.
In the end Castiel couldn't bring himself to do it. He knew he needed to, knew he should, but...he just couldn't. Not this one. Not Dean.
Smooth. Rich. Just like he remembered. Topping up his glass, Dean sat down with a fresh notepad and pen, carefully opening the book. He began reading through it, making notes, searching for any bit of information that stood out. It didn’t have to be new, just different. Sometimes a thing said in a different way meant a different thing, or hit differently, made a different connection.
It’s not the first time something like this has happened, it’s just the worst. Besides, I’m due for a change.”
It didn’t occur to Castiel until he was carefully shelving the fifth book he’d copied that Dean might be bored. But when he looked around the Alpha was sitting at one of the tables he wasn’t using for his work, feet propped on the table, chair tipped onto its back legs. His hands were laced behind his head, eyes lidded as they watched the Omega.
"Don't. I forgot he was here. Look, I really do stink, and I need to get some shuteye before tonight."
This was only broken when Dean asked, “You really like trench coats, don’t ya? I mean you got a new one right after I got the old one all bloody.”
“I thought not,” Castiel stated wryly, folding his arms. He chose not to tell the camera that his husband could be the jealous type. Dean wouldn’t cope well with the very idea of someone else kissing him, even if it was consensual and for a purpose. They’d once been in a rather busy bar near the end of happy hour, as they’d had excellent burgers and chili fries, when he’d gotten them both kicked out. Castiel had simply gone to the bar for refills, but as he’d been waiting for the bartender to refill their beer mugs someone had come up behind him and grabbed his ass. When he’d jerked away and turned to confront them, he’d found himself being forcibly kissed by a taller man who reeked of tequila and cigarettes. He’d barely managed to shove them away when Dean was dragging the guy off him, getting them clear of Castiel before he threw the first punch. Castiel didn’t enjoy confrontation most times, and while he’d been prepared to simply have the drunk thrown out he couldn’t say he hated seeing him being dealt with. For all that, he’d still been trying to drag his husband off him when security had thrown all three of them out.
Satisfied he had the thing assembled properly, Castiel carried his bowl into the bedroom. Dean had eaten both sandwiches by this point and was apparently chugging the whisky. There was only half the large bottle left.
They gave him an exasperated look, then reached over to grasp his wrist with one hand. “Teleportation. I can teach you, if you wish.” He spread his free hand over Dean’s knuckles, and a faint light shimmered beneath it. Dean, who’d been trying to jerk away, froze as the pain eased. He blinked, staring at his own hand as they took theirs away. He curled his fingers into a fist, then splayed them out again.
“Thank you, brother.” Castiel inclined his head solemnly, relieved. He’d been sure Gabriel would help, but nothing was certain. As it was, he knew only it being so out of character and the simple fact Gabriel could squash him like an insect if need be had led the Archangel do come out here like he’d asked. Most wouldn’t have, just on principle.
Castiel did like his independence, liked being able to do things without someone hovering over him and putting down irrational restrictions. That said...he was a romantic. It was the downside of his traveling, he'd seen too many happily mated couples. He wanted an Alpha of his own. Someone to coddle him and spoil him, guard him and have amazing sex with him. He
“You’re a marksman?” He’d heard the rumors, even witnessed it once. Key soldiers and leaders dropping dead with melted blade bullets in their skulls. Once he’d gone into battle alongside another, more experienced commander. The other Angel had fallen where he stood at their command post, a look of surprise on his face. He’d hit the ground below their barricade even before he realized what had happened, then given the order to retreat.
Castiel waited until the credits began to roll to rise to his feet, shuffling his wings at his back. “I need to fly another patrol.”
Slowly, the ringing in his ears, the pounding in his skull, and the burning in his eyes began to drop off. After a minute he felt like he could take his hands away from his ears, which he did. When he could bring himself to look around the darkened room, Bobby stood in the now open doorway, staring at him, face now invisible in the shadows. Benny was crouched next to him, hand still on his shoulder, but his blue eyes were a bit wide.
Yawning widely, Castiel flopped his wings against the ground to either side of him. Mmm, it was almost noon. The sun was warm overhead. Maybe he'd take a nap. Not very productive, but it would pass the time.
“What’s up world? Your friendly neighborhood Batman is back with your favorite Q&A, this time with a Christmas Special. Or holiday special. I know not everyone celebrates Christmas, but we do, so that’s what we’re going with.”
“We knew going in it’d be more work, and it wouldn’t look the same. But I think part of our mistake was going out to this place where you could cut the trees down yourself. I nearly lost a thumb when we were doing that part.”
One wing was still dark, wet, but the other was mostly dry at this point. Jet black feathers ruffled, glinting cobalt in the bathroom’s LED lights. So it hadn’t just been the blood or the water, these things really were black. That was…also odd.
Ignoring him, Castiel decided to keep his hands busy. He’d made himself do three circuits of his route, and planned to make more before his patrol was over, but he was still sore from his exercises. Perhaps he’d pushed too much, but at least it had had the desired effect. What’s more, the majority of his squadron was worse off than he was. Accordingly, he would be encouraging more strenuous drills to make up for the lack of action.
Anger flashed in Dean's eyes as he straightened, a muscle in his jaw jumping. "I never asked Cas to do any of this, not that I'm complaining about him leaving me alive. Not that it's any of your business but I've already offered, he's got a place with me if he ever needs it."
"Because he's unable to respond in that fashion, and telepathic invasion is considered rude to humans."
“Normally I do. But he was wounded, I thought I’d get some information before he expired. That led to my discovering he was more valuable alive than dead.” He opened the can of soup, putting it into a pot and turning on the stove to heat it. “Would you have done different?”
Dean took this as an affirmative, and proceeded to lower himself down. Castiel’s breath caught, eyes going wide, hands clamping down over Dean’s hips as tight heat began to close over his cock. First it was just the tip, then more and more, working its way down.
“It is. Please don’t make me tie you down. Don’t smile like that. If I tie you to the bed, you will be left for days and I won’t be relocating the TV.”
The moment he was clear of the higher branches Castiel flipped himself over, putting his feet towards the ground, bending his knees and throwing his wings wide. Impact was insignificant, for all he made a small crater in the dirt. Shaking himself off, Castiel set out on foot. There was only a sliver of moon overhead, barely visible in the sky as clouds drifted over it periodically. Here, beneath the canopy, the shadows were long and deep. A human would be blind. Thankfully, he wasn’t a human. He could use his grace for illumination if need be, but for his purposes he could see well enough.
Cas? No one had ever called him that before. It made his chest warm. "Yes. No one will hurt you, I've made sure of it. And assuming there's anything to what kept me from completing the ritual I'd like to pursue it."
“That bad,” Castiel sighed. “Question four. ‘What’s your favorite part of Thanksgiving?’ I think yours would be the food.”
“No, just…taking a break. I don’t think we’ll figure anything out now that we haven’t all day. I’ve got other shit going on, I can’t keep banging my head against a wall. You shouldn’t be either.”
Castiel’s eyebrows arched. John had finally gotten Sam to meet with him. It was in a public place, with Gabriel literally seated between them, but it had happened. From what he’d understood, it had gone as well as it could have. Dean texted their father sometimes, not nearly as much as his mother but there was something about once a week. Jo was still off-limits, apparently she was still holding a grudge and refusing attempts at amends until he’d patched things up between her brothers. That being said…Castiel had to give the man points for consistency, and persistence.
A pleased smile he couldn’t restrain tugged at the Angel’s mouth. It dimmed as something occurred to him, and he asked hesitantly, “Would you…be willing to continue? I know it wouldn’t be conventional, but…”
Dean heard the mutters as he hobbled into the lecture hall. He ignored them, or rather he tried to. He kept his head down, lowering himself into an aisle seat near the back, propping up his crutch and fishing his supplies from his backpack. He’d looked himself in the mirror this morning, when he’d been trying to decide whether it was safe to risk a shave or not. Not only had he concluded it wasn’t, but he’d gotten a good look at the state of himself. The cuts had all scabbed over, and half of his face was covered in an array of ugly, blotchy bruises. Ones that had become blue and purple, green starting to creep into the edges. More were scattered all over his body from head to toe, for all they weren’t quite as densely packed as those on his face. Despite it being June he’d worn jeans and a work boot on his good foot rather than cargo shorts, as he usually did when heat hit. The last thing he needed was more reason for people to stare as they were now. His right hand, the one with the stitches, was bandaged but he could use it. His left arm would be in a sling for a little while yet, which was remarkably annoying, for all he hadn’t been cleared to drive yet. Castiel had had to drive him to campus and would be picking him up to take him home between shifts. Though Dean had a sneaking suspicion he’d simply be brought to work where Castiel could keep an eye on him and his keep his doses regular.
He lightly kissed the tip of Castiel’s throbbing cock, then sat back so he could crawl over him. The Angel stared up at him, a little anxious for all he had no reservations about what they were doing. He’d just never been the…what had Dean called it? Catcher? It was a remarkably vulnerable position. And Dean had gladly taken it for him not a day ago.
Dad sighed, setting down his fork. “There’s a lot of people out there who…they have their heads up their butts.”
Dean shrugged, tone light as he said, “It’s beneficial for a Slayer to have a base, and your fief is centrally located. That tower is the perfect location for me.” His hand settling on Castiel’s head he added, “And it’s a safe place to keep my Omega when I’m not around.”
“Unfortunately,” Papa admitted. “We’re supposed to know better, but as you can see this isn’t always the case.”
He was still at it, intent on his work, when Dean went rigid, hands tightening on his shoulders, a strangled cry in his throat as he bucked jerkily into Castiel’s hand. The Angel hesitated, then kept going. From his masturbation sessions, which took place with more regularity than he’d ever admit, he knew it felt better if the stimulation kept going through the orgasm. Well, just because he was highly selective in his partners didn’t mean he had no needs.
A part of him did feel bad for keeping Sam out like this. Deciding to go it alone hadn’t come easy, and he’d only made up his mind a year ago. Sometimes he still wasn’t sure, but he was holding his ground. The fact was that, despite a lot of effort and a crap-ton of time, Dean still had no idea who his soulmate was. It could be another human, or it could not. If it was, then nothing much would happen at 4:00a.m. tomorrow morning. If it was, he’d know in short order. Either way, he didn’t want Sam seeing him then. Whether he went through a biological overhaul or hit an all-time low as nothing happened, he didn’t want his little brother to bear witness. He didn’t want anyone there, in fact he planned on locking himself inside for the whole day. He’d stocked up on jerky, bacon, pie, beer, and whisky for the occasion. Regardless of what happened, he had a feeling he’d be wanting to get drunk, and tomorrow it would actually be legal.
“Uh, yeah. I haven’t told anyone, but there’s a few people who’re gonna want some answers. Where you came from. Where they came from. Why they don’t have their vaccinations. It’d just be doctors and family, but…it’s up to you.”
“I should be asking you that. You need to eat something when we get home so you can take your next dose. Is something bothering you?”
“Of course I warded him,” Castiel scoffed, releasing Dean’s hand. “I’ve seen what happens when you enrage her. Dean, my home is approximately half a mile in that direction. Can you drive them up there? We have things to pack.”
“Alright, we’ve got to go face the music. If you have any question requests, re-tweet or comment. Cas has agreed to do this again for Christmas. Not sure why, but he’s awesome like that. If you like what you see, like, comment, and subscribe down below. Travel safe, and have a great holiday. Stay safe, Gotham!”
“What…why are you….” Healings didn’t usually hurt, but then that might just be the curse. According to Gabriel it didn’t hurt Sam.
Castiel took a step forward, but paused. His fingers went from his neck to his middle, to the white streaks he knew would never go away. There had been enough after Henry, but even more had shown up after the twins. He didn’t like them, was self-conscious of the white scars he’d acquired over the years, but Dean loved them. The dragon couldn’t fathom why, but he did.
“Easy girl,” Dean crooned, stroking her nose. His free hand, the one not firmly gripping her reins, moved back to stroke her neck. “Easy, Baby. This is a friend, alright? Friend. No biting.”
Dean rubbed the bridge of his nose. “This guy let his freaken’ phone die. That’s why he didn’t pick up when I tried calling him.”
“No, Cas, Betamax didn’t end well. You’re screwed on that. But Apple…” He cleared his throat. “They did good. Really good. And Monster. Still kinda surprised you went with that.”
Abruptly he stood, afraid to linger any longer. He fetched his satchel from the nest, then activated the covering spells. Once all trace of his presence was gone, swallowed by the bog, and Dean was safe to wake up and wander home, he turned his back on the Alpha. He shifted into his flame form, darting away into the night's sky.
"Thirty dollars. Maybe," was the absent response. Dean's attention was on confirming the tags that indicated the store sale for the pancake mix.
As fun as that had been, though, it made his chest warm and tight in a very nice fashion to have his mate make love to him on the Impala's backseat rather than simply fuck his brains out. Occasionally a car roared by outside, but he barely noticed. As far as he was concerned, his world was temporarily narrowed to him and Dean alone. Nothing else existed or mattered.
In his usual gruff fashion Dean grumbled something about him not making it home in a while and went to check the oven. Samandriel felt a warm smile tug at his face, and he sent a pulse of warm affection to the tie that still connected them. The human didn’t even flinch as he once had, though he did give the now-grown pup a sharp look.
“Less than a day.” He would have given a more exact time, but he was reluctant to grant a Demon any more knowledge of their ways than he had to. “Try to stay alive.”
Eventually, when his fingers were starting to prune, he drew himself upright again. He spread his wings wide, then pulled them in a bit, ruffling his feathers and giving them a shake. He carefully combed through each individual feather with his fingers, making sure they were clean of all dust, dirt, and whatever else.
Sam laughed. “Don’t worry, she won’t beat you up too bad. She helped design these.” He held up his left wrist, with the carefully fashioned silver cuff covered in sigils. “Adam’s happy in his Heaven, but she comes by sometimes. She’s really been getting into video games, it helps kill hours like you wouldn’t believe.”
“When they move…kinda.” Sam sucked in a breath, then reached down to turn on the showerhead. Water slowed to a trickle from the faucet and started blasting in a more dispersed fashion. “Want to try moving them again? Or just really thinking about them, or…something?”
There was someone crouching at the river’s edge, dipping their hands into clear water, using it to wash their hands and face. But this was no pretty female. Before him was a man covered in dirt, grime, and a filthy trench coat.
It took a few minutes, but eventually the creature was only double your average human height. They began walking forward, one purposeful step at a time, their voice going silent. Dean could feel every eye on him, his skin tingling, heart racing in his chest, but he couldn’t move. Wind still whipped through the warehouse, only aggravated by six, very agitated wings.
"What? She wanted to make sure I didn't die a crappy death. And I might have done some of my own digging in my spare time afterward. Not that I've gone after anything. You've got one of these, right?"
"Deal." Dean rested their foreheads together, eyes drifting shut. "Never thought I'd be reluctant to leave on a hunt."
Dean ducked his head, shuffling his feet before grabbing the buggy and marching it a few isles over, grabbing a loaf of bread. “Ready to hit the Halloween section?”
Castiel nodded, putting that one in the cart and replacing the bats projector on the shelf. “It’s been a while, but I’m assuming not.” Looking at the camera he suggested, “Why don’t you comment? It would be peace of mind to know if I was in the minority.”
“Why not?” Charlie protested. “We go through all this trouble and you’re not going to check the goods?”
With that, he handed Castiel the paper with their latest batch of questions. Per usual he’d filtered them out before selecting ten, putting them together to be read over during the video. Castiel had meant to look them over beforehand, but he’d never gotten around to it.
What he was looking up at now was absolutely nothing like anything he’d ever seen before. Not in paintings, not in drawings, not in sculpture, not in any depiction that had survived to the twenty first century. He knew, he’d looked. Though the more he stared, the more it occurred to him that he’d seen bits and pieces that might fit into what he was looking at. As if people had had an inkling that this sort of creature existed and had tried to depict them, with minimal success for their efforts.
He did find an unused sewing kit in one drawer, a first aid kit in another. None of the food was any good, some of it appeared to be attempting to become its own ecosystem. He threw out all of it, then checked the cabinets, looking for human medicine. None of the actual medicine would do him any good, but he found a bottle of rubbing alcohol, another of hydrogen peroxide. It wouldn’t be pleasant, but in his condition Castiel would need to clean the wounds before closing them.
"Yes. They've done so before. It's rare, but sometimes it does happen. I never understood why until now."
The cashier looked at him oddly when he dumped everything on her counter, but she rang everything up and he paid. From there he crossed the street to the dollar store, where he acquired a few more bags of foodstuffs. He ended up having to make two trips, dumping everything at the cabin and going back out again. This time he went to the gas station, his new target fluids. A pack of water bottles, and two large glass bottles of alcohol. Whisky, since while he was partial to vodka, Sam’s stories had always mentioned that instead. These were also to shut the Demon up about whatever pain he was in, and possibly for Castiel himself depending on how things went.
Dean was starting to regret that particular lie as he and Benny worked on the engine of a Jeep Wrangler, trying to figure out which of the completely neglected parts were the real problem.
“I’m not there to surf, Dean.” Sam hesitated, one hand lingering on his brother’s shoulder. “Who’s this?”
“Because with you looking like that, with your tats covered up, I can almost believe you’re a different person. It’s hot. Now get your hot ass down here.” He shifted himself sideways on the couch, throwing his good right leg over the cushions, keeping his booted left leg over the edge as he reached up to fist a hand in the Alpha’s trench coat. He gave it a firm yank, pulling his mate down over him. Castiel fumbled, bracing a hand on the couch’s back to keep himself from falling over the Omega.
“No, but I thought you might. And it really will help.” Sam opened the grease-stained bag, pulling out a still-warm burrito and pressing it into Dean’s free hand. “Here. I’ll put on some coffee. Did you sleep at all last night?”
Castiel barely heard the hiss before he heard the crack, a sharp stinging pain shooting over his shoulder. It wouldn’t do any damage, not to a dragon, but it would still hurt.
That wasn’t to say all the weirdness was of the negative variety. His luck with red lights improved considerably, though after three days he did start to wonder if anyone besides him seemed to notice he never had to stop at a single one anymore. Whenever he got a bruise or papercut it always mysteriously vanished within seconds. As he got better control of his wings, he could make them do things without them becoming visible, be it holding still or spreading over his head to act as a sort of sunshade. Flying wasn’t something he was prepared to try yet, not that he was sure where he’d do it. His friends and family knew about them, but otherwise everyone else was blissfully ignorant of his recent changes. For now, that just seemed easier.
“That was perfect,” Dean promised, stepping over to put an arm around her shoulders. Hanna smiled shyly, still a bit flustered at the idea of being on a YouTube video, reaching up to pat the hand on her arm.
Dean groaned softly, but bent to kiss him rather than try pulling away. “Fine. I’m just glad we got done so fast. You didn’t take enough breaks.”
Hazel took another bite as she turned that over. “You told me the time when Katie Turner stole my toys was because she was jealous. That was her fault. Grownups do the same thing?”
“I’m sorry,” he murmured, thumbs brushing blue and purple skin with a barely-there touch. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”
Castiel was accustomed to tiptoeing around whenever Dean was doing a video unless indicated he could bang around all he wanted. So he was a little taken aback when the paper was handed to him, Dean looking at him expectantly. While he slowly took it, he raised his eyebrows in inquiry.
It was several minutes before Impala seemed to no longer care a dragon was in her personal space, and began rooting around both their pockets for more treats. Dean gave her another apple, muttering about her getting fat, which earned him a soft squeal and a headbutt to his chest.
“When you’re taking your drivers test that’s going to be real important, but this is an emergency so it don’t mean crap.”
Castiel wondered, not for the first time, if Dean realized how clingy a sleeper he was. Sure the Alpha often woke up in this position, but he'd also untangle himself as quickly as possible. If he thought Castiel was still asleep he'd try not to disturb him, for what it was worth. Castiel himself didn't mind, he found it sweet and the additional warmth was always appreciated. The fact that Dean still seemed embarrassed that he did it when people might see only struck him as amusing.
“I don’t think you’d notice a werewolf stalking you until it was too late. So how about I get the vamp, you get the werewolf, sound fair?”
When Bobby had nudged him forward, motioning for him to get the Alpha, Dean had looked at him like he was nuts. But Bobby had insisted, so he’d edged forward. He didn’t have to go far before he had Castiel’s full attention, red-laced eyes locking onto him, his head cocking, the growl dying off sharply.
It took a moment for Castiel to realize what Dean must think, and shook his head. "You don't understand, Dean. When we choose to mate, we leave our communities and build a nest. We lure an Alpha back to it for breeding. Once our heat is completed, we destroy all evidence and return to our communities."
Castiel wasn't on the bed anymore when he climbed back up the stairs. Dean found him drawn up into a ball, back wedged into a corner, their bags packed and waiting on the bed. The Omega lifted red rimmed eyes to stare at him in a silent plea.
With that Anna faced forward again, flicking red hair over her shoulder as she slid the small desk over her lap. Dean scowled at his own paper, tapping his pencil as much as his injured hand would allow. Damn, now he was thinking about it, as loathe as he was to admit it Anna had a point. He’d just been trying to ignore it.
When this didn’t provide him with an answer he liked, Castiel heaved a weary sigh. “Very well. You really shouldn’t drink to excess, it’s not healthy. And it impairs your memory.”
When they parted again the Demon said, “Breathe through your nose, just relax.” The third time he pulled away it was, “You can use your hands, you know.”
The Omega wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist, clinging to his shoulders, panting raggedly between kisses as his mate took him. As much as Castiel loved being dominated, being fucked and used by his Alpha, he equally adored how Dean would make love to him. As if he were the most beautiful, precious thing in the world.
Castiel very much placed blame for the fact that he actually looked squarely on this baffling Demon’s kiss. Not excessively, he had his pride, but subtly, usually when Dean wasn’t looking back. Considering how much he ate the Demon was still in as good a shape as he’d been before, and now that his wounds were reduced to red welts, his torso was quite pleasing to the eye. Maybe the light tone of muscle wouldn’t have been so intriguing, but Castiel hadn’t noticed before that his freckles extended down over his chest. Which was already a very nice chest to begin with.
“We weren’t aware there were lots of bugs that had also come in with the tree,” Castiel sighed. “We didn’t notice for a while. The night before we were supposed to drive to my family, I was getting everything together so we could just grab things and go in the morning. There were insects and spiders all over the presents. I had to rewrap everything. Very unpleasant.”
“Hey, Samandriel.” Dean sank down into a crouch, putting himself at eye level with the tyke. “Nice to meet ya.”
They had filled one buggy up completely, and had reached the isle with pancake mix, when Castiel asked, "Exactly how much do you intend to spend tonight?" He knew how much he spent on groceries for a week, and rarely did he fill up a single cart, never mind three. Or perhaps it would be four, seeing as they weren't halfway through Dean's list yet.
They’d caught up to him, pressing on and getting even closer before Castiel continued his insistents. “Maybe you were lied to. Maybe there is no seam.”
As for what Gabriel had told him…Castiel believed his words. The Archangel might be a trickster, prone to pranks and jokes, but he wouldn’t fib about this. Not to him. Perhaps that would explain Dean’s recent oddities, he was attempting to engage in mating behaviors with an oblivious partner. Even when he’d tried to preen his wings, it hadn’t occurred to Castiel those were his intentions. Particularly after their discussion about such things, Dean teasing him for his lack of sexual inclinations. For all that, they had been spending more time in each other’s company, for better or worse. Dean could be highly frustrating, stubborn, cocky, crude, rude. But he would back off when it was clear he was toeing a line, for all he seemed to enjoy ruffling the Angel’s feathers. He joked, he talked, he listened…Castiel genuinely enjoyed his company. He enjoyed eating his food, talking with him, watching movies and TV with him. It was very domestic, all things considered. More than he’d enjoyed since his first days as a fledgling. Perhaps it was tied to his enjoyment of quiet, but he liked domestic. The simplicity, the lack of conflict beyond the obligatory arguments.
“It was arranged, but we were cordial. We enjoyed each other’s company, we agreed on many things, the process of producing children was pleasant. It was more than most enjoyed.” He’d checked in on her when he’d become an Angel. They hadn’t been soul mates, so they’d had separate heavens, but he’d been happy to find she had found hers. She’d looked happy, with the other woman. He’d guessed, of course, but while things had been more accepting in Egypt, it was a newly Roman province when they’d been alive. Things had been a bit more delicate, and in truth he didn’t think
Castiel did not like that. At all. But he could hardly refuse. It was a reasonable enough request, refusing would send up red flags. He would just have to deal with the fallout with Dean during his next patrol. Likely he wouldn’t be best pleased, if only because it was unusual behavior with no warning. He’d have to dodge a blade this time, not a mere kitchen knife. It would be bacon cheeseburgers to settle the fussy Demon, no doubt. But that would mean burgers, which would be well earned if he would have to spend the next twenty odd hours with Uriel. While he’d heard the Angel was meant to have a sense of humor, one of the best among the heavenly host, he’d never had the pleasure of witnessing it. Why he wasn’t sure, he was only one rank above Uriel, for all Uriel had moved faster. With politics, he’d gotten this far without developing into a Seraph. If it came to raw power and skill, Castiel was sure he would win, but then Uriel had an infuriating habit of never playing fair when he didn’t have to.
“We disagreed on the term ‘splurge’, since mine generally involved us flying somewhere,” Castiel put in. “And I’m sure by now you’re all aware of how Dean feels about planes.”
“I will grant you one mercy, mother,” Castiel stated, pausing to let a roll of thunder die down. “Dying this way will be slow, agonizing. I’m not sure I can tell my younglings I did that to my own parent.”
He’d brought Dean to his home, still nervous if for different reasons. He was fond of it, even though he hadn’t wanted it initially, and hadn’t bothered to make adjustments to his liking. If bees were in Heaven he’d have bee boxes. Instead he’d have to settle for flowers, plants. He liked them. They were simple, pretty things with purpose.
He had made his way into the garage, and was about to hit the button to close the door, when an insignia on a crisp envelope caught his eye. For a moment Castiel stared at it, heart pounding. He opened his mouth to call for Dean, then closed it. A envelope didn’t mean anything, he had no idea what was inside it yet.
Blue eyes turned to study him worriedly as they waited for a red light to turn off campus. He looked worried, but he didn’t push, waiting patiently. Damn it.
Dean looked downright frustrated, which Castiel found baffling. What had set him off so quickly? One hand, the one not covered in pizza grease, raked down his face in an agitated gesture. Then he bit out, “Get me something to drink…
“Why couldn’t you have pissed off fools?” Castiel asked, heaving a sigh before taking a bite of his own sandwich.
It had started ringing when he’d moved in front of it, but as soon as the receiver left the cradle a menacing cackle came from it, followed by, “I know who you are,” and more laughing.
“Let’s find out.” Without further ado, he dipped his hand into the potion, then plastered a splayed handprint on Dean’s torso, over the two stitched wounds. He recited the rest of the spell, then removed his hand.
“Huh? Oh. In a second.” Dean was already sticking his hand into a bowl with one of those mechanical hands attached, which would lower down whenever you did just that. A groan intoned from the bowl as he yanked his hand back out, moving on to an old-fashioned rotary phone. He dialed a few numbers, then lifted the receiver.
It seemed he’d never hear their story after all, unless they met up again down the road after the pain had eased. For all he’d been against it, now he felt remorse Dean’s angel hadn’t made it. The next time he got a drink, alcohol not blood, he’d pour some out for the Crazy Aunt.
Finally, they agreed on something. Not one to waste an opportunity, Benny explained, “See, you’re an intact, living human being stuck in purgatory’s craw. This dimension wants to spit you out. Which is exactly what’s gonna power out escape pod. Now, I’m pretty sure I can squeeze through too because after all, you take away the fangs and the fun, I was born human too.” Turning his attention to the angel, he started to continue, “But- “
He didn’t mention his Plan B had been to, as the humans said, ‘go nuclear’. A technique by which an Angel could tap into their grace and set it off like a bomb. The sigil was simple enough, he’d be able to get it carved into his chest before Abaddon could have stopped him. All he had to do was summon reinforcements before he stabbed it, and the Knight would have gotten a massive explosion of raw grace that would have slowed even her down. From what he understood, taking a hit like that at close quarters would wound her enough his squadron could easily finish her, assuming she survived. The only downside of this plan would have been that, in going nuclear, the Angel would essentially become a suicide bomber. Castiel had never thought highly of those who did it when the circumstances weren’t dire, but in that moment, knowing it would weaken her enough for his squadron not to take losses in finishing what he’d started, knowing the chances were too great Abaddon could find and slay a weakened Dean…it had seemed a worthy price. He wasn’t entirely sure why, but it had.
