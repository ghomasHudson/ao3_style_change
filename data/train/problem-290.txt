"I'm certain you could handle it the other way," John said.  He wondered, vaguely, if that was too raunchy for Sherlock's taste, but it was probably a bad idea to get gentlemanly now, it would just make Sherlock annoyed.  He flopped over onto his back, head on the pillow.
He stepped into the sitting room.  Sherlock was sitting on the couch, holding a lime ice lolly in one hand and his phone in the other, mouth still painted that lustrous red.  Without ever taking his eyes from the phone or slowing down the movement of his thumb, he slid the lolly into his mouth, so deep it must have practically been going down his throat, and then pulled it out, extending his tongue and swirling it around the frozen tip as he went.
Had any luck since then?
He texted Bill back.
“Milk, no sugar.”
"Oi," he said, when he got there.  The gray-haired man had just left, but the woman had stayed.  "Stop ripping the scab off before it can form.  Here, sit."  He pushed him down onto the hood of the car they were standing near.  "Keep your hands out of the way and I'll clean it for you.  Wouldn't want your idiot head getting scars on it."
not to have to worry about his leg every damn moment--the pain had been a constant presence since he'd been shot, and he was going to enjoy its absence while it lasted.  Come to think of it, where was his cane?  He hadn't tripped over it yet.  He'd need to find it; couldn't guarantee that his leg would still work as well tomorrow morning.  The bathroom was empty, so he locked the door and pulled off his robe.
: You're a doctor.
"John!" Mrs. Hudson said, and at least
He picked it up, and forced himself through an uncomfortable and vaguely confusing conversation with a headless torso who couldn't spell.  He apparently wanted to know John's favorite songs as a way of deciding whether he was interested.  John hadn't bought a CD since med school, and apparently the headless torso did not have a fondness for Peter Gabriel, because he was ditched in about five chat lines.  John locked his phone again, and set it down.
"So, normal, then," John said, remembering the Sherlock-has-a-theory-of-pasta incident which had resulted in them being kicked out of the Tesco.
John stared at his phone, and wished he could answer.
“Well, that’s something,” Mary said, holding out her arms as he came over to hug her.
"Yeah?" John said.
"Fuck off, then."  He pulled the second pillow over his head to make clear his intentions.
have a secret life as a burlesque performer.  He was remarkably good at doing his face.  "It's an experiment.  Been on since last Thursday.  Came home yesterday to find him trying to determine the difference in lipstick wear from eating with a fork and eating with a spoon."  At least that had resulted in Sherlock eating (although it had also resulted in John needing to go get more food, since Sherlock had demolished the contents of the fridge).
“I’d love to,” he said, and meant it.
, John thought, and then mentally kicked himself about a million times.
, Sherlock, I have
: I can be.
Three hours ago, John might have freaked out at this, but the time spent in Sherlock's company had prepared him for a certain level of oddity.  He crawled in between Sherlock's spread legs and took over the unbuttoning.  "It's a bit early for that."
He sat down on the toilet for a moment.  Or maybe…was it possible that his 'date' last night had taken offense to something he'd said?  Had he been
Except, when he fought through those feelings, he also realized that he felt…well, bored by everyone.  Nobody had held
"Duly noted," Sherlock said, and kept typing.
"Looked miserable under the helmet, though."
Except that now, John was seeing those hands, the ones that had cradled the violin; he was seeing them cupping a cigarette close, reaching out to grab his arm.  With the visual clue of the photo, he could half-reconstruct a picture of the man behind the screen name, something about an endless neck and a pair of sharp eyes.  No, it had gone well.  So why couldn't he remember a thing?
John coughed into his pint.
The man's eyes kept darting all over John's face, his shoulders, his hands.  "You woke up bruised and sore, knowing you'd gone out with a stranger the night before, and yet when asked to do the same thing again, you chose to do it without asking questions.  Why?"
Heading out to meet someone from that app.  Meeting at Barbican tube.  Expect you to send search party for my corpse if I don't reply by morning.
John turned to George and smiled.  “Welcome to the madness.”
LOL good luck mate.  Maybe in the morning you'll still be at it.
: Wait, seriously?  You really guessed that from the info in my profile?
: I'm not surprised often.
She glanced up at him warily.  "I said, it's not that you're a man.  This is London.  I've seen stranger things than a bloke wearing lipstick before breakfast, and that's not counting days I see
"Oh, I don't like him," Mrs. Hudson was saying, shaking her head at the TV.  "Look at his hair."  She tapped the ash from her cigarette into the crystal ashtray on the coffee table.
"It's not that you're a man," Sally muttered, from her position on the other side of the crime scene, taking notes on the placement of a series of broken planters.
"You could be putting the tiniest bit of effort into seduction here," John said as he pulled off his shirt.
: Yeah, fine, thanks.
It was a good question, one that John had been wrestling with all day, but somehow now he knew the answer.  "Because it was fantastic," he said.  The man looked completely confused by this, so John tried to explain.  "I mean, I didn't--I didn't remember the details, but I just woke up knowing that something wonderful had happened.  And then I read our chat last night, and--and of course I wanted to see you again.  Not just to find out the details of last night, although now I definitely want to know what happened, but--"  He shook his head.  "Of course I wanted to see you again."
," before bracing himself on the hand not busy in his pyjamas and lowering his head to take in as much as he could of John's cock.
before breakfast."  She shook her head.  "Never mind.  Rant away.  Get it out of your system."
She leaned into him for a moment, and then sat up.  “She’s at UCH.  I need to—I don’t know, I need to go.”
Like I said, long story.
John considered not doing either for a minute, but he'd already drunk the whole press of coffee he'd made when he got up (at a
"Guess," John said, and kissed him.
There was absolutely no reason John should find that arousing, so he was going to assume the spike in lust that ran up his spine was due to Sherlock's thumb pushing into the fly of his pants, and only that.  "Can I please take my clothes off?  Because I don't particularly want to have to take the tube home with evidence all over me."
as proof that this mad and brilliant thing was actually happening.  After only a minute, Sherlock's eyes slipped closed and John realized that he was sliding one of his hands down his own body.  He could feel the moment when Sherlock took himself in hand, and he groaned at the realization.  "That good?"
"I'm fairly certain that I experimented on you, there," John said.  "Besides.  Intentions."
“Nah, it’s fine,” she said, running her fingers through his hair.  “I saw him this morning for a little, while you were at your brother’s.  Anyway, my family makes a big deal of Orthodox Christmas, so I get him for that.”  She sighed.  “Be harder without Mum.”  He kissed her shoulder where he lay, and she curled in closer.
"So…so I was backup.  That's all you wanted, when you invited me out."
at dealing with those doesn't mean you get to
“They’ve seen worse,” he said, phone in one hand calling the car, the other tight on her back.  “Come on, you’ll want your coat.”
before he even thought about it.  He made himself go back and change it.
He was spared the choice of how to wake her when her phone went off.  She stirred.  “What’s that?”
Got a new flat.  Address 221B Baker Street.  Same phone though, obviously.
The way she examined him meant she understood what he was trying to figure out, but her tone was still light when she responded.  “Yeah, he’s a great dad.  Kind of a shit husband, but.  We’re better off as friends.  And I’d rather have that than the opposite.”
"To keep the experiment to affection ratio balanced.  If it goes off course, I'm liable to kick you out of bed."  He reached for the waist of his pajama bottoms and pushed them down, keeping his pants on out of some bizarre sense of propriety.  In principle, he felt there should be some sort of transition between a lead-in snog and actual genital contact.
"And of course I have done, I am perfectly capable of playing a role when req--"  Sherlock stopped talking.  "Wait.  What did you say?"
There was a bruise on his forehead, of indiscriminate size and shape, dark and pronounced.  And the marks on his chest were not at all indiscriminate; they were very clearly fist-shaped, three blows.  He looked down at his hands.  Yes, his knuckles were more than a little bruised, though they didn't hurt to flex.  He leaned into the mirror and examined his body more closely.  The bruising wasn't serious; whoever he'd been fighting with had been strong, but the fight hadn't been prolonged.  Christ, had he gotten into a pub fight?  He wanted to say it wasn't something he would do, but it's possible that, if he'd got riled up, something might have tipped him into a fight.
“Hardly conducive to clients visiting.” John concluded, “They’d get picked up in a raid.”
John did not reply.
“John, please.” John asked her, “I suppose we’d better discuss hours and salary.”
Greg ran his hands through his hair and studied John for a long second.
John wished he could bring Victor back from the dead just to kill him once more, and this time, slowly and painfully. Sherlock was hyper-aware of medications, really anything that would alter her perceptions. John had accepted it as her usual modus operandi. After all, if she had determined that she was in possession of the perfectly ordered mind that saw everything and lost nothing, why would she want to alter it with chemicals synthesized by some robot or some pleb in an industrial lab? Now, however, John questioned her motivations.
John put away his phone. He was certain of what the incoming text said when it buzzed in his pocket. He waved at the CCTV camera, and went on his way.
“I’ll give you my kids if you get clucky, how’s that? They’d fix you right up.”  Mike offered as they headed to the lab.
The man in the jacket advanced upon them before John could offer an apology. Lucy took charge of the situation, knowing that loads of people were staring. “Sorry about that.”
Lucy knew how things were. She knew. She and Molly, whom she’d met at John’s sham, fake wedding with that criminal, talked about it. She knew. How could she not have known, after even that sham wedding was little more than a ode to their love? She knew that her cousin was deeply in love with that madman even when she’d gotten that stupid wedding invitation, and Molly said they were all grins and smiles now.
Sherlock burned with that parting shot, that suggestion that she had hurt John.
“Of course not!” Sherlock interjected, her voice plainly displaying what she thought of that statement, “MacPherson doesn’t need to be stuffed under some restaurant table after the taxation of his hydrotherapy. I’ll take him, and you two can go and eat subpar food.”
“Mrs. H...” John looked over at Sherlock. Organizing her Mind Palace, no doubt building a doghouse out back for MacPherson.
She was not depressed. She was terrified. John was on the verge of suicide, and he was hiding it behind stoicism and a carefully crafted mask. Not another soul in this hospital saw it, not even the physiologist who thought he had John’s care well in hand. He had been hiding for months, and now, today, his plans had the capacity to come to fruition. She did not know how, but she could read it in the lines of his body. It terrified her.
Sherlock came back into the room, having fetched something from the toy bin in her room. “Here, MacPherson, this will provide you with mental stimulation and emotional comfort.” Sherlock placed the squeaking elk on the sofa on the inside. She leaned over John to place it, and John gamely kept his gaze who was wholly unappreciative of the glimpse of pale flesh above them. “It is an alces alces. They have been extinct here since the bronze age. However, they are commonly understood to be a symbol of Canada and there are called moose.”
John absolved him, “It’s nice to see you.”  He didn’t know exactly how to express how he was doing, so he simply said, “I’m okay, Vernet. Every day’s an adventure, or so they say. Nothing much happens to me.”
“You do realize,” John pointed out, having a sister of his own and coming to see what this was with a sort of shocked clarity, “That your sister and I, that we, have only met once. Don’t you think you’re being absurd here?”
Sherlock read obsessively on her phone for good portions of the drive. He figured she was studying up on something relevant to a case, though of course Sherlock Holmes never studied. She researched. The distinction was large, and woe unto him should he forget it.
Instead, he spoke anew, his voice soft. The boxes of notes found in Victor’s flat had become central in his plot to seek his revenge, though he had not made good on his plan to murder either of them. “Sherlock, I need to know.”
John couldn’t remember a time in recent memory that a person had done something just for him, not because he was Elspeth’s son, and he could hear people talking now, even years later. P
John heard Sherlock’s phone buzz. Even though she was in the middle of a case, and badgering Molly, she glanced at it. She rolled her eyes, and went back to poor Molly without missing a beat. The phone rang this time.
“Sherlock…” John winced, hoping against reality that the poor woman cleaning the walls and floors and windows of Sherlock’s bare room had not heard them despite Sherlock’s raised voice at salient moments, “It isn’t fair to call someone an imbecile because you’re…” John fumbled for a word that wouldn’t incite ire, “…massively keen.”
A woman, young looking, tall and painfully thin, appeared from an alcove. She held a lit cigarette in her pale fingers, and she blew out smoke, “Then again, perhaps...” She shook her head, and snuffed out her cigarette on a saucer she’d clearly taken from the party. She barely looked old enough to smoke.
John, Sherlock, and a sleepy MacPherson spent the night discussing what they had found, for there was no need to manufacture a case, only to wait. Trevor was shady and slimy, and Mrs. Scott had disappeared. Her Facebook said she had gone on holiday to Australia, but it didn’t take Sherlock’s skills in linguistics to note that she hadn’t written those posts.
John saw no reason to waste time beating around the bush, “Do you want him in your life?”
John paused, and let his pen still over the paperwork requiring his signature, “I’m sorry, Sarah.”
Happy Holidays! This will be posted while I'm on Christmas break, so between now and early January. Expect an update within a day or two.
Greg retorted, “Why would you bring me out in this, John?”
“It’s over, Greg, and we’re all okay.” John told Greg what he knew Sherlock had intended him to impart when she’d insisted upon this topic of discussion. He knew that she had asked him to talk about this with Greg for the simple reason that he would, and could, help Greg lay some demons to rest, “You’re not back there.”
Weeks passed as spring became summer and summer reached its peak.
John strode quickly through the crowds, and found Sherlock and MacPherson making their way quickly. He fell into step beside her, “Look, that wasn’t okay.”
Twenty.
John said nothing beyond assuring MacPherson that he was home, and raised his eyebrows in silent question.
After all, her name was Wilhelmina Sherlock Sarah Holmes. The only thing she had lied about was her surname. She knew enough of protocol to know that she was pushing it, even showing up here under the guise of John's wife. She cared not one bit for protocol. She would see John.
“Pfft.”  The Holmes patriarch countered, “Mycroft may have access to the CCTV. However, I know my little girl. It’s a shade early for this, but has built you up in that big brain of hers since she found that damn file five years ago. Fifteen year old girls, especially brilliant and misunderstood ones, who dance to music no one else may hear will do that. I will not have my Sherly broken up no matter what Mummy says on the matter.”
Sherlock continued speaking, “The date was October 14th. I had received a report earlier that day, about a mission John had led, information I had been awaiting for some weeks.”
Once the boot was loaded, and MacPherson released from his safe spot that had become his own when he had placed himself in the boot upon his first SUV ride, as though he was either curious or meant to ride there, which of course led them to assuring MacPherson in the most sensible way possible that he was to ride in his seat. From the look that day on Sherlock’s face, John had again determined that he would be hunting down his previous owners, and they would be having a nice little chat involving his Browning.
Lucy had just grabbed a bottle of Tesco apple juice made out of water and corn syrup, and taken a swig, when she spotted an open space by the window. Making a beeline for the cell reception the window offered, Lucy bolted almost as fast as her New Look flats could carry her, but not as fast as a run, which would have called undue attention to her need to check her email.
John forced himself to breathe. He forced himself to look at this place through Sherlock’s eyes. She could be cold, dispassionate. He needed to feeling nothing. John looked to Sherlock quickly as Nan chatted and led them through the house to the rambling kitchen at the back that Gramps had long-ago expanded with a bucket of nails and his own two hands.
The face Sherlock made at that seemed vaguely displeased, and John would have backed off except that it was coupled with the hand on his arse pulling him closer.  "I don't think there are sheets on the spare bed.  And mine is--well, the less said, the better.  Will the couch do?"
: A little bit worse for wear this morning, though.
John put water into the kettle and rubbed a hand over his face.  OK, he felt like shit, that part was clear.  But he also…there was something.  He felt like grinning at absolutely nothing, like whatever had happened last night was the best thing that had ever happened in his life.  So why couldn't he remember it?
“Oh, bollocks to that,” she said.  “Let’s just eat more cheese.”
Sherlock was taking notes in his notebook.  "I'll have to run this a few times, then.  When you're out today, pick up a package of straws."
: That good?
Well, there must have been, he rationalized.  Because he'd definitely gone out with someone last night.  So he took a deep breath, turned on his phone, and loaded Grindr.  Let's see what he'd said.
"Not yet," Sherlock said, and his breath vibrated against the damp material he was hovering over.  "It wouldn't do to have worn it all off before the main event."  And he curled out his tongue, slowly and sinuously, to run it along the visible ridge of John's frenulum.
Someone pinged him, but he left the program rather than reply.  He didn't want to talk to anyone if it wasn't therosinlessbow right now.  And that was stupid, because he honestly didn't know how it had gone last night; he'd come home aching and sore and covered in bruises, so maybe he'd turned out to be an awful human being.  Maybe he'd been boring, maybe he'd been a cyberstalker, maybe he'd been ugly or smelled bad.
John typed
The whole thing was Bill's fault.  He had texted John one day when he'd been limping back from physio:
It would be overstating the case to say that John Watson woke up.  More like, he attained consciousness, slowly, coming very gradually to an awareness of how much his head hurt.  Christ, what had he been drinking last night?  He managed to lift up a hand and press it to his eyes.  This didn't even feel like a hangover; it felt like he'd been hit over the head with a lead pipe.  Urgh.  He gradually peeled his eyes open. Slowly, he pushed himself up--all his muscles hurt, he must not have hydrated well when he got home--and shook his aching head to try to clear it.
No.  Wait.  His eyes refocused on a tall man staring at his phone.  Thin and pale-skinned, yes, and that neck--John remembered that neck.  Since the man wasn't looking up, John took a moment to study him.  Sharp cheekbones, wild hair, eyes that flashed as he scrolled through his phone.  Lovely hands, long-fingered, strong palms.  John could come up with a long list of inappropriate things he might like to do with those hands.  He was odd-looking, but lovely at the same time.  For a moment, he let doubt push against him--what in the world could he possibly see in John?  But he'd messaged him, both times; he'd said John had surprised him like it was the best thing in the world.  So John squared his shoulders and walked up to the beautiful man on his phone.
Lestrade made a muted choking noise.
"I have no communicable diseases, I assure you," Sherlock said, and took the initial starting photograph of his lips.  John knew he should head to his room to get changed out of his work clothes, should find some chores to do, should just go
Sherlock hadn't yet acknowledged him, and continued to smoke aristocratically.  His cheeks hollowed when he pulled on the cigarette, and his lips developed fine creases that highlighted how tightly pinched he held them.  He removed the cigarette, dropped it, still smoldering, in the ashtray, exhaled a fine cloud of smoke, and picked up his phone, which was lying next to it.  With utter calm, he photographed his lips.  Then the turned the phone around and began examining the photo.  "Hmm," he said.  "The creases are shallower than in the straw experiment, but are more visible because of the irregular suction.  Interesting."  He made a note in the notebook, which was next to where his phone had been.
"Ah," Sherlock said.  "Um.  Me too.  Definitely."
John shrugged.  "Christmas shopping."
John groaned.  "Can't you go and order your own drink lids?  I do have a life that involves more than being your errand boy."
He grasped her by the wrist this time, and started striding away.  "I require your expertise.  Lestrade, count the broken flowerpots, and then check the pockets of the victim, you'll find a note there.  Back in fifteen."  He held up the crime scene tape, pulled Sally under it, and let it snap down behind them.
The two men came to stand in the doorway, John in a garish Christmas jumper and Not-John apparently conceding the season enough to wear a forest green shirt.  “Honestly, Sherlock,” said John, leaning into the other man.  “There is such a thing as moderation.”
His phone rang in his pocket, and he fumbled for it.  “Hello?”
John examined his lips more frankly than he'd ever done to anyone he wasn't trying to convince to kiss him.  (Which he wasn't.)  "How'd you get it all off?  I thought that color would stick or something."
"What, when I've had my kidneys eaten by a serial killer?"  John takes his phone back and stares dubiously at the little green icon downloading.
“Up here,” he called, thanking everything he could think of that he was about to be rescued.
cucumbers (English or Persian) (Japanese acceptable)
Sherlock's mouth hung open a little, as if words wanted to escape but couldn't find their way.  "John," he said again, and there was a longing in his voice that he didn't usually let out.
Sherlock sat up, and for a moment John's chest hurt at the idea of being left alone here.  He knew Sherlock was just like this, that it didn't mean he didn't care (he'd said as much, actually used real words to explain, he had to take that seriously), but God, he didn't want to be alone right now.  But Sherlock wasn't leaving; he was unknotting the belt of his robe, sliding out of it and his damp pajama bottoms, cleaning himself up along the way.  John tried very hard not to stare.  Sherlock returned to a prone position, and--and curled up on John's chest, kicking for the blankets until he could get them properly up around them.  John slid his arms around Sherlock's narrow chest and let himself smile.  "Anyway," Sherlock said.  "Readers would be distracted by the prurient elements of the experiment if there were visual data.  I honestly had no idea how often things done with the mouth can be turned sexually suggestive until I began this.  Your reactions are
: It's nice to know if I've missed something.
: Your cane.  You left it in the alleyway.
: Did you just correct my grammar?
"I just…"  He tried to find a way to express it.  "There's just not much for me here, you know?  My sister's a mess, and it's not like we were ever close.  My school friends are all settled into practice, or married, or both.  All my army friends are still in theatre.  Present company excepted."  Bill tipped his pint at him for that.  "I don't have a job.  I don't have a social life.  If I died in my sleep nobody would know until I started to smell."
“They’ll be delivered, John.” Violet assured him, “In the meantime…” Violet glanced over at the logbook, and seemed to take away something from it that John could not, “I find myself wanting assurance that you are committed to this venture. It may be a bit intense for you.”
John swore a blue streak as a case went skittering down the stairs. MacPherson jolted, and dashed to Sherlock’s side from where he had been sniffing at the base of the stairs, quite interested in John’s comings and goings. He was not quite so interested in allowing a suitcase to hit him. He put one of his great paws onto her lap, and she proceeded to hold his hand, a gesture their dog found comforting.
April led him through security and through the winding corridors. She attempted to make small talk, not knowing that the silence suited John just as well. “Captain, we certainly welcome you to New York…”
In silent accord, they began making their way towards the storage areas. It was likely, according to Sherlock, that MacPherson would not be moved to a boat until well into the night. The sun was fading, but the docks were still a busy hive of people. No one would want to risk being seen with an animal. Too many questions were liable to be asked.
After his quick breakfast, John set about getting a handle on things once more. He greeted Carter, the boy who came round in the morning and afternoons to help Nan, and put to the various chores that had defined his growing up years.
John to remind himself that Buckingham was not a war zone. Even if it felt like one.
John’s heart was in his throat, his footsteps sure, as he saw a light emerge from the darkness. He moved closer, calling out. Sherlock didn’t answer, but it was her. She was there. There she was, then, in the back of damp drainage pipe just behind where two smaller pipes joined, almost dry in comparison to his waterlogged pathway.
Just then, an email flashed across John’s screen. Mr. Macon had been identified. His name was Michael Westin. He was involved in the import and export of animals to the US. He didn’t, however, specialize in helping Fido hop the pond with papers to avoid quarantine. No, he focused on the slightly illegal, the exotic, and the downright endangered. Why, then, was MacPherson of interest to him? Even with clients that had the stones to demand $5.5USD and steal their dog besides, something did not wash.
“George Jeffords.  The same, obviously,” he said, and shook.
The water came to a boil.  He pushed down his confusion, poured the water over his tea bag.  All right.  So, probably not roofied.  Just sore.  And then…well, there was no point being subtle in his own head; he was pretty sure he hadn't been fucked last night, because it had been a while and he'd be feeling it.  The sore thigh muscles, they might suggest that he'd topped, but nothing unequivocal.  He'd woken up in his pants with his clothes in a pile next to the bed, so he hadn't showered, at least not at home.  He didn't smell like come, but he did smell like sweat, like he'd gotten a workout.  So if he'd gotten laid, he'd cleaned up well, but he hadn't taken a shower.
"It's just a penicillium," Sherlock said.  "As long as you don't feel ill, you probably didn't ingest enough to be toxic.  Don't throw it out, I'm measuring it."
John actually stared at him in open-mouthed shock for a moment.  "That is," he said, "literally the worst pick-up line in the history of sex.  Seriously, Sherlock, have you
Sherlock seemed to be coming back to his senses.  Frankly, John was impressed he'd gotten him away from them at all.  "So.  I was right."
John had actually liked the helmet hair.  He decided not to dignify this, or the fact that his self-closeting had apparently been an epic failure, with any kind of response.
: I was unsure whether its absence would occur to you.
She shook for a moment, and then sat up.  “My mum had a stroke.  They couldn’t get through, my sister called John.”
Sherlock cleared his throat.  "John," he said, and the tentativeness was back.  "If I am understanding the situation properly, you are not opposed to my gathering experimental data in this circumstance, provided that my reasons for desiring to collect that data are specific to you, and not merely a function of your proximity.  Is that it?"
It couldn't just be that he'd gotten laid last night.  Whatever had happened must have been
standard for the site, but he was glad, because
He felt bloody fantastic.
"Sometimes.  Maybe you want to make them a little darker or pinker or whatever."  She shoved him away a bit.  "Did you delete personal space?"

, the sticker on the bottom of the tube read.  He shook himself to get the image out of his head, and went to pour himself a cup of tea.
about it at the end?
"No, but--"
interest, not long enough for him to flirt harder, push back.  If he felt old, uncool, or ugly, he also felt like everyone he interacted with was shallow and vapid.  Did he go the wrong places?  Attract the wrong people?  Was there a more interesting set of potential dates out there, and he was somehow turning them off?
: Are you up for another round tonight?
ice lollies
: Seriously?  You're just--you're asking me?
He came back to himself to find Sherlock scrutinizing his face.  He rolled his eyes, hoping that Sherlock hadn't read anything too incriminating in his little moment, and went to pour his own cup.  "It's not like there's a rule or anything.  At least as far as I know."
He paused.  No weakness in his extremities.  He'd gotten up and walked out of bed and to the kitchenette without his cane.  He hadn't even
The man surveyed John's body critically as he pocketed his phone.  "Excellent thinking, picking a different jacket.  It's no more flattering than the other one, but between that and the cane, we shouldn't be immediately recognized.  Nevertheless, I've employed several other individuals to let us know if he's spotted outside of our observational zone.  So, shall we?"
: I assume you got home safely last night.
Sherlock was lying on the couch wearing a sheet and that bloody lipstick when he clomped up the stairs.  "So, are we poisoning these or something?" he said, dropping the tray on the table.
hour), so he'd end up drinking the tea too.  He dug around in the drawers while the kettle began to rattle, pushing past a series of glass rods for stirring things in graduated cylinders, a turkey baster, a full set of piping tips (he'd lay twenty quid Sherlock didn't even know what piping tips were
The tension in her shoulders disappeared and she sank back into her chair.  “Right? Saves so much bullshit.  And, again, we don’t hate each other, so.”  She glanced at her phone for the time.  “8:30.  My turn to get the bill, yeah?  And then you can help me pick out what two dozen year threes will eat tomorrow.”
So now he was prancing around the crime scene, holding up his magnifier at the scuff marks on the lamppost and twirling around the stop sign in a way that would have been balletic if he hadn't kept his spine at an awkward angle to his pelvis the whole time.
It was old, certainly, but the spidery handwriting on the cover confirmed what he had known from the moment he’d watched her cradle the book. The book her in her hand was not chemistry work. It was her file on him.
Sherlock looked his way, the rushing water almost drowning out her words. “You want a dog. He’s interesting.”
Smiling tightly at Father Holmes, who had been endeavoring to discuss some sort of painting he was doing with John as the elderly man shared MacPherson’s attentions with his wife, Jon rose. MacPherson did not follow him as he moved closer to the corridor, and the closed door. The dog, ever a ham, soaked up the affection as his due, his massive tail thumping against the patterned rug with glee.
John knew there was only one thing to do when he got to the photos of people coming up to Sherlock, largely because she likely refused to go around to the various round tables in the blue carpeted chandelier-ed room. Sally had been there, and so had Harry, looking sober and happy for once. His cousin Lucy had sent a gift. A swirl of Holmes relations filled the rest of the room, along with several young women that he supposed Sherlock found tolerable enough.
John patted MacPherson, and trudged off to work. He’d barely made it down the stairs when his phone began to blow up. There were countless tags, pings, and notifications on his phone. John steeled himself and opened up the news apps.
John watched as an man in his late fifties approached them. He was a sparse man, one born to the saddle, with close-cropped greying hair and a confident, quiet, air. “I suppose now he’s met the horses, you might introduce us, Sherlock.”
“Could you spare a solider a bag or two?” Sherlock hated playing on people’s sentimental dehumanization of their armed forces, but for John she would stop at nothing to ease the pace of his thoughts and isolation.
Carter considered this for a long moment. “You should call it ‘The Case of Cluck’ or ‘The Clucking Case.’”
“I’ve got your order here, sir.” She set the tray down on the vacant table next to him and unloaded a plate of lemon biscuits and a huge pot of tea.
Sherlock snapped, already striding away from the ballroom towards the lift that would take her to her room to collect her passport from the safe. “I will go to Cannes. Have Mycroft send a plane. I will—”
“I wouldn’t want you to apologize for being the person you are, Sarah.” John assured her, knowing now that any hope of a relationship was dead in the water and had been since the night they’d found MacPherson. John did not resent him or Sherlock for this truth, he was only sorry it had taken them both so long to see it and admit it. “You’re a wonderful friend.”
Instantly, there was a reply.
John snored. He could imagine a young Sherlock arguing with the rector over things like the impossibility of Genesis, and the Lord’s Supper. “Deleted your confirmation classes, have you?”
Within three days, they were digging into a confirmed murder case. It came together quickly. John was dizzied by it all. Gloria Scott had discovered Victor Trevor’s gambling ring, his embezzlement, and the fact that this hard to find James Armitage was in on his schemes. Gloria Scott’s ticket to Australia had never been used, and her body had been found in a skip. John knew this, presently, because he was staring at her remains with a grim look on his face. “Point blank to the back of the head.”
MacPherson gave a short, sharp, bark. John by now knew what that meant. Not only did Sherlock summon him, she’d also taught the dog to do it. She said it made MacPherson feel objectively useful, but John knew better. Asking the dog to summon the blogger saved Sherlock the trouble of having to stop making deductions.
There, sitting at the table, MacPherson underneath it, John took a moment to study Sherlock. Something wasn’t right. He felt it.  The increasing threat against MacPherson was no doubt wearing on her. They, however, had no reason to believe that this threat was anything more than the general issues that came with the territory of their lives.
Within moments, Lestrade appeared at the skip in the bowels of London, and arched a silver eyebrow. He was wearing a worn jumper, jeans, and a tired expression.  “I suppose you’ll tell me why you’ve discovered a body at two in the morning.”
John turned and gave a slight nod to the people in Speedy’s. Sherlock’s nimble fingers danced over the keys, as she responded to the fuss with a single factoid about the amount of injuries and casualties on British roads. John retweeted it, and watched as the internet speculation grew. That done, they were of one accord as John shut the boot with a grateful exhalation and Sherlock released a happy MacPherson, who was carrying a ratty tennis ball in his great mouth.
“Check the stables, John.” Mummy advised, “Sherlock is no doubt either there with the horses or in her lab. I’m afraid we’re all second chair to the animals and experiments. She’s probably forgotten we exist.”
Lestrade spoke into his transmitter, “Send them in.”
After all, when battling addiction, it helped to ask the richest and poorest person one knew. While Sherlock only knew what she had read and deduced of poverty, she had quite a lot of money. Money, that was, that and Father and Mummy refused to let her properly invest, but that was a consideration for another matter. She simply knew a great many people who had gotten sober or clean, and had all contacted this same number.
“Oh, do shut up.” Sherlock retorted, “Your feeble attempts towards manipulating me into self-care are asinine. Appreciated, but entirely asinine.”
Still, John hashed another tally in his head, and the scales balanced a millionth of an increment more, which was some consolation.
The party on the first night of the long weekend was in full swing, and John felt as though his head was spinning. He had been introduced to every relative and family friend he thought the senior Holmes’ possessed. When Mummy released him from trotting him around like a pet poodle in dress uniform, he found Molly fuming as she stared daggers at Sherlock, who was dancing with a tall, suave, man of Molly’s age.
John sighed, looking over the scraggly dog the size of an elephant in the glow of the high-powered lights in the back of the van. His skeletal body looked huge. No wonder Sherlock couldn’t lift him when she’d tried. “He is rather cute.”
He called out softly, “Nothing in the back.”
John let a barrage of feeling wash over him. He wasn’t sure what to do with it all. It had been a long time. Too long. He could see the wash on the line and the chicken house shut up for the night. Emotions rioted within him. He sat at the top of the track until MacPherson barked in anticipation and Sherlock roused. John began to drive before she might ask about his dallying.
Something was not right.
John looked to Mr. McGowan for his opinion, but assessment sparkled in his eyes. John knew in an instant just who had spent much of his time giving Sherlock her introductory lessons in deduction. The older man simply gesture to John to do as he was bid, and so they followed along until they caught up to Sherlock, designer skirt, muddy wellies, and horse on a halter beside her.
John said nothing, sipping his tea, and noted that Sherlock had allowed MacPherson to ramble into the garden just beyond the wide picture window that dominated this sitting room. When she spotted her brother imperiously taking tea with him and Mummy, John pointed with his eyes, and mouthed, “Traitor.”
likely in her office, as she wearing a perfectly tailored Hobbs suit. The scenario played out in John’s mind, right down to the suppressor Victor had used. He’d eschewed the ear protection he’d bitched about on the pheasant hunt because the sound of the bullet breaking the sound barrier and ending life had ben a thrill for him. John knew it was likely orgasmic for Victor.
“Yes…” She encouraged, a sparkle in her eyes, “Wilhelmina?”
John filed that away for later consideration. In turn, he offered up something she neither knew nor had deduced about him over the course of years, “My cadaver in Uni was a lorry driver by the name of Ross White. I kept a notebook of things I learned about him during the term. When I figured out that he had a Nan in care, I went to see her a few times when I was out that way.”
: …How did you know that?
After two hours of sitting in silence, interrupted only by pencil scratching, the turning of pages, the timer beeping, and one trip to back to the bathroom to remove the lipstick and start over again with a new coat, John forced himself to go buy groceries.  He threw in a box of straws, too, but when he got home it seemed Sherlock had moved on to experimenting on every type of drinking vessel in the house.  John stared at the perfect lip-print on the carton of milk, and decided having a row while half-aroused was more trouble than it was worth.
John took the hand.  "John Watson, but you already know that."
“Um, yeah, no worries, I’ll see you when you get here?” George said to Mary, and hung up.  He realized with a crash that this must be the mysterious ex, this must be John, and oh god, he was a wet dog on the stoop and was about to die. “Er, yeah,” he said, not knowing what to say.  “Um, I’m George.  Mary’s…”  Did he say friend?  Boyfriend?  Not partner yet, it was only four months, but still it was neutral and—oh god, he was staring, what the hell should he say.
John sighed.  "It's like having one of those robot-fridges that tells you what's in it.  And you eat just as little.  Wait, the bread's gone off?  I had toast this morning."
She wrinkled her forehead.  "And?"
John took a deep breath.  He must have looked bloody terrible if Bill thought he needed something this badly.  "This is a terrible idea."
He forced himself to stay in the moment, and not get lost thinking excessively about Sherlock's tongue.  "You realize you've just ruled all women ever as outside the class of civilized persons."
"Why?"
, what a bizarre name--said.  "Shall I fill you in, or do you want to guess?"
John squinted at his phone.  There was another thing?  Christ, if it turned out he'd gotten a tattoo or something that he'd missed, he was going to lose his shit a little.
The phone made a noise, and he picked it up, expecting to have to dismiss some vapid chat from another headless torso, but that wasn't it.  Instead, therosinlessbow was messaging him.  Well, that made things easier.
"And yet you're doing it."
He couldn't help but smile at that.  So, yes, it had gone well, he wasn't making it up.
"You're cruel," Sherlock said poutily, and returned his attention to the television.
John sat on the couch with his tea, and picked up the book he was reading.  But he kept glancing up to monitor the experimental procedure, which meant he kept seeing Sherlock curl his lips around the straw, take a long sip of tea, and then pull off to pout for the camera and take another photograph.  He looked terribly bored while he was doing it, but every so often he'd glance over at John while he was sucking, and the hollow of his cheeks, the under-the-lashes glance, above all the red purse of his lips was so bloody hot that John kept having to look back at his book and stare at the page, reading nothing for a few minutes until he stopped envisioning getting that look from a Sherlock kneeling at his feet.
George squinted. “Is that...is that a ferret?”
are you wearing lipstick?"
Sherlock groaned again, which nearly set John off, but then pulled off.  John wasn't disappointed, but Sherlock gasped out, "Fuck my face.  And
Well.  It was the colour, wasn't it.  Just the novelty of it, really.
Sherlock sniffed and curled up on his side against the arm of the sofa, wrapping his arms around his legs.  "If I'd known you were this fussy I'd never have offered you the flat."
Sherlock seemed taken aback by that.  For a long moment, he stared at John's face, and let his brain work it out.  "So this is--it is a question of intentions, for you.  Not a question of--the act itself.  Or the identities of the participants.  Those were all--acceptable."
"Much better."  The timer on Sherlock's phone sounded.  He snapped the laptop shut, and slid it off his lap while sitting up and turning with his back to the windows.  "It has occurred to me that it might be profitable to be able to detail the activities a person has been engaged in by the wear patterns of lipstick.  Possibly other cosmetics as well, but lipstick is the most obvious.  Lots of occasions when it can be affected by common actions.  Slight problem that it's frequently re-applied, but some data is better than none."  He picked up his phone and unlocked it.  "I'm collecting control data today, in order to understand how lipstick ages without any interference.  The actual tests begin tomorrow."  He turned the phone around, pursed his lips, and snapped a quick photo.  He spun his phone to check it, and then threw himself back down on the couch, reaching for his laptop and depositing the phone back on the coffee table.
He sighed as he flipped back to the conversation.  Might as well figure out what they'd said, see if it jogged any memories.
He didn't say what he'd thought about, because you don't do that over pints, but he suspected that Bill could hear it underneath.
He'd probably sent one last night when he'd gone out.  And maybe he and therosinlessbow had exchanged numbers, texted each other or something?  That would be someplace to start.
“Swear jar,” said Naz, John, and Mary simultaneously.
John shook off the lingering embarrassment of how long it had taken him to pick out an outfit as he walked from where he'd gotten off the bus towards the designated corner.  He owned four pairs of trousers and ten shirts, and still he'd spent twenty minutes in front of his closet, and then another ten in front of the mirror trying to get his hair to look respectable--and then he'd remembered therosinlessbow explaining what his hair meant, which lead to a bunch of dreamy staring.  He had thought for a minute about bringing his gun with him--therosinlessbow
this whole bloody thing would get a lot easier.  I mean, what should he open with?
John lifted his pint awkwardly. "It was nice hair."
."  Some part of John realized he was being too truthful, but it was the middle of the night and he was done.  "You can't
John gaped at the message for a moment.  And then he gathered his wits about him, and typed back,
He sat up.  Sherlock was standing next to his bed.  In one hand, he held a paperback novel that John had bought in the train station two weeks ago when they had to go to Manchester for a case.  It was on fire.
“Dr. Watson.” The man took a sip of his own tea. In the space of a moment, his phone buzzed four times, which the man ignored, “I’m prepared to offer you a job.”
John studied Victor. He was far unlike the man John had met in the country. John had known his gentleman of ease persona had been a hard facade to manage, for it had slipped a great deal in moments of stress. He supposed it always shocked him, seeing people without their masks.
Blessedly, the nurse was quiet until he’d finished for now. She took the base and returned in seconds with a bit of supplies, “I can’t give you water yet, but I can at least give you a lemon swab.”
, John thought. Mycroft knew just what he was telling John. Sherlock had come to him, reached out to him.
Sherlock was not particularly interested in athletics or fitness, though of course she was perfectly capable running about London in four inch heels. He’d known it had to come from somewhere, and had pegged for her a horse mad woman from twenty paces off. However, the pictures of her with tennis rackets, hockey sticks, and lacrosse sticks around the house threw him through a loop. When the slowed to a walk, he asked, “So, you did sports at school?”
John called out from where he was washing his hands in the tiny sink in the exam room. “You’re welcome to come on back, if you like.”
“He’s not boring.” Sherlock recoiled from him in time with the first flash of lightening, as though the truth hurt her. “I’ll show him London, and he’ll add to my range of data points.”
Amateurs.
“And reveal my sources?” Nan laughed, patting MacPherson while ignoring his nosy poking for a lick of her cake, “Never.”
MacPherson came flying into the room, his empty bowl between his teeth as he hopped up fluidly on John’s bed. “You have finished your meal within satisfactory parameters, MacPherson.” Sherlock informed him, reaching for the bowl as she patted his craggy head.
Lucy caught up to John, just as she made it to the crime scene. He’d almost ditched her, but Lucy was nothing if not observant and good at following people. The crime scene was close, and the speeding cars were enough of a clue to find the scene once she got off at the same tube stop as John had done. Lucy hung back and watched as he expertly made his way under the tape, nodding at techs, being a generally nice guy and pausing to notice people.
“Why?” John asked, suddenly very aware that this was not a discussion about a horrible jumper. She knew he’d love a horrible jumper.
She had but waited a few moments when a blond head entered her field of vision. Sherlock made notes of everything she saw, everything she noted, about this man. He had tired eyes, and likely a Vitamin B12 deficiency. There was something…something she couldn’t define in the way he gripped his menu card.
Sherlock conceded, her grin lighting up her face as thunder boomed and a flash illuminated the world around them. “Only your very ugly jumpers.”
Actually, they both did.
“Dr. Watson!” A rough voice, though young, grabbed his attention just before he had thrown the person to the ground. “Dr. Watson, you’ve gotta--”
Greg was in attendance at dinner, and though it was a very Holmesian affair, nothing particularly notable happened. Sherlock ate little, MacPherson huddled under the table, Father Holmes offered him too many treats, and Mycroft brushed at his place setting for imaginary dog hair, after which Sherlock began to pontificate on the amount of dander in the air. Greg and John discussed cases, and the blog, and Mummy watched, sharp-eyed, for data.
John didn’t have to wait long. The car pulled to a stop in front of a white building just as the last of his Tim Tam disappeared into his mouth. A discreet doorman popped out of nowhere. John hefted his groceries, felt his gun shift in the band of his jeans as he slid from the seat, and went inside. He knew that the driver wouldn’t be any help. He hadn’t even batted an eyelash when John fiddled with his wrapper and stuffed it in the door handle. It was never a bad idea to leave behind a bit of DNA.
Her face cleared, and she quickly smoothed the whole thing over, mentioning a few people that John did indeed know well enough to claim as connections and even friends. The conversations and conclusion of his duty here moved along and John was led through security by Miss Birch. Soon John was moving through New York back to his accommodations.
But first, maybe, a wedding? Lucy’s been planning this one for ages...
“Bet that goes over well in the Officers Mess.” Sherlock twitched with pain, and his legs began to shake. Blood loss, then. Shit. Internal bleed. Fuck.
“I should tell you that love is a chemical deficit.” Sherlock relaxed in some minute but profound way, “And that you may change your mind when the newness has worn off and you are…more aware. I will not hold such an occurrence against you.”
He stepped back into the lab, his old credentials still far outranking even the ones Sherlock had pilfered from Greg.
“Nan’s lonely.” Harry admitted. Gramps had died while he was in Afghanistan, a sudden stroke no one could have predicted or prevented. He’d wanted to die like that, and John was glad he’d never once suffered in dying as he had watched his daughter suffer, “She’d love to see you going home to the farm.”
She needed to keep up on things. Health literacy and education was important, but God, so was her ability to text. She got a real kick of saying that she wasn’t a doctor, not
“When someone we love enters our lives, John, it can ask us to reflect upon them.” Mrs. Hudson sat down to her own repast, though far lighter than his own plate, “Why, just look at you and Sherlock.”
“I am hiring members of my network, who enjoy smoking, to test the cigarettes. I will record the process.” She replied, as John cleaned his teeth,“It is not as good as first hand data, I’ll have you know.”
John studied Sherlock. She was being carefully to the point and direct. Had she had so much as a sniffle, though, he would have heard about it after the first instance, no matter what he was doing or where he happened to be at the moment. “I’m glad you’ve decided to see to your routine care.”
“I am not infatuated with him.” Sherlock hissed, a blush suffusing her face. Infatuation was based on the superficial, the reflection of self and selfishness in another. Sherlock felt none of those things for John Watson. She had read Molly’s magazines, solely for research.
“His mealtime is not for four point seven hours, John.” Sherlock looked up from the body that she was all but sniffing, “If this is an attempt to feed me, I assure you I require no sustenance. As it stands, we are expected at dinner tonight. You know Father will fuss if we don’t make absolute gluttons of ourselves.”
Satisfied, Sherlock began to pick her way up the embankment. John kept pace beside her as she spoke. “Not Scruffy or Fido. He must have a name with meaning.” Sherlock amended, “But yes, we are agreed. I won’t hear another word about giving him away to some banal couple with jobs in finance.”
“Of course not.” He knew that it had been more, just from her defensive tone. John reached for her messenger bag, and pulled out a biscuit. He bit into one. Lemon. Glorious. “So, debutante, scientist?”
John sipped his tea.
John knew his reply before the offer left Sherlock’s father’s mouth. He thought maybe this was normal for them, but he wouldn’t violate her like this. “No.”
A lilting voice filled his ear. “I thought I’d be hearing from you today.” She added, “Good shot.”
In time, John forgot but the themes  of every interaction he’d had at Landsthul. He remembered that they told him he had a wife, but didn’t remember exacting details. It was common in trauma patients, he knew, to forget the first few days after a major trauma.
Sherlock didn’t drive and they didn’t keep a car. It was absurd to consider buying and maintaining a car in this city, with their lifestyle. Though London was spread out, they did just fine with transit. Well, John used the Tube and busses. Sherlock had an army of cabs and cars at her disposal. She sometimes used the Tube to deduce, but certainly never to get around London, much less anywhere outside of Zone One, let alone where they were headed.
“Are you always this optimistic?” Janet laughed, “Optimistic or deluded, either works. We’re happy to have you, Dr. Watson.”
“Great.” Greg replied, hopping up into the car that had appeared as though summoned. “See you, then.”
“I thought we talked about the smoking, Sherlock.” John pulled out his toothpaste and his razor and set them on the edge of the sink. He took up his toothbrush from the UV case Sherlock insisted cleaned the toothbrushes properly.  “You’re already a walking risk factor for...”
“You buy that horrible cover story about outsourcing?” Sherlock looked at him, aghast, “How can you be so gullible, John? It’s hardly to your credit.”
Sherlock was still intent on warning him, “You have insufficient data to make that determination.”
John stifled laughter as Sherlock snapped, “Of course not! Ask John to teach you how to lie, if you must do it, at least you should do it properly.”
John was buttoning up a clean shirt when there came a knock at the door. He hastened to pull on one of his shoes, but it was too late. He had not made it to his post by the door in time to forestall what he heard. Sherlock was huffing and crossing the flat before the second knock had finished.
“You can count on a splendid reference, John.” Sarah agreed, quickly enough to tell John that she did not want him to back out of this decision, “You are really a good doctor.”
She bet Sherlock has been, too…
Saying close was one of the first commands Sherlock had taught him. It told him that he needed to stay within a 50 foot radius of either him or Sherlock. John was not sure how they had worked out that boundary line, but it worked well enough. The dog got to maintain his autonomy, which Sherlock was loathe to restrict when he was smarter than most humans who had full autonomy on the basis of the accident of being born human, and they avoided any accident lack of supervision might cause.
Oh, great. Now the Granny in the waiting room was glaring. Wonderful. Just fucking wonderful.
John, too, had noted the bustle that came with preparations for Trooping the Colour and the Queen’s official birthday. Tourists were out in droves, though John had consumed his tea and managed to get here without too much hassle. “It’s fine, Laura. Everyone’s probably going to be a bit late, today.”
When he woke up, John found that he had been cleared for transfer and that the second set of scans had revealed no obvious brain damage. He accepted their 'wait and see' for memories that didn't exist and wouldn't resurface. The doctors had spoken to him, but he chose not to dwell on their words. He had a mystery to solve, and that mystery was the only thing keeping him from falling into a pit of pain, despair, and self-loathing.
John hadn’t checked his phone in nearly a day. Sherlock hadn’t gone out, and neither had he, and there had been no real reason to keep it on his person. John stumbled backwards slightly, “It’s really nice of you to drop by to see MacPherson.”
John knew where Greg’s concerns were rooted. He wasn’t exactly known for committing to women. In the time Greg had known him, he’d barely dated, and the stories his mates had told about Three Continents Watson hadn’t exactly painted a flattering picture of John as a partner. What his mates had said in Greg’s hearing hardly assured Greg that anything with Sherlock was more than an aberration.
Sherlock was beside him as she slipped through the door, deductions in her eyes. John moved systematically from the right, Sherlock took the left as Greg moved down the center of the cramped but large space. They worked hurriedly, knowing that Mycroft could only keep the camera system down for a short period of time. They had less than ninety seconds remaining.
John pointed towards the orangey one, “Cornflower.”
Moving through the store, Sherlock sailed right into the personal shopping area, and John knew that she had booked the appointment not for the help, which clearly she did not need, but for the dressing room space. God forbid she be cramped into a badly lit stall with the proles.
John could no sooner have stopped himself from kissing her properly than he could have gotten out of this chair and walked out of Baker Street. Within a moment, Sherlock’s nimble, violinist fingers left his hair to wage war on his shirt buttons. John declared turnabout fair play, and made short work of sending buttons scattering for the second time today, knowing full well that the skittering of Sherlock’s pulse and the rise in the intensity of her rosy blush was a harbinger John rejoiced in noting. Whereas many of their previous encounters had been rooted in joy and happiness, this was fire and gasoline, and an absolute inferno of want and need and passion.
John moved around the stand once he was on terra firma, through the crowd of important people he saw on the magazine stand at Tesco’s. He thought these were probably Waitrose people, not that most of them did their own shopping. John supposed he had a chip on his shoulder about it all. He wasn’t looking to make friends. He sort of hoped he could slink back to his bedsit and forget that this invitation had ever come along.
“Would I be putting you in a tough spot if I finished my shift today and went on my way?” John asked the question, and read the truth in the relief Sarah tried quickly to hide, “I’ve heard of a few openings, and this might be a good thing for everyone involved.”
The idea that she hadn’t lost her heart to him almost instantly made something clench in John’s middle. After months of talking about MacPherson’s wellbeing and keeping her updated when he went to visit him daily, John had assumed that Sarah was similarly invested in the dog and wanted to be a part of his life.
Father Holmes looked a bit harried, “Luncheon will provide opportunities for discourse, gentleman.”
Finishing her water, Sherlock breathed out, and declared, “I manipulated a very pretty woman to dispose of MacPherson’s refuse.”
“I don’t abuse my animals.” Mr. Macon declared, “He’s not mine. I’m the go-between for an influential client who wants their investment back. Await further instructions. I know you prefer to text.”
Such was the case today. Mickey was wearing his bright white trainers, and his designer t-shirt with faded jeans. John thought that Mickey stood a good chance of making something big of himself, and knew him to have a mum he loved devotedly, “Morning Doc. Got a busy day today, yeah?”
John reached out and brought the dog to heel at his side with a gentle grasp of his collar, “Sit, you beggar.” MacPherson lolled his head to the side as Chowley left his basket in the hopes that he would succeed where the larger canine had failed.
John supposed women that performed autopsies together bonded. Sherlock and Molly had a uniquely profound bond that wasn’t traditionally apparent, but was forged of iron.
John resolved to do as she directed, and kissed her soundly, being careful to mind her cracked rib and her bruised side as she pulled him closer, wrapping her uninjured arm around his neck to keep him closer, as if he had any intention of going anywhere.
The nurse rose. “I’ll escort you back myself. He’s going for surgery soon.” Sherlock noted that she did not say that if he survived that one, that there would be several others when he went home. The object of Landstuhl was to stabilize John and ship him off with their good wishes.
John looked up. The car stopped. He decided that if he approached it, his bread wouldn’t squish like it would if he kept tramping about the city. He’d been at a job interview at some posh clinic in Hampstead. They’d taken one look at his cane and his shaking hand and written him off. War was hell on the CV.
Therefore, John strode into the room as though he owned the place, as best he could, and took up a flute. He knew it would shake in his hand and slosh over the top of the glass, but he had no intention of eating, so this was a compromise. He had, therefore, to display an ease he did not feel.
“What can I do?” Carter asked, wan and horrified at the shift in Sherlock, “Anything. Please.”
John was so tired. He just wanted to sleep but his head was pounding and he…something was wrong. Something was not right. John sucked in air, and the voice was again demanding, “Open your eyes, Captain. You’re in the hospital, you’re safe.”
John watched the crowd dissipate. His guide here held up a hand. John did the sensible thing. He waved back curtly. The Lady was safe, and the boy’s mission was complete. The sky looked terribly like rain as electricity clapped in the sky above them.
She wondered if this counted as holding a man’s hand, which she had never done before. It had not mattered, and then when it did, she wanted no placeholder in John’s place in her life. She wondered if this would one day count as a meeting between them, though she knew she would hold these moments deep within her Mind Palace. They were not ones she would easily recount. She wasn’t sure she even remembered how to breathe.
John knew there had to be more to this whole situation. He knew that Victor knew how Sherlock felt, he simply did not give enough value to her emotions and opinions to take them seriously when they contradicted his own. “There are other scientists with whom to correspond.”
John felt compelled to warn her, “I don’t know if you know, but I bring a bit of baggage along with me.”
John was not particularly enthused by his obligation to address this council, but he had the real chance to explain to them what the medical and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan looked like from an Army’s doctor’s perspective. It was not a gift he would squander, not with the knowledge of his patients in his mind. It was intensely driven by both his understanding of facts, but also the implications of those facts.
Realizing that he was talking to a chicken, John decided he needed more coffee. He ate his eggs and toast and drank coffee in solitude. Sherlock had done a bit to set up her lab last night in the dining room, with Nan as an eager assistant. That said, she was huddled under the covers and it was there he intended to leave her.
Indeed, in John’s tremulous hand, he held a list. The handwriting was irrelevant, but the content revealed much, though John was too drugged and damaged to decode the simple groupings of words.
Lucy was so over his shock, “Obviously, it’s a physical possibility.”
And yet, something in John could not envision that future. Instead, he found himself thinking about being here more. He found himself thinking of MacPherson spending his days by the fire with his stuffed moose. He hated himself for it.
“Sarah Watson.” Sherlock blurted, too rattled and too focused to school her voice in a flat American accent that sounded vaguely Northeastern, the nondescript toneless accent that was all over American television.
But here she was, wearing a dress she’d gotten who knows where, bag from Kate Spade, and jacket from Boden. She did appreciate Kate Spade’s ability to accessorize. Stacy and Clinton were much nicer than Trinny and Susannah, too, and almost nothing beat ice cream in Manhattan. She’d about died dancing The Shag in South Carolina.
“You had chores well before you were twelve, dearheart, and your use of chemicals was entirely recreational, as you know we insist upon natural cleansers.” Father Holmes recalled, dabbing at his face with his napkin,“Do go along and get settled in, won’t you? When you’ve unpacked, please feel free to join us in the den.”
“They infantilize you, because that’s what parents do.” John offered, reaching around her to pull the heaviest suitcase to the ground, whereupon he grabbed the handle and lifted it, easily reaching for another. “It also served to get you some time alone, didn’t it?”
“Not as such.” She darted from the loo into her room, and John saw a flash of dark hair and a tatty designer dressing gown, “I’m going to check on my Network.”
They were by the terrace doors, and mindful of Father’s matchmaking ways, John guided them off of the floor onto on the stone terrace. Sherlock took stock of the fairy lights amid the gardens, and fixed a pin that was sliding out of her wild hair.
Sherlock read his thoughts easily, “We’ve a whole flat, John, you do realize.”
They stopped for lunch and to let MacPherson refresh himself when his schedule demanded a stop. They were stared at quite openly in the restaurant. Two teenage girls came up to Sherlock, who dispatched the requested advice in only the way she could do. As usual, her fans were too in awe of her to be hurt that they had just been given bad news.  The first girl had been told that her boyfriend was cheating in very frank terms. The other girl even laughed when she was warned she was being framed for stealing from the till at the shop where she worked.
Sherlock hung up the phone and tossed it in her bag. If John died, she would be alone in a way that Lestrade would never comprehend.
“Well.” Dr. Norwood polished his glasses, “I…”
John’s eyes narrowed. He was certain he hadn’t been followed. Before he could ask anything, the waitress was putting a folded note on the table and swaying off to deliver the glass of water and allergen list that remained on her tray.
John was now in possession of a desk, a few chairs, a filing cabinet, and a locking case for supplies. His supplies included a box of cotton swabs, a few other random bits and bobs, and an a cupboard that he didn’t want to explore. The space was clean, but clearly disused but for some storage in the front waiting area.
Lucy replied, “I’m John’s cousin, Dr. Stamford. We’ve met.” Lucy held out her hand, “Lucy Woodbine. His rouge CIA assassin of a fake wife hated me, so I’m sure we’ll be good friends.”
Sherlock inhaled. “Check again.”
John could see the edges of a confused moue pulling at the corners of Sherlock’s mouth. “I wish to know how you arrived at that conclusion.”
Sherlock didn’t look up. “You may set up a command center in the hall.”
The case in this chapter is horribly mangled and lifted from a
Again, clearly the government.
“Yes, there are variances from dog to dog, as there are from human to human.” John prayed for patience. “They know dogs, and they they know what they’re doing. This isn’t the Friday night I planned on having.”
“It won’t.” Though she had no real way to make that promise, John believed her. Something blazed in Sherlock’s eyes. “It’s clear, despite my occasional musings to the contrary, that you need a post as a doctor.”
John bit into a biscuit to avoid thinking of his piece of shit father, who had wasted no time in remarrying after the divorce and living a perfectly dull life somewhere, with no thought to the twins or his first wife, even as she was in the throes of fucking cancer. Last John had heard, Hamish Watson was living rather comfortably. Mum was doing alright, she got by, but Hamish had never done right by her, and Mum refused to touch his pay.
“You are the most virtuous person I know, John.” Sherlock replied, turning over onto her side, and shoving her pillow down to make it comfortable, her face towards the dog, and thus, John. “I make a study of people. It is simple fact and I shall not hear otherwise, especially not from you.”
After they finished eating, Mummy looked to Sherlock and reminded her to make sure she took her luggage upstairs. Sherlock set down her teacup, because she refused to drink anything else, and John lived in fear of dehydration. “Mummy, I thought we were your guests.”
John knew he had to fight this flight of sentimentality with the reality of caring for this animal, who would need round the clock care for months if he pulled through, and would likely have worse behavior patterns than Sherlock herself. “Do you mean to tell me that you will do as something as boring as keep a schedule for a helpless creature?”
After a moment, John spoke. “Sherlock, you know I’d never let him take MacPherson.”
“You are foolish.” Sherlock retorted, her voice soft and soothing, not for the man before her, but for her dog, “You have no plans to reveal anything you think you know.”
Greg spluttered as his arms fell to his sport coat, rumpled and haphazard. He patted his pocket, “Give it back.”
“Because he hasn’t got one.” John inserted, feeling very much like he had woken up in an alternate reality wherein he was some kind of captain with seven children. There was, indeed, something very fearsome about that, in that John knew in the pit of his soul that he was as alone as alone could be.
Lucy hissed as she realized just who’d prevented her from tumbling back on her arse. “Suck it, Watson. I’m getting that window spot and you’re not stopping me.”
John gaped, forcing himself to swallow his beer before doing so. “She told you that?”
“Oh, God.” John breathed, as chemicals were open around her and there was a pot of God knew what boiling on the stove. Upon second sniff, it smelt of acid and some corrosives. He did not know what the madman had planned, but the chemicals said quite a lot. Molly’s words rang in his ears, below the steady thrum of his pulse,
“Yes, fantastic idea. Brilliant.” Sherlock’s blue eyes glittered, as she paused and stared into his gaze very intently, more memorization that deduction. A heartbeat passed between them, punctuated with yet another breathless kiss.
“Leave me alone about it.” She snapped, “I won’t leave him in the gutter to starve, and I won’t hack him up, or test things on him. What more do you want?”
On and on this went. He treated a few burns, what looked like an old knife wound, splinted a sprained wrist, gave out a handful of tampons, and diagnosed two cases of bronchitis as well as one case of walking pneumonia. There had been a queue of about ten people, and John was cleaning up his area when saw the director approaching with a mug in her hands. John knew he was in for it, as he had rather commandeered the woman’s prep kitchen, “I know that got a bit out of hand.”
Sherlock read his thoughts easily, and laughed musically, her tongue darting out to taste the sweat along his clavicle. John thought now might be a good time to start going through the periodic table, but his eyes and resolve were held captive by the gentle way Sherlock kissed the scratch her zipper had left along his wrist.
John grabbed the chocolates. He wasn’t sharing those. He just wasn’t. How the hell had his mystery benefactor managed to stuff so much in one ordinary box? Were they experts at physics or something? They simply had to have fantastic spacial reasoning skills, for not a centimeter of space was wasted. “Don’t you have some paperwork to do?”
“Dr. Sawyer, Dr. Lee just called off...” The nurse revealed, “Of all the days for her son to need to be picked up from school early.”
She refused to continue down that train of thought. Giving Mycroft credit for anything in her life was unthinkable and disgusting.
Murray was already biting into one. Being the best trauma nurse around got him a free pass, John supposed, “Jesus Christ, Watson. Who wants to have your babies?”
The Granny in the waiting room was looking at him with wide eyes. John returned her stare boldly, even as he draped a warm jumper over Sherlock’s thin frame.
“Do you intend to take up the mantle of a charitable socialite, Sherlock?” Mycroft passed the box to his driver as they approached his governmental vehicle.
Father Holmes did not keep everything in order, but he knew what he was on about...
His first patient blustered into his office just as John had shoved his phone back in his pocket. No, he did not support the idea of explosives in the flat, not even if Sherlock used the empty bedroom upstairs. If she blew a hole in the roof, John would consider them lucky. Sherlock was not one for safety protocols.
(See the end of the chapter for
John looked around the flat, stunned. She had to be fucking joking.
Sherlock was shoved into her Mind Palace. She found herself reaching out in the lift, reaching and reaching and reaching, and unable to touch John. Sherlock felt her pulse begin to race as she moved away from the lifts that were before in reality and began to rocket up the stairs, her feet pounding, brushing past a girl arguing with her parents and a couple avoiding indiscreet rumors.
“They’re four seasons old!” Sherlock bit out, turning against the chair, “At least you should make yourself useful and monitor their progress. A body is a body is a body, be it canine or homo sapien.”
“What else must I do?” Dr. Norwood asked, clearly none too pleased with being told what to do, but somewhat intrigued by her appearance at his door. Briefly, Sherlock wished herself older-looking in appearance. She was frequently dismissed due to her age and her appearance, “Have you any thoughts regarding treatment, then?”
“Our Sherly graduated Newnham at 16 with a first, did her graduate studies, went to Vienna, spent time in New York, don’t mention it, she hated that city, and came home.” The Holmes father was so proud. John could hear it in his voice,  “She was let go from her research post for becoming too involved, shall we say? The rest is hers to tell, but I’ll see that you get a file. School records, hospital reports, etc. etc. etc.”
“The location is need to know.” Sherlock replied, pulling the door open. “As I have made every effort to excuse myself for your needless social interactions, I fail to understand your continued interest. I can waste no further time on your injuries.”
Lucy countered, “And yet, you’re here.”
John lifted his beer, and took a healthy sip. They enjoyed another round, and chatted about everything and nothing. It was good to see a friend again, one who knew him as more than just a solider. He didn’t feel quite so self-conscious around James, not when most of their time at the bar was taken up with his sister’s antics. James was just one of those genuinely nice people that everyone loved, if they were let in past his thick walls.
Yes, there were drawbacks. After all, one was standing before him, despite the fact that he’d tried to play it off as though he wasn’t in the barn. Sherlock, of course, was nowhere to be found. Chowley, farm dog that he was supposed to be, much preferred her company. Thomas, sadly, had come here and sought him out.
“John.” Sherlock quirked an eyebrow as they approached the animal ambulance. Naturally, Sherlock was intent on observing the level of care the animal was provided.
“I...” John began. He was, but his intentions, while self-serving, were also pure.
“John told you.” Sherlock declared, before consuming a bite of the spice cake. John could have eaten the whole thing, but he paced himself and rose to get a glass of milk from the fridge in the corner.
Mycroft spoke again, “I would make some sort of threat, but I’m sure your situation is quite clear to you.”
John’s stomach lurched. He’d never been on the other side of this conversation. MI-6? Really? There was never a chance in hell. It was only after the vet got to assessing the poor dog that John recalled Sherlock’s words, and noted the way she seemed to be focused on the dog.
Sherlock didn’t look back.
John snorted.
It was almost three in the morning by the time they finished this first step of knowing all they needed to know to stay two steps ahead of Victor. Sherlock had deduced that he was already in over his head, having come this weekend for the sole purpose of compelling her to assist him in erasing his debts and managing his aims. John was incandescent, the satisfaction of falling back into roles that had invigorated him for years firing his blood. That he was using these skills with Sherlock’s interest and admiration simply intensified the contentment flooding his veins.
Glancing at Sherlock’s wall, it was clear that she had arrived at the conclusion that sea travel would be the most preferred action. Already, the airport’s vet teams were on the lookout for a deerhound of any stripe in the UK. They’d already to go through the pain of affirming that dogs one through four were not MacPherson.
She was right. The whole thing was decided and it was useless to pretend otherwise.
This story arc is gathering steam, though, so don't be surprised if I update sooner than two months from today.
April led him to the lifts, and began to talk animatedly about her various haunts that she recommended to visitors. John listened in good humor, wondering if the other occupants were quite as bemused at the idea that he would have time to sightsee. John had a book in his pack, and the only thing he planned to do this evening was check in with his contact and go back to reading The Hobbit.
“Why not?” Sherlock retorted, pausing in tossing the offending garment over her head, “Your world revolves around me. That’s more important than heliocentrism.”
Mycroft paused, a calm tower of suppressed rage in the hum of activity around him. John’s hands ached, but his heart was heavier. He knew that this web, this ring, would be extinguished only by going to the source. As vile as he was, Michael was merely a cog in the wheel of a much larger machine. His intel had kept pouring in, and it seemed that MacPherson’s kidnapping had helped several governments to put together the puzzle pieces. They were powerless, cut off at the knees.
“It is Doctor.” Sherlock snapped, very aware of her Ph.D. in this moment. She was the John Watson expert in the room, indeed she was the only one in the world, “John is in agony, in deepest despair, you have done nothing to ease his burdens in the months you have been overseeing his psychological care. Perhaps you are more interested in your grant work. Perhaps patients with TBIs hold more of your interest. Perhaps you are concerned about the professorship opening up at your old college at Oxford? I care not.” Sherlock deduced the man in front of her quickly, “Your duty is to John, and you will do your duty.”
Sherlock deduced him in a second, and nodded her assent. He needed air. MacPherson and Chowley loping at his side, John cut out of the kitchen through the side door. The old swing still creaked in the breeze as he followed the worn stone path past the fairy cottages hidden in the garden and to the boot. John unloaded all of the bags onto the front porch, and forced himself to breathe yet more.
or something like it. Readers would enjoy it.
It was an apropos start, all told, to yet another Holmes family dinner.
Every morning, he was woken up by a slap to the face. Well, something akin to one. MacPherson could simply not bear to have any more time pass without a bit of a pet, so he would initiate the activity by trying to ‘pet’ John. Usually, this happened by bashing his paw on John’s face. At this point, he would crack an eye, and evaluate. If it was dark, he scooted over and let the dog into the bed and patted him until they fell asleep again. If it was light, he made his initial attempt to get out of bed.
“You’re a gem, Doc.” Hawker replied, holding a hot rag to his swollen and angry round face, “Thank you.”
“Think, John, Think!” Sherlock demanded happily, patting the dog and putting her other hand beneath her chin, “Now hundreds more will have access to my services. Oh, think of the cases you’ve given me, you wonderful man.”
“Let’s just get you where you’re going.” Chaplain Parker told her, reminding her a little bit of the clergy at home, who had, despite her distaste for anything religious, had treated her with a fond respect and consideration she had not found in many people of faith. “Landstuhl can be a confusing place.”
Maybe there could be some comfort in the unknown, rather than just living in this vortex of needing to know everything just to survive. This musing didn’t mean that he was going let his guard down or make stupid choices, but it simply served as a reminder that there was a bigger world, a better world, out there beyond him somewhere.
“You’re John Watson.” Sherlock nodded, as 221B came into view, “The only person you should ever go cap in hand to is unlikely to be ever found working in the medical arena.”
The man stepped to face John, a respectful but intent distance, “Hm. Pain in the shoulder. Gun rests uneasily. Possible disdain for cats. Middle class. Possible second generation grenadier.”
Mike’s wife even commented, as she sometimes did.
“You can’t wait for people to offer, Molly.” Sherlock asserted, “Your new lipstick is off putting. You have some just there.”
Sherlock streamlined the whirling of her brain to focus on the important details. She had long ago determined that scope was not always as important as depth of awareness on a minute matter. In this moment, she wanted nothing more than to deduce depth, depth that would enable her to logically and carefully alter her projections. After all, charlatans made predictions. She had science on her side, and Sherlock Holmes made projections on the basis of data.
John seemed to, within weeks, work through something within himself. Sherlock was glad to notice that he was once again eating his weight in horrendous foods like salad and vegetable stew. If the psychology department now received copies of various journals relating to humanistic and positive psychology, Sherlock considered it but a reminder to Norwood.
“A thousand pardons, my lady.” John grinned,  “I’ll find temporal lodgings, then, and leave you to spin castles in the air, shall I?”
“We have a mutual interest, you might say.” The man ignored John’s refusal, “Sit, and drink your tea. I assure you, it’s the finest Earl Grey.”
Not again, John thought as he picked up the phone. Mycroft must have an obsession with crappy spy films. “Good afternoon, Mycroft.”
Sherlock shook her head, “This is not a conflict of interest. As a professional, I am coming to you with observations regarding a patient in your care. I have reason to believe that John would benefit from an alternate modality of treatment. You fail to recognize that John is a caregiver, a protector, a man of his word. He feels that he is not a man, not a person, any longer. You must impress upon him that there is a world beyond what he knows, that there is a world waiting for him.”
“Where is she?” John demanded, calm, cool, and for the first time tonight, feeling in control. He’d been right. He still had it, not that he relished his battle instincts in this moment. He would have rather been wrong, been mad, just to spare her the fear in this world weary young man’s voice. He knew he should have been with Sherlock.
John sank into his chair gratefully. Sherlock, however, had other plans. Perfunctorily, she climbed into his lap, and pressed her chapped and cracked lips to his brow. “John, my John. We survived, and we’re together.” Their eyes met, their gazes held as her weight settled over him, “Don’t forget that, not now.”
“That’s very kind, Sherlock.” Sarah replied, as though she were talking to a small child, “I’ll see if I’m free.”
“I couldn’t stay, watch everything implode.” Sherlock affirmed that she had graduated and taken the post in New York, with the simple but profound admission that there were things she was unable and deeply unwilling to do. “And I won’t stay to rehash meaningless details.”
“Oh, wasn’t it?” Sherlock noted, reaching for her mug of tea in a very telling fashion, “Though I should remind you that the Universe is rarely so lazy.”
With that, the phone Sherlock was holding tightly began to buzz. She fumbled to answer it. “Bring him back.”
He was not surprised to see John, and sent away the staff. When the door shut, enclosing him, Lestrade, and Weston, in the room, John began, “You know why we’re here?”
