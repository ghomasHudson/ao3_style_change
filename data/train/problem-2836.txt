“You coming, Castiel?” Sam said while standing up.
Dean entered the bedroom of his and Castiel’s nine years old daughter, Claire. Castiel was sitting on the bed next to Claire and was telling her a story. Dean smiled at this sight. Until he heard what the story was about.
It didn't take long before Castiel fell asleep again. Dean walked towards his lab, taking one last look at Castiel before entering his lab.
"I would love to. But to be fair, I don't know either what to do." Castiel said as he cards his fingers through Dean's hair. "We can wait to do that, you know." Dean nodded at that. "But if you want to do it, then I would love to."
Dean was sitting in his car, looking at the spell Castiel found, waiting for him to arrive with the last things he needed. They hadn't looked much at the ingredients before (too excited about the cure to care), but Dean needed to check for any tricks or things that would make the creation of the spell harder. All of this seemed too good to be true.
“Yes, Dean I am sure about it.” Castiel answered.
"Whoa, calm down. No need for a gun. I found something for our hunt." Castiel told him, his hands in front of him.
“Thank you, for what?” Dean asked with a sigh..
"Yeah?" Dean answered, not looking up from his drawing of bees on flowers.
Before they could reach it, the door was being forced open with a loud bang.
“You found what?” Sam asked, his brows furrowed. Eileen got out of his bedroom after hearing the fuss Dean made.
__________________________________________________________
“Yeah, I have an idea of their position. I’ll show you while we eat.”
Dean was studying another book. There was nothing that could help them. He glanced at Castiel, who was picking up random books. Sitting in front of Dean, he started to read it at a rapid pace with only his fingers peeking out of the sleeves of his borrowed shirt.
In the seconds that followed, the two men heard Sam shouting in the distance. He had stumbled upon Gabriel and the last time strangers had entered their home, it hadn’t ended well.
They walked hand in hand towards the closest motel, trying to be as discreet as possible.
"Come on, we have a fireplace to light up. I'll show you around later if you want." Castiel nodded and followed Dean.
Not that that would stop Dean from going into those woods and collecting those leaves. But not without protection. Ready to get the ingredients and maybe fight some creatures, Dean packed a bag and took his sword.
Still a bit tired, Dean helped Castiel get out of the bed.
“It’s Sam who doesn’t know how to! Baby is fit and healthy!” Dean defended himself.
Dean's head turned back into place, and he opened his eyes.
"A long time. I’ve stopped counting by this point. Believe me, I searched everywhere for a cure but nothing."
"What? She's been by my side for a long time," Dean grumbled.
"Dean, stop laughing!" Castile complained.
“You can go hide behind the house if you want,” he told him. Castiel nodded and obeyed.
"Oh, by the way, you should really get another car beside a Lincoln."
“I am here to see Castiel!” Dean answered with difficulty because of his position. Dean had no idea why she was attacking him. But, he was sure she wasn't going to hesitate to kill him.
Because of the hunting life, one of Dean’s reflexes was to always sleep with a knife, which resulted in a half-asleep Dean threatening Alex with a knife before the hunter realized what was happening.
"Well someone has to do it." That was unexpected. There is more about him this thought hunter image he conveys.
"Hello, ready to go see Rowena?” Castiel nodded. Dean got out of bed, helping Castiel to do the same, trying to make a few noises as possible. Dean looked outside the window. Dense fog made it impossible to look further than the house. When he and Castiel got out of the house, the cold hit them.
________________________________________________________________________
"How long have you been cursed?" Castiel didn't know how much of this was true, but something made him want to believe Dean.
"Your colleague is already here," the police officer said as he stared at him.
“Is it going to work?” she asked with a low voice.
Dean didn’t give him any time to answer while he grabbed the horse he had bought from Bobby by the harness. He instructed Castiel to take Impala while he put the other horse in an empty stable. “Sorry Buddy, you won’t meet Sammy for a moment.”
"Come on, Cas, wake up," Dean said as he opened the blinds, letting light come in.
Tears ran down Castiel's face. His worst fear had become reality.
"Who's laughing now?" Dean roared with laughter.
"Oh, shut up!" That was the only thing Dean could think of.
According to Ellen, he wouldn’t  wake up before a few hours but he would heal. Even with the good news, Dean couldn’t stop worrying. What if Castiel woke with no memory or couldn’t speak or walk anymore?
They were in the middle of their conversations when Dean and Castiel saw Ben and Claire falling on the floor and crying. They had spotted a chocolate bunny at the same time and bumped into each other as they trying to get the bunny. Around them, everyone stopped what they were doing and looked at the two kids that had fallen. Castiel, Dean, Charlie and Gilda immediately ran towards Ben and Claire.
“I am not sure that I understand…” Castiel stopped when Dean grabbed his hand. Castiel ended up sitting next to his tree, eating the pie Dean bought. With Dean by his side, of course. For Castiel, the human was weird but endearing. The other dryads had many stories about how humans were dangerous and wouldn’t hesitate to destroy the trees, which would result in killing the dryads.
“Don’t worry about that. It would be better if you stayed here,” said Sam, pointing to a chair in front of him.
This was a mistake, and Dean wasn't going to come. But as Castiel was leaving, he heard the door opening.
"So, a ghost? But why the choking? Did the woman have any link with this man?"
"Did you...put me on your lap?" Castiel asked, blushing slightly.
“Of course. Why?”
“We should go to the next village. Sam and I saved a psychic, Missouri, from a witch. Maybe she can help us. Get behind me on Baby’s back.”
Dean had been looking at very boring texts for almost half an hour when he finally found something. Staring at Castiel, who was reading another book on sigils, he went to fetch Sam. Please tell me I’m wrong, he thought, as he glanced back at Castiel. He could see confusion written on Castiel’s face.
Dean ended up on the bed. A lot happened in the last hours. It had been a while, a very long while since he’d talked about the curse. He knew he had to leave Castiel fast as he could before he ended up getting attached. But right now, he was too tired.
_____________________________________________
“Who is this?”
"Castiel," His dad said, putting a hand on Castiel's shoulder and wiped his tears. "Dean is safe. "
"Need something?" One of the hunters asked.
“They are adorable.” Castiel said.
“Anna is waiting for you over there.” She pointed towards Anna who was sitting next to a tree in the middle of the park, with another little girl.
On it, Alex had drawn the entrance of a secret passageway at the back of the castle. The young woman had explained that said entry was old and forgotten. She had stumbled on it by chance. However, she had never used it to escape, too scared for her life. Dean and Castiel looked at each other.
"We’re almost there," Castiel told Dean after hearing grumbling about bumping his head for the third time.
"Thank you. I'll see you when the little one comes." Castiel prepared to go back to Dean and Charlie. Rowena put her hand on his shoulder, stopping him and making him Castiel turn around."
“Sam and I, we hunt them.” There was a silence between them as Castiel was staring blankly at him.
"If we don't find out what the creature is, more people are going to die."
Castiel smiled back at Dean. "We don't know if I am pregnant now. But if it's the case, I would be happy to have a kid with you."
“He is definitely hiding something, but I don’t believe he’s dangerous. Maybe we should trust him a bit more.”
Castiel looked up at him."What? Oh, no sorry, I don't know much about cars. One like my older car would be fine."
"You don't have to," Castiel answered.
Claire was ranting about how she couldn't way for next year and how she found a few chocolate bunnies while Castiel was putting band-aids on her knees. She didn't seem to mind anymore that she had fallen and hurt herself. Sometimes kid are a mystery.
________________________________________________________________________
"Here we are." Castiel pointed to the bushes that hid the cave, avoiding Dean's glance. The entrance was a passage hidden between two bushes. Castiel entered first, bowing his head. It was smaller than he remembered.
Suddenly, the door of his room was kicked open. He must have made too much noise and drawn attention. Thankfully, he just had the time to finish his transformation.
"Can I talk to you?" Dean asked. Castiel nodded. However he better have a good explanation.
“Who the fuck wouldn’t worry if someone disappeared for a day?”
"Thank you, Cas. I don't have anything to offer in return. But this means a lot to me. I swear I will take good care of it."
"Nah. Mostly just a bunch of ingredients that are going to be a pain in the ass to find," Dean said, making Castiel chuckle.
"Castiel?" Dean asked, putting his hand on Castiel's arm, startling him. "Maybe, you could just come with me.” Dean shrugged. “I mean until you have a new car..."
“It’s complicated?”
Seeing Dean's face Castiel started laughing. "Sorry. It's just you look like a deer  in the headlights."
_______________________________________________________________________
“You want to adopt?” Dean asked. Castiel nodded.
"Thank you, Dean." Castiel said.
"All right, hang in there. I need to grab something." Dean helped Castiel lean his head on another tree and draped his coat on him. He then ran toward Castiel's tree and cut a few branches from it. Dean heard Cas wince behind him. But he couldn't slow down. They didn't have enough time.
He put the potion for Castiel next to him trying to not wake him up. When Dean poured his potion over Castiel's tree, it grew slightly and created a sprout. He stopped there. With that, the tree will grow quicker than normal.
Castiel opened the book, looking at the spells and rituals noted in it. When Castiel landed on one particular page, memories came rushing back. He had to sit down for a moment. He grabbed the book again to check if he’d read it right.
"I can't wait until we find my baby," Dean said, half-awake, making Castiel laugh.
He had suspected it but having the confirmation made his heart ache. He hadn’t thought about how he would react if he had the evidence.
When Castiel got into his car, he sat for several long minutes. He wasn't ready to confront Dean. He didn't know what he was going to say. Maybe he could just print the photos he took and put them under Dean's door with a note. Dean did leave
Dean held out his hand and took some leaves. The next thing he knew, he was upside down, a branch holding his foot. He looked around him, startled. A man appeared in front of him. He had yellow leaves in his dark brown hair and his hands seemed to be made of wood.
"This time I am putting a lock on the door." Dean grumbled.
"Well, thanks. That's depressing." Castiel smiled at the woman when she turned back.
They saw the two men leaving, going somewhere unknown. At this moment Walt stood up and moved as discreetly as he could.
"Fair enough." Dean calmed down. He had thought his magick abilities had gotten worse. Now that he knew that this wasn't the case, Dean was sure he could save Castiel. After those men attacked Castiel's tree, Dean had been afraid to use his potions. What if another one backfired?
“Like regular humans. But they could have been creatures.” Castiel told her.
She stepped back, still as wary as before. Once she finally agreed to come forward, Dean got back on her.
When they arrived at the forest, Dean immediately called for Rowena.
Right now, Castiel was mumbling something about having passed too much time in the hospital and needing to change his clothes. He went in their bedroom and closed the door behind him before Dean could enter in it.
Castiel winced as Dean didn't say anything. He shouldn't have said that. He tried to pick his clothes quicker. All he wanted now, was to leave.
"Castiel, do you agree?" Castiel snapped out of his trance. All of the other hunters were looking at him.
Castiel chuckled seeing Dean's face light up."It is a surprise." Castiel smiled at Dean and led him towards his secret place. When they arrived, Castiel realized he had been holding Dean's hand all time. He realized that Dean was staring at their hands too and blushing. Castiel let go of Dean's hand and cleared his throat.
"Nice place, right?" Dean said, startling Castiel.
"Ok! But I have to ask my dad and my mom first."
“The one that kidnapped newborn babies?” Dean nodded. That case has been one of the most horrible ones they had ever worked. Dean sighed and handed the book to Sam  he had been reading.
“I didn’t do anything. It was Ellen, the healer. She was the one who patched you up.” Castiel sighed and shook his head. He hoped Dean would realize one day what a good person he was. Castiel would do anything to make sure he realized.
"So, what did I tell you?"
-1 month later
“Why are all of your books about creatures?” Castiel asked out of the blue. Dean hesitated for a few seconds. Was it a good idea to tell him that he and Sam hunt those monsters?
Castiel closed the door and fall to the ground. He knew he shouldn't have to get attached when Dean told him about the curse. And now he was sitting on the ground, crying for someone who left him right after he admitted his feelings. And it was all his fault.
"Hello, Dean. You finished work early." Castiel said, looking up at Dean with a smile on his face.
" When he entered Dean's house, yesterday, Castiel was overwhelmed by how many things Dean had. At first, he had no idea where to look. But the longer he passed the more he found this habit endearing.
"You're friend didn't come?" Castiel's mom asked when she saw him coming back alone.
It took a few seconds for Alex to calm down after Dean put away his knife and rambled an apology.
"What?" Asked Castiel, huffing as he crossed his arms.
______________________________________________________________________
He ran out of his room as soon as he could to find his parents. He found them, (speaking softly) in the corridor.
When he suspected it, Dean had protected Castiel all along and now he regretted it. The other man, or more precisely creature, had lied to them. Castiel interrupted his train of thought when he wrote something else. SAM GONE. As he read the inscription, the hunter went mad. Nobody hurt his little brother.
Dean got up from the couch, still grumbling about being woken up. If Sam was right and Ella was getting better, then Dean had to thank the dryad a second time. But for now, he was going home and back to sleep.
Castiel winced. That wasn't a good start. Castiel waited for Dean to come back, searching for what exactly he was going to say. He sat on Dean's couch right in front of the fireplace. Dean came back, a smile on his face, and sat next to him.
"No, no, no." Castiel turned page after page of the notepad, trying to see if Dean had written anything else and this was a sick joke...but there was nothing. He ran out of the motel, but the Impala was gone.
"Thank you. That's sweet." Castiel grabbed the potion and slowly drank it. Once he finished, he patted the space next to him. "Dean, come in bed with me.
Castiel followed the officer, getting ready to possibly of having to fight an actual FBI agent.
"I'm fine!" A thought went through Castiel's head, and before anyone came in the room, he grabbed his phone and took as many photos as he could of the pages on immortality. "I found the book we were searching for!" He said after hiding his phone and closing the book.
Dean got off his horse and tied the horse’s lead to a tree, then drew his sword and walked toward the house.
“Where are you hurt?” Dean asked as he picked Ben up.
"Sorry, I got distracted," Castiel mumbled as he handed the plants to Dean.
"I may have asked some other hunters about you. Dean, I saw a photo of you from the sixties and you haven't changed even a little; you can’t exactly blame me."
"Yeah, I do. A lot." He chuckled. In total they were eight There was Anna, Gabriel, Lucifer, Michael, Raphael, Balthazar and another Hannah. How his parents manage to have that many kids, is still a mystery.
"Want to go grab some food?" Dean asked when it was lunchtime. Castiel nodded and they headed to the nearest restaurant.
“Mine? Why not yours?”
"I apologize about earlier. I shouldn't have asked all these questions. And I should have trusted you more. I thought you were here to kill us or something like that." At that sentence, Cas let go slowly of the dagger. That wasn't exactly what he expected. He was an idiot.
Dean looked at the map again, searching for a place where Sam could be. The castle’s cells weren’t too far away but no one would have left such places unguarded.
Castiel raised his head, confused, but followed him anyway.
"Found it! I think." Dean called out. There was indeed
He knew that Castiel would ask this question at some point. “After you explained to us why you knew so much about the supernatural, I had a gut feeling that something was wrong, so I started doing some research. It seems I had a good reason for it.”
"Can he come to see my bedroom, now?" Dean asked the woman behind him as he tugged on her pullover's sleeve.
"Dean!" Castiel called.
They passed the next hour playing football. Next to them, Bee was (laying) on the ground. Dean would comment with a funny voice, on everything that happened, pretending to be Bee. Once they got bored of playing football they laid down in Castiel's garden and passed the time speaking about everything and anything.
"You don't have to! I just had to ask because..." Dean rambled. Castiel chuckled at that. He never saw Dean like this. Usually, Dean was way more confident than that.
When he heard them coming, Dean made sure one last time that everything was in place.
“Right, that would explain the ring on my finger.” Dean roll his eyes at Castiel’s answer.
Dean sat up immediately. They’d talked about what they were going to do beforehand. Dean would help Castiel to go to the forest and see Rowena.
Castiel closed his eyes again, inspiring deeply. Searching for the source of the sickness, imagining the tree getting better, Dean's face close to his.
A few moments later, Castiel was woken up by the sound of a car.
_____________________________________________
“Castiel, do you believe in them? The creatures in those books?”
Irritated by his answer, the hunter stretched out his hand and snatched the blanket away and tossed it. Naked. Naked under a blanket, this Castiel guy was in his stable instead of the horse.
It was a peaceful morning in the Winchester’s household. Except for the six years old Ben who was jumping up and down his father’s bed.
"I see that news travels fast here. Promise you won't tell anyone?" Castiel asked her.
________________________________________________________________________
"We are going to need to do some research, then."
________________________________________________________________________
"Your names young men?" Asked the teacher. He was a man in his fifties with brown graying short hair and a beard. And if Castiel remembered well his last name was Singer.
Stopping, the hunter hesitated for a second, though the horse didn’t seem worried by him at all. In fact, it walked right toward Dean, who put his hand in front of himself, as if to prove he didn’t mean it any harm. The horse came so close to him that he could reach out and touch it. Cautiously, Dean placed the harness.
Silence fell between them, again. Castiel looked away, searching for something to say.
“Hey Dean, since when do you call him Cas?”
"I should bring Rowena. Just in case there is something worse."
"I don't remember. Why do you care anyway?"
"Oh God, you're awake. The werewolf attacked you and knocked you out. I got you. You're gonna be okay."
It was Easter and like every time Ben was waking up Dean by jumping on his bed. Except that this time he wasn't alone. A few months ago Castiel and Claire had moved in with the Winchesters. And now Claire and Ben were jumping up and down while shouting that they wanted egg hunting.
"You make your coffee every morning. Not that complicated." Dean said as he grabbed another shirt.
"Yes. But don't worry, this is not the first time someone passed out on me during labor." Rowena said behind them.
Dean got out of the Impala and looked inside of the car. "You're lucky I happen to be a pretty good mechanic." He turned the ignition again so that he could listen to it. . "Mind if I look under the hood?" Dean asked.
"Cas?" Castiel heard, making him smile and turn around. Castiel ran toward him, his heart beating in his chest.
"Did I pass out?" Dean asked him.
"No," Castiel said, dragging his plushie behind him. He was about to open his bedroom door when the doorbell rang. As soon as he heard the doorbell, Castiel ran towards the door as fast as he could.
"Do you like your dorm?" Dean asked as they got out of Singer's classroom.
“Isn’t it odd that Cas just appeared out of nowhere?”
"Sure." Castiel turned around to gaze out the window, seeming disappointed.
“You sure about that? This is a huge step. Plus I mean look at us, a retired superhero and the man who his suppose to be his enemy.”
"Go to the point, Castiel!" A woman shouted back.
Dean tilted his head slightly, and their lips slotted against each other like lock and key. Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel's waist and pushed him on the couch.
“Did it work?” Sam asked, standing up from his couch when he saw Dean. He had dark circles under his eyes, the result of the long hours he’d stayed awake. Besides Sam, Eileen was looking just as exhausted.
"Cas," Dean said gently. "Look at me, please." Castiel turned around and looked at Dean who had a big smile on his face. Dean opened his mouth and closed other and other again.
He walked around, searching for the dryad’s tree. Once he found the tree Dean, put his bag down, and approached the tree with care.
"Yes," Castiel answered wich made the stranger smile.
But a bullet from the other hunters broke the (back window) and pierced Dean's shoulder. Dean lost control of the car for a split second, the car almost draping.
They had started to dig the grave when the ghost appeared again, not far from Dean.
"It may not work but we could find out what this creature is."
Three other months passed and Castiel started to lose hope. He slowly stopped wondering where Dean was. Castiel started to realize that he was probably never going to see Dean again. But Castiel didn't want to think about that.
"He's right here." Dean tried to point at the man.
His hand still hidden by the sleeve, he slipped out of his room on tip-toes. Seeing almost nothing in the dark, he tried to find his way to the main door using the wall.
“I’m coming, I’m coming!” Dean heard Sam grumbling.
"I know that one. It's where I found that horse I thought you stoled. What were the odds?"
"Thank you!" The other boy said. But instead of going back to playing, the other boy stayed in front of the fence. He was holding the ball on his chest and stared at his shoes. A few seconds passed, where neither Castiel nor the other boy talked. With every second that passed, Castiel grew more and more uncomfortable. He was about to ask if everything was alright when the other boy spoke.
“You idjits should learn how to take care of your horses.”
"I'm sorry but I'm tired." He said as he stood up in one move. "Can you get out, please?" Dean was sitting on the bed confused before standing up reluctantly opening the door. As he got out of the room he turned his head and stared at Cas for a few seconds. And then he was gone.
Castiel and Dean had been walking around the cemetery for a while now. It was cold, and it was the middle of the night. Being a hunter wasn't always interesting.
"Dean, did you hear that?" He murmured, trying to divert the attention from himself.
After ten minutes of waiting, Castiel started to wonder if Dean already waited for him and went back home. Thinking about that, Castiel squeezed his plushie on his chest and silently begged Dean to come back.
Castiel looked at both of them, lost. He couldn’t explain what had happened to him, right? Taking a breath, he thought of the stories he had recounted every time. It wasn’t the best but it had at least worked previous times.
"The hell?" Castiel groaned once when he was in his car. Don't get him wrong, he was used to weird things. Ghosts, witches, and strange deaths were his everyday life. But this was a brand new kind of weird; and now, the more Castiel thought about it, the more his head hurt.
A year had passed since Dean's house burned down. Dean's birthday was coming around the corner. And Castiel was going to miss his birthday for the second year in a row. And Castiel still had no idea what happened to Dean after the fire, but he didn't want to know any more or even think about it.
Because of that, he was the only person in the world who could unleash hundreds of vampires on them. And he knew where they lived and was aware of the sigil. That’s where Alex came into play.
" Charlie asked.
Three years had passed and it will soon be the end of college. Castiel was weirded by all of this. Those years passed so quickly. But something was bothering him. Dean had been a bit distant lately. Those times Castiel would mostly see Dean in class or at the lunch break. And even then he wouldn't speak much to him. Dean would get out of their dorm as early as possible and get back as late as possible. However, Dean wasn't acting like this with either Kevin or Charlie. As he was thinking about Dean's odd behavior he spotted Dean, Charlie, and Kevin speaking, at the end of the corridor. Castiel immediately turned around and walked in the opposite direction.
Balancing two cups of coffee in one hand, Dean opened the door to their motel room with his other hand. As he stepped inside the room he called "Hey, I'm b-" Before Dean could finish his sentence, a gun was pointed towards his face. Dean flinched, dropping one of the cups of coffee and spilling coffee all other his shirt and his plaid.
"It's two in the morning! Whoever you are, you better have a good reason to wake me up!" Rowena shouted. "Oh, it's you two. Come on, I'm going to take care of you." She immediately softened at the sight of the two. Castiel, in pain but holding it together, and Dean was panicking.
“Hello? My name is Dean. I am sorry about yesterday. My niece is very sick, and no one’s found a way to take care of her. I may save her with your leaves.” For a moment, no one answered. Dean stood in front of the tree. The longer he waited, the more he felt like his last chance to save his niece was slipping through his fingers.
“For everything. Not kicking me out even when you know I am not human. And for saving my life.”
“Why? What do you want from him?” She insisted.
Dean's remark took Castiel by surprise. It was rare for people to compliment his name. Most kids found it weird and made fun of him because of it.
Struggling to keep his cries of pain quiet, the young man looked down at his hand. The skin was red, dry, and sore.
"Dean!" Castiel screamed, stopping aiming at the other car for a moment.
________________________________________________________________________
"Not much, the usual."
"Uh, sure. I'm tired and don't know if I could drive safely to my motel. Do you have somewhere I can sleep?"
Castiel answered while Dean grabbed his computer.
“Is she ok?” Dean mumbled, still half-asleep.
The next morning, Dean woke up still tired because of the potion he made last night. He took his bag, and like the day before, headed toward the forest. This time he didn’t take his sword, not wanting to anger the dryad even more.
On the first page, a sigil was drawn. It was similar to the one the main door. On the second one, there was a description. When Castiel had read those lines, he cursed. If any creature tried to open something wich had this sigil on it, they hand will burn. If he had left his hand on the window he could have lost it. There are more discrete things than a burned hand. And now Dean was gone.
At that point, he only had one way to get out of this situation: he had to change into his horse form. He undressed as quickly as he could manage.
"Finally! I searched for this room for way too long." He sighed. At least Castiel wasn't the only one to be late.
"Dean, we destroyed the book for a reason. There are things in this book that could cause mass destruction and hundreds of other catastrophes."
Dean stared at them. "Well, it seems like we have a new case on our hands." Dean grinned at Castiel. "But first, we still have to get you a car."
Dean and Castiel talked together about their kids and then about how hard it could be to raise a kid alone. For some reason, they ended up talking about their personal lives, their relations with their families. Castiel hadn’t heard about the rest of his family since he had Claire. Well, except for Gabriel. He was the only brother that cared about Castiel even if Gabriel would prank whenever he could.
“Sammy! I found something interesting.” His brother was also doing research in another part of the library. Getting his attention, he continued, “Do you remember that coven we found last year?”
Back in front of the house, Baby was giving Castiel a hard time. He had untied the harness, but Baby was galloping in a circle. Behind him, Cas was running behind her, trying to catch her.
_____________________________________________
In the bed, his father, Dean, groaned thinking about how he should have put a lock on his door a long time ago.
“Please, just drink it,” Dean told her.
"Shut up! I just want to see what they are doing."
Castiel was sitting in the dinner, repeating in his mind everything he was going to tell Dean, his burger long forgotten.
"I'm so sorry, Cas. This is all my fault. I knew I shouldn't have stayed." Castiel's eyes started opening.
"Is your shoulder feeling better?" Castiel asked once they were alone in the motel room.
A few days later, when Dean arrived at the forest, Castiel ran towards him, hiding something behind his back. When he saw what it was, Dean looked at Castiel, confused.
"It hurts," Castiel groaned. "Thank you, by the way."
"All right, thank you," Castiel answered, then turned to Dean."Well, it seems I'm stuck here for a bit longer,” Castiel said, chuckling. “Anyway, thank you for everything, Dean."
"You can go." The woman grumbled after picking up the phone. Without a word, Castiel helped Dean stand up and walked out. Dean was gripping him and limping the entire way.
Dean and Castiel drove for two long hours, chatting about things they did during those three years, both carefully avoiding talking about the last day they saw each other.
"Castiel!" Dean shouted as he ran toward him.
“Sorry. I’m used to living alone. And when I heard the door being opened, I assumed the worst.”
"You can use the bed."
________________________________________________________________________
________________________________________________________________________
They had been staying in another town, Dean helping Castiel to find a new car. The motel room they stayed in was bleak, with two full beds, an archaic television, and a door to what barely passed for a bathroom. The front door had three massive locks on it, which didn't bode well for the security of the town.
Unlike his younger brother, Dean had never been a morning person. That day wasn’t any different. Staying up late was never a problem. But waking up early? A nightmare.
“Let him sleep here? Because of him, the horse is gone!”
"A prank?" Dean asked. Well, that was surprising coming from Castiel.
His stomach growling, he heads to the room where Castiel was sleeping. After banging on the door, he heard a grunt.
Dean recognized her as Claire, Castiel’s daughter. Castiel and Claire lived across the street from Dean and Ben. They arrived in the neighbourhood three years ago. Like Dean, Castiel was raising his kid on his own. However, no one seemed to know why he was living on his own with his kid. He hadn’t talked about an ex-wife or husband or if he had adopted Claire on his own.
He found Castiel sitting next to his tree reading Dean's book. Castiel had borrowed a lot of books lately.
"Dean, Castiel is going to be okay. Rowena knows what she is doing." Dean nodded, after what happened, he was stressed about leaving him alone. He knew he could trust Castiel, but the fear was still there.
“Hello, we’re searching for a woman named Alex. Do you know if she’s here right now?” Dean asked the bartender. The man had a weird haircut that we had never seen in his life. In the front, the hairs were cut short and in the back, his hair was much longer. In secret, Dean hoped that this haircut would never be a trend.
“What do you want?” She asked, her eyes narrowed and her arms crossed.
The officer frowned at them. "All right. By the way, a grave has been violated. I thought it may be related to this case."
What would happen when Dean came back? Getting back to the house was too dangerous in his horse form and he couldn’t come back, naked, in his human form. He didn’t know what would be worse:
Well, Castiel tried to start it anyway. He tried over and over again to no avail.
"So, what do you think about this one?" Dean asked.
Castiel thanked him and grabbed his cup."How did you know how I like my coffee?" Castiel asked after taking a sip.
“You said the same things the last time.”
"So, how long have you known Castiel?" Dean asked Charlie a few minutes later.
Dean looked back at Castiel who was having a hard time staying awake. Another dryad was sitting next to him, checking if he had any wounds.
"Are you sure you're all right? It's late and you’ve never come here before on your own." Dean asked Castiel. "Is something going on in the forest?" He continued, his eyebrows frowned.
"Yes. However, my roommate seems to be a douche." Castiel only interacted with his roommate once but he was already getting on his nerve.
The hunter chuckled. This had gone way better than he had expected. In his mind, Bobby would have told him to get his shit together. His idea could work. Speaking with Cas was almost impossible.
Dean nodded, and the brothers went to their dining room while chatting.
"It won't happen again. I promise you."
"It's not the moment for this kind of discussion, Dean." They crouched behind a fallen rack pallet. As much as neither of them had thought they were still followed, they’d still prepared a backup plan.
"Sorry! I didn’t see you there!" Dean apologized to the man, after scaring the shit out of him. Dean saw Castiel coming out of the station from the corner while the man was shouting at him. As soon as he was gone, Castiel, who had been staying as far as possible from the stalkers, climbed into the Impala.
"No, no, no. This can't be happening." Castiel stood in the middle of the room, not knowing what to do. He saw the note left by Dean.
"Please? You can do it later."
Dean was watching Ben running around followed closely by Anna and Claire.
Dean and Castiel had been searching for the spell ingredients for months. For months, they had been hiding from the group of hunters that Castiel had worked with. But now, finally, they had found all of them. They found an abandoned warehouse that was far enough from any populated areas to do the spell.
"Shit! They're right behind us!" Dean swore and stepped on the gas. But right at this moment, the other hunters started to fire at them.
"Do you need help?" Castiel asked when he saw Dean going toward the kitchen.
“Calm down. I can check tomorrow if someone knows him, but you should at least try riding him. If it doesn’t work between the two of you, I can always buy you a new one.”
"I don't want to keep you a secret. And I don't think I am very discreet anyway." Dean said chuckling. "But I have no idea at all how to explain our situation."
Dean and Castiel walked slowly towards the figure, their guns pointed at the ghost. The voice called out again. Both of them turned around towards the sound and saw a pale figure in the distance.
written
“Right. You know, I was only curious,” he replied instantly. In front of him, Castiel immediately went back to his book on sigils.
At his potion shop, Dean couldn’t stop thinking about his few encounters with Castiel. Unfortunately, with all the work, he had to wait until the end of the week to get back to see Castiel. And he wondered why Castiel wanted to see him again. Not that he was complaining. The day passed slowly, way too slow for Dean. From time to time, he wondered if he should bring some human objects that Castiel had never seen before.
Castiel and Dean thanked Rowena one last time. This time with their kid. When they arrived, Dean noticed that something had changed in the garden.
“Do you have to do that every time?” Dean asked. The psychic simply nodded and smiled at him.
"Not really. Bad things happen to you with that job. And you know, you will never have a normal life again. Still, it feels good when you can save people and not letting all that crap in their life."
"Hum, Cas?" Castiel perked up as he heard his name. Suddenly, he realized how close he was to the hunter's face.
"What do you want to do with that?"
"I got them!" He shouted as soon as the bullet pierced the wheel. "Dean, how are you doing?"
"That wasn't my intention. But as your friend, I want to know everything." She answered, jumping from her tree.
"Thank you again. I will give back your clothes when I can." Castiel told Dean. Dean nodded at him and waved him goodbye.
“You know what you are, Sam? Too kind.” The older brother looked at Sam, groaning. “All right. But one condition: we always keep an eye on him.”
“Come in. I was waiting for you,” she said.
"I found it!" Castiel shouted. A few weeks before, another hunter had asked him and some others for help. She had spotted a coven that was making sacrifices and gaining a lot of power. Lately, Castiel and the other hunters thought that the strange gain of power was caused by a book. One particular book: The book of the damned.
"I should go back to work." Dean sighed as he stood up and stretched. "Do you want to come tonight?"
"Name's Dean Winchester."
“Awesome!” Dean said like it was the greatest news of his life. “Anyway, did you discover anything new about the case?”
“I had a sword! I am just not a big enthusiast of offending people.”
The woman shook her head. "Is Monday afternoon good for you?"
"You're all right?" Dean asked.
"You weren't complaining last night." Hearing that, Castiel rolled his eyes. And then it hit him.
Castiel and Charlie put their hands on the ground, closed their eyes, and concentrated. A tree had fallen sick and they decided to help it.
"Agent." Dean and Castiel nodded at each other. The moment the officer left the room, Dean laughed.
“Are you okay?” Dean asked him, chuckling.
“An accident is when you burn the dinner. Not shooting your husband’s arm” Castiel answered.
“Who’s blood is it? Just tell me what happened to Sam.” The hunter’s grip on his sword was getting tighter and tighter. “Do you know where they went?”
"Your family died," Castiel said.
“Dean? Why are you here?” he asked.
“You aren’t much of a talker, are you?”
Dean Winchester was a moron. He was lying in bed, with Castiel, who had his head on Dean's chest and was still sleeping. He shouldn't have stayed with him. He shouldn't have kissed him, and he shouldn't have gotten in bed with him (they didn't even do anything there, but he still shouldn't have done that).
"It's not a joke. I promise. I found this in the Book of the Damned."
Dean nodded, grabbing his sword, and helped Castiel get out of the house and heading towards the forest. As they headed towards the forest and time passed, Castiel's pain got worse and worse.
"Oh, sure. I'm just going to stay in the car for a minute. I want to get a better look at the spell."
The weeks following the switch of dorm were way calmer. Dean and Castiel passed even more time together than before. Castiel enjoyed Dean's company more and more. He could listen to him speak about what he was passionate about for hours without getting bored.
“You remember the Sarnen Lake? Well, there was a horse near it and I brought it home.”
Castiel sighed, glancing at the hunter who drank his ale in one gulp. Right now, all Dean could think about was the long time they would have to wait before Alex returned
"It's different from cars and motels." The house had a grand living room with a glass chandelier and stairs leading to a second floor.
"Castiel, look." A tree sprout had appeared not far from Castiel's tree. Seeing this, Castiel smiled at it.
Since the sleeves were a little too long for him, he pulled them over his hands, effectively hiding them.
“Sorry. Shouldn’t have mentioned all of this to you. Let’s talk about something else.” A silence fell between them.
"I'm sorry."
“So, are you staying or are you leaving?” He looked up and noticed a sigil painted in red on the door.
Please, tell me they are neither hunters nor witches, he prayed.
Dean jumped, startled by his neighbour. Castiel was the kind of person who you didn’t hear coming.
________________________________________________________________________
"It worked," Dean breathed. "Castiel, it worked!!!" He took Castiel in his arms, tears coming to his eyes. He won't have to live forever watching everything around him grow old and die.
“You won’t say that once you that you tried the pie, that I got you. It’s the best in town.” Dean said as he got the pie out of his bag. Castiel stared at him, eyes squinted and head tilted.
However,  Dean told him about his parents. How his mother died, burned alive by a demon. How it destroyed, slowly his father. Dean and Sam learning about hunting at a very young age. His father sacrificing himself for Dean.
He then remembered Castiel’s attempt to run away. Why had he declined Dean’s offer to let him go?
“I knew it was a bad idea to leave you here alone. So I came back.”
Castiel nodded before grabbing it and throwing it to the other boy.
Castiel stared at Dean, frowning.
Speaking of his brother, his new horse was following with no problem. It was odd for Dean to think that a few months before, the horse that he was bringing back home was probably Cas.
After a few seconds of walking, Castiel spotted Dean at the end of the corridor. "Dean!" He began to run toward him.
"All right, sweetheart." Dean nodded.
"No." Walt walked away from the window, thinking about the strange look of one of the men.
"I get it.” Dean checked the cups. One of them was still full. “I got you coffee by the way," Dean told him as he handed him the coffee cup.
"I thought he wanted our help, but no! He tried to stab me!" Castiel complained.
They walked outside, shivering and walking slowly towards the forest. He hoped Rowena was free and would be okay with helping him.
“What did you do this time?” asked Sam, suspicious.
Because of that, he decided that showing Castiel was a better idea. It’s for that reason that Dean ended up kissing a surprised Castiel. Both of them couldn’t believe what was happening.
“Sam, this is Alex, Alex this is my brother Sam. Now, Sam, you go with Alex. I’ll go on Baby with Castiel. We have to go to Ellen before it’s too late.” Alex opened her mouth but Dean was quicker than her. “She’s a healer, I’ll show you the way.”
"No, go sit down."
"Oh, shut up." Dean groaned. "We have better things to talk about."
"I'm Castiel," Castiel answered as he reached for Dean's hand and grabbed it.
“My original plan was to get out as soon as I could. But you let me stay, have a bed of my own and even...” He looked at his bowl warily. “Food.”
"All right, then," Castiel answered with a smile. "Thank you, by the way." Castiel scooted a little closer to Dean.
“Dean! Are you all right?” Castiel ran to Dean, who was lying on the ground.
_____________________________________________
“Right. Now get up. You should get back home.”
"That's a cool name!" Dean answered with a big smile.
"I'm good to go," Castiel said, getting into the Impala. Dean immediately folded the photos.
It had taken time for Castiel to get over Dean leaving him out of the blue. He’d gone from motel to motel, not going out of the motel out he was staying in.  Castiel almost tried to find Dean a few times.
“The hunt is in eight hours, Ben, let me sleep a bit longer.”
-Two years later:
But time passed and Castiel still didn't have news from Dean. After three months, his parents told him that the Winchesters probably (moved to another town). Maybe even state. But Castiel was still sure that he will get news from Dean. It didn't matter what his parents told him. He knew that he will see Dean again, soon.
Walt only had the time to take another look through before one of the men closed the shutters. He still saw the men's face. One of them looked like he had left in his hair and his arms strangely looked like wood.
The main thing he was feeling was pain, though. Everything from his skin to all of his bones were changing at the same time in his body. Even after all these years, he was still not used to it.
Finally, it stopped and he could hear Castiel picking up the clothes and putting them.
“Could you repeat that, slower this time?” Bobby asked, trying to figure out what Dean was telling him.
"If you ever become a threat in any way or we find out you’ve lied to us, we will hunt you down. And this time, no second chances."
-3 months later
"I feel like I'm intruding. I am going to leave you alone." Charlie told them.
“Wait. How did he get in the stable?”
Castiel walked home, thinking about last night. He never had been out of the forest, he knew it was dangerous for him, but the glimpse made him want to see more.
"Charlie?" Dean shouted when he arrived in the forest.
“Sure. It’s always better than the hospital’s food.” Castiel grumbled. Dean sighed, this is never going to end.
Once Sam, Eileen, and Ella went back home, Dean for the first time in the day felt relieved.
Castiel left the dinner, took a deep breath, and walked towards the motel Dean was staying in. The entire way, Castiel repeated to himself to calm down.
“Is it weird that I’m happy that I was hit on the head?” Castiel asked, still dazed by what happened had happened, making Dean chuckle.
"Everything's fine. I just want to make sure we didn't miss anything." Castiel walked towards the gas station, sometimes looking back at Dean to make sure everything was all right.
The best place to get information about other hunters was a hunters roadhouse, which was exactly where Castiel was going.
Castiel looked at Dean leaving, the impression that he saw him somewhere not leaving, and at the last moment, he asked."Have I met you somewhere?"
"My tree is starting to blossom!" Castiel told him, a huge smile on his face. "I'm pregnant!" After he registered what he said, Dean laughed and hugged Castiel closer.
"Hey! Had a nice day?" Castiel heard Dean say at the door.
"Where's my gun?" Dean jumped off the bed.
Dean followed Charlie while keeping an eye on Ben who was talking energetically to Anna and Claire. They were approaching the group of parents when he spotted Castiel who was sitting with the other parents.
"Can you put the gun down, now?" Dean asked Castiel.
"His name's Dean Winchester."
The door opened, Dean's eyes wide opened.
They had been doing this for years. Running after each other and failing to catch each other. Both their teams being more and more determined each time even with all the failed attempts to stop the other.
"It's not working." Castiel gritted.
"Everything alright?" Dean shouted from his car.
When she saw Dean, she trotted towards him. Castiel was exhausted and seemed disappointed that contrary to him, Dean had no problem with Baby.
"Right..." Sam knew something else was going on but he wasn't going to insist. Dean didn't want to speak right now.
Castiel had to hurry up if he didn't want someone else to die and now was the perfect moment. Castiel had finally found the shapeshifter’s hiding place, a sewer.
The bodies were always found long after the death, and there were always witnesses that were sure they saw the victim after the date of death. The perfect type of case for Castiel. Castiel had been on this case for two weeks. After two weeks of searching, trying to find out what the creature was, he was finally going to kill it.
“Are you Alex?” The woman looked at him, startled. He should have been a little more polite, but if she knew what had happened to Sam or where he was, he couldn’t waste time.
“Will you come back?” Castiel blurted out when Dean had to go. Dean turned around, surprised. Castiel was scratching the back of his head and was looking at the ground.
A woman had been found near a lake, in a small town, dead. But they were no sign of murder or that she had been killed by some illness.
________________________________________________________________________
"Did you find anything?" Dean asked, startling Castiel who immediately took his eyes off Dean, hoping Dean wouldn’t have noticed.
"Ok, I'm going to stay. Have a nice walk!" Castiel shouted as Dean walked out the door. It was weird researching without having Dean at his side for once.
"He's still a kid." Dean chuckled. "Anyway, when do you plan to go back to the forest?" From time to time, Castiel brought Jack to the forest to pass time with the other dryads.
"Eileen!!!"
"Yes? Why?"
"I'm down with that," Castiel answered, a huge smile plastered on his face. "I'm surprised you didn't mention the Impala."
"What? I mean, yes my partner needed some more help on the case." Castiel caught himself with a smile at the officer.
Dean got out of his niece’s room, feeling crushed and exhausted. She had fallen ill, and no one had found a way to heal her. Not even Dean had been successful, even with his knowledge of potions. He had tried many things but was running out of solutions.
"Good luck." Charlie left shaking her head.
The hunter freezes, his brain stopping for a moment. “What are you talking about?”
“My legs.” Answer Ben who was still crying. Castiel de son côté was doing the same thing with Claire. Meanwhile, Anna was trying to offer a chocolate egg that she found to Claire to comfort her.
Dean turned around, excited when he heard Castiel coming.
But this time, it wasn’t Castiel who did it. Instead, there was another dryad standing in front of him. She had golden blonde hair that dropped over her shoulders.
His brother’s room was turned upside down. Books were on the floor, chairs were knocked over, and an amulet was broken on the floor. There had obviously been a fight and Sam was nowhere to be seen.
When they arrived at the motel, Castiel turned to Dean. "Do you wanna stay?" Castiel asked. "It's late."
"What are you doing?" Roy gritted, trying to stop his friend. But Walt didn't stop. Instead, he picked something up before going back to their hiding place. He was holding a leaf.
But during the ride, Dean noticed a car that seemed to have been behind them for a while. Hoping it was just a coincidence, Dean didn't say a thing about it.
_____________________________________________
"Dean! No, no, no. This can't be happening." Castiel was staring at Dean's body, not being able to move a single muscle. A sound coming from Dean's body made him grip his gun.
___________________________________________________________________________
A few days later, Dean was in town, buying ingredients he needed for his potions. And a pie. Ella was now no longer sick. Therefore, Dean had decided to offer a pie to the dryad. What was better than a pie to thank someone, anyway? He took a cherry pie, hoping that the dryad did eat fruits. He went back to the forest after putting the ingredients he just bought in his home.
"Agreed."
As he came into the room, Castiel immediately regretted it. Sam and Dean were both studying him.
"I live near the lake Sarnen. With my family."
The brothers looked at each other and chuckled at the same time.
"No problem. Claire and Ben seem happy." Dean showed the two kids who were sitting on the living room couch. They didn't said a word since the movie started.
"And it's going to grow as he does."
He took a second to grab his gun; but the moment he turned back, the shapeshifter disappeared.
Castiel shot the ghost with salt. "What was that?” he asked Dean. “That's not a regular ghost!"
"It's all your fault."
Castiel was searching for Dean, as much as it felt weird and creepy to do that. Knowing Dean, Castiel knew it wasn't going to be easy. But fortunately for him, Dean had a very recognizable car that he loved too much to get rid of the Impala.
"It's going to be all right, sweetheart." At this point, Dean didn't know if he was saying this to reassure himself or Castiel.
With a bit of luck, those stories were only stories. Some people see danger and the work of dangerous creatures everywhere. But anyway, evil creature or not, Dean had to go if he wanted to save his niece.
"Crap. What do we do if he talks to us?" Castiel asked. The two of them were in civilian clothes and his fake FBI card was in Dean's car with the rest of his stuff.
The house was small and cosy. On the living room table, there were three glasses of ale.
"A pie!" Dean grabbed the supermarket bag from Castiel's hands and got the pie out of it.
“Baby, what’s going on?” asked Dean, curious about his horse’s behaviour. “Come on, no need to be afraid.”
Castiel had explained to her how his leaves grow like hair. But in way smaller quantity.
“We aren’t getting any other information, are we?” Dean sighed. “Anyway, I need to do some research in the library. Are you coming, Castiel?”
The next morning, when Castiel woke up, the first thing that came to his mind was the fire. He had slept only for four hours as he passed the entire night thinking about Dean getting hurt in the fire.
"Hey, Castiel!" Dean said when Castiel opened the door. Behind him was a woman, who Castiel assumed was Dean's mother.
When the bell rung Castiel sighed. He had thought his first would have been way worse than this. Out of the corner of his eye, Castiel noticed Dean. Like him, Dean seemed to be on his own. Castiel got out of the chair and went toward Dean.
"Improvise, I guess." They started at the table, hoping that if they kept a low profile, he wouldn't come to see them.
“How did you know what I was?” Castiel asked him.
“Alex? What are you doing here?” Dean shouts.
"Hello? Is everything alright?" Dean called out. The figure disappeared for a second and reappeared closer.
" Charlie said.
"Oh, yes. I like this one." Castiel answered, realizing that he hadn't even been looking at the car Dean was pointing at.
"Are you sure I can borrow them?" Castiel asked.
"Thank you, Rowena. That means a lot."
“It does not look drinkable.” The potion was a dark green and smelled a little funky.
“What looks human isn’t always human,” Missouri said. “There is this new girl in town, Alex. She is staying in the tavern downtown. She knows something.”
"Shit! Castiel!" Dean put Castiel in his bed and tucked him in before running to his garden with the branches from Castiel's tree. Dean already regrew a few trees only a few times before. He tried to remember the exact steps as he prepared the branches. With the help of Charlie Dean replanted those branches.
"And for once you won't get attacked by dryads." Castiel chuckled.
"What is it?" Dean called from the motel's kitchen.
The mechanic arrived right at this moment, and both Dean and Castiel stood up at the same time. Finally, Castiel's car was brought to the mechanic's shop.
"Dean! Dean! The kid's coming!"
"Cas!" Dean dropped his sword and ran as fast as he could next to Castiel. Castiel's tree was chopped down but fortunately, Castiel was still breathing. Charlie followed him closely.
"I'm going to leave you guys alone." Charlie chuckled before standing up.
Castiel stood in front of the door, his hand raised ready to knock. He closed his eyes and knocked on the door. Fours seconds later, Castiel turned around.
“What? Close your mouth before you catch flies, Sammy.”
"Can I help with something?" Asked Cas.
"A witch. She is the only dryad witch in our forest."
Dean apologized and they went back to searching for the grave.
"Is everything all right? Dean asked.
Dean continued to try to escape when he realized that both dryads stopped talking. Hester stared at Dean for a few seconds, her eyes narrowed.
"Very funny. Now come on, help me get out of here." Dean said as held out his hand toward Castiel, a cocky smile on his face. Castiel took his hand only for Dean to pull him in the river. Castiel hit the water with a scream of surprise.
"We found some new clues. We can't disclose anything, yet." Castiel answered.
He looked a bit adorable in them and... Ok, maybe he could keep them a little longer.
“I don’t know. I don’t have an eyeball collection,” Sam said. His brother was staring at him and sighed.
"Ok, moving on! Anything new?"
After changing his clothes, Castiel and Charlie found themselves sitting next to Castiel's tree.
"Sorry for all of that...and for freaking out on you. I didn't expect your death. And even less you coming back to life."
"I'm sorry for the ball. Could you send it back, please?
"Deeeeaaan?" Castiel asked as he was finishing his drawing. The two friends were laying next to each other in Castiel's bedroom.
"Oh, shut up." Dean pushed Castiel slightly laughing along with him. Every time Dean laughed crow's feet formed around his eyes. To Castiel, it was one of the most beautiful sights he ever witnessed.
Castiel was laying in his bed. He had been unable to sleep for the last three days. At this point, his family must be organizing a search party. And at this point, he was getting too much attached to the brothers. He couldn't not care. Especially Dean. As much as he tried to avoid him he couldn't stop thinking about him. It became harder and harder to ignore Dean with every day that passed. At least he was gone this morning to see however this Bobby was. He had insisted that Sam finally have a new horse. Especially because of their new case. On the last one, they captured a vampire, who gave them a track on the vampire alpha. Alphas were the first of creatures lineage.
They were hunters. He was in the same house than hunters. If Castiel stayed too long is family will come and there will be carnage. He should have taken Dean's proposition and leave. But now it was too late as he knew what the brothers did for a living. It would be suspicious if he ran away. And what about the sigil? The book he had been reading was laying in front of him, on the table.
"Amazing, Castiel. Can I take a look?" One of the hunters he worked with asked. He could hear the hunter call the others and talk about the book and what to do with it, but he was starting to zone out. Right now, thinking about how he could call Dean and if it was a good idea seemed better.
"What?" Castiel said, realizing he hadn't been paying attention this entire time. Dean was looking at him, concerned.
Dean got off his horse and made a sign toward Castiel and Alex to follow his lead. Castiel glanced at the woman next to him. She looked like she wanted to run away as she observed her surroundings warily.
"Are you all right?" Charlie asked, her eyebrows frowned.
Gathering his bravery, Castiel opened the door in one swift movement.
Dean sat beside Castiel and smiled at him.
_____________________________________________
Surprisingly, they slowly started to speak about their lives. Dean had a hard time getting an answer to some of his questions. He did learn that Castiel wasn’t very close with his family, at least.
"Castiel, I'm sorry for what I did, but..." Dean started.
Castiel followed Dean around, listening to him comment on every car they passed. It was rather endearing. Dean would critique details of cars Castiel wouldn't even think about. He had chosen his old car because he liked how it looked and it worked.
"What's so funny?" Castiel asked.
Until he opened this book.
_______________________________________________________________________
Dean grabbed as many ingredients as he could. He passed the next few hours working on potions to help Castiel's tree to grow back. And he added another to ease Castiel's pain.
Behind him, Castiel looked completely lost. Dean realised that he had probably never stepped foot in a place like this. The crowd, the laughter and shouts coming from everywhere, and the strong smell of alcohol was too much for him.
Castiel wrote something again, but this time his hoof was shaking. CLOTHES.
"Well, I say we get out of here as soon as possible and never come back. What do ya say?" Dean whispered as soon as the officer left.
“Sam’s horse passed on a case. He needs a new one.”
" Castiel answered.
"I would like a cheeseburger and a fruit salad, please," Castiel said to the server. "I love cheeseburgers," He added to Dean while looking at the table.
"Did you find anything interesting?" Castiel asked.
“It’s not a joke! You captured a horse. You captured a wild horse instead of buying one from Bobby! How are we going to train it?”
"Him?"
"Someone looks happy. Good news?" Dean asked him, grinning. Castiel winced at that; he didn't want to spoil the surprise.
"Castiel. How do you know I was here?"
"I am!" Castiel stopped and sighed. "I'm sorry. It's just, I wish things were better. I'm useless right now."
So the creature was indeed a dryad, and Dean had hurt him. Dean was going to have a hard time being forgiven. He flipped through the pages of the book, searching for what to offer this dryad. But there was nothing.
“I was not very hungry,” he said as he stood up and headed toward the door.
A few dryads were already there, fighting off those people. Some of them had bruises and were bleeding.
This was a hunter.
________________________________________________________________________
"I was searching for you. Am I bothering you, guys?" She asked, visibly confused and looking at Dean who was staring at the floor.
“What is going on?” She asked.
"All right, all right. I'm coming." Dean crawled next to Cas in the bed. He cradled him in his arms and put his head on Castiel's shoulder. They passed their time in bed together, before Dean fell asleep.
"Wait!" Castiel heard just as he was going to enter the classroom. He turned around and saw someone coming from the other side of the corridor.
Castiel took a look at Dean who was trying to stay awake. They were so close to their goal, and it wasn't some stupid potion that was going to stop them.
A week later at the same hour he first saw Dean, Castiel stood in front of his home, waiting for his Dean. Last time he didn't think to ask Dean his address. Now, not knowing how to find Dean, Castiel could only hope that he still wants to play with him.
"Of course! Why?"
As both of them shivered in the middle of the forest, Dean got a crazy idea. Before he could stop himself, Dean asked Castiel.
"Castiel will be all right, sweetheart." Rowena chuckled. "But he needs sleep and some rest."
“Wait, you are a witch? I thought witches were rare among humans.”
“I am sorry. I did not think you would come back.” A silence feels between them. “Is your niece better?” The dryad asked.
"Dean?" Castiel said as he woke up, still a bit groggy.
" Castiel replied.
“Dad, I’m bored!” Ben shouted.
” Hester shouted. Dean observed the two dryads arguing, while he was trying to understand what they were saying.
It was a sunny Wednesday afternoon when they first met. Like often, Castiel was playing alone with his bee plushie in the garden. He had the plushie for a long as he could remember. He brought it everywhere with him, except at school. Castiel's mom had assured him that stuffed animals went to their school for stuffed animals at the same time as kids. And that's why he couldn't go to school with his bee plushie.
“Thank you,” he said while passing by Dean. Following Sam, Castiel acted as normally as he could until he could get out. Soon, hopefully.
Dean couldn’t follow him everywhere and force him to talk. The only problem would be Sam. He would never stop teasing Dean if he knew what was going on.
He would have to break it to Cas at some point, would have to tell him about how the spell worked. He just...didn't know how yet.
"I'm fine. Sorry. Let's do it again."
“Hello? Can you put me down, please?” Dean tried.
When Dean came back, a log under his arm, Castiel wasn't back with the matches. Dean put the logs in the fireplace and went to find Castiel.
"I have no idea what's going on," Dean answered. "Let's hurry up." Castiel and Dean grabbed their shovels again and continued searching for the grave.
This news felt like a punch in Castiel's guts. He couldn't imagine losing his mom. He couldn't imagine how Dean was feeling right now.
How the hell? Castiel came out of hiding, as careful as possible.
"I'll be fine. Just no talking right now, please." Dean said, his eyes not leaving the road.
"Dean? You haven't seen each other since I stumbled on you in the cave. And you seem stressed lately." Castiel sighed, looking at the ground.
Castiel couldn’t see Dean and Impala anymore. One of their newfound activities was exploring the woods. Castiel would transform in his horse form and Dean would ride Impala.
“What are you doing here, son?” Bobby asked, smiling.
"An old book of magic."
"You don't choose your friends well."
Like the day before, Castiel glared at his food like he wished to kill it.
"I'm so sorry for that, Dean."
"Wait, Castiel! Don't!" The last thing Castiel saw and heard was the werewolf attacking him and the sound of a gun.
"Good morning," Castiel greeted him. "I don't know what you like, so I got some fruit and a pie."
Castiel thanked him, profusely.
"Sam almost broke the bathroom door." A woman chuckled, that Cas recognized was Eileen.
When the week was finally over and Dean could go back to see Castiel, he picked a few books with him. As he arrived in the forest, Dean called for Castiel. He looked around, in case Castiel appeared out of nowhere again.
"Sure. Call me when you're ready." Castiel let Dean lead him to another room, blush the entire time. Dean closed the door behind them to make sure the woman wouldn't hear them.
"This is a nice place," Dean murmured to Castiel.
Castiel stood back, observing and hiding behind a wall. He didn't know if this new person was a potential enemy or not.
However, after doing that, he started getting better. It still hurt him when he thought about it, but he was getting better and better as days passed.
_____________________________________________
On Impala’s back, Castiel was having a hard time staying stable. He had never ridden a horse nor thought about doing so. At least he wasn’t alone on the horse, or he would have fallen a long time ago. What had happened in the last twenty-four hours was unbelievable. How had the hunter discovered that he was a kelpie? And how was he still alive?
“Hello. How are you? I’m sorry I hit you with a book. Is this any way to greet your dear brother?”
"You know what? Cas can explain better what is going on than me. Cas?" Castiel took a deep breath before entering the living room.
But at that exact moment, light illuminated the corridor. Dean was standing in front of the door, holding a lantern.
The group was living in a castle that was three hours away on horseback. After this explanation, Dean had insisted that the young woman show him and Castiel the way.
"Well, there goes discretion," Dean grumbled. He headed towards the potion, giving his gun to Castiel. "God, I hope this works," Dean said, looking at the potion with apprehension before drinking.
However, if his theory was correct, everything would make sense. Finding him in the stable, naked under a horse blanket, and his large knowledge of the supernatural. The closer he got to home, the more nervous he became.
D, Demons, Dragons… Dryad!
"Dean?" He called again when he didn't see Dean. He searched around the motel room, calling for Dean. But he quickly realized that he was alone. Castiel grabbed his phone to call Dean just to hear Dean's phone, still in the motel room, ringing.
"Shit!" Castiel ran towards where the shapeshifter used to be. To his surprise, he realized that someone else, probably a hunter, was already fighting with it.
"Nice to see you again." Charlie moved next to Dean after managing to knock out one of those men. She grabbed his arm and stopped him. "Go take care of Castiel. He needs you."
"Dammit." Castiel groaned. "I think it would be wise to take out the weapons first. This would not be the best time to get arrested."
“I have no idea. I think Sam was already gone when I began to flee.”
"Is everything okay?" Castiel was frowning at Dean, trying to figure out why he seemed off.
Once the fire was started, Castiel and Dean sat in front of the fireplace, covers draped around them. From time to time, Dean kept glanced at Castiel as discreetly as he could. It was weird to see him in his clothes. Not that he was complaining.
As Dean told Castiel the story of how his little brother, Sammy, manage to escape the hairdresser and went back home on his own, Castiel noticed a discreet smell. The smell was barely perceptible and Castiel was having trouble figuring what it was and where it came from. This scent was recomforting and calming, with a hint of sandalwood with spices. And for some reason, it seemed to come from Dean.
He told them is parents are retired hunters as a reason why he knows so much about the supernatural world. But Dean was sure it was because he is a creature, probably a kelpie. A bit after the last time they talk he decided  He should tell his brother about it. But it would certainly end Cas being hurt or even worse. His death.
Well, never mind. Time to improvise.
"Oooofff, someone's happy to see me."
________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________
"Almost done," Dean said as he was helping Castiel band his injuries.
He would never have expected that, finding a family and a loving, adoring partner. When he thought of that, the thought of going back to his old life never even crossed his mind.
"Ummm, hello. You are Dean, right?" Castiel asked. Great first impression, Castiel. Awkward as always. Dean turned his head toward Castiel and smiled before answering.
One of the trees almost fell, to Castiel's disappointment.
"I know, I know. And I don't want you to come to visit me before you give birth." Rowena told them. Dean and Castiel nodded in sync. They had to admit that she looked slightly scary, her eyes slightly glowing purple as she told them that.
"Ok, that's creepy. Cas...for the love of God, do something." Hearing that, Castiel snapped out of his trance and shot the ghost again.
"Nothing interesting." Castiel sighed. "Just an article that summed up what we already know." Dean sat down next to Castiel and grabbed his computer.
"You saw something interesting?" Asked Roy, behind him.
Except for Sam, Bobby and the Harvelles, no one was interested in what he thought or felt, anyway.
Castiel and Dean were leaving the house, weapons in hand.
However, there was nothing. Nothing could indicate that this was a trick.
“You are the only person I know who is a morning freak,” Dean grumbled at his little brother while he put assorted fruits into his and Castiel’s bowl.
A week later, Castiel was finally moving to Dean's dorm. Like Dean predicted his ex-roommate didn't care at all if he had to move or not. Moving with Dean seemed like a breath of fresh air. They quickly moved Castiel's belongings. He didn't bring much anyway.
Thankfully, his brother wasn’t here or he would have teased him about giving his horse a pet name.
"Castiel? Who is Rowena exactly?"
Walt and Roy were sitting behind bushes observing the two men. One of them not being human.
“Sam! We have a problem!” He could sense the other man struggling, but he didn’t care. They will have a lot of questions for him.
"Wait, do you even have a place to keep them?" Asked Dean, when it was time for him to go. For his only response, Castiel pointed to his tree.
As soon as his parent accepted, Castiel jumped up and down happily and thanked them.
Once inside, he froze. The horse. He was nowhere to be seen. Instead, there was a man with brown, almost black hair and blue eyes, curled up under a horse blanket.
"Slow down, sweetheart. We have to ask his parents first, alright?" She told Dean who nodded reluctantly. "I hope we aren't bothering you," she said, this time talking to Castiel's mother. "Dean wouldn't stop talking about Castiel and kept insisting that he had to invite him."
"It's okay, don't worry about it," Dean answered. He had also changed into dry clothes. "I have some logs outside. Just wait a few minutes."
"Are you trying to insult me?" Dean asked, laughing even harder before getting splashed in the face by Castiel. They could have continued for hours but every minute that passed the water felt colder and colder. They got out of the river with a few difficulties, their clothes heavy because of the water.
But today something changed. Dean had hit Castiel in the arm in a shootout. His team was cheering at the small victory. Castiel had escaped again but this time weaken.
"Because it's the first day, I am letting you in. Next time you are late you will stay outside. Now go sit down and stop perturbing my class." When Singer started his class again Castiel hurried towards an empty seat and got his stuff out as fast as he could. He looked around him, to see what the other students were doing. He was already late, no need to also be lost.
Dean and Castiel decided to do some research in Castiel's motel room.
"I will think about that. Leave me alone, please."
“What’s going on?” Dean asked, after a day of watching his husband not concentrating on anything.
"Oh, hello officer," Dean said.
"That's what I tried to tell you! If you’d listened to me, it wouldn't have happened!" Castiel shouted. "Why would you even call a ghost that probably murdered people!"
“Let’s go,” Dean says, walking towards the dining room, not caring if the other man follows his instructions or not. Still not fully awake, Castiel tried to keep up with him. Sam was already there and had obviously been eating long before his brother woke up.
"I am sorry, I have to finish some work," Dean told Cas.
Dean went back to the Impala, looking at everything in the photo. But, something in the rear mirror got his attention. The same blue car that he’d seen earlier was parked close by. A man was getting out of it, heading towards the entrance of the gas station.
"All right, sweetheart. See you tomorrow." Dean said before kissing goodbye to Castiel.
“I hate you,” Dean grumbled, curling up on the couch.
Dean and Castiel were walking into a car dealership. They had finally gotten every paper they needed, both real and fake. Castiel was walking behind Dean, pensive.
"Is everything all right?" A waitress suddenly asked him. Castiel simply nodded, hoping she would go away. Castiel slowly ate his food. He wasn't getting anywhere and had no idea what he was going to tell Dean. But he had to do it.
“If he doesn’t have clothes, then he doesn’t have a home or food. We should let him sleep here.”
"We didn't know what kind of spell it was until I got hurt on another hunt. I healed immediately. It was great in the beginning until it backfired."
A few days passed and Dean could finally go back to see Castiel. Castiel had asked him to go for a walk around the forest the next time they saw each other. To which, Dean instantly accepted. During their walks, the forest was empty except for the animals that would run away when they heard Dean and Castiel. Castiel knew this place by heart to every single last little corner. He and Dean passed near the river where Castiel often swam in the summer with the other dryads.
"All right. Do you feel better at least?"
“Ok. You should go back to your room, then,” he said. When they arrived at the end of the corridor, Castiel turned back to observe the sigil.
"Then what was it?" Roy asked him. This had been going for a few minutes now, and Walt just wouldn't stop talking about what he saw.
Dean walked towards Castiel - slowly, cautiously -  and hugged him. "Hey, everything's gonna be all right."
Dean waved goodbye to Castiel from the Impala. Castiel waved back from his own car and smiled at him before starting his car.
Castiel chuckled, remembering Dean talking about how every single ingredient in his lab, his eyes wide open.
________________________________________________________________________
“Are you okay?” Sam asked after a few minutes, breaking the silence.
“Dryads have weird ways to say hello,” Dean grumbled, still lying on the ground. Hearing that, Castiel chuckled as he helped Dean get up.
"Nah, you can stay. I like having company." They decided to visit the town. It was a small country town with a little art museum that they decided to check out. They talked for two hours in the museum, which was too long for this small museum and neither of them had any idea what paintings were in there, since, instead of paying attention to the paintings, Dean and Castiel had talked to each other the entire time.
"Dean, no need to panic." Castiel chuckled. There was a silence, Castiel didn't know what to say. "You remember the cave?" Dean nodded a small blush appearing on his face. "Am I crazy to believe something was going on? I mean between us?" While he was saying all of this, Castiel was avoiding Dean's gaze and picking his clothes.
"Will they listen if you explain what's going on?"
When the Winchesters went back home, with a fully healed Castiel, someone visited them: Gabriel, Castiel’s older brother. He had heard about his disappearance and decided to find him before the rest of the family. It would have been nice, except that he arrived during an intimate moment.
"And I have your jar." Castiel picked up the empty jar laying next to his tree.
“Possible. A demon or a witch could have caused that. It could be a lot of things." Dean groaned.
“Dude, are you even listening?" Dean chuckled.
Dean took them and gasped when he realized what it was. "Castiel, where did you find this? If this is a joke, it's not funny."
They continued to talk about everyday life. Castiel decided not to tell Dean about this newfound smell and tried to forget about it. Unfortunately for him and Dean, Castiel's mom called him back home two hours later. They promised each other to play again as soon as possible.
“I swear, I am.” Dean nodded, hoping the dryad would believe him. The dryad came down the tree and moved toward Dean. He stared at Dean for a few seconds like he was examining him, trying to know if he was being honest or not.
Dean is in the library, again. He had to know if his doubts on Castiel were founded. Speaking of which Castiel entered the library at this exact moment.
"We'll never be able to buy this. Even if we used fake credit cards." Dean leaned towards Castiel and replied.
"Oh, right Castiel." He said as he remembered the events of last night. He hadn’t put the gun under his pillow last night. He hadn’t felt the need for the first time in a long time. Dean put this thought aside and walked into the small motel's kitchen.
"Hey, Dean. Nice to see you again." Castiel said.
“Holy shit! Don’t do that!” Dean shouted. “You are going to make me have a heart attack if you continue.” Where did the dryad come from? He wasn’t there two seconds ago.
As he got off his bed, he remembered their guest, who was sleeping in the room next to his. It used to be their parents who had rested there.
The voice called again, (seemingly) closer than before.
"A little bit. But I barely have any energy." Castiel put his head on Dean's shoulder and closed his eyes.
"Murderous ghosts are the worst," Dean complained.
"Crap!" Castiel heard Dean shout in the distance. "I'm coming!"
"Ok, no more calling the ghost," Dean mused aloud.
"Cas, I already invited you in and gave you some of my clothes." Dean put his arm around Castiel's shoulder and drew him closer. "I can assure you that you aren't bothering me."
” Castiel begged Hester.
"You should be able to take your car back this afternoon, sir." The mechanic told Castiel.
“Finally! I was about to make sure you guys were still alive.”
Dean was giving Bobby one last embrace before going back home. He had thought a lot about Bobby’s idea. If asking Sam was the only way to talk to Cas, then Dean would ask him. The only downside was that Sam would never let him forget his feelings for Cas.
"Would you like to come play with me?" The boy blurted out, taking Castiel aback.
The next day, Sam found Dean asleep on his couch. The night before, Sam had had to insist that he went to sleep instead of staying at Ella’s bedside.
Castiel was falling asleep, a wrapped gift on his lap, as his parents drove back home. Dean's birthday was coming, and Castiel had dragged his parents to the mall to find the perfect present for Dean. Castiel couldn't wait to offer his gift to Dean and see Dean's smile as he unwraps it.
_____________________________________________
“I made it. I own a potion shop.” Dean answered, grinning when he saw Castiel’s dumbfounded expression.
"Dean, there's a gas station. We could stop here."
“He seems to be trained already. He let it happen.”
3 years later:
"I'm not going anywhere, I promise. I like you too." Dean said with a huge smile. Castiel smiled back and they went back to their drawing.
"How is the investigation going?"
"I'm fine, I'll survive." Dean continued to drive as well as he could. Dean tried to concentrate on the road in front of him, repeating to himself that he is going to heal anyway. Castiel aimed again at the car and shot.
Seeing Castiel like this, Dean felt a terrible weight on his shoulder. But that didn't matter, right now. Dean gripped the steering wheel tighter and started his car. The entire ride was silent.
The next morning as Castiel woke up in Dean's bed, he turned around, Castiel turned around to check if what happened yesterday wasn't a dream. He smiled when he saw Dean snoring next to him. Castiel moved closer to Dean who slowly opened his eyes.
As Dean walked into the forest, he took out a pendulum to help him find the best tree around. He focused on the surrounding trees. Although any ginkgos could work, Dean couldn't take any risk. The forest was large and flourishing; the light passing through the branches, illuminating the entire forest. Dean could hear a variety of noises coming from birds and some animals that he couldn’t identify. After a few minutes, he stopped before one tree. It wasn’t taller or larger than the others. Nor did he have fruits. But there was something about this tree that drew Dean towards it.
"Goodbye, sweetheart. I'll see you as soon as possible." Dean told the Impala, right before he and Castiel left it in the hiding place they found.
"I feel like I’ve been trampled by an elephant," Dean said before going into another coughing fit. "I hope the potion is worth it." He grumbled.
Once the hunter couldn’t see him, he threw the clothes to him. A sound like bones cracking resonated behind him. Grunts of pain that almost made Dean turn and check if Cas was fine followed it. The hunter closed his eyes and waited. He tried not to pay attention to the noises without success.
And so was Dean.
It was for this reason that Castiel was again riding Baby while holding onto Dean so he wouldn’t fall. He still hated it. Riding in front of them on her horse, Alex was showing them the way. She could easily lead them into a trap but it was their only chance, and Missouri must know what she’s doing.
She had been brought to the Alpha and he had asked her to destroy the sigil in exchange for her liberty. Of course, she had accepted the offer as soon as she heard it. As a result, the vampires had entered the Winchester house to kidnap both brothers. Since she did what she was told to do, Alex didn’t have any news about the family that kept her orthe Alpha.
Dean looked around, lost. He didn’t understand what to do. This wasn’t a usual case. He didn’t have the time to sit down and search in books which monster was behind it. He wasn’t sure if he should trust Cas but he had no one else.
"What the hell are you doing?" Roy asked him.
“Thank you very much.” As Dean went back home, hope was coming back. He put himself to work right when he arrived home. He couldn’t waste his time. This potion took him time and was tricky to realize. It took him a few hours; but when he finished it, Dean felt relieved. This time, he was going to make it. The potion was going to work, and he was going to save his niece.
Dean cleared his throat, making Castiel turn his head towards him.
Dean approached the tree, looking back and forth between Castiel and his tree.
Castiel concentrated on the tree's roots, trying to find the source of the sickness, imagining the tree getting better, him (almost kissing Dean).
"Let me just clean the mess I made in the potion lab. I broke a potion."
"Oh, right!" Castiel grabbed the knife he was carrying and gave it to Dean. "Here you go."
“I love you too,” Sam chuckled
"Yes, sweetie. So, what do you have here?" Rowena pointed to Castiel. She was a redhead with a thick Scottish and was wearing longer clothes than the two other dryads.
But, Castiel didn't listen to him and instead limped towards him, a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.
“What the hell!” Dean shouted as he turned around. The dryad had somehow appeared next to him. He was in his tree, his face at the height of Dean's.
The first thing Dean noticed when he woke up was a door closing and then the smell of fresh food. Making sure not to alert the other person in the room that he was awake, he reached under his pillow for his gun...which wasn’t under it as it should have been.
“What are you... I can’t understand you when you’re like this. Just fucking change!”
Castiel ran out of his house to tell Dean the good news, his plushie still in his hands. When he saw Castiel came back, Dean reacted with the same glee as Castiel.
"Noticed anything?" Dean asked.
“How did you get in that stable?” he asked in a harsh tone. “Why did you enter it? Did you want to steal the horse?”
“You’re right, Sammy.”
Right at this moment, Castiel's phone rang.
Dean grinned at him. That was kinda cute. "Castiel, you remember the cop we saw at the police station?" Dean asked, all of the sudden.
Castiel, ready to shoot, watched Dean dig the ghost’s grave.
"Do you need help?" Castiel asked.
When Dean woke up Castiel had his hand in his hair and was staring at him.
________________________________________________________________________
“You thought I wouldn’t notice my key disappearing?”
Castiel was observing the man, or more accurately the shapeshifter, from afar, waiting for the right moment to lodge a silver bullet in that asshole.
Dean took a quick look at Castiel, who seemed to be on top of the world. The last time he’d seen Castiel that happy, he left him. That wasn't going to happen again.
"Dean! Calm down, it's me, Castiel!" Castiel screamed. Dean met Castiel's blue eyes and immediately let go of his arm.
"Hey! Rude! I like it!"
"Let's go back to the car," Castiel said, ignoring Dean's question.
Ben was almost dragging Dean to where they were supposed to meet their neighbours. He thought that his dad was walking way too slow. The giant egg hunt had been the idea of Charlie, Dean’s neighbour and best friend, and her wife Gilda. They had a young kid, named Anna who was two years older than Ben. When Dean and Ben arrived in the park where the egg hunt was organized. Kids were waiting impatiently for the hunt to begin. Meanwhile, their parents were talking together next to the benches that were au fond du parc. Charlie ran towards Dean hugged him.
"Do you want to see my bedroom?" Dean asked. Castiel's eyes widened. Dean asking him to come to see his bedroom was one of the last things he expected. Not that it bothered him. Castiel agreed immediately.
Dean stared at the inscription for a few seconds before it hit him. He was naked when Dean had meet him. Interrogating Cas in his birthday suit under a horse blanket, again, is not on Dean’s bucket list.
"Should I be jealous?" Castiel asked. He had been watching the scene, trying his best not to laugh.
"Of course, you can. But come back before dinner, ok?" Castiel's mom told him.
“You’re going to tell us what you know.”
On their way to the tavern, Dean was telling Cas everything he should know about taverns. The hunter was hoping that they would find this Alex girl as soon as they arrived. They had already lost too much time. The tavern was full and Dean was looking around trying to figure out  if any of the people inside were Alex.
"We will have to tell him at some point. The earlier, the better." Castiel's mom said.
"I need some information on someone. On a hunter, specifically."
“Do you know where Sam Winchester is?” Castiel asked afterwards. With that, Alex turned and bolted out of the tavern. They looked over at each other, Castiel seeming embarrassed by his mistake.
His happiest childhood’s memories were in this house. Once, on his birthday, his uncle came back with a black foal. He had shown Dean how to tame a horse and taught him how to ride one. To this day, he was still riding Impala.
“I know you are desperate to find Sam but it is not going to work if you’re drunk.” Cas sighed as he put the two glasses on the table. That sentence surprised Dean. Cas had ignored him for three months but he obviously cared for him. He did want to drink, but Castiel was right.
"You should come to see my tree. It blossomed now that I am pregnant."
Dean was sitting in front of Castiel, not knowing what to say. The fact that Castiel may be pregnant was the last thing he expected.
"I'll take this as a yes, then." Castiel grabbed and made a paper ball out of the copy of the spell, and threw it over the wall of flames with his phone as best he could. They fell to the ground on the other side with a dull sound.
The last three months had been odd. Dean couldn’t find out why Castiel was ignoring him after Dean had prompted him to talk. If he wanted Dean to ignore that he was a creature, why now? After assuring Bobby that he was fine, his uncle gave him a look of disbelief. Dean couldn’t hide him anything.
“They are. Ben woke me up at six am this morning because he couldn’t wait to go egg-hunting. I hope Claire didn’t give too much of a hard time.”
But now they were looking around the house after hours of fighting the coven.
"I know what I saw!" Walt answered. "And this man wasn't human!"
"He often accidentally breaks stuff." A young girl added.
He was admiring the view when he heard another horse galloping in the distance. Dean was smiling proudly, believing that he had won. The moment he saw Castiel, his smile faltered.
"Dean." Castiel looked down. "I didn't use it."
Dean put his head in his hand and groaned.
Dean grabbed his bag as well as he could, opened it, and pulled out a small jar to hand to Castiel. "Throw it," Dean said. "Emergency potion." He explained.
As he walked around town, Dean found a little coffee shop. He decided to enter it, as hunters didn’t usually have much time for nice things. He ordered one coffee for him and one for Castiel.
"That was painful," Dean groaned.
"Castiel. You remember there was a fire last night?" His mom asked. "We learned this morning that the house that was on fire was Dean's."
Once he arrived, Dean put the horse in the empty stable. Giddy, he went searching around for Sam. He found him, reading a book as always.
"Fair enough, fair enough. Okay, I’ll take you back to your crappy motel, now?" Castiel nodded and Dean started the car. The rest of the ride was completely silent, Castiel looking out of the window.
The figure called again.
"Yes? Wait! It's not like that!" Charlie roared in laughter when she saw Castiel blush.
“She’s out. Alex leaves the tavern every morning. She only comes back late at night. If you want to talk to her, you’ll have to wait a few hours.”
"I'm sorry, I'm not sure that I'm following," Sam told Dean.
Both of them stood there, simply smiling at each other. There wasn't any need to talk right now.
Castiel was thinking of how to answer when he heard a couple speaking behind them. He managed to hear about weird disappearances in the town.
"Here you go. Be careful, please." Dean told him as he handed a gun from his glove compartment. Castiel grabbed it and aimed at the wheels of the car behind them.
Castiel relaxed in Dean's arms and rested his head on Dean's shoulder. "Thank you, Dean." They stayed like that for a few minutes, taking advantage of each other’s presence. Eventually, they reluctantly separated and looked around the motel to make sure they were safe.
But he couldn’t leave Castiel there with no monitoring. One part of himself was telling him that Cas came to see him of his own free will. He wouldn’t need to attack Sam if he wanted to hurt him. Sam trusted him. The other part insisted that Dean would put himself in great danger if he didn’t keep an eye on the creature. The first part won, though he didn’t put his sword away.
They were on their own and were heading in the unknown. It wasn’t the first time the Winchester brothers had been separated. However, for Dean, it was the first time he was hunting with someone other than his brother.
"She seems to have died from lack of oxygen but there isn't any sign of strangulation on her neck."
"There are matches in the lab Thanks," Dean answered with a smile.
One morning, Dean was woken up by Castiel shaking him and calling for him.
Castiel and Dean looked at each other, not knowing what to do.
“Then why don’t you go back? They must be worried.”
The entire way home, Castiel was keeping the gift close to his chest, hoping that everything was going to be alright for Dean like his dad said.
Castiel, still chuckling, walked into the room behind Dean. It was one other small motel with nothing special distinguishing it from the other ones.
After four hours of travelling, Dean had finally showed up at Bobby’s house. It was his and Sam’s second home. When they were kids, they would pass their time here if their father was on a case that was too perilous for them.
She had never met him before. Maybe Dean and Sam told her who he was during their case, but she had also answered his question before he had even asked it.
"Well, let's choose then."
_____________________________________________
"When was the last time you had a good night of sleep?" Castiel asked.
"Dean? What’s wrong? I've only been gone for a minute."
“Hello, Dean.” Said Castiel when he noticed Dean.
“Yes. I came to thank you for your help. I’m Dean.”
"We would like to see the house before we decide anything," Dean said, taking Castiel's hand, making Castiel blush. Castiel stared at their hands fascinated. "Right, Jimmy?" Dean asked Castiel who kept looking at their hands. "Jimmy?" He continued, giving him a slight nudge and startling Castiel.
"We lose those fuckers, and then we..." Dean sighed before continuing. "hide the Impala."
“Sure thing.” He said and nodded, a smile appearing on his face. Castiel returned the smile, and his gaze followed Dean as he got out of the forest. When Dean got out of sight Castiel wandered towards the deepest corner of the forest. He wanted to pay back, Dean.
“Dad! Dad! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! It’s time to want to go egg-hunting!” Shouted Ben.
"Where do you live?" I mean before you got in our house?"
"What?" Can asked, taken by surprise.
“You looked terrified.” Castiel chuckled as Dean laughed along with him. Indeed, he hadn't expected to end up like this or to stumble on a dryad.
"You all right?"
“Hey, are you feeling better?” asked Dean. For only answer, the coffee exploded in his face.
"Wait, here! I think I found something!" Castiel's voice startled Dean, who had started to fall asleep.
_____________________________________________
“Castiel woke up.”
"I fucked up," Castiel said his head in his hands. "Dean you should sit down with me for that one."
"It's going to be alright, Cas." His das answered with a small smile.
“What’s a pie?” Castiel asked. The moment Dean heard that he stopped what he was doing, his jaw-dropping.
"Well, I didn't expect that... But I can work that."
"So you prefer sacrificing yourself than having other people living this life?"
“I promise,” Dean answered.
“He said his name’s Castiel. I found him in our stable. Oh, and the horse is gone.” said Dean, enraged, pushing Castiel in front of him.
"Would you want to go to my home? I have a fireplace, there." Dean immediately regretted asking, ready to hear Castiel reject him. But instead of that, Castiel stopped what he was doing and blinked at him before smiling.
"Oh, and it's a boy."
“My family.”
"I can't. I have to see Rowena check if I am indeed pregnant." Castiel sighed. "Maybe tomorrow?"
Dean and Castiel passed the two next hours talking together. Until Castiel bluntly asked if Dean wanted to go on a date. They both stared at each other, surprised. Castiel never thought he would ever be brave enough to ask Dean out. Dean said yes.
"Thanks," Castiel said as his smile grew bigger.
Hesitantly, the stranger smiled and said, “Hello?” That was enough to get Dean out of his stupor.
Dean sighed and recounted what had happened. He omitted some details and changed others. Bobby knowing about his suspicions regarding Cas being a creature could cost Castiel his life. If it were someone else, Dean would have denounced him as soon as he was aware of it.
While Castiel was preparing the ingredients, Dean had been watching through the window in case anyone came searching for them. He had been sure those hunters wouldn't find them and they’d finally gotten rid of them...until he saw three cars heading toward them. "Fuck! How the hell did they find us?"
"Dean? Hey, Dean, wake up." Dean heard as someone was shaking him.
Castiel was helping the brother more and more in their cases. He was starting to become a bigger part of their life. Dean had been watching him from the end of the dining room where he was chatting with Sam about the difference between pureblood werewolves and the one who was bitten.
"Charlie, what are you doing here?!" Castiel asked, standing up as fast as he could. The redhead was standing in front of the cave's entrance, her arms crossed.
“I don’t remember,” he said, panicking a bit at the thought of Sam and Dean noticing the lie. Even if I wasn’t his first lie, he was still sweating.
“Dean...” sighed Sam. “You sure you don’t remember a thing?” Castiel nodded.
"Good luck with him. Mine doesn't seem to care about what I do as long as I leave him alone." Castiel and Dean talked all the way to their dorm. Castiel was quite surprised when they arrived at his dorm. It had gone way too fast.
After a few moments of exploring the cave, Dean and Castiel sat down, leaning on the wall. They stayed there next to each other, in silence for a few minutes.
"You wanna hum... Sit down?" Castiel had no idea what to do. His first plan hadn't work and he just destroyed his second one.
"Be careful," she said.
"Just that some people disappeared without leaving any trace,"
Castiel followed him and climbed onto Baby’s back behind Dean. He was gripping the other man’s waist tightly. If he wasn’t on a horse’s back, he would have felt embarrassed by it and, even if he would never admit it, pleased. But right now, the only thing he could concentrate on was not falling.
Rowena and Dean helped Castiel to lay down as he groaned, pain shooting through his body.
“What do you mean by that?”
Castiel and Dean had decided to pretend that they were a couple, Jimmy and Michael Milton, searching for a new house.
Sam and Cas turned their heads towards him, confused.
"Hey!" Someone shouted from the other side of the garden's fence, startling Castiel. Looking at him was another boy his age with green eyes and freckles all over his cheeks.
"We'll always be friends, right?"
"I'm sorry." Shocked, Castiel froze He must have heard wrong.
Castiel had just fallen asleep when a loud noise woke him up. Someone was shouting and it sounded like a fight. When he realized that it was Sam who was shouting, he knew he had to get out of the house as soon as he could.
"Where are we going now?" Castiel asked with a smile after they both climbed into the Impala.
“You wouldn’t have gone very far suspended upside down.”
The sound of a siren rang, breaking the silence inside the car, woke up Castiel. Lights of a fire truck danced on the windows of the car.
Dean was only mad at him about Sam’s kidnapping for a few minutes. They were finally approaching the village and Castiel was relieved. The torture would soon end. It was the first time Castiel had seen this village.
The hunter lifted his head and looked at Castiel. His blue eyes were filled with worry. “If he is still alive,” he answered as the bartender served them their ale.
When he came back, he noticed that Cas was still in the same place.
"Noooooo, five more minutes, please."
They had also changed a few things in the house. Like in the bedroom. They got a new bed and Castiel would alternate between sleeping with Dean and in the tree.
"Apologies accepted. You want to come in?" That was the worse idea he ever had. He is an idiot. Dean seemed as shocked as him that Cas made that offer.
The clothes he had given to Cas were discarded on the floor. When he saw the blood on the floor, the hunter dreaded the worst.
"What??? You should have woken me up earlier! We have to work!"
Dean seemed weirdly passionate about pie. Castiel had to admit that it was delicious. But it seemed to be a religion for Dean.
"It's not starting," Castiel groaned.
"Do you have siblings?"
Written on top of the page was: Immortality. And in the middle: Cure.
Dean got off his horse, picked out a harness from his bag, and tiptoed towards the black horse. Straight away, it turned it’s head and observed him. It had vivid blue eyes, an unusual feature for horses, which made it even more prized.
“You came back.” The dryad said.
The ghost was staring at Dean, without moving.
They stared at each other for a few seconds.
" Hester shouted.
“Chocolate’s eggs! Chocolate’s eggs! Chocolate’s eggs!”
On the way to his home, Dean looked behind him. The new horse was following without protest.
Castiel was sure he’d seen him somewhere.
Alex hadn’t lied when she said the entry was old. It was a tunnel covered in the dust where they couldn’t see a damn thing. They were following the walls and holding onto each other so they wouldn’t fall or get lost.
“I just gave my clothes to a guy we found naked in the stable, what do you think?”
After he had eaten all his fish, half of his bread, and a few vegetables, Castiel asked. “I’m sorry, but can I get back to my room?”
"Ok, mom," Dean complained before going to the bed.
Castiel looked behind them. There were only three other cars behind them. But one of them was driving particularly fast.
"Where the hell are you Dean?" He muttered. Castiel peeked from behind the wall to see if it was safe. Seeing no one, he continued walking down the corridor and sent another message to Dean to ask where he was.
"Mom! Dad!" Castiel shouted as he ran back inside, startling both of his parents. "Someone threw a ball in the garden, but it was an accident, so it's okay. Can I go play with him? Please say yes. Please, please, please!" Castiel looked up at his parents with his best puppy-eyes, his plushie squeezed tightly against his chest.
"I don't know, but it may be important. Look, we have been waiting for an opportunity to make money for a long time. This may be it."
Dean left, coming back to his house as fast as he could. The moment he was back home, Dean grabbed as many books as he could and started his research for a solution. After hours and a lot of books, the only thing he found that could help was a tree called ginkgo. The leaves were told to have healing properties and could even extend their life span. Fortunately, there was a forest not far from Dean’s house. And Dean knew they were ginkgos in this forest. However, they were a problem. Numerous stories surrounded this forest. Legends said an evil creature was living there. A monster that terrified those who dared to enter its lair. Some people said it was a demon or an evil spirit. And those who saw it always had a different story. Sometimes the creatures were made of wood, sometimes had horns. But one thing that Dean knew was that no one saw it coming.
“Wait, you wanted to leave? And you stuck around for the food and bed? What conditions do you live in?”
They were attacking some ghoul when Sam’s horse got injured. It collapsed, and Sam almost got the same treatment. Because of that, Dean was riding his horse, Impala, on his way to get another one for Sam.
It was a miracle, one of them was injured but they could get out of there without all three of them being stuck on one horse.
The dispute continued while Dean was trying to escape. But being upside down, Dean was feeling worse and worse.
"And you are suddenly interested in potions?"
_______________________________________________________________________
“Castiel! Not again!”
“Here we are,” Dean said as he raised his hand to knock on the door. Right before he could, the door opened and Missouri appeared.
Dean fell to the ground, trying not to groan from the pain. "The potion is working. Not in a good way."
Silently, he opened his door and took a peek into the corridor. He tried to understand what was happening and if he could help Sam with whatever was attacking him. Suddenly, the noises stopped and six people emerged from Sam’s room.
with only a note, after all.
_____________________________________________
"For what?" Dean frowned. All of what he did was let Castiel get hurt.
Dean saw Castiel shaking next to him. "Let's go back inside." Castiel nodded and Dean helped him stand up. [Inside, Dean found a note written by Charlie.
"Hello, yet another crappy motel," Dean said as soon as he stepped into the motel. And now they were sitting in front of a computer, trying to find anything that could help them in this hunt.
"Oh, shut up!" Castiel mumbled, hiding his head in his hands.
“Fair enough.”
“Dean, we already talked about that.” Started Sam.
But instead of Castiel appearing, Dean found himself hung upside-down from his foot, again.
There was, in the small town, a market where peddlers were shouting to attract potential customers. Castiel was mesmerized by all that agitation. It was the first time he had been here. It was the first time he had been to any sort of human town. His family had avoided humans as much as they were able.
"Can you give me the ginger powder?" Dean asked. "Cas? Castiel?" He said after a few seconds and then realized Castiel wasn't listening. He was leaning on the wall and was looking at Dean, a smile on his face.
Reluctantly, he left the room and stared at all of the doors in the corridor. Which one are the witches behind? Putting his ear to the door closest to him, he listened for something, anything.
Well, Castiel does know about a short-cut, not that he would ever admit that to Dean. He was still rambling about how Castiel must have cheated until Cas put his snout on Dean’s head to shut him up.
"Listen! How about we make a deal?" Castiel shouted, still behind the rack pallet. "We finished the spell. We're not going to hurt anyone, I swear. Unless you force our hand."
Dean tried to grab his glass so he could ask for more alcohol. But he couldn’t find it. “Where is my glass?” Castiel’s glass had also disappeared, and then he saw the other man’s hands under the table. “Cas? Why are you hiding the ale? You’re not that discreet.”
"Is this the psychology classroom?" The stranger asked.
“Jerk!” Sam chuckled.
_____________________________________________
"Uh, that's weird. I thought a neighbor was making an apple pie. I love pies. You should come to my home one day, my mom makes the best pie." Dean said, making Castiel grin.
They followed her as quickly as they could despite the bewildered looks of the tavern’s owner and customers. They were losing her in the market’s crowd when Dean jumped forward and grabbed her by the wrist.
"Not the only seed he planted,” Rowena commented.
"Come in." He said, putting his hand in his pocket and gripping the dagger.
Like a few days before, he found Castiel’s tree again. Something was drawing Dean toward it. Somehow he could recognize this tree among all the others without problems.
"Sure, you can go." Castiel's mother told him. He and Dean both cheered at the same time before running out of the house. Dean grabbed Castiel's hand and dragged him towards his home. He couldn't wait to show all of his toys to his new friend.
Next to him, Castiel groaned in agreement.
Dean didn't answer but grumbled under his breath. "Do you have a plan at least?”
"Hello, Dean." Castiel had regained a few colors but he still looked sick.
Castiel sighed as he finished getting dressed. It would be nice to have a place he could call home, but that won’t happen anytime soon. He searched around him for anything that could help him get out of the home as discreetly as possible.
"I just want to see if the spell worked."
"What?"
"I'm so sorry, Cas. I wish I could have been at your side." Dean sighed.
Before going out, Dean took his bag and opened it.
"Sorry, can you repeat that? Zoned out for a minute."
And Castiel’s only brother, Gabriel, had run away from their home a few years ago. His parents, however, hadn’t paid any attention to them most of the time. They were too busy with keeping their home safe so no hunters would be able to find them.
They took their retirement after years of Dean helping citizens and Castiel being chased by the police. Everything was going well. To some entente). Normal life was not that easy and how do you tell your ex-team that you have been dating and are to your enemy for years. But aside from that everything was alright. Until Castiel kept zoning out all day long.
"Dean? Dean, wake up." Someone (murmured), waking Dean up. He was laying, face first, on the ground. A baby gurgled next to him. A baby! His baby! That was enough to fully wake Dean up. He sat down, Castiel was looking at him, a soft smile on his face. He looked exhausted.
"Ingredients for every occasion. It took me some time to get there." Dean opened another drawer and got out a box of matches.
“Dean? We are going to find Sam.”
Once on Baby, Dean cast a glance at Castiel. He would never forgive himself if the kelpie didn’t wake up.
The next morning, Dean was walking to the stable where the new horse was, saddle on his shoulder.
Before Dean could call do anything, the dryad appeared behind him, once again.
Castiel’s head snapped.
"I swear to God if it ends up like the last times," Roy muttered.
"Thinking back on it, your face was hilarious." Dean laughed but stopped immediately when he saw Castiel glaring at him.
"Right... You have been away a lot lately." Dean froze. He hadn't talked to Sam about Castiel. What was he supposed to say anyway? Hey, this is my boyfriend Castiel, he is a Dryad. Oh, and he might be pregnant! The normal things.
Dean and Castiel were standing in front of each other, neither of them knowing what to say.
"I am sorry. But it's not every day that your friend finds himself in the corridors only wearing his boxers." Dean had a hard finishing his sentence as he was shaking with laugher.
“Here? A lot, but not every tree has a dryad attached to it. Our job is to protect the forest and animals living here.” Castiel answered. “And what about you? How did you find that potion?”
"Do you have an idea of what you want?"
“No. I am sorry, she is still sick.” Dean sighed. Sam slumped back to his chair in defeat.
________________________________________________________________________
“We don’t know if that was his intention.”
Sam stared at his brother’s face, attempting to find any confirmation that he was lying. A mischievous grin, a mocking glance. None of that. Instead, he looked delighted with himself.
________________________________________________________________________
"Nice to meet you." Dean shook Charlie's hand.
"So, what information do we have for now?" Dean asked.
"Do you have a plan?" Castiel asked, still shocked by what just happened.
There was a window on the wall in front of him, so Castiel approached it and grabbed onto the handle. However, the moment he tried to open it, he could feel his hand burning.
“I woke up there, naked, so I fetched the blanket and you know what happened next.”
_____________________________________________
"Caaaaassss."
-Four years later:
"Hey, I'm not going anywhere until you get your car back. I mean unless you want me to go." He could stay with Castiel for a few hours.
After that, both of them stayed silent, Castiel reading his book and Dean leaning on Castiel.
"How hard was it?"
Castiel listened as Dean tried to explain what was going with the forest and about the dryads. When Dean started to talk about him, Castiel crossed his fingers, hoping that everything will be all right. From what Dean told him, his family should be accepting.
"Yes, umm, sorry about that."
"You're sure you want to buy this house? It has an awful past. And there have been rumors..." the woman looked around her, before continuing "that this house is haunted. A few people have already left the house, terrorized, and never came back."
"No, it's okay. Let's just take care of the werewolf and go back to the motel, please."
