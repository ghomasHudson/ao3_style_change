'I can’t do this, Sam’, he said one day to his brother, 'I just can’t. I can’t even think about this. If this thing… If this… Whatever you all are doing… If this eventually doesn’t work out, I am not sure I am going to be able to survive this. So I just… I just can’t help you with this’.
But now. Now was different. No, in a way it was the same. But at the same time it was different. Because by some unimaginable way this time was worse. Much worse. He always thought that it was impossible for something to be worse than what happened the night Jack was born. Castiel’s death three years ago was shocking, unexpected, sudden and fast. This time? Oh, fuck.
Well, this whole thing is at least worth a try. If he doesn’t find him, he will simply stay here. He had nothing left to lose anyway.
'Where’s the portal’, Dean said again, through his teeth, eyes still closed.
So, each day they buried themselves in the books, spells and lore, working as hard as they could to find anything that could help. Occasionally they caught a glimpse of Dean’s shadow on his way to the kitchen or bathroom. Sometimes Dean even stood in the library’s door for a minute or two and stared at them with a bottle is his hand, like he was anticipating. All they could give him was a reassuring smile. At the beginning they tried hugs, but Dean never let them touch him. It was like every touch hurt him. Little did they know, everything hurt.
'Cas. I am real, okay',  Dean finally managed to say, and he swears it wasn't supposed to sound that sad and desperate, 'And we have to go. We have to go’, he repeated, 'I— I don’t know how much time we have left, I—’,
Oh, God.
Sam only nodded in agreement, desperate to get Dean out of his room, but at the same time understanding that if they don’t find a way to open up the portal to the Empty, then all he was doing was giving Dean false hope.
you find him', he corrected himself, 'Cas might be a little out of it. He might have trouble with believing that he is not dreaming. So just... Be prepared for that.'
, like he was a blind man who suddenly was able to see for the first time in his life.
The voice was coming from a distance, muffled by the rain and the wind. It was dragging him back to reality, and Dean didn't like that at all. He wanted to drown in the rain or go up in smoke, he didn't care. It was annoying and Dean felt the anger rising up in his chest.
Dean blinked and then closed his eyes.
; the dumb, self-sacrificing idiot in a trenchcoat, whose absence made Dean’s life completely numb and pointless and unlivable. He wanted to run to him, to wrap his arms around him and never let go. He was shaking more than ever, but somehow managed to take a first step towards the light, and then the next one, and the next one, and one more.
made that rustle, somehow. But then he heard it again, and this time he didn’t even move a single muscle. He didn’t even dare to breathe.
Like he was witnessing a dream coming true.
But again, Cas wasn’t '
"Then what is it, Dean?"
"Say it, angel," Dean spat, "-what am I going to do to you?"
"I don't think so. I don't think dad would want me to live like this."
"Are you sure it's wise to call me
It feels nothing like Dean expected. Gentle yet firm, reassuring but uncertain to some extent. Eager and insistent.
Castiel didn't need anymore telling as he surged up and wrapped his lips around Dean's throbbing, pulsing cock, and began to suck. There was not much skill, and he was sure he accidentally grazed a tooth over Dean's cock, but Dean didn't seem to mind as he pushed Castiel's face down his cock, almost choking Castiel, who could do nothing but swallow the cock being shoved in his throat as tears stung his eyes.
Sam banged his head on the cold, hard, wet shower tiles.”I was just showering and was thinking about our date. That’s all,” Sam said, not even convincing himself.
“Yes,” Dean mumbled just loud enough for his husband to hear as he finished up with his tie. “How do I look, hon?” Dean turned around.
“What do you want Gabe? I hate to say this but, your wish is my command,” Sam said.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sammie, I know I’m gorgeous but uh you ever gonna kiss me or am I just a pretty face to look at. Do I need to get someone else to fulfill my other needs?”, Gabe said. He knew how protective Sam was and he knew he was pushing Sam’s buttons with that simple phrase.
“So what did you ask Sam about?” Dean said.
Suddenly his phone rang. “Hey Dean listen uhh things aren’t uhh looking good here. Can you have Cas send Gabe here?” Sam asked.
In response, Gabe handed the garment to Sam. Sam went pink when he saw it. It was a pair of bright pink panties.
After two more orgasms and a cold shower later, they were finally getting dressed. Dean made Cas get ready in another room cause he wanted to surprise his angel.
When Sam woke up next, they were right outside the bunker. Gabe was nowhere to be seen either.
“Yes, listen to Sam. He knows everything, “ Crowley sneered. Gabe rolled his eyes at Crowley. He held out his hand towards Sam.
“Dean, what are you doing?” Cas asked, confused.
“Hey, can we get three of your best crepes?”, Dean said, lightly drumming his fingers on the counter.
Sam felt his cheeks heating up. He got up and went over to where Gabe was sitting on the edge of Crowley’s bed. Sam put his pointer finger under Gabe’s chin and his thumb over it. Sam’s thumb gently rubbed the angel’s chin, softly forcing Gabe to look up at him. Sam bent down so that he was level to Gabe and pressed his lips against Gabe’s. Sam pulled back only to push Gabe’s hair out of the way and responded, “Yes,” Sam said. Gabe couldn’t believe it. He had a date with the man of his dreams. Gabe was so excited that he almost burst out of his vessel. “Woah, you ok? You almost burnt my eyes out there, Gabe,” Sam said.
“You may. C’mon let's get out of here before you lead me back to the bed. But, before we go, do you have the key?”
“Oh yea. Sorry. I just zoned out for a bit.”
“Gabe, what is that?”, Sam asked, crossing his arms and pursing lips
“Heya Sammie, how’s it going?” Dean said.
“Relax Cas, I’m just going to shower. Then we can cuddle until we sleep. How does that sound?” Dean asked, undoing his belt.
“Well, before the wedding, I was going to ask you to go on a date with me and then ask you to go to the wedding with me. So, I wanted to practice my wing-massage skills and so, I practiced on Cas. Dean thought that Cas was cheating on him with me the first time. Cas said I had natural ability though,” Sam remarked, smiling happily at the memory. Gabe felt jealous. Why should he? He hadn’t been dating his Samshine then. Cas even had a boyfriend at that time. “Gabe? You ok? You look like you want to rip someone’s throat out,” Sam inquired.
And all of a sudden the darkness fell, almost darker than it was just moments before, and Cas was no longer looking at him; his eyes were empty and his body was sinking to the ground as Lucifer slowly pulled out the blade, smiling, like Dean’s world didn’t just excruciatingly exploded like a supernova, brighter than anything else for a split second, and then just gone forever, leaving a starless night sky all around him and a black hole that he instantly felt he was falling, no,
The thought made his heart beat faster. Blood was pumping through his veins and he was suddenly starting to feel alive again. He blinked and tried to focus, steadying his breath. Cas.
Cas was looking directly into his eyes, anticipating.
'Dean—’
, laying in the mud and thought that no, not like this, he has to get Cas somewhere, anywhere from the dirty ground. Still in complete shock, he managed to grab Castiel’s body and slowly, cautiously, lift him up. The trenchcoat was wet and dirty and smelled awfully, and Dean was barely able to get up and stand on his own two feet. His vision was blurry, and one thing he was sure of, it wasn’t because of the rain.
, he cursed himself,
'Dean, I—’
, echoed in his head over and over again like a mantra, like a spell, like a curse. Cas’ eyes, more blue than ever, looking straight into his own.
'You’re not
Because he did. It was the last thing he saw before he woke up in a coffin, what seemed like forever ago. It took him a second to recognize it, but once he did, the feeling of familiarity and safety surrounded him completely and all he could do was stare at the figure getting closer, and closer, and then all those feelings were replaced with just one — the long anticipated feeling of relief.
Dean looked at his watch, confused.
'I heard what you said. And now we need to go. Understand?’
This wasn’t the first time Cas died, obviously.
'What is happening?’, he asked quietly, and suddenly there was absolute silence. Everyone looked at Sam.
'Yeah, sure’, he muttered, and stepped inside.
to be in
But Castiel was staring at him like he just received a revelation, like a man lost in the desert who saw an oasis after
'Cas’, Dean’s voice broke. There was a million things he wanted to say, to scream, a million speeches he imagined himself saying to Cas if he ever saw him again, but all that disappeared the moment he saw the familiar face. 'I’m here’, he managed to whisper, 'You're here', he added, and saying this out loud felt like the weight of the world fell from his shoulders, like just for a moment he was finally free.
Dean spent that night in the room with Castiel’s body. He remembers laying him down on a couch and covering his body with blankets. He recalls Sam trying to talk to him, but Dean didn't want to talk, to be honest he wasn't even sure if he would be able to speak a word if he wanted to. Thunderstorm of emotions and feelings was pounding in his head making it hard to breathe, so he did what was familiar. He grabbed the first bottle that he found, chugged it down as fast as he could and passed out on the floor, right next to the couch. It wasn’t like he
He shut his eyes, held Cas closer and tighter, buried his face in Cas’ hair, wet and damp, and started crying.
, the answered echoed in his head.
'Cas?!’ he cried out once again. And again. And again. And again, and again, and again.
Dean was still staring at him blankly. After a moment he exhaled, looked around and tried to get up without a word, still holding onto Cas. Everything was dirty and slippery, and ugly, and dark, and wet, but Dean had to stand up, he had to carry Cas inside, had to take care of him.
‘Dean. Dean, hey—’
But there was still nothing to be seen.
, Dean thought.
'Dean’, Cas didn’t let him finish, 'Are you even real?’ he added quietly and softly.
!’ Cas broke free from Dean's grip and stop walking.
He didn’t know when he started to run around, more and more desperately, but it was dark, it was so dark and his voice was completely scratched from yelling, and it was cold, and there was no Cas, and he was all alone and—
He looked around but all he saw was, ironically, nothing. The silence was actually calming, though. He wouldn’t mind staying. After all, one thing he was sure of — Cas was there, somewhere. It was a reason good enough for him to stay. Cas.
'What?!’, Dean cut him off, blinking away the tears, 'Why?!
'Where is it’, Dean whispered.
Dean didn’t want to, but he remembered it all. Three years ago he was kneeling next to Cas’ dead body, watching helplessly as the first raindrops started to wash away the trace of burnt wings on the ground. He couldn’t believe what just happened, what he just saw. He doesn’t quite recall how long was he kneeling there, but by the time he snapped out of this overwhelming feeling of disbelief, shock and helplessness, he was soaking wet.
'Yes, Dean’, Sam finally said, 'We are sure.’
Dean found himself staring blankly around him, like he didn't recognize where he was, like he was looking for an answer or an explanation written on the bunker’s wall. His phone was buzzing, but he barely gave it a thought. The whole world might as well just end and disappear for all he cared; his own world was just taken away from him seconds ago (or was it hours?), so why, why should he give a damn if the planet kept on turning or not?
. 'We need to go’, he said instead with a voice that was supposed to be confident, but came out brittle and broken.
'I…’, he finally grunted, 'I am not sure if you want to hear this’.
And what he just
Although it was only the second time it felt truly permanent.
His voice, his breath and his hands were feverishly shaking. Hope was rising in his chest, only to be replaced by anger, anger by fear and fear, again, by hope.
C. S. Lewis
It’s been some time since they got rid of Chuck. It included Amara and Michael and all the strength they could find. To be quite honest, all the events just mashed up into one big cloudy memory for Dean. He felt like he was existing on autopilot all this time. Bottom line though, they got rid of the omnipotent bastard, got back all the people who disappeared…
'I know', Dean answered.
, look. Cas, look at me’, he cupped his face, so he could stare directly into Cas’ eyes. 'Not this time. We had that conversation, remember? In purgatory. And that conversation is over’, he said, maybe a little bit too harshly. 'Although there is another one that is not over. Far from over, actually’, he added more softly.
After some time, they finally got a breakthrough. At the beginning they didn’t tell Dean, but things finally started working out and the spell was ready in no time. Jack and Charlie were just high-five'ing each other, and they were all about to discuss the plan and who is going to get through the portal, when Dean appeared in the door.
The ground was slippery and boggy and Dean was desperately trying to focus on every step because the other option was falling down, and that meant Cas would once again end up in the mud and this was just too much to think about. One step, two steps, three; towards the house. The sound of torrential rain was deafening but it was a good thing: at least Dean didn’t have to listen to his own thoughts.
'Do it. Now’, Dean’s eyes were now piercing through Sam. He looked determined enough to do anything, but at the same time he looked beyond tired, like he was on the edge of collapsing into himself like a house of cards.
'And Dean… Remember. It stays open for an hour’, Sam said, unsure if Dean was even listening to him. But Dean was, in fact, listening, the thing though? He couldn’t care less. If he gets stuck, he gets stuck and stays there. It didn’t matter. His life lately wasn’t much different from what he was seeing right now in front of him.
Well, almost all.
'Ready?’, Sam’s voice was uncertain and a little shaky. What they were about to do was risky and probably stupid as fuck, but—
A figure surrounded by light composed of every colour he ever saw. He had to squint his eyes; the light, albeit beautiful, was blinding.
It was hardly the first time he ever had to move a dead body. It was always awful and generally hard to do. Moving an inert body took a lot of physical strength, and Dean was no stranger to it. Holding Cas though… This was some whole other level. The weight of Cas felt heavier than any other thing he ever had to carry, and that includes that time he carried Sam all those years ago, right before he made a deal that eventually lead to this.
He remembers clearly as he looked at Cas’ vessel, Cas’
'What if it doesn’t work?’ Cas said quietly and closed his eyes. When he opened them, they were full of tears. 'Something always goes wrong-'
He shut his eyes tighter and took a few breaths.
'Where’s what?’
and sucked into.
Everyone looked at each other, not daring to say a word.
And then he saw Dean.
'Are you sure? You found a way?’
The scene of an angel blade ripping through Cas right in front of him started replaying itself over and over and over again; Cas’ blue eyes, looking directly at him, suddenly became full of light, and in the next second the blue, celestial light was everywhere, and it was bright and blinding, and Dean’s eyes were burning but his whole body was paralyzed and he couldn’t stop staring at the one thing he hoped he would never have to witness ever again.
‘Dean!’
'What now?’, Dean finally stopped to look at Cas. Castiel looked like he was just chewed up and spat out by a cow, but once Dean’s eyes landed on him, he just couldn’t stop looking.
Dean felt blood rushing to his head; he suddenly was in a fight mode once again, starting to feel everything all at once - the anger, the fear, the pain; like after weeks of being numb his mind decided to unleash every emotion a human being can possibly feel. The familiarity of that question was terrifying and he didn't even dare to think about it's implications. He remembered what Sam told him.
How long did he stay like this he doesn't know, but in those moments time didn't matter; nothing really mattered, as he was weeping, feeling more broken than he ever felt before, smaller and more helpless than ever, surrounded by this all-consuming merciless blackness that smelled like dirt, and smoke, and fire; and suddenly he was 4 years old again and he was watching his house go up in flames; he stared at it with wide, innocent eyes, he watched as it was burning brightly, as tongues of fire danced on the roof and escaped through broken windows and seemed to demonically laugh at him and at his life that was going up with smoke right along with the house; but he didn't know it back then. By morning his childhood was turned to ashes, just like the house, just like his mother and just like Castiel's wings.
"So, Castiel," Dean started. Castiel noted how his hand lingered at the small of Castiel's back even when they were outside. Something inside him fluttered with pride. "-Jimmy Page or Eddie Van Halen?"
"Of course, as expected, we emerged victorious. However, the ambush is not what I'm here to speak to you about."
The world as it is, remains unchanged. The snow falls. The birds chirp. The trees sway. The wind blows.
things from him, lying to him,
Dean's fist loosened, and Castiel's toes touched the ground when Dean let him go, as he turned away, his eyes staring passively into the distance.
"Bye."
he prays,
Burning hot, thick semen flooded Castiel's ass, one load, two loads, three loads— it seemed unending as it filled Castiel's stomach.
"Oh really? I thought you said I was an angel."
"It must have hurt."
That voice.
"I can't do that," Dean says after a pause, and although the answer doesn't surprise Castiel, it prompts another tear to slip down his face.
"I gotta’ leave, Cas."
A soft, pleasant breeze of air stirred through the room and kissed their skin, and Castiel let his eyes flutter shut as his head fell against Dean's warm, comforting chest.
"Dean, calm down. We'll get to the bottom of this, alright? Cas is going to be alright–"
we settled this already, man. Three months. You said you wanted to see New York and I'm sure these two months have been more than enough. You were supposed to move in at the end of December, but now you're moving in a few days early. What's wrong with that? You should be happy that you’ll get to live in your own house, in the
"To turn it into an even beautiful place," Dean whispered against his ear, and pressed a kiss to his neck, away from Garth's eyes.
"It's called— uhm, give me a moment."
Sloppy and soaked with spit, Castiel pulls his mouth off Dean's cock, after having bobbed his head and licked his tongue around Dean's cock with much enthusiasm and fervour, and he gazes up at Dean once again, with his bright blue eyes, and Dean feels his resolve crumbling as he cups the side of the prince's face. Castiel leans into the touch and nuzzles his face against him.
Castiel falters, mouth hung open as he steps closer to the wall, hands lowering, as he leans into where he supposes the knock sounded from. "Hello?"
They remained joint together for a few minutes, Dean's large, painful cock lodged inside Castiel's hole, but then he pulled out, and chasing after Dean's cock, came his thick, hot white semen, gushing out of Castiel's ruined, gaping hole. The come dripped down to the floor and dribbled down Castiel's thighs, but Dean swiped a hand through the mess, pushing and fingering his come back into Castiel's loose, wide hole.
How he twirled, and his short, low-cut French maid outfit twirled with him. It looked gorgeous on him. The black button-up blouse with puffed sleeves and a white, lacy hem; a tiny, black frill skirt which opened up every time Dean's catboy bent over to pick something up, only showing Dean a clear display of the boy's round, pert, plump ass clad in a thin, sheer lace white pantie which sunk into the crack of his cute, lil' ass; a tiny, white lacy apron tied around his waist, and the best of all, his slender, tanned hairless legs covered in sheer, black netted thigh-high stockings. Paired with his cheeky, mischievous black tail and the cute, black and pink cat ears sprouting out of his gorgeous head, Dean's catboy was a rare, beautiful sight.
"M'sorry, Dean, please, don't hurt me, I'll leave if you want me to, I know you think I'm disgusting, and that I'm—"
"No— not at all."
Somehow, Dean wants to spoil him. Wants to keep him close, wants to smother him with kisses and drown him in affection.
Green goes pin-drop silent.
"Dean."
and a certain hesitance laces his words.
Somewhere within his heart, Castiel wanted to thank the Lord for his love. But ever since Dean had given up his faith, Castiel couldn't find it in himself to keep his own. It would be nothing but treachery for his husband; utter betrayal— despite Dean having repeated, multiple times,
"Oomph–" Castiel grunts, and his hands clutch at Dean's back tightly, eyes squeezed shut, as they regain their breath, Dean's eyes fluttering open to meet Castiel's, and a beat passes between them. Heavy. Expectant. Hesitant. Waiting. Castiel's face pinkens under Dean's gaze, but never budges away.
Now, standing there before Castiel with the knife twirling between his fingers, Castiel couldn't help but notice how strange Dean's green eyes were.
, Dean prays,
"You're actually playing for me?" Castiel asks, eyes wide in disbelief as he stares at a mundane spot on the wall.
"And so Orpheus, heart-broken and grieving, decided to travel to the land of the dead. To the underworld. To Hades, to bring back Eurydice, because with her death, not one, but two souls had entered into Hades. One being her own, and the other Orpheus's. Or so goes the metaphor."
"Green? I've never seen anyone with green eyes before."
Dean's self-restraint melts away at the sound of those words, and without another thought, he slides his hands under Castiel's chest, and embraces him from behind, folding his arms over the prince's chest and stomach protectively as Dean kisses the side of Castiel's head, and pants into Castiel's ears. His hips move on their own accord, snapping back and forth, and his senses lose comprehension as he feels the tight, wet heat of Castiel's insides wrap around his cock, constructing his cock and sucking it in.
3.  God
Dean lifts his head and finds himself staring into the vivid blue of Cas’ eyes.  “The thing to do?”
So he stays in the kitchen, cooks his burgers and drinks his beer. Bobby comes in and offers to take over so he can be with the others, but Dean waves him off. “I don’t trust you people with my burgers, man.” Bobby makes small talk for a minute, but soon gives up and just grasps his shoulder with a sad smile before rejoining the party. Jody’s in not long after that and starts prepping tomatoes and lettuce and onions. Doesn’t say anything except hey and where do you keep the good knives. Dean grabs his hunting knife off of the table, flips it in the air and offers it to her handle first; Jody gives him that motherly shame-on-you look she’s perfected since she took in the girls. He shrugs and puts the knife back on the table with a smirk. Sam floats in and out, grabbing drinks for himself and the others, making brief comments here and there. The only consistent company is Miracle, gnawing on a bone and basking in the heat pumping out of the vent, and he’s perfectly content with that.
1.  Castiel
Dean has a cowboy kink.
“What d’you think, Cas?”
Cas’ worst nightmare is coming to life before his eyes.
Dean Winchester is not the type of man that is easily scared.  He hunts demons and monsters and all things evil, after all; not much room for fear in that line of work.
It doesn’t take long for everyone in their little group to find out about their… relationship, if you can call this unorthodox thing they have going the R-word.  And Sam doesn’t care that his brother is apparently into guys too, or that he’s dating one of their mutual friends, or that he’s with an Angel of the Lord or fallen angel or whatever he is now (which makes it interspecies, maybe?  He shoves that thought away with all his being and vows to never go there again).  He really doesn’t.  But Dean is still his brother, which means that when they get all gooey-lovey-dovey, it’s just GROSS.
Dean clears his throat and lowers the blanket, then sucks in a sharp breath when he feels Cas’ arm drape across his shoulders, and a hand warm on top of his..  There’s a bewildered look on his face as he turns to the former angel, but Cas’ eyes are transfixed on the TV.  “Uh.  Cas?”
“Damn it, Sam!” Dean slams a hand against the edge of the car. “You keep saying we, like this is a team effort. It’s not, Sam. This is on me. Cas sacrificed his life for mine because I fucked up. I went after Billie without even thinking it could be someone else, because I had to do something and because hunting and violence is all I know. Daddy’s blunt instrument. That’s why Cas is gone, and I can’t just let that go.”
“Carry on” echoes around him as they toast. Dean downs the remaining half of his beer in one gulp, then sets it down with a harsh clank. Sam nods and tips his glass at him. He nods in response, then looks his friends over one more time. “Thank you. For everything.” And with that, he steps away from the table and slips out the back.
They settle on an Eddie Murphy special, and that’s that.  Cas even forgives Dean and is curled up against his chest by the end of the show.
"We'll keep looking."
“And to those who couldn’t make it tonight. Crowley, Rowena, Kevin. Ellen and Jo. Adam. Mom and Dad. Castiel.” He pauses, glances at Dean. “They gave… everything. For the world. For us.” He lifts his glass, but nothing comes out when he goes to continue. His eyes meet Dean's for a long moment, then he sits, Eileen quick to grab his hand.
They manage to avoid any conversation of what happened with Chuck for a good while after they finish, and Dean is almost able to relax, almost, until Sam stands up and clears his throat. Everyone quiets down immediately.
“What’s with the tone?”  He rakes his eyes over Dean’s form.  “By the way, looking good, Dean-o.”
“Dean, it wasn’t-”
Cas blinks at him.  “What do you mean, you don’t do scary movies?”
It takes all of Dean’s self-control not to laugh out loud, but he manages.  By the end of dinner, they’ve called each other punkinbutt, shnookums, love bug, honey bunny, kitten whiskers, toots, smoochie poo, sweet cheeks, and doll-face.  Sam leaves, looking extremely nauseous, when Dean really outdoes himself with ‘big daddy.’  (Kevin gives up around shnookums and just brings his dinner into his room.  Charlie sticks around until they start making out, and would’ve stayed longer if it wasn’t for the pointed g-t-f-o look on Dean’s face.)
“Just talk to me, Dean, please. It’s okay to grieve.” He pauses. “Or are you looking for a way to bring him back? There’s no way out of the Empty, Dean. Eileen and I looked. Sometimes you gotta call it. We can’t keep obsessing and bringing each other back from the dead over and over, we have to draw the line somewhere.”
“Because it was. He’s gone, because of me. So I can’t let it go. Not yet.” Dean’s chest is heaving, his face flushed. His fists clench and unclench at his sides like he’s fighting the urge to punch something. His throat aches around the lump that’s lodged itself there.
“You called me baby,” Dean rasps.
“I’m serious though, Dean. I want to marry her.”
The grin fades to a smile, soft and proud. “You’ve got a hell of an opportunity here, little brother. Find somewhere crazy romantic and pop the question.”
interrupting their session. Simply unbelievable.
The screen goes black and a moment later the end credits, small and white, begin to roll down the screen. Dean flips his laptop shut
Castiel wants answers. He needs answers. And there is only one way to get them. As much as he loves the press of Dean's lips to his own, the flutter in his gut, and the sparks under his skin when they touch, he pushes Dean away, eyes blinking open as they stare at each other, awestruck, perplexed, incredulous until Castiel's senses kick back in.
Castiel watches her body like a hawk, how her hips hover closer to Dean, how she leans into him, how her eyes barely leave Dean except to take Castiel's order. Castiel narrows his eyes at her. It's painfully obvious how she wants Dean to notice her, but Dean, his usual laid-back self, sticks her a stiff smile. Castiel notices Dean eyeing him from across the table, but there's an itch under Castiel's skin that urges him to send the waitress a sharp look.
"I don't find it weird," Castiel smiled, trying his best to not let his voice crack, "—besides, you have Lisa now, so eat her head, not mine."
"I do."
"Hey, buddy, I'm so sorry, I need to take this call. Could you tell me more later? I hate to end our conversation like this, it's just, bank statements and what not."
And like clockwork, they meet in the middle for another kiss, until at last, Castiel pants into Dean's mouth about how close he is, and Dean lets him come, lets him splatter a thick streak of white against their stomachs, before twitching inside Castiel.
It twitched once, it twitched twice.
Castiel considers it for a moment before smiling. Stepping back, he reaches for Dean's hand as they walk into his bedroom. Castiel switches on a dim, yellow light which illuminates the room only partially, and Dean allows his eyes to wander around. Castiel’s bedroom is minimal. Book shelves on both walls, a large queen size bed, and a few paintings hung on the bare walls.
"Alright, when was this? And what went down? Was Castiel hit with a spell? I need one of you to give me clear context, don't leave out any details. Anything you
meet me.”
The elasticity between them snapped at last. Dean surged forward to press his lips against Castiel's. Castiel let out a delicate moan before going pliant in Dean's arms. His hands slid up to wrap around Dean's neck, while Dean slipped his thigh between Castiel's legs to rub it against his growing erection which strained against the lacy fabric of the panties. Not a moment after Castiel had let his head fall back, Dean was pressing his lips to his jaw and across his neck, sucking bites and nips into his tender skin, and Castiel was a moaning, crying mess against the counter, his cock leaking and wetting Dean's thigh with pre-come.
Sam sighs on the other end, and Dean can almost envisage his brother, his shaggy brown hair, the fine lines of the thirties adorning his face, the weary circles under his eyes, a contrast to the face of a young, gleaming boy Dean’s always known him as.
"'Kay, angel," he teases, earning him a groan from the man over the line, "
Another long silence, and it confirms Castiel's fear. A certain weight settles on Castiel’s shoulders, and he slumps down against the wall, stunned for a moment, completely silent.
. With a grin, Dean swipes right, pressing the phone to his ear.
Jack has mastered most of the piece, Castiel wants him to perfect it. He knows Jack is his finest student, fingers working with ease at the strings when he plays, which is why Castiel nagged him about enrolling in a state wide talent hunt, the winners of which are promoted to members of a highly respected and cherished orchestra group, New York City Orchestra.
In an instance, Dean is crossing over to Castiel, pressing his hand to Castiel's back and the other over his hips to hold him upright.
"Used some grace," Castiel answers before Dean can ask.
"Dean, it's okay—"
"You had a choice. You made a decision, Dean. So, don't regret it," he says rather sharply, and Dean sucks in a breath. "-I can't do things for you, neither can I change the decisions you make. All I can do is tell you what I feel, and leave it at that."
"No way,” he says, “-put that back right now. I took you out, this one's on me."
Blue laughs. There it is, that sound again, drawing Dean closer to a man he's never seen. Funny how a single conversation causes your mind to run wild with imagination.
A few tears slid down Castiel's face, and he wiped them away quietly on the back of his hand as he shut the bedroom door, and turned around the face the empty, palatial manor. It must have been quite a beauty, Castiel mused, back in its time. Although now, it was nothing but stony ruins. And yet, somewhere within these stony ruins, there lay something beautiful— something
"I know, I know," Castiel gasps, sinking down on Dean's cock as the hands at his jaw fall to his hips, and Dean squeezes tight, before resting his head against Castiel's chin. Castiel keeps lowering himself until he's buried to the hilt, until he cannot take anymore of Dean. And then come the shuddering breaths, the quiet moans, the heated touches, and Castiel lifts his hips, dropping them back down with a jerk, grinding his bottom against Dean's crotch, swallowing inside him, as much of Dean as possible.
do? Dean, there are less than 10% chances of me
Castiel pulls away, sliding his soft palm over Dean's jaw, thumb grazing over the dark red cut across Dean's lips, eyes following the action until Dean winces, and Castiel pulls his finger away.
A chill ran down Castiel's spine.
Dean reassures himself,
"Dean, I—" Sam sighs, a biting edge to his voice, "
"Yes, you mentioned blaming your father. What did he do?"
The buzzer rings at four-thirty p.m. sharp
"Yeah, you know what, let me go check on him," he says, and picks up his feet, walking out the kitchen and into the narrow passageway.
Last night had been a glimpse of the life he could have with Dean.
Rowena's eyes glint with something Dean can only deem as solid realisation. As if all at once, everything has made sense to her. Her eyes widen, and she presses her hands down onto the table.
"For what?"
"You know part of me hates how true that sounds,” Dean says, “
Instead of fear, however, Castiel felt himself leak more pre-come at the tip of his cock, and arousal coursed through his veins at the thrill of being fucked by a monster.
Dean already knows he plays the violin.
"What did you do, Dean?" Castiel asks, but it isn't curious, it's helpless, and Dean sighs.
and he’s leaving. In six days. That’s it.
"Hello angel," she chirps, and Dean catches a confounded expression on Castiel's face, before he croaks out a small
Rowena sighs, and slumps back in her seat. A dull silence washes over them, and for a moment, all three of them only wallow in their own thoughts, before at once, Rowena's face lights up.
"Nothing too harsh, just," Whether it was joy choking Castiel up or simply the bitter-sweet feeling of having moved to a new place, leaving everything old behind, he didn't know, but he did know he found himself unable to speak, and his words trailed off, "-I'm so proud of you, so happy, Dean, you get to live your dream, nothing could make me happier—"
Sitting at the map-table, with a beer in his hands and his eyes darting over the different spots on the map, is Dean, although he knows his face is drooping, long and sad, as he feels the familiar sound of his brother's footsteps advance towards him. A soft weight on his shoulder, Sam's hand, and Dean looks up at him, managing to fix him a weak smile.
long."
"I get that a lot. It's alright. We're cool."
The same blue eyes Dean has dreamt about in so many different ways.
"Suck, omega, and no touching yourself, or I'll zip my pants up and walk right out of here. S'that clear?"
No response meets his words, so he steps forward to continue with his day. But right as he's about to move further, he hears Dean speak, in the softest voice Castiel has heard, "I won't ditch you, Cas, promise."
"I have a surprise for you," he says.
This is it, he thinks, this is what I get.
"Like your eyes, your nose, must be something people like, right?"
Castiel to know how much he loves him. And maybe he can't say it, maybe the words dry up on his tongue, but he knows he can show it. He knows he can channel every ounce of affection inside his being into his actions, which is precisely why he doesn't pull away when Castiel's hand travels up his thigh. Dean leans in at last, meeting Castiel in the middle, and it's almost as if everything around them comes to a standstill, and the only ones moving are them— Dean and Castiel, and it happens in a split second.
Dean only nods with a jerk, and pulls Castiel into a hug, placing his hand over the back of Castiel's head, dropping gentle kisses over his forehead and hair as he squeezes Castiel in his arms. Castiel grabs onto Dean's shirt, burying his face in Dean’s calming scent, which now provides him with nothing but reassurance, as he smiles, tears staining Dean's jacket. Then he pulls away and cups Dean's jaw in his hands.
"Look, I got the rest of the collection back home, buddy. And I drove here all the way from Lawrence, 'cause I found out this was the only place that sold this cassette. Please let me have it," The alpha sighed, and his face scrunched up into something pleading and desperate, and Castiel almost smiled.
"Never."
The doors. They were shut.
"And you're staying here? With me?" Castiel asks, his voice wet, breaking with the sob rising at the back of his throat. A tear rolls down his face as he gazes up at Dean.
"What did you tell Lisa?"
Dean pushes himself up to his feet, glancing around in the darkness for some semblance of movement, when once again, the Empty speaks.
Dean stood waiting, but his other hand clenched into a fist, and at once, blood poured down Castiel's lips as he felt his insides crunch and crumble, and a loud, agonised wail rang through the empty, bare metal room as he choked on his own blood, the pain never ceasing, until a moment later, when it did.
The moment Castiel's foot stepped across the threshold of the manor, a gust of wind— cold, bleak, sharp— coursed through the door and punched Castiel straight in the gut. Something odd, something strange lingered in the air, and he reached for Dean's arm on instinct, squeezing it to call for Dean's attention. Dean paused for a moment, and Castiel turned to tell him how uneasy he felt, as if something was churning inside his chest, but seeing Dean's face, he paused. Pure, unadulterated joy was written across Dean's face and at once, Castiel couldn't find it in himself to tell him. Rebuilding the manor from the ground up, owning the credits to creating one of the most luxurious hotels of the new world— it was everything Dean could ever dream of.
Fed up with Castiel's persistent encouragement, Jack did end up enrolling, despite whining to Castiel about his stage fright. Castiel
"Sorry, I had a fight with my brother, wasn't in the mood for a few days," Castiel lied, wondering if he was a bad person if lying came to him easier than confessing did.
Castiel considered it for a moment.
A dumbfounded silence fills the air, and Dean grins smug at his argument, until the sound of a defeated sigh makes its way across.
"I don't want to move." Castiel smiles, his lips parting as he recites another quote— "
A comfortable silence lingers between them, both men basking in the high of their orgasms, in the high of being content in each other's arms, of finally being able to stop dancing around each other and having claimed what they knew what already belonged to them, and a moment later Castiel speaks up again.
He reaches his hand out, and the moment his finger tips touch the rift, he feels a surge of electricity course through his body.
"So," Sam starts, pouring out a glass of whiskey for Rowena, "-are you ever going to tell them the
"Dean, I need you, please—" Castiel moans into their kiss, and his eyes flutter open for a moment to watch as Dean's lips drag down his neck, nipping at a mark he left on Castiel's neck. All Castiel can do is thread his fingers through Dean's hair and urge him on as their eyes slip shut and Dean moves up once again to capture Castiel's lips in a soft, prolonged kiss, where he nips at Castiel's bottom lip, drags his tongue over the seam of their lips, and works his hands at Castiel's waist.
"Roll over so we can sleep better."
"This is New York, Mr.Green. Walk a mile and you'll find everything you need."
"Did you not tell him on purpose? Because of the house?"
"Huh? Why not?"
"What's the first?"
his only friend
"I guessed. Heard you leave last night. And heard that exceptional rendition of Backstreet Boys too."
And yet, years of hunting and mastering peculiar skills have taught Dean to stay vigilante, which is exactly why he pauses when he hears the softest sound of movement behind him. He doesn't turn back, not yet. He waits for the sound to call out to him, not the other way around.
"Dean, you need to watch your cholesterol." She giggles coyly, and claps a hand over Dean's shoulder after the both of them have told her their order.
The Empty laughs.
The first touch of Castiel's hands to Dean's cock is
." Sam sighs and folds his arms across his chest as he leans against the wall beside Castiel's bedroom door.
They pull back after a few long seconds to meet each other's eyes.
"Hm, a little birdie told me there's this guy next door to me who loves hamburgers. Thought I'd leave some out for him."
"I want him back."
“Oh please, it’s nothing. Your daughter is lovely, always so curious when we’re speaking.” Castiel watches as his student smiles, and teeters on the threshold of his house, shrinking behind her mother with a shy smile.
Castiel agreed with a smile. After all, being submissive was in his blood.
being with pup."
"I don't want to leave you either."
But then Castiel opens his eyes, as if having recalled something out of the blue.
A moment later, Castiel nudges Dean away, only to take hold of his hand as he turns towards the back-door of the apartment building.
Cas, with his stupid, little quotes that somehow always unfurl a warmth within Dean's chest. Cas, with his Tupperware containers, always labeled with little notes and smiley faces. Cas, with his cute, nervous voice when Dean asks him to read a poem. Cas, with his books, his endless chatter about violins and music, and his love for art. Cas, who manages to dismantle the wall Dean built within him, brick-by-brick, with every word, with every laugh, and creeps into every fiber of his being, who now, is a part of Dean's existence.
"And the last."
"Well, it's… it's a part of me, and I know that, but it's a part of me I've tried to ignore for a long time. I mean, back when I was exploring everything, I'm talking back in the nineties, early two-thousands, bisexuality wasn't really considered a real thing, y'know. You were either straight, gay, or trans. I guess I always knew I liked men, maybe not more than women, but yeah, still. But I ignored it when I was in high school. Ignored it when I was enlisted. Kept ignoring it."
"Yes, Blue?"
"Is it–" Dean gulps, "– is it curable?" He knows how meek he sounds, but he can't help but be stunned at Rowena's admission. Rowena, on the other hand, simply fixes him with a weak smile.
"Are you hanging up?" Green asks after a moment.
But Castiel doesn't sound alright. He sounds indifferent and his eyes don't meet Dean's. The word is hollow, as if he doesn't believe Dean at all, as if he's accepting a truth he

"Alpha?" Castiel asked, and rolled over onto her side, snuggling closer into Deanna's arms and into her warmth.

"Of course."
“I- I’m sorry, I was being too preachy. Sorry, sorry, I shouldn’t have said that, you don’t need to feel liable to answer—"
"I, uh," His voice is softer now, so it's harder for Castiel to listen, and there is a certain hesitance to the man's voice. "It's my first time here in New York."
Some nights, when it's just the two of them, Dean often sits with Castiel in the kitchen, their thighs pressed, and a bottle of whiskey in front of them, their face close, eyes drowsy, and breaths mingling. In moments like those, Dean finds himself wanting to be even closer to Castiel. Closer in way he's never wanted Castiel before. Closer in a way he's never wanted from anyone before.
Something twinkles within Dean's eyes, something amused and careless, and he wraps Castiel in a tight hug, until Castiel gives in and loops his hands around Dean's neck.
eyes gazed up at Castiel.
"So good for me Cas," Dean coos, smothering Castiel's face and nape with soft pecks, and lingering at his neck to leave another nibble, "-come for me baby, I know you want to."
"Men, two of them," A breathy moan escapes Castiel's lips, surprising both Dean and him, and Dean wonders what other noises Castiel is hiding inside him, "-naked and sweaty."
"What else am I?"
Dean would be big. Given his physique and his build, he ought to be. He'd be big and large and thick— and every thrust would send a wave of pleasure gushing through Castiel's body.
', she knew. Castiel had sniffled, simply smiled, and then turned away, ignoring the heart-broken, crest-fallen expression on Mary's face.
He pushes himself back up, rings the buzzer to Green's door, and runs for his life. He scrambles down the stairs to the fourth floor, pressing back against a wall, chest heaving as the adrenaline in his veins prompts him to pant. He slaps a hand over his mouth and laughs into his palm.
It's tender, it's wet, it's reaffirming, it's
"Oh, just the news."
. Not appearance-wise— the car is beautiful, extremely well maintained— but the style is old.
girl, Lisa Braeden.
"Cas will be fine. You're thinking too hard about it. Dean, please, could you go eat something? You look exhausted. Please, eat something before
"I dunno’, I usually go for home base after the third date."
Castiel can't help the shy smile tugging at his lips.
"Come on, let's bring this guy home." Dean smiled, and promptly stole a kiss off Castiel's lips, resting their foreheads together for a moment, before pulling away and stepping out of the Impala currently parked in the driveway of their little, white-picket fence suburban house in Lawrence. Castiel followed after Dean, making sure Jack wouldn't be too disturbed, as he carried him in his arms, the baby's young, tiny sausage arms wrapped tightly around Castiel's neck.
"Please," Dean breathes out, and almost on instinct, Dean's fingers tangle through the black curls of Castiel's hair. The prince blushes, before leaning forward and swiping his moist, pink tongue over Dean's sensitive tip. A moan slips past Dean's lips unbidden, and he massages his fingers within Castiel's hair while the young, little vixen continues to suck Dean's cock. There's not much technique, and Castiel's mouth is far from skilled, however, it's small and warm and wet, and for someone as easy as Dean, it's all that matters. Not to mention, the mere thought of having his cock sucked by the prince he serves for is an immensely arousing thought in itself.
Until junior year when Castiel realised he was gay, and utterly in love with Dean, perhaps he always had been, which had led to him having a breakdown in his room at two in the morning.
with Castiel adding in tips and pointers from time to time— they don't hear again from the man behind the wall. There are no noises of shuffling, or thudding, as there have been for the past few days since the man moved in, and Castiel assumes he must have fallen into a much-needed slumber.
"Top 10 hits of Celine Dion? Do I look like a loser to you?"
Dean has begun to love nights.
Dean and Sam share a look.
"Oh," Dean hummed, as if surprised, but a moment later, his fingers returned to Castiel's cock, and Castiel sighed in relied, tears spilling to the ground as his face fell against Dean's shoulder. Dean's hand soothed his back, murmuring in soft, coaxing words, "-good boy, so good for me, so good."
He doesn't know what it is— this spark flittering between them. Or at least he tries to tell himself he doesn't. But somewhere in a distant corner of his mind, he knows what it is, knows what it means when his veins thrum with excitement when Dean knocks at the wall, or what it means when his heart drops the days Dean doesn't feel like talking much, or why his chest heaves with unease on nights when Dean wakes from his nightmares, calling for Castiel from across the room.
"Ah, I got his notice to vacate last night. I wonder where he'll be moving."
"Oh, god no."
so easily. All he knows is one moment he's sulking Dean's upcoming departure, the next he's chuckling, head falling back against the wall.
"That's a cute little sticker."
"Mornin' sweetheart. How was work?"
Dean pauses and the spatula in his hand drops onto the pan. A drop of oil splatters on his finger, but he's too busy thinking about Sam's words to worry about it.
"That is quite an apt comparison, yes."
, spilling out.
Dean pauses, fiddling with the paper fork in his hands, one he was supposed to throw away a long while ago.
"Are you alright?"

man struggling with his sexuality. He’d sounded strangely hesitant about it. It's best not to ponder over things like these, he decides. He likes Mr. Green as a friend. And he wants it to stay that way.
Five days.
Dean grabbed Castiel's ass, and spread it apart, wide enough that Castiel felt the cool wind inside the car kiss his hole, but the chill of the wind was gone in an instance as Dean's finger breached his slick hole. Castiel let out a startled yelp, the intrusion strange and odd inside him in a way he had never felt before, and yet, he wanted to get as much of it as possible. He pushed back against Dean's finger, rocking back on it insistently.
"Right," He swallowed, trying to steady his breath, "-Garth told us about you. And yes, erm, I'm Cas Winchester. My husband, I mean, my mate, he's asleep."
him. It was dry— there was nothing to lubricate its way in, and the feeling of it felt nothing short of a hundred needles piercing into Castiel's skin, and yet, part of him preened at having swallowed the intrusion inside. That was when he realised.
Leaning down onto the bed, he moves forward until he's falling into Castiel's arms. A glance up at Castiel shows him Castiel has shut his eyes already, but he squeezes Dean in his arms before rolling them over until they're on their sides, Dean buried in Castiel's arms.
No one else called him
"You'll wait? For me?" Dean asks.
"I'm always going to be here for you, Cas, promise."
"No."
"I'm sorry,” he said. “I didn't really know you could hear; I would've stopped-"
"Why don't you go through the sheets? I'll tune the strings for you," Castiel suggests, and Jack hands over his violin with a brief nod. His eyes drift across the notes drawn across each page as Castiel sets the violin at his shoulder, fingers twisting the pegs, judging purely from experience.
"Sweetheart?" Castiel prompts, a stark, crimson tint flushing his face as he tries to bite back a smile.
Turns out, all it needs for Dean to bulldoze through his meticulously built wall of emotions, is the sight of Castiel's face stained with tears, accompanied with a feeble
It was a girl. Not just
The clink of Dean's belt drew Castiel out of his thoughts, and with wide, mortified eyes, he stared down at Dean's hands. Dean dug his fat, leaking cock out of his jeans, the red tip of it leaking profusely, and Castiel shivered at the thought of the thickness breaching him. He gulped, fear creeping through every nerve of his being, but somehow, with the way Dean's keen, cold green eyes stared at him, Castiel found himself lost.
"Castiel," Dean hums against Castiel's skin, nosing against Castiel's neck, and squeezes him in his arms. Castiel nudges his elbow to Dean's shoulder, trying to push him away, but Dean persists, tired of the distance between them, wanting,
"Do you always speak like a textbook?"
the positives of our situation, alright? We have a month left. Thirty days. That’s a lot. Especially if we make the best of it."
"I'd actually prefer if we didn't watch anything tonight. Maybe we could just talk. About anything you want. Play some music, maybe, is that alright?"
"Cas, m'sorry."
"Hmm, it's debatable."
"I come here to check on the kittens sometimes.” Hesitance bleeds through his voice, no matter how confident Castiel assures himself he sounds, and part of Dean is relieved at being on the same page as him. “-They're in the back, hiding near a tree."
"As in Zeppelin, Queen, y'know."
"I do in fact. I know the best hamburger place here in Hood River."
He expects Dean to refuse him, but Dean agrees, nodding his head with a jerk as he steps inside the one bedroom apartment, shutting the door behind him as Castiel steps away.
"You fucking whore. I thought you'd scream for help, or to kill you, or to let you go but no. No, the first thing you scream for is a cock fucking your cunt. You disgusting, little whore. God, I'm keeping you." Dean chuckled, and pushed his trousers down until they pooled at his ankles. Castiel's eyes lingered on Dean's fat, bobbing cock as Dean walked around to stand behind Castiel.
Castiel deserves blue skies, palm trees, sunsets and walks on the beach. He deserves hot chocolates, and snowflakes and someone to hold him tight when the first snow of winter descends upon them. He deserves picnic baskets, roses, and sweet, gentle kisses.
Castiel's eyes wander down, drifting over his ripped tank top, over his thick, tattooed arms, over a large crimson stain on his stomach, and his bruised, bleeding knuckles. Dean steps forward, and the distinct odour of blood, thick and metallic, floods Castiel's nose, and before he knows it, Dean is staggering forward, falling into his arms.
"Cas,
Dean compels Castiel to hold his gaze, and a glimmer of defiance flashes in Castiel's eyes, undoubtedly a glint of childish rebellion, before he scoffs, "-That's easy, you said I needed to start forgetting you, so I thought I'd make your job easier by doing it right then and there."
It's a call. From Mr. Green.
She'd never been the one who had to tell Castiel he couldn't stay at the Bunker, the only place he ever called
At last, both men fall back on the bed, sticky, sweaty, completely sated.
Before Dean can intrude any further, he hears a soft whimper from a few feet away, and at once, with his instinct on high alert, he freezes.
Dean sighs, eyes narrowing as he ponders over the question.
"Dean? Are you there?"
A beat passes between them, and Dean wonders if Blue has walked away, but before he can dismiss the thought, the man speaks.
Castiel sighs, and stretches his legs out, twisting his neck to massage a crick, and he mumbles in a sour voice, "Alright."
It isn't until he's in the kitchen, grabbing a water bottle before slipping into bed, that he hears a knock on the wall
"Tell me about it," Castiel scoffs, a heartless smile gracing his lips.
Castiel all but
Friends don’t lie.
Dean beams at Castiel's words before slapping the top of the car, a distinct glint of adoration in his eyes.
"Why not?"
of course they knew what would follow soon. The last few months, as much as Dean hates to admit it, had been strained. He abided to every whim and fancy of his father back in Lawrence. He cared for him for as long as one can for someone as stubborn as John Winchester. But his mind had been at turmoil, doubts itching within him every second of every day, weeks and weeks of sleepless nights, hours and hours of prolonged silences, and if by chance sleep ever did lull him away, the thunderous explosions in his memories would shake him back to consciousness.
to save her, she had fallen dead to the ground," The Empty laughs.
A strange, uneasiness lingered in the air around him, and he sighed, hands resting atop his stomach on instinct, as he stared at the door. His eyes wandered down, and he found it locked shut, not ajar as it had been a mere few seconds ago.
jacket closer to his chest to cower inside it.
"I found it rather sweet, Mr. Green." Castiel grins, a warmth blossoming across his face as he drops his gaze to his feet.
"Want my cock?"
Dean bumps his shoulder against Castiel's, and it tugs a little grin at the corner of his lips.
"That feel good?"
"I read a poem already, I think I like it."
"I see. You did do a quite sorry job of sucking my cock," Dean wonders aloud, as if to himself, enjoying covertly as Castiel's face falls, and a pout graces his lips. He almost seems ready to weep, but Dean would be too cruel if he continued this.
Castiel pulls off Dean's cock with a slurp, and gazes up at him— eyes hazy with desire and longing, and somehow dark with instinctual need— one Dean has only ever seen in
Dean is stunned.
Adopting him had taken them more than a year, what with their savings, the paperwork, the expenses, the home renovations— not to forget, the mental preparation it took to welcome a new baby into their lives— forever. But they'd persisted through every hardship. They'd fought tooth and nail beside each other, and even in the lowest of times, they'd remained determined, and now here he was, the absolutely adorable, puppy-eyed little Jack.
"I love you."
It's only been a bit since Castiel woke up, and a glance at the clock tells him it's around half past eight— early, considering they fell asleep at around two in the morning. Once awake, Castiel had dropped a kiss to Dean's forehead before leaving to take his routine shower. Dean usually wakes by eight-thirty, which means he'll be awake soon.
"Hmm?"
Their conversation was cut short however, when Garth showed up, clearing his throat and carrying two, heavy suitcases in his hands. Judging by his lanky build, Castiel would not have guessed him to be able to carry the luggage in, but he seemed to have defied Castiel's expectations.
Blue laughs from the other end, and Dean feels himself smile at the sound of his laughter.
"Because I think I know what's wrong with your angel."
"Eh, trust me, you do not want to see my face."
Sam seems to disregard Dean's taunt, continuing, "-Check it, right now. I sent you the documents in-case you want to move in this month, and there's a few notices from the neighbours, since it's supposed to be a quote-unquote, ‘
Somewhere in his heart, Castiel had wished Dean would be his first kiss.
"Alright, you listen to me, we're going to get to the bottom of this, okay? Is it alright if I go talk to Sam?” Dean asks, and expects Castiel to refuse. As expected from him, Castiel remains stubborn and shows his refusal by a vigorous shake of his head, his nimble fingers crumpling around Dean's flannel shirt as he slips his leg between Dean's, and buries himself closer in Dean's warmth.
Castiel's face had flushed pink.
Silence met Castiel's words, and he hoped for a moment that he hadn't angered Dean by speaking out of line, but as it went, actions spoke louder than words, and so it was with Dean, who without wasting another second, pulled his wet, blood-soaked fingers out of Castiel's pretty, red hole, and pushed the fat, leaking tip of his cock inside.
The demon's hands fell away from Castiel's bare torso, and when Castiel lifted up his chin, he found Dean gazing at him, with deep, calculative eyes, and a faint smirk on his lips as he tapped his fingers against his chin and hummed.
Dean goes silent. Castiel allows his eyes to flutter open, and they land upon the open window, where the cold December breeze floats inside, the sky a dull gray now
"Besides,” Dean says, “-if I left, how would I hear you sing crappy Backstreet Boys songs at the top of your lungs each morning?"
"My sweet, lil' kitten, just what did you think you were doing with those panties, huh? Bending over to show them off, walking around with your ass so ripe and tasty, did you want me to see you?"
Jack laughs, unfazed by their affectionate banter. He turns around, reaching up in a brief hug before pulling away.
A choked gasp slips past his lips as he pulls the door open, and standing in front of him, face bruised, lip split, eye blackened, and forehead bleeding, is Dean.
"It's not like you’ll do anything about it. Why bother caring if I'm lonely or not?" A bitterness seeps into Castiel's words, quite prominent at that, and
A tiny, adorable little
"Have you tried? You gotta’ try harder."
"And why would I want to forget you?"
"Where's Sammy?"
"I like Saturdays," Castiel says after a long second.
"Daddy, daddy, daddy!" Claire ran in, blue eyes wide and bright, gasping for air as she studied Dean, and lastly, Castiel, who stood behind Dean.
"Eh, I hope so. Anyway, I've been meaning to ask. Is there a good Italian place around?" Castiel smiles.
"Apparently, yes."
On the other end of the wall, a heavy sigh floats across, and Castiel frowns a bit.
It isn't fair. Not for Cas. Not for Dean.
"Shut up. Where are we going?" Castiel asks, and it sounds more like a whine this time, but Dean hasn't told him yet, and he's curious. Obviously, it won't matter, he trusts Dean's judgement.
, that wasn't the best-case, that was, erm, that was the, erm, third case scenario. Not best. No reason to be best. Simply a possibility. Not like Dean has been thinking about it for years. Not a chance.
"Goddamn, baby, you ever played with yourself before?"
make me feel, nothing could ever come above it. So, yeah, Cas, ‘m gonna’ stay here, and I don't know what I'll do, if I'll have to sell the house, or if I'll have to get a new job, but I don't care. I'm going to stay here, and I'm going to make you happy every damn day. I'm going to make sure you never, ever get hurt again."
"Shh, be good for me, Blue," Dean whispered, before gripping Castiel by the waist and turning him around to slam his chest into the metal door. Castiel moaned, and pushed his clothed, taut, round ass out as invitation. At once, Dean's hands were pushing the suit down, tossing his backpack away, and letting the suit pool around Castiel's ankles. Naked and pressed against the cold metal door, Castiel let out a loud whine, bucking his hips backwards and grinding his ass against Dean's clothed, large, bulging erection. He rubbed his crack over the thick girth of Dean's cock, which could be felt through the thin fabric of the suit, and not soon after, Dean was hissing, large warm palms grabbing Castiel by the waist as he rubbed his cock over Castiel's naked ass.
with a soft grin.
"Caaaas–"
"Whatever, Mr. Green. I'm hanging up."
Loud, roaring laughter fills Dean's ears. It echoes through the walls of Dean's mind, and he winces at the sound.
"No, I don't think I'd like to be in a relationship that lasts a day and a half." Castiel frowns, and a soft look gleams within Dean's eyes as he takes a pause.
Dean laughs at Castiel's use of finger quotes, finding the action surprisingly endearing. His laugh subdues into a brief smile and he nods his head, taking a sip of his coffee.
And with a haughty laugh, Dean popped his jeans open, and let his cock— a huge, fearsome thing slap against Castiel's tender, plump asscheek. He stepped in closer, until his cock nudged against Castiel's hole, and rubbed the leaking, pink tip against his taint.
Right. His stash of pornography. Wait.
"You're telling me, you have a brother named after the devil? As in
"I've tuned it already; it should be working fine." Castiel pushes himself up to his feet
It can't be true.
"Sure."
Castiel’s eyes find Dean’s, and he traces his fingertips down the side of Castiel's arm, a wistful expression passing between them as they gaze at each other.
"You need to wait. Just for a few more moments, Castiel."
"I'm sure the pup knows already, just how amazingly wonderful his father is." Castiel let out a soft grunt as he stepped onto the final, top-most stair, and Dean chuckled, still holding onto Castiel's waist to help him.
Something warm unfurls within Castiel's eyes, an overwhelming want, only paralleled to Dean's, who sucks in a deep breath, the air between them so thin, their breaths mingle, the scent of the minty mouth wash Castiel used dancing across Dean's tongue, and Dean feels Castiel's skin dot with goosebumps under his hand on Castiel's waist.
You can't leave, Dean
“It’s different, Dean. Okay? It’s different. You don’t it changes anything, since you’ve known all along, you’d be leaving, and now you’re just leaving sooner, but it changes everything for me. And you know what? I blame myself too. I let myself get so swept away in
Castiel stiffens on the chair, wondering if he has heard Green right.
"Castiel. Such a pretty name, and you didn't want to tell me? That ain't fair. Come on now, Cas, you wanna' keep this game going? I answer, you answer?"
he promises himself, as he hangs his head down, and breathes out a sigh.
sure? I wasn't expecting you to play it on my ass." Dean grins, knowing just how much his lame comments irk Castiel, and as expected, Castiel narrows his eyes at him.
"I don't know," Dean muses. “-Maybe we're both men of refined tastes."
"Blue?" he asks, his voice hoarse from having remained silent for so long.
"Twenty-eight."
"Are you going to talk to me?" Castiel asks, running his knuckles down Dean's face in a soothing stroke, disheartened at the sight of Dean's still blurry eyes.
He heard the words, and he thought Cas meant it in the angelic or divine sense, at first. Not that that even makes sense, the way things panned out with Chuck. Then, an undertone of brotherly love. A friendship that’s deeper than friendship, that goes into family territory. But there’s a look in Cas’ eyes, pleading for Dean to understand- and it clicks.
Now he’d never get the chance to say any of those things.
“Dude, don’t take this the wrong way, but you’re a dick.”  Dean’s tone is amused, but there’s also a touch of fear, like he thinks Cas will smite him.  Cas cocks his head to the side, because he’s had his moments, but he’s not THAT petty.
They’re working a case in Oregon, some run-of-the-mill vengeful spirit.  Sam’s scouring the town records, Dean’s cleaning their equipment, and Cas is engrossed in a documentary about who knows what.  All is calm in the dingy hotel room until Gabriel pops in, legs crossed on the desk, much to Sam’s annoyance.
“Far more than you could get from Dr. Sexy,” he mutters and snatches at the remote.  Dean, being the overgrown child that he is, holds the remote high over Cas’ head.  Cas tries to climb up, but Dean’s a big brother, he knows how to play keep-away.  A brief tussle, and Cas flops back to the couch with a huff, arms crossed.
They keep their little thing a secret, for a while.  Or at least they try - turns out pretty much everyone figured it out long ago, just kept their mouths shut because that’s one particular conversation no one was looking forward to having.
“I mean, are you restless, feel like something’s wrong all the time? Because I get it, I feel it too. We’re used to our lives being threatened every moment of every day, it takes some time to adjust. But everything’s fine now. We can relax, let our guard down for once.”
He hasn’t let himself think about Cas, not really. Whenever his mind starts wandering that way, he makes it go somewhere else. It’s the only way he was able to function long enough to finish things.
Dean lies back on the hood of the Impala, legs hanging in front of the grill. The bottle of whiskey he snagged on his way out dangles loosely from one hand, his head rests on the other arm. Out here, with no city lights to ruin the view, the night sky seems to never end. Not that he’s ever stopped to appreciate it, before. As he finds Orion out of habit - the only constellation he can ever find - his mind wanders, and he can’t quite bring himself to stop it.
Because he knew, in that moment of too-late revelation, that whatever Cas felt… he felt it too.
“You sure about that?”  There’s a touch of humor in his voice, because Dean is now hiding his face in the blanket.
It takes a while to shake the feeling that Chuck went down too easy.
The angel approaches slowly; Dean startles when Cas places a hand on his arm, smoke rising from the contact.
“It’s actually quite entertaining.”  Something thumps in the movie and Dean flinches.  It dawns on Cas - “Are you scared, Dean?”
They only talk about it once, after he’s back to himself.  Cas’ face is twisted into a terribly sorrowful expression and he apologizes over and over and over, until finally Dean kisses him just to shut him up.  It’s their first kiss, and Dean hates that this is what it took, but afterward he wouldn’t exchange it for the world.
And then dinnertime rolls around. He takes a deep breath before stepping into the living area with a loud, “Burger time!” and a big smile.
It’s never said jokingly, only in those moments that are so full of emotion that they feel like their bodies can’t contain it, like when Dean is doing everything possible to reassure an upset Cas, or when they’re in the throes of particularly emotional love-making.  And it’s never said around others - it’s their private thing, Dean’s way of making Cas understand how much he means to him, because Cas is everything to him now.
By the time the movie ends, Dean is practically in Cas’ lap, head on his shoulder and clinging, actually clinging.  He’s half asleep, and Cas just can’t find it in himself to move him.  Poor kid never sleeps enough.  So Cas presses his lips gently to his hairline.
“Well that was weird,” Dean mutters.
It started as a joke.  Honest.
“My little Sammy, all grown up.”
Why didn’t he think faster, why didn’t he stop Cas, why didn’t he say something, anything- he just stood there, and all he could say was don’t do this, Cas, and then Cas did it anyway.
Cas leans down to touch his lips to Dean’s, then forces him to allow Cas to carry him back to the Impala.  Dean won’t admit it, but he kind of liked that too.
I love you.
“You think she’ll say yes?”
Sam and Eileen come home two weeks later to a completely different bunker.
“I believe it’s called Paranormal Activity.”  A look of panic crosses Dean’s features.  He tries to stand, but Cas lays a hand on his arm.  “What’s wrong?”
“I, uh.  I don’t do scary movies.”
It’s the first time anyone has called him anything other than Castiel - well, except the litany of insulting things Gabriel comes up with on a regular basis.  The angels have used his full name for all the centuries, millennia that he’s been alive; then this human, this flawed, mortal, hairless ape of a creature gives him a nickname.  Dean acts like it’s not a big deal - which, to him, it isn’t, not really.  But to Cas, it’s a sign of acceptance.  He’s one of the guys, an integral part of what they’ll later call Team Free Will.  And after that, it will represent his newfound humanity.
Dean wants to watch Dr. Sexy, MD.  Admittedly, Cas was amused the first time he saw the program, but it’s long since lost its appeal.  He wants to watch some foreign horror movie he found on Netflix a while back, but Dean refuses.
“One of the last things he told us was that we showed him that when people have to be their best, they can be. We can be. And that’s what we need to believe in. People, being their best. And I don’t know who exemplifies that more than this group right here - minus a few we lost along the way. I just-” His voice cracks, hard. “I just want to say thank you. To all of you. We wouldn’t be standing here without you. You’ve all been there through so much over the years and sacrificed more than your fair share, and you deserve better. I only hope that now you can have that.
“Bitch.” Dean grins.
The life is bleeding out of Dean, soul flickering with the effort of staying alive.
The library has been rearranged. One corner is now dedicated to several computers running police scanners, searching news and social media sites for suspicious content, GPS, security programs. The armory has been inventoried, reorganized and restocked. The information for hunters’ cover stories is all in one place, cell phones for “checking in with your supervisor” set up with a list of pseudonyms and other key information for each agency. A couple of hunters are there, getting supplies or information for a case.
“Of course, sugar plum.”
There had always been a certain ineffable tension between him and Cas. He was never sure what it was, to be honest. For a long time he thought it was just their “profound bond,” or whatever. Cas did grip him tight and raise him from perdition, after all - that does create a certain kind of connection. And then everything else they’d been through… Cas became part of the family. The third brother. But there was always something different about Sam-and-Cas as opposed to Dean-and-Cas. Cas belonged to him first, and no one ever forgot it.
Happiness isn’t in the having. It’s in just being. It’s in just saying it.
And Cas has to admit - yeah, he is a dick sometimes, and he’s done some very dick-ish things.  He’s working on it, honest.
This isn’t really a problem, most of the time.  They’ll get their laughs in, and Cas will join, being the good-natured individual he is.  The conversation gets looser and easier afterwards, comic relief having been provided, and whatever caused the untimely outburst is generally forgotten or deemed just not worth it.
Later, it becomes a term of endearment, almost.  Like Dean and Sam’s bitch and jerk exchanges.
5.  Ass-butt
“Don’t tell me it wasn’t my fault!” He turns and throws the beer bottle across the room. It hits the wall and shards fly, liquid frothing as it splashes down the wall into a foamy puddle.
2.  Baby
He holds his breath as he waits for a sign of success - he’s about to give up when he sees Dean’s chest rise slowly and a small smile creep across his face.
“Come for me, my angel.”
Sam narrows his eyes at him. “It’s more than that, isn’t it?” Dean dives back into the engine compartment of the car. “Is it… the people we lost? Is it Cas?”
And then Cas is kissing him, and all Dean can do is kiss back while Cas pushes him down onto the bed and crawls over him.  Finally he pulls away, and it takes all Dean’s self-discipline not to follow.
“I know Cas was important to you. He was important to all of us-”
He sits up, takes a long swig of whiskey, then drops the bottle on the ground. He knows prayers won’t reach Cas in the Empty, but whether it’s habit or wishful thinking, he finds himself doing it anyway.
“Sounds more like stalking, if you ask me.”  This time, Dean jumps, and he grabs for Cas’ hand.  He takes a breath, then realizes he’s got a death grip on Cas and pulls away.  “It’s okay.  I’m okay.”
“I guess, but not-” he cuts himself off with a quiet scream, bitten back as best as he can.  “Fuck it.”  He curls into Cas, beyond caring, and intertwines their fingers.  And if his heart’s beating a little too fast, he can just blame it on the movie.
“Dean.  What are you doing up?”
“No, you’re not. I know there’s something you’re not telling me.” Sam sighs. “Dean, I just want to help. Let me help.”
That wakes him up, fast.
He only says it once, all bitter sarcasm, and in that one word is all the anger and pain and betrayal he feels.  It hurts Cas, somewhere deep inside where all the souls from Purgatory have crushed his former self into a mere shadow.  He brushes it away like a fly buzzing in his ear, but later, thinking of it will break his heart.
Dean drops his wrench with a curse. “I said I’m fine, Sam.”
He dresses faster than he ever has and saunters into the bedroom, spurs jingling.  Cas is lounging on the bed wearing only chaps, hat low over his face.  He looks up at Dean with a devilish smirk.
The archangel places a hand over his heart with a pained expression.  “Ouch.  I was just checking in, but if my presence isn’t appreciated, then I guess I’ll leave.”  He pops out, leaving Cas glaring daggers at empty space.
Cas furrows his brows, because he really doesn’t get it.  But then he sees Sam’s face, which somehow looks red and green at the same time, and Dean’s, which is plastered with a devilish grin, and he understands.
(It’s a lie, but he talks them into leaving early the next morning, so Sam never has to know.)
“Uh… Cas?”  Dean is waving a hand in front of his face, and he suddenly realizes he’s been staring blankly at the wall for a while now.
“You’re mine, Dean-o.  Don’t ever forget that,” he growls, punctuating the name with a sneer.
“I was… keeping tabs.”
“Thanks… I guess.”  Dean fights the urge to squirm and looks away, anywhere but Gabriel’s leer.  His gaze lands on Cas, whose eyes are dark and focused on Gabe.
When I experienced a moment of true happiness, the Empty would be summoned and it would take me forever.
It’s not a time anyone really likes thinking about.  Especially Dean and Cas.
Which, in turn, means that Dean loves to make Sam as uncomfortable as possible.  It’s his duty as a big brother, after all.
Finally, in a last-ditch effort, he corners him. Dean is elbows-deep in an old car in the garage when Sam approaches, fresh beer in hand. He grunts in thanks when Sam hands him the beer, then sets it on the roof.
It didn’t sink in, at the time. There was a lot going on. Billie pounding on the door, his heart pounding in his aching chest. His brain didn’t have time to register what Cas was saying. All he knew, deep in his gut, before Cas ever said the words, was that it was a goodbye. Cas was doing something heroic and idiotic and throwing his life away and Dean didn’t know how to stop it.
He doesn’t know if he could take it. Not again. He can’t lose anyone else.
What’s the proper response here?  Cas isn’t sure, so he just goes with, “I don’t know.  Just seemed like the thing to do.”
Cas first suspects it when he sends Sam and Dean back to Samuel Colt’s time.  Dean is just entirely too excited about this.  Then he notices how Dean’s eyes glaze over a little when they watch some John Wayne movie - it’s the same look he gets when Cas teases him in the shower, when they know Sam is just on the other side of the door and now is really not a good time but Cas just loves fucking with him.
The waiter placed the wine down and told them that the food would be right out.
“Gabe?” Sam called out cautiously.
“Anyways, where do you want to go Cas?”
“Fine, you go get the keys for it.” Dean said barely glancing at the car. When Cas left, he walked over to the car. He ran his fingers over it. It was a bright, cherry red mustang. She was a beauty. Cas had great taste. Dean couldn’t believe that Cas had seen this and he didn’t. Man, he loved that Cas knew him inside and out.
“Dean, what is that smirk about? Should I read your thoughts?” Cas knew that Dean didn’t like it when Cas read his thoughts. Dean shook his head in the response.
“That’s what I thought.”
Dean sighed but nodded.
Sam thought about asking Gabe what he wanted, but he knew what the angel wanted. He reached for his undershirt but then bent over and started untying his shoe.He finished with his shoes and socks. He then went to take off his under shirt.
Sam knew he was vulnerable, but he didn’t care. Gabriel,
Crowley thought.
Cas gasped and looked up at his husband - his face a mixture of shock and excitement, “Oh, Dean. You shouldn’t have! The economy seats would’ve been fine! You could’ve at least told me!”
“Dean, everything ok?”Cas took out his head phones and moved closer to Dean. Dean shook his head. He didn’t want to worry Cas, but Cas had a headstart on worrying.
Sam lifted Gabe’s head, gently, with his thumb and forefinger. “Gabe, I really want this. I didn’t think you did, so I never pursued you. You are….God-” Sam started.
This time, Dean got the front. He started pedaling and soon they built up quite a lot of speed. Dean lifted his legs off the bike and let out a small squeal of excitement. Dean hadn’t had this much fun in a while.
Dean leaned in and gave Cas a quick peck on the lips, then headed to the nearest airport. They got out of the car, Dean grabbed his hunting duffle bag from the trunk. “Dean, why do you need that?” Cas said annoyed that Dean was bringing his hunting bag.
“Yes, Sammie. You have big feet, you are abnormally large, I mean seriously, you are what 6’5? YOU ARE A FUCKING GIANT, SAM!”, Gabe said. “HOW DO YOU FUNCTION IN THE WORLD?”
********************
“Alright Sam, let me know if you need anything. I can always ask Gabe to come down and help you,” Cas said, a little too close to the microphone.
Gabe followed Sam and opened the doors for him. To Gabe this was new. Yes he had been to the bunker before, but now it was his home. Gabe smiled at the thought and followed Sam through the bunker to Sam’s room. Gabe held out his hand.
__________________
They quickly ran to the building. Gabe opened the door and hurried Sam in. As soon as they entered, Sam closed his eyes and turned and kissed Gabe. Gabe just about showed his true form, killing every demon in the room. They quickly hurried through the rest of the building. They came into a room full of children with eyes full of fear. They followed the eyes to see a hunched back figure in the dark.
“You sure?”
“I’m sorry. Next time I promise I won't get kicked in the head by goat hooves, ok?’
The voice instantly calmed Gabe down. As soon as Gabe heard the last part, he got a mischievous look on his face. Sam sighed. Gabe snapped his fingers and something appeared in his hand.
“Oh nothing.”
“We sent them out at 6:00 this morning. Why? Do you think something happened to them?”
‘And you say I’m the sentimental one’-S
“Sam, stop that. You know that none of that is true. You are an amazing hunter and while you do have your demons, literally and figuratively, you don’t let them tear you down. And before you say anything, I  know how you feel. We come from different sides of the same track. We both had absentee fathers. Mine came back only when Luci was taken over with the Mark of Cain and he refuses to believe that he is  anything but a great father. Your father left you for weeks on end with only your brother and what little food you guys had and when Dean got old enough, he would leave you alone, by yourself for weeks on end. I know that you think you aren't good enough but you are. You saved the world. You have had Lucifer torture you and you came out stronger than you ever were. You came back from Hell without a soul and managed to come back more attuned with your own emotions than ever before. You are the best human to ever grace this planet. You have stopped the Apocalypse on more than one occasion. You are stronger than you think. You brought me back to my former self after Asmodeous. So Sam, you are not too dark or too twisted.”
Bonjour, que puis-je vous offrir en cette belle soirée*- Hello, what can I get for you this fine evening?
“Right here, Sammie,” Gabe said, peering out from the trunk. “Don’t worry, I’m not going anywhere.” Sam calmed down and stepped out of the car, stretching to reach full height. Sam walked to the back, flexing his knees as he walked, and picked up the bags.
‘Alright. Gank that evil son of a bitch and then come back safe’-D
“Yes it is,” he heard Sam say.
Sam heard his phone ringing on the nightstand.
“Hello, yes we were wondering if we could rent a double bike possibly. It’s always been a dream of mine to do so and...well, you know how it is.” Cas realized he had been rambling and quickly finished up his sentence.
“How many times do I have to tell you?! I hate that nickname,” Sam said, throwing his hands up in the air.
Gabe watched his every move. Gabe was like a child watching an adult making them ice cream. Sam gave Gabe some side eye, letting the angel know that Sam knew he was watching. After a couple of minutes, Sam was ready to go and headed to the car. Gabe stopped him, before he opened the door. Gabe pressed a light kiss on Sam’s lips.
Cas pulled himself up to be level with Dean and the second Dean’s lips slightly parted, Cas’s tongue entered. Dean slipped his into Cas’s mouth.  Soon Dean was on top and straddling Cas’s thighs. Cas let out a soft moan into Dean’s mouth. At the sound, Dean’s underwear started to tighten. Cas took notice of this and took advantage of the situation at hand. He knew that he could deny Dean relief this morning and make him wait all day or he could be a nice husband and give Dean relief right now. Cas, being the little shit he could be, choose the first option. In one swift movement, he lightly pushed Dean off him and raced to the bathroom.
“Sam? Where are you going?” Gabe said, rubbing his eyes and sitting up.
Cas leaned over and kissed the top of Dean’s head. Dean cuddled into Cas.
“No, baby. You are not in the wrong, He is.
Sam exited the bathroom. Gabe’s eyes immediately turned to see him. Gabe had not been wrong when he had told Balthazar that Sam was most attractive in a suit. Gabe had told Balthazar a great many things about Sam, but mainly about his great love for the younger Winchester.
“Gimme your wallet. I want to surprise you with the room,” Gabe said, smiling and wiggling his eyebrows. Sam hesitantly handed over his wallet. Gabe took it and spun towards the door. Sam chuckled at the sight and followed Gabe out.
,” Dean said. The way Dean said his name, drove Cas crazy. Cas picked Dean up bridal style and carried him to the bed. Cas laid Dean down and began to worship Dean’s body.
“Yea, thanks Crowley. I’ll make sure to tell him. Are you sure that’s the right place though?”
“It was a surprise! I didn’t want to tell you about it because I know you’d be against it. And I- Cas, you deserve the world and more, I love you.” Dean held his hands and looked into their eyes.
A lot happens in this chapter. Idek where to begin.
“Gabe, you have to be joking? I’m not wearing this.”
Cas chuckled at his husband and helped Dean up. Dean couldn’t bring himself to look at Cas, he felt like an idiot. He basically accused Cas of lying. Cas lifted Dean’s face to meet his eyes. Dean looked into Cas’s bright sky blue eyes and wanted to break his gaze but Cas held his face firm.
“What’s so funny Dean?,” Cas tilted his head to the side.
I love your hair. It’s so soft and silky. Honestly, I don't know how I have survived so long without you. You are perfect. And I will tell you that everyday I have too. You are the best human ever, I can’t believe you ever went to hell. You should never have been through that. I can’t wait to spend everyday with you.” Gabe walked over to Sam and put his hands around his neck. He planted kisses trailing to Sam’s lips. Sam gave a small smile and bent his head down to kiss Gabe. “Now finish getting dressed so I can show off my BigFoot.”
“Alright.” Sam pulled to the side of the road and got out of the car, Gabe following. Gabe went to the drivers side and got in started the engine. It took a while, but Sam eventually fell asleep.
“Aww. I didn’t know Samantha was the sentimental type,” Gabe said, “But anyways, Crowley can you uhhh leave me and Sam alone for a minute?”
*Salut, Peut-on avoir deux commandes de Pot-au-Feu avec une bouteille de Bordeaux*-  Hi, Can we have two orders of Pot-au-Feu with a bottle of Bordeaux?
“Y-y-yes.”
“What?!? I thought Crowley and his demons killed all of them!”
Dean and Cas head home and talk about shit with Sam and Gabe. And some seggsy times in the shower.
“Dean, hey, look at me,” Cas said, softly snapping.
“Erm alright,” Dean said.
Dean heard some ruffling and a series of grunts followed by a second of silence.
“When we get in there, I want you to just kiss me and close your eyes, ok?”, Gabe said.
“Hello Dean. Is everything ok?” Sam sounded like Dean had woken him up.
“Dean, it’s ok you just forgot where you put your clothes. If my trench coat wasn’t so big I would probably have completely lost it. I have lost some many ties it isn’t even funny,” Cas said, looking into Dean’s beautiful, emerald eyes. Dean felt better now. Dean simply nodded his head to show his acknowledgement. Cas leaned and gave Dean a soft kiss on the lips. Dean pulled away and put his hands on Cas’s chest. He leaned his head against Cas’s chest and moved his arms to wrap around Cas’s neck. Cas felt Dean nuzzle into his neck. Cas smiled at the thought that Dean Winchester, the most feared hunter in the world, felt so happy that he felt safe in his arms.
“I’m on my honeymoon with my wife. We just got married 5 weeks ago,” Cas said, knowing that Dean may be his sub but was also super possessive of him at times. Dean shot him a look filled with venom. Cas was going to pay for this.
“I just have a feeling something is off. Not here with us, but with Sam and Gabe,” Dean’s leg started to bounce, something that only happened if  he was either really worried or really stressed. Cas put his hand on Dean’s leg to stop the bouncing.
“Nevermind.” Dean silently cursed Cas. Cas lightly chuckled to himself and then made a sharp right turn. Cas abruptly stopped the bike.
“Alright, Crowley, we need you to get us in,” Sam said. Crowley nodded and motioned for them to follow. Crowley snapped his fingers, and all the demons fell to the ground.
“The case is going fine. We realized that we aren’t hunting a Jefferson Starship, we are hunting a Krampus. It’s some sort of evil Santa,” Sam said.
“Dean, whatever you’re doing is not going to work.” Dean nodded in response. He decided then and there that he was going to sexualize every little thing he did. Dean knew that Cas was very possessive and Dean knew just how to push Cas’s buttons. And that’s exactly what Dean was going to do.
They passed a bicycle rental and Dean hoped that Cas didn’t notice because he had already ridden one, Gabe had done it as some sort of way to teach him and  Sam a lesson.  ‘Wait a minute,’ Dean thought, ‘When Gabe made his comment about Sam doing the riding, Gabe didn’t mean, like the way I ride Cas, right? I mean, Sam would never be interested in Gabriel. But what if he is?’ Dean shook his head to dismiss these thoughts and the imagines of his brother having sex with Gabe. The last thing he needed on his mind was his baby brother have sex.
“What is a ‘Krampus’,” Sam said, air quotes around Krampus.
“Dean, let me help. I could figure it out for them and that would be all, then I could come right back,” Cas said.
kudos and comments, please and thank you <3
“Wha-” Dean began. Cas started straddling Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s ok…” Cas sighed defeatedly. “I don’t get you mortals sometimes.”
“Please don’t bring my father into this Sam,” Gabe interrupted, placing his hands on Sam’s chest.
“That sounds great. Is it ok if I let my wings spread out while you are in the shower?” Cas asked, shrugging off his trench coat and suit jacket.
“Oh nice. And you?” she said, this time towards Cas.
“Oh. I thought...I mean, you only take that bag on hunts.”
“Yep. I’ll go get you know who,” Gabe said heading towards the door.
Sam was hunched over his computer re-reading the police reports. He didn’t want to but Gabe told him to and the last thing he wanted to do would be to upset Gabe. He heard his phone ding and picked it up to see who it was. It was Gabe.
“Where did you learn to do that?” Gabe asked, gasping at the pleasure that he was being given.
“Oh no you don't! Get back here Cas!” Dean shouted, as he raced after Cas. He was too late though. Cas was safe in the bathroom and he heard the soft click of the lock. “C’mon Cas. Babe, you can’t leave me like this all day.” Dean said in his sweet sub voice that Cas loved. It typically got him whatever he wanted unless he had disobeyed Cas.
“Bonjour. What can I get you?”, the man said cheerily.
Gabe sighed and was quite upset. Sam saw this and walked over.
Gabe looked up and tried to imagine what his life would look like if Sam and Dean hadn’t been born. He couldn't, the pain was too much. He couldn’t bear to imagine life without his precious Samshine. “Sam, do you know why I call you my Samshine?”
chocolat blanc et fraise**- white chocolate and strawberry
Dean and Cas got off the plane, fingers intertwined. They went over to the luggage wheel and broke hands only to pick up the luggage and then locked hands again. “Cas, you ok? You seem...giddy. And you aren’t the giddy type,” Dean asked, rubbing the back of Cas’s hand with his thumb.
“I don’t even want to know what that means,” Dean said.
“You know you don’t have to wear anything around me Samantha.”
‘Headed towards the creature now’-S
“Well, I am in the city of love with the love of my life. I think I have a good reason to be giddy. Besides, my wings are feeling a little neglected,” Cas said, smirking. Dean knew that Cas would become cranky if he didn’t massage Cas’s wings ASAP, so he stepped on the gas.

“I’m sorry, I function like everyone else. I just sometimes have to go to special clothing stores, or bend down to enter rooms. Sorry to disappoint.” Sam bent down and planted a kiss on the angel. Gabe crossed his arms. Sam laughed and finished getting dressed.
“No, wherever you are, is my home.” Sam smiled and just nodded. “Here, why don’t you pull over and we switch so you can sleep.”
“Hello, Sam. What was it that my brother wanted to ask you? It seemed really important,” Cas asked, exchanging a look with Dean.
“Dean, listen. I love your brother. Not just for sex, but for every bit of man he is. He is the most amazing person I have ever met. I promise you that I will not hurt him. He means the world to me. So Dean, I know you may not like it but please, just give me a chance.”
“Here, let’s look at you, ok?” Sam asked before gently trailing his fingers all over Gabe. He would occasionally glance up to see if the angel was in any sort of pain. Gabe didn’t start wincing until the younger man was at his neck.
“Yes, Moose I am. I sent a couple of demons to investigate the place and it was correct. You're welcome for doing your job for you. I can get us in, I guess.”
“Where are we, Samosa?”, Gabe asked as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes.

“Yes Dean. I’ll let you know.”, Sam said.
“Well possibly. Can I get that warehouse address. I just want to drive by it and see if they need any help. It’s been about 4 hours since they went out.”
“No siree, you better get up and take off your top and jacket off,” Gabe said, shrugging off his jacket and unbuttoning his shirt. Sam took off his shirt and stood there. Gabe looked at him in all his glory. Sam was tone but not too toned. He walked over and rubbed his calloused hands all over the tall man’s torso.
Gabe nodded and got out of bed. He was only in his underwear, but he still felt covered. Or maybe, it was just the fact that Sam slept naked. Before Gabe could say anything, Sam was throwing on a pair of pants.
“Easy there tiger,” Dean said. “Come on, Let’s go back to the hotel.”
“Dean, just pick a car. So we can go. Why are we even here we got one at the airport”, Cas said, exasperated.
The bell made a light ding! As they entered the shop.
Dean leaned across the chairs and kissed Cas. He reciprocated the kiss, but was confused.
“You would be correct in that assumption. Why do you need something?”, Crowley asked, sounding bored as ever.
Gabe tasted like candy and Heaven. Gabe smelled like sweets and home.
Cas held the plastic card up.
“Come on Gabe,”Sam said. He was growing tired of the childish fights between the two.
Cas deepened his voice before speaking again, “Was it what you were going to ask him before the wedding?” Dean could barely make out what Cas was saying to his baby brother. All his instincts told him to take the phone away from Cas. But he had learned to trust Cas. He also wanted relief tonight and he knew that if he didn’t let Sam and Cas talk, then he probably wouldn’t get any.
“Mine. Your mine and only mine,”Sam growled. It was a side of Sam that Gabe had never seen. He liked it a lot.
Pls note I do love Crowley. He is one of my favorite characters. And next Sabriel chapter there will be lots of hunting. Don't worry! Again, I love you guys. Lemme know what you guys think of it so far. Also, When i say Julie, I don't mean Crowley's hellhound. I'm Just talking about a random demon. <3
Sam pulled the car into the parking lot and took a deep breath. He opened the door and got out. Typically, he didn’t get stares. You know, a man in a suit getting out of a car at a police station, it isn't a crazy thing to see. But apparently in Memphis, Tennessee, it was a strange sight. His shirt was tight and the pants as well. He didn’t pay attention to the stares, though. He was a man in love.
“Well, I mean I could get it with my grace but I would prefer the real deal,” Gabe said, winking.
“You too are like children, I swear to God,” Sam said this as he sat down. “Listen, let’s just finish this case then we can break away from each other.”
“I love you too Dean.”
Dean wasn’t really onboard with the whole idea but, there was nothing he could do about. He just hoped that Gabe didn’t hurt Sam, because Dean would then hurt Gabe. Dean, however, wouldn’t let that affect his honeymoon. It was just him and Cas and they only had a day left before they were to head back. Dean was shaken out of his head by the sound of phone dinging signifying that he had a text.
“Wha-what are you doing here? I thought that you weren’t coming until I told you I was ready?”
“Listen Sam, me and Cas need to talk to you and Gabe. Are you sleeping with Gabe?”
“Hey listen Deano, me and Sammie are busy right now. Case stuff.”, Gabe said.
They closed the door. “Hey do you have the room key Cas?” Dean asked casually.
“Yea well, you're not exactly making it look good for Sam to get some angelic help,” Dean said.
Cas sat there, sitting very still and concentrating on using Angel radio. “Gabe should be there soon,” Cas said. Dean texted Sam telling him that Gabriel was on his way.
“Cool, thanks Cas,” Sam said, hanging up. Before Dean could say anything, Sam was gone.
“Well, I got an address. The same one Crowley gave me. I just went down to double check the address.” Sam said this as he took off his coat. “Lemme get changed and then we’ll get going. Sounds good?”
“ 6:30 I believe. We have about 3 hours before we have to go. So if ya want to, we have some
“Yes, Dean. It's right here.”
Dean moved his hands and tried to think of unsexy things. “Just think about your grandparents having sex,” Dean thought to himself. That seemed to do the trick. A few minutes later the elevator door dinged open and a nice-looking couple walked in.  Awkward “Hellos” were said.
Sam grumpily took the underwear, along with his suit and went to the bathroom to get dressed. Sam took a long glance at the underwear, before putting it on. ‘Wow, this is actually really soft,’ Sam thought. It didn’t quite hold him but he would make it work.
Dean and Cas go on a date on top of the Eiffel Tower.
“No.”
“I’m your boyfriend?!?” Gabe blushed at that. Sam saw and thought that the conversation should end.
“Dean wha-” Cas said, dropping his belt, so that his pants hung loosely around his waist. Suddenly, Dean lost his footing and fell flat on his back, on the slick tile floor of the bathroom. Cas was on him in a second. “Dean, are you ok?!” Cas said, nervous that his husband had injured himself.
Cas thought. He shook his head to dismiss these thoughts. He quickly got dressed and before leaving the room, he threw on his trench coat.
“Cas, babe, that food was amazing. Thank you.”
“Mhm,” Dean said, swaying with Cas.
“Welll, are you having sex with Gabe?”
“I just ordered some wine and their national food. That’s all.” Cas put his hand over Dean’s. “Now, next time the waiter comes  by, try not to look like you want to rip his throat out?”
“Oh god. I haven’t had to do this in a while. Could you stand up? No, I should sit down,”Gabe sat down, awkwardly for that matter.
Gabe stuck his tongue out back at Crowley.
“You’d leave me?” Gabe was a little high on pain medication, but the emotion was real.
Sam thought that Gabe looked bored at the thought of hunting with him and Crowley. Sam had never had his brother’s self-confidence and often thought that Jess was only there for as long as he could do what she wanted when she wanted and now that he could do what he wanted with his partner, it made Sam feel...vanilla. But at the same time, when Gabe was with others he always looked like he had better things to do. Unless he was with Sam, then he never looked bored.
Then Cas wrapped his arms around Dean Winchester, gripped him tight and raised him from perdition.
Silly as it sounds, it’s the best sex he’s had in years.
3.  Dean-o
He thinks he’s done pretty well, up to this point, and he figures hey, maybe no one has to know.  Should’ve known his luck would run out sometime.
Dean just looks at him. “Just working on this old T-bird. What’s up with you?”
“I’d bet my life on it.” He pauses. “And, Sammy. Do the both of you a favor and hire a photographer when you do it. You won’t regret it.”
Sam is quiet, studying his brother for a long moment. Then he says, “Okay. I’ll help you.” The few tears that had escaped in Dean’s speech become a steady flow, and Sam just wraps his arms around him. “We’ll keep looking.”
