The Baron (challenging even Mycroft’s standards for bespoke tailoring) came round the desk and, with a quirked head, considered him. His somewhat wiry, muddy brown (the worn-through earth tone of the unrefurbished fabric on the Bakerloo line; unhelpful association) hair included a high widow’s peak that seemed to draw up and back his skull away from his long, bearded chin (well groomed, of course). (Alec had had a similar air of magnetic prowess; but Gruener carried none of Alec’s penchant for the boyish pleasure of behaving badly… and roping others into joining him.)
John waved his eyebrows. ‘Oh good, two nights in a row, then.’
Then as now he got the brunt of it, a hot, red-orange stain setting fast to his cuffs and the leather of his brogues, so he ducked out of the queue for some spare serviettes (the flimsy miniature kind, of course — as if they expected the only people who made messes had child-sized hands?). Beginning to wipe and dab where flecks of piping creamy tomato had splattered, he held out a handful to —
John blinked. ‘Did you miss the bit where I spilled about twenty –’
‘Sound reasoning,’ Sherlock replied primly, getting back to his slides.
All comments much appreciated!
As ever, remaining mistakes have nothing to do with my beta and everything to do with changes I insist on making after she'd seen it. Comments and feedback incredibly appreciated.

Somewhere on the margins of his thoughts, he was aware that he stood here, a middle-aged, care-wrinkled man in the middle of a absurdly dull day at work, hems of his trousers speckled with tomato that he was trying to blot with a tongue-dampened napkin,
After a minute or two, she murmured, awed, ‘You are two remarkable gentlemen.’

After a moment, he turned his back on them and looked at the kitchen. Everything was in its usual place, shadowy in the evening light, teamugs overturned on the drying rack from when Mrs. Hudson had stopped by earlier, with her deepening respiratory cough, her arthritic hands patting John’s blunt hands. He could feel John’s eyes on his neck, and wanted, for the first time in many weeks (years), to be

‘Holmes,’ murmured a mellow, mid-vocal range, public sch— well, military academy (underneath, Belfast), but certainly upper-class public servant — voice.
John kissed him, sighing and sucking Sherlock’s lips with his sun-burn-hot lips shoving and embracing and pulling his body so hard against Sherlock’s that it hurt in a way that dreams couldn’t achieve.
‘Maybe…’ He considered the tools available, the time left, the likelihood that she would agree to cut her hair. (Surely this constituted a ‘good cause’!) ‘Perhaps if she went incognito as a man.’
, for god’s sake. That had been anything but cold, even in the chill of John’s room.
‘I had been planning, Dr. Watson, to keep it for the debut to an unequivocally more important function – the gala for my own personal charity, the Water Round The Horn group – tomorrow evening. I have made something of a tradition of…’ she looked momentarily bashful, then smirked, and continued, ‘of making a wish on the stone for good luck. A silly exercise, I know, but so far it has proved entirely powerful. The Carbuncle was a gift from my husband upon our marriage, you see, and it seemed a far more appropriate moment for something so… sentimental.’ She smiled again, eyes warm. ‘If I am to be forced to dance, I intend to draw on all my advantages.’
The unbidden urge to kiss John perilously breathless erupted in his mind, so vivid with sense-memory he could feel the phantom impressions of such a meeting on his skin and clothing.
She was right, too. He didn’t really have money to give her. (He would find it, if he had to. Though he was
By the time he eventually reached the Cosmopolitan, he was almost glad Sherlock wasn’t to hand either for him to clock or to snog. Fortunately he had a meeting with a supermodel so he didn’t have to decide just now.

He ran.
Startled, Challa’s gaze flickered, then rested again on the bird, who had clambered out of her cage and gently up the sergeant’s arm, resting on her now-raised elbow. ‘I – yes, I suppose, that’s accurate. Sorry, yes, no, that’s
‘What?’ he slurs, fighting the curtains of his vision.
John’s left hand flexed angrily, visibly struggling with himself.
As he moved the car into park, his eyes flicked up automatically to consider John and Molly in the rear-view mirror. What was something of a surprise, however, was to find John’s eyes instantly lock with his in their reflections.
Sherlock stopped moving. They didn’t discuss — John had tiptoed around the evidence of Sherlock’s time in Serbia (though almost certainly he didn’t know that was their country of origin) ever since he’d first seen them, by accident, in the fluorescent kitchen lamplight one midnight in June. After (a month after) that, he’d traced slow, blunt fingertips over each one in the middle of another night when’d he’d thought Sherlock was asleep, only the fourth time they’d been in bed together as sexual partners. The gooseflesh, naturally, had told John before long that Sherlock was patently not sleeping, but they both maintained the fiction and, after John’s unhurried exploration, he had settled back down, closer, at Sherlock’s side, lips shakily pressing to Sherlock’s skin, until Sherlock had feigned waking and allowed John to roll him up and over him until they got lost in each other in quaking, worshipful relief. The nightmares, unlike John’s, were silent, and did not merit mentioning.
After another moment, Sherlock caught his eye and said, almost urgently, ‘I had no idea you would be so affected. Even after…’
* * *
It continued to astound him that he could take two turns off Commercial Street, almost precisely one mile from the deafening droves of tourists in Union flag t-shirts interspersed with middle-aged women in svelte jackets and sensible footware, young men with expensive ties, all with earphones often merely for show (certainly over the din there was little chance of hearing music without incurring permanent hearing loss), and suddenly find silence, as though John had abruptly shut off the television in the middle of roars of edited laughter. London: a city of eternal, familiar contradictions.
* * *
John frowned. ‘It still seems like a bad idea.’

Shaking her head, Suze grimaced with what he diagnosed as shame. ‘Worse than that. I… I fancied him. Met him at a club one Saturday when I was out with my mates — m’thirtieth birthday do.
; Sherlock could have killed him for doing so; maybe they had some of that execrable ‘soup’ for him to use as a weapon) and got easily to his feet (absolutely, the soup: he’d even withhold the crackers, lest the punishment not be adequate to the crime).
‘Oh, it’s all right!’ Anne urged, setting about switching the lamp on, tidying up the bed and moving the half-full waste basket to the door, no doubt to take out once it was properly time. ‘My night shift tonight! You go out, splash some water on your face, have a breather. Rejoin the world a bit. Do you good.’ She sat, and gently looked at him hovering now by the foot of the bed. ‘He won’t go before you’re back.’
‘I don’t,’ Christopher blurted, into John’s mouth, sucking his lips hungrily between words, ‘I — I don’t — ugh — I usually — I’m not —’
of contact with a (big, tall, hefty man’s) cheekbone, causing him to groan, but
and he didn’t even know it yet.
Sherlock’s eyes swept the room, floor to ceiling, before he nodded noncommittally. A faint pull of muscle tugged his lips, and John had to hold back a sigh of relief. He had it.
With characteristic lightning speed, Sherlock replied,
Wordlessly and without looking at each other they each dropped a handful of notes on the bar and went their way through the crowd, John not caring at the prickle on the back of his neck as people around them, probably, whispered at their departing forms (‘pansies’, ‘poofs’), didn’t care if they looked like slags or escorts or just strangers about to fuck in an alley.
A hand on his shoulder made him start. Turning around, he found the young detective sergeant – Priya Challa, first year in her current position, so not one of those at all affected by his… absence; about to get engaged; sculpted hideous abstracts in her spare time – smiling serenely at him.
None of the people, settings, or mind-bogglingly farcical dialogue was familiar, but he had not been paying as much attention to the films they’d been watching as to John’s expressive face while Sherlock hurled occasional insults at the production value and believability. (They’d both been on their phones, anyway, so surely it wasn’t quite the sacrosanct ritual along the lines of a funeral or marriage that barred his (logical) interruptions.)
‘More or less.’
), including first-person accounts of the acquiring of unconsenting girls for sex work, and led not only to much rehashing when, in the summer and autumn of 1888, Jack the Ripper started preying on similarly working-class women and highlighting the sexual nature of their class position as attractive for sexualized violence; but
Of the injury itself, there was — distressingly — nothing.
‘Jesus!’ John whispered angrily, into the inside of Sherlock’s hand which he found clapped across his mouth. Sherlock pulled him into the stylised recess in the wall near a totally useless curtain. John pushed away the hand – honestly, he wasn’t twelve – but tried to marshal his suddenly frenzied thoughts. They were standing very close together (which, had he not spent the last twelve hours at more than arm’s length from the man, would have been totally unremarkable given the long precedent for proximity) in view of the front desk. A prematurely balding, spotty, morose youngish man with a jaw like an orangutan was biting his nails. He was clearly pale by nature, but in the grey afternoon sunlight seemed almost sickly gaunt, jumping as a suitcase knocked the marble tile across the hall. After another moment (during which John was fleetingly distracted by the curl of hair at the very back of Sherlock’s exposed neck –

Except after a moment John impulsively dragged Sherlock’s fingers to his lips and firmly, reverently, kissed his left knuckles. Then his right. Hugging them with his whole hand around Sherlock’s, gentle around the intravenous lines.

— was also almost palpably reasoning to herself that, in fact, the rumours had been true all along: they didn’t need two bedrooms in Baker Street.
‘Come on, Sherlock, come on, for me,’ he murmured, and Sherlock moaned and bowed up into his palm and came, hot and thick, between them, shuddering, until John couldn’t wait another second. Taking his hand to his own flies, he unzipped his jeans and wiggled his hand to free his own cock where it was possibly the hardest it had been since the previous best sex of his life, with the barwoman in Germany during his leave after a full year of nothing but his own hands in the desert. He winced at how close he was and with each pull of his slick hand (slick, he thought, and oh that brought a harsh groan up from his toes), his knuckles brushed Sherlock’s still heaving stomach just beneath him, above his legs which went on at least a mile even hitched around John. His head fell forward and he breathed in the sweat at Sherlock’s neck as he felt his orgasm close in.
Considering this, John sipped his tea. ‘And you make something of that?’
‘Hm?’ John asked, coming back to Earth. Molly was considering him, twirling her fork on a forgotten wide rice noodle. ‘Sorry, gathering wool: what’d you say?’
‘Witty,’ he said dryly. ‘Yes, I can. Or.’
‘Stabbed,’ he concludes aloud.

‘Mm.’
Wordlessly – for, if he had perfected nothing else in his time ‘away’, it was his air of invisibility – he slipped out of the station and back onto the bustling, zooming, unseasonably cool concrete-and-rain tapestry of the street which leant the station its name. Exhaust, grease fumes, mist, rubbish, heated rubber, millions upon millions of

‘Then we have’ – he checked his watch – ‘roughly ninety minutes to teach this parrot the classical languages. Sit down.’
As if to reduce the extent of his poor planning, Sherlock turned and strode into the street they had just been surveilling, stepping into direct sunlight exactly as if he owned the place. Surprised, John snapped to attention and followed, deliberately scraping each sole on the pavement as he did so.
‘Almost certainly.’
John Watson in his life in every possible human way, that he had not been measuring each of those days with corresponding observance, was peculiarly chastising.
‘What do they matter? It’s done, I’m not with them – I’m here.’
‘It’s fine,’ he assured him, just as quietly. Far more important than the drink was the man, not unlike the black origami lotuses they had stumbled across those years ago. Small, tight-packed, dense with meaning, superficially ornamental but, when unfolded and seen in its full ontological spread, comprised of one continuous, beautifully simple texture:

‘Good,’ John muttered admiringly down at him, while somewhere either miles or centimetres away John’s toes were rubbing the wrong way up the hairs above Sherlock’s ankle.

John’s mobile buzzed in his pocket, and he drew it out –
Finding the elusive Maureen involved, blessedly, some actual searching. Not without digging deep into his mental map, after two hours and several semi-lucid tips, did he find her wandering, ghost-like, up an alley not far from the canal (still mid-afternoon, yet almost deserted). She was chatting dully to another homeless person (alcoholic; over fifty, long time on the streets; Mancunian — it became clear as he got closer — by birth; not transgender herself but evidently frequent enough among their number; early-stage layer of sarcoptes scabes, transmitted from the mixed collie-spaniel following loyally at her side, also recently afflicted) when she spotted him.
‘James Horner,’ Peterson said, and John attempted to wrest his attention back to the case. ‘Arrested last night after being identified by several hotel staff members and Lady Braithwaite’s personal assistant as having been in the corridor doing plumbing maintenance at the time the diamond –’
‘Not a morning person then?’ he grinned.
‘Dreadful business,’ continued Sir James. ‘Ah, yes, thank you. Milk, no sugar, if you can,’ he directed to John, who was at the partners desk handling tea. (Their roles, all three of them, were easy to fill. And of course John had gone for the chipped mug before realising Mycroft wasn’t staying.) Damery had settled into their high-armed sofa with grace, so his discomfort was rather with the matter at hand.
‘Makes a nice change for women to be running out of here without having just thrown water in one of our faces,’ John observed. ‘God, “The Bride of bloody Frankenstein.” Is that what we are? Just a…’
‘Sherlock,’ he began, finding his voice shaking again, but this time he didn’t care.
‘I believe you will be glad of the change in the morning.’
‘And yet, needs must.’ Sherlock hopped up and swept himself off to his bedroom before John could say anything more, followed after a minute by the clanging of the pipes.
–  he pinned Mary’s arms, pushed her unmoving body beyond of arm’s length of the second also unmoving guard (Ricoletti), grabbed both guns – sent one cascading across the floor into a far, out-of-reach, obscured corner, the second to stow it in his own waistband like John would do, like he himself had done too often in their 797 days apart – extracted multiple twist-ties from the depths of his pockets –

The walk had definitely helped, but the persistent questions about what they were doing hadn’t dissipated — had, if anything, gotten stronger during his brief venture.
‘Then you–’

‘Right,’ said John, grinning broadly and flipping open a dictionary. ‘Let’s teach this bird some Greek.’

’Cheers, Dr. Watson, will do.’ The man, John’s own age (as the medical chart informed him) but with a brown beard, tame in a way John’s ruddy stubble never looked when he bothered to grow it out, nodded in thanks and, taking the bottle of migraine pills and waving them, rattling, gratefully as he left.

Not how he’d envisioned the night going.
‘Good luck, boys. And let me know if there’s anything I can do.’
‘Not anymore,’ John heard himself say.
In a flash and whip of papers they were both on their feet, a collision of mouth and hands, teeth biting into lips and tongues and fresh-revealed skin like faint pinpricks of barbed wire, sharp enough to hurt. The burn of hot chilies across his taste buds almost made him laugh.

he was glad they could do this — they could be together, in the most intimate possible way. No fantasy third parties, no pretending not to want it or need it or love it to the depths of his bones: sex between them was something that just

‘You have a night off, John love,’ nodded Anne with unflagging kindness, as she looked him over. Her handbag, slipping off her arm, came to rest as usual atop his mother’s former dresser. (None of his mum’s actual things — the trinkets, her perfume, her wedding photo, the little crafts like jewellery dish Harry, age 8, had made declaring her ‘World’s Best Mum!!!’ — were anywhere to be found.)
A holiday: an excellent idea. Maybe with the money from this case, and John’s latest pay cheques from his locum work, they could actually spring for somewhere like that. In January, if Sherlock would ever bloody tell him when his actual bloody birthday even
‘The report’ (from his brother, he did not deign to say) ‘referred to purely personal security.

John’s body knew before he did that he needed to be closer, just three steps closer, to Sherlock, but arriving there, at an intimate-but-respectable distance less than an arm’s length apart, he felt something flutter behind his sternum, choking the rest of him to get out.

Sherlock had pulled his arms through his sleeves and was gathering his keys. John felt suddenly furious. It was one bad joke after another. Never mind getting a leg over, Sherlock clearly was trying to prevent their ever being alone in the same room together. The same clutch of fear John had felt last night when Peterson had interrupted them, a shivering premonition that if they didn’t get back to John’s bed soon, they would forget how, washed over him again.
; inconvenient, return to later), meaning Mrs. Hudson was probably enjoying one of her herbal soothers by now, cooking finished and ‘her boys’ taken care of.
John snorted in disbelief. Sherlock paused mid-rant.
The house either resonated with the television — overloud when Anne fell asleep in front of it (some daytime rubbish she put on as much to keep him company in the next room as for herself, often left blaring when she left that John never bothered to shut off) — or the ticking of the antique carriage clock, only keeping the right time because John had wound it (maybe for the first time in a decade) his first night here. They washed his dad and turned him to prevent bedsores. With Anne’s help, they changed the sheets that second Monday, making smalltalk about the lads in the army with him and her own son who was dating a ‘no-good’ girl that, by the sound of it, was only keen on him for the free lifts to and from her job at the chemist’s.
With a smirk, Billy turned to look at him again. ‘Don’t I know it.’
‘Mr. Holmes, we have been tracing Baron Gruener’s movements for nearly a decade.’ (Interesting: ‘we’, the government? the security services? Evidently Damery’s role was more active than garden party host.) ‘He is, as I’m sure you know, at this moment residing in this country. But we must not treat this issue as a

‘I can’t fall asleep with you just
He pulled the car into gear again and followed the directions given them at the gate to one of the two forks in the path as it curved away from the house – no doubt to preserve the view and the grounds, as they backed up to the park (Gruener was, after all, entirely consumed by his efforts to present a beautiful, established, unassailable façade).
He quite agreed. (But why was she uncertain? Which ‘nonsense’ precisely? They were quite plainly present, and for the most part accounted for. Was she… disappointed in him for getting injured? (He was unimpressed with his own combat skills, so quickly atrophied after over two years honing them in more dire circumstances than a bright but overcast alley off Camberwell.) Was she… The strain of trying to interpret the infinity of uncertainties that might plague his affectionate but currently hovering and therefore unwelcome housekeeper was already exhausting him.) He shut his eyes.
By the time they lay back down, Sherlock was shivering beneath his fingers, face tucked in once more to John’s neck, breathing jaggedly.
Sherlock tried to kiss him, to smother the words on John’s tongue by swallowing them whole so he wouldn’t be able to find them again, but John was kissing his jaw, his earlobe, and Sherlock whined and choked down a pocket of air and fisted his hand in John’s shirt so hard his fingers cramped.
With a rustle of wings which sent a newspaper and some toast crumbs to the floor, Flint shuffled and hooted in a half-hearted attempt at flight, making her way to where Sherlock’s bow hand had been resting near the table edge. He offered her his sleeved wrist, onto which she mounted, while he relished the opportunity to ignore Mycroft as ostentatiously as possible.
Assuredly, Mycroft rolled his eyes. Excellent. Maybe for once a popular misconception would turn out to be true and his face would get stuck that way.
Some tight, long-suffocating band across his chest seemed to loosen. Was that… progress? John thought back to previous fights on this same subject. They had, at least, managed to sort out where the boundaries were. ‘

, that John was in this for real.
She wasn’t wearing make-up, he noticed more clearly under the fluorescent light. But her hair was in its usual iron-straight ponytail. (How she kept it so tidy, he’d never know. Harry’s hair had tended to tangle ferociously when they were kids, leading to an immensely unfortunate phase of perms and hair spray that made her look more like candy floss than a person.)
No. He refused to let it be like that. ‘

With men, though, it was all about skin, and muscle — about pushing and feeling the other person push back; the otherwise illicit feeling of one long bare arm or leg wrapped around you, yours around him, unimpeded by fabric or fear; sweat across undulating ripples of smooth, taut muscle over bone, all escalating pressure and tension; how they defied your sense of inside/outside, soft/hard, pain/pleasure, hot/cold,

A storm breaks, a case is solved, but what difference does it make?
‘Well,’ Mrs Hudson pronounced, a little uncertainly to John as Sherlock (rejoining the present) settled back into the cushions. ‘I’m very glad to have you boys home at last. Even after all this nonsense — I nearly lost track of the days!’
At the exact same moment, Sherlock turned, parrot swaying on his shoulder as if in a stiff breeze, and announced loudly, ‘We need to speak to Lady Morcar.’
The clock was ticking vexatiously loudly.
‘Sherlock!’ John called, climbing the stairs.
‘The maiden tribute of modern Babylon,’ mused Mycroft grandly.
Suddenly the warm pressure on his leg, the inner seam of his dark jeans (hence why he’d worn them), made him freeze slightly at the novelty. They were not especially demonstrative in public, despite the fact that, at home at least, they sat with skin in contact as often as not. Here though, to have John at his side, pressed somewhat needlessly up against him, nattering away and laughing with Mike and another doctor about texting and sisters and holidays and television, while all the time John’s hand was firmly rested across the splay above his knee… intoxicating, far beyond what the ‘dainty’ beverage in front of him could hope to accomplish. It certainly mitigated the mundanity of increasingly
‘Back to the living?’ present-John inquired. His hair was doing a sort of upward swoopy thing, and he was considering Sherlock with his cheek in his hand, fingers squishing endearing lines up around the natural ones: overall, a look that made Sherlock’s stomach flip at the same speed he lost the sharper aspects of his vocabulary.

, thought John selfishly, as Sherlock nipped instead at John’s abdomen in a way that went straight to his cock.
(The nasty egg on Sherlock’s right parietal, on the other hand, was buried beneath his tangled mop of curls. John had checked it before getting up for his shower this morning, grateful at least that Sherlock slept soundly enough not to protest John’s probing fingers along his scalp. He doubted he’d be able to get away with it now, even under the guise of seduction.)
Hello, fellow escapists. Isn't the world grand?
‘The world is fleeting,’ informed a voice at his side. The abbot (how odd: the man looked so like the vicar of Sherlock’s foggy, impatient childhood recollections, despite bearing the same title — the same light spectacles (and deep scholarly depressions at the sides of his nose); the same face rounded and creased with age, complete with kind (how was that?) eyebrows; both shorter and pudgier than Sherlock, exuding a patience and gentleness that Sherlock never had) was watching the ceremony — the proceedings were too orchestrated, voices in quiet unison as well as chant-and-response, to be anything else — rather than him.
‘And what about your own reputation?’ Sherlock attempted, now casting his eyes around in ostentatious appraisal of the majesty of the Baron’s accomplishments. (Of course he really was hedging for time: he hadn’t worked out more than that Gruener — likely — wouldn’t keep the book/collection/album/records of his conquests in the display cases (too risky for the sacred objects); nor in the black album — though no doubt he amused himself with that red herring…) ‘You are clearly a man of intelligence. Surely you would prefer to have your smooth waters remain smooth? Your fiancée’s family is one of the most powerful in England: they will make things very difficult for you, dredging up the submerged past and bringing it to the light.’
chasing him from room to room. ‘When — before. I made an error in judgment, failing to tell you, but… I was certainly always working towards Baker Street.’
Then, reaching the most uncomfortable part of the plan, he sat down. ‘Once we can encourage him to parrot, as it were, your words, you’ll have to teach the actually relevant phrases. The, erm… endearments, that I suspect Flint was taught expressly for
‘Dinner?’ John asked, recalling Sherlock to this present. ‘Are you eating? Though…’ he looked around, taking in the sitting room more fully for the first time, ‘I take it we’ll have to find somewhere that would allow you to bring five massive books to the table?’
‘Right, he is incredibly smug, won’t bother to deny that, but he’s not totally –’
‘Very satisfactory,’ he informed John, who was after all the only person (aside from Stamford) he felt obliged to speak to this evening. Unless someone did something interesting, he was here to observe, think, and keep John company. And then promptly leave.
Sherlock would never have let that answer go, would have stared him down, but Harry waited only a heartbeat before she made a tiny noise of disbelief, took another aggressive sip of her water-with-lime, and looked away.
, for perhaps the first time, John Watson would fall back in a retreat. ‘We have got a while to work out the specifics. I’m not exactly in a rush.’
His absent-mindedness had been fully interrupted by the argumentative salesclerk at the Alpha Exotic Pets emporium, who had required a great deal of flattery, persuasion, and finally wagering before he agreed to give Sherlock what he needed. Thus he returned to a hideously overcrowded Goodge Street, arms inconveniently full, before he eventually managed to secure a cab and shut out the tedious masses and redirect himself homeward.

‘For the past two years or so, yes.’
‘Your way,’ John muttered, marching around the final, stalling car and ducking inside. ‘Always your way.’
Early the next morning, though, he was stopped in his departure by the sight of (now, seven) monks adorned with the most absurd looking gold and yellow hats, a bit like a golden, velvet imitation of a centurion’s plume, once again peering over the ornament. With horror, he realised they were sweeping the sand into a heap — long gentle brushstrokes with a paintbrush or similar implement, and they were reducing their meticulous handiwork to a pile of mixed multicoloured granules!
A quick glimpse at the kitchen saw virtually nothing moved, except – John’s mouth quirked in satisfaction – a single dirty knife discarded beside the sink. Sherlock had
. Except Sherlock’s mood hadn’t radiated disappointment—his closed-off eyes and small, downturned mouth, even his tired shoulders and leaden step, pointed away from that scenario.
Over the last fifty-six days, John’s interest in dogs that they happened to come into contact — or even eye-line — with, had risen proportionally to his (ineffective) attempts to disguise that interest. The catalysing incident had been a case during which, stashed overnight in a barn at a preeminent thoroughbred stable in Yorkshire, an infamously vicious dog (a mixed-breed Alsatian and Bullmastiff) had made for Sherlock, only to sniff his hand and, as it were, jog on. John’s audible sigh of relief had been slightly a bit excessive: dogs had been Sherlock’s first (love, he might have said, to John privately, but more importantly his first) species study in reading cues. Knowing — or rather, being told — from an early age that his ability to interpret emotions and thereby predict actions was ‘inadequate’ [a word that had burned onto his mind in bright red official ink, bleeding through every page of his self-assessment], he had turned to dogs. Dogs were simpler, tended not to mind of you spent hours with them observing their responses, and had been thoroughly studied, meaning there was a mass of literature on ‘Knowing Your Dog’ that Sherlock had been able to consume in order to verify his own findings. By the time of the dog in the night-time, nothing happened, as Sherlock had known from the dog’s body language it would. But John had seemed to consider it a brush with a mauling.
Quick costumes changes were in fact a forté of his. Thus Sherlock deftly thumbed himself out of his shirt and just-dry cleaned trousers and socks, sitting back from John, divested of all of it in record time. All the while John, leant back on his heels, was watching this with charcoal eyes, less than adroitly removing his own (ridiculous) cardigan and shirt and

Just as he was falling asleep, the tread of familiar footfalls sounded the approach. The shudder of the doorhandle heralded the sudden silhouette of Sherlock, who charged, eyes front in the dark, to climb over the duvet and curl from nose to knees into the blanketed angles of John’s body. (He should be lying on his side.) John blinked, instantly very awake, at the ceiling, and waited to hear what – if anything – Sherlock wanted to say.

‘Wait,’ John had croaked. Sherlock had stilled. ‘Just… just give me a, a minute, and I…’ He had swallowed thickly, and worked through four therapy-approved breathing cycles. Then, at last, he had exhaled, ‘

minutes, which meant it might have been a whole ten minutes since the worst thing that had ever happened to him had happened
He refused to dignify that with a reply.
‘Thank you,’ was all John said, voice thick but steady. ‘For telling me.’
John couldn’t help a groan from curling his toes with frustration.
‘My research has shown that parrots are best trained through use of two speakers, one of whom the parrot will mimic in an attempt to converse with the former.’ Obviously, the bird would want to talk to him, having already identified him as friendly, therefore John would need to say the relevant phrases.
(John was standing, silent, only a few hands’ breadths away, but Sherlock felt strangely isolated, as though a current of cold, stiff air was circling around himself, separating him from the warm, vibrant passion play going on at an imponderable distance. He could barely discern John’s measured inhale/exhalations from the criminal’s between them. Some dislocated part of Sherlock’s chest ached for no reason he could accurately describe.)
‘Carbuncle,’ Sherlock corrected. ‘And Braithwaite is her surname; “Lady Morcar” is her formal designation when she isn’t present.’
Moving slowly about the room, he inclined his head.
, he realised, squinting in the half-light of the candles.
John munched on his toast and tried not to fidget uncomfortably.
He cleared his throat and steeled himself. ‘Flint was fluent with the phrase, “I love you, Papagena”, which I imagine was part of Baker’s personal request.’ He felt John’s eyes on him and hoped that he didn’t seem as childish as he sounded to himself. Even with the desperation of his bone-deep
He blinked. Sherlock was watching him again, grey-green-blue-brown eyes gone large and receptive like saucers (flying saucers, more like). John’s skin itched all over.
‘It’s the Carbuncle!’ she told him, wholly unnecessarily.
A longer chapter -- blame John, his head's all over the place -- because I've been gone, passing exams and revising this chapter to intersect a few additional places with series 4 (though again, LOTS of this was all already here before S4 aired).

With a sharp jolt, he awoke, disorientated and overwarm and grunting as Sherlock slipped between his thighs, his cock thrusting as John’s pressed up against his own belly, already hard and leaking.
‘That brother of yours,’ she tsked. ‘Rather a cold fish, isn’t he?’
(Gruener’s vulpine eyes had glimmered with mirth as he struck a match, lit, and inhaled deeply, almost soundlessly; Sherlock had despised him instantly, imagined taking one of his glass-fronted pictures, smashing it over his head and twirling it — after taking the cigarette for himself, of course.)

And then, of course, he’d found vast new, deeper oceans of loneliness he could drown in after walking away from Bart’s two years after that, the millstone round his neck dragging him down. Sure, he got better at carrying it. But it was just possible, he could admit to himself with the sound of Sherlock’s slowing, medicated breathing filling the room, that the danger of carrying that unrelenting grief for so long was that it got too familiar: that you stopped trying to fight it.

‘You make me happy by existing,’ John returned, hands clinging tight to the nape of Sherlock’s neck, where the beautiful rough callus from his violin was already a little fainter than just a month ago. ‘Even when I’m also furious, you make me happier every day than I have ever been anywhere else –
John eyed the stone over Challa’s shoulder, then looked at Sherlock seriously. ‘You’re sure this is the real stone?’ he asked.

Plan A was not without flaws.
And that was the crux of the problem: Sherlock adored John. He wanted him, desperately (he had, he was forced to admit, with the taste of John’s skin full in his mouth, for far more than 800 days). But he was not safe. Bergen, Miami, Belgrade: he had been beaten to a pulp in all three of those places, in addition to other activities about which he did not want John ever to know. He had been without John all that time, wanting him, but the idea that John wanted to follow him – intoxicating as it was – could only bring John to harm.
Without any evidence, he was indeed counting on a bluff based entirely on his own, as-yet unfounded certainty. Fortunately for them all — except of course Gruener — his certainty was worth more than most.

Sherlock, hand holding lightly but firmly above John’s side as though he meant to grip there and propel himself up towards John’s mouth (not a bad idea), had his thumb grazing slightly to curve over John’s hipbone where the hollow of his skin was humid and hyper-sensitive, and looked up: his eyes were fountain water around jet black discs of pupils. John tugged lightly at Sherlock’s mussed hair, trailing in loops up and in and out and down and up. With each stroke he confirmed inwardly that his ability to hold everything he felt for Sherlock inside himself was rapidly deteriorating. Sometimes it threatened to explode his skin from within, sending bits of himself across 221b like a bomb blast. (As his dreams proved, such a thing was easy to picture.) Yet somehow even now his own body felt enormous, his toes miles and miles away, across the confused, bumbling mountain range of both their skin, and beyond them Sherlock’s paler knobblier feet, and between here and there Sherlock was looking at him hungrily under long eyelashes and John imagined the tectonic shift that would erupt if he gave in and rolled himself up to cover Sherlock’s body with his and kiss him until they could go again.
For two weeks — the entirety of his allotted him, ticking away — he watched his father’s laboured, unchanging breathing, then went back to attempting to make some sort of dent in the mountain of work to be done setting the house to rights. He and Anne went about it methodically, taking shifts by the bedside, where the frustration of groans and needs of his father’s struggling body were the only difference in the room apart from the gradual slide of the sunlight down and then up the wallpaper. John boxed up all the clothes for Oxfam, packaged the photos and posted them to his paternal aunt in Dundee — not that she would be all that interested, but she hadn’t come down to help out and say goodbye to her only sodding brother, so John wasn’t sure he cared much what she did. (He kept a few nice ones, cherrypicked out of the piles he waded through, to make an album of his own to keep.)
’S’nice.’
For a moment he loses his words. Again, for a sharp and staggering flash, his mind seizes with the call Sherlock would have had to make—

‘I know,’ John murmured, ‘I know, it’s okay. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.’ He sat firmly on the patch of mattress by Sherlock’s hip, and his forehead brushed against Sherlock’s temple as they leaned towards each other. Both of their breathing was thick and close, but the psychosomatic effects on Sherlock’s chest were manifold.
Chapter 10: Sherlock
‘Oh good, a long lie-in,’ joked John, but he was finding it hard to maintain any kind of deadpan when the dark curls of Sherlock’s forehead were trailing lightly along his chest in exactly the direction inversely proportional to his pulse. As Sherlock’s lips brushed his navel, his glorious Stradivarius hands rubbed small circles into the outsides of John’s thighs. John’s head hit the mattress with a coil of bedsprings.

Sergeant Challa, on the other hand, was rising in his esteem with every encounter. Today marked a new acme in his opinion of her.
There was no clear grammatical way to refute what John said whilst reasserting Sherlock’s statement, but nor was there any plausibility to blaming the thudding in his chest on his recent cardiac history.
God, if anyone had told him a year ago that he’d be standing in black tie after the opera at just before midnight having Sherlock Holmes beg him to bugger him, he would have broken their nose before they’d finished their sentence. Somehow it was a sobering thought.

His words rang for a second between them, lingering in the air like an accusation he hadn’t meant at all.
John makes certain not to move away or lessen his grip, even though he could probably breathe a little better if he slid back a centimetre or two.
‘Hardly Nietzsche,’ Sherlock said drily. John snorted. He felt too good, too wrung out in the best possible way, to debate the reading level of his own thoughts, or the larger unspoken question of what exactly they were doing, had done, were going to do now. His eyes were already falling shut. He rolled onto his side, facing Sherlock, beneath the covers.

No, the safety of their home was the best bet, not least because, if things went even a little bit well, he wanted to take his time with Sherlock on the sofa.

A while later a rustle of sheets and limbs from the bedroom signalled just in time: he turned to turn and catch the sight of a bleary-eyed, tousle-haired consulting detective awakening to the world after a full fifteen hours dead to man and beast.
Sherlock snorted. ‘I knew they were books, and therefore unlikely to merit the level of subterfuge it would require to replace them in whatever carefully-tripped trap you had set for me.’
She seemed no happier with this excuse than he was, but she nodded with pursed lips, and then got into the arriving lift with a sombre wave.

What he heard himself say, softly, was instead, ‘We can’t keep the bird, Sherlock.’
His nose wrinkled in exactly the same way, John recognised from the single baby picture he had ever seen of his friend, he had always done. (If Sherlock ever had a child, John was certain they would inherit this same endearing facial quirk along with the curls, insufferability, and IQ.)

thought about lots of things, largely within the realm of fantasy: how many buttons down from Sherlock’s collar he could persuade him to leave open at their next crime scene (a test of his own will-power as much as anything); and lately, about if Sherlock had ever been with a woman (if he’d been with Irene; though when John had wanked angrily to the idea, he found himself picturing one of Mary’s friends, Janine, whose dark-creamy-olive skin and dark-silken hair and amazing dark-against-light breasts would look mind-blowing while Sherlock fucked her, first with his long gorgeous fingers and then his indecently talented mouth until she came while John fucked Sherlock from behind, shoving him forward and his tongue deeper into her until he whined and came at the same moment as John, choking John’s name…).

Rolling his eyes, Sherlock pushed the unoccupied desk chair out so that they were next to each other at the corner of the table, then took the inquisitive-eyed bird gently from his cage, allowing him to step timidly up his arm. Sherlock waited. After a moment, John – in a well-practised move – uncrossed his arms, sighed, and sank into his chair. (His knee was perilously close to Sherlock’s knee, but, Sherlock swallowed, his pride at having contributed to the case was no doubt affecting his haptic awareness.)
‘HA!’ she half-shrieked, and an older woman at the table next to them glared. No wonder their waiter had disappeared. ‘I texted! I phoned! Just because your cocky soldier ego wouldn’t let you ask for help doesn’t mean I didn’t offer! And

They chatted for the rest of the meal, in hushed voices with carefully wielded cutlery, about the most recent information they found — Molly had made up a helpful mnemonic for keeping etchings and engravings straight —, about the change in weather as autumn arrived in earnest, about spicy food and how Sherlock had appreciated her bringing it when he’d been in hospital, and about what, exactly, the hell they planned to do tomorrow.
(One more deduction there than he’d been expecting. He made a mental note to send a gift around the middle of April.)
Sherlock sniffed sceptically at John’s sternum. ‘Oranges.’
‘Said he couldn’t stand the sound of the pages turning.’
‘I’m bored,’ said Flint.

‘Hmm,’ noted Sherlock succinctly.

Sleep rolled over him with the theme of the strings replaying in his head.
forcing them into an awkward tussle in which his left shoulder got badly wrenched — he kicked backwards —
After a long moment staring at him, Danube eyes pouring into Sherlock’s as though speaking some otherworldly language of which Sherlock was still only a novice, John replied quietly, ‘All right. I’m gonna need a while to sort out my head on that now, but…’ He exhaled slowly, attempting resigned patience. ‘Just don’t… don’t lie to me. Okay? Please?

Yes and no: he had never stopped thinking about the case, at least during the period in which he rebuilt (far more shakily than he ever imagined possible of himself) his concentration and attention. He could pretend, though, that it was the only thing on his mind.
She nodded, muttered a small, ‘Okay, thanks,’ and, never losing the fiercely-straight posture that smacked to John of a childhood of piano lessons (and everything that kind of childhood carried along with it), pulled the cross-body purse she’d brought over her head. Dive right in, indeed.
‘Oh, you’re not an
John kissed him, deep and all-consuming, and Sherlock wrapped his arms around him and poured himself into every kiss with the desperation of a drowning man.
Sherlock frowned and burrowed shamefully into the crook of John’s neck once more, right hand holding John’s shoulderblade in his palm like a life preserver.
‘Do you have any idea how lonely I was –’
, he thought, the gambler’s thrill in his veins, and leaned in –
Even after the dust had more or less settled after their argument, the rest of the evening had buzzed with the kind of contrite intimacy they sometimes achieved after a fight in which they’d both gone further than they intended. John still rankled at the bits that had got swept half-way under the rug (namely, that Sherlock had once again withheld something — a Mary-shaped something — from him) by the need to reassure Sherlock,
He didn’t want to read between the lines, he really didn’t, but something about her practiced, dismissive attitude drew attention to itself.
Definitely, now that they’d unwound enough to be breaking out the dark humour.

‘Were you even listening to a word that just got said?’ he demanded, feeling his temper rising in spite of himself.
He didn’t much fancy that bit, necessarily, but Christopher was grunting with every swipe of John’s lips, back arching up to meet him, smelling of men’s cologne and male BO and everything so unlike John’s last few careful, causal partners, and
John turned to Sherlock. ‘Was that Latin?’
(John itched to text Sherlock. Wondered what he was doing. After several hours of radio silence, the nagging voice at the back of his mind began to whisper   several suggestions of how Sherlock might be spending these long, tempting hours before the descent on Gruener’s party this afternoon — the kinds of trouble he might get in, alone. What he got up to whenever they weren’t together, and if John really had any clue when he should be worried and when things were all right.)
And he felt certain, characterised by a growing prickling at the back of his neck (nothing to do with Flint, who was currently balancing on one leg on the handle of their (hideous) mod-era yellow lamp, echoing Sherlock’s tunes), that John was working up to a speech along the lines of ‘carried away’ and ‘moving too fast’, while Sherlock was plucking notes from his violin and muttering to himself in order to give himself something to do rather than tear his own hair out at the madness of ‘too fast’.

‘How much notice?’ Sherlock demanded in a rumble.

here anymore; John’s room was more often than not a changing room, an overlarge closet versus where they actually slept together — and slept at all —, in Sherlock’s room). His deep, steadying huff was nearly as loud as John’s, though he seemed to have tried to mute it by exhaling through his nose. John didn’t look round.
‘Ridiculous.’
‘Besides,’ John added, ‘if we don’t get anything concrete tonight, there’s still time for them to pick him up in the morning. Make it look like he disappeared.’
John scooted forward, putting his left hand gently on Sherlock’s lower belly and curling up against his side. He felt Sherlock turn his head slightly so that his forehead met John’s. Their knees met through their respective clothes, huddled together like kids running away from home, gravitated towards the warmth of each other without intent or momentum. Maybe because he hadn’t slept since Thursday night — and, even then, he’d been kipping pretty uncomfortably at the hospital for days— or maybe because the tiny glow of light that crept under the door, around the blinds, gave the darkness a golden halo. He felt like time was slowing to a halt. Giving them a moment together, in a dream-spun version of reality inhabited by just them.
It wasn’t so surprising to John, which almost certainly meant it was zero percent surprising to Sherlock. The question of what to

Re-emerging, he felt an unusual craving for food. (A perfectly acceptable tin of cake frosting and some of John’s ‘nutrition’ exercise bars (the things were stuffed with all sorts of sugars and preservatives: the only sense in which they were ‘nutritional’ was in the definitional sense, that any edible object had various properties which would, in a pinch, prevent a human being from starving) sufficed for a small breakfast. Fortunately these were the nice ones, with dark chocolate and cherries.)
Sherlock blinked. His blinking function seemed to be the only thing operating; his mind had gone entirely blank.
John felt a shiver of cold down his spine, going through several possible ends to that sentence and refusing to jump to any conclusions.
The kettle went. John took over, and Molly nodded gratefully and went to sit down with a

shut downstairs, he pivoted, with more than usual carefulness, to look at John, who was, as expected, scowling.
‘I will,’ Sherlock vowed, and something in John’s gut flared hot and quick as he pieced this back together with his accidentally kinky show of hand, and he smirked so hard his teeth hurt.
‘Thanks,’ John interrupted, backing off a step as if scalded and with the same force, switching off the lights that had reflexively come on when they’d made eye contact, ‘thanks a lot.’ He held out the stain-remover pen. ‘Sorry you, er — you lost your spot in the queue.’
‘Mike says hello,’ John informed him, hanging up his coat.
The reverberation of John’s voice suggested he was facing the door — still sitting up, looking away —
