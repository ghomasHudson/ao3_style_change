Steve misses Tony like a part of him has gone and died. His classmates barely spare him a glance, always scrambling to make sure they don’t wind up in his orbit.
Steve doesn’t dress up often and since they’re meeting up on the rooftop, that could only mean one thing.
Tony imagines himself making a dumb quip about the predicament they're in. He could imagine Steve breaking into laughter, imaging Steve tossing his work away to kiss the life out of Tony and—
Tony reaches out, curling his fingers around Steve’s wrist, putting a stop to his escape. Fortunately for him and his hand, Steve doesn’t fight him off.
Of course she’s Tony’s…girlfriend. Of course. This woman is gorgeous, someone Tony the press would say would go for. Why would Steve think otherwise?
Kamala blushes, her cheeks almost the color of her shalwar kameez. “Thanks. I told my mom I was going to a friend’s party and she took me shopping so uh… Yeah.”
It’s been a long time since Tony’s felt this embarrassed, flattered, and thrilled. Compliments from Steve isn’t new for Tony. He and the rest of the Avengers have been on the other end of it one too many times before.
Steve’s fears only get worse as the days go by. Unlike the rest, she’s tight-lipped, refusing to divulge the identity of Tony’s date or any details about the date. The only thing she’s willing to share is that she'll be stopping by the Tower to pick Tony up.
Clint snorts. “Wouldn't surprise me. Bobbi would take any opportunity to embarrass me. It's cool. It's all lies, anyway.” He grins, patting Steve on the thigh. “Sides’, gotta keep our great leader’s spirits up. The sulking's just—
Tony sighs, crumpling his empty can and tossing it into the nearest recycling bin. So much for finally making his move.
Just like every morning, Tony swiftly polishes his first mug of coffee in three gulps. The fog behind his eyes clears considerably.
As fun as it is to see what the Tower looks like if it was built with plastic bricks, Tony can’t help but turn away whenever Lego Steve and Tony flirt or happily bicker. Even the Funkos seem to join in, noisily chattering in that gibberish they use to communicate. Funkolish or whatever.
Is Tony trying to tell him what Steve thinks he’s going to say? Is Tony finally going to tell him that he and Carol are dating? He did mention Carol, after all. Steve can’t imagine Tony being this nervous about anything else besides—
“Everything all right there?” Tony calls out from the bench, looking and sounding worried. Next to him, Johnny’s grinning, looking like a cat who just ate a canary.
The door behind them slides open. Tony would’ve broken his back if Steve hadn’t steadied him in time.
Reed’s lips quirk to the side. “It’d be bad-mannered of me to not congratulate you. I’m sure Susan wouldn’t be happy with me if she knew.”
The last time they were here, it was days before everything fell apart, days before Loki and destruction, days before Steve was called away to work and Tony to SHIELD.
Things have been better lately, but only because both of them have been avoiding the elephant in the room, electing professionalism whenever their paths cross.
Steve smiles ruefully. “Yeah. Finding a piano was difficult when you’re on the road and away from the city very often. But it was fun when I could. I remember the first time I did it. Had to convince myself I didn’t just dream up the last couple of minutes or the applause.”
Tony’s lips thin. “Yeah. I guess. Anyway, not the point. I didn’t come here to prod at you. I just wanted to ask if you want to grab breakfast with me. You missed it today.” His eyebrows knit together. “You hardly miss breakfast.”
Steve could do that if Tony likes that kind of thing. He could grow his hair out like Thor and learn to flip his hair. That is, if he needs to learn that sort of thing. Judging by the stare Tony trains her way, Steve's awfully tempted to do just that.
“And you proved me wrong,” Steve replies firmly. “I was wrong about a lot of things about you. I remember when you almost died saving me. All I could think of is how much I regret saying all those terrible things to you. How much I wanted to get to know you. To make it up to you for the rest of my life.”
Their lips part at the impact and Tony couldn’t help but break into a giggle. Steve follows suit, burying his face in the crook of Tony’s neck with ease, like it’s where he belongs.
Frankly, if anyone told Tony that he’d be carried out of a burning building, well, he would’ve laughed in their faces. And if they were being extra mean about it, he probably would’ve even thrown them across the Atlantic.
“Cap and Iron Man aren’t friends,” says some kid, cutting Miles off. “They hate each other. Why’re you saying they are friends?”
Tony hasn’t drunk a single drop of alcohol in six months. Everyone’s going to freak when they find out. Everyone at AA is already acting like he won the lottery.
Tony quickly collects himself, snorting in response. “Didn’t I tell you that the best kind of entrance is a fashionably late one?”
But then suddenly Carol’s at his side, excusing the both of them and drags him over to where the food is.
He watches her step back inside, joining Natasha and Sue by the nacho bowl. She must’ve said something because their heads whip in Steve’s direction, their smiles a mirror of hers.
It’s bad enough that all of Tony’s previous dates are all smart and fierce and beautiful and leagues above Steve. But to see him with a man who embodies all of those traits is just...just...
Tony cocks an eyebrow, wishing he had his helmeted head screwed on. Instead, he lies back down on top Miles’ pencil case. “Jealous? Why would I be jealous?”
It’s nice. Both familiar and different. It’s funny how this is what distracts Steve. Yet his contentment, he can’t help but feels like something’s missing.
Steve nods enthusiastically. “It’s really, really good,” he replies. Tony shouldn’t find it as adorable as he should.
She flashes them a beam before turning away, giving them as much privacy as one could get in a bakery.
“I remember,” Tony replies dully, trying hard not to think of the countless fights they had over that. “And this program… It turned you to—to this?”
“For my first Christmas since the forties, he booked the Met for the day. It was the first time I really wanted to kiss him.”
Steve isn’t always lonely. Sometimes, his friends set him up with strangers and acquaintances. Other times, he takes someone home for the night.
They head down to the living room where the rest of the Avengers are gathered except for Tony and Sam, who’s only returning to the Tower the day after tomorrow. Clint, Thor, and a dehulked Bruce whirls around, pausing their video game.
“I can tell.” Tony’s eyes dart to Steve. “Well, you cleaned up nicely. Gotta hot date yourself too?”
She arches an eyebrow. “Army guys and I don’t really get along but I guess we could probably work something out. If Rhodey and Tony find you alright, so can I.” She turns away, reaching for the pancake batter. “So, what has Tony said about me? Good things, I hope.”
“Nope. Not in the slightest.” He sighs against his lips and fuck, he is warm and he smells faintly of pine and vanilla – a combination Tony never thought could make him weak in the knees. He can’t imagine how overwhelming it’ll be when the scent blocker fades away.
Once again, Tony sighs, his fingers rubbing at his temples. Steve expects a lecture after. What he gets instead is Tony on his tip-toes, pecking Steve on the lips.
“We’re toys,” Endgame Steve says exasperatedly. “It doesn’t matter which franchise or media we come from. Besides, your Steve’s from the Infinity War line.”
Somehow, it does the trick. They don't bring Tony or Bobbi up during dinner (meatballs wins) or when they pile in the living room to watch the latest Sherlock Holmes movie, which ruins his mood even further.
“Asshole,” Tony mutters, spinning on his heel. “Fine. Be like that. Whatever. Good talk. Now shoo. I have—”
“Okay, fine. He won’t,” Tony admits. “Steve’s way too nice for that. But he’ll definitely me those eyes. You know the ones he has on every time he looks super guilty? And fuck, he’s going to pity me. Goddamn it, Nat. This is going to be super embarrassing. I should’ve planted mistletoe instead.”
It’s bizarre enough that Fury’s all smirks and wishes about the whole thing. It’s so much weirder when their enemies act in a similar fashion.
They usually take turns getting dinner together. While Tony leans towards more expansive and refined options, Steve’s tastes are much simpler. This year, he's opted for burgers and fries for himself and a homemade blend of cow’s blood, pomegranate, and strawberries for Tony. Just the sight of the crimson liquid being poured into his wine glass has Tony salivating.
From the corner of Tony’s eyes, he watches Natasha roll her eyes. “Okay, everyone. Let’s give them some space. Back to the toybox we go.”
“I know. I know now. You know you mean the world to me too, right? I never stopped thinking about you.”
It’s a thought that’s been circling Tony’s mind since the moment he was shot out of the sky. Rhodey had insisted on accompanying him like he always does. Tony had been dangerously arrogant, insisting Rhodey take on a nearby convoy instead. After all, Tony’s done this one too many times before. He could destroy Nazi bases with his eyes closed if he tried.
“Hey. Friendly competitions are how we let loose,” Clint says, clapping Tony on the shoulder. “We’ll relax your way when we settle this. So come on, chop-chop!”
“Oh,” he breathes out, his voice barely a whisper. “I thought you knew. ‘Cause you know, super senses.”
Steve frowns. He hates it when Tony brushes off any concerns about himself. The fact that he'd rather compromise his safety over creepy pumpkin lights says a lot about Tony as a person.
Tony doesn’t notice him at first, too busy catching his breath and wringing water out of his clothes. But as he ruffles his hair, scanning the midday crowd, his gaze stumbles upon a pair of clear azure eyes.
There are faint circles under Steve’s eyes, the weariness clearer in the blue. His hair’s a little wild, and his shoulders a little slumped, a little defeated. Tony feels the same way.
Steve curls his lips downwards, hiding himself behind his tankard. “Great. Thanks for putting that picture in my head, Stark.”
“Why is that old man even flirting with him?” Tony mutters under his breath, staring at the two from Kamala’s Captain Marvel planner. “Isn’t he married? Pepper would have his wrinkly—”
Consciousness creeps in hazily. Judging by the steady beeping and the white walls, he’s in the tower’s infirmary.
The fire in Storm’s eyes diminishes at that, his posture relaxing. Steve’s thankful. Pepper and SHIELD will kill him for trying to fistfight the Human Torch on the helipad of Avengers' Tower.
He stays by his side throughout the night, laughing and chatting and god, Steve could take him somewhere private, take his hand, and tell him that—
Seriously, what is with all of the Steves and Tonies flirting in front of him? They don’t need to flaunt their perfect relationship and perfect banter and their perfect everything in front of him. He gets it. He got the short end of the stick. It happens.
But his brain can’t stop thinking about the fact that Carol isn’t supposed to be here in the first place, appearing out of the blue because she so ‘happened to be in town’. And since she happens to be staying over for the week, an invitation has to be extended. After all, what can Steve say?
Thor goes next, claiming seniority because of course, he does. No one bothers to argue because he’s the God of Thunder.
the one who’s out of your league. Fuck, I’m not even in the same ballpark as you. I’m like on the other end of the planet.”
Neither of them makes a move for a long moment. For an excruciating moment, he expects Steve to finally put Tony out of his misery, to seal their lips together. Instead, Steve shifts his attention back to the piano.
“I’m so happy for you guys, Mr Stark. Captain Rogers. Oh, yeah. Captain Rogers, if you hurt Tony again, I’ll—”
“You’re laughing with your eyes. That counts.” Tony wiggles on the spot and unfortunately rolls off the mountain of lights in the process.
“Shit,” he mutters to himself, jabbing at the elevator buttons, whiling, hoping that it’ll come. It better come because goddamn it—
Mates who’d be furry and smelly and enjoy roaming around in the woods for the rest of eternity. Not bloodsucking nocturnals who fly around and live in graveyards.
Steve smiles but it’s uneasy. “What can I say? I’m your fucking self-sacrificing idiot.” His body goes taut. “I mean, unless you, uh…”
friends, and roommates. He can’t imagine if they actually did something dumb like date each other. They probably would’ve only lasted a month or two. Maybe a year, at most.
It all happens in a blur. One moment, he’s yelling at JARVIS to boost his thrusters. The next thing he knows, he's pushing Barnes away from MODOK’s lasers and then pain, so much pain and there’s so much yelling and why is Steve screaming? Why is he crying? Tony just saved his soulmate’s life? He should be grateful. He should be thankful. He should—
“Tony told me to check on you. Said you randomly disappeared on him and Carol after breaking the bar table.”
The hope on Tony’s face instantly vanishes. He hastily jumps to his feet, brushing the blades of grass clinging to his pants. “I knew this was a bad idea. I mean, you definitely took it as a joke and you totally didn’t mean to—”
“Oh you know,” Tony replies airily. “Just needed a breather. You know how annoying people can be sometimes.”
It shouldn’t have gone beyond Hammer. Everyone knows Hammer’s an idiot. People would’ve definitely bought Steve’s lie as well, a lie, coming out of Hammer’s lips. And if there were eavesdroppers, Tony could easily buy them off.
“Raincheck,” Tony says, staving off the emotions building up inside him. “You’re still in town on Friday?”
He’s a sobbing mess after that, clutching onto her like she’d disappear. He feels terrible about ruining her birthday like this. She doesn’t need this, needs him.
He shrugs on his leather jacket, pulls on the tightest pair of jeans he owns, and heads to the nearest club he can find.
He’s well aware of his friends’ concern over his sudden change of demeanor. Hell, even Steve’s tried cornering him and blowing his phone up with calls and messages too. In the end, Tony puts a stop to it all by locking himself up in his workshop.
Maria Stark is as quiet as Tony said she is, but also gentle and beautiful. She reminds Steve of Ma.
“Let me guess,” Tony begins, itching to excuse himself, “you want me to regale our fans here about the time we—”
Tony finds him sitting at the back, nursing a mug of coffee as he bows his head, doodling on a napkin.
Tony nods tightly. “I mean, things are different now. I still have Rhodey and Jan. Mom. Pepper and Happy. And now the rest of the Avengers. But I needed my anchor, Steve. I needed the only person that made me feel real. Made me feel like I could be me. That I’m just Tony. That I’m just a fucking guy. And you’re still that person, you know. You still make me feel like I’m seven again playing fucking Pong in your bedroom under a tent we made out of your Captain America blanket.”
Instantly, Steve’s pained expression morphs into fury. “Why the hell would you think I want to be anywhere but here?”
Tony huffs. “Funny. I’m talking about, you know. Grabbing breakfast, watching a movie, taking a stroll in the park. Or something.”
Even the strange looks Steve used to shoot Jan and Tony have ebbed away. This time, he seems more genuine with his smiles and tone, even if they waver every now and then.
“Thanks, Carol,” he says, trying his best to sound warm and polite despite the fact that Tony’s dating her and what’s wrong with him, why—
“Well, you can nag me about it later,” Steve says, detaching himself from the doorframe. “Meet me up on the rooftop.”
Fortunately for both of them, Tony lands in Steve’s arms, albeit ungracefully. He flails around, steadying himself by clasping his arms around Steve’s neck.
Steve lets out a nervous chuckle. “I, er… Would you believe if I said I was the reason why you couldn’t get me alone?”
The urge to pop open the first bottle of whiskey he finds hits him like a tidal wave. Once upon a time, he would’ve zipped out of the elevator and done so without a second thought. But Tony’s sworn off alcohol for about a couple of months now and he doesn’t plan on falling off the wagon any time soon, not after all the work he’s put into staying sober.
Steve tries his best to stop his heart from further breaking as he ducks down to grab an envelope. He should be glad that Tony adores it. That’s what matters, after all. It’s why he made the card in the first place.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, his eyes roving his body in apparent concern. “I’m so sorry, Tony. I didn’t mean to—”
Nothing much happens. Nothing that he can really recall. All he remembers are the neon lights and the pulsating beats and the drinks. Fruity drinks. Spicy drinks. Drinks that burn. Drinks that make him light-headed.
It’s poetic, he thinks, that the great Tony Stark – millionaire, genius, inventor, adventurer – has finally been bested by his hubris and his heart. Many people would even say that he deserves it.
“Time flies huh,” Tony mutters to himself as he fastens his cape around his neck. “Five hundred goddamn years.”
Storm’s notoriously known for being a huge flirt. Hell, Steve’s seen him in action more times than he should. But never with a man.
The centerpiece’s a portrait of Steve and his husband, Tony Stark, stained in azure and coffee. They’re seated on the couch, holding each other’s smiles and eyes.
So it’s a surprise when the chair next to him moves and the most beautiful boy he’s ever seen settles next to Steve.
“I can’t believe we wasted five hundred years,” Steve continues. “We could’ve had— We could’ve been—”
Once upon a time, Tony would’ve turned on his heel and started walking. Running. Getting as far away as he can just to avoid a little glimpse.
Steve has envisioned their kiss countless of times before, picturing various scenarios and sensations. But he never expected to be stranded in space half-naked, to have woken up from a five-year coma, to be on the brink of death. Neither did he expect to feel the stirring in his chest, the warmth coursing through his veins, the taste of coffee to be strong on his tongue, to even taste salt at all.
He gets Natasha, Thor even. But for Bruce to agree with Clint without any hesitation is just unheard of.
taste of blood,” Steve breathes, tightening his grip on Tony’s waist and god, Tony wants. He wants and needs everything.
“So,” he begins, breaking the silence as he settles down next to Steve, “what’d you got for us tonight?”
Steve should duck back in the back, demand his mother serve Tony while he completes his little freak-out alone. But of course, like the idiot he is, he blurts out, “It’s you,” instead.
There’s a softness behind his eyes, full of affection and warmth, one that Tony has never seen in them before. Or maybe it’s always been there. He just chose not to notice.
Being the futurist he is, Tony always knew his day would’ve come – the day when Steve would leave him for someone else.
Not for the first time, he lets himself pretend, lets himself be the man he could be for Steve, lets himself pretend that he deserves the warmth radiating from his side, the brush of fingers against his own.
“Nope. Zip it. Save it for the wedding.” Clint pauses, puckering. “Ew. I have to attend my ex-girlfriend and my friend’s wedding. Gross. Bobbi would totally make me her maid of honor because she’s a cruel—”
Steve’s lips are chapped but soft. His lips part in surprise, allowing Tony to wrap his arms around his shoulders and deepen the kiss.
The hands move to cup his cheeks. Tony gathers all his strength to keep his eyelids open to meet a pair of blue,
Howard finds out Tony’s been sending Steve letters. He puts a stop to it. Tony explodes the Chemistry lab. He gets expelled.
“You could’ve at least had the decency of ending it earlier instead of stringing me along and making me feel like a complete idiot,” Tony says, steel cold before he yanks his hand back and storms away.
He could feel Tony’s breath catch against his lips but then it’s suddenly moving. Molding. Slotting their lips and tongues together like a jigsaw puzzle.
Above them, The National is finishing their ninth sad song of the night. Somewhere in the distance, several voices are butchering the birthday song.
“You’re pretty obvious about your feelings,” Steve replies. He moves to take Tony’s hand in his. “You look at me like I’m worth something—”
Tony opens his mouth to retort, lie, explain, but like the miracle she is, she just sighs and says, “Not in the way you’re telling everyone.”
His hands begin to shake as Tony strides over towards the counter, a lazy grin plastered on his face. The familiar scent of grease and mint waft through the air as Tony closes the distance between them.
But for some reason, Natasha had barged in as he was dressing, took one brief look at him,  marched over to his wardrobe, and began to make a mess of things.
He won’t deny everything that’s happened – the hurt Steve has caused him, the way he fell off the wagon because of a broken heart, the destructive vices he picked up to numb his pain. That happened to Tony and there’s nothing he can change about that.
“Yeah. Ororo and Jan said they forgot they had a reservation at some fancy-schmancy place, Bruce had some idea he needed to write down immediately, Peter went out to get some photos of Spider-Man for the Bugle, and guess where Logan went?”
Natasha glances away from Kirk fighting Khan, sympathy written all over her face. Tony wishes he doesn’t love her enough to not call her out.
“—but the point is, I don’t get why you keep giving him such a hard time. He isn't a bad guy, you know.”
“I— I just—” Tony sighs, burying his face in a pillow. “Okay, fine. I did. Once.” He pauses. “Thrice. Sorry, Brucie Bear. Please don’t kill me. We didn’t do anything just now if—”
Steve almost claps his hand over his mouth as once again, several pairs of eyes zero in on him, most of them in mirth.
Steve sucks in a breath, pushing away that thought. That thought might be even worse than knowing that Tony would never love him in the way Steve wants him to.
“We should do this again with Tony,” Thor says as if reading Steve’s mind. “I would very much like to listen to his tales regarding his tenure at MIT.”
Zola sneers. “I do think that I prefer you this way, silent and pliant. I think I will like you more when we finally make you the next baron.” He sighs, pushing his slipping glasses further up the bridge of his nose. “Such a shame about your father. Now, anything you would like to tell me before we begin?”
A guttural groan tumbles out of his lips as he buries his face in his hands. “Kill me now. Just kill me now.”
Miles away, Sarah Rogers is probably rolling around in her grave at her son’s rudeness. He could imagine her chastising him in his ear.
Steve’s staring at him with a weary gaze. He’s still dressed in his uniform, blood and sweat caking his skin.
Tony would’ve argued back if Hulk hadn’t gathered them both into his arms, squeezing them with his massive, massive arms.
Things have been going so well between Tony, Bruce, and Hank. They even fell back into discussing science like old times.
He leads Steve through the exhibits, past artifacts, sculptures, and depictions of animals and humans who're long gone. They debate and joke among themselves as they do.
But then he remembers the way Tony’s features soften whenever he looks in Carol’s direction, how he easily laughed with her and let down his guard, how he leaned over to press a kiss—
Clint pretends to gag. Thor slaps him on the back anyway, spraying the whole table with Clint’s mouthful of chocolate milkshake in the process.
Tony groans, pocketing the ring box. “Jeez, Rogers. Why’d you think I brought it up in the first place? I was so gone for you back then. So,
He pulls Tony against his chest and plants the shortest but most passionate kiss Tony has ever experienced onto Tony’s faceplate, where his lips should be.
Steve places the jar onto the countertop and picks up a pair of tongs. “They’re good. And I’m not saying this because I work here or ‘cause my mom baked it. On the house, by the way.”
Tony wishes he had the energy to scoff at the ridiculous situation he's in. But with his energy slowly draining out of him, all he can think of is how he should've been less brash and arrogant.
“You know,” Tony begins. “We’ve had a lot of memories here. Like the time Odin brought Mangog with him. Good times.”
Tony's pretty sure his jaw is hanging the same way Mr Burke's is. Not for the same reasons, he's sure, but he's still stunned. It’s one thing to fake a relationship to ward off idiots like Hammer. There’s no reason for this whatsoever.
It would suck if Steve agreed to this and found out Tony was truly joking five years down the line. It would suck a lot. But it’s a notion Steve had prepared for the moment they met.
Tony always figured that if they ever were to break up, it would be like a blaze. Scorching and hot and all-too blinding. Intense like the two of them have always been.
Steve wipes his face with his hand, exhaling. “I guess I can see why it might look that way. But Bucky, he’s… He’s one of my greatest failures. I couldn’t save him and I guess… I guess if I couldn’t save him then, I could save him now.”
“Mm-hmm. Howard’s spawn. That’s me. Yup, yup.” He swipes the steaming mug of coffee off the counter before striding away. “Now, uh, if you gentlemen would excuse me, I’ll be going now.”
“Because they’re not my friends,” Tony replies, visibly exasperated. He combs his fingers through his hair, messing it up. Steve almost crumples to his knees. Steve has always been weak for messy haired Tony Stark.
Tony breaks into a grin as he begins to play. Steve echoes the melody, his lips melding into that boyish smile Tony both loves and hates.
Once again, the smile on Steve’s face fades and Tony resists the urge to slap himself, faceplate or not.
Kate crosses her arms, shooting Clint a scowl. “This dummy here wouldn’t stop pestering me for a rematch.”
Home? Tony doesn’t have a home. Not anymore. Not the little apartment in front of him. Not the lonely mansion up in Manhattan either.
“You don’t call Carol ‘Cap’,” Steve interrupts and god, he needs to stop talking right now before he messes things up even more. Somehow, his mouth seems to be on auto-pilot.
Too bad Tony was way out of his league. And too bad Tony would never, ever know how Steve felt for him.
Steve Rogers who’s mostly likely peering at him through his beard with the weirdest look on his face, waiting on Tony’s answer like an idiot.
“All the cards are here,” Steve cuts in. He jabs his index finger at the basket full of greeting cards in front of the cash register, turning away to mask his pain.
“Fine, fine.” Tony sucks in a breath, pulling out his ring box. “Steven Grant Rogers, I’ve been in love with you since the day we met and I think it’s great we’re best friends and colleagues and I think it’ll be even greater if we’d be stuck with each other for the rest of our lives. With that said, will you marry me?”
“Of course you should,” Tony says, sounding insincerely confident. “When have I ever steered you wrong?'
“You may hold this thought but I assure you, you will change your mind when you visit,” Thor replies cheerfully, clapping Steve on his back. “Now, come! I heard there are loaves of meat to feast on!”
No one bats an eyelid at them. No one thinks twice of the two men stumbling home together, drunk on alcohol and each other. Neither does Tony think of them. He’s too exhausted to think or care.
Besides the fact that Carol and Tony are stuck like glue together, (Steve couldn’t get Tony all to himself for the entire evening but whatever, he’s not upset about it, not at all) the rest of the party goes smoothly. And Steve doesn’t open Tony’s present with more enthusiasm than everyone else’s. Nor does he  pull Tony into an embrace, all because Tony remembered how much Steve was eyeing the Faber Castell Polychromos Color Pencils, let alone got him the full set for his birthday.
Tony loves with all of his heart. He loves and loves and loves until his body bleeds of it. And each time his heart breaks, he lets himself bleed and bleed until he can finally pick himself up and try again.
Steve’s eyes widen, his lips parting. It’s times like these that the vampire that turned Tony all those centuries ago actually sucked him dry.
And just like that, they fall back into their regular conversations about team dynamics, Movie Night, and the happenings around them. Because it’s Tony. Steve can never stay awkward around Tony.
Tony couldn’t help but roll his eyes. The Burkes are one of the last people he’d want to run into. They’re one of his father’s old business rivals, a rivalry he could barely give a shit about to even continue. Yet somehow, the Burkes never seem to let it go, constantly feeding his backhanded compliments and stealing his contracts.
No wait, of course he’s sure. They’re dating, after all. Of course, she’d kiss him and of course, Tony would blush and of course—
There’s a wisp of silver behind his eyes. Tony tries his best not to get caught up again, to actually say what he has been meaning to say.
“We had sex, Steven,” Tony replies dryly. “I let you put your dick in me. Multiple times. For almost a year.”
“I made a stack of inappropriate ones and secretly slide them into a pile once just to see how well it’d go.”
Just like that day they made that stupid marriage pact that’s been living in Steve’s brain for years.
“Still. You found me, Tony,” he counters. “You rescued me from being potentially struck by an asteroid.”
Tony tells her that. She shakes her head, shushes him and rocks him to sleep like she did all those years ago when he was young and felt like something.
For the next couple of days, his phone won’t stop ringing. It stops when he launches it across the room.
He has so much to tell, to tell him he's Iron Man, to tell him how much Tony loves him, how they’ve wasted so much time, how they’ll never get the chance, that the last couple of years have been the best years of his life.
Because there’s no way Steve would care for him, not in the way Cartoon Steve does for his Tony. No way at all.
Tony just never dreamt he’d be the placeholder for Steve’s childhood friend who’s supposed to be dead.
“That’s not what I was going to say,” Steve says. “I was actually going to say I’ve been in love with you for four hundred and ninety-nine years and five months. So.”
Steve nods, lacing Tony’s fingers with his. His smile is fond when their gazes meet. “Yeah. Love at first sight.”
Not even Tony’s ass in those tight, tight jeans could distract him from Tony wrapping his arms around Bobbi’s waist as she revs the engine. He could only flash them a hesitant wave as they tear down the road.
As soon as the doors shut behind him, the energy vibrating in him seeps out of him. Tony sags against the wall, heaving a sigh as the back of his head bumps against it.
Bruce’s pick is a woman named Jennifer Walters, one of the most sought-after lawyers in New York. She also happens to be Bruce’s own cousin.
Their date isn’t anywhere fancy, just their favorite diner on the outskirts of Manhattan. The interesting thing Steve noticed throughout the whole night is that it feels exactly like every other dinner they’ve gone out to, just the two of them. They'd always be chatting and bickering, making plans for after and next time, and stealing food off each other’s plates.
“I should’ve chased after you,” Tony returns. He's warm next to him, their bare skin flushed with sweat and come. “Should’ve popped up on your doorstep and asked you to run away with me. Should’ve told you how much you meant to me. I never—”
If the last several minutes were bad, this is torture. It’s a challenge to ignore how handsome Tony is up close, even harder to ignore how much Steve wants to hold him like this, to carry him up to his room to kiss him silly.
Steve hums, wrapping his arm around Tony’s waist to pull him closer to his side and oh, that’s nice. Very, very nice.
“No. I just—” Steve sighs. “Just to clarify, it’s the same for me. I fell for you not because you’re Tony Stark or Iron Man. I fell for you because you’re Tony.”
Steve follows after Tony’s descent, the notes coming from his fingertips deepening, the melody turning languid and longing. Intimate and forlorn.
Surprisingly, Tony looks downright impressed. “Gross. Gross but cool. Doubt your stomach liked that.”
And yet, there’s the rational part of Steve telling him that this has to be a dream because Tony’s taken by Carol and Steve’s… Steve’s…
That’s how he winds up in front of one of Steve’s paintings. It’s one of Steve’s comic book characters but painted in glorious red and gold acrylic. Like all of his art, it’s a masterpiece. Tony has to refrain himself from stepping over and running his disgusting fingers all over them.
The paparazzi and fans seem to have caught on to their routines. They swarm Avengers Tower like vultures. Steve and Tony barely make it out of Avengers Tower alive, only escaping when Steve scoops Tony into his arms and makes a run for it.
While he still isn’t big on the whole thing, there’s something about people socializing outside their usual group that does something to his heart. Like Clint and Scott bickering over the kitchen counter, their arms flailing in the air. Or Drax, Quill, and Thor chugging down cans and cans of beer. Or even Bruce, Rocket, and Reed chatting with plates of food in their hands.
But then he remembers the chips Pepper framed up in his bedroom and all the encouraging things people have said and takes a sip from his mug instead.
But then Thor claps Tony on the back and regales the team with every instant Steve and Tony would wax poetic about each other and Sam shoves congratulatory cookies into his face and Bruce shows up to offer his congratulations and Tony just can’t bring himself to say anything. At least not yet.
Steve who’s a comic book artist from Brooklyn. Steve who loves Tolkien’s shitty books and hates the cold. Steve who’s kind and witty and beautiful and everything Tony doesn’t deserve.
There are camera flashes everywhere. Journalists who’re eager to speak to him. Superheroes from different factions mingling. It’s all overwhelming.
Steve’s eyes are glistening, his lips parting in awe. Tony wants to kiss it off his lips, to taste love and happiness, to know what it’s like to kiss someone who cherishes him the way he cherishes them.
Endgame Steve shrugs his shoulders. “That’s the movie. We’re toys. We don’t have to conform to what the movie says. Besides, Pep’s cool with it.”
Tony barely registers the voice calling his name. He should roll over, get out of bed, and check. It could be an emergency. Hell, maybe the apartment’s on fire or they’re in the midst of being robbed.
Tony shakes his head. “No, no, no, no. Nope. You’ve gone insane. Absolutely insane. Is it the lack of oxygen? Or maybe five years in—”
“I don’t mask my heartbeat,” Steve counters. “C’mon. You’d had to know how it races when I’m around you—”
When junior prom rolls around, they ditch the whole thing to huddle at Tony’s. Tony shows Dum-E, a robot he drunkenly created, off. Dum-E ends up dumping motor oil in Steve’s smoothie. Steve and Tony spend the rest of the night laughing and falling asleep on each other.
Steve does a double-take at that. In fact, everyone’s staring at Tony in puzzlement. Except for Natasha but that's hardly surprising. Nothing fazes her.
them. He actually admires how well they work together, which makes sense considering they’re family, and well enough with the Avengers. It helps that both teams get on well with each other, going so far as to taking vacations and hosting monthly gatherings.
“The most,” Tony replies, his voice muffled by Steve’s shoulder. “And we’re gonna have more fun, so unless you wanna—”
Steve rolls his eyes as he bounds over to his wardrobe, pulling out the cleanest clothes he could find. Being in the military has turned him off from his worry of being nude. But there’s something about this conversation that makes him feel naked.
Just like with every one of Tony’s invitations, Steve perks up at the idea. But then he remembers golden blonde hair and startling blue eyes and he deflates.
If Tony’s here, he’d insist on pineapples because apparently, that’s how people eat pizzas these days. Then, Steve would argue and say that pineapples don’t belong on pizzas. Tony would roll his eyes and accuse him of being unadventurous, that Steve should—
“What I want,” he murmurs, slipping onto Steve's lap. Tony drapes his arms over his shoulders, brushing his lips against Steve's ear, “is for you to fuck me into this mattress.”
, it’s Carol who he’s sitting with on the loveseat, their heads bent together as they chat and laugh and ignore everything and everyone and life is just so—
So no one should blame him for almost walking into a wall when Tony fucking Stark shows up at his mother’s bakery one Friday night.
Time doesn’t stop. Tony wishes it did, wishes he could bottle this man up in his mind because he's just so goddamn ethereal.
Bobbi’s lips curl into a smirk. “And don’t you forget it. I didn’t think I’d be going on a date with the Avengers. And my ex-boyfriend. Again.”
At some point after Show and Tell, Miles and Kamala somehow forge a friendship of sorts. Or at least, that’s what Tony thinks so. Because one Friday afternoon, Miles returns home with Kamala in tow, the both of them armed with stacks of DVDs.
Tony almost slumps in relief at the familiar voice behind him. The voice he’s been seeking out, been hoping to hear. He turns around, a quip ready on his lips—
Tony downs a bottle of whiskey, disassembles and reassembles a couple of cars, goes out to a bar, and returns home with four people on his arm.
But at the same time, he’s afraid. His relationship with alcohol has always been a rollercoaster. Alcohol has shaped his identity. Alcohol is what helped him through the numbness and the pain.
Steve’s glower deepens, his fingers digging into Tony’s hand. Tony would’ve said something if he isn’t too busy freaking out over Steve’s sudden anger. “This isn’t funny, Tony. Bucky and I— We’re not a thing. We never have been.”
She’s right. Sure, there’s a high chance that Tony is definitely taken. But at the same time, there’s also that sliver of a chance that Tony might not be as out of reach as Steve thought he is.
Tony grins. “Tell Cap congrats on getting his buddy back,” he says, clapping her on the shoulder. “Okay. Thanks. Bye!”
From the moment they met, Friday nights have always been reserved for Steve. It doesn't matter if Tony has business overseas or a mountain of paperwork awaiting him in his office. He'll always make time for Steve. And somehow, Steve always has time for Tony.
Tony shrugs his shoulders. “If you ask me, you joined in the moment you shoved me. So you have no one to blame but yourself. Sides’, I’m sober and voluntary. You’re sober and voluntary. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” He pauses. “Okay, not exactly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity since alcohol and I are done and all that. But you get what I mean.”
Steve rolls his eyes playfully. “C’mon, Anthony,” he says, slinging his arm around Tony’s shoulder. The gesture almost makes Tony’s knees buckle. “We’re running late.”
God, what did Steve do in his previous life to be stuck with a bunch of trolls as friends and teammates?
“You know,” Steve says as they exit the gallery, “I’m surprised you haven’t complained about your feet hurting at all. You usually do.”
Her lips curl upwards. “You’re a Tony Stark. He’s a Steve Rogers. You guys are meant to be, whether it’s friendship or romance or whatever. So stop ignoring him, because the next time Steve comes to me whining about how gone you are for Kamala’s Endgame Steve, I’ll steal all of his hands. And I know how much you like his hands.”
Some days are terrible. Tony would come to class distant. Whenever Steve could coax an explanation out of Tony, he’d always get the same answer – that it’s all Howard Stark’s fault.
Which is fine. Tony isn’t a stranger to heartbreak. He can totally handle watching his friend be in love with someone who isn’t him. He lived through five years thinking that Steve’s dead. A relationship is child’s play compared to that.
“Tony,” Steve starts in that tone that Tony both loves and hates, the one that makes him weak in the knees and his chest stir because
Tony shrugs his shoulders. “I mean, he seems like the kind of guy to take part in one. Hey, look on the bright side. At least it isn’t a hot dog eating contest. That would’ve made a grosser picture.”
“It’s fine,” Steve replies, waving the tongs around before plucking a cookie out of the jar. “Ma wouldn’t miss one.”
“C’mon,” she says, jumping to her feet, tucking her magazine under her arm. “Tony said to feed you. Hulk and Thor ate everything up but Clint said he’d be ordering in.”
Because the person on their helipad is someone he would never, ever picture being a potential partner for Tony.
Tony shrugs. “Don’t be. I had fun. And I got to see Asgard. I don't regret a thing. Anyway, we’ll see what’s in store for me next Friday. Who knows? Maybe it’ll be a disaster.”
Natasha surveys him with a cocked eyebrow. “You know you don’t need to kiss him tonight, right?” She plants herself against the vending machine, crossing her arms. “There’s no time-limit to tell him how you feel.”
“Hey, I have the right to gloat about it. You're as bad as Reed when he gets into the zone.” Johnny smirks. “Even Sue could hardly tear him away from work.”
“And there’s the denial,” Natasha says dryly at the same time Clint continues, “—for with someone who isn't you doesn’t piss you off.”
Tony can’t remember the last time he’s dreamt of her. Maybe back when he had a gaping hole in his chest in a cold dark cave, craving her embrace. Or maybe back when he was dying of palladium poisoning, dreaming of her beautiful smile as she beckons him home.
Maybe his feelings aren’t as unrequited as Steve thought they’d be. Maybe Natasha was right. Maybe Steve has been jumping to conclusions. Maybe Carol and Tony are just friends.
He's nursed this feeling the moment she agrees to let Clint go first without a fight. Being the accomplished spy that she is, she’s definitely going to set Tony up with someone that he’ll fall head over heels for. Someone who’s Tony’s match in every way possible.
If Steve thought Tony’s eyes were already as wide as saucers, they get even bigger somehow, his cheeks flushing crimson.
“Of course not. Why would I want a break from my boyfriend?” Tony scoffs before barking out a laugh that’s hopefully not bitter. “Oh wait. You’re not. Ha. Silly me. Silly joke.”
He sets the gummy bears back on the music rack, a thought suddenly crossing his mind. “Wait. How the fuck did you find me? No one else knows about this place but me, myself, and I. And well, JARVIS.” He freezes. “Wait—”
“Of course. Anything,” Steve replies instantly. “I’m actually going to be on leave after this mission. For a month. I thought of heading back to New York. And if you—”
As usual, Steve kisses back with the same intensity, pressing Tony closer to his body. He tastes of coffee and salt and everything Tony adores.
Before he can stop himself, Tony blurts out, “You know, how the press is.” He barks out a laugh that sounds too shrill to his ears. “Vultures. Figured we’d keep things on the down-low.”
“Jen said she needed to meet with a client tomorrow morning,” Tony replies, throwing himself onto the loveseat next to Steve. “So we had to cut things short.”
God, he is so glad everyone’s in the common room and the hangar. The last thing he needs is someone seeing him trying to get in Captain America’s pants.
“Well,” Tony begins next to him, cutting through Steve’s thoughts, “since we’re gonna die anyway, you have any… I don’t know… Last confessions?”
Then again, Miles didn’t have to go along with whatever Kamala had in mind, so that makes it both of their fault.
But tonight Steve isn’t complimenting him as a teammate as a friend. Tonight, Steve gushes about Tony like a teenager in love. It’s something Tony never knew he needed.
“T’was a marvelous contest!” Thor says, grinning from ear-to-ear as they land on the helicarrier. “We should do this again! This time we will—”
Steve’s looking at him with an incomprehensible look, his lips parted. All of a sudden, Tony feels self-conscious.
It never fails to astound Tony the progress they’ve made in such a short amount of time. Just months ago they were complete strangers who hated each other's guts. Now, Tony could easily read every one of Steve’s tells and unfortunately, vice-versa.
Steve had entertained the thought of gifting the card to Tony on Monday. Not face-to-face, no. He would’ve popped over to school earlier than usual and slip it through the side of Tony’s locker like a coward.
“So, I got some bad news,” Steve says when he and Natasha return. He holds out three sets of keys. Tony feels the dread coursing through him.
The next best thing is to head down to his workshop and immerse himself in his work. It usually does the job in distracting him but just the thought of working right now leaves him anxious.
Steve shrugs. “If it helps, she only agreed to the whole thing since she has an ongoing bet with Fury.”
“Here you are,” Steve echoes, his mind officially in shambles. He doesn't know whether he should thank or yell at Natasha and Johnny for their meddling. “Let me guess, Nat threatened to castrate you.”
It doesn’t help that the cluster of bodies around them seem eager to witness the race, cajoling Tony to accept the challenge.
“You do know you guys don’t need to be hanging around me, right?” Tony remarks. “Don’t you guys have better things to do?”
“You heard me. We need to end this—” Tony gestures between them. “This—thing. We can’t be fuck buddies anymore.”
It’s not even an exaggeration. Only an idiot would let himself get distracted by some flirting that might be harmless, let himself get jealous—
All of a sudden, the room feels so much warmer, tempting Tony to pull his blazer off his shoulders. Or Steve’s.
Tony snickers. “Hate to burst your bubble but there won’t be any wedding on the horizon between the both of us.”
Steve’s pretty sure Sif’s smirking at him when she says the final bit. But he doesn’t have time to ponder because Tony’s taking her hand and giving the rest of them a two-finger salute.
Steve would be like acrylic – stiff, flat, and static. They are never meant to be in each other’s orbit.
His friends seem oblivious to his messy thoughts, chattering away as they retreat. Steve tries to tune it all out and he does.
His favorite diner is now a bank. Most of his classmates have moved away. Everything is too clean, too cold, too much.
Unsurprisingly, the pillow is yanked out from under him. His head hits the mattress with a soft thump, a quiet groan tumbling out of his lips.
As much as Steve dislikes each and every moment of Operation: Get Tony To Stop Moping By Finding Him True Love, he’s been dreading Natasha’s turn.
He barely registers the words shooting out of his mouth, only that he’s met with peals of laughter. Since Steve’s chortling around and pinning Tony with a fond smile, Tony counts it as a win.
“None of it was your fault. Not a single thing. I chose to follow you. I chose to fight by your side knowing I could die. I chose to get on that train with you because there was no place I wanted to be more. I chose to die for you because you are my best pal, my brother and there was no better way to go.” Bucky assured with conviction.
Some of the officials glanced at each other worryingly. After a minute of nothing happening someone spoke up.
He tried the best he could to regain his bearings. He looked around him, quickly realizing he was in fact still in New York lying in the middle of the crater the blackhole created.
The aid bots were already complying to their operating program.  He saw one bot head to an unconscious Natasha.  The other went to Clint who was sporting a few bleeding lacerations but seemed to be in good health overall.
Tony kicked the chair from his position on the floor and it smacked right into Barnes, clipping him on the hip.
“Two days.” Sam said as he gently lifted a cup to Steve’s lips. “You are a crazy lucky man.” He said as Steve took a small tentative sip of the cool water.
"Waiting for someone?" The genius spoke up smirking, his wide brown eyes crinkled in a knowing smile.
Steve wasn’t one hundred percent sure but he couldn’t help but to think that he saw Colonel Rhodes flip Tony the bird before the elevator door closed. He must of considering Tony is now on the floor laughing as asks off.
Fury continued, “And remember to document everything. Even that which you deem insignificant, it could be useful.” Fury stopped and looked at his phone.
“Why, if it isn’t my precious Jellybean.” She set the sundae down and pinched Ellie’s cheek. Ellie giggled.
From the promise of obscene murder in the Soldiers eyes, Tony was sure that Steve’s words were true. He glanced down at the letter in his hands. Now all he needed to know was how much Barnes knew about what happened to Steve. Judging from his thunderous, murderous expression he knew exactly what Tony came here for.
No matter how much effort or risk he had taken to keep Steve and Barnes alive when the strike unit closed in on them, it didn’t matter in the end when he couldn’t put his heart on the line for the Captain. In the end after everything it was Tony unwilling to trust Steve. How could he expect the Captain to trust him when really he was the one who couldn’t trust Steve? This whole mess was Tony’s fault, plain and simple.
Sometime later after finishing some of his chores, Steve took the list Peggy left for him off the table by the door and looked it over. It seemed to be a pretty standard supply run list. Buy a whetstone to sharpen the blades on the push mower and hedge trimmers, pick up two fabric bundles from the seamstress, get a case of canned goods from the grocery and go to Cranston (the next town over) to pick up the wedding gift Peggy ordered for Howard and Maria. Steve figured he'd leave that one for tomorrow seeing as Peggy had the car, so he was gonna have to take the bus. He grabbed his keys and wallet and braced himself for his journey into town.
“If only such were ever that simple. There seems to be a block or barrier the moment they are touched by that strange force. Their minds are beyond even the Professor’s abilities.”  Hank supplied forlornly.
The ugly fat man began to laugh and sneer from behind the newcomer who was sporting hot pink aviators and pink bunny ears.
“Hmm, I know! It’s like you always say, to be prepared for anything and to stay aware of my surroundings!” She smiled.
“So what you suppose we do now?  Give up?  Pile ourselves on top of the Avengers Tower and present ourselves to this thing with cherries on top?”  Clint replied obviously not panicking in the slightest.
“You are a sharp one, insolent even, despite being in such a desolate state of existence!” She laughed. “You never cease to amaze me! I am immensely happy to have chosen you.” She took a deep breath. “That my dear, Steven, is for me to know and you to discover later. Now choose.” She demanded.
He sighed.  ‘Great.’  Now he was developing an eye twitch on top of the headache, just flipping fantastic.
“Captain Rogers! I know you are leading this unit. You should face me like a man!” Dr. Doom called out.
Just as Steve was going to go into yet another round of apologies, Tony successfully shut him up by quickly and desperately pressing his lips onto Steve’s.  The Captain responded immediately, cupping Tony’s face in one hand and pulling him closer with the other. Steve felt like he was on fire.
“Do you have no idea the kind of mass hysteria that would cause? On a global scale no less… Even if we somehow could do it, to afford it, to build it in a timely fashion… It can not be done.” The Director stated almost hotly.
Tony considered him for a moment. The Captain is an extraordinary man that generally cares about the well being of, well, everyone.
He could vaguely hear the alarms and screams in the background.  To him they were significantly muted, however.  There was a large part of him that needed to cry but was completely unable to. He felt numb, vastly unable to process everything that has happened, that was happening.
Steve opened the door quickly and pushed a discreet button on the ball and rolled it into the kitchen. He shut the door promptly. Just that quick glance told him that there were swarms of the fuzz balls in the house.
He snorted but it didn’t seem like he was finding this any funnier than Tony was. The story had just started and Tony was already feeling the vice of sadness tighten around him.
First, he tries talking to him. And that goes nowhere. Steve was being his bull-headed self and Tony was becoming sure this distance was a punishment for his actions. Then he tried to get the other Avengers, namely Natasha, to talk to the man. Steve and Nat were good friends and Tony hoped that she would be able to talk some sense into him but no dice. Tony tries everything. And as his heat comes ever closer he misses his alpha with a ferocity that he had never expected even a few years ago.
“Do you really want to do that? Or are you doing it because that’s what you think you should be doing.” Rhodey looked at him with a weird look which he was unable to understand.
He should be terrified but he wasn’t. To be used by his alpha, by his Steve, was an amazing thought. To know that the man took his pleasure from Tony and Tony alone was exhilarating. It made him feel like he was irresistible. Like even in his sleep he was able to attract America's most desireable alpha.
“Steve, be ready for supper by eight as Rhodey is arriving this morning to stay for a few days.” Tony bent low to whisper in his ears, rubbing his hands over the naked skin of Steve’s back.
“It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Rogers,” he says, practically purring. And if Steve hadn’t seen and laughed at this behaviour all his life, he truly would have believed Bucky and his over intimate tone.
Now Steve was crying in earnestness. “No baby, never. I don’t know why I said that but you are not needy. I love it when you come to me. I love it when you seek me out after a long day or when you are tired. Taking care of you is not a chore, it’s an honor.
“You can’t fix it, Steve. I love you but I don’t know if I can trust you.” Tony couldn’t believe he was saying something like this. He had thought that he would beg the alpha to take him back, but presented with the chance he was throwing it away.
Steve and Bucky haven’t ever danced together but they have fought together and so they know how to move in sync.
“Bucky, the omega you were sneaking around with. The one you have loved all these years.” And isn’t that the kicker. If Steve had spent time with Bucky without telling Tony, sharing his life then did he ever really love Tony? Or was he just a stop-gap, a way to pass the time until he got the one he really wanted.
But then the spell broke when he moaned, desperate for more and unable to contain the begging words that fell from his lips. Steve suddenly realised that Tony was lying in a position that could hurt him. He slowly removed his fingers and Tony groaned his hole feeling empty and desperate for a knot. Then Steve picked up Tony and without a word put him on the bed and left the room. Probably off to the gym to work off the excess energy.
Tony feels tears well up in his eyes. He finally has his decision, he will leave, he won’t stand in the way of his love living his real life. What has he got to offer Steve anyway?
It had all started innocuously. Steve had mentioned going out for coffee with an old friend, reconnecting about their shared past in the military. And Tony had been happy for him, glad that his alpha, in all but name, had someone with whom he could talk about the horrors of war.
Pepper once asked him, if all this hard work was worth it. If it was smart to let Steve back into his life. His friends weren't sure he should get back together with Steve, hating him with a ferocity they usually reserved for Howard Stark.
It just came out in the heat of the moment. He had never meant it. He loved how much Tony loved him. It was unlike anything he had ever experienced. He knew he was loved completely and it was such a warm feeling. It was like seeing the sun after a long winter.
Usually, Steve just nodded and kept silent around others. But not today. Today he gives Bucky a brilliant smile and says with all the warmth he has in his heart for his dear friend, “me too Lord Barnes.”
“Oh baby doll you are so wet? Is this all for me?” he croons. Steve licks his lips and Tony follows the movement. Then he removes his fingers and before Tony has a chance to complain he picks up a pillow and makes the omega lie stomach down on it.
He couldn’t breathe. He needed air. He had asthma as a child and that is exactly what he was feeling right now. Tony was in heat. He knew that, the omega went into it like clockwork.
Outwardly he is the same. His emotions in check, he is laughing with the alphas and ignoring the usual slew of dirty looks directed at him. Natasha would be proud.
At those words Steve paled, and Tony knew he had crossed a line. This was a real issue for him and to throw it in his face during a fight was a low blow. Even Tony with his limited understanding of emotions knew that.
Who wouldn’t be when confronted with a wet and naked omega in their bed? And if Tony was just sleeping then maybe Steve could have managed to ignore his slumbering beauty. But no, Tony was sleeping on his front, with his ass practically in the air, as though begging to be bred. And Steve could smell the omega's slick, and the way it made him smooth and inviting. Tony was begging to be entered, to be used as Steve, his alpha saw fit. So then all Steve wanted to do whenever he witnessed this spectacle was to lower those shorts and plunge into that slick warm channel. To twist Tony's body as he saw fit. To breed Tony until he was thick with Steve’s child.
“I know that Tony. Don’t you know that I know that? But what if something had happened to you? Something worse than cracked ribs and a concussion. I can’t lose you. I refuse to. So I need you to listen to me if I give you an order. It’s for your own good. I can’t abandon the mission because I am too worried about you.”
In the carriage on their way home, Tony is lying on Steve and scenting him. The beloved head of brown hair is scenting every inch on Steve’s skin. Replacing Bucky’s scent with his own.
This time though, this time, the science didn’t come. What came was tears and snot. What came was punching a mirror. What came was the desire to go crawling back to his alpha.
And Tony wishes he had the strength to laugh because this could only be a joke. But his eyes start to water again because that’s how Steve would sound before they broke up and this encounter is just confusing him now.
Later when he was laid up in bed, he wondered what he would do now. It seemed like there was nothing he could do, no way to move forward. It was circular in a way. Tony loved Steve, it seemed like Steve loved Tony. But Tony could not forgive Steve.
“Bucky was my friend Tony, and yes I loved him, I did. But that love is nothing compared to what I feel for you. It isn’t.
Then his worst nightmare comes true, Steve pulls out. His hole is unable to fully close and he feels so open. For Steve. He whines at the loss of Steve's cock. He is then carefully turned and he looks in Steve's sweet face, darkened by lust though it is. Steve’s eyes are nearly black, traces of the baby blue all but gone.
“You know, you begin to look like a lush and juicy cherry. It is hard to stop you from looking this delicious.” Lord Anthony remarked one day.
“A few months ago Bucky messaged me out of the blue. He had gotten my number from an army buddy of mine. He had left the army and was living in Brooklyn and heard that I lived here too. He suggested we meet up for coffee and I thought why not. Before we dated he had been my best friend. I didn’t tell you because I know you; you wouldn’t have been okay with it. So I thought what is one meeting.”
Just as the Captain regain his balance after the second attack he was about to round on Von Doom and engage. He turned swiftly to face Dr. Doom and order is team to attack only to be faced with something that turned his blood to ice.
His head was bound in a bandage and it appeared he had a splint over three of his fingers. He caught Steve staring at him mournfully and was quick to explain.
Here’s the kicker, if they became ill here on the helicarrier, then they were dealing with the frightening possibility that the foe causing it all was here on the helicarrier also. The red alert ensues.
"Not to be a buzz kill or anything." Clint spoke up. "But the incoming bots look a little too much like the real nasty doom bots for comfort."
Tony was sure that wasn’t the whole reason, he could see it in his eyes. The genius didn’t want to press, however. If Steve wasn’t ready for anything more than he was fine with that.
“My God…” She whispered as she slowly turned her gaze to stare at Bucky’s prone form next to them realizing he was the source of this nasty wound.
to stop. Desperately begging and pleading to let me die instead. I watched myself murder innocent people. Watched the light leave their eyes by my own hand. Because I was not in control, someone else was. But I was there and there is absolutely nothing I can do to stop him or myself. Nothing. I was absolutely powerless. Is not something I can easily describe or have someone understand.”
Uh oh… Tony was 30 feet away from reaching Bucky before he realized sub unit number one was getting ready to launch another pressure bomb. He wasn’t going to make it. Dammit!
Bucky nodded despondently. He quickly pulled Steve close to him and held him tight. The twins watched with sad expressions.
“Oh, Ellie! This is so beautiful. Are you trying to hug your little brother or sister?” He smiled at her.
He stared at Steve’s empty stool for a while, he felt his face get heated and his eyes become wet. He wrenched his gaze away in disgust and anguish before suddenly dropping his blankets and bolting out the door. He ran mindlessly through the halls with no conscious destination in mind. He just needed to get out of there. He needed solace. He did not know where he could possibly find it, if it were even at all possible to find.
He would never be able to un-see the way Bucky’s face contorted or the way the puddle of his blood glistened in the sunlight as it steadily grew in size. But even more disgusting was the fact that he was unable to reach him yet again. He was forever doomed to fail.
"Relay a message for me, tell him to focus on taking the helicarrier down. When it's out of the way take out as many doom bots as possible and if he happens to see a little pink bunny hopping about to kill it with extreme prejudice." Captain America commanded.
Tony nicked the badges from the officials and the to began to make their way through the corridor. Jarvis continued to cover their tracks by looping the security footages. Tony activated the elevator using the badges.
His heat didn’t really come back. He was hornier than usual and still slightly slick but it wasn’t even close to the desperation he had felt before. So he stayed home and tinkered in his workshop, grateful for his Pepper sanctioned heat-leave.
Now Tony knows how old-timey families work. An alpha needs an heir and married whatever omega he thinks fit for the task. Rich alphas marry richer omegas in order to gain power or money or both.
As soon as Steve left, Tony collapsed into a heap on the floor but the expected tears did not come. He must have run out. Whatever the reason Tony didn’t cry. He sat there on the floor for a long time and wondered at his own stupidity.
He was feeling like someone was eating him inside out. His heart hurt and he knew he was at the edge of insanity. He couldn’t lose Tony. He just couldn’t. One mistake should not be enough to ruin the best thing in his life.
Not sex, he believes Steve when he says he hasn’t slept with anyone else. He is good at reading Steve when he’s not being all soldierly. What he means are time and emotions. Parts of Steve's life that he has always kept away from Tony.
After those pleasantries are done he turns to Steve and kisses his hand as is customary behaviour towards an omega.
“I knew what you were doing the whole week,” Steve says nonchalantly as if they are in a park and not fucking. “I knew you were acting out to get me to break. This is punishment for that. So now you will come on my cock alone and I get to set the pace.”
Tony let himself melt into the hug, desperate for contact with his alpha after these long and lonely months.
He had to talk to Tony again, convince the man of his love. They had to get back together. It might take time but he was willing to do anything. They had to go back to being one again. Anything else was unacceptable.
His orgasm triggered Tony's and he too came with a shout. His omega's body was milking his cock for each drop. Clenching his member like he was afraid Steve would leave at the last second.
“I’m sorry, Steve I didn’t mean that, you know I didn’t mean that.” Steve was regaining colour but he still looked miffed.
And suddenly Steve is there at the edge of the bed, frantically removing his clothes. Tony knew how much the man loved his heats. When he was naked Steve climbed the bed and scooted to where Tony was lying.
After clutching Tony like he is in the armour and is giving Steve a lift, a hug and fly, his alpha sets a brutal pace. But here too he is unable to move so he just holds on tight with his arms around Steve’s shoulders. Enjoying the feeling of his alpha in him, around him. He is surrounded and overcome by Steve and it is the best feeling in the world. He can hear the obscene squelching and slap of skin on skin with every stroke. The feeling is slowly building up. Steve's knot is fully flared now and is catching at his rim. Both of them are close. Suddenly Steve shouts and pushes in as deep as he can go, and then he is coming in long spurts. His orgasm triggers Tony's and his insides clench to milk Steve’s cock for every drop. This is why nothing can beat the real thing. The dildo is nothing when compared to Steve.
"You’re right buttercup, I do need to marry, I understand that. I’ll write a letter to her father offering a marriage proposal and send it by tomorrow." Tony sounded resigned and strangely subdued.
But then why was he here, in the middle of a foggy fucking field, in rural England in 1815, instead of the damn machine. Obviously, something must have gone wrong. But what? He remembered standing next to the time machine, and there had been some malfunction, a flash of blue and suddenly he was here.
He also knows that Steve wants him like he has never wanted anyone else. Sex, or making love as Steve calls it, is one of their favourite activities. And they frequently enjoy all kinds from the need-you-right-now, the slow exploration of bodies, to the fun and kinky kind. So he knows that Steve hates staying away as much as Tony does. Their sex life attests to this fact. Hasn’t Tony spent hours spread out under his alpha who uses his fingers, tongue, and cock to drive him mad with want.
So, of course, Steve lost the ability to converse in English. Very peculiar considering he had managed to speak the language all his life.
“Steven, no, I am going on that field and you can’t stop me. I am healthy enough to fight and I know you can keep it in your pants for the duration.” Why Steve was being like this he didn’t know.
Tony frowned at him, taking a bite, and said, “Oh my dear, you don’t have a meek bone in your body. No meek omega would pick up their alpha and throw them on the bed to have their way with them.”
But it was not just that. It was the deep possessiveness that he felt when he entered his omega. Like Tony was his plaything. Just a good little cock sleeve, there to be fucked and used, and then put away, till next time.
During all this, the conversation between Lord Stark and Lord Rhodes had shifted and he was introduced to Him. The alpha raised his eyes to meet Steve’s and at that point, he was sure that this man was it. He was everything. He could be the fated mate he had been waiting for all his life.
But soon it changed, their conversations became less polite. As the whispers grew around them, he began to realize that Lord Anthony stood closer than was appropriate, even for a couple in the midst of courtship, their fingers lingered on each other and then he was asked to call Lord Anthony as Tony, which was a distinction only awarded to close friends.
“It wasn’t because you were not important enough or that I didn’t love you enough. It was because I didn’t want to burden you.”
What would happen to him? He had been Tony's mistress for two years now. And in those two years, Steve had fallen completely in love with the alpha. He wanted a home, a mate and children. But whenever Steve even hinted at something like that Tony would shut down and then try to distract him. It was clear that Tony didn’t care about Steve that way he cared about Tony. But the question was, what would happen to Steve? His reputation was ruined the second he decided to sleep with Tony on that fateful day. The army was wary about him joining the ranks before all this so there was no way they’d let him stay. His reputation would also stop a respectable alpha from marrying him.
What plan? What is it that we could do that could change Tony's desire to marry an omega with a spotless record? Right then the footman entered the foyer and announced the arrival of someone.
Tony wants to cry, he can’t believe that Steve is like all the other alphas he’s fucked over the years and the ones he wanted to fuck but couldn’t over the past few weeks. That Steve just wants to sleep with him.
But Tony didn’t follow. Much as he would like to fight, he knew he was pushing it. Sighing he went to the bedroom he shared with Steve and flung himself on the bed. Thankfully there were no witnesses to this thoroughly teen girl behaviour.
Tony stops this rambling apology and gets right to the heart of the matter, “if I matter so much to you why didn’t you call or text. Why did you just leave? Why didn’t you fight for me?”
Steve scoots forward and cups his face, and Tony can’t help but nuzzle into those warm hands, they had always kept him safe.
“I would never think that but if you don’t want to forgive him then that is valid too. My point is that you shouldn’t do anything that you don’t want to.”
It has not started yet but it won’t be long before he is on the bed and begging Steve because no one else would be able to calm the fires that rage within him.
But Steve hadn’t seemed that type. Or Tony hadn’t wanted to see it. He has been blocking the fact that in two months he has to leave Steve behind.
And that is enough to trigger Steve too. He comes with a hoarse shout. Tony lies down on him, still inside and pumping his seed deep within. Steve cards his fingers through those curls and feels complete.
Tony had obviously moved on. Scores of newspapers were covering Tony's escapades with other alphas. If he had to see another picture of some third rate alpha grinding his omega... No, not his omega anymore. It was like an itch under his skin, the knowledge that others had been with Tony, that they had taken what was only theirs and dirtied it.
Turning towards him, he said, “Steve, I love spending time with you. You are so sweet and earnest. I would love it if you would accept the offer I am about to make. I would like for you to be my companion. I would provide you with a lavish townhouse, clothes, a carriage and servants to do your bidding. I loved what we just did now and I know you did too. So I hope you will say yes.”
Bucky, having amassed a fortune trading, assured him that he had been invited to plenty of balls and soirees now that he was rich. Minor lord though he was the desire for money still prevailed in the people who wished to associate with him. And that is where they would start. Nobody in the Ton really knew that Steve and Bucky were childhood friends so they should be safe. Steve had been unable to calm his nerves when Natasha had outlined her plan but he had acquiesced and now there was no turning back. There was a ball at Lord Ashworth's and Tony had sent a message to be ready by 8 pm. Hopefully, they would be able to execute the first part of the plan without any problem.
Steve was a very generous host. He said he’d let Tony stay at his house till the next window for travel opened up. He said he’d order some appropriate clothes for Tony. Apparently, his Black Sabbath T-shirt and jeans were not something respectable omegas would wear in public. Steve blushed when he said this, his ears turning a lovely shade of red.
“I love you too Steve and I would follow you to hell and back too.” What else could he say but the truth? He was crazy about this alpha.
And Tony doesn’t know why he isn’t ready to believe this. Why he asks what he asks. “And what about Bucky?”
“You’re wrong Bucky. I am nothing but a disgraced soldier. He is a Lord of the Realm, he makes weapons that the army uses in the war against Napoleon, and he is the richest man in the country. Even the Prince Regent wants to be his friend. I am nothing in front of him."
“Yes, other omegas will be jealous and will probably plot how to separate you from me so that they can use their wily charms on you. I have half a mind to let them get to you Tony. Then you’ll realise what a model omega I am.” Steve joked, but he hated when other omegas and their mamas plotted against him. He was also amused because they never seemed to realise that he used to be a soldier and a very good at that. So he could spot their clumsy plans from a mile away. Tony may not be his but damned if he would let anyone else steal him away.
“That isn’t enough Steve, I had months to think about this and I came to the conclusion that you don’t love me like I love you.”
Steve looked broken like he had swallowed knives and they were cutting his insides up. But he said yes.
Tony feels like tearing his hair out but he keeps clutching the pillow. Soon he is suffused with a warm feeling and is near delirious with want. It's building up and it won't be long now.
“I know I should have told you about Bucky, I know that. But I knew you would take it badly. I am sorry. And I know I shouldn’t have called you clingy. You aren’t clingy. What you are is the best man I have ever me..”
Soon he will descend fully into the heat and nothing but a knot will calm him. It is nowhere even close to the real thing but it will have to do.
The alpha turns white at this. Tony knows he is taunting Steve but then he has been tormented by Bucky for a long time. The spectre becoming a horrifying reality with the other omega getting what was Tony's.
Sighing Tony got his favourite knotting dildo out of their toy drawer. He didn’t like it but had it for situations exactly like this.
They dance together for three songs and then walk back to where Lord Rhodes and Bucky are still standing. Tony has a smug smile on his face and that gives Steve some hope. Maybe, just maybe he feels as Steve does.
“I followed you because I love you, Tony. I love you and I would follow you to hell and back.” Steve looked at him with those eyes and it was pretty obvious that he believed what he said.
Steve looked at him and tears were pooling in his eyes. “I don’t really know Tony. Maybe it was because I was getting closure, maybe it was because it felt good to have my best friend again. But Tony you have to believe me when I say there was nothing romantic between us. It wasn’t a meeting of lovers but of friends.”
“Steve I need to know why you did this.” Tony had already braced himself to hear all of it but he knew it wouldn’t be easy. ”Tell me everything and spare no detail. I don’t care if it hurts me but I need to know everything.”
“Baby please try to understand, I will be in no condition to fight if you keep doing this. I am on the knife’s edge and I am barely in control of myself right now. If something happens to you, I will lose the semblance of it and go into full rage. I cannot let that happen.” He said, beseechingly. “So while I know you will hate me for this as team leader I am saying stand down.” And with that he left the room.
Captain Steve Rogers had a problem. Okay, it was not actually a problem just something that baffles him. Tony, for some strange reason, had taken to sleeping almost naked. He had not told Steve what prompted this but Steve could guess. He knew it was a move designed to entice him. To tempt him into giving in to his urges.
He didn’t know where he had forgotten it. When he decided that their love could be insulted like that.
Tony's blood boils when he hears this. He doesn’t need Steve to protect him from this or lie about what he has been doing for the last two months. Who he has been doing.
Tony is drowning in sensations. He can’t move or touch Steve. They can’t even kiss. All he is able to do is clench his hole in a futile bid to keep Steve in and make him turn this slow and steady pace into one that satisfies his wanton need.
For Tony who loved every second of it last night, this comes as a bit of a shock. He spends a considerable amount of time making Steve understand that he is fine and that he loved it. And also that he would love it if they did it more.
He apologizes to Steve and is forgiven but the physical distance remains. Steve is always near but never touches Tony. He has known Steve for three years and they have been bonded for two. He knows Steve as well he knows his own back hand. He had never expected to find a person like this. To find a soul that was so in tune with his. So the fact that his bonded is not touching him, especially so near his heat is frustrating. He is an engineer; he should be able to fix this.
But as alluring this image is and as much as Tony loves to be eaten out, he feels hollow. And he says as much.
“I will forgive you but there will be new rules in place. You have to follo....” he couldn’t finish before he was enveloped in a bone-crushing hug. Steve had buried his face in Tony's neck and had his arms around his waist in a vice.
He had locked himself in their room and had shouted at Steve to leave and the stupid alpha listened to him and had left. Now, three weeks later he knew he was spiralling. Pepper looked at him with worry and Rhodey called him every chance he got. But he didn’t know how to fix anything. He knew he loved Steve but he honestly didn’t know if Steve loved him back.
Even now Steve is in the room with him, but he is keeping away as much as he can stand to. Tony knows it is difficult for him, but Steve is the one who came up with this stupid reason. So why should Tony suffer?
The past two years had been idyllic, if he chose to forget the obvious, with the pair meeting almost every day. Tony had given him a townhouse where Sam and Natasha lived with him. He had servants to do his every bidding, fine clothes, and jewels that befitted the station of Tony's lover and his friends so he’d be less lonely. He was still in the army but Tony’s influence meant he wasn’t sent to war. This edict had caused their biggest fight to date. Steve had wanted to fight, His feelings for tony be damned, and it was what he was trained for, what he wanted to do in his life. Tony, however, wasn’t ready to relent and they hadn’t talked to each other for a week after that.
That was one of the bright stars in this dark night. His friends would come back and he would host them in his house. They had fought for years together before Tony had forbidden him from fighting. He missed those days, just him, the Howling Commandos and Bucky.
That night Tony worships him. Pushing him higher and higher but never letting him reach that peak.  Steve is incoherent with need but Tony uses his fingers and his tongue to wrack his body and mind with pleasure. Steve can feel how slick he is, how wet for his alpha.
Soon he was spending all his free time with Lord Anthony; they would go to balls and call on Lord Rhodes together. Anthony was fun and witty, continuously teasing him and making him flush a deep red. He was sure that Tony was courting him. As Steve had no elders in his family that could approve of a proposal of courting, Steve naturally assumed that Anthony was doing as he wished, without caring a whit about decorum or the Society.
“Good evening, Mr. Rogers. I hope the company of soft lords and ladies instead of the soldiers is acceptable to you.” Lord Stark said, bowing to him and showing him the respect a soldier deserved. Instead of treating him like an omega.
Maybe it was because he knew what it felt like to be loved completely, whatever he thought completely was, by Steve. And that has ruined him for everyone else.
All I can say is that I am sorry. I now know what life is like without you. I can’t do it.” Steve tried to take his hands in his but Tony withdrew and Steve withdrew his hands, a broken expression on his face.
“So why didn’t you stop meeting him?” He was so curious to know what it was about Bucky that made Steve go back again and again. It was a sick sort of curiosity. He knew the answer would break his heart but he still had to know.
“If I love you and you love me then why can’t we just move forward. Be angry, be mad, be disappointed. Do anything baby, I don’t care but please don’t ask me to leave. I won’t survive it another time.” Steve wiped the tears from his cheeks and he looked like he would truly jump from a tall building if it made Tony happy.
“Shut up Steve.” He turns to go in, hoping that the alpha would leave but then Steve says something that just sucker punches him.
He knew that Tony was an insecure man. With a history like his, it was understandable. And now Steve, who had promised to always cherish and protect the man, was just another in a long line of betrayals.
The farmer was not a farmer. Well dressed and very obviously an alpha, he had broad shoulders and a strong chest. He smelled of oranges and cinnamon if he had to guess. Handsome and well built he might be but his eyes were what interested Tony the most. The alpha had such kind eyes.
Tony realised that he couldn’t put the whole blame on Steve. Yes, a large portion of the issue was due to Steve, but Tony played a part too. He never felt the need to sit down and talk about how he felt when the alpha pushed him aside. That staying quiet to keep the peace between them had strained the relationship.
Steve’s entire countenance stiffens and he swallows, “At first it was because you told me to get out and I was so ashamed. But then I heard that you were meeting alphas in clubs and I thought you had moved on.”
“Hello, Steve. I think we should talk. Would you come to my apartment?” He knew he sounded formal but falling back to his practiced nonchalance was the only way he could control his feelings right now.
“Love isn’t enough sometimes. Please, Steve, I need time to think about this. I promise I will call you when I have decided.” He knew he was breaking his own heart but he also knew he wanted someone to love him and only him.
He knew he was stuck in the past. That was his reality now and there was no way to change that fact. What was he supposed to do now? It was night time. He had no money and nothing to barter. The next window would open in half a year. At least he had his tech with him. If he were completely free of it, then he would have felt really powerless.
