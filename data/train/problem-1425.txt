He held that thought close as he sat down in his armchair and engrossed himself in his datapad. Molly would send him a copy of her full autopsy report as soon as she had written it up and in the meantime he could type up his own mental notes to compare them to hers later.
Luck was clearly on their side that day - it was so warm in the greenhouses that hardly anyone was in them. In one of the sections, a large tree leaned across the path, long branches dripping down onto the walkway like a thick green curtain. They had the place to themselves and now there was a lovely green privacy screen surrounding them, too.
And to think that for a moment, he had believed John would say he had changed his mind. That it was time to stop this farce and just admit that the feeling was mutual and that he didn't really want Mary after all.
They spent a miserable fifteen minutes out on the pavement as John tried to simultaneously flag down a cab and keep Sherlock upright. The detective was leaning heavily against him, swaying where he stood. Every now and then, he would squint at John or one of the people passing them and mutter unintelligible words that may or may not be deductions.
By the time Sherlock proclaimed John dry, he had taken another six or seven pictures and broken down laughing about the pure level of fluffiness John's fur had achieved in the process of the blow-drying.
John rolled his eyes at him. "I know you are. But why are you eating? Psy don't eat normal food. Don't you have nutrition bars or something?"
He barely paid attention to the rest of the conversation, adding a comment here and there when he became aware of something someone was saying, but otherwise turning all his attention inward. Was this how Sherlock felt when he was in his Mind Palace?
"You did everything right," Lestrade assured him. "I'm just saying, the circumstances were pretty shitty. Anyway, I've got to go now. I just wanted to drop this off for you."
Smiling to himself, Sherlock stripped off his own jumper and vest and began to peel off the longjohns. He still had on pants underneath them - you really couldn't be too careful in these temperatures.
instead?!" Lestrade snapped and turned his furious glare at an unlucky scientist who just happened to catch his eye.
It occurred to him that this had been a good idea the moment he stepped into the lab and found Molly there, recalibrating a centrifuge.
Sherlock couldn't deny the thrill it had sent down his spine, this idea of being claimed by John. Perhaps it hadn't been much in the bigger picture of things, certainly irrelevant considering John's words following that, but it had reminded him of John's notable jealousy all these years ago when Irene Adler had crossed their path. Back then, Sherlock had still held on to some hope that they would eventually work this out, that if he were patient for just a bit longer, John would finally realise what was right in front of his face.
The fear that something might go wrong, that he might lose control and turn into a killing machine, made him almost physically sick. Unfortunately, if he didn't start shifting again, he might lose not only his ability to do so but also his sanity. He wasn't human and he could not pretend to be so. He was both his human half and his cat and he could not deny one of the two without denying his entire self. Perhaps, if he could keep up this level of skin contact, he would be fine.
He turned and marched out and it was only when the door closed behind him that John realised Sherlock had handcuffed him to the radiator.
John tipped his head to the side and tried to scramble to his feet again, but coordinating four legs and a tail - which he wagged about rather aimlessly and seemed to be confused by - was not nearly as easy as the common dog made it seem.
John folded the paper and carefully put it in his pocket. It was old and who was he kidding ... Sherlock wouldn't write down relevant information. He would keep it safely locked away in that big brain of his where no one else could access it.
The funeral was held two days later, in a church and cemetery far from the one John had once buried Sherlock in. He hadn’t even considered using the same place - it had seemed like blasphemy.
John was amused to note that his friend had to clear his throat before the words would come out right.
Sherlock didn't say another word until they had reached the pub and found a quiet corner in the back, away from the handful of patrons. There was music playing but with so few people to hear it, it was blessedly quiet and they could talk quietly, without having to strain to hear each other.
Sherlock carefully backed up a step, then another, but of course by now everyone else had caught on to what was happening and the hallway was flooded with police officers who wanted to make sure the child was safe.
"No idea," Sherlock told him. "My best guess would be he noticed his son was a bit more stressed than he should be. Or perhaps he found evidence of his own. Forsythe Junior was good at hiding every trace but he still made mistakes. The pacifier behind the sofa comes to mind. And parents usually know more about their children than either party would like to admit."
Sherlock's mouth dropped open a little and he seemed to be taking deeper breaths, his eyes wide and skipping from John's eyes down to his mouth and back again.
Sherlock beamed at him, happy to know that John, as usually, knew what he was getting at. "Precisely!"
Sherlock noticed two things: Firstly, John didn't so much as twitch a muscle and secondly, Sherlock liked that more than he cared to admit.
He didn't suppose the innkeepers would be glad to see them after Sherlock had so recently dragged in Lestrade to investigate a dog but they greeted them quite cordially.
Still reeling from the conversation - weird, but by far not the weirdest he and Sherlock had ever had - John had no choice but to follow him.
"So far," Sherlock said ominously. "The sisters might turn on each other in their rivalry or form an alliance against Marquis should he make it clear that he favours neither of them. One can never know."
"Come on, we'll find one of the cubicles for you to change in," John said, dragging Sherlock with him, his clothes firmly pressed to his chest. "Preferably far enough away from everyone to keep the comments to a minimum, alright?"
Still, there was no cause for concern. Sherlock was an adult, he was free to come and go as he pleased. John had neither the right nor the inclination to hold him back. To put someone like Sherlock in a cage seemed too cruel for words. It was bad enough that his mind, his heart, had been locked in a cage of the Psy Council's making. John would not add any more restrictions to that. He couldn't if he tried.
Was this something all people who had never been Silent experienced all the time? He had no one he could ask and none of his teachers had ever thought to tell him. It was becoming increasingly clear that in the sea of emotion, he was entirely out of his depth.
As a result of their combined efforts, the Christmas tree of the Watson-Holmes household looked like something straight out of a police procedural.
Emily led Sherlock towards her and the other changelings grudgingly made way for him. "He's a telekinetic," she explained, jerking her thumb at Sherlock. "He will get Hanson down if you agree to it."
Sherlock looked pained. "I'm glad this amuses you, John. Personally, I found his conduct highly unprofessional. I'm surprised none of the guests have complained yet. He dismissed your presence with barely any acknowledgment of your order."
Sherlock wanted John to stay. He wanted it so badly it physically hurt, because he knew with absolute certainty that he wasn't allowed to want that. The world didn't work like that.
John didn't know what he had expected, but it certainly wasn't for Sherlock to tackle him to the ground.
Sherlock opened his mouth to argue, to point out that it wouldn't do any good, that he didn't want to go back, that he had already made up his mind, that danger had never scared him off of doing something. But he remembered Mycroft's words and Molly's, remembered the worried look in Donovan's eyes and felt the cold fist of fear in his chest clench ever tighter.
“Walking around London with you,” John said. “Just ...being. There’s nothing like it. I know you love this city like it’s a part of you and I get that, too, sometimes. When the light is just right and the air is warm and we can just exist in the moment. London can be so beautiful in the most unexpected moments.”
She hasn't heard them argue once and neither has Mrs Hudson. It makes her wonder just how careful Holmes is being.
.” The last word was a purr. “I’ve wanted you in my mouth for so long, John, you can’t possibly imagine.”
They will pry this ship out of my cold, dead hands, so I hope to see some of you in the comment section of my future works.
Lestrade nodded. "That's what we figured, too. He's a changeling. The murderer must have tried to break through his shields."
For a second, John worried that his friend simply didn’t like to be touched but that didn’t make much sense in the context of the past couple of days. But as no other option presented itself, John had to assume he had somehow crossed a line.
He drew back for a moment to draw in a harsh breath. Sherlock whimpered against him and dipped his head, trying to catch John's mouth with his own again.
Sherlock blinked. "Hm? Oh, sorry. I was just ..." He made a face, clearly failing to find the words to describe what he had been doing. "Never mind." He raised the violin again and played something gentler, more soothing. John wondered if it was his imagination that made it sound like an apology.
At 8pm, Mary buys herself a bottle of water in a shop less than 5 minutes away from the pool. She is carrying a smallish duffel bag that looks like it has something long shoved into it.
“Tell me what? Come, let’s sit and you can fill me in on what happened. I haven’t heard anything since I gave my statement.”
Well, he might have wanted to reach out and grasp his hand sometimes, just to hold on to something. But that was very straightforward, too, and he had never considered actually doing it. And John certainly wouldn't have let him do it. Come to that, John wouldn't let him touch him like he was right now, either, if he somehow objected to it. Lestrade could go and sod himself for making Sherlock question any of this.
It wouldn't have been so bad if only he had thought to pull on his jeans first. But he hadn't and Sherlock was left staring dumbfoundedly at strong legs and red (his brain almost flat-lined at the sight) pants.
John thought that to Sherlock, this was probably quite normal. After all, here was a man who shot the walls when he was bored, who had faked his own death and hunted killers for a living. Restarting his own heart probably didn't even rank high on the difficulty scale for him.
They were most likely Roman numerals. If there had been more numbers, he would have assumed it was a date. He knew their wedding had been in early March and that clearly wasn't part of this engraving. But perhaps it was some sort of binary code? If so, John had no idea what it might mean.
Lestrade figured he had a better chance of approaching than anyone else in the room. John - the human half of John at least - and he were friends and even Sherlock might describe him as an ally, if pressed.
"Thank you," he said, grasping Judd's hand and shaking it. "I don't know what we would have done without your help."
"I think he's getting suspicious," Sherlock all but shouts in John's ear, leaning in close to be heard over the loud music.
Sherlock found himself lifting his head a little and looking John straight in the eye. He looked ... determined and, yes, there it was: anger.
"Yes, yes, quite so. But seeing as we are amongst ourselves and we both know there is a difference between who you are and who you are supposed to be, don't bother lying and answer the question."
"It matters because I'm engaged to a lovely, wonderful woman, and these people now think I'm gay!" John snapped.
John couldn't have stopped himself from giggling for all the money in the world, even as Lestrade groaned and buried his face in his hands at what had to be the worst joke he had ever heard.
A gentle breeze blew in from the sea, bringing with it the taste of salt and seaweed and the sweet, heavy scent of the lilac blooming around the edge of the garden.
"He asked me to help him figure out how much alcohol they could safely consume for maximum fun and minimum consequences," Molly chimes in. "He made an app and everything."
She patted John's head one last time, got up from the chair and was gone with another pat to Sherlock's back.
Sherlock felt his lips twitch - something else that hadn't happened before John's appearance in his life. Molly was clever, asking him to come along so she wouldn't have to make the trip several times.
"He's perfectly fine," Sherlock said. "As fine as anyone can be in the wrong body. I've designed a questionnaire for him so I can check in on his mental state every evening."
Oh, right, Sherlock was still there. And holy shit, his voice should be outlawed. John turned to look at him, then jerked his head towards the door, and continued on his way, ears perked forward as he returned his attention to the dripping.
John yawned to demonstrate his opinion on that but all the fuss was starting to make him nervous. He could feel his stomach clench with unease even as the scientists bemoaned their inability to hook him up to any device that would measure his vital signs for fear of disrupting the process of the change.
But Sherlock didn't look convinced. John thought he probably had a right to be sceptical, after everything that had happened. After everything John
The simple statement kept echoing in John's mind. An admission, as if he had needed one, but also a damning piece of evidence of just how much he had misjudged his best friend.
John looked down at the water swirling past his paws and had to admit that Sherlock might just be right about that one. The water had a distressingly grey colour underneath the foam.
Far too soon, all the examinations had been completed and all the samples collected and sent to the next room for further testing.
. It certainly hadn't occurred to him that he might enjoy it, much less feel as if he needed it more than his next breath.
"I'll hold you to that," John said, smiling. "I don't usually need to have my brain shut down but I can already tell I'll need to kiss you a whole lot."
Sherlock nodded. "It does have all the appearance of someone targeting bird changelings in particular."
"Everything," Moriarty said. "Everything about you. 9.9 on the gradient, brother of a Councillor, and yet here you are, working with the police, with changelings, to hunt killers. And you didn't stop there. You moved in with a changeling, let some ordinary beast share your presence, wasted your intellect on its amusement."
Sherlock eats and listens and barely contributes anything to the conversation but his presence doesn't cause any awkwardness and Sally finds she feels quite comfortable.
Sherlock sighed, some of the lingering tension finally dissipating. “You’re right. Thank you, Molly.”
The sound of a car door being opened made him raise his head and he spotted the black car parked next to the jeep they had arrived in.
Looking at the images and examining the samples, Sherlock couldn't help but wonder if this was what a Psy's brain might look like if the dissonance killed them. He hoped he would never have cause to find out. The risk was there, though, and growing with every day and every touch he and John shared.
"You see me," Sherlock managed, too surprised to react to the rest of her statement. Too surprised to point out that Psy didn't get sad.
much longer to get used to John being a dog. He called him by his name easily enough and looking after a dog was something he had grown up doing, so there was nothing new there.
He swallowed around the lump in his throat and made himself speak. "I'm just ... really happy to see you."
A choked-off sound escaped his throat, caught between a sob and a whine. Without quite knowing how he made his legs move, he stumbled forward, falling to his knees beside the empty chair he knew he would never allow anyone else to sit in.
John arrived at the flat he shared with Mary an hour later, a sick feeling in his stomach. He knew he had hurt Sherlock in some way with his insistence on the divorce, though Sherlock really shouldn't have been surprised. They had both known this was coming. They both agreed they were friends and that they would continue to be friends, so what was the problem?
"Hello, darling," she greets him, picking him up and kissing his head. "Shhh, you'll startle the lovebirds."
"Perhaps if I had seen the e-mail, I would know what it said that got you to that point. It must have been somehow related to marriage but I don't know the specifics. All I can do is speculate, unless you still have the e-mail somewhere." He sighed. “I was so surprised, I actually forgot all about my experiment on the both of us. It came back to me the next morning.”
Sherlock thought. "People change." He sniffed. "And I'm not going through the hassle of organising your wedding just so you can get divorced in a couple of months once she's fed up with you running off on cases all the time." But oh, how he wished it would happen.
Sherlock sneered at him. "If you actually made use of the eyes in your head, you would not only have noticed that dog far sooner but would also realise that it is very much a groomed, well-cared for, thoroughbred dog, Anderson. The specific breed in this case being a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever."
The memory sent a painful stab through him. The days where John would have protected him without hesitation, if at all, were long gone.
He turned his attention back to Mycroft, speaking even as he reached out to gently rest one hand between John's shoulder blades, his fingers sinking into the coarse fur the same way feet disappeared in a particularly fuzzy carpet. "Regardless of that, I want you to set them to turning John back. I realise developing a serum to reverse the effects will take time. I refuse to keep John anywhere in the vicinity - the temptation to experiment on him would be too strong for some of the more ruthless among the group."
Sally shrugs. "Have you seen those piles? I don't think you can crawl under them that easily. Sounds like he or she was put there on purpose."
It was only after he had left the room that Sherlock realised he had been so overwhelmed he had forgotten to hug John back.
He pulled his phone from his pocket and quickly searched through it before holding it out to the soldier at his side. "Here, if you please."
"I didn't even know, if you can believe that," John said, apparently changing tracks. "Until you looked at me and said it, I had no idea how you felt. You always said I was unobservant but god, I didn't think it was that bad. Or maybe you were just that good at hiding. But everyone else seems to have known, so I guess this one is on me."
Sherlock frowned. "What on earth could John possibly teach me that I do not already know, other than medicine?"
There are a lot of things Sally could say to that but she stays silent, struck by the casual 'our'. Is that what her life is now? Accidental ally of one Sherlock Holmes, mad nuisance extraordinaire? It seems so.
He forced a crooked smile onto his face. "Afghanistan... wasn't good, Greg. And people keep telling me I need to shift, as if I didn't know, but I don't trust myself anymore. And I refuse to put anyone at risk over it. So I thank you for the invitation but I have to decline. I don't want to put any of your juveniles in harm's way."
The Psy nodded thoughtfully. "As TK, we pose more of a danger to those around us if we lose control, so the dissonance has been set up in a way that will cause us considerably more pain and restrict our thoughts and actions more strongly than those of other Psy. We cannot break Silence fully without endangering those around us, yet to remain Silent is clearly not an option for you any longer. The mating bond and the dissonance combined would kill you."
A pipe has burst in the flat above hers and the water has weakened the ceiling and caused some flooding in her neighbour's place. She was lucky to notice the issue so quickly but she and her neighbours will have to find another place to stay for some time until the building has been refurbished.
Sherlock relaxed a bit more and smiled back at him. "It's all right, John. You don't owe me any explanations."
Changeling law was clear-cut and uncomplicated. If there was a crime, the victim's family or - in the absence of blood relatives - any member of the victim's pack was judge, jury and executioner in one. And in the case of predatory changelings, executioners were literally that. Predatory changelings did not believe in mercy. If a member of their pack was killed or injured, retribution would be swift and violent and completely legal.
Mary lay about two metres away. His knife had gotten her right in the chest, piercing her left lung. It had been a lucky throw, really, and he knew without doubt that it had saved his life. Mary, acting on the sort of instinct he would have expected her to have trained herself out of, had pulled the blade out. The move had done more damage and destroyed any hope of saving her. Not that Sherlock had ever entertained any hopes or desires in that direction.
"Yes, but none of them rank at least 8 on the Gradient," Sherlock said sharply. "We already established it would take a strong Psy to cause this level of damage. Breaking a changeling's shields can take hours. This person did it in a matter of minutes. Exceptionally strong then, almost definitely a Telepath. A Psy with that level of skill will be working in a high-paying job. As this goes for all Psy of this Gradient and higher, they can all be classified as rich or at least well-off. So him being rich doesn't tell us anything his skill set didn't already imply."
John was not at all surprised to find himself waking up in pretty much the same position he had fallen asleep in.
"I take back everything I said," Patricia declared. "Everyone here is either a hot mess or ready to make one."
Sherlock tried not to think about her, alone somewhere with a stranger, scared and crying and calling for her daddy. He knew what he would likely have to do if he wanted any chance of getting her back safe and sound. He didn't like it but he would do it anyway. For her, he would do anything.
He rounded the final corner and there was Sherlock, lying in a half-curled position on the cold cement floor right beneath one bare light bulb, an overturned chair two feet away from him.
Thoroughly amazed, John got up and hopped of his chair, cocking his head as he tried to decide on another sound to focus on. There was a wet dripping coming from somewhere below that sounded like it might be interesting, so he followed the sound towards the door.
"My parents' continued reliance on me as a dog-sitter," he told her smoothly. "Lestrade was just asking how much longer you will be able to stuff Johnny here with treats."
"Bloody hell, mate, this is a surprise!" Lestrade exclaimed, slapping his back and beaming with open delight. "Didn't think I'd see you around again. Worked it all out, have you?"
He smiled to himself. It didn't matter if John ever confirmed it or not. He was what he was and Sherlock ... loved him.
Weronikia screamed in the background and began to sob and into the general confusion came the rest of the guests and staff who had followed John and Sherlock or had been drawn in by the general commotion.
Lestrade, who reached him in just that moment stared at him in utter disbelief. "Is that really the most important question here, Sherlock?"
Time passes, hours swallowed up in chunks, days passing in a blur of crime and something that might be domestic bliss.
"Since you are already showing off, care to also store them away?" John asked as they entered their kitchen. "Bread goes over there, the rest belongs in the fridge."
"Oh." Greg leaned back. That was rather unexpected. "Did he say why? Have you done anything? Left entails in the bathtub or whatever?"
The next word out of his mouth is 'Sherlock' and Sherlock idly, nervously, awards himself a point for another correct deduction.
Emily lowered her gaze. "He hasn't told us anything more than you have. Just that the investigation is ongoing and he can't say any more. We lost two of our own to this killer. The only reasons the pack isn't acting on its thirst for revenge are our lack of a clear target and the treaties. We are not the only ones who suffer. It would not be fair or within our rights to claim the kill when other packs have an equal right to it." She nodded towards Lestrade and Donovan. "So we will let you do your job but we will be watching. And if you need anything, anything at all, you only have to ask. We may not be a large pack, but the resources we do have are yours if you need them."
But soon his attention returned to John. John, who had squared his shoulders and raised his head and was now acting like a normal, functioning human being. Sherlock could see the Captain Watson steel glint in his eye and knew that John would power through the coming hours one way or another.
Someone had sent a message directly to Lestrade's datapad, requesting he come to this address as soon as possible. He knew of only one person who would have the knowledge and the ability to do such a thing, so he had not hesitated.
John's cat, bewildered by the sudden turn of events and craving the skin contact with the Psy he had gotten used to, was harder to contain than usually. But John held on to his restraint. His animalistic side might want to return to last night in the living room, bury his nose in Sherlock's clavicle and lick a long stripe up his neck, but his human side knew that such an action would not be welcomed.
"On the contrary," Sherlock said, rolling his eyes. "So far we have that lady over there, treating herself to a bit of peace and quiet away from her overbearing family; this wealthy investment banker over there; the two sisters who each plan to seduce the banker and ... a waiter who appears to be camper than a row of tents, as the saying goes."
Sherlock sank to his knees before John's armchair, resting his hands on John's thighs and enjoying the low spark of heat that entered his gaze at the gesture. He filed that thought away for later.
Sherlock sighed, feeling the weight of all he had done. "John ... you do know I'm sorry, right? Because I am. If there had been another way-"
From the direction John had just come from came a high creaking noise and his ears twitched towards it. No footsteps. No breathing. Nothing. Just the door, moving ever so slightly and making the hinges creak.
It took John a moment to identify which of the rocks on display Sherlock meant and then he began to laugh.
He was lying flat on his bed, spread-eagled, the covers pushed to the foot of the bed. His hair and clothes stuck to his body and his face was flushed and glistening with sweat. He hadn't reacted to John's entrance at all.
He lowered his gaze. "And I have to admit I never intended to sign. It felt like signing my soul away. I wanted you to stay so badly. I saw the way you looked at me at the function. I saw your jealousy when Alexander flirted with me. It gave me hope that maybe, if I played my cards right, you'd realise you didn't need her to make you happy. You spent so much of the past week complimenting me, I had started to think you were finally catching up. You can't imagine what it felt like when you asked me to sign again. I wanted to refuse, I really did. And then you said
Cursing inwardly, John pulled it out of his pocket. Mary's face lit up the screen but just then he found it hard to be pleased to hear from his fiancée. If only she had waited another five or ten minutes, he might have learned more.
And how was it possible for Sherlock to have "dust in places even a medical man wouldn't expect"? Dust wasn't like sand that somehow got under all your clothes - it tended to cling to the first bit of fabric it encountered instead.
Perhaps it was something in his face or the way he sat, perhaps it was his choice of words or a combination of all of this. Either way, Molly cocked her head and asked quietly: "Does John touch
They spent the evening cuddled together on the sofa, scrolling through hotel websites and trying to decide on which one they liked best. And although they went to bed reasonably early, it took a long time before they actually fell asleep.
Under any other circumstances, it would have been funny to watch the way Sherlock's face drained of all colour, would have been amusing to see him take a step back, wide-eyed, and almost stumble over the small table beside John's chair.
As soon as the door to their flat clicked shut behind them, Sherlock found himself pushed against it and a warm mouth covering his own as John kissed him for all he was worth.
Unable to stop himself, John stepped forward and raised his hand to let it trail down Sherlock's face from his left temple across the arch of his cheekbone towards that full mouth, allowing his fingertips to linger ever so slightly on his lips before dropping away. "Good. I'll give you more things to consider in time."
If John had had any doubts, they vanished at that precise moment. This was Sherlock reaching out for him, actively seeking contact. He would bloody well let him touch John as much and as often as he wished. If it was up to John, no one would ever again deny Sherlock the simple pleasure of touch. He had been denied that long enough.
Sherlock studiously avoided looking at John for fear of what his expression might betray if their gazes met.
Sherlock scowled at them but couldn’t pay them any more attention. This was because just when he paused to inspect a smudged footprint out of habit, John ambled past him in his jeans and Sherlock just happened to glance up, caught sight of John’s backside, and promptly forgot that other people existed. That probably explained why he walked right into two Spanish tourists in his haste to catch up with John.
Oh, how lovely! We were so disappointed when you said it was all for show, we thought you made a fantastic couple. We're so glad to hear you got there in the end.
But while the changelings around him smiled at the thought that their own packs had a similar structure connecting them, Sherlock heard the message she had not been able to bring herself to say out loud.
John looked as wrecked as he felt but his voice was full of conviction. "Don't you get it? I want this, too. Always have. And I didn't know you did, didn't dare hope you did. And then you said it, just like that, like I was supposed to have known, like it was obvious. Perhaps it was to you. Perhaps it should have been to me, if I hadn't been so afraid of it." He shook his head and swallowed. "I'm not afraid of it anymore. The only thing I'm still afraid of is having to live without you."
"Sherlock?," John addressed him, gently gripping his shoulder and flinching when Sherlock whirled around a bit too forcefully.
They concluded their impromptu dance lesson soon after that and wordlessly agreed not to mention it again. John wondered if Sherlock had seen his hands shaking.
But the same thing had already occurred to Sherlock. "No. Sasha Duncan and Faith Nightstar were able to defect because they were not only leaving the PsyNet but also joining a very powerful changeling pack that was equipped to protect them. We do not have the same luxury. I do not doubt that you and I would do a good job of trying to keep us safe but our situation is entirely different. We live in a large city, not some secure and secluded den in the middle of a National Park. Perhaps it could work if we went to rejoin your pack, but you have already made it clear that you do not feel particularly close to them and neither you nor I wish to leave London."
A clap of thunder made him jump and he pressed his head down between his front paws, hoping to somehow dampen the noise a bit. It didn't help.
Sherlock nodded. "I am aware. But I cannot simply break Silence completely. I am a Gradient 9.9 TK. I would put any person around me at risk, including John."
"We will find her," Sherlock said softly. He hadn't bothered flipping on the light and so they were left in the dark with only the lights of the city at night filtering in through the windows, softening the edges of everything.
, Johnny Boy! Not quite your kind's usual habitat, is it? All this concrete and steel. There's nothing but crates for you to climb, no bushes to hide in, no foliage to use for cover."
Sherlock's warm breath on his face, in his lungs, his soft hair curling around John's fingers as he tried to angle Sherlock's head for better access ... god, it was intoxicating.
He held John's gaze, wishing he could shove his words right into John's brain and make him remember them forever, make him understand what he was really trying to say.
He shuddered despite the hot water and finally lifted his head. Might as well finish his shower before the water turned cold.
Mrs Hudson told them all about their neighbour's latest escapades and that her tenants were apparently considering renewing their vows.
Returning to the sitting room, he set the mug down on the coffee table. Rosie was busy petting Redbeard, who had all but melted into the carpet, his tail wagging.
Looking around him, all he sees is an ocean of sentiment and if anyone asked him how that happened, he could tell them about every single drop in it.
He was saved from further conversation about John by Lestrade, who poked his head into the room and went: "Oi, where has Donovan gone?"
They stared at each other for several long moments, finally acknowledging this thing between them and staring it right in the face. John felt as if they were finally on the same page. No words were needed.
"Three guesses who was in it, then, and the first two don't count," Hennings says. "I wonder who the woman was, though."
"I'm too old to stand out in the cold for hours on end just to watch them burn an effigy," Mrs Hudson says. "What are you doing, my dear?"
“Promise me something?” John asked, still not lifting his head. Sherlock willed his heartbeat to remain calm.
The final rehearsal though ... that one was the problem. In all his planning of the event, Sherlock had successfully managed to forget the part where every movie went in for the close-up: the vows and kiss.
His hand strayed to his pocket, feeling the folded letter he kept on his person at all times. A reminder, should he ever need one, of why he was in this situation. Of the promise he had broken and the debt he owed.
He gave her a look of utter disbelief, then shrugged. "You can certainly try. Do let me know when you have, so I'll know not to waste any mental energy on it."
Only when she is at home, with the door locked and curtains drawn, does she open the box and lift out the little fake bottom in between the layers of chocolates. A sleek black phone is nestled in amongst the chocolates.
They finished up the interviews an hour later and it was hard to tell which of the interviewing officers had drawn the shorter straw.
It took him several minutes until he felt able to get up and stumble into the bathroom on shaky legs.
John opened his mouth, blinked in puzzlement, and shut it again. "Fine. I'll talk to her. But you have to promise it won't be dangerous so I can in turn honestly tell
Mary sighed. "Fine. Look, I know the two of you are practically attached at the hip and that this isn't the easiest thing for him." For a split second, John thought he saw something like defeat in her eyes, but a moment later she smiled warmly.
The memory was slightly hazy but he remembered it clearly enough to know it hadn't been a dream. Drifting along on the fuzzy edge between sleep and consciousness, he had felt a warm body stretched out by his side, solid heat from his shoulder all the way down to his feet. He had felt Sherlock lean in, his face merely inches away from John's ear so he could whisper the words he had clearly been gearing up to say all week.
He knew it would all clear up eventually. Quite likely John would show up and make an offhanded comment and suddenly everything would coalesce into a well-rounded picture as it always did.
They peeled away from the pack that had surrounded mother and child and was engaged in what appeared to be a group hug. Sherlock thought even with all the experiments he and John had indulged in being included in one of those would kill him within seconds.
"I did, didn't I?" John wondered if Sherlock could hear his heart beating its way out of his chest. "As a medical man, I have to say that a hot tub would be a fantastic way to prevent frostbite and hypothermia." He paused for a deliberate three seconds. "And it's quite a big tub, which is handy because we really shouldn't have one of us waiting for too long while the other is having a bath."
"Any signs of someone trying to force the lock. Just because the murder happened at the back door doesn't mean the front door can't have been involved."
John's blood turned to ice in his veins. Suddenly feeling like an intruder and remembering the task Sherlock had given him, he backed away. He needed a moment to regroup, to let Sherlock's words sink in fully and think about what to do next.
One morning, John was woken by Sherlock shaking his shoulder and gasping his name, a note of urgency in his voice that had John sitting up, claws out before he even opened his eyes.
John nudged Lestrade's knee in greeting and allowed the DI to scratch his neck before going in search of Sally and the bag of treats she now kept in her desk. Sherlock watched him with an odd sense of fond indulgence, having resigned himself to the fact that John would always charm wherever he went, no matter what body he happened to occupy. Once his friend had left Lestrade's office, Sherlock turned back to the DI and pulled the documents out of his coat.
"He probably hit his head on the floor when the transformation started," someone said but Sherlock didn't even pay them enough attention to figure out who was talking. He kept all his attention on John, tracing the familiar lines of his face and searching for any inconsistencies.
Moments later, the two of them joined Mycroft outside, slid into the car without further comment and were dropped off at Baker Street less than twenty minutes later.
John blinked, torn from his thoughts as the ground under his feet changed from the distinctive asphalt of the park's walkway to the rough stone plates of London foot walks.
The contents of John's phone were exactly what Sherlock had expected to find. He smiled grimly to himself just as his own phone buzzed in his pocket.
Sherlock shrugged. "It may be. A high-profile murder could be seen as political and further destabilise the Net."
Less than ten seconds and he was already missing John so fiercely he thought it might burn a hole right through his chest, through his shirt, through his coat.
Perhaps he really should start keeping John and John-the-dog separate. John and Johnny. Yes. His flatmate and his dog.
Sally rolls her eyes. "If you say so. Come on, we need to get back to the Yard. I have piles and piles of paperwork to catch up on and we still haven't found enough evidence to arrest Lawrence for the Nothing Hill burglaries."
Molly smiled at him as she reached in to extract the stomach. "You are much more relaxed when he is around."
"I never shoved my phone number at any of them," John said. "And I actually accept 'No' as an answer."
Sherlock flagged down a cab with his usual poise. John had never once seen an unoccupied cabbie ignore Sherlock when he held out his arm. In fact, he was reasonably sure that sometimes even drivers of occupied cabs had to forcibly stop themselves from pulling over.
Sherlock clung to his mate as if he might disappear, mouth clumsy and uncoordinated as he returned the kiss. His mind was swimming with endorphins and he was still struggling to compute.
He closed his eyes again. After a couple of minutes, Redbeard plopped down next to him, resting his head on Sherlock's stomach. He started petting him absent-mindedly, anchoring himself in the here and now to keep from flying apart under the weight of the past and all the what ifs.
The silence dragged on all the way to London. It felt as if, in the days they had not been able to, he and Sherlock had forgotten how to talk to each other.
Sherlock tried to pick that angry rant apart but his logical mind would only allow one reply. "So you disapprove of Psy having to obey Silence, yet you do not wish to help me find a way around it? My entire point is that building up a resistance to touch will eventually help me avoid these pain triggers. Exposing myself to touch in a controlled environment will help me build a resistance for when I am touched outside of experimental parameters and hopefully prevent any adverse effects."
John shook his head as his mouth went dry. He also vividly remembered Sherlock relaxing once he had hastily assured him that, no, he did not want or expect anything, that it had merely been an observation of a fact.
A dozen astonished gazes turned towards Anderson, who stood a couple of feet away with his arms crossed, a sneer on his face. "If you ask me, we should just get rid of all of you, spare ourselves a lot of trouble. No one needs a Psy anyw-"
"Lestrade's nostrils have been flaring every time he got close to either of us for the entire duration of our presence in his office. How do I smell?"
Sherlock shook his head. "Idiot. If you think I could live without you, you clearly haven't been paying attention."
He was panicking, there was no other explanation for this, no way of talking around it. His breath was coming too fast and his pulse was sky-rocketing and there was enough adrenalin in his veins to keep an entire platoon alert and ready to fight.
"It's the mating bond," John explained, rubbing a hand over his face. "It makes me irrational. It will pass - it's just the first couple of days. All I want is to have you to myself, to keep you away from anyone else."
He sighed and rubbed his eyes. "Listen, I want you two to get along. You're important to me and I'm going to marry her. I don't want the rest of our lives to be filled with these arguments and you two snapping at each other all the time."
Joining him on the worn carpet, Sherlock did as he was told and within minutes they were both immersed in the old files, adding each name, threat and case number to the Excel document Sherlock had created on his laptop, which stood in the space between them.
"We do have a daughter to think of, you know," John reminded him, though he couldn't help but smile in return.
"I'm not surprised," Lestrade said, buying the excuse without batting an eye. "If you don't force him to leave his phone in another room, you never get to see his face when he's waiting for a text. Figures Mrs Hudson wouldn't like that very much."
Sherlock leaned forward, propping his elbows on his knees and clasping his hands. “Lestrade said he can’t find anything about Mary’s whereabouts, activities or even her general existence beyond the past five years. I think she may fall directly under your ... jurisdiction.”
It was one of those positions that couldn't possibly be comfortable if arranged but felt perfect if you woke up with your body warm and loose from sleep. He knew his right arm was probably asleep - it felt rather numb - and his leg was going to cramp if he stayed in this position for much longer but he wouldn't mind staying like this forever.
Then he tilted his head and examined it. And then he went and dragged Sherlock off the couch and into the kitchen.
“Well, you failed,” John said, grinning. “So please don’t even try this time. I’d like to be cool tonight.”
Sometimes it was easy to forget that Mrs Hudson had no one left but her sister, who didn't live in London and whom she therefore only rarely saw. And then on nights like this, John found himself reminded that while he and Sherlock may be the surrogate sons she had never had, Mrs Hudson was also the mother figure both of them needed. Baker Street without her would not feel like home. Sherlock had been quite right all these months ago. England would fall if she left Baker Street.
Sherlock thought. "You never specified which location your Christmas was supposed to be traditional for, so I went with the most picturesque version I could find."
Something else occurred to him and he asked the question more to distract Molly from her course of enquiry than because he really wanted to.
"It's bloody early in the US, John. If your friends know anything at all about negotiations, they'll hopefully know not to ring the other party out of bed at arse o'clock. And even if they did, the actual conversation would have taken far longer than the time that has passed. It likely took them an hour to get back to their den, considering the traffic at this time of day, so they would have only had an hour to request a call. And that's assuming that such a large pack as our intended conversation partner doesn't already have a series of meetings and other engagements scheduled for the day, all of which take precedence over a UK pack calling for a chat."
The man sat down in the chair usually reserved for clients while Sherlock and John sank into their respective armchairs.
All further conversation was postponed for several long, happy minutes, until they heard voices as someone else entered the greenhouse and reluctantly separated. And if they were a bit out of breath and seemed a bit flushed, well, that was to be expected in a place as hot and humid as this.
"Thanks Greg. It sounds like a fun outing and I'd love to, but," he hesitated, not sure how to put it. "I don't ..."
"Of course I am," John said. "I've never been more serious about anything in my life. She's my daughter and she loves you. And I love you, too. I want you to come home, to see her grow up, to help me raise her and see her grow into the best possible version of herself. To think that we spent three years apart because of our utter failure to talk to each other ... god, you have no idea how much it kills me, Sherlock."
Good start that. Get his attention. But now that he looked at his name there, he realised it was stupid. Sherlock would know he was meant. If John gave him the letter, of course he would be the recipient. No one else. Didn't make sense to write his name.
Lestrade had to agree that John had a point there. It really wasn't difficult to imagine Sherlock doing something simply because it was the logical thing to do. However, the picture fell apart the moment you added John to the equation.
"You looked after Mrs Hudson while I was ... away," he says. "She told me. I won't ever forget that."
"That's not what I meant," Sherlock said, shaking his head. "If you get injured, where do I take you? Who is your pack healer? It can't be Emily. I know she's a healer, you can just tell, but she's not your pack."
Molly nodded. "I can't find the evidence but I can sort of feel it when I focus. Like the smell of smoke long after the fire is out."
To his shock, Sherlock promptly returned the caress of thumb on skin as soon as their hands were clasped again.
Deciding he deserved a bit of a rest, John stayed where he was. His lips were still tingling from the sudden and rather passionate kiss. To be honest, he hadn't known Sherlock had it in him. It appeared he had been sadly mistaken. And if the thought that all this had been merely for the sake of getting Harold to back off caused a small sting somewhere deep in his chest, he wisely chose to ignore it.
Was it his imagination or did Sherlock's voice sound huskier than usual? And that look on his face ... was that mere confusion and worry, or was there something else?
What had given Greg the idea that John was leading Sherlock on? Leading him where? No, he mustn't play stupid. He knew precisely what Lestrade had been saying and he didn't quite know what to make of the suggestion. It seemed odd for the DI to believe that John was the one giving Sherlock false hopes when, as far as John knew, he was the only one who had ever hoped that perhaps ...
John found it on the floor of Sherlock's bedroom and brought it to him. He barely waited for the lead to be fastened to his collar before proceeding to tow Sherlock down the stairs and to the front door.
They exchanged friendly greetings. Emily and Tyson were both changelings, members of an ocelot pack based in Camberwell, and they both hugged John in welcome.
They were both in great spirits when they went back to Baker Street with celebratory take-out and a bottle of wine that definitely didn't go with the Chinese food they had gotten but would be drunk anyway.
Even now, Sherlock’s words were at the front of his mind. Was he right? Had growing up during the Thatcher years, with rampant homophobia all around him, affected his view of himself? John found he couldn’t argue the point. He had always considered himself open-minded and forward-thinking. He had supported Harry even as she broke with their parents, had embraced Clara as part of the family from the get-go. But the longer he thought about it, the more obvious it became that he had never extended the same courtesy to himself.
John huffed at him but remained perfectly still as Sherlock gently started to towel him dry, taking care not to accidentally pull at his fur. "There, that should do it. Go upstairs and lie in front of the fire for a while, that should get you nice and dry."
Sherlock tilted his head, trying to figure out if she had an ulterior motive for asking. But this was Molly; he doubted she had ever had an ulterior motive in her life.
"You can rest assured that I will do my best to find out what precisely happened and why," Sherlock said calmly. "But I cannot promise you that you will like what I find out."
Sherlock felt his heart jolt in his chest and wondered if he would ever get used to this. To John being here. His
"He says he would be happy to help," she announced a minute later. "Your location on the other side of the Atlantic makes everything a bit complicated but he said if you could provide him with a location of where to meet, he will find you."
Sherlock frowns. Taxes are something that happens to other people. He pays his of course, or at least Mycroft does for him, but still, Sherlock is fairly sure taxes aren't due for at least another two months.
"Perhaps it makes the game more entertaining to have multiple players," Sherlock suggested. "I wouldn't know. I have never played any game besides chess and logic puzzles." He thought it prudent not to mention the clapping game he and John had engaged in.
"I, uh ... no." He rubbed the back of his neck with his free hand, suddenly feeling awkward. "Mary and I went to the registrar's office today."
"Fine," he said, snatching in a breath. "Just ... thinking about the wedding, is all. I can't believe it's less than a month away."
Sherlock frowned at him. "Yes, of course. She's your daughter, John. I don't care who else contributed to her DNA. From the moment I first saw her, I knew she was all you. In every way that matters, she's yours alone."
He stared down at it, uncomprehending. It was the absolute last thing he had expected. The handwriting was shaky but unmistakably his.
“And you’re going to claim it’s not the Yard’s Black Museum?” John asked. “Because I’m not sure I can believe that.”
He stared at John, drinking him in. They were lying side by side in the warm grass, the sun shining down on them and glinting in John's grey hair. He looked so good it hurt and Sherlock's heart swooped, tittering dangerously between overwhelming joy at seeing him, gratefulness for his own subconsciousness, and yet more heartbreak.
Emily eyed the Psy seated diagonally across from her with open curiosity. This was John's Psy, then. Sherlock Holmes. An unconventional name for an unconventional Psy.
"You like it," she concluded. "You like it when he touches you. You let him do it and you tell yourself you are only placating your flatmate for your own benefit, but you know you're lying to yourself."
He turned at the sound of his name and found Stamford and some of their old mates from university at a table not too far away. Grabbing his pint, he went to join them.
"Considering Tollers were bred for bloodsport, do you think you would enjoy hunting down a criminal in this form?"
Sherlock smiled and responded, keeping his voice low. "Sometimes I fear you overestimate my ability to suss out a murderer, John."
John felt his heart swell at the idea of the future Sherlock was painting for them both. "Her first time being picked up from the nursery by you. Her first birthday party with you there. Her first science experiment."
"I certainly think you're an idiot," Sherlock said smoothly. "He's clearly your man, you got that part right. But how it could have escaped your notice that he hid the goods beneath a fake bottom in his freezer is a mystery."
Sherlock shrugged and leaned back in his chair. "Of course. Most criminals get unreasonably angry when you try to arrest them. Or break into their lair. Or both. I get into a lot of fights. Would be nice to have a second set of fists on my side. Or a doctor to fix me up afterwards." He idly examined his knuckles, hoping John would notice the scrabs from his most recent argument with a robber. "And of course there's the murder victims."
"You're upset," Sherlock repeated. He paused, eyes narrowing as he stared at John. "Of course," he murmured, more to himself than to John, before continuing. "I'm sorry. I should have taken your worry over your sister's alcoholism into account before getting drunk myself. It has clearly triggered uncomfortable memories in you."
"Perhaps the shattering of the shields was merely a means to an end," Sherlock mused. "The goal might have been to kill the victim or at least leave him brain damaged without leaving any physical trace that can lead back to the killer. It is no secret that any attempt to break a changeling's mental shields will leave the victim with all the mental capacity of a toddler at best."
"I liked you better when you were still human," Sherlock complained and tried to sit up. Apparently, this was when he noticed his current physical state. He cursed. "Bloody fantastic."
Sherlock shook his head. "I think he didn't need any chemicals this time around because his victim was Psy. Low gradient, I would say. Any mental shields he had would have been far easier to break than those of a changeling."
"Short of not strangling him, I don't have any," she says. "Not to step on your toes but I don't think we're very well-suited."
"I knew I wouldn't be able to stand it, so I took ... precautions. When we returned here right after it happened, I made you go take a shower, remember?"
He didn't know if he wanted to laugh or cry. He was dimly aware of Rafe returning the greeting and introducing the other occupants of the room but could not pay attention. Up until this moment, he had not allowed himself to fully believe the stories he had heard.
When Sherlock woke some minutes later, he did so slowly, which was a rarity, and then cursed quietly as he noticed the state he was in.
Instead, with a groan, he dived back in, breathing in deeply while he still could and taking in as much of John as possible before swallowing around him.
He had, Sherlock recalled. He had been wondering. And now he was starting to wonder if he should have simply asked instead. If he should have deduced it instead of trying to give John what privacy he could, to deliberately turn his eyes away, to not see what his mind would deduce almost on autopilot.
Mycroft nodded at him. "And you, brother mine. I suggest you do something about your little problem, and soon. The tension in here is thick enough to choke on and I'm sure I do not wish to know what John's poor sensitive nose has to endure right now."
"Shields," Sherlock said. "Mental shields like steel traps around your head. This is why I think the Psy victims are low gradient. Anyone of a high gradient has shields that are close to impossible to penetrate."
John tries to reason that she has antibodies now but Sherlock won't hear a word. "She and I might have caught different strains of the virus, John! I will not have her suffer so."
"I don't know why," Sherlock admitted. "I thought it was his grief catching up with him. But you did not seem convinced. You seem to think it's because I ... because I told him 'No'."
Sherlock shook his head and opened his eyes, apparently resigned to the fact that he wasn't dreaming.
"Mmh, better get used to it," John told him. "Now that I've got that first shift out of the way, it's going to be a much more frequent occurrence."
Sherlock smelled of ice and rosin and chemicals and London - every gritty alley, every brightly-lit high street, every tourist trap, and the bank of the river Thames. That, and danger.
John made that half-snorting, half-huffing sound again that meant he thought Sherlock was being ridiculous and - in this case - that he had never cared about what sort of impression he made.
Sherlock tried to analyse what John's touch had felt like but quickly found he was lacking the necessary vocabulary to do so. Psy knew how to distinguish joy and sorrow, pain and anger, exhaustion and exhilaration in the other races. Anything that went beyond that left them stumped. Experiencing any of these emotions first-hand was not an option.
Sherlock had to make sure the house was clean and emptied of any food items, ensure it was closed up properly to discourage any burglars (though he doubted anyone in the vicinity had ambitions in that direction) and - most importantly - find a solution for his bees. He obviously couldn't take them with him. The lack of space at 221b aside, he was fairly certain that border control would throw a fit if he attempted to bring three beehives into the country. Things like pet passports, vaccinations and quarantine were sort of moot points when it came to several million bees, after all.
Sherlock blinked up at him and beamed. "Oh, John! Just in time, I wanted your opinion on something."
And oh, there were things he wasn't saying, John could tell. Suddenly, he wanted to know but even as he opened his mouth to ask, the door opened and an older doctor came in.
"Come on," Sherlock said, hopping out of the rental jeep and starting to unload their bags. "We've got a few hours of daylight left, might as well make use of them and explore the area."
He had been so careful to keep them hidden, had avoided getting injured in any way that would force him to take off his shirt in front of John, had even gone so far as to hide minor injuries sustained while taking down suspects for the same reason.
He shuffled into the bathroom, relieved to know that at least he had managed to put of seeing Sherlock for a couple of hours, perhaps a day or two. Just enough to find his feet, to regain his composure. Just enough to give himself a chance to not carry his heart on his sleeve, now that Mary was no longer in the picture.
"Oh, is that all," John muttered. It had been months but he still found it difficult to accept that his flatmate was not only Psy but also a genius, even by Psy standards. Idiots, Sherlock frequently said, could be found in all of the three races. It was simply that the Psy put even more stock in education than the other two, drilling their students relentlessly. Mental discipline was an important skill for every Psy and once the foundation for discipline had been laid, it was easy enough to adapt it to everything from controlling their powers to learning the materials provided at school.
The assorted scientists standing around barely paid him any attention, muttering to themselves and writing calculations and notes on their notepads - a bit belatedly in Sherlock's opinion.
It took a lot of restraint to keep his hands on John’s shoulders, to not move closer to him, to not lean forward until he could put his mouth to John’s earlobe and murmur teasing little promises into his warm skin.
But before that, John had stepped closer. And all of a sudden Sherlock knew that he could not let him go. Not like this. Not without at least trying to make him see, to make him understand.
Snow crunched under him as he rolled onto his back, pulling John with him and moaning again as his friend's weight pressed him down.
John nodded. "Me neither. Right, I had better get going. Try to sort out this mess before we all suffer any longer."
John crossed her name out viciously, then scribbled over it until it was entirely impossible to read. There. That would show her.
"If you had even a fraction of the resources available to me and if it was one of your brothers, can you honestly tell me you would not do the same thing?"
"Wrong. It's a person holding a newspaper," Sherlock corrected. He squinted at the screen. "Male, from the overall posture and position of the hands. Expensive suit."
Amanda Conall reached her front door on the opposite side of the street with barely a glance in their direction and unslung her backpack to search for her keys. While she was busy, Lestrade put his paper aside, stood and crossed the street.
“Oh, it's so good to see you back here again,” she said, taking the chair opposite him. “I admit I did start to worry. You were gone for so long.”
The dog was about as big as she was, but if Rosie was worried, she didn't show it. Instead, she looked very serious indeed as Sherlock showed her how to let Redbeard sniff at her hand and giggled when the dog licked it.
John didn't know how much time passed before he heard the door open. Three years had gone by but he didn't need to lift his head to know who had come to find him. He had always been able to tell when Sherlock was near and so he merely sniffed and wiped his eyes and didn't look up.
The other man laughed. "Right." He glanced around the busy train station and licked his lips. "So what are you doing here, then? Seems to me that someone who can read a person's life story at a glance would find a more lucrative occupation than busking."
He was already knocking on the bathroom door before consciously deciding to do so. It was time for them to sit and talk about this. About Sherlock's time away, about how John hadn't dealt with it, and every other thing they never spoke about.
The young man was currently being deposited in one of the waiting police cars by a rather amused looking Sally Donovan. Having been one of the first to arrive at the scene, she had gotten a nice eyeful of drenched consulting detective before someone had kindly offered him the blanket. Naturally, the fabric did little to conceal the way his wet clothes clung to his body, and instead its bright colour only served to draw more attention to his miserable state.
He left the office with a spring in his step, feeling as if the entire mess was finally about to make sense.
They are pressed in close and tight, their quick breaths warming the small space, and they're both struggling to stay quiet when what they really want to do is to laugh with exhilaration.
"Hopefully at least as much as I love you," Sherlock whispered back. "But you can show me later. I'll be all to happy to have you demonstrate it at length."
And yet, here he was again, surrounded by members of Scotland Yard, the flashing lights of multiple police cars and an ambulance visible through the large glass panels that made up an entire wall of the pool in question.
The look on Sherlock's face at these three words was beyond compare, something unbearably soft and vulnerable, all dressed up in a thick layer of disbelief.
"We'll start very carefully," John said. "I don't know how much you can stand. If there is anything that triggers you, your-"
John did change into his pyjamas and then slid onto the other half of Sherlock's large bed. There was a good thirty centimetres of distance between them. It would be fine.
"I managed to disable them temporarily," Sherlock said. "But I recognised there were some things that did not seem quite right about them and I did not dare get too close."
It was only after he had left the room that Sherlock realised he had been so overwhelmed he had forgotten to hug John back.
"I'm not sure why Mycroft never mentioned it," Sherlock said in between bites. "You'll have to ask him yourself. But when I realised that you didn't remember, I told Mrs Hudson not to make a fuss about it that would make you uncomfortable."
Before he knew what he was doing, John had reached out and caught hold of Sherlock's elbow, pulling him back. Sherlock hit his head on the light bulb again, sending the circle of light spinning wildly.
Thank you all so much for joining me on this adventure and trusting me to make things right for our boys in the end.
And just as he had found out about that and started to really enjoy himself, it was all over. Or would be, anyway. He didn't know quite how to feel about that.
Good lord, the man was being extraordinarily thick right now. John decided to blame the exhaustion - of course Sherlock hadn't slept at all these past four or five days. Grumbling in frustration at his inability to communicate his meaning, he nudged Sherlock again, then walked towards the kitchen, where he turned and gave him an expectant look. Sherlock tipped his head to the side, regarding him thoughtfully. "So this isn't about the dog bed, is it?"
"Yes, isn't it great? I don't even have to bother remembering a new name. Turns out he responds to 'John' just as well." Sherlock sounded as excited as John had ever heard him about a triple murder.
John's mind flashed back to countless mornings spent in their pyjamas in Baker Street, Sherlock in his dressing gown with his hair still ruffled from sleep or a sleepless night, and John lazing about until noon before finally gathering the energy to get dressed. He wondered if Sherlock had remembered the same thing. He probably had. He wondered if Sherlock missed these mornings, too. He probably didn't.
"Lovely evening for a ride, isn't it?," he said, giving her his most charming smile just because he could.
"Can't leave him alone in the flat all day long," Sherlock said, greeting Donovan, who was currently pinning printouts regarding their latest case to the cork board, with a nod. "He likes to chew on things and I wouldn't want John to come home and find our kitchen table short of a leg or two."
Mrs Hudson found the remote on the mess that was their coffee table and turned on the BBC evening news.
"Well, not for false accounting, but we could adjust the formula accordingly," she said. "Let me get a pen and paper."
Lestrade smirked. "Did John bully you into going to bed? Who would have thought he'd have to be turned into a dog for that to happen."
He waited for the older man to safely deposit the tea tray on the desk and sit down himself before he spoke.
"They just arrived," John said, his ears having picked up the familiar sound of a car stopping and a stretcher being brought into this part of the building.
Oblivious to Sherlock's increasing lack of a thought process, John walked on and left him with no choice but to follow.
It took actual effort not to reach into his pocket in search of the letter. He always carried it with him. There was no reason why John would lie about this. What did he make of Sherlock still carrying this around three years later?
"Well at least one of them is currently asleep," Patricia said, not quite managing to maintain a pokerface.
John bounded up the stairs with a low bark, leaving Sherlock to close the door and follow him at a more sedate pace.
With three races as different as changelings, humans and Psy, the law had to be adjusted and the general rule was that the law of the victim's race applied. To avoid arguments, any humans mated into changeling packs fell under changeling law.
They reached Baker Street by early evening and the only time Sherlock had spoken had been shortly before their arrival when he called Angelo to order their usual.
John whined at him and gave a complicated shrug, which Sherlock took to mean that he had an answer but no possibility of properly expressing it at the time.
He remembered how he had once determined to make Sherlock feel wanted and loved, to make him never go without this feeling again. Now was his chance and he would make the most of it. You didn't get everything you had ever wanted served on a silver platter without accepting it.
John thought about what to say next. "My senses were so much better than you can imagine," he finally said. "I heard the trains moving in and out of Baker Street station, rattling beneath the city. I heard the "Mind the gap" announcements. I heard your heartbeat from up in my room at night when everything else was quieter. I could hear every breath you took and Mrs Hudson snoring and the neighbours down the street arguing. And my nose ... god, the scents. The pollution levels are terrible but the disinfectant in Baskerville and in St. Bart's was worse. I was so glad when you asked Donovan to take me out for a walk rather than forcing me to stay there."
"Is that the famous Three Continents Watson reputation you are referring to?" Sherlock asked. He was trying hard to sound unaffected but John could hear his voice waver ever so slightly and he didn't even need that - not when Sherlock's scent wrote its own story in the air.
Sherlock didn't know what his expression showed but there was an answering flare of heat in John's eyes that turned his throat dry.
He had been thinking about it on and off ever since John had moved in. The absolute silence of his footsteps, the way he could nap anywhere, anytime, and sit in the same spot for hours, patiently waiting on stake-outs while Sherlock was ready to bounce across the room within minutes. Cat, yes.
Rosie barely stirred while he changed her into her pyjamas but her fingers curled around her plush bee when he placed it in her hand. He stared down at it, her little hand holding on to the black-and-yellow toy, and thought about Sherlock picking it out in France, putting a short-range GPS tracker in it and sending it to Mrs Hudson to pass along. He hadn't even noticed that the tiny label was in French. Perhaps he really was as oblivious as Sherlock had always said.
"I was traveling on business," he said shortly. "The heat was quite disagreeable but I never struggled with getting a connection. It was quite the opposite to this place in every way."
Sally spends Christmas Eve with her family, exchanging gifts as an afterthought to a dinner that leaves her so stuffed she thinks she won't ever want to eat again, and a lot of shared laughter.
"Ohhh, how is my Johnny doing?" his mother interrupted, clearly also remembering her part in this game. "Let me talk to him."
Here, Sherlock rolled his eyes. "He thought it would be splendid to have me 'settling down'. He hoped you would be a good influence on me. He liked the idea of having someone legally obliged to be on my side against the rest of the world, as he put it. You didn't have a hard time convincing him to speed up the process for us. And because you were the one asking for it to happen, he had no reason to believe that it was a scheme of mine. He seemed... pleased."
He looked harried and now that Sherlock took the time to really look at him, he could see the signs of stress and long shifts at the clinic. John was telling the truth.
It was unlikely to be a client. There hadn't been a doorbell and no client would have waited this long without interrupting him. No client would have stayed for the apparent ramblings of a madman.
John had a perfect answer lined up for that one - namely that he was not the one prone to destroying their flat - but naturally couldn't say anything, so he merely huffed and twitched a little.
Kathleen Jones was found dead in her flat eighteen months ago, shot in the head at point blank range. There were no signs of a break-in, no discernible motive and, most frustratingly, no suspects.
"Remember how I said I didn't care how quickly you solved this case, we'd stay here all week anyway? I can think of some fun ways to fill all that spare time and I really don't want you to be distracted." Smiling, John stretched a little to place a kiss under Sherlock's jaw, unable to resist the temptation of his skin when it was so close.
He had just been contemplating the relative merits of staying in and watching telly all day over going out and doing something that wouldn't make his day off feel like a complete waste when Sherlock's text had come in and sent him racing across the city.
"Yes, I noticed that too. Very religious, the Forsythes, it appears." Sherlock tapped his pursed lips in thought. "Very interesting indeed. And quite observant of you. I expected you to be more focused on any smells than the wall decoration. Did you hear anything of interest?"
Sherlock kept his attention on the case board, taking in what little information the Yard had been able to collect. He was aware of several pairs of eyes boring into his back and did his best not to let them bother him. His brother's gaze weighted heaviest of all and that one could not be ignored.
John shrugged and smiled at her. "I realised I've been a bit preoccupied with all the stuff happening recently. Rebuilding my friendship with Sherlock, trying to get him to sign the divorce papers, looking after him when he got sick ... we haven't had a day to the two of us for a while and I thought you deserved a bit of spoiling. Consider it an apology for how crazy our life has become all of a sudden."
"Ha. Good point," Sherlock conceded. "Not to worry, though. John will only turn lethal if anyone tries to do either of us harm."
John took that as his cue to interfere after all. He tried not to question why the ability to take action filled him with relief.
Still, their deal had him worried. At some point, he would have to sit down and listen and he would learn what had happened and why Sherlock had gone and he still wasn't sure he wanted to know. Wasn't sure he wanted to hear what had been worth leaving him like this, which adventures Sherlock had had without him. Two years were a very long time to claim he had wanted to come home but hadn't.
It was noon when he managed to shuffle outside under his own stream. John had a shift at the clinic and so he was alone when he climbed into the car Mycroft had sent. He slumped into the seat as the driver closed the door behind him, put his seatbelt on and dozed through the entire drive back to Baker Street, where the driver had to shake his shoulder to rouse him.
She wasn't exactly ecstatic to be stuck with the freak on this trip, but Lestrade had wanted her to accompany Sherlock to the morgue, reasoning that Holmes was as likely to run off after a lead immediately as he was to report back about it. Usually, John would be the one to send Lestrade a quick text about what they were up to or about what Sherlock had found if the freak couldn't be bothered, but John wasn't here. It was therefore the sensible option to have someone accompany him and alert the Yard of his findings. And since Lestrade was tied up in a longer phone conference with the Chief Superintendent about this most recent murder, the thankless task fell to Sally.
"S-seriously, Sh-Sherlock, why are we here?" he asked. "It's Christmas Eve, we're in Sweden and we've got a lovely hotel room with its own fireplace."
That meant that whoever had taken Sherlock had taken him without force or with as little force as possible. They must have been quick about it, too, because if they didn't manage to knock him out from the get go, they would end up with their brains plastered to the next wall. Attacking a TK-Psy was not the smartest move a person could make and John for his part wouldn't want to be in their shoes when it happened.
"Well it can't have been from the bin, the angle is all wrong and the bruise suggests a hand rather than a blunt object."
He had never even thought such a thing were possible, had never even considered creating an entirely separate network. It seemed so obvious in hindsight. Usually, when Psy dropped out of the Net, they were assumed to be dead for no Psy could survive without the biofeedback. But if what Sasha said was true, then there was a big chance that a lot of other Psy had not actually died but simply ... faked their deaths in the most obvious manner. Drop out of the Net and form your own while the remaining Psy believe you to be dead.
It would be so easy. Just to reach out, to brush his hand along that impossible cheekbone, to watch those iridescent eyes snap open and focus on his face, just to look at him and for once not hide ... to see Sherlock recoil.
John accepted the key from the innkeeper and his bag of clothes from Sherlock and marched up the stairs.
He couldn't help but stop again, though, and turn towards that familiar house once more. Deep down, he didn't want to leave. This was home, had always been home, and his every instinct cried out against walking away from it.
If he were human, John would have snorted and pointed out the obvious flaw in that statement - that Sherlock himself would not hesitate to experiment on him out of sheer curiosity.
Oh, he knew a lot about him, of course. His habits, his likes and dislikes. But it seemed as if no matter how hard he tried, no matter how much information he gathered, he never got to the sum of the parts.
Sherlock waited. It was early morning and he was surprisingly tired and currently trying not to doze off on a park bench.
"I did. I told Mike earlier this morning I must be a difficult person to find a flatmate for and now here he is, just after lunch, with an old friend recently returned from Afghanistan. I've got my eye on a place in Baker Street, together we ought to be able to afford it."
He had to repeat that phrase in his head, it sounded so alien. The idea of him and Sherlock doing anything of the sort was ... well. Not in the cards. Not even remotely possible. Apart from the not exactly minor fact of John's own approaching wedding to a very lovely woman whom he adored, there was the matter of Sherlock's self-professed utter lack of interest in any kind of sexual relationship with anyone these days.
John knew that was bullshit. Sherlock may lack the words to express sentiment or even understand what it felt like, but even he was not robotic enough to not care about his own survival - and he would be lost without his brilliant mind.
It would have sounded a bit more convincing if it wasn't for the slight tremor in his voice and the continued refusal to look at John as he started moving towards the door again.
"It's a copy of the photographs from your wedding day," Lestrade said. "All taken by the wedding photographer. We're done processing them and I figured you might like to have them. I know Mary wasn't who we all thought she was but there must still be some happy memories on there. Friends and family and so on."
"Indeed? Only I can't help but notice that we have been here for several hours, it is almost 10pm and you have not looked at your phone once, let alone sent a text or made a phone call."
Lestrade paused, considering. "Doesn't he have a brother? Granted, Psy don't give a shit about family unless they're somehow useful to them, but do you think he'd be willing to help?"
"Any body will respond appropriately if stimulated correctly," Sherlock said coolly. "I'm surprised you think I could not fake the rest of my reaction accordingly."
The sitting room had been cleaned by someone - Mrs Hudson? - and there was no sign of any of the papers pertaining to the wedding and his meticulous planning thereof. Mycroft, then. It was as if the whole thing had never happened and he didn't know whether to be relieved or angry. Burning it all would have been nice but not having to deal with it again also had its merits.
Holmes looks at her as if he only noticed her just now. "I might ask you the same thing," he says, his eyes roving up and down her body in that way he has that is not a leer but somehow more intrusive than anything the common arse on the street does with women. As if he's reading her secrets right off the wrinkles in her clothes.
"Not your fault," Sherlock said, clearly trying to adopt an unaffected air and failing utterly. "I was never much good at any of this. Sentiment. I know there's someone else, he's never made a secret out of that. I just ... I suppose I deluded myself into thinking he'd change his mind before it's too late."
Sighing in relief as the warm water closed around his body, John reclined in the tub and closed his eyes, resting his head against the edge. "Care to join me?"
John frowned. "Won't she have to talk with their Wing Leader first, to get permission to enter their territory?"
He licked his lips, thinking back to a question he had been meaning to ask at Angelo's restaurant earlier that evening. "So you've never...?"
After all, this was yet another thing he was unlikely to witness again once this week was over. John asleep, that was. It didn't really matter where. Opportunities to see John sleeping in a bed had always been few and far between, on the rare out-of-town cases where separate hotel rooms were not a possibility. On most of these occasions, John had bullied him into sleeping as well, and so the opportunity to watch him all night had been wasted. And the ultimate version of John sleeping, the very best option of all, was not one he could bear to contemplate at all without losing his mind. It would remain unachievable forever.
He hadn’t ever expected to meet anyone who could possibly fit into his life the way Mary had, not after Sherlock had died ... and then he had come back and somehow that had worked, too, and John had never questioned it, had never once wondered if perhaps getting Sherlock back and having Mary at the same time might be too good to be true.
When he went to bed several hours later, bullied there by John insistently pulling on his trouser leg, Sherlock decided that while he missed having John talking to him, he certainly didn't lack the soothing effect of his companionship.
They settled on Angelo's and half an hour later John watched delightedly as Sherlock tucked into his food with gusto.
John licked his lips, realising belatedly that at no point in all this had they kissed. To an outsider, it may seem odd, like a missed step in a dance, but John thought it was just right. There was time for that later. When they were both ready, when they both trusted this thing between them enough to let all that potential unfold, he would kiss Sherlock for hours.
"Don't be," Sherlock murmured. "What's done is done. I underestimated your anger and your grief. I had thought you would be so pleased to see me that forgiveness was inevitable. It did not occur to me how very hurt you were. I suppose I didn't realise that in your own way, you had married me because you wanted to keep me, too. And I left anyway."
Mr Hendriksen shook his head. "Nah, he wasn't the type, really. He'd go out for a pint or two with his friends but never any other girls. Head over heels for Angeline, he was."
Lestrade doesn't ask any questions when she requests one of their media rooms and a techie to help her set up the system.
He pulled an electronic ID card out of his coat pocket and swiped it at the door lock, pleased with himself for remembering to borrow it from the victim's possessions at the lab. He would return it later with no one the wiser.
He entered the park and set off down the path, no doubt following the mental clamour of the Net to its source. Chances were that some of the Psy in the vicinity had already released pictures of what they had seen to the Net.
He sighed again. "There has got to be something, something I'm missing. If they wanted to talk in private, they could have done so at home or in Bingfield Park which is located right next to their home. So what where they doing in Regent's Park?"
Two hours later, after Sherlock had given John his kibbles while he himself took a shower and after John bullied him into eating something, they returned to the park.
"A scrap of paper with my phone number in case she gets lost, a bottle of juice, her lunch box, spare clothes, a box of crayons and a colouring book," John said immediately, looking relieved, if a bit confused. "Why-"
Certainly his friend had a new tendency to become very stiff-backed and short when John's wedding was mentioned or alluded to. He didn't seem to have taken the comment about best men as the compliment John had intended it to be and instead looked like someone pretending he didn't have a tooth ache.
If Sherlock was uncomfortable by John prowling towards him like the predator he was, he tried not to show it, sniffing dismissively instead. "So?"
"I figured you might like to celebrate," he said when John gave him a questioning look. "Freedom at last."
"I'm assuming you have some sort of plan that will let you access that list anyway?" John asked warily, wondering if this was one of those days on which they committed burglary and theft.
And then he had arrived and parked down the road, far enough away for the car to not be visible from the house, and had walked the rest of the way.
Mrs Hudson is beside herself when Sally tells her about the incident the next day. Sherlock, of course, didn't tell her anything, so all she knew about it was Mary - the fiancée - storming into the house, shouting for Sherlock, and the two of them rushing out.
He followed Sherlock's line of sight and noticed two dark figures rushing away into the night, unseen by the security guards, who were yelling and cursing and watching the Yule Goat burn. One of them had gotten his hands on a fire extinguisher and was attempting to use it on the goat. It was rather like trying to stop a forest fire with a bucket of water.
They entered the building and marched down several halls before entering the lift. John felt like he was going back in time. He only hoped he would come out of this in his actual body.
As such, things that were labelled 'incomprehensible' or even 'irrelevant' instantly attracted his attention.
before you decided to regress to a juvenile state of mind, I went over the numbers last night to see if there were inconsistencies. I ran them past several formulas and it does appear Mr James was correct - someone has been siphoning money out of the company. I only did a rough calculation and of course your fraud department will have to have a look at the numbers, but it seems over the past two years almost half a million has vanished without a trace."
This wasn’t going to take long and they both knew it. John wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s cock and they both groaned at the sensation of his fingers closing around hot, hard flesh.
"What? Oh!" John tears his eyes away from Dante. "Sorry. Yeah, I was wondering ... do you think Sherlock is acting a bit weird?"
John snorted. "Give me some credit, will you? After all this time, I'd be a bad friend indeed if I didn't notice when you get a spell of cabin fever."
Shuddering, John curled up a little bit tighter and listened to the sound of the rain smashing down outside. It sounded like standing right next to a waterfall but he knew from looking out the window that it really was nothing but strong rain hammering down onto the buildings and pavements - and, in many cases, the unlucky inhabitants - of the city.
"This is the one I found," he said and dropped it onto Lestrade's desk. The information inside was identical.
"Fair enough. Do we have other footage from the rest of the station?" John asked. "Perhaps we get a glimpse of his face on the way to the exit."
Well, that wasn't exactly helping, either. John glared at him, feeling even more off-kilter now. What on earth did he look like?
John laughed and patted his back. “Fair enough. Here, stay like this for a couple of minutes until you can move again. And don’t even think about falling asleep now. This is a mutual experiment, remember?”
John has no idea what to say. Sherlock is staring at him and he is staring back, pinned by those iridescent eyes and feeling rather like one of the microbes under Sherlock's microscope.
John didn't care about the statement, not really. What he did care about was that he had been rather looking forward to having Sherlock all to himself for two more days. He knew it was stupid and there was no reason for them to stay, except that he wanted to.
"The chairman of the charity was a high-ranking politician," Sherlock says absently but not without a small satisfied smirk. "Mycroft had a hellish time keeping it out of the papers."
"Experiment. I'm measuring the effects of cyanide on the time until moulding of different types of fruit."
And then John walks into the room and Sally watches Sherlock's entire face light up for a second and then instantly shut down as soon as Mary steps through the door after him. It takes her a moment to realise she is gripping her fork and knife rather too tightly.
Maybe something in his own face must have given away his confusion, because Sherlock crouched down in front of him, his eyes intent and piercing - and filled with a strange mix of fear and surprise and undeniable fascination.
While he carefully licked the spoon clean, John looked around the open kitchen, taking in the cottage. Sherlock tried to see it through his eyes but wasn't sure he succeeded. It was hard to tell which parts John noticed and which he didn't.
"He celebrates it, though. Or at least he did once," Molly says and tells her about that one disasterous Christmas when Sherlock apparently managed to insult John's girlfriend of the week and Molly herself before completely shutting down when they found a dead dominatrix.
"There you have it," John said. "He was starting to feel unwell around that time, then. Probably thought he had a cold coming on and decided to administer the infamous home recipe of chicken broth. It clearly didn't help."
John flung out one arm and managed to drag the drawer open, blindly rummaging around in it until his hands came into contact with a bottle and small packet. He dragged his eyes open to confirm he was holding the correct items. Sherlock approved, knowing there could be god-knew-what in that drawer, including a bottle of chilli sauce or similar that neither of them would want on their cocks. He should probably remove all dangerous items from it to avoid accidents in the future.
“That-that’s not exactly a massage,” he managed and John grinned against his skin. “Isn’t it? What about if I put some pressure right here?”
Their steps disappeared down the hall and John released a breath once they had gone. He met his own confused gaze in the mirror. What had that been about? He hadn't known Sherlock and Lestrade talked about things besides work, but this had been a downright friendly conversation about Sherlock's private life, which was not something John had ever seen him do. Hell, Sherlock barely spoke to
"We'll certainly try our best," Sherlock promised. "Don't worry, Mrs Hudson, I won't let any harm come to him."
Clinging to the armrest in an effort to keep himself from collapsing to the floor, he pressed his face into the cushion.
They spent the day lazing about the flat and playing hide and seek. Sherlock would take one of John's tennis balls and rub it in various spices he unearthed from a drawer in the kitchen and then hide it somewhere in the flat for John to find by scent alone. Other times, he stuffed the kong with treats and sent John in search of that, the treats being his prize for finding the kong.
"She does tend to exceed all expectations," Lucas Hunter said, looking at his mate with undisguised adoration. Sherlock wondered if this was how he looked at John. He hoped so.
Sherlock felt his lips pull into a sympathetic smile and quickly wiped the expression off his face. John would mistake it for pity and hate it. He carefully set his mug down and leaned across the table to look John straight in the eye.
"Tell him Sasha sends her love," she said. "There is no code I can give you in return. You will know him when you see him and you will only see him when he wishes you to."
"What makes you think this address is not on the list?" Mycroft asked calmly, examining the nails of his left hand. "I would not go so far as to call it a preferred address, but I do come here quite often."
For a moment, they lingered there, in the middle of the sitting room, knowing this was goodbye and there was no time to say anything else. John wanted to say something, anything, to make Sherlock stay, but nothing came to mind that wouldn't be interpreted as cruel.
Sherlock nodded. "Yes. This is the precise scenario Silence was created to prevent. Without it, this would be normal, not an exception."
"You know, I get the feeling you were waiting for us," John now said, smiling benignly. "Anything we can help you with?"
Sherlock turned his head to glance at him, looking surprised and a bit weary. "And this new perspective tells you to beat yourself up over your perceived shortcomings as a person?"
They don't notice her, not even when she takes a picture on her phone for Mrs Hudson. It was about time that woman had a more recent photograph of her two boys to put in a frame.
John allowed himself to be dragged up and followed him into the sitting room. “Yeah, you’re right. Let’s catch whoever did this. I’ve got some extra things I want to kill him for now.”
They curled up in Sherlock's bed in their usual positions and John listened to Sherlock drift off to sleep and wondered how long this normal schedule would continue to hold.
That last claim may have sounded more sincere if he hadn't been interrupted by a yawn. John huffed at him and nudged him towards the bed.
For one second that spanned the length of eternity, Sherlock remained completely and utterly motionless beneath John. The only change to their position on the kitchen floor was the added contact of their mouths pressed together, an action that was to blame squarely on John himself. And god, he had been wanting to do that forever because, well, who wouldn't?
His hands were shaking and his breath was coming in uneven gasps - admittedly this might be due to the kissing - and there were more tears where the first one had come from.
"Why would I?" Sherlock drawled from where he was spread out on the sofa. "I'm not the one eating any of it."
In hindsight, John wondered if that said more about the value Sherlock placed on his own life than about his trust in John.
John's arms tightened around him again and Sherlock exhaled shakily, ducking his head just a little further, trying to shuffle forward to somehow get their bodies closer together.
They parted ways with nods of acknowledgement. Lestrade returned to where his team was waiting for him and Sherlock and John went the other way, deciding by unspoken agreement to take the shortcut through the park and find a cab home on the other side.
There was indeed a cat sitting on top of the shelf, looking down at them with an expression that could only be described as 'severely judging'.
Sally nods to herself, opens her notepad to a fresh page and starts searching their database for the statements made by family, friends, colleagues and neighbours. Somewhere, they missed something. They must have.
In a way, it was easier right now. John being a dog had made it much easier to be around him. There was no desire to be felt for an animal, except for the wish to pet and run his fingers through warm fur and throw a tennis ball for him until it felt like his arm might fall off.
He thought he could feel John smile but it was hard to tell through the fabric of his t-shirt. “Don’t ever let me get married to a half-stranger again.”
John dragged Mrs Hudson through Regent's Park at a much slower pace than he and Sherlock usually took. The weather was nice and she seemed perfectly happy to be going for a walk with him. And this had the added bonus of leaving 221 Baker Street completely empty except for Sherlock.
The one man who had become integral to Sherlock's life, who had reminded him of what it was like to feel, who tempted him to break Silence and never look back, was also the very reason he could never seriously breach the Protocol. To do so would all but ensure John's death. It was not a price Sherlock was willing to pay. What use were feelings when the only person he would ever consider directing them at was gone?
“Don’t worry about it. We’re going shopping - perhaps I can talk Sherlock into getting an electric fan that he won’t take apart in a moment of boredom,” John reassured her, privately already determined to stop by that fantastic bakery in the shopping centre to get Mrs Hudson a treat. That woman worked far too hard for her age and deserved a bit of pampering.
It occurred to John that, despite all the upheaval to their lives, Sherlock appeared happier and more relaxed than he had in months. It was hardly surprising, really. If all had gone according to plan, John would be on his honeymoon now and Sherlock would be... well, doing whatever he did when he was alone at home, presumably.
"And have you talked to your previous employer about this?" Sherlock inquired. Embezzlement could lead down very interesting roads or very boring ones and he was hoping for an interesting case here.
She got up and left the lab without giving him a chance to reply. For once, Sherlock was glad for it - he had no idea what his response would have been.
And then what? What if John took the proverbial bait, loathe as Sherlock was to call it such even in his mind? What if John decided he wanted him after all?
John nodded again. “Really. I want to get out of here for a bit and it’s bound to be at least a bit cooler there than it is here.”
She stopped humming and turned her head to smile at him over her shoulder. “Oh, John! There you are. Come look.”
"Oh, you're a darling, Sherlock. Thank you for a wonderful evening. I do hope we'll repeat this one day, perhaps when John is back to his usual form," she said, making Sherlock bend forward by tugging at his arm so she might kiss his cheek. "Good night, dear boy."
Since he couldn’t, all he did do was hold on tight until John managed to calm down enough to stop making those heart-wrenching noises and his body stopped shaking quite so badly.
"You were in a war zone, John. I believe war zones are places where a high body count is expected. I am certain when they sent you there they took your changeling nature into account. And you still haven't told me what it is."
Sherlock shook himself out of his thoughts and said: "If ... if you're absolutely certain about this, that this is what you want ... then yes. I will come home. I will adopt her. And I will always keep her safe."
"Not while I'm on the case," Sherlock said and gave the woman a cursory glance. "Have you been with the company long, Mrs -?"
"John?" Sherlock didn't quite know what he was asking. Clearly walking out the door right now was a bad idea. While John's grip was extremely gentle, there was no denying the knowledge that the raw jaw strength of a dog was more than sufficient to snap a wrist without much effort at all. Not that he really thought that John would do such a thing, but that didn't mean he would ever underestimate John's stubborn nature.
