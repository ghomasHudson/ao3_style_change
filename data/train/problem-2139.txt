"Well I could try to send Alexander a fire message, which is how demon's communicate but I don't know if it will work. I've never tried it before." I said.
"I'll be fine once I kill Moriarty. Let me see it." I say. Eric carefully hands me the note. The note reads ' one friend is dead, the other doesn't desire you, to fix drink liquid sunshine.' It was written in blood.
"My team has code words we use in case of trouble. One of them is to say a person desires us but it really means they are the enemy. By him say Abby desires us he's saying she is betraying us." I explain.
I was driven to the crime scene where I was escorted to the body by to agents. The agents were talking to the detective while I was looking at the body. It was like the other four bodies. All young with dark hair, all stabbed to death with black magic symbols drawn in blood on their foreheads. But this one had runes drawn around it too. I was about to move closer to look at the runes when I heard arguing. “What do you mean I’m off the case?” a cold angry voice asked. “Some special agents are taking over now.” A calmer voice replies. I turn around to see the detective talking with a tall man with dark curly hair but what surprised me was the man from the cafe was with him. He was looking at me. When our eyes locked I saw his eyes flash. I blinked in shock. He remembers me. Interesting. He opened his mouth like he wanted to say something but decided not to. His friend noticed him staring and turned to look at me. “This is who they have working the case she looks like a teenager.” He says to the detective. I sigh I’m actually eighteen. I walked over to them and threw on a fake smile that has been known to dazzle. “Hello I’m special agent Mikaela Malum.” I said. The golden man stepped up and introduced himself as John Watson. I nod to him. “Latin for evil, yes?” The dark haired man asked. I smirked a bit. “Yes.” I reply. The man cocked his head slightly. “Sherlock Holmes.” He said quickly. I nod before turning back to the body. The runes were simple all they did was capture the death energy so the user could use it for powerful spells. The killer was probably a witch that uses black magic. I waved over one of the agents and told him to get  a mage to do a tracking spell that the killer wasn’t a demon. I was leaving when I heard someone yelling for me to wait. I turned around to see John walking up to me. “Sorry to bother you its just you seem so familiar.” He says. I smile. “I get that a lot don’t worry.”I said while touching his arm. The moment I touched him a bolt of pain ran up my arm. He must have angel blood in him. I clenched my jaw so I wouldn’t flinch. He smiled and nodded. I removed my hand but my arm still throbbed with pain. I wonder if he knew about the angel blood. The man named Sherlock walked over to us. “John lets go we have been kicked out.” He said with a glare towards me. “Sherlock.” John said with warning in his voice. Sherlock waved him away. “Please explain why the government is taking over a case like this?” he asked with a angry glare. I smiled coldly. “I’m sorry I can’t say.” I said before turning and walking away.
"You fucking asshole! Give them back or I swear I will hunt you down and rip your spine out." I snarl letting my voice get low and dark as I try to keep myself from slipping into my demon form.
“Gregory Lestrade came to me during our training sessions, and took me under his wing. He introduced me to Sally Donovan and Philip Lestrade –”
John and Harry looked to Sherlock, and Sherlock turned back to them. John didn’t want to make the decision for him – it was Sherlock’s choice whether he wanted to argue that whatever Dean had to say could be said in front of John and Harry, or he wanted to agree and go off with Dean alone, leaving them behind. John trusted Dean to take Sherlock off alone and bring him back unscathed, but in the end it was Sherlock’s call to make. John subtly nodded to Sherlock, trying to communicate all this, and it seemed like Sherlock got the message, for he nodded back, just as subtly, and then he turned back to Dean.
that District 12 wasn’t the same since he left it just a few weeks ago. For one thing, John’s parents weren’t going to be at the station to greet them when they arrived. For another, Mycroft Holmes was not in the train with the surviving victors. Not to mention the fact that the entirety of the Mockingjay Rebellion occurred while he was gone.
“Don’t tease him,” John said from his place between them – where he always felt he was stuck, these days.
As paparazzi flooded the City Circle, trying to get a statement from all of the previous victors that still had a sibling in the Arena, the Capitol announced the final six:
“I did – Sherlock figured it out,” John said, as he noticed that Louise and Alexander had gone off to talk. “Where’s Bainbridge?”
As they ascended, the three of them couldn’t help but ask about their other friends – and the other people involved in the battle between the Peacekeepers and the mentors, their questions and answers quickly being shot back and forth.
“But if he pulls what you pulled today and asks another question without asking me permission, I can’t help you.”
“It probably is,” Sherlock replied. He knew what Harry was doing – she was trying to lighten the situation to make whatever happened next easier, but Sherlock wasn’t in the mood to joke along with her.
The movement was so quick that John didn’t catch it until he felt what Charles Augustus had done to him: he was cupping John’s genitals through his pants, pressing his palm into the most sensitive part of it.
, we lost our cat Grace to an ear tumor that was SUPPOSED TO grow out of her ear and then we’d bring her in for surgery, BUT INSTEAD it grew the opposite direction until it was pressing into her brain. She was my sibling’s cat more than anybody’s, but she loved me dearly too and she’d been hanging out with my mom more and more right before she passed, and she was like best friends with our 16 year old cat (Peanut) and Grace’s biological brother (Patch) is still with us, so it’s a pretty big loss. But Patch and Peanut sleep next to each other all the time now, and Patch kept crying to mom and trying to find Grace for weeks after she passed which was really heartbreaking to see. Thankfully the vet we brought her to was really nice and helped her pass comfortably and surrounded by her family, and we were able to bury her on my grandpa's property, in the little pet cemetery they have (don't think we have a lot of dead cats, it's more like my mom's family moved to that house when my mom was 19 (she's in her 50s now) so it's not like they're gonna be leaving that property anytime soon.
He was suddenly cut off by every spider as far as Sherlock and Harry could see falling onto the ground, unmoving, with their legs curled beneath them.
“Fine,” Sherlock said quickly – too quickly, but that was alright. John knew that he was alright; he was just nervous, though he’d never admit it. “You – how about you – are you okay?”
Mycroft had asked, and John remembered being so caught off guard by Mycroft’s sudden authoritative tone – something that he had heard Mycroft use in the past but never directed at him, until now. And, for the first time ever, John realized that, since he was in a romantic relationship with Sherlock Holmes, while he wouldn’t have to deal with any overprotective fathers like he had in his previous relationships, he
“If we do that, it’s easier for us to be seen by anyone who happens to be on shore,” Sherlock replied. “And, seeing that Aurora Blake has died, Magnussen might be making his way there to try and find us – he’ll be able to see practically all of the shore from there, so if we go to shore and he’s there he’ll see us, and he’ll go our way immediately. Right now he has no idea where we are –”
Sherlock looked up from the writhing body of Seneca Crane and saw John Watson, lowering a Peacekeeper’s gun.
“It’s been six months, my friend,” Mycroft reminded him, as they finally stopped embracing. Dean kept his hand on Mycroft’s shoulder. Sherlock noticed something he had never seen before. Mycroft always put himself above anyone and everyone who dared think they were more important than him. It didn’t matter who it was; Sherlock had never seen him interact with President Snow, but he was sure that Mycroft would make the effort to make Snow aware that
“Do you honestly think I wouldn’t think to brush myself off before going out on stage in front of all of Panem?” Mycroft asked, but before Sherlock had time to reply, Caesar’s voice boomed through the entire theater.
They both mumbled words of thanks, though they both knew that at least one of their siblings’ luck had finally run out.
And for a moment, John was back in the Arena, on his stomach, while Jim Moriarty grabbed his ass, pulling John’s knife out of his back pocket, ready to plunge it into his shoulder –
“Nice job, Aurora.” Charles Augustus Magnussen said, and strode proudly over the corpse, undid his fly, took himself out, and took a piss on James’ body.
The final interview with Caesar was going well, as far as Sherlock could tell. To be honest, though, he wasn’t really paying attention to the interview at all. Yes, he was giving all the right reactions in all the right places – laughing when Caesar told a joke, getting to the verge of tears when he was asked about his relationship with Louise after Archie’s death and about John’s assault – but all he could really focus on was John.
Honestly, John was still in shock that it wasn’t Snow up there referring to himself as President. With every second, it hit John harder and harder that the night before had actually happened, and it wasn’t all completely in vain – they had won Panem’s freedom.
“Actually, he’s been upgraded to one of our padded rooms,” the guard replied, and Sherlock couldn’t tell whether or not the guard found justice in the development. “He’s been placed under watch for about two months, now.”
Harry looked at Sherlock as if she hadn’t thought of that herself, and she was just about to speak, but then a new thought entered her head. She looked him over, puzzled.
The memorial service is held for the people who died in the Battle of Panem; Sherlock, John, and Harry receive an unexpected surprise.
As Thomas Birch’s name was announced and added to the death toll, the recap showed Harry Watson grabbing a bow and arrows and shooting one of them at his lime green swim suit as he tried to drown Sherlock. His sister killed someone in the bloodbath – to save Sherlock.
“Mycroft had gone to check the roof, and I had gone to check the Avox’s staircase, seeing as Sherlock was afraid to use the elevator –”
“W-wait – what are you doing?” John stuttered, and one of the edges of Sherlock’s mouth curled just a degree upwards as he answered.
He glanced nervously through the audience below, wanting desperately to look at John, just for a moment, but instead his eyes landed on Hannibal Lecter Magnussen’s, and it was there he made a silent plea:
“She was the first person I ever came out to. Because I thought something was wrong with me. I was seven – it was shortly before I met you, actually – and after my annual check-up she asked if I had any questions for her, and...it just came out. I started crying and everything, because I liked girls when I was supposed to like boys – I thought I was sick.”
“Beth Davenport and Andrew West,” John muttered. He would never forget the names – he fell asleep to his mind counting each one off every night:
But instead, he pursed his lips and looked up at Dean Bainbridge, terrified of what was to come, but somehow ready at the same time.
A sob escaped him, and Sherlock put his hands over his eyes, trying to hold himself together. He was almost done – he had to finish the speech.
And then the rest of his body began to feel what had been done to it. John felt a pain on his chest and inside of his chest, and he felt a terrible feeling under his belt, but it was nothing compared to the Arena – knowing he was going to die –
“And we all knew how to work a casting net by the time we were seven,” Alexander added, and the others nodded in agreement. “Jesus – Dean – remember that one time –” Alexander started, but then the screen changed – Caesar Flickerman and Claudius Templesmith were on the screen, announcing Sherlock and Harry’s release from the hospital.
“They didn’t know you and Mycroft were to be interviewed – they’re working on your suits – What’s this?”
, to the brother of the person who sexually assaulted him. He had stood up for Sherlock and for Harry plenty of times, but never to anyone so dangerous. He looked up at Mycroft, and he gave John a partial smile and a nod, and that was all the approval John needed.
Harry opened the box, revealing a silver, ovular locket, the size of her thumb, engraved with the letter H.
“I imagine that going down to the end of this hallway will just lead us back to Snow’s mansion, so this here should lead us to Caesar’s studio,” Mycroft said, and pressed the button to open the door. John didn’t speak until they were inside the room.
Stepping into President Snow’s mansion was like stepping into a pure white room. Everything in the front hall was a blinding white color, and John fought the urge to place his hand before his eyes to stop from squinting. For a moment, he wondered why he hadn’t noticed it before – he had been in this very hall twice in his life and distinctly remembered it being a warm yellow color instead of looking like someone had doused everything in snow.
Not much in the Arena itself, but we do get to see how he prepared for the Arena without a mentor to guide him. I can’t figure out if there’s more or less of him in Constantly – I think it’s about the same between the two stories – but I do feel there’s a lot more of Mycroft revealed and we see him as more of his own person and less as just “Sherlock Holmes’ big brother” or “John Watson’s mentor” like how he was in Sentiment. Once Constantly is completely done and out there in the world, there are certainly ways for me to revisit the universe, and going into Mycroft’s Arena with him is certainly on my list of ways to do so, so I may go there in the future. Honestly, I really hope I do.
As soon as their hands touched, Sherlock’s puffy red eyes flicked over to John’s person, and then away, again, even as he held onto John’s hand for dear life. He thought of how quickly Sherlock had jumped to John’s defense when Antonia simply grabbed his arm to keep him with the group, and knew exactly what he was afraid of.
“John Watson’s prosthetic leg. Where is it?” he snapped, but the Peacekeeper continued to glare at him.
“There’s a first time for everything, little brother,” Mycroft replied, smiling his trademark equally-annoyed-and-amused grin.
was carved at the top of the wall, above the sections of names. The first section was dedicated to those who had died in the various Hunger Games Arenas – one thousand seven hundred and twenty-four names in all. The next was for those who had died in the Battle For Panem – another nine hundred and sixty-seven names. And then, finally, the third column was for the people who had won the Hunger Games; dead or alive, no matter who they were – another seventy-six names.
Harry was never a beggar, not even in the Arena, not even when Charles Augustus Magnussen had her by her hair or was flicking her cheek. The one and only time he knew her to beg was when she thought – when everyone thought – that Sherlock was dead.
“They must’ve got the idea from the reaping,” John whispered back. He did another quick headcount – he got eighteen again. Someone was missing –
“Me? No; I refused to let Magnussen ruin anything we were doing,” John said quietly. “The only thing I wanted was to for him not to ruin us.”
wants five minutes’ conversation with you before he makes this statement,” Dean replied. “And he wants this five minutes’ conversation unsupervised.”
After passing through about three different metal detectors, being buzzed into five different rooms, making three vague threats to expose anyone who stupidly decided to notify anyone that he was here, and seven autographs, Sherlock found himself walking alongside a guard as he spoke to him:
The four arrive in the Capitol; John and Mycroft attend a mentor meeting; Sherlock is prepped for the Games; Mycroft holds a mentor meeting of his own.
There had been times where Sherlock had been rejected before – not even rejected, it was just that John had declined Sherlock’s offers of affection – but there wasn’t a time that had hurt this badly.
Sherlock did not read the article – he had straight-up refused to when Dean and Alexander offered – and he felt like John and Harry were thankful for that.
“They don’t stop, not really,” Mycroft informed him solemnly. “You can pretend that they stopped, but none of it ever really goes away.”
If you'd like to keep tabs on me while I write Mycroft's Games and the Sad Times AU and stuff, I'm on Instagram (sarastarrchild) but mostly on TikTok, which is dumb af and I know that but hey.
“VICTORY TOUR!” she sang, and Sherlock had already decided that he had had enough peppiness for one day.
John’s blood ran cold. Of course, subconsciously, he knew that Snow had not made the final decision – Claudius Templesmith had to have, unsure of what to do, but unable to waste any time by consulting with Seneca Crane or President Snow before Sherlock and Harry killed each other and giving them no victor at all – but it hadn’t actually crossed his mind until now.
“John...this is very important, and I need you to respond. You don’t need to go into detail; a simple yes or no will do.” He opened his eyes, and spoke so clearly it made John’s ears burn. “Did Charles Augustus Magnussen touch you inappropriately?” Mycroft asked, and John nodded.
, the plushest of chairs and sofas, grand fireplaces, a flower garden (laden with purple irises) and small pond full of exotic fish
Only one person was able to drag John out of the bubble – the bubble of immense relief that had surrounded him, because he felt the same amount of relief. That person was Mycroft Holmes, and that was only after placing his hand on John’s shoulder and calling his name for a second time.
“If all goes according to plan and the other Peacekeepers believe that I’m this one here, they won’t even think to come down here and check at least until after the interview,” Mycroft said, putting the Peacekeeper’s uniform on over his suit.
Sherlock Holmes stood, alone in the training center’s cafeteria, waiting for his name to be called. He knew he should have been thinking about the fact that he was to be judged by the Gamemakers in a few moments, but all he could really think about was John.
Antonia shrugged, waving him off. “Don’t worry about it – he’ll probably do it tomorrow while you’re up on stage with them, where you should’ve been tonight.”
As soon as Sherlock’s pen lifted from the paper, he felt something shift inside of him – a tense muscle loosening, a weight lifting, both of which Sherlock had become so used to bearing that he had forgotten they existed in the first place. Hannibal was going to die, and he would never be able to pester Sherlock or John or even Hamish or Rosamund – he would never be able to ruin their lives, now.
“Hey,” he mumbled, looking around at the space around him from his place at the kitchen table – a space that he knew so well but, at the same time, didn’t really know, at all.
“Mischa, my little sister, died the night before her first reaping ceremony. More specifically, I killed her.” He looked to the paparazzi, addressing them specifically for the first time. “Please, write this down: I, Hannibal Lecter Magnussen, killed Mischa Simonetta Magnussen, and I ate her remains,” Hannibal said, and then returned his attention to the rest of the room. “I imagine that that a lot of you are looking for more specifics as to how I did that and why it happened, and I won’t be the one to deny you of your morbid curiosity.
He should’ve been happy – Harry’s victory was just solidified – for the first time he didn’t have to worry about her not making it home – he should’ve been
The desire to go find them swelled up in Sherlock’s chest – given how easy it was to sneak into Harry’s room, it would be easy enough to find their way to an elevator and take it up to the penthouse. It didn’t matter to Sherlock that he was in a hospital gown, and that his ass was exposed for anyone who cared to glance in that area to see – the need to see Mycroft and John were too great –
So John waited the best he could – the seconds leading to minutes leading to hours – asking questions and placing votes when needed, just how it looked like Sherlock was spending his wait.
At the sight of John, some of the memories of the night before resurfaced in Sherlock’s head – mostly the ones involving their reunion and the clothes that were shed during said reunion – and suddenly, the sunlight in Sherlock’s eyes didn’t bother him so much.
“I just –” she started, took a breath, and started again. “How did you know? I mean, I know your brother had said you both had an impeccable ability for deduction, but –”
“The specifics of the rumors of her disappearance are all different, as the specifics of most stories are after they’ve been repeated various times through word of mouth, but they all shared the same similarity, and that consistency was where the finger was pointed. No matter who told the story, I was the person blamed for my sister’s disappearance. I asked for this audience so that I may, finally, address those rumors.”
Mycroft nodded to himself, straightened up, turned around, and, in one sweeping motion, shoved everything off his desk. John jumped back with such force that it moved his chair, watching wide eyed as Mycroft leaned over the now-empty desk, gripping the edges with white knuckles, breathing heavily.
“I can ask him that one if you want to ask him the other one,” Sherlock offered. “That way both of them will be answered.”
At the sound of his name, Sherlock spun around to see who had called out to him, to find the woman from last night, Alma Coin, still dressed in a grey jumpsuit, her straight, grey hair still falling beyond her shoulders. This time, though, she was being flanked by two helmetless Peacekeepers – Sherlock had told Dean not to trust Coin, and Mycroft had too, based on the lack of surprise in Dean’s response; so the Peacekeepers must’ve been trustworthy enough to keep an eye on Coin.
“…I might,” John replied. “I don’t know if this has anything to do with it, but former-President Snow called me and Mycroft in for a meeting that morning. He told us that having two Hunger Games victors in one year was going to cause a rebellion, and then sent Mycroft away and requested that I stayed, where he gave me an ultimatum: I had to choose the winner of the Hunger Games – whether that be Harry or Sherlock, and he insinuated that if I refused to choose, or if I chose Sherlock over Harry, he would kill me instead. At least, that’s what I thought; I found out later that he actually meant my parents. I tried to leave Snow’s mansion to speak to Mycroft, to tell him about his threat, but one of Snow’s Peacekeepers injected me with something to knock me out, and then his Peacekeepers brought me down to the basement under the training center – where the Capitol’s prisoners become Avoxes – and they put me in a special room locked behind a set of keys
“We should get going – there’s a Victory Banquet for us to attend,” Mycroft said, changing the subject as he went around Sherlock and stood at Louise’s side, and Sherlock, Harry, and Louise all scoffed.
Now that he was thinking about it, Sherlock wondered if the reason why he hadn’t stopped talking was because he was afraid – secretly afraid – that if he stopped, if he took a vow of silence until he could better cope with what had happened to him in the Games, he would never speak again. But he didn’t say any of this to his brother. Instead, he changed the topic.
Nine years. Three thousand, two hundred, eighty-seven days. So much has happened over those nine years in the world and for me personally, and this fic has been through it all with me, like a friend I always needed. I graduated college writing this; I started three different jobs writing this; I’ve moved and said goodbye to pets and said hello to new ones writing this; I’ve made friends and lost friends while writing this; I even went through my first emergency room visit while writing this (and even went to the emergency room
Sherlock took a deep breath, taking the papers and glancing them over, able to quickly read over every word without actually trying. The only reason why Hannibal asked him to sign the forms was because John would fight tooth and nail to refuse – enough to sway Dean and Sherlock’s votes if given the opportunity. The only reason why Hannibal asked him was because he thought Sherlock would sign the papers. There was a part of Sherlock that wanted him to die slowly, losing all of the things that he prided himself on, and he so badly wanted to spite Hannibal – remind him that he didn’t know Sherlock, at all – but there was one thing that stopped Sherlock from handing the papers back to the guard and walking away completely.
“Just a forewarning, John,” Mycroft said quietly as they were about to reach the table that held the book that Sherlock and Harry had to give their blood samples to. “Mrs. Hudson won’t be pleased; I’ve never been late to a reaping before.”
“I’m not –” Sherlock cried into John’s shoulder. “I’m not, I’m not strong enough –” he started, only getting that far before he had to push John away so he could throw his head back into the toilet to retch.
“Hello, everyone, and welcome to another Hunger Games! First off,” Seneca said, and pointed up to John. “Let’s welcome our newest mentor: John Watson.”
“You remember that girl from District Nine?” she asked, cutting him off. “The one Mycroft showed us, back when we didn’t know who was going in – not Louise Neal but the other one – Amanda Hawkins? Remember how her hair snarled in the branches and she almost got killed because of that? I don’t want to be that girl – if I’m going to lose, it’s not going to be because of my hair. Do you have anything to cut this with?” she asked, taking a lock of her hair between her two fingers and scrutinizing it.
“Excuse me, but would it be possible if we could see our mentor, John Watson?” he asked as politely as he could muster. The man crossed his arms and sighed.
As soon as she dotted the question mark Harry stood up and walked to the podium with a strut in her step that assured John that she knew exactly what she was going to stay when she got up there, and that she didn’t give a damn about the fact that she was going to speak with a literal cannibal.
Mycroft did most of the talking, conveying his belief in Sherlock, his thankfulness in Harry’s alliance with him, and his faith in the both of them. All John had to do really was smile and agree. It was times like this he was incredibly thankful for Mycroft – he was smarter than these people, so much smarter than anyone, even President Snow himself, but learned how to deal with these people and did so with such grace, all the while keeping up the façade that this was easy for him. Because John knew it wasn’t easy, dealing with these people. Sherlock tried explaining it to him once, but ended up calling John – and everyone like John, everyone “normal” – as stupid as goldfish. It was shortly after Mycroft returned home from his Arena, and John had gotten so mad he didn’t speak to Sherlock for three days, until Sherlock had cornered John after school one day and apologized profusely, crying with sincerity.
“No, it’s not,” John agreed, “but they don’t care.” He looked to the screen again, watching the party continue. “I didn’t know that it was possible to party for twenty-four hours straight.”
It’s been absolute insanity that I’ve stuck to this for this long (I’ve NEVER stuck to a writing project for this long), and it’s even more insane that it’s ended, but I wanted to say something as I close this fic forever:
But, even though it was still the same room, almost completely untouched since the last time John had been there the other day, it was so completely different, because everything else had changed.
“You’re coming on the tour with us! Everyone wants to see the Hunger Games’ favorite couple, after all!” she announced, and Sherlock looked at John.
“By the way, before she comes up here, Clover wanted me to tell you all that, due to her current circumstance, she will be vocally answering her questions. Since she hasn’t felt the need to speak out loud in the last six years, she asks for your patience and understanding, because she…” Louise then took out an index card from her pocket and read from that, ensuring she got her exact words. “…definitely won’t get every single goddamned sound in the English language exactly right, but she’ll get it close enough, and that’s what counts. She also wants to add that if anyone has any problem with how she speaks, she would like to see you unexpectedly go deaf moments before the most dangerous and most hearing-dependent five days of your life, come out alive from that, create an entire language in order to communicate, and then get your ability to use that language ripped away from you after six years, leaving you to rely on the voice that you know you still have but have no way of hearing.”
Harry quickly waved goodbye to Louise without drawing attention to herself, while Sherlock and Mycroft both nodded her way. And then, without another moment’s hesitation, she was gone, and Sherlock wished he could follow after her – and it looked like Mycroft was wishing the same.
After nearly two hours of sitting on his own, almost exactly forty-eight hours after Mycroft Holmes died, the doors of the auditorium opened, and all of the funeral attendees walked out of the room. As Sherlock stood up, some looked to Sherlock, some nodded to him, acknowledging his presence and offering their sympathy, but Sherlock barely glanced at them; he was looking for someone in particular.
to look for you – we would’ve searched for years while you decomposed in the woods – did you honestly not think of that? What it would do to us – to John? He
, and that’s all that mattered. Then there were moments like these – where even though they were physically touching they were thousands of miles apart.
Still grinning, she looked behind Harry to look at Sherlock, and John watched the smile falter as she saw his face for the first time. Her eyes then searched behind them, too, as her brow furrowed in confusion.
Sherlock’s days of watching people die were over. Now that he knew his family was safe – and would forever be safe – he could really, truly live, even if he had been doing just that for years, now.
There was another moment, and then someone in the audience started clapping, and then that one person became a few people, and then those few people became the entire audience.
At this, John chuckled again, louder and harder than last time – almost a full-on laugh, but not quite.
The final group in the Arena was the District 4 alliance crossing over into sector twenty-two: Steven Bainbridge and Julia Waters – Dean and Alexander’s siblings.
“I know,” Sherlock said quietly, nodding. “With everything else going on I figured I’d let you come to me with it as opposed to pestering you about it.”
“Yes, it’s really me, and I’ll be willing to autograph whatever you want me to sign, but could you please refrain from making a fool of yourself and just take me to this address, first?” he asked, passing the driver a torn piece of an envelope.
“I think that’d be good,” John replied quietly. “We can talk to Dean and make sure he tells us when he’s cleared the doctors who would be able to do that, and then we can come back here and fix this.”
“There is a reason as to why I am here today, giving this speech, telling you all this story – telling you all the truth that I’ve kept hidden for decades,” Hannibal went on. “I was not part of Mycroft Holmes’ plans of rebellion – the Mockingjay Alliance, as it has been called – and I can understand his reasons why. I can also understand the Panem that he, and now President Bainbridge, wants to build and create. And I also know that I have no place in it.” He turned to Dean. “President Dean Bainbridge, I would like for you to arrest me for the murder of Mischa Simonetta Magnussen. Right here, in this room, today.”
As soon as the doors were closed Sherlock took John into his arms, and held him for what seemed like an eternity. There were no words spoken – John knew that Sherlock knew there was nothing he could possibly say to make him feel any better. As soon as Sherlock let go he was enveloped in Mycroft’s arms, and he was whispering into John’s ear.
write about the Mockingjay Rebellion – dates, names and deductions of everyone he recruited, ideas upon ideas for plans of how to win – was contained within the single notebook in Mycroft’s strongbox. Sherlock read that notebook cover to cover within a few hours – Mycroft’s letter, however, remained untouched.
“Don’t thank me, I just sprained your arm. You may want to see a doctor for that, if the swelling doesn’t go down in a couple hours,” he noted, putting is hand on the knob.
“John?” she asked, giving him John’s name sign in the process: she signed the letter “J”, and then brought her hand to her chest, tapping her heart with her pinky finger twice – J for John, and then his heart. “Yes,” she replied.
“I thought you were going to catch yesterday’s train home, Nana,” Mycroft said, glancing back and forth between her and Alexander.
“I…I, um…” Sherlock stuttered for a second, briefly considering which death of their friendship would be less embarrassing: giving the real reason as to why not, or just complying until his body showed John exactly what he was thinking. “…I just don’t want to!” he called, mentally kicking himself for not thinking of a legitimate reason. “You can stay in the water, though! I’ll stay here and –” Sherlock cut himself off before he made the mistake of saying ‘watch you,’ “– I’ll watch your clothes! Make sure nothing runs off with them.”
Only a few people stopped them on their way through the crowd. A few of Harry’s acquaintances from school approached her, and a few adults who knew Mr. and Mrs. Watson approached both of the Watson children to offer their sympathy, but the first people John truly recognized were Mary Morstan’s parents. They each hugged John, Harry, and Sherlock in turn, whispering their condolences in each of their ears, and for some reason, their words felt so much more to John than anyone else’s, just because they knew what they were going through more than just about anyone in District 12. The Capitol took away their daughter just like they took away John and Harry’s parents and Sherlock’s brother. Mr. and Mrs. Morstan knew that pain just as well as they did.
“Okay...okay...” she whispered, wiping the blood rain off of his arm with an antiseptic wipe from Sherlock’s medkit, revealing the remnants of the last time Sherlock used a syringe on himself.
And, all things considered he was, more or less, okay. The three of them – John, Sherlock, and Harry – were, at the very least, learning how to be okay. They all had their bad days – quiet days, where Harry would lock herself in her room, Sherlock would stare at one spot on the floor (or, when wintertime started, out the window at the snow) for hours on end, lost in a trance, and John would avoid moving about the house so he wouldn’t have to use his cane. There were times where they all jumped at the slightest noise or touch, there were foggy mornings where they all refused to leave the house, there were days where they cried for seemingly no reason at all, and there were always nights where they woke up shaking or screaming or sweating from nightmares, but they had found their routines, and they were living through them.
Sherlock, John, Harry, Mycroft, and Alexander all get separated and fight to return to one another amongst the chaos.
“Thank you, congratulations to you, as well,” Mycroft replied, merely glancing at the screen as he spoke to check in on Harry – just in time to see her try to take an arrow to one of the crows, but it dodged out of the way.
He stood before them, crossing his arms, and he eyed them all, collecting information, and then spoke:
“Your brain is still trying to reach your body – I know that look; I’ve worn it plenty of times, myself. John, I want you to tell me what you’re thinking, whatever it is, even if it doesn’t make sense in your own head right now, and know that whatever you say will not leave this room –”
“We just need to –” one of the doctors tried to calm him down, but Sherlock couldn’t tell which one – they all had surgical masks covering their mouths. His eyes searched the crowd – there were about six of them in all.
“Next time we start a fucking rebellion someone has to notify my freaking stylist!” Harry exclaimed in lieu of a reply, and threw her pump at the approaching Peacekeepers. They were only able to spot the foremost Peacekeeper getting clocked in the head before they were on the run again, Harry with her second shoe in hand.
“About what?” Sherlock asked, dragging his mind to start deducing, trying to figure him out – what he wanted – what he had to say –
When a moment passed without anyone saying anything about her sister, Antonia nodded to herself, and then approached Sherlock.
For a second, John thought that he had been the one who had been shot, and the stress of the situation had simply delayed the inevitable pain of his death. But then, his eyes somehow found Mycroft Holmes. He was still standing, the handle of his umbrella in one hand, pointed up at President Snow’s balcony, smoke emerging from its end. The rest of his umbrella was in his other hand – his umbrella was in two separate parts – and it hit John then: his umbrella was a gun, and it had been all along – the handle a pistol, and the rest was just its disguise. John looked from Mycroft to President Snow’s balcony, to see a group of Peacekeepers surrounding the president, blood oozing from a hole directly in the center of his forehead.
“Would it be bad if I said I didn’t want to win?” she asked, and John could see her eyes filling with tears.
Sherlock gave Harry one last hug, and then passed through the door that Mycroft held open for him, saying their goodbyes and assuring her that they’d see each other again within the next half hour, and then it was just Sherlock and Mycroft.
apologize for living through the Games; that’s not what the Capitol wants to see. Do you understand me?”
“My office. Immediately,” he almost snarled, and John led the way to his office, Mycroft walking behind Harry in line to make sure no one ran off.
She shrugged the coat back on, and placed her hand on Sherlock’s cheek. “He’d hate to see you like this. Take care of yourself, Sherlock. Please,” she whispered, her kind smile turning into a sad one – not pitying, but almost. “Don’t make us have to dig another grave for a Holmes, okay?”
Sherlock looked away from Archie to find Harry at the archery station, and just in time to see Charles Augustus Magnussen striding up behind her. Within seconds, he was just behind her, speaking:
He wanted to tell them to stop, that he was still awake, that he needed more of the anesthetic, but he couldn’t find his mouth to produce the words, or his eyes to open them. And so, he stayed awake and aware as the doctors attached a heart monitor to his chest, put a breathing tube down his throat, hooked one arm up to an IV, cut the other arm open to remove his tracking device, and help fix his now-infected wounds.
“They’d blow them up with the bombs under the pedestals,” Amanda replied before Mycroft could, but Mycroft was watching Clover signing something, and he translated for John:
Sherlock turned from his brother’s immortalized face to the sound of the voice – the voice he hated himself for recognizing after all these years.
They stuck to small obstacles – nothing to do with weaponry, and Sherlock made sure he could always see Harry – who had swung by to say hi and to ask if he was alright with her going off and legitimately training.
Harry. They would banter when in the same room, but they never truly conversed until John was reaped for the Games. Then suddenly Harry was on his doorstep, and simple banter wasn’t going to cut it. She wanted serious conversation – she needed serious conversation, and all the empathy Sherlock could provide. As sick as it was, they bonded over that – over John’s potential future televised death and how much they didn’t want it to happen.
of something bad happening if John didn’t do what the Capitol told him to would scare him into submission. “I don’t want to find out.”
Dean read the list of names in order of the Districts they hailed from, and when he reached the names of the victors of District Four – the six friends he had, all of whom had left him behind – he choked up, just for a moment, as he read their names, solidifying their loss.
He heard a sound erupting from his chest, a low growl straining to explode from him, but he had no idea that he could even make such a noise – and suddenly he was falling – down, down to the ground. Even when he hit the cement floor he still felt like he was falling – falling through the floor, falling into a deep dark abyss, falling...
anyone else -" And that's when he can't speak anymore, and Mycroft reminds him that he didn't kill him, and John spits back: "You didn't, either."
Sherlock smirked back at her, and then, in a moment of sentimental defeat, he held his apple out to her, as if to propose a toast.
John did not hate Sherlock Holmes. He wished he could. He wished he could just detach himself from him and just focus on his sister. He wished he could tear Sherlock from his place in John’s veins. He wished he had never fallen in love with him. He wished he hadn’t met him. He wished he didn’t care – but he did. Of course he did. And he would never stop caring – he could never stop adoring Sherlock Holmes.
“Seriously?” Sherlock looked out the window again. “I think you’re right. We all have jobs to do, and mine is to not be myself when I have a camera on me. Make your win seem worth it, you know?”
“Fell for it?” John repeated incredulously. “Christ, the way he was staring at you looked like he was getting ready to jump your bones.”
On one occasion, when the chilly fall weather was settling upon District 12 and Harry was at school, during a particularly intense make-out session in the sitting room (where John had been sitting on the sofa writing, until Sherlock decided to straddle him), Sherlock leaned away from John, checking his watch.
But the three ran through the backstage area anyway, weaving their way through the crew and set designers who were running for their lives, trying to ignore the gunshots, trying to not think about Sherlock and Mycroft, and trying to find a way out.
“But you’re a Career – anything about the Hunger Games is your element, isn’t it? Isn’t that how it works?”
Sherlock reached up, trying to fight him off – trying to find his eyes with his thumbs – he was pretty sure the man was blind at this point – if he could press the shards deeper into his eyes –
At first the woman seemed surprised, and Sherlock wasn’t sure if that was because John had asked her a question instead of barking an order, or the fact that he had mentioned a staircase that only the Avoxes and Capitol Peacekeepers knew about. Once she got over the initial shock, she nodded, and led them to one of the many panels in the wall; the only difference was that this one was removable. She opened the panel like a door, which revealed a metal door. She pulled that one open, too, revealing a grey cement floor and grey brick walls, with a yellow “12” painted on the wall. Sherlock thought it was just a room, until a male Avox came around the corner and passed them, going into the penthouse.
idea what these two ate for lunch? Ice cream!” she answered for him, before he had a chance to reply. “Was this
“It’s William, though,” he reminded him, sneering. “Tell me: have you two said your goodbyes yet? Or are you waiting for the morning of for that final fuck?” he asked, his mouth wrapping around the words slowly, watching John all the while for a reaction.
He nodded, letting John know he heard him, wanting to say it back, but the words weren’t coming – and if they did show up, Sherlock probably wouldn’t even say it then, in fear that if he said anything out loud to John right then, then no words would come to him while he was on stage.
Sherlock glanced up, and Harry’s eyes met his, just for a moment, before he broke eye contact again. He couldn’t look at her, not while he told her to –
John could feel himself shaking under Mycroft’s unyielding grip as they walked, and forcibly tried to remind himself that it was indeed Mycroft behind him – Mycroft who had his hands on him – and definitely not Magnussen or –
“Before he died – before Sherlock and Harry went into the Arena, actually – Mycroft told me that he considered me as his brother – I was his brother alongside Sherlock. And I feel the same way about Mycroft, and I’m going to keep that sentiment with me for the rest of my life. Another thing he told me before he passed – his last words spoken directly to me, actually – was to take care of Sherlock. And I’m going to honor his request with everything I have in me, because, after everything, I owe him that.
When they parted, they met each other’s eyes, and the feeling of pride swelled in Sherlock’s chest when he saw that his kiss did the same thing to John as it did when they were younger: take his burdened brain, rushing with thoughts of which Sherlock couldn’t possibly imagine, and pause it with a sense of calm he couldn’t muster up himself – temporarily immobilizing him with love.
“Thank you,” he said. “Sherlock, on the other hand,” he went on, turning to Sherlock, and John noticed Sherlock straighten up a bit under Dean’s eye. “I need to speak with you now, privately, preferably, and I’m afraid that it can’t wait.”
“Me too,” John chuckled, even though he wanted to see Sherlock kill him more than he wanted to see him die in general. He looked down at the ground as well.
“Sherlock?” John asked, but then Sherlock shook his head, as if snapping himself from a thought, making a decision.
“It’s seven-sixteen at night. I’m in District Twelve.” He took a shaky breath. He could still hear John’s voice saying his name, trying to get him to talk to him, to keep him from walking away –
“I believe that the Gamemakers are concerned that if they allowed for you and John to reunite before the final interview, Sherlock would find a way to see John, as well,” Mycroft explained, and Sherlock crossed his arms.
“Do not pass him anything but soft paper,” the guard informed him as they went, and Sherlock fought the urge to roll his eyes.
Mycroft crumpled to the ground, leaning against the wall as he fell, and Sherlock dashed to his side, not giving a damn about the Peacekeepers – the Peacekeeper that shot him –
As soon as they were in and Sherlock saw the Capitol’s fancy medical team all dressed in white, prepped and ready to go, he instinctively positioned himself between Harry and the doctors.
brother...it’s safe to say that I’ve never known a world without Mycroft Holmes.” Sherlock’s voice broke, and he hated how he was this choked up this early into the speech, but he pushed on. “Now, Mycroft – he had just turned seven years old when I was born; he could very easily live without me; honestly, I think he would’ve had a lot less anxiety in his life if he didn’t have me around – but, unfortunately, that’s not the way things worked out.
“Right, of course,” John replied, taking his son’s hand. “Come on, Hamish – I think I saw an ice cream store down the street –”
He had been, of course – he made a point to hear everything John said – but he needed to prove to the Gamemakers that he was worth betting on.
“I wanted to make them a part of me. In consuming their flesh, I was able to carry each one of them inside of me. If I won the Hunger Games, I would be doing so anyway, on a mental level. Physically carrying them seemed to be the natural counter-balance.”
An AU where John breaks up with Sherlock after the events of Constantly, and then everything goes to shit.
“We’ll take care of it – he’ll cooperate more smoothly with us anyway, and I imagine you’d like to keep this as quiet as possible. Yes. Yes, of course. Good day.” He hung up the phone, looked at John again, and took his umbrella in his hand, standing up. “It seems that Sherlock has done something no tribute has ever done before. I've just been informed that he broke out of training.”
Harry smiled, and then began to back away in the direction of her room, and Sherlock turned to John’s bedroom and put his hand on the doorknob. He was about to open the door, but then Harry spoke, and he looked up to see her head tilted to the side.
Sherlock thought for a moment, but gave up when he remembered just how little time they had – not enough time to really search his mind palace for the answer to such a trivial question.
“I – I met with President Snow last night. He almost didn’t let me – because of what I had said during the interview –”
The teachers who had named Mycroft as their “best student;” the same ones who wrote notes to him and pinned them to Sherlock’s shirt when he had misbehaved in class, after “Mr. and Mrs. Holmes” and just “Mrs. Holmes” were no longer acceptable options to address the notes to.
There was silence, and Sherlock was considering turning back and making sure John was alright, but then he finally spoke.
Mycroft nodded curtly, and together they approached the door. When he put the right key in the lock and opened the door, they were immediately met with the haunting, animalistic screams of the tortured.
The Peacekeeper, glaring at Harry, finally lowered his gun, turned around, grabbed Sherlock by the scruff of his neck and threw him to Harry’s feet, and she fell back to the ground in relief and put Sherlock’s head in her lap, ignoring the Peacekeepers as they made their way back up to the hovercraft.
Three days – it had been three days and they were where it took last year’s Games eight days to reach. But this was not John’s first clue that this year’s Hunger Games were more brutal than last year’s – his first clue had been that it had taken this year’s tributes just over ten minutes to kill half their own, while John’s group took three days in itself.
“Oh,” Sherlock mumbled. “Right,” he said, louder, putting his feet back onto the roof. “I’m going to go...”
And the silence hung between them as they remembered Archie Neal, and the pain of the memory of the youngest Hunger Games Tribute and what he died for latched on to Sherlock’s heart.
Archie was practically hiding behind Atala’s leg, one hand clutching onto hers, and the other one holding onto a worn stuffed mouse toy – his favorite toy, Sherlock figured. He vaguely remembered Archie holding the same toy during his reaping ceremony – Louise must’ve told him he could bring one and that would be his tribute token.
“Of course,” Sherlock said, nodding. “He always wanted me to fix my mistakes; he’d want you to, as well.” At this, Dean scoffed. “What? What’s so funny?”
Mycroft smiled warmly. “They would have loved you, John. And they would have been proud to call you their third son.”
“Yes. Why?” John asked, now not bothering to hide his need to defend himself, furrowing his brow as he looked up at Mycroft.
“Snow, he – he didn’t crown them. He always crowns the victors after the recap,” John said, suddenly anxious. “Why didn’t he crown them?”
John vaguely remembered this – the fight between the two Holmes brothers that John wasn’t allowed to ask about:
“Yes, but if we know something we shouldn’t know we at least have the decency to keep quiet about it, unless, of course, you’re showing off. I know what secrets everyone keeps, I can tell just by looking at them, but I would rather they trust me enough to tell me. I know things about people that could very possibly kill them if it got out, but I stay quiet, while these two would destroy those people with those secrets on a whim and make certain they knew just who it was that ruined their lives. There’s a reason why I haven’t shown you the Fiftieth Hunger Games’ tapes, and that is because Hannibal Lecter Magnussen is a monster. And I’ve met Charles Augustus; he’s exactly the same.”
There were ten total victors from District 4, but eight of them were alive – but one of the victors had gotten permission from the Capitol to stay home sick, not wanting to spread around whatever he had contracted. Still, it was easy to tell which one was Dean. The dark-skinned man looked only a year older than Mycroft, which was Sherlock’s first clue. The second clue was the fact that, while the rest of District 4’s victors kept their distance from the District 12 arrivals, Dean strode up directly to the group upon entering the room, smiling the entire way. Sherlock’s deduction was confirmed when Mycroft, a man who despised the Career Districts almost as much as Sherlock, opened his arms and allowed Dean to hug him.
“Thank you, everyone,” Mycroft said, after a moment. “You may have noticed someone isn’t here.” He gesturing to the empty seat on the opposite side of the table. “I did not invite Hannibal Lecter Magnussen today, and the reason why is simple: I believe he is dangerous, and no matter what we do, his thinking cannot be modified. I do not believe he can understand the weight this bears on all of us, and so, for everyone’s safety, I made sure he had no idea we were going to meet. Also, in the interest of safety, if his brother, Charles Augustus, is killed, I ask that whoever’s sibling kills him comes to find me immediately; we all know that Hannibal will be seeking revenge.”
“Yeah, thank you,” John said, and then glanced around the people in the room, trying to think of any questions for Alexander – who to look out for, who was most likely to befriend him – but then his eyes landed on Clover Frankland, who was using her hands to talk to Louise and Amanda Hawkins.
Which led them here: sitting next to Sherlock, waiting for Dean to tell all of the Hunger Games’ victors what to do in order to get one step closer to going home.
He heard a cry from his right, and he glanced over, past Janine Hawkin’s empty podium, to find Margaret Patterson falling into the water, her hand holding her neck, red blood staining her hot-pink-and-black jumpsuit. The spot to Margaret’s right held her killer – getting ready to toss another hunting knife at another tribute – James Sholto.
“They can stay,” he whispered back – twice, for the first time he tried the words didn’t come out as clearly as they needed to.
“You really should have – maybe then you would have kept a closer eye on Johnny Boy Watson – the damsel in distress that you couldn’t save...”
John didn’t even feel bad as he continued. “I feel like I was promised this long and happy life with the person I love, but now that’s taken away from me – from the both of us. In fact, we were all promised a long and happy life with our families, but now that’s being taken away from all of us. It doesn’t seem right, does it Caesar?”
“I’ll be fine,” Sherlock muttered, just a pinch louder. “I just wish you were here. I still wish you were here,” he said, finally, and turned away, beginning his trek through the park, in the opposite direction his family had gone in.
And Sherlock brought his teeth down on Magnussen’s fingers as hard as he could, and within an instant Sherlock’s mouth filled with Charles Augustus Magnussen’s blood.
The first time Hannibal Lecter Magnussen cooked for Sherlock, he had tried to lie and tell Sherlock it was rabbit, and they both pretended that Sherlock bought the lie, even though Sherlock didn’t touch his plate and threw up that night, anyway.
“Yesterday – it was yesterday. Before the meeting. He asked about broadcasting the service and I asked for it to be broadcast to only District Twelve – and then he asked about…about this…”
It was a beautiful monument, all in all – the sculptor Dean had hired to make the statue captured Mycroft’s details incredibly. Everything was perfect, from folds in his clothes to their mother’s wedding ring on his finger (one that was on Sherlock’s right ring finger, now) to the look on his face – the expression matching the face he had made years and years ago, upon Caesar Flickerman’s stage, a look that Sherlock hadn’t seen until watching back a recording of the events before the broadcast cut out – the look of determination in Mycroft’s features as he amped himself up to start the rebellion…
John remembered the fact that he had once said those very words to Sherlock – just before his evaluation with the Gamemakers before going into the Arena:
He was in black – it was supposed to represent the coal, but Sherlock, his prep team, and Mrs. Hudson found it more representative of the rebellious black outfits the two tributes attended their reaping ceremony in, and Cinna didn’t do much to convince anyone of otherwise. The cuff of Sherlock’s right sleeve contained a hidden button that, when pressed, would cause synthetic violet fire to burst from his cape – one step up from last year’s flames with John. Sherlock boiled it all down to budget – they didn’t have enough to make this fire last year, but since District 12 won the last year’s Hunger Games, they had enough money to experiment with false flames. Of course, this did not stop Sherlock from making Cinna cross-his-heart promise that the fire wasn’t dangerous.
“Damnit, Sherlock – I can't –” he tried to look away – look down – but Sherlock took John’s chin in his hand, and he opened his eyes.
“That...” John eased off his prosthetic, and Sherlock only glanced back it for a moment – it was still a sight to see him without it, but Sherlock never stared in a way that John would notice. “...That... Do you really think there’s a place that doesn’t remind me of – of everything?” he asked.
a voice in his head – Moriarty’s voice – reminded him. He didn’t tell anyone that Moriarty paid him daily visits in his mind – mostly repeating things he had said during the finale, but other times just reminding him that he’s
“Excellent. I should mention, of course, that a few of the previous victors from District Four arrived late last night to celebrate Sherlock and Harriet’s win and are staying in the suite with Dean and Alexander. I know everyone who’s arrived, and I can assure you that they are all as trustworthy as Dean and Alexander. On the off chance that you do have any problems, go immediately to Dean, and he’ll take care of it.”
The hovercraft waited for Harry to leave the area so they could collect the body of Sherlock Holmes, but she was having none of it. John was training to be a doctor – he had taught her at least the basics of CPR –
Today, since John had won the most recent Hunger Games, he had to leave to go on a victory tour of the country they lived in, Panem, leaving Sherlock behind.
The cameras shifted to Sherlock and Harry as a cannon burst from the skies above them, and Sherlock groaned in his sleep. Harry, who was sitting by him, bow-and-arrow in hand, just in case, focused her attention to him. Sherlock groaned again, but his vocal chords created a word instead of only sound:
“John,” Caesar said, quietly, and John opened his eyes to find a microphone in his face. “It’s time to make your decision.”
– live out their lives in peace, with Mycroft and Harry by their sides, and he fell asleep with that image in mind.
“William suffered from an advanced form of encephalitis – the stress of the Games heightened his symptoms – he often hallucinated and lost large pieces of time to his own head. It’s like having to ingest your fog on a daily basis.”
“No, it’s fine.” He glanced at the door Sherlock and Dean had disappeared through, just in time to see Sherlock coming out. “There he is,” he murmured, and waved at him as he saw Sherlock assess the audience, looking for John and Harry.
“He’ll find us – we have to go –” John said, turning her back around, holding her hand, determined not to lose her again, and led her back to the stage.
He remembered Charles Augustus’ smile when he said the words – he remembered how Sherlock charged himself at him shortly afterwards, triggered by what he had said.
“Charles Augustus Magnussen!” he called as he walked, and the brothers turned toward him – Charles Augustus grinning from ear to ear.
“Mycroft?” John asked, his voice slightly hoarse, probably from yelling for help through the sound-proof walls.
irises in the wedding, but apparently her idea of “minimal” did not match up with Sherlock and John’s – frankly, Mrs. Hudson took the liberty of ordering mostly irises, deeming each and every one absolutely necessary, and therefore, “minimal.”
After Sherlock and Mycroft were prepped, John and Harry were sent in to their separate rooms – John with his old prep team, and Harry with Mary’s old prep team.
“While I was away,” Sherlock says. A tangerine mist wafts outside of the window, the damp night catching and holding the heat of the gas lights. “You wanted to know what I was dreaming about.”
John rises to his feet, and Sherlock hears him turn the faucet off. When John returns it is with a wet washcloth.
Ms. Hudson crossed the room to wrestle with the street facing window. Her thin arms trembled as she attempted to heft the weight of the frame. Sherlock watched her from a distance, a moue of discomfort twisting on his face. He was fairly certain she had been capable of that before he’d left. He could vaguely remember her opening that same window on the breezy unusually warm day before he had leapt from the roof of Barts. Or perhaps that had been John. He should have paid more attention to those sorts of things.
was written in Mycroft’s pretentious lettering. The bullet holes above the couch were concealed under new wallpaper. Sherlock traced his index finger over the wall, feeling the hollow indentations where his gunshots had struck. Whatever lackeys Mycroft had sent to prepare the place had worked hard enough to find and dispose of Sherlock’s cigarettes, but had taken shortcuts on actually fixing any damage. Typical Mycroft. Governmental. Uselessly bureaucratic. Empty gestures of goodwill. Sherlock, annoyed, poked his finger through the wallpaper, ripping the mottled indentations into view. There were nine of them in total, and once he had revealed them all he stuck his middle finger up at the wall, imagining Mycroft’s smug face projected across it. That’s for getting rid of my cigarettes, he thought. He swung the kitchen cabinets open (all empty) and left them that way. He peered inside the fridge. The lightbulb was out, but he could tell that the interior had been scrubbed clean and forgotten about long ago.
Sherlock must take too long to come up with an answer, because the door bursts open and bounces off of his shin. Sherlock looks up with bleary eyes at the sleep softened John standing in the doorway. Water has begun to cascade from the edge of the sink, the tap still streaming, a puddle forming around Sherlock’s feet.
Ms. Hudson reappeared with a handful of powder blue sheets. She vanished through the door of Sherlock’s bedroom, a tumbleweed of nervous energy. A few minutes later she was patting Sherlock’s cheek in a goodnight, her eyes rimmed red. She had obviously been crying over his return from the dead while she was putting the sheets on his bed. Sherlock leaned into her touch, a reassurance for her, and, if he was being honest, for himself as well, and then she was gone, the flat sinking into a deep uncanny silence. Cold air threatened to overtake the room, a chill snapping in through the window, dispelling the stagnant muggy warmth. Sherlock shifted uncomfortably. He felt as if he was visiting an estranged relative who had left him alone in their home without clear instructions of what he was allowed to do.
John can’t see me like this, he thinks, and then says it out loud a few times for good measure, voice hoarse and hushed.
John’s eyelids flutter shut, and then open again, more hooded than before. He wraps his arms around the small of Sherlock’s back.
Gratefully, Sherlock drapes the blanket around his shoulders and settles back into the couch, still trembling.
John has good reason to be confused. Ever since John moved back in, Sherlock has tried his best to be more conscientious, terrified of giving John any reason to leave. This means no more experiments at odd hours, no more screeching angry violin (although John enjoys falling asleep to Sherlock’s more soothing original compositions), and no more body parts in the freezer, among many other things.
John exhales, the tight line of tension dissipating from him. He moves his hand from Sherlock’s chin to his shoulders, rubbing across them in soft rhythmic motions.
Sherlock burrows himself into the crook of John’s shoulder, where muscle meets the sturdy length of his neck. He inhales deeply several times. “Pine,” he says, then laves his tongue messily up John’s sternocleidomastoid, following the muscular line to the base of his ear. He wants to devour John, wants to taste every part of him three times over, needs to catalogue the places John derives the most pleasure from.
“I do though,” John breathes out, whispering the vibration through Sherlock’s back, lancing through his lungs and straight out his ribcage.
221B Baker Street was dusty. A thin white film clung to every surface of the flat. The space looked pale, washed out and skeletal, as if it had been bloodletted and drained of life. The air brimmed thick and stale. It smelled musty. Uninhabited. Sherlock’s belongings had been cleared away, clutter sorted into rectangular cardboard boxes that were stacked in orderly piles against the fireplace. The furniture was all arranged just so slightly out of place, as if to show the flat to prospective renters who had never arrived. The skull was the only personal effect left in the open. It looked blankly out at the foyer, the curved dome of bone fuzzy with dust. In the doorway, Sherlock sneezed.
Sherlock wavers back into awareness, processing John’s words. We’ll have to try that sometime. John wants to do this more than just tonight. He wants to do this again. Sherlock grapples with the implication, and it twists him away from his arousal. He loses his grip on the warm tendrils furling through his abdomen, falls into the analytical mindset he so often dwells in. When will John want this again? How many times? Why? Will John feel the same way tomorrow morning? Was he planning this when he went and brushed his teeth? Would John let Sherlock sleep in his bed tonight? Or tomorrow? Sherlock has no idea how he’s meant to act beyond this moment. Will John want him to pretend this never happened? Or will Sherlock be permitted to touch at his own will from now on?
“No, I need to say this.” John steels himself. “I need to. I’ve wanted to.” He speaks quickly and steadily. “After I got my own place I started dreaming about Baker Street. Mostly about you playing the violin. Those dreams were nice. But waking to a quiet flat after them was almost as hard as waking up from the nightmares. I thought moving in with Mary would make things better.” John shakes his head and lets out a derisive laugh, rubbing at his face with the heel of his hand. “It made it worse. It made it so much fucking worse.”
“You’ll have to get them out tonight,” Sherlock mumbles, a haze of sleep weighing heavily on him. He feels John smile against his hair.
“After Barts I was a mess.” John starts again. “I don’t think I slept through a night for three months. I tried to stay here, but it was…” he shakes his head, and his jaw tenses, his masseter muscle bulging. “It was too much for me, it was like I saw you everywhere. I’d wake up from a dream about you dying and my first instinct was to go downstairs to see if you were there.”
“No,” he mutters into the silence of his room, his voice cracking. He drags his hands over his silky sheets, grips his comforter, presses his toes into the give of the mattress. Through his bedroom window, diffused by white curtains, glows the familiar orange street lamp that has been there since the day he moved in. He focuses on it, and then reminds himself to breathe. “Not in Serbia,” he whispers into the darkness. The words rattle out of him and dissipate in the cold air. Sitting up slowly with just his stomach muscles, he reaches out, searching for his bedside lamp. In his disorientation, he knocks a glass beaker from his end table. The beaker shatters on the hardwood floor just as the room floods with light.
John resumes his stroking, faster now. Sherlock exhales harshly several times in a row, thrusting into John’s hand. He is losing control of his thigh muscles, his legs quivering, sending him heavily down into John’s lap.
John’s hand meets Sherlock’s skin in a feathering glance. His fingertips graze over the ridge of the largest scar that runs parallel to Sherlock’s spine. Sherlock shivers, his shoulders shuddering in one exaggerated movement.
“I don’t understand,” Sherlock says, much quieter this time, his bravado dissolving in the acidic air of John’s silence.
Sherlock does it slowly. It’s not at all like he imagined. He stoops over with his hands clasped behind his back and presses his lips to John’s. It is a quick, almost chaste movement. Sherlock has just enough time to register a faint suggestion of toothpaste (had John brushed his teeth when he changed into new pajama pants?) and the chap of John’s bottom lip before he pulls away. A tingle skitters from the crown of Sherlock’s head to the soles of his feet. John’s pupils are blown, deep round wells of black bordered by ringlets of dusky green.
Tilting his body, Sherlock presses his hard length against John’s hip. This seems to snap John out of whatever trance he has fallen into, and he lets out a desperate noise, far too loud for this time of night.
Sherlock leaned against the back of his leather chair as Ms. Hudson exited the flat. John’s paisley plush armchair loomed empty in front of him. Sherlock stared at it until his eyes burned and then he blinked moisture back into them.
“This isn’t how this is meant to go John! I’m useless at these sorts of things.” Sherlock frowns and shoves his hands into his pockets. “What do I want? I want your hands on my ankles again when we watch your horrible shows. I want you to sit out here after you shower in your bathrobe instead of hurrying upstairs to get dressed. Don’t you understand? I want you. I want you to want me again. Or is it presumptuous to say that? I don't know! I don’t want to mess this up.” Sherlock pauses. “I don’t want you to leave.”
Sherlock grips the arms of the chair. John is looking up at him with a suggestion of nervousness. “Don’t be stupid, John,” Sherlock says, and shifts his hips so that their lengths rub together.
When Sherlock wavers back into reality it is with John’s hands stroking his back in a soothing rhythm.
“Oh,” John breathes out. “Alright then. We’ll definitely have to unpack that one. That’s - Jesus Sherlock.” John dips his fingers under Sherlock’s waistline and tugs his pajamas and pants down his thighs in one fell swoop. Sherlock’s cock bobs in between their bodies, precum beading at the head.
They never talked about those sorts of moments that they used to share. They used to sit at the table in the morning, knees brushing against each other, ensconced in their silence and proximity, like it was normal. It was normal. Or at least it used to be. Since Sherlock’s return, John does not touch him like that anymore. Even after the nightmarish debacle with Mary was over, a distance remained between John and Sherlock that Sherlock was afraid to broach. It was enough to have John back at Baker Street. It was enough to hear him puttering around in the morning, to have him nag at Sherlock to eat more, to make Sherlock countless cups of tea that went cold, to hear the rustle of him reading the paper while Sherlock peered through his microscope in the kitchen, or his humming from the shower that he thought Sherlock couldn’t hear.
“I could bring you off like this, couldn’t I? Sit here and play with your nipples, let you grind against me until you lose control. I could.”
“You’ve got nearly three hours then. Come on, we can kip for a bit and then I’ll make us breakfast.”
A flush rises on Sherlock’s chest. He wishes he had put his shirt back on before walking over here. He wishes he had never walked over here at all, had stayed on the couch, had let things taper out as they always did.
He breathed slowly and heavily and then walked back to the kitchen with a measured pace. He closed the cabinets. He ran his palm over the dusty table and sneezed three times. Without looking back at the mess he’d made, he walked into the bathroom.
Sherlock had always imagined a fire would be burning in the hearth when he returned to Baker Street. It seemed an infantile fantasy now in the grey and lonely light. Hesitantly, he began to venture through the flat. He checked underneath the couch for a flap he’d cut in the bottom of the cushion where he kept a hidden stash of cigarettes, but they were gone, replaced with a scrap of paper on which
The familiar clinking of John fixing two cups of tea fills the room. Sherlock turns to face the kitchen. His back vibrates where John’s forehead had rested. In the kitchen, John reaches for a mug from the top shelf. In a few minutes, John will walk slowly back over to the couch holding the tea mugs steady in his hands. They will sit and sip and let whatever they just shared slip away as they always do. Sherlock flexes his hand into a fist. In an instant, he realizes he cannot stand to do this. He springs up from the couch and is behind John before John can react to his footfalls.
The decision is easier than Sherlock thought it would be. He shifts away from John, who traces his hand across Sherlock’s upper back as Sherlock leans forward and then breaks contact, not venturing any lower. Sherlock turns away from John. He faces the window, peering out onto the street. A lamp flickers through the wooden frame. Sherlock lets the blanket fall from his shoulders and begins to pull his shirt off.
Ms. Hudson’s expression gentled. “Of course you do. But tomorrow I’ll be making you a full English Breakfast. And we’ll need to tidy up of course. I know how dust bothers your nose. Let me make your bed for you. I have clean sheets downstairs. You just sit and rest.”
“I’m ju-” Sherlock’s voice breaks. Now that he is aware of the tears on his cheeks, he is finding it hard to stop them.
A deduction wavers across Sherlock’s mind. A small part of John probably thinks Sherlock is shooting up in here. Stopping his entry now will be nearly impossible. Sherlock fumbles forward for his discarded t-shirt and pulls it back over his head, concealing the scars that stretch across his back.
Sherlock feels a brush of soft hair against his back, and then John’s forehead is pressing in between his shoulder blades. John’s hot breath puffs against Sherlock’s back. He puts his hand lightly on Sherlock’s sharp hip bone, just above the line of Sherlock’s cotton pants.
This time Sherlock did not respond. He would have to put a stop to that. It was nothing more than a lingering coping mechanism from his time away, but it felt all of a sudden inappropriate within the walls of Baker Street. He couldn’t justify an imaginary John ordering him around in his head when the real one had been solidly in front of him mere hours ago.
Keeping his eyes closed, he cupped his palms and splashed lukewarm water over his face. He did this several times, until his shirt collar was soaking wet and the fringes of his hair damply affixed themselves to his forehead, his curls loosening across his skin. Satisfied, Sherlock turned the water off and removed his shirt, unbuttoning it with businesslike efficiency. He had been right - he had bled through the fabric in four different places. The shirt was Dior. It was also ruined. He crumpled it into a ball and threw it into the bin. Twisting in front of the mirror, he craned his neck so that he could see the state of his bandages. A splashy panache of red raked across the white wrappings. Sherlock grimaced and the heat switched on, a metallic rumble clanging through the walls. The bandages would have to be changed.
John traces each scar with his index finger. Sherlock does not shiver again, but he can feel goosebumps prickling behind John’s gentle path.
But Sherlock cannot wait, will not wait. He has already been waiting for this for years. Aching for it. An earthquake of suppressed desire is tremoring out of his body, fault lines rupturing, all the things he has ever wanted to do to John tumbling forward as real possibilities - possibilities that need to be explored now, before this moment passes, before this isn’t allowed anymore.
Outside, the sun is just beginning to rise, a deep and gilded blue washing through the flat. Sherlock rests his forehead in the hollow of John’s shoulder and closes his eyes.
Sherlock, fresh from a series of arguments with John that had successively worsened as they went until Sherlock was left alone, blinking and bloody on the stoop of a dingy sandwich shop, wasn’t particularly in the mood for any more airing outs. No, it would be better to sink into the gathered grit of the flat, to accept it for what it was. Sherlock suspected that an exodus of the filth would only reveal that the space was just as desolate and untenable without it, if only a bit more allergy friendly. And without John here to fuss at Sherlock to keep things clean it would take less than a week for the grime to reassert its dominance. Dust drifted in an idle current, glinting through shards of light. Sherlock waved his hand in the air impassively, as if swatting away a swarm of gnats, sending the galaxy of particles swirling outward, before they coalesced back together, impervious to any attempts to disrupt their unity.
Sherlock mewls, a deep rumbling noise erupting from his chest. His erection is slotted right along John’s thigh. Sherlock squirms and thrusts against John. John runs the pad of his thumb over one of Sherlock’s peaked nipples and Sherlock jolts. His nipples have always been overly sensitive, but he’d never known they could feel like this, and at John’s touch he folds forward. Sherlock’s remaining composure shatters into shards of arousal that pierce every part of him. He shudders and deflates, turning himself over to John’s ministrations. The bolt of pleasure has chased all the thoughts from his mind.
John leaned over and silenced Sherlock with a kiss. And when he spoke again, it was in a whisper, his mouth still inches from Sherlock as he looked up into his eyes.
“I am well, thank you. I was just discussing the possible outcome of this year’s Hunger Games with John. Congratulations on your brother’s resurrection, by the way,” Hannibal said.
TRIGGER WARNING: rape, rape mentions, and sexual assault mentions. It's not super graphic but it definitely warrants a warning. This was a really difficult chapter to write, but this is as dark as it goes.
Sherlock looked her over, once more, before his brain was able to dig up the last place he had seen that smile –
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” John assured her, but both boys knew that was only because Sherlock always answered any question with a decent amount of sass, and never showed his work in math.
“No, he rarely gets sick,” Sherlock replied. “And even so, he wouldn’t miss this. When we were kids, he had traveled from District to District and made speeches for the victory tour all while he was recovering from a root canal. There isn’t much that will cause him to miss a Capitol-ran event.”
“Yeah, I think I knew. I think I knew the whole time.” John replied, and as soon as the words passed his lips, the glass barrier appeared between them. Sherlock pressed his hand against the barrier, and John put his hand against the barrier too, so there was nothing but the thick sheet of glass separating them.
Sherlock smiled up at John, tears springing to his eyes once more. He then glanced down at the letter and, before he could really think about it, offered it to John.
“Mycroft gained weight after the Games,” Sherlock’s voice whispered – entirely disconnected from his body.
Sherlock sighed, closing the door behind him. He couldn’t kill himself. He was too cowardly; he figured that out a long time ago.
Breathing was getting hard – his legs were starting to hurt – but he kept running – he had to keep Archie safe – find Harry – and –
Sherlock and Harry’s hands found each other’s, as Sherlock internally groaned in anguish. His fate – both his and Harry’s fates – were once again held inside of a stupid envelope.
“And you came anyway,” Magnussen said, stepping forward, and Sherlock glanced quickly at the ground, making sure he was behind the designated yellow line. “Are we no longer on a first-name basis?” he asked, changing the subject, slightly disappointed.
“Do they normally do this?” John asked, distracted, still watching the other victors watch him. “Just stare and whisper at each other?”
“No I’m not,” John whispered, and Sherlock let go to get a better look at him, tilting his head to the side, confused. “It doesn’t even feel like I’ve left.”
“I’m going to up the anesthetic,” the nurse said, and Sherlock realized that his heart was racing with joy. “He can probably smell the gel.”
“My name is James Hewlett; I am from District One,” said a man who looked about the same age as Hannibal Magnussen. “And my younger sister, Helen Hewlett, is in the Games this year,” he announced, and he, like so many others, sounded like he still couldn’t believe it.
As Sherlock walked, his mind never stopped, not even for a second, until it landed on the Ravenstag.
Mycroft entered the foyer of the training center, the Peacekeeper from President Snow’s mansion behind him.
“For one, the cane is back. Second off, Mycroft’s been watching you like a hawk ever since Harry and I got back. Thirdly, you barely ate anything during dinner, and that normally means –”
In order to get to Hannibal, though, he would have to walk by John and cross paths with Harry, both of whom would want to show
There was a moment as Caesar tried to spin Louise’s answer into a positive. “Well, it’s a great honor, especially if –”
He cleared the fabric of his wetsuit away from the wound and, one at a time, ripped a bandaid open with his teeth and used the sticky adhesive to bring the lower part of his wound up to the other side, bridging the gap between the two sides of the wound. He applied five bandaids this way, pulling and fastening and hoping it worked, being careful not to let the bandaids touch, because if one fell off, then the rest of it would fall apart, too.
The first few weeks, the day John was to leave for District 1, John would ask Sherlock if he wanted to come with him.
“You’re lucky you’ve got Mycroft – he takes all the newbies under his wing when they first come in, no matter where they’re from. When you get to District Four you’ll meet his mentor, Dean Bainbridge – they’re best pals, you’ll see.”
John shook his head and looked at who he was paired up with now, still asleep in his bed: Sherlock Holmes.
– and when I saw you weren’t in Mycroft’s room… It was like hearing your cannon all over again – I was so scared. I had no idea where you were or what you were doing and you had been doing this
“I’m fine – I don’t need a body guard. I’ll be right back,” he said, and made his way across the Circle.
An article is written about Sherlock; John makes a confession; the surviving victors leave the Capitol.
“Thank you for telling me,” he said, finally, and led Sherlock down the second-story hallway, only stopping once he had found the door they were looking for. He turned to Sherlock again, his body language screaming of regret. “This is where I leave you – but I’ll be right outside,” Dean added quickly. “If anything happens just give a shout, alright?”
“Yes, we do, actually – can you get the gel and start putting it on the swelling from the tracker jackers?”
“But this is different!” he exclaimed, looking down again to look John in the eye (it was a force of habit, at this point), until he remembered exactly
“Yeah, come in,” John replied, and Mycroft opened the door and walked inside, seemingly completely recovered from the way Sherlock had talked about him just a few hours ago, sitting on the edge of John’s bed as he sat up.
“Yes!” he exclaimed. “Over here – come on –” he said, letting her drop the bow to the floor and then grabbing her arm, dragging her across the room.
“Thank you. For everything,” Sherlock whispered, hoping those words alone could convey everything he was thinking.
He never knew where he was going to go when he started out, letting his body and his subconscious direct him wherever they wanted to take him, but he always ended up in a place. He never just stopped in a random street in District 12 or in some nonspecific part of the woods beyond the fence – he always went
After about a month of asking, just to realize that he actually didn’t want Sherlock there, just yet, John stopped asking, taking Sherlock’s advice.
Sherlock couldn’t care less if Mrs. Hudson was mad or not. In fact, he didn’t care if President Snow got pissed over the fact that two of his newest tributes showed up to their reaping ceremony in black pants and t-shirts. He didn’t care about anything, really. All he cared about was getting Harry Watson out of this alive. Because, really, she wasn’t part of this until the Capitol put her in the middle of it. Because, when he thought about it, the Capitol just wanted Sherlock dead – Harry was just caught in the crossfire.
“Really?” John asked, surprised. He imagined Mrs. Hudson, storming into Snow’s office, telling him to leave John, and by extension, Sherlock and Harry alone – it didn’t seem like her, at all.
Sherlock was killing himself – slowly, ever so slowly, but he was succeeding. He wasn’t even trying to, as far as he knew. It was funny, to him: in the Arena, where there was seemingly no other option but to die, Sherlock was so afraid of death that he broke almost every Hunger Games rule there was just to live; now, Sherlock was free to live out the rest of his life in any way he wanted, and here he was, killing himself. But he wasn’t
“John, Harry,” Dean warned, standing from his seat, and both siblings stopped to look at him immediately. “I imagine this is a sensitive subject to get through, but we’re kind of in the middle of something, and Harry still has one more question to be asked. Sherlock?” he called, looking over at where Sherlock was sitting.
“I wanted...I just wanted to apologize. To you, at least. For being such an asshole all the time,” Sherlock whispered.
“Orion that’s not what he meant –” Dean tried, but Orion ignored him, keeping his eyes locked on Mycroft’s.
This is never to be mentioned again. Goodnight.” He turned, beginning to walk back to the penthouse, and John took a step after him. “Do not follow. Stay with Dean. Wait ten minutes, then come up,” he called back, and then he was gone, vanishing into the crowd around them.
John stared at Sherlock, his heart racing in his chest, trying to figure out whether or not he was dreaming, as Sherlock reached up, fishing his fingers under the waistbands of not only his jeans but of the underpants underneath.
This wasn’t like one of his usual sleepless nights, though – he normally stayed stationary during those times – sitting up in his room or lying in bed next to a sleeping John Watson as he sorted through his mind palace, deleting what was unimportant, putting events and deductions into files, keeping his mind busy and maintained. This was entirely different. For once, his body was moving, but his mind was not. It wasn’t a trade of energy, however – his mind wasn’t keeping still to make up for his body’s constant motion – it was the crows. He couldn’t think with them continuously aggravating him and feeling blood trickle down his body from the wounds they had given him.
“No one used to know anything, before,” Mycroft went on as if nothing had happened, tearing John from his thoughts. “We only get an idea of what’s to come now...” Mycroft trailed off, and John looked up to find him staring back at John intently.
“It was nice to see you again, Sherlock – Mycroft,” Caesar lied, shaking their hands, and the rest of the tributes and their siblings joined the three of them on the stage. Sherlock, Mycroft, Harry, and John all joined hands for the sign off, and, looking around, Sherlock could see that quite a few of the sibling teams were doing the same. “And that’s all we have this year, folks! Who do
There was nothing except for a wall of panels made of thick sheets of plexiglass between them, save for a few holes at waist-level, so the man could breathe, and a sliding compartment for transporting items back and forth through the glass.
But Mycroft was right; he had to sleep. He couldn’t be nodding off in the City Circle the next day, not when he had to try to act like Sherlock and Harry’s mentor as opposed to the concerned boyfriend and brother he was being currently.
It was as they all were sitting down that John noticed the two Peacekeepers arming the door. A fresh wave of panic flooded over him, and he pushed it away as far as he could. Snow was the President of Panem; of course he had guards. He took a deep breath, the smell of roses filling his nostrils. He glanced around and found vases of flowers in each corner of the room, a whole bouquet of what had to be fifty white roses each in large white vases.
“But then, six months later, when Mycroft returned from his Victory Tour and during the annual winter festival in District Twelve, John and Sherlock dared me to ask the just-turned seventeen-year-old Mycroft Holmes to dance with me. So, even though his presence knocked me from a loud mouthed kid to a shy little girl, I still never backed down from a dare, especially from my brother, so I asked him. And Mycroft said yes. And we danced, allowing for me to complete the dare, but then he just...hung out with me for the rest of the day. He was really nice to me and never made me feel like I couldn’t just ditch him at any moment to hang out with my friends from school instead.
Sherlock was already lying in bed, turned away from the door, when John walked in. He closed his eyes and pretended to sleep as he listened to John walking about the room, getting changed and brushing his teeth and using the bathroom one last time before he went to bed, as if nothing had happened just hours earlier. After a few minutes, John finally crawled into bed, and pressed his body up against Sherlock’s, holding him so tightly he could feel each of John’s pajama buttons digging into his spine. It was almost as if John was trying to hold Sherlock together, and maybe he was. They stayed like this for a few minutes, breathing together, and just when Sherlock thought that John had fallen asleep, John whispered in his ear, breaking the silence between them:
In fact, the gun moved, and Sherlock opened his eyes to see the Head Gamemaker fall to the floor, his shoulder bleeding, and the bullet buried into the wall beside Sherlock.
“We’re gonna go swimming!” John announced, pulling off his socks and tucking them in his shoes. “What does it look like?”
“Hey, Sherlock?” John asked after a while, after they had gone back to the Capitol’s half-step way of dancing (since John was the best at that), despite the faster music playing from the stage.
“Yes,” John said quickly, pushing the thought from his head. He wasn’t going to let Magnussen ruin this for them – he wasn’t going to let the Hunger Games ruin this for them, either. The only things that would matter to John tonight were within these four walls – within this bed.
“But they are not in this room, and we are,” Mycroft went on. “And, to avoid conflict and anger and behavior that would stir itself up in our grief, I feel we should forgive each other, and all of our siblings, for what they are about to do. If anyone thinks that we or our siblings should be blamed for what the Capitol is forcing them to do, or if anyone thinks they will not be able to control themselves in the face of losing their family, I invite you to leave.”
Mycroft had replied, and with that he was gone, back to his house just next door, leaving John wondering what exactly he had gotten himself into when he realized he had fallen for Sherlock Holmes.
“Just lower the arrow; I just want to talk,” she was saying, as calmly as she could, and Harry was glaring at her, not believing a word she said.
Harry nearly jumped out of her skin, spinning around to face him. Her face paled at the sight of him, but she tried to act casual.
Suddenly, his hand was off of John’s private area and pulling down the collar of his shirt. Before he could react, there was a sharp pain; Charles Augustus Magnussen had just put out his cigarette on John’s chest – burning him – branding him.
A part of Sherlock was glad that Mycroft was buried here, like this – his headstone made with District 12’s stone, his name probably carved into the stone by the same person who had carved his parent’s names on their headstones – he could’ve been easily buried in the Capitol, or Dean could’ve given Mycroft a big, fancy gravestone made of marble, but none of that happened.
Sherlock had returned to District Twelve alone a day later. A week after that, Hannibal Lecter Magnussen was at his doorstep, just as they had planned. The two had been living together ever since, learning to live around and with each other, which was no easy feat.
Sherlock finally passed out, sweating buckets and shaking as he shivered under multiple blankets, about two hours later, and as soon as he did, John, without even thinking about it, found himself heading for the door.
A chill went through Sherlock at his words. Of course – he had smelled Sherlock’s morphling addiction before from standing right next to him – of
John knew this moment was coming – it had been coming for three months – but it didn’t mean it still didn’t feel like someone had stabbed him through the heart and ripped out his stomach when Sherlock’s name was called. Tears stung at his eyes – they had been ever since Mrs. Hudson called Harry up to the stage, but the feeling he had when Sherlock’s name was read out loud was different.
“John Hamish Watson, District Twelve, and the Seventy-Fourth Hunger Games,” John replied from where he was sat in the lone chair onstage, and Sherlock sighed from his place in the audience, his stomach already in knots.
The cameras focused in on Aurora Blake as she returned to James Sholto and Charles Augustus Magnussen in sector fourteen.
Introducing: Sara went and reread all of Sentiment and ADDED SHIT! That's right - I READ ALL OF SENTIMENT FOR THE FIFTEENTH TIME.
“So I imagine you wouldn’t want to pay Mr. Flickerman a visit today, as well?” the guard asked, and Sherlock scoffed.
“Two months,” Sherlock corrected him. In fact, he had spent the last two months trying to convince John to remove it, doing anything from actually begging him to making fun of it in hopes that something would inspire John to shave. Even Harry got involved, acting afraid of it whenever her brother entered the room. At one point, John had replied to Sherlock's harassment by saying “I don't shave for Sherlock Holmes,” and Harry spouted a counter-slogan: “Please shave for Sherlock Holmes,” and started leaving tiny signs with said slogan written upon it in various places in their house – anywhere from on the ceiling above John’s bed, to in every single pocket John’s clothes possessed. Sherlock had found one slipped in between two books on John's bookshelf and took it for himself, as a souvenir of the battle.
And, judging by how much John was talking, the serum was prepared to give any fraction of information that John’s head possessed.
I'm so excited I finished it on the seven year anniversary of when I started Hungerlock and I cried (big surprise).
After a couple of months of attending the support group, John found that his going away for those two nights was actually helping Sherlock and Harry’s relationship, as well. Turns out, without John being there to serve as a buffer, Sherlock and Harry could together face the task of re-learning their relationship outside of the Arena, where every conversation they had was caked in a layer of tension and ended with the harsh reality of fear and death taking hold upon them. The learned how to joke again. They taught each other that it was okay to smile and laugh and act like children, just like they used to.
This was definitely some sort of laboratory, and judging by the sort of bed that was in his cell, the prisoners – and subjects – were human.
John stared at the screen in despair. Within two minutes, Magnussen was able to dismantle an alliance and convince two tributes who had known each other for years to kill each other for no reason, just because he wanted to. Because he had that effect on people – he was able to make them do whatever he wanted them to do, or let him do whatever he wanted to them. He did this to John, the girls in his District, his fellow Careers now – everyone was under his thumb, and he liked it that way.
There was a vital part of the announcement that Snow had left out, something that had just been said between him and John, not even in exact words – if John failed to make a decision, John would die alongside them. John wanted to die. He
“I imagined so.” He held his tremoring hand out for Sherlock to see. “I had thought it was simply arthritis, until I had an appointment with the medical examiner.”
Okay let's also talk about Sherlock's relationship with Dean for a minute (and I'm also putting this in Constantly's fun facts as well, because even though this talks about Dean's relationship with Mycroft (which is focused upon in Advantage), it also talks about a bunch of events in Constantly.
“Thank you.” He was then going to turn around and go back to John – he had every intention of doing so – but before he could even think about it, the words were spilling from his mouth. “But there is something that I
The first week of Sherlock’s recovery was hell – even worse than his first detox when he was younger, but Sherlock knew that was only because he was feeling his brother’s death for the first time in full since the night it occurred. Feeling that – feeling the hole in his heart like a fresh wound covered with salt instead of a constant dull ache that he thought he could ignore and survive – on top of the vomiting and the fatigue that came with the withdrawal, made everything Sherlock did a struggle. There were times when he begged John to get him some Morphling – he even gave John the name, address, and physical description of the man he had been getting it from – but John refused every time (he did, however, find the man to threaten him just enough to ensure that he would never supply Sherlock with even a drop of Morphling ever again). He even asked Harry, once, but he immediately retracted the request upon seeing the look on her face.
“John. I'm not going to ask you to choose between us; we both know that it's not me that you'd save – don't try to dispute it –” he said quickly as John opened his mouth to do exactly that. “– we know it's true. I promise you I’ll do everything I can to protect her.”
Tumblr (that basically just contains a shit ton of Hannibal): https://watsonisawallflower.tumblr.com
When John came back on the five o’clock train Saturday evening, without much of an announcement, the decision seemed to make itself, fitting itself into John’s routine: John would continue going to the meetings; become part of the support group. And he did – he attended every meeting, offering support and hearing everyone’s stories.
Instantly, Sherlock felt sick to his stomach as he stared back at Hannibal. He didn’t need to deduce anything – the words Hannibal was saying seemingly directly to him was enough.
. “And these are our names – Aunt Louise and Aunt Harry and John and me.” He then pointed upwards, at his brother’s name. “And this is Uncle Mycroft’s – he won the Game, too.”
John, still stupidly frozen to the spot, watched the scene from the stage, and then made eye contact with someone in the first row of the audience – someone who, like him, was just standing there. It took a second for John to recognize him – it was Claudius Templesmith, the Hunger Game’s announcer. He stood, getting pushed around by the escaping Capitol bystanders, but he still managed to glare up at John despite that. He was talking into something like a handheld phone – John couldn’t make out the words he was speaking, but once they made eye contact, a small, sinister smile grew on Claudius’ face.
John couldn’t bring himself to look at either Sherlock or Harry. If he did, they’d know instantly that he was the one who had to make the final decision – they’d know what he had to do. They’d know the threat he was under: if he didn’t make a choice, or if he made the wrong choice, he – or worse, all three of them – would be killed.
“God forbid a tribute in the Hunger Games should come across as intelligent,” Sherlock muttered, rolling his eyes.
Strangers filled the room, talking and dancing and trying to sneak a peek of Sherlock and Harry without seeming too obvious. Mrs. Hudson and Mycroft separated themselves from the group almost immediately, leaving Sherlock with Harry and Louise, which Sherlock didn’t mind, at first. For the first hour, he stuck by the two girls as Louise led them around, introducing them to her friends, all of whom were past victors of the Hunger Games who had siblings who had been killed just days before, but everyone seemed especially kind to Sherlock and Harry, specifically a deaf woman by the name of Clover Frankland (the sister of the tribute who had tried to drop a tracker jacker nest on Harry’s head), and Alexander Waters (whose sister he had just watched get killed by Capitol-created mosquitoes). Amanda Hawkins refused to speak to Sherlock, however, which Sherlock didn’t blame her for.
Dean stepped up to the podium first to give a small introduction, thanking everyone who showed up as quickly as they did. But no one was there for Dean, and even he knew that, so he stepped down quickly, and gave Hannibal the microphone.
“Which way?” Sherlock asked, but Mycroft spun them around, facing back the way they came. “Mycroft? Which way?”
He quickly crossed the hallway between John’s bedroom and his own, opened his bedroom door and closed it behind him, and only then did he let himself cry.
“In Twelve,” Sherlock confirmed, without a bit of sarcasm. “I can’t stand it here – the way everyone looks at me. They pity me – they all do,” he went on, nearly spitting the words. “I can’t stand it.”
However, that was just the problem: John did not pass through the doors. Hours passed, with Mycroft’s heart beating harder and harder in his chest with each passing minute, and John still did not return from Snow’s mansion.
He got changed out of the dirtied suit first and into pajamas, like he had told John he was in there to do, but could feel the box of Morphling’s presence as if it had eyes that followed him as he moved about the room. By the time he pulled his nightshirt over his head, his fingers were itching with the need to open the box, and the veins in his arms were craving its contents.
It was so weird for John, being back in the Capitol. He had walked the corridors of the Training Center so many times, but never with Sherlock holding his hand, never so confident that he was not going to die there, or to be brought to a place where he was going to die. And, for the first time, he did not feel the desire to leave his body – to think of other things while he went through the motions of doing whatever the Capitol wanted him to. Of course, this did not take away his desire to leave the Capitol as soon as possible.
He knew he had seen them before, just like how he had seen the Ravenstag and the traps made of ropes that couldn’t be cut through before. These were a recycled element of the Thirty-Ninth Hunger Games, a Capitol mutation just like the Ravenstag. These crows were genetically bred by the Capitol to be larger and meaner and far more dangerous than their natural counterpart.
About an hour after the Watson siblings retreated to their respective rooms, Sherlock finally moved from the sofa in the sitting room to finally ­–
And suddenly, John was hyperaware of his own missing leg – so much more aware than he had been in a while, and in a way that he had never felt before.
Despite the fact that John had no idea Sherlock had that in him, or that Harry had the heart to enjoy it, he couldn’t help but breathe easily, deep sighs of relief.
John looked back at Sherlock and Mycroft, who were hanging festive cake-shaped lanterns that hadn’t been there five seconds ago. “What the fuck?” John said.
The others had not reached the penthouse by the time the two boys had arrived, which John was thankful for as he pulled Sherlock by the hand through the vacant sitting room, down the hallway, and to John’s room.
“John got hurt during our last training day – he kept acting weird – we all saw it, but we...he shut us all out. But now I know why.” Sherlock turned back to Magnussen. “Now I know who hurt him.”
Dean Bainbridge was boisterous, focused, and seemed glad to be where he was; all of these things intimidated John to no end. But Mycroft was right – Dean had been his mentor – he had helped him, a boy from District 12, to survive the Games, when he really didn’t have to. That had to mean
“Like...twenty hours? They made an announcement that your cannon was retracted yesterday afternoon.” She smiled at the thought. “It was funny; I’ve never seen the Gamemakers reveal they made a mistake before. I wish you could’ve heard it.”
“What do you mean?” she asked, cocking her head to the side, confused, as she rightfully should’ve been.
“When the weight of this new world set itself fully upon my shoulders, and once I understood what that truly meant for me, at first I fully intended to disappear. I planned on dismantling who I was, brick by brick, and leaving. But then I realized that it would be better for everyone, and that it may even be better for me, if everyone knows exactly where I am. I wanted you all to know where you can always find me.”
The woman stared at him for a moment before glaring at him, as if the words had never been uttered in her general direction before in her life.
“My name is Mycroft Holmes and this is John Watson, and we’ve been called to a meeting with President Snow,” he informed them as they looked over the invitation.
She had a scar on her chest – a scar of a wound that looked just like the one John himself had gotten only days ago.
“Yes, I did, but only a few people know about this, and none of them are the Gamemakers, so you must keep it to yourself.”
The mayor of District 11 read his words, and then John read his. For some reason, it felt as if this was only a practice run for him, and, with a realization that caused him to stumble over his words, he knew why: Beth and Andrew were both Bloodbath deaths. Neither of them made it to the final six, or even the final twelve; they narrowly made it into the final twenty. He did not know these tributes; John and Beth didn’t even look at each other, and he had only heard Andrew speak three words while sitting next to him on the ride to the Arena, and they weren’t even spoken to John directly.
“Wait! Stop, stop!” Claudius Templesmith shouted, and Sherlock and Harry put their weapons back at their sides, looking up at the sky. “Ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to present the victors of the Seventy-Fifth Hunger Games, Harry Watson and Sherlock Holmes! I give you – the tributes of District Twelve!”
He looked up – or down, in his case – to find that he had dropped his sword in the confusion. If anyone were to pass by, he couldn't even keep quiet and hope they wouldn't see him – his only weapon underneath him would give him away.
His earliest memory of Harry – one of John’s earliest memories in general – was when she was about a year old, when he was four. He had been her biggest supporter in her quest to begin walking – holding her hands as she slowly toddled around the house, catching her when she fell, and encouraging her when she got frustrated.
Upon entering the house – four days, twelve hours, forty-seven minutes and fifty-five seconds since Mycroft’s heart stopped beating – Sherlock nearly collapsed with grief.
“No one’s coming up...oh! Robin Heaney’s off the grid! And Julia Waters is now swimming back to shore, having won the fight!” Caesar narrated for the viewers.
“He threatened Harry – called her Bloodbath meat – he threatened Sherlock – told me he’d try to make his death quick –”
William shrugged. "I only delete unimportant things." he replied bluntly, frowning at John when he burst out laughing.
John smiled a little at that and sat down next to him. Stubborn and passionate, two words he'd use to describe William, especially when on a case. His friend was on to something but the police wouldn't believe a 9 year old boy. Why would they? What 9 year old could make a connection like that? William Holmes, clearly.
John had come over, waiting for William to come home when the boy had walked in, the strap broken as he dragged his bag behind him. His hair was more out of control than usual, rips were in his shirt and he was covered in grazes, even a dark ring was forming around his eye. They weren't even being subtle about it anymore.
"My world is..." John paused once he'd sat down, contemplating what to say. "Similar to yours. We have different technologies and values, some here might call it a Utopia- that's a perfect world if you-"
On the other side of the door John had spun around, his natural instinct was to close the door, knowing full well he wouldn't actually be able to. It was why he couldn't describe the feeling of shock of the sound that followed. He could hear his heartbeat in his ears as his hand hesitated over the door handle again, quickly pulling back again. Was this why he wasn't supposed to get older? No one had ever mentioned this about ageing before...
"But you have physical proof of how badly they've been hurting you. That should be enough for them to take action."
"Yes." John answered honestly. "I... There have been very few cases where my people have been remembered up to your age now. Even fewer that are teenagers."
"This is different, John." Mike interrupted seriously. "It's not as if the child is unimaginative. In fact he has one of the greatest minds the world will ever see. He's just stubborn, adamant he needs no one but himself."
"It's part of the job, Sarah." he interrupted again. "There's always going to be children in need. And if that means I can't take time off, so be it. We're making a difference."
It was rare for them to be remembered this long. The oldest he knew one of his kind had been was 14. He remembered she'd retired after that, the loss of that final child being too much for her in the long run.
John read through the newspaper article as they rode on the bus, William holding it open for him. Carl Powers, an 11 year old boy visiting London for a swimming contest, had drowned after having a fit in the water. The lifeguards had been too late and couldn't save him. William was right, something about it seemed wrong but he couldn't put his finger on it.
William was beaming at him. "Exactly! It doesn't make sense! Come on!" he grabbed his bag and ran out, John hot on his heels.
"It's been a while. It was inevitable now I'm no longer playing cops and robbers every other day. Come in." he said, holding the door open for John to walk into his office.
"No, no humans don't. My people can live for as long as they wish so long as they continue to be imaginary friends." he replied. "I'm almost 500." he said nonchalantly, smiling to himself at the shock across William's features. "I'm one of the oldest though. I'm just too good at what I do to retire."
John clenched his jaw, nodding a little. "Right. Fine. I'll... I'll leave you in peace then." he replied in monotone, getting up from the bed.
John reached his level and rolled his eyes at him. "To make you a more valuable member of society or something like that." he answered, sitting on the branch opposite him.
"No. You're telling them now." John said firmly, wishing he was able to touch him so he could pick him up and take him right there and then.
John had read the cover and frowned when he looked back to him. "Tragic Carl died doing what he loved?" he read out.
"I've always hated rain too." a voice said from behind him and he whirled around at the sound of the stranger. "Playing outside is the best kind of playing."
"You can't touch me though." he said with a shrug. "Of course your other senses can pick me up, that's part of the imagination's picture."
His attendance was at an all time low, his classmates made an effort to seclude him and whatever Mycroft was doing was making the bullying worse, not better. So Sherlock didn't go. And whenever he did, he didn't attend his lessons. He just spent his time in one of the Chemistry labs. The teachers did nothing about it as they knew they'd have to face Mycroft's consequences.
Sherlock was crumbling. John could see it. He had been doing so well until Mycroft had started meddling at the school. He'd left for university when Sherlock started secondary school but now that he'd graduated a year early, he was back to try and change Sherlock's life. He was controlling and manipulative and John hated him. He was bringing more attention to Sherlock from everyone at the school. The teachers knew of him and the students were aware of who he was before, but since Mycroft's input, everyone knew who he was and what his brother could do so in the end people hated him or were scared of him, teachers and students alike.
"So what's the plan?" John asked as they entered the building, reopened for business from the prior day's events.
After a while of walking, Sherlock couldn’t hear the Ravenstag behind him anymore. Sherlock turned around, and it was about thirty feet back.
Every Peacekeeper they ran into warned them not to go too far away from the train, and Sherlock assured them that they wouldn’t with increasing annoyance. Of course, everything in Sherlock’s being wanted to take John as far away from the train as they could possibly go, but it was too cold, too dark, and John was too under the Capitol’s eye.
John grit his teeth, squinting at the number five, careful not to make any noises apart from a sharp inhale.
She looked up to the skies to find a larger-than-life hovercraft materialize directly overhead, beginning to drop a ladder from a trapdoor at the bottom of the craft, and Harry knew what she had to do.
All of these memories swelled up inside of him, mixing into each other and forming a lump in his throat. This was that same girl, the one he had watched grow up into who she was, now, in front of him. But she looked so different, too. He imagined he did to her, as well.
He needed morphling for everything, these days, and there was a small part of him that hated it, but the closest he got to quitting the stuff was the evening he was reading Mycroft’s notebooks and found the entry in which Mycroft found out about the first time Sherlock was using:
“You have…two children, don’t you?” he asked, and Sherlock set his jaw and tightened his fists, but his heart raced with fear.
“Thank you, Mister President; I honestly appreciate this, but I’m one to swear off of alcoholic beverages once the Hunger Games are over.”
While Antonia, Clover, and Pollux all got off of the train at their respective Districts (in Pollux’s case, he left with Clover at District 10’s station, much to Louise’s amusement), Dean and Louise all stayed with John, Harry, and Sherlock for the journey back to District 12.
“Ooh, I haven’t heard that in a while – can we get a recording of that sometime? Just when I need the reminder that you’re actually human?”
How many people had lost their lives in 12 that night, besides his parents? Was anything destroyed – was the Watson household even still standing? Or the Holmes’? And what of the survivors, the people of 12 that John had grown up with, had known for all of his life? How would they react to his arrival? What about to Sherlock’s?
Finally, after a series of “yeah”s and “okay”s, John said that he’d “think about it,” saying goodbye to James, although it sounded like John had already thought about it.
“It’s alright,” he said to him, and John hoped that he wasn’t just imagining the double meaning – that it was alright for Mycroft to leave him behind, and it was alright that John had spoken out of turn. “Send someone for me when you get back, will you?” he asked, and John found himself nodding, disjointedly, almost as if he wasn’t in control of his body.
“Yes, I know exactly what it is, and I’d prefer it if you kept this information to yourself, or I’ll have to spread some unsavory information about you – and we
“Well, when John and I were younger...we played a different game – it was called the Hunger Games,” Sherlock revealed. “We...we won them, actually.”
“The recap is tonight, and then the two of you will see him tomorrow night,” he confirmed, and then checked his watch. “But right now – any minute, in fact – the wetsuits you wore in the Arena will be delivered here; not the exact ones, but replicas,” he added upon looking up and seeing the confused expressions upon Sherlock and Harry’s faces. “From there, you’ll meet with Mrs. Hudson, Cinna, Connie, and myself, and then we’ll go up to the Penthouse for dinner.”
“I know for a fact that you enjoy sherry, Mycroft, and as for you, Mr. Watson, I noticed you had taken a fondness for the vodka served down in the City Circle, am I correct?”
“It’s okay,” Sherlock whispered back, kissing John softly, and then the movement of the line caught up with them – the horses stepped forward, pulling the chariot behind them, and pulled Sherlock away.
The talent search had not been going well. The only thing John was good at was what he was good at all along: he excelled in medical care. In fact, he had gotten a job working to become a doctor for the District. There were only two doctors in District 12, a husband-and-wife team, Mr. and Mrs. Monroe. Mrs. Monroe saw to the women and children, and Mr. Monroe saw to the men. They spent their free time training their children, Susanna and Thomas Jr., in their ways, so when they eventually passed, the practice would be passed over to them, making it a brother-sister team. But about month after John returned from the Games, the Monroe’s went to John and offered to mentor him, and John jumped at the opportunity. And so, while Sherlock and Harry hung out after school, he spent a few afternoons at the Monroe’s, working alongside Mr. Monroe, Mrs. Monroe, and Thomas Jr. (Susanna was in Sherlock and John’s class, thus still going to school, whilst Thomas Jr. was two years older than John), then Sherlock would be back to John’s side once John was done for the day.
Sherlock ended up getting so frustrated that he took another hit of morphling just to calm himself down.
Sherlock sighed, frustrated. Of course it was a joke – this was the Hunger Games. Having legitimate medical supplies – supplies that might actually
“And now we honor our third Quarter Quell,” he said, and the girl stepped forward, holding the box up to him. He lifted open the lid, revealing tidy rows of small envelopes – for the many years of the Hunger Games to come. Sherlock felt as if he had been punched in the stomach when he saw them, but watched all the same as President Snow took the envelope in the front of the rows, marked with a 75 on the front, opened the envelope and read its contents:
When he reached the top of the hill in the outskirts of District 12, the one that led down to their meadow, John looked down and saw the most painful image he had ever seen: Sherlock Holmes was crumpled, on his knees, in the pouring rain, sobbing.
John snapped his head over to the mayor, and found everyone was quiet, staring – waiting for him. As he fumbled for his Capitol-issued index card, he was for once glad he could not see Mycroft’s expression. As John felt the heat of embarrassment inch its way up his neck and spread across his face, he rushed through his speech.
“I thought the view was better on this side,” John replied, sarcastic. “I was summoned by Sherlock and Harry, and I wouldn’t have enough time to make it to the mentor’s box, so now I’m here.”
“They just let you both live,” Mycroft reminded his little brother, cutting him off. “I’m not sure if you’re aware of this, but, for lack of a better way to say it, the Capitol is pissed.”
Both of the Watson siblings stared at Sherlock for a moment, slack jawed, and Sherlock rolled his eyes.
“Now you’re just sounding like my sister,” John said, and Sherlock leaned away from John to see his boyfriend trying to smile.
Once he realized what Sherlock was trying to do, Magnussen spat in his face, getting it up his nose and into his eyes and mouth – Sherlock’s lungs burned with pain as he struggled to breathe –
Sherlock opened his mouth to repeat it, but he couldn’t find the words to ask the question again – to ask how long John had been a father.
“Well, what about Seneca?” John asked. “If Cinna’s dead and...” he glanced at Sherlock, and changed his direction of thought. “I shot him – I don’t know if he died. Please tell me the Head Gamemaker’s dead,” he whispered, and Louise nodded.
Despite the moments of happiness between them, the ones like the night before in bed with Sherlock, John knew that, in his darkest moments, he would still remember what Magnussen did to him. If he thought about it hard enough – which he tried to avoid doing at all costs, but sometimes it would slip through the walls he put up around that one section of his brain – he could still feel Magnussen’s hands on him, his tongue in his mouth. He had dealt enough with the post-traumatic stress from the Games to know that there was nothing in this world – no amount of good days or laughter or love – that would make it all go away or at least make him completely forget those excruciating five minutes.
Mycroft stepped away from Sherlock, and pointed at the Morphling drip still attached to Sherlock’s arm.
He didn’t know what was keeping him on the stage until he realized what he was looking at: Victor’s father. He was waiting for a response, some sign of forgiveness – anything –
“You’ve gotten fairly good grades, John; I’m sure you’ve paid attention in your history classes,” Mycroft said lieu of an actual explanation. “You tell me.”
And, even though there were moments where John could still feel Charles Augustus Magnussen’s hands on him, and Sherlock still found tears in his eyes whenever it snowed, they were happily married, and were still,
And, for a moment, Sherlock was caught off guard by Dean’s statement. Sherlock had always seen himself as the polar opposite of his brother; risk-taking when Mycroft would have hesitated, mouthy when Mycroft would’ve stayed quiet, rule-breaking where Mycroft would’ve kept his toes in line – the wild child to combat Mycroft’s parental nature.
He barely registered Sherlock letting go of his hand, or the microphone being clipped onto his chest, or doors opening before him –
Sherlock barely remembered the girl with the tattooed freckles – he felt like he had met her years ago, as opposed to a few months – but still he felt sick to his stomach. There would be a three year old in the Arena – his Arena. He’d be fighting for his own life, hear a cannon, and a three year old would have left the earth. He wanted to vomit. What had little Archie done to deserve this? He was a child. What had Harry done? At least Sherlock knew he had earned this, just by being smart – by thinking he could outsmart the Capitol and get away with it.
