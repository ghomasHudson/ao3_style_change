“It’s the principle of the thing Cas.” Dean says. They pass by colourful boxes of spinach and lentil pasta, slowing as they reach what seems to be a neverending shelf of rice. “Goddamn there’s a lot of different kinds.” He leans in, eyes tracking down the packages.
Cas releases him, practically growling in frustration as if he didn’t know the instant he touched him in Hell what he was getting into. Like a certain redhead, he has a lot of underlying issues to address, and he’s more than a little adorably obsessed with the angel in front of him. He’s putting his all into this whether Cas likes it or not.
“Good luck with Lucy. You’ll need it,” Amenadiel says.
“Is he going to keep doing that?” Linda asks.
It reminds him of the looks Lisa would give him when he made Ben laugh or went above and beyond the call of duty helping him with his homework. Dean’s always been nurturing, and he’s sure that was one of the big pluses that kept Lisa from dumping his emotionally distant ass at the time. His mind wanders to his competition. He doubts the devil is the nurturing type, but it wouldn’t hurt to check. If nothing else, he’s securing their place as the go to fun uncles before their little visit is over.
Castiel can’t think of a better reason. If his other self was as terrible as his scant memories seem to confirm, he can’t conceive of a reality where that gorgeous green eyed man could possibly want him back. Dean must have simply lost his nerve when he realized he didn’t remember anything he did. Why else would he be so angry that Castiel didn’t recognize him? Not that he blames him for feeling cheated, there is no real point taking revenge on a blank slate after all.
The demon finally calms down and lets Aziraphale take the lead. Dean grimaces. He'd been hopeful when Cas said they might be going to a pub or something, but this is something else. Aziraphale seems to sense his anxiety and tries to reassure him.
Strange, he knows it's not his first, but he’s sure that it didn’t compare to what he’s experiencing now. It is short but passionate and more than a little possessive. Sure, the man still reeks of alcohol, but he can’t find it in himself to care. Everything about the kiss is so very Dean, and this Righteous Man is all he ever wanted even before he was capable of wanting.
“The kind that makes you fall.”
Dean scowls. He’s no better than Michael then. Really shouldn’t have expected different.
“Amateur.”
Castiel was right to come here. His older brother is truly wise. Despite this, Lucifer seems alarmed by his conclusion, desperately grabbing hold of his arm.
He kind of feels the need to defend Cas’s honor after that snide remark.
“He hates me.”
“I never said that. If anything, I’m surprised you think I’m worth retrieving,” he admits.
“Besides, at this juncture of our relationship, I would not allow a harem to develop,” Cas whispers into his ear as arms and wings wrap around him possessively.
Aziraphale successfully turns the customer away with the excuse that he’s currently dealing with a family emergency which is a bit of an exaggeration, but Castiel still nods gravely and looks down. The man leaves in a huff and threatens to return in a week’s time. He’s clearly familiar with Aziraphale’s avoidance tactics and looks undaunted by the delay. Crowley helpfully fills him in, telling him that Mr.Poe is the angel’s best customer which naturally makes him Aziraphale’s least favorite person.
“What did Sam say?” he asks, wings twitching nervously.
Cas bites his lip, still refusing to look away from the elevator. Maybe, Lucifer can clear things up for him. He’s always been better with humans.
“Why not?”
He sighs, sounding unbelievably tired.
Cas’s irritation shifts to something too sad for Dean’s liking.
“Care to explain why you were holding up an angel blade looking like you were about to wipe Castiel from existence? ”
“Different Lucifer,” he reasons.
“It was Jimmy’s, and Dean likes it.”
“I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings, but you have a tendency to steamroll others to get your way. It can be quite taxing,” Cas says with a grimace.
Dean’s eyes widen as he realizes how screwed he is. He can think of three things off the top of his head that would be more than enough for the devil to write him off as an abuser who needs to get gone yesterday.
“Sorry, I overreacted. Thank you for not stabbing me for my insolence.”
Lucifer proves the old adage true and pops up behind them at the mention of his name. He idly wonders if Dean accidentally prayed to him, regardless of his original intent.
Thankfully, this appeases Lucifer somewhat, and he puts the knife away.
“No Dean, I- when Naomi-”
Dean almost falls out of his chair again, but he’s there to catch him. His eyes are comically wide, and he swallows nervously.
“I had complete faith in you, and you lied to me. You pretended we were still in this together while you went behind my back and put your faith in a demon, and it got you killed.”
He has a nagging feeling something’s wrong.
“We’re not leaving him here,” he snaps.
Lucifer shakes his head, wrapping his shoulders around Castiel, hopelessly fond.
He jumps into Cas’s arms and wraps his legs around his waist. He gets the reaction he was hoping for, oh and getting his angel flustered is a nice bonus.
“Hello Dean.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
Cas shakes his head weakly.
“Welcome to the family.”
“So what? You’re going to leave me a single parent. Is that the super special awesome life you want me to have on Earth? Because any life without you in it is going to be Hell for me.”
“Cool, you done stalling?” Dean asks.
“Why did you run away?” he asks, cutting to the chase.
Cas grits his teeth, and he catches a quick wing flick from the corner of his eye.
That someone might be missing you.
“You’re incorrigible.”
“No, it wasn’t a sex thing, Lucy.”
“Believe it or not, even though I chose you over my family, I still miss them. Visiting these worlds allows me to forge connections with members of my family that are otherwise lost to me in our world. Will you deny me this small happiness?” Cas asks.
“I suppose so. The things I do remember are incomplete and out of context. Can you fill in the blanks for me?” he asks.
He instantly finches and briefly wonders if angels can read minds in this universe after all.
“I love you. You could betray me a hundred different ways, and I’d still love you.”
Dean feels impossibly warm all of a sudden, and he wonders if he’s been put in an angel cocoon for safe keeping. He relaxes, trusting Cas to hold him steady. Grace flows into him like an involuntary antidepressant. He should probably yell at the angel for overstepping but it’s nice to just be for a sec.
“Burgers from Tommi’s Burger Joint, most likely, it’s what I’ve been eating for the last three months. I’m sure Crowley must have cried tears of joy when he saw you. He’s been complaining loudly that he’s sick to death of burgers. Unfortunately for Crowley, Aziraphale is an absurdly good host and has been treating me to burgers every time I ask, which is pretty much every day.”
Cas narrows his eyes, wings snapping shut behind him.
His stomach flips, and he has to remind himself he’s too old to be thinking about having a second-no third kid. Besides, why go through all that trouble when they’re in a prime position to spoil the Hell out of their friends’ and family’s kids without any of the responsibility?
He can't help but feel a swell of pride. He'd corrupted the angel good.
His other hand cups his cheek, and he lightly brushes his thumb over Dean’s lips. He thanks this universe’s God that Aziraphale bailed already, or Dean would have definitely ruined this moment between them just because there was another person in the room.
“It took you twelve years to make a move. I may be an optimist but even I realized this was a long shot,” Lucifer says, continuing to drown his sorrows in alcohol as if Dean is a typical bad boyfriend cliché and not the love of Cas’s life.
“Kind of like a wall?”
“Sure, maybe, I’ll jog something loose. If not, we’ll kick Lucifer’s ass and politely tell him to give you back the rest of your brain.”
“Not gonna happen,” he says, grabbing the angel by the shoulder. He’s surprised when he manages to restrain him. Cas might as well be human.
Aziraphale ribs him, scolding him lightly.
“I’d appreciate it if you kept your opinions to yourself. I did not spend millennia in that cold miserable place for my brother to take the credit. I am the punisher of evil. My brother is a glorified IT.”
Honestly, they might have gotten together sooner if Sam had decided to become a lawboy after all and quit hunting. He lets that thought slip his mind when he feels Cas’s chapped lips on his forehead. Dean shuts his eyes and inhales a shaky breath. The moment ends and Cas withdraws.
“What did I say about reading my mind, Cas?”
“Okay.”
“Of course not, your candid and compassionate nature is why you’re a favorite of mine. If you want to play therapist for the night, feel free,” he assures him, and Cas gives him a little smile like he’s a good supportive big brother.
When they come back home, they don’t go back to Heaven right away. Instead, they plant their own garden. They go visit Claire and Kaia. From there, Dean insists that Cas should see the kid Garth named after him. And, it only seems natural to return to the bunker and check on the garden after that. Sam mysteriously shows up one day with Eileen. Dean runs up and hugs him. For once, tears fall freely from his eyes, he knows what his brother gave up to be here. They stay at the bunker, and he doesn’t confront Cas when he starts feeling more human. He’s happy, and when they do go and visit Crowley and Aziraphale again, he brings Crowley a plant in thanks. To this day, Dean’s never seen him yell at it. Of course, all the other plants hate the tiny little succulent named after him. He wouldn’t have it any other way. Cas, in his infinite wisdom, makes the situation worse by bringing another plant from their garden to keep little Dean company. Crowley names that one Cas, and subtly, reasserts his authority by using the other plants jealously against them. It’s kind of hard for Dean to hate him after that. Cas’s a weird nerdy dude who deserves an equally unhinged dorky family, and he’s finally got it. If only Lucifer would stop trying to set Cas up with a nice prophet, his life would be perfect, but that’s a story for another time.
"By the way Dean, I'm going to need your help carrying all our new plants back to the bunker. I thought I'd start a garden there."
“You’re such a kidder, Dean.”
The words have the desired effect. Dean’s eyes light up with mirth, and he breaks into a laugh.
“Are you under the impression I’ll have a change of heart? Shame Cassie here found you first. You radiate such pain and terror. I would have loved digging my claws in, ” he says sweetly.
Whatever, at least, he still has sweetheart and sunshine. He’s still trying to get babe and angel on the table, but it’s slow going.
“You’ve invited if the wedding ends up happening,” Cas says as he once again carries Dean bridal style out the door because this is their new normal apparently.
Your stupidly sacrificial angel doesn’t keep secrets from you and repeatedly make the same mistakes over and over again. You don’t get worse and worse until you almost turn into the very thing you spend a quarter of your life fighting and drive the angel away without ever once entertaining the thought he would have stayed if you asked him to. What he wouldn’t give for them to follow a nice uncomplicated storyline for once. Cas deserves the world, and he’s settled for Dean.
He nods sagely before Lucifer can get into a panicked spiel about how he would never disrespect Sam’s boundaries after his trauma with the last devil he encountered. He’s not about to let his brother ruin the mood anymore than he already has. Cas takes Dean’s hand and drags him out of the bar to make new memories that hopefully won’t require an English degree to decipher should he ever lose them again.
“Lucifer?”
If his little brother hadn’t taken a painstaking amount of time singing Dean’s praises and gushing about his brilliant perfect little soul, he would have flat out told him that the idiot lumberjack wasn’t worth it. As it stood, he’d interfered enough, and any partner that would take on Dear Old Dad when he was clearly in the wrong was a good egg in his book.
Huh, some things never change, do they? Dean laughs, assuming it’s not a world ending thing there. Cas doesn’t seem overly worried at least.
Castiel tenses when he feels Lucifer’s hand on his shoulder. He looks up and is surprised by what he finds. His brother actually looks worried for him, sympathetic, as if recognizing something of himself in Cas. He stiffens further at that realization. Is Lucifer what his family sees every time they level scorn on him? Is the doubt he is beginning to feel just a symptom of something that was always underneath?
“Oh Amenadiel who art thou in the suburbs. Could you take Cas to a hospital?”
“That does sound like him,” he says quietly.
“I take it you used to be a demon?”
Castiel doesn’t give him any further details. He’s not sure if it's out of caution or embarrassment. The fact is that Castiel and Dean’s profound bond has become quite the scandal in Heaven. He deliberately marked a vessel meant for another, went on to proudly display the size of his wings in a subconscious attempt to woo said vessel, and for all intents and purposes, has been at the beck and call of the Righteous Man since he freed him from Hell. It doesn’t help that Dean seems to actively detest Michael and has foolishly dubbed him Cas, actively removing any association with his Father from his name. As far as Heaven is concerned, Dean has claimed him right back.
“ I’ve been researching ways for Jack to transfer his powers to someone else. Finding a solution has taken longer than I expected even with Aziraphale’s resources.”
Jack doesn’t count obviously. All three year olds are creative.
Dean huffs. At least, one angel gets him.
Cas doesn’t outwardly react to his little remark, but his wings twitch nervously again.
“Drag this out another eight years? Spare me, I don’t have that kind of patience.”
“I’m fine, green eyes. If I don’t remember by now, those memories couldn’t have been that important to me,” he reasons.
“If that ends up being the case, I’ll respect your wishes Dean, but please, give Linda a chance,” Cas says, ever the supportive boyfriend.
Of course, it’s not true. Cas has always been father material. Somehow, even though he was indirectly responsible for Jimmy’s death, he still ended up being Claire’s favorite dad. Dean, on the other hand, let Sam kill his own daughter.
He probably has on multiple occasions.
The last line echoes in his head, haunting him. Were they ever friends? Was he just someone that had caused this man pain? He starts seeing his last meeting with Dean a lot differently.
“Without Sammy, Jack would have been screwed, and you know it.”
“You’re avoiding the question.”
“Call me crazy, but if he’s flaunting his wings and singing Queen in front of a bunch of normies, he’s nowhere near sane.”
His face is unreadable, but his lifeless looking wings dragging on the ground carelessly tell him everything.
Give the Devil his Due
"I just think its a shame that his palette is so limited. There's plenty of good food out there that isn't a piece of meat slapped between two buns."
Dean instantly pales when he can’t readily dismiss the devil’s claims. Chuck was a pulp fiction writer at heart and so not above using those tropes to make the angel stick by him.
“Thank you Dean. I have one more question.”
“Last time I let him baby sit, he took Charlie on a case and sent me a picture of my baby eating Dan’s pudding.”
Cas is adorably exasperated, but his expression darkens into something akin to desire when he willingly falls to his knees. He hesitantly strokes his cheek, clearly tempted. Never let it be said he doesn’t know what his angel likes.
The devil is supposed to be a sweet talker, right? Maybe, Cas got suckered by Lucifer’s innocent act. It’s not like the devil can’t be likable. There had been times where he’d convinced himself Casifer was his Cas simply because he knew just what buttons to push, where to plant seeds of doubt, when to play up sympathy. It had been the devil who gave himself away, or the charade could have lasted a hell of a lot longer.
“I’m sorry you went through that Dean. I wasn’t thinking.”
Like Hell, he is.
“One day, receiving my unconditional love will be so natural that you’ll simply accept it, and you won’t cry a river because love will be a constant in your life and not something held back, only said in one’s final hour. ”
“Am- Am I your favorite too?” He’s not sure he wants to hear the answer.
Tcht, like that proves anything, Jack turned out amazing in spite of Dean. Sam was doing all the heavy lifting before Cas miraculously returned to them.
“In his world, my counterpart is female. Charlie and I dated in that universe, and he is quite fond of her. Lucifer was devastated when I ended up marrying someone else,” he admits reluctantly like Dean’s caught him cheating or something.
“Sure Sweetheart, can we go now? I’m ready to board the angel express.”
“Took you twelve years, really? And, he dumped you for pie,” Lucifer says in disbelief.
“I didn’t know you felt that way. If you’re worried about being unable to keep up, I am literally an angel. I can do the heavy lifting if you desire a child.”
Dean feels it in his bones. Two more decades, and he’ll technically be over a hundred. Besides, he seems to do better when someone else is in charge of the kid. He doesn’t count Sammy. That was a fluke he’s never successfully repeated. As for Ben, well, he’s lost his chance with Ben. The little guy is probably better off without him anyway.
He must have been truly awful.
Lucifer catches Cas’s gaze and they share a quick telepathic convo. Suddenly, the guy is over the moon. Dean really hopes babies didn’t come up, because even thinking of the wedding makes him want to find the closest approximation of the Impala he can find and high tail it outta here. Nevermind, he has no way of jumping universes on his own.
Something about the look on his face makes Lucifer stiffen, and the devil ends up feeling the need to justify his actions to him. It’s pretty surreal to see the devil looking sheepish.
“Woah, no need to bare your fangs at me little one. I’m not about to bring kids into this grudge match, well, mostly. Unfortunately, Charlie’s a strategic pawn I can’t ignore,” Michael says, attempting to placate his angel. He just ends up pissing him off instead.
Dean wants to smash something. Everything about this picture is wrong.
“Dean’s not a baby. Maybe, he can’t make someone explode with a snap of his fingers or say what he means, but he tries, dammit,” he shouts, eyes overflowing with cosmic energy.
Lucifer casually takes a sip of his drink and shoots Dean a derisive look. He still has a death grip on his coat. Dean lets him go and returns to his seat, all the while staring down the devil. Cas frowns, concerned by his maybe future boyfriend’s lack of preservation instincts.
The void is far too daunting. He’s not sure he wants to see the other side. Everything he’s ever tried to do for this man has ultimately ended in failure. All Castiel is good for is ripping away pieces of him: his Apple Pie Life, his faith, his trust, and worst of all, his family.
Unfortunately, Lucifer finally picks up, and he loses Cas’s undivided attention. He regrets taking it for granted before.
After he lets Cas go, he gives Dean an appraising look. He tries not to let his anxiety show. It helps that he’s still holding Charlie. Maybe, the guy will go easy on him.
“I love Cas, but a big wedding just isn’t me. I’d end up taking off faster than Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride.”
“It’s like you calling me Cassie. Feels wrong,” Cas explains patiently.
Dean bites his lip, half tempted to push down and let it bleed if only to distract himself. The fact that Cas doesn’t want to introduce him to the devil is painfully obvious. As much as Cas loves him, maybe, he’s finally realized that love isn’t the kind you shout from the rooftops.
“And yours can?”
“Did you let him see your wings? You know what that does to humans,” he scolds, passing Charlie to Linda so he can properly reprimand his little brother.
“Oh hey, Cas, I didn’t think we’d see you again tonight.”
“Cas, I want Cas. I don’t want to live my life without him. I hate it when he leaves me.”
No, it’s the kind where you settled because you didn’t know any better, and it’s too late to take it back.
“N-No, ‘fraid not, we’re buddies. That’s all. Nothing more, nothing less.”
“Oh Jack, how long have we been dating without actually being together?”
“Lucky me. Blessed by an angel,” he says, casually slipping his arm around Cas’s waist.
His gaze hardens, and Dean swears he can feel electricity in the air. There’s yet another agitated wing flick as Cas grabs him by the shoulders, probably just barely holding back the urge to shake him.
Crowley ends up being nothing like he expected. He’s tall and lithe like a snake, and Dean stares a second too long as he bends down to glue a coin to the ground. The demon is all sharp edges and weary glances when he finally notices him. Dean walks over, takes a coin out of his pocket and uses his own glue to add it to Crowley’s collection. He nods in approval, not quite able to hide his surprise even with his thick black shades. He straightens his suit jacket and clears his throat, suddenly nervous. He’s not sure why. If anything, Dean is the one who should be feeling threatened right now.
He smirks, knowing exactly how to play this. All he has to do is keep pushing. Cas will always do what Dean wants in the end. And yeah, that’s probably a topic they should bring up in therapy, but he’s not going to look a gift horse in the mouth.
The devil’s eyes flash red with the promise of Hellfire and torture, and Dean instinctively pulls back. He’s super not over his forty years in Hell, and the reminder kicks his PTSD into overdrive. Suddenly, he wants to be anywhere but here.
“I believe you hurt the simpleton’s feelings when you implied that the time you spent with him didn’t matter to you in the grand scheme of things. Of course, the idiot didn’t bother to explain himself.”
"Do they have burgers?"
They’re both rendered speechless. Lucifer reads the room and makes an executive decision.
“Mine has a doctorate. Yours thinks Assbutt is a good insult,” he snaps back.
“You take that back. Cas was never- I mean they put it in his head that I was a Righteous Man but-” he says, digging himself into a deeper hole.
“He may have casually asked me how attached I was to my male vessel on the off chance we didn’t work out.”
Lucifer raises an eyebrow, intrigued. The first thing he does is offer him a drink. Castiel gladly takes it and downs the thing in one go. He almost wishes it had any effect at all on him.
He’s only half joking.
Dean, that’s not true. You’re-”
“Hey Hellboy, ever heard of calling an ambulance?”
“But?”
It can’t be that easy. He-he did something. Something awful, more than once.
“Dude, what the Hell? He hasn’t even met me. If anything, I should hate him. He’s the devil.”
Can angels heal here? Would Michael do it if he did him a favor? Could Lucifer or did he lose that ability when he got kicked out of Heaven? Should he take the chance?
“Are you sure you wouldn’t like to wait until you are less inebriated?” he asks, knowing full well that there is no stopping his little brother at this point.
“Let’s not forget that the Empty is far from silent despite its weakened state, and from what you’ve told us, it has formed an unhealthy obsession with taking you,” Aziraphale said, mouth forming a grim line.
“Oh, you gonna stick some angel grace in it or something?” he jokes, not expecting him to nod seriously.
Shit. What changed?
Just another form of rebellion for him probably, perhaps, his fondness for his human is greatly exaggerated, more of Lucifer lusting for life than humanity. He’s always been fond of Earth. It was only a matter of time before some of that fondness extended to its inhabitants.
Cas completely misinterprets what Dean is getting at and slaps him on the shoulder.
Cas is super cranky when they get to Linda’s. He was obviously expecting her to say no, but he made the mistake of putting him on the phone, and well, Dean’s a charmer. He’s good at playing a part. She doesn’t know him so it’s not like she has any idea how to tell when something about him is off. Also, he may have casually insinuated that Cas has a tendency to make decisions for the both of them without talking to him first, and well, she wasn’t about to encourage that, was she?
“So what now?” Dean asked when he broke the kiss again. His lips curled up into a teasing smile. “Not that I don’t like this part of Heaven. I can definitely get used to this.”
“Come on, up,” Charlie instructed.
“They would want you to be happy, you know,” Charlie broke the silence when Dean was about halfway through his burger.
“They’re beautiful,” Eileen signed as she spoke. She’d been coming around more often lately. It was still a little awkward between her and Dean. Neither of them wanted to say that it was because seeing each other made them miss Sam, but it was a fact he was pretty sure they both understood. It was odd. He thought a mutual loss would bring them closer, but it seemed that the closer they each had been to Sam, the more it pushed them apart after he was gone.
“At least that’s the last bottle I’ll have to clean up,” Sam said. Dean heard the sigh, but he wasn’t looking at his brother, just using to storm past him and go get another beer. It was early, before noon, and he hadn’t been awake long enough to build up anything stronger than a light buzz, and that wouldn’t get him through the day.
“No.”
Sam frowned, letting go of Dean’s shoulders to drag his chair closer, sitting in front of Dean instead of across the table from him.
“You want to hold him?” Charlie asked. Without waiting for an answer, she knelt down in front fo the stroller and unstrapped the baby, scooping him carefully into her arms. “Make sure you support his head, yeah, like that,” she muttered instructions as she laid him carefully in Dean’s arms. “Hey, lil guy. This is your daddy.”
The day Jack woke up, he disappeared almost immediately, leaving behind Sam and Eileen worried, and Dean cursing under his breath. He had hoped to talk to Jack. To find out if he…If the Empty might like him better than Chuck. If he could do anything to bring Cas back. But he left.
Two breaths.
Jody was the first. It wasn’t even on a hunt. Pneumonia put her in the hospital, and she never pulled back out. “I didn’t want to go out on a hunt,” she’d said as Dean sat by her bedside. Everyone knew, but no one was saying it. The doctors had said they would make her comfortable.
“Right,” Sam said. Dean could hear the disbelief in his tone.
“I didn’t say that,” Charlie cut him off. “We love having you here. That’s not it. I’m just worried that you’re,” she paused, as if uncertain how to finish.
Stevie joined in the conversation when she got home from helping Garth run point from his house on a few simultaneous hunts, and ran through the same questions she’d had when Dean told her he wanted to be an EMT. When she was satisfied that he was doing it for himself, not for Sam, they called the same doctor that had handled Stevie’s pregnancy.
weren’t the same.” He paused, but Dean didn’t know what to say. “So yeah, Dean. I know.”
“She’s losing a lot of blood,” Jonathan’s voice joined him. “Vitals?”
Now though, with Cas in front of him, an Archangel within arm’s reach, he felt further away than ever.
“Okay, but why not enjoy life for a while? It can be beautiful. And we’ll see them again eventually.”
Looking at Cas though, his hands still resting on the angel’s shoulders, he knew he should say something. He had to say something, but no words came out. His smile faded a little, though Cas was still beaming at him.
“Nothing to interrupt,” Dean answered. He coughed to clear his throat and made his way to the fridge for a beer, still unable to catch Sam’s eye.
He felt a hand on the back of his neck, another gripping his arm, tugging, holding him closer as Cas’s lips moved against his.
Two breaths.
“Alright. Well, I got the honor of being the chosen meat suit for the Archangel Michael, in a fight to the death with his brother, Lucifer.” The bowls clanged together loudly when she half set, half dropped them to the table.
“Of course I will, if that’s what you want,” Charlie said, offering a warm smile. “But if it’s just because you think you don’t have a family, then you’re wrong. You do have a family.”
“I’m not. I hate the things,” she said with a laugh.
“Hello, Dean,” he said. The familiar greeting, the familiar voice, broke something, and Dean surged across the empty space between them, nearly knocking them both over as he wrapped his arms around Cas. He vaguely registered Jack’s hand brushing his arm, pressed against Cas’s back for just a moment to help keep Dean from actually knocking them over, then the nephilim stepped out of his line of sight.
Dean hadn’t believed he would do it until he saw the man outside, walking cane from the back of the ambulance in hand and expression livid.
Leave me comments and kudos!! They inspire me to write more <3
“Leave me alone, Sam,” Dean muttered. His voice didn’t sound angry, not anymore. Just tired.
“What?” Sam asked.
“You only just got married a year ago. Are you sure about this?” Dean asked. Charlie and Stevie were sitting on his couch, not an uncommon sight over the last two years since he moved out of their guest room. Dean sat in one of the folding dining chairs that he only pulled out when anyone was coming over.
So many days, it was too much, Dean hadn’t slept, couldn’t sleep, felt like he was losing it. But by the time he watched Samantha walk across the stage at her high school graduation, he wished he could go back and do it all again.
Thirty compressions.
“Biological father,” Charlie cut in quickly. “We would be the parents listed on her birth certificate. You’d have no responsibilities or anything. Promise we won’t ask for child support,” she added in a lighter tone. Dean’s mind was spinning.
Dean hardly noticed when Jack helped Sam clear the table, and Eileen got up to leave with Sam. He barely registered Jack giving Cas another hug before leaving for his room. He did notice the subtle, uncomfortable way Cas shifted a bit once they were alone. He’d been acutely aware of the angel since the moment he got back. Every smile that faded a little into something uncertain when he caught Dean’s eye, every hesitation when he accidentally brushed against Dean’s arm when he reached past him or was speaking with his hands too much.
“No one will go with me on a hunt, and I might be fucked in the head but I’m not going on a hunt alone,” Dean interrupted her. Everyone had apparently been counting on his letter judgment to not go it alone, and stuck to their guns of not letting him join any of them on a hunt. They overestimated his survival instinct. At the same time though, he hadn’t gone out on any solo hunts, mainly because he would feel guilty for leaving Charlie like that if anything did happen to him.
Castiel is sweaty, he lost his jacket somewhere, unbuttoned his shirt. His gaze slides through the crowd. It's not only Dean's – it's their family, their friends. Like a seed that took roots in a good soil, with an abundance of other flowers around it, Castiel has found his place there.
Dean has never seen the northern lights when he was still on Earth. They probably can't compare with this, though.
Miracle runs around, pushing between people's legs, barks when Donna snatches a fallen piece of cake from under his nose.
She wonders when Dean will find out that she made Cas wear his lucky boxers too, yellow and dotted with bees.
He climbs on the hood, Cas following, until they are comfortably perched on the front window, arms touching. Dean's absentmindedly caresses Cas's hair. He pops open a beer bottle; Cas prefers his weird lemonade, so sour it twists his face. Baby's hood radiates warmth; it's been a hot day.
Charlie doesn't mind – it's what she's good at. She would only wish for more light, a sun already setting and only a glow of strings of lights to guide her. At least she's wearing the pantsuit and not a dress, otherwise bending to plug all those cables would be hell.
But it's all different, because, deep down, there is certainty underlying everything else – he is safe here. Nothing threatens the people he loves. He can allow himself a luxury of being with Cas without any worry. Just them, together.
She leads him outside, where everybody is already waiting, heads turning to them. Sun makes its way slowly to the horizon, painting the garden in soft shadows and warm hues.
“Yeah,” Castiel grins.
“Disgustingly sweet, they both are,” he signs to Eileen, pours Eileen more wine.
It takes him a few moments to notice that Cas isn't looking up anymore. His face is turned towards Dean, eyes full of adoration, as if Dean is much more beautiful than the spectacle in the sky. Even after all this time, it still makes him squirm, but the feeling quickly passes.
Miracle pushes between his legs under the table, makes big eyes at him. Sam tries to avert Miracle's gaze, well aware that he will eventually oblige to his wishes. His dress trousers are already dotted with dog's hair.
'You sure? I can stay. I like these moments with you,' Cas says, his hand trailing a path down Dean's arm.
For now, he takes the sight of Cas in, his black, mused hair, a gentle slope of his eyelids. Cas has ditched his coat, his shirt is unbuttoned at the top, showing a patch of skin. Dean is a little hot under his collar, but lets the feeling pass – they will have time for that later.
They part and Dean drives home, the road wide and welcoming. It only takes a moment before the familiar sound of waves leads him home. It's a moderately small, but comfortable wooden house, hidden safely in the arms of the cliffs descending to the beach. He parks Baby in her shed. Miracle waves his tail, welcoming him in the door.
'Amazing. They are expecting a kid, but he doesn't know it yet,' Sam smirks, but his eyes glow with tears.
“Hey, I got that!” Dean says on his side, mouth full of ice-cream.
“Come here, ya idjits,” he grunts, enveloping them both in a crushing hug. “Don't mess this up.”
The sky murmurs of times long past; events that are still yet to come. Cas has once told him that this is a horizon of time. He understands more, now. There are also some things he will never comprehend as a human, even here, no matter how long Cas will take to explain it to him in his calm, raspy voice. He doesn't really need to understand them, he feels them at the core of his being, where his soul shines bright and warm.
'Hey, handsome,' Dean smiles, and kisses him. Cas' lips open under the pressure. He tastes like air just after a storm, soft wind in the high mountains and something alien, but sweet. Cas' hands caress his face and gently tug at his hair. Even with his eyes closed, small spots of light spark under his eyelids, just like after looking too long at the sharp summer sun.
Dean laughs. That's true, though. As much as he likes to believe he wouldn't care, falling in love with Cas would probably be much more terrifying than it already was. He has been so sure he had seen it all, and it's a joy to know how wrong he had been.
Time flies differently in Heaven. It's a cliche, but it's true. It's confusing at times – what for one person lasts for years, for the other can pass in a blink of an eye. Being here is also not a default, bursting happiness as everybody has always painted it to be. More an enveloping peace, as a waveless ocean just seconds after sunset.
Cas stands near Dean, smiling, tie a little crooked. His stance is softer now, his edges gentler, radiating warmth, not much left from the creature that came to them in that barn, made of ice and steel.
“You are both in love, been in love for a long time. Today is just a moment to celebrate that,” she says. Dean smiles, a small smile, unsure, so not his style, but so sincere.
Bobby gulps and grunts, both of them staring expectantly at him.
'Yeah.' Dean says. Sam must've come when he was still transfixed on Cas. Eileen waits nearby, perched up on their car. It's a Toyota Highlander, same as they had on Earth. Big, safe and boring. If somebody asked Dean, it shouldn't have a place in Heaven, but apparently it deserved it. Maybe for driving Sam and Eileen safely through all these years.
As Dean parks Baby in the open field, the rays of the setting sun paint the grass in warm hues. On the horizon the slopes of the hills seamlessly transform into the rigged contours of the higher mountains, their presence solid and ancient.
He corners Cas against the tree, kisses him breathless, thumbs the delicate place under Cas' ear. Cas smells like champagne, earth and sweat and he breathes it in, Cas' fingers twisting into Dean's jacket, holding him close. He pushes his hands under Cas' shirt, lets them roam on the warm, soft skin.
They chat for a while, observing the sky and pointing to the shapes that remind them of something from their previous life. Dean insists that the purple mist that flows above them resembles Baby. Eileen snorts and signs that it looks like a rabbit at best.
Just before sunset, Cas will come home, human form and easy to touch. He will slip under the covers, carefully. If it wakes Dean up, Cas will murmur something sweet in his ear, leaving a trail of open-mouthed kisses on the side of his neck, until Dean stirs awake. He will melt under Cas' touch, reaching clumsily for him, until they are both left breathless.
Cas looks up, his gaze longing and far away. Dean knows that look by now.
After another day of driving for hours with no purpose, Dean has found this place. Cas has instantly fallen in love with it. Apart from that, Dean has shown it only to Sam and Eileen. Heaven is vast, seemingly infinite. They can save a special spot only for themselves. It's perfect for their evening plans – endless sea of grass hidden under the dome of the sky.
'Beautiful,' he says. Castiel hums in response, tugging Dean closer. He kisses Dean's temple. The wind whispers in the tall grass, echoing with thousands of voices.
'Go,' he says.
Castiel stands by the wedding arch, handsome and confident, perfect match for her son. Although not made from stone, as an image of Castiel just an hour ago comes to her, his eyes wide and lost, while Claire and Charlie run around him, smoothing his hair, tying his tie.
Cas longs to fly.
“Mom, I mean, big weddings—” Dean starts, voice nervous. “Not really my style, is it.”
“You don't understand, Charlie, you have to play it exactly from that tape,” he said.
This though, it never gets old.
“Come on, Charlie, I can't wear Star Wars boxers to my fucking wedding,” Dean complained earlier, but obliged when she told him he could, and that he made burgers a main dish.
'Kind of glad we didn't see this on Earth.' Sam says, indicating the sky.
Dean grins at him, teeth showing and laugh lines deepening. It was just yesterday that Dean was a child, following Bobby everywhere, looking up at him with his wide, trusting eyes, the way he didn't look at anybody else. He has grown up, not only in looks, broad shoulders and muscled arms and first wrinkles, but also in that dumb head of his, more at peace now, calmer, happier.
“I love you too,” Cas says, resting his forehead against Dean's. “Always have, always will.”
Dean still feels, of course - sad, angry, happy. The piercing coldness of freshly fallen snow. The burn of Cas' stubble, as Cas leaves a trail of kisses on Dean's neck. The sting of salt in his eyes when he dives in the ocean. The warm rays of the summer sun.
Here, he can hear Cas, and his ears don't bleed. What was once a piercing, terrifying screech, now is a soothing, distant melody, their tone almost like whale songs.
No wonder he has never said anything before.
“Just say it, Bobby.” Dean grins. “I know you want to.”
The stars sparkle, moving gracefully across the dark expanse of the sky, much faster than on Earth. He can never name the constellations, except for the main few – that has always been Sam's domain. This sky isn't similar to the one from back then. Cas has told him that he can see all of the stars in the universe from here.
He puts on the light, just enough to envelop the house in a warm glow pointing him way to the bedroom. The living room is big, with the mixture of plushy chairs and a mismatched coffee table, wide windows overlooking the ocean. Few half-empty beer bottles lie scattered on the floor, from when Harvelles visited them earlier.
His ring shimmers in the soft light, and something warm and bright and too big fills his chest.
They part after a while, stretching comfortably on the hood, the empty bottles thrown somewhere in the grass, forgotten. Dean will collect them when they go back.
Cas takes his hand, leads him away from the crowd, where cicadas chirp in the tall grass and the stars are glinting on the dark sky.
Rowena glides through the floor, offers her hand.
“You are just jealous,” Eileen signs to Sam, smirks. Sam shoves her playfully, but then takes her hand, kisses her on the cheek, admires the way her sleeve slipped, showing the skin of her shoulder.
He reaches for the tray of ridiculous mini-pies that Dean insisted on serving, offers one to Eileen.
She fidgets with the cassette player, console, two laptops and a bunch of cables, twisting almost like a midcentury ladies' braids where they lead to the two columns of speakers. It would be enough to just press play on any device and load the songs from the USB stick, but Cas insisted.
He goes upstairs and hops into bed, shedding his clothes on the worn boards of the floor. The waves lap gently on the shore, their hum blending with the rustle of leaves. Dean falls asleep.
“What about Lucifer?”
“Is something wrong?” he asks, keeping his voice neutral. In his head, he’s already calculating the odds of doting Uncle Lucifer double crossing them.
“Awesome.”
Linda lights up, relieved to have better babysitting options next time she goes out on the town. Cas nods in solidarity, still having a silent staring contest with the kid. His wings casually encircling him and the baby. Dean heart thunders painfully, second guessing his choice not to do the whole baby thing.
Aha! He’s not the only one internally panicking about the possibility of the whole thing getting away from them and becoming a mad circus.
“I understand this ritual is important to Aziraphale. Early in our acquaintanceship I suggested he open a library where the humans would be obligated to return his books so he wouldn’t have to spend so much energy chasing customers away. He looked at me as if I’d asked him to give away all his children.”
“You have ten seconds to explain yourself before I snap your neck.”
“Your memories are coming along nicely.”
"You have no idea."
Despite Lucifer’s obvious disapproval, his wings come out unbidden, fluttering excitedly. His heartbeat quickens, sharing the same sentiment. They want him to come home!
“But I don’t believe anyone is ever truly helpless and doomed to give in to their worst instincts. Everyone is capable of growth and change. You of all people should realize that. ”
Aziraphale crosses his arms, silently pouting.
“Michael framed me.”
“I wasn’t expecting you to be the one to come get me, but I’m glad you did. There’s something we need to discuss, and it might be better to have this particular conversation where Jack can’t eavesdrop.”
He assumes this will be a simple question to answer that might clarify a few other aspects of their relationship he’s unsure of, but Dean blows up as if he’s asked him about the size of his genitals in public.
“Well, Righteous Man, would you like to go to my bedroom and fornicate?”
Cas tilts his head again, honestly confused this time.
“How do you feel about getting a third kid? I know I’d probably screw them up but-”
“Lucy!”
Dean smirks, pleased that his angel has actually been making Crowley miserable all this time as unfair as that sentiment is. Overall, he’d actually given Cas pretty good advice.
“Well, this is a surprise. What brings you to my little corner of the universe, Cassie?”
Dean is gripped by guilt. If all of Cas’s siblings think he’s no good for the angel, even the ones from an entirely different universe, maybe, it’s the truth, and they’re both in denial. He doesn’t say that though. They’ve been through too much for him to accept the devil’s snide comments lying down.
He looks around the eclectic living space and gazes at an old black and white photograph of Aziraphale and Crowley posing outside a destroyed church, a hint of a smile on his face.
The angel’s eyes are all over him, and Dean feels goosebumps.
"Oh look, we're here," Aziraphale says feigning surprise.
“I’m trying to be better about it,” Cas says, echoing Dean’s words as he cautiously returns the hug. He really wishes he wasn’t his angel’s primary role model for how to be human.
"Real mature, Dean."
Dean’s just about had it.
He’s suddenly frustrated. He may be an angel, but the man in front of him is divine, and he doesn’t realize it. He’s more holy than Castiel will ever be.
“I’ll kill him.”
“Okay, the devil currently hates my guts. I can deal with that.”
“ I like the idea. That way the poor kid doesn’t get stuck with me.”
There's comfort in that. He can help as much as he can and send them on their way. No chance of ruining a good thing. The kids won’t ever have to know he’s not as good as they think he is.
"I got to visit Aziraphale and Crowley's cottage in South Downs. I especially liked the garden, reminds me of the first one," he tells him, easily climbing down the creaky stairs.
Dean is suddenly more guarded than before, and Castiel can tell he’s choosing his words carefully.
Dean sighs, a little weary of the fact that every version of God seemed to be some kind of meddler by nature. Damn creative types never know when to leave well enough alone.
Dean laughs at how easily Cas calls out their mutual bullshit. He taught the angel how to love so he can only blame himself for the angel constantly declaring his undying love for him when it’s too late, and he can’t possibly process it.
Dean rolls his eyes. His angel is beyond biased. He stopped being the Righteous Man a long time ago.
Dean scoffs.
Cas possessively clutches his coat, pouting slightly. It’s freaking cute, and he makes a mental note to ask about this Constantine dude later.
“Sure, ready to blow this popsicle stand?”
He’s honestly surprised the devil hasn’t tried to ax him already.
“Am I still an angel in this scenario? If not, how high is the bridge?”
“We’ve both hurt each other. Don’t put this all on yourself. I only brought it up because I think it would be good for us. I trust Linda.”
Dean flinches. He really hates that particular Jedi mind trick. Maybe, he can bring it up in therapy and get him to cut it out.
“Hell no but I’d still like it.”
Awesome, walking to L.A. is impractical, and for some reason, his angel gets particularly twitchy when anyone one other than him or Sam is driving. He was damn lucky he managed to convince him to take an Uber to Linda’s.
Then, Castiel blinks, his anger leaving him. This isn’t the devil he’s mad at.
Cas collects himself, schooling his features before addressing Dean.
Lucifer is left staggering, full of guilt and self loathing. He has no way of reaching Castiel and setting him straight- erm right about what he meant. Even at height of Amenadiel powers, he did not have the strength to hop dimensions. He winces, finally thinking of Mum. They could have used a dimension hopping Angel to get her somewhere safe. He sighs, dismissing it. No sense crying over spilled Vodka.
He instantly brightens as his angel unintentionally lays out a battle strategy for them.
“If we don’t go through with the wedding, he’s going to kill me, isn’t he?” he says, only half joking. He’s already gotten a taste of Lucifer’s divine punishment, and he’s not sure cancelling the wedding would be a lesser crime in the devil’s eyes.
That’s not quite true, but surprisingly, Dean doesn’t push. He swallows nervously, staring down at his hands securely holding onto Cas’s arms as if he’s afraid he’ll vanish with a flutter of wings.
“Geez, and I thought Chuck’s writing was heavy handed.”
The ‘And you’ is implied, but he’s too full of rage to completely back down. Sure, Dean isn’t perfect, but what gives Lucifer the right to actively sabotage them? He’s paranoid enough as it is without Lucifer slowly building up a little black book for Cas to look through the moment Dean makes a mistake.
“That doesn’t seem that bad,” Dean says with a shrug. He’s about the right age to start eating solid foods. So, it doesn’t strike him as particularly irresponsible outside of the initial pudding theft of someone who he assumes is a friend/frenemy of the devil anyway.
“Okay, you can stop.”
Dean raises an eyebrow. Apparently, they dine here so often that their three month absence was noticed. Aziraphale mutters something about miracles coming in handy. Crowley, on the other hand, keeps glaring at him which if quite a feat considering he's wearing his sunglasses indoors.
He wants to cry as a tumult of emotions pour through him. Unfortunately, he remembers the man in front of him is not fond of Chick Flick Moments, and since he is not currently dying, it is probably best to keep his feelings to himself.
The devil does the Picard facepalm, and Dean has to hold back a belly laugh. His angel loves him, and Lucifer can’t stand it.
“Just what the Hell have you been teaching my angel?”
Crowley never looks away from Dean which is kind of funny because he puts enough effort into being human that he makes a show of holding up a menu. There's a part of him that wants to edge him on when the server addresses him.
“Shut up or I take back my forgiveness,” he mutters when he finally breaks the kiss.
“Yes, we are for now,” Lucifer says with fake cheer.
“Yeah well, he’s not an angel we’ve come across is all,” he says with a shrug.
Dean looks so hopelessly fond for a moment that Cas wonders how he ever thought he was capable of leaving this man.
“How else am I going to get the devil off my back?” he complains.
“Obviously, we need to show the devil I’m in this for the long haul. So, give me some intel. What has the devil been whispering in your ear that has you dead set against me meeting him?”
Castiel reveals his dark shimmering wings and disappears with a whoosh, and Lucifer decides he is not drunk enough for the day he's had. When Amenadiel finds a black feather in the morning and asks if Cassie has stopped by, he can honestly answer yes as long as his brother doesn't pry further. Thankfully, he doesn't. The Detective would call it a lie by omission, but he doesn't believe in those. Besides, he would let Amenadiel in on their little brother’s interdimensional love life once Castiel reunites with his Righteous Man, and he gets all the juicy details. Something tells him that his brother’s next visit won't take nearly as long as the last.
"What makes you think so?" he asks.
Castiel smiles, resisting the urge to flirt. The man is actually pouting. Perhaps, he’s drunker than he thought.
He comes off way more accusatory than he intended, but this is definitely the other shoe dropping. The reason this classy devil has his angel acting distant.
“Get out.”
“How cute, you’re little mud monkey thinks he can take me.”
A strange devilish aura surrounds Cas then as he smiles wickedly at Crowley, but it disappears when he turns back to Dean, the picture of innocence.
Dean grunts in response too fixated on staring Cas down to even try to be charming.
“What can I say, I’m fond of you, and Dean is growing on me.”
In which Lucifer is staunchly Team Prophet and Castiel is strictly Team Righteous Man even if he doesn't remember why
“Amen-who?”
Of course, Cas wants to believe his brother is good. Hadn’t he put up with soulless Sam for a year? It’s his job to be suspicious enough for the both of them.
“It was wrong of me not to mention them to you, for you to find out this way. I promise when you meet Lucifer and Amenadiel that it will be under more pleasant circumstances.”
“That’s not what I’m worried about. I know this is important to you, but in your current state, I can’t in good conscience take you to see our future therapist, even for a simple social visit. What if you end up blurting out something you’re not ready to talk about?
Nevermind, they’d both fit into the category before. Dean’s getting too old to keep mourning like a widow every time the angel up and dies on him.
Dean hates that he’s not actually sure if he’s talking about him, even if it looks freaking obvious on the surface. He can’t be that lucky. He’s just some guy and Cas is-
The archangel that brought them here won’t be back until morning so they have some time to kill. Before they can duck out of Lux for the night, the bartender lets them know that drinks are on the house if the brothers want to stick around. As much as Dean wants to get as far away from this place as possible, he longs for the taste of alcohol more.
It should, but instead, he starts wondering if his angel had slipped away from him at some point and had a hot girl summer with this Diana chick, not like it would be the first time.
Slow your roll Dean, you’re getting sidetracked. The angel isn’t leaving you, even though he should. For some reason, you’re it for him.
About time someone noticed his suffering.
“Why doesn’t Cas have his angel mojo? What’d you do to him?” he shouts at Michael.
“I am,” he insists.
He gives him a quick pat and turns serious.
Cas places a hand on his shoulder, the one that used to bear his mark, and he automatically relaxes. At least, he knows it's not Lucifer messing with him if nothing else.
Coincidentally, he’s finally noticed that Sam was gracious enough to disappear into the crowd for a while. It makes him feel all the worse for ignoring him in the first place.
Good riddance.
“Nice to meet a kindred spirit.”
Cas’s humongous wings appear and rise up in challenge, practically eclipsing him without really having to try. It takes all his willpower not to fall to his knees.
Cas is unphased. He gives him a long speech like he’s been expecting this. Then again, considering he pulled out a beautiful confession out of nowhere before the empty took him, it might just be the way Cas talks.
Cas can’t argue with that logic so he lets it go.
Cas nods, annoyingly understanding of Dean’s reservations. He feels a twinge of irritation, wondering if this is something he’s run by Crowley too. He tries not to let it get to him, reminding himself that he and Aziraphale are a thing, a six thousand year thing apparently.
“Why? Thought I wasn’t worth remembering,” Dean says, obviously bitter.
“It’s not that. I’m just surprised he’s as coherent as he is,” Amenadiel says, silently examining him for traces of angel cooties or whatever grace is here.
“You reek of fear, my little adoptive brother was merely trying to spare your feelings.”
His past is certainly ready to abandon him.
“Who says I’m not?” Dean says playfully, not sure what she expected. He’s not going to paw at Cas when he’s busy visiting his nephew.
“No, I don’t, but you do, and it drives me insane,” he says, wings slumping in defeat.
Dean really doesn’t.  As long as his angel is with him, nothing else matters. He hasn’t dared admit that to himself before, but the angel brain rot makes everything easy.
“Wait, you’re not just going to leave me here, are you?”
Lucifer arches an eyebrow and smirks.
Castiel is more than a little drunk and stumbles as he turns to face him, strangely offended.
The man’s face softens for a moment.
“That’s actually a lunch fork. A dinner fork is a fair bit larger,” Aziraphale says, coming up from behind Crowley.
“I might never be ready Cas. Earth wasn’t a picnic for me, and I’d rather stay in Heaven where you’re safe. I don’t ever want to lose you again, and like Hell, we’re going back to, I have angel business to attend to, see you in six months.”
Right now, it’s just damn inconvenient.
“Tomorrow, maybe,” he says, deliberately keeping his options open.
“So, we are friends?”
Something flashes in Dean’s eyes that he can’t quite decipher before it’s gone.
“Great, now, I can impress you with my fork knowledge.”
“You’re taking this better than I expected.”
“You’re the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen. Please don’t hide from me.”
“All Cas needs is distance from you to heal himself.”
“Well, I remember that I love you . . . and bees, possibly cats,” Cas goes on, trying to relieve the tension by undercutting the confession.
“You're welcome to stay as long as you like, honeybee,” Aziraphale says, briefly placing a hand on his shoulder to reassure him he’s welcome before zeroing in on a patron who is intent on buying a rare book.
“Change of plans, Dean, we’re staying with Lucifer until you feel more like yourself. ”
It works. Dean scowls, looking almost disappointed by the botched confession.
“That is correct, and we can still go meet our nephew. I enjoy seeing you interact with children,” Cas says, smiling softly.
“Well, if it helps, so, am I. We’ve both been keeping secrets for far too long,” he says, choosing to keep his words vague. He doesn't want to burden his little brother with his soap opera of a life, not when he has a Righteous Man to sweep off his feet.
“So, you gonna say yes or what?”
Dean seems to be in a much better mood now that they’ve talked things out. He throws a grin his way.
“No, you wouldn’t have,” he says with such certainty that he’s mildly insulted.
“Very well, but before we go, you should be aware that Lucifer and Michael are currently fighting.”
His angel is pacing back and forth, waiting for the devil to answer his phone. He doesn’t see why. Dean is awesome and pumped for therapy. He wishes Cas would chill and join him for coffee. Instead, he answers his goofy grin with an unsure smile.
“Of course you did, I’m a delight,” he snaps back.
"Uh, what's he talking about Cas?"
“Hold up, I didn’t give you permission to fuck off.”
When he’d disappeared from the crowd, he felt a strange compulsion to seek him out. After chatting with the bartender, he’d discovered that Lucy had invited two men upstairs. His heart jumped, more often than not, that meant Lucifer was trying to set him up with someone he found suitable. For some odd reason, he felt butterflies in his stomach when he discovered the guy he had his eye on was someone the devil approved of. He had a sneaking suspicion that life before Lucifer had been hard and that his angel family rarely approved of anything he did.
More fractured memories break through the void. They’re just as painful as the last one that managed to slip out. Maybe, the giant abyss is meant to shelter him from his dismal past. He wishes walls weren’t so easy to break. In some ways, this feels like karmic retribution.
It’s explanation enough. Lucifer’s face falls, wings drooping. He might as well be a kicked puppy.
Cas takes the opportunity to slice at his kneecaps. Michael doubles over in pain, cursing more than he’s ever heard an angel curse.
“What’s your point, Sunshine? Because it kind of seems to me you packed a suitcase and split without Jack.”
The warm expression on Lucifer’s face grows cold. Castiel has always been far too blunt. Lucifer takes a sip of his drink and looks away as he closes himself off.
