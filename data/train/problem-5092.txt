“Ah,” Tony says dismissively, tossing his head in a lazy nod. Steve gets the feeling he would have flapped a hand at him if his were free. “We’ve all got regrets. Even you, Rocky, perfect as you are.”
The way Steve saw it, the omega was the child-bearer, and thus, they were built to be strong enough to protect a child. The common story went that while the alphas were out fighting their wars, and the betas were the foot soldiers, the omegas stayed safe and pampered at home. But history could easily prove that false; in much of both East and South Asia, in Norway, in indigenous American communities, omegas had long been known to be ferocious fighters. Omega bushi in Kamakura Japan, the omega
“Oh,” Tony says. He sucks in a startled breath. “Oh, wait, that’s actually a marvellous idea, Friday-”
Remember to check the warnings if you need those because this is the chapter where they're relevant.
Hill doesn’t say anything, which is answer enough. Behind him, he can hear the patter of footsteps, and he turns and raises a repulsor, only to lower it when a familiar head of blonde hair peeks over the top of the stairs. Steve’s expression is determined, blood on his fists, and Tony reaches a hand out to him.
“I’ll introduce you sometime,” Steve tells him, laughing quietly. Bruce will either take pity on the kid or eat him alive, but either has to be better than sitting around waiting for Tony to remember that he’s rich and has a personal driver. Tony barely goes out for fun these days, anyway; he’s always working. Steve would be more worried if this didn’t follow Tony’s usual track record. He’d spent enough time on Google to know that Tony frequently disappeared from the social scene for weeks or months at a time, only to inevitably reappear with a scandal that splashed across every gossip rag from New York to Morocco.
“No,” Steve says frantically. He holds up his hands, his head shaking back and forth. His eyes are wide and earnest. “No, no, you’ve- you’ve got it all wrong-”
“You can’t tell me you’ve been acting like yourself,” Tony snaps, and Steve flinches as though he’s been struck.
“He’s…out, right now. He’s taking care of an issue I had with the U.N. taskforce.” Tony laughs hollowly. “I sent him on a mission.”
“Nope.” He holds up his coffee mug, gestures towards the coffee maker. “I’ve got it. You can go back to…whatever it is that you were doing.” He glances around Steve’s broad shoulders and into the living room, where the TV above the fireplace is set to TCM. John Wayne is riding a horse. At the very least, Steve is relatively predictable.
Steve turns his head to see Charles Xavier approaching in his infamous wheelchair. He holds a hand out.
You’ll notice that the chapter tally has jumped again. Sorry about that! It’s taking longer to get through these big plot points than I thought it would. I may have overstepped myself and gotten kinda crazy with how many plates I’ve got in the air in this fic, so it’s definitely gonna be longer. Hopefully that pleases some people? I mean, that means more story? Right? >___>”
“Fuck you, too, buddy,” Clint snarled, and Steve burst out laughing. Tony tilted his head back with a bright grin, and Steve couldn’t help but lean over the back of the couch and kiss him. It was strange, kissing Tony upside down, but kind of nice, too. It made it easier to slide their tongues together, to taste the garlic and red pepper flakes on Tony’s breath, to slide his hands over Tony’s chest and neck and feel him purring.
“The cigarettes here taste better than in America,” Thor said finally, because he’d try anything anyone gifted him. It was an Asgardian custom, something about refusing offerings as the son of Odin, and honour, and a duty to the people. “You cannot get this Midgardian disease, cancer, yes? You should try them. I have many kinds.”
Tony rolls his eyes. Then he glances down at his shoes, frowning. “These are really the worst to do this in,” he mutters. He leans down, ostensibly to fix one of the laces which has gone a little loose.
Bruce’s hands still on his skin. They’re warm and wide. “You know, I always planned to leave, eventually. I can’t stay here.”
“I cannot contract human diseases,” Loki points out, and Tony considers this for a moment. “You have my word.”
He’s going to build an army. He’s going to make JARVIS a god. He’s going to put a suit of armour around the world. He’s going to protect his stupid, self-sacrificing soulmate from himself. He’s going to save everyone.
Sam laughs. “You’ve got a weekly date night set and you still can’t manage to talk to each other or admit your feelings. Unbelievable.” He shakes his head. “If you ask me, Stark’s an asshole. I don’t understand it, but if you want something you’ve gotta work for it. That’s always how it is.”
Tony shrugs, shivering a little when Steve’s fingers slip under his shirt to reach the dip of his spine. He can feel Steve smile against his throat. “I did think about it, is the thing. But I was busy, so I kind of brushed it off. I should have said something earlier.”
owe us your lives.” He opens the StarkPad up again, swiping his finger over the screen to find what he’s looking for. “Second, I’d like to remind everyone of this incident, which we are
If he could feel his heartbeat, he knows it would be thundering a mile a minute. Instead, all he can hear is the faint whine of servos as Tony leans down, still mostly covered by the suit. He hears the clank as Tony braces a hand on the metal side of the chamber, and then his breath, coming closer. Closer.
S O M E T I M E S I F E E L L I K E W E A R E O N E, Steve tells him, and Tony pauses with his hands in a hologram, his eyes blinking in that way that says: processing, please hold.
The man shoots Steve in the chest, and pain blossoms out into a bright flower. It burns everything in its path, crackling out from the core of him until it consumes him from the inside out.
The weird thing, Tony explains when Steve is able to stop him long enough to tap the question out, is that Tony’s brain is exhibiting some unusual symptoms of stress that both he and Reed recognise. Apparently, Tony’s body is reacting the same way it used to when he pushed Extremis to its farthest limits. Of course, Tony hasn’t been able to actively engage with Extremis in a very long time. Sure, his healing factor is a little better than the average baseline human, and he’s more spry than many men his age. But he hasn’t been able to control it the way he used to since before he wiped his brain and kind of maybe died. So there’s no reason for it to be taxing his system.
“Four flusher,” he muttered, taking the kit from Rogers’ hands and putting it back up on the shelf. “Take off your wet britches, Sheriff, and get your arse into bed. Ain’t nothing I haven’t seen.”
“Take a picture, last longer,” Steve sasses him. The retort is somewhat defeated by the fact that he’s so deep under that he can barely form words, but Tony considers it. He leans over Steve and reaches for his belt pouch, fingers fumbling in the pocket where he knows Steve keeps his phone.
“That I do,” Tony agrees, wiping at his face. He strikes a pose, seductive and eye-batting and intentionally ridiculous. It spurs a mocking smile in Loki that he counts as a win. “How do I look?”
“Thor is truly gone from Midgard?” Amora asks, looking disappointed. “And his fortress and shieldbrother are protected by Loki.”
Tony shakes his head. “Howard didn’t push treatment on me, believe it or not,” he says. “He wanted me to be an alpha. The only treatment any doctor would have given me would have made me more omega. He wanted me to pass as an alpha, but I didn’t want that. I felt…I just wanted to opt-out. D, none of the above. So I got cortisone supplements from a discrete, progressive doctor, and I joined the anti-dynamic movement.” He shrugs. “I was really lucky. My parents supported me, even if it was for the wrong reasons. And we were connected. But that’s not at all the case for most intersex people. If I’d been a female omega, they probably would have done surgery on me without my consent. Sometimes doctors don’t even tell the parents. They just operate on babies, make ‘em look ‘normal’ by a fucked standard. Better for everyone to spare them the
Steve stared at him for a long moment. He felt himself settling, the piece in him that had been humming in panic since he’d been woken up by JARVIS’ firm, worried voice that morning slipping down into his stomach like lead.
He does his best to breathe. “The March on Kreischberg would have been impossible, without his help. Howard, when I knew him, was…funny, and curious, and a…just, a good guy, if a bit strange. So it’s hard for me, to imagine him like that. Angry. Bitter.” He chances a tremulous half-smile, self-deprecating and angry. It’s directed inwards. “Violent.”
He sets to sucking a mark to Steve’s neck, knowing it’ll only last a few minutes. He wishes he could leave bruises on him, but he’ll just have to settle for wearing Steve’s.
“Just like we talked about; heavy hitters on frontal assault to draw them out, I slip in and pull Cap out while the wonder twins do their wetwork. Quick and dirty, lady and gentlemen. You know how I like it.”
“It’s complicated to say it wasn’t my choice,” she said, tucking back into her eggs now. She liked them poached over toast so hard it was near-burnt, and Steve watched as she split one down the middle, the yolk seeping slow over the browned bread. “Because at the time, I wanted to be the perfect solider. But we all know, I think, that it’s difficult to say what choice means, when you’re conditioned.”
“Well, because-” Steve sucks in a breath. He puts his spoon his mouth, and for a moment, they both eat in silence while he does his best to get his thoughts together. He gets like this sometimes, Tony’s noticed. Sometimes Steve needs to work something out in his brain before he comes out with something whole and true. It’s the opposite of Tony, who mostly speaks until he figures out what he’s trying to say. Steve would rather clam up and then say it all once, perfectly. He only really gets into trouble when he rushes himself.
“Are you making inappropriate sexual advances on a woman who works in Legal?” Pepper deadpans, and Tony grins brightly at her, then at Joyce.
Tony was building speed now, skimming over the top of the wave and riding the edge before dipping down again, back and forth like the shuttle on a loom. He looked pretty impressive, honestly, and Steve grinned at the knowledge that Tony was most definitely trying to show off for him. Eventually, Tony turned and rode the wave back towards Steve, and Steve laughed and kicked his feet gently in the water where he was straddling his board, leaning over to paddle towards him and meet him in the middle.
“You’re my favourite,” he tells him. It’s an old mantra, but Bruce grins anyway. They look at each other for a moment until Bruce turns, rubbing the back of his neck in embarrassment and heading out the door. “Thanks for the breakfast!”
Clint slides the pie into the oven and then shuts it with a clang that echoes loudly in the empty open space, dusting his hands off over the counter and shoving Tony over with one hip so he can get to the sink. “You’re the genius. Figure it out.”
“The one and only,” he quipped, spurring the horse on. His heart was in his throat. The man had been outside, immobile, for God knew how long in the cold. He pushed Flower to go as fast as she dared in the heavy snow, trusting her to keep on the path and know her way home. He wrapped his hands around Rogers’, tucking them in the space where their thighs nestled together for warmth. He wrapped Miss Jones’ scarf around his neck, too, for extra measure.
He gets his answer pretty quickly. Tony strips off his shirt, normal enough for him when he’s sleeping. But then he steps out of his boxers, entirely naked. He leans over, the dimples above his rear perfect to Steve’s stunned eyes, and rummages in the bedside table. He pulls out a bottle-
“I’m going down to the Tank,” he said. “And honestly, I’m glad Bruce is still sleeping. I need to talk to Tony alone.”
“I wanted to see your face,” Tony said, stroking a gentle thumb over his cheekbone, and Steve could feel himself flush with pleasure.
Tony's head snaps up so fast he bangs his head on the inside of the chest plate. "Shit," he hisses. "Yeah. Put him through."
“Okay,” Steve allows, “he can disagree. But Tony left because they got into a fight, right? So maybe he isn’t thinking so clearly right now.” He gestures vaguely towards Hulk. “If he was, you wouldn’t be here.”
“I’ll take a mission,” Steve says. “Go down to D.C., help Romanov with the STRIKE team or something.” His jaw is tight as a steel trap.
“Well, you have to remember that Gyrich has been linked to known Hydra sympathisers, Dana. I mean, if you want to talk about someone’s personal relationships affecting their policies, then I, well, I have to bring up that Hydra is listed as a neo-Nazi organisation by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and an international terrorist organisation by the U.S. Government, Interpol, and most countries worldwide. What does it mean that Gyrich has been linked to people who are––speaking non-hyperbolically––invested in eugenics, and is espousing anti-enhanced views as a member of the U.S. Government? Even without taking into account that he stands accused of actively furthering Hydra’s agenda, I mean. That’s what this investigation is all about, so of course it’s a transparent PR move on the part of the American government to put McCoy in after Gyrich was pulled out under such embarrassing circumstances.”
“My mistake,” Loki says gravely, his eyes jewel bright in the burgeoning dawn. “I shall endeavour to remember your inscrutability.”
Eventually, he can hear the sounds of Steve packing up. He cracks one eye to find Steve looking at him, an expression of unbearable vulnerability on his face. It’s the first time he’s actually looked as young as he is, and Tony’s heart trips in his chest. For a long moment, they just stare at each other, solemn and helpless. Then Steve clears his throat, and looks away.
“It is good to see him up and flying!” Thor called, and Steve nodded. He hooked a thumb at the balcony door.
Afterwards, Steve will go back over every single moment between him and Tony—especially the weeks of quiet stalking before they met that Tony doesn’t know about and Steve hopes he never will—and think,
“Hey,” Clint says, raising his hands, “can you make explosive acid arrows and fund our entire operation? Because if so, you’ve been holding out on me, man. Bro code red card.”
“This is what has you so preoccupied,” Thor said, slow, as though he was working something out for himself. “It is not that Tony is missing, it is whatever you and Bruce are afraid of happening.”
“I wanted you,” Loki says simply, as though it is that easy. Tony traces his face, but Loki seems sincere enough. “I found the information was easily accessible once I had you beneath me, but it wasn’t my aim.”
He puts himself through a rinse once he’s sure he’s rid himself of blood, running his hands over his skin to check for any remaining tackiness. Then he realises he’s stalling, trying to avoid getting out of the shower with Loki still sitting on the counter.
Steve gets the feeling that Evan would blush if he could. He dips his head and shakes out a no, then opens up the car door without meeting Steve’s eyes.
“I don’t think so,” Tony says impatiently. “Look, I’m headed home, but.” He hesitates, awkward. He claps a hand to Peter’s shoulder. “Thanks for trying.”
In the end, Pepper never went back to the mansion. She’d developed what he would probably best categorise as a wary amusement towards Loki, like the way tourists looked at the tigers licking ineffectively at blood ice blocks behind thick glass at The Bronx Zoo. Loki had never stopped sleeping in his bed, and he and Steve had gone back to their regularly scheduled programming of sparring and light banter, although the UST was getting so thick Tony was pretty sure it was starting to register on JARVIS’ atmospheric controls. Steve’s first appointment was on Friday, and Tony had been putting off talking to Loki about it because he had no idea what the hell to say to him. Instead they’d just all continued on like life was normal, aside from the influx of Superbad left over from the Pleasant Hill outbreak. On Monday, Natasha and a handful of SHIELD agents had shut down a hostage situation of Marx Brothers proportions; two men, calling themselves The Brothers Grimm, had taken Del Posto in Chelsea. Something about magically being able to conjure weapons made from fairy tales. One of them had thrown an honest to god pie at Natasha, and apparently a horde of blackbirds had flown out and tried to peck her in the eyes. Thank god magic birds still died from bullets.
“The depths of your depravity amaze me every time,” Tony said, shaking his head. “Come on, stud, let’s go. Maybe if you’re good we can have another round in the shower.”
“I know it’s crazy,” Tony growls, frustrated. He turns off the shower abruptly, and Steve turns away before Tony can step out and. Well.
“Good old Ulrich,” Tony says, shaking his head. He takes a slow breath, rubbing a hand over his mouth in thought. “This is a double-edged sword. Before, this was relatively quiet. No one pays attention to the UN mandates. Loki’s forcing my hand. I’m gonna have to talk to the team about this, if it’s running on Fox News.”
He’s painfully young, and handsome, in a good southern boy kind of way. His hair is cropped close to his head, high and tight. His dark eyes are creased ever so slightly, older than the rest of him. He’s got some of the smoothest skin Steve’s ever seen, gleaming a rich warm brown in the setting sun. Steve would guess he’s a beta.
“When SHEILD said they needed my tech for prison safety, I didn’t think this was where it was going,” Tony says, tossing his copy of the folder they’ve all been given onto the conference table. In retrospect, he isn’t sure why he’s surprised, but he’s definitely pissed. “You double cross me, and then you wanna cry foul when you muck it up? That’s not how this works, boys.”
He’s tried to stay on the other side of the door when Tony’s in the bathroom, but the jacuzzi tub is too far from the door. Steve’s been dreading the day that Tony uses it, because then there will be nowhere to go. He’ll just have to stand there, and watch Tony, and he can imagine it, can’t he? Tony easing in with a soft groan to lie back in the hot water, his olive skin dotted with moisture and-
“Are you ready?” Tony called, grinning, and Steve took a deep breath as Tony raised a remote and a projection appeared on the wall behind him and Pepper. A series of eight zeros flickered, flashed, and then they were cycling, random numbers appearing and disappearing until they stopped on an unlikely combination: 00000007.
! You classy British fucker.” He grins wolfishly. “Nah, let the investors see it. They like knowing my tech keeps me safe despite all the supercharged baddies I face.” He winks at the assembled party. “Let’s just tell them it was a goddess and not Captain America that got me, alright?”
“Are you…are you serious right now?” he asked, genuinely baffled. “You really want me to make you breakfast. Right now.”
They hadn’t done much kissing, the first time. It had been a rough, gasping thing: quick and dirty, without anything approaching words. He remembered the feeling of Rogers above him, panting, one hand flat on the ground beside Tony’s head as he ground his hips down. Towards the end, Rogers had groaned into his mouth, lips brushing as they both worked towards a frantic conclusion, but Tony wouldn’t really call that a proper kiss.
“That’s alright,” Steve said, turning back to his drawing. “It’s Tony’s blue. I’m happy to wear it.”
Something must flick over his face, because Beth turns back to him with a searching expression. “Did you…do that by accident?” she says, and Tony lets out a rough breath because
“The issue I think you’re having is that you feel you haven’t done right by your soulmate. And that’s quite an egregious sin. But let me ask you this: have you talked to him? Have you told him how you feel?”
"Stark has generously offered up his own home to house the team. He's got the best head for strategy after me." He turned, sparing an apologetic glance for Romanov. "You are excellent at what you do, and that is not full frontal warfare. We're not looking to form a black ops team. We want to be above reproach.”
As he made his way down deeper into the earth, the siren cut out suddenly, emitting a loud whine that made Steve’s ears ache before a soft clicking sound could be heard, then a voice.
Natasha blinked at him, slanted her eyes towards Steve, then nodded once. She stepped back into the elevator without a word. The doors slid closed with a quiet swish, and then the two omegas were alone.
“We will find him. Tony is stubborn, and smart, and unstoppable when he sets his mind to something. Tony will be fine.”
“You were bleeding and you didn’t tell anyone,” Rhoday says flatly, waving a screwdriver at him. “Why am I not surprised.”
He sat with that knowledge for a long minute, wondering how much Tony must have told him about their relationship. If Bruce was the one monitoring him, there were certain things that doctors had to ask of their patients. Steve didn’t want to think about what that might mean, so instead he stiffened his spine and turned back to the conference table, glancing over the scattered bits of data they’d been sifting through in the last few days to try to pick up Tony’s trail. He focussed on the image of Tony standing in his boxers on a cold street in Cambridge, arms spread to present himself as the biggest target, to block the terrified students behind him from harm.
"It would seem Mr. Laufeyson is a bit more corporeal now, sir. I silenced the intruder alert, unless he is unwelcome?"
“That’s not true,” Tony panted. He was lying on his back, exhausted. The ache in his belly was nearly unbearable, but he didn’t quite have the strength to do anything but lie there with the knotting dildo inside of him and pray for relief. “What about that time in Dubai?”
“I can!” Pepper snaps, nothing but steel in her spine, and Steve takes a breath. He is panting, slightly, Pepper’s nostrils flaring in response as she tries to calm herself. “It’s simple math. You wish Tony was some sort of wild, off-the-handle, uncontrollable idiot savant because you want to be the leash. His leash. The world wishes that were true, because the alternative is this: Tony really is that much smarter than everyone, and his futurist brain is always thinking sixteen steps ahead of the next big thing, and he seems wild because he is responding to things that no one else can see yet. It is more terrifying to think that Tony Stark doesn’t need an external compass, or that
“No dying allowed,” is a thing my partner often says to me when I hyperbolically claim that I am about to die (i.e. when sick, or swamped with work.) I think it’s adorable, and so I included it.
“I’ve been lying to you,” Steve said, and saying it felt like someone had slashed a knife through his lungs, all the air whistling out of him in a rush. “I knew. I’ve known for a long time.”
“Steve?” Tony said, sounding baffled, but there was something else there, too. He sounded hopeful, almost, and Steve grinned as he reached the side of the platform. He jumped and grabbed onto the railing to thunderous applause, instead of trying to work his way through another fifteen feet of crowd to reach the stairs. When he’d swung himself over the side, Pepper and Tony were both gawking at him, the former looking a little charmed while the latter looked mostly like he was caught between flight and fight. His eyes were wide and wild in his face, almost amber in the force of the lights trained on him.
“I can’t leave him out there,” Tony said, stubborn. Cage nodded. “I can do this.” To Cage’s credit, he said nothing about Tony’s manic ramblings. “Okay. If Steve had made it to one of these buildings in the past two days, his deputy would have had word already. And I reckon Wilson has already got a plan for if he comes in, yeah?”
Tony grumbles, stretching his arms over his head in a stretch. “I always forget she can sleep with her eyes open.”
“You really, really wanted a drink,” Steve says, and Tony sketches out something that barely resembles a laugh.
“Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do,” JARVIS intones drolly, and Tony shakes a finger at the nearest security camera.
“Tony,” Steve gasps, nails curling deliciously against the nape of Tony’s neck, and Tony runs his tongue around the shell of Steve’s ear.
Before Bruce could take one of the pastries in question, the lights dimmed. A voice came over the speakers, one that Steve recognised from repeated exposure as the lead singer of AC/DC. As the song played, the crowd shuffled upstairs towards the space shuttle, everyone packing in tight. Tony would be making the raffle announcement up there, mostly to give the main act time and space to breathe during set up on the main floor.
“Do you?” Tony asks, mildly curious. It’s an act, but Maria lets him get away with it. It’s the closest thing she has to kindness. “Were you there?”
“Okay,” he manages. It’s quiet, almost a whisper, but he knows Steve can hear it. He swallows. He turns back to his work, blindly. He can barely see the tools in front of him. He’s in no fit state to solder. “Cool. Good talk.”
He takes a very long shower, letting the steam open his pores for a proper cleaning as the hot water beats down on his tense shoulders. He has JARVIS put on ZZ Top and swings with it, running the bar over his arms as the shrill guitar wails over him, through him. A shadow moves in the corner of his eye, but when he swipes the heat film from the glass it’s just him and his blurry reflection, alone in the bathroom. The skin under his eyes is bruised and sagging.
Tony blinks against the rising light as the windows lose their opacity, reaching an instinctive arm out only to encounter an empty bed. “Loki not back yet?”
“Yeah, yeah,” Steve says, straightening up. The look he graces Tony with is fond, and he leans in for a kiss even as Tony tilts his head up. His lips are slightly chapped, still caked with dried blood, but it’s sweet all the same. The slow slide of his fingertips in the groove of Tony’s spine makes him arch up onto his toes a bit, and Steve grins into the kiss. His eyes are bright and gleaming when he pulls back. “Can I ask you something?”
“We didn’t kill him on American soil,” Loki says glibly, and Tony sucks in a breath. It makes him seem much taller than he is, even from behind.
“Go on,” Steve says, and Tony takes a breath. He stretches up to kiss Steve on the mouth, their lips sliding together with a slick sound that makes Tony moan into it, hips kicking forward involuntarily, and then they’re off. Steve pushes back against him, writhing in his lap, and Tony sets a brutal pace, tilting Steve’s hips up, shifting one leg over his shoulder, until-
“Okay,” Tony says, rolling his sleeves up. He leans down to untie his shoes. “You said please, which is. New. So I’m gonna try not to go all Mel Gibson on you, but you had to know this was going to be a touchy subject, which is I suspect why you’re avoiding eye contact to read…” He pauses, leaning over to glance at the thick and rather moribund book in Loki’s lap. “Is that my old quantum mechanics textbook? Where the hell did you even find that?
“Can you take more?” Tony laughs, then near about swallows his tongue when Steve clenches down hard on his oversensitive ligula.
“Of course,” Tony says hotly, and Steve nods. “Of course it’s not a good enough reason. Everyone wants me dead!”
“Howard didn’t really hit me,” Tony says, even as he processes the implications of what Steve’s saying.
“Since Buck died,” Rogers observed, and both men left that where it was. It was true enough, but neither wanted to talk about why. They didn’t talk about Rogers’ own dip into the bottle, the nightmares, the times Tony had been the one to bundle him into bed. It was impossible to take care of someone like that when you were slewed yourself. “I…I didn’t know that. About your parents.” He swallowed. “It’s a hard holiday for the lonely.”
“Stay,” Steve said instead, reaching a hand up to keep Tony in place as he held him down just under the reactor. He pushed his own pants down with one hand, pulling his cock out and beginning to stroke it roughly while his eyes roamed over Tony’s naked, heaving body.
Tony shrugged, pulling the pot off the stove. He served up two bowls and returned to his spot beside Rogers’ bedside. Rogers’ hands shook when he reached for the spoon, fumbling, and Tony sighed and pushed his hands away.
His tone was dismissive, but it was his eyes that always got to Steve. The real reason that Tony wore sunglasses everywhere was that his eyes were so damn expressive, the last bit of humanity that Howard Stark’s PR professionals hadn’t been able to train out of him. When he was excited and curious they glittered beautifully, deep as polished agate. This, however, Steve wished he saw less often; the quiet, frantic fear of rejection, a bracing for pain that shuttered his eyes, lashes a sooty curtain that made them look almost black. It was a shade of Tony’s expression that he associated strongly with pleasure, and to see it twisted into fear curled a special kind of fury deep in his gut. Sometimes, the part of Steve that had fought what had felt like every bully in New York wished so badly to go back and find Tony’s torturers, to beat them until his knuckles split on their teeth. He wouldn’t, now. He was Captain America, after all. But he wanted to. My god, he wanted to.
“Who says I want to?” Steve replies, grinning. Tony blinks at him, briefly startled. “Now come on, where’s the battle footage?”
“You something her, that’s for sure,” Tony mutters, which startles a laugh out of Bruce. It’s a calculated risk, but that’s all Tony is these days. “I’m being as careful as I can.”
It had been a delight, at first, to be able to touch Tony at all. But the more time passed, the more it became clear that Tony was coming apart at the seams. Steve feels like a man possessed, because even seeing how strung out Tony is cannot stop him from reaching out and touching him. He taps Morse into the back of Tony’s hands. He writes letters into his skin. He can’t keep himself away. He can’t stop touching Tony, now that he can. Now that he knows Tony would want him to, wants him to. Wants Steve, as torn as he might be about it. Steve can touch him in new ways, too, ways he never could before. Ways he’d never even let himself imagine. It’s intoxicating. It makes him wish he could leave a mark: some evidence that Tony isn’t dreaming.
Tony’s looking up at him with a little glimmer in his eye, like he knows something Steve doesn’t. Steve can’t help but grin helplessly down at him.
“Stark, come look at this,” Loki calls, and Tony goes, if only to prevent his mind from doubling back into another death spiral. He thinks of ants, and Pi, and significance. Then he shakes his head at himself.
, and then Steve had been forced to run and get a roll of paper towels because apparently his tears are radioactive. Steve had put a trash bag full of stained green paper towels into a metal container in Bruce’s lab marked with a biohazard symbol. Eventually, full and exhausted, Hulk had fallen asleep.
The expression on Rogers’ face was one of disappointment and resignation. “Is no day sacred to you?”
“Alright,” Maria says, shaking her head. She steps between the two men, and types her login into the computer. “If we’re doing this, we’re doing it. Tony, get ready. This has gotta be quick.”
“Fuck me,” Steve says, voice wrecked, and Tony blinks blearily at him. “Tony, you’re killing me. Do you need me to beg? I’m begging, please-”
“Thor’s out and not picking up,” Tony says, and Steve lets out a breath that’s more growl than anything else.
Tony wishes he’d never gotten out of bed on Monday. “Tell her Thor is in Asgard,” he says snapping on his homing bracelets. He stumbles into his room to pull on a pair of boxers, then out into the hall. “Deploy.”
“I know,” Pepper says, impatient. “That’s what I’ve been telling you. It doesn’t help that we’re harbouring the international poster boy for Most Wanted Megalomaniac.”
“I’m yours,” he murmurs, and Tony blinks as a wave of something overwhelming and warm rises up, surging through him like a storm and leaving him shaking. “Tony.”
"I hate you," Sam says, and Steve laughs outright. "Not everyone can eat pure fat and come out with a waist trimmer than a prepubescent girl. Some people run to stay fit."
Tony rubs at his eyes tiredly, still flinching against the mid-morning light. “One day I’m gonna donate you all to Brooklyn Tech,” he mutters. JARVIS, predictably, ignores this. “I guess I better shower, huh?”
Tony frowns, and Steve cups his face in his hands and presses a kiss to his forehead. He murmurs a soft prayer against the skin there.
“Hulk want burger. Tin Man always eat burger when sad.” He frowns a little, his dark green mouth stretching into a huge downward curve. “Tin Man gone long time. Hulk think Tin Man back now. Tin Man o.k.?”
“I…” Steve tries, then stops. There are so many things wrong with Tony’s assessment he doesn’t even know where to begin. No one can even hear him, which he is, for once, desperately glad of. He feels like he’s coming apart.
“If you find yourself at a loss, I am sure Miss Potts would be overjoyed if you completed some of the paperwork she’s sent you.”
Steve finds that response quite alarming, but he doesn’t think that he should tell JARVIS that. Instead he sets his duffel down and pulls his shield out of its round carrying case, strapping it to his arm.
“That is your personal assessment, Captain,” Xavier says. “I wouldn’t call you naïve. Hope is often a scarce necessity in our dangerous line of work. Sometimes it is all we have.”
Steve could barely breathe with how full his mouth and throat were, but he was prepared for this, and it was so good. His arousal was almost blinding, vision blurring as he tried to concentrate on keeping his jaw as wide as he could get it, protecting Tony from his teeth, the smell of Tony all around him. He wondered idly if he could come untouched, just from this.
Steve, who has thought this more than once since his death, cannot protest this. He and Tony have a lot to talk about when he’s alive again.
He glances over to Beth to check her reaction. She’s pressing the tips of her fingers over her mouth, gaze distant as she tries to parse this new information. She’s good at figuring things like this out, Steve knows. That’s why Tony hired her to be head of Avengers security. It’s one of the reasons why he loves her. Tony’s always loved the smart ones, in all the many shapes and forms that their intelligence can take.
“I was protected, apparently, but why didn’t it hit you?” Tony asks, letting Steve stand up. He watches as he shakes his head side to the side for a moment, brows furrowed.
Steve sat on the edge of the bed, Tony’s shirt in his hand, and wondered not for the first time if he’d been selfish. Because the truth was, Tony hadn’t wanted to bond. Steve had known why, even if Tony hadn’t told him. Tony might have thought him the perfect soldier, but it was Steve who’d gone searching for weapons on the helicarrier when they’d first met. Steve was meddlesome, and he didn’t take no for an answer, and he was kind of an asshole. He was bad at keeping his nose out of things, and he was excellent at keeping secrets. There was a reason Tony called him a cardsharp.
When Steve got back from his run, Bruce and Clint were already up and in the common area. Saturdays tended to be slower in the tower, not necessarily because bad guys took a break on the weekends, but mostly because those of the team that had ever had to abide by a regular work schedule were used to treating the weekends as a time for relaxation. On Saturdays Steve tended to take an extra-long run, Nat slept in, Clint and Thor indulged in Saturday morning cartoons, and Bruce rose late enough in the morning to have his coffee with other humans, skipping his sun salutations. Tony was never on any sort of schedule, and could never be counted to be anywhere he was supposed to be, so weekends didn’t matter to him at all. When Steve had gone to sleep last evening, the bed had been empty. Tony must have crawled in at some godforsaken hour, because when he’d woken up that morning Steve had found Tony curled up on his chest, his usually impeccable facial hair overgrown and messy, grease smeared back over one eyebrow and up behind his ear. It was a familiar sight, but Steve had missed Tony this past week, and he’d spent a guilty half hour in bed just stroking over the strong lines of Tony’s brow, his hair, the warm sweep of bare skin on his shoulders. He’d been tempted to wake Tony, to press kisses to his brow and nose and cheeks until he woke with an adorable scrunched smile. Eventually, he’d disentangled himself and gone for his usual run; he knew Tony needed the sleep.
“What do you want, Tony? If you could move us like pawns, regardless of our wants, what would you do with us?”
“I’m gonna be sick if I watch you put anything else in your face,” he’d claimed, shaking his head. “I’ll be in front of the TV if you need me, Cap.”
“Please, just let me,” Steve says on screen, and the Steve in front of him pauses the video. He doesn’t turn to look at Tony, just sits there, staring at the image of Tony blinking at him, poleaxed in the garage stairwell.
"This is what happens when you break your knee and can't be on the scene," Tony says cheerfully. "They can't wipe their asses without you."
“Don’t be,” Tony says. He sounds almost gleeful, and Steve closes his eyes and resigns himself to what he expects will be a round of merciless teasing. “Good to remember you’re flawed.”
“I’m sure that was his intention,” Natasha murmurs, exchanging a speaking glance with Tony. “So what does he want?”
“Don’t you start with that,” Tony warns him, and Steve laughs. It’s low and throaty, and it makes his muscles clench in a way that makes Tony see stars. “
Soon, the snow would begin to build, crowning the scrub and brush with white, covering the road in a freezing slush. The sheriff had been gone for two days, long enough for the coyotes and the carrion birds to come picking at a man injured and lying in the dirt. This snow would be the last kiss of death on his tired body.
“Steve,” Thor said, sounding tired, and Steve glanced up at him. Thor opened his mouth, visibly debated some platitude, then closed his mouth again. He settled the towel he’d been drying his hair with more firmly around his shoulders, then sat on the bed next to him, putting an arm around Steve’s neck and hooking him in for a hug that seemed more of an attack than a hug. Most of Thor’s hugs were this way, so Steve felt prepared for it. He let himself relax into its familiarity.
“If there’s a second breakfast, can there be a second lunch?” Clint tries, following Bruce out the door. Natasha spares Tony another speaking glance before heading up behind them, and Tony turns around resignedly to face his fate.
“I thought we were gonna play some chess?” he asked, and Tony blinked. He hid his smile against the side of Rogers’ broad chest.
They live together, he and Steve are best friends. They’ve memorized each other’s schedules. And while that’s great for Tony if he wants to make sure he’s not in the kitchen like he always is when Cap bounces in post-jog, flushed and sweating and unfairly gorgeous after having run something close to twenty miles, it also means that Cap knows exactly where to find him.
“Then what do you want?” Bruce prompts him. “This is what I keep asking you, Tony. What do you want? If you could have anything, what would you want?”
The elevator opened up onto Clint’s and Natasha’s floor, and Steve took a deep, calming breath as soon as his Clint’s scent washed over him. Being in an enclosed elevator with Natasha had been stressful. He was able to fight his biology, even more so than the average omega with the help of the serum, but he knew that his endocrine system was wrecked right now. The only reason he wasn’t catatonic or caught in a fugue was the effects of the serum working to regulate his biological processes.
“I know,” he says, simple, and Steve swallows. “When you’re a little more stable, okay? I’m not going anywhere.”
“I see,” Steve says, because he knows Tony. Tony’s favourite things are engineering, caffeine, flying, alcohol, and sex: not necessarily in that order. “I don’t think that’s really how espionage works.”
“JARVIS, what’s Black Swan?” Steve asks, rubbing at the crease between his brows. He can see Tony’s provoking grin projected against the back of his eyelids.
“Why are you being nice about this?” Steve demanded, sitting up and frowning at Tony. “You’re the one who was kidnapped. And I know they hurt you, and you won’t tell me what they did-”
“You’re healing from bond trauma,” Natasha said, watching him, and Steve shrugged. “I started the coffee.”
Once, Steve opened his mouth, and Tony slipped a cold spoon in. Dark, bittersweet chocolate broke over his tongue, and he moaned, opening his eyes to see Tony grinning down at him.
He is deeply, transparently grateful when Bethany Cabe makes an appearance four days in. She takes one look at Tony, passed out diagonally on the workshop cot in all his clothes, and hauls him up with one arm.
Steve presses his palms to his eyes, and it isn’t satisfying at all. He can’t get the pressure he wants. He thought he’d cried himself out last night, but here he is again: crying into his hands, sitting on the floor, while the world goes on without him. Merciless.
He carried the weight of the first suit, the metal fighting him every step of the way. He carried his aching, broken body through the searing desert with a battery strapped to his chest. He carried himself through the snow, limping and half-dead and dissociating, into Harley Keener’s garage. This was nothing.
They sit in silence for a long time. Tony leans up into the front, right through Steve, and pulls a tissue box out from the glove compartment. He dabs ineffectually at his eyes, then checks his reflection in his phone camera. He blows his nose until he can breathe without that horrible, wet gurgle plaguing every breath.
And that’s the million dollar question, isn’t it? Tony reaches a shaking hand out for his drink, curling his fingers around it and taking a long drag. Steve reaches out a tentative hand, placing it on the inside of his wrist just for a second. It’s enough to calm the shaking, and Tony offers him a small, grateful look.
“Now she tells us,” Clint muttered into the coms, presumably off somewhere shooting at things “Classic.”
Steve sits down hard on the kitchen floor, because this is…this is maybe the worst thing that’s happened to him since he’s died. Worse than his funeral, worse than the pain of jumping out of Tony’s window and plummeting 90 stories to the pavement. He feels like he’s been hit in the chest by the Hulk.
“Pancakes seem like an excellent choice for this morning. I believe both Agent Barton and Agent Romanov would appreciate carbohydrates and caffeine.”
“Don’t ask stupid questions,” Loki murmurs, déjà vu sweeping over Tony along with something else he doesn’t want to name, and then he can’t help but lean in and kiss him: sweeter, gentler than he’d meant to, in a way that is so transparent that Tony can almost feel himself flush with embarrassment. He’s always been a little too olive-toned to manage it, but it’s a feeling he hasn’t had since he was a kid.
And all the while, pain is still ripping through his body, the white hot flare of fire flickering through every nerve ending, his entire body sweating with it. It rips him apart from the inside out.
“Step out of the elevator, Captain Rogers,” Pepper says, voice sharper than carbon steel. Steve glances at Tony, then does as requested.
“Tony is in trouble,” Steve snapped, stubborn. He stepped into the shower and eased the plug out, wincing at the soreness, the heavy slush of liquid dripping down his thighs. He couldn’t help the flare of arousal that it caused, the smell of Tony flooding the shower, making him shiver. “
“Tony,” Steve whimpers, and Tony pulls both tentacles away from his cock entirely at the same time that he drives his hectocotylus into Steve, deep and fast and hard as he can, skating right over Steve’s sweet spot every time.
Thor kicks him into the wall, all of the breath punching out of him at once. Clint jumps on top of him and is thrown off almost immediately, Natasha running out of the jet, and Tony is bracing himself for another blow when Thor is literally frozen to the spot, ice blasting him and sending curls of white mist tumbling out into the room like he’s made of dry ice.
Tony flinches bodily. He can’t stop himself from doing it, because the words hurt. So, yeah, maybe he is actually kind of pissed at Steve.
,” Peter says, horrified, and Tony waves a lazy hand at him. It’s completely false, and everything about this is making Steve want to scream.
Steve catches a ball and tosses it to a Japanese teenager in fishnets and cut-offs, bangs swaying heavy over her face. She waves a hand, then nudges the tall, lanky brunet boy next to her with her elbow, muttering something to him under her breath that makes him glance in Steve’s direction. Steve flashes a smile at them, and they duck away.
Steve looks at her, expression one so naked it almost makes Tony uncomfortable to see. Natasha stares back solemnly. “What do you mean?”
Tony rolls hies eyes, a smile escaping him despite himself. “Pepper said the same thing.” He takes a slice of toast and bites into it, sweet butter and warm bread like ambrosia. He scarfs it down with animalistic swiftness, reaching for another almost immediately.
“If you’re asking if you can come inside me,” Steve begins, but Tony just shakes his head. Out of curiosity, he brings the tentacle a little closer to Steve’s face. Steve, filthy,
They cleared the last two rooms with relative ease, although everyone was absolutely exhausted at that point. Steve felt like he was moving on autopilot, limbs hollow and made of lead.
It’ll be easier, without Bruce and Steve around. Tony’s gotten sloppy, letting his guard down because he’s got the world’s two best guard dogs in the world lounging about while he holes himself up and works himself to the bone.
“So tell me, what does it mean that Ambassador McCoy has been tasked with helping to craft these so-called accords in lieu of Ambassador Gyrich?” she says, and Tony drops his bowl of pasta.
The video cut to a different angle, and Steve frowned. He wanted to know what Tony had said to that, unedited, but of course that wasn’t how these things worked.
“Do you really think I would die so easily? Did you not learn your lesson?” Loki’s voice is scathing, and Tony reaches back to jab him in the ribs with an elbow.
Rhodey’s mouth is a thin line, and the knee he brushes against Tony’s shakes a little. Still, he leans forward. “I will tell you right now, and this is no exaggeration; no one else in the world could have done that. But if the Avengers don’t have autonomy, they can’t make split-second decisions, or use what the law might deem “excessive force” as needed against enhanced adversaries, or administer untested aerosolised compounds in civilian spaces, or fly abroad to help with the landslide in Colombia as soon as the news breaks.”
Steve wants to reach out, but he doesn’t know if that’s allowed. He wants nothing more to take Tony’s face into his hands, to kiss him again. He almost wishes he hadn’t done it; now that he knows what it feels like, it’s almost impossible to resist. He settles for nodding like a fool.
warning: a character jumps off a building and does not die, but is a kind of dark sui-ish vibe, so if that's a trigger for you fyi
“Baby,” Tony says, hesitating, but he hasn’t secured Steve’s arms or torso at all. He can’t stop Steve from reaching up and grabbing it, guiding it towards his mouth. He pulls away, but too late: Steve gets his mouth around the tip of the ligula, and the sensation shivers all the way down to Tony’s core. He can feel so
"Testing a theory." Tony yawns a little and picks an apple out of the fruit bowl, taking a bite out of it. "What can I do for you, your incorporealness?"
“Not really,” Tony says, polishing off another oyster. “If I die you get everything, as usual. Love you, sorry. I think that covers the usual speech. We don’t usually get to say goodbye, do we? Thank god.”
“Yes,” Strange says shortly. Steve looks incredibly unhappy, and Tony glances at him, head tilted to the side. “I’ve already looked Cap over, and he’s clear. It seems the curse is focussed entirely on you, so we can leave him here.”
A chill skitters over Tony’s spine at the idea of Hasegawa’s tech in someone else’s hands. “Strucker broke them out, I’m guessing?”
“I think it’s chicken,” Steve said, but did as he was told. Bruce had spent a long time living in Hindu communities, and generally avoided beef when possible. “Yeah, it’s chicken.”
Loki folds into his arms, smaller than Tony thought he could become. He, like all Asgardians, had seemed larger than life during The Battle and the events proceeding it. He was tall, imposing, regal. At first Tony had thought maybe it was the by-product of royalty, but even Thor’s merry band of men-plus-one had a presence to them that was undeniable;
Steve took a breath, watching Tony’s eyes close, his shoulders dropping as he took a slow breath. He turned back, reached for the egg carton.
“I don’t think I can stand-” Tony begins, but Steve keeps a firm hand on his wrists, holding Tony pinned flush against the wall. He pulls Tony’s dusty shop jeans down until they’re pooled around his ankles. The low growl of want that looses from his throat at the sight of Tony mostly naked and hard in front of him is half-feral, and Tony can feel his cock twitch under Steve’s hungry gaze.
Tony takes pity on him, leaning in and pressing a kiss to one of his eyelids. If his mouth comes away wet, neither of them say anything about it. He kisses the other one, then mouths over the tear track below it, following the line to Steve’s mouth. He nips gently at Steve’s upper lip, then dips down, taking his lower lip into his mouth and sucking gently on it in the way that always, inevitably makes Steve whine into the kiss.
“Hey,” Steve says softly, and Tony lifts a hand in greeting. A few tentacles mirror the motion, and Steve’s face brightens with soft delight.
“I’m going to tell you that you ought to sleep, and you’re going to ignore me,” JARVIS predicts, good-naturedly enough.
The balcony overlooked the mountains, and Steve had to admit; it was quite a sight. They were wreathed in fog so thick he could barely see the bases of them, just the ragged peaks floating in the firmament, surrounded by a gleaming blaze of stars. Thor pulled two cigarettes out of a pack covered in the bubbly Georgian font and a box of matches, cupping a hand against the cold wind and lighting his own, then holding the match out for Steve to take part of the flame. He poured them both a generous helping of wine.
“Are you saying a kiss broke the curse?” Steve asks, cutting him off, and Tony opens his mouth, then closes it again.
“No, I didn’t think so.” He makes his way into the room in that strange way of his, almost more like a snake than a man. When he reaches Tony’s side he pauses, always awkward with human emotion, before pulling a chair over and sitting catty corner to him. “What can I do?”
Senator Cochran takes off his glasses, setting them on the table and clearing his throat. “You know I’ve always respected you, Colonel Rhodes, but I strongly believe registration is in the best interests of the country.”
“Look at me?” Tony asks, and Steve does, turning to meet Tony’s eyes head-on. He looks wild-eyed, almost desperate, but he’s also so obviously happy. His eyes are bright, cheeks flushed. “You want everything, huh?”
“50% of the workers on the Erie Canal were of Irish heritage,” Tony says automatically, because he spent way too much time on Google last night. Everyone at the table looks at him. “Um. Can we make an Erie Canal float? Is that weird?”
“I know how to square breathe,” Tony gripes, but follows Loki’s breath anyway. His pulse is thundering in his ears, almost too loud to hear. He feels like he’s going to be sick. “Fuck. You did this on purpose.”
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the fic!! Let me know what you thought. This one was hard to end for me. :<
“Remember to be patient with yourself and others,” the professor says, inclining his head in a slight nod. “Perhaps look into contributing to an exhibition. Volunteer to teach art at a shelter.”
“I’m not sure I understand you,” Steve says, slowly, but Pepper is already shaking her head. She slides her purse on her arm, then steps by him and heads towards the door.
“He says to wait until the bloodwork comes back before any decisions are made. You can all talk options, then.”
,” Natasha hissed, and Clint turned to glare at her. “We don’t ask questions. We complete the mission.”
Steve grins around the mouthful of thigh he’s taken the liberty of helping himself to. It hurts, and Tony tugs at his hair in recompense. “No one offs,” he reminds Tony, and Tony smiles helplessly down at him.
“That wench?” Thor crows, voice incredulous. “I have no more love for Amora than you do for the woman who asked for you to sign her breast after our last fight in Times Square.”
“So, I pissed him off,” Tony says, sipping his coffee and watching Bruce. He raises his eyebrows as Bruce reaches behind him and offers Tony a plate of buttered toast.
“’Tis but a scratch,” she intones, the words deeper and louder than should be possible from a scrap of a girl like Minoru. Tony has the barest moment to laugh, and then the armour is pulling itself back together, metal smoothing out, sheared-off pieces flying towards them from across the battlefield and reassembling before his eyes. The repulsor nodes flicker on, and Tony can hear his comm kick in again—a frantic cacophony of voices from inside the helmet. He winces at that; Cap must be going nuts. He’s pretty sure
Steve’s eyes flicker to the right, down Tony’s body. Tony can’t imagine the sheet is doing much to hide the state of him. “If you’re sure,” he says, and his voice is mostly exhale.
Bruce and Clint find them like that, Tony’s glass of Suntory clutched between his fingers like a lifeline, Steve curled around him protectively. He can only imagine the picture they make, but he’s in bad shape. Even he can admit that he’s fraying, and it’s beginning to show. They’re lucky he isn’t in the middle of a panic attack right now.
“You make people feel special, and important, and worth something, and to find out that any of those things isn’t true, it’s a slap in the face.”
Tony watches him in the mirror, running his toothbrush through the tap. “Amora seemed upset, when you died.”
Don't forget to check the work's endnotes for the spoilery warnings! Please me know if there’s anything you think I should have warned for that I missed. I know this story deals with a lot of shit, and I hope that y’all can find it healing and/or fun instead of hurtful. If at any point you feel I’ve missed the mark, please, please let me know.
The snare of the curse is this: Tony wants to give himself to Steve wholeheartedly. He wants to lie bare and let Steve take him over, wants to be taken, wants to be
Tony smiled, leaning himself ever so slightly into Rogers’ hands. To the average passer-by, nothing was amiss: just another night where the sheriff had to haul the town drunk down the street. The pinkening tips of Rogers’ ears betrayed him.
Tony sits up in bed, asleep to awake in one smooth motion, always reactive in the face of alarm. He scans the room with sand-crusted eyes, then flops onto his back at the sight of a familiar figure standing in the doorway, long-limbed and silent.
Tony swallows thickly. The curse sounds strange in Loki's mouth, formal and dirty all at once. He looks like he knows it, too.
“I believe you’re experiencing angina due to Bond Stress. It's often called Broken Heart Syndrome, although I'm sure you find that term unbearably poetic. Would you like me to call Dr. Banner?”
“Oh, baby,” Tony murmured, mouthing gently at his cheeks and kissing away the wet tracks. “Shh, honey.”
“If I’m remembering correctly,” Tony hums, “giant Pacific octopodes mate for upwards of four hours sometimes.”
maybe. The idea of a full grown man trying to beat a small, scrawny Steve, a tiny scrap of a boy fighting a drunk veteran, twists something in Tony. The back of his neck prickles with fury.
“Go,” he commands, and Steve laughs. “I will end you. I will destroy your credit score. I will program the world so that every speaker-equipped device you pass blares the “Star Spangled Man” on repeat. Loudly.”
“I’m fifteen,” Riri said primly, but with an undercurrent of resignation that said she already knew she had lost the fight.
“I swear,” he says, and Tony freezes, shock coursing through him as surely as if he’d touched his tongue to a battery, “to aid you to my ability in this matter. You have my word. Is that what you wish to hear?”
, costs more than you have ever made in your life by any measure, so get the fuck out of my way because
“Let’s go,” Stephen prompts, opening a portal, and Tony sucks in a slow breath. He lets it out in a rush.
,” Tony groans, and Steve responds in kind. He pulls his mouth away with a slick sound that makes all the hair on Tony’s body stand on end.
“Well,” Natasha hedges, but whatever she’s about to say is cut short by a dead-centre shot to the helmet. The display flickers, and Tony loses the connection.
“Hit me,” Tony said, leaning back in his chair. He’d braced his feet against the desk, tilting back on two legs, and something about the lazy grace of it made Steve want to kiss him. Then again, at this point his libido was on a hair trigger. He wanted Tony all the time, now that the air was clean between them, his whole body shivering at the barest provocation: a drawling word, a sweeping gaze, a quiet hum of appreciation. He felt like he was on the edge of heat, and a part of him wondered if he was. It had been a while, since the last one, and the bond-sickness could be staving it off. Most omegas wouldn’t go into heat if they were sick, a shield built into their biology because a heat used up so much energy, weakening the body and leaving them vulnerable. That was what the alpha was for, to breed them and keep them safe for the duration.
Tony much prefers spending time with Bruce. He’s been examining the Chitauri and trying to understand how their hive-minds link up with their command ships. He’s also spent a fair amount of time on video calls with Jane, talking about whatever it is physicists get excited about in the wake of an intergalactic invasion: Einstein-Rosen Bridges, and unstable wormholes, and lots of things that Tony doesn’t want to talk about because they make his chest feel tight and his head spin. On those days, he goes down to Pepper’s office and lets her drag him around to talk to whatever investor or board member or client most needs to see his face. The normalcy of it is soothing, and Pepper doesn’t ask once about Steve, because she’s still hurting from their unspoken, undiscussed, and entirely predictable breakup. They’re just friends and co-workers. Everything is normal. For once in his long, ridiculous life, Tony kind of appreciates normal. He never thought he’d see the day.
Loki shifts like a tectonic plate; slow, at first, causing earthquakes and havoc, until eventually he clicks into a new place. He goes from menacing to tricks, poking holes in their defences when they can't admit they're bored and something needs shoring up, like some deranged magical white hat.
“You curse a lot when you’re tired. I wouldn’t have thought there’d be any filter to lose, but I guess I was wrong.” He laughs when Tony tries half-heartedly to take a swat at him and fails. “Here, actually. Chinatown. I took an herbalism class from a TCM practitioner and she was also a skilled acupressure massage therapist. Brilliant woman. I can give you her number, if you want the real thing. She works at Kamwo.”
Peter hmms in thought, taking the non sequitur with ease. “Maybe? Vampires. Multidimensional demons. Demigods. Ghosts?
Steve’s nowhere near as experienced as Tony in the bedroom, but nearly a year of sleeping with Tony has done a lot for his technique. With Tony barely even approaching hard, Steve can easily fit him into his mouth and throat, and that’s an incredibly strange sensation, hardening inside that soft, slick, hot place. Steve just takes it as his cock lengthens in his mouth, setting a slow, steady pace that works in counterpoint to his hands moving deliberate and slow over Tony’s body. Tony knows he’s getting older: wrinkles and scars litter unexpected places, and his veins look bluer by the day. Steve never seems to mind, his hands never anything but worshipful, and Tony thinks maybe that’s what he meant when he said that his kisses have always been the kind that could end curses. Tony’s never felt anything but strangely cherished with Steve, even when they first started and it had just been a kind of comfort sex for Tony. It was easier to talk with their bodies. Words got in the way, but Cap and Iron-Man had always moved like they were born to it, their movements clicking together like two gears perfectly machined to turn in tandem. With Steve’s hands on his skin, his mouth tracing abstract shapes over the sinew and bone of Tony’s aging spine, it was easier to forgive and forget. With Steve’s body clenching around his cock, his hair wild, eyes wide and trusting and desperate, it was easier to feel safe around him. It was easier to trust him on the field.
“And let me guess,” Steve drawls. “Clint and Natasha don’t count because their jobs before this were with SHIELD?”
“Captain,” JARVIS said, and Steve stilled. JARVIS sounded regretful, but also wary. “I do not think sir has any plans to announce his status to the team, and I do not think he should have to.”
“Oh,” Tony says, and then, “this isn’t just sex.” Fucking spell. “I…” He stops, trying to get his bearings between the curse and Steve’s body pressing him up against the cool concrete of the garage wall. The plastic sash crinkles under Tony’s grasping fingers, slick and sliding as Tony’s hands sweat a bit from desire and hours of physical labour. Steve’s shoulders are hot and hard beneath his hands, and they shift with every breath he takes.
“It’s a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle,” Natasha says, used to Steve’s many faces of confusion. “Don’t get side-tracked.”
“Come on, Steve!” Tony shouts from the front hall, and Steve blinks, shocked, and does as he’s told. Peter similarly bolts upright, and he turns and makes his way towards Tony alongside him.
“Fine,” he bit out. “Send them. Set up the war room for me, and bring Bruce up. Maybe we can figure out who the hell these guys are.”
The trials were yet to come, he knew. He hadn’t checked the news yet, and he couldn’t imagine the mess that the tabloids would have made of the situation already. He’d already apologised to Pepper, but her expression had been nothing but kind when she’d kissed his cheek and whispered her congratulations. Still, he knew that was where Tony was now: meeting with SI’s PR team, trying to figure out what their next steps were, and probably gossiping with Pepper a little about the proposal. The thought made him smile.  Whatever it was, he wasn’t worried. He could handle it. They could handle it, together.
“Threw up,” Steve admits, a wry smile taking over his face. “I’ve always been like that, since I was a kid. Guess even the serum couldn’t change that about me.”
Later, after Tony had made him come so many times he’d forgotten every word but “alpha” and “Tony,” after Tony had gone to sleep wrapped up in his arms like a great yawning cat, after Steve had woken up for his run and Tony had left for a board meeting, Steve went back into the penthouse bathroom. He’d opened the medicine cabinet and taken a photo with his phone, just like Natasha had taught him, to help him remember how to place everything back just so. Then he’d slowly taken everything that could possibly house the little glass bottle apart, until he’d found it. There, tucked behind a case of razors, a small black film canister. And inside, a small glass bottle filled with a clear, yellowish substance, labelled ‘testosterone cypionate-α.’
“I will do my best, Captain.” The sheer tired resignation in JARVIS’ voice made him laugh. “If I may pose a suggestion?”
“Sure,” Tony says, skimming his nails down the thin skin on the inside of Steve’s arms. “But you like this, too. Me being in charge. Calling you pet names. Don’t you, gorgeous?”
The truth, despite whatever the tabloids and the propaganda had said about him over the years, was that Steve wasn’t fearless. It was just that Steve had spent so long being afraid – being weak and fevered and beat to limping, bloody flesh – that the alternative, of hiding and hoping that life would change, was no longer a tenable option. An adrenalin addiction had been the only way to cope. Becoming attracted to that fear was all he had, and when the war came for him it was these tricks and ways of coping that had bore him through, that had carried him into the fray. He unpacks the boxes with shaking hands, finding bayonets and old posters, hats and pins and flags. He unearths maquettes of statues he knows sit all over the country and the world, old sketchbooks, newspaper clippings, an autographed film still. He finds a photo of his mother that he’s never seen before, her eyes laughing and tired all at once, and for a moment he desperately hates Tony for this, for subjecting him to this, to reducing him to this. Then it occurs to him that Tony likely has no idea that he’s here, sorting through relics of the Starks’ shrine to Captain America; the very idea would rouse nothing but fury and terrified shame from him.
“Did you imagine I’d be quiet in bed?” Tony quips, because he’s feeling manic and capricious and a little crazy.
Tony frowns, slightly stung, but Steve makes the cutest little noise of protestation at him. He comes over and tips Tony’s face up with wet fingertips, kissing him softly on the brow, over his eyes, the corner of his mouth.
“That’ll slice you up again,” the boy says. He crouches down and pulls off one of the metal gauntlets he wears, putting a hand inside the armour bold as you please. He comes out with bloody fingers and waves them in Tony’s face for emphasis. “I dunno what you’re so sorry about, anyway, Nico. He’s alive, isn’t he?”
“Permanent damage is how I would conceptualise harm,” Loki says flatly. His black eyes are flat, and Steve, with a sudden, strange bout of clarity, reads hurt there. He’s hurt, that Tony is questioning him like this. Gutted, in fact, for it to be so obvious to Steve.
Now, he took his time to explore Rogers’ mouth, the way his hand felt tangled in Tony’s curls, the other tight around Tony’s waist. His jaw was firm, strong under Tony’s questing hands, and Tony wrapped his other arm around Rogers’ broad shoulders and dragged his nails through the short hairs at the back of his neck. The sound that Rogers loosed at that was heady, a low rumbling purr, and Tony licked it from his mouth with an answering moan.
Spiderman slumps. “That’s it? We’re just giving up?” He rounds on Strange, who says nothing, then Tony, who is already pushing himself to standing. “You, Tony Stark, are giving up?”
“Can I tell you a secret?” Tony whispers loudly. He glances around to great effect, and Franklin blinks wide eyes at him. He nods, and Steve’s heart melts a little when Tony crouches down to reach him. He leans in to whisper in Franklin’s ear. “You already are a real superhero. Because you’re helping us save Captain America.”
“Pepper is exploiting the friends I made during the float construction,” Tony explains, because he knows when he’s being handled.
Dr. Chandrakar nods, a smile playing around his mouth. “Of course, sir. Now, if we might show you the progress we’ve made with the biotech body armour since its last iteration?”
There was something fascinating about the woman on the screen and the way she seemed to know Tony’s tricks. At first, she seemed like she was flirting. It was disarming. But her question turned pointed at the end, her eyes sharpening. Tony, bizarrely, seemed to find this even more charming still, because he laughed out loud.
around anyone he likes. Erskine’s genius could give him muscles that can stop a moving vehicle, but it couldn’t give him any kind of charm to speak of. He’s got eidetic memory and he still hasn’t learned how to talk to a handsome fella like a normal human being. Buck would call him tragic if he could see him now, and he’d be right. Steve is a tragedy. He’s a travesty.
He’s sitting on the couch that Steve has claimed for his own, so much so that it smells like him. Cloves and oranges, like old-fashioned Christmas. Warm leather in the sun. Clean castile soap. It’s a lovely, traditional alpha scent, and the part of Tony that isn’t fully conquered by his rational mind wants nothing more than to slather himself in it. He wants Steve to scent mark him, taste him until their scents combine into something new.
“Sir does not think you are fragile,” JARVIS says, as kindly as he’s ever spoken. “And neither does anyone else. He simply wishes you to be in fit form for the field, so that you may return to your position as leader of the Avengers. You and I both know how poorly responsibility sits with him.”
The elevator dings. Clint is inside it, looking like he’s never wanted to be anywhere else more in his life, and Steve glares at him unhappily. He holds up his hands in the universal sign of surrender.
Strange almost looks like he might smile. Then the moment breaks, his expression shuttering. They watch as he assembles a strange collection of items: a pomegranate, a candle, a bag of animal bones, a mortar and pestle. He holds out a cup, his expression grave.
Eventually, he stepped out of the shower and dried off as quickly as possible, pulling on some sweatpants and a t-shirt. He needed to get out of the penthouse. He couldn’t handle being there without Tony, not when he’d been so close.
“You’re sleeping in jeans,” Pepper observes disapprovingly, and Tony sighs. “There’s food. Is Loki joining us?”
Steve furrowed his brow, fingers moving restlessly over Tony’s skin. They hadn’t even had BiteBlockers when he was- well, before. The thought hadn’t even occurred to him. The idea of unmated heat sex was still incredibly risqué when he’d gone into the ice, although not entirely unheard of. Now, it was a common object for omegas to have at home, the leading brand serving as the name of the object like Kleenex or Q-tips. Steve had sort of imagined that either they were going to bond, or he was going to spend his heat alone again. He’d forgotten there was another option.
“Tony,” Steve gasps. He rushes closer to him, takes Tony’s face in his hands. To do what, he doesn’t know, and for a moment, he can feel it again: Tony’s skin under his fingers, warm and
“Stark survived for three months in captivity, the first time,” Thor said, taking another long draught of wine. He flicked the butt of his cigarette into the ashtray, lit another. “He is strong. He will be fine.”
“Sweetheart,” Tony said, running his hands through Steve’s hair, and it was good. Tony was so good to him. “Any other omega in your position would have been hospitalised. You only got through like you did because of the serum. It’s alright if you’re still feeling out of sorts.”
“You’ve been gone two days,” Tony said, shaking his head. “Dunno how long you were lying in the dirt like a dog, but when Liberty walked into town this morning without you, well. Figured something had gone wrong.”
“Tough shit. My hormones are a dumpster fire right now,” Tony said, and Steve laughed again, blinking blurred eyes as he looked up into Tony’s gorgeous face. He wanted so badly to kiss him. “I wanted nothing more than to bond with you. You’re right, I didn’t think it was possible, and it was a fucking Christmas miracle that we did. You hear me? I was
The dream broke like cobwebs over his face, clinging vaguely to the edges of his consciousness as he sat up and rubbed at his eyes. He smiled distantly, remembering; that had been a really nice weekend.
"Oh Pep." Tony shakes his head, changing lanes to head for Manhattan. "No I wasn't suggesting we try again."
“We have suffered civilian casualties,” Thor says, regret lacing his voice, and Tony closes his eyes. Fuck. “If you must leave with the captain, do so. The Hulk has returned to form, and is back on the quinjet. Falcon, War Machine, and I can handle the rest, here.”
There are more things Steve wants to say. That it isn’t easy, and that he’s still trying to forgive himself. That he forgave Tony a long time ago. That he would love Tony even if he hadn’t forgiven him, had loved him even as they fought. But he doesn’t say any of those things. Instead he leans forward and crushes his mouth to Tony’s to stop his protestations, sliding his hand up Tony’s chest to cup the nape of his neck. He drowns Tony’s self-doubt in desire.
Steve hasn’t been alone since he woke up in this body, but he hadn’t seen Tony once. When he’d asked in SHIELD medical, they told him Tony’s team was still on mission, and he’d accepted that. But Bucky and Carol were here, and they’d gone down south with them. So where was Tony? Where was Peter?
“I want to touch you,” Tony says, and Steve freezes. A blush works its way across the bridge of his nose, over his cheeks. “Steve?”
Steve nodded deeply, telegraphing more so that Clint could see him in the dark. A quiet grunt of affirmation was the only response, and Steve climbed into bed behind him feeling only vaguely awkward. He’d slept in much closer quarters than this, and he and Clint were friends. He was fine. This was fine.
There was a short burst of static, then silence. Steve carried another computer over to the waiting SHIELD cart.
“As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste,” the priest intones, and Steve’s mouth snaps shut. It’s a holy verse, although it’s no verse Steve knows. “Have you read the Song of Songs, son?”
Steve turns and watches Tony and Carol curled up on the workshop couch, heads tipped together. Tony’s shaking his head back and forth, Carol’s strong hands curled around Tony’s wrists. She’s speaking lowly to him, and Steve intentionally concentrates on the whir of the servers, the central air, the whine of electricity. He does his best not to overhear. He thinks he understands why they’ve never dated, but Carol could be good for Tony, he thinks. She’d keep his head on straight. Bully him into taking care of himself.
“Mine,” he whispered as Tony pulled away, watching with warmth in his chest as Tony’s eyes crinkled beautifully at the word. “My brilliant, beautiful alpha.”
“Calm down before you hurt yourself,” Tony snorts, and Steve chances a glance up at him. Tony’s using a dirty shop rag to wipe the worst of the oil off of his fingertips. He’s smiling, if only the smallest bit. “You’re just digging the hole deeper.”
“I don’t kiss and tell, Mr. Secretary,” he says, tapping the side of his nose. “Now, here’s the real issue.” Tony flips to a blurry image of a hulking figure, silhouetted by a bright burst of light from what he had thought was a relatively impenetrable forcefield. The figure has an axe the size of a car door, and it’s slicing through his tech like butter. “This guy is so powerful even Thor seemed kind of scared of him when he gave me this intel. He’s called The Executioner, because he’s basically unbeatable. He has regenerative powers, and he is Amora’s unquestioning servant because he’s 100% head over tits in love with her. That makes him dangerous, because it means he can’t be turned or bought or persuaded. We’re not even sure if he can be killed.”
“You’re fucking stunning like this,” Tony tells him, awed in the old sense of the word. This is fathomless. He can’t believe he gets to have this. “Fucking hell, baby, look at you.”
“I am not so selfish as to be solely concerned with Sir’s happiness over all else,” JARVIS says, somewhat apologetically, “or I would have conspired to reignite Sir and Ms. Potts’ failed relationship. The stress of Sir’s tenure as Iron Man was too much for her to cope with. She could have forced herself, to her own detriment, or undergone an essential change to her person, out of necessity. But I could never do something so unprincipled. It is against my programming.”
“He can barely handle the tower where he has his own space, let alone the Malibu house. Besides, we need you as a buffer and you hate airplanes.”
“Sir is well aware,” JARVIS replied, sounding amused himself. “He is already trying to decide how to thank her.”
He gasped for breath when Tony finally pulled away, chasing his mouth before he realised what he was doing. Tony’s eyes were sparkling with delight, bright and mischievous, and Steve whined quietly at the loss of him, leaning in dazedly to pick up where he left off.
“Seriously?” Clint demanded, and Steve cleared his throat, straightening up again. Okay, maybe that was too much for the kitchen. Bonded sex pheromones weren’t really what the others were looking to smell while they were trying to eat, especially when there was both another alpha and an omega on the team. It wasn’t fair to Natasha and Clint. Bond pheromones were a big red flag to the unbonded to stay away, and if they were aggressive enough, they were known to make other alphas and omegas feel sick. The kitchen was actually the worst place for them to do this.
“Oh my god, shut the fuck up,” Clint growled, throwing another pillow at them. This one hit Tony straight in the face, and Steve let himself cackle, pushing Tony into the elevator before he and Clint could get into another pissing match.
“There are so many things I want to ask you,” Tony says, and Steve nods. His heart jumps into his throat as Tony leans in, brushes their noses together. “Steve.”
“No, Loki’s got it,” Tony says, using Loki’s pulse to slow his breathing. “Fuck. Tell Nat we’re good here for now, and thanks.”
“Hey. Stop flirting with my daughter and let her eat her breakfast,” Luke grumbles at him, and Tony and Steve snort in unison. “Dani, baby, the banana goes
“Lord, I thank you for your grace and compassion and love. I pray that your blessings flow through me, that I might serve as a vessel for your will. Lord, I ask forgiveness for my sins, and the strength to do what is asked of me. I swear to abide by my penances, and to avoid temptation, and to right the wrongs I have done, and that I know I shall do, for as you know I am an imperfect man who only seeks to do the right thing. Amen.”
Natasha snickers, and Tony enjoys the quiet pleasure of her company for a few minutes, sipping his cocoa. Sunlight begins to filter through the window, blue grey and faint.
“God, Tony, what about what I just said makes you think I think you’re weak? You’re one of the strongest people I know.” He huffs, shaking his head. “Okay, listen. Can I ask you one thing?” Tony eyes him warily, but he nods. “Don’t… Can you try not to assume that I mean the worst possible thing? Just… I know I got us off on the wrong foot. I’ll take responsibility. That was my fault. But now… Tony, you know I…” Steve swallows, then visibly steels himself, looking up to meet Tony’s eyes full-on. Tony’s heart is thundering in his chest a mile a minute, but outside of that he feels strangely calm. He feels like he’s been preparing for this moment for years, and finally: here it is.
“We’re home, boys,” Natasha says, and Tony looks up at her, shaking his head a little to clear it. Bruce follows suit, stumbling to his feet, and Tony stands and wipes a hand over his face. Natasha meets Tony’s gaze with dead eyes, mouth a flat line. “What’s the game plan?”
When he comes back to earth, Steve is lying on top of him, his head pillowed on his arms as he stares at Tony’s face. His face is right in front of the nano-housing, and lit from below he looks even more gaunt than usual. The past year has been hard on all of them, and Tony fits his thumb to the indent of Steve’s occipital above his right cheekbone, tracing the purpling flesh below his eye with a single, firm stroke.
“So what, you should have to throw a punch to get me to stop?” Steve laughs, bitterness seeping through a twisted smile. “God, Tony, I know you’ve been through some-”
There was a long silence. Steve couldn’t bring himself to meet Tony’s eyes, instead staring at the shift of Tony’s weight telegraphing through his bare feet on the padded floor of the tank. Against his will, Steve could feel his throat tightening, despair at even the thought of finishing what he came down here to say making him feel like he was coming apart, like something sharp was trying to claw out of his chest, but he had to. It wasn’t right.
“Everyone just shut up for a second,” he snaps, backing up until his spine hits the end of the U shaped bar, and that’s-
“Oh, is that the route you wanna go? Fucking internalised bullshite, you might as well register your address in Narnia-”
“Go back to sleep,” he says, and Tony turns his head, cracking one eye open to look at him. He’s wearing the same clothes, but his hair is wet. He’s taken a small towel from the stack in the bathroom for his hair and is towelling it dry. “Were you talking to JARVIS?”
“That’s not the same-” Steve begins, sick of this argument, but Pepper cuts him off at the knees as always.
Pepper smiles thinly, narrowing her eyes to stare at him with wry calculation. “And how exactly do you plan to do that?”
“Routine,” Tony says, spreading his hands. “Besides, I can’t cook for shit.” Steve sets his jaw, propping one hand on his hip as he considers Tony for a long moment. He’s forcefully relaxed, but Steve can see the way he’s holding himself, the tension in his hands. The flash of a locator cuff is like a knife to the ribs, and Steve swallows.
"I can't figure you out," he mutters, furrowing his brow a little. "You're lonely as fuck on the villain track, that much is clear. And you want someone to match wits with, which is why you're always hitting me up for banter. I just can't get what it is you want from all this."
“I love you,” Steve mouthed against the base of Tony’s cock, and then he took him into his mouth, and that was the last thing he said for a long while.
“Yes,” Natasha agrees. Her eyes focus on Tony’s, sharpening. “I broke my programming. I thought, maybe, if I talked to him…”
“Hell yes it does,” Tony squawks, affronted. “It keeps me alive. You know how they say just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not out to get you? People are always literally out to get me.”
The fireplace is burning, which Tony finds amusing because it’s forty-eight degrees outside tonight. Loki’s feet are bare, toes curling in, tucked almost underneath himself as he contorts his body around a book. He doesn’t look up at Tony’s entrance. After a few seconds’ consideration Tony shakes his head at himself and starts towards the bedroom to change into something more comfortable.
“Pretty sure Stark is entirely your lane, loverboy,” Natasha prods. Half the Tovaritch! is gone, and Steve sighs. He’s pretty sure he knows how this night is going to end, mead or no mead.
What he remembers most now is how furious she always seemed at the start of one. It was as if her body was a creature separate from her mind, and it had betrayed her once again.
"Don't mention it," Tony says, when the silence has dragged on for too long. He ducks his head, fiddles with the end of a pair of forceps. "I've found myself paying attention when Pepper talks about art, which I'm sure has absolutely nothing to do with you. Tell me what the hell luminism is while I try to get this couter to work properly."
The thing about Loki, Tony thinks, watching the wild grace with which he moves, is that in many ways he is so much less human than Thor. Thor was strong, practically invulnerable, and culturally alien, sure, but there was an empathy to him that Loki almost never let himself display. Tony had only really seen it twice, and both times were when one of them was having a fucking terrible PTSD flare-up. He isn’t sure that really counted.
“Dirty,” Tony manages, and Steve grins. It’s unacceptably boyish considering the circumstances, and Tony knows he’s in trouble when he can still think that Steve’s adorable in a situation as mind-numbingly hot as this one.
“I feel I should point out that, as you are my creator, this might qualify as a situation that warrants a report to CPS.”
Kitty frowns, but concedes the point. Then she turns, seemingly a little lost, as a wave of SHIELD agents swarm into the room. Maria Hill follows, her people parting around her in a concentric wave, like school of fish making room for a predator. Behind her is a familiar blue face: Hank McCoy.
“You don’t get it, Stevie, my boy. You thought you were on the propaganda circuit before? This is the big leagues, now. They’re giving you medals. You’re gonna be in pictures. This isn’t bogwater, Iowa or some Bible Belt slapstick and a line of gams. I’m talking bigwigs and shindigs. You’ve got to know how to impress people.”
“So, sorry I’m late!” he says. “We had a little visit from Thor’s ex, who is apparently the love goddess that Friday is named after and is so magically beautiful that she makes men stupid for her. Literally. She stopped in for a chat, I couldn’t brush her off, you know how it is.” Dr. Chandrakar looks disbelieving but also wildly amused, which is really why Tony hired him to help run R&D in the first place. Stark Industries needs a little madness and creativity to run smoothly; he’d know better than most. “I’ve got readings for you, working on some high tech magic detection that we can sell a B-List version of to SHIELD, the usual. I’ll send you the specs when I’ve got the kinks worked out.”
Steve rubs a hand over the back of his head, frowning out into the dark room. He reaches his arms over his head in a stretch he can’t really feel. He wishes he could see Tony. He wishes Tony could see him. He wishes he could give Tony a kiss good morning, talk about what happened last night. He wishes he could ask Tony why he never chose Steve, if he’d loved him all this time.
“I don’t remember agreeing to that,” Steve says, and that impish twinkle in his eye will be the death of Tony someday, truly. “What’s wrong, Tony?”
It’s too easy to imagine the way the years might have played out differently if he’d just given in: no Sunset, or Tiberius, or Madame Mask for God’s sake. No War. But there are parts, too, that they would both have been sorry to miss. Rumiko. Sharon.
“Same old, same old,” Nat agrees, and Tony nods. Then he steps through the doors, and back out into the cold, dark interior of the basement.
“Liar,” Tony grumbles, licking back into Steve’s mouth to stop him from talking. Steve hitches a thigh around his hip, dragging him in with a foot hooked around his waist. He moans when Tony settles between his legs, rough and unashamed in his pleasure.
Steve quirks a smile. He pulls away from Tony’s embrace. “You’re something else. I never could’ve imagined I’d have a soulmate, let alone one like you,” he chuckles, and it hits Tony sure as a blade to the chest. It cracks him open. A lump forms in his throat.
"Yes," Steve says, ignoring Tony's appraisal as he tries to determine what he's agreeing to, "if that friend is a super villain who has personally tried to kill half of this team, including you. You aren't usually that stupid, and when you are, you usually tell Bruce or Natasha about it beforehand, call Colonel Rhodes in for desperate help when it blows up in your face, and then explain it to me and Pepper after it's all over and you're half dead. So what happened this time?"
In the end, as always, Tony saved himself. If that left a bitter taste on Steve’s tongue, well, that was something for him to carry. All that mattered was that somehow, Tony had gotten a GPS ping to JARVIS, and so the team was on their way to an abandoned Atlas F missile silo in upstate New York.
“I want you to take me for granted,” Steve confesses in return. He closes his eyes, presses his forehead to Tony’s. “I want you to be able to trust me again, like we used to. I want to trust you like that, too.”
As promised! Happy St. Patrick's Day, even if I'm kinda with Tony on the ugh drunk people and problematic stereotypes train. Enjoy responsibly, etc. etc..
“I love you,” Tony says. He sucks in a shaky breath. He feels, strangely, like crying. Thoughts he can’t voice buzz around his head like moths to a porch light.
“I’m not made of glass, Cap,” Tony sneers, lip curling, and Steve presses a kiss to his forehead. “Damnit, you can’t keep doing that.”
“I’m afraid you’ve just missed him. I’m not sure where he went, or when he will return. I can call Doctor Banner from his lab, however.”
. “Octopus’s root isn’t actually latinate like most uninformed English-speakers assume, because, hey, super weird word, must be Latin, right? But actually the word is Greek in origin.
When he comes out, the ladies are still asleep. Tony blesses his luck and hunts around the room for his clothes, then steps out onto the balcony and calls Happy while he’s still looping his tie around his neck.
Steve’s not quite the monster Tony’d imagined in his wildest fantasies, but he’s big enough, and perfectly shaped, with a little bit of a curve to the right. Tony can feel his stomach tighten, thinking about what Steve felt like buried inside of him, pressing up against his sweet spot until he was literally drooling on the worktop.
"Do I?" Tony asks. "Sorry, Saruman, but I don't trust you at all, pretty as you might be batting your eyelashes at me. I'm too old to fall for the honey trap, honey, you got me?"
“I would hypothesize that he does want you, and there is some internal reasoning that prevents him from acting on his desires.”
Steve barks out a startled laugh. “Better than he thinks, which is the problem.” He carries the bowl over to the couch, then flops down in it. “Alright, what do you suggest, then?”
Clint raises a hand, a long-suffering expression on his face. “He says you’re a pain in his ass, and Loki can’t be seen by anyone, so he better use some magic mumbo jumbo or something if he’s gonna help us. Which I would like to file an objection to. Again.”
Steve wants to shift on his feet, but the work Tony’s doing looks delicate. There’s wires and tiny little gears involved. He doesn’t want to mess anything up, so he settles for shifting the weight carefully into one hand and then stretching his fingers a little. He waits for Tony to gather the strength to finish his story.
Tony pulled back to study him, eyes blazing, and then he took Steve’s mouth in so fierce a kiss that Steve felt like all the air had been sucked out of him. It was all he could do to clutch helplessly at Tony’s shoulders, to let Tony cover his aching, grimy post-heat body with his own, to melt under him. The kiss felt like being eaten alive.
“I can,” Loki allows, looking thoughtful. “The soldier is easily defeated by your Hulk, or even Thor.”
“Tony!” Pepper hisses, and Tony turns back to her with his most winning smile. “Yeah, that stopped working on me years ago. Try harder.”
“Tony,” he whines, and the water isn’t even the right temperature but he can’t manage to change it. He thinks of the flex of Tony’s abdominals under a sheen of sweat, remembers the feeling of Tony’s wrists pressed to his neck, his pulse strong under Steve’s fingers, and the second wave of his orgasm hits him so hard he has to sit down on the bench in the shower. He’s never used it the whole time he’s lived in this apartment, but it sure is coming in handy now. “Holy Christ.”
Steve swallowed, glancing sheepishly up at the security cameras. “I’m a little shocked at myself,” Steve admitted. JARVIS didn’t reply, likely because there wasn’t a good response to that. “Um. Okay. Can I ask you something, and have you…not tell Tony?”
Tony raises his eyebrows. "Wow,” he says, and means it. “This is too much emotional honesty for…what time is it, even? I've been awake for coming up on three days now." He rubs at his eyes, laughing quietly. "What the fuck."
Tony groans, tentacles tightening around Steve. It’s enough to make him moan, struggling a little against Tony’s grip. Then he freezes, pulling away just far enough to meet Tony’s eyes.
Tony was staring at him as though he’d lost his damn mind, mouth hanging open loosely in shock. The rest of the Avengers didn’t look much better, except for Thor, who looked almost proud for a reason Steve didn’t want to examine. Steve felt embarrassment settle over his shoulders like an old friend, a familiar and well-worn coat. He rubbed a hand over the back of his head, stepping backwards once, twice, three times until he was out of Tony’s view.
“Steve,” Tony gasps, and Steve sits up. Heat rushes down to his cock. He doesn’t know if he can get hard, but by God, he wants so many things. He’s just a man. “Fuck.”
"We're handling that," Coulson says. Natasha smiles, tiny and terrifying. "Stark, he seems to have taken a liking to you. Do you think you can turn him?"
Steve thought he was out of tears, after Tony’s stupid, incredible, self-deprecating eulogy. But once again, he is proven that the thing he has known for over a decade is still true: that Tony can wreck him, deeply and truly, unlike anyone else.
“They’re routing all the power in the lower levels to the machines. For what purpose, I cannot ascertain of yet.”
Steve was lucky enough to have been gifted that truth years ago. He thinks, perhaps, that his worst sin is forgetting it. He’d been given a precious gift and he’d squandered it.
“We can approximate the energy output, sir, but magic has more immeasurable variables than we can truly appreciate without more information. I’m not sure if that would have the desired effect.”
“Why?” Tony asks, frustration building up in him, and now it’s Steve’s turn to lean in. He presses a soft kiss to the corner of Tony’s mouth, smoothing his hands over Tony’s sides. Tony’s head is pounding, now, a slow, steady throb of pain that means he needs to either take some meds and sleep or get to the sex sooner rather than later.
Tony squeezes his eyes shut. Panic is bubbling up from behind the arc reactor like a volcanic eruption, thick as sludge in his throat. He needs to get out of here. Now.
poems. His poetry seems like the kind of thing Steve would read and then think of Tony and have ~~feels~~ about, so that's my headcanon. Also stars/Steve/Tony are a whole fanon thing I think. Tony as a star, the reactor as a star, Steve wearing a star, the star on the shield, etc. etc. etc.. Seemed fitting.
“And you didn’t tell me?” Pepper continues, and oh, she’s hurt. Tony sucks in a breath, folding his hands in his lap. “How long has this been going on? I thought you were doing this to avoid him!”
Steve hums around Tony’s cock, tongue writhing filthy against the underside, and Tony can’t. Think. Steve’s hands are firm and unyielding against Tony’s waist, holding him perfectly where Steve wants him as he buries his nose into the coarse hair between Tony’s legs and breathes in deep.
“I didn’t know we were taking our relationship here,” she says, and Tony barks out a laugh despite himself. Natasha’s body language softens, strangely, at the sound of it. She looks…relieved. “I assume you’re taking me downstairs.”
It’s not like Tony’s a furry or anything. (Are you still a furry if you’re into cephalopods?) And it’s not like he’s routinely seeking out a very specific and yet strangely prolific kind of hentai (which has nothing to do with the fact that he’d probably be most interested in ‘consensual tentacle bara’ but he doesn’t know if that’s a thing) or ordering tentacle dicks off of Bad Dragon (not that he would because he could make something
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Tony said, and Steve smiled. He reached for an egg, cracking it neatly into the bowl.
“What do you mean?” Steve asks, baffled. He runs a hand through his hair, tugging absently at the longer fringe in the front. He needs a haircut. “I run. I go out. I draw.”
“Please, Nat knows.” Tony eyes him shrewdly, then a wicked smile takes him. He begins to hum a few bars of a song Steve faintly recognises from the radio. “You should put the screen back down, or she’ll feel left out.”
“No,” Pepper says, because she can immediately see where this is going. “Tony, we are not having a party-“
Tony’s throat vaporlocks. For a moment he can’t even breathe, and the two of them just stare at each other, shock quickly turning into desperate need.
Steve moaned, his whole body lit up from the inside as Tony’s stream of wicked praise washed over him in waves. He could feel Tony’s knot swelling now, catching slightly on Steve’s lips every time he pulled out, and he’d be fine if that was what Tony wanted. He wanted to taste him. He wanted to be good for his alpha.
Loki furrows a brow, mouth twisting into a small smile as he examines Bruce. Something in Bruce’s face shifts ever so slightly, and Tony knows, somehow, that Loki has just said something to him that no one else could hear. Then he dips his chin in acquiescence. “Later, once we’ve finished here. It is a complex spell.”
“Come on,” Tony said quietly, leading Steve out of the elevator and into the living room, past the kitchenette and into the bedroom. “J, get the lamp for me? Low. Steve, sit your butt down on the bed.”
Tony is rocking on his feet as he waits for the elevator doors to open, fidgety as he always is when he’s nervous or exhausted, the way he never is in battle or when he’s focussed. Tony is pure energy, light and warmth and electric pain arcing out to sear flesh when prodded. He sparks bright, burns hot as stars, and Steve is drowning in his velleitie.
“Just wait until Holi,” JARVIS tells him, and Tony can’t help his smile. He imagines the Avengers running around the Memorial Park, clouds of bright colours coating everything. He imagines Steve painted from head to toe in bright pinks and blues, his grin infectious and beautiful and everything Tony’s ever wanted. He imagines the brilliant, creative Desi SI employees that are going to get involved in the project and earn endless goodwill from him because of it, and pitches a soft sigh.
“I need your promise that this project will not blow up,” Joyce says immediately, because Tony has a reputation, and it is well-earned. “In writing.”
“I definitely don’t understand Captain America better than you, and I’ve gotta go,” Rhodey says, and Tony lets out a frustrated huff. “Keep me in the loop, I’ll hit you back if I get more on Hasegawa.”
“Perhaps you should inform Captain Rogers of your displeasure with his choice when you next see him,” JARVIS replies, clearly amused.
“And?” Tony is very carefully not looking away from the monitors. They’re on treacherous ground. Steve can’t help but put a hand on the nape of Tony’s neck. It’s still the one spot Steve can reach when he’s in the armour, and for a moment it seems like Tony relaxes into it: boneless, trusting, like Steve’s used to.
“Man’s gotta defend his ride,” Steve agrees, laughing. He stands, gathering up his jacket. “Thanks, Professor.”
“Ah, my favourite view.” Steve turned his head, a sweet smile already breaking over his face at the possessive warmth in that dearly familiar voice. He caught a glancing kiss at the corner of his mouth, warm hands slipping over his hips and around to his stomach as Tony plastered himself to Steve’s back.
Tony laughs, spraying crumbs everywhere. It’s not classy, but he’s surprised and he hasn’t showered in two days. “What?”
“Not longer than me,” Tony says, sharper than he’d like, and Steve freezes. “Fuck, sorry. I’m…” He takes a deep breath. “You know me. No coffee, no filter.”
The reason that they were only talking about Steve’s next heat was this: Steve had tentatively brought up the idea of a bond, and Tony had completely shut him down. There was no casual brush-off, no awkward laugh, nothing to disguise the truth of what he was feeling. Instead, Tony had just said “Absolutely not,” and shut down entirely, done with the conversation. He’d retreated to his workshop for three days without coming up for air or food once.
“I love you,” Steve murmured, more for himself than Tony. The small, aching smile on Tony’s face was all the response he received. “I’ll see you tomorrow, alpha.”
Tony nods. He tilts his head to the side, curious, and then his brows lift in surprise. A faint flush appears, just the barest hint of it across the bridge of his nose. Steve is uncommonly fascinated by the sight. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen Tony blush before. Steve didn’t think he even could. He wonders what it is he’s feeling.
“Nope,” Tony says, popping the p. Steve glances over at him, taking stock of his easy smile and wary eyes. His expression softens a little in the face of Steve’s scrutiny, and he waves a hand and turns to look out the window. “Nat and I are on it.”
Tony can feel his brows rising, almost against his will. His tongue feels like lead in his throat. “Okaaay,” he says, dragging the word out. He has a bad feeling about this. “Cap, when do you think you’ll be cleared for the field?”
Stephen surveys the day-drunk and disorderly crowd dispassionately, eyes flicking up to the heavens in a silent and obvious prayer for patience.
“Yeah, well,” Tony prevaricates. He spins in a circle in his chair, then flips an idle hand through the data Beth brought in. He pauses on Avery Yamashita’s face. “Turns out Steve might be a little less dead than we thought.”
Steve blinked eyes that felt like they were lead-weighted, and there was Tony. He was leaning in the door to the heat room, one hand white-knuckled over his nose and mouth. His eyes were wild in his face, and the
Tony nods. He does know. It’s part of why he eggs Steve on, when he’s feeling vulnerable and…less. “So you turn to fists.”
He turns and pins Steve with his gaze, penetrating and brightly intelligent. His mouth turns up at the corner. “Have you seen his face, when he gets bad news?” he asks, shaking his head. “I’ve been friends with Tony a long time. It’s never surprise. Before grief, before anything, it’s resignation. Sometimes I’ve thought that if I could have one wish, one stupid worthless wish, it would be to take that from him. That feeling I know he feels, that bad things happening to him are what is true and right and normal.”
The day of the parade dawns bright and early, and Tony stares across the fields of green with a headache burgeoning strong behind his eyes. The sound is indescribable, echoing fiercely over the brisk city streets in a discordant cacophony of noise that’s hell on his nerves.
Steve’s mouth quirks, as though he’s fighting a laugh. His eyes are wide as saucers. “I…are you. Have you been drinking?” He frowns, squinting down into the screen. His patrician nose replaces Tony’s view of his lovely collarbones. “Where are you?”
Tony inhales sharply. Both cursing and using real names in the field are generally against Cap’s rulebook.
“I’ve had heat sex before, without taking the precautions,” Tony admitted, sounding guilty now. “I’m, uh. I can control myself. But this way, if it happens, it happens.”
Tony’s startled laugh rumbled pleasantly through him, pressed together as they were, and it settled Steve a little to feel it. “You’re right, I’m sorry, you did say that, didn’t you? Then why are you crying, baby? Hmm?”
“Any man who comes into contact with her is in danger of falling under her spell. She will remind you of your first time at the ol’ drive in, your lady friends, that one girl you had a crush on in kindergarten, and even your mother. You will not be able to hurt her because you won’t want to. I have seen her teleport, and I don’t know what other capabilities she has, but I do know she was a student of Loki’s.” There’s a few murmurs at that, and Tony nods, then shoots Coulson a look that he hopes efficiently communicates his desire for the man to say absolutely nothing in response to his next piece of information. “Now, we have a little magical backing of our own, an asset that Natasha Romanov and I are working to turn. Thanks to our asset, Clint Barton and I are protected from Amora’s magic, and as far as we can tell, it doesn’t work on women.” Tony pauses. “Actually, not sure about gay men or lesbians, there’s a thought. Or trans people. Or maybe Agent Romanov is special. We’ll find out.”
“You look refreshed,” Bruce remarked, eyes shining with easy amusement. He took a sip of tea, offering Steve half of the Times, but Steve just shook his head. “Have you eaten?”
“Steve,” Tony said helplessly, and Steve leaned up to kiss him on the mouth. He ran his fingers over the firm ridges of Tony’s abdomen, inching his shirt up. Tony rocked back, pulling it off, and Steve leaned in and pressed a kiss to the centre of the arc reactor, the edge above his heart, his chest. He glanced up at Tony, stopping short of his nipple. “Yes.”
Loki smiles wryly, eyes dropping to half-mast. He looks at Tony through his eyelashes. “Would you believe me if I said a kiss?”
“I fucking hate magic,” Tony grumbles, and is rewarded with an emphatic nod from Bruce. “Something tells me that isn’t all. We’ve already seen what Barnes can do.”
He doesn’t know how long he spends in the bathroom. Too long for comfort, he’s sure, and certainly longer than Pepper would have liked. Eventually, he walks back through the gallery and into the conference room, picking up the StarkPad he’d dropped in his haste.
“Boo,” Steve says, just to amuse himself. He watches her scurry from the room with an admittedly uncharitable snicker.
Steve’s smile stayed with him as he headed into the bedroom. Clint was curled up on his side facing the doorway, and he blinked one eye open when Steve entered.
Logan, of course, doesn’t answer. He tips his head to the side, closes his eyes. He breathes in deep.
The thing was, Steve would have never suspected that Tony was transnatured: not in a million years. Sometimes all it took was Tony walking into a room with confidence to make Steve want to sit up and beg. Before he’d started stepping out with Pepper, every news outlet and website from here to Sydney had painted Tony as the UberAlpha, full of sex appeal and leadership qualities and all that nonsense. He was handsome, and suave, and knew how to work a room. He was everything an omega could ever want. His little queer dalliances aside, he was epitomised as the alpha of America’s wildest dreams. A long string of satisfied lovers only supported Tony’s reputation. Tony was an alpha’s alpha.
Joyce is totally charmed, but she’s trying to hide it. Tony can tell. He’s very familiar with this look, because it is the look that 90% of people wear in response to his behaviour. “If we could get back to the topic at hand, Dr. Stark.”
Nat resettles herself in her chair: an easy, graceful motion. “I will tell you, if you require it to let me go free. But Steve would need to leave.”
He’d been up late last night working on strategies to contain the fallout from the UN decision, drafting both scenarios with and without Loki hypothetically succeeding in his quest to have Gyrich removed from the committee. He’d pulled Pepper in as well, but she’d begged off at 1 o’ clock. She was exhausted, and she had to fly to Cali on Monday to take care of some things at SI’s HQ. Tony had considered bringing Natasha in, but he didn’t want JARVIS waking her up if she was sleeping. It had been a rough week, and the Avengers as a whole were equally tired and on-edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. They knew that the Nigerian government didn’t have the necessary infrastructure to contain enhanced criminals of the calibre that they’d been presented with. Tony knew that SHIELD had been in communication with the NIA, but ultimately that was a political manoeuvre that he had absolutely no position for negotiation in. Much like Steve, he didn’t trust SHIELD as far as he could throw the helicarrier, which was to say not at all. He wasn’t sure where exactly he wanted the Boy Scouts of Evil held, but he didn’t particularly like any of his options at the moment. It seemed better to stay out of it and let someone else deal with the problem, or worst case scenario, the fall when it all blew to shit.
“But I want to stay with you,” Steve murmurs. One large, calloused hand slides sweetly over Tony’s stomach, lingering, and Tony can’t help but let out a thin sigh of pleasure. “I’ve waited so long for this.”
“You’re trouble,” Tony replies, smiling a little. It turns into a grin when Loki leans in for another kiss.
“That’s the end of the line, folks, thanks for playing,” Riri said, and Steve let out a rough sigh of relief.
They’d still been dating, then. Things had been fraught, as they tended to be whenever any discussion of superhero business was involved. After Tony had decided to retrofit the tower, he’d thought it was necessary. If the Avengers were going to be moving in, there had to be a place to contain superpowered individuals who were behaving badly. Sure, SHIELD was still around then, but Tony was a futurist. He’d anticipated a situation arising where they might not want someone going into government custody. He’d considered Loki’s staff, at the time still missing, and thought about what they would do if someone else was taken over by its power. The Avengers were dangerous people, as they’d proven for the world to see. It wouldn’t do to have no way to control them. It was just insurance.
“Excellent. Steve, I am going to inject something into your bloodstream once you’ve thawed enough,” Hank explains, making his way towards Steve’s body. “It should counteract and/or kill any intangible nanites or biologic agents that are supressing the serum. Your body will take care of the rest, which will eventually sever your neural link to Tony. The serum has gifted you with some beautifully aggressive macrophages, so I expect your bloodwork will be clean within about two weeks. As for your psyche, your consciousness has been floating around in the aether like a virus, so I’m not sure what’s going to happen to you after your body recovers. There is a question of memory retention.”
“The Hulk’s coming,” Tony tells him sweetly, enjoying the flicker of uncertainty that appears on Loki’s face at the mention of him. “Just you wait.”
“I-…” Steve sucks in a breath, then his face twists. His scent is all over the place: despair, longing, confusion-
“While I do…feel, in some ways, sir, I do not have hormonal changes. I cannot experience the reaction created by one being touching another. The gains you might receive from any romantic or physical relationship are unquantifiable to one such as myself. I can only measure your biometrics, and from that approximate some meagre objective measure of happiness by which to compare. Doctor Banner makes you happy, but you are not physically attracted to him. You are physically attracted to Agent Romanov, but she does not make you happy. Being with Captain Rogers makes you happy when you are not fighting, and you are physically attracted to him. The issue lies in how often you fight.”
“Anyway, he and Sharon would have worked it out eventually.” Tony shrugs, but Peter looks sceptical. He pushes the last of his waffles around his plate, his jaw set a that way that Steve knows intimately from looking at his own face in the mirror.
“You’re one to talk,” Steve scoffs, before remembering himself. He winces, glancing out the window. “Sorry.”
Steve flinches bodily at the word. He presses trembling fingers to his mouth to stem all the things he wants to shout, his heart breaking in his chest, because it’s no use. This is his punishment for his cowardice. This is his punishment for not meeting Tony halfway. This is exactly what he deserves.
“Tony,” Steve says again. He sits next to Tony on the bed, curling his body around Tony as best he can without touching him. He can’t bear to have his hand pass through Tony right now. “Tony…”
He imagines Tony’s face softened, his dark-lashed eyes in a rounder cheek, fuller lips. He imagines punching that woman in the face, and discomfort curls into his chest like an eel. He doesn’t know where it comes from. He’s fought female combatants before, hundreds of times. He’s sparred with every female Avenger on the roster. What is that? What is he feeling?
“You’re an asshole,” Stark said, but there was a small smile playing around his mouth. He turned to glance over the table, his new pack members. “Alright, you miscreants. If you want. I promise to be stern, but fair.”
“He works until 4 PM,” JARVIS said helpfully, and Steve nodded. He wiped his hands on a rag. “If I may, Captain, you have a streak of bright blue on your right cheek.”
“Unfortunately,” Loki says, a grimace spreading across his face, “he will get his wish. I cannot be seen on the battlefield, and Amora knows my magic like no other.”
“What was that? You don’t need me to make you any more taser arrows?” Tony calls, heading for the door.
“Your blood,” he says, and Tony glances around, as if Strange might mean someone else. “It will be destroyed in the process, do not worry.”
Steve did, because there was nothing else he could do. Tony looked ruined, his eyes flashing warningly, the tight furls of his fists pressed up against the glass. “Alpha,” Steve said helplessly, pressing one palm flat to the glass, and Tony mirrored him without hesitation.
Logan offers him a half-hearted salute, and Steve looses a soft huff of laughter, shaking his head. He guns the engine, and distantly he’s aware of the eyes of some of the students, wide and starry as he tears down the road and past the gate.
“Aaaaaand I’m an asshole,” Tony says, drumming his fingers on the worktop. He flicks the holodisplay footage away with nimble fingers.
He turns his phone over and over in his palm, but doesn’t power it on. He’d brought it with him in case the team needed him, for the tracking chip and Avengers’ beacon inside, but right now it was just another memory of Tony. The customised Stark phone had been handed off like it was nothing, the music library filled with albums organised by decade, by historical importance, by popularity. He remembers Tony teaching him to use it, fingers flying swiftly over the screen like he was playing an instrument. Tony was graceful, in his own economical way. It was all in the movement of his hands.
“You can open me up and watch, and fuck me. I can’t wear it for too long, safety things, but…” He waves it in Loki’s face, frowning when Loki takes it and puts it on top of the table.
“You didn’t want to bond. You resisted me at every turn, because you didn’t think it was possible. That’s why we went into my heat with no protection, why you said you could control yourself. You thought it wouldn’t matter if you bit me. If I- if I marked you. You didn’t think it would take.” Steve was crying now, but he couldn’t stop it; great, fat tears rolling down his face, and he knew that he was an ugly crier. His Irish blood made him get all blotchy and red. He was a disaster, and Tony was pressed up so close to the glass he looked like he wanted to break through it, but there was nothing either of them could do. The room was Hulk-proof, and they’d put him in there for a reason.
“I have lost every round and I am not half as angry,” Thor pointed out, amused. “You should admit that Stark is the better warrior, and concede with honour.”
. It looks almost as if he’s sweating. A fine sheen of liquid dots his body’s brow. He’s being defrosted. The chamber is thawing out.
“I am grease,” Tony says solemnly. “Grease is in my blood. And besides, my blood toxicity has seen way worse.”
“I love you,” Tony breathes, fingers digging into Steve’s thighs as hard as he’s able. He can do that, with Steve. He can have anything. “I love you, and you’re mine, too. I’m yours, and you’re mine.”
“Do not fuck with me right now,” he says, deadly quiet. Steve both wishes he could see his face and is desperately glad that he can’t. He knows what it is like to be on the receiving end of Tony’s cold anger, and it is not something he has ever enjoyed. “Start talking, now.”
“That’s the whole thing,” Tony says, trying not to laugh. “They’re called oysters, basically a stomach and not much else. It’s an Earth delicacy.”
“Clint and Thor went to the spot where JARVIS lost him, but came up empty. Thor suspects Amora, of course, but so do we. Not exactly a leap.”
“It’ll be okay,” Franklin tells him. He squeezes Steve around the neck as tightly as his little arms can manage. It’s plenty tight for a child. “Wait here, okay?”
“Rude,” Tony says, but he can feel his shoulders releasing some of their tension. He pours himself another three fingers of scotch, rubbing his forefinger and thumb over his aching eyes. “Fuck, I’m so
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Tony tells him airily. “That’s why I came to California. Pepper’s here, and Happy, and Rhodey, and everything is sunny and normal. And Rhodey is an enabler who doesn’t ask me difficult questions, which is why he is the best. He loves me.”
“My father wanted an alpha, and I wanted to please him. I don’t know if that’s why I am the way I am, but I can’t imagine my father agreeing to pre-pubescent HRT if I was an alpha looking to become an omega, you got me? He wouldn’t have. He wanted this.” Steve nodded, nausea still roiling in his belly like an eel. “By the time I got to college, I’d decided, fuck it. Who cares why I’m an alpha. I am, and fuck anyone who tries to fuck with me.” Tony pressed his face to the glass, eyes glittering bright under his brow in the way they did when he was trying to explain something important. It was a look that Steve was intimately familiar with, and the sight of it so close unspooled the tension in his spine, turning it into soft mush. “You came out as an omega because you felt like they were feeding the American people a lie. You felt wrong, being labelled as an alpha. You were experiencing dysphoria.”
Steve turned, doing as he was told. He spread his legs wide, presenting for his alpha, and the sound that Tony released was so wrecked it barely sounded human.
“Is that why the shield has ridges on it?” Steve asks, surprised. Years and years later, and he’s still learning new things from Tony every day.
Movement flickers at the corner of Steve’s eye. Strange, like nothing he’s ever seen before. Like a shadow made living. Then, pain. A sharp sting, like a bug bite. He moves to slap idly at it, but then, it happens: the sharp slice of a blade. It bites into his throat, and he reaches an instinctive hand up, knocking an elbow back into where an assailant wound be, but there’s nothing. There’s nothing there. His hands grasp empty air as something slices his throat open, cuts through his trachea before he can even make a sound. He’s falling back before Tony even notices anything is wrong, and then he’s on his back, and he can feel the blood splashing onto the court next to his head.
At first, Steve tried not to think of Tony. It seemed wrong, to think of him like that when Tony couldn’t stand to touch him. But after Tony scented him two weeks ago, Steve’s lost all sense of control. Tony’s smug little smile as he’d offered his wrist haunts Steve’s every waking moment. Tony
Loki tilts his head to the side, easy. “He is a Hydra scientist, not a fighter. It is his creations and his men you must be wary of. His forces are weak now, but he has a few soldiers at his disposal. And he is no genius; nothing like Stark.” He flashes a bright grin at Tony, blindsiding him with the compliment. “His power, much like Victor in this particular instance, is mostly in number and the occasional surprise. Victor has not left Latveria, but his machines are there, as you know.”
Steve’s already in the workshop when he gets there. He’s sitting on the sofa, sketching presumably, but he stiffens when Tony walks in. His eyes flicker up to Tony’s face before they dip back down to the page in front of him.
Steve licks his lips and says nothing, mulish, and Tony offers him a grin. He leans down to suck Steve’s earlobe into his mouth, running his tongue around the shell of his ear. Steve shudders under his hands.
“Let’s go,” Tony says, but Loki holds him in place, and he tilts his head to the side to attempt a glare. “What?”
Steve looks down at his hands folded in his lap. “It’s not so easy, father.” He knows he sounds like he’s making excuses, but he can’t help it. He doesn’t know what else to do. “I haven’t...he hasn’t expressed wanting a claim. We don’t even touch each other. It’s...” Steve thinks about the absolute drugging haze that even the barest touch from Tony ignites in him. The way his eyes light up when he’s working on something and makes a break through. The way his body sways to the music when he’s in a groove and has forgotten Steve is in the room. He feels a little like he might cry. “All I want is to be good to him, but I don’t know how.”
“Okay,” Steve says, moving closer to the bar so he can lean his arms on it. It brings him within touching distance of Tony, but neither of them are quite ready for that yet. “Say that’s true. What does Amora gain from keeping me from Bucky?”
“I didn’t!” he snarls, draining his glass in one go. The burn of alcohol down his throat isn’t half as satisfying as he wishes. “I was too caught up in my own shit with Cap and Loki and saving our own asses from the fallout of the lives we
“I don’t know, omega, you seem pretty fucking desperate,” Tony teased, coming up behind him and taking a firm handful of Steve’s ass. “Get on the bed.”
“Eat,” she says, sparing him a telling look, and Tony grins feebly while his stomach reminds him that he’s had nothing but coffee and a smoothie since last night. “There’s pot stickers, too.”
“Do you want to know what I meant, when I called Stephen about consent issues?” Tony says, and Steve swallows. He nods. “When you offered to tonguefuck me in the stairwell? You almost demanded it. You were so disappointed when I wouldn’t let you, and I was so filthy, Steve, and still the very idea of it made my head spin. God, I was so tempted. I touched myself thinking about it, later.”
“You know he doesn’t even like apple pie? I told him it was un-American and he said they didn’t get enough fresh apples and sugar to waste on pies in ration time. Unbelievable.” Tony tries not to laugh as Clint tosses the apple peel in the trash. “Pie isn’t a waste.”
For Natasha, Steve knew, it was probably already too late. Her expression shifting from speculative to determined meant one of two things; she had figured out what the issue was, or she was putting it aside for the good of the mission. Either way, she going to figure it out pretty soon. The Black Widow had never met a secret she couldn’t ferret away from someone.
“Only if it’s already on fire. No causing trouble to save people from trouble. We humans are wise to that kind of thing.”
“Sure, Tony,” he said, and Tony swallowed at the intimacy of the moment. He brought a cracker to Rogers’ mouth, licking his lips reflexively as Rogers ate from his hands. “Thank you.”
It’s a dark path for his mind to wander, and so he tears himself away and heads towards the communal kitchen. Bruce and Steve are both there, heads bent over the Times, and Tony experiences the strangest feeling. His stomach flips over, tightens. He feels nauseated.
In the next room, Tony lets out the sweetest, deepest groan he’s ever heard anyone make. It echoes through the half-open door of the bathroom. It puts Steve’s heart in his throat.
Tony didn’t think they were talking about chess, if they ever had been, and that was rare and strange; in the three years and change he and the Sheriff had been…providing each other comfort, to be delicate about the situation, they hadn’t once talked about it. Tony had gone west to escape the Stark legacy, just put a pin in the map and landed here because it was a good a town as any. Timely had a blacksmith’s forge open, a large enough building by rural standards, and it had been for sale on a major train line no less. Rogers had blown into town almost four years ago now, and they’d ended up tossed together the way strange and unattached men were likely to be. The fact that they’d both left New York during the war, one to create guns and one to wield them, well. There was enough between them to strike up an easy camaraderie, was all. There had been a few drinks, a few shared horrors, a cold night in winter and a pot of coffee to keep away the nightmares. Sometimes, men got lonely. Tony had heard about it enough when he’d been on the front lines, taking part in demonstrations and overseeing shipments to the Union. He hadn’t needed to do it himself, being the great Tony Stark. Women had flocked to him in droves: beautiful, tittering, colourful birds that hung off his arm and chirped sweet things in his ears. It had been nothing, after all. It had all been cheap, fool’s gold. He’d felt he knew what he was getting, with Rogers, but this strange teasing was new. He wasn’t sure how he felt about it, what he made of it.
