"Busy day?"
"I'm fine."
There was one thing, though. John paused at the door. "For what it's worth," he began, quiet into the room, "I appreciate you not saying 'your country needs you'."
"Sherlock Holmes."
"It's alright! Peter stood up to the mark, he's still in there now presenting your work, the board are fully aware of what's happened."
His phone rang.
Mycroft placed the file back on the table beside them. John stared at it. Memories flooded back, of assassins and spies, running – so much running – gunpoint, gunshots, exhilaration, the battlefield of London.
"I would... eat a lot less Chinese. Clean the flat more. Maybe get a dog, or a cat. I like cats."
Instead he said, "Soothing. I like that I'm still able to help people."
Silence.
"Lestrade won't find anything."
There it was. John's fingers tensed and he forced himself to flex them. "...yes."
A year to the day, and John still can't escape the shadow of the past
"Yes he was." John snapped out of his reverie and then regarded her with a smile. "I'm going to send off this blood sample and we'll be able to check for any abnormalities, do the routine tests... if you make an appointment with us for a month's time we'll go over the results, okay? Nothing to worry about."
That wasn't as reassuring as Mycroft wanted it to be. John stood, tucking the file under his arm. Ignorance. What he wouldn't give for it now. Just a taste of it. No confirmation that men in suits passed secrets to others, orchestrating the world from within velvet walls with eighty-year-old whiskey on tap.
"That's not the kind of attention you want. I understand." Mycroft nodded. "As you may be aware, these are trying times. I am difficult to get hold of for a reason."
Annoyance morphed into anger and all John could do was breathe deeply to steady himself. As he left the glass doors of Scotland Yard the fresh air did nothing to quell his temper and he stood for several moments, trying to complete the breathing exercises his therapist had taught him.
Jane removed the mask, wincing. "I'm a little confused myself..."
"Hello Anthea."
John paused, confused by the question. "Yes... ?"
"What did the caller say exactly?" asked Lestrade, picking up his mug.
Peter nodded but didn't move until a few seconds later, sidestepping around John like a cat stalking a mouse. He was tall enough for the comparison, yet John squared his shoulders. No matter if he had pollen up his nose, he wasn't going to show uncertainty in this man's presence.
Or the Queen, depending on who you asked.
"Bad things. Terrible things."
there was silence until he heard faint breathing on the other end. John sighed. "This is very mature. Almost disappointing, you could at least ask me what I'm wearing." More breathing. "Look. I don't know how you got this number but please lose it."
Sherlock seems to take this as his cue to leave and goes to stand up, but John catches his arm.
John kissed him then pulled away, looking into Sherlock's eyes, scanning them for any trace of hesitation or panic. He found none. Just a haze of arousal, longing, a hint of nervous anticipation, and something more significant than all of these that he suspected was mirrored in his own face. Then slowly, carefully, John pushed into Sherlock, a wave of emotions rolling over him. It felt surreal, yet perfect and right and incredible.
Timeline of relevant dates
“No,” John says quickly. He rubs his eyes, struggling to verbalise his thoughts. “I…I can’t. He’s not interested in me in that way…or anyone really, that I’ve ever seen.”
“Mrs Hudson, you’re a saint,” John replies gratefully, pulling her into a half hug and dropping a kiss on her cheek.
John just stares at him and can only imagine the ferocity of his gaze because Sherlock’s face goes from careful indifference to a sudden look of horror, as if he’s only now realising how his words might be interpreted.
The idea regarding Sherlock's scarf was gratuitously stolen from season two of Queer as Folk (US), so credit to whoever came up with that particular piece of heartbreak *fist shake*
“I do,” Mycroft agrees. “But not this time.”
Then he looked back up and their eyes locked in an unspoken exchange of everything that was between them and everything they weren't saying. John cleared his throat and took a sip of his pint.
"It's new for me too."
John considered this for a moment, letting the validity of the words sink into him. He knew it was true, knew that pretty much every issue they'd ever had could have been solved by talking about it. But whilst he was all for that, Sherlock was certainly not the most open of people, to say the least.
"John! I…I was just coming to see you…"
“You are not a freak, Sherlock,” John says, his tone firm and reassuring all at once.
“And the motivation?” Sherlock finishes, “well that’s obvious.”
"John, please," he said, his voice tight with forced restraint.
Sherlock sounds small and vulnerable, and John’s heart swells with love for him.
Sherlock lay still beneath John, his arms wrapped around him and his mind whirring. What the hell was he going to do? He'd very clearly broken John. Shattered him into a thousand pieces. The man who was unbreakable, the man who had stood up for him fiercely more times than he could count, the man who fought and was willing to die for his country, willing to die for Sherlock. And Sherlock had no idea how he was going to put him back together. Had he already started doing that? He wasn't sure. He wasn't sure about any of this and the uncertainty was foreign and monumentally frustrating- is this how normal people felt all the time? His mind still couldn't process John's confession. John loved him? After everything Sherlock had put him through? He wasn't sure how to take it, didn't have any comparable data to be able to solve this puzzle. He closed his eyes and went to his mind palace, searching for the room that held information about love, not surprised to find it much more sparse than others. Names of famous poets, artists and composers floated through his mind, a plethora of romantic comedy titles he'd seen advertised whose singular plot line he had long since deleted in disgust, that love was a motivator, what he understood to be different kinds of love.
"Are you sure?"
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. I didn’t mean…any of what I said back at the flat. I’m truly grateful for everything you’ve done for me and Rosie. I just…”
He awakens panicked, the crushing feeling heavier upon his chest than ever, making him feel like he can’t breathe. He hears himself cry out – an awful, inhuman kind of sound – and suddenly Sherlock is before him, hands on John’s shoulders and concern evident on his face even through John’s panic. John forces himself to suck some air into his burning lungs.
"At several points I had to convince him that it really was the best thing to do…that it was in your best interest and for the greater good."
, taking John’s anger without protest and trying to put him back together when he inevitably fell apart. John remembers being slightly surprised that Sherlock had known just what he needed and had slowly and deliberately wrapped his hand around John’s arm, drawing him close, the long fingers of his other hand coming up to curl around the back of his neck. Sherlock’s presence so close to him had felt right and endlessly reassuring – he was safe here – and he’d finally felt something deep within him release as he’d clutched at Sherlock’s clothing, face buried in his chest, and silently sobbed. Neither of them had spoken any further, Sherlock had simply wrapped both arms around John and stroked soothing circles on his back, his face titled down and towards John’s, lightly brushing against his hair. They stayed that way for what felt like a long time, until John had gotten himself under control. Finally, somewhat reluctantly, they had parted. John had swiped his hand over his face, suddenly self-conscious now that Sherlock could actually see him.
He is however making a particularly strong effort to be as patient and kind to Sherlock as he possibly can, having resolved that he doesn’t want to be that man anymore – the one who lets his own insecurities, guilt and anger play out on those around him. He’d made a promise to Mary that he would be a better man, and he wants to be better than that,
John waits for further explanation, but now Sherlock has abandoned his laptop and is furiously tapping away at his phone, apparently under the impression that the matter is settled.
He found that he wanted to sound angry - he wanted to sound furious - yet somehow all he was managing was weary detachment. Sherlock's head snapped up at his tone, his eyes watching him carefully, mind no doubt racing to deduce John's thoughts, trying to understand them, trying to make it okay.
Sherlock shivered slightly and managed to nod, still grinding against the hand that John had wrapped around him. John moved against Sherlock as he kissed and licked at his neck before opening his mouth wider to suck at the soft flesh, leaving pale red marks. As Sherlock moaned again, his movements increasing in pace, it occurred to John that this wasn't going to last long. But he wasn't going anywhere and they had plenty of time to explore each other, to test each others limits. So he surrendered, capturing Sherlock's lips with his own, devouring Sherlock's moans, thrusting against him, craving more friction, craving release. They came within seconds of one another, John spurred on by Sherlock's strangled cry and his tight grip of John's hair.
“I’m so sorry, Sherlock.”
"Yeah well...so did I. And yet here I am and here you are..."
“Gay?” she supplies.
Sherlock just nodded, his incredible eyes still dark with passion.
"Where the
“It's funny,” Sherlock replies, “because I can face villains like Moriarty and Magnussen without a nerve in sight. But then something like this...I guess I must be human after all.”
John hears the words come out of his mouth but can’t quite believe he’s said them. Of course, he’s been desperately curious since their initial encounter all those years ago, but he never meant to actually ask in such a blunt fashion. Worse still, his tone is cold and accusatory and even he can’t miss that it’s all but dripping with jealousy. He doesn’t remember getting to his feet but now he’s in the kitchen too, standing a few feet away from Sherlock, who has turned to face him, looking baffled. He quickly recovers and responds.
John grins wickedly and attacks Sherlock’s mouth with his own, wrapping a hand around his throat to move his head into the position he wants. Then his hand is in Sherlock’s hair, his fingers stroking, gathering a fistful of curls. Without warning he tugs, forcing Sherlock’s head back and exposing that incredible neck. Sherlock lets out a cry that’s somewhere between pleasure and pain and thrusts urgently towards John’s body.
"Shh," he murmurs into Sherlock's ear, dropping tiny kisses behind his hair and down his neck. Sherlock whimpers, thrusting back against John in frustration, but John has stilled and refuses to move just yet.
The kettle boils and John pours water into the French press then pulls up a seat, noticing that Sherlock seems uncharacteristically hesitant, as though he’s debating with himself about something. Knowing that he’ll get nowhere if he pushes Sherlock, John flicks open the paper and waits for events to take their inevitable course.
They echo their goodnights as Mrs Hudson leaves the flat, closing the door behind her.
The next thing he knows, Sherlock is off and out of the room like a whirlwind, Soames not far behind. Not five minutes have passed before they’re back, accompanied by another student. His large muscular build indicates that he regularly plays sport of some kind, John's bet is on rugby. The man is sullen and looks like he’d rather be anywhere else. Brian’s face goes visibly red as he enters the room.
“It’s Soames, asking our ETA. I’ve advised him we’ll head there right after we’ve checked into the apartment.”
Sherlock's words have reminded him of something else that has been particularly bothering him.
Sherlock said nothing for a moment, still stroking John's hair, holding him tightly.
"Because he's right- he was involved and therefore it will be easier if we explain together," Sherlock said reluctantly.
“Not at all, appreciate it. How’s your shoulder?”
John said nothing and he didn't look up- he knew that if he did his answer would be written all over his face, and he didn't want Mycroft to know just how very much Sherlock meant to him. He sensed rather than saw Mycroft leave the room and descend down the stairs, and when he looked back up Sherlock was standing in the doorway of the kitchen, watching him closely. His expression made John's heart throb painfully.
"You're reputation does you credit, Mr. Holmes," Their client said at last. "It is precisely because of the discretion this case requires, that I have come to you."
The ex-army doctor frowned slightly, stepping closer. They were less than an inch apart when John lifted his hand to press the back of it gently against Sherlock's forehead.
my boyfriend," John hissed through clenched teeth, for they were nearing the front door now.
"If you'd known shagging my brother would give you a perceived edge in
"Thanks for pushing these through, Mycroft," John said, hefting the documents which declared Sherlock and him to be fit foster parents in one hand.
John set his phone down and rolled over, trying to find a comfortable position. The ache that he'd grown so accustomed to, however, was still there, and sleep did not come easy.
Sherlock tilted his head to place his mouth closer to Lestrade's ear, but still kept his face in full view of the cameras as he hissed, "It's bad enough your letting my brother fuck you up the arse, don't let him into your head as well."
~*~*~*~
"Mementos," Sherlock replied, already rifling through one of Mr. McAndrew's book cases. "Every serial killer keeps some kind of memento from their kills. They instill a sense of pride. Given his extensive book collection in this room alone, and the utter lack of evidence the Yard has been able to find against him, it may only be a written record, but that's as good as a confession."
John pressed up into Marcus, pulling him close. Marcus responded enthusiastically, leaning into John while his hands encircled John's shoulders, tracing the muscles underneath his fingertips. Their tongues slid against and around each other, hot and wet. John hummed low in his throat and stepped forward, pushing Marcus into the wall.
"That explains the dirt!" John cried, suddenly understanding. "When Pica presents in pregnant women it's often first detected when they start eating dirt."
"Mycroft?"
John allowed himself an amused smile while he pulled on his own pair of gloves. Sherlock's back was turned, thus creating the illusion of privacy. As entertaining as Sherlock's need for an audience could be, this was bound to be some grisly work. He forced himself to take a breath and focus. The good doctor moved to the other side of the table, and together, they drew back the sheet.
Sherlock shrugged and looked distractedly out the window. "If you say so, though you certainly seemed happy enough when you left, and irritated enough when I cut it short."
?" Ilia asked, drawing their attention back to his stern expression.
Marcus grinned at him. "Glad you like it."
~*~*~*
John didn't think he was foolishly loyal, he just hadn't seen the humor or convenience in being kidnapped and threatened. Still, Mycroft was right. He'd become...attached to Sherlock in ways it was almost uncomfortable to consider. He had determined not three hours ago to put Sherlock out of his mind for now, and here he was ignoring any sense of boundaries or proprieties. Typical.
Harry stiffened and returned his menacing look. "Better than someone who's only been here five minutes, I'd say. You're not Sherlock, Johnny."
John blew out a short, sharp breath, and said, "Just tell me, Mike. I can make my own decisions about what I will and won't do."
It wasn't until they were outside, and an icy rain was pelting his face that Mary's words made it through the fog in his mind. "John, John stop! You're hurting me."
John's cheery, 'I'm home!' died on his lips when he flicked on the lights and there was an answering groan of pain from the sofa. His gaze flew to the crumpled form of the world's only consulting detective huddled in a tight ball under a quilt on the sofa. John didn't even pause to take off his coat as he closed the distance between them and knelt by Sherlock's head.
John's mouth pinched tight in anger, as he was finally able to pry the check from Sherlock's long fingers. He was about to storm off, but Sherlock beat him to it. The taller man threw his Belstaff coat over his shoulders, picked up his note pad, and stalked towards the exit like a great jungle cat. He paused at the door and leaned back, throwing Mike an angry smile. "
Mrs. Wallingford began to shake her head violently, tears spilling down her cheeks. "I'm sorry, Mr. Holmes, I don't know what changed. Andrew wouldn't breathe a word about it... That was the worst part. Andrew always told me
"Sure," Alex replied with an easy smile. He nimbly hopped up on the hospital bed, set his crutches aside, and extended his hand to Laurali. "Alexander Langley, nice to meet you."
They stared at each other for a long, silent moment before Sherlock sighed loudly and muttered, "Fine. I knew this was going to be tedious."
his parents informed him of his true parentage. I assume they intended to discourage further misbehavior by insinuating that a cutting George off would be no hardship for them, as he was not
too! "Goodnight, Mrs. Hudson," Sherlock snapped, rising to close the door firmly in her face. He didn't suspect it would intimidate her, not when she'd been his landlady for this long, but he hoped it would make her leave.
Mary chuckled. "There's no need to be so shy, Dr. Watson. As long as it was consenting adults there's nothing to be ashamed of."
Sherlock leaned forward and lightly brushed the patient's arm with his fingertips to get his attention. The patient gasped and shrank even further into himself, pressing his head down onto his knees. "You want the bugs to go away?" Sherlock asked, his voice so low that none of the others waiting in the hallway were likely to hear.
John's mouth worked open and closed, trying to force the words out past his disbelief. Beside him, Frederick babbled on.
"The wife worries you, obviously," Sherlock interjected once more.
John paled and gripped Sherlock's shoulder tightly. "You don't mean... was he looking at his
John shrugged and the movement turned into a stretch where his legs twined further with Sherlock's. "I'll go apologize in a bit."
My terminally ill father-in-law came to live with, and be cared for by Geoff and myself.
It was Sherlock's turn to look at him pointedly. "The police don't consult amateurs."
Tim shook his head. "I don't know…"
" he had offered.
In less than two minutes Sherlock had checked and rejected every body awaiting its final resting place. The lanky detective stepped back and scanned the drawers, eyes flitting over the numbers, mind racing.
They sat in companionable silence for several long moments before James spoke again. "Do you really have to go back? Every time I see you you're wound tighter than a drum."
John swallowed and nodded, willing the memory away. "I'll meet you there an hour after my shift?"
"You're welcome, dear," she said with a soft smile, leaning over to pat him on the knee once more before making her way back towards the door and down the stairs. John watched her go with a perplexed smile on his face. The idea of Sherlock and him together was so ludicrous... He'd definitely have to write Harry about this, she could probably use a laugh.
"You've always been friendly, John, but you're not an easy man to get to know," Mike countered. He continued confidently, "And even then, you're not what most people would expect. For example, being a doctor and a solider itself is sort of a contradiction. Of all the people I know, I think you've got as good a chance as someone can have against him."
Mycroft arched a thoughtful eyebrow in John's direction. "If you will follow me, I will take you to him."
John stood, and Mary stood with him, looking slightly concerned. John opened his mouth to state his intentions, and to thank her for her kindness in indulging him, but all those words died on his lips when the door to the lab swung open.
Alex's voice carried over to them from the kitchen. "Some canned goods, crisps, nuts, and a few other snacks. I want to have a fully stocked kitchen
Greg nodded. He was vaguely familiar with the resource. "I will. It's a good program?"
Sherlock had blinked and refocused on John, who was still sitting beside him, and gestured at the breakfast he had undoubtedly prepared. Sherlock glanced down at the food, picked up his fork, and began to eat. If he didn't it would only start a row and waste time that could be better spent thinking. He
"Why didn't you
John jumped slightly at the voice from the doorway and turned to see Mary leaning against the doorframe. "It's fine, I like it."
"He's
Sherlock didn't comment, so John assumed he hadn't erred in his summations. He continued. "His methods for killing vary every time, ergo he's not attached to a certain ritualized way of doing things."
Sherlock let out a slow breath, feeling his chest tighten. He'd done the most ill-advisable thing he ever could have done:
"What's wrong?" John asked, his voice low and filled with the threat of violence for any unseen enemy that might be nearby.
"What did you piece together?" Sherlock asked gently. If he pushed too hard she would only shut down.
John pressed against Sherlock, pressing gentle kisses over the marked skin of his neck while his fingers worked. Sherlock shivered as John drew his shirt way, pressing his clothed chest against Sherlock's bare back. Sherlock leaned back as the John's hands slid down his front, slowly undoing the button and zipper of Sherlock's trousers. John didn't remove the trousers right away, instead letting his hands roam and explore while he pressed more sucking kisses against Sherlock's neck.
Sherlock had suffered no trauma or heartache to make him cautious, he'd simply observed while his 'peers' had dived headlong into hormonal driven disasters. Love was a risk not worth taking, the ultimate distraction from what one truly valued. John had loved him, and had only multiple emotional traumas to show for it…
Mary's hand came forward to cover his and John forced himself to look up, blinking quickly. "I'm sorry if I'm bringing up a sore subject." She leaned forward towards him, speaking softly. "I know what it's like, trying to start over again in a way you never expected. Not in exactly the same way," she admitted, "But I know enough to understand the pressure you might feel to put on a good face, both to ease your own pain, and to, by any means necessary, convince the rest of the world to stop looking at you with pity or concern." Her fingers curled around John's wrist and her thumb began to move slowly back and forth over the skin of his arm. "I'll change the topic if you'd like me to, but I wanted you to know that you
"Braindead," Sherlock whispered, his breath quickening.
John smiled back. "Hello yourself," he replied, pulling Sherlock into a proper hug and inhaling deeply. It was good to be home.
John mentally rehearsed his answers in his head, trying to take deep, even breaths. He'd never been a fan of interviews, he doubted anyone was, but this one felt like it had a lot riding on it.
Thank you to everyone who has left comments for, given kudos to, and/or bookmarked or subscribed to this story!  You're support is much appreciated.  ^_^  I hope you enjoy this next installment!
Sherlock turned, looked at John for a moment, and then rolled his eyes. "
caught them in the middle of something.
Molly looked down and grumbled, "No, I suppose not, but still..."
John bit the inside of his cheek and looked away. Sherlock was being ridiculous, and he was not going to encourage him.
John shook his head, thinking of the poor conditions, limited supplies, and the types of conditions such doctors often faced. "No, but a good doctor here at home is always needed."
Margret Werner had been a house wife who wanted an escape, but hadn't seen a way out, so she'd made little worlds in her garden and spent what time she could there. This was the smaller front garden, facing the street, which meant the house
stupid... It wouldn't have changed anything, it would probably have broken up their partnership, and still John would
Turning, he found Sherlock wiping his face and grinning like an idiot. Before the good doctor could speak Sherlock jumped in place, shouting like an over-excited child. "This is the best case I've seen in months!" he declared exuberantly.
Sorry, sorry.  I know this is late!  I really tried not to be late, but work was a 12 hour nightmare yesterday, and I didn't even get home until past the time I would normally post.  I was in such a foul mood and so tired I was almost positive I'd make a mistake, so I decided to wait until morning.
"Thank you," Eva replied softly, and Harry managed to look back up at her. She was smiling. "You don't need to feel sorry for me, though. Understanding what it is makes it easier to deal with. Most days it's actually not this bad. I just needed a bit of a rest."
Sherlock sighed, exasperated. "John, who else would have a greater reason to flee from enemies they fear cannot be stopped, than a spy. Most likely a defected spy, since most governments do at least a passable job of protecting their own spies. I suspected former KGB, a suspicion that was all but confirmed by Ilia's chilly reception of my warm greeting."
testing. It will only make things harder for poor Susan. Let her lay her husband to rest!" Such was the force of his conviction and his anger that Ilia was almost panting.
"I can
John sighed. "Well, not always. I haven't worked for him long, and I've seen him in moments where he just seems like an incredibly intelligent unusual person…but then he opens his mouth." John grimaced, reflecting on some of his more recent memories, and the stranger winced in sympathy.
Sherlock wanted to go himself, and was unsettled by the knowledge that he would've gone if there was any chance he might reach John in time, despite what it might cost him...
"Oh?" Now Sara looked confused and intrigued.
"Yes," Mr. McGregor squeaked, and as soon as he did so, Sherlock released him. He fell back hard on his heels and rubbed the back of his neck, looking dubiously at the world's only consulting detective. "I'll go make the call," he muttered, giving Sherlock a wide birth as he left the room.
Moriarty's expression deepened into an ominous scowl. "It seems our package was not correctly delivered into neutral snow."
John flushed and Mary giggled, stepping back and retrieving her wine glass. "I didn't know it was so easy to make you blush," she said, walking past him towards the kitchen. She paused at the doorway and turned back to him. "I'm sorry; I really didn't mean to push your boundaries. I meant my offer purely for medical assistance. But then you were thinking about it so hard and that line popped into my head, and I couldn't resist." She shrugged. "I'm really a mostly harmless flatmate, but I probably do have the dirtiest mind in London."
John lay down on his bed with an exhausted, but contented, sigh, pulled the covers over himself, and waited for sleep to come.
Molly's eyes narrowed. "Maybe I should take him up on it then. That's how things work in your world, isn't it? Favors bought and paid for without any consideration for real emotional connection."
Mary shrugged. "If you thought your supervisor would investigate it, you would've brought it to him. And if you're wrong, it's a victimless crime. I'm sure Barts can dispose of the medical supplies just as well as Charing Cross can."
Sherlock had assumed his thinking pose, hands pressed together in front of his face, and considered. Their partnership had slowly become more fluid and routine, but that was natural for any flatmates. John had always been attached to him, you didn't shoot cabbies for people you barely knew if you weren't attached, but it had been the thrill of the game, the chase, and the danger that had first attracted John. If anything, Sherlock's general disposition had been a drawback to being flatmates and associates.
John's lips pinched together in a thin, unhappy line. He wished he was able to offer Mr. Brenton better assurances, but all he was able to say, after a bit of thought was, "Sherlock is very...thorough when he's gathering data. Whatever the truth is, you'll have it in its entirety."
then, but who could it be? And why would you use this murder to fake your own death? Clearly you had something to hide, but what?"
John blinked and shook his head, having trouble focusing on her words. "Oh, she's…better. She bounced back fairly quickly." John didn't want to go into details right now, that he suspected Harry's "coma" was a ploy to get him away from Sherlock during a crucial time in whatever case he had been working on all these months. That knowledge could only endanger Mrs. Hudson, as well as slow him down.
, John."
"Did you have a particular place in mind?" John asked, looking over as Marcus started the engine.
Sherlock, who was also laughing, leaned forward and whispered, "It's not even real. Her husband is cheating on her. The real jewelry goes to the mistress."
"You'll be unhappy," Sherlock insisted.
Shrugging, John shut the door and made his way back to his chair. Mycroft just about ran the whole bloody country, maybe the world. No doubt he had some important political matters to attend to, wars to prevent...or start as the case may be. Given how early John had gotten home from the surgery, it was lucky they'd caught each other at all. Perfect timing really.
John pulled his hand back sheepishly, grateful that he hadn't managed to strangle the man before he came to his senses. Even so, the man had not even flinched when John's hand had pushed against his throat... This was bound to be an interesting case.
Sherlock had agreed to take on the case, mostly because of the three dead wives attached to Mr. McAndrew. He and John had reviewed all the information about Mr. McAndrew that Mr. Williams had brought with him, and agreed to speak with his daughter at 10:00am.
James shook his head and chuckled softly. "Those two are a real piece of work." Then, after a small pause he added, "If you ever need a break from the madness, feel free to phone me; I enjoy spending time with you."
John was gone forever, and Sherlock had no one to blame but himself...
John forced himself to reach into his coat pocket and retrieve the damned bottle that had started this little excursion. It was still encased in the bag Molly had placed it in back at Barts. John withdrew the whole package and tossed it at Sherlock. Sherlock caught it, naturally, but his movements were a touch less graceful than usual. John clenched his teeth tightly together to fight the impulse to ask Sherlock if he was alright. The pressure of his tensed muscles was giving John a headache. This whole
Lestrade had both hands slightly raised in a pacifying gesture. "Mr. Werner, Sherlock is the most observant man I've ever met. He doesn't miss anything. That's important for a missing persons case, because our best chance of finding your wife alive is in the first forty-eight hours."
something John could live with.
Not everything is as it seems.
to understand. Sickened and betrayed, John fled from the room, Sherlock's callous smile burned into the back of his mind.
There were a few more prayers at the gravesite, and each person in attendance let fall a handful of dirt into the grave. John couldn't make himself let go of Sherlock's hand, so when it was their turn they walked up together and threw their handfuls of dirt simultaneously.
trade agreement had gone missing from the master vaults of the prime minister. At first Mycroft had been
John gasped and clenched his hands in the bed sheets, his eyes flittered over Sherlock's prone form, lingering on his splayed legs. At that moment, John wished Sherlock wasn't so infuriatingly tall, there was no way he could reach far enough to grasp his remarkably plump arse. Still, there were other things he could do. John leaned down and pressed a wet, open mouthed kiss to the hollow of Sherlock's hip. Sherlock jolted at the unexpected sensation, but quickly calmed, pushing up into John's mouth. John smirked, scraping his teeth over the skin in front of him.
The stranger scanned the paper thoughtfully for a moment, then said, "Listen, I've heard quite a number of stories about Sherlock Holmes being difficult to deal with, and we always have more than we need at the morgue. If you wanted to nick a few supplies, I don't think anyone would really miss them."
Shouted questions filled the air as Sherlock strolled up to the front door, and, nodding to Donovan, who stood guard at the door, reached for the handle. He had just begun to turn the handle when a single query broke through the ambient cacophony:
John's gaze darkened with lust, the irises nearly eclipsed by the pupils, and he gave a small thrust forward. Sherlock opened his mouth willingly, reaching around to grasp John by the hips and pull him closer. "Sherlock," he breathed, reaching forward to caress Sherlock's cheek.
"Sherlock!" John chided. "It's a wonder you're let into any school at all."
Patricia crossed her arms, looked away, and grumbled quietly to herself
"How so?" James asked leaning forward with interest.
"John?" Mary repeated, this time with a firm grip and shake of his shoulder.
The brothers stood by the fireplace staring at Sherlock in silence while their mother prattled on and on about useless details. The young woman, meanwhile was sat on the sofa, looking down, with her hands folded in her lap. She was quiet in a way that had more to do with personality than situation. Good. The quiet ones were usually the most observant. Sherlock's gaze flickered to her elder brothers, who had, once or twice, glanced meaningfully in her direction. Unfortunately, the quiet ones also tended to be poorly treated. Now that he had family dynamics out of the way, it was time to get to the important details.
Harriet looked at him dubiously for a moment before returning her gaze to the screen. She smiled despite herself. "They
this animal shelter related to the case.
The spider he was after wasn't untouchable, but they were immaculate. All of Sherlock's attempts to follow the web back to the originator had failed, regardless of how subtle. Every time there was the slightest hint that anyone might be closing in the spider severed its line and disappeared. With more time he could move slowly, pen this spider in its own traps, but the time for subtlety was over.
This was hardly his first

Mycroft raised an eyebrow and was silent for a long moment. "Why does his return interest you?"

the environment and the people, especially after the performance, when the dancers would mingle with the patrons and sign autographs. The lanky bastard had yet to point out exactly what information he was hoping to obtain, but John hoped it would be useful. Especially considering...
…and waited…
Since his agreement with Nikki, Sherlock had not had the time to hack Charing Cross Hospital's security cameras and watch John's shifts as much as he had previously been doing. As such, it was a complete surprise when John, and his female flatmate, whom Sherlock now knew went by the name 'Mary,' rounded the corner and made straight for 221 B. They were coming for him, they had a case, and John was
John frowned worriedly at his flatmate. He hadn't even turned his head to watch their client leave. That, in and of itself wasn't particularly concerning, because Sherlock paid only the barest minimum of attention to societal norms. Still, John had only ever seen him be wrong once before, when he had lost his bet. And he
Well, this was new.
Living in England for the majority of his life, John was more than familiar with ruins. Abandoned, crumbling buildings always made an impression, and the burnt out husk of the former McAndrew house was especially eerie. It was like the remains of the house, the trees that grew around it, the very earth remembered and mourned the tragic death of an innocent woman.
~*~*~*~
Mycroft's face grew serious. "I wanted you to focus on a cure."
"Can you hear me?" John nearly jumped again, because, thanks to the ear piece, Sherlock's voice was directly in his ear.
The good doctor looked up and was unsurprised to find Sherlock intently focused on her neck, or what remained of it.
Greg hesitated for a moment before adding, "I think he solved that case for
Mary sipped her wine before replying. "The reason I'm not running from love, is only because I accept that there is no way Sean will ever come back to me, not in this life. If there was even the smallest chance of getting him back, nothing in the world would stop me." Mary pinned him with an intense look and finished, "Love is worth it. Love is
Sherlock eased up a bit pressure wise and maneuvered so he was sitting on the couch with John's legs over his lap. "Stay where you are," Sherlock insisted and his fingers continued to massage John's leg.
It was just one word, but it help a powerful demand:
angry, but even more relived.
John nodded. "First and last time, I understand."
work... She was a much better match for John than he'd realized. He just had to convince her to abandon any plans she had about encouraging a reconciliation between himself and John, and time would do the rest...
He was not bereft of his contempt for mundane maintenance of his transport, nor had he lost his vigor for winning an argument. Ultimately, giving in was easier than fighting. It took less time, and he had so little time left... It was a logical and economic use of his resources to let John have his way.
his suspicions had been right. She'd found something, something damning, and now he really would have to do something about it.
John started, and grasped Sherlock's hands in his. "Really? You're sure?"
John shrugged. "Probably because of my feelings for you. Aren't you always lecturing me about how the words people use or don't use give them away?" Sherlock chuckled softly and John smiled. "This is still a partnership, Sherlock. What do
Sherlock nodded. "Very sure."
Trigger Warning:  Mentions of withdrawal from alcohol and depressed thoughts.  Please be safe.
"And the letter?" John pressed again, impatient to see how everything connected.
Sherlock saw them approaching by accident. He had been standing close to the window, practicing. Never mind that he knew every piece of Swan Lake by heart, never mind that he had rehearsal later today before tonight's performance; there was solace in the music, at least for him. He'd had to be picker with the cases he selected from Lestrade, and any experiments he tried, while Nikki's arm was healing. For the first time in his life he had a regular schedule he was willingly adhering to, and he intended to keep his word. It was… strange.
John laughed, and his arms closed around Marcus's middle. "In a few minutes maybe."
As a doctor, John couldn't disagree. As a person, he'd never been able to sit through someone massaging a cramp away. He struggled reflexively, but Sherlock held him down with a strength that was constantly surprising the ex-army doctor.
Title says it all.  ^_^
John wasn't quite sure how to respond to that, so he remained silent. He wasn't really in the habit of one night stands, and he wasn't sure what to think about his current situation. He jumped slightly when he felt another hand take his. He glanced over and found Marcus sparing him as long a glance as traffic would allow.
One mystery Sherlock would never understand was school. Well that was a lie, give him a few weeks and he’ll probably figure it out. What he was really baffled by was why Mycroft had sent him to one. He’d been homeschooled his entire life but apparently by moving in with Mycroft he’d also agreed to go to regular school. Regular school was going to be undoubtedly boring. Sherlock wasn’t just a ‘gifted student’ he was an embodiment of intelligence. The school wouldn’t have allowed him to join GCSE year otherwise, which was hilarious. He could learn the entire GCSE curriculum in one term. He should probably have them thank him in advance for boasting the school’s grade average.
John wakes up feeling like he’s going to throw up again. How did it get so much worse? He lets out an inhuman groan. Fuck, it’s like he’s being stabbed. He rolls onto his side, only barely registering the fact he’s woken up somewhere different from where he fell asleep. He feels so hot, he kicks off the blanket that was on top of him (did he put that there?).
“I am completely fine Sherlock!” John yelled, “and even if I wasn’t why should it matter to you.” The detective rolled his eyes like John was a toddler throwing a tantrum.
Molly and Irene are 16
I hope you enjoyed this first chapter! I really admire people who write really long slow burns because I get bored so easily. All critisim is welcome! This is only my second fanfiction and my very first for the Sherlock fandom.
“Yes!”
“Do you have a laptop with you?” John asked, trying his best to ignore how pressed together they were.
“Could I do a piece on true crime?” John could have reacted to that in many ways: disgust, confusion, even anger and it wouldn’t have surprised Sherlock but his smile and kind ‘if that’s what you want’ struck Sherlock. Most people found his little obsession with unique and unsolvable murders worrying or even scary but John was acting as if he had requested to write about gardening or something equally mundane.
“Sherlock you...” John quickly looked away from him like he was embarrassed by what he had to say, “you took care of me yesterday. You were nicer to me than anyone has been in a while which is odd because you’re usually an utter prick. And it made me realise something. Sherlock, I care about you.”
“Well, Sherly, you should watch where you decide to stand next time. People don’t like people who get in their way,” with that he left with the rest of his friends. Well, it seemed all the mindless teen dramas Sherlock had watched to prepare himself for high school were right. The mean bully who picked on the new kid was a real thing that happened. At least the lesson would be enjoyable.
“I know.”
John breaks away from the kiss to catch his breath and the second he does Sherlock goes for his neck, causing John to let out an embarrassing moan.
“No.” Please be the right answer.
“You know?” John questioned, walking beside him.
Sherlock finds himself really enjoying the club and the company of the people in it.
Why was he so fond? Sherlock was smart (obviously) and he gave John the opportunity to jump back into the danger and action he’d missed so much but it was more than that. John needed him. He needed to know Sherlock was okay, needed to tell him how amazing he was, needed to be by Sherlock’s side through every twist and turn it brought. When has he ever felt like that about anyone?
The eggs Sherlock is frying look a bit too burnt to be considered edible. He’s hoping bacon is at least salvageable. As Sherlock mentally curses the fact that cooking is so much harder than forensic science he hears a creak coming from John’s bedroom. He must finally be awake.
“Alright, I’ll join journalism.”
“I will find an interesting case for the paper then.”
“It’s my table, John, and I decide I don’t care about ring marks.”
“That’s fine, completely fine. We can just share,” John gave him a sweet smile that Sherlock couldn’t resist to return, “so in journalism club we write things for the school paper. Irene, there in the leather jacket, writes the gossip column. That feature is quite infamous actually, I mean, you can guess why. One too many articles about the school staff’s ‘personal affairs’ has caused many problems but it’s our most popular segment so, what can you do? Molly does science and medicine which includes reporting on new discoveries in those fields and giving the student body advice for anonymous questions they write in. Lots of variety. Do either of those options tickle your fancy?” Sherlock thought for a second. He couldn’t imagine himself writing about the school gossip especially considering how much of it would go over his head, whilst Sherlock didn’t like admitting his short-comings he was aware of his social ineptitude. Science was something Sherlock knew a lot more and had an interest in but writing page upon page about sounded dull, he always preferred experiments over theories.
“Yeah,” John replied, his voice far away. Something was bothering him, Sherlock knew all his physical ticks and currently the way he was licking his lower lip and glancing to the door like he may need to map out an escape route, that was nervous John ticks. Typically he’d leave it alone but Sherlock felt he’d breach some new ground yesterday with John, ground that meant he could ask.
Sherlock was not one to be plagued by sentiment. He was a freak, he’d never needed someone, needing someone was a liability. But John… needing John wasn’t sentiment, it was survival. That’s why he couldn’t let John come to the scene when he was clearly ill, survival was why he was staying here, watching the doctor who can’t seem to take care of himself. John snores when he sleeps, it’s loud but Sherlock can’t imagine it would ever get annoying. That chair isn’t comfortable to sleep on, Sherlock knows from experience. He should move John to the couch. That’s what someone else would do in this situation right? Though perhaps he’d be crossing some sort of male platonic boundary to pick up John while he’s asleep. These rules are so annoying.
“Hello John! You brought us a new recruit then?” Said the english teacher, what was his name?
“And you can’t go without me so I’m-”
He was careful not to wake John as he placed him down. John was almost as bad as him when it came to getting sleep. Maybe the reason the two of them made a good pair was because they were both as bad as the other.
John could get used to this more agreeable Sherlock
“Your books clearly state your name,” John looked at the books in his hand then at Sherlock giving him an amused smile. Maybe Journalism was the right choice.
John really hoped he hadn’t just cocked this whole thing up. He hadn’t meant to tell Sherlock his feelings, he’d only just realized them himself. It just felt natural to say it, to admit Sherlock was more than just a friend to him. Still he couldn’t bring himself to look at his flatmate now so instead he made very intense eye contact with the mug he was drying.
Thank you again for reading!!!!
“I care about you so much more than a friend, Sherlock.” A timid smile was on John’s face as he said it. A hundred different thoughts were running through Sherlock’s head, thousands of possibilities lay before him but there was only one path Sherlock wanted to go down. He supposed there was no better time to trust his ability to read people.
“Do any of your rugby friends do it?” John winced.
“Yes, however I think eggs might be off the metaphorical table.”
Shit… he was in love with Sherlock Holmes.
“Thank you, could you tell me your name again? I seem to have deleted it,” Sherlock said rather tactlessly though this did not seem to faze the teacher as he let out a small chuckle.
“John, I can practically hear you overthinking. Could you possibly snap out of it so I can ask to kiss you?” What!
“You can’t come, John, you’ll vomit on all the evidence.”
John led Sherlock to a small classroom where journalism was held. The room was definitely out of the way, in fact it seemed to have originally been a storage room of some kind. There were three other people in the room, one of them was his english teacher who he was less than pleased to see; the other two were girls he hadn’t seen yet. One was wearing a purple jumper over her uniform and the other a leather jacket. They both appeared to be friends, chatting and laughing with each other.
“Not today sorry.”
When he comes back Sherlock feels his forehead and looks pleased.
Part of the reason I wrote this so quickly was because I had been planning on using my spare time to read a book but I couldn’t find a nice love story between two girls and instead settled on writing my own little love story. For any fellow wlw ladies, don’t worry, the lesbians will arrive eventually in this story but this is supposed to be a slow burn so patience is key.
“Sherlock!” John gasps. “Should we maybe take this somewhere that’s not the kitchen?” Sherlock looked at John wide eyed almost like he couldn’t quite believe this was happening. John couldn’t blame him, he could hardly believe this was happening either.
It seemed extra activities weren’t very popular here. On Monday there were only five possible options according to the notice board: dance, hockey, swimming, calligraphy and journalism. The sporting activities (including dance) were definitely a no, calligraphy was simply dull and he had no need for journalism. Sherlock continued stand indecisively in front of the board until someone came up to him.
“Great! We can walk together. I’m John by the way,” he stuck out his free hand which Sherlock ignored completely in favour of walking in the direction he believed journalism to be.
“You should use a coaster.”
Sherlock and John: 16
“No, I don’t.”
The sleek black car pulled up to the large concrete mass that Sherlock was trapped in for the next year. It was a daunting sight really, teenagers festering in every area around the building and all of them were staring. Does no on drive to school here? Perhaps it was one of those ‘unspoken rules’ Sherlock could never remember.
“Hello again Sherlock I’m glad to see you again. I have a lot of marking to do so these three will have to show you the ropes for the time being.”
“You’re making breakfast?” John yawns as he says it and takes a seat at the kitchen table that Sherlock cleaned at 5am this morning.
“A car will come to pick you up at four,” said the driver.
“I looked up your symptoms and judging from your current temperature you’re nearing the end of it. You need to be drinking a lot of water at this time of course and whilst you may currently feel hesitant to eat anything after you’ve just been sick but there is always the concern that now your stomach is empty so I can make you-”
Mr Lestrade 24
I’m trying to get myself more organised with this story and have even planned the next few chapters. I do like writing this a lot and have quite the plan for where I want this to go.
“Sherlock,” the detective stopped pacing and turned to look at John, “thank you.”
Waking up the next morning John was pleased to find he didn’t feel like he was on fire or that he needed to run to the bathroom to avoid getting sick on his bedsheets. Definitely an improvement from yesterday. Thinking of yesterday there was only one thing that remained clear about it, through the fever and vomiting there was the clear image of Sherlock’s worry and his care for John. Yesterday John might have simply accepted it and moved on, too preoccupied with his own issue, but today he couldn’t. What Sherlock had done for him yesterday wasn’t what a self-congratulating, obsessive, insensitive prick would do. Not that Sherlock was a prick. Well, he was but he was a prick John was fond of. He was really, that is, he's fond of Sherlock. He wouldn’t have moved him with the man, or put up with his cryptic plans, or his constant need to be smarter than anyone else in the room if he wasn’t a bit fond of the detective.
letter! Give it back!"
"When William returned to the United Kingdom his father made him work jobs well below his pay grade. He stated as a janitor, doing the worst jobs for the longest hours and the least pay. The long hours didn't change when William was finally allowed to work in a medical position. It appears his father spent several years promoting interns into positions where they would supervise his son. Samuel was presumably trying to show William his place, honestly people are so predictable. Six months after William was finally allowed to work alongside his father, Samuel died, unexpectedly. The death was ruled an accidental overdose of prescription medication. Samuel was seventy two at the time, and his eyes as well as his attention were going. William assumed his father's responsibilities, and as far as I can tell, no one investigated the matter any further."
John nodded. He'd never suffered migraines, but, being a doctor, he had an intimate knowledge of how they could impact a life. He opened his mouth to say 'I'm sorry,' but thought better of it when he caught Mary's expression. She'd brushed off his last apology. She didn't seem like a woman who needed or appreciated sympathy. Instead he said, "This kind of lighting is better for your circadian rhythm anyway."
It hadn't gotten involved to solve a case, not to try to help Susan.
Sherlock let the silence speak for him and saw John's expression harden. When John spoke again his voice was thick with emotion. "After everything?" That was John to a fault. Loyal, patient, trusting... Sherlock's phone buzzed faintly for the final time.
A gentle shake finally broke him out of his reverie. "John?"
Sometimes this did work, with small harems developing, but Sherlock had always wondered if those groups were really satisfied, or if the military had forced them to give such statements. Of course bonded groups of more than two developed in nature, and arranged/sudden bonding could work, but these particular set of circumstances always left Sherlock dubious. Bonding wasn't mandatory for sex, of course, but it was often chosen when a child was on the way.
to think about how much
Lauren's sharp gaze shifted to John, who started to nod and added, "As far as I can tell it's all true. Sherlock's almost never wrong. There were a dozen dogs at the house, he claims to run his own, small shelter."
John blinked and half turned, until he was lying on his side as opposed to his stomach.
John looked away for a moment and swallowed. He thought of Harry's letter, and his deal with Sherlock and replied. "Part of the reason, anyways."
the case, as I am still very much alive, chemical reactions are easily synthesized."
John opened his mouth to reply but stopped short as Nikki's companion came into view. He stiffened, scrambling to gather his wits and rush towards the exit before he could be seen, but it was too late. Familiar light blue eyes looked up and locked him in place from across the room.
. It provided plenty of distance and no form of actual communication. Sherlock
Movement and a small noise drew John's attention to the sofa in the far corner, and he realized he needn't have been so concerned about sound; Mary was already awake. She sat huddled into the corner of the sofa with her legs drawn up against her chest. She was still in her pajama t-shirt and trousers, and she'd turned the fireplace on. She had her arms around her legs and her chin resting on her knees; she looked upset. John stepped backwards, hoping to slip back into his room before he disturbed her. As he did so the wooden floor creaked under his weight, alerting Mary to his presence.
The voice on the other end of the phone was sultry and smug, and nothing at all like Ms. Adeline's' voice. There was more to this than simple blackmail, and he would get to the bottom of it.
Marcus's breath was coming in ragged pants, his head was thrown back into the mattress, Marcus let out a long, low moan, and his movements became unsteady as pleasure ripped through him. John watched Marcus's face contort and long white ropes paint their chests before he cursed softly, pressing hard into Marcus as his own orgasm was pulled from him. They slumped against each other, breathing hard.
Marcus needed no more invitation, but immediately leaned over John, pushing him down with a hand on John's chest. Once John was prone, Marcus reached for his trousers and pants, urging John to lift his hips so the garments could be discarded.
The world's only consulting detective whirled out of his bedroom followed by an ominous cloud of smoke. Despite John's dubious look, the smoke dissipated rapidly. Sherlock peeled safety goggles off his head and studied the man his blogger had brought with him.
The questions went on like that for a while.
that Sherlock had all these medical supplies just sitting around the flat..
John carefully sealed the envelope and scrawled Alexander's name on the front. He propped it up by his computer. In the days that followed, as the letter sat there and waited for Mycroft to retrieve it, John would look over at it periodically, smile, and wish again for Alexander's safe return home.
"It's not about Sherlock anymore, from what I have overheard."
It didn't matter what happened to him, if he was killed at the end of everything it would almost be a blessing. Before he died, though, he would end every single person that had ever contributed to his suffering. He wasn't after petty rivalries, those had all been burned away by his greater focus. A very specific group of people had contributed significantly to his suffering, and he was in the process of returning the favor. Several people were already dead thanks to his careful planning.
"Did you not get in?" Sherlock asked, concern and sympathy etched on his classic features.
John sat on the couch in 221B Baker Street with his eyes closed and his head in his hands.  He wasn't sure he could blame this colossal headache on Sherlock, but he was going to try.
~*~*~*~
Once he had returned Sherlock had surprised Lestrade in a parking garage. The older man had just lifted a cigarette to his lips and by way of greeting Sherlock had stepped out of the shadows and said, "Those things will kill you."
The corner of Sherlock's cupid's bow lips quirked upwards in something that was part smirk and part sneer. He strode forward, and as John did not back away, or even flinch; they were inches apart in moments. "Then take this message back to the Yard with you. I don't have
"It is very kind for you to allow us to re-examine the body," the ex-army doctor continued, elbowing his flatmate sharply in the ribs in the hopes that he would stop fidgeting.
These kind actions, if one could really call them kind, given his true motivations and the pain they also caused, wouldn't fix things. They wouldn't fix
Sherlock arched an eyebrow. "Yes, but there can be a complete dearth of really
John moved to the windows in the sitting room, and watched the street to make sure Mycroft had left, before looking at the letter in his hands once more. A smile he couldn't quite help crept onto his face as he studied his first initial on the front of the envelope. Taking up Sherlock's letter opener, John carefully tore open the envelope, pulled out the letter, and began to read:
"I'm sorry?" Mr. Walker asked, turning around to face Sherlock once the door was open.
of this... John slid his and down Sherlock's good arm, and squeezed his hand. "It will be okay." And Sherlock, despite all of the obvious contradictions to that statement, all the statistics that were against them, believed him, because John Watson was the type of man who wouldn't stop until he could
Greg chuckled. "Yeah, Sherlock is one of a kind. How long have you known him?"
was the cause of the sleepless nights.
James nodded, a wry smile playing on his lips. "If you ever want to work at St. Barts, teaching, or in the morgue, I'd be happy to put in a good word for you. You were brilliant helping out with that autopsy."
He hated it when patients could see that he was in pain. He hated when anyone could see him in pain, really. He wasn't injured, just dealing with the fall out of an old wound, long healed, and he didn't like other people making a fuss. He wasn't as uncooperative a patient as Sherlock could be, but doctors didn't make good patients in general; it wasn't the role they were comfortable with.
The ex-army doctored rolled his eyes helplessly at the sky and muttered, "Right behind you," before scrambling up and in.
," Sherlock replied. "I've been able to deduce much of your story, the important matters as they pertain to this case anyway. If you will fill in the Detective Inspector here, he may be able to assist you."
John brought his hands back up to the warm skin of Marcus's waist, easing the fabric of his trousers over his hips. "I prefer to top," John murmured before inching forward and taking Marcus's earlobe between his teeth.
John hummed acknowledgement while he stirred the sauce. "Is there anything else I should be looking after besides this sauce?"
a private individual… Still, there was much less physical risk to himself. Setting his mouth in a determined line, he turned to face his friend and asked, "What's his name?"
sleep? John had his doubts. They'd had a row just the other day when he'd tried to get Sherlock to
"I haven't done anything differently," John protested, "I've made a point of that."
As the bow left the strings for the final time Sherlock found his breathing had elevated, and he had to blink open his eyes, not remembering when he had closed them. Mr. Walker, the surly and self-serving director stood off to the side, leaning against his desk. Whatever scheme or power play he had been about to attempt had died on his lips as Sherlock began to play. Observing Mr. Walker now, Sherlock found him not exactly moved by Sherlock's rendition of the closing piece, but definitely affected. He frowned, and most likely wanted to protest that Sherlock's suggested arrangement to preserve Nikki's seat would not work, but he did not. At length, and after a few failed attempts to speak, he managed to force out, "That…will do."
"Well done you two," John said, stepping into the room with a smile. "It looks like your recovery is coming along nicely, Nikki," John observed, nodding towards her arm.
When they had arrived, he had insisted that Sherlock wait outside. He may, more or less, control John's life after this, but he had
They pulled up to an elegant looking white building with a sign that proclaimed it to be, "Nines." Marcus came to a stop right out front and exited the car, passing his keys to a waiting valet. John joined Marcus and together they walked inside.
"I am not a heartless man," the nobleman assured him, reading John's disquiet in his posture and frequent glances towards the theater. "I
John was halfway up the steps when he heard the gunfire. His quick pace became a charge as he surged up towards trouble. He had
I know I've left you at a bit of a cliff hanger for a while. There will be resolution, I promise! ...eventually :)
"Who is Travis's former lover?" John asked. There was such a long interval of silence that John felt compelled to ask again, turning Sherlock in his arms to face him. "Sherlock, who are they?"
Sherlock is Sherlock, and pays the price for it.
"You don't need to go through this alone, Sherlock," John murmured.
of your business."
John felt an impulse to look away, but forced his eyes to remain on James's face as he spoke. As sorry as he was to hurt his friend, his silence would only result in more damage. "I shouldn't have let you kiss me." James stilled, but John pressed on. "You've been a good friend to me, and perhaps I've leaned on you too much, especially after you told me how you felt. It was wrong of me to abuse your affections like that, and I apologize."
John's face remained rigid with anger and disgust, and Sherlock smiled coyly. "Well?" Sherlock continued. "Have I convinced you?"
"Like that's ever stopped us before," John replied, kissing, and nibbling his way down Sherlock's chest.
"One should never underestimate the power of a sibling rivalry," James countered, taking another bite of his sandwich."
His hands were scratched from his careless searching, and some of those scratches were starting to bleed, but it didn't matter. It was only transport, transport which would wither and fade away very shortly, whether or not he managed to accomplish his final goal. Even more of a reason to keep going.
into a case. A domestic violence case with nothing particularly unusual about it. As far as I can tell he was just walking down the street, apparently Mrs. Hudson had convinced him to get the shopping for her, when he deduced what was happening and manipulated the situation until the woman was willing to press charges."
limits.
"She's your sister," Sherlock muttered, when he could speak again. "This arrangement has always been about her." He could hear John's shoulder stiffen inside his horrid jumper.

a heart condition and enough business sense to perfectly understand his position. The strain would have been too much for younger men...
Mrs. Hudson set her own cup down and lifted the teapot to refill Sherlock's, all the while sending him a look that clearly communicated she was neither fooled nor amused.
Greg glared at his friend. "That's not what I meant, Sherlock. I meant what she's about to go through."
Four sets of footfalls followed, two human, two canine. Wiggins spat and hissed, "Wankers!" After the men who'd assaulted him. They'd taken the coat with them, as Sherlock suspected they might.
"I scrambled down the hill and turned the body over. It was another student, given the books strewn on the ground not far from him. I checked his legs and found two puncture marks just above his right ankle. Adders, as you know, aren't usually fatal, but this was a bad bite, and he was showing signs of an acute allergic reaction. I called campus security and he was immediately taken to hospital."
...and he didn't have to wait here. If Sherlock...if Alexander...if he returned to London, he would find John no matter where he was.
"Originally I threatened to expose his affair with his secretary," Sherlock explained.
John scoffed and continued to stare resolutely out the window. What did any of them know about healthy? He still worked, did his chores, read a book now and then. No book could ever be as good as a case, but it helped.
John was gone.
"Jesus you are such a child."
John put the letter down and sighed, almost hating himself for wanting to write back as badly as he did. Was he that lonely? Then again, how lonely must Alexander be? John knew it was easy to trust someone faceless and sympathetic... but if he just kept to irrelevant details, especially concerning himself, where would the harm be. Also, Alexander had put himself out there, a little. If what he said was true, John and Mycroft may be the only two people who knew Alexander was still alive.
~*~*~*~
Mary came with him. It hadn't been discussed or planned. John had simply looked up from the bottle Molly had handed him and shared a look with Mary that decided everything. Perhaps John should have argued, but he couldn't make himself want to. Mary was a good friend and it felt right to have this connection to his new life follow him back to visit the ghosts of his old life. John didn't want to go back, but now he had to, and Mary could be an anchor for him, a point of focus to prevent any foolish temptations.
, no!"
The good doctor moved silently up the stairs, locked his letter from Harry in the trunk at the foot of his bed, and fetched some medicine. He was just placing two tablets and a glass of water on the coffee table when his phone buzzed. John pulled it out of his pocket and smiled when he saw a text from James.
Sherlock spun and saw John pulling the other man back into a sleepers hold. Sherlock stepped forward and relieved the orderly of yet another syringe full of sedatives. Jamming the needle home Sherlock pushed half the dose into the man's veins. There was twenty seconds of intense struggle before the orderly slumped in John's arms, and John eased him back onto the gurney.
Lestrade and John were with him; they were currently walking up to a non-descript house in the suburbs of London. Lestrade had been called in because of suspected kidnapping, which widened the usual range of search. Sherlock scanned the front of the house with disgust. Everything was tediously typical and boring. The front gardens were neatly kept, the house was in good repair, and well within the means of a middle class family.
Many thanks to all those who have left reviews, favorited, and/or followed this story!  ^_^  You're support makes me smile even on the most wretched work days.
"Her mother's family would have stopped the release of those letters, only they didn't know about them. Her mother had them placed in a safe deposit box in Switzerland so that, even if her family discovered what she had done, they would have no access to the letters."
"Politics is a battlefield I have no taste for," John replied, "so we're even there."
The choppy sound of helicopter blades slicing through the air began to echo towards them, the sound reverberating off of the enclosed space around them. The woman lifted her face up to the sky and smiled. "That would be Mycroft, punctual as always".
"Do you?" Mary asked leaning over his shoulder. "Because from here it looks like you're still fighting the first layers of firewall on a temperamental system, trying desperately to avoid the self-destruction protocols."
Sherlock nodded, gathered his supplies, and followed her. She silently rung up his items and when she was done Sherlock handed over his card, never saying a word back to her. She was chatting softly to him in some vague effort to comfort or console him, and it was infuriating. This irritation was compounded by the fact that he refrained from snapping at the clerk only because John's frequent and varied admonishments about such behavior were ringing in his head.
"I know it won't change anything, but I can't help it," Mary confessed. "I want to fix things, make things better."
They had come to attend the imminent birth of their first grandchild, and to help Laurali and Alex in their first few weeks of parenthood. It was strange coming back to the place where it all began, so many years ago. John, much to his chagrin, was balding now, and needed glasses. Sherlock, who would never go bald, now had grey hair streaked with black.
Mr. Brenton nodded grimly, and focused on his tea. He seemed a great deal calmer now that he'd gotten his story off of his chest. They sat together in companionable silence for a few moments before a sharp cry of, "Blood!" from the kitchen disturbed the peace. They both jumped and winced as they spilled hot tea over their hands. Before they had a chance to properly set their mugs down, Sherlock charged into the room with an oddly colored solution in a beaker.
"What?" John asked again, his curiosity finally getting the better of him.
"What was your father
Greg nodded. "He'll still surprise you in a year, trust me. Maybe even in a decade." John groaned internally and followed Greg and Sherlock out the door.
"Naturally," Sherlock replied. "You played your part very well, not too much conversation, and not too little. That made it easy for me to listen in to their conversation. They were discreet, naturally, but I heard mention of a funeral that is to take place tomorrow, and each of the individuals at Anna's table were utterly delighted at the idea. Not one sign of regret, mourning, or boredom from any of them. I think they may have killed Anna and be ridding themselves of the evidence."
Wiggins nodded, pulling on the Belstaff with a look of intense determination.
Thank you to everyone who has read, commented on, and/or given kudos to this story.  Your support is much appreciated.  ^_^
." Sherlock had agreed.
John's hand shook as he put in writing the one thing he never wanted to be true. His handwriting smudged and shook with his hand, but it was still legible. Good. John didn't think he could write that down again.
"William's been here," Sherlock declared, pointing at the floor. "There are trace patterns of shoes too expensive for any simple maintenance staff to afford." Sherlock turned and faced two large steel doors, which seemed to be muffling and incessant humming noise. Sherlock pushed at one of the doors and it swung open with only minimal resistance. The room inside was dimly lit, filled large metal rectangles and cylinders. Some had faintly glowing buttons, and the humming was definitely louder now. "This is part of the heating, cooling, and ventilation system," Sherlock mused, scanning the room.
"Yes, Detective Inspector Lestrade mentioned that." Mr. Mcgregor glanced at Sherlock, who looked as though he was ready to come out of his skin with impatience. "Well, I won't keep you any longer, let me show you the facilities."
any easier. There was nothing left of her face, the skull was badly misshapen, and the fractures throughout her skeleton contorted her flesh into unnatural angles. Mrs. Dwight truly appeared
TRIGGER WARNING: Mentions of Domestic Violence
The rest of John's thoughts remained unspoken but they clung to his mind like cold honey... One surly Detective Inspector, and one very special and unique consulting detective...
: Pleas Unspoken
Sherlock didn't look like he'd been expecting to see John, he paled and his eyes widened with remarkable believability, but John knew firsthand the extent of Sherlock's acting abilities. Suddenly every moment of the evening, and all those leading up to it where in question. How much was an accident, and how much had been planned? This was obviously for a case, it
John nodded. "She should make a full recovery. She's very lucky. Did I tell you someone is covering her seat for her while she's healing?"
be amenable to building a relationship that wasn't based on animosity?
He could just make out Sherlock's brow arching in the dim light. "Your favorite carol. Very well."
"Most likely," I had started to review staff files when I found that you were now working there."
Greg nodded. "Mycroft had one implanted during one of Sherlock's overdoses, just under the skin, like you do with pets."
"Lies," John murmured with a small smile, "that's just what you want people to think." Both of John's hands came up to surround Sherlock's rubbing it gently to try to improve circulation. The good doctor paused and reached for Sherlock's other hand, frowning when he found it just as cold. He held both hands then, rubbed them both, before finally lifting them both up, close to his mouth and expelling a few hot breaths over the fingertips. John's eyes locked with Sherlock's as he breathed warmth back into his extremities.
John frowned. "I'm sorry."
Sherlock was not in the least deterred from his course of action. Of course he had heard John, his ears still worked. It was merely irrelevant data and immediately dismissed. The ring
Sherlock scooted around him and held the door for him with a smug smile. "Really? Do you kiss all the men that aren't your boyfriend?"
"Wrong!" Sherlock declared loudly, throwing the paper he had been reading violently down onto the floor. "Idiots!"
John pushed playfully at Sherlock's shoulder, but he did not let go of Sherlock's waist with his other hand so the movement was largely ineffective. They had been reunited for a few months now, and things were definitely not the same. In John's opinion they were better. His old bedroom had been converted for storage, leaving the rest of the flat marginally less cluttered. Sherlock and he were back to working cases, though only marginally, as Nikki was still not cleared to return to work. John had talked with Sherlock about his commitment to Nikki, and many other things that had occurred during their separation. As far as John could tell, Mycroft's presumptions about Sherlock's feelings and actions, had been more or less correct.
was definitely going to be a problem.

The priest paused for a moment, looking out over his small congregation then lifted his arms and face up. "Dear God, look upon Rosamund, deliver her and set her free from every bond, that she may rest in your arms. Reveal your truth to those who are bereaved, so that they may meet the days ahead in thy peace. Grant us the grace to entrust Rosamund to thy never-failing love, and remember her according to the love which she has bestowed upon us in her lifetime. Rest eternal grant to her, and let perpetual light shine in her. May she forever live in your light, as she lives in our hearts."
John frowned as he considered the fact that they'd be more or less on their own. Mycroft had more leeway to act around, or sometimes outside of, the law considering his position, but this was hardly an international case, or a case of national security. Yes many powerful medical organizations could lose people today if they didn't make it in time, but this didn't strike John as a case where Mycroft would force his way in, and he couldn't remember Sherlock every willingly tolerating Mycroft butting in on a case.
Sherlock's eyes flittered over the both of them. The British government and the crime world of Brittan were in bed together...literally. Sherlock shared a glance with John, and the giggling became inevitable.
Mr. Brenton's fingers where shaking slightly as he continued. "I walked back into the kitchen and fished a small torch out of one of the drawers; I didn't want to wake anyone just in case I was being paranoid...but I wasn't being paranoid...My finger was red, I think it was blood-"
Sherlock's tongue peeked out to wet his suddenly dry lips. "I want to try this," he insisted, "properly."
John rolled his eyes and scanned the paper again. At last he saw a grainy black and white photo of a delivery truck surrounded by police tape, and a smattering of officers. He scanned the byline.
: Not My Boyfriend
Metal scraped along asphalt as the car started to give. Sherlock stepped forward and caught the woman as her arm came free and she fell forward. He eased her to her knees, kneeling alongside her as he suspected she might faint from shock or pain. She didn't faint, but struggled to regain her balance.
"Eat." It was a quiet, caring command, but it was still a command.
save them, casting everything else to the side. Now… well now John didn't know
They shared a long meaningful look before Sherlock nodded and looked away. Loving John was one thing. Being vulnerable was quite another... He started a bit when he felt John's lips pressing gently against his cheek. "I've been thinking," John murmured, his hand sliding down Sherlock's neck, brushing the fresh marks. "And I have a suggestion."
Sherlock leaned away from the microscope to make a small notation on the pad of paper just beside him. His experiment was going very well, but it was important to watch it closely or he'd have to start all over again; the variables were just too delicate.
Sherlock's fingers clenched reflexively as he walked. Mycroft and he had made a game of Charing Cross's security camera system these past few weeks. When Mycroft had traced Sherlock's hacks, he'd placed more robust firewalls in place, without the knowledge of Charing Cross's administrative staff. These had actually required some effort to break through, but nothing too extraneous. The intensity of Charing Cross's security camera system's firewall increased every time Sherlock had accessed it. Regardless of Mycroft's efforts, Sherlock had never failed to access the video feed from Charing Cross's security cameras. Having them on, foolishly, gave Sherlock a sense of comfort.
"What consequences?" Harry asked, sitting on the floor beside Eva as her legs grew tired of crouching.
John fervently hoped that Sherlock was wrong about his illness. It had been known to happen, after all, from time to time.
The dog in the crate nearest to him shifted, catching John's eye. It was chewing on something between its paws and eyeing him warily, as if expecting John to snatch it from him. It was a bone, and a rather large one, even for a dog of that size. An uneasy feeling grew inside his chest until John leaned closer, trying to get a better look at the bone. The dog dropped its treat and skittered back, snarling.
still did. "
As soon as Sherlock released him, John sprang free, rubbing the abused ribs that had suffered the brunt of Sherlock's restraining grip. "Was that
"So Mr. Holmes," She began in a sultry, 1940's Hollywood voice, "Is there anyone," she paused to lick her full red lips, "special waiting at home for you after your latest victory?"  Sherlock looked as stoic and bored as always, but John could feel his discomfort.
"Would you like some tea?"
Wow, it's been too long since I took to my computer like this. But, man, am I ever glad to be back.
The stranger shrugged. "Sugar on the rim, sometimes colored, 1/2 shot hazelnut liqueur, one shot of vodka, and a lemon meant to be bitten into after the shot."
Mycroft drew in a breath and took his wife's arm. "I'll stop by tomorrow," he announced.
It was becoming readily apparent that Sherlock would need to look elsewhere for the details of Mr. Wallingford's secret. It would be foolish not to be thorough, however. The family was on edge already, and he had done everything in his power to maximize the advantage.
"Yes," Sherlock confirmed. "You missed everything of real importance to the case, but at least you're thinking."
John smiled and snuggled closer into the embrace. "No."
His reply was quiet, but Marcus must have heard it, because he pulled back with a grin and ushered John off his stool and towards the door, the remainder of their drinks forgotten. Outside Marcus lead him to a posh black Lincoln, and they slipped inside.
And he was.
"Fire." Sherlock replied, still rapidly opening and closing files.
"What's going on here, mate?" came the gruff voice of Mr. Werner as he approached them.
"Welcome home, John!" Mary called back from the kitchen.
"Because he always takes the interesting cases." She nudged his side gently and winked conspiratorially. "After all the years he's lived here, I've gotten quite an eye for them myself. You've got the most interesting case he's seen in weeks."
"Hospital just called," John explained, lifting his arm to hail a cab. "There's been a big accident on The Highway. They need some extra hands tonight. I'm heading over from the pub; I just wanted to let you know I probably won't be home tonight."
Petia nodded. "That is fair enough, Mr. Holmes. Perhaps you could start by telling me what you know, and then I will fill in the rest."
Harry rocked slowly in her chair, listening. She wanted to believe that was true, but...she wasn't sure. She wasn't sure about anything anymore...
~*~*~*~
Sherlock huffed and made to roll his eyes when he found himself suddenly pinned against the wall of his bedroom. "I mean it, Sherlock." John voice softened slightly when he added. "I'm not going to hurt you."
Sherlock's eyes flittered down to the black backpack resting at John's feet. He'd taken more than just this bottle, and the tremor in his fingers said that John was unsettled by how easy it had been to steal the evidence. It had been almost second nature, which had reminded him of Sherlock…
: Beautiful Disaster
was a reason for murder...
Sherlock gazed after him for a moment perplexed and unnerved, then John squeezed his hand again and helped the paramedics transfer him to the backboard. It was inconvenient at times, but John utterly refused to let go of his hand. Sherlock glanced between his brother and his blogger, not sure which one confused him more...
1980-2012
Mary gave him an amused smile. "Thank you. You don't look half bad yourself." She leaned forward and brushed at his shoulder, as if brushing some lint away. "I just got the call, the cab is waiting.
John closed his eyes for a moment and just focused on his breathing. What was it Mycroft had said? Ah, yes: Alexander loves his family
There
John shrugged. "If you want to. It'll be more material for the blog and it will keep you occupied."
John pulled his tie straight and checked his work in the mirror. It would have to do. The suit looked well put together, but it did little to hide the devastation so evident in his eyes.
The streets were cold and icy, but neither of those things were really a deterrent for Sherlock. He
"Roll over and put my brother on the phone," Sherlock ordered. His voice wasn't raised but it was direct and clipped. Mycroft and Lestrade had been together as a couple for several years now. It officially happened shortly before Sherlock's fall, but they'd been dancing around each other for years. Sherlock wasn't sure whether he should be surprised that it took so long, or that it happened at all.
The ex-army doctor glanced at the paper, frowning at the articles that littered the page. He seriously doubted there was a case hidden in the sales advertisements... "Is there something fishy about those artifacts they're finding at the construction site for the new skyscraper they're putting up?" John asked, gesturing to said article. "They completed most of the digging for the foundation before they found the artifacts, now they're saying those holes in the ground could sit for years while they sell them off."
anyone. No, John was bought and paid for, and they both knew it. Even so, John had never been the kind of man to break a confidence. He turned to the nobleman and smiled politely. "I've been in practice as a doctor for a number of years, and everything a patient shares has always been confidential. I don't take that responsibility lightly."
Police techs were everywhere, photographing, and cataloguing anything that might be of the slightest importance. The front hall opened to a grand wooden staircase. It was the elegant study to the left of the entrance, however, that held everyone's attention. There, slumped in a leather wingback chair by the unlit fireplace, was a faceless body in an immaculate suit, if you didn't count the blood splatter.
The trio burst out of the hospital and were at the street in moments. Sherlock lifted his arm and, as per usual, a cab materialized. They all piled into the cab and for once it was Sherlock reaching for his wallet. He gave the cabbie the address whilst slipping him what appeared to be two hundred pounds.
sure, Sherlock?" John asked, his hands gently cradling Sherlock's face.
"Hello, John," Mary greeted him after the third ring, "How are you?" John could hear the smile in her voice and he felt his features softening in response, only now realizing he'd been frowning since he left the Morris family in the patient lounge.
"Shot in the dark; good one though. The power connection had tiny scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he plugs it in to recharge it but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober mans phone, you never see a drunk's without them." Sherlock paused for a moment before smugly adding. "There, you see, you were right."
Marcus gasped when John returned his attention to Marcus's neck, his hand reaching out to the drawer of the bedside table once more. John caught his movement and pulled away to retrieve the desired items. The drawer was indeed well stocked. John quickly selected lube and a condom that was for intercourse, not oral sex. Looking back at Marcus's disheveled face, he smiled. "Come here," he murmured, maneuvering them both until he had his back against the headboard and Marcus was hovering over his lap.
"Fine, don't work the case then. I really don't have time for this today, Sherlock." There was a rustle of fabric as Lestrade undoubtedly peered around a heavy set of drapes. "It's all I can do to keep the media circus from breaking through the front door."
John took a deep breath and tried again. "Sherlock, can you hear me? Answer me!"
"Christ!" The guard sputtered, taking a step back.
He reached for the chart at the foot of the bed first, to give himself some more time, a moment to collect himself, though he knew that there was little he could really do to put a barrier between himself and this present disaster. It had happened, and now he was going to have to deal with it.
The Detective Inspector nodded in understanding. "Go on. Try to keep him out of trouble, if you can."
Sherlock arched an eyebrow at Lestrade, turning his back to Dan, trusting the football players and the police officers to keep him in line. "Is that so? Do you only tackle domestic violence cases during the nine to five hours?"
Sherlock, his eyes never leaving Bryan's, released his grip on Evelyn, allowing her to slink back towards the sofa she had been formerly occupying, where her mother now sat. "If a murder has taken place then there are secrets that will be better uncovered if involved parties have less time to generate a moderately cohesive
Laurali leaned into Alex's hand and closed her eyes. "Darling," he began, warm affection evident in her voice, "nothing goes according to plan. You just have to learn to roll with the punches." Laurali had always had a greater tolerance for the unexpected than her husband. John and Sherlock suspected that this was because of the loss of his own parents, so early in his life; Laurali had never remembered any other parents but Sherlock and John.
John sputtered and pulled away, his hand clenching reflexively at the tingling sensation that spread through him as his fingers brushed Sherlock's. What was
John looked up and they shared a long, tense look. "You really think he's in
"That's what I thought at first, but Mycroft
"Here, on the other side," Sherlock continued, tracing his findings with his finger, "are four longer marks, those came from the fingers on the rest of the hand. Given the size and depth of the bruising, it was probably a man's hand. Mr. Dwight, most likely."
Sherlock nodded, and John suspected he saw a light flush of color in Sherlock's cheeks, although it could have easily been a trick of the afternoon sunlight that was streaming through the windows.
"Good question," Eric replied, pausing to make a few notes on the papers on his clipboard. "Our shifts rotate every week. One week you would work the first shift, then next week the second shift, and the week after the third shift."
John's eyebrows rose to his hairline. "And you think
Lestrade shook his head. "No, Sherlock, not until tomorrow morning."
"I fell to pieces. I'd never gone to university. I was just working at a bakery and trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. Johnny had barely started pre-med, and he was so... calm. I know we were both adults, but I've never felt more like a little kid," she hiccupped and sobbed, "a kid whose parents really were
"How's your sister doing?"
"Shouldn't you get that?" Mary asked.
John had generally been offended when someone, anyone tried to insinuate that he wasn't doing well since Sherlock's fall. Yes, he was not as he once was, but, all things considered, John thought he was carrying on fairly well. Anyways it was the best that he could do, considering the gaping hole the arrogant git had torn in John's life when he'd jumped.
What had he
And yet…
Sherlock surveyed the area before them with a keen eye before proclaiming, "Ah. You met your boyfriend here for lunch before." It was not a question. He pressed on, heedless of John's darkening expression. "Avoiding him won't resolve your ambiguous feelings you know."
He was three bites in before he looked pointedly at Sherlock. "
James smiled and glanced down at his phone when it buzzed. "Thank you." He frowned then, glancing at an ugly bruise on John's wrist, and leaned forward to rest his own fingers lightly on top of it. "What happened here?"
A chill prickled along John's spine. "You're sure?"
tell me that you're not trying to say you think he fancies me?!"
needed to know his place. Everything would turn out as Sherlock had said it would, things always did. Harriet would relapse, John would become embittered, and Sherlock would close a trap around the greatest criminal master mind in the country...once he had more evidence...and then he would die...
helped. In the beginning, Molly had needed to babysit John's every move.
aren't you wearing any pants?" John asked, looking up at his daughter as he settled the fabric of her dress above her knees.
John pressed his stethoscope into the pale back of the woman on the gurney in front of him. "Deep breath," he instructed. She complied, coughing slightly on the out breath. John shifted his stethoscope to her other lung. "Again." Again the woman, whose name was Lucy Aster, took a deep breath. There was some slight wheezing, but her breath sounds were much improved from when she had first arrived. John checked the lower part of both her lungs and was satisfied that the breathing treatment had worked.
"Forgive the delay," he murmured, picking up two menu's and ushering them along. "We are a bit short-handed tonight.
Miss. Williams returned Sherlock's glower, but was able to reply with a cool, aloof tone. "Of course I would believe if Charles told me, I
"So it's one of the staff," John surmised.
Slowly, John nodded. "I was hoping I could convince a friend at Barts to do it." He hoped Molly would. Her tests would be able to put his mind to rest, and he could try to forget this whole thing. Maybe even plan a vacation. He couldn't possibly be right. If he was right…if he was right he would have to go to Sherlock… Subtle evils that no one else could see or catch were his specialty. But no, he had to be wrong, and he needed proof before he could let it go.
Sherlock took a measured breath and lifted his fingers close to his chin in an approximation of his thinking pose, his eyes never once leaving Mary's face. She was amused…but this was not a game. "John will not be returning to 221 B, Rosamund. Let me be clear on that point."
Sherlock started at the paper before him for a long moment, staring past it to the newest dent in Mrs. Hudson's wallpaper. Greg had called some time ago, possibly days, and when Sherlock hadn't called back, Mycroft had started calling. Sherlock had used his own phone for target practice to get the ringing to stop. Even so, it would not be long until his elder brother deigned to visit. He had forgotten how irritating those visits could be, they'd mostly stopped since John moved in…
John whirled to face her, pointing vehemently back the way they had come. "He'll stop at nothing to get what he wants!"
Sherlock hurriedly shoved his phone into his pocked when John whirled around. The ex-army doctor swiped furiously at his eyes for a moment before violently shoving his phone back into his pocket. He didn't bother with an explanation. Even if Sherlock hadn't been the most brilliant man in London, what was happening was obvious. "We need to leave. There's a train to Switzerland at 11:00pm. If we hurry we can make it."
"I can't blame you after Sherlock just brushed you off like that. He sounds like a real beast when he's mad.
The light, joyful voices of two violins playing in tandem welcomed John back to 221 B. John smiled as he mounted the steps, grateful that Sherlock was home. Mary's gravestone had been erected today, and he'd just returned from visiting her. Technically the gravestone was for Mary
John waved his goodbye to Nikki as she made her way out the door and down the stairs, then he turned his gaze back to Sherlock, who was waiting for him with a soft, warm smile.
Love is worth it; love is always worth it.
The police had done a moderately competent job of beating back the swarm of paparazzi, but the size and volume of the crowd was almost palpable. When Sherlock stepped out of the cab the flashes were blinding, but he had never been someone who was easily intimidated.
free of needing the macabre comfort it offered.
James had given a little start before smiling in a welcome, if confused way. "
Their eyes locked and the air charged.
John nodded, that sounded like a decent system.
"John." Sherlock's voice was warm and concerned as his hands steadied John's trembling fingers.
James leaned forward, stole one last, short kiss, before pulled back and making his way down the street. John watched him go, warmed by the evening of good company and the almost promise of something more to come.
John tried hard not to be amused. Sherlock really was a terror sometimes, but it was comical when he started taking personal offense at the proclaimed incompetence of others. John wished he could do a better job of defending his fellow man, but Sherlock's brilliance always made his deductions look easy. Not that John was giving any ground on their personal battle of wills when it came to the human heart, that would never happen.
The world's only consulting detective lifted his petulant gaze to John's unrepentant one.
. Tedious."
He passed the second hand bookstore flanked by the thrift shop and slipped seamlessly into the ally between the two. His lips quirked in a ghost of a smile. Wiggins was waiting. He had been leaning against the wall with a cigarette in his mouth, looking bored, but when Sherlock came into view he came to life, stamping out the cigarette and holding out his hands.
: Restless
"Sherlock? I'm home," John called out, strolling into their flat and shrugging off his jacket. Although time and experience had made it perfectly clear to him that Sherlock didn't listen to him, and that, somehow, even when he wasn't home Sherlock talked to him and had John
John had smiled, relieved. James' easy, friendly manner had been such a welcome change of pace that he'd readily agreed. They'd strolled along, talking like old friends as they made their way through London.
"John," Greg said firmly, but gently, "You haven't been well, you
"Born and bred," John agreed. "Except for my time in her majesty's service I've never left."
John stopped at the edge of the grave, trembling in the early morning mist. The last time he'd stood here alone he'd breathed a silent, desperate prayer that he never believed would come to pass, despite how much he wanted it...
Mycroft, for the first time that John could remember, looked...uncomfortable. He combed his fingers though his hair, and met John's furious gaze with his open one. "I used to worry about my little brother constantly, as you well know. ... I found, quite to my surprise, that once you were in the picture, I did not have too. Still, old habits are quite hard to break... I should not be surprised that your loyalty endures, even now. I cannot think of anyone I would trust more with my brother's safety...or his heart."
John was both grateful and irritated that his hours had been so reduced. Grateful because it took over a week for the mark to fade, and however non-judgmental Mary might be, John still found it awkward and embarrassing for her to cover his mark for him. Irritated because now that his main focus was his work, he realized how little he was actually scheduled. It had almost worked with Sherlock's schedule, but now John's schedule was his own, and he was left with far too many hours to
Disclaimer: I don't think the Holloway Sanatorium is in operation anymore, but I wanted to pick something that actually existed in London, so for the sake of this story, let's presume it is still in operation.
John considered this for a moment. It was no less distasteful than what he had been imagining, he
Sherlock stepped completely out into the hallway, his expression hardening. "
Sherlock had striven to find a solution which would let them both rest easy. His solution resulted in Sherlock reading aloud from whatever book John was reading, until his blogger finally released his grip on wakefulness. It had become a soothing rhythm with which they ended their days. Sherlock tended to pick apart the books like he picked apart crap telly, but John appeared to consider that part of the fun.
John bit his tongue and he scrubbed his hands clean, cursing his heart and his memory. Standing in the familiar loo it was hard to convince himself that he wasn't home. And yet... 221 B hadn't been his home for many months now…at least in name.
"Boys, you can flirt later," Mary broke in. "Right now we have a situation to neutralize."
It was a newspaper.
interesting, but that combined with Lestrade's poorly veiled effort to bring Sherlock on made it more likely to be interesting. The reverberation of Lestrade's voice and the sounds of the drapes he'd pulled aside let Sherlock know the case involved a rich family, possibly a politically connected one as well.
John was just coming back into the living room with two cups of tea when Mrs. Hudson peeked her head inside the flat, knocking softly on the door as she opened it. "Sorry to bother you boys," she chirped. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything, your door is almost never closed." Her eyes roamed around eagerly as she spoke, almost as if she hoped she
"Thank you, Mr. Holmes," Nikki murmured, wiping away tears with her good hand.
"What condition?" John pressed.
A man in his forties passed by, with dull dark eyes heavily bruised underneath from lack of sleep. He had dark messy hair, gaunt cheeks, and uneven stubble. His clothing was tough but had seen much better days. All this in combination with the sickly sweet smell Sherlock briefly detected indicated the man was alcoholic, likely sleeping rough. The gaunt cheeks and shadows under his eyes could be from sleeping rough or from an amphetamine habit. If he used amphetamines, however, it was probably to stay awake because he didn't have a safe place to sleep. The sickly sweet smell was coming out of the man's pores, a feeble protest from his overtaxed liver.
Now he was paying the price.
Miss. Williams glanced sidelong at her father, who remained standing anxiously in the doorway. "It would also be a crime," she replied uncertainly, "since I know that Charles would never give you permission." She swallowed again and pressed on, "I
interested.
Sherlock made himself sit, immediately drawing his knees up and encircling them in his arms, trying to shield himself from...everything.
John waited for respirations to be given before ordering his team to pull back, and administering the medications once more. He pulled up his stethoscope and listened. No respirations and now...no pulse. John cursed softly. "Calling time of death," he lifted his eyes to the clock on the wall, "4:38am."
"John, the Yard is swamped right now. I don't know what happened, but our tip line has been ringing off the hook. I don't have time for Sherlock and his games."
It was Alex. She was young, barely twenty three, and contemplating making the plunge into medical school. She stared up at him expectantly with her bright blue eyes and brown hair framing her face. "Can I help you?" John asked with a small smile, pocketing his phone for now. He suspected she was here to pick his brain about Barts again.
"How are you feeling?"
something to alleviate the pain that was so obvious on his face… but he had no right to.
Sherlock nodded. Mary's memory and observation were as sharp as he thought they were. "Only under duress." He confessed. "Lestrade called me to investigate the possibility of murder, unfortunately it was just bad business. That's all I could find at the time anyway."
Sherlock pressed the heels of his hands firmly into his eyes and swore, loudly. "That is probably a laundering operation for stolen items, but you have missed

John's eyes found hers slowly, reluctantly.
be assaulted. While it would be mildly satisfying to break Mr. Werner's jaw, it wasn't necessary. Lestrade would ensure he received the most severe punishment allowable both for the murder of his wife, and his…other activities.
They arrived on their floor and, with gentle pressure on John's shoulders, Marcus guided him to their room. Marcus instinctively held the door open for John, who proceeded him into the room. John flipped on the lights and looked around with appreciation and satisfaction. It was a much nicer room than John would usually rent for himself, without being ostentatious. The carpeting was plush, and finely detailed. There was a large king sized bed against the wall with luxurious bedding draped over it. On the opposite wall was a gas fireplace with faux logs inside.
Sherlock hummed softly, bent intently over his microscope apparently in deep concentration. It was the kind of hum you offered when you were distracted, and hoped whoever was talking to you would just go away.
When he reached the street Sherlock summoned a cab in his typical fashion, and slipped inside. He spent the short ride to 221 considering his next options. He had some experiments he could run, but he was more interested in a case, a real case this time. Hopefully a client was waiting for him.
Greg sighed and rested his forehead in one hand for a moment, then he looked up and met John's steely gaze with a much softer expression. "Both at this point. Mycroft and I have been talking about this a lot since you moved out."
"How?" John asked, stepping into the room.
One minute passed, then two, the paramedic was prepping a second dose when Anna's lips parted, and she gasped for air. "Can you hear me?" John asked, leaning over his patient, still prepared for an unintentional spasm. Anna blinked her eyes open, glanced around and immediately tried to sit upright. "Easy," John murmured, supporting her with an arm around her back. "Easy, you've had a close call. We need to get you to hospital so you can be evaluated." Anna nodded mutely, still looking around in a daze and shivering. John gave her his jacket as he helped her onto a stretcher. The paramedic caught his eye and nodded gratefully. "We've got her from here."
"I've suspected for some months that a cure might be at work," Mycroft continued, causing both Sherlock and John to look up at him. "When you were brought in, I had them pull several vials of blood for testing."
The robe had been a gift from Sherlock on John's birthday before the fall. Sherlock proclaimed not to be one for gift giving, which made it even more special. Sherlock had thought of him and chosen well; John had put the robe to good use over the years, especially during the cold winter months.
I find nothing at the Dwight household to convince you," Sherlock pressed, "then you can go."
Sherlock arched against John for a moment before tugging him back up his body and into another feverish kiss. Sherlock licked his way into John's mouth, and rolled over, pressing John back into the pillows. John hooked his fingers through Sherlock's belt loops, trapping Sherlock against John as he ground up into Sherlock's slender body.
"Marcus left his phone," John observed with a wry smile.
Two flights of stairs and one long hallway later and Sherlock was
Sherlock's eye twinkled with suppressed mirth as he murmured, "Because I was bored."
With that happy thought in mind, John made his way down the steps from the hideout of his bedroom for his afternoon tea. Sherlock was researching something on John's computer. John's eyebrow twitched in irritation but he refused to comment. Sherlock, expert lock pick and the world's only consulting detective, could and would get access to anything he wanted within the confines of 221 B, and almost everywhere else. For Harry and for his sanity, John would grin and bear it.
The world's only consulting detective looked more than doubtful. That is, until John rose to stand over him, his hand on the juncture of Sherlock's neck and shoulder, and his lips grazing his ear. "After your shoulder slipped back in place, I was checking the connection." He pressed down meaningfully with his fingers, pressing lightly into Sherlock's carotid artery. "When Greg mentioned that she would have died without you…I took your pulse."
John drew back with a smile and looked about to get up when Sherlock reached out and stilled his movements. "There's some in the bedside table." John nodded and reached for the top drawer, pulling out the lube and immediately snapping the lid open. He poured the clear liquid into his hand and reached forward, pressing his slick palm into Sherlock's member. Sherlock gasped again, pressing up into the contact. John leaned down to press slow, sucking kisses along Sherlock's neck as he worked his hand in smooth, wet strokes.
Mycroft and Irene nodded. "Precisely," they chorused.
Nikki finally backed up laughing softly and whipping her eyes. "Yes, that's a yes." She looked up at him and beamed, her eyes still shining. "Thank you, Mr. Holmes."
John raised a suspicious eyebrow, but he kept his tone light. "It's fine Molly. I don't mind. And I don't think it made the slightest difference in his investigation anyway."
James had just been getting off-shift at the time, and John had invited him out to a local pub. The morgue assistant had accepted with a warmth that soothed the ex-army doctor's temper. The welcoming smile that greeted John when he arrived loosened the tension that had been sitting like a steel band around his heart.
John's eyebrows lifted in surprise. "There are
"We'd better follow him," John encouraged, pulling on his own jacket, and handing Mr. Brenton his. "If you don't want him peeking through your home unobserved that is. He's probably deduced your address."
to get a small rosebush growing outside our building, but she's never had any luck."
Sherlock's response was quick and ruthless. "You served in Her Majesty's service, Afghanistan most likely, until you were invalided home. Despite the fact that you were shot in the left
Alex frowned, "But I thought-"
he'd shot that cabbie, but he never regretted it. Despite all the terrible fights, the ridiculous hours, the interrupted dates and work, John had been having the most fun he'd ever had.
Greetings, and welcome back for another chapter of Choosing Love! ^_^
John shrugged and forced himself to make eye contact, "What's done is done. There's really not much to tell you that you don't already know. I moved out, I have a new job at Charing Cross Hospital, and I live with a woman named Mary."
"Yes, thank you again, Mrs. Hudson," John replied, slightly chagrined. Some mission of mercy he was on, if he'd started it off by disturbing the peace of a nice old landlady. He was pleased not to have frightened her. Then again, if Sherlock Holmes had been her lodger for years, he imagined she wasn't easily frightened. "I hope you have a good day," he murmured over his shoulder, starting up the stairs at last.
lost when the world's only consulting detective began to present his findings.
"Then why did you send that poor man away?!" John asked, crossing his arms indignantly
"That's wonderful news, John!" Mrs. Hudson gushed, squeezing his arm. "I hoped it would turn out like that."
"We were out of the two percent milk you like for your tea?" Sherlock asked, still too absorbed in his task to lift his eyes to John's.
" He had glanced around before adding, "
John's grin was unrelenting. "The gardens, huh?" he mused, skimming the description of the expansive grounds residents of the Edelweiss Recovery Center could cultivate, if they so chose. "Sounds like fun to me. I remember I could hardly get you out of Mum's gardens, when we were younger."
"She's only a
Where was he going to live now? 221 C was still an option but, if he was honest with himself John had chosen that location to stay close to Sherlock. His fingers curled into fists and shook with tension. Had he been played for a fool
Thank you to everyone who has commented on, left kudos for, subscribed to, and/or bookmarked this story.  Your support means a lot to me <3.
John chuckled quietly, knowing he'd called Sherlock that and worse both out loud and in his own mind. He didn't seem that much of a tyrant anymore though. The ex-army doctor enjoyed the thrill of adventure that came with each new case, he could satisfy his need to protect and heal Sherlock, and despite himself, he'd always been awed by that brilliant mind in action.
The kettle sang shrilly and John plucked it from the stove, pouring the water for the tea. He opened the fridge in search of milk, but came away empty handed. "Sherlock!" he hissed, displeased, "Didn't I tell you we were out of milk?"
The Detective Inspector glared up at the world's only consulting detective. "You'd stake your reputation on it? This isn't just because you've had a lull in cases?"
"Thank you," John replied. "I have the impression, after talking with Sherlock, that his brother and he bicker a lot, and dragging other people into the argument in dramatic fashion is just par for the course. The weirdest thing about it was when Mycroft offered me money to spy on his little brother for him.
Sherlock mumbled something incomprehensible, and opened his eyes. He licked his lips then managed, "There's no need to shout..."
John frowned, pleased that Sherlock as conscious, but troubled by his racing heartbeat. He lifted his hand and pressed it to a forehead that was damp with sweat. "You have a fever," John grumbled his fingers sliding down Sherlock's neck to press against the swollen lymph nodes under his jaw.
"What?" Sherlock and John chorused, moving to stand on either side of Mary and peer at the computer.
true. John glanced once over his shoulder and grinned when he saw James had also turned around to wave at him. He waved back, before facing forward once more. Romantic relationships where definitely out of the question...for now, anyways.
In that moment John had been able to forgive Sherlock everything. He would have forgiven him anyway, regardless, but Sherlock's words had helped John see what his pain hadn't let him look at. Sherlock had a reason for what he had done, a good one, regardless of the pain he had caused, and even while he had hurt all those he was closest to in a way that could never be forgotten, it had been done with them in mind…
Thank you to everyone who left a comment; I love hearing back from my readers! Thank you also to everyone who left kudos, bookmarked, and/or subscribed to my story. I hope you enjoy this next installment!
Sherlock grinned shamelessly as they pulled up to a rather large, stately looking house on the outskirts of London. John took a moment to admire what he could see of the gardens as they passed. Everything looked so...peaceful. It contrasted sharply with the scene that awaited them.
"Somehow, I doubt he was really looking for advice on the care of roses," Mrs. Hudson said with a wry smile.
John followed, his mind a tangle of confusion. With one breath Sherlock was all but discounting the name of one of William's victims, and with his next he was expressing concerns about saving lives. Did he
A strong hand fell on John's shoulder causing him to whirl around quickly. Before the images in front of him had properly resolved themselves into a face, John felt the stranger's windpipe under his palm. Small vibrations buzzed against his palm as the stranger said, "I mean no harm. I am here to request a meeting with Mr. Holmes." He was a tall man with graying hair, a strong, muscular build, and slate gray eyes.
, Sherlock Holmes! You care so much!"
"What was your father's business?" Sherlock prompted.
At length Sherlock drew himself up to his full height and moved to stand directly in front of Miss. Williams. "I will find you your proof then." Sherlock arched a sardonic eyebrow. "I do hope I can manage to find enough to convince you before your body becomes
Trigger Warning: The case described in this chapter is a murder case, and the body is described in somewhat graphic detail.
"Why don't we go back inside, Mr. Werner, and I can go over your statement with you, to make sure we're not missing anything."
He touched other people more easily now; won their hearts and confidence. While he didn't shy away from the necessities of his business, which before had seemed so revolting, he completed his tasks with an apparent warmth and empathy that smoothed the way and left nothing but good feelings in his wake. He was, in some respects, almost everything he had ever hoped to be: a doctor, a business man, someone who appeared to balance the demands of his job and push forward for the betterment of
John nodded again. "Yes, but I
Greg lifted his hand slightly in surrender. "I didn't say he wasn't being awful, he's really done it this time..." Greg trailed off for a moment, placing both of his hands back on the table. "I just…I've known him for a long time, and I don't think he knows
As it turned out, Mycroft's warning text had come three weeks before Sherlock's final entanglement with Moriarty, and Sherlock's time away…
Lestrade had cursed and pulled him into a hug, overjoyed to have his friend back again. Sherlock hadn't meant for Lestrade to become a friend either, but he had. Moriarty had found his friends, and targeted them, and because Sherlock
"What
"Because I love you!" Sherlock shouted back, and then he paled and looked away. "I love you, John," he repeated softly, and more to himself than to John, "and I can't make you happy." Sherlock shook his head and seemed to curl in on himself slightly. "I don't seem to be good at anything but causing trouble...and
The elder Holmes brother strode distractedly about the room while Sherlock's eyes tracked him. He was frowning down at a stack of papers in his hands and muttering to himself. Sherlock decided he must have just come back from fetching the mail. Mycroft had been waiting for something important in the post for several weeks now; he was expecting an acceptance letter from one of the finest business and law programs in the country.
For once in his life Sherlock didn't think, he reacted. He was careful to move silently over the stone floor separating him from Moriarty until he was almost upon him, then he lunged. A vicious snarl erupted from his throat as he made contact, pushing his opponent violently over the edge. Moriarty started as he began to fall, but his reflexes were quick. He turned as his body fell away from the precipice, and he clutched Sherlock's arm. The momentum carried them both over the edge.
"Apparently," Sherlock replied with a bland expression.
His research at. Barts, as interrupted as it had been, hadn't revealed anything he didn't already know. If there was anything in the case of Mr. Wallingford's death, a lead might be found by examining Charing Cross Hospital directly. Of course a trip in person wouldn't be nearly as revealing as what he could find electronically. The scene of the crime, if there had been one, was hopelessly contaminated. Here, from behind his own computer, he could hack medical records, security cameras, personnel files, death records, autopsies, and more.
Still, John was resolved.
"How are things at the morgue?"
~*~*~*~
Possessed with the thought of a waiting case Sherlock leapt from the cab before it had properly stopped. The cabbie shouted after him, but Sherlock didn't heed him until, being lighter on his feet than most, said cabbie leapt from the cab and pinned Sherlock to his own front door. He was shouting threats about the police and other such nonsense. Sherlock didn't have time for it. He rolled his eyes, fished out his wallet, and threw money at him. The yelling stopped and Sherlock was at last able to make his way inside.
"This woman is
Alex smiled warmly, and pulled his wife to her feet. She kissed him once, and then shuffled off down the hall. Alex looked after her a moment before sliding into the chair she had vacated. Leaning towards his Uncles in a conspiratorial manner, Alex asked, "So, are there any more cases on the horizon for you two?"
James had studied him for a moment before nodding in compassion and understanding. "
"Fire is certainly dramatic," Sherlock agreed, "But he did a good enough job that it looked like an accident, and he didn't even use the fireplace..." Sherlock's voice trailed off and his gaze narrowed. "Idiot!" he hissed, stalking over to the largely intact chimney.
"You're inner doctor is showing," James said with a small smile.

us her blackmail material?!"
"Sherlock?"
John stood and followed her out, turning off the lights and closing the door behind him as he did so.
John nodded, his eyes sweeping over the doors once more before returning to Mary's smiling face. She must really like exposed wood, none of the doors in her flat were painted, only stained and polished.
~*~*~*~
Shaking his head, John trotted over to the two of them. He arrived in time to hear Sherlock launch into his explanation. "It became a pre-meditated crime of opportunity. There was all this money, just
Lestrade met him just inside the foyer, a curious expression washing over his previous frown as his eyes met Sherlock's. "Where's-"
A plate of food was set in front of him, breaking John out of his thoughts. He looked up to see the owner wink at him, before placing Sherlock's plate in front of him as well The owner wished them a good evening before hurrying off to attend to some of his other customers. John watched him go for a moment, then sighed softly a picked up his fork.
The long-term health effects aside, every omega's body was different in a way that made standardizing suppressants difficult; it had taken several years, and a handful of black market chemists to find a formula that worked for Sherlock. When things looked hopeless, he had turned to drugs. Always in a controlled environment, always alone and behind many locked doors. He was interested in numbing the pain, not making it worse. The drugs hadn't helped, but
It was Molly who had finally taken pity on him, and helped him in an unexpected way; she'd given him work to do. It was against policy, John wasn't an employee of the morgue, but it
"No, my name was Lestrade before I married, just like my sister." The children ran past the door to his study then, chasing a plastic eyeball the size of a plum, which was rolling on the floor. It had a clear plastic case around it, with clear liquid between the plastic eyeball and the clear casing. The eyeball inside was weighted so that, no matter how it was held, the eyeball always pointed up. Sherlock had made up several of them as presents for the children. "Hold on just a moment," he said into the phone. Then, shielding the phone with his hand he yelled, "Don't chase that eyeball down the steps! I do
“Are you okay?” His voice was too high at the end, making him sound nervous. John turned to him, eyes wide almost like he was scared. Sherlock didn’t want him to be scared.
“No. No, thank you. I have someone picking me up now anyway, I’m making them wait as we speak,” his rejection clearly disappointed John but he made no objections to it, just said his goodbye and told him he’d see him tomorrow.
“You’re not very subtle, John. You’ve been grimacing far more than usual indicating you’re in some sort of physical pain not to mention the two times you had to take a breath and steady yourself which I’d usually have tallied up to some psychological issue however…” if John didn’t know Sherlock better he’d say he looked embarrassed, “I heard you throwing up in the toilets this morning.”
Please enjoy and be forgiving of any spelling/grammar mistakes I missed.
“No Sherlock this isn’t just a one time thing, after this we can go out and date but right now I really need us to go to your room.”
“Fine, we’ll stay. I’m going to sit down then,” John flopped down on to the chair near to him, he’d been on the way to leave the house when they’d had their argument, he’d have preferred to lie down on the much more comfortable couch but at the moment the other side of the room seemed a mile away. An uncomfortable silence fell over the room as John sat and Sherlock stood over him twiddling his thumbs. And now Sherlock was bouncing up and down on the balls of his feet. And now he was obnoxiously sighing. John had to put an end to this before he started humming.
“I’m happy to see you’re no longer at risk of projectile vomiting all over our apartment,” Sherlock said as he poured more soup into the kitchen sink.
