Sherlock purred softly, massaging his Omega's sides tenderly as he rested his head on John's shoulder. "She's perfect," he murmured, watching Miranda intently as she ate, "A beautiful, healthy little Alpha." John's belly tightened beneath Sherlock's hands again, making the detective smile. "My, they're coming fast," he crooned, making firmer circles as John groaned. His left hand dropped to feel between John's legs, his purring deepening as his fingers caressed the Omega's slick hole. Sherlock pressed a gentle kiss to John's cheek. “You're a vision," he said softly, "And you're doing splendidly. She's bigger than Arthur, indeed, and you looked like you were having the time of your life getting her out."
John fidgeted, restless, and poked his Alpha in the ribs. "Full," he pointed out petulantly, pushing his breasts towards his Alpha's mouth, milk dripping invitingly from his dusky nipples.
Across town, the ginger Alpha's phone pinged in the genteel hum of the parlour of the Ritz and he retrieved it from his pocket with an apologetic look. The colour drained from his face when he read the text and he stood hurriedly, gathering his belongings. "I have to go," he managed evenly, "my sincerest apologies, Molly. This has been lovely – we must arrange to do it again sometime. It has already been paid for, so do please finish it, the smoked salmon blinis are quite excellent." He smiled at his new friend, experiencing an emotion he did not recognise because their afternoon tea had been cut short, and strode smartly to the waiting black car.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock's look softened at John's sadness. "I'm sorry, my Omega, I was only playing. Please don't feel badly - you haven't disappointed me." He crawled forward more and placed a kiss to the small of his mate's back, rubbing a hand over the swell of John's belly and purring in approval. "You're right, you're my pet, but I just wanted to see my pet being a little bit
Sherlock lapped gently at John's scent gland.
Sensing his mate's sadness through the bond, John's expression softened a little. He shifted Arthur into the crook of his arm and reached out to pet Sherlock's curls, a brief stroke that was over as soon as it had begun.
he called through the bond, as much to John as to the memory of his own mother,
They still had the rest of the afternoon and evening to fill as a family of thirteen-and-three-halves, and Sherlock looked forward to playing with their pups and the new toys. Even now, several of the babies were curled up with their bears (Arthur using his more like a mattress), drooling happily on the stuffed toys. Iris was clutching her teddy in one hand and the antenna of her bee in the other, a soft smile on her plump rosebud lips.
Mycroft stood stock-still for a few moments before raising his arms too, encircling his younger brother with them lightly and patting him stiffly on the back. Mrs Hudson repressed a sniffle into her handkerchief as Molly, Lestrade and John watched with wide, disbelieving eyes. The brothers broke apart after a few moments and Sherlock returned to John as Mycroft sank back into his seat. John pressed close to his mate, positively radiant. "Well done, love," he purred quietly, his breath teasing across his ear, his hand resting innocently on his outer thigh.
" John gasped, thoroughly enjoying this turn of events, "oh god, yeah... fuck, Sherlock..." The images of his mate's fantasy filtered through their bond and the Omega keened desperately. "I - I would... you know," he managed to grind out between little whines and open-mouthed moans. "When I - oh,
he hummed, thumbing over the lace of the bodysuit as he pressed a kiss to the hollow of his mate's jaw. "And I know how much he needs it in the mornings." He milked John just enough to ensure the Omega's comfort; as delicious as the sight of his mate's milk soaking the sheets was, he wanted the pleasure of drinking from John's full breasts himself. He hooked John's leg over his arm to get a better angle, and began to stroke his mate's belly. His fingers trailed lower, soon closing over John's cock, stroking the Omega's member in time with his harder thrusts.
John opened his mouth obediently, humming lightly at the lovely taste. He smiled as he opened his mouth for the next bite. Fifteen minutes later there was a little under a third of the portion left and John was getting full. He was eating more slowly, chewing less enthusiastically, until finally he moved his head away when Sherlock brought the next mouthful to his lips. "I'm full, Sherlock, I don't think I can manage any more," he groaned, rubbing his belly to dissipate the ache. He looked at the plate; there was still enough left that he could have it for lunch the next day. "Why don't you eat something love, your food is getting cold, he coaxed, wanting a bit of a breather before continuing to stuff himself, knowing he wasn't quite at his limit yet but  not wanting to go too fast and make himself sick. "God, Sherlock... I'm so
Sherlock purred softly, the tension visibly draining from the Alpha's lithe form. He began to nuzzle at John's neck, brushing his lips against the bondmark in the gentlest of kisses, his touches reverent and careful. Forgiveness flowed back to John through the bond, though Sherlock saw little to forgive on the Omega's part. While it was well-known to be an Omega's responsibility to understand collaring, if he were a better Alpha, Sherlock thought, he would have seen that his mate lacked knowledge and done his best to amend it.
A while later he awoke, still in his mate's arms, and purred loudly, shifting to clean the sweat off Sherlock's brow with his tongue. "Mmm... how long was I asleep?" he mumbled, then registered the slick mess between his thighs and chuckled. "I must have been
, John thought vaguely, eating the treat out of his Alpha's hand when it arrived and licking at his fingers to clean them, purring happily as Sherlock gave him permission to fawn over him. He nuzzled into his mate's chest, lapping at the beaded sweat to clean him, showing his adoration by stroking and kissing as much of the detective's pale skin as he could reach. His cock was still hard and pulsing between his legs but he waited obediently until his mate wanted to give him pleasure, not even begging to be milked despite how full he was. This was the treasure of subspace; the Omega knew that his Alpha would care for him, trusted him utterly, felt no urge to control any aspect of the situation. He was Sherlock's, completely. He fawned over Sherlock until he felt a tug at the leash and a command through the bond and instantly he kneeled up, hands resting on his belly, gazing at his mate with soft eyes as he waited for his next order.
John bit back a lustful moan at the thought of Sherlock breeding him. "I did that because your comment about self-control pissed me off!" he snapped. "I couldn't control the moaning, I didn't know you'd react that badly to the toy, I just needed it... Oh, god... I want... but you, you don't, don't want
"I wouldn't do that if I were you," John ground out, managing to keep calm despite the fact that his instincts were screaming
Sherlock could feel the pack bond tugging at him, willing him to submit. For a moment, he stood mesmerized. Siger was a formidable Alpha, with an insatiable love of control; even at the lowest point in his son's addiction, even as Sherlock dirtied the name of "Holmes" over and over again, he had not wholly released his son from his pack. The great man craved another Alpha to carry on the bloodline, and as his own Omega's fertility waned, and Mycroft's prospects dimmed with each passing year, Sherlock became his final hope. His son had always shown an especial weakness under his hand, and he was confident he could have him; he simply needed the right circumstances. And now, they'd seemingly fallen straight into his lap.
The detective was grateful for their private suite; it would allow John to repose comfortably, away from the lustful gazes of the other Alphas. As much as Sherlock was pleased by the attention, it would be relaxing to have his Omega all to himself for a time. Each step he took towards the room was slow, carefully measured to keep slack on the leash. He purred as he watched John waddle along behind him. The Omega could do with stretching his legs, and Sherlock would not argue with the pleasure of watching him do so.
John sighed happily, stroking his mate's curls as he suckled. "That's it, love. Take as much of my milk as you need, there will still be plenty for your children. Oh, so good... Mmm, you feel so big inside me, Sherlock... Oh, my Alpha. My love. Yes, like that... I love carrying your babies. I'll love carrying this litter too... it'll feel so good, growing round and ripe for you again as I care for your thirteen pups... Everyone will see what a strong Alpha you are, to have me already heavy with triplets so soon after birthing your first litter..." The Omega mewled submissively as his Alpha finished nursing and rose to look into his eyes, wrapping his arms around Sherlock's neck and kissing his cheeks and jaw, humming and moaning as his mate thrust into him. He could have sworn Sherlock's cock felt bigger, thinking deliriously it might be a result of his Alpha's potency, fathering thirteen healthy pups and taking on their scents simply adding to it. His walls fluttered and clenched around Sherlock's thick length, sending as much love and pleasure through the bond as he could as he came with a soft cry, rocking his hips to ask for more, encouraging his mate to take his pleasure as they moved together languidly.
. He purred softly, rubbing his cheek against Sherlock's chest again, scooping up a few more babies to drape them across their laps.
"Oh I think I do," John purred wickedly. "I see how you look at me when I get out of the shower and rub my huge belly with the towel to get it all dry... I see how your eyes flick down to my breasts when I fold my arms and they get pushed up... I see how you swell with pride when someone comments that I look ready to pop... I notice how you stroke my belly button whenever you can because you love that it sticks out all the time now," he murmured, grinning and fondling his Alpha's balls. "It turns you on to see me like this, knowing it was you who filled me with your seed, painted my womb with it, and gave me thirteen of your pups to carry. The bigger I get, the more I please you," he hummed, giving a light squeeze. "You love my tits as well, don't you? My belly is obviously your favourite development, but they're a close second... do you want to fuck them, Sherlock?"
"and fucked me frantically until you flooded me with your come"
Sherlock agreed, rumbling low in approval,
Story first :D
John smiled and ruffled Benedict's hair in approval. Lucy and Alistair, not wanting to be left out, announced their intentions to be a vet and a dinosaur respectively; Eleanor and Blake had lost interest in the game and had curled up against Sherlock's stomach to sleep. Seeing them resting so peacefully against their sire gave John another warm rush, and tears welled in his eyes. He blinked them away quickly, not wanting the babies to think he was upset, and began to purr soothingly, hoping to entice the rest of their enormous brood to sleep so his Alpha could get some rest.
He purred as he smiled and nuzzled Sherlock's cheek, pushing contentment and bliss through their bond.
The two Alphas were well matched in skill, blocking and lunging with equal certainty as the metallic clangs echoed in the marble atrium. John mewled in distress as Mycroft side-stepped just in time to avoid a vicious stab to the chest, tightening his grip on Sherlock's coat, his Alpha hushing him and holding him closer.
John mewled happily at his Alpha's release, relishing the slow slide as Sherlock climbed off him and began rubbing his seed into John's belly, claiming him. He purred when Sherlock cleaned his cleavage with tissues and pressed into him eagerly when he came back to bed, snuggling him. "Did you enjoy that?" he murmured flirtatiously, pressing his breasts against Sherlock. "I know I did..."
John watched fascinated as Sherlock took samples and glued himself to the microscope, muttering under his breath about signs of freezing in the older body and healed defensive wounds on the fresh one. He smiled fondly as Sherlock muttered crossly about the lack of any trace evidence at all on the scarves - no sweat or hair or saliva as you'd expect from being worn at a football ground. He sat contentedly in the chair Sherlock had brought for him, rubbing his belly, just being a quiet and comforting presence until Sherlock announced that he had enough evidence and summoned a cab to take them home. He sat pliantly beside his mate, letting the Alpha cup and rub his bump, but tugged when Sherlock tried to sweep him into the nest, resisting. "I want to show you something first," he said softly, fetching an old medical textbook to show him the entry on Braxton Hicks.
"Shhh, love, it's okay, we won't let them. I'd never even consider it. I'm a doctor too, they'll have to listen to me. I'm just trying to prepare you to hear those words from a stranger, so you don't attack him, alright? I know you'll want to protect our babies, like the good Alpha you are, but they aren't in danger. Nobody can take any of them away from us," he soothed, injecting calm into his voice, using the tone one might use to address a frightened colt or a cornered fox.
"Shall we continue with the pups' things again?" inquired the Alpha. Several of the infants had already grown bored with the rattles, and were now enraptured by the other pack members' things - Benedict had begun to reach for Mycroft's new jacket, drooling happily, and Iris was staring with wide eyes at Mrs Hudson's bracelet.
enough to insist on having you here, and you are repaying him poorly for his trust. However, considering his
At the slightest pressure a thick jet of milk spurted from the servant's breast, and John ran his fingers through it where it had landed on his belly. Staring straight at Sherlock he lifted his fingers to his mouth and sucked them clean, humming in appreciation and returning for more while he inched closer and closer to orgasm, still fucking the toy as hard as he could.
"Of course I was begging for it, I WAS IN HEAT!" John yelled, red in the face. "What did you bloody expect?!" His chest heaved as he tried to calm himself, the control of a soldier quickly returning to him. "I can't go and get it myself, can I Sherlock, because the pups haven't been pack-scented yet, and they all have to come out of their neonatal lethargy for that to happen, and there's one more feed to go before that -" As if on cue, the next pup woke, and began to mewl for milk. John strode to the cot and lifted the baby to his breast, cradling it as it latched on and clung to him. "I have to be here, to feed the children you already gave me, so if either of us is going to get it, it's going to have to be you," he said icily, refusing to look at him.
Sherlock mumbled,
John smirked briefly before replying. "Late July." He enjoyed the man's incredulous expression for a moment before explaining the number of pups he was carrying, asking if a suit would still be possible, or if it would simply take too many fittings due to his unpredictable size and shape.
John had backed into the corner as Sherlock pinned Anderson, behind Lestrade, who his mind told him was
Sherlock swore and groaned at the confession, unable to stop himself from bucking his hips up against his Omega. He pressed his finger further inside John's hole until he found the small bump of the Omega's prostate, and began to circle the gland teasingly, brushing it with only feather-light touches. He easily added a second finger, scissoring his two digits, John's entrance automatically clenching around them. The Alpha growled in pride at his Omega's tightness, John's gigantic belly gyrating with the Omega's motions; he licked his mate's milk from his lips and moaned at how utterly wrecked John looked. The Omega's body glistened with a thin sheen of sweat, causing his belly to look even heavier and more gravid where it jutted obscenely from between the folds of the fabric. The cups of the babydoll pushed desperately aside, the ripe globes of John's leaking breasts were still pressed together by the garment, milk dribbling from the large, dusky nipples, darkening the material underneath them. John rutting against him like this, holding his own enormous belly, the wet slide of their cocks, John's eager, tight heat - it was all too much. The Alpha arched his back, his panting increasing in pace, whining softly with each shallow exhalation as he came hard, spilling his seed and increasing the slick between them.
needed to pee, and after all Sherlock had made it better. "Better now," he purred as Sherlock whimpered and lined himself up. "You made it better. Come on love, take me."
Ten minutes later, Sherlock's arm was expertly dressed in a crisp white bandage. John had been forced to resort to placing Sherlock's other hand on his belly, challenging him to deduce the movements of their pups, to keep him still and occupied, but it was done. He put the kit away and looked at his mate fondly. "Are you alright now, my darling?" he purred submissively, the touches to his belly pushing him towards his instinctive state again, and his instincts were writhing in glee at having taken care of his mate.
The game flowed well; everyone except John had had at least two drinks and were relaxed enough by the amicable atmosphere and the alcohol to enjoy it. Lestrade turned out to be a particularly good guesser, Sherlock was banned from acting after the group spent twenty minutes trying to decipher his clues for an obscure Medieval text, and even Mycroft deigned to act out a clue, however much he sighed and rolled his eyes. Molly giggled helplessly as he tried to convey
Sherlock kept one arm cozily around his mate's middle and grinned as he reached for the final gift, stripping the wrapping paper off the present where it lay on the covers. His expression changed as the book was revealed, the lustful and teasing expression fading into a look of softness. He seemed almost hesitant as his fingers brushed the embossed leather of the cover, and he opened the book slowly. The Alpha began to tremble a little as he turned each successive page, his eyes misting with emotion as he witnessed their relationship in photographs.
"Mywof!" Benedict demanded suddenly, sitting up and reaching into the air; John turned to look at the door and sure enough there was the pack Alpha, ready to guard and babysit the pups that night.
he smiled, kissing Eleanor's forehead as he scooped her up.
John's breath stuttered and caught in his throat and his eyes grew wide, gazing at his Alpha in shock, more than a little overwhelmed. Tears began to blur his vision as he reached out with shaking hands, daring to stroke over the leather and the shining metal even as a beaming grin began to creep onto his face. He flew at Sherlock, giving him a heated kiss, drawing back only to strip as fast as possible and drop to his knees. When he was naked and kneeling he pressed his face into his Alpha's thigh and rubbed against him adoringly, crooning and sniffling happily until his mate's leg was wet with his tears. He had dropped too far into his Omega to be capable of expressing how absolutely perfect he thought the collar was; all he knew was that he desperately needed to please his mate. Almost shyly, he peeped up at Sherlock with wet eyes, calming himself until he was purring loudly, nuzzling his Alpha's hip and mewling submissively.
"Perhaps I should put the pups to bed," Sherlock suggested quietly, unsure of whether John would want the children's presence or not to help diffuse some of the tension.
John arrived just in time to hear Sherlock's explanation to the nurse. He was pushing one of the prams originally built for their first litter, which contained their 10-month-old quintuplets and their 19-month-old twins; he was in no position to chivvy Sherlock back into the room physically, but the scene before him was so surreal he had to stifle a laugh. "Sherlock, sweetheart, why don't you go and use the bathroom like a big boy? - yes, darling, very good, you've marked it now. Erm, well done. Now off you go and use the big boy toilet please." When the Alpha trotted off to obey, John apologised profusely to the nurse, who simply smiled placidly. "I assure you, I've seen much worse. He's obviously badly concussed, the poor lamb. You go on and look after him, we'll have this cleaned up in no time." "Thank you," John replied sincerely, steering the pram into Sherlock's room. "Mycroft!" he hissed at the flustered-looking pack leader, "what happened? You were supposed to be watching him and he's just pissed all over the door frame!"
John looked at Sherlock, wide-eyed and a little horrified realising he was going to force him to swell
"Hey buddy," Sherlock said weakly, giving a wobbly smile as Felix cuddled happily against him, the pup making himself comfortable in the crook of his father's arm, "You want some time with Daddy, hmm?" He placed a kiss to the pup's forehead and tickled his tummy, making Felix squeal and flail about in delight before breaking into a fit of happy giggles. The Alpha laughed along with his son, the corners of his eyes crinkling merrily. He brushed away a few more joyful tears as the pup tugged on his shirt, begging for another round, to which Sherlock happily obliged, showering him with kisses as he tickled his chubby belly.
The order rolled through the bond and the Omega relaxed slightly, surrendering to his Alpha's authority and guidance. John purred as he raised his hands to the topmost swell of his belly, caressing his bump lovingly; he remembered his training from last time he had been collared and made no move to touch his cock, focusing instead on his massive belly and huge breasts. Arching his back, he smoothed one hand over his breasts, humming in obvious satisfaction, his fuzzy half-formed thoughts slipping through their mental connection;
Sherlock released one of the Omega's hands, his fingers coming to splay possessively over the ripening swell of John's belly.
"and suck you ‘til you're nearly there"
"Perfect Omega," Sherlock purred as he stroked his mate through his orgasm, feeling just on the cusp of his own. He was still in his Alpha, as well, John's obvious desire and need to pleasure him satisfying him immensely. His Omega was built for this, his instinct supplied, to carry his pups and writhe on his cock, to be ready and willing for Sherlock to take whenever he wished. He panted and growled lowly, thrusting harder, one hand still fisting his mate's oversensitive cock, drawing moans and cries from the Omega. With a long groan, he buried himself deep inside his mate, spilling hotly as John's slick, tight walls continued to clench and undulate around him.
The young Alpha replied with an incoherent mumble, closing his eyes and turning to bury his face between John's full breasts - until his mate poked him rather insistently in the ribs. Mycroft raised an amused eyebrow as Sherlock gave a rather put-upon sigh into John's cleavage, the dark-haired male mumbling something that sounded remarkably like, "just because he's my pack leader doesn't mean he's stopped being annoying." At another, firmer poke, he lifted his face once more, and sluggishly rolled off his mate. "Here," he replied as he flopped dramatically onto the mattress beside John, collecting himself to sit up and rest his arms and head on John's gigantic belly. "My mate has been through an incredibly traumatic ordeal,"
Much calmer now that he'd had time to think things over, John snuggled back against his Alpha, each of them holding some of the babies, the others lying on the mattress between their legs. He'd been furious when he found out that Sherlock had bred him - if he was honest, he was still pissed off - but when he'd been feeding Arthur he thought about how he'd have felt in Sherlock's shoes, knowing he'd dropped eggs for him that could have been more of their perfect babies, and his heart ached for the conflict his mate must have felt. The pup cooed happily as he suckled and John's anger softened a little; he'd always known he'd keep the pups, but now he thought about it more, he wondered if it wasn't actually better this way. Carrying his Alpha's pups was what he'd been made for; he knew his remaining eggs most likely counted in single digits. Sherlock hadn't wanted to waste the ones he'd dropped, and John wasn't sure he could bear to waste any of the ones that were left.
intriguing, but it troubled him. "Somebody wanted you to find them," he said quietly, his eyes beginning to shine, "So close to a path, such a deliberate arrangement - it's a display." He could feel his excitement building, his intellect desperate to be used after weeks of latency and distraction - but his Alpha hindered his mind from going into overdrive, begging him to remember the Omega he had to protect and the pups he had fathered. The last thing he wanted to do was to put them in the potential line of fire. The consulting detective huffed and frowned. "Perhaps, but not for long. I ... I think I'd prefer to work this case from home, as much as possible. It's too dangerous to become publicly involved at this point; the murderer obviously has some end in mind here, and I'd rather my mate and I not become a part of it. I will take the case, if you guarantee us your protection until the responsible party is caught."
John whimpered and readily obeyed, heaving himself over the toy before sinking down on it in one smooth movement. He grunted at the relief of finally having something filling his needy hole and hummed pleasantly as he began to move, having to grip the sides of the tub to support his massive bulk as he braced his feet and began fucking himself on the toy in earnest. Like this, pampered and secure in his Alpha's domain, performing for his mate, the Omega felt safe and loved and lost a little more of his conscious mind as he slipped into his Omega and took another step towards subspace.
"Yes, please," Sherlock rumbled contentedly, stroking down the length of John's back, keeping the Omega pressed comfortably against him. "I'll let you choose the place. Surprise me." He licked his mate's cheek affectionately, relishing John's warmth and the feeling of the Omega's gravid body pressed up against him. "Is there anything else?" he asked suddenly, "Other pregnancy issues I should know about?" The Alpha paused thoughtfully, an excited gleam in his eye, "I should research. Gather more data." He looked toward the large volume they'd set aside, reaching down to begin flipping the pages, "Will this tell me more?"
he gasped, his hips stuttering and jerking upwards, his hands cupping the fullness of the Omega's middle with frantic possessiveness. He moaned loudly into John's mouth as he came hard, his blood burning with arousal as he felt the swell of John's belly rubbing against him, pressing firmly into his own flat abdomen.
"Mmm," John purred happily. "And did you give in and touch yourself then? Or did you resist it and wait to wank later? Come on, tell me... I want to be able to imagine you the first time you touched yourself because of me," he murmured seductively, clenching around Sherlock's cock again. "It's only fair... I told you mine..."
Sherlock had slipped out of John sometime during the night, but now felt himself growing rapidly harder again, his cock swelling and pressing up insistently against the Omega's thighs. "Anything for you," he hummed. "But... you're not in heat this time. It won't... feel the same," he said a bit nervously, not wanting to disappoint his partner.
John mewed, nuzzling back in to his Alpha's neck, too overwhelmed to speak; he pushed love, forgiveness, and relief through the bond instead.
"God- look... John-," he'd bit back the word 'mate'; it was too much, "I'm really sorry about what happened. I should have known better- I
After a short while the servant waddled back into the room, pushing a hostess trolley bursting with rich, filling dishes designed to make John swell even larger. He parked the trolley beside Sherlock and retreated with an ungainly bow, anticipating the Alpha's next request after he had finished stuffing his mate by standing next to the Pendleton's Omega Directory, a glossy album full of pictures of the club Omegas and their descriptions.
As more weeks passed, John's lucid periods grew shorter and shorter, dwindling to barely five minutes a day as he entered his eighth gestational month. He knew that the pups would be born any day now, thanks to the two forced swellings he'd enjoyed, and an edge of nervousness began to creep into his scent. He couldn't articulate it when he was himself, but when he was in his Omega he whined and reached for his mate as if he was a security blanket, refusing to let him go at all, needing skin to skin contact with him constantly.
Persephone panted, holding her enormous - now visibly lower - middle as the contraction eased off just a little. The weight of the pups inside her had completely shifted; she could now feel a large head pressing impatiently against her cervix, urging her to open her legs wider. Standing would be impossible even if she had wanted to. While she'd known the risk she was taking when she ventured outside, she'd never expected her children to want to come so swiftly into the world. But there was no time for regrets. "No midwife. I only need you," she replied, shaking her head and breathing deep. "Just you and I, darling. It's no nest of fine cloth, but at least we won’t ruin those precious silks." She took a long inhale as the contraction picked up again, the tightness having never fully left. Her middle clenched tight like a vice, making her grab for Mycroft's hand as she let out a strained groan. The pleasure would come eventually, but she had to bear with the pain first.
John pulled his shirt up over his belly, under his jumper so Mycroft couldn't see, and pressed his palms into the bare skin, feeling the solidity of the gravid swell, feeling the physical proof of Sherlock's love for him, and sent a wave of love strongly towards his mate that was pure and domestic and unshakeable and faithful. He hadn't received any further distress signals, so assumed the bond was now no longer under threat, and righted his shirt as he stepped out of the car and went to wait in the safehouse, thinking he might read for a while until Sherlock came to collect him.
to let everyone know... you could stay here, then, they might not even know I'm being milked at all... they wouldn't know how you made me so full I need to be milked three times a day..."
, he chuckled, rolling them both gently to the side so they could stand.
get over it. I love you, Sherlock, so completely, I'm just... I think it's because I'm so pregnant and vulnerable, it’s making me more Omega. You know I'm practical normally, I wouldn't care how we got here as long as we did. You weren't selfish, love, I... I'm yours now. That's what counts. Don't feel bad, I -I wouldn't change it now, we wouldn't have these thirteen babies to love and cherish. I adore you, husband," he purred softly, lapping sensually at his neck. "Let me show you? Allow me to suckle that magnificent cock until you come?"
His brother's mate, the Omega that Sherlock had willingly shared with him, a man who had allowed him to nurse at his breast; his very existence, what they had shared, was a testament to the vastly improved relationship between the two brothers. Perhaps, with a little more effort, everything could be resolved between them.
Mycroft reached out and took the box with a soft, curious expression. "I have been more than spoiled by all of you today," he murmured in wonder, "this... this is far more than necessary and I am - truly grateful. Thank you, all of you." With a tender smile at Sherlock, Mycroft unwrapped the box efficiently and ran his thumb against the nap of the velvet lid with a small gasp; he suspected what the little box contained, and when he creaked in open he pressed a trembling hand to his mouth as the gleaming gold ring came into view. He worked it out of the cushions and stared, hardly able to take in the crest stamped on it; a signet ring was like the armband and wrist cuff, a sign of his status as pack Alpha, but those were both unique to him and could not be passed on. A signet ring was an heirloom designed to be passed down, the start of a new family tree, something he could pass down to his children and grandchildren, and his descendants would know that they had come from the direct line of a pack leader. Tears stung his eyes and he blinked them away, finally examining the crest - and then he burst out laughing, clutching his sides as tears of emotion and mirth rolled down his cheeks.
," Sherlock said tremulously, pulling himself up just enough to allow John to hear him, his wet, red-rimmed eyes glaring accusingly at his mate. "You aren't now, but you were
Sherlock had been so caught up in the moment with John that he'd forgotten about Mycroft. He purred in pleasure as his Omega spoke to their pups, nuzzling his mate happily, warm feelings of love and pride as swelling in his chest as John praised him. When the doorbell rang he nearly considered not answering, but knowing that Mycroft would just come in anyway, he supposed that he may as well make a proper presentation of his mate. The trousers felt wrong and scratchy against his legs after the feeling of John's skin, his shirt as well - though he made it a point to button it up fully, briefly running a hand through his dishevelled hair as he caught his reflection in the pane of glass over the skull portrait. Taking a deep breath and plastering a smile on his face, he opened the door in one sweeping movement. "Hello, brother."
The Alpha certainly looked as lost as a kitten at the question. "Present?" he asked stupidly. The last twenty-four hours had been such a roller coaster that he'd utterly dismissed or forgotten any thought that John might have an anniversary present for him in return, or at least one that the Omega would still be willing to give. "I don't understand."
Several seats down the Alpha fucking the club Omega's mouth came with a long drawn-out grunt, breathing heavily through his nose. The servant swallowed what he could and allowed the rest to spatter over his face and chest, drawing a deep purr from the Alpha.
big, Sherlock, you're filling me up so completely..." he rocked back onto Sherlock slowly, rhythmically. "My Alpha," he groaned, satisfied.
The grey-haired Alpha swelled with pride, the baby in his arms cooing and kicking happily in response to his pack member's strong feeling. "Yeah," Lestrade answered. "Yeah I am, all thanks to having a pack. I mean, because of you all, I knew I'd have a better chance when something came around - I just didn't think it'd happen so quick. Though I suppose not
Sherlock looked up sharply at the change in his mate's voice, feeling John's concern shift into shame and distress. "John, don't," he said, pulling out of the embrace just enough to sit up and cup his mate's face determinedly between his hands. "I don't
John chose that moment to emerge from the bathroom and saw Sherlock giving another Alpha an absolutely filthy glare, one that looked like it said
Sherlock's hands greedily clasped around John's belly; the Alpha swung a leg over his mate's to pull them more closely together, securing his Omega in his hold as he pressed inside, John's hole already slick and welcoming. He groaned and purred happily, pressing kisses along John's shoulder and suckling at his mate's neck as he began to rock them both. "God, yes, that's it, John-" he encouraged when his Omega began whimpering in pleasure, "Going to take you like this all the time when you swell bigger- won't even be able to rock you with me, your belly will be so enormous, teeming with our babies- I'll just have to do all the movement while you moan and take your pleasure, insatiable, always begging me for more- you're going to want my cock in you all the time, then-" He reached around to take John's smaller member in his hand, smirking in satisfaction as John groaned and arched against him, "I'll have to do this for you, too- you'll be so huge you can't even reach your own cock without my help..."
Sherlock's hand on his belly felt wonderful, as if it was directly connected to the pleasure centre in his brain - he began to pant lightly, only growing wetter as the pumps continued to milk him.
Sherlock shouted as John attempted to move, his vision nearly going white as his mate's motions pulled another shock of pleasure from him. Panting hard, he reached out a hand and blindly groped the air behind him, searching, until his fingers met with the chair. He pulled it towards him and pulled John back, causing them both to cry out again as they crashed together onto the seat. Later, the Alpha would find himself glad of his decision to quietly reinforce all the kitchen chairs, for while the furniture creaked dangerously under their combined weight, it refused to give and send them tumbling to the floor. Sherlock buried his face in his mate's neck. As he recovered himself, his tongue darted out to lick gently across Johns scent gland, and the Alpha began to rock them slowly back and forth - not enough to stimulate, just enough to comfort. "Shhh...," he soothed, one arm resting on John's belly, the other around his mate's chest, holding him close, "Shhh, I've got you. I've got you. Good Omega. Took everything I asked of you. Came so well for me."
Graphic depictions of violence, mentions of forced birth, character death
Sherlock shook his head. He knew all of what John had told him. His mate was gazing at him with nothing but pure adoration, completely conscious and knowing exactly what he'd done; it was obvious John's feelings for him had not changed, but he had not been worrying about John's feelings. "It does not make me any less of a murderer," he breathed, curling in on himself.
Sherlock frowned at his mate's distress; John may as well have been sobbing loudly and squirming away for all the Alpha felt through their bond. He had meant for the revelation to be cathartic, to show his mate more honestly the depth of the feelings he had held back earlier in favour of enjoying their wedding. The Alpha had not planned for them to be caught, but it was little bother to him when they were. They had been sharing such an intimate, loving moment - there was no shame in others knowing of their closeness. Everyone who saw would have immediately recognized the strength of their bond, and the knowledge had made the Alpha proud. John was a superior mate, the most perfect wife, the only Omega to ever catch his attention. In more primitive times, it would have been thought natural and common for such a couple to experience their love wherever they wished, no matter who was watching. Modern social conventions did not bind him nearly as much as they bound his mate; this he was just beginning to realize. He struggled to provide reassurance, to form words to assuage his mate's despair. "No," he managed lowly, nuzzling insistently at John's face, "Nonononono." He closed his eyes, pushing his understanding and adoration back through the bond.
"Ah! Christ... that's.." the Omega mumbled, rubbing his cheek against Sherlock. "Ngh. Need... need to be on my hands and knees, I think. Help me roll over?" Grunting as he shifted, John gasped loudly as he was halfway through the manoeuvre. Fluid gushed down his thighs, soaking the bed as his scent bloomed fully and filled the room;
John was barely coherent enough to communicate, mewling needily as Sherlock's hands roamed over his gravid swell, cupping the sides and sensually exploring every inch of the taut flesh. He blushed shyly at the praise, the triplets beginning to kick in excitement, and John bit his lip, waiting for the moment he knew was coming when Sherlock would be able to feel these pups move in him for the first time.
"Good evening, Sir. May I take your name?" the doorman asked Sherlock, inclining his head in respect.
John pushed through the bond.
"If I could, I'd make you balloon out until you could hardly walk right now," Sherlock replied, his fingers moving expertly over his Omega's cock, "I'd make you swell while I was fucking you, feel your belly expanding right under my hands as  you moaned and our children grew and grew at an astonishing rate. I'd fuck you and then take you right to show you off to everybody, your hole still wet and dripping with my come, your belly so big you'd need to lean on me to stay upright."
Sherlock gave a growling purr as he watched milk squirt from John's nipples and make a mess of the Omega's soft body. He continued thrusting hard into him, making John nearly bounce on his cock with every thrust, the headboard slamming hard against the wall as the bed rocked with the force of his movements. He captured John's lips in his own as the Omega played with himself, taking the kiss deep, trying to find enough satisfaction to come. Something wasn't quite right, however, wasn't quite
"And you'll have to be quiet," John added, "Daddy's head is still sore. Hello sweethearts," he purred, as one by one the eldest litter were released and rushed to him for a quick snuggle before charging into the tent to see their father.
John mewed softly, shivering a little; after going so long without it, the slightest touch of Sherlock's hand was bliss. Lazily pressing kisses onto every inch of his Alpha he could reach, John shifted a little to take some pressure off his still-sore hole and flopped his head dramatically onto Sherlock's shoulder.
For a split second, the easy mask broke and pure, insane rage flashed across the dark-haired Omega's face. The next instant, the smooth smile had returned. "Mmm, you're so sure of yourself Johnny boy," hummed the criminal, absently flicking the nub of the Omega's navel, "So sure of
Sherlock looked up as John spoke, and set Iris down gently. He crawled across the mattress and tentatively wrapped his arms around his mate, letting John choose how much of the contact he wanted. The Alpha allowed more of his apologies to flow through the bond, along with his joy and pleasure. "Thank you. I'm so sorry, John. I
John padded softly into the nest and couldn't help but smile at the sight of Sherlock covered in their dozing, sleeping babies. "Hello love," he whispered, kissing Sherlock's forehead. "Shall I put the pups in their cots, hmm? Then we can curl up together and you can have a little feed before we get ready for our guests later..."
mind that may reject the Alpha's advances, and a sleeping Omega will be naturally pliant and submissive, even encouraging. An Omega can tell when an egg drops or attaches when they are awake, but after the eggs attach they don't *feel* pregnant, as it were, they can't sense the pups until they begin to move at around twelve weeks. I think that covers everything - do you have any questions?"
John whined but opened his mouth for the pastry, eager to please his Alpha. He pushed his quivering belly further into his mate's hands, feeling his navel beginning to strain and push outwards. He took a deep breath and felt it move in small increments. "Oh god, Sherlock... it's going to go, I can feel it, it's going to pop out right here," he whimpered quietly, panting a little, his cock twitching with interest as his instincts writhed in glee at pleasing Sherlock, his nipples stiffening with arousal and lightly tenting the fabric of his shirt. He moaned as Sherlock growled low and held more water to his lips, opening his mouth for it and taking long swallows, fidgeting and wriggling, until finally he felt his belly button force its way out to press against his taut shirt. "Sherlock," he whined quietly, clutching his Alpha.
Curiosity flickered in the Alpha's eyes at the brief mention of John's father; he quickly catalogued the Omega's reaction but said nothing - he knew better than to allow prying questions spoil the moment. But it wasn't prying if John was his mate, right? He wanted to know all about his Omega's life, and yet he had so little data on his wife's parents. Deducing was a heavy temptation, but he knew John would catch him at it immediately. Online research was certainly a possibility, though it would likely turn up little besides names and an address - perhaps a profile or two, if they were those kind of people, but he wasn't altogether certain. He returned John's smile easily and sent equal love back through their connection. There were more important things to focus on here and now.
"Oh fuck- John!" Sherlock's climax came crashing over him at the same time as John's, John's words and bouncing sending him hurtling over the edge, his incredibly hard cock pulsing and spurting deep into his Omega's hole as he rubbed his mate's belly eagerly, sucking and lapping at his growing breasts. He snapped his hips up into the Omega as John ground down on him, milking both their climaxes until they were panting and spent. "Christ, you're so fucking gorgeous." The Alpha kissed his way up his Omega's chest sensuously, leaving a trail of bruised bite marks along the side of his neck and nipping at the shell of his ear. "I want it, John," he whispered in his lowest voice, his hands cupping the Omega's belly, "I want you to walk down the aisle at our wedding having to rely on your best friend just to keep you upright, lumbering with your legs bowed under the weight of your girth, your gravid belly swaying so far out in front of you you're afraid it will burst." He brought John into a slow, languid kiss, "I want you to grow for me, John. I want to see you so full by the end of your pregnancy, swollen out with thirteen full-sized pups in you, needing to eat or be fucked every minute of the day to stay satisfied and keep them healthy, your breasts engorged and heavy and leaking thick, creamy milk... Can you? Will you please?"
Sherlock's eyes moved between the leaking, birthing Omega on the blonde's lap to his own perfect, dripping mate between his legs. "G-god..," he gasped, eventually coming to his senses long enough to answer Eastlake’s question.  "Ye-
Sherlock smiled as he looked over his family, curling protectively around half the litter. The babies snuggled up to him warmly, those that were not touching John all trying to find a place to curl securely against. "Dada," Felix breathed happily, nestling under Sherlock's chin, and Imogen echoed his sentiments from where she was pillowed against her father's stomach.
John felt Sherlock's shy guilt through the bond, as if he was a child who'd been caught with his hand in the cookie jar. He quirked an eyebrow, turning to look at him as he gently placed the sated babies he'd been nursing back onto the mattress. "What?" he managed, shaking his head to clear it as the last of his rational mind returned. "Why you smiling?" The feeling that something was wrong gripped him, and his smile faded, gazing earnestly at his mate. "What is it, Sherlock? Tell me," he begged, biting his lip.
John had begun to pant lightly, every fibre of his being attuned to his mate, focussed only on him and the rhythm of their kiss. He sucked and nibbled gently on Sherlock's plump bottom lip, moaning needily, before slipping his tongue back inside his mate's mouth as he slid one hand down to grab a handful of pert arse and give a cheeky squeeze.
Ten years had done little to change Siger Holmes; time, as did the rest of the world, seemed to submit weakly to the unmistakable power of the man. The iron grey hair and sharply trimmed beard had only grown more steely in colour, the strong, broad shoulders had lost none of their proud formidability. Ice blue eyes, as deathly cold as the Alpha they belonged to, stared sharply down a hawk-like nose at the young couple. The momentary silence was loud as thunder.
. I've marked you all over - even your most modest collar wouldn't be able to hide it. Not that you'd want it to." He felt satisfied at the change in John's scent, humming contentedly as he pressed their foreheads together. The guilt was not quite at ease, but now that his Omega was calm and safe. "My knot is so big because I needed to mark you again, keep you close to me, help you calm. Prove that I'm a better, more satisfying Alpha than my challenger could ever be."
Sherlock growled possessively as he rubbed the Omega's engorged womb, his hips rolling forward in time with John's motions to help his mate along. John's breasts, too, had swollen, and the Alpha lapped at the trail of milk from where it dribbled from one plump nipple before latching on.
"It was just Molly, I hugged her goodbye, that's all, Lestrade's scent must have been on her coat and her hand, I never touched him, he never touched me, still yours, only yours, ah - Christ, Sherlock!
John preened and purred, wriggling happily on the floor and snuggling back against Sherlock.
The Alpha's jaw dropped the instant he caught sight of his mate, a deep blush spreading across his cheeks as his pupils dilated rapidly. He swallowed, collecting himself just enough to close his mouth, and began to walk closer slowly, his world reducing itself to nothing but the very gravid, very
Alpha?! No, the Alpha. Sherlock. "You can't order me, you're not
John purred quietly, unaware of the change, as Sherlock's tongue teased at his nipple while his Alpha mewled for more milk.
The paramedic cleared her throat gently and waited to be acknowledged by the Alpha before speaking. "Your pups are all healthy and strong and are in no immediate danger," she began reassuringly, "but I must advise you against sexual intimacy for the next twenty-four hours. That close to false labour, penetration or knotting could trigger the labour reflex. After twenty-four hours the danger window will have elapsed completely and you can safely do whatever you may wish. To replace the comfort and security of knotting, current medical advice is a gentle but sustained bite on the bondmark followed by thorough scenting by the pack Alpha, to re-establish pack ties. Would you like me to leave you with some sleep aids, or is there any other way I may be of assistance?"
He purred quietly as Sherlock sucked, cradling his head to keep him in place. He wondered idly if Sherlock would take him to the display suites at Pendleton’s, have him milked in front of others, or if they'd stay in the main lounge where he could service his Alpha orally or by hand, and was surprised to discover he didn't much mind either way. As long as Sherlock got the respect he deserved, John found himself not minding how.
. He propped himself up on one elbow so he could keep his eyes fixed on his mate as the pup began to crown. He could hear his Alpha purring encouragements, feel his hands stroking the lower curve of his huge belly, and hooked an arm around his leg to keep it lifted out of the way. He felt the baby's head pressing against his hole, stretching him, the weight of Sherlock's child pushing through his slick passage keeping him focussed. He mewed as the baby pushed against his prostate, crying out sharply as it crowned, and with another strong push, he felt a momentary relief as the head emerged. He panted, grit his teeth, and with another four contractions the first pup slipped from his body into Sherlock's waiting hands.
John purred loudly at the attention, smiling shyly. "I am yours, Sir," he whispered demurely. "Everyone can see it. They can all see the deep mark you left on my neck, they can all see my huge belly, stuffed so full of your pups. They can scent you on me. No-one can doubt it," he murmured, mewling happily at the continued attention to his neck. "Mmm, feels wonderful," he murmured lazily, eyes fluttering shut at the hand on his gravid stomach, soothing the pups, calming them again. "Might have to ask you to calm them like this before my next scan, my Alpha," he mumbled, grinning. "We'd get a better look at them then. We'll be able to see where the boys are and where the girls are... maybe even start assigning names," he breathed, looking extremely pleased with the idea. "And we can start thinking about what to do with the extra bedrooms while the pups are still young enough to need to be in the nursery," he mused, "since it'll be probably a year before they're old enough to all sleep through the night at the same time, and we'll have seven free bedrooms gathering dust... and I guess we should decide if we're going to keep some of those back so we don't have to move some of these ones when we have more," he finished, nuzzling closer to his mate. "What do you think, my Alpha?"
Mycroft softened a little and fought a small smile. "You are well matched," he conceded gracefully. "I would be glad to welcome her into our pack, and give you my blessing."
"Hmmm... No, let's have February 11th. Gives us more time to plan and I'll already be quite obviously pregnant, a couple of extra weeks won't hurt," John smiled, kissing Sherlock's neck and going to finish making the forgotten tea.
The instant the silver-haired Alpha took her small hand in his large, strong one Molly relaxed visibly, clutching it gratefully and smiling happily as she let her mate take control of the conversation. This was what she'd always needed - a nurturing, sensitive Alpha, one who was aware of her nervous disposition and didn't find her slight neediness off-putting. The pack nodded and purred in agreement with the wisdom of Greg's words and John smiled at them both.
Sherlock rested his head on top of his Omega's, taking a moment to revel in their bond. "I would love a ceremony. I would love to marry you, John Watson," he said softly, smiling into his mate's hair and placing the gentlest of kisses there. "Besides," he purred, "Having a ring on your finger will be another mark of how you are mine ... and how I am yours. We will have to plan quickly, however, if we want to find a suit or dress large enough to fit you."
being enough. He snuggled against Sherlock's stomach in reassurance as the Alpha passed Blake to John.
Sherlock hesitated, a part of him immediately wanting to put his foot down and insist that John did not go. He knew what John was saying was true, but it didn't make him like the situation any more. "If I ask you to stop, you will resent me for it, and wish you were able to continue supporting our family," he said simply, "I know what you are saying is reasonable, however, my instincts tell me you must not go. But I give you the choice. I will not force you either way, on this at the moment, rights or no. If there is a severe outbreak of something contagious, however, I want you home."
The Christmas pudding was placed on the table to general applause from the adults and wide-eyed looks from the pups, the blue flames flickering as the scent of brandy and baking filled the air. Mycroft shifted Benedict carefully to the crook of one arm and stood to cut it, keeping the knife well away from the babies. "Now, who wants cake?" he asked, scanning the table, glancing at each of his pack members in turn; "Cake", "Cake", "Just ice cream for me, thanks", "Cake", "Dada", "Cake" -
wanted to keep you for as long as I could even though I believed I could never have you, that you'd be repulsed by the idea of me as a mate. You're correct, I did leave the markers deliberately on you, but I always thought that one day there would come an Alpha bold enough to push beyond them and make an advance. My words at our wedding were true - I always planned on losing you to someone better, more suitable as a mate."
, the Alpha cooed, his eyes half-closed, his fingers curled against John's breast when the doctor returned to the room. She stopped in the doorway, her mouth hanging open at the sight of the half-naked couple on the bed, the formerly imperious Alpha as docile as a pup. "I don't want to interrupt, but I do need to finish a few things, Mr Holmes-Watson," she said, blushing.
he thought to himself as he remembered John writhing on his cock, moaning in ecstasy about how Sherlock had killed to save him, "It would be wise to reaffirm pack ties first, for stability." Mycroft nodded, turning to retrieve the others. Sherlock kissed one of John's nipples and latched on, stroking his mate's breast as he began to suckle lazily.
He returned the kiss eagerly, quickly finding their previous rhythm, growing red-lipped and dizzy from the warmth and need in their embrace. The triplets stretched and squirmed in his womb in response to their parents' emotions and John hummed, sliding his hands up Sherlock's back, spreading his legs still further and drawing his knees up so he could plant his feet on the floor.
John purred demurely, rubbing his belly to soothe the wriggling triplets. "So we can practice for the club," he murmured, peeping up at his Alpha through his eyelashes. "We can get completely comfortable with every aspect of me being your pet at home - we could, um, do obedience training if you wanted... and I know it'll prove your status even more to have me leashed as well as collared. I wanted you to know that I want that too, I want everyone else to see the brilliant, gorgeous, worthy Alpha in front of me for what he is. Now hurry up and open your others," he babbled nervously, shoving the rest of the gifts towards his mate.
can doubt our bond... Married, bonded, a litter of thirteen children... I'll always be there when you need me," he beamed up at his Alpha. "Speaking of which, we should really talk wedding arrangements. At this rate we won't have more than five or six months before I'm too big to walk. Shall we start with location?" he purred, nuzzling Sherlock again, inhaling his scent.
Soon the only sounds in the nest were the contented snuffling of the newborn pups in their cribs, and the joyful, quiet giggles of the mated pair on the bed, intermingled with quick, needy kisses.
he added huskily, nipping at his Alpha's scent gland.
Sherlock pinched one fat, erect nipple, purring louder as it spurted a jet of creamy milk onto his chest.
The Alpha growled loudly, his Omega's completely submissive behaviour heightening his instincts, blurring all other thoughts besides claiming his mate over and over again. He nipped harshly at the Omega's exposed neck, marking him with bite marks and bruises, darkening their bond mark until it was nearly purple. "I'll fuck more into you," he hissed, "Make you grow and swell until you think you're going to burst with my babies. Even when you can't move from how enormous of a litter I've put in you, I'll keep taking your pretty arse every day until you're sore from it but still begging me for more." In one smooth motion, he flipped them back onto the bed and rolled them over so John was underneath him, beginning to thrust rapidly into the Omega as he ran his hands over John's breasts and belly.
Wriggling a little to get comfortable, John begged through the bond for permission to rub his belly and soothe the triplets, who were reacting to the huge increase in pheromones and kicking hard. When he received it he purred with glee and began to sensually caress his bulging middle, running his palms over the swell slowly but firmly, and the pleasure the touches gave him made his scent grow sweeter and more enticing.
John purred stupidly, laying his head contentedly against Sherlock's chest as he was carried to the living room. The scent of a strange Alpha greeted him and he clung to Sherlock's shirt a little more needily, but trusted his mate enough not to whine; he knew his mate would never let anything happen to him. He vaguely registered Sherlock's chest vibrating with speech as the Alpha greeted their guests and cooed happily, pressing his cheek against him.
John spread his legs as wide as they would go and planted his feet on the bed, pushing a little as if seeking better leverage, immersing himself further in the memory of birthing their pups. He could almost feel a pup crowning, he could feel his Alpha's approval and lust and Sherlock's cock thick and heavy against his belly, and he screamed with his orgasm as he felt the phantom pain of labour ripple through him, imagining the baby slipping from him, eased along by the slick from his release.
John grinned back, cooing softly as he covered Sherlock in little reassuring kisses in return. "Alright, sweetheart," he murmured tenderly, "I know you're not done yet, don't worry. We can spoil each other rotten later," he added cheekily, planting a firm kiss on his mate's lips. He watched happily as their babies wriggled and flailed on the bed, giggling as Blake and Felix attempted to taste the bedding to investigate it and screwed up their faces at the texture of the dry cotton. "Twins, hmm?" he breathed, nuzzling his Alpha's curls with a pleased smile, "I look forward to it... it'll be nice having a neat little bump after this lot and these three, at least it'll be easier for me to get about... but then you love watching me waddle, don't you? You love seeing me struggle under the weight of your babies..."
Sherlock groaned lowly, beginning to pant with want as John spoke, stifling a whine at the fantasy. He'd imagined rutting against John's belly before, straddling the Omega as John lay panting and mewling on his back, grinding and thrusting along the massive swell until he came, his seed marking John's full breasts and middle. One hand greedily cupped John's middle as the other snaked around his Omega's back; his index finger pushed aside the strap of the thong and began to circle the slick skin of his mate's tight hole, the pressure light, teasing. "I love how I've made you like this," he affirmed breathily, his hips bucking to meet John's. His eyes were heavy-lidded with lust, fixed on the Omega bouncing and gyrating above him. "Made you... ahh... so enormous... so desperate..." Johns belly swayed ripely, his breasts beginning to leak as he touched them, and the Alpha couldn't suppress a whimper, a large bead of precome forming at the tip of his cock and rolling wetly down his length. "Fuck... you were made for this... look so good... so- nnh- perfect..."
The servant groaned lowly, voluptuous teats slowly heaving at the feeling of a warm tongue against his skin, cleaning up the milk that ran in thick rivulets down his gravid torso. His nipples were pert and dark, and wept heavily in his arousal. He let his head loll back as he panted. The babies in him began to awaken and move at the touch, warping his full belly and stretching happily at the sense of another Omega's touch. With a soft grunt of arousal, he thrust his belly forward, beginning to rub his full globe against John's as they caressed one another, their touches becoming gradually more heated.
Beatrice looked at the floor demurely, waiting for an order, before she remembered that she was no longer collared. She touched her throat, almost confused by the lack of the thick leather band, and hesitantly forced herself to peek upwards and meet her son's eyes. Her mouth wobbled slightly, but she didn't cry. She was stronger than that.
... Very soon you'll be able to feel our pups moving and squirming inside me, fighting for space as they grow... ohhhhhh," he moaned decadently, Sherlock's cock jolting pure ecstasy into him with every thrust.
good Omega." He moaned loudly as John rocked faster, the Omega's belly and breasts swinging as he fucked himself frantically on the Alpha's cock. "Oh god, John, yes- that's it-," he panted, feeling his orgasm coiling tightly in his stomach, on the brink of release, "Louder- want to hear you- "
John mewled as the knot entered him; he hadn't been expecting it, but it triggered a fresh wave of love and contentment and pleasure in him and he clung a little tighter to Sherlock as he rocked with him, his body greedily sucking the firm knot further inside and holding it tight, milking it to extend his lover's release. He kissed Sherlock again, unable to stop his orgasm, pulsing sweetly and feeling sparks of pleasure zing up his spine and through to his fingertips, the sensation of his Alpha's hard cock jerking and spurting inside him only making it better. He couldn't think, he could barely breathe; there was only Sherlock, their connection, them, and John was past being able to send coherent words but it didn't matter - they were one, and he knew Sherlock could feel every wave of exquisite bliss that rolled through him, could feel how utterly content he was, could feel their hearts beating as one. Softly, John broke the kiss, gasping down great lungfuls of air as - at last, after what must have been two or three full minutes - his orgasm finally subsided. He whimpered happily, nuzzling Sherlock's cheek and peppering affectionate, grateful kisses along his jaw.
Sherlock patted Felix's back gently as he walked him back and forth under the spray, murmuring to him softly. "No one's forgotten about you," he soothed, "Daddy loves you very much and he does want to spend time with you, yes..." He kissed his hair and chuckled as he felt the tiny rough tongue against his skin. A playful gleam in his eye, he adjusted his hold on the baby, bringing his fingers to tickle lightly the soft skin of Felix's tummy.
, he sent through the bond, too far into his Omega to speak.
" he didn't stumble over the words as he spat them from his mouth with as much contempt as Siger ever did, "a-and e-e-everything w-will just be o-open t-t-to me. A-and then y-you s-say we c-can be
, reaching for her hand and taking it quietly, discreetly, giving it a reassuring squeeze. "Mycroft was right, you know," he murmured, only loud enough for her to hear. "You really are extraordinary. And you deserve someone who will worship the ground you walk on."
John moved the wand over the round globe of his stomach slowly, showing the Alpha each of his babies in turn. They were all growing well and looked perfectly healthy. John smiled widely and kissed his mate's lips sweetly. "Thank you for filling me with your pups, love. Now I think today would be a good day to announce them, don't you? If we swear Mrs Hudson to secrecy we can tell her first... Best make sure she's sitting down before we tell her how many you put in me," he smiled, cleaning the gel off his belly. He got off the bed, a little unbalanced from the new weight in his womb, and had a quick shower before dressing efficiently, a thin vest which clung to his pert breasts and round bump under a blue cotton button-down shirt. He threw on a jumper over the top, a baggy one, but the outer curve of his belly was still visible. He went to Sherlock, claiming a tender kiss and seeking his approval. "Once I've put my parka on the bump won't be visible."
Mycroft leaned in, looking carefully to Sherlock for assent, and nuzzled John's belly gently, marking him with approval. John began to rock his hips as best he could, desperate for more of his mate's cock, reaching back to fist his hands in his mate's dark curls as the rest of the pack rubbed his belly, following the movements of the pups who were happily wriggling, excited by the familial bonding hormones.
" he mumbled plaintively, unable to stand so crawling towards Sherlock slowly on all fours, as if drawn to him by magnetic force, wanting to fight it but Sherlock's order making it impossible. He wasn't sure really how much he minded. If Sherlock hated him later, he could blame that order. He'd never have unlocked the door otherwise. Probably.
Sherlock blinked, a blush spreading high along his cheekbones. He licked his lips, skin prickling, feeling an almost magnetic pull towards his sibling stirring in his stomach. The young Alpha slowly rose from his seat. He craved this - Mycroft's praise, his approval, his
The Omega mewled and writhed at the praise, thrilled that his Alpha was so pleased with him. When he felt his mate come in him it pushed him over the edge again, making him wrap himself tighter around Sherlock to keep him inside as long as possible. "Tell me how you bred me, Sherlock," John whispered hotly, clenching around his thick member. "Tell me exactly how you filled me up... was I a good Omega for you? I love thinking about how you filled me with your children back in Baker Street... I want to think about how you filled me with your triplets too," he murmured seductively, kissing his mate's neck, his scent needy and inviting, encouraging a knot to reassure the Omega that the Alpha would stay to not only look after the existing pups, but to nurture the new ones growing in his belly. Gazing up into his mate's eyes, he smiled and pushed love and approval through the bond.
, he managed to communicate, somehow finding the words even as he felt the urge to claim John again rising,
"I know you deleted much of what you learned about traditional Alpha behaviour a long time ago, brother mine," Mycroft murmured, his voice full of affection for his younger sibling, "but I believe your pups are now old enough for the recall reflex to have developed fully... Growl, from your chest rather than your throat, and see what they do." The ginger Alpha held back a smile at the thought; he had seen videos online of Alpha fathers growling and their pups instantly crawling over to crowd against them, thinking that danger was nearby and they needed to be as close to their father as possible so he could protect them. John carefully avoided Mycroft's eye; as a doctor he knew that the recall reflex couldn't be far away in their pups, and knew he'd giggle if he looked at his brother-in-law.
Mycroft opened his mouth to protest the harsh punishment; John surely wouldn't deny him access to his own pack? "
look John was giving him.
Mycroft almost swore aloud at the traffic, every traffic light he met mysteriously turning green, impatient and apprehensive. His stomach was tying itself in knots and suddenly he felt six years old, called into his father's study to be belted for some minor infraction. He lifted his wrist to his nose and sniffed delicately. Fear. Well, he thought wryly, some things never change.
On the stage, the lights had begun to dim. Brendan was cooing happily, eyes closed in bliss, as the four Alphas crowded around him to stroke him and nuzzle him. Their murmurs grew softer as the sound system faded too, and soon the only sound in the suite was the purring of a contented Omega pet and the proud growls of a satisfied Alpha.
At that, Sherlock gave a growl of triumph, lunging forward to pounce on his mate and pin him back against the covers. He rutted his enormous cock against the Omega's belly in a few frantic, hard thrusts before suddenly he was coming too, his spent cock dribbling short pulses of come onto the ripe globe of John's middle. "Mine," he rumbled, lips pressed hotly against his mate's ear as he worked the Omega through his orgasm, "Mine....
. Oliver was what Sherlock could never have been, or grown to be for Victor. "You're perfect for one another," Sherlock stated softly, his words a response to the Alpha but his eyes gazing with softness at his old friend.
"John, John, John..." Sherlock chanted as his partner's orgasm triggered his own release. He spilled deep inside the Omega, shuddering as John contracted around him, no knot forming this time, since his body knew the other man was already pregnant. "Oh, fuck, my beautiful Omega. All mine…"
"Enora…"
John snuggled closer eagerly, pushing himself against his mate like a kitten demanding attention, his eyes sliding closed lazily as Sherlock stroked his hair. He was aware there was another Alpha nearby, but not a threatening one; Lestrade's scent told him that the man would defend him if Sherlock was unavailable, so he could relax in his presence. He had been dropping in and out of his Omega more frequently of late, and the morning's exertions meant he was slipping into it more easily. He pressed his nose to his Alpha's throat and inhaled, settling further into Sherlock's lap.
"They'll be born at the end of July, so they won't need winter knits until they're almost six months old," John was saying thoughtfully. "I thought I might do them little cricket jumpers, swap the colours of the stripes around. Have black in the middle, and each pup's colour for the outer two. I might need your help with that, actually... once I'm bedbound I'll be in my Omega state most of the time but I'll still need something to do, and something like knitting would fit the bill. If you can keep me supplied with wool and needles, the good ones because Sherlock won't know what to buy, I can have them finished by the time they're born." He grinned a little at the idea, only half listening as Mrs Hudson flapped and twittered excitedly, watching his mate and Mycroft instead; he couldn't make out much of their conversation, only disconnected words.
insane?" the dark-haired Omega asked, looking bored and insulted. "Can't have big bad daddy Alpha coming back and interrupting us. That would be no fun at all." John glared at him, still shuffling further away, knowing it was futile to try to stand but appeasing his instincts which demanded as much distance between Moriarty and himself as possible. "What do you want," John snapped, his face a mask, rubbing his belly protectively and praying Sherlock would be quick.
he smiled, sending warmth and love along with his words. The rest of the pups wriggled and burbled on the floor, propped up against their parents, and soon they were all settled again and ready to watch a film.
"I guess it is," Sherlock smiled. He dropped his gaze thoughtfully. "It... doesn't feel cliché with you," he murmured, "It's pleasant. Enjoyable. It would be mundane with anyone else, but never with you." The Alpha glanced almost hesitantly up at his mate, hoping he had said the right thing. He'd never forget the night he answered John honestly, musing that their bonding would have always been an accident, and the Omega had been inconsolable in his disappointment.
He was beyond speech, beyond being able to think of anything but his Alpha's lips and tongue exploring his wet hole; they hadn't indulged since the pups had been born, and John was suddenly a little apprehensive that having birthed thirteen babies would mean the experience wasn't as pleasant for his mate.
"Open the larger one first," he explained when he sank down on the mattress, handing John both gold-wrapped parcels. He said nothing more in the face of John's curiosity, only motioning for the Omega to open what he'd been given, his pupils dilating in anticipation as John tore away the paper and lifted the lid of the rich red box underneath. The air seemed to vibrate with anticipation as he lifted the lid.
John blushed a little at the gasp and the look of pure shock on their landlady's face as she spluttered and tried to ask questions, her voice only audible by dogs and bats. "
"There's nothing quite like knotting your pregnant mate, is there?" Eastlake mused softly, licking his lips as his gaze fell back to John. "Especially when they're that close to whelping..."
"John," he intoned urgently, pulling back as if he was afraid they might miss their chance by wasting another minute, "
John knew exactly what Sherlock was doing to himself and the image made his mouth water. He crawled off the bed and towards the door, shaking, reaching for his handcuffs. If he could handcuff himself to something in his room, he'd be safe. "If you don't order me to stay I might not be able to stop myself coming out... and then you'll fuck me, and then you'll hate me," he called, trying not to rut against the carpet, knowing his increasing arousal would only spur Sherlock on.
find out... that data will always be beyond your reach," he coaxed, rubbing his fingers together, licking them and recoating them in his juices before offering them to the Alpha once more.
Sherlock kissed John softly, his hands roaming the curve of the swell just below the Omega's navel. "More than anything," the Alpha rumbled, resting his head against his mate's shoulder. In his post-orgasmic haze, he allowed his gaze to wander contentedly over John's gravid form. The Omega's panties had fallen to his knees, and he toed them off for his mate - and after another moment of consideration, he briefly stopped his other ministrations to undo the clasp at the front of John's top, and allowed his mate to wriggle out of the racy green garment. The Alpha's fingers traced the roundness of John's pert breasts, and trailed over the Omega's rosy nipples before coming to rest on his belly again. "You're perfect," he purred in his mate's ear, nipping playfully at the lobe, "Putting yourself on display for me, wearing exactly what you knew I'd like... You're perfect this way, too, naked and exposed to me, your gorgeous belly out - just like it should be." Still knotted, he continued to rub John's heavy middle. "My pups are so active inside of you, so healthy and eager to grow... Just imagine what they'll do to you when they start getting even bigger... Your belly will never be still, you'll have your hands on it constantly, just trying to calm my enormous litter down." He licked along the shell of John's ear. "You'll be completely preoccupied with caring for my pups inside you, completely Omega, whining and crooning at your belly day and night, wholly lost to your instincts…"
Three tiers for three months, Beatrice had told them proudly as she presented the couple with the decadent cake.
Sherlock automatically tapped out
we can shower."
"John, I-" Sherlock began, his eyes catching the garments strewn across the floor before they came to rest fully on the Omega. The Alpha nearly dropped his treasure, blood pounding in his ears as he inhaled sharply. The scent of pregnant Omega nearly overwhelmed him. It was dizzyingly heady, heavy, intoxicating. Sherlock's cock throbbed painfully inside his trousers as it thickened and lengthened in response to the pheromones, and to the sight of the gorgeous, gravid, lace-clad creature in front of him. He slowly made his way over to the bed, drinking in the sight of him. Sherlock sank down on the mattress, unconsciously toeing off his shoes. John's belly seemed incredibly, impossibly bigger, and Christ, he was
John cried out breathily with every bounce, rippling his walls around his Alpha's cock to increase his pleasure, his channel silky and hot and tight, almost milking his mate's cock, his volume increasing as requested. "Aaaahhh... hhaaaahhh... ahhh, my Alpha, so good, you feel
Sherlock inhaled sharply, his fingers tightening around a black-and-yellow-striped onesie. For a moment, he looked torn, his eyes flicking between the Omega and the tiny, very-much-resembling-a-bee garment. "Just this," he said in a small, tight voice, "And then we go." He hurried John back to the register and had thirteen put on layaway, to be picked up by one Mycroft Holmes in the near future. He sighed happily when the purchase was made - before immediately taking his Omega's hand and whisking him out the door. John smiled fondly as Sherlock bought the tiny bee-striped onesies, thinking how cute it would be when their thirteen babies were kicking and wriggling around him in the nest wearing them, and grinned in earnest when Sherlock pulled him out of the shop.
by invitationing - invicting - inv - asking me to come though, did you Johnny? Didn't wanna taint it with me an' my failed bond. Didn't wanna
the Alpha murmured, dropping down to press a soft kiss to the curve of John's stomach,
"Shh," Sherlock hummed, cupping the fullness of John's belly in both his hands and stroking the swell. He kissed John tenderly, moving to caress the Omega's breasts, circling and thumbing over John's obviously erect nipples. "If you hadn't had your jacket on, everybody would have seen how full you are. Just look at you, straining against your shirt - you're almost leaking, aren't you?" He dipped his head to suckle at John's scent gland as he relieved his mate's strained buttons, pushing open John's shirt. Sherlock purred in pleasure at the vibrant colour of the bra, John's breasts obviously straining against the garment in their fullness, desperate to be nursed. He pushed aside the fabric to reveal the Omega's large, plump nipples, darkened and erected, small beads of moisture already forming at the tips. He lapped them away gently before latching onto one.
"But you still hurt," Sherlock panted out, pure instinct dictating that he reach out a hand to stroke the rapidly warping skin of the Omega's middle, caring for his distressed pups. His fingers shook. "So it wasn't good enough. I- I wasn't good enough..."  His erratic, gasping breaths began to even as the hormones took hold, John's scent tranquilizing the broken Alpha, drawing him out of the terror of his panic attack. His head pillowed on his mate's breasts, Sherlock's eyes filled with tears. Wet droplets spilled over and rolled down his cheeks. "It was monstrous, what I did..."
"Oh open mine next, I'll burst if you don't see it soon," Mrs Hudson chimed in, beaming at them and nodding eagerly at the lurid violet wrapped gift with a large candy pink bow. John chuckled as he saw the top of Sherlock's nose crinkle just slightly in distaste at the gaudy paper and decoration before he picked it up and began to open it.
The Alpha obliged happily, placing both his hands over his mate's swollen middle and beginning to rub in gentle circles. He could feel the slight patter of the triplets underneath his touches, and purred all the louder for their unborn babies. Sherlock's eyes sparkled as several of the pups stopped their antics at the loud, low sound, their little eyes wide in awe as they stared at their sire with rapt attention. As if on cue, several scrunched up their faces with a determined look, balling their tiny fists in frustration as they tried to mimic their father.
Sherlock's eyes lit from where he lay in the nest.
John began to feed the pups in tandem, with Sherlock and Mycroft giving some of the remaining pups their warmed bottles; once the Omegas had laid the table they came back through to help feed the little ones and soon enough the thirteen babies were seated in their high chairs at the table, cooing excitedly at the sight of the feast spread out for the adults. Just as John was trying to persuade Benedict to let go of him long enough to let him sit down the doorbell rang, and Greg and Molly called out their greetings from the hallway.
Only a couple of hours later, the pups began to wake and cry for milk; John stirred sleepily as a sharp cry pierced the air, only to find Blake and Benedict already nursing at his breasts, the other pups all being held and fed bottles by Beatrice, Catherine, Remington and Mrs Hudson. Beatrice and Mrs Hudson had three babies each, being older and more experienced; Catherine and Remington could handle two, and Sherlock was gently lifting Enora out of her crib. John purred and shuffled up the bed, cradling the pups at his teats, their little mouths working quickly as they fed from him.
as his mind gave itself over to sleep's gentle embrace.
"Everything is going to be fine," John promised seriously. "My body accepted thirteen pups, it wouldn't have done that if it couldn't carry them all until it’s safe to deliver them. Our bond is one of the strongest
seeping through him. He hummed approvingly as Sherlock latched on to his breast and began to suckle quickly and eagerly, just like an infant, drawing out the last of his milk. He gathered the lanky detective into his arms and cradled him like he would a pup curled around his swollen belly, crooning to him softly. "That's it love, all for you... you're a hungry boy today, hmm? That's right my darling, have a good feed..." He felt Sherlock's tongue teasing at his plump nipple as his mate began to make soft little grunts, like the babies would when they wanted more milk, and John felt his body respond, more milk filling him to be drained into Sherlock's greedy mouth. After a while he nudged his Alpha gently across to the other breast and tangled a hand in his curls, holding his head in place, still crooning, rocking him slightly, content to let him nurse as long as he wanted.
