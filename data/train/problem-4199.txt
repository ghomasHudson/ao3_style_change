Taking a deep breath, he takes out a cigarette from the packet and puts one end in his mouth, lips wrapping around it. Cupping one palm around his mouth and the cigarette, he clicks on the trigger of the lighter, blue flame bursting out of the small nozzle, and lights up the butt of the cigarette. He spins the lighter with one hand while he wraps the other one around the chain, letting the coldness of the metal soak into his skin while the familiar smell of cigarette smoke fills his nostrils.
“You sure I have to go inside? I mean, I can go to some bar nearby and wait till the party ends then I can come and drop you off at your home.” Dean offers even though he knows it’s a futile attempt. Donna asked him to attend a charity gala she’s invited to as her plus one. He didn’t want to go at first but then Donna pulled out the big guns and made a deal with him that she would bring him donuts for the rest of the month if he accepted the invitation. It was a no brainer to accept the offer after that. And that’s how he ended up sitting inside his Baby with Donna, wearing a suit and fancy shoes.
Did something happen? Did you meet someone new? OMG!” By the time Charlie finishes talking, she’s almost jumping up and down on her chair, clapping her hands like a child with a sugar rush. Dean quickly grabs her arm tightly, eyes going wide.
Donna smirks, laughing a little and shifts her attention to Claire, “Don’t you look gorgeous, Claire.”
“Yay! I’m so excited!” Claire squeals, clapping her hands. Cas isn’t too fond of how close Claire got to Dean and how
Balthazar drapes his arms around Cas’s shoulder as they turn towards Dean and his friends’ booth, nodding vigorously, “I thought I would come and see my favorite person in the world and surprise him.”
A moment of awkward silence passed before Sam spoke up, “So...when I told you to talk to Cas, I didn’t mean stick your tongue down his throat kinda talk.”
“Can you pack mine too? I am not allowed to move my shoulder too much right now.” As if Dean had forgotten about the doctor's instructions.
Dean almost falls onto his knees the moment he hears the word ‘coma’. Words fail to come out of his mouth as he tries to speak. The nurse seems to understand his speechlessness.
“Dean! Cap' said according to the survivors, there are some people stuck in room 511!” Benny calls out after inquiring about the number of people who were in the building from the ones who managed to escape. Dean nods, waddling through the sea of smoke and flame, using the stairs to get to the 5th floor in record time with Benny on his heels. Benny finds four citizens stuck on the fifth floor, looking absolutely terrified and weak, clearly having breathing problems. They help usher everyone out while checking around for any other trapped people.
Lee grins back, pulling Dean away to a side as more people walk through the garage doors. Dean’s eyes find a pair of familiar soft blue eyes in the crowd but the blue eyes don’t find him just yet.
Meeting Michael after months has been refreshing, he missed his big brother very much. The constant worry about his daughter was present inside his heart the whole time he was away but he
The night is silent, with the sky void of stars and moon and covered with clouds. A whisper of breeze makes him shiver a bit but he ignores it and starts walking down the street. He remembers there’s a playground after a few blocks, where he used to go when he was in high school. Stuffing his hands inside the pockets of his sweatpants to keep them warm, he moves towards the direction of the playground.
After Balthazar ends his call with a loud yawn, claiming he needs his beauty sleep, Cas finishes stripping and enters the shower. He let the cool water lift the weight on his shoulders, the stresses, and anxiety of managing his business with his brother. He lets his mind run free, and for the first time, thinking about the future he hadn’t dared to contemplate on before. Maybe Dean was right, after all, this time will be different.
Dean rushes back and forth, preparing a table full of snacks and candies for the kids while trying to ignore Donna bellowing orders from upstairs.
“Claire, how in the world did you get your dad to wear that beard?” Dean asks, smirking. Cas gives him a silent death glare as he replies with “With great difficulty.” in a dry tone.
Dean knows Sam is probably busy with his job hunt yet he decides to call him because seeing Ca- seeing
The words soothe Dean, his shoulders sagging, and he turns around, as his smile returns, “Oh, I don’t know, Cas, I’m kind of a pain in the ass.” Dean smirks, shifting his weight from one foot to another.
Cas looked at Dean, who’s watching them the whole time without saying a word... just observing them. He smiled a little, “Hello, Dean. How are you?”
“Did you take your medicines after dinner?” Dean’s voice cleared out his thoughts. He was laying on his side of the bed, blanket already pulled up to his chest and his body a picture of relaxation.
“Heya Cas,” Dean greets with a small smile. He’s wearing a casual black AC/DC t-shirt with a swamp green jacket over it with black pants and brown combat boots. As usual, he’s looking devastatingly beautiful.
The weekend begins with vanilla pancakes and delicious chocolate syrups or as Cas would call it “hyperglycemia on a plate”. Dean has promised to take Claire to the carnival on the other side of the town which is why they get ready to go right after breakfast. Dean makes sure to get his wallet and keys as Claire brings along her small pink backpack which matches her very cotton candy pink strawberry dress.
Cas’s eyes meet Dean’s panicked ones for a brief second but he quickly diverts his gaze back to Sam as if nothing happened.
On one side, he’s happy to be a part of Sam’s celebration but on the other side, Dean will be there. And if…
Charlie simply rolls her eyes, “That’s bullshit, but if you’re not ready to talk about whatever’s got your panties in a twist, then okay. I know how you have chronic emotional constipation. You wanna run an errand with me?”
Sam hands her the gift- a rainbow unicorn soft toy wrapped up wrapping paper. Claire rips away the paper and hugs the soft toy tightly, smiling broadly and thanking Sam over and over again.
Dean manages to keep his thoughts at bay for most of the day. Charlie and Sarah get bored halfway through the day and decide to pull a harmless prank on Garth. They squeeze some lemon into Garth’s cup of milk. The poor lad didn’t know what hit him until the milk touched his lips, and Charlie and Sarah simultaneously collapsed to the ground in tears with giggles. Dean shakes his head as the scene unfolds but he can’t help smiling a little bit.
“Come here,” Dean says, taking off his mask and handing it over to the man. The man takes it without hesitation. The man’s eyes are red-rimmed and unfocused; he fumbles with the mask before putting it on his face. The area of the wall beside them begins to fall apart, and a rush of fire brushes close to Dean. Without waiting for a moment, Dean pulls the man close to him by gripping his waist tightly.
Cas hears Dean speaking to Sam in a low voice as he rests his head against the backrest. His arm which is laying on the couch touches Dean’s side but since Dean doesn’t seem to mind, he doesn’t move it. Gradually, the deep timbre of Dean’s voice and the warm feeling inside his chest, along with the touch of Dean’s body, lulls him to sleep.
Dean laughs, “Well, it rhymes! I’ll see you around, Claire.” Dean pulls away and opens his arms out for Cas even though he’s not sure Cas would want a hug after the emotional flashbacks they experienced. But like a fucking magnet, Cas steps forward, letting Dean wrap his arms around him slowly. Cas hugs back, burying his face in Dean’s shoulder. Dean buried his nose on Cas’s shoulder, taking in his scent: a hint of cologne with his usual musk, which reminds him of the days he’d spent in his arms back when everything was normal and young. Cas had always loved Dean’s hugs; it was the one place he felt safe and loved is what he used to tell Dean.
“Today, the firefighters came to our school. They are throwing a party for the kids at Halloween. Can I go? Please? All of my classmates are going. Pretty please?” Thrusting the paper at him, Claire looks at Cas with puppy eyes and a pout which does nothing to make Cas refuse. But he hesitates given the fact that he’s trying his best to keep away from a certain green-eyed man who, somehow, has already managed to invade his thoughts...yet again. Cas rubs his face and leans back, resting his back against the padded headrest of his chair, sighing. He looks down at the paper on his hand and reads the invitation written on it with fancy fonts aloud.
Back to our fic... this isn't a long chapter or short..just medium size we guess. And the songs we used are on the playlist of the fic so we recommend listening to it while reading the chapter and in case Spotify isn't available in your country here's the link to youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXG3Tg35jfI
A week after Cas got released from the hospital, Dean enters the Novaks’ house after coming from his shift. Today’s been a lazy day. No senior citizen got into trouble nor did any people thought it would be fun to put their head into a microwave oven.
The team gets ready and quickly speeds down the roads of Lawrence, reaching the site within a few minutes. Halting on their feet, they gape at the fire erupting out the windows from the fifth floor, along with the other floors.
“Bye.” Cas takes off the earbud and carefully parks the car in the school parking lot. It’s a close call since only two minutes are left for the school to end.
Cas lowers his head, trying to concentrate on making the batter for waffles, “He does… I mean he did. He did. He helped a few times. But things changed...again.”
The next chapter might be added tomorrow. 'Till then, enjoy and don't forget to leave kudos if you like it. <3
“Thank you!! Isn’t she the best?” Claire hugs the toy which is approximately half her size. Dean laughs, “She is. How about we get some food and show this off to your dad, huh?” Claire nods eagerly.
“No wait, wait, I have more questions,” Dean says quickly, “What happened the other day? Why did you kiss me?”
After Dean reunited with Cas in the dock, they went to the house Cas lives in. It's a small cottage, filled with warmth and homeliness. They figure things out. They laugh at each other, laugh with each other. They bicker as usual. but it's filled with love and affection. They build a life together, standing side by side. Their loved ones, especially Jack, visit them sometimes. Cas has work to do too. He is still helping Jack to improve everything. Dean often jokes how he's the Robin to Jack's Batman.
“Woah, what’s going on here, kids?” Dean intervenes. Claire whips her head around, eyes going wide as her gaze rests on Dean. Charlie is close behind, hands on her hips.
“Take care of yourself. And don’t worry, you’ll do great at the photoshoot.” Cas says, hugging his friend tightly. Balthazar lets go of him with a friendly slap on his back.
“What the- Dean? What are you- are you stalking me now or something?” Cas asks, looking extremely baffled.
On Thursday night, Cas leaves Claire with Dean, along with a bag filled with her clothes, books and enough toys to last two days. Of course, Claire has been absolutely ecstatic since the moment Cas told her about the trip. He wants to feel upset that his daughter isn’t sad that he’s leaving for two days but seeing Claire’s happy face can’t make him feel anything but content. On the way to Dean’s place, she says, “I can’t believe I get to spend two days with Dean!” Cas just laughs, shaking his head before concentrating on the car navigation app since this is the first time he’s going to Dean’s loft. Dean, naturally, welcomes Claire into his home with open arms and a bright enough smile to make him feel lightheaded with warmth. Cas drags Claire’s bag through the door while Dean carries Claire inside in his arms. Cas has a quick glance around the loft, impressed by the simplicity. Even though it is a small living space, Dean had managed to make it still feel like home. It’s an open floor plan with exposed brick walls and ceiling to floor windows, which takes up one whole wall. He spies a staircase beside the windows.
“Can I ask you a question?” Castiel’s voice from the doorway made Dean look up from where he was getting his clothes out of the closet to pack up for the trip. He was standing at the door, leaning his elbow against the doorknob.
Turning on the tap with a quick twist, he puts his hands under the water. The coldness of it makes him almost flinch and his hands tremble. Rubbing his hands to make them burn, Dean tries to get the blood out of his hands.
“Remember the little girl, Claire?” Donna asks after a few moments. Dean just grunts in reply. “Well, she’s lucky you got to her dad in time, otherwise that poor kid would have lost him too.” The last part of the sentence gets Dean’s attention.
Dean slowly turns his head to his left side to see Cas, in his office suit and tie, gazing back baffled and confused.
“Take him,” Dean says to Charlie. They settle him down on a gurney carefully and strap him to the gurney with the belts.
“So, you're gonna introduce me to your new friends?” Balthazar asks, finally removing his arm from Cas’s shoulder.
“I know, Dean,” Seems like Dean said it out loud since Donna tries to speak to him in a calm voice, “But you are not in the condition to do it. It’s already a conflict of interest since you know him so I cannot let you do it if you act like this. It will make it difficult for us and it might make him more uncomfortable than he already is.” The words of his captain grab Dean’s attention. Of course, she’s right.
He’s on a lunch break when he receives a text from Cas asking if Dean wants to come for Claire’s birthday. He stops and stares at the message, not knowing what to do. Charlie sneaks up behind him, peeking past his shoulder.
“Fine, then I’m coming with you, brother,” Benny nods solemnly, fixing his gear, as if he's talking about going to buy something and not going inside a collapsed building, risking his life. The building shakes and Dean grabs onto the staircase railing. He closes his eyes, praying to make it out alive. When the build stops shaking, he hears Donna through the radio.
“Yeah? So you didn’t punch a dirtbag just to cause drama?” Dean tsks, his insides feeling like jelly at the possibility of talking about the past with Cas without any problem. Balthazar chuckles while Charlie grins widely, “Cas punched someone? Wow.”
Dean’s mind races, can he just go up the stairs real quick and pretend like he didn’t see anything? No, no he can’t. Because after hugging Charlie, Cas quickly strides up to Dean.
“It’s a coincidence, sweetheart.” Cas corrects her. “She is still learning some big words,” Cas tells Dean and Sam, without looking away from his daughter.
Around five minutes past five, Dean opens the white wooden ornamental door of Raven & Company and steps inside the store as a bell rings above his head. Walking up to the reception, behind it is a woman with purple short hair sitting and going through a fashion magazine, Dean knocks on the glass counter. She notices him and stands up gracefully.
“It’s not that easy, Balthazar. I can’t just ‘cut the ties’,” Cas replies, using his fingers, which are now sticky with waffle batter, to air quote, “Even when I try to avoid him, he pops up out of the fucking blue,” Cas groans, putting the waffle maker on the countertop as Balthazar watches him.
“It’s really great to see you again, Cas. Never thought we’d be doing this,” Dean says, smiling shyly, “Maybe we should do this again sometime? Just like old times.” Dean suggests after deliberating for an instant. It is now or never.
“And don’t you say anything like that ever again, got it?” Dean’s voice is a bit louder than he wants it to be, however, hearing things about Cas or his family made him too angry to notice. The boys nod afraid and scurry off to class.
“Oh shit, yeah, I’m fine. I was just busy with some paperwork, I didn’t really check my phone. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you like that,” Dean says. Cas sighs loudly in relief that Dean is okay.
Bracing himself to face some hot woman with a shiny hair and beautiful outfit, Dean turns his face to the direction Cas has just pointed. The moment he sees whom Cas has brought, he almost lets out a burst of relieved laughter but stops himself at the last moment. Instead, he watches Claire, in a pretty dark blue and white dress, talking to someone on the phone, her face smiling as she looks at the phone screen, legs swinging as they hang from the chair that she’s perched on.
“Yes and yes, I brought her along, it’s all good. I FaceTimed Gabe, and now she’s busy talking to him while I meet some of the guests,” Cas replies.
“Hi, and of course!! The more the merrier! And any friend of Cas is a friend of ours, right Dean?” Sam looks pointedly at Dean who ignores it to stare at the way Cas and Balthazar- his name seems as slimy as his smile right now- are standing too close. “You want a drink?” Sam offers to which Balthazar nods eagerly. Cas is still too busy looking all smiley and happy with his
This time Cas rolls his eyes humorously, “God, you’re annoying. But seriously, promise me you won’t hurt
Cas doesn’t expect Dean to want to know more so when Dean says “Then what happened?”, he’s surprised enough to face him and try to check his expression but it’s hard to see Dean’s face in the dark so Cas just decides to continue, “A year later, we graduated and moved in together in an apartment. Few months after I joined the graduate school, she became pregnant though it wasn’t planned. It was quite a shock. Meg told me it’s okay if I decided to move out. She was from a rich family so she could definitely be a single mother without any financial problem. But at that point in my life, I was someone who wanted to prove to myself that I could handle everything without falling apart, so I told her as long as she wanted I’d be there for her and the baby. Even told her that I’d give them my surname in case her family had any objections about having a baby out of wedlock because they are kinda conservative people.” Cas can still remember how a sliver of hope and expectation glinted in Meg’s black eyes after he’d told her about his decision.
In the last week of November, Cas is at the grocery store to buy things he’s gonna need to make thanksgiving dinner. Only four days are left and he doesn’t wanna leave last-minute shopping after Claire’s school break starts. Claire and he are invited to the thanksgiving dinner at Gabriel’s place this year. Last year was Michael’s turn and next year will be his. Cas decided to make two casseroles- one vegan for Michael and one non-vegan for the rest of the family.
The next day passes by in a flash. Before Cas knows it, he is already in the kitchen, making sizzling chicken with onions, red bell peppers, and sauce alongside some steamed rice, a Greek salad, and chickpeas with gravy Indian style the way he likes it and hopes Dean likes it too. He set up the table, leaving the food in the kitchen for now. Claire lands on the last step of the stairs with a massive thump, wearing her denim dungaree with a white long-sleeved shirt under it. Claire’s long hair was tied up into a ponytail with a rainbow color scrunchie. Cas fixed his own black sweater over his beige color pants.
Dean widens his eyes, shaking his head out of Cas’s peripheral vision mouthing Charlie to “shut up” but Charlie’s grin just widens like a maniac meanwhile Benny frowns, eyes jumping back and forth between Dean and Charlie
“You know,” Claire begins, “I never knew my mommy. And the kids in my school sometimes bully me for not having two parents. But I think you’re like a dad to me. So it’s like I have two dads.”
“Judgemental much?” Dean gets up from the stool and starts pacing around, pressing the side of his head with one hand, should it be able to lessen the nauseating dizziness in the head.
“Hey Cas,” Sam says smiling cautiously, glancing back at Dean, as if he’s gonna have a breakdown just by looking at the man in the suit. He might actually, who knows?
Claire smiles at the endearment, “I was wondering, for my birthday party, I want to invite some of my classmates…” Claire trails off, sounding nervous. Cas looks over at her for a moment and nods, “Of course.”
“Okay... I’ll order something for you,” Cas says and takes out his phone to order some food for Dean, who’s now leaning back on the couch and rubbing the bridge of his nose with his fingers.
“Yeah, I- uh- I wasn’t sure if it was still your favorite but anyways, how are you?” Dean starts. Dean mentally pats his own back for choosing one of the tables near the window since watching the world outside through the glass window brings him a different sense of calm in him.
“Huh... so why don’t you just ask him?” Charlie suggests. It sounds so simple and straightforward coming from her lips so Dean does just that without thinking too little too much. Castiel immediately replies with a plain old
Cas inhales loudly but doesn’t get the chance to speak since Dean doesn’t let him. He continues, “I loved you, Cas. I trusted you. I felt. Back then, when you left me, I thought it was because I wasn’t enough. Because you realized how messed up my life was. All these years, I thought it was my fault you left.”
Their first weekend rolled in. Claire wakes up a few hours after Cas, running down the stairs excitedly. Cas is in the kitchen, preparing breakfast- waffles with chocolate syrup and organic honey- aka Claire and Castiel’s favorite breakfast. Cas wishes her a good morning, picking up his daughter in his arms and giving her the warmest hug before twirling her around until she screams with laughter. After having breakfast, Cas promises they would work on their garden together as soon as Claire finishes her homework.
The 136 fire department gets a call about an office building on fire where Dean has to rescue someone extremely familiar...
Navy blue three-piece suit with a crisp white shirt and a blue tie with tiny white flowers imprinted on it, along with shiny brown leather shoes. Cas looks at himself in the full-length mirror in his closet. He’s ready for the charity gala, except for his hair. His stubborn messy hair. Huffing he runs hands over his head, brushing the locks with his fingers. It now looks somewhat better and neat. He puts cologne on the side of his neck and runs his hands over the suit, feeling the smoothness of the fabric. The previous day he took Claire shopping for the gala, who insisted him to wear a matching color outfit with her. And that’s how he ended up with this custom made suit.
When it hits 7:30 PM on the big grandfather clock at one corner of the bar, the patrons of the establishment clear a space and build a makeshift karaoke stage. Mics are brought out and the speakers are taken out.
Claire nods, trying to understand. She sees some of her school friends in the corner laughing over something and she sprints away to find them, leaving Dean alone with Cas… again.
A toothy smile flashes across Charlie’s face, which makes her dimples on the cheek visible, “Oh my god!! He cares about you! That’s so
HEYYYY!!! How are y'all? We are... NOT FINE since we saw the trailer. The amount of time we spent crying isn't funny anymore... We just hope everyone gets the ending they deserve *fingers crossed*
Cas becomes still and his heart screams at him for telling Dean about Meg. He’s sure Dean means well but he doesn’t want him to. He's already making Cas want to reach him and take his hands into his and spend the night just being with each other...just like they used to when they were younger. However, he’s not someone who Dean should be with anymore. Dean needs someone who can be with him without any past incidents or someone with a small child and a dead wife. And he can’t be what Dean wants him to be.
“I was just- nevermind.” His husband interrupted, “Here you go. Exercise done.” With a clap on his good shoulder, Den stepped away as he turned around. Castiel rolled his shoulders and tested the water. The pain was a dull throbbing now. No difficulty during movement. He could easily go back to work. But… but knowing his brother, it’d be a problem since Michael hated whenever someone disobeyed him.
“For coming to Claire’s party. And the gift. She was really happy.” Cas remembers the smile on Claire’s face when she was standing with Dean and Sam.
“Mr. Novak, this is Graham Kell, one of the organization owners to receive the donation tonight. He wanted to introduce himself to you.” Lauren states with a small curve of her lips.
In the mediocre lighting of the bar, Cas still manages to look devastatingly handsome. The baby pink dress shirt on him is making him look a bit tanner than usual and the five o’clock on his face is giving off the rugged vibes. Essentially he looks too good for Dean’s heart and sanity.
“Okay. That’s it. I ain’t turning this conversation into a chick flick moment.” Dean knows Sam will try to talk about his feelings at every chance he will so he’s gonna try to delay
Cas fixes his fake beard, feeling it scratch against his chin. He grimaces. The next Halloween, he will try to convince Claire to spare him. He can feel the sweat running down his back under the heavy costume, in spite of the place being air-conditioned. He feels his phone vibrate against his thigh, inside the hidden pocket of the pants. Cas takes it out and checks the screen. One voice message from the Functional Manager. Cas deliberates whether to check it out or not. He promised himself he wouldn’t even touch anything related to work on this day because it’s Claire’s day. However, this might be important. He’s still thinking when someone taps him on the shoulder. He looks to his side to see Charlie standing with hands behind her back. She is smiling cheerfully, teeth shining.
He feels the phone vibrate inside his pocket and takes it out with one hand while the other is gripping the steering wheel.
When they separate, Dean looks at Charlie, “Claire, this is my best friend, Charlie. Charlie, this is Claire, the strongest Novak.”
breaks them apart. Dean is pressed against the wall which means he can’t exactly move unless Cas moves away, but right now, he’s gone still as a statue which means Dean has to stay where he is, looking at the intruder- who turns out to be, of all people,
The week passes slowly for Cas. He spends most of his time in bed. To pass time, he ordered a few novels online. But reading for a long time gives him a headache. So he chose to watch documentaries about nature which made him long to go out without worrying about his injuries. When Dean comes to visit him one day, he whines about not able to pass time. Dean just snorts in response and the next thing he knows, they are playing Scrambles. Not just Scrambles, they play monopoly and Uno too. Apparently, Dean knows how Cas can get whiny so he already put the board games in his car before visiting Cas. For hours they play and bicker and enjoy each other’s company, none of them bringing out the fact that they still haven’t talked about the kiss or their argument.
ago is a childish thing, however, it’s his damned heart which doesn’t seem to get the memo. It speeds up, thundering inside his ribs so loudly, Cas is afraid Sam, who’s sitting next to him, might hear it. He feels slightly nauseous. Maybe it’s the beer he’s sipping with an empty stomach or it’s just seeing Lee’s stupid- annoyingly handsome- face. He pretends to stare out the window he’s sitting next to. The world outside is dark and the streetlights glow orange, casting tall shadows as people go about their destinations. It’s November so the wind is chilly tonight. Cas wonders when the snow will start to fall. Maybe next week. Cas is so deep in his thoughts that he almost jumps out of his seat when Sam yells out, “Dean! Over here!” while waving his hand above his head as if he’s not a 6”4 tall who can be seen over the heads of the people in the bar.
Even so, Dean notices how Cas keeps fidgeting with his legs anxiously, and doesn’t even properly look at him, looking away every time he tries to catch his eyes. However, he chooses not to say anything. He doesn’t want to do or say something which might change Cas’s mind about them… whatever it is now. He
Right now, Lee is trying to talk to him about something like ‘pros and cons of drinking apple juice with alcohol’, Dean isn’t paying much attention to them since his eyes and mind are devoted only to monitor- subtly so that no one would find him too much creepy- what Cas is doing: animatedly talking with his friend since he’s not completely sober anymore after drinking three glasses of beer. Charlie is arguing with Sam about the merits of being a non-vegetarian instead of being a vegetarian.
Dean nods, wanting to have whatever Cas is willing to give, even if it’s just a friendship for the sake of his little daughter, “I agree... And anyway, Claire is definitely my favorite Novak.”
HI! Here's the next chapter ( after a long time so SORRY). We hope y'all aren't too angry at us for being late.
“You have no idea, she really does love to dress up.” Cas smiles a little bit but doesn’t look convinced.
It’s his fault they went inside that death trap. Dean should have known better. He fucked up and now Benny... Benny who always made Dean laugh and always has his back... died. He fucking
“I’m not- it’s just-” Dean stammers, “I don’t want to hear about Balthazar.” It sounds douchey but it’s the truth. Apparently, Cas didn’t expect that reply since his face turns stoic and he stands straighter.
“Winchester!” Donna yells into the radio and the building shakes again. Dean hears a loud bang somewhere in the distance, and Benny grabs Dean pulling him along and out of danger. They don’t turn around as they tumble down the hallway, inching closer to the screams of the young girl.
“Balthazar is telling us how they got drunk one day and got propositioned by a stripper,” Lee answers Dean as he flops down beside him.
“Bonjour Cassie, how’s it hanging?” Balthazar replies cheerfully. Cas almost rolls his eyes at the french greeting. Trust Balthazar to not let go of his french side even though it's been
The past week changed something. Shifted something between them. They talked to each other more, expressed more emotions near each other. Friendly was the word that popped into Dean’s mind. They were friendly with each other. It made Dean’s chest fill with something akin to warmth.
But Dean holds his ground, “All these years and you still don’t trust me, huh? After all these years, after trying my damn best to make it up to you. After saving you countless amounts of times, after looking out for you, for
“I have no freaking idea what you guys are talking about but I agree with Michael. You need rest. I’ll make sure you have it.” Dean smiled at the way Castiel rolled his eyes at his words.
“I’ll go to my office to see if there’s something to take home,” Castiel murmured and walked out of the room.
Cas watches as the camera shows a few familiar faces from the 136 team. The captain- Donna, his mind recalls-  is yelling “LFD! Make room” at the crowd of the bystanders gathered near the burning building while ushering the fire team into the building. Cas sees Dean on TV, in full protective gear, rushing into the fire along with two other firemen. Cas feels his heart race at the thought of Dean putting himself in danger yet again.
“Now, that’s not how we treat our classmates. Apologise or I will report to your teacher,” Charlie informs sternly.
“Hello yourself, Han Solo.” Dean rolls his eyes before huffing out a laugh. Cas stops beside his daughter, fixing his helmet and looking ridiculous, but in a good way.
me, you little sneak. You got takeaway?” Cas demands but his voice isn’t firm and strict and Dean immediately knows he’s pulling his leg.
A tap on his shoulder pulls him down to earth. He twists his head and looks up at the person. Lauren Ashby, the organizer of the charity, is standing with a man with a black tux on. Castiel stands up and nods at them with a smile.
The living room and the kitchen are empty which means Cas is likely to be in his room and Claire is probably playing with Mr. Black.
Castiel finishes his meeting early in the morning and returns to his office to finish some pending paperwork. He hates the long hours he has to spend poring over paperwork, yet it’s essential to keep the company up and running. After an hour of working his brain hard into the documents spread in front of him, Cas leans back into his chair and closes his aching eyes. He rubs them with his thumbs and sighs. Deciding to take a break, he shuffles his feet into the break room where the TV is on despite the room being empty since everyone on the floor is getting lunch in the cafeteria. A news reporter is talking away on the screen as Cas brews himself a cup of coffee. Once the coffee is ready, he turns to the TV, and watches as ‘BREAKING NEWS’ in big and bold red color appears on the screen.
“I hope you don’t mind me crashing your party, lads. I’m Balthazar, an old friend of Cassie,” Balthazar quickly introduces himself, holding out a hand.
“I left her at Kelly’s place. Don’t worry about that now,” Cas says, running his fingers across Dean’s back, feeling the tensed muscles hidden by the T-shirt underneath his skin. Dean sighs, leaning into his touch.
“Wait, me? Heh, you know me- the trouble maker. Anyways, are you sticking around? Party’s just getting started,” Dean says, hands gesturing towards the crowd gradually forming inside the building.
Also, the lyrics added at the beginning of each chapter are chosen really carefully because they complement specific scenes so we recommend listening to the playlist we made while reading the story. :)
After a few moments of silence, Dean gazes at Claire, “Hey Claire, is it okay if I steal your dad for a second?”
“I...I’m so sorry,” Dean says, his voice a little rough and choked. Cas sighs inwardly, because it's not the first time he'd heard the s word, and doesn’t dare to look at Dean, afraid of what he might find on it.
“Nope. I am single pringle and ready to-” her voice was cut off by a special alert tone, set for fire emergencies only, echoing through her phone speaker, “Oh man, I literally
Dean doesn’t know how he got to the reception and did just as the nurse told him to do. He even paid every bit of Cas’s hospital fees hoping and praying that Cas would get the best treatment. Everything blurs past him but he clearly remembers dragging his feet as quickly as he can back to the hallway outside the ICU.
“- and he stuttered how he’s with a friend and that’s how, pretty lady and lads, how Cassie got offered a threesome with a stripper.” Balthazar ends his tale, with a slap on Cas’s shoulder which makes Dean grimace.
Claire rushes into the room, ignoring Cas’s order about not running inside the house. Claire wraps her arms around Dean’s lower torso, hugging him tightly. Dean wraps his arms around Claire, lowering his head to rest his chin on top of her head.
Castiel resisted the urge to roll his eyes. His husband loved to act like Castiel was a kid who didn’t follow the rules. Which wasn’t true.. Mostly. He just didn’t like being sick. Or relying on someone else. The last person he relied on died and left a void in him which always was present in his life as a black ominous cloud.
Cas bit his lips nervously, eyes darting between Dean and Claire, “Dean, I’m not well enough to look after a kitten
“Dumb impulsive my ass,” Dean grunts, still holding Cas’s wrist, “It didn’t seem dumb when you were trying to fucking eat me out, Cas.”
Cas begins to walk away when Dean abruptly says, “Oh, like how you ‘forgot’ about me? Or more like how you
“Okay, baby bro. I gotta go and check if my minions are doing a good job or not. Take care of your kid and don’t do something that I wouldn’t do.”
Dean’s eyes follow Castiel’s, a deep-rooted frown forming on his face tries to understand why Cas is looking so...there’s too much expression- a shock to surprise to confusion to happy- going on his face for Dean to understand, and they land on where, or rather
After lunch, Claire drags Dean some more rides and games until they finish all their tickets and the sun begins to drop into the horizon in the distance, painting an array of oranges and reds into the sky above them. Dean can tell that Claire is exhausted from their day out, so he drives them away from the carnival and into a quiet hill area to watch the sunset. They park the car a few meters away, Dean lays out a picnic mat on the grass and lays down. Claire quickly joins him, her enthusiastic energy finally lessening as she places her head on Dean’s chest, placing her hands around his arm.
Dean glances back up to see Charlie and Donna watching him. Charlie looks concerned while Donna is giving him an extremely confused look.
Blaming his sleep deprivation for it, Cas opens the chat with Gabe and sends a ‘fuck you’ to him and turns off the phone before closing his eyes, thinking about what Dean said earlier about them being friends again.
“If you consider him a friend, then I suppose it’s alright,” Cas sighs, giving his daughter a smile which probably looks like a grimace but Claire doesn’t seem to notice it as she grins, exposing her teeth and scoots backward a bit to get comfortable in her seat.
“I’m okay, papa bear,” Claire whispered, smiling softly while holding Cas's cheeks in her small hands, nevermind the prickly scruff on his face.
Donna shakes his hand, “Ah, don’t worry about it! It was all Dean, honestly. Dean’s one of our best, you know.”
They seemed okay when Dean and he were... together. Maybe he was too engrossed with his life to notice it. But now is probably too late to say anything to Dean.
Dean sighs, standing up and walking towards Cas till he closes the gap between them, “You don’t mind if I stick around some more, right? I can help manage things here until you’re fully recovered.” Dean’s voice softens, “It’s your call. But you know, Claire already loves him.” Dean turns around to see Claire giggling as she plays with the kitten who keeps meowing while pawing at Claire's outstretched hand. Cas follows him and looks at his daughter being all smiley and happy with her new pet.
“I’ll try but she’s a fierce one, Cas,” Dean smirks, watching Claire frown as she tries to clean up after herself.
“What? Oh...um I’m okay. Just trying to find a comfortable position,” Castiel said, looking away as Dean proceeded to wipe off sweat from his face and neck as he walked to the closet. A few seconds later, he reappeared with clothes in his hands.
since he’d kissed Cas and yet, it makes him feel like he’s drowning in the sunshine just like he used to before. High Schooler Cas was slender and lithe but adult Cas is all sturdy and hard muscles and now Dean is already craving to be near him. To feel the same sparks that flew between them just like it had all those years ago when they first kissed in the living room of Dean’s childhood home.
Dean grins. “I didn’t know you knew how to dress up,” he teases, the mischievous smile on his face making Cas look away, unable to bear it, envious of the way Den is being able to act normal around people while he feels like tearing his own hair.
“I checked the email you sent me. About charity. Why should I get a plus one? Is it really necessary? I mean, the charity is for the public safety division, it’s not like anyone would notice why a businessman is there all alone.” Cas asks.
Cas’s phone rings, startling him, just as he crosses a T-intersection. He puts one of his Airpods in his left ear and answers the call.
Claire’s eyes sparkle, “Really? My dad bought it for me last year!” Claire says, smiling down at her purple glittery jacket.
“We match,” Cas blurts out a few moments later. Dean looks down at his own suit and laughs out loud. Sure enough, Dean is also wearing the exact color suit Cas is wearing. The only difference is Dean’s outfit is missing the vest and his shirt is light blue with the tie a darker shade with tiny white dots.
“Then it’s decided. I’ll email you all the details today,” Michael said, leaving no room for questions.
They stare in unison at the mess in front of them. All the other cars have come to a halt. There is one car, windshield shattered, with a massive long metal rod sticking into the passenger. Donna snaps them back into attention and they hurry to check the situation.
“Also, I saw Lee going around. Did he leave already?” Charlie asks. Charlie first met Lee when Dean had taken her to one of his shindigs a few years ago and they hit it off pretty well.
Inwardly sighing, he sits on a white satin cover clad chair and pulls Claire, who’s fussing with her headband, close. Dean sits beside him after grabbing a glass of champagne from the passing waiter. Cas recalls how it felt to hug Dean. Cas misses Dean’s familiar scent. The scent of home. And the moment he let himself get wrapped in Dean’s arm, his soul rejoiced. It felt surreal despite the warning his brain started to yell at him like a fire alarm. He tunes out the noise around him, concentrating on getting rid of the jitteriness he’s suddenly feeling. He almost undoes his tie but for the sake of appearance, he stops his hands.
“And I’m Donna. Now, Claire, why don’t you stay with me while we check up on your dad?” Donna asks sweetly to which Claire nods after hesitating for a few seconds, clinging onto Donna as she takes her to a distance. Dean stares back at Cas who’s now got his eyes closed.
“As I already said before, accept the deal or we can find-” Cas pauses, a mix of annoyed and determined look adorning his face, “I’m not an amateur businessman, Mr. Sinclair. I know the stakes.” Another pause. “I’m giving you 24 hours to decide. Don’t forget this is more important to your company than mine. I’ll see you at the meeting tomorrow.” Huffing loudly, Cas pulls the AirPods off from his ears and places them in black leather covered AirPod case carefully. He looks up to Dean with an embarrassed look unaware of the fact that Dean got a bit sweaty watching Cas being all bossy.
"Tell me, Castiel. When I touched your face after you recovered from Rowena's rabid dog spell-" Dean raises his hand to caress Cas's face, "- did you think I think of you as a brother? When I made you watch movies with me, sitting close to all night-" He slipped his hands into Cas's hands, feeling him getting still at his touch, "- did you think I do it with my brother?"
“That’s mine!” A kid in a Thor costume yells as he grabs the Spiderman toy from another boy. Cas pulls Claire away from the two boys before she gets caught in the crossfire, as Dean quickly moves to the boys, separating them. Charlie rushes forward, grabbing one boy by the shoulders firmly while Dean holds onto the other one.
. The girl is somehow still conscious, but just about. The metal rod has pierced her left shoulder, luckily avoiding any vital organs. Donna peaks a worried look.
Lee chokes into his beer as the words spill out of Balthazar while Castiel inhales loudly, sitting straight. Sam and Charlie turn away, but Dean holds his ground.
Cas makes a sound, something in between a groan and a gasp, and replies with just “Okay, hang in there. I’m coming.” Then he ends the call.
Dean winces at the sound of Benny’s deep loud voice buzzing in his right ear as the dizziness hits him again, “Jesus Benny, keep it down.” Benny just laughs, letting go. Dean walks over to the locker, taking off his sunglasses very slowly, and removing his jacket. He changes into his uniform- a navy colored T-shirt with LFD imprinted in red color on the left side of the chest, and pants in matching color- and goes to find his team, who are definitely upstairs, given the loud noises of laughter and chattering coming from there. Charlie and Garth are arguing about which outfit Sarah should wear for her date while Benny just chugs down his drink, standing near the fridge. Dean slumps down on the stool, leaning over the counter as Donna prepares lunch.
Dean licked his dry lips and turned to the task in his hand. Literally. Folding the black shirt he’s in his hands, he put it on top of the pile of clothes he’d been keeping to fill his luggage.
Dean huffs, “Oh come on, I’m not that bad, am I?” He stops himself, quickly realizing that the answer to that question is a very bold yes because after all,
“I did not ‘almost cry’, thank you very much,” Cas poutingly interjects, using his hand, which is holding his half-filled beer glass, to air quote. Dean did
After the ride, Claire drags Dean into a water gun shooting game. The aim is to knock down as many cans as possible with the water gun and win a toy. Dean notices Claire eyeing the massive fluffy maroon teddy bear and thinks,
Dean chuckles a little, walking to the door to leave while Cas flops down on the chair behind the desk, “Text me if you have more questions. I’ll see ya around, Cas.”
HI! I am back with another chapter. It's kinda short but important because it's where the main plot starts. Also, my apologies for the delay but I have a legit reason. I've been busy applying to colleges and preparing for my tests so I didn't have much time this month. Hopefully, the next updates will be not too fashionably late. Enjoy this one and let me know how you feel about it in the comments and kudos are appreciated as usual.
Sam manages to drag Dean out of bed, and into the washroom to make him look a little more alive. Dean’s in sweatpants, a black t-shirt with messy bed hair, and dark bags under his eyes looks too pronounced. After freshening up a bit, he goes to the kitchen and sits at the countertop while Sam serves him breakfast.
“Well, I didn’t at least get drunk while others were present to witness it.” Dean retorts. He doesn’t know why, but at the moment, he can’t resist the urge to provoke Cas. Sure enough, Cas’s nose flares. He looks intimidating and manages to look down his nose at him even though he’s two inches shorter than Dean. The air between them feels charged with…
“We both are fine. Claire started school today; she’s really excited and she actually loves her new room although it’ll take her some time to get used to the new surroundings.”
“Awww, that’s so cute. Cassie getting detention deliberately just because Dean wanted him to hold his hand during the horrific detention,” Balthazar coles, bumping his shoulder with Cas’s which makes Cas shove him away, laughing. Thanks to the British dude, their moment is over and Dean looks away, his heart beating fast in his ribcage while Cas says something to his friend in a voice too low for Dean to hear it Not that he has tried to. Nope.
“Yeah..like how there was a guy who ruined you back at high school and now you’re too emotionally fractured to step into another relationship again,” Charlie drones on, “Wait, why are you bringing up that topic
“Tell Cas that you aren’t ‘going back to Lee’” Sam says, using air-quotes, “Tell him that you and Lee are friends as you have always been and that Cas is different. He always has been.”
“You’re insufferable, Dean Winchester,” Cas says. Dean sees Claire stomping down the stairs in her little slippers so he bids Cas goodnight and hands over the phone to Claire who’s now standing beside him. Even though Dean knows Cas will be back soon, he can’t help missing him a little too much.
to be a professional and help the others to safely rescue Cas because otherwise, he’ll never be able to look at himself in the mirror. Resisting the urge to pull Cas into his arms, Dean mumbles, “I’ll be professional.” Then he pulls out a knife from the rescue kit to cut the seatbelt. Then he lets Charlie and Garth put a neck brace around Cas’s neck, almost yelling at them when Cas’s head tilts to the side a little bit. Charlie seems to understand since she winces a bit and murmurs a sorry, to whom- Cas or Dean?- he doesn’t know.
Cas bits his lips again, tonguing the cracks on his chapped bottom lip, “Uh- Yeah. Sorry, I didn’t mean to disturb you-”
Dean grins cheekily, “Well, your dad isn’t here now, is he? And hey, if your dad gets mad, I’ll cover for you.”
“Uh yes actually. Had an interview last Monday and yesterday they told me I can join after Thanksgiving break.”
, his mind not so helpfully provides- and he definitely has no intention to open up that can of worms.
One afternoon, Castiel arrives at home, unlocking the front door and sees a small card peeking from under the door. Claire, who hops along behind Cas, pulls it out and squeals. Cas almost drops his keys.
Dean doesn’t give up, his feet moving faster than his mind, “Sam invited you, right?” He rushes to stand in front of Cas, blocking his path. Cas stops, glancing down. Dean watches the way his fists clench, but then Cas just exhales loudly and nods, “Yes.”
of a phone vibrating startles both of them enough to make them jerk and look at the source of the sound. Dean’s phone which is laying on the couch between them is vibrating, indicating someone is calling. Sure enough, Sam’s name with his picture in the background is displayed on the screen.
Dean spends the next day sulking. Once he realized Cas wasn’t going to respond to his string of messages or calls, he stopped. Charlie swings her arms over Dean’s shoulder, smiling sympathetically.
Dean laughs, “That’s my girl! Proud of you, sweetheart. As a treat, what do you want for dinner? We can get take out.”
Dean quietly ponders on this for a second and then goes, “Okay here’s a crazy idea. What if I look after Claire while you’re gone? She can stay in my loft, I’ll take her to school and pick her up on time. She can even join me to the station when I’m free.”
Deans stops himself before his drunken mind can jump to any awful conclusion. Nevertheless, Dean’s unable to rip his eyes away when the singing begins. Cas has never been much of a singer (unlike Dean) but his voice is still velvet soft and sweet like honey, gently strumming on Dean’s heartstrings. Balthazar grins as the music picks up the pace, grabbing Cas’s hand, drunkenly. He twists Cas around, laughing. Cas, tipsy and unfocused, almost trips. Almost. Dean places a foot on the ground, ready to rush to his aid when he realizes Balthazar draping his hand around Cas’s waist.
“Yeah, saved him from a burning building and then saved his daughter a few days later,” Dean replies.
Claire giggles from her seat, munching down on her taco and attacking it so furiously that its contents spill out.
“Dean? Is that you?” He calls out, getting up from the bed. His minor wounds have mostly healed, and his head doesn’t throb every time he stands up. He slowly makes his way down the stairs, hands gripping the rail steadily until he miscalculates the last step.
“Sorry,” Both boys say in unison, bowing their heads but not before glaring at Claire who glares back with much more intensity.
Within minutes, Cas is shuffled inside the ICU. The moment Dean has to let go of Cas’s hand, he starts to shake. Through the small window on the door, Dean can see how the doctor and the nurses are cutting Cas's clothes and doing other medical procedures but he cannot bear watching Cas getting ready to be operated on. Trying to take deep breaths to avoid having a panic attack, he slumps down on one of the plastic chairs kept in the hallway outside the room they took Cas inside.
“That for someone special?” Cas asks. Dean’s heart flutters at the way Cas’s voice hints a bit of curiosity and hesitation as he speaks.
Hi guys! Here's a shiny brand new chapter. It got fluff and of course ANGST. So enjoy it and don't forget to leave kudos and comments if you like what you read. Also thanks for the bookmarks and any other interactions with our story. <3
isn’t Dean’s. Claire is his daughter only. Dean just played the part of a babysitter as his... friend.
Dean nods, “We are having fun but we miss you though. Are you coming home soon?” Dean freezes when he realizes he mentioned ‘home’ again.
Dean inwardly frowned, not knowing what Michael was talking about. Castiel seemed to understand what his brother was implying so he just shook his head and leaned against the backrest of the chair, “No.”
“Dean, the fire on your side is getting out of control, you need to leave now!” Donna yells from the radio.
Dean looks back at Cas and frowns, “Wait, you brought your daughter to this event? Is it even age-appropriate?” Dean whips his head around, glancing back at Claire.
After coming home, he’d shrugged off his uniform. Then, not bothering to shower, he sat at the edge of his bed, just in his black boxer briefs, and stared at the ceiling for who knows how long.
“It’s okay. I’ll...I’ll do something.” Sam’s voice breaks Dean out of his thoughts. He nods mutely and starts pacing back and forth, with his hands on his hips while Sam walks away with his phone in his hand.
Balthazar blinks once. Twice. Before he starts laughing so hard, he almost slips down the couch. Cas glares at him with scrunched eyebrows and
October means the little Novak’s birthday is inching closer. Anticipation and excitement build inside Claire as she discusses her birthday plans with her newfound friends at school. When Cas goes to bring Claire home from school one Tuesday, he notices his little girl is buzzing with exhilaration as she tucks in her seatbelt.
Rolling his eyes at his brother’s question, Dean replies with a short ‘omw’ and throws the phone at the passenger seat.
Cas is brought back from his thoughts when he feels his phone vibrate inside his pocket as he slumps in his comfortable bed, halfway through undoing his shirt.
Charlie sighs, “Fine. I won’t interfere. But lord help me, do something or I will lock you both in a closet together.” Dean narrows his eyes at her, trying to look threatening but he well knows how it’s ineffective on Charlie.
not okay. They set out the table and pass the food around, eating, and making small conversation. Claire is very excited to tell Dean about her English project about this book they are reading in class now. Dean listens intently, nodding, and asking questions about the book.
Cas thinks about what to say. How to say it. There’s a lot of things he can say. But it’s easier said than done. He can only hope he doesn’t mess up by saying something which might hurt Dean. He can only hope Dean understands him and doesn’t break his heart… again.
, Castiel thinks as he searches for his six years old daughter, Claire. Walking up the wooden stairs, Cas calls out for his daughter, “Claire? Where are you? Claire?”
of the several machines attached to his body is one of the things he hears. Second is the sound of his own breathing, harsh and rough, underneath the oxygen mask covering half of his face. His eyes move under the eyelids as he starts to feel the pain coursing through his body. He groans as he tries to move but fails eventually. Castiel opens his eyes and immediately regrets as the lights, which seem too bright, assaults his eyesight. He shuts his eyes tight, wondering why there's no one with him right now. However, as he closes his eyes, he recalls the fire. Scenes flash before him like a high-definition television screen- the immensely overwhelming heat burning into his skin and the smoke filling his lungs; Dean pulling him into his chest and covering him from the smoke, Dean begging Cas to keep fighting while looking at him with his beautiful green eyes- and forcefully Cas opens his eyes again, wincing at the brightness of the room as he struggles to sit upright. A nurse hurries in with a clipboard and some papers.
“I’m doing well… too well sometimes. How’s that adorable daughter of yours? Doing good?” Balthazar asks. Cas shifts on the bed and sits properly with legs stretched in front of him, socks still on his feet.
“Huh… you were asleep?” Dean had probably meant it to be a statement but it came out as a question, making Castiel raise an eyebrow. The other man’s face flushed red and he straightened up from where he was leaning forward.
But Dean’s attention isn’t on him right now. His eyes are fixated on the huge portrait behind Cas. Green eyes, freckles, flannel, and all the other things which belong to him. The man in the portrait is a replica of him- or more like a painted version of him. A painted version of him when he was eighteen and Cas was still in his life. Dean’s head spins, questions building up in his mind. He steps inside the room and towards Cas- and the portrait.
“Ah yes, I remember you. Hello, Claire, I’m Dean,” Dean grins back, shaking hands with the little girl, “I love your jacket by the way.”
Heyyy guys! First of all, 100 KUDOS! YAY! Thanks a lot, guys it means so much to us. We hope you keep liking our story.
“Barthemelow Baker. Can’t say I’m surprised to see you here. After all, publicity is what you thrive for.” Cas knows the man hates when someone calls him by his full name so watching him grimace brings a little satisfaction.
Worrying about someone doesn't always mean something...or does it? And how many times can a heart break till it's too much?
“Hey, Cas. I’m fantastic since I got to spend time with a very awesome kid, right Claire?” Dean winked at Claire who nodded smiling as a response.
“Yeah. I- I fucked up, again, and I think he’s pissed but he won’t call or text me back so I just- I don’t know,” Dean says through gritted teeth. He knows he shouldn’t be this angry, but he desperately wants to explain everything to Cas and that is hard to do since Cas has gone MIA.
“It’s alright. I’m- I’m glad you’re okay.” He clears his throat, feeling a bit uncomfortable under his collar.
Castiel rolled his eyes, “Only heart and there’s no ‘almost broken shoulder category in medical. There’s-”
Dean rolls his eyes and takes a step closer to Cas, "It means that if you thought you could just leave me in the world and go away, then you are
“Not a prick. Just a lad who doesn’t wanna get laid even when people keep throwing themselves at you… I wonder why.” Dean’s doubt about if Balthazar knows about him and Cas clears the moment he notices him giving him a meaningful look. Dean looks down at the drink on his hand, not sure whether to be happy that he isn’t the only one who’s not getting it up or to be worried about what this could mean.
you” with a cute hand-drawn animated hippopotamus sleeping on a sofa. Cas can’t help but smile. Claire opens the card which reads “Hi little Novak princess. I miss you. I hope you’re doing good in school. Your favorite firefighter, Dean.” Claire laughs as she reads the message written in Dean’s handwriting.
Dean glances up, acting innocent, “What? I rescued this little baby this morning. He needs a new home, Cas. Thought Miss Clare would love him. And, by the way, she has been complaining about how you wouldn’t give her a pet.” Dean shrugs. Suddenly, Cas feels a little bad because it’s true Claire wants a pet since she’s all alone most of the time and she can’t always go to the Klines.
The little Novak's birthday finally arrives however it is also a day of a lot of mixed emotions for Cas which might lead Dean to knows little about what happened during all the years they were apart.
“I remember,” Cas mutters. But that’s not all he remembers. He remembers how Dean slow danced with him in the moonlight somewhat ten years ago. He remembers Dean’s gentle touches and kisses. And how his eyes shone with happiness and excitement. He remembers Dean pulling them into the backseat of the Impala. He remembers everything, every touch, every caress, every whisper of forever, every declaration of love against his skin.
Charlie snorts, “It’s not unnatural. It’s just the people who choose to ignore the road warnings and drive like they own the damn road. Especially those big ass vehicles.”
“Dean.” Not a question. A statement in a whisper because his chest feels warm all of a sudden and it’s not due to the toxic smoke he’s inhaling.
“So, who’s your plus one?” Dean questions, the curiosity about knowing who Cas chose as his plus one overtaking his thoughts.
Dean inhaled, his shirt straining against the muscles of his light blue shirt underneath the black suit jacket. For some reason, Castiel's eyes caught the movement and it almost made him look away.
“Awesome,” Sam says under his breath, his eyes are shining as he moves the candle closer to his nose to smell the fragrance. It smells like petrichor: the smell of earth after rain, one of Sam’s favorite smells as it calms him down. Dean knows it only because Sam once told him how much he loves the smell.
“Claire and the kids in her class got invited to a children party for Halloween...at the fire station.”
Dean stares at Benny outraged, “There’s a little girl stuck in there! I don’t give a shit if it’s dangerous, I’m going in.”
Dean notices that Cas closed his eyes as if to take it all in, probably thinking it’s something Dean can’t see. “You smell like roses,” Cas says abruptly. This causes Dean to laugh, his entire chest shaking as he does. Cas looks up with a small grin, the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes getting pronounced a little bit.
“It’s okay Claire bear but don’t do that again, okay?” Claire nods but Cas clearly knows she’s gonna do that again in future.
Inside the washroom, he stands in front of the mirror, and, turning on the tap, he gathers cold water onto his palm and throws it on his face, feeling its chillness against his warm skin. Blinking back the water droplets from his lashes, Dean turns around, not caring to know how he looks since it doesn’t matter anyway. He returns to the booth and almost stumbles over as soon as his eyes fall on Cas.
“How do I look, dad?” Claire asks, grinning, bouncing on her tiptoes, feet clad in dark blue ballet flats with big bows on top.
He has Cas’s blood from all the handling he did while coming to the hospital and he didn’t even realize. Dean almost stumbles on his way to the washroom.
Cas bites his lips, looking a bit uncomfortable, “Sort of… he’s one of Michael’s friends, a superior if you will. He’s a bit of a dick, to be honest.” Dean nods along, now understanding why Cas was so tense early.
Dean climbs up the stairs once more, now yelling, “Hey!! Is anyone there?” He rummages through the thick layer of smoke and fire, pushing away broken and burning slabs of walls in the hallway- or what used to be a hallway.
“So Balthazar, you don’t look like someone who would be friends with someone like Castiel,” Lee says, taking a sip of his beer, “I mean, don’t get me wrong but he has always been a bit of an introvert and quiet while you seem like you love being around crowds.” Dean watches as Cas’s jaws tighten at Lee’s words, which, in Dean’s opinion, aren’t too good. Dean knows how much Cas struggled with his people skills and Lee, of all people, reminding him about it is a shitty thing. He licks his lips with nervousness and holds his breath, bracing himself for Cas’s response.
“You’re the one who said bad things about my mom!” Claire fires back. Dean has to put a handout and stop her before she plunges into the boys again.
The news reporter reports about two firefighters remaining in the building. He sees a shot of Donna looking incredibly distressed. It takes a few painful minutes before he sees Dean sprint out of the building with a small girl and the building collapses behind him. He waits for the other firefighter to follow suit but he doesn't. So when Dean falls to his knees, Cas falls on the couch. He understands what he's witnessing through the screen of the TV.
“What?” Dean blurts out as soon as he hears the word ‘threesome’ as if it’s the most cursed word in history.
Balthazar LeBlanc. Cas’s only friend. He is a photographer and lives in England. Cas met him when Balthazar was hired to take photographs at one of the events of the company a year after Claire was born. At first, Balthazar tried to hit on him but when Cas didn’t show any interest, he went from flirty to friendly. After a few hangouts, they became close friends. However, Balthazar got an amazing job offer at a model agency in England and decided to pack everything up and move across the pond. Now Cas and he often call each other and stay updated with their individual lives. Claire calls him Uncle Balthy.
It’s almost midnight and Cas is tired. Extremely and awfully tired. But, laying down on his bed, while his daughter is sound asleep in her room, he can’t even fathom the thought of sleeping. He twists and turns around, trying to find a good position that might help him sleep but it’s a vain attempt. Cas sits up, the dark blue blanket pooling around his waist, revealing his bare torso to the cold air coming inside through the open window, making the white curtains flutter. Running a hand over his already messy hair, Cas gets up from the bed, swinging his legs off the bed and sinking his feet onto the soft woolen rug on the floor, and walks to the closet. The walk-in closet is filled with his clothes, all coordinated in color with a long mirror attached to the wall between the suit section and pant section. Cas takes a few steps towards a small table in a corner and spins the circular lock of the metal locker, sitting on the table, and opens it. Inside it, lays a small box and a picture. He takes out them both and stares at the picture while he opens the box. In the picture, a short blonde girl is standing with her arms wrapped around a tall boy’s waist with one of his arms around her shoulder. She is smiling a mischievous grin while the boy is sporting a half-smile. They are both wearing black graduation gowns with matching color caps. Cas glances at the ring- an ebony color ring with a big, white sparkling diamond placed on it- laying on the box.
“How you doin’, brotha?” Benny asks in his usual cajun accent, patting Dean’s shoulder when he stops at the candy table. He’s dressed up as a pirate, a black sleeveless vest over a full sleeve white shirt tucked into a black tight pants and a black eye patch over his left eye and a dark brown battered sailor cap on top of his head. “Here’s the final bowl of candies. Just make sure the kids don’t finish it all or we’ll never hear the end of it from Captain. Not to mention the wrath of the parents.” Benny puts down the big bowl on the table carefully.
Dean pulls out his phone again, reading the texts Cas had sent him before. He inhales deeply, fingers shaking a little as he types:
“Uh… I wanted to ask you something.” Cas rubs the back of his neck, walking to the window, shut closed behind the white curtains beside which the empty canvases and easels are shoved in the corner while the ones with colorful art are kept on a long table.
Dean chuckles despite his shit mood. After a moment of silence to clear his mind, Dean speaks, “How’s the job hunting going? Found any decent jobs yet? I know a few salons. They give the employees a discount for haircuts… you know, for your moose mane.”
Remembering that Cas asked him a question, Dean replies, “And it’s okay. And I don’t mind a tiny bit of cold. Thanks for the offer though.”
The song blasts from the loudspeakers placed somewhere in a corner, making Dean look at him with wide eyes, “Do you recognize the song? This is our song,” Dean whispers,  swaying slowly, pulling Cas with him. The song playing is a cover of As Long As You Love Me by the Backstreet Boys.
Cas doesn’t know why or how his mind decides to do it but somehow when he opens up his mouth to speak, he finds himself saying, “It was also her mother’s death anniversary” He hears a loud inhale and looks over to Dean to find him staring at him with so much emotion, he faces downwards, staring at the glowing end of the cig as ashes fall on the ground, not wanting to get drowned by Dean's eyes. When Dean doesn’t say anything, he continues, “Meg- her name was Meg- had an uncomplicated pregnancy, everything was going fine, and we thought it would be okay but the moment after Claire was put in my arms after her birth, Meg went into a shock, due to blood pressure dropping, and the doctors tried everything they could or that's what they said. But nothing was successful. It...it was one of the hardest days of my life. On one hand, I was holding my newborn child, and on the other hand, I lost her mother.”
Balthazar keeps talking about some swinging couple hitting on him but Cas half listens to him while his mind drifts to Dean and how the last few days have been too
“Next? What happened next was Castiel, being the sexy grumpy man that he is, he refused with a single “no” and since I know when to take a no for an answer-” Castiel snorts, “-I accepted it. So instead, I convinced him to get a drink with me just as friends and not as ‘fuck buddies’.”
“It’s from Dean!” Claire squeals again. She shows her father the card. It’s a cute handmade card that says “I hippopota-
He’s halfway through eating the taco Sam made for him when there’s a knock on the door. Getting up from his breakfast, Sam walks to the door and opens it to a shyly smiling Castiel in a black suit. Dean almost chokes on his taco.
"-and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak," Dean stops humming, squeezing Cas's waist. This is the indication from him to let Cas continue the singing, who rolls his eyes. Dean seems to enjoy poking fun at Cas's Enochian songs so he always tries to make Cas sing English songs too.
Cas's face turns a bit blank and a small downcast smile graces his chapped lips, "I know, Dean. I know you love me like a brother."
lost." Dean closes his eyes, feeling too much. When he opens them again, he finds tears rolling down Cas's eyes. The sight makes him feel like he's getting stabbed in his heart. Not hesitating even a little bit, he wraps his arms around Cas. He buries his nose in the crook of Cas's neck, smelling the familiar earthy and fresh smell which reminds him of rain and Cas.
“Claire is at the Klines. Jack wanted to show her some toys.” Cas says when he notices Dean’s eyes wandering around while sipping water. “Shall we go to my office?” Cas asks, fidgeting with his fingers. Shrugging, Dean follows Cas into the office. Cas feels the heat of his gaze at the back, which makes him gulp. Being shut in a room with Dean is like walking on a two-edged sword but seems like he’s turning into a sadist. When Cas turns around after shutting the door gently and looks at Dean, he feels that familiar heat rise in his body because Dean is staring at him with a look which is so borderline indecent, suddenly the room becomes five times warmer.
“You got a big heart, and you always try to save everyone but you’re human after all, my friend. You can’t save everyone. There’s always a price to pay for every single deed you do. And I didn't know Benny that well, but I'm sure he'd be happy knowing how you managed to save the little girl. He'd be proud of you."
“But why? We had a great time. C’mon, Cas. Why are you talking like this?” Dean takes a step towards Cas but then stops as he sees Cas taking a step backward.
“Good morning, Sam. I got you a small gift to say congratulations on the new job and apologies for Balthazar’s behavior last night.” He hands Sam the small package wrapped in blue wrapping paper. Dean bites into his taco harder than necessary at the name of the British accented dude.
he curses in his mind and quickly pulls out his aviator sunglasses from his jacket pocket and wears it to protect his eyes from the assault of the sharp light. Locking the doors of Baby, he struts towards the red and white building.
"No, you don't have to say anything, except 'I love you'," Dean whispers in Cas's ears, feeling arms band around his waist.
It’s only a few minutes later when the sirens go off and Charlie almost trips, rushing down the stairs. Donna informs them it’s a serious one, a major car accident. Charlie squirms as they all pile into the fire trucks, sirens blazing as they rush down the long stretches of road.
other than talk,” Balthazar wiggles his eyebrows at ‘anything’, which makes Cas glare at him, “I’ll fly back here just to kick your pretty arse. And do not forget to give your daughter my surprise gift.” Claire was sad when she heard Balthazar was leaving and made Balthazar promise her that he’d come back and stay longer. To make her happy, Balthazar made Cas stop on their way to the airport and bought a cute stuffed lion as a surprise gift for her.
“Alright, I’m gonna go in there. Take this rope and tie it to that pole to keep us stable. I’ll get the girl,” Benny says. Dean does as he is told, watching Benny enter the room. The building shakes again, and Benny stops. The floor is already tilted and Dean feels fully disorientated but he focuses on Benny. Benny reaches the girl who’s hiding behind a couch. She grabs Benny’s hand as he smiles and nods at her reassuringly.
“We took out the glass piece. It didn't cause too many problems except blood loss. But the injury to the head caused a brain hemorrhage which needs to be treated immediately. Otherwise, the patient may go into a coma.” The nurse watches Dean worriedly.
Turning around, he goes away and out of the house to find Sam so that he doesn’t have to stay there for a second longer.
“No.” Cas meets Dean’s eyes as he looks up. Eyes filled with unmasked pain and remorse and something else which reminds Dean of the day Cas had left him all those years ago, Cas gazes at him. When he doesn’t say anything, Cas straightens up.
Cas crosses the road with one hand holding his phone while the other is stuffed inside his pant pocket.
“Did she know about us? Like, you know, us bei-” Cas interrupts Dean before he can finish the sentence.
Hello guys!! So... this is the chapter where shit hits the fan both in past and present so we recommend y'all to brace yourself for the breaking of those two dumbasses' hearts... ENJOY!!
Dean nods once, rushing to grab the large jaws that looked like massive crocodile clips, to be honest. They use the Jaws of Life to break open both doors. Sarah informs the man he is stable and relatively unharmed. But the girl…
Dean nods and hopes Donna would take it as a thank you. He hurries inside the hospital with the nurses pulling the stretcher while Cas lays on it motionless.
The hospital staff is about to rush Cas inside the hospital but one of them notices Dean hasn’t let go of Cas, “Sir, we got him. Your job is done here.”
“Really? That’s great. We should go and introduce ourselves then. But first, finish your lunch.” Cas says before continuing his own food.
“Okay, now let’s get going. I bet you’re already too tired.” Dean said, bending a bit to pick up Cas’s bag. Nodding, Cas walked beside Dean with his daughter still wrapped around him like a koala though he wouldn’t have it any other way. During those moments, Cas let himself pretend everything was okay and they were a family… a happy family of two guys and their adorable daughter. Sometimes it was just easier to go with the flow rather than fighting and swimming against the tide.
Cas stares at the screen as the ‘DELIVERED’ appears under the text. After thinking for a moment, he sends another one.
Dean assumes and shrugs it off. Dean runs a hand through his hair nervously, “Um- we went to the same high school. Do you paint too?” He quickly changes the conversation back to her. He doesn’t know how much Claire knows about him-
Dean spends the first proportion of his day going on a few intense calls with his 136 team- a massive python strangling its keeper, a man getting stuck in a garbage compactor, and a car crash just near the edge of town. Dean tries his best to keep his mind busy since it’s just easier that way to not think about what his heart is trying to tell him.
Anyways, we got busy in our daily lives and needed s bit of time to make progress with this story but don't worry because things 'might' be looking good. Enjoy this painful chapter and cry because we did while writing it. Kudos and comments are always appreciated.
“Here’s to a fun night,” Dean says like a complete dumbass. Cas smiles weakly, saying cheers and gulps down his drink. His eyes scan the room- the fire station in this case.
For that, Cas has an answer but he doesn’t feel like saying it so he just huffs in reply. Instead, he chooses to ignore it.
“What do you think, biscuit?” Cas asks smiling, leaning against the door frame admiring their work. “I love it!” Claire dances around, eyes glistening with excitement.
“Just returned yesterday and the trip was good. By the way, I heard you’ve been getting into trouble just like the good ol’ days,” Lee pulls Dean away from his stupor.
“I’ll always be one,” Castiel sniffed which turned into a wince as his muscles underneath the navy blue t-shirt tensed at the dull pain on his shoulder joint
What Dean does next surprises all of them. Dean shakes Lee’s hand away gently, standing up abruptly, and looks at Cas with a serious expression.
"Says you who is singing an old song about being in heaven while he's in heaven," Cas sasses, turning to open the oven and check on the apple pie he's baking.
Watching Cas sitting among his people made Dean's soul sing and his heart soar. He never thought he'd get to see this scene. But it's happening and Dean wants to tell Cas so. He wants to tell him how happy he is to see Cas with him. In his life. He gets up from the chair and is about to speak to Cas when Charlie arrives. He teases Charlie about her outfit and is about to turn to talk to Cas when he notices him staring in the direction of the door.
A soft smile appears on Cas’s face, making Dean’s mind go to places he doesn’t want. Cas juts his chin in one direction a little left to them, “Her.”
“Dean!” She jumps off her chair, rushing towards Dean who bends down to Claire’s height. As the little girl wraps her arms around Dean, Cas snatches his phone off his daughter’s hand, saying a quick thank you to Gabriel and hanging up, knowing very well his brother has already heard Claire calling Dean’s name out- Cas decides he would deal with Gabe’s wrath later about this. Dean slowly rubs Claire’s back before wrapping her small body with his arms, hugging her tight.
The Novak household is already packed with little kids sprinting around throwing water balloons and water guns at each other. The house and garden are covered with beautiful bright decorations- ribbons and balloons everywhere. The last time Dean came here, he didn’t get time to pay attention to the looks of the house. So this time he takes a moment and takes in the trimmed bushes of the lawn and the clean looking porch, along with the light color of the exterior of the house. Sam grins as he bumps into another kid who stares up at him like he’s a massive giant and quickly runs away.
“No. But as far as I know, you had a night shift and as always around this time you turn on the silent mode of your phone and sleep like it’s your job. So, what happened?”
November rolls around unexpectedly fast when one is busy filing stacks of documents and doing ridiculous amounts of paperwork. Every day Castiel returns home, drained and completely exhausted, but he plasters on an encouraging smile for his daughter. Claire is thriving at school. A few days have passed since Halloween and her friends still talk about her incredible costume. Claire is not that popular kid, but everyone knows and respects her. She’s fierce and tough but compassionate and helpful towards everyone. The teachers adore her too, making Cass’s heart swell with pride.
Dean climbs up the stairs and is about to walk to Cas’s bedroom when his eyes fall on the door on his right side. It’s the door that usually stays locked as per Claire. “Dad doesn’t let anyone go inside,” she informed him once.
“Oh my God. That’s not done, Castiel. We have to change it. Pronto. Well, not pronto, but soon. You have to go to parties otherwise you’ll miss all the fun us big kids have. Tell you what, the next time I get a party invitation, I’ll drag you with me, deal?”
Running a hand across his head, he heads towards the front door only to see Balthazar already opening it. Maybe his friend is one damn good mind reader or Cas’s poker face isn’t as good as he thinks it to be because, without a word, Balthazar hugs him with one arm and pulls him through the door.
“Relax, bro. What are you worried about? Meeting Dean or Claire being overwhelmed? It’s her first Halloween without us.”
2. I also made a Spotify playlist: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1XGF1jwkdjTy6SH3zlPwir?si=9rFFuHrnSYCasgAXsXWkDg
“I got the contract for a very important photoshoot for a campaign in Wales. It’s a really big deal since they don’t easily change their photographers.” Balthazar claims with an excited smile and furious hand gestures.
it happened, yet Cas had once fallen victim to Dean’s charms before as well. So who is he to judge? And Claire is right after all. Regardless of all the unresolved drama between Dean and him, Dean has always been kind to Claire. It wouldn't be fair to Claire if he too scorned by making dean not come to the party. After all, everything he does is just for his daughter.
“Oh my god, Dean,” Cas places a hand over his mouth, the reality of what just happened to smack him at full force. He can’t get out now since there are some important clients he has to meet so he leaves a string of texts asking Dean if he’s alright and informing that he’s there if he wanna talk.
"I love you too, Castiel." Dean's own voice is filled with joy and peace and everything which should be in his story. Because since Chuck got defeated, Dean has been planning for this moment. For this ending. for this happily ever after.
“But nothing, Castiel. Look, after what happened with Luke, I don't think I can trust anyone else other than you to be in charge of our second office.”
“You know, the hazard of having a crazy work time schedule. Sometimes I sleep like it’s my job and sometimes I become a freaking night owl.”
Novak this time around.” Cas sighs as if all his instincts are telling him not to trust Dean again. “Thank you,” Cas mutters. The song ends, and before Cas can pull away, Dean shoots his shot. He already has Cas within arm’s reach, he can’t mess it up again. So, he leans in and pulls Cas into a tight hug, draping his arms around the man. He can feel Cas getting stiff under his arms but he doesn’t let go. “I’m so sorry for everything.”
Charlie looks at him and gives him a soft smile which he returns with a nod. She doesn’t know how Cas feels about Lee. In fact, Dean himself doesn’t know the extent of what Cas feels about Lee.
Cas sighs as if he’s realising he is being too harsh again, “Dean, wait.” Dean stops but doesn’t turn around, not wanting to look at Cas in case this is the last time he'd be near him again, “I didn’t mean for that to come out so harsh and cold. I hope... we can be friends.”
“Claire thought it’d be 'cool' to put glitter on her plate to match it with the party theme.” Cas answers his unasked question, using air quotes for ‘cool’. Dean can’t help but snicker, “Well, that explains why your hand looks like a unicorn vomited on it.”
Cas coughs nervously, “Of course, um, this is Charlie you’ve already met, she’s friends and works with Dean. This is Sam, Dean’s brother,” Cas pauses, his eyes meeting Dean’s for a split second before he abruptly pulls away, “This is Dean. And that is... Lee, Dean’s friend.” Dean internally winces at the way Cas almost chokes at Lee’s name whereas everyone else seems to be unaware of it.
Dean sighs and sits down on the couch which is placed against the wall. He can still feel Cas’s lips on his and the taste of him on his mouth. It’s been
After a while, Dean notices how pristine Cas’s house is. There’s no mess nor any dust on anything. He wonders how Cas keeps it neat with his work and Claire’s needs. “A cleaner comes every Friday and does the work,” Cas says which makes Dean snap his face to look at him. Cas is staring at him with a brittle smile. Dean’s ears turn red and heat crawls up to his throat, feeling awkward for ogling at his surroundings.
Dean thinks  just as he sees someone approaching him from the corner of his eyes as he tries to concentrate on the paperwork scattered in front of him on the table.
As they wait for the food to arrive, Cas and Dean sit side by side in complete and comfortable silence.
Dean is savoring his Tuesday morning coffee, sitting at the edge of his couch while hunching over the coffee table, trying to solve a crossword puzzle in the newspaper when his phone buzzes with a text. It’s Cas.
“I dunno...it would be better if I could bring Sam, ya know. That way I’d be able to stop myself from making a fool outta myself.”
“Yeah, I was looking at jobs all around and I think I might have found something good in Lawrence and I’ll be closer to you too. I miss your annoying stubborn ass,” Sam says.
“Dean. Charlie told me what happened. It’s gonna be alright. He's gonna be alright. Have faith,” Sam says in a soft voice. Dean glances at the door. He can see a little from where he’s standing. But that’s enough to see the doctor fumbling with Cas’s tubes. Sam takes a look at Cas and inhales loudly.
Dean is restless as he waits for Castiel. His right leg bounces up and down with his coffee in his hands. He has ordered a caramel latte for Cas, which he hopes is still his favorite even though it’s been a long time). Dean constantly checks his phone, feeling a lot anxious and nervous than he needs to be.
He’s been at the bar for fifteen minutes, talking with Sam about mundane things- Sam randomly mentions how Dean has graveyard shift at the station tonight which is why he arranged the meetup in the evening- when fucking
Dean sighs, “Alright, kiddo. Are you hungry?” Claire shakes her head, “Alright then,” Dean continues, “Come on. I don’t really have another room so you’ll be taking my bed.”
First of all, we are extremely SORRY about delaying it for a long time. We know it made y'all angry/sad but we couldn't help it. The finale made us both too sad and frustrated to even write about our beloved characters. We just hope y'all forgive us and enjoy the chapter.
Cas jumps out of his seat, almost stumbling over Sam as he tries to get out of the booth. Within seconds, Cas is free and rushes over to Balthazar, flinging his arms around him, he hugs his-
Dean clearly knows what Claire means by that. Cas losing his wife and having to take care of his daughter alone doesn’t sit well with Dean and something pulls from the inside him just by thinking about the fact that all these years he’s thought how Cas might have lived a great life when, in reality, he’d been busy with his little daughter.
Cas nods but he was more worried about Claire, “Do you know where’s my daughter? She was there at the site.”
A stream of endless thoughts crosses Castiel’s mind. What if Dean leaves again? How will he manage then? Does he have the heart and patience to manage everything?
Cas watches the news for the first time in a while. And his fingers hover over the button ready to switch to the next channel when he hears about a collapsing building. Every hair in his body stands upright, as he sees the familiar faces of the 136 team rush into the building. And Cas prays. The last time Cas prayed was right before his daughter was born. After losing Meg, Cas didn’t see the point in prayers if they weren’t going to be answered. But now he prays again, prays for Dean to be okay. Because ultimately, that's all he
“Yes. I’ll be there tomorrow morning to pick up Claire,” Cas replies, no visible sign that he noticed it, “Just make sure you keep her in one piece.”
“Listen, after thinking a lot about it, I finally came up with a solution for our office in Lawrence and I wanted your opinion about it before we meet the board of directors tomorrow .”
“So, I wanted to ask you about this Halloween event you guys are holding. Claire and I usually celebrate it with my family. Only family and friends were usually present so I don’t want her to feel overwhelmed or anything if there's gonna be too many people,” Cas says, leaning on the big desk in the middle of the room, files and papers sitting on its surface in some neat stacks, and crossing his arms across his chest, which makes him look more enticing than he already is.
A vibrating sound of a phone broke the moment and Dean jumped back, swallowing. With a couple of long strides, he reached his phone which was sitting at the foot of the bed.
“A piece of the glass shard has cut through his shirt and punctured his skin. That’s where this blood is coming from, along with the injury on the forehead. We need to get him to the hospital, stat,” Charlie says calmly but sternly.
Michael chuckled, “I know how Castiel is when he becomes a patient. I’m his brother, after all. Anyways, Castiel, you definitely rest. Especially some mental rest. The past few days have been a bit overloaded...even for you.”
He peeks through the window and sees the doctor injecting something on the vein on one of Cas’s arms. He’s been stripped to nothing above the waist, with light blue pajamas covering his lower body, and a thick white bandage is pasted on his chest. The blood has been all cleared up, though the skin is still slightly pink. His head is wrapped in a white bandage with an oxygen mask on his face. A small white clamp is on one of his fingers and Dean peeks at the heart rate monitor to see the green line it’s showing is wavering a bit by bit every passing moment. He feels his feet getting numb with fear. He cannot think of the future where he doesn’t have to live in the future where Cas is… Dean’s breath hitches even at the thought. He stands at the door, witnessing how Cas is struggling with his life. Dean rubs a hand across his neck and notices it’s a bit red.
Cas stays silent for some minutes. He knows Balthazar is right but he’s afraid. So fucking afraid. The last time he’d opened his heart to Dean, he ended up with a broken heart and an emptiness in his soul. If- if this time, history repeats itself, he won’t be able to bear it. Yet his heart is saying his friend is right. They should talk. He should tell Dean everything. Everything that happened in the past and everything he’s feeling regarding Dean.
Dean stares at the man, using all his strength not to let his emotions get the better of him, “Yes sir. We will save her, I promise. You just look after yourself okay?”
territory. The cans are placed far apart from each other and the other kids were struggling to nail them. Dean steps forward, placing his ticket down for a try. He grabs the water gun confidently, aiming and shooting down five cans in the span of five seconds. The entire crowd falls into silence, but Dean is on a roll. He knows he has a few more shots until the water runs out of the gun, so he takes down ten more cans in record time. He hears Claire gasp beside him and he finally looks up, a little dazed.
Dean has one hell of a day. His team goes on a call about a man about to jump off a bridge. Donna approaches the man carefully, trying to talk him down from the bridge. But the team isn't idle. They blew up one of those large plastic landing pads right below the bridge, stopping cars on the road and causing a shit ton of traffic to save this one life. Dean watches anxious as his captain desperately tries to reach out to the man. Charlie rubs her hand on Dean’s back gently, as she stands by his side. Even the passersby on the road become invested in this mission. Everyone watches nervously as the man slowly backs away and falls into Donna’s arms crying and weeping. Dean finally exhales, heart still pounding in his chest.
Dean’s face falls, “Yeah, okay, I get it. I’m sorry. I wanted tonight to be fun and enjoyable. I’m sorry I brought this all on you again. I’ll- I’ll get going now.”
Anyway, here's the next chapter. Here we get to see why Dean and Cas chose to get married to each other.
HEY GUYS!! We are back with a brand new and long chapter. This chapter got both happiness and sadness Hope you guys like it :) Don't forget to tell us if you like it or not in the comments. We love to read about how you're reacting to our story.
“It looks beautiful, princess,” Dean says smiling. He watches as Claire shows her father the pendant Dean gave her. His heart wants to stare at Cas and take in all the changes that happened to Cas over the years. Yet, his mind tries to make him look at everywhere but Cas. It’s a tug of war between his heart and mind and unsurprisingly, his heart wins. Dean stares at Cas who’s now fussing over his daughter’s dress. He’s wearing a blue and white flannel with folded sleeves, showing off his tanned forearms, over a black KISS T-shirt with black jeans. His hair is messier than usual-
"But it got me here. To you." Dean replies and a small smile appears as Cas's head snaps back to face him.
The voices in Dean’s head pound so loud that all he can do is let them consume him. After going home, Dean showered, scrubbing his skin till it turned red under his fingers, wanting to remove all the evidence of the fucked up situation.
“You two okay?” Garth asks. There is a man, maybe in his late twenties wearing a plaid shirt with blood trickling down the side of his head. He nods weakly.
,” Cas mutters, not just for taking care of Claire but also for everything else. Dean squeezes Cas a little before finally letting go which tells Cas that he understood what Cas tried to convey. Cas leaves and Dean closes the door, feeling a weight crush his chest a little, before he turns to Claire with a smile.
“As if you were a saint,” Dean blurts out after a moment and immediately regrets it. Everyone in the booth turns their faces to look at him while he gulps and tries to smile but it feels like a grimace more than a smile.
Cas doesn't respond. He doesn't seem to even breathe. So Dean continues, "When you got stabbed by Lucifer, I mourned. I mounted like someone who lost his love. Who lost his everything. Who
reason, Claire seems to really like you. And I don’t want her to get hurt in our crossfires. So if I want her to stay happy like the way she is nowadays, I need
“Sam. Hey, you almost gave me a heart attack.” Cas says, smiling a bit. Despite his constant push and pull drama with Dean, Sam had always been kind and a good friend to him.
The clouds shift in the sky, making space for the moon to peek from behind them, bathing the place with its light.
Claire gets a party invitation however Cas feels anxious about sending his daughter to it. So he reaches out to an old friend to calm his nerves.
After the ambulance, which is transporting Cas to the hospital, leaves the site, Dean returns to the station, along with Charlie and Benny. Not in the mood to talk to anyone, he immerses himself in the paperwork in a corner of the second floor. After some time, Donna, who went to the hospital to check up on the survivors, returns to the station and sits on a chair near Dean.
“By the way, I thought of something that would make sure Castiel gets the break he needs.” Michael’s words brought Dean out of his reverie.
Dean held his hand up to stop his brother, “Yeah, ok and we’re done. I’m good. I gotta get to work, Sam.”
starting to get in Cas’s good books after the crap I pulled earlier and I don’t want you to go and ruin that. So
Dean's heart beats wildly- it's ironic since he's only here because it has already stopped beating- as he approaches the man. Walking up to the man, Dean stops beside him and looks ahead. A breeze passes, making the leaves of the trees of the forest rustle.
One of the ladies grabs Dean’s hand, “My boss, he’s in there! Please help him!” Dean quickly glances over to Benny who immediately nods in return. Dean and Benny have that relationship where they could speak a thousand words with just one look which always comes in handy during distress calls like this.
Glancing at the phone, Dean sees Sam has texted him. He reads the preview of the message on the lock screen, keeping one eye on the road since he doesn’t have a death wish… yet.
“No, I- I forgot- he-'' Dean stutters, his brain still processing how Cas’s heart almost stopped beating forever. Once Cas had told him how it only beat for him. Then they ended. But now he’s back and Dean desperately wants him around him. He wants Cas to be in his life. Doesn’t matter what they are. Friends or lovers. He wants to take whatever he gets as long as Cas is around. So he prays. He prays in his mind. He prays with his heart, his soul. He pleads to Cas to get better.
“Very funny, Dean. Firstly, I don’t think my major in social work is acceptable in salons and secondly, my hair is fine, even good. Anyways, why did you call?”
“Woah-” Cas’s breath falters as he almost falls but Dean is right there, beside him, holding him upright.
wanted me to be there with you, remember?” Cas snarks, smirking. Dean’s throat gets dry and he nods like the dumbass he is.
But seeing his daughter smiling bright and laughing as she brings the kitten back into her arms, Cas can’t say no.
“I give you this ring as a symbol of my faithfulness. As I place it on your finger, I commit myself to you. I ask you to wear this ring as a reminder of the vows we have spoken today, our wedding day.” Dean spoke in a clear voice and he put the simple silver wedding ring on Castiel’s ring finger. His hands were steady and didn't sweat at all.
“First of all, stop screeching like a scandalized 50 years old woman. And yeah, I only met her a few days ago, she’s really lovely actually. Got Cas’s eyes too. It’s just… you know… Cas… it’s not like we are just some long lost friends reuniting after 12 years,” Dean struggles, trying to describe his thoughts. He doesn’t wanna mention how he’d given Cas his number like some clingy pathetic loser. And he definitely doesn’t wanna mention how he’d used
Soon, Claire is awake and done with her breakfast while Cas guzzles down hot black coffee without any sugar, hoping its bitterness makes the headache lower its power.
Charlie’s smile returns, brightening up her entire face, “I know you will, Cas. Come on, let me introduce you to some of our other friends!” Charlie drags Cas along, yanking his arm and hooking it into hers, as she passes a gaggle of children in various costumes.

Cas grumbles and says goodnight to his brother before ending the call. Feeling irritated at the way Gabriel told Michael about his stress smoking habit which he clearly has a problem with.
“Well, how about a drink to calm your nerves?” Dean grabs another champagne as a waiter passes by them, offering it to Cas who just mutters a small thank you and almost,
“I’m gonna miss you too, Claire bear.” Cas kisses Claire’s head and stands up. He moves to the door and looks back at Dean. “Uh...take care Dean. I’ll see you soon.”
“I- I couldn’t sleep so…” Cas feels stupid for waking up his brother because now he’ll probably think Cas is going through something, which might or might not be wrong. But it’s none of anyone’s business.
than friendly with you the other day at the bar,” Cas lowers his voice hoping his daughter doesn’t hear any of this.
“What? No. They are alive...well as far as Dean and I know.” Sam mumbles the last part with a frown.
“Yes, Claire bear?” Cas asks, smiling patiently at his daughter, knowing too well she’s gonna ask for something.
Dean nods, placing a hand on the frame of the doorway, “You too, man. And don’t worry, I got her. And please drive safe, Cas.”
“No? What do you mean?” Dean’s stomach churns as his mind thinks of anything that might have made Cas say that.
Dean had replied a few minutes after Cas sent that text. Now Cas is home, wrapping up work while Claire is at the Klines’ house. He still has some paperwork to finish which he brought home from the office. Neatly creating a small stack of papers he will need to get through before signing the current deal, Cas runs his chin, feeling a bit tired. He’s still in his work clothes, the white shirt tight against his muscular body except for his suit and tie which he removed after returning home because it is already way too hot and he knows he needs to get comfortable with Dean in the room. There’s a knock on his front door and Cas already knows who it is. Since the office is downstairs, it takes only a few moments for Cas to go to the front door. Nervously, Cas pushes the door handle down, opening the door slowly.
Dean’s grey t-shirt, which was tight enough to make the muscles beneath it pronounced, was stark against the black bedsheets he’d laid on the bed this morning. From Castiel’s position at the foot of the bed, he could only see the back of Dean’s head and his back. His hands were placed close to his body, probably tugged under his chin as usual.
The sirens go off as Donna starts yelling at everyone to get into the trucks immediately. They don’t need to be told twice. They go on a few calls, a few kids stuck in an elevator (one of Charlie’s greatest nightmares is being stuck in an elevator), a call about a fishing get-together gone wrong and a call about a bar fight that also went fucking wrong and a guy got a pool stick sticking out of his left shoulder.
“Sure. Thanks for the call.” Dean ends the call and stands up, burying the phone in the pocket of his uniform pants.
“- understand me? Dean’s like the big brother I never had so I won’t hesitate to do something not-so-legal to make him happy, capiche?” Charlie’s voice, her tone a bit serious, makes Cas look at her face. Instead of the cheerful smile, which Cas has come to associate with, a stern expression is adorning Charlie’s face. It might have made her look intimidating if she weren’t about half a foot shorter than him. Cas decides to keep it to himself and tells, “I know what you mean. I’ll try my best… to make sure Dean is okay around me.”
Ignoring Gabe’s weird nickname for him, Cas turns around and rests his hips against the window sill. “I know. I wanted to ask for your suggestion. What should I do now? Should I go with Claire? Or should I refuse her? This is so fucking frustrating.” Cas almost growls.
Cas halts in his tracks, turning around, “Yes, like how you showed your true colors in our final school year.”
Cas frowns, “Dean, I appreciate that but you really don’t have to. I’m sure I can find someone in two days…”
“No, I’m driving out tonight. Gotta pack before it gets too late. By the way, don’t forget to drive Claire to school tomorrow morning,” Cas reminds Dean before crouching in front of his daughter and hugging her tightly. Claire kisses his cheek and wraps her arms around his neck.
“OKAY,” Dean cuts in before Charlie finds a way to ruin his life even more, “How about you-” he grabs Charlie’s arm, “and I-” sends her a death glare, “go restock the candies and toys, eh? Be right back, Cas. Help yourself to whatever you want, and enjoy! You too Ben, enjoy yourself.” Dean smiles before dragging his best friend away from Cas and Benny, both looking bewildered.
Dean gives her a bitch face before tilting his head, thinking. Anything to get his mind off Cas. “What errand?”
Cas’s jaw clenches as he stares at the blonde man who comes closer and stands beside Mr.  Kell. Not wanting the two people standing with him to witness whatever that’s gonna happen, Cas excuses himself and stays silent as Lauren, and Mr. Kell walks away after shaking his hand respectively.
“Claire is back,” Cas says with a big smile as he rushes, albeit a bit slower than usual since he doesn’t want his head to explode with a headache, to the door.
“Surprise, Cassie,” Balthazar smirks, looking at Castiel with a big grin on his face and a glint in his eyes. Dean instantly feels wary of him. This dude got an accent which is somewhat a mix of French and British accent.
“Ya okay?” Dean asks him, looking up at his face with a concerned look, with his hands halfway on the air, as if he wants to touch him. Cas stares at him, realizing how the heavy feeling dissolved a little the moment he went to stand by Dean. His hands itch to take Dean’s hands and hold them close to his heart which keeps fluttering like the wings of a caged bird whenever he’s near Dean Winchester. Yet, he ignores it, nodding silently, hoping it will be convincing enough to keep Dean from questioning.
Michael’s voice sounds a little rough, probably because he’s already asleep before Cas’s call. Cas hears a muffled female voice, seems like Michael’s wife woke up too.
The next morning, the little Novak and Dean prepare breakfast together before school. Dean flips the omelet and Claire puts the bread in the toaster with Dean’s help, after that, Dean prepares the baked beans and bacon and orange juice for Claire. They have a good breakfast together before Claire has to go to school. Dean enjoys having Claire to himself. She’s smart, responsible, but she’s snarky, sassy and fun to be around. Dean notices more and more of Cas’s traits embedded into Claire’s personality but she is a wonderful person of her own.
“I’ll think about it, okay?” Claire begins to smile, her hopes clearly getting higher, but Cas interrupts quickly, “I’m not saying yes. Just that I will check it out. If it’s safe and okay for you, we can go.”

Cas rolls his eyes, shutting down his laptop and keeping it on the side table, before sliding down the bed and resting his head on his sleeping pillow. He pulls the cover over his body, feeling the soothing warmth of it.
Dean opens his mouth to speak but his mind fails him. Charlie hugs him, tight and warm. He shuts his eyes, but the moment he closes them, he envisions the cement coming down on Benny. The image suffocates him.
“You wanna have lunch? Afterward, you can help me with my room too,” Cas suggests. Claire agrees with a loud enthusiastic ‘yes’ and follows Cas downstairs.
While Claire takes a shower and gets ready for bed, Dean goes downstairs and grabs a snack from his fridge, a chocolate roll. Claire snuggles into her blankets as Dean wishes her a goodnight, turns off all the lights and goes to sleep in the massive couch he’s got downstairs. But only a few minutes later, he hears a very clear, “Dean? Can you come stay with me tonight?” from the bed upstairs in his loft.
"Then why yo didn't know that I love you too?" Dean almost yells, being done with everything. He is finally in heaven. Finally with Cas. There's nothing that can stop him from saying the things he wants to say. Doing things he wants to do.
“Dad, so you know my birthday’s coming up,” Claire says, at a slow pace as if she wants Cas not to miss a single word.
“Come on, we got work to do,” Donna says, abandoning her kitchen work, to Dean who’s already moving towards the stairs.
Cas stares at his phone. It’s probably not a bad idea to bring Sam. It might help to lessen the tension.
“I came to see my best friend, of course! And by best friend, I mean you,” Balthazar smiles, flickering the tip of Cas’s daughter’s nose, earning himself a sweet giggle. Cas ushers Claire away from Balthazar with a gentle, “You need to clean up first, princess. Wash up and then come down, I’m making you your favorite chocolate waffles.” Claire jumps up and down as her mouth salivates but she nods and sprints up the stairs, ignoring Castiel’s warning about how she’s not supposed to run up the stairs.
do this, Cas,” Dean pleads as his mind keeps replaying the ‘something stupid’ part. He knows they still have the connection they had back then.
Dean breaks the connection and looks away. His heart pounds inside his ribs, making his head feel hazy. Drinking several glasses of booze seems to finally affect his system. He slips off the stool and stands up, one hand gripping the lip of the bartop.
me. I wanna know what’s making your mood swing like a three-month-old pregnant woman. Just spill.” Charlie demands, narrowing her eyes. Her red hair is tightly spun into a high bun and the casual outfit- black jeans topped by a yellow sweatshirt- tells Dean she’s done with her paperwork and ready to go home.
“Well look at you! A little warrior princess, aren’t ya?” Dean grins, noticing Cas walking up to Claire in his incredulous Viking costume. Dean checks him out with raised eyebrows and laughs. “Hello there, Mr. Viking.”
Cas gets so relaxed that he doesn’t hear someone walking towards him until he hears a sound of throat clearing. Getting rigid with tension, Cas slowly faces the person, half-burned cigarette dangling from his mouth, as the smoke disappears into the air.
Cas sighs pulling out his phone from his jean pocket. He flips through the text messages until he finds a specific contact. His fingers hover over Dean’s texts and he tells himself he’s not nervous, but it’s a lie.
Dean's heart keeps thudding inside his chest because it’s like a dream come true. Him sitting with Cas while they drink coffee and talk about random things.
Cas seems to know how Dean is in turmoil as he glances at him with a hesitant look. Dean just turns away his head to look at anywhere other than the person sitting across him.
“Donna, this is Castiel. And of course, you’ve already met Claire, who is his most adorable little munchkin,” Dean says watching Claire giggling, “Cas, this is my captain, Donna.”
“Stop being all pessimistic. Did he tell you he regretted it? No. So, stop overthinking.” Sam chastises.
“So, Sam, are you visiting, or did you move here permanently?” Cas asks, standing up and brushing his hands over his thighs for non-existent dirt, Dean's eyes tracing them unconsciously.
After the night at the playground, Dean's mind couldn’t think straight. He couldn’t focus on his work no matter how hard he tried. He thought maybe if he knew about Cas’s past, that would help him move on or at least do
Claire’s birthday is in a week- on 10th October- and Cas has prepared almost everything already. He has bought adventure-themed decorations which include balloons, ribbons, and other festive things. He has bought plates, cups, spoons, and whatever else they might need. He has already called to order Claire’s cake- a big green and blue cake with miniature chocolate figurines of mermaids, pirates, lions, and other items- along with some finger food and meals from a restaurant but one thing still remains undone: giving an invitation to Dean.
Pressing lightly on the accelerator, Dean speeds up while staying at the speed limit. He doesn’t wanna be too late to the meetup, especially when Cas and Lee- he shudders at the thought of seeing them together at the same place- are already present there.
called him just to make sure he's alright. Even in the past, Cas was always the worrying one between both of them.
Cas thinks as Claire walks up to him and stands beside his desk. Instead of letting her stand, Cas picks her up, holding her under the arms, and settles her on top of the desk. He eyes a black paper on one of her hands but decides to hear what his daughter has to say first.
“Anyway, for what it’s worth, I like her too,” Charlie agrees before accelerating out of the school parking lot.
“I do,” Castiel answered, looking down at his hands which are currently held in his future husband’s hands. He felt warm just from the single physical connection between himself and the man who would become his better half within a few moments.
Feeling oddly pleased over the fact the compliment is coming from Dean, Cas smiles a bit, taking off the cigarette from his mouth to exhale the smoke through his teeth, watching as the smoke catches the air and somersaults away, and shakes the ash from the butt of it using a finger.
“How do you keep up with all that energy? Claire hasn’t changed a bit, holy shit,” Balthazar stares in awe.
After their show-and-explain session ends, their team goes around, individually speaking with the kids and getting to know them better. The kids are insanely curious about the rescues and calls the firefighters go on. At the end of the day, Dean kneels beside Claire, smiling brightly.
Cas wraps his arms around his daughter, grinning from ear to ear. He quickly meets Kelly’s eye, thanking her endlessly. Kelly leaves with a fond smile as Cas closes the door behind him.
“I’ve never seen so many kids in one place,” Dean leans towards his brother and hisses, eyeing the small children frolicking around.
“Brilliant,” Balthazar cuts him off, “So I gotta go now. Got some business to handle.” The way Balthazar said the word
“Sure thing, man,” Dean hugs his friend again and watches him leave as quickly as he came. He spins around trying to find those blue eyes but they’re already lost in the crowd.
Satisfied with the lack of blood, Dean turns off the tap. He looks back down at his hands, and for a split second, he envisions the blood again. Dean shakes his head, placing a barrier between him and his traumatizing thoughts, and is about to leave when his eyes fall on the mirror. He looks at his reflection. A face full of worry stares back at him. Tearing his eyes off from the mirror, Dean goes away from the washroom, letting the door slam behind him.
Cas immediately nods, “Of course. Whatever you need, I’m here. I can stay the night if you want me to.”
think about it. He refuses to think about it. He’s gonna be alright. He has to be. For Dean. For his little daughter who already has lost her mother.
“Hey guys,” Dean says in his deep voice, with a bright smile on his face. Cas tries to comprehend Dean’s expression but he comes up blank. There was a time when Cas could read Dean like an open book written just for him. But now- now he can only imagine what might be going on inside that pretty head of Dean.
“Dean, can you wait for a second? I got something to talk to you about.” Michale’s voice stopped the husbands on their way to the door.
“I’d brought you some snacks since you have a graveyard shift tonight too. But it’s not in good shape anymore I guess.” He peeled inside the bag and shook his head.
“Fine establishment where women and men  danced for the customers’ entertainment,” Balthazar ignores Cas’s interruption, “A stripper-”
“How did you meet?” Dean asks, his eyes fixed on Cas’s face. Cas shifts a bit, internally debating whether to tell Dean about everything or not. After a couple of heartbeats, he thinks
Claire nods, her small frame leaning further into Dean’s chest, “I know. But it still hurts. But I’m glad my dad has you. I’m glad
“You better go before she gets salsa sauce over her new friend,” Cas laughs through the phone. Dean quickly says goodbye and hangs up in time to help Claire with the mess.
“You’re right. I was just worried. Everything’s changing and I want to make sure she’s okay.” Cas sighs, looking away from him, biting his lips as he usually did in the past whenever he was troubled.
Cas smiles lightly, glancing down, “Thank you, Dean.” He says humbly. Dean catches Charlie’s eyes as she slides past the crowds of kids playing around with toys.
Sam blinks, a little lost, “What’s wrong with Rocky’s? The drinks are great and it’s your favorite-”
Sighing, he managed to close his eyes and relax a bit, shoving the painful memories away from his mind. The sound of a door opening and closing echoed through the room after a while but Castiel didn’t open his eyes, not wanting to move away from the dark beneath the lid of his eyes. He heard his husband walking around, the clink of metal, which was more likely to be the buckle of a belt, telling him Dean was getting dressed for work.
“Stop exaggerating. You certainly didn’t almost drag me away,” Cas chided, giving Dean a dirty look.
“How is he? Is it too serious?” Dean questions in a rush. When the nurse looks confusingly at him, he adds, “I’m his friend.”
“Because,” Cas takes a deep breath, “because it’ll be high school all over again. We will become friends then you’ll do something stupid and I’ll have to face the consequences. I can’t tolerate that shit anymore.”
“In my opinion. You should talk to him. Tell him how you feel. Tell him why you don’t want to be with him. If the bloke is as good as you say he is, he will definitely understand. Not communicating with each other is hurting both of you. It’s not good, Cassie.”
Cas silently treads towards a swing set standing at a distance from the lights, almost invisible in the dark, the dead leaves on the ground rustling under his feet.
“Of course. So... you’re coming to the party, right?” Dean asks and immediately regrets it. Mentally rolling his eyes, Dean thinks how stupid the question is because of course, Cas would come. He won’t let his daughter go to an event all alone, not when he’s worried about her being all overwhelmed and shit. Cas coughs awkwardly, grabbing his attention, “I think the answer is obvious, Dean.”
Later that night, Kelly Kline comes by to check up on Cas, promising to look after Claire well. When Castiel asks how claire got to know about the fire, Kelly informs him how his daughter had seen the news and recognized the building since Cas had taken his daughter there to show where he'd be before dropping her off at the school.
- pressed in the core of his heart comes bubbling up as if they cannot be repressed anymore, they will not be anymore, "If you thought you- you would just say 'I love you Dean' and let the empty take you, and if you thought you would just say goodbye to me and get snatched outta existence, then you are outta your goddamn mind. And what did you think? What the fuck did you think? You would let that son of a bitch take you and I would accept it? I would live on and have a happy fucking life? Then you don't know me at all," Dean runs out of breath by the time he's finished talking. He takes deep breaths and realizes there are tears pooling in his eyes. He blinks, hoping they would go away.
“Car accident on the East US Highway 24/40, downtown Lawrence. The victim is still in the car. An ambulance is needed.” The 911 operator informs Charlie through the radio while Dean straps the seatbelt across his body. He’s at the back of the fire engine with Charlie while garth and Donna are at the front seats, with Donna behind the wheel.
It’s been four days since Cas’s return to Lawrence when the 136 team gets a call about a collapsing building. A bomb had gone off which caused the foundations of the building to tumble. The building is an eight-story office building. The moment Dean hears the news about the bomb, his heart almost stops as he wonders if Cas is in this building but then he remembers that Cas is on the other side of the city. The team rushes to the site, Donna asking them to proceed with caution as they’re not sure if this is a single attack or if there will be more. They suspect it’s a terrorist attack, no one knows who or why, but at that moment it doesn’t matter. People’s lives are at risk and need saving so that’s what they are going to do. They save lives. Dean, Benny, and Garth prepare and wear protective gear and check their radios. Charlie and Sarah first tend to the wounded on the ground, some women and men with a few cuts and banged up heads. The building is already extremely weak as it is. Half of it is in shambles, and the other half being held upright by pure dumb luck. The neighboring fire station, team 138, rush in to lend their hands too. Dean, Garth, and Benny enter the second half of the building that’s still standing, trying to get everyone out. Garth and a few others take the first few floors while Dean, Benny, and some from 138 try to climb to the higher floors. They hear a few screams for help, Benny rushing in to save them. They get almost everyone out safely. But Dean hears a young girl scream down the hallway, which is filled with debris and torn electrical wires which were sparkling perilously.
“Lemme do it, baby.” Cas moves the long, shiny blonde hair to a side and pulls the tiny zipper up, securing the hook at the top of the zipper. He rotates his daughter and looks at her. His little daughter looks so beautiful in the dress, his heart feels heavy with bubbling emotions. The dress is navy blue in color and ‘tea length’ with a ‘sweetheart’ neckline and white lace ‘sleeveless bodice’ which goes down to the waist, along with a satin dark blue belt wrapped around the waist. This was the exact description of the dress the staff at the dress shop told Cas when Claire chose it. Cas just nodded and pretended to understand what she meant by all the descriptions. He was too busy watching Claire squeal over the dress.
got Cas back, after years of going around in circles and overthinking every small thing, and he didn’t want to lose Cas a second time around.
