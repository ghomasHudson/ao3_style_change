bag.”  It took a minute, but soon enough, John’s fully-packed rucksack soared down the hall and landed at his feet. Breathe, breathe, just breathe.  John slung his bag over one shoulder, and hurried to push his way through the heavy front door, then into the dark and down the steps. It was chilly out and John thought briefly of returning for a cloak, but decided he couldn’t be arsed to go back now.  He jogged a bit down the main path, hardly daring to believe it was really true. Sherlock actually here, finally  . . . John cleared a turn, and spied a dark shape through the bars of the gate, waiting in a pool of light from the lamps.  He upped his pace to a flat out run.  The figure turned at the sound of his feet crunching on the gravel.
“Oh, it’s a get together. Here.” John tossed a sheet in Sherlock’s direction. “You could come if you were interested.”
“No, I don’t really need to go anywhere,” Victoire said. “I wanted to give it to you, John.” She stepped forward, pushing it into John’s hands.
Sherlock listened with half an ear as he tugged off his boots, watching the man across the room bouncing on the balls of his feet as friends wrapped his knuckles. The Bajoran was definitely agitated, hopped up. That was a weakness, one Sherlock could exploit.
“Bloody hell, I can never look at Victoire again.” Teddy groaned, burying his face in his hands. He was once more in full human form, but his hair had stayed an ashen grey.
He squeezed the beautiful cock gently as he introduced a second finger into his arse. When he crooked his fingers just so, the man shuddered, his back arching off the bed. John felt a flush of satisfaction roll over him. Oh, he was a lovely thing.
John sighed, and pushed himself off to try a solo trek to the loo. He was gratified to find that while his ankle was still sore, he could at least put weight on it. He took it easy, skipping morning classes, but biology needed to be kept up with, and with only a bit of undignified limping, he was off for lunch and afternoon lectures.
. I saw how you were looking at him.” The guard jerked his head toward the sitting room. “You can do your job and keep your eyes and hands to yourself, understand?”
John closed his eyes, letting the glorious sensations roll over him as that long hand moved along his length. He opened them briefly as the man raised up, positioned John where he wanted him, and sank down. Then he tried to remember how to breathe.
“John, I know this is sudden, and you’re free to say no, but I could use an assistant in my line of work. Your military and medical training could come in handy . . .” Sherlock trailed off at the odd look on John’s face. “What?”
“He’s fine.” A tight smile found its way to her mouth. “Well, I say fine, but he’s upset of course. He misses you, and he’s bored stuck at home.”
“Stop, stop.”  Dom draped one hand dramatically across his chest while the other waved his brother off. “Merlin’s beard, there are CHILDREN here.”
Behind him, Sherlock could hear the particular rhythm John’s breath made as he was about to climax. “If you’ll excuse me?” Sherlock nodded to Felicia, and gave Oscar a last pat as he moved back to John’s side.
John glanced across the pub to see the back of a head of dark curls, and a swirl of charcoal coat disappearing out the front door.
“I know you don’t want me to get hurt, but this is war. You know this, right? I can’t just sit back and let others take the heat. It’s for Bajor. It’s all for Bajor.”
“This dresser, and this wardrobe are mine.” John’s voice rose as he jerked a thumb toward the furniture on his side of the room. “Those are yours.” He tipped his chin to the others. “Got it?”
Before Sherlock’s higher brain could react, he let out a growl, deep and low from the back of his throat. The man’s eyes went round and he released Sherlock’s arm to take a step back. He moved quickly, but not quick enough to avoid being shoved against the wall. Sherlock caught the faintest whiff of Omega on the bodyguard at such close range.
He demonstrated by delicately removing the ball of wax from his mouth and dropping it into the nearby rubbish bin. John followed to lean over and spit his directly into the can. Sherlock tried not to be charmed by John’s every move, and failed.
“Oh dear, you’re all limbs, aren’t you? Here, Siger run and fetch some seltzer water and a napkin.” Mrs. Holmes dispatched her husband. “He was so clumsy when he first got his height.” She confided to John. “Always knocking things over, tripping over his own feet.”
“Isn’t it nice? We had it made on Cardassia and shipped in. Come, let me show you, there are lights and a vibration you can turn on.”
“Oh no. Come on, it’s not that bad,” John said, turning to survey the huge flat screen telly opposite the squashy sofa at the end of the bed. “Besides the bed’s even bigger than the one . . .”
“I don’t know. It can be a bit of a gilded cage,” Sherlock said, moving to the replicator. “Deka Tea, sweet,” he ordered.
“Well, that’s not very sporting of you, to plan on throwing darts at me and then balk at letting me throw them at you.”
“It’s true,” Sherlock jumped in, glancing at the Bajoran wait staff gliding around them. “There aren’t nearly enough orphanages around to deal with the numbers of abandoned children. With Bajoran families being broken up and shipped to work camps, there aren’t even nearby relatives to take them in.”
“Teddy, stop being mental, and eat your breakfast,” Tom said shoving him. “I think your blood sugar is dipping low.”
He got his wish as the prick pressed forward, sliding over his tongue, Over and over, it pushed in just a bit, only to retreat fully. Greedy, frustrated, Mycroft worked to trap the teasing thing, trying vainly to suck it down as amused laughter rained over his ears. If only, if only . . .
They found a ball by the side of the pool and set up a game of catch until Olivia wanted to do underwater handstands. John and Olivia were competing to see who could do the best job with Sherlock judging when the door opened and Sherlock’s father popped his head inside.
“Say you’ll come home with me.” Sherlock couldn’t keep the slight edge of desperation out of his voice.
John allowed himself a moment of pure masculine pleasure as he sank into the deep leather seat. He watched avidly as Sherlock revved the motor to life, and shifted the car into gear, twisting his long neck to look back as he reversed them onto the drive.  John gave him directions to Harry’s, and Sherlock looked for traffic before pulling out onto the main road.
“Oh, I didn’t think about that. Thank you.”  Sherlock turned back to face him, an indistinct shape in the dark.
Sherlock turned to see John hot on heels. “Hey hold up, a minute, you. Where are you rushing off to, my wee fishie?”
“Yes, sir, of course, sir.” Sherlock licked his lips, trying to stop himself from giving off any more nervous tells.
“Oh, Sherlock, there you are. I’m so glad I caught you.” Rose swept out of the lift, dragging a large magenta-coloured bag behind her. Her children followed, negotiating their own luggage.
John glanced back to make sure Sherlock had settled, pulling the covers over him before moving to unlock door.
Sherlock snorted in reply.  They rode in silence until the car pulled up close to where they’d started their journey.
It was all John could do to sit through the rest of dinner, listening as Harry complained about a customer at work, remembering to eat his dessert as he watched Sherlock nearly fellating his spoonfuls of cake and cream, wrapping his tongue around the base of the spoon to lick it clean.
“John.” Sherlock could hardly speak for the lump in his throat as he slid his free arm around the solid weight of him.
Mr. Jadzel glanced at the time, surprised. “Ah, so it is. Well, I mustn’t keep you from your sustenance. Growing boys need their food, eh? We’ll pick this up again tomorrow. You’ve made excellent progress, Sherlock.”
“Certainly not.” Sherlock snapped. “Molly, please.” Sherlock reached over to pat her hand to soften his outburst. “I appreciate the concern, but don’t worry about me. I’m fine.”
“Mummy, we’ll be late if we don’t leave soon.” A tall silhouette in the door blocked the light from the hall.
“Hmm… I’ve never seen a James Bond film, but I guess it wouldn’t hurt to try. Which one’s your favourite?”
"Give me the damnable envelope and let me open it," John says as he swipes it back from Sherlock. He unclasps it, turns it upside down. Two long, silky black cords fall out along with a note that simply reads: "Let's Pretend."
“Please. We like to form our own relationship with our older pediatric patients. I’d like to speak with Emma alone. It will only take a few minutes.” John smiled warmly at the woman. Eventually she caved, and gathered her bag to move to the waiting room.
Sherlock hummed as he seated himself before the cornucopia, accepting the drink that John passed him. He sniffed at it. “What is it?”
The side of Sherlock’s mouth crooked up sadly, and then they were back in each other’s arms, clutching for a final goodbye.
“It’s up to both of us. It’s okay to be a bit private if we want, but if I had my druthers, I’d be shouting it from the rooftops,” John said. “I’m damned chuffed you’ve agreed to be my boyfriend.”
“Nothing terrible. My mother says her allergies are acting up. She wants me to pop round a chemist and pick up some nasal spray.”
“Relax, John. It’s spelled." Sherlock shrugged as he replaced the phone. "The Muggles won’t see anything but an empty booth.”
John appeared in the doorway, his blazing face like the sun parting the clouds. People were on them, then, pulling them apart. Ragged breaths filled the air.
Finally, before mid-day, Sherlock reappeared, needing John to help him unlock the front door to go out and continue his measurements. John sighed, trailing after Sherlock with his hands in his pockets. Sherlock stalked quickly off with his notebook ready to record another day’s numbers.
Sherlock whipped out his reader to scan the chips in their uniforms watching as their names popped up on the screen. “Well, Private Boca, and Private Evek, I see nothing fun in deserting your post, and endangering the well being of a law-abiding citizen. This is shameful behaviour. I’ve a mind to report this to your commanding officer.”
John worked his way back up to Sherlock’s mouth losing himself in a sweet slide of lips and tongue. Hands were just getting into fun places when a burst of light exploded over their heads.
“What can I say, he’s a genius.” John tried to smile as he straightened back up with a bottle of shampoo in his hand, but the expression fell somewhat flat.
As the group nattered on with their idea on how the Bajorans could be better whipped into shape, Sherlock took the chance to slip away. He found Irene chatting with a couple near the fountain, and slotted in by her side.
“John.” Sherlock could barely make out his features in the gloom of the alley, but he could see well enough to rain grateful kisses over John’s forehead, cheeks and chin before finding his way back to his mouth again.
She returned to bring them a few things, water, blankets and some first aid items before leaving them for the night. “You have to be out by dawn.” She said. “That’s the best I can do.”
John stared out the window as the Hogsmeade station fell away behind them. The train to London was almost deserted, and they easily had a whole compartment to themselves. Sherlock knew he was meant to be feeling nostalgic about leaving Hogwarts for the last time, but he was far too excited at their upcoming plans.
“No, NO. It’s genetic.” John huffed miserably. “It runs on my mother’s side. Harry has it too, but her presentation is weaker. Generally people just want to buy her lots of drinks during her time of the month. With me, it’s a full on contact-high lust.”
John reached up to see if the nameplate would come away, and was surprised when it peeled away from the wall with hardly any effort.
His face was so open, and warm, his eyes such dark wells of blue, that Sherlock had to pull him close. “You’re welcome, John,” he breathed into his love’s hair as John’s arms wound around his waist.
Sorry for the hiatus between chapters here. Real life has been kicking my butt, and as those in both the U.S. and around the world know, the recent election was a blow to many of us. Still life goes on, and as we in the states are set to celebrate Thanksgiving this coming week, we can remember the good things. There are always things to be grateful for as long as we still draw breath, as long as we stand together.
"Yes, we can't all be paragons of taste." Mrs. Holmes sniffed. "I told Lily it was going to be too much."
“John, you might remember, Galen.” Sherlock gestured toward the smarmy creature. “Galen, this is  . . . John.”
John stomped off, feeling extremely wrong footed. He scanned the room looking for someone who might actually enjoy his presence, when he spotted a couple of blokes from the football team. They cheered loudly, beckoning John in as soon as they saw him. Someone pulled up a spare chair, and John sank into it with some relief. He couldn’t help glancing up later though to where Sherlock had been sitting, but the quixotic man had disappeared again.
“I already have someone special,” Sherlock said, reaching back to drag John closer, linking their hands. “I have John.”
They made it out to the Shrieking Castle at Irene’s suggestion, and John loved it. It seemed the bother of the morning blew away as they paid the fee, and climbed about the old building. They marveled at the collection of ghosts that either drifted out to give them a lecture about the architecture, or jumped out to scare the pants off of them. One little Witch screamed so much when a headless ghost burst out to bowl his head down a hallway, that the family had to carry her quickly outside, her cries a siren receding into the distance.
John felt himself utterly tongue tied as a wave of heat washed over him. Thankfully Sherlock was not so afflicted. A spot of color tinged his otherwise pale cheeks as he rounded on the man, but he launched into an immediate diatribe dissecting the git with a series of rapid fire deductions.
John seems to think so too; they find each other’s hands in the dim midnight blue and push, pull each other to the wall, John’s back pressed against it, Sherlock flush against him and bending down.
“Fair enough.” Julian looked disappointed but game. “Hope you won’t mind if I keep trying to get you to Oxford in some capacity or other, though.”
When he returns to 221B, John can’t tell if Sherlock observes everything about the awful experience on him but he feels the guilt, shame, anger and frustration of it hanging heavily on his soul.
To a certain degree John's upbringing (with his difficult childhood, and the conditioning from superiors once he was in the army) had prepared John for it, but in other ways nothing could have really prepare him for the unique torture that is Sherlock.
“It's not like you care,” Sherlock spits bitterly and he manages to yank his arm free from John's hold. He grips the mat, trying to maneuver into a position that will provide leverage enough to buck John off.
Then again, he had never been desired before - demanded, in fact. He'd felt completely off balance. However, that hadn't kept him from his natural instinct to be divisive.
He looked down to see his own cock filling out as a shiny black shoe slipped between his feet and kicked them further apart. Hands landed on his hips and yanked them backward and Sherlock had to scramble to catch himself, nearly smacking his face against the wall in an effort to brace himself. His torso was nearly parallel to the ground now. The man's hands moved to firmly grip his cheeks and it occurred to him, for the first time in his life, that he might - quite possibly - be very much in over his head. Then he was grateful for the position because it hid his expression of confusion, excitement and terror. It was the perfect position from which to hyperventilate.
However, as he lets the defeat settle into his bones, he realises it is worse yet. With that single barrier gone, John's subjugation is more complete than he ever anticipated. It was that -
“I'm -um…” John closes his mouth and tries to blink, but his eyes return to Sherlock, still wide and shining in the dim light. “I - uh - I didn't think you-”
“Give it up, you prick. I'm going to have a look and you can't stop me,” John growls as he pushes the sleeve up the last bit to expose the crook of Sherlock's elbow. Sherlock mashes his eyes closed and tries not to let those obscene words overwhelm him with fantasy. His hips are rocking now and the too rough and filthy fabric of the mat is building a steady wave of pleasure/pain that he feels helpless to stop.
especially in comparison to the heat of crackling tension and thrill of danger always present with Sherlock.
“No.” Clear and sharp, slicing through the stale air, straight into Sherlock's chest. John is still not looking at him. His hands are clenched now; perfectly deadly fists. Sherlock tries to focus. He starts again.
He tries to wrench his hand free and John's grip only tightens. The pressure and friction of John's strong, capable body wriggling on top of his own is only serving to grind Sherlock's hard length into the grimy mattress. It's maddening.
are you thinking?” His breath is warm on Sherlock’s face; tea and toothpaste. Suddenly nothing he wanted to say to John (none of those harsh, cutting words) have any meaning. Sherlock opens and closes his mouth like a fish cast out on shore.
As Sherlock comes back to himself he's aware of the stillness and silence. For a moment, Sherlock just lies there in his joyous defeat. He lets the buzz of chemicals float him above it all in that glorious euphoria.
... (humiliation? gratification?) at being an a object for this impressively ferocious man's pleasure and nothing more. He had ultimately decided it must be pleasure because his cock had grown harder still, bobbing obscenely between his legs.
So Sherlock sets about relentlessly chipping away at the one thing John takes efforts to make irreproachable from the start, his sexuality. A plan he sets in motion with a suggestive comment about his riding crop and a wink from the doorway as he leaves.
”Yeah, right. Yeah.” He nods but he is still gaping, eyes sparkling with something like awe and his mouth mostly hanging open. “I just-” He looks at the mat with that ridiculous stunned grin and Sherlock has the urge to punch him. It irritates Sherlock to no end that John seems to be thrilled by this discovery. “Um - was it the -” He moves towards Sherlock then stops himself, seeming like he is not quite sure what to do with himself. “It’s the fighting? You get off on it?”
John had hardly had a moments peace. It has been like the constant barrage of artillery, always threatening complete devestation. Sherlock has orchestrated moment after moment to challenge John's boundaries; invading his personal space, more frequent lingering touches, faffing about in nothing but silk pants and his robe, and casually fellating twenty cigarettes at once have been among some of the more overt acts.
“Mmm. That voice.” His hand slipped from Sherlock's chin to clasp Sherlock's throat, holding it while stroking up and down the length of the tendon there with his thumb. There was threat in it but there was threat in everything the man did, as if he naturally oozed the promise of violence and destruction. “£200.” His grin was positively terrifying. “And I'll take more than your mouth. I'll fuck that filthy little ass of yours and hear you scream.”
Sherlock had known the exact moment he was seen. It felt like the first time someone had really seen him in his whole life. He was sitting on an old mattress in the corner, peering up at the intruder from under wild, chemist store dyed blondish hair (an effort to avoid being found by Mycroft). His long arms were wrapped around his knees that were drawn up to his chest. He was 19, but had been told he looked much younger; all pale and scrawny limbs, and large eyes. He looked like what he was, dirty, strung out and alone - a runaway with no future, trying desperately to escape his past.
A thumb brushes over the bruises in the crook of Sherlock's elbow and stops, pressing in slightly. The flare of pain blazes across Sherlock's brain makes a low moan escape. He tenses at his own sound.
However, As much as he tries to enjoy the quiet countryside and Sarah's gentle, down-to-earth demeanor, part of him can't deny that all these slow walks and gazing at hillsides grates at his nerves.
Before him is not the kindly doctor but that rarely-glimpsed, exquisitely fierce beast usually locked under John's careful control.
”For Christ’s sake, John.” Sherlock sighs and rolls his eyes. He jumps to his feet, moving briskly. He snatches up an oversized coat he’d traded a man from his homeless network his nice suit jacket for. He sweeps it on and is practically lost within it - good. It hides the wet anyways. He moves towards a boarded up back door. “I have no idea what you are talking about.”
Yet, if Sherlock closes his eyes, it almost feels like John is insistently exploring his body, like a lover demanding to know all of his prize.
“No you’re not!” John's voice is full of knowing. There is no passing what just happened off as some case-related experiment or part of a performance. John knows the truth now.
Wave after wave of pleasure, made sharp with humiliation and fear, courses through Sherlock. He shudders and gasps, the too-close, stained mattress going gray then black.
This swift and efficient takedown is like a jolt of electricity through Sherlock's system, lighting up his brain with a perverse thrill at the struggle and defeat. This is what he wants. What he needs; this dangerous, raw truth of John Watson. Christ how Sherlock has craved this… and feared it (though he'd never admit to either of those things aloud).
He doesn't flatter himself. He is enough of a realist to recognise that, rather than any special attraction, it is in part the convenience of his proximity and in another part the difficulty of the pursuit that makes him the target of the mad genius who, to be honest, has lots of other options. The suave git can have just about anyone else he sets his mind on if it was just about sex. No, this is only about
“Stop, Sherlock.” John's lips are right by Sherlock's ear; commanding but calm, in spite of the desperate struggle. “Just fucking stop. You know what I can do to you.” John's arm tightens its hold on Sherlock's neck as John's hand tightens on his wrist.
“God, no. The FOOD Mum made for Christmas. You’d have thought the invading armies were coming. I’d be happy not to eat again until the new year. Unless you’d like to go out . . .” John straightened up, dusting off his knees.
“So I heard.” Kira pushed off from the doorway to stalk into the room proper. “Looks like you took quite a hit.”
“John.” Lestrade released him to lean back against the edge of his desk, crossing his arms. “About Sherlock . . . it isn’t really my place, but I wanted to let you know  . . . I see his brother, Mycroft from time to time.”
“Merlin’s beard! Did you even remember to put up wards before you started?” Mycroft cried, marching up to join them, his light summer robe flapping about his legs. “Honestly, Sherlock. Do you WANT John to end up at the bottom of the ocean?”
“I don’t mind telling you, you’re not at all like Sherlock’s usual picks. You’re just lovely, dear.” She reached out to pat his arm.
John watched, somewhat baffled as Sherlock flitted about the room digging through drawers, plucking things out to make a small pile on a desktop. John lifted the protractor, looking at the bit of string, a weight, a compass, and the ruler beneath. Sherlock gave a cry of delight, returning with a hammer and a box of nails he’d unearthed from somewhere to add to his collection.
“Later.” Sherlock promised, pressing a last peck to John’s cheek before swanning off in a swirl of his long robe. John sighed, and watched him until he turned a corner before heading off himself.
The sharp crack of the paddle over the arse cheek just squeezed caught John completely off-guard. He jerked in his bonds, crying out loudly without meaning to. A hand returned to cradle the sore spot, not moving, simply offering comfort with its presence. Once John had relaxed, it was removed.
“AAaaaaaah,” John stuttered a cry as Sherlock hollowed his cheeks, and sucked back, dragging his tongue underneath.
“Mycroft has his ways.” Mrs. Hudson brushed him aside. “The important thing is you have the address now. You can pack up and go after you finish your tea.”
“I’m with the foreign affairs office for the London Times. They wanted a few interviews with some important officials in Afghanistan, what’s the word on the locals, blah, blah.” Sherlock waved a hand in the air. “I do photography as well as copy so they offered me the job.”
Sherlock harrumphed, but settled in to slurp the rest of his soup without further comment.  When they were done, they binned their cups, John leading Sherlock down streets farther and farther away from any foot traffic. When they reached a transit stop by a small abandoned-looking park,  John let them rest, finding a low wall to perch on.
“I got it about a year and a half ago. I’d moved in with Irene, and Mycroft had relented and given me access to my funds again. I’d managed to quit Galen, and I’d slacked back on my drug use considerably, but Irene convinced me to quit completely. We both took a week off to stay with a friend of hers, in the country and I went cold turkey. Her friend kept bees, and I sat and watched them all day long, fascinating creatures. I got the tattoo soon after to celebrate getting clean.” Sherlock glanced down, turning his arm to see the tattoo himself.  “Plus it made me think of those mad bee pants you got me all those years ago.”
John tried to keep his face lowered as he dropped off the food, but Sherlock knew he’d seen him by the flush that crept over the back of his neck. John flashed his hand twice behind his back as he pushed through the service door with his empty tray.
John felt like a real prat, huffing his roommate’s pillowcase like it was something illegal bought off the street. He made himself sit up. The idea of washing the bedding suddenly seemed like a horrible idea though, and he quickly made the bed, tugging the duvet into place, smoothing it down over the edges.
A ghost of woman wearing an old-fashioned  bridal gown drifted through the restaurant. “Did you see my dog? My little brown, Poopsie?” She looked frantically about. “Surely you’ve seen him!” she demanded. John caught Sherlock’s eye and they both broke into giggles.
Sherlock stopped listening to his parents, and rolled up off his cushions to his feet. He made his way quietly from his hiding spot to the stairs, and back down to his bedroom, thinking all the way. It wasn’t something he’d ever studied before with his tutors – the planet before the Cardassian colonization. A cursory poking around at the web on his bedroom console quickly showed him the information wasn’t readily available. With a frustrated sigh, Sherlock shut the screen down, and went to brush his teeth.
“Yes?” Sherlock fixed John with a look as if he were trying to x-ray the inside of his brain. “Tell me.”
“It was before John and I . . . were together.” Sherlock shrugged. “Plus the competition was so fierce, I really wasn’t sure I had a chance.”
“Are you two getting married?” Olivia asked, eyes wide. “Mum says it’s legal now. Two men or two women getting married.”
John nods weakly. With his right hand free, he flexes his fingers and brushes them against Sherlock’s cheek.
“You too, John. You’re gorgeous. Perfect. Everything.” Sherlock smiled softly, lifting a hand to stroke his check.
“I used to look like that, back in the day.” Sherlock said as they shrugged their coats on. “I was quite a thing.”
Sherlock thought for a moment. He was technically a Bajoran-lover, yes. He’d had two to date. He tried not to think too hard on the trip to the brothel he’d had as a new recruit. His fellow soldiers had dragged him on a horrid outing to some rundown sex club on Space Station Alpha 24.  He’d looked at the buffet of tired-looking women of varying species on display, and reluctantly chosen the Bajoran. The prostitute had dutifully set about giving him a blow-job, but he’d started crying in the middle of it. She’d listened to him talk about John for the rest of his stay in her room, assuring him he wasn’t the first to cry in her bed. He’d emptied out his credit chip for her when he left.
Sherlock tapped one long, elegant finger against his chin as his intensely pale eyes swept over John, seeming to see straight through him, right down to the atoms. The feeling was electric, like a sudden jolt running over John’s spine.
Afterwards, Sherlock played John a full concert on his violin, and seemed back to his usual self by the time dinner rolled around. John unearthed a package of éclairs from the freezer that they split with tea instead of having anything sensible. When Sherlock commented on John’s right to his medical license slipping, he just unearthed a blob of cream from his pastry and held it out for Sherlock to lick off his finger.
“Good, really good.” John shrugged a few times, swinging his arms to bend them deeply at the elbows. “Yeah good.”
“Being released from the army was a blow to your pride, and your thirst for adventure. You got into a spot of bother both with drinking and gambling as a substitute, and had to move in with your sister. You’ve been attending AA meetings with said sister, though you don’t really need them. What you need is a sense of belonging, and a job worth your talents.”
Sherlock pressed his lips together, feeling about thousand years old as he watched her go. He blew a breath out his nose. It wasn’t right. But then what about their current situation was actually right? Sherlock checked his reader from his bag, and found that his schedule was rather light that day. He returned to the farmhouse to find it empty. After a shower and a change of clothes, Sherlock set off to see if he could locate either John or Kira Nerys about.
“Whoa!” John said, just managing to save his juice. "Yes, to Gryffindor victory!" He smiled, raising his glass to clink against Vic's.
As the light dimmed outside, the candles cast a warm glow over the tables. The low buzz of chatter around them was pleasant, and Sherlock looked simply ravishing, the candlelight painting a buttery hue over his pale skin. John felt himself relaxing over his plate of gnocchi. They talked of nothing terribly consequential until their plates were empty. When Angelo returned, they refused dessert more emphatically than usual.
“I was attempting to discover the melting point of several artificial fibres. If you hadn’t interrupted me, I  . . .”
"No!" John shouts. What Sherlock is doing? Now he’s moving slowly, so slowly, with exquisite control, keeping him right at the edge.
“Oh, sweetheart.” John couldn’t bear not kissing Sherlock any longer, and climbed up to find his lips.
John ended up having to borrow a few boxes and another suitcase from Harry to fit everything he owned. John had no idea he’d managed to amass so many books in such a short time. Soon enough, though, they had everything packed and ready to go.
“Oh, I can see you now,” John cooed. He dropped the book atop the open box to advance toward Sherlock. “I bet you were fierce.”
“Not too much. I mean we’ve gotten a few second glances, and one wanker whispered ‘Poofters’ at us as we were coming back from dinner one night holding hands. I thought Sherlock was going to beat him into the ground. I literally had to hold him back. Scared the hell out of the git.” John chuckled. “But beside that, naw, no worries.”
“We’ll both get it, no worries.” John said, dragging Sherlock by one arm to the scene of the crime.  “Sherlock,” John hissed as they squatted down behind the cubicle wall. “We talked about this – no magic in the Muggle world.”
about your eyes for years before I knew what that meant.” John pulled back a bit to stare over him, drinking in the sight of Sherlock’s face.
Sherlock stepped farther inside, the door whooshing closed behind him.“Sir, you wanted to see me . . .” Sherlock trailed off at spying a familiar-looking back of a head in a nearby chair.
Somehow they ended up separated from the group walking along the beach past the light of the torches, John was a bit foxed on rum drinks, and feeling loose and easy. Bianca led John along, wanting  to show him the stars. She had spent time in London and said what she missed most of home was being able to see the stars. They giggled, walking along the surf, letting it lick at their ankles as they carried their shoes in their hands. Bianca wore a short dress, and John had on the cargo shorts he’d been living in for a fortnight. It was easy to link hands, winding their fingers together. They found a place to sit above the tide. Bianca told John about her job, it seemed she worked at this Institute of Oceanography he’d heard of earlier in the day.
“Oh, love, don’t fret.” Irene appeared in the doorway looking utterly stunning in an off-the shoulder gown. “One doesn’t refuse an invitation to dine with the Prefect of Bajor. We’ll be right as rain tonight.” She clicked over the wood floor, bending down to kiss Kate on the forehead.
“Sweetheart.” John whispered into his hair as he ground himself against Sherlock, the length of him burning like a hot brand over Sherlock’s slippery stomach. John came with a gasp adding to the mess between them.
Sherlock’s mouth pressed into a wobbly line, trying to make up his mind if John were teasing him or not.
Sherlock set a sort of rhythm up, but one of glacial pace. He held John’s rigid cock steady as he moved his mouth over him in near slow motion, savoring each millimeter as he sank down, hollowing his cheeks for maximum pressure as he pulled back, slowly, so achingly slow. Occasionally he paused to lick up the underside of John’s penis, teasing at the frenulum with long, luxuriant swipes of his tongue.
John leaped, but the ball moved past him. A striker on the other team tried to score, but their goalie, Kevin, deflected it. A cheer rose up from the home side. Thank God. They were tied. The next score would decide the game.
He couldn’t help finding Sherlock again at the front. Their eyes met. Sherlock mimed hanging himself. Then sticking a sword into his torso and slicing upward. John was a bit disturbed to see how accurate his motions looked.
Sherlock was simply entranced by the spun sugar decorations one woman used on top of her confection. Later when a man’s Baked Alaska melted all over the plate when decanted, they both cried out in horror.
time, brother dear. There are certain . . . Western practices that won’t fly well with the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.”
“I’m sorry.” Sherlock tucked himself in behind John, placing a hand on his hip “I don’t have the proper social filters. I don’t always say the right thing.”
“John.” Mrs. Watson turned a stony look his way. “Who put his aunt’s hair on fire at a Christmas dinner?”
This couldn’t be happening. Sherlock didn’t even seem aware of what he was doing. He was still asleep when he fumbled out to grab John’s hip, dragging him in to slot against Sherlock’s body.
The lasagna smelled fantastic. John threw some things that hadn’t gone brown yet together for a salad as Sherlock found a bottle of wine to go with it. John moaned his approval at the cheesy entrée once they’d dished it up.
“Well, it’s not really the real estate I’m interested in,” John chuckled. “I think the company was more the draw.”
“Well, how fortunate the hour is finally upon you for visiting.” A smile that no doubt was meant to be warm and genial stretched Mycroft's mouth. “Safe journeys, John.”
The room flooded with another flash of lightning from above, but this one was weaker, and the accompanying boom was merely a rumble, even farther off. The storm outside was finally moving on.
“Well, of course I have — on many occasions. I’m not wearing any pants now. But I suppose the most noteworthy time was when I showed up at Buckingham Palace in nothing but a bed sheet.”
Heart in his throat, John raced toward the lab. As he dashed through the Cold Storage room, the door to the Colder Storage room opened, disgorging a cloud of foul-smelling smoke and a rather dazed-looking Sherlock.
“Oh, no, it’s not. It’s been ages since I saw it, but I remembered I liked it. Very twisty. It’ll be right up your alley.”
Anyone got an idea what the clue means? I bet John and Sherlock do. It's pretty easy if you know about this sort of thing. ;)
“No, I don’t think I shall,” Sherlock said, rearing back to strip off his own shirt, “and what I want is for you to
“Adjunct operative with MI6,” Sherlock said, popping a panel in the car to extract a cold bottle of water that he handed to John. “This was a one-off mission. I did tell you when we first met.”
Carefully, Sherlock brought his legs up to sit tailor fashion, and hunched over. Though the guards had taken his shoes, they had thankfully left him with his work coverall. He brought his cuffed hands down to gently stroke over the fabric of his trouser legs, suppressing a grin when he realized the hidden pocket over his thigh hadn’t been found. Sherlock faked a coughing fit to cover the movement of unlatching the pocket and working out the small tool hidden inside, grateful that his fingers were long enough to complete the task. Once he had palmed the thing, he slumped over even farther, pretending to rest as he worked the small rod against the control panel of the hand restraints in his lap. He nearly dropped the thing twice, but finally he was rewarded with the sound of the locks clicking open. Sherlock blew out a breath. It was a small victory, but one all the same.
“Oh, hi, Sherlock, I thought that was you.” The girl walked closer to the edge of the pool. “Is it alright if I swim with you? Mum said I could only come to the pool if I wasn’t the only one in.”
“No, don’t do that.” John shook his head. It felt as though something were rattling loose. “Christ, my head hurts.” John dropped onto the bench beside Sherlock, rubbing at his forehead.
John stood on the field, licking his lips, watching like a hawk as the other team stormed down the pitch, looking for an in. This was it, the game to make or break them, send them to the finals, or drop them by the wayside. Coach Reynolds had called extra practices for the week leading up to his game, working them mercilessly. John had mourned the time lost with Sherlock, but he didn’t want to let the team down.
Sherlock’s eyes lifted to see what he had missed earlier, two people waiting in the shadows of the kitchen beyond.
“Wait what?  What’s wrong?” Sherlock struggled up onto one elbow, clearly working through a fog to think.
“Oh, okay. I’m from Aldershot, went to All Hallows Catholic School, have one pain-in-the-arse older sister called Harriet, and I’d say it’s a toss up between “Doctor Who” and “Top Gear.”
“Oh bugger. Maybe two in the bath wasn’t such a good idea.” John reached out to worry at the new line.
“Have you never played?” John turned his way. “It’s like a game of Blindman’s Bluff, but in the pool.”
There were so many things Sherlock had wanted to discuss, but with John here before him, they seemed to have flown out the window. Luckily they both seemed content to simply stare at each other grinning stupidly in the dark for the moment.
“Yes, John.” Sherlock threw his head back, gasping for breath as John filled him, surrounded him, immolated him. He bounced slightly on the mattress with the force of John’s thrusts, the sound of the headboard smacking against the wall a distant counterpoint to their labored breaths.
“Oh, you know I see a city burnin’,  I see fiiiiire!” John belted out another line as he fell into Sherlock’s arms.
Sherlock’s long legs had already carried him to the car parked down the street when John finally caught up with him. He was tucked into the passenger seat of the Vauxhall, head down.
The Little Hobbit tucked into his meal with gusto, and the dragon felt an unexpected pleasure course over him at watching the little one so enjoying his food. They talked of inconsequential things as he ate, the dragon asking after the hobbit’s journey, and his life back in the shire. When at last he was done, the dragon pressed the hobbit again, asking why he had really come to his lair. With a blush, the Little Hobbit admitted to being on a mission to find the dwarves’ missing gem.
“No, it’s no problem. I don’t think anyone else noticed it. I’m . . . I’m glad you could come. I’m so sorry about all this . . .” Sherlock flapped a hand towards the house and all contained within.
“What? What is it?” Sherlock swiveled to find what John was reacting to, and saw it then. Someone, or a number of someones with small electric torches were stomping through the garden, heading straight for the house.
“What if I want something that isn’t reasonable?” Sherlock rumbled. The bed was large but not so big that he couldn’t reach out and run a hand down the smooth slip of the pyjama bottoms covering John’s leg. The silk did feel marvelous. He could hear John’s quick intake of breath.
Taking a deep breath to steady himself John began to read. He already knew about the drugs, its hard to hide the track scars when you’ve been so intimate, but reading about the three near fatal overdoses hurt and made his eyes sting with tears.
John led him to an outdoor café that featured a full English breakfast minus the bacon. Sherlock nearly wept at how good the tea was. He finished a whole cup, pouring another before even looking at his plate of food.
John took one and bit down, amazed at the burst of lemon and spice that danced over his tongue. “Oh, that’s delicious.”
“Don’t you think you could do something else if you don’t want to work at your father’s shop? Get your parents to just hire more help?” John wrinkled his brow.
Chairs scraped against the floor as students stood and gathered their things. The twins moved to return their colourful apples at the front of the room. John gave his a last sullen poke with his wand.
The sun was slipping low when Sherlock called his team in for the day. No sense in staying out on dangerous footing as good visibility left them. The boys didn’t seem to have lost any of their vigor as they turned on the anti-grav function of the cart, joking and laughing as they herded it towards the lot where they’d parked the truck.
Harry met him in the lobby of the quaint hotel, folding him into an unusually enthusiastic embrace, obviously swept up in the frenzy of the wedding. Thankfully he had a few minutes to check into his room and change before Harry was pulling him along to a dinner and a whirlwind of introductions with Clara and her family. John smiled and nodded, trying to keep names straight, pleased to see how well Harry looked hanging on the arm of the serious, brown-haired girl she’d decided to call her own.
John felt his throat growing inexplicably tight. He tried clearing it several times before restarting.
He reached for Sherlock's hand and held tight as they approached the dark hole in the floor. They carefully started down the stairs, and found that motion sensors made lights come on as they descended into the bedrock, the walls became rough hewn and damp as they went lower. Any sense of claustrophobia was dispelled by the increasingly strong scent of the sea, and the strong breeze that was rushing past them up the staircase.
“Love, oh love.” John kissed over his neck, along his throat, and Sherlock shivered. He felt John’s cock like a line of steel along his belly. Sherlock moved back to align them together. When their erections brushed, a jolt went through him. It felt like being electrocuted.
“Sorry. Wish I could help you, but I can’t give that kind of information out,” the manager said. “It’s against the rules.”
“Pants are pants.” Sherlock shrugged, still looking touched that John’s mum had picked some out for him too.
“It’s good,” he agreed, leaning in to wrap his mouth around the side of the ice cream for another bite.
The gorgeous man looked antsy, shifting his weight, adjusting the tie around his neck as though it bothered him. God, John wanted to loosen it for him, unbutton the stiff collar hiding that lovely column of a throat, kiss his way down . . . John shook himself from his reverie as Mrs. Holmes leaned over him, passing her sister a tissue from her handbag. Sherlock looked over, caught John’s gaze and rolled his eyes, miming great boredom.
“Yes. Yes, of course.” Sherlock hastened to find the key to release him. As he unlocked John’s first wrist, Sherlock realized the slat of the headboard was wiggling loose in his hand. He quickly unlocked the other cuff, and let John reclaim the use of his arms.
As Sherlock softened and slipped out of him, John became aware of Sherlock’s dead weight crushing him into the bed, and the fluids sliding over his skin.
“Mr. Sigerson, some men need to speak with you,” the hotel manager said through the door, his voice falsely polite.
“Good,” John sighed. “It’s a date.” As least he wasn’t getting out of the car without a promise to see this bewitching creature again.
Sherlock accepted the compliment with a nod, and continued pulling John into the flow of foot traffic beyond the exhibit. They walked some distance until Sherlock found a quiet corner to speak.
John headed off to brush his teeth and have a quick wash, returning in pyjama bottoms and an old tee. Sherlock remained at his desk, slumped down a bit further in his chair. Though he still didn’t acknowledge him, John noticed Sherlock’s eyes flicking his way when he thought John wasn't looking.  John cheerfully whistled snippets of an Ed Sheeran song as he stowed his things, and got ready to sleep. Sherlock made no move to leave his desk. Eventually John switched out the overhead lights. Sherlock’s desk lamp and computer continued to glow, a bright island of light in the room.
Puzzled but thirsty, John reached for a glass of lemonade. He’d swallowed half of it down when Sherlock strolled up, now decently covered in a long robe with Claudette at his side.
Sherlock hmmphed, but John smiled at him so indulgently, he was hard-pressed to take actual offense. It didn’t help that John’s possessions had only taken one trip down. Sherlock suddenly had visions of bringing John to his old tailor, and having him outfitted in a set of new suits, something cut to show off his broad shoulders, and nicely-rounded arse. It would be lovely to see him in clothes other than the shapeless jumpers and jeans he currently possessed. Sherlock squelched the vision immediately. There was no reason to be making untenable plans.
“I’ve never seen a more clever bed sharing than you two got up to. Those illusions spells Sherlock put up around your room were top notch.” Professor Pinworthy smiled before taking a sip from her cup. “It’s no wonder he got an internship with Herr Moser. He'll go far, that one.”
“Yeah, well  . . .” Suddenly John couldn’t bear to talk about Sherlock any longer. He felt a prickle building behind his eyelids, and he blinked hard. He’d be thrice damned if he’d start crying in front of sodding Mycroft Holmes.  “So, what brings you to Hogwarts for graduation?”
“I think it’s bedtime for all,” Sherlock announced, snapping on the light on the landing, and herding his charges toward the stairs.
John couldn’t stop staring at the silver goblet. It drew him closer, almost shimmering from its place on the shelf.  He reached to pick it up, admiring the light glinting over its surface. “So,” John called over to Alastaire. “Everlasting love, eh?”
“I think the private residence of Gul Dukat will have sufficient security that we won’t have to fear for anyone’s safety tonight.”  Sherlock put on his most reassuring smile.
“John, I’ve been tasked with using my ‘eye for design’ to make a new display. This is the first time someone has asked me to do something here that might actually take a portion of my brain to accomplish.  This is on.”
“Well, I’m off. Busy day.” John smiled again, and bounced upright, intent on making the morning as normal as possible.
John didn’t have footie practice that night, and was pleased to catch up with his friends again at dinner in the cafeteria by the science hall. He spotted Bill Murray’s ginger head, and moved to join him and the others.
“You never contacted me.” John looked at him in the dark of the taxi as they swayed through the streets of Kabul. “I thought I might have done something wrong.”
When the back door rattled open, John sat up, his heart nearly leaping out of his throat. He tried to keep the disappointment off of his face when it turned out to be Mrs. Hudson with a stack of tupperware.
“For Godsake, Harriet, I’m a doctor. I understand the benefits of regular physical therapy.” John felt a twinge in his shoulder just thinking about it. “I rescheduled . . . I have a thing today.”
“Let me buy you breakfast.” John tilted his head charmingly to the side, and the wave of affection that swept over Sherlock in response was almost alarming.
“Sherlock, could I do this in Kabul?” John reached up to drag Sherlock down, burying short, sturdy fingers into his curls to pull him close enough to kiss. He crushed his lips to Sherlock’s, sweeping his tongue in to tangle and stroke with wet heat, stealing the very breath out of him.
Sherlock woke before John on Saturday. He propped his chin over a bent elbow to watch John sleeping peacefully beside him.  The sunlight filtering in through the blinds kissed the tips of his blond hair making him look more ethereal than solid.
“Eww, we got your sheet all manky. Looks like laundry tonight.” John pushed away from the wet spots.
“Hey, love, no, no.” John scooted back down to throw an arm around him.  It’s not like that.  I just don’t want you involved any deeper. You’re doing more than enough getting us supplies like this.” His eyes darted to the bags on the floor. “I keep worrying that you’re going to get caught stealing . . .”
One night, Sherlock came running in late at half past eleven looking quite flustered. Truth be told, John had been a bit nervous too at the break in their routine, but they hadn’t talked about that either. They’d just carried on, turned out the light and gone to bed, same as they’d been doing for the last two weeks.  The next morning though, John had casually suggested that Sherlock give him his mobile number. Sherlock had gotten out his phone, and they’d exchanged the information without really talking about why.
When at last they reached the entrance to the underground citadel, weary from travel, they were dismayed to see the large stone blocking the way. The dwarves noticed the markings etched into the rock wall above the entrance, but try as they might, none of them could decipher the strange language and speak the words to open the way. The Little Hobbit who was even more foot-sore and tired than the dwarves, pushed his way through to see the inscription himself. As luck would have it, the words were written in Ancient Hobbitish, an older version of the dialect spoken around the shire, and the Little Hobbit had no trouble at all making sense of the words. Heat rose over his face, and he bit his tongue lest he say anything that gave his knowledge away.
“Your wish is my command.” John raised Sherlock’s hand to his lips, pressing a kiss to the back of it.
They passed a line of portraits hung along the wall of people with pale eyes and pointed chins.  Several of them called out sharply to Sherlock in French as he passed, but he ignored them to duck into a room holding the door open for John to follow. With a wave of his wand, Sherlock set the lamps blazing to life revealing a parlour of sorts lined round with shelves and cabinets.
There were things to be said, but somehow Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to break the pleasant mood at the table with uncomfortable topics. Sherlock had no idea what was to come when they stepped off the island. If these were to be his last moments with John, he wanted to savor them.
The shiny liquid increased, pooling up as he stroked around his entrance until a veritable cascade tipped over, streaming down his arse and thighs to stain the sheet darker beneath him. John shuddered, and plunged two fingers into himself.
“Ah, how kind of you.” Mycroft leaned in, a more human expression sliding in to chase the other away. “You needn’t trouble yourself though. I’ve already brought something in myself. I never trust Sherlock to keep the larder stocked.”
House elves ghosted through the room all evening, refilling water and wine goblets, and carrying out new covered dishes at regular intervals. Mr. Blackwell and Mr. Goyle chortled on about the Chudley canons, and some proposed bit of legislation that might force Muggle-born Wizards to carry special cards.  Mycroft hummed noncommittally occasionally, refusing to be drawn into anything, and John drank more wine than he meant to, he was feeling so twitchy. When they’d finally made their way to some small cakes and cheeses for pudding, John realized he needed to wee something terrible. He nudged Sherlock to ask where the toilet was.
When they came back together, it was worlds apart from the frenzied coupling of before, a languid meeting of lips, hands smoothing, and legs interlocking. Almost in a dream, they shucked their briefs, finally pressing skin on skin. John asked to keep his shirt on, it was . . . more than he wanted to deal with right now, and Sherlock didn’t seem to mind.
“So what would you like for dinner? I thought we could go out, just the two of us, and have a moment alone before it gets all crazy.”
They both felt a bit on eggshells from the night before, and John hoped that the party would make up for it, blow some of the cobwebs away. Harry had come by for dinner, and after drinking up all the wine she’d brought, had turned on Sherlock, saying horrible things she wouldn’t even remember later. In a dark, slurred voice, Harry had blamed Sherlock for breaking John’s heart and driving him away, telling him he didn’t deserve to be taken back in.  John went ballistic in return, yelling at Harriet, threatening to toss her out on the street on her drunk arse if she didn’t shut the hell up. Sherlock had calmed them both down, and put Harry to bed on the sofa with a light sleeping draught and hangover cure. She’d been red-eyed and contrite over eggs the next morning, hugging John tearfully goodbye at the door.
“I’m . . . sorry, sir,” the brown-haired one managed to stutter. “It’s just I hadn’t seen Nander in months. I thought he was dead.”
They talked until they were stuffed with baked goods, and fairly sloshing with tea, both seemingly unwilling to break the spell that had spun around them in the cozy, yellow kitchen. When the conversation turned serious and Sherlock admitted to kicking a drugs habit by starting up with his bees, John couldn’t help it, he had to touch the beautiful man. John leaned in and scooped up his pale, elegant hand looking slightly lost on the center of the table.
“Yeah, I do. I met him at Christmas, he’s a good bloke. I just . . . mum wants me to bring Sherlock.”
They waved Molly good-night when they neared her dorm, watching as she made it to the front of her building.
“Maybe so.” Sherlock quickly typed a reply, and slipped his phone away. “Enough about Victor though. Someone promised me a night out.”
The rest of the ceremony raced by in a blur. John’s head snapped up at “HOLMES” and for just a flicker, he half-expected Sherlock to walk by. He watched as instead Alastaire Holmes stalked imperiously across the stage, shoulders thrown back to receive his diploma. John climbed the steps in a bit of a daze when his own name was called. He accepted his scroll, and shook several outstretched hands, one of which was a beaming Professor Lestrade. John glanced toward the castle looming in the distance as he made his way back down the stairs. It was hard to remember how awestruck he’d been with Hogwarts, arriving as a wet-behind-the-ears first year. He’d miss the place, really miss it, John thought as he found his seat again.
Sherlock took a deep breath, willing his voice to work. “Was that real?” he croaked. “Those . . . visions . . . is it real?”
Sherlock finally let his gaze tear away from the treasure in his hand to return to Mycroft. “Thank you.”  The side of his mouth tipped up into a small smile despite himself.
“Harriet, excellent timing.” Mrs. Watson smiled at her. “Pull up a chair, luv, I got extra of those pork dumplings you like.”
“Yes, sir.” Sherlock shot John a cheeky look, but he set to forking up his scrambled eggs all the same.
John blew out a breath when he got back to his office. He sincerely hoped things would work out well for the teen and her family.  John dropped heavily into his chair to quickly write up his notes. The damn charity ball invitation lay in the middle of his desk, staring up at him accusingly.
“If you say so.” Irene laughed and patted John on the arm. “Good night, darlings!” she called to the room at large, scooping up her bag, and whirling away in cloud of perfume to join her girlfriend at the door.
Sherlock went exploring, his beautiful mouth and fingers moving over John, lips and tongue caressing every inch they came to. John closed his eyes and groaned, simply adrift in a sea of sensation lapping over him. He cried out when a mouth closed over a nipple and sucked. Inexorably, the warm softness moved down his chest and belly, sliding and slipping until the most glorious wet heat engulfed his cock.
“I’m sorry.” Sherlock didn’t know what to say. Tears were welling up in his eyes. “John, it’s not right. I know it’s not. It’s why we’re fighting in the best ways we can, fighting to support the Resistance. It’s going to happen. You just have to hold on . . .”
As Sherlock went to inspect the lab equipment, John began opening the freezers. His whoop of delight was as heartfelt as Sherlock’s when he discovered that the first one was filled with frozen meat. He found steaks, lamb chops, pork loins, and several whole chickens.
Sherlock was right, the club wasn’t anything too edgy. It turned out to be a brick building sandwiched between a Chinese place and a bank, featuring some twirling lights on the ceiling, and a long bar set along one wall. A selection of fruity drinks and beers had tempted a range of smartly-dressed people to mill about, yelling to be heard over last year’s pop hits pounding out of the large speakers set in the corners.
John ripped off his jacket and knotted one sleeve around his wrist, dangling the rest of it down for Sherlock to use as a rope.  Through grit, and sheer determination, John managed to haul Sherlock back up the side of the rock face to safety. John patted over him, breathless, seemingly trying to touch all of him at once.
The bullet that had ripped through John’s shoulder had knocked him clean out of Afghanistan and back to England with an ugly scar, and a bloody psychosomatic limp to match. The army was done with him, and with the tremor in his hand, being a surgeon was right out too. John had been in a dark place since he’d washed up on his sister’s doorstep.
“John?” Sherlock’s eyes held such a naughty twinkle as he held out a hand that John almost suggested bypassing the dance floor to find some nearby cupboard, but they made it out to the dance floor to join their friends.
“You and your games,” John said, completely failing to hit the chastising tone he’d been aiming for.
“Yeah, maybe we can do it again next week.” John grinned. “I owe you one, right between the eyes, ya bastard.”
John involuntarily brought his hand to his mouth, frozen in wonder. Beside him, Sherlock stood transfixed. All around, the Northern Lights ribboned across the heavens in otherworldly shades of green, blue, and violet.
“Oh, that’s true,” Sherlock said with a shiver, suddenly sorry he’d started the whole fanciful conversation.
“A bit,” John said. “She’s annoyed I’m not around to help in the kitchens, and we can’t ride home together on the transit bus at night.”
The rest of their days were spent in individual pursuits. Sherlock had unearthed parts of the corpse in the freezer and was busy with increasingly smelly experiments that kept John far away from his lab. Left to his own devices, John picked up the laptop and tried his hand at writing some stories. He’d done a bit of writing back in his uni days, and the hobbit and dragon tale inspired him. After a few aborted war stories, he started on an epic tale of two men trapped on an island  together, loosely basing it on their own strange situation. He refused to let Sherlock read any of it until he was several chapters in, but then agreed, finding that Sherlock’s contributions greatly helped the story.
John sputtered and choked, but some of the brew made it down. Something like fire raced through John, jolting him aware. When he stopped coughing, John was able to open his eyes and focus on those crouched around him, Victoire and Teddy, and Alastaire Holmes, of all people.
“Blame her? Of course I do. This is practically sexual harassment. I mean certainly you’re an attractive man, but this is absurd.”
When Sherlock told him no, John shook his head, and moved back to the stand to grab a few. Sherlock watched him returning when a blonde girl stepped into view halting his progress.
The Little Hobbit had only a cursory idea of what the dwarves’ magic jewel looked like, but he’d been told he’d know it when he saw it.  His eyes grew round at the mounds of treasure heaped on the floor before him. Just as he thought he’d spied something twinkling and made to move closer, the coins shifted under his feet, and the mighty dragon’s head burst forth.”
“Mr. Holmes, is everything alright?” Lor sat up in his sleeping bag as Quen rubbed his eyes groggily nearby.
“Alright.” John didn’t look happy, but he allowed Sherlock to crawl into his lap, hugging him tightly, bending to kiss him until they both forgot what they’d even been talking about.
They glanced at each other, and burst into giggles making their way back to Hogwarts, and John’s four-poster bed awaiting them in the Gryffindor dorms.
“We don’t need the whole suit if we aren’t harvesting honey.” Sherlock assured him. “Just move slowly, and relax yourself, the bees can sense if you’re calm or not.”
“Oh, right. Right.” Why hadn’t he thought of that? Already John was improving the situation greatly. Sherlock flicked his wand at the diorama.
“God, Joooohn.” Sherlock could hardly speak. His hole was opening, flooding with wet, quivering with each pass of John’s steely erection.
“I’m glad we’ve got the study group tonight, I’m going to need it,” Molly added, chewing at the end of her pen.
Later, in bed, John lay in Sherlock’s arms, his head pillowed on his shoulder. They’d made love carefully, Sherlock taking John into his mouth, then bringing himself off as John whispered encouragement his hand stroking down and over his arse.
“Mmmm.” John moved in to drop little kisses on the bee tattoo wandering up Sherlock’s arm. It seemed to be playing a merry game of chase, daring John to follow.  John happily followed it up Sherlock’s shoulder and over to his chest. When it landed on Sherlock’s left nipple, John moved in, laving over them both with the flat of his tongue.
“I couldn’t think of another place to take them.” Sherlock shrugged. “Hotels are too well watched, and most of the Bajoran safe houses in the city have been raided. We’ll find somewhere more permanent to go once I can see to their injuries.”
The Cardassian rounded on him, seemingly happy to transfer his anger to the newcomer, but a glance over Sherlock’s badge slowed him down.
“Please don’t ever hide yourself from me again. I want you, John. All of you, regardless of this wereslut business. I  . . . love you.”
“It might be a relationship of the past,” Sherlock said, waving a hand. “So hard to track women  down, you know, always changing their last names. Still, no matter. If you could give me some contact information so that I might alert her to her inheritance? It is a sizeable sum, and I’m certain she’d want to know.”
“God, Vic I wish I knew what happened. I don’t know, I just don’t . . .” John’s voice cracked horribly, and he had to stop.
“No, wait . . .” John started after him, but Sherlock was already there, pinwheeling his arms, his big coat silhouetted against the last streaks of red in the dark sky for a moment before he slipped and tumbled over.
“What are you doing? This is a sensitive experiment . . .” Sherlock sputtered with some indignation as John returned to reach around him, and turn off the flame.
“Hey, it’s fine. I wanted to see your room. Your sculptures were amazing. You are amazing. THANK YOU for showing me that.”
“Boyfriend?” Sherlock shifted in John’s arms to rotate, sloshing water as he moved to face John. The bathtub gave a bit of a creak, and the grout along the tiles joining it to the wall cracked.
John tumbled helplessly in a sea of soft lips and roving hands, but getting off in a hallway at school was no way to keep his prefect badge, or help either of them through their exams.
The security guard at John’s building remembered him, and waved Sherlock cheerfully on which he was grateful for. He doubted he would have had the patience to suffer through any song and dance that evening. As it was, Sherlock could hardly wait for the lift to move fast enough, finally depositing him at John’s floor. In an instant he was rapping at John’s door, near panicking. Perhaps he’d been wrong?
“So your parents, erm, they know then . . .” John trailed off, catching himself as the train jostled its way out of the station.
John followed him meekly when they got off at a stop at the edge of the space port. They soon lost themselves in the flow of foot traffic looking quite unremarkable amidst all manner of strange outlanders. Sherlock stumped along with his cane, leading John until they came to a chemist shop. Sherlock ducked inside, pulling John along behind him.
John was pleased when a reply appeared two days later at breakfast. A tawny Hogwarts owl dropped a scroll into his lap just missing his plate of bangers and beans. John hurried to untie the cord that bound it. He spread the thick paper out, the breath catching in his throat as he read the short message.
“I hardly remember my Da,” John said, “ but he was a doctor. I suppose I might have followed in his footsteps.”
“Oh.” Sherlock set his glass down. “Yes, of course. I should have given you the address straightaway." It was Sherlock’s turn to look chagrined. "John, I’m sorry.”
The restaurant turned out to be a cozy affair with white fairy lights twinkling around the edges. The place was doing a good business at lunchtime, but they managed to find a table for four after only a short wait.
John picked his way around the chaos of the other students moving into their rooms, narrowly missing a skateboard left in the middle of the corridor. He grinned when he spied a face he recognized and stopped to speak to Mike Stamford, a friend and fellow pre-med student. John was glad to find that Mike was on his same hall, just a few doors down from his number, 221. After a few minutes of sharing how their summers had been, Mike asked if John knew who his roommate was.
Sherlock twisted like an otter, sliding himself over to better face John, smiling shyly up at him. His curls had softened to hang heavy around his face, his eyes open and luminous. John pressed a kiss to his forehead before he drained his glass, taking a full mouthful of the bubbly wine and moved down to kiss Sherlock’s mouth. He opened his lips to pass the liquid to his lover, chasing it with his tongue after he swallowed, licking the taste in Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock groaned, deep and rumbly against him. It was awkward snogging in the bath, limbs pressed against the porcelain sides, Sherlock’s weight against his belly, and most of him down under the water where John couldn’t reach.
“Right, so exactly .  . .” John started when Sherlock chose that moment to appear in the door behind them.
“I’m actually rather glad you came with me today.” Molly smiled. “I don’t think Dov would have enjoyed it half as much as you.”
“Do you have a minute to talk?” John said. Sherlock watched John’s lips move, and he had to think a moment as if he needed to translate John’s words from some foreign language to make sense in English.
“No more so than me, John. I sat in my fancy house, with anything I needed at my fingertips. I had no idea the backs breaking to keep our lifestyle going. Your mother . . .” Sherlock had to swallow deeply. “Your mother was more of a mum to me than my own. I used to wish I was Bajoran like you John  . . . I was so ashamed . . .” Sherlock was horrified to find that tears had gathered in his eyes. They welled up, overflowing, spilling down his cheeks. He turned, trying to duck his face, thinking of nothing other than getting away to hide.
“I missed you more,” John said.  When his stomach gave a loud rumble, Sherlock gently untangled them.
There was a bright red box bolted to the wall near the entrance of the tunnel. The size of a large briefcase, it appeared to be waterproof with a large plastic latch.
John squeezed Sherlock’s hand, and received an answering pressure. They stood together, marvelling at the spectacle, until the Aurora Borealis had played itself out.
“Well, as it turns out, it’s very possible,” John said in an oddly light tone. “Looks like it just wasn’t meant to be, ya know?”
John could make all of this normal. It could be normal sharing a bed. He had spent enough time with his footie mates that he knew how the banter and teasing went.
Sherlock manhandled John into an open booth before seating himself across from him. The light was overly bright after the dimness of the street, and Sherlock squinted, waiting for his eyes to adjust. He was certain the unforgiving glare was doing nothing for his pale, pasty English complexion, but one glance at John confirmed that his friend looked if anything, even MORE attractive in the harsh overhead light.
“Erm, no, I am home actually. Just moved in, in fact.” John scratched at the back of his neck wishing he had something on other than Sherlock’s slippery dressing gown barely covering his modesty.
“That’s what we need.”  Sherlock said. “It should block any sensors as well as any visual targeting.”
“Yes, fine.” Sherlock winced at bit at making his aching body obey his commands. “I’ve been thinking though.”
“Hmmm? What?” Sherlock rose up slightly to look down their bodies, watching as John made a fist around his cock, sliding the foreskin gently along his length.
Sherlock pulled the cylinder open, and found a curled piece of paper inside. He coaxed it out with his fingers, and spread it flat to read  . . . Who you really are.
John chipped away at the ground until he finally made a small hole. There was a yellow wire, easily spotted in the loosened soil. He pulled at it. “This must deactivate the fence. Wasn’t there more to the rhyme though? At the beginning?”
John at last turns away, but Sherlock still can't move. There is no relief from the tension; no release from John's hold. Even when he's not directing that hardened stare at him, Sherlock feels the thread of awareness between them, binding him to that squalid mattress.
John.” It's meant to cut to the bone. John had expressed to Sherlock's tombstone (which Sherlock kept under surveillance for a time) that he felt a lot of guilt over having called Sherlock a machine right before he jumped to his apparent death and, in this moment, Sherlock would really like John to feel some fraction of the pain he feels himself. But John doesn't take the bait.
“Come for me, too?" He lets the words slide smoothly off his lips in that imperious and almost playful tone that is sure to get under John's skin. Sherlock has always enjoyed courting danger and, in this moment, his body is humming with anticipation and he's almost grinning as he watches John pivot slowly towards him.
John jerks his own head away just in time to dodge the crack to his nose but it obviously infuriates him. An arm slips into a chokehold around Sherlock's throat.
His eyes had glinted with something hungry as they swept over the bodies huddled in the dark, like they were an offering lain at his feet and he was trying to determine if any one of them were truly worthy. His hands were on his hips and he had rocked onto his toes slightly, lips pursed in consideration, as he flexed his pelvis forward, subtly drawing attention to the prominent bulge of his half-hard cock. It was clear what he wanted.
When Sarah talks of how nice it would be to move out to a place like this someday to start a private practice and a family, John has to force a smile while internally he cringes. He'd go mad out in the country. What would he even do without the thrill of chasing criminals and the constant demands of Sherlock, likely to intrude and whisk him away to adventure at any moment?
“John. John.” Sherlock tries for scornful and it comes out increasingly desperate, slipping towards pleading.
Being pursued by Sherlock is a welcome distraction that keeps him on his toes and prevents his mind from slipping back into those haunting memories and dark thoughts that creep up on him in the quiet hours - things he'd rather keep buried.
John's weight moves off of him, but not quickly and he doesn't retreat far. When Sherlock turns and sits up he's aware that John's hand is right by his ankle, poised like it is ready to resume a grip on any errant limbs at the first sign of a fight.
He has always been a skilled kisser and it quickly becomes heated. His need flares to life like a spark in dry grass. They stumble into her room, his lips never leaving her skin, and in a flurry he's got both their kit off and pushed her to the bed. He is practically ravenous, so he wastes no time before spreading her out like a feast and plunging in with tongue and lips. In the back of his mind he is aware of that extra sense of pride and satisfaction it gives him to drawing pleasure out of her as if it is his personal purpose in life. There is a greater need; a way that indulging in her soft curves, her lovely wet heat, her little gasps settles him within a sense of himself. Each moan of pleasure he pulls out of her is a victory; vindication and revenge.
” Sherlock feels the spark of vicious fury ignite, propelling him forward. He begins scrambling, gathering up the items he'd kept scattered around him during the days he'd been wasting away here; matches, cigarettes, a hand-written list. He shoves it all into his sweatpants pockets. He turns and glares at John.
The Man - the stranger that John reminds him of in moments when he lets his true nature shine through.
A thumb slipped down Sherlock's crease, pressing firmly against the sensitive skin of his entrance. It felt huge and rough and no one had ever touched Sherlock there before. He yelped and all his arse muscles clenched, hard as rock in the American's grip as he tried to pull away. The man's grip tightened to bruisingly harsh and didn't allow him to retreat.
It is pretty much an even match, move and counter-move... until things go awry during John’s holiday with Sarah.
Sherlock holds himself very still, everything focused on that touch. On some level he knows there's nothing behind it -
They are frozen like that for an eternity; staring at each other. Around the two of them the decrepit building turns thin and watery like an ink sketch being destroyed by the rain. The once hard, defined edges of the rough wooden floors, broken out windows and paint-chipped walls are now blurring and running together. Sherlock feels his edges slipping away too, blurring, melting into nothing before John.
Sherlock hadn't needed the money. That was easy to come by if you were clever, quick and observant. And though he didn't show much care for his body by refusing to eat or sleep and by pumping it full of drugs, he'd never let anyone touch him or wanted to touch another before.
It is an odd arrangement; a perfectly demented symbiosis for two decidedly imperfect men. Sherlock gets to run his little psychological experiment when he is bored and John shouts and snarls when he can bear no more of the suffocating confines of civilian life. They both get what they want and can handle what the other deals out.
“Should I fuck you dry, little whore?” The American's voice was dark. This was no empty threat, he would do it and delight in the destruction. “Shove it in you with nothing more than what precum you can milk from me? Make you earn it - feel every inch? Ruin you for anyone else?”
John is on his feet too, moving after Sherlock, not letting him get away. “Oh, God, this is about me,” John says and Sherlock is rocketed into sheer panic. "You've done this because of me." Sherlock kicks the backdoor with all his strength and the plywood goes flying, crashing across the fire escape.
Sherlock didn't understand and that was a rare experience for him. He sat helpless before this fierce, powerful man and it was intoxicating. A sensation of heat rushed through his body with dizzying force. He blinked and blinked and only managed a small nod.
that he grabs her hips, presses closed his eyes, and keeps thrusting into her, chasing that release that he so desperately needs after the agonizing sexual tension of the past few weeks.
He feels like a human inferno; ears and cheeks and groin heating unbearably. He squeezes his thighs together and presses his eyes shut, trying to choke off the swell of needy flesh.
He pushes it all away and tries to mentally steel himself for the fight that's sure to come. He calls up all those biting quips that he'd been over and over in his mind. They are certain to spurn John on and bring this long-deteriorating relationship to its final explosive end.
“Oh, hello, John. Didn't expect to see you here.” Sherlock twists on the flat mat he's almost fused to, drawn to the familiar timber of John's soothing voice like a moth to a flame. He hadn't been seen by John when the ex-soldier burst into this rotting and condemned building for the rotting and condemned dredges of humanity but he couldn't resisted the temptation to reveal himself. He wants John to see this. See what he's been reduced to - or what he
“Don't - don't do that,” the man said in a voice that was so oddly empty that it was almost more terrifying for its blandness. “You move when I tell you. We have an arrangement, yeah. We have an arrangement and I’m not done with you.”
John fingers are tangled in his hair, rough against his scalp, and each tug sends an exhilarating sensation skittering over Sherlock's scalp, short-circuiting his brain. John's other arm is braced on the mat by Sherlock's shoulder and his knee is planted by Sherlock's hip as John leans over his inclined body. He is caged and John's face is so close, eyes hard, teeth bared. He could bite. He could do
John might not have had a choice in falling for the man but he will be damned before he gives his body over without a fight. When Sherlock takes him he intends to love him viciously, ferociously, until they are both broken.
Whatever it may have once been, the condemned building with the busted out windows and leaking roof was little more than a rotting and crumbling heap now, bowing down, subservient to the elements and infested with the outcasts of the city, scurrying in the dark corners like rats. Full of thieves, crackheads and runaways, it was not a place people went unless they had nowhere else to go. Yet, the man that strutted in, with all the hardened confidence of a killer, clearly came looking for just such a place.
He looks down at his uncooperative body hidden beneath dirt-smeared and too-loose sweatpants and a threadbare shirt and finds he is quivering, bones rattling inside his skin. Not even the Hound with its glowing eyes, razor teeth, and night black fur had made Sherlock feel so frantic. Then, at least, it had been pure fear, pure terror, pure revulsion. This is a many spiked weapon; fear and lust and shame and need and self-loathing and desire spinning like a ball of daggers, shredding his insides.
A sound chokes out of Sherlock at those words and is blessedly muffled into the mat. There's something so delicious in that thought - the implications that John can take control and make him surrender - could take all of him -
By evening, John accepts, as he has with many women before, that the relationship with Sarah isn't going to work out in the long run. They might enjoy a few good months but their needs and dreams for the future don't align. She is pleasant, pretty, and she understands his work as a doctor. She also has survived a rather horrifying evening when the Black Lotus case hijacked their first date. Yet, he sees the end looming. This actually makes him relax. The pressure to make things work is off and he can just enjoy their time together for what it is;
He's talking about the drug use but Sherlock can almost believe John sees the rest too - sees how he'd let John do anything to him in this moment. How desperately he wants John to devour and desecrate him and fuck him into the mattress until his tender cock is rubbed raw against the mat and he explodes in pleasure/pain.
After warming her up, John has her on her back, luxuriating in watching the way she bounces when he snaps into her with increasing vigor. She's sweaty and whimpering with pleasure,  eyes screwed closed tight as of he's a bit too much for her. This is what he wants; all soft yielding curves and sweet cries. He frees a hand from where it is holding her arse up for the best angle to grope her breast and pluck at her perked nipple. She cries out and tightens around him.
John is furious and his body is his only weapon to strike back against the visage. He drives into that vision of Sherlock harder, pounding almost violently with forceful snaps of his hips. Those cold, challenging eyes just stare up at him. His hauntingly pale features are arranged in an almost bored expression, as if there is nothing John can possibly do now to affect him. John's fingers dig into hips with bruising force and his face twists in an angry snarl as he rages against his conqueror.... but the damage is
Sherlock thinks that he can hear moments stretching out before him, marching him forward towards his own destruction like war drums. Faster and faster. Then he realises it is only his heart... but that truth is
As much as he tries to close it all out and just get through to the other side of his surging orgasm, in the darkness behind his closed eyes it becomes Sherlock’s body spread beneath him.
John knows all his own vulnerabilities and Sherlock quickly recognises that he can poke his fingers into those old wounds all day long and the ex-soldier will hardly flinch. That would
“£200,” he snapped back at the man haughtily, sure that it was far more than the man wanted to spend for some quick and dirty tumble with a random junkie. After all, there was no lack of established sex workers in London, yet this man had come here instead. Maybe he wanted a challenge or maybe he just wanted a cheap fuck.
He is careful to keep his coat wrapped around himself and not look at John as they speed away from the scene of his crime.
Perhaps it was the confrontation with Moriarty at the pool that found Sherlock requiring epic levels of distraction. Or perhaps Sherlock needed to claim victory in
“For God’s sakes, John! I’m on a case.” He spits venomously and tries to believe it is not as petulant and defensive as it feels. He marches across the fire escape and jumps down aware that John is following.
Sherlock tries to resist it, using all his strength to keep his arm from being twisted up behind his back, but John has far too much experience cuffing criminals and holding them until NSY finally catches up. Then warm, slightly callused fingers are sliding against Sherlock's forearm, pushing his sleeve up.
“Against the wall.” The American said, yanking Sherlock up to his feet with ease. Before Sherlock had time to process what he'd agreed to, he was facing the wall, hands splayed against the chipped plaster, legs spread, and arse bare to the cool air. His trousers and pants had been efficiently yanked down to the back of his thighs, heedless to the fact that everyone else in proximity could see, should they care to look. Embarrassment flushed Sherlock from chest to the tips of his ears at being so exposed. It was wrong, but somehow the thought of being on display, of the obscene spectacle of everyone being able to see, heightened the sensations building within him.
Sherlock tries to push himself back into the mattress and put some distance between their bodies. His quivering legs feel like jelly, knocking against the hard muscle of the inside of John's thigh. His heels slide against the mat and bump against John's tensed calf. He swiftly brings his leg up towards his chest and kicks down hard on John's shin. Then it's only a fast hit to John's inside elbow with palm and John is falling sideways with a curse. Sherlock twists onto his stomach and scrabbles frantically up the mat on his forearms.
Something had shifted;  the last few weeks had seen a sudden surge in Sherlock's efforts to taunt and toy with John. Their subversive game has escalated to
He grips her hips hard and pushes in deep against the resistance. He gets lost in the moment trying to curse and say something encouraging; perhaps both
John eagerly embraces the opportunity to have a break to relax with Sarah and finally consummate their long, on-again/off-again courtship. In truth, it feels like he's been given an eleventh hour pardon whilst on death row. The last two weeks, rife with escalating tension between him and Sherlock, had had the menacing undertone of a march towards certain death.
Suddenly Sherlock is caught in the memory of the domineering American agent that took his pleasure in Sherlock mercilessly while in a dark and dank crack house very much like
Sherlock had never seen anything like him. There was his shiny shoes and crisp trousers, his perfectly starched white shirt and the golden brown hair, gone gray and slicked to the side. If there was any doubt about his casual air of authority, one need only look to the blatant threat of his gun in a holster on his hip; law enforcement but not military or even police - he was something completely different. An agent of some kind. Foreign.
Initially, he is furious at Sherlock. Now that the psychological war is already lost, he is disarmed and demoralized. He has no defense against the constant barrage of Sherlock's advances except the thinnest of armor;
John is coming and he's not going to let this go. Sherlock is terrified of what comes next. Just as John reaches him, Mary speeds up alongside them in a car and stops with a squeal of brakes. Sherlock has never been so relieved to see her. “In. Both of you, quickly,” she says firmly and Sherlock jumps in without a backward glance.
He focuses on what John must see; the bruises of old puncture wounds artfully littered over his marble white arm. All on display, right there, by the crest of Sherlock's half-naked arse. John, who holds him so high above other men, is at last seeing that he is not pure and untouchable, but damaged and filthy and... desperate to be taken. Sherlock tilts his spine ever so slightly, his cock rubbing against coarse mat while his arse presses back against John. John doesn't seem to notice, just seems to think Sherlock is still trying to escape. He lets out a harsh breath, like an angry bull, and holds Sherlock's arm tighter.
He considers just packing up and walking away but John Watson is not a man that runs away from his battles - even ones he is
The room seems to shrink and expand all at once as Sherlock watches John's back; the coil of muscles, the tense shoulders, the military posture. He watches those perfect, sturdy fingers, capable of inflicting or soothing pain, curl and uncurl into a tight ball.
It doesn’t take long for John to catch on. Sherlock’s game is all subtle, low key stuff. Nothing obvious or overly aggressive, just little, progressive, predatory grooming techniques; testing John's tolerance and boundaries. Sherlock probably thinks John doesn't notice or excuses many of these things as eccentricities, but John has always been more perceptive than he lets on and merely decides he doesn't mind this subversive game of cat and mouse. There seems little harm in it. It doesn't interfere too much with daily living. Besides, he is secure in his sexuality and, in spite of Sherlock’s best efforts at sabotage, he manages to outplay the man enough to get a leg over with women on a fairly consistent basis.
Sherlock’s statement hung heavy in the frosty air between them. John hadn’t moved far away, their shoulders still touched, but Sherlock felt the loss of John’s warmth pressed against him keenly.
John glanced quickly about for the source of the panic, and was somewhat alarmed himself to find that Teddy’s sleek skin had parted at his crotch, allowing a rather large, pinkish erection in a perfect s- shape to curve up above the water.
Sherlock looked so hurt, that John scrambled to reassure him. “NO, love, no. Of course not. Okay, fine. We can try some of it. What the hell.”
“Forgive the intrusion,” Mycroft tipped his head “but there’s a small matter I need to discuss with you about finances. If you’ll join me in the study for a moment?”
“Bacon?” John offered Sherlock a strip from one of his plates. “I took a bit more than I can actually manage.”
John’s fingers pushed down past his waistband to close over him. It was, it was . . . John’s hot mouth trailing over him, and his hands, his lovely hands touching, caressing everywhere. Sherlock felt as if he were dissolving, scattering into unbonded atoms as surely as if a disruptor blast had hit him. He shook through his sudden release, biting back any sounds. When the earthquakes stilled, he found himself limp, half collapsed over John, still hot and straining against his hip. Sherlock sucked in a breath and dived in, letting his own fingers push clothing aside, and stroke over John’s soft, smooth skin, hot, so hot. His fingers closed over John’s hardness, and John whimpered, his hand clutching hard at Sherlock’s shoulder. In the dark, he felt John stutter, and spend, warmth spreading over his hand.  They cleaned off with a stray sock John found under his bed, giggling, trying to stay quiet.
Sherlock couldn’t thumb his phone on fast enough when an arriving message beeped in the afternoon. An anonymous text, sender blocked, appeared on the screen.
They left the bar, and found a dark spot to apparate home behind an office supply store a few doors down.  “Hold on tight,” Sherlock said extending his left arm. “This will feel a bit disorienting as a side passenger.”
Naavi was relieved to see them, and exclaimed proudly over the new equipment. It was an older model, nothing to write sonnets over, but Sherlock hoped it would do the job they needed it for.
“Of course, Felicia.”  Sherlock allowed the woman to brush a kiss by his cheek. “Thank you for inviting us.” Sherlock wasn’t a partygoer ordinarily, but he felt his puppy needed the chance to get out of the flat more often, socialize a bit.
Sherlock thought, the sound of John’s harsh breathing a counterpoint to his own. They skittered out onto the tiles of the lobby only to spot a number of rugged Afghan men gathered outside the front door, smoking and looking generally thuggish on the pavement.
“If you get any more emails or think of something new, please contact me.” Sherlock held it out between two fingers.
Sherlock ran his eyes over the few others sharing the balcony as he waited. A group of middle-aged women on an outing sat together laughing. A few young office workers lay scattered about, and a couple who must have been on their second or third date, hunched close, murmuring together. He was the only Cardassian present. It gave him a bit of a thrill when he realized nobody else here knew this . . . except John of course. John returned with a box of crispy crackers and a large fruit drink just before the lights dimmed.
They were on each other in an instant, arms wrapped tightly, breathing each other in, then sharing blazing kisses. Finally, they pulled back for a breath, arms still looped tightly around each other.
The lights flickered and then dimmed as the musicians reappeared for the second half of the show. Sherlock directed his attention to the celestial sounds, grateful for the distraction, however brief.
Sherlock finds John at their rendezvous point, and something more - perhaps a way back to a place he only half remembers.
“Is it worse to fail at something or never to attempt it in the first place?” A soft, musical voice lilted from the vicinity of the doorknocker.
“How ‘bout a kiss, then?” John whispered. Sherlock’s lips curved into a wider smile as he leaned closer. John put his elbow to the table, knocking his glass. They jumped, startled as it hit the floor, and shattered.
“Come on, lovebirds,” John called. “We need to clean up and get back to the dorms. It’s almost curfew.”
“It’s all right.” John leaned in, setting his elbows on his knees. “I won’t tell your mum anything you don’t want me to.”
“Well, next time get a med tech to help you. We don’t need people banging around in here. Also, don’t put your errand off. We have stated hours for regular pick-ups.” The man detached the data cube, thrusting it back at him.
Another thing he’d been avoiding, something he hadn’t even shared with John, was the internship he'd applied to before they'd started going out. Herr Eberhard Moser was one of the top Potion Masters in the world, and when two positions had opened up in his workshop for junior assistants, Sherlock had jumped at the chance to apply.  If he won a spot, it would be a huge opportunity to learn cutting edge potion work, but would also mean two years living abroad in Germany. Regular travel back to Britain to see John wouldn’t be impossible, but it would be a lot harder. If he didn’t get the position though, the dilemma was moot, so bringing the matter up in advance seemed rather unnecessary. Sherlock tamped it down under all the other things he’d rather not deal with right now, and opened up more space in his mind palace for cataloging how different light conditions changed John’s hair and eye colour, and the range of noises John made in bed when he used his tongue and fingers in clever ways. Still, official news was due to arrive in early June, and it niggled at the back of Sherlock's mind each morning when the mail arrived.
“Hey.” John reached out to catch them, stilling them in his own. “We don’t have to do things like anyone else. It’s just you and me.” John softened his voice. “And I missed you. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to interrupt your work, but I couldn’t stand not seeing you, not knowing . . .”
“He’s been working with New Scotland Yard. There’s a bloke he checks in with . . . Graham Lestrade or something?” Victor shrugged. “Why don’t you go see him?”
“John, it’s alright. I don’t expect you to be  . . . who you were before. We were children.” Sherlock’s voice sounded strange to his own ears. “What did we know about the world?”
Thankfully Victor agreed to ride in the back if John pulled his seat as far forward as it would go. They left the city quickly enough, soon gliding along the country lanes, the car’s headlamps illuminating a small stretch of road at a time in the vast dark. John fell into a near doze, jolting awake as Sherlock braked to turn down their drive.
