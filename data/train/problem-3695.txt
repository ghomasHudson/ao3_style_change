The wind like feathers in my hair and on my face.
"I don't know. This is only a theory that has never been proven, but it does make sense. There never were rebellions before your creation, and now it's nearly routine. There are rehabilitations every day now."
I'm standing in front of a barn door. This is where the summoning comes from, and I can distinctly hear the righteous man's voice through the walls.
"Of course they knew, Castiel," she asserts, staring at me straight in the eyes. "This is all part of their plan. The Apocalypse has been scheduled for a long time, you know."
And without further notice, he snaps his wings open and flies away too. Hester shoots me a scornful look and snatches a soul out of the air.
"You bailed out – and what? Went camping?"
"Create a diversion and interrogate the demons! Baradiel and Uriel, with me!"
"Uriel. How many years have I been here?"
to ask it."
"Yes, please save them! Susan is pregnant but hasn't told Brian yet and I was really looking forward to it!"
, and you didn't...?!"
"You don't fool me!" Siosp bursts out with rage, gesturing wildly at the fire all around. "No Creator would allow His work to be destroyed! If God existed, He would never tolerate this!"
Dean frowns and leans over to rest his elbows on his knees.
Uriel nods and slowly steps towards the door, his aura lacking its usual energy, and his wings sagging behind his back.
My future vessel, whose nose was almost touching the screen, sits up straight on his desk, stammering an explanation to his co-worker who just came back from his break with a cup of coffee in his hand.
? And who is this Mother of All?
My brothers and I have been created to be God's weapons, shaped to be warriors, while the Sisters of Fate are slender and have this look of wisdom and ingenuity. We might look similar, but I don't think they really are Angels.
"I was created about an hour earlier than you. After Anna, I am the oldest in the Garrison. Siosp was the youngest."
"Now, we wait. And we get ready to interfere unnoticed if he alters events too much."
It is strange to watch such a tiny mortal unabashedly defy my brother, who is one of the mightiest Angels in Heaven and who has rained fire and blood on so many cities over thousands of years. Once again, I can't tell if Dean is being reckless out of ignorance, or out of admirable, rare bravery. Perhaps a bit of both.
Anpiel's smile falters and her wings droop.
The infant is now out of his mother’s body and his skull is already covered in dark hair just like Abel’s was. He is wailing vigorously while his exhausted mother passes out. Anael’s wings snap open and he flies off immediately, probably to tell the Sisters the error has been successfully fixed.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Clothes…" Hester’s voice is filled with contempt. This is the first time I hear him say a word. He seems disgruntled. "Animals don’t need clothes. These Humans really are degenerated."
"Well, we didn't," I declare in a firm voice, my gaze unwavering.
"Not murders, Castiel!" He gestures irritably. "No. My work is...
And just like that, Anna is gone in a flurry of wings.
"Like Lucifer did?" I say in a severe tone. "You need to pull yourself together, Levanael. We are Warriors of God, and Lucifer’s treason is
"Because I can no longer trust you."
On this point, all my brothers nod in agreement.
and displaying utter insolence towards me.
The banishing seal is complete at my feet but Rachel holds my hands way too tightly behind my back. Suddenly an idea hits me, and I inhale sharply, staring first at Hester, before turning my head to meet Rachel's smug gaze as she breathes against my neck.
I can feel myself falling apart.
Anna slowly lowers her arms and squares her shoulders, darting her three eyes right into mine. We are hovering so high in the night sky, nearly reaching the end of the Earth's atmosphere. Seen from here, the planet looks so peaceful…
This is all very interesting, but I have no time to waste here - I still feel, as if linked by an invisible string to my Grace, the summoning that draws me in and grows stronger with every passing second.
Anna wandered into an alley with Judas. He turns to face her, compassion in his eyes shifting into puzzlement. The General's borrowed face is neutral as she stares at her target. The body she's inhabiting may be worn out by the passage of time, but it radiates raw power, even more so than in her true form.
"Cas, what's wrong?"
He is bending over his work with his wings folded behind his back, I can see his elbow moving, while his victim, tied to a chair, starts screaming. Not bothering to turn to face me, he keeps slicing into the demon's flesh and pouring holy water over the open wounds.
My breath gets stuck in my throat as I open my eyes wide. There is whispering rising up from my soldiers' ranks.
And just like it happened with the righteous man, the only thing responding to my voice is the television: the image on the screen gets scrambled. Well, at least it woke Jimmy up.
"Well... bang-up job so far. Stellar work with the witnesses. That's nice."
It was supposed to be a routine mission like the one we accomplished with Abraham or Isaac. Free a population to gain its devotion in order to instill Faith among Humans, as the new directives require. Nothing too complicated, but Pharaoh's stubborn opposition is getting in the way of Heaven's plans.
I give no reply and turn my attention to Siosp, watching him more attentively. His four arms are properly at his sides and his Grace is flowing fluidly, pure and bright, but the empty look in his eyes is terrifying.
"Forgive me, Castiel. I misjudged you. You're a good soldier."
"Now that that's settled, let's move on to the incidents you witnessed."
"I know that Lilith is on Earth and I even know exactly where," I answer flatly as I watch Zedekiel slay a demon. "Why do you think only one hundred of us are down there? We're only here to weaken the enemy by cleansing Hell of minor demons and corrupted souls that might one day attack us. It was never about finding Lilith."
"Until this is all sorted out." She turns and stares down at Jesus, her wings tensing up. "I may still need it."
this incident would put my contact with the righteous man at risk. And it would never have happened if I'd listened to Balthazar and immediately agreed to take a vessel as he suggested.
"Any question?"
Anna averts her gaze wearily.
Narrowing my eyes, I silently look at the Angels chattering as if I were not right there.
We’re wasting time here. It would be wiser to just get on with the mission regardless of what the righteous man may think of us. I will have the opportunity to explain to him later why we did this, when it's just the two of us, without Uriel to make the situation even worse.
I swallow back a sharp reply and pursue gravely: "Those seals are being broken by
I have no friends. The entire Garrison betrayed me and plotted Lucifer's return behind my back. Now I understand why all my tactics and efforts failed, why the demons won the war.
"So this is about your buddy Lucifer."
Dean raises his eyebrows high.
"I would like to meet Camael." Pmox stands up with his back to the slaughter still happening down there. His eyes have regained their cheerful glow. "I have heard so much about him - as everyone else has - and I have prayed so many times for Father to forgive him! If only I could talk to Camael..."
I walk over to Baradiel, who looks away from the statue to glance at me, his wings folded behind his back.
. Look at everything Humans have corrupted since they’ve been created! Why fight against me? I am not your enemy. I love God more than anything and I want to save Him and His creation. But watching my little brothers perish to the last and the Earth burn to ashes is too high a price to pay. Join me, and everything will go back to the way it used to be before
Levanael gives out a hollow laugh.
I clench my fists in frustration.
"How did you find out?"
Some snickering arise.
"We only ever hear about the Garrison to keep track of who's dead and who's rebelling."
"To waste our time, I guess, even though these signs won't stop us forever," says Ephra. "I would be willing to bet that we won't find anything behind that door."
"I’m positive the horse will kill her with its sweet loving, brothers," claims Rachel who just got there too.
"There are no sectors anymore."
One last moment of peace before Hell on Earth.
Siosp barks out a bitter laugh.
When Jesus smiles down at him, the serene joy lighting up his face is so much like
"More private? We're inside my head."
I raise one hand and send a wave of my Grace all around to deactivate the mechanics and scan the area for Levanael with cautious hope.
"I warned her not to spy on my true form. It can be... overwhelming to Humans, and so can my real voice. But you already knew that."
So this is it, then. I expected more from Dean. I thought I had sensed in him virtue, purity of soul and selfless compassion, in spite of what he endured and inflicted to others in Hell for four decades.
"But... Balthazar said it's impossible to resurrect him. Because he has no soul."
"… Castiel?"
I spread my wings and leave Abel’s tiny Paradise.
"I said I'm fine. We need to move on."
will?"
Is it our -
My wings are shuddering behind my back, and I quickly pull myself together. My old memories and my past attachment to my sister and superior should not interfere with my mission. I must eliminate her without hesitation, as ordered.
"Come on, you fought well, and with flair, I will give you that... but it's time to stop being such a drama queen. You have to know by now that you won't get a chance to repeat Camael's move. As for rehabilitation, well, you wouldn't be the first nor the last, no one has ever died from it, hm?"
"Great." Dean pulls a face, moving his chair to get up from table. "Now I've lost my appetite, thanks a lot."
Is Azazel killing Adam and Eve? Does he intend to harm Cain too? I have no way of warning Camael, Anael, or any of my brothers.
. It is my duty, and I will always obey my Father. That’s the very reason I exist.
I tense when Dean walks in front of me, breaking all semblance of control over myself instantly.
No answer.
"I don't know. One of our superiors, maybe, but not Him."
"Yeah. Well, why hasn't she called to tell us where she is?" Dean asks.
"Poetry against weapons and violence. For some reason I think your little pets are not going to win this one, Castiel."
Lucifer’s Grace is whirling wistfully at this sight. When he lifts a hand, the other Archangels take a step back warily.
"I know I’m not a good soldier. Contrary to what everyone may think of me, I am not so stupid as to be unaware that my former division got rid of me for this reason."
I point out this anomaly to Levanael and we share a meaningful look. The man staggers to a dark alley and starts weeping like a child.
Oh. This is much more than just a modesty issue.
"NO TALKING IN THE LIBRARY!"
that Dean had sold his soul and would go to Hell? Why didn't you tell the hierarchy? We could have saved him and spared him everything he went through in Hell!"
Zachariah is right. This has to stop.
Time seems to freeze as I tumble into these blue eyes invading my vision. My body dissolves, my wings melt behind my back, and suddenly I can't see or hear anything. There is nothing except the sensation of falling into the void.
"Our sister reached out to me as well," he says in a softer voice. "But like you, I was too late. I saw her falling to the ground and I attacked the demons, in vain. They were too fast, and I was unable to spot their weapon either."
, the Shadow had declared,
Unfortunately, since Cas was awake, that probably meant the Empty was pissed and was more than likely going to be looking for them.
"My Grace was already failing before this," Cas shrugged weakly.
This is probably cliched and a mash up of my fav and personal headcanons, but my idea with this was to write a way that we could have had Destiel and Saileen and a proper ending within the text of the show (obviously completely ignoring the actual finale though).
"Now," he started in that gruff tone of his that left no room for argument. "If you haven't given some utterly sappy, chick flick worthy speech to that angel of yours, I
"Hey," he put a hand on Jack's neck, gently making him meet Dean's eyes. "You're way too important to risk, okay? And I just want to say...I'm proud of you, kid. And I know it hasn't always seemed like it but...I love you."
With one step forward, Dean was surrounded by blackness, nothingness.
that came with being human.)
Jack could tell that there was something Dean wasn't saying...about the ritual, about Castiel's death...
Dean smiled gratefully, pulling Sam into a hug and clapping a hand on his back before letting go. "Thanks, Sammy."
"I felt like I was being ripped in two different directions," Jack muttered, sounding small, almost childlike. Sometimes Sam forgot that he was only three years old, that he was just a kid really. "I-I could feel my very atoms splitting apart."
And when they finally drifted apart with great reluctance, the noise filtering back in, Dean realized that Donna was catcalling them, and there were several people applauding, and Claire was shouting, "Fucking
"What are you doing back?" Dean asked, and Sam couldn't help but notice the slight tremble of fear in his big brother's voice. He never talked about the extent of the hold Amara had over him, but he knew it wasn't something he liked to be brought up.
Sam didn't care about 'deserve' or 'reward,' but tears sprung to his eyes as he crossed the distance to Bobby in two strides, Dean right behind him, and they both hugged their surrogate father tightly.
Sam turned over his shoulder, Eileen's dark hair just barely visible out the kitchen doorway. He knew Dean and Bobby were probably looking for a reaction, maybe a breakdown, or at least some indication that Dean could start teasing him about thinking about proposing three months into a relationship. But all he could think about was Eileen.
Sam wanted to hear.
"I was already Falling once again," he finished, and Dean didn't want to hope, but that sounded a lot like he wanted out.
"I come in peace," Amara held her hands up, a dry smile on her face, "isn't that the saying? Besides, I brought a gift."
Eileen nodded, putting a hand over Dean's, the one that was tapping out the drum beat to
Twelve years of doubts and Falling and

Enjoy!
Turning to Sam, maybe his brother would help him out, Dean opened his mouth to protest, but Sam just hit him with the deadest of expressions and shrugged. "No, he's right. You're being an idiot."
, his wings staining the asphalt, hopefully not searing themselves onto the Impala. He knew Dean would never be able to drive the car again if he had the reminder of wings on his baby.)
"I have the Enochian words Nick used," Jack added, thankful for the memory of an angel that preserved the ritual in his mind. He pulled out the napkin he had scribbled the Enochian onto and laid it next to the ingredients Rowena had set on the library table.
And Sam had to agree. Amara could run Heaven the way she always wanted, and they were so desperate for a leader now, the angels would accept her easily. Plus, he certainly trusted her more than Chuck to make some improvements. And if all else failed, Jack still had all of Chuck's powers, he just needed (deserved) some time to learn who he was before he started creating alternate universes and being all-mighty God.
"I'm sorry I can't do more," Amara said, and for a moment, she sounded genuinely apologetic. "The Empty...it's beyond my reach. And Chuck shouldn't have been able to influence it either, it was a perversion of my powers and his to raise Lucifer one last time."
"I know the last time you were human," he started talking faster, trying not to remember that time six years ago because the pain and guilt threatened to cripple him, "it-it was my fault how shitty it was, but it won't be this time...
(See the end of the chapter for

now, or whatever. God resurrected Cas before, Jack can do it now."
you, can get out."
Mary's love was for the boy that died in a fire. The one that ceased to exist the moment he ran out of their house holding his brother. But he thinks she might have started to love him again by the time she died for the second time.
Even though it killed him, Sam nodded. Because if it was the other way around, if Eileen was gone and Cas was here, there was no way in hell he would let Dean give up his happiness with Cas for Sam's.
But, then he remembered he had taken Eileen's phone from her driveway, the shattered reminder of one more woman he loved that he couldn't save.
It was the first time they had said it to each other, and Sam didn't hesitate to sign his love right back. This was real.
Even the Apocalypse World hunters were going to be stopping by in an hour or so.
And when Sam smiles again, it's a genuine one and he finally accepts that maybe they
"Can it, ya idjit," Bobby retorted. "I'm serious. What the hell are you waiting for?"
"She found it," Sam breathed, signing the words as he did, a worried but hopeful look on his face. "Or she...
Sorry for the long, A/N, I hope you enjoy!
Sam took a deep breath, giving Eileen a soft kiss as he sat down, slinging an arm around her shoulders. They were already so domestic it would be sickening if Dean wasn't so glad his brother had finally found the happiness and balance he had been searching for for so long.
"Shit, Bobby, you've turned into a right Nora Ephron," Dean joked fondly, 'cause that was what he did when something hit too close to home.
Anyway, feel free to comment and kudos if you enjoyed, I love reading any and all comments (even if they're just rants about 15x20).
"No..." Sam trailed off, his phone starting to ring. "Give me a sec, this is Rowena." He got up and wandered out of earshot.
"Chuck absorbed me and my powers into himself," Amara explained. "So, when Jack took Chuck's powers, my...essence I guess you could call it, was transferred too. And although he's strong, a Nephilim even, the Darkness and the Light warred within him."
So, when Eileen pulled him towards the main room, he went willingly, leaving Rowena and Jack to watch the portal for any developments.
He stepped back reluctantly, but not completely, since he left one hand on Cas's shoulder before letting it drop. "Look," he started, talking quickly, "we don't have a lot of time, but...we can get you out if you want. But," he winced internally at this next part, knowing it would hurt Cas, "your Grace has to stay here. It'll trick the Empty into thinking you're still here, but you,
Jack was sitting across from her at the library table, nearly motionless and clearly deep in thought. Castiel meant a lot to him obviously, but so did Dean—Sam had said that the three of them were practically Jack's fathers at this point.
Eileen watched the black, oozing portal in the middle of the library, the faint vibrations of Sam's pacing feet keeping her aware of his position even when she couldn't see him.
He saw Cas's face fall, and his stomach sank down to somewhere around his knees, wondering if he wanted to stay. After all, he would just be a lowly ape without his Grace, shackled to a forty-one year old borderline functional alcoholic who had no reason to deserve a literal angel.
#TheirLoveWasReal
"Thanks," Dean shot back, his lips curled in disgust, "feel free to leave now."
(He might have to start learning though, if Cas agreed to the plan. They would have to leave his Grace behind, and he tried not to think about the implications.)
Jack looked stunned, tears welling in his big blue eyes (eyes that were so reminiscent of Cas's it was hard to remember that he wasn't actually Cas's biological son) as he threw his arms around Dean. "I love you too, Dad."
"Yeah, well, if you step outta' line, we got an overpowered Nephilim to keep you in check," Dean retorted, crossing his arms and nodding at Jack with a smirk.
Thank you so much to everyone for reading! There's one more chapter that I will hopefully have up by later tonight.
Jess burned, Sarah died, Madison died, Amelia left...but Eileen
"I missed ya, ya idjits," Bobby muttered fondly, gripping the back of Sam's flannel with one hand and cupping the back of Dean's head with the other.
The tires of the Impala crunched over the sand and pebbles as Dean drove away from the abandoned strip of beach, Chuck's pleas and whining fading as they sped down the dirt path towards the town.
And he realized that he was close to losing Cas again, because, somehow, Dean's need to be useful in order to keep those he loves close has spread to Cas. And he doesn't know if he knows how to say, "
Here is a quick prologue to fix the end of Inherit the Earth and to better tie into my fix-it for the finale.
"It's
"See you soon, bitch," he smirked, giving Sam a two-finger salute.
. "You held out for a long time, but I needed my freedom."
Looking over at Sam, Eileen couldn't help but feel a little selfish, hoping that she wouldn't have to let Sam jump into the portal after his brother and best friend. It seemed like they had just found a rhythm after losing so much time (dying really put a damper on the possibility of a relationship) and she didn't want to lose it.
The Righteous Man.
It was like a physical blow, the idea that Jess was asking after him in Heaven.
Also, there is no way Dean would not totally ship Saileen, come on! And I brought back Rowena b/c she was just the most fun and Gabe/Rowena is one of my niche ships.
anymore, just some washed up writer—writhe pathetically on the ground. He let out a deep breath. It was finally over. No more apocalypses (yes, plural, Sam hates his life sometimes), no story or script to follow, just...life.
Doesn't Dean know it. He doesn't think there's one aspect of his relationship-not a relationship with Cas he hasn't fucked up to Hell and back (sometimes literally), but somehow they're still orbiting around each other—seemingly always waiting for the other one to make the first move.
"Sam Winchester," Eileen interrupted, one eyebrow raised and a gorgeous, mischievous twinkle in her eye, her hands effortlessly forming the words. "Are you asking me to move into my house?"
Sam put the safety back on his gun, but Eileen kept hers trained on the Darkness, only relaxing slightly when he put a gentle hand on her shoulder. Although his grip tightened and he heard Dean suck in a breath as Bobby—and not Apocalypse Bobby, but the man who had been more of a father to Sam than John Winchester—stepped out from behind Amara.
Castiel opened his eyes, and what a battle it was to do so, and he wasn't even sure that they
So many memories, regrets layering over each other. Michael, Lucifer. Hell, Heaven, Purgatory. Sam, Jack, Bobby, Ellen, Pamela Barnes. Dean Dean Dean.
Thank you again for reading!
"It's not that simple," Amara said, since Jack was silent, looking terrified and shell-shocked.
Their lips slid gently over each other for the briefest of moments before Eileen pulled back. Keeping her forehead resting against his, although she made sure he could see her hands, she pulled her fingers into an undeniable sign.
"Something's happening," Jack replied, as if that wasn't the
But Cas just smiled, "Every time I Fell, it was because I loved humanity more than I loved Heaven. I don't regret Falling, I never did. I...I regretted not being able to help you."
what peace feels like.
And, yes, there's a ring he bought in 2005 for another woman sitting heavy in his pocket, but he's starting to think it always belonged to Eileen. He just hadn't known it then.
But when Dean spoke, his voice was shaking, and green eyes filled with tears. "Stay. Cas...please...just, stay."
Sam sighed, looking crestfallen, Eileen's hand curving around his bicep. "I can look, but..."
. "I just...we lost so much time, Eileen, and..."
An apple pie life or hunting. A girl or his brother.
As promised, here is the final chapter of my 15x20 fix it!! This is probably the fluffiest thing I've ever written, but I also love it (and I'm not usually a fluff-kind of girl or writer).
Donna and Jody were sharing a kiss, much to the exaggerated chagrin of their wayward daughters. Kaia and Claire were arm-in-arm, laughing as Patience and Alex taught Jack the basics of poker.
on the table top. He grinned thinly, appreciating the gesture nonetheless, because they had all been working around the clock, trying to find ways into the Empty. Eileen had called in her hunter contacts in Ireland to help with the research and was keeping Sam from feeding off of Dean's paranoia and spiraling.
Dean ruffled the kid's hair as he released him, "I'm gonna' bring your other dad back too, no matter what."
This was my attempt at an ending to the show that still focuses on the Sam & Dean relationship but with the core themes of found family and actually paying off the amazingness that was Saileen and the freaking once-in-a-lifetime-will-never-happen-again-ness that was Destiel. (Because I wanted to scream "it's about balance!" at my laptop for like, the entire last couple episodes.) So please feel free to leave a kudos or review to tell me how I did!
He turns and Cas is by his side, and he can't resist, so he bends down and kisses him again. Just a quick peck really, just because he can.
"Team Free Will 3.0, baby!" Dean clapped his hands as they drove off towards the bunker.
With all their focus on summoning the Empty, Team Free Will 3.0 finds themselves facing the reality that they might have one more miracle left in the cards.
The kiss was firm (they had wasted so much time not doing this), his tongue sliding along the seam of Cas's lips, pulling back before they started full-on making out in front of their friends and family. (Family which included their son and their kinda-daughter.) But Cas just hummed in appreciation, pulling Dean closer, his hand never moving from his shoulder though, until there was barely any space left.
It had been months since that day in the dungeon and Dean wasn't sure he was ever going to get to do this again. To do something as simple as hug his angel. And he could live in this moment forever.
Castiel nodded, sure of his choice in a way that he hadn't been sure of anything since he marched into Hell to find the Righteous Man. But, for the briefest of moments, where Dean didn't speak, he realized that they had been talking for quite some time, and the Empty should be close. And, for all he knew of Dean and his soul, he was unsure of what he was going to say.
"Very well," Amara inclined her head before vanishing into thin air.
"Heaven could use some work," Dean supplied, shifting on his feet when all three turned to him. "What? She's just as powerful as Chuck and you heard C...you know Heaven's all screwed up. She deserves a chance to use her power for good."
"You'll stay?" Dean finished, his eyes pleading and desperate. The unspoken 'you'll still love me,' 'you won't resent me for causing you to Fall' echoing in the Empty.
(Dean knew he wasn't blameless in making Cas believe that he only called him, only wanted him around, when he was useful to him, and sometimes he didn't know if he was going to be able to fix that.)
"Yes, it's so insane to try and keep healthy and in shape now that we're not fighting for our lives every day," Sam snarked with a good-natured roll of his eyes.
(Castiel had been one of those people, had left Dean Winchester broken and hurting in this way.)
? Because, yeah, Jody and Donna were definitely into each other, they had the whole, "
Sam shook his head and rolled his eyes, because he wasn't "past his prime" quite yet, and he knew that trying to get Dean to stop minimizing his worth was useless. Plus, when he tried to brush off big emotional moments with sarcasm, he was really trying to say the exact opposite.
Sam practically snorted his beer out his nose and Dean wanted to drown himself in his whiskey.
" bitchfaces, wanting to rub a hand down his face in frustration, but he couldn't help the smile that came to his face just at the thought of Eileen.
"Yes," Dean ground out, his face stony but Jack thought his eyes looked bright, almost like he was about to cry, and he let go of the jacket reluctantly.
Before he allowed himself time to second-guess what he was doing, he strode over to Cas, taking his hand and turning the other man towards him. Lifting a shaky hand to Cas's cheek, brushing over the stubble there, his fingers tingling, Cas's own hand came to fit on his shoulder (right over where his handprint was burned into Dean's soul).
"I won't be able to help you anymore," Cas muttered quietly. And although his tone was despondent, Dean detected the hope in his eyes, that maybe that wouldn't matter.
See you in the next chapter!
Because he had always wanted to marry, to have his own family, his own life, but doing so with Amelia, or even with Jess, would have been all or nothing.
And she understood the hunting life, hell, she would probably hunt for longer than Sam would, but more than that, she understood
Holding out his hand, Dean didn't even blink as Rowena used a dagger to cut a neat line in the center of Dean's palm. Once his blood dripped on top of his jacket, right on top of Cas's handprint, the one that so matched the burn on his shoulder (the burn itself had faded, but sometimes Dean could still feel the imprint there, like his very soul was branded), Jack stepped up, healing his hand easily.
"Fuck, I love when you do that," he muttered, using both hands to cup Cas's cheeks and bring him forward.
However, their moment didn't last very long because Jack was shouting, "Guys?" in a worried tone of voice and Rowena was calling for "Samuel."
Jack ducked his head, wishing there was more he could do to help the Winchesters, to help Castiel. Even with all these powers, he was still useless, just a child who couldn't do anything.
"The Darkness and the Light weren't ever meant to be combined again after my brother and I split apart eons ago," Amara assured him gently, almost
Eileen came back.
And, of course, in a room full of hunters, even off-duty ones, they soon had half a dozen guns and at least two angel blades pointed at them.
lo—" (
(He remembered falling to his knees in a dark crypt, talking around the blood in his mouth, his arm broken, an angel blade hovering over his face, wondering if he said, "I love you" because it's easier than saying "I love you.")
"This is Castiel's blood?" Rowena confirmed, taking the jacket from Dean's hands.
He took her hand, and for a minute, nothing happened. But then Amara's eyes turned dark and Jack's flashed that golden color of his Grace, the two almost glowing with power.
(And of course it didn't.)
"We'll find another way," Sam promised, and Dean's face hardened, but he dropped the subject. And Sam really doesn't want to think about what he's going to do to himself when they get back to the bunker. (His brother doesn't have the best coping mechanisms in the best of circumstances, never mind when he lost his angel.)
Jack looked at Rowena nervously, still trying to wake up. He had been practicing controlling whatever God-powers he had, seeing if he could wake Cas again like he did the first time Cas went to the Empty, but he had no way to tell if it was working or not. And by the time he had become exhausted, practically fainting on his bed, it was well past three in the morning.
Sam had even talked about turning the bunker into a kind of headquarters, building up the Men of Letters again to work with the hunter network he had started with the Apocalypse World survivors. Although this time they would be working together and on both sides of the Atlantic.
Jolting upright, Dean jerked awake. "I'm up, I'm up," he grumbled blearily, wiping at his eyes. It took a minute to orient himself, but he recognized the shelves of the bunker's library, and there was a laptop with a dark screen in front of him.
The glossy, perfect image of Heaven had been shattered a long time ago (twelve years to be exact) and, even if he wanted back in, they would never accept him again. His brothers and sisters called him the second Lucifer, the Fallen One, and he didn't like thinking about how apt that moniker was sometimes.

"What are you talking about?" Sam shook his head, grateful that Eileen had ushered Jack and Rowena towards the map table so they wouldn't hear what the brothers were talking about. "You don't have to do this alone. Cas is my friend too, so let me come with you."
"What does Eileen have to do about any of this?" Sam asked, even if he did agree.
"Dean..." Sam sighed, but Dean cut him off before he could start in on his near-daily, 'we'll find something if we just look hard enough' speech.
Sam's love was constant, but he still left. And maybe Dean was just starting to realize that Sam didn't leave him because he didn't
And when Cas tried to shake his hand, only to be pulled into a brief hug, Bobby whispering something in the other man's ear that made him turn red, and then Dean was the one making absolute heart-eyes at Cas. But then, Bobby met Jack and told him that he was probably the closest he's got to a grandchild at the moment (a not-so-subtle glance thrown in Sam's direction) and there wasn't a dry eye in the place as the two embraced.
" he couldn't help but remember.)
"Is that really...?" Dean asked, and he looked like he was swaying on his feet, Cas putting a hand on his arm to steady him.
Rowena chanted in Enochian behind him, Sammy's voice had been shaking too much to get the words out and Dean still couldn't read the damn language.
(Because it sometimes still felt like he was too separate from humanity. That he didn't know if he belonged, but if Dean asked him to stay, he would stay for as long as he could.)
See you in the next chapter!
"Look," Bobby sighed, looking at Dean with the kind of stare that reminded him that Bobby had seen him at some pretty low points, but had also taken him to play catch up in the park when he was a kid and supposed to be practicing his shooting. It was the look of a father. "Your daddy...he put a hell of a lot on you that you didn't deserve when you were young. But the fight's over now...you can have something good."
"Fall asleep researching again?" Sam asked, sitting down across from him, offering a plate of eggs and what Dean hoped was real bacon instead of the truly awful vegan crap Sam insisted on buying.
And as he pressed a kiss to Eileen's forehead, he couldn't help but wonder and hope that their family was going to expand once again someday soon.
Sam just clapped Dean and Cas on the back, beaming from ear-to-ear and Jack was dancing around with Alex, the two of them holding one of Garth's kids between them.
" expression, and Bobby commiserating right back.
It was like heat and fire was radiating in waves from Jack, and Sam had to throw an arm over his eyes to keep from being blinded.
"Make sure Donna goes to Jody and the girls," Dean offered out of the blue, and Sam turned to his brother in total confusion. "What?" He shrugged casually. "Those two need to get together like yesterday...they've been waiting long enough already."
—because no matter what Dean tried to tell himself, Jack was their kid, his and Dean's and Cas's—fought God and

But once they were alone, Sam didn't know what to say. There was just
He had stopped carrying the ring in his pocket when Jess burned, but he kept it. Tucked it away in a box of forgotten memories. But he had found it again last night, hidden under a flyer for the retirement home where he had first met Eileen. (And he didn't believe in fate or destiny anymore, but that was one hell of a coincidence.)
The room was dead silent as the flame in front of Rowena flickered out, and her eyes flashed with purple fire as she chanted something in Latin. Jack barely heard it, he was staring so intently at the portal. And as it began to shrink, it was like the world held its breath before two figures burst out, crashing into a table and rolling onto the floor.
Dean and Cas had to come back. They had to.
" only to get hushed by Jody for the bad language (but then Kaia was kissing her to make up for it).
"I'll be right back," Dean muttered, is face shuttered as he practically ran from the room, his entire body tense.
Because Sam could think of two people who had been waiting to get together for longer than Jody and Donna. And their names started with a "De" and ended in "stiel."
Max and Alicia Banes were looking at Rowena with bright eyes, clearly soaking up some of the elder witch's vast knowledge.
(In his mind, he imagines Cas right next to him, Jack having a little Sammy on his lap, as Cas teaches the kids about bees, using words they won't understand for another ten years and will leave Dean scratching his head as to their meaning, but it'll make Cas so excited that Dean will be happy just being there with him.)
Garth and Bess were watching Little Sam and Little Cas, Jesse and Cesar Cuevas absolutely doting on the toddlers, wide smiles on all six faces.
"Never thought you'd hear yourself say that, huh?" Dean quipped, taking the plate to hide from Sam's annoyingly knowing expression. Because not even three days ago, his little bro had found him passed out in the library using a half-filled bottle of whiskey as a pillow, and he had woken up with a hangover headache instead of a stress-induced one.
Before the car was even stopped, Jack was pushing the door open and falling to his hands and knees in the grass.
Chuck had said that Dean's Cas was the only one who Fell after pulling him from Hell.
For the next half hour, it was a whirlwind of introducing Bobby to their new friends, and old friends' new partners (like Bess and Donna). Although, it was amazing to watch as Donna just hugged Bobby tightly, the old grouch looking completely unsure of what to do, Jody smiling fondly at her old friend, her eyes shining with affection for the blonde sheriff.
"Wonderful job, dearie," Rowena said, turning to look at Dean. "But we still need the angel's blood and the blood of whomever is going to the Empty."
And he knows Dean's soul, but more than that, he knows the man, and that sometimes "I need you," really means "I love you." Because Dean has loved people who didn't need him and when they left, or he was forced to leave, it broke him.
(It was a long shot, but maybe Jack could fix it if he was the one to bring Castiel back.)
"It was never a question of want." Castiel chose his words carefully, making sure he didn't word this in a way that put too much pressure or guilt on Dean. (But Castiel just needs to hear that he is wanted instead of simply needed, because "need" is the only love he thinks he can accept sometimes.) "If you asked..."
Looking around, Dean can't help but think that this is what peace must feel like.
Bobby just smirked fondly and continued, "Said that she loves you, but if you don't give that ring in your pocket to Eileen soon, she'll come down from Heaven to haunt your ass. That's a direct quote, by the way."
(Falling was always how he saw his story ending anyways. One last Fall, the one that mattered, the one that stuck, that was a choice.)
"We'll get Gabriel back," Sam promised, and Jack hoped he wasn't lying, that there were a few more miracles left for them. He wanted to get to know his Uncle Gabe, he seemed fun. "We have the spell now, we'll find something of his, and we'll get him back...Crowley too."
, I mean." He started talking too, wondering if he had signed a word incorrectly and maybe just asked her to move to the moon or something ridiculous. "But, maybe close by, and it's totally okay if you say no," he knew he was rambling, but now he couldn't just...
Dean flinched again, this time more obviously, almost a full-body convulsion. Sam had felt that terrifying hope that had bubbled in his chest when they heard Cas's voice over Dean's phone. And he knew it would have been so much worse for Dean when he sprinted up the stairs and only saw Lucifer's smug face behind the door. (What with the "profound bond" and all that. They were in love, simple as that, and it was obvious to anyone with eyes.) Sam still remembered Jess's face turning into Lucifer's all those years ago, the shudder of hopelessness that went through him.
"Two past their prime hunters, a Nephilim, and a twice-resurrected badass are going to save an angel from damnation." Dean shook his head, leveling Sam with a raised eyebrow and a smirk. "That is, if Eileen still wants your gigantic mug around."
every time he looks at Dean.
"Come on, don't you want to say hello to your Auntie Rowena?" She purred with a smirk, opening her arms wide.
Sam stopped and it felt like the air had been sucked out of the room, Rowena ducking her head to study the flickering flame in front of her. They all knew the answer to his question, Eileen was even willing to bet Jack himself knew, but no one wanted to say it out loud.
Dean and Cas were talking closely together like they usually did, but there's something different about it now. Dean doesn't stop himself from reaching out to Cas, and Cas is letting himself positively
He was in the Empty.
Castiel was vaguely aware that he wasn't "awake," but that didn't mean he was just existing in some black nothingness for the rest of eternity.
"You're a Winchester," Dean stressed. "You and Jack, and..." But he couldn't finish the sentence, realizing he fell back on the family argument because that was the only kind of love that had stayed with him.
"I love you, Dean," Cas says, and he almost sighs with relief when the Empty doesn't come for him, his smile bright and Dean doesn't think he's ever seen Cas smile as much as he has since Dean pulled him from the Empty. Fuck, if he doesn't look absolutely gorgeous when he smiles, blue eyes glowing even though he no longer has his Grace.
Dean, but because he loved himself. And Sam needed to share that big heart of his with those like Eileen who deserved it.
), but his face immediately fell, his heart slamming against his ribs.
, a soulless Nephilim who used the second chance from Castiel's deal to kill his mother.)
"Dean," Sam tried to interject, but his brother just turned to him, his eyes wide and watery in a way Sam hadn't seen in years.
But, fuck, he wanted to kiss Cas.
"I wish you'd let me go, Dad," Jack murmured. Dean wasn't even sure the kid knew that he was talking aloud because that '
He signed, pointing to the plate in front of him.
"Yeah, I guess we need to go pick her up, fill everyone in," Sam sighed, mentally starting a list of all the phone calls he was going to have to make.
he was right about Dad. But if that was true, why had it taken Dean so long to accept it? Trying as hard as he was to stop listening to John's voice in his head.
(He still remembered Dean's shouted words when he was trying to turn himself into a bomb. That they should let Jack do it because he wasn't family...not like Cas was. And if the Winchesters had taught him anything, it was that family deserved to be together.)
Jack flushed, lowering the hand he had extended for her to cut as Rowena and Eileen shared exasperated looks.
(He tried not to think about how many times they had seen angels burning up from the inside, their Grace coming out of their eyes and mouths, wings burning onto whatever surface they landed.)
Sam and Dean both nodded, and Dean knows that neither of them have any plans for kicking the can anytime soon. In fact, they're both looking forward to the exact opposite.
The next two chapters should be up tomorrow night!
He wanted to grab him by that stupid trench coat that had become synonymous with Cas and kiss him until they both forgot their hang ups. (Dean definitely had Cas beat in that department, but the other man wasn't without his idiosyncrasies. And it always felt like Dean was just one step behind, faltering and stumbling where he should be confident.)
Dean crushed the swell of hope that made its way into his traitorous chest. She was probably just checking in, no way she actually found the spell. Jack had remembered a lot of the Enochian that was said, but they still had no idea on the ingredients Nick had used to summon the Empty. All they knew was they needed Cas's blood. (And every time someone mentioned that particular fact, Dean tried not to think about the jacket he had stuffed in the back of his closet and had refused to wash or even touch in the past few weeks.)
I wriggle up from the couch and stand up, wings spread, feeling my Grace freezing in my veins.
"Helloooooo!" one of them trumpets in a high-pitched voice.
"Is Alastair one of the first demons created by Lucifer, like Lilith?"
"Demons." Zedekiel narrows his eyes. "Great. Just what we needed."
I take one last look at the righteous man who is trying to get a vehicle to start.
"Shush. That's an order. You know what, go and tell him
I vividly remember the promise Anna made to Yaël. A promise is a sacred commitment, and a promise made by an Angel implicates all of Heaven.
"You’re lying," I hiss. "The righteous man did not break."
Billowing steam rises from my mouth as I exhale, and I focus all my senses, allowing my Grace to vibrate with the Earth and the air. Limitations fade as my wings stretch to their widest span behind my back. I can feel the flow power of the Bighorn River, water moving forth and defying the freezing cold. I can feel every life form and the energy they radiate. 1847 souls, and an infinite number of animals and insects numbed by the winter cold.
"Aww, you poor thing. Do you want me to carry you? We're about to take a dozen leaps in time to gain your meat suit's trust, and I wouldn't want you to die on me. Surely they won't like it upstairs and they will probably say it's my fault again - oddly enough, that's what the hierarchy assumes every time there's something fishy."
My statement brings about a tense silence during which I look at Rgoan, his chiselled and tanned face frozen in an expression of resentment. His hair and beard are so blond they almost look white. He's leaning against a wall, holding under his arm an entire box filled with pastries and cakes. He is slowly, darkly chewing.
I can feel my eyebrows furrowing as I unfold my ethereal wings behind my back, and with just a beat, I’m now standing on the glass surface. On the ground and at human scale, the thick glass stretches as far as the eye can see, radiating heat and reflecting the sun's brightness. If only this burned Grace could tell me what happened...
My voice rumbles in my vessel's flesh, in my throat and rib cage - so different from my real voice, hoarse, and so
Without any last glance for the burning house, we all fly away to hunt down our own General.
"You had to do this alone, Dean."
"Oh, just a friendly advice: take Balthazar with you to talk to our precious Apocalypse trigger man. Humans are so delicate, it would be a shame to damage our brand new savior, don't you think?"
"Rzionr Nrzfm has got a point," Rachel points out. "Camael put himself in this situation by prioritizing a Human – worse, a
I look over and meet Hester's eyes. This is a double look, for he - or should I say
His eyes are staring down at his handwork and I can see his eyelashes shivering. Even if his cheeks are red, he's frowning with intense focus just like if he was ganking a demon. And just when he tilts his head to suck at the skin under my ear, everything turns white and orgasm crashes on me – violently, jerkily. I hear myself moan loudly, but I don't give a fuck. It's too fucking
Anael stares down unblinkingly at the naked and distraught Humans, and I see his Grace shriveling.
Anael withdraws his hands and squares his shoulders into a proper General of the Garrison’s bearing.
His aura is pulsating with irritation while Dean mimics a thank you with a fake smile. The insolence he's displaying is only making the situation worse. Again, I can't let Uriel and Dean interact without worrying that they will throw themselves at each other's throats - and Dean is merely a Human. He's no match for an Angel, let alone one as powerful as Uriel.
"Enhanced speed and power, better senses and perception, effortless telekinesis, and the ability to use every seals and spells involving human blood or soul. Moreover, if my calculations are correct, possessing a Human allows us to smite a demon with a single touch, whereas in our true form we can only hurt them or send them back to Hell. To actually kill them off, we’d have to display a massive amount of destructive energy, which is quite draining. Or just use our blade, but you’d agree the size difference is not very practical. A vessel makes it possible to channel our energy, control and use it in an optimal manner. Not to mention the other perks: walking among the Humans without turning them deaf or blind. See, a human vessel such as Cain is like a very sophisticated armor. Humans are made to be our armors. Ideally, in the future we will all have our very own Human to possess."
"You do remember him?" he smiles. The kind of devotion in his eyes should only be for God. He walks slowly past me, his gaze distant and wistful. "How strong he was? How beautiful?"
"I see," Anael snaps back. "Well, explain to the Human that copulating won't be regarded as a sin, considering we need him to have a progeny that will be very important in the future according to the Sisters. If he doesn't cooperate we will have to send low-ranked Cherubs to make him fall in love with the next suitable woman to cross his path."
The oversized room fills with the silky rustling of wings nervously brushing against each other as we glance at each other.
Only when the demon's whimpers and cries rise again do I realize the mistake I just made, the leverage I just handed to the rebel: by letting her know that Uriel is in charge of taking orders instead of me, I just informed her that I have been downgraded. How uncertain my position is in the hierarchy. She now knows that I have committed a crime serious enough to deserve such a sanction.
Zedekiel greets him with a hand wave, but the new soldier turns his head away with an irritated swirl in his Grace.
Balthazar stands up as well and gazes at me with fond pity.
"I can help you with that."
"The Winchesters are Father's chosen ones, not primates. You should stop calling them that."
What he is asking for makes no sense at all. Why should kindness spare some people from death? A good person should be granted eternity, then, according to this logic? All Humans eventually die to get to Heaven or Hell.
I can hear in his voice the echoes of Camael's last words to me, and it stirs up a combination of longing and fascination in me. Dean may have lived only a few decades and broken the first seal that pushed the world into chaos, but there is wisdom in him, in a way I can't quite fathom. Everything seems so simple and clear when he voices his views on a situation.
fail our mission. Orders are orders.
"Well, how does it feel to give orders?"
"We’re stuck down here for a few hours or so." Balthazar gazes up at the starry night. "We might as well use the time to get some rest, don't you think? I have to admit, this little Apocalypse tired me out."
With such fury that his aura pulses through the entire room, Uriel snaps his wings open.
A clear voice rises behind me, and I gaze one last time at the ethereal sight of the night sky before turning around. Claire, the vessel Balthazar intended for me, is standing there. The soul trapped in my borrowed body grows agitated at the sound of this voice - the voice of my perfect vessel that I will surely invest someday. I tilt my head to the side, struck by the surreal vision of a Human nearly reaching my height. All my life, I have looked down to watch tiny beings crawling on the ground, and never before have I grasped the nuanced range of feelings that their eyes, their faces, their body language can convey. If I look closely, I can even make out each of her blond eyelashes and the texture of her velvety skin. But even more surprisingly...
I nod at my superior officer.
"Why did they send me to this division filled with losers infected with free will and emotions!" he rages, violently punching him in the face. "I don't belong here, I'm a good soldier!"
He shuts me up by kissing me again open-mouthed, with so much passion it hurts. Stunned, I groan to protest. Woah,
I clench my fists, my wings twitching.
"In response to the recent events, we have new orders. We did lock away a few demons, but Lucifer created a lot more of them and even the Horsemen rallied behind him."
"Levanael, you can go back to your initial mission. Baradiel, make sure that Alastair is properly restrained in the trap. Don't say anything to Uriel or to the hierarchy, I want to inform them personally!"
"Then...
"I won’t take a vessel. And that is final."
"We've been friends for a long time, Uriel." I slowly step closer. "Fought by each other's sides, served together away from home, for what seems like...
Since Abel passed away, Eve comes every day to mourn at his graveside. She has stopped praying to God and Angels. As for Adam, he remains prostrate with grief in his silent house all day long. And Cain...
Hester is crouching, staring intently at something on the ground when I land at his side. He throws a glance at me and stands up to grab a soul. Somehow, I am quite certain he hasn’t done any resurrecting work while I was away.
asks his younger brother in a reproachful tone.
I could shield out the rain with my aura, but I don't bother. Not when I know what I'm about to find. Not when one more burning failure robs me of my best ally in the Garrison, my most loyal sister.
"I can speak freely here. In Hell, the celestial channels are cut off and none of our superiors can spy on us. Listen to me carefully. You've been told that the Council has cleared you of all suspicion, but I know for a fact that this isn't true. Zachariah is watching you more than ever, especially whenever you're talking to Dean Winchester. He spies on your conversations and archives them, Castiel, and you'll be sent to rehabilitation if you ever say anything that shows you have...
"I know we all screwed up with Uriel. I know I acted like a coward when he threatened me. He was stronger than me, and this is going to sound silly... but I just didn't want to die. I never thought... that
Anael doesn’t look convinced. I’m not quite sure myself what’s so exceptional about that couple and their many children. Plain, ordinary Humans like any others. They don’t look different at all.
"You got to be kidding me," Dean and Chuck blurt out as one.
How could I ever begin to explain?
I didn't realize I had stood up. The silence is deafening as I slowly sit back down.
Levanael frowns thoughtfully.
"What are you doing here?" I finally say in a murmur, keeping my eyes fixed on the kite.
The demon seems completely unimpressed.
Rachel’s wings are twitching in exasperation.
Uriel seems to regard the topic as closed, for he turns around and stares intently at the door.
And it will remain so until Lucifer is back into his cage."
I need to keep them distracted with words until an Archangel comes to our defense. Because from a strictly strategic perspective, we stand no chance of defeating a hundred hostile Angels when there are only five of us.
The two Humans take a slow step back and Adam wraps his arms around Eve as if to protect her.
Obviously misinterpreting my reluctance, my sister turns on her heels and strides away.
I can see in her eyes the exact moment Anna realizes she's failed.
"Gabriel?" Anna inquires as she gets up on my shoulder. "What is the matter?"
. Reapers have never had names, so for obvious practical purposes, we've assigned ourselves some at our own initiative. I have more than a dozen names myself, even though I like Tessa better. So, are you going to help us or not?"
And suddenly, with a surprisingly silent explosion - as if we were immersed in the depths of the ocean - the sphere splits into two comets that fall separately towards the Earth.
similar to the one Cas was currently wearing along with a fluffy pair of white wings for effect and another in a brown leather jacket and a blond wig. They were holding each others hands and then leaned in to kiss.
“Well that seems to be obvious.” Cas shrugged.
The two walked side by side to the “Dean Cave” and sat in their respective recliners - Cas on the right and Dean on the left. The popcorn and drinks were placed on the little stand in between the two chairs.
“It’s beautiful,” Cas murmured, and Dean knew those were the only words he needed to hear. Cas approved of the beautiful place he thought he would appreciate. Then, before the scene shifted, Cas pulled on Dean’s arm and gathered him in a hug. At first, Dean was shocked and unable to do anything, but then he melted into the arms of the angel in front of him. “Thank you.”
Dean turned to Cas, “Does this mean you can feel human emotions?”
The bright room began to transform to a dark theatre filled with hundreds of seats, some of which Dean and Cas ended up seated in. They looked onto a set that had a fake Impala on it and Dean seemed to be discussing something with a girl.
It would all be much more enjoyable if Cas could stop his mind from wandering back to the mixtape burning a hole in his pocket. Sam had asked earlier if he had given it to him and he shushed him explaining his plan. He wasn’t sure how Dean was going to react and dreaded the actual process of giving it to him.
Sam cleared his throat, before beginning to read aloud, “O inania
They stood in front of it, squeezed each other’s hands tight, then Dean reached out and turned the knob.
Dean had not slept in a week.
Cas flattened it on the table between them. “I know Dean really enjoys Taylor Swift, so I decided to make him ‘Cas’ Top 13 TSwift Traxx.’” Cas once more made air quotes.
Cas looked over at Sam, “Did you have any suggestions?”
Dean ran up and slashed its torso with his knife, letting it bend over in pain for a moment as they tried to figure out an alternative.
Dean held it out. “I wanted to give this to you.”
The battle was over as suddenly as it had begun. Despite Gordon’s extra vampire strength, he was no match for Cas and his millenia of experience. Cas’ blade sliced through the air, chopping off Gordon’s head in one clean slice. His body froze and then fell to the ground, meeting it the same time as his head beside it.
The two walked forward, hands still entwined, ready to face whatever was on the other side of the door. Together.
Sam nodded. “It’s a spell to summon the Empty. We’d have to be very careful about how we bargain with it, but I think if we help it fall back asleep we could exchange that for Cas.”
Dean didn’t know what to say besides, “Thank you.”
Dean knelt by his body, his eyes wandering around and landing on the sky above unsure of what he could do to fix this. There was no way to get Cas back. This seemed permanent.
A few tears escaped his eyes as they hugged in the meadow with ashes swirling around them. The happiness of their visit now mixed with the pain of the past.
Cas nodded. “Unfortunately I didn’t rely on that back then.”
“Like me having feelings for you?” Cas cocked his head.
The memory changed again, showing the group discussing a strategy for how to take down Lucifer. Cas told Dean “I like past you” and Dean now caught how the future version of him jealously eyed him.
Dean squeezed Cas’ hand and they smiled at each other while the colors around them shifted like a hurricane with them in the eye.
There still seemed to be someone beside him, and Dean hoped desperately that it would be Cas as the wind whisked by him. He didn’t know where the bottom of this tunnel was, but he hoped it wouldn’t be soon otherwise he was screwed. How was he going to get out of falling hundreds of feet?
Dean stared at Castiel lying still on the ground, still hardly believing he was-.
Sam thought for a moment. “I don’t think he’ll admit it, but I think he’ll love that one.”
“Yes, and I regretted it only a little later, but I was too far in. I needed Purgatory,” Cas said.
The next day, Sam planned a dinner for their small, found family. Eileen helped Sam cook as Dean and Cas played with Miracle. Once the food was ready, they sat around the table and thought about all those they had lost along the way to get to this perfect moment.
Dean felt the muscles in Cas’ chest trembling slightly from the weird angle they were on, almost parallel to the ground. Cas’ wings extended and flapped once pushing them upright.
Dean walked to the center of the meadow. It was perfect.
“I won’t hurt Dean,” Cas forced out. Dean could tell he was having a hard time, that something in Naomi was controlling him.
Once more their world turned upside down and they were once again in a Gas N’ Sip. This time, Cas walked in in his regular attire and made his way around the store. He knocked many things over as he gathered up the items he was searching for and the worker seemed quite annoyed with him but unwilling to say anything.
Placere exaudi orationem meam
“Peachy,” he grinned half-heartedly.
“Yeah we do,” Dean shut him down. “We do, Sam. Lucifer killed her. She’s gone. They’re all gone.”
She moaned in pain and gripped her head tighter before relaxing. She let out a soft, “thank you” as her knees dropped to the floor, her eyes shut, and she fell asleep on the ground. Her form began to dissolve, soaking back into the ground where it had come from. In a few moments, it was as if she had never been there. Except Cas now stood before them, clad in his suit and trench coat as always. Dean couldn’t help but notice that he looked happy.
A field surrounded them that Dean instantly recognized. He was sure Cas did as well, though for different reasons.
Dean’s eyes burned as he began to spread the ashes, watching them float in the air to softly land on the flowers like Cas was a blanket gently cradling the wildlife. The ash in the air seemed almost dreamlike as it drifted, spreading across the entire meadow. Cas wanted to see it all, Dean figured smiling a little to himself.
“And you were,” Cas said, knowing what Dean was going to ask. “He killed you and turned you into a demon.”
“I know,” she walked up to him with tears in her eyes and laid a hand on his cheek. “That doesn’t change the fact that you killed me.”
“You saved me,” Cas said as he looked at Dean.
Cas laughed. “I don’t know. Clouds and a halo?”
O inania
Dean heard Sam and Jack faintly talking, but all he could think of was Cas.
And he thought of Dean. Beautiful Dean. Dean who was sitting in front of him and talking to him with such hope shining in his eyes. Always such hope.
Sam smiled at him, “Yeah we did.”
Venite auxilium vobis dormientibus
As Dean watched the wound, she shifted again. Charlie was standing in front of him, wavy red hair and bright eyes. “Dean.”
He teared up watching the wildflowers gently swaying from side to side. He sighed, “This is it.”
At Cas. Why’d he have to go charging in there? They could have handled it.
“Of a sort. I know what it feels like to be human, but the feelings I have for you are something stronger.” They took a step towards each other. “It feels like I have been waiting for you since I was created and now that I’ve found you I can’t lose you. I don’t know if that ever compares to human emotions, but I have learned what it is to feel because of you. For you.”
He could almost convince himself to call Cas like he was just out of the room.
Tears were streaming down her face as she continued to kneel by the river. “Dean, how come you didn’t try to save me?”
Cas nodded. “Don’t let me stop you.”
Dean stood, “Yes dumbass ‘we.’ You, me, and Sam. We’re just better together. Let’s go Team Free Will. Let’s get it done.”
Dean jerked away from her. This couldn’t be Jo. She had forgiven him.
Dean tried to reassure himself as he walked away.
Metatron grinned at Castiel. “You draped yourself in the flag of Heaven but ultimately it was all about saving one human. Guess what. He’s dead too.”
Cas stepped forward and took it.
The angel he loved was dead.
Too soon, the credits began to roll and Dean turned to Cas eagerly, “What did you think?”
Dean stretched to look at the wings and could faintly see them glistening even in the darkness that surrounded them. He can feel the strain in Cas’ body from the effort the attempts are taking. “Cas, it’s okay to let us go down. We can figure out a new strategy when we reach the bottom.”
“He made you a mixtape?” Sam began to grin.
Did Cas just tell him he
They had defeated God. Jack had taken over his position, and they were finally free from the story. But they had lost Cas.
“I tried-”
“I’m sorry for—.” Cas began, but Dean cut him off.
Dean opened the door quickly, dressed in his robe and looking relaxed and ready for bed.
They laid together for a few more moments before agreeing they needed to keep moving and had stayed still long enough. They needed to get out before anything bad happened in the outside world or they got stuck here.
Dean was never really into reading unless he found something he liked. It wasn’t that he didn’t like it, just that he didn’t often find a book suited to his tastes.
The reception was filled with dancing and singing and lots of drinking, but most of all it was filled with happiness because their little found family had grown so much over the years. The boys knew they were finally free of any story written by some bad writer. They could make their own path together with the ones they loved, and they would have a beautiful heaven waiting for them when it ended a long time from now.
If he closed his eyes, he could imagine Cas here. His dark hair roughly getting blown around in the wind, more messed up than it already was and looking like he had flown around on those wings of his. His eyes would shine bright blue like a hint of his grace shining through. He would smile, easy going and free. He deserved to have this peaceful moment in the meadow. Cas thrived being in nature, surrounded by creation in its purest form. He always seemed so in awe of Earth, down to the smallest bee that Dean could see buzzing from one flower to the next.
Sam pulled out some papers from behind his back, and Dean scooted across the bed to get a closer look. Sam handed them to Dean, and he flipped through. They were job listings for things he barely needed any qualifications for.
Cas looked down at the cassette in his hands. The white lined square read “Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx.” He didn’t know what to say. “Thank you, Dean. I’ll listen to it tonight.”
Cas stood in front of the stove as he waited for the popcorn to finish popping. His eyes trailed Dean as he walked to the fridge and grabbed two beers.
“Guess we gotta send Taylor Swift a thank you note,” Dean quipped.
He texted Sam not to wait up and got in his car to go. The Impala purred as he drove. Her beauty, usually so comforting, only a stab that the world can keep going when something so horrible has occurred.
Dean thought. One silver lining to a shitty situation.
On the car ride home the truth hit him.
Cas sighed and used the hand not trapped in Dean’s to ruffle his own hair. “When you had been turned into a demon. Sam and I were worried about you.”
Dean had tried to run forward to stop him, but Sam had pulled him back. He had called out, but it was too late as they were pushed through the portal. Dean remembers that fleeting moment of hope when Cas appeared through the portal with enough time for Sam to call out his name before Lucifer appeared.
He had spent nine years with the angel and had failed him once again.
Dean couldn’t think the words. He thought he would break.
Cas shoved him, “I am.”
Dean’s brow furrowed, “When was this?”
Dean nodded and forced himself to look away from the scene, his eyes watering just thinking about it. He stared at Cas, taking in the fact that he was alive. He was next to the man he was mourning for so heavily. Cas was alright.
When he turned back, Jo was waiting for him.
He walked up to the library to see if Sam was awake. He found him sitting at his computer with a few books surrounding him.
Cas had already seen it, but he was happy to watch it with Dean to see what parts he commented on and how he rambled on about the film.
Two of the girls were standing in the audience, one in a trenchcoat
Dean huffed out a laugh. “Yeah I guess so.”
Dean tried to shut down the thoughts filling his head.
The brothers gathered the ingredients and soon enough they were set up and ready to perform the spell. They had agreed Sam would read the spell and Dean would be on standby to help out.
The two pulled back, faces only an inch apart. Both were breathing heavily.
“Yes, Dean,” Cas begrudged.
Sam looked at the list of thirteen songs: Willow, Cardigan, We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together, The Way I Loved You, Sparks Fly, Blank Space, Ready For It, Love Story, This Is Me Trying, You Belong With Me, Ivy, Cruel Summer, and Picture to Burn.
He saw himself standing at the edge of the green grass near the river, looking out over the windmill a couple hundred yards away. He was alone with an urn and tears were silently streaming down his face.
“Now for your side of the bargain?” She waited a moment as they walked over to Cas who began to sit up.
Once more, Dean covered Cas with the sheet. Taking a deep breath to steady himself, he grabbed the curtains from the windows and began to use them to tie up Cas’ legs. The curtains were nicer than the ropes they usually used for the standard hunter’s funeral. Cas should have the best.
“Cas, I-” Dean didn’t have anything that could live up to what Cas had just confessed to him. No words would be enough, so he used his actions. He leaned in, grabbed Cas’ tie, and pulled him close as he smashed their lips together.
Castiel listened to the mixtape that night. He reveled in it. He had never understood the attachment humans, and Dean specifically, had to music, but listening to this set of songs, Cas felt like he grasped it.
Dean held his best friend in his arms, hardly breathing as he tried not to jostle him. He held him close as he walked into the house.
The memories came into focus, strengthening the gray backdrop surrounding them. Dean realized it was the compound in the future Zachariah had shown him where the Croatoan virus took over. They walked into the building to find Cas in a circle filled with women, flashing forward to him telling Dean “I thought you’d gotten over trying to label me?”
Dean bit his lip. He couldn’t hurt his best friend. Logically, he knew it wasn’t her. He knew it was a monster and it needed to die so it would stop tormenting them. No matter how hard he tried to remind himself, he kept flashing back to Charlie giving herself up in the process of trying to save him. Listening to her on the phone in her last moments and not being able to get there fast enough to do anything.
“This is going to be one of the best movies you’ve ever seen,” Dean said as he popped the bottles open.
Dean paused with Cas beside him, presumably to let Dean deal with her.
Both of them watched his eyes track something. Dean’s eyes shifted to Cas beside him, still holding his hand, as he watched him turn to see what Dean was looking at so intently through the window. Dean watched as Cas saw himself ringing someone up at the checkout -- human and doing his best to get by.
He found the dining room table and that seemed as good a place as any, it was large enough to hold him. With one hand, he held Cas’ body close as he brushed everything off with the other. He didn’t care as the items all went flying to the floor. It’s not like anyone would be living here.
She slumped, dead. Blood began to pour out of the wound and Dean could hardly bear the sight. It was almost the same as the bathroom-- Charlie’s blood covering her abdomen and nothing Dean could do to fix it.
“I was considering asking for your help,” Cas said, resting a hand on his shoulder. “But I feared I had already asked you for too much. I didn’t want to burden you with the war in Heaven, too.”
All the way dead.
He sat back down and picked the papers up again. “It feels right to try to live my life now. We earned it.”
“Chick music? Cas I—.” Dean stopped, seeing Cas’ face falling. “Thanks.”
marathon, and Dean had just forgotten.
Dean got out his knife and slashed at her. She tried to jump back, but wasn’t fast enough and the skin around the wound steamed. Silver hurt her.
Dean spent the next week applying to jobs, and he even started to get some calls back. He was looking into construction management. He liked the idea of working on a project and completing it to help people. The company seemed interested in hiring him, and he was getting excited for the first time about doing something normal with his life. He always knew his mom didn’t want him to go into hunting, and for the first time he knew the world would be alright with him going into the legitimate workforce.
Dean frowned, but Cas turned to him, “You knew the risks of taking the mark. It was the only way. And hey, it all worked out in the end.”
“Mornin’ sunshine,” Dean smiled. He could hardly believe he was happy at any point in this hellish landscape, but he had to admit he enjoyed spending his time with Cas.
He took Cas’ hand nervously and their fingers intertwined. He looked back up into Cas’ eyes, and he felt a spark of hope light in his stomach. He knew he would be alright now. He had Cas back.
Cas chuckled, "Not quite."
After an hour more of walking, they came upon a girl kneeling by the river. They were hesitant about approaching her because nothing in this place could be normal. She appeared to have short blond hair ending above her shoulders that were shaking with sobs.
Before he could throw it at them, Cas was on him.
Dean had powered through fighting Chuck, but after he collapsed on his bed and sobbed. He couldn’t take the idea that the angel he had known for over a decade was gone. He needed time to mourn. Jack had disappeared and everyone had come returned so that was a good sign things were going back to normal.
“These were the kids who were putting on a production of our lives based on Chuck’s books. They had some interesting personal takes on the matter.”
Cas walked over to Dean and held out a hand. Dean took it and allowed him to help him up. If they didn’t let go of each other after that, neither of them was about to comment on it.
Sitting on one side of the desk was Naomi, and Cas was on the other.
Reluctantly, he pulled away and drove for some miles further until he spotted a beautiful meadow. It was filled with wildflowers and had a beautiful windmill in the center, pushing clean air around. The sky shone blue above it with little white clouds dotting it. It was unfair, it was such a stunning day.
Dean turned to Cas, “See. Case in point. You did return to me. She’s a liar.”
After a week, Sam knocked on his door. He had known this would happen at some point, and he was surprised Sam had waited this long. “Yeah?” he called.
Cas walked in at that moment, interrupting him as he had just sat down. “Hello Dean.”
The room seemed to focus on one memory, bringing it into large form around them.
“You want to help me?” She paused, eyeing them suspiciously. “How do I know you’ll stay true to your word?”
The pair watched
They waited a moment before a black, sticky substance began to crawl out of the ground, forming a large circle of goo. The liquid coalesced into the blond form that used to be Meg.
Cas tried to muster up a smile, but he couldn’t help feeling disappointed. Dean didn’t like his gift. He had failed. Again.
After a few more moments of drifting, Dean felt his feet hit solid ground. He looked around and everything appeared to be tinted a reddish orange hue. They landed beside a fiery river that was quickly making its way through the rocky terrain.
He worried Cas was going to run off, to leave him alone to fend for himself again. It would be Purgatory all over “for his own good.”
Cas stood several feet away from Dean just watching him as he raked the leaves up.
But Cas.
“I miss him,” Cas told the person on the other end of the phone.
Cas turned to him, “I was forced to kill you. Hundreds of versions of you and different ways it could go down.” He winced. “She wanted to prepare me for anything.”
Sam was off with Eileen on a date night, so it was just the two of them.
“No, though we do explore the nature of Destiel in act two.”
“Thank you, Sammy,” Dean said, placing the papers on his bed as he pulled Sam in for a hug. “These look like some really good options.”
Cas would love it.
“This was the moment you chose to work with him?”
Dean’s book sat on the nightstand.
Dean looked back and forth, gaping at his surroundings. The walls seemed to stretch far above them so they couldn’t see the end. There was no ceiling, only darkness. The planes surrounding them were uneven and had bubbles with things growing inside them, some as large as humans and looking ready to pop. It was like the whole thing was alive. He saw the river glowing red, and his brain started to work overtime trying to figure out where he recognized it. The rocky terrain seemed familiar and he kept going back to staring at that fiery river before realizing they could be in the House of Hades. “I think this is from my book.”
Dean glanced at the page again to see if he missed anything. “Let’s do it.”
Dean looked at the pleading Dean, “I don’t remember this.”
“I guess it’s worth a shot,” Cas replied.
“So you like the mixtape,” Cas joked, trying for a smile.
Dean had to stand by as Lucifer stabbed his best friend through the heart. He shouted out “No!” and had to watch as the brilliant light inside him flashed brightly before burning out, leaving him a shell of the angel he used to be as he crumpled to the ground.
They found a small rock formation they could barely fit into which would work well to shield them from the outside world. “I will watch over you,” Cas rumbled.
There was a pause as Sam let Dean gather his thoughts.
Miracle had bounded up to Dean in the street after being popped back into existence, and Dean could never deny him. He brought him home, and the dog had adapted to life in the bunker well. He was the only thing getting Dean out of bed in the morning.
“You should be,” she said, her face turning cold as she ran towards him.
“You must fight her, Dean,” Cas said beside him. “This is your battle.”
Dean eventually picked himself up. He didn’t know how many hours he had been kneeling on the ground, but his bones cracked as he did. Sam was still gone, probably looking after the newborn in the house. The newborn Cas had died to protect.
“Thank you, Cas,” Dean said once more, genuinely. “For everything.”
Cas thought about all those he couldn’t help. He thought about Kelly who he had failed by losing her when she was at the biggest crossroads of her life. He thought of Sam who he had befriended over the years, but who he had hurt far too many times in the past. He thought of Heaven who he had failed as he fell and failed and failed time and time again when he was only trying to help.
Too quick the urn was empty and Dean stood in a field covered in Cas' ashes.
He punched the steering wheel. He slammed his hands down again and again, hardly knowing what he was doing but just wanting to get out his rage at the world. At Jack. At Chuck. At Lucifer. At himself.
The two fell into a silence once more, listening to the song surrounding them.
The lights blazed white and began to shift again, but Naomi seemed to shift with them. Suddenly they were in a room and Naomi was talking to Dean.
Dean spoke up, “If you don’t fall asleep, you’ll be able to stop us right?”
He closed his eyes and prayed to Cas as if he could still hear him. He prayed for strength. For the will to go on. For love.
“It’s this book Sam recommended. I thought it could be a good break after all the lore we’ve been reading on this case. A lot of the cases are very different and don’t really line up so the research has been exhausting.”
Sam’s grin brightened and he laughed. “That’s perfect!”
Obviously, he had to play it. He didn’t need to sleep, so he laid on the bed in the room Sam and Dean had given him for hours on end simply letting the songs play and rewinding back to the start when it came to an end.
He wrote down some ideas he had for it, but had no clue how to go about making one. He stared at his list. He needed help.
This must be their own personal House of Hades.
They watched as she closed her eyes. The black goop started to move around her feet, bubbling and forming little shapes and bubbles as if something was trying to escape. Another piece of the darkness seemed to escape her, as if a phantom limb was reaching out. It began to grow, morphing and reaching to the floor. The goo expanded until it almost seemed the height of a person. Sam and Dean made eye contact, hardly believing this was going their way. They were going to have Cas back.
Sam took Jack for lunch, but Dean went to the store. Dean bought urns for their ashes. He collected Cas’ ashes, sweeping them into the jar as tears rolled slowly down his face. This was all that was left. Nine years and some ashes.
Dean didn’t know what to do. Ever since thinking he had lost Cas in Purgatory, he had never felt this type of loss. His hurt was only built up over the years.
Cas was worried.
Castiel came back to the bunker late one night and figured he’d see if Dean was still awake to check in. He had been away a few days and wanted to make sure their last hunt had gone well.
Dean tilted his head in response, his brain struggling to process what Cas just said.
The world around them began to transform. Colors swirled and scenes began to appear that both of them could recall from their memories, seeing themselves in an out of body experience. Dean saw himself laughing with Sam as they lit off fireworks, the four of them with Bobby around a table, Cas standing with who he assumed were several other angels.
The scene continued, but Dean was stuck on those words. “Miss who?”
He paused after tying a knot and closed his eyes. He glanced up towards the head of the table where Cas’ face lay covered. The sheet did nothing to hide his loss. His best friend—.
Dean was left raking leaves none the wiser.
They were transported to one of the military grade Jeeps, riding alongside the other versions of themselves as Cas told Dean, “The only thing I think we have left, Dean and me, is each other. If Dean says it’s time to go out in a blaze of glory, win or lose, so be it. I’m in. But then...that’s just how I roll.”
Dean blushed thinking about how different this other version of Cas is and looked to the Cas beside him to see how he felt. “He’s right,” he said softly. “I’d die for you. I already have.”
Cas slowed down a moment, but Dean was too distracted with the idea that he had to constantly be moving otherwise he would fall. Suddenly a whooshing sound came from in front of Dean and before he knew it, Cas’ arms were wrapped around his waist. Dean’s legs flung up, spread wide. Cas bent over backwards just in time for Dean to watch a knife narrowly sail overhead right between them. Dean went slightly cross eyed watching it until it whizzed and got stuck into a tree behind him.
He stared at his face, eyes closed and Dean could almost imagine he was sleeping. Except angels don’t sleep. He also wasn’t breathing. Dean wasn’t going to make that mistake again.
Sam nodded, “I thought so.”
Sam patted Cas on the shoulder, “You got this buddy.”
His hands shook, but he forced himself to continue. Castiel deserved a proper send off and Dean was going to make sure he got it.
Dean left to get a beer and Cas was left standing in his room. He looked down at the mixtape still in his hands. A gift from Dean.
Dean turned to him, but he wasn’t looking at what was happening, only at his feet. “When we were looking for the angel tablet. She programmed me to kill you.”
His hand cradled Cas’ head as he laid him down. Dean took a shuddering breath as he stared at him for a moment before he stomped away looking for a sheet.
The film ended and Cas turned to Dean who was talking about the ax scene. Cas nodded, though he couldn’t focus on what Dean was saying.
Cas tilted his head. “Your brother made me a mixtape with ‘Dean’s Top 13 Zepp Traxx.’” He made air quotes around the title. “I have never received a gift before, so I assumed the appropriate response was to make one for him in return.”
Cas sheathed his blade and walked back over to Dean. He began to check over Dean’s body as if he feared he had been hit. “Are you alright?”
She sighed. “You called?”
“You don’t have to say it, Dean. I know,” Cas said.
So, Dean drove. He drove for miles sometimes speeding as fast as he could go just because he could. No one was around to stop him. He slowed, pulling over to the side of the road.
Dean didn’t want to admit it, but Cas was right. They were learning a lot about each other in this hellscape.
Dean looked at the spell. There was a list of some basic ingredients they had in the bunker along with the incantation they had to read.
Dean looked up from under his eyelashes, a smirk making its way onto his face. “I couldn’t just let your gift go to waste now, could I?”
The night was coming to a close an hour or so later.
Dean let out a sigh of relief and sadness, nearly collapsing as a single tear slipped out. This battle was over. Cas caught him and held him up. Dean leaned on him and they stood together for a few moments just taking in the sadness of the situation.
He looked back at Castiel laying on the bed. If his eyes drifted slightly down to the exposed chest, no one around would be the wiser.
One day, Dean was sitting at his computer in their study when Sam stalked in. “There you are!”
“It’s good, Cas,” he laughed a little. “I don’t know when I’m going to listen to it, but thank you for the thought.”
Cas looked down, unable to meet the eyes of the man he had fallen in every way for and yet continued to fail, “I’d like that.”
He set down the red can and faced the pyre. “Goodbye, Cas…Goodbye Kelly. Goodbye Crowley. Goodbye Mom—“
Dean’s mind didn’t let him think of that, his inner chant of “Cas” going uninterrupted as he gazed at the stars.
“I miss you,” Dean croaked out.
Dean leaned in next to Cas' ear, "You know it's almost like I gripped you tight and raised you from the Empty."
The urn was full and he grabbed the top, shutting it.
Dean swung his blade and she dodged, slashing him with claws he failed to notice.
He looked over, hoping to see a very familiar ugly trench coat, but all that was seated beside him was the urn. Bright and shining as if an interminable reminder of all he had lost.
“Cas,” Dean said as he was almost out of the room. Cas paused and turned back again. “You can’t—with everything that’s going on—. You can’t just go dark like that. We didn’t know what had happened to you. We were worried. That’s not okay.”
Once more they were following the river though it began to get smaller, turning into a stream.
Covering Cas slightly lessened the hurt. Dean could imagine it wasn’t Cas under there, but some other person they just happened to come across.
Dean opened
He remembered then that he was falling and they would have to deal with that, but he realized he no longer was. Cas was holding him and they were gently floating down the pathway. The slow descent aided by the wings Dean could now barely see out of the corners of his eyes.
Cas met Sam in his room and they began the process of making his mixtape for Dean. Sam had some spare empty cassettes lying about and they grabbed one for the project.
At a pretium
Ubi angeli ad somnum
Dean gave a little smile and coughed, “Cool. Just let me know what you think.”
“I--” Cas paused. “That’s what you’re focusing on?”
“Sam, I-”
“Come on, Dean. You don’t know already? What happened to your GED and give ‘em hell attitude. I thought you could figure it out,” she smirked at him.
Dean lazily opened his eyes and was met with Cas’ inches away, their bright blue darting behind him as if to pretend he hadn’t been caught staring.
“I’m so sorry,” Dean said as he tightened his grip on his blade.
“Cas, it’s good to see you back,” Dean said.
She looked up at where he stood above her. “Don’t do this to me. Don’t gut me like they did,” not-Charlie pleaded.
“I’ve got you, Dean.” It was said right into his ear causing Dean to shiver.
Dean grinned, “If I can recall you from early on, you would be offended by that description.” He stood up straight and deepened his voice to imitate Cas. “Angels are warriors of God. I’m a soldier.”
Cas took a step closer. “I can’t read your thoughts anymore, so I guess I’ll have to get used to hearing you say it.”
“I thought you might say that,” Sam grinned and Dean narrowed his eyes. “I brought something to help with your decision making.”
The duo smiled and began the process of recording the songs onto the mixtape.
“Oh,” Dean let out. “I see.”
When Dean woke, it was peaceful. He had expected it to be violent -- being shaken awake at a monster attack and having to go on the move again. Instead, he woke to Cas’ warmth once more. His arms formed a tight grip around him that loosened when they felt him begin to shift awake.
Cas paused. “You.”
“Something’s off.”
“You’re hoping Castiel will return to you. I admire your loyalty. I only wish he felt the same way,” Naomi said.
The scene refocused, colors and shapes solidifying to show Cas laying in bed shirtless on the phone and looking off into the distance mourning. Dean didn’t recognize the memory, so it must have been just one of Cas’.
He could hear Sam step into the room and walk over to his desk, sitting in his chair.
Tonight was no different as the two settled in to watch
Dean furrowed his brows.
The Wendigo slapped him, throwing him to the ground several feet away.
“That isn’t you. That’s Naomi’s version of you,” Cas explained. As he did, hundreds of Deans began to appear around the room. They were all dressed in the same green jacket and blue jeans and lay on the ground, blood spilling about them. Dead. “They all were.”
Dean nodded and then leaves were covering the ground as well as grass while trees sprung up around them.
In the early hours of the morning, he sat up. He had to give him something back or perhaps Dean just wanted him to learn some of his favorite songs.
“You know you can ask for help now though. Right, Cas?” Dean turned to him. “We’re family. We’re always going to help you figure out a way.”
The pair continued on with nothing else to do but keep walking.
He watched as Dean fumbled in his drawers. His head cocked as he watched Dean pull out something small, black, and rectangular. A cassette. Cas squinted at it.
A note sat on top of the book next to their bed though Dean and Cas wouldn’t notice it for many hours.
“And whose fault is that?” she snapped.
He cringed and it hurt him, but he let the blade sink down into her chest. He watched the light go out of her eyes and more tears fell. He truly did miss her.
Dean put a hand on the angel blade in his jacket.
“Hey now,” Dean gently tilted his head up to look him in the eyes, knowing it meant Cas trusted him because he let him do so. “I’m still here. You didn’t kill me. You fought against her.”
He wish he could have told him how much he—.
Dean’s eyebrows furrowed. “There was nothing I could have done. You were dead the second she went out that window.”
Dean could reach out and touch them if he tried, and his hand was automatically doing so. His fingertip brushed one of the wings and they were softer than he anticipated. They felt like silk sheets, cool and inviting. Cas shivered at the touch and Dean backed his hand away. The wings were beautiful extensions of Cas’ body, and they seemed to move with him.
Cas was by his side now though, and Dean wasn’t about to lose that. He grabbed Cas’ hand and pulled him along so they began walking. Dean didn’t have time to think about the significance of the move, only that he wasn’t about to let Cas get away from him this time.
Their lips met and it was the nearly decade of time building up to this moment. Cas was reminded why he fell. This one human who was so lovable and now they were here, Dean wrapping his arms tight around Cas and pulling him closer as their lips continued to move. Betraying everything he knew for the one righteous man; his faith in Chuck failing, only to be replaced with the one true thing in the world: his care for Dean Winchester.
The soft creek of the windmill sounded as it made its way in circles. A brook burbled nearby.
Jack sat down to eat with them and told how he had reformed Heaven. He broke down the walls that separated people in their memories, allowing them to roam and be with the ones they loved. Jack explained how he made sure the vengeful spirits that rested on Earth like Kevin were let back in as well as folks like Bobby who had been barred as well. While he knew he wanted to be less hands on, he promised he would visit every once in a while to check on his parents as they grew old.
Dean and Cas walked as quickly as they could, following the river and hoping it would lead them somewhere.
They sat together with Dean occasionally pointing out moments and fun trivia in the film. Cas smiled softly at how excited Dean was to show him one of his favorite films. Dean continued to geek out over the cowboys the rest of the night, talking about how he bought his own cowboy hat once he had seen the film and promising to show it to Cas afterwards.
Sam rolled his eyes. “What happened to Cas?”
Cas blocked and slashed while Dean watched. Gordon was good, but his angel was better.
Placere exaudi orationem meam
Everything around them faded, the memories pushed back to the past where they belonged.
Dean turned to him, his face taking on a serious light as he furrowed his brows and took a few steps closer. He leaned in and placed an arm on Cas’ shoulder. He made sure to catch Cas’ eye before he said, “Cas, this movie is life changing.”
Castiel lightly took the mixtape back. A gift. Dean had given this mixtape to him as a gift. Castiel had never received a gift before.
Dean and Castiel had movie night every Friday. They took the night and Dean showed Cas the movies he loved. Sometimes Sam and Jack would join them, but sometimes it would be just the two of them alone in the dark room watching the flashing colors on the television together.
The pair then stood outside a Gas N’ Sip. Dean knew immediately what memory they were in. The Impala sat several feet away, and Dean leaned up against it staring inside the building.
“Well I didn’t mean to add to your distress,” he paused, wanting to find a way to articulate what he had been feeling. It all felt very human. “Dean, I just keep failing. Again and again. When you were taken, I searched for months and I couldn’t find you. And then Kelly escaped on my watch and I couldn’t find her. And I just—wanted—. I needed to come back here with a win for you…And for myself.”
They grinned at each other, and Dean couldn’t believe how lucky he was to have this angel turned human standing in front of him loving him in return. He had always thought of himself as his dad’s blunt little instrument, but being loved by Cas helped him realize he could be more than that.
Cas pulled the mixtape out of his pocket. Dean’s eyes tracked the movement and saw it when he held it in his lap. Cas looked down at the title on the side for a moment longer before he handed it over to Dean.
“Like you having feelings for me.”
Cas paused awkwardly, not certain how to phrase his request. “I require assistance making a mixtape for your brother. I’m not sure how to make one and I assume you have experience making them.”
All Dean could do was watch.
“I remember Sam mentioned you liked one of her songs and that one time you were—.” Cas tried to rationalize.
Cas gave in and angled his wings to take them on a nice glide.
Castiel was dead.
Dean stared at his feet, blinking back the tears that were looming behind his eyes. “He sacrificed himself.”
Sam looked up fast. “What’s up, Cas? Is there a case?”
The door was unassuming. If it had not been in this pit of misery, it could have belonged to any normal house or apartment. It stood alone, not against anything. It was a shining onyx with a brilliant silver doorknob. On the door were carved two letters in fancy script that wouldn’t be noticeable from farther away: D & C.
Cas and Dean stared at each other for a minute before Dean broke and stared at the floor instead, rubbing his head awkwardly with a hand.
Cas watched Dean’s reaction trying to gauge his feelings on the gift.
Cas was about to leave when Dean called, “Cas, wait a moment.”
“He’s definitely not the example of health. Admitting he likes Taylor Swift could be a good first step.”
He took the mixtape from its constant place in his pocket and placed it on the desk beside Dean. He tapped it lightly, his heart breaking slightly as he let go of it. The tape had been a nice reminder of Dean and his time together, but he knew he had to give it back. He couldn’t stand to keep it as he failed Dean once more. He turned to go.
Cas heard music softly flowing under the door as he knocked.
Sam shook his head and blinked hard for a moment. “A mixtape?”
“Where are we?” Dean asked, broken out of his trance and looking around. Other than Cas’ now physical wings, this was not a good situation to be in.
He stopped when Cas pulled him into a hug and said, “I’m so proud to call you my son.”
“Uh…” Dean couldn’t respond.
“Okay, but what would a flag of Heaven even look like?” Dean wondered aloud.
The pyre was done.
Mary had saved them and he lost her too. Crowley was dead, sacrificed. So many friends gone.
“We should treat this like Purgatory. Let’s keep moving and hopefully we’ll find the end. There has to be a door out of this place if we walk through. I think that’s how it worked in the book though I didn’t get very far.” Dean gruffly explained as they continued to walk.
“Of course,” Dean muttered back. “Cas-”
Dean nodded, “I know. It’s just hard. We always had something to fight, but now we don’t have to anymore.”
Cas saved him. Again.
Soon enough, they were done and Sam was handing Cas a fully loaded mixtape to give to Dean.
Dean opened his eyes again and Charlie was still there, grinning as if she had come over for a
The music reflected Dean’s soul and Cas fell even further every moment he listened.
Dean gently picked Castiel up once more and carried him to the pyre next to where Sam had placed Kelly. He stared for a moment before pouring the oil on his body.
“Dean, I don’t believe that is wise-”
Dean pulled back the sheet, revealing Cas’ face once more. It was still him. The face hadn’t magically changed while it had been under the curtain like the hunter had hoped.
Now he would be the one putting the blade through her and he had to look away and gather himself. He had to kill the shifter,
The two had moved to Dean’s room so he could show Cas his cowboy hat, putting it on and turning around to give him a full view. Cas nodded his approval and Dean’s grin somehow grew wider.
“My point still stands. It can’t be a white flag because it would just look like you’re surrendering if you ever went to battle. So what would it look like?”
“If you release Castiel from your void, we will help you go back to sleep. You said Jack made it loud, and we want to help you,” Sam explained.
Dean went off on a tangent about cowboys and Cas watched his face light up.
“What’s up, Sammy?” he asked.
Dean laughed, full and loud. “I can’t wait.”
Cas’ wings retracted into his back so it was as if they were never there. Dean missed them as soon as they were gone, but he also knew it was for the best that they weren’t taking up space and calling attention to them. They needed to be as discreet as possible to escape from here.
“Oh,” he paused, wanting to say more, but the words were not coming. Instead, he twisted back to the door.
“Kill him,” Naomi demanded.
Dean looked around the white office before turning back to the scene in front of him.
me while she was inside. I just wanted to go to school like your little brother. Would you torture your little brother, Dean?”
Cas nodded before his eyes widened at the lack of noise coming from in front of him. He pushed Dean’s arm off and began moving the popcorn off the stove and pouring it into a bowl. As he did this, he missed the flash of hurt that passed across Dean’s face at his rejection before he threw his easy grin back on.
“You can’t keep locking yourself away here though. You have to make his sacrifice worth it. We’re finally free from the story, and you can choose how to live your life.”
The build up of over a decade of knowing each other seemed to explode between them as suddenly their hands were all over each other, trying to get as close as possible. They couldn’t get enough, always needing more.
Sam and Eileen got married the following year. Dean and Castiel could be seen holding hands in the front row along with many rows filled with their fellow hunters that made up their family and friends over the years. Jody, Donna, and even Jack at the far back of the audience filled the seats to watch the two promise their lives to each other.
Before Dean could answer, the colors began to swirl again. The blues and yellows and blacks of the scene turned into huge clouds of smoke.
He took a deep breath and roughly pushed the tears off his face. Cas was—.
Dean hated to admit any sign of weakness, but he was too exhausted to stop. “Cas,
Cas was—.
“Ready?” He clapped a hand on Cas’ shoulder as he picked up the full bowl of popcorn, a few burnt pieces softly steaming on top.
Cas nodded to himself, he would make a mixtape for Dean in return.
Dean couldn’t believe he hadn’t been on good terms when Castiel—.
“I know,” Charlie said.
“No, Cas. I need to tell you. I love you, too. I think I knew for a while, but I didn’t want to think what that would have meant for us,” Dean said, looking earnestly into his bright blue eyes. At some point in the past several minutes, Sam had disappeared to some other part of the bunker.
Dean looked over to Cas, “This is what Zachariah showed me to convince me to say yes.”
Past Cas walked up to the register. “Where is the pie?” Dean realized all his favorite items were in Cas’ basket.
“I gave you some options to start out with. I wasn’t sure what exactly you would be interested in, but I tried to get a variety-”
Dean quoting along with the film at points.
“Hey, Dean,” she gave a brief smile. “Miss me?”
He watched as Cas walked up to it, knowing they had never faced something like this together but also knowing that Cas was older than humanity itself.
Cas’ lips quirked up, “I can see why you enjoy it. Cowboys are very fun.”
Cas frowned. “Yes. Is something wrong?”
The scene flashed to Naomi holding an instrument over Cas threatening to rewire his brain before it went back to Cas denying her in her office.
Dean closed his eyes pained and let a tear slip out.
He continued to stare at his feet. He didn’t want to look at Sam and see the judgement in his eyes. Silence fell in the room before Dean continued, “I couldn’t tell him how I felt.”
The grace must have worked like fire as the Wendigo went up in flames moments later before crumbling to a heap of ash. Dean took a deep breath from where he laid on the ground.
Suddenly, the goo popped and Cas fell out to the ground, little slips of goo falling around him before retreating back into its blond form. She let out a gasp as the rest flowed back into her before she opened her eyes to stare at them.
Est mortis
“Sam, I need your help,” Cas said as he approached.
Cas pushed Dean behind him as his angel blade slipped out of his trenchcoat. His wings seemed poised to fend off the attack as they rose to an intimidating level. Dean was able to just barely peek around them and see Gordon in front of him, fangs out and hissing while he grabbed another knife from his belt.
Dean and Cas paused and looked at each other cautiously. “Do you think this is the way out?” Dean said, hardly wanting to believe it would be that easy.
Cas was calm, reaching out a hand to the Wendigo’s body. It looked confused and tried to hit him, but he simply stopped the arm with his other hand as if it was nothing. Dean marveled at Cas’ strength. His hand finally rested against the Wendigo’s chest and Dean wondered what he was about to do when the Wendigo began to light up. Cas’ hand shone with his grace, and the Wendigo cried out in pain.
Ubi angeli ad somnum
“We should probably keep moving,” Cas suggested, and Dean knew he was right.
“But when it came to the real you, no mind control could hold. Those hundreds of practice rounds did nothing. I couldn’t do it. Not to you.”
He had seen Dean’s soul as he pulled him out of hell, and hearing these songs brought him back to those moments. The glow and the warmth Dean exuded was something he had never experienced before. The music seemed like the perfect extension of that beautiful heart of his, but in a tangible way he could play on repeat.
“And you think this could work?”
“What are you?” Dean asked.
Dean felt the soft brush of the feathers on his bare arms. He shivered at their delicate touch. They seemed to cradle his body closer to Cas who wrapped his arms around Dean so he was pressed against his chest. Dean was not about to oppose and nestled into the space in his arms warm and comfortable, falling asleep in no time with the faint feeling of Cas’ hand brushing through his hair.
She stood and took a step closer to him. “No, you didn’t. You
One moment he was in his bed holding his book with Cas pressed to his side and the next he was falling.
Responde nobis, audi nos
Dean opened his mouth to respond, but nothing came out. He had no answer that wouldn’t give himself away -- that he wanted to see how Cas was doing, that he enjoyed seeing him in his element, that he cared how he was doing at his job, that he was nervous to go inside.
Cas let go of Dean, and he turned around to face him.
“Sorry Dean,” Cas rumbled. “I just wanted to return this.”
Dean sleepily nodded his thanks as he laid down on top of his jacket. He wasn’t expecting Cas to lay down behind him. As Cas laid down, Dean heard a rustling noise and he saw his wings unfurl and fold around the pair. They encircled them, hiding them from any monsters hoping to get a peak.
Cas laughed and shoved him backwards into his room and shut the door behind them as Cas’ mixtape swelled around them.
She raised an eyebrow. “I suppose that could work. Give me a moment.”
The room darkened and the memories started to swirl around again as if the room was looking for one to show next.
Cas sat down, his coat crumpling and his heat pressing against Dean’s side. It was a queen size bed, but they were next to each other with no space between them.
Dean carefully opened the urn, letting his tears roll down his chin, one landing softly inside the urn, a piece of him with Cas forever. He remembered how Cas had told him when he had the Mark of Cain that after everyone else was gone he would be the last one left.
need to rest. I can’t keep going like this. I’m dead on my feet.”
Dean hadn’t known what to say when Cas told him he loved him. It all happened so fast. One moment they were running from Billie and the next Cas had confessed, shoved Dean aside, and sacrificed himself to save Dean.
“I’m not sure. Perhaps this is some type of dream or alternate reality. Is there anything this reminds you of?” Cas also looked around.
She turned around suddenly and Dean shrugged at Cas in confusion about what was happening.
Chopping wood was a good way to get out his anger. Sam and Jack helped a bit as well, but they mostly left Dean on his own, knowing he needed space.
Dean’s mixtape showed Cas his soul; Cas’ mixtape showed Dean how the angel had learned to love.
One of the giant bubbles coming out of the ground several feet away popped and out came a Wendigo, similar to the one he and Sam had faced all those years ago in Blackwater Ridge. It was 10 feet tall and looming over them with its pale body and bony limbs. Dean realized they would need fire to destroy him and they definitely didn’t have a flare gun in any of their pockets.
And Sam's phone started buzzing in his pocket. Pulling it out, Sam saw messages flooding in from the Apocalypse World hunters, Stevie, Charlie, even one from Claire Novak that said she couldn't reach Dean or Cas. For a second, his heart stuttered in his chest, Eileen's name was so obviously absent it was almost a flashing sign.
"Dude...
Jack believed that they would, he wanted to pray that they would but he felt a little silly because technically
And so Castiel couldn't help but smile. "Hello, Dean."
!" Something shook Dean's shoulder, his head dropping rapidly downwards.
I just found out about the #TheirLoveWasReal challenge yesterday (b/c #DeanCasWedding was trending and I was DYING) and the Day One prompt (Carry On, Canonverse) really gave me the motivation to write the fix-it for 15x20 I've had in my head. So, I banged this entire fic out in like 8 hrs, proofed it today, and will post the first two chapters tonight and have the last two up tomorrow.
. The need for independence but the desire to share a life with someone, to fall in love in the most terrifying way. That things weren't all or nothing.
"Jack? Are you okay? What's wrong?" He could feel Dean's worried glance, but he was twisted around in his seat so he couldn't be certain.
(He remembered the Shadow holding Cas up by the throat, and then Castiel trading his own life for Jack's.)
"It's a one-night-only kind of deal," Amara explained. "It took me a while to set Heaven to rights, make some changes, and find him, but...you both deserve a little reward for saving the universe after all."
A chance to save Cas, a chance to actually use that free will they fought so hard for, a chance to live. (A chance to love, maybe truly love for the first time.)
of the spell Nick used to bring Lucifer back last year," Dean ground out, stabbing his laptop's power button viciously. "Anything from Rowena? Jody and Donna? Garth?"
(Maybe Dean also said, "stay" instead of "I love you.")
"How are you, you know...alive again?" Sam asked, because as much as he hated to admit it, Amara was right. She did help them trap Chuck, and maybe she did deserve a second chance, the opportunity to right some of her brother's wrongs. (And some of her own wrongs too.)
And then it ended.
," Amara repeated, her tone brokering no argument. "Chuck had millennia to hone his powers and control to such a degree, and with Jack's human side...you can't know what the consequences will be."
"Samuel," Rowena called, her voice unsure even as Sam and Eileen joined them in front of the dark mass. "The spell is almost dead...I won't be able to keep the gate open for very long after it dies."
"Hello boys," a Scottish accented-voice declared, and Dean whipped around in his seat to see the petite redhead standing there in one of her signature high-end, sequined dresses, curls piled on top of her head.
Disclaimer: I don't own SPN or Destiel and Saileen would be unequivocally canon.
he says, he'll lose Cas anyway. "You're our friend, our brother, and we...
I hope it wasn't too corny, but like I said at the top, callbacks and meaningful echoes of lines are my absolute Achilles heel, I love them so much.
Thank you so much to everyone who has read this whole fic! I love all of you so much, you guys make my whole day.
That was all Dean wanted: a chance.
"Wonderful, and..." the witch trailed off, almost like she wasn't sure if she should finish the thought. "You wouldn't happen to have any blood of that handsome trickster, would you?"
) "It's yes or no, man."
Nothing good ever came after "something's happening."
Because if the question was keeping his Grace to stay in the Empty or losing it to live a life with Dean...there was no choice at all.
(He really needed to thank those high school girls for coming up with a shorthand for referring to the two idiots.)
And he wasn't planning on proposing any time soon, but it was still nice to have it there, to know that he
"What!" Dean cried, throwing a hand out towards Jack. "He's
"I did just help save the universe, Dean," Amara replied dryly. "The least I deserve is a 'thank you,' don't you think?"
"Okay," he agreed. "But if you don't come back, I'm going in myself to drag both your asses out."
"It's okay," Sam assured her, gripping Eileen's hand tight. All four faces were watching the portal with expressions of varying degrees of fear and hope there. "They're gonna' make it."
(See the end of the chapter for
himself?
like that, and he'll love it because he loves Cas.
It wasn't the most conventional family by any means, but it was
"It's time," Sam interjected, Jack taking a step back to let Sam give Dean one last hug. "Be safe."
I hope you all enjoyed this prologue! I really think Jack deserved to actually, you know *live* after being a weapon/power source for most of his life. He was only 3!! And expect more from Shipper!Sam because he's just the most fun to write!
