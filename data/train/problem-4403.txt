'I really enjoy this song,' Castiel tells him suddenly, and Dean startles, embarrassed at being caught staring at him, and having some real dirty thoughts too. 'He talks about dying and it's definitely the catholic view of things, yet with the music, it does not sound very religious. It sounds...' he frowns. 'Sinful.'
'Awesome,' Dean grins, rocked hard by the force of the thrusts, and it's a ride to remember. Alpha changes the angle a little, hits that spot and Dean almost shouts, managing to stifle it to a choked off sound. 'Th-there,' he pleads, and then alpha bumps his head on the roof.
When they separate, Sam quickly wipes his face, and his eyes are red, but he still looks mostly composed.
hi! i know it's been 2 months this time. ive been sick on and off, so this chapter took me the longest to write. thats also why i have been slow responding to comments and didn't get back to some, but i wanna thank you all, cause i read them all and i love hearing what you guys think and it's so awesome to hear this story has really moved you, that some of you reread it, that you wait for updates. i hope this chapter was worth the wait! honestly i had those scenes and the plot twist (?) planned for so long, i no longer know what was supposed to be the plot twist, but i hope it came across lol.
'I think...' he starts, swallows, looks down on his cock. 'I think I do want you to touch me, there, I swear. I just got scared. It was so nice. I loved it.'
, and Dean's alpha clearly isn't doing that. Suddenly Castiel understands why Dean doesn't have access to a computer or some winter clothes. It must've been obvious to everyone, but with Dean's attitude, it was just so hard to imagine he'd let anyone mistreat him like that...
'Tell you when I feel bad, ask your permission to go anywhere, rat out your friends if they make a move on me or ask me sex stuff.'
,' he rolls his eyes, but then goes back to peeling the label. Castel wishes he could grab the bottle and throw it somewhere so that it shatters and Dean has to look at him. 'I'm a good actor, it turns out.'
Dean realizes he's just laying there, staring, not making a move to cover himself or roll off the pillow.
'Sit down, I'll do it,' it's an order, so Dean doesn't protest. 'You made coffee, I think it's only fair I make breakfast.'
There's a moment of silence, where Dean wrings his hands, staring at his lap, and Castiel reels from the confession. He can't even imagine being forced to go comatose every couple of months against his will, while his body hurt and burned and longed to be filled. And afterwards? How badly it must've hurt? What kind of withdrawal Dean's body had to go through? He's never heard of any alpha treating their omegas like that. He knew some didn't like to mate during heat, that's true. But to his knowledge, they never drugged their mates. And most alphas loved heats - the omegas were supposed to be insatiable then.
be selfish about. You have to be. No one else will do that for you. This is exactly what we talked about, and you did exactly what I asked you to do. You put yourself first, Dean, and doesn't it feel good?'
Castiel tries not to treat it as a sign of reverence. Because maybe, this isn't what Dean's saying at all. Maybe if he listens, if he
Another corridor, and he finds himself in the wedding room. It's empty save for the photographer's chair and the platform on which they'll exchange the vows. His new alpha stands at the altar, smoothing out his suit nervously, and Dean risks a look. He looks older, but not by much. He's handsome, dark messy hair, lean but muscular. Just as Dean stares at him, the alpha notices he's in the room and turns his head, and Dean drops his eyes. He doesn't want to see the disappointment - or disgust? - on the man's face.
'We weren't fighting over anything work-related,' Castiel replies smoothly. 'And I am not employed here anymore.'
'No,' Castiel replies easily and kisses his head. Dean pushes his nose against his neck and inhales shamelessly. Alpha still smells like home and safety. 'I do need a moment to... think it all through. Your past is very colorful.'
'Don't give me that shit,' Gordon, because that must be him, reaches Dean and slaps him across the face. So hard that Dean staggers and gasps, covering his head in a gesture that seems to come to him terrifyingly easy. Practiced, Castiel thinks, that's the word. Blood drips from Dean's nose, leaving a stain on the floor. Castiel thinks, detached, that he'll have to wipe it before he leaves. 'You've been spending enough of your time pretending to be learning and shit. I come home, and, would you imagine that, no dinner! And I told you to bring Terry lunch to work, but he calls me and says he hasn't seen you all day.'
'Yes,' Castiel interrupts him, closes his hands around Dean's, around the phone. 'Come sit down, Dean.'
The drive to the zoo takes a while. Dean eats his Snickers, and then spends the rest of the time dreading, waiting for alpha to ask him about Sam, to ask him how he's feeling. But alpha doesn't. He puts on some music, and smiles at Dean instead. Finally, when they end up stuck in the traffic, Dean can't take it anymore, the heaviness of the morning's events hanging between them, even though alpha does his best to dissolve the tension.
'Nice catch with the password,' Benny mentions, flipping the steak. The meat sizzles and the smell is heavenly. Dean doesn't even know when was the last time he attended a BBQ. One of Alastair's friends hosted it often, but Dean was just an ass to grab at the very least, help at best. Not an active participant, and definitely not someone who was invited to eat.
'Thank you,' alpha entwines their fingers together and leads him out of the room. 'I think we should eat?'
'Tell me if I do it wrong?' Castiel asks and leans in, snuggles close and rubs his neck against Dean's. Dean rests his cheek on alpha's head and breathes in his shampoo. Castiel's movements are uncoordinated and wary, but it just feels like a hug with some nuzzling, and Dean doesn't know why it's such a big deal. It's nice and cozy, and he hugs alpha closer.
'Dean can eat a substantial amount,' Castiel declares, and Dean gapes at him, betrayed - and a little self-conscious. But alpha just states it like it's a fact, not like he's trying to make fun of him. Benny must sense it too, but Dean adds, just in case:
'Now, now, please,' he pleads and wraps his hands around Castiel and rests his forehead against his. The alpha obliges eagerly; he grabs Dean's little cock, and it's so wet, Castiel didn't know it was possible to be this aroused. Dean must've been so self-restrained in the car...
'I mean, I'm glad it's cars now, not changing old folks' diapers,' Dean rolls his eyes. 'But the prof hates me.'
'Yes, over his mate,' the other beta replies, shortly, not up for discussion. 'That's none of our business.'
'So, Castiel told me you like movies,' Charlie continues, taking her phone back. 'When I called you, days ago, you said you like Star Wars, right?'
'I told him to leave, of course,' Castiel continues. 'And he seemed pleased of all things, though he tried to hide it. That troubled me for days, it was so jarring. But now that I understand who he is - he must've been checking if I'm being a good husband to you. I don't think it's a coincidence-'
He cries as he hears the taxi drive away, cries as he carries Dean's blanket to the bedroom, looks for the key and locks it, along with their shared bathroom; he opens all the windows and the door and sprays everything with some air freshener that Dean keeps under the sink; he puts on his suit again, so that there's no risk of the bite showing, and that's when he finds Dean's collar hanging by the door. He let him go without the collar. He dials Benny, shaking with rage at himself and from fear for Dean, but Benny picks up quickly.
'That's a great idea,' Castiel praises him and Dean smiles hesitantly. Alpha lifts himself off, then, and Dean mourns the loss - even though he can finally breathe properly - but then when the TV is on, the sound low but there, some news channel playing live, a proof that some people are awake out there and the reality becomes more tangible, alpha comes back and cuddles him to his chest, still so close.
'Did I do something wrong?' Dean asks, anxiety twisting his stomach, as soon as the doors close and he and alpha are alone.
'Nah,' he stares at his hands gripping the blanket. 'My dad wasn't crazy. He was smart and he was going to get that son of a bitch, no matter what. So that's how we've spent our life. Driving around following whatever clues dad came up with.'
Dean tenses. He kind of wants it, but he's also nervous. He chews on his lip, but Castiel waits patiently, starting to wash himself. The foam covers his body slowly and Dean stares.
Castiel reaches behind himself and grabs Wilson's crotch in what must be an iron grip, judging by the way Wilson's eyes almost pop out of the sockets.
'No, right now I'll be content with just you exploring my body,' replies Castiel, and it would sound like sarcasm or something mean from anyone else, but alpha just talks like that, even if it makes Dean feel embarrassed. And he's not wrong, that's
Still, three hours into the drive, after he's used all the excuses - looking at the small shops, the people, the cacti and the dry, twisted trees, the clouds and the white paint on the asphalt lane, counting the sheds and the cars they're passing by - finally, he places a shaking hand on Cas's thigh. Alpha glances at him, as if he's pulled out of some other reality, and blinks.
'Well, we were not Italian,' he replies with a crooked smile, hoping to turn this into a joke. Dean huffs out a perplexed laugh, as if he can't believe Castiel's sense of humor.
'You're my husband,' Castiel says and looks up at him, and his eyes are very very blue and kind. 'So of course, I'll tell you all about it, one day. But if you'd let me- I am having a good time right now, and I'd like to keep it that way.'
‘Is that right?’ Castiel asks, forcing himself to sound pensive, interested. He can feel Dean cast a panicked look at him, and he tries not to show that it hurts him.
Castiel tilts his head and squints, as if baffled by Dean's outburst. He's not taken aback, of course he's not. Dean's just a fucking omega. Never a threat.
that he does a good job as an omega. 'But I also know you've been through some shit, and I wanna know if
'Like, with honey and stuff. One of those yoga teas. Let yourself go and relax, that kinda stuff,' Dean crosses his arms nervously.
'This is awesome!' he tells alpha and glances at him, and then glances once more, cause Castiel watches him with such a fond expression, Dean wants to see it again.
'It turns you on,' Dean reminds him with a sheepish, teasing smile. He still feels unbalanced, but better. A lot better.
'I don't like leaving a mess,' Dean says, nervously rubbing his hands on his pants as he sits next to Castiel. 'I don't like it, it's - omegas shouldn't do that.'
'How about an angel?' he teases weakly, trying to grin. He feels and hears Castiel's skipped breath that's almost a laugh.
His hand brushes over a raised jagged scar just below his shirt collar, and Dean knows he sees it. There's a blossoming burst of sadness and self-hatred in his scent.
'You're a perv,' Dean rolls his eyes with a smile, and Castiel sucks on his neck and then kisses behind his ear, and Dean chuckles and attempts to push him away. They roll over on the bed and Castiel pins him down, and kisses him some more, aware that his morning stubble is tickling the omega. But his mate is laughing, laughing merrily and stupidly and he looks so cute, so beautiful, in the middle of Castiel's bed, he just can't let him go.
Dean thinks of what Alastair would say, of what he would do if he caught him opening the box, and even imagining him dead doesn't help. Maybe he could still teach him a lesson in a dream. With a knife.
'Me too,' Dean whispers, and takes off his pants. He feels nervous as he gets out, his clothes in the front seat, shuts the door and gets in the backseat. Castiel's watching him from the other side, throwing his clothes in the front seat as well. Dean's really thankful no one uses this road right now.
'What do you want to see first?' Cas asks him, still with that gentle smile. Dean's eyes dart around the place, suddenly uncertain.
Dean lifts the fork with a big bite of tortilla, meat and cheese, but then he hesitates and puts it back down. This is bad.
'You're so much more important than my project,' Castiel says, sternly. 'And my work, and everything else.'
Dean gives him a strained smile and nods. Castiel's not sure what's wrong. It might be the fact that they're both the least expensive dressed people in the room. Dean stands out the most, still too thin and pale. But somehow... he doesn't peg Dean as someone who would get so nervous about not being on a particular society level. He looks around to see if there are other omegas present. He sees some people in collars, and then... oh.
'Yes, you can keep it, idiot,' Alastair replied, rolling his eyes, as if he hadn't previously given him things only to take them away. Dean hugged the postcard to his chest.
He kept lying to himself that maybe later, maybe when Dean trusted him more, if they became really close, his past wouldn't matter that much. He would've already proven himself to the omega and the story wouldn't terrify him. But now - now's not the time to think about that, now Dean has to be safe. He has to send him away, and that won't be easy either, but he won't let another omega, his omega, get hurt because of his family. He shrugs Dean's hand off, putting some distance between them,
Castiel swerves to the right and hits the brakes. Dean lunges forward, luckily held by the seatbelt, and then hits the back of the seat with a thump. Alpha looks furious. Fuck.
The next morning starts slow. Dean can't wake up, barely alive after the previous night of baking cupcakes and then the incident from the evening. But alpha helps him up and nudges him into the shower. The cold water makes Dean yelp and then they're both apologizing; Dean for daring to complain and Castiel for not checking the temperature, and they end up wrapped around each other, kissing. Dean loves it. He can't think of a better way to start his morning.
Oh. Castiel freezes. Sam, as in Dean's brother, Sam? And Dean's telling him about Castiel's existence? Now, over a month since they're together, over a month since they mated?
'I'm bein' kind to myself,' Dean replies smoothly, patting his stomach. 'Had a nightmare. Got hungry.'
'You want to listen to more?' Castiel looks like he's counting on it, too, but it just never occurred to him Dean might offer it. Does he honestly think Dean wouldn't dig laying in bed, their hands together, listening to songs?
'You like that, don't you?' Castiel looks down at him, his fingers brushing through Dean's hair gently.
He stares at alpha, challenging, on the verge of breaking down, cause it's gonna hurt so bad. He's seen how Castiel gets when he's mad, he's seen how he talks to other mean alphas, and his eyes get dark like he wants to rip them apart. Dean doesn't know what's in store for him, but he's going to finally, finally find out, and there's a lot -
'Yeah,' Dean admits, putting it back. 'I just... I can't wait to listen to it again. Thanks so much, alpha.'
Besides, alpha's happy with him. He really is, he's said it so many times, not only now, and Dean has to believe it.
'I'm sorry,' Charlie's scent turns bitter and sad. 'You can try to scent mark him. It helps sometimes. Some alphas can't stand the stench of another alpha.'
Alpha's face splits into a grin and he bends down, kisses Dean deeply. Dean moans into it, grabs at alpha, tries to pull him even closer. When alpha draws back, his eyes are glistening with anticipation and energy, and he smells so excited. Dean's smiling shyly, his head spinning with the knowledge that they're really gonna do it, right here, right now, and he wants it so bad.
'Two are about a creepy doll,' Dean murmurs, staring at the smooth surface of the couch, because that's easier. 'One is about a killer nun.'
'No, sir,' Dean rushes to reply. 'I'm - I'm 39 years old. My first alpha was with me for twenty years, and I'm mated to alpha Novak for almost two months, now.'
'Dean, it's me,' Castiel announces and Dean doesn't feel terrified hearing his voice. He feels curious and alert, but that's all. About time to stop being afraid of his own shadow.
It was just one of his methods, but they worked. He was right, and Dean could see it, especially when he started having heats. No betas behaved like that, and somehow, the idea of him pretending to be above his social status really drove alphas crazy. Even back at the center, he was treated like a criminal when they discovered traces of the beta pills in his blood.
And he almost had it, too, he even turned on the goddamn nature show, hoping Castiel would join him and it would lead to some...
'You're so funny,' he says, and looks at Castiel for a moment, his eyes gleaming in the red neons, an easy smile on his face. Seemingly on a whim, he leans in and hugs Castiel tightly. He's tense, like always at first, but Castiel notices that the omega keeps initiating embraces and kisses all day, and he hopes it becomes a habit.
'How's your hand?' Castiel turns Dean's palm over, and runs his thumb over the bandaged wound. 'I see you changed it.'
Castiel grabs him by the throat, forces him to look at him. This is terrifying, everything is soaked in violence, Castiel's hands, Wilson's body, Dean's trembling form, the trashed office, the air they breathe. Dean's body may be scared, but seeing Wilson cower on the floor like Dean before, like Dean so many times before, seeing Wilson afraid-
'Are you excited for tomorrow?' Cas asks, when he's finally wrapping the pasta around his fork, and lifting it to Dean's mouth, because somewhere between kiss 107 and 121, alpha decided to feed them both. 'The cowboy town.'
He's frustrated with himself; all this planning, and the promising start of their evening, only to end up like this.
'Then just enjoy it, don't worry about it so much,' alpha pats his knee, his touch lingering for a moment, and then focuses back on the road. Dean's previous fear fades, but now he's nervous about Sam. He and alpha never even talked about that morning, and now it feels like everything's happening so quickly. Just yesterday he found out his brother is around, and now they're just gonna, what? Have some drinks and pretend everything's fine? Cause everything is
'Duh,' Dean mutters, rubbing a hand over his eyes. How can Cas seem so... unfazed, while Dean is having a total crisis? 'Cas, I've been thinking.'
'When I wasn't getting food for long, I could always eat one of these. Energy boost,' he smiles. 'They were free, so I got some whenever I saw them, for later. They really helped, especially post-heat. I'd get really weak, then.'
His heart calms some when he sees it's an actual shirt and jeans, and even underwear. He frowns picking it up, but that's great news. He puts it all on - even socks, which make him smile a little, cause they have a funny bear pattern on them. In fact, they look kinda worn out, and for a second Dean fantasizes that maybe they're alphas, not just from Goodwill, though he knows there's no way alpha would bring him his own clothes.
The kids forget Dean instantly and run after the guy, and Dean stands there, face burning and eyes watering, tucking his shaking hands underneath his armpits. He forgot what it feels like, to be so humiliated, to be treated like he's nothing. Cause that's what he is. Alphas give him purpose. If they say he matters, he matters. If they say he doesn't, he doesn't. How is he supposed to be his own person? He used to do that, back with dad. He wouldn't have backed out like now. He'd have said... something. Maybe he'll learn, but he doesn't think so. He doesn't think he'll ever feel like there's something to respect left inside him.
cool. I mean-' Dean fiddles with the bottom hem of his shirt, nervously. It hits him, suddenly, that he's a forty year old guy sitting in front of a stranger, excited about a walk in a park, and it makes him feel childish and small. Anyone can see he's dumb like Alastair had always said. 'I mean - we also did some other things. Like, we watched movies together, and cooked together. I mean - alpha offered. I can cook all the time, I promise, I did before, I know it's my job-'
Zachariah's eyes burn and he no longer appears careless. He seems to understand that Castiel won't budge.
'Choose any place you wish,' Castiel tells him and bares his neck, and Dean tenses up, nervous, because when he bit Alastair, he got smacked for doing it too hard. So he gently closes his teeth over the alpha's shoulder and bites, but it doesn't even break the skin. He can smell the alpha's confused and he feels like crying.
'That's fine, baby,' Castiel sends him a smile. 'Really. You needed your sleep. And I've learned how to cook thanks to you!'
'I don't know,' Dean replies, slowly, frightened. 'I was standing on the porch. I don't remember how I got there.'
This is a horrible mistake. Alpha told him to stay home, he should've stayed home. By leaving, he put himself in danger again. And maybe alpha will be super mad that he tries to visit him at work without telling him. Maybe if he called... maybe alpha doesn't want to be around him. He was angry when they parted ways. Maybe alpha doesn't want to look at him, now.
'I'll be okay,' Dean promises with a small smile. Castiel nods and lets his head fall back on the pillow.
'Your father chased your mother's killer?' Castiel asks, and Dean doesn't know how to interpret that voice.
‘I have to protect your slutty ass everywhere we go,’ Alastair says, tonelessly, finally turning around to face Dean. His eyes are gleaming in the dark, and he smells so possessive. Dean’s still trembling, like there’s electricity in his veins. He reeks of the alpha who’s just grabbed him, and he feels so unsteady. He wants to be held, in any way he’ll get, he wants to be comforted and assured that he’s safe.
So, without being told to do so, he strips. It’s both obedience and an invitation, he thinks. And when Alastair strides towards him purposefully, when he grabs him angrily and pushes him onto the bed, he welcomes the touch. Alastair might be staking his claim, but Dean wants to be claimed, too. He wants to forget the asshole from before and he wants to know he’s still wanted here, that he has his place.
breathing in, oh... that's safety, and protection, and just... Castiel. He feels his shaking subside a little.
'No, but we can sit by the kitchen table,' Castiel goes straight there and Dean follows him. The pizza is delicious, the tomato sauce rich and pepperoni well-cooked, and Dean can't help himself and devours it without any inhibitions. He even picks up the strings of cheese that cling to his plate and stuffs them in his mouth with the rest of it.
Castiel gets up and sits down next to him, and Dean burrows into his side in an instant. Alpha shushes him but Dean feels broken, he feels split open and raw, because that's - that's a new level even for Alastair. Playing him all these years, getting a sick kick out of Dean cowering away from a simple box, a box that held his own things. Laughing at whatever Dean imagined was inside. Threatening him with opening it -
broken the rules before. He didn't tell alpha right away when he was overwhelmed, so many times before. He didn't tell him when he scratched himself, at first. He didn't tell him when he was scared after their great sex, and he stayed up all night, baking. Alpha was kind of disappointed then, but not cause Dean did it; it was cause Dean didn't tell him he had a problem.
Luckily, alpha and Charlie are already saying their goodbyes, and they head outside. Dean follows hastily, hands buried in his pockets.
When Dean steps outside, confused, sad and terrified, Castiel feels like his body's vibrating with the need to call it all off and just hug him, despite what he's already decided to do, despite what he knows is logically better for him. He glances at him, just once, and Dean's looking at him, silently begging him to let him come back, and Castiel's chest aches so badly, he almost -
Dean's never really thought about it this way, how hard it must be for alpha to deal with someone like him. He thought about it from a different perspective, an omega one; that Castiel has to learn to live with such a broken mate, who doesn't know how to fulfill his expectation. But that's not it. It's hard for Castiel cause he wants to
'You don't have to,' Dean quickly assures him. Being the focus of Castiel's attention during sex would probably feel wrong.
Day six, he puts on the white suit and gets ready for his wedding. His hands tremble as he buttons up the vest and laces his shoes. There's no mirror, but he tries to comb his hair with his fingers. He had an obligatory shower in the morning, so he feels fresh, and that's definitely nice.
Castiel's still astonished hearing about the detailed plan Dean's carried out. They have to work out the money thing later on, but for now, he turns around and picks up a paper bag he brought from the shop.
Alpha nods and moves to go to the kitchen, but Dean holds onto him and leans in to whisper in his ear, panicked:
Dean can't even imagine what Alastair would've done if Dean was the reason he got kicked out of work. Living here, while much more complicated, is so, so much better. And yet - when Dean thinks of Alastair, watching them from above - from below? from behind Dean's shoulder? - he turns around, abruptly, but no one's in the backseat, of course not - when Dean thinks of him watching as he fucks up and as Cas, oh-so-patiently and gently tells Dean it's alright, and calms him down, and kisses him -
'Hey,' Dean grins. There's a slight awkward moment when Sam gets up, intending to hug Dean, and Dean's unsure whether he wants to be hugged. In the end he lets himself be pulled into the embrace and he pats Sam's back, embarrassed. Luckily it's over soon, and he slides into the booth, opposite his brother, by the window. Castiel flanks him, a little stiff in his place, but he offers a polite "Hello, Sam".
'Thanks so much for taking me here, alpha, and for taking this ride with me,' Dean mumbles into his coat. 'I love it!'
Castiel grimaces and shrugs awkwardly, and Charlie, a perky redhead who smells like an alpha but looks way too friendly to be one, notices Dean.
'Yeah,' Dean agrees, looking away. Feeling stupid. In the distance, a tiger is striding through the knee-high, lush, green grass. 'Is that fine? I can-'
After the presentation, Ketch says that he'll have to pass the project to other people to approve, but he begrudgingly admits that it's solid work. Hell yes it is! Dean feels so happy for alpha. And when Ketch leaves, Charlie, Garth, Benny and Jody all cheer and high five each other, and Castiel watches them with a wide smile.
'Alpha turned off the omega filter,' Dean explains. 'So I googled you, obviously. Found your number, but I - I don't know, dude. I wasn't sure if I should call you.'
He feels like he should be packed in the trunk of the car instead, dehydrated and beaten up. He feels like he should cower in the front seat, waiting for Cas to do his stuff, while other alphas leer at him and call him things. He feels like he should stay home to clean and cook while Cas goes on this big roadtrip to find himself, all on his own.
'Well, he did get a small sentence at first,' Sam explains. 'Since they couldn't pin much on him. But he escaped to find you, even though he had no idea where you were. They kept finding him and putting him back, just in more secure prisons time and time again. When I got to him, he had it rough already. But as his lawyer, I managed to get it reduced to five years. Soon as I told him about the Alastair meeting, about how he treated you, he bolted again. I
'I, please just, your mouth or your hand, but please do something,' Dean begs into his ear, and Castiel realizes he's been stalling for too long. With how reluctant his mate is to say anything, he might've been kissing him much longer with Dean subtly moving underneath him, holding back as long as he can. It probably shouldn't be as hot as it is.
Castiel smiles a little as he reheats yesterday's pancakes. It would be good to meet up with her. It's Saturday, so he knows he has to be back at work on Monday, and he'd love to chat with her before that. Maybe about Dean. Just maybe. They still have to survive two full days together, and he'll have plenty of chances to mess something up. But he's happy with how things turned out during the night. He thinks he gained a little bit more of Dean's trust. And Dean seemed to relax, too.
'I'm just glad something good came out of my sudden escape from the house,' he says, painfully honest. He still feels... stupid, about that. He had the right to lose his composure, he knows that, with Dean getting assaulted and Zachariah betraying his trust and blackmailing him, and with his father -
He turns around and exits, without waiting for a reply, leaving Dean rooted to the spot. So that's what this was about. Some people were simply good like that, and have helped him out with small favors during his time at Alastair's. Be it a cold drink on a hot day, a chocolate bar slipped into his pocket by a pitying clerk, a painkiller from that one beta woman on the bus... They were always Dean's personal angels. He didn't have a chance to tell the man that he has a full-time angel now, and
they would come for me, he knew I wasn't cut out to be an omega, I - not that I'm bad now, it turned out - I was wrong. I was wrong, I didn't mean to say that. I'm a very good omega. I swear-'
'Let's get these and go,' he says, eager to explore the city. His excitement comes back. 'I wanted to do the museum thing first. There should be a gun show...'
He looks to the side, humiliated and tense, sure that alpha's going to get mad now. Alright, maybe he doesn't mind Dean being vocal, but alphas like omegas submissive, not gripping them possessively.
'What? No,' Dean can't believe he's thinking that. 'The uh, the opposite. I'm sorry, I'll shut up. Can we keep going? Please. I'll be good.'
'Just a little,' Dean murmurs, and it's good that he said the truth, cause alpha leans across the table, almost knocking over the salt shaker, and kisses him on the cheek.
'I-' Dean swallows, thinking of what to say. Why is nothing ever easy with Cas? God. 'Why do you have to make everything so hard, Cas? Why can't I just blow you like a normal person?'
Dean didn't know it's been a full month. He remembers they got married on April 2nd, but has no clue what day is it today. A Sunday? Alpha's said he has to go back to work tomorrow.
He shrugs for the third time, fidgets in his seat. God, he just wants to leave. He's so tired of talking.
'Yeah, I know you are,' Dean murmurs. 'But it's all you, Cas. If not for everything you told me - if not for you showing me that I can do things, and I can want things, and I should, I...'
'I'm so sorry for leaving you out there,' Castiel breaks the silence, as they near the exit to the parking lot. 'You were supposed to be safe with the collar on.'
The presentation goes on for a long, long time, but it's mostly enjoyable with how alpha easily handles all the traps that Ketch sends his way, and manages to stay perfectly calm. He advertises the project in such a way that Dean'd buy it even though he still has no idea what it does. Castiel's clearly super smart, and super capable, and with how he describes the precautions they took during the development stage, Dean's sure he'd call him whenever his laptop broke. Maybe he'd even break it on purpose just to listen to that deep, assertive voice when alpha plugs in some cables or whatever. Of course, they're mates, so he doesn't have to, and that's so much better.
? But before he pushes back against his body, ass to alpha's cock, alpha just reaches over his shoulder and lifts something in the fridge.
to resolve this once and for all, or he'll never feel... real again. Alpha doesn't get mad if Dean does things that would make Alastair furious. Swearing, check. Physical resistance, check. Hiding, questioning orders, shirking responsibilities. Being rude. Being clingy. Wanting selfish things just for himself, like the funfair rides or jerking off. Nothing works. So Dean thinks back to the times alpha got so murderously angry. The guy at the shop, who touched Dean. The guy at the fair, who made some crude comments. Ketch, who called Dean an "it". But most of all, Dean himself, trying to leave the house without the collar and calling himself a piece of shit.
Dean sits and stares at it. He has a phone and he's sure he'd be able to e-mail him as well, maybe even without alpha's help. There's enough tutorials on the Web.
'Stop thinking so much, alpha,' Dean pleads, putting his hands flat on Castiel's knees. 'Don't worry, I'll get you in the mood.'
'I didn't mean it like that,' alpha continues, upset. 'That's why I bought so much. I want you to eat as much as you want.'
He picks it up and stares at it. He's not sure if he's even seen his name written like that, anywhere. Sometimes it's easy to forget that he has Castiel's surname.
But he's greeted with a sight of Dean, standing sheepishly next to the bed, holding a big plate of - something. It smells good, though. Pancakes?
'Of course,' Castiel replies, gently, and Dean thinks he knows, he thinks he knows this is not entirely about coffee flavors, he knows that this is about Dean liking things that are not meant for omegas but also liking things that are meant for them, and liking things in general. And he's okay with... all of it.
There's a pause. Was the honorific wrong? He should address her by her designation, but he doesn't know it, he just feels so helpless.
Dean relaxes at that. He must be exhausted after all the stress and crying, and he pulls the second blanket over himself.
'Well, your touch is definitely welcome,' sighs Castiel, hugging him close. Dean rests his head on his shoulder, inhales the scent of safety that he's grown to love so much. 'Your face, Dean, you're so beautiful.'
He examines the omega a moment longer, but he's lost in whatever's going on on the screen. Or he's trying to make it look like it. Either way, it's the only escape Dean has, so Castiel doesn't continue the topic. He probably needs some space. He gives Dean's hand a squeeze and promises to come back to put him to bed when he's done.
Dean looks up, even as Castiel leaves his place by the kitchen table to go stir the sauce and the meat.
. 'Dad warned us about it all our life, he taught us, he protected us. But I just had to be smarter than that. I went away and I had Jess killed. He even set the house on fire and - just like mom.'
Castiel startles. No matter how often Dean asks this, the bluntness still catches him off guard. And it has been more than forty times by now, he's sure of it, if one counts all the oral sex and the handjobs. Dean likes both, but most of all, he likes being "pounded", as he puts it, in the middle of Castiel's big bed, needy and demanding and rude. Castiel'd much rather they've exchanged sweet words, and explored each other more. But Dean doesn't like foreplay, he doesn't like "being coddled". He likes encouraging the alpha with challenging commands, never pleas. Castiel tried to take it slow only to have Dean force the pace and borderline demean him if he doesn't go as fast as he's able.
'Yeah,' Dean agrees out of habit, but it's true, he hasn't thought about that. The punishment center was always a grim distant threat hanging over his head, but if Castiel doesn't send him and he doesn't run away, with a little luck, he might never have to visit it again. The thought is new and relieving, but still kind of unbelievable. 'But the check-up? You gotta take me to the yearly check-up. It's the law.'
For the past twenty years, there was an easy routine, sure. But Alastair himself was always unpredictable, and Dean remembers it, remembers the fear and the pain that it caused, but he still longs to be back, sometimes. Something rustles and he glances down; it's the Snickers wrapper, crushed in his clenched fist, and just like that, things are clear again. With Castiel, everything is complicated beyond belief, but he's still the exact opposite of Alastair. He's warm and honest, and kind and, since Dean got to know him, much more predictable. Like now, Dean knows what will happen after he says:
When he finally admits it, he thinks it's so quiet, alpha won't hear, but alpha does. It only frustrates him more. Or turns him on? Sometimes it's hard to tell.
He finds Dean by the kitchen table, sitting cross-legged on the bench, eating a candy bar. Three empty wrappers lie next to it. The overhead lamp basks Dean in a yellow glow, and it looks cozy - the kitchen, the table, Dean in his underwear and a T-shirt looking up levelly when Castiel enters the room.
'Okay,' Dean agrees, thinking he finally gets it, just a little. It's like all the times he's run; Cas just feels like he has to get away, like he has to escape. That's fine by Dean. As long as they're together.
'Okay,' Dean hesitates, but then holds out his hand and lays it across the table in silent invitation. Castiel grabs it instantly, like a lifeline. 'Sorry I'm like this. Maybe I'm just tired.'
The word is strange in Castiel's mouth, in his gravelly, serious voice, as were the curses from before, but holy shit does it get Dean going. Alpha seems to be aware of that, too, a smirk tugging at his lips.
Maybe he can't leave, though. Maybe it wasn't a marriage out of love that's gone sour; maybe it was one of the old-fashioned business arrangements.
That's what omegas do. That's what he's doing. He's been saying that he's scared of getting hurt, that he prefers to go slow, but now he's throwing himself at the man. He feels a little disgusted, even though he's doing what he wants.
'Now, you can only listen to music on the radio, right? From your CDs,' alpha explains patiently, tapping something on his phone. A window pops up smoothly. 'This application - program, or whatever you want to call it - is like a music library online. You can listen and save whatever you want to.'
Dean thinks it can't sound convincing, not after he's just revealed that he doesn't know the meals here. Even if it's exotic, maybe if he tried harder - alpha clearly likes it. Maybe he could try and reproduce that at home...
The delivery is horrible cause by the end of it, his face scrunches in a sob, and he hides his face in Castiel's shoulder, hugging him tightly.
'Yeah, Dean, I did,' Sam sat up as well, turned around to face him, determined. 'And she said it would be fine. She said we can come over anytime, and that her and uncle Bill are gonna take care of us until I finish school.'
'He got arrested soon after he left that motel,' Sam explains softly. 'We thought the, uh-' he glances at alpha, and Dean follows his gaze, lost, '- the man we were searching for, he knew dad was coming, and sent the cops after him to get away on time. They found the - you know, the unlicensed guns and the stash of fake IDs. They linked dad to some of the crimes, but they didn't have enough proof to keep him there for long.' Another uncomfortable glance at alpha. 'Dean, I really think we should talk in private-'
They reach the end of the store and he sees what they've probably come here for - whole rows of CDs and vinyl. He feels a surge of excitement.
'Really?' Dean's so pleased, he can't help a smile that spreads across his face. 'I mean, I'm trying-'
'Cause they don't want any trouble if they listen to an omega before you agree to it,' Dean guesses, glancing at Sam for confirmation. 'Right?'
'Dean used to swap my shampoo for Nair,' he says with a pained expression. Alpha glances at him, surprised? Probably.
Alpha smiles, and then prepares, leaving Dean at the table to rip his bread into small pieces and chew them lazily. He's so tired, a nap sounds great, but he's gonna miss alpha. Is he supposed to just sit around all day? He could watch movies. It's never been a problem before, but only because he didn't miss Alastair when he was left alone, and he had no other options. He'd been bored out of his mind, sure, but everything had to be spotless, dinner perfect, sometimes some other errands done. It was stressful and he had to do it just right to avoid punishment. Often things hurt enough that he didn't even dream of going out and was grateful if he could rest for a moment. Alastair had never been consistent, too. Sometimes he was gone for days on end, not telling him anything. He rarely had fixed work hours. With Castiel there's routine, but there's also a taste of normal life, of going out, and it's harder to stay at home now.
Castiel gets up, fetches lube. Dean puts a pillow under his hips and positions himself so that he's comfortable. Alpha sits on his heels like the night before and watches him for a moment. Dean's dick is curving up and smearing pre-come on his stomach from just the kisses and alpha's hungry gaze. Dean wonders if with this alpha, he could ever come untouched.
Dean looks at him searchingly, his green eyes unmoving and set on his face like Castiel's a riddle that Dean's trying very hard to solve. Finally, he huffs.
of a scary house is to scare you. It was like in the movies! Come on, you gotta admit, alpha, it was creepy.'
'I've walked around first, for a good hour, just like, thinking about stuff. What you said, like, me being happy, and going to the motel - that wouldn't have made me h-appy,' his voice cracks. 'But it's your work. And I want
, he wants to say, but doesn't. He doesn't know why, but he feels like reverting to the way he was when they first met. Not entirely, but it gives him some sense of safety.
at him when he glances back. He has to grip the steering wheel because this... is odd. He feels like punching something, hard, and also like leaning across the seat to kiss Dean so long he'll be too breathless to ever utter yet another flippant remark.
. What's better, alpha clings to him and he keeps kissing him, nuzzling his hair. Dean reaches out, blindly, and Castiel grasps his hand. Dean pulls it to his chest and squeezes it tight.
'I don't see it happen too often, but alphas do bring their mates to work,' Castiel replies as they're going down the stairs. 'I never interacted with the omegas, as you know, but I've seen them around. They also visit to bring lunch or forgotten documents, but some just come over for company. That is how I know that their alphas are decent people. There have never been any issues with omegas, here, and I'm confident my bosses wouldn't allow anything improper. Essentially, it's up to alphas if they decide to come with their mates, because it is considered a part of their private life. Unless the omegas are really distracting, but that's just theory. I've never seen a loud omega.'
'Not much,' he admits. 'As I told you, I've worked in this company for the majority of my life. I did leave on some work trips, before, but not many. My family's from Idaho, that's where I lived when I was younger.'
'Man, here I was thinking you were gonna hate me. You waited for me to come and rescue you while I took years to do it,' Sam says, finally. 'Turns out you weren't waiting at all.'
Castiel tears his eyes away from the live band - a group of elderly, obviously expert men in smocks - and looks at his mate. Dean doesn't look happy anymore, he looks overwhelmed and out of place, taking everything in. For the first time in a while, it feels like sitting there with a stranger.
Well, Castiel wasn't going to complain. It gave him another excuse to hug Dean and take care of him. His omega has been so open and honest with him the entire evening. It's only been a few days, but their progress astonishes Castiel. In his wildest dreams he's never expected to experience so many new emotions and really bond with the abused omega he's welcomed into his home a month ago.
'It's nice,' he says, and he's not really lying, cause it's not his scene, but it's obvious someone's put a lot of effort into the place.
Dean's face gets all red and he rubs the nape of his neck with his free hand. He smells embarrassed. Why? Castiel frowns. Perhaps the choice of words was unfortunate. Was he too blunt?
'Screw you. Do you still like theatre?' Dean asks. He knows what Sam's doing; he's making this getting-to-know-eachother thing a reality, but damn him, Dean's curious.
'Dean!' he calls out. He instantly hears his mate running up the stairs and he stops in the doorway, scared.
Dean flinches so hard, he hits Castiel's desk, the smirk and the happy air around him gone in an instant, replaced by fear so palpable that Castiel doesn't need his scent to feel it.
himself into Dean, he fills the spaces in his body he called dirty, violated. He gives pieces of himself so that Dean never feels alone or scared again. On the outside, though, Dean's body is just a body. Hard and unyielding, and trembling. This isn't something that can be fixed. 'The Dean from before Alastair, who was free and daring. The Dean who was Alastair's husband, who knew that his only way of survival was pleasing any and all alphas. And the Dean from now,' he says, guiding Dean's head to the crook of his neck. He wants his mate to smell how he feels. Gutted, loving, accepting. 'What are you now?'
'Dean, I am so sorry that happened to you,' he says, his voice strong and earnest. Dean starts a little and glances up at him, surprise written all over his face. 'I knew your alpha hurt you, but this is beyond what I imagined. That should never have happened.'
It's not the same daring voice from before; it's weak, and he can see fear in Dean's eyes, clear as day. And then, a little stalled, in his scent. God, he hates the fear scent.
'Listen, I can't make it to the tutoring class,' he says, wringing his hands. 'Somethin' came up. But don't kick me out. My next paper will be fine.'
His voice sounds a little off, a little desperate and apprehensive. He must be feeling uncertain about his small technology knowledge. Castiel doesn't want him to feel inferior or undereducated.
'Alpha,' Dean sighs. 'This shit - it's gonna keep happening. I'm sorry everytime it happens, but I can't help it. But I don't want - I don't want it to ruin our day everytime it happens. I think that maybe if we just let it be, it'll go away one day,' he sounds wistful and Castiel knows he doesn't believe it, but he's proud that Dean offers a solution and talks about recovery. 'I haven't told you, but the dreams with Alastair... there are nights when I don't have them anymore. Not many, but...' Dean smiles. 'I mean, for example, last night... I dreamt about you.'
The room is dingy, but the sheets seem clean. Dean has time to notice that, while Alastair drops the keys on the table and takes off his shoes. In the tense, loaded silence, Dean knows what’s coming. He stands in front of the bed, watching closely as Alastair tugs the belt out of the loops in his trousers, and brings it down onto the table. It snaps loudly, making Dean flinch out of his skin. He feels a rush of -
'What do you dislike about me?' Dean asks, a little teasingly, but really he's curious. Maybe he should've asked what alpha
A tired, unpleasant chill goes through Dean; that's an order, and he doesn't like it, and he's scared and weary. But he's not gonna fight it. It takes him a moment to do his business, hyper aware of Castiel being just outside of the door. When he's done, he also quickly brushes his teeth, happy to make his mouth feel fresh again. True to his word, Castiel doesn't peek inside, and he also doesn't make a move on Dean as they're laying back in bed minutes later. They're sleeping back to back, with some space between them, as they typically do.
'Hey, I'm gonna hit the can,' he tells alpha, and pushes at him until Castiel lets him through. He can't leave yet, because alpha grabs his wrist (gently).
The radio plays some pop songs, but it's turned down and acts as background noise. Dean admires the streets they slowly pass by, even though he can't see that much due to the rain. They're going downhill and some of the city uncovers in front of him; it's a beautiful sight. He loves taking that road to the shop.
Castiel just glances at them, though, because he's busy watching Dean closely. He's still upset, and his sour scent makes Dean wrinkle his nose.
Dean tells him to move, but he does it so slowly. 'Faster,' he pleads, and the hand strokes him with more energy, now, but not too hard. Dean bites his lip because he doesn't want to be loud, but the struggle must show on his face, because Castiel just tells him to let go. So he tries, and soon, his quiet, still somewhat restrained moans and huffs fill the bathroom. He keeps looking at Castiel but alpha levels him with a stare so intense, it almost hurts to endure it. Castiel rubs his thumb over the head and Dean jerks, his eyes flutter closed.
Or maybe Sam just never bothered to look. Maybe he accepted that Dean had an alpha now, and that was enough for him. Maybe he thought Dean was happy or at least... that it was right, him having an alpha, like he used to believe.
'I brought Dean with me today,' alpha continues, and Dean must smell nervous, because he wraps his arm around him and hugs him to his side. Like before, when they were having that video call at the house and Dean interrupted, he remembers. The alphas come closer, but Benny and Charlie are chatting, so he doesn't feel awkward. Dean flinches hard into Castiel's side when Garth holds out a hand for him to... shake?
'Well, either way,' mother clears her throat. 'If you accept the terms, you have to sign it. We have driven in a van and have a cage ready, for your omega -'
‘Yeah, but don’t take it out on Dean,’ Zachariah holds out a hand, intending to pat Dean on the shoulder, but Dean takes a step back. ‘He can’t help it, he’s an omega. Maybe you should spoil him a little more - looks like he's trying to create some drama, huh, champ? You made it all up, told Castiel that Wilson wanted more, to rile him up? It is nice to see a jealous alpha fight for you, I’ll give you that. But I can’t have it happen here, Dean, so how about you tell your alpha the truth?’
He doesn't say anything else, but understanding dawns on Castiel's face. He grabs one end of the duvet that they're laying on and covers Dean with it. Dean's thankful for the layer he can hide underneath.
'You can touch me,' Castiel huffs out, impatient, grabbing Dean's hand and bringing it back to his chest. He starts moving again, and Dean hesitantly traces his skin with his fingers while he's still going slow-slow-slow. In and almost completely out, and it's adding to the pleasure building low in Dean's stomach. Alpha's so soft to touch, with no bumps and scars, his skin pristine. He's starting to sweat and Dean loves the smell of it, the scent of their arousal combined.
'Your friend sounds cool,' the omega says, taking the first bite while Castiel puts on the movie. It's exactly what he's described he likes, back at the shop - the long pasta with tomato sauce and minced meat.
'Yeah,' he admits, shutting his eyes and resting his head on alpha's shoulder. Alpha takes the empty cup from him and throws it in the paper bag, and embraces him. His hand is rubbing soft circles into Dean's back, and he melts into the touch. The hand goes further down with each circle, and Dean shudders when it reaches his waistband.
He was stupid. What's new? But alpha doesn't get it. At least now, Dean knows what he acts like when he's mad. There's no pain, but there is shame. Shame at not being whatever alpha wants him to be, and that's... probably the issue.
call the punishment center, and I fear there would be nothing I'd be able to do to save you from punishment,' Castiel explains in a serious voice. 'You getting hurt is one of my biggest fears, Dean. You know that. That's why I need you to look out for yourself, as well.'
'Yeah,' Dean nods, and then Charlie talks and talks and talks, and asks him questions, and in no time alpha's back, right when they're discussing possible alternative attacks on the Death Star.
'So,' Castiel starts, fighting to find words. He hopes to God they will be correct. 'You're telling me you've never had an alpha be with you through your heat?'
'Yes,' Castiel looks away for a moment, Dean can see it from the corner of his eye. 'I've never experienced it before, but I promise you, I never get aggressive. I just feel a lot of... sudden... desire. And I feel like...'
'So I guess you still do that, huh,' Sam nudges him with his pointy fucking elbow. 'Good to know some things don't change.'
'Good,' Castiel leads them to the alpha section and they can pick practical, sturdy clothes - some more t-shirts in different colors, more plaid and some other overshirts, a hoodie and a sweater, one more pair of jeans. 'Does this mean you used to wear alpha clothes
'Do you think we could turn it on?' he starts saying again, and distantly, he knows he already asked, he knows he's repeating himself, but he can't stop, he doesn't feel so good. 'Do you-'
'I had to go,' he whispers, immediately looking down and starting to shake. He hates himself for it, but it's just his body reacting on autopilot, nowadays.
Suddenly, he hears music - music he knows by heart. He startles and looks back; Castiel's put on his CD and sets the volume high enough that they can listen to it from where they sit, but can also talk uninterrupted. Dean smiles widely at him.
'Oh, Mrs. Miller sends her get well wishes,' he mentions, suddenly remembering. Dean's hand trembles and some water spills, but not much. The man pales.
'Tomorrow, when I come back from work, we could watch a game show on TV,' Castiel says randomly. 'I like Jeopardy, but we can pick something you like.'
'Thank you,' he says, wholeheartedly. 'I really like these clothes,' it doesn't sound like a fact good enough, so he continues: 'I've never been to a place like this. I've seen them from the outside, they just look so huge.'
'This is delicious, Dean,' Charlie tells him. 'Later, when we're done with the meeting, I can show you around, if you'd like. The library, my cubicle, the canteen...'
'You will need to inhale this,' Castiel hands him the same mug from before, filled to the brim with hot steaming water. Dean tries to take it, but his hands shake so much, he ends up spilling some on himself.
'I didn't know what to think, okay?' Dean cuts in quietly, cause he doesn't wanna hear Sam get angry anymore, doesn't want to fight. 'Tried not to think about it at all. You, dad... all of it.'
Castiel watches him with rapt attention, the packet of pasta in his hand forgotten. Dean drops his eyes. How much can he overshare?
'I can't do it when you just - stand there!' Dean complains. It's like that time he was sick and alpha didn't let him close to the door.
Castiel agrees with her, he does. As hard as it is and as worried (scared) as he is to go home and face Dean, and keep facing him for the next who-knows-how-many years, he can't imagine abandoning him. He'd lay in bed at night and wonder if Dean's laying somewhere too, hurt and cold and crying, or having nightmares with no one to hold him, or looking down at his scarred body and having his new alpha belittle and humiliate him.
(Speaking of being proud, alpha did tell him he was proud of him, once. It was when Dean told him that he doesn't wanna have sex. The weirdest thing to be proud of, but it happened.)
'You and me and the car,' Dean mumbles, and somehow, it must be the best thing to say, cause Castiel's smile grows and it's startled and surprised. His scent changes too.
'Yeah,' Dean thinks of dad. Safe is illusive. He could never afford to feel safe. Dad's always said, watch out for alphas, assume everyone is always out to get you. Learn how to fight. Learn how to never let your guard down. Learn how to avoid the law, and how to never trust anyone. He was right, all of it fit the life they lived, all of it helped him survive for years, with dad going out of his way to get him beta scent pills, or alpha scent pills for himself, to pass as Dean's alpha after he turned eighteen. Their life was never safe, so Dean's never even thought about making
Dean just smiles. He thinks about the future they have ahead of them - actually accompanying Castiel and seeing him somewhere else than at home, like at work-
'It's up to you,' Castiel shrugs and moves away to sit beside Dean on the bed. Dean doesn't think he's aware that it only riles Sam up even more. Dean chooses to remain silent. Hopefully forever.
He finally settles on a burger and fries, but as he loads them on his plate, a staff member comes over to add more food and opens his mouth, preparing to scold him. Castiel saves him, blissfully unaware of it, picking that moment to come over and dump some salad on his plate.
'Dean, Dean,' sighs Alastair, pretending to be disappointed. He's inches away from him, now, and slams his hand on the door just by Dean's right ear, making him jump and whimper. 'I thought we've been through this. You're incorrigible.'
'He was,' Sam agrees. 'And he's dead. And after I caught him, I made that mistake. I finished college, was about to pass the state bar exam to become an attorney to help you, to help dad, when I got a match in the system. I've gone through hundreds of rockstar aliases, I can never listen to your music again,' he offers the tiniest of smiles, and Dean returns it.
It's both a question and a threat. Despite his failures, Dean has no doubts that Sam is able to ruin alpha's life and wrestle Dean back, or die trying.
'I told you to ask questions. I told you to ask anything if you don't understand,' Castiel berates him and Dean feels so small and worthless. 'I can't have you risk your health for me because you think you're pleasing me when you cannot understand a thing I say!'
So Dean doesn't ask and empties the entire mug in one go. He thinks this intake of caffeine is going to make him too jittery, but he's not gonna question alpha. And the satisfied way Castiel watches him as the puts down the empty mug makes something flutter in his stomach. It's stupid, it's not even been an order, but Dean feels omega-good because he did what alpha asked and now alpha's happy with him.
'This is the Zero-One Quarter, as some like to call it,' announces Castiel when they drive through a district of the city that seems to comprise solely of modern glass buildings, in many shapes and forms, but mostly towering over the other houses outside of the 'quarter'.
Dean does. He steps into Cas's embrace again. They stand there for what feels like eternity, and Castiel doesn't even know where to start, what to say; but holding Dean close feels good. It doesn't fix anything, he knows that, rationally; but it feels like if he holds him close enough, he can protect him from the whole world.
'Bisbee, think it was Arizona,' Dean grins. Castiel reaches their booth and sits down, but doesn't say anything, just listens. 'Man, thought dad was gonna kill us. But we really wanted somethin' special for our Thanksgiving. It was all cause of your bitchin' about that beta girl from your class who invited you-'
'Easy, Big Pete doesn't like to be squished, alright guys?' the worker asks but he's smiling, and the kids gasp in terror when Big Pete - an ugly yellow beast - tightens itself around the guy's neck. 'He likes to play,' the guy jokes, and Dean thinks he's gonna throw up, but then... there's something he's about to do. He's going to do it, for alpha, for himself, to be his own person. His hands shake, but he already talked to some people before, and the zoo girl was nice, so maybe...
'It's supposed to start in ten minutes,' one of the betas, an older man with a camera, says. He's wearing a Boulderplains T-shirt and cowboy pants, but he still looks every bit like a tourist. 'We hope it's as good as the one in Florida. We visit
The question is hesitant and loaded with anxiety, and Castiel shuts his eyes in exasperation. He told Dean to stay in bed a million times, but he still wants to tumble down the stairs half-conscious so that Castiel can stay glued to his laptop. God forbid the alpha is disturbed, right?
'What are you, my mother?' Dean scoffs and shakes off whatever he was feeling just seconds ago when he jumped away from the car. 'Missed my bus. See you on Monday.'
'I wish we could just drive,' he says out of nowhere, excited, just cause he wants to share this. 'Like, you know, pedal to the metal, you and me, see the world, get away from other alphas and training centers and all that shit. Just drive, and not stop for miles.'
and Castiel wants to say something but he doesn't know what, his mouth open, throat working, and finally
Not now, though. Now, he's just annoyed at the traffic. They get stuck in another queue of cars and he sighs deeply.
Dean opens his mouth to protest, to tell him that it doesn't matter, because he's the one who should watch out for himself, but Castiel just raises an eyebrow at him and that makes him stop. He gulps and looks away.
'I think this calls for a viewing of a western movie,' Cas announces, flicking through the channels. There's built-in Netflix on this motel's TV, because why not? Dean thinks, pulling the soft,
-agitated. 'He traveled some, but never told me where and almost never took me with. It wasn't even any great places, when I did go with him. Some shady roadside bars, or huge cities, where I'd stay in the car or in the motel, anyway. For almost twenty years, I pretty much lived in the same house.'
'I think an omega doing it at all is pretty improper,' he replies seriously. 'I'd never do it in our bed.'
'You're just jealous cause no one tried to get in yours,' Dean laughs. 'Jaime did make the best burritos. Mmm.' He gazes ahead, longingly. He hadn't thought of that in a long, long time. 'But still, tacos at alpha's place, holy shit man. You tried? You work there too, after all. Or pretend to.'
, but like... oh my god, I can't believe you're such a prude about this. How does Dean react to it? Does he enjoy it?'
'Look, I'm not gonna freak out, you can ask me questions,' he snaps way more harshly than he intended. 'I'm gonna tell you everything, cause I have to, you're my alpha.'
'Be careful,' alpha tells him, but releases his hand. Dean finds the omega bathroom, trying to ignore both alpha and Sam's eyes boring holes into his back, he can just feel it.
It's a little cooler outside, in the evening; there's less people around as well. Dean likes that a lot. They head to the cinema first, but it turns out that the last seance was at five.
'I can still fix cars?' asked Dean, looking at dad, careful not to cry. Only babies cried, but he was feeling especially lousy that day. Dad's big dark eyes were so sad then, but he smiled at him and hugged him close, and said 'I'd like to see anyone stop you, kiddo', and no one did. Not until he met Alastair. Dad kept his promises for as long as he could.
'So, what's he like? I already know he's all gooey for you, man, that's awesome,' Garth grins and sits down next to him. Castiel stifles a sigh.
'Which one?' Dean feels like a ticking bomb, ready to blow up, restless and mad and needing to get out.
'I was just gonna tell Dean about your grand performance at Becky's,' Charlie teases a little weakly, and Castiel groans. Dean perks up, interested.
'Use it to get yourself somethin' to eat on the way to your mate, huh?' The man's voice is surly, but his eyes are kind under his thick grey eyebrows. 'You're skin n' bones, kid.'
And when they have sex, he kisses Castiel softly, sometimes, or squeezes his hand, like it means something.
Maybe it's the way he says it, or Dean's just wrung out, he doesn't know; but he unlocks the door and slides back on his ass, staring up at Castiel when he opens the door.
'Alright, here's a list we could use,' Castiel doesn't make it awkward, though, and Dean's grateful. Alpha keeps coming up with some really cool solutions like a true problem-solver, and he makes them work cause he's patient and doesn't give up. Currently, he's handing Dean his phone and Dean squints at the questions.
So Castiel stops in his tracks. Dean's wary, but he looks relieved once the alpha focuses on him. He doesn't seem to be phased by the other man's horrible remarks, more like - it's more like he doesn't
'Don't make presumptions,' Castiel shakes his head. 'I don't think your father was crazy. But it's certainly a lot to digest.'
The waitress brings their plates and Dean thinks his pasta isn't half bad. Charlie makes him laugh when she pokes at the - fingered citron, who the hell came up with that name - but she says it tastes okay. The best part, though, is definitely alpha keeping his hand on his thigh through the whole meal, and then feeding him a piece of the freaky green geometric thing. It's served with almonds and garlic and it doesn't taste like anything Dean knows.
The hardware store is next up. Dean doesn't know what they're looking for here, but he quickly forgets about it cause there's a lot of interesting stuff, anyway. He examines the different phones, tablets and laptops. He's seen it in real life, of course, or on TV, but... the isolation did its part. He doesn't have much idea about electronics nowadays; when he joined Alastair, he had a Nokia which was taken away promptly. Its most exciting feature was the snake game, and now phones are like mini computers. Well, computers are kind of confusing too. They look nothing like the ones Dean remembers using and he's lost when he has to browse the Internet on the new ones.
Back home, Dean looks relieved to get the new pills, and Castiel intentionally leaves the whole instruction out on the nightstand, so he can read through it if he wants to. Just to make sure he's not being lied to.
But it makes working harder, and he resorts to plugging his headphones in and putting on some music. He doesn't have vast music knowledge. His family raised him on classical but he hates being reminded of his family, so he rarely listens to Rossini or Brahms anymore. Instead, he has a small selection of his favourite independent bands, and it's what he picks now. He realizes he's feeling more optimistic and calm than he had in weeks. Three weeks, to be exact. Ever since Dean arrived.
Dean didn't want to believe that it was anything else than an equivalent to an engine tune-up. Make sure he doesn't break down too often, can function okay, and when he does get weak or sick or whatever, fix him asap.
Even water costs more than his regular everyday dinner. He flips through the pages, doing a double take at the price of main courses. That's almost his weekly salary.
'That's too bad,' he says, mock-concerned and Dean frowns. 'Because as it turns out, all I want to do to you is make you happy. Do you think I'm allowed to do that?'
it,' Dean spits out the word, and then clears his throat. 'Uh, anyway. Yesterday, I...  I just wanted to make you happy. But also, I feel like...'
'Help me,' Dean pants into the phone, hands like claws biting into his knees, his frantic breath fogging up the phone's screen. 'Help me help me help me-'
Alpha makes a soft sound and his lips part, so Dean takes it as a sign to kiss him some more. Alpha grabs at him and pulls him closer, and Dean ends up half-sitting, half-kneeling on the bed, pressed against him. His mouth is warm and his hands have a solid grip on his back, and they move and move and move, under the shirt, up his spine, and Dean shudders and lets out a tiny
They try another stand, and the omega hits all the targets, again. It's the last shooting stand at the fair, and Castiel can't help but drink in Dean's confident stance, long lines of his body, his ruffled hair and his focused face, eyes sharp and mouth set in a thin line just before he fires. The neon lights behind Dean make him seem like he's out of this world, this strong, handsome man in a feracious glow of a thousand blinding lights, and he's all Castiel's to keep, to protect, to love.
‘No,’ Castiel shakes his head. ‘Dean didn't let himself be baited and didn't go to the motel,' the note of pride is evident in his voice, and he doesn't even try to hide it. 'He told me everything. It happened between three and four. There are cameras on the corridor outside - you may check it, use it as a basis.’
'I didn't,' Sam promises, and for the life of him, Dean can't tell if he's telling the truth. It sounds so certain, sounds exactly right, exactly innocent and regretful, just perfect enough not to sound fake or forced. Dean eyes him for a long, long time. Sam stares back, unflinching. His eyes say,
'The best part was,' Charlie keeps saying excitedly, 'That he stood there all serious, in his work suit of all things, and started really, you know, quiet and pitiful. But then bam!', she slaps her knee for emphasis, 'He freaking belts out the mama part, top of his lungs, and then he totally pours his heart into it, I'm telling you. I wish there was a video.'
'I'm sorry, I just don't get it,' Dean says in despair. 'I'm trying to make you happy, I'm trying so hard but no matter what I do, it's always wrong!'
'Hello,' Castiel replies and leans down to kiss his mate. Dean hums in surprise, but his lips part and he returns the kiss.
This is the first time Dean's mentioned his alpha, and Castiel listens intently, but it's not enlightening.
Castiel pulls up to the drive-through line and they both stare at the illuminated menu boards. There's not many people around, so they take their time.
Dean spends the entire day watching movies and shows, and then makes dinner, which doesn't even take him an hour. Alpha's back a little late, but he storms in, tired yet with a smile, and it takes all the willpower Dean has not to kneel as he stands by the door instead.
Now, he can tell Dean's watching him, draining his cup with worrying speed. Castiel doesn't want him to get sick.
Dean nods, wolfing down the eggs and toast like his life depends on it. The eggs are good. The eggs are freaking
'-so yes, I value the fact that the company is open-minded when it comes to omegas-' alpha talks, and Dean decides to go to the bathroom. The painful gist of it is that he's
'Then I only have one question for you,' Castiel trails off until Dean looks at him, again, curious even if a bit apprehensive. 'How well can you throw tennis balls?'
He looks around, the silence deafening now. They didn't even eat breakfast, and he's pretty sure alpha forgot most of his things. He sees the Toyota drive away, and he finally extracts himself from the wall and drags his feet until he makes it to the couch. He sags down on it and stares at the cut, still bleeding, staining the white bandages dark red.
'My Thanksgiving was "straight-laced" and I did not enjoy it,' he shares, surprising Dean. Sam raises his eyebrows.
slips out before he can stop it, and he freezes, cause that's definitely not how you talk to an alpha, but Castiel doesn't seem to notice. He eats crispy wings and keeps listening. Dean feels so honoured that someone is treating him, and things that are important to him, so seriously. It makes him realize that maybe this is how alpha felt when Dean agreed to listen to his band, before.
'No,' Castiel refuses, they don't have to talk about anything, they can't come here, to his house - 'No, you are not welcome here.' They can't come, they can't. He got out, this is
He gets to cooking. Nothing too fancy, just some cold appetizers. The house is clean already and he can hear alpha speak into the phone distantly, so he's making his own preparations. Okay. Dean gets that now may not be the best time to talk. But they'll get through it, he'll hold Castiel's hand all the way through it if he'll have to.
'I've never seen my name like that,' Dean says, drawing invisible patterns on the tiles with his finger. 'With your, our, last name. I - I liked it,' he admits. It's easier here. Alpha's behind the door, and for once - maybe for the first time ever - it depends on him when he lets alpha in. 'No one's ever made something like that for me, before.'
'I'm ready,' Dean says, anxiously, wiping his hands on his pants. Castiel noticed he does that when he's nervous.
It makes Dean terrified, because it's so completely illogical. He went through all possible solutions he could come up with, and none of them were plausible.
'Y-yes, Ma'am, if I may, that is,' he mumbles, and then clears his throat quietly. 'I won't make a sound. It's very nice to meet everyone, and - and to see you again, Mr. Benny and - Charlie,' he glances up at them and tries to nod in their direction, too, but he's beyond himself with anxiety.
'It's nothing,' Dean says defensively, tensing up. Castiel doesn't remember the last time he's seen him this jumpy, this
'Maybe I can just blow you?' he asks, hesitant, and feels Castiel's arms tense around him. 'You didn't come.'
'You don't look too excited,' Cas says. Dean pouts at him from behind the - whatever the hell this is. A net-like hat to complete this ridiculous ensemble.
He whirls around to find Dean aiming another snowball at his face, and he ducks and bends down to grab a handful of snow. Dean's good, but he's not
'My dad sure thought so,' Dean shrugs. 'He rushed to grab the guy, but he just... vanished. I'm sure dad was just in shock, I don't know, cause the fire was already starting, and he picked up my brother and handed him to me and then he tried to save mom, but he - well, he, uh, he couldn't. And the police never even listened to him, they thought he was just losing it.'
wears his earphones, only takes them off during class, and Castiel starts to think he should treat that as a sign of dedication. It's a low bar.
'Feels different than I expected,' alpha says, and frees his hand. 'Although I would like to touch a snake's skin.'
He closes all tabs and shuts the laptop down. Doesn't matter. He knows Sammy's alive, and successful, and that's already good.
'I knew it was a bad idea, I told Charlie it was too early,' Castiel laments, taking off his trench coat. 'We're staying. I didn't mean to stress you out, I thought you wanted to-'
The will is long, but mother's helped him out; she's circled the part that matters with a pen. He reads it - and the amount of money he's being given is so absurd, he doesn't really feel anything when he sees it. It just feels like a number. Then, he reads the rest of it, and realizes he's getting the most. And Gabriel - he'll receive quite a sum, too.
'No I didn't!' Dean protests instantly, glancing up at him. He'd never do that, he'd notice. Except for that time on the couch when alpha was asleep... but he couldn't have heard that!
He knows that the aim is for him to be up and running again. Castiel has said it an infinite number of times. He's gotta be tired of playing housemaid - him, an alpha, actually cooking for Dean?! - and he's not so bad at it, a hidden Ramsay talent, apparently, but no alpha likes that. Alphas like having everything ready for them, so that they can work in peace. Provide.
doesn't want anyone to touch me,' replies Dean, trying to sound stern and failing. The stranger grins predatorily, shows a row of blindingly white teeth.
, in the morning when he's so hungry, when alpha's not mad and actually talking to him. Dean thinks it's because it's still relatively early and they're both tired. There's something about mornings that strips away the tension.
'You know what? Fine. I don't care. Come here,' he snaps his fingers and Theo jumps to his feet and follows him to the door. On his way, he's facing Dean and he mouths a
'What? That's not fair! I'm always in class and I always write these stupid essays,' Dean points to the offensive piece of paper. 'You just hate me cause I'm an omega.'
Fine. Okay. Sure, Dean does trust him. Castiel disappears in the house and Dean waits, and waits, and waits. God, how is he gonna explain all this to Sam? And Charlie, and Benny - he'll probably never see them again. There will be new alphas to meet and to impress at alpha's new workplace, that is if he ever finds a new workplace. What if he never does? What if they're gonna be poor and Castiel won't have the money to pay the bills? What if they'll have to sell the house, what if they'll become homeless?
Dean doesn't think it would be too much of a problem at the rate he's slicking - he's pretty sure his pants will be soaked through any minute - but Castiel is big, and he doesn't want it to hurt. Then, he remembers something. He leans forward, pops the glove compartment open and there it is. The small bottle of lube he's been given on their wedding day by the omega center. A touching parting gift.
'Thank you,' he says, sheepishly. Maybe there's a catch, but it doesn't seem like it. Alastair's already lost in whatever's happening on the small TV hung above the bar. His fingers flex. They still have a lot of driving to do.
Henry looks a little uncomfortable, but he doesn't comment, choosing to stare into his cup instead. Castiel gapes at Sam, fighting to get the words out.
'Didn't sleep at all, not really,' Dean replies quietly. 'When I got up, you were out of it, but I was still so - I had to - you know. Is that okay?'
omega for Castiel but now he'll fix it. Castiel likes him, he likes him, he can use it. 'Please don't let him take me, alpha, I'll be so good for you.'
'Yeah,' Dean agrees with a smile, and then glances at Castiel like he's considering something. He looks up, and then away, and then up again. Castiel waits patiently, until he finally blurts out:
Cas doesn't look alright, but Dean thinks that in that moment, he's not actually lying. It's one of his
'It's okay, baby,' he keeps up the stream of reassurances, stroking Dean's hair, neck, back, hoping to calm him down. 'You're safe, everything's fine. You're safe, you're good.'
'I can return it-' Dean starts saying, fervently, making a move to grab the box. 'I know it was a stupid idea, I'm sorry-'
Dean nods, dumbstruck, and Castiel gently takes the pants from him and puts them to the side. Dean feels exposed, but alpha doesn't look at his dick. He moves his hand upwards and grabs the hem of Dean's T-shirt, tugs it up. Dean gets the idea and raises his arms, letting Castiel take it off of him.
He gets out of the car, abruptly, like he’s made a decision, and Castiel’s left staring after him, rendered speechless. The selflessness of his omega astounds him, over and over again.
Dean's grip is shy of painful and very strong, but he tries to focus on this game, and Castiel kisses his cheek. That relaxes him far more quickly than any words or reassurances.
When Sam yells, it's years of built up madness and frustration and pain, and Dean relates. And he wants to let go, too.
She steps in and then suddenly, raises her hand, and fuck - it was the kneeling, or she knows he's been bad before; he flinches and takes a hurried step away, his back hits the wall, so much for being friendly-
So, he makes alpha coffee in the tallest mug he can find. He walks up to the door and stands there for a couple minutes, gathering his courage. He chickens out and goes back to the kitchen. Glares at the mug as if it's its fault that he's such a wimp. Then strolls up to the
'Me too,' Castiel sends him a sad lopsided smile. 'I worry your brother will attempt to take you away.'
The people - two betas and an alpha with a kid, the owner of the kneeling omega - say their greetings.
'Um,' Dean swallows, looks around the place, thinking hard. 'Pie? Yeah, I think. I didn't really - only got to make it twice. We rarely had a big enough kitchen when I was a kid, and Alastair never liked baking. But - I could make a really good one, I think. I mean,
i know this chapter's a lot, and it was so hard to write. the topic is so heavy, but i felt it was important to show how dean behaves faced with the dangers of everyday life in that universe, after everything that cas taught him. the next chapter will be sort of intense as well, those two chapters are the ending i’ve had planned for dcwyb for a
'Dean,' alpha says, stopping while the rest of the group moves forward, the beta couple snapping pics right away and the girl tugging her dad towards a cheesy skeleton by the boarded up window. 'You didn't have to help that omega. But I'm so glad you did.'
'It is large, yes,' Castiel says and sees Dean snort and cover his mouth. His heart warms seeing his omega at least a bit happier. 'We tie for about an hour.'
testing... it means he knows. It means he knows Dean's here, and it means he came after him. It means he cares.
It would help to talk about things, Castiel knows. But Dean won't talk. And he insists on using the scent blockers as long as he's in school, so it's not like his scent can give anything away, either.
'No, it's...' Dean curls in on himself. His ass hurts after yesterday and the blissful feeling he woke up with is nowhere to be found. 'You're right. You do turn me on, but you also scare me.'
'Of course, take a seat,' Zachariah gestures to the plush chairs facing his desk. 'Is this about the project?'
'Spread your legs more for me, baby,' he asks against Dean's skin, and Dean tries to, but somehow he can't. He wants this, so he doesn't realize why he freezes, but cold dread crawls up his throat and threatens to show in his scent.
Finally, Dean clears his throat and places a big homemade cheeseburger in front of him. It looks amazing, the cheese melting and the patty thick and rich. There are tomatoes and salad, mustard and ketchup, pickles and onion.
They're done with the list twenty minutes later; Dean's coffee and sandwiches are gone, and he's really ready to go. He doesn't know what's the point of writing it all down. He'd eat anything Castiel would've given him anyway. This is the first time in years he's not going hungry, and the food choices are so diverse.
He almost forgets about Dean, only catching glimpses of him all week, and then it's the last week before finals. Dean hands in a research paper about the environment, and it's really bad. Castiel tells him to stay after class on Wednesday and doesn't know how to break it to him.
'Sit, Dean,' Castiel uses the alpha voice and Dean sobs and shakes his head, but alpha holds him and leads him to the couch, and forces him to sit down. 'Your head between your knees,' he pushes Dean's head down, gently but insistently, and Dean complies. Castiel moves and Dean grabs at him.
'That's awesome,' Dean smiles, happy to have some energy around. The day on the couch has made him sleepy and a little sad.
'- and I don't need help. I'm just complaining, and you're supposed to say, "I'm so sorry, Dean, your teacher is an asshole and you're being exploited".'
He drops his eyes to the floor, pale as a sheet and lightheaded with fear, forcing himself to wait for the verdict. He knows he shouldn't say too much; omegas are to be seen, not heard, to be seen, not heard, yes alpha, i understand, they're efficient, not whiny. But he can't show that he'll change here, in the diner's bathroom, so he has to promise.
Great. Now Dean just feels stupid. He sits up as well, unsure what to say, because he doesn't get it.
The alpha takes Theo outside, and the girl continues to glower, with her small arms crossed in front of her. Castiel's hand grabs Dean and squeezes.
Dean laughs, derisively. Angrily. Cas wonders if the whiskey affects him already, or if he's just fed up.
The guy frowns at him, and then Dean can pinpoint the exact moment his eyes land on the red wristband. His friendly smile disappears, replaced by a contemptuous sneer, and he doesn't say anything. He just ignores Dean entirely, and it feels like a punch to the face.
So he takes hold of his shirt and starts to take it off, but he must smell wrong, cause alpha pulls away and looks concerned.
He holds out a hand and kind of pats Castiel's shoulder. The alpha grumbles in protest, still asleep and turns around. His arm slides down Dean's body and lands on the bed with a hollow thud.
'Help me?' he asks weakly. Any other alpha would've just pushed his legs open, not caring about his momentary freakout, but not Castiel. He just says, 'of course', like it's the most obvious thing in the world, and retreats a little, sits on his heels. He massages Dean's calves slowly, getting to his thighs, and Dean's shaking. 'I'm sorry-' he starts saying, cause he feels stupid, but Castiel shushes him instantly.
'But I don't wanna hold you back. I swear I know my place. It's super nice that you let me do so many things and talk so much, but if you ever just wanna fuck me, tell me and I'll do my best not to freak out much, cause I know you don't like it.'
'Yes,' Castiel smiles a little. Overall, Dean's pleased to note that he seems much more relaxed than in the morning. He's glad Charlie found the restaurant and took them out. 'I've been waiting years for this chance.'
When he wakes up again, he's alone and burrowed under pillows and blankets. It's warm and cozy and he'd love it if he weren't feeling so weak. At least the fever is gone, he thinks.
'But - you said it was okay?' he ventures quietly, not sure what to say. Damn, he really wanted it. Something must've happened to have alpha change his mind. Maybe he thinks Dean's too unhinged to drive on his own.
'Think it's obvious,' he grunts. He hears alpha move, and then he gets a kiss on his shoulder, and alpha's hands go down his naked back in wide strokes. Dean relaxes a little. Yes! But then alpha says, 'You're so cold. Can you sit down?'
'Yeah,' Dean replies. Now that he talks about it, so many years later, it really sounds crazy. It sounds like he and dad were messed up beyond repair. But it didn't feel like that. Dad had solid proof, and if the police wasn't going to catch the guy, who was going to? It kept happening, but in states so far apart from each other, no one seemed to make a connection. 'I didn't really see anything grisly. I was just happy to help dad. I felt like I was finally doing something. I've also been... since my dad was a beta, sometimes he'd send me into a police station or to some office to, uh, flirt with the alphas in charge. I could get whatever I wanted. Documents, photos, free food at some restaurants. I never actually did anything, but it was enough to... be there, talk to them. I was kinda hot back then, and kinda confident,' he smiles self-consciously. 'I guess that got them going. It was also great when I was playing poker or pool, man, I could hustle like a pro,' he remembers himself and loses the smile. 'Which was, of course, inappropriate and I'd never do it again. I was also - stealing,' he feels like it's a confession, not that he's ever been to one, but he imagines that's how it'd be. 'Food, keys, sometimes a car. Rarely a car. Sometimes I drove my dad places and he needed to... get away quickly if someone realized he wasn't who he pretended to be. I was good at that,' he mentions. 'Driving fast.'
'I'm glad,' Castiel sighs, taking out two plates. He puts the eggs there and toasts some bread in the meantime. 'I never cooked much for myself, before.'
He hates himself for being like this, sometimes. But when an alpha can do anything to him, and Alastair exercised that right fully, he learned quickly to show respect. He's biting his lip as he waits anxiously for the answer.
'How about the koalas? You wanted to see them?' alpha starts walking and he circles an arm around him, their hips colliding. Dean just welcomes the safety of it and tries not to feel bad, sad, guilty about it. 'Do you like koalas?'
It's stupid, but Dean thinks that those last years, he'd actually be happy if Alastair gave him something that was a sign of ownership. He knew he was worth less than dirt, but when Alastair started visiting the brothels, leaving the house for a week or more, Dean felt even more useless than usual. Which was idiotic, cause he should've been happy that he was left alone. And he was relieved, yeah, but... he was also disappointed.
Castiel disconnects the call and Dean realizes he forgot to tell him a fact. He'll pick something and have it ready for when the alpha arrives.
once they catch the killer, but now all he feels is ugly regret. He missed it all, Sam got to do the honors after years of
He doesn't know if he sounds convincing, because Castiel doesn't look like the words affect him. But he smiles gently.
He hits send, and puts the phone down on top of the covers. Alpha leans in and kisses him, sloppy and tired. Then, he stumbles out of bed in all his naked glory, unconcerned as always. Dean stares at his pale, toned butt. Alpha turns around and Dean looks up at his face, preferring missing the view to being caught staring at alpha's dick.
His voice is so deep, Dean feels a shiver down his spine, and it's not the good kind. The guy scares him, with his intense piercing gaze and the obvious reluctance to marry. It's no surprise he's not satisfied with the omega presented to him, but it's the law, he got selected. Not like he gets the short end of this stick, Dean thinks, irritated.
'I thought you were him, when I woke up,' Dean admits when they break the kiss. His hold on alpha is always shy, it's always a mock embrace, because he knows that whenever alpha indicates he wants to get up, Dean's gonna immediately let him go. But it feels good nonetheless. Feels good to keep him close. 'I don't know, I don't really feel - normal, today.'
'Dean?' he asks, and looks a little - okay, this one looks different. He looks awed, surprised, Dean doesn't know. 'I - what are you doing here?'
'So far it sounds nice all the way,' Castiel says, and it does. It's so different from everything he listens to and he also wouldn't have predicted it would be something Dean would enjoy; discovering that the omega likes hard rock in addition to horror movies is yet another surprise. Dean's so sweet and subdued, those things don't seem to fit him, but once Castiel gets a glimpse beyond the facade... well. He remembers again the alpha from the shop, knocked out on the floor. And Dean standing by the shelves... dangerous, confident, with his fists balled up and ready to keep fighting. Castiel felt so proud. Aroused, too, which was completely unexpected, but mostly amazed. He feels honored to be the one who gets to see the real Dean, under the layers of fear and submissiveness that was beaten into him.
'You don't have to touch it,' Castiel's hand lands on Dean's bent knee and he whimpers, but doesn't move away. 'Just please tell me what's going on.'
Dean stares at him, no doubt looking pitiful with tears smeared all over his face and red-rimmed eyes. But he's a little hopeful. Just a tiny bit, but alpha says it like he believes it.
going to come back. And whenever you feel like he will, just know that I'll keep you safe. He'll never get you.'
It is Sammy. He's huge, he's the size of a mammoth or a bulldozer, and Dean's not really sure when he's started crying but he scrolls down. Sam's gotta be thirty-five now, and he might've grown, but he still has the same face Dean'd know anywhere. The floppy hair, has he never fucking cut it? There's not many pics, just Sammy smiling politely during a dinner of some kind, Dean doesn't recognize any other people in the photo, and then standing in front of the office - lawyer's office - and it's clear it was a photo made for the job.
'I thought you meant more shirts and pants, but this is ready with the tie and socks and underwear-'
'Dean, tell me,' it's the alpha voice. Dean dashes to the bathroom, and he feels alpha run after him, and it releases real panic, smothering and unrelenting. He manages to slam the bathroom door behind himself and he locks it, and just a second later, alpha tries the doorknob.
'That's okay. You'll find it on the way back,' Castiel assures him, and gets out of the car. He has to open the door for Dean, who's just sitting there, staring ahead. The moment their hands touch, though, Dean grabs onto Castiel and holds tight.
'Yeah, alpha,' Dean replies, wrapping the blanket and covers more tightly around himself and turning to the side. There was a moment, before, maybe when Castiel told him he was doing a good job, or when he tucked him in, when Dean allowed himself to hope that they could be actual mates with time. Not total strangers, not servant and master... not equals either, obviously, but alpha and omega that have a regular conversation once in a while. He wanted so desperately for Castiel to care at least a little bit about... him. As a person. But it seemed he was wrong, like always, and he was just an asset. It was simple math, really - he couldn't do his job well if he was sick, so Castiel would make sure he'd be ok in no time, and then they would go back to their roles.
Castiel offers to protect him pretty often. It's a good feeling, the idea of not being alone, but Dean wishes it wouldn't have to apply to Sam.
'Would you like to come over, Dean?' Charlie asks excitedly. Dean drops his eyes and wrings his hands.
'Of course,' Castiel agrees quickly. He forgot, but now that Dean's mentioned it, it's true. He's been living without much food in general. Everything but work was pushed aside, intentionally, for so many years. 'We'll go to the shop and pick whatever you want. We can have a cabinet just for snacks, what do you think?'
He thinks alpha's gonna try to kiss him and get him in the mood when they go to bed, but he doesn't. He just lies down and sets an alarm, so Dean stops by the drawer and hesitates.
'What do you like when we mate?' he asks, worried cause he's past all the boundaries he usually stays within. It's just, alpha's reaction was possibly one of the most unexpected things to ever happen to him. Alpha kept telling him he really cared about him and everything, but this... this was just bizarre, and it was proof.
'They do some exams but uh, sometimes,' Dean nervously rubs his knees. 'Sometimes something's wrong with you, and that's when you worry.'
,' Dean declares, wiping a hand across his face. 'That girl, she - she just blew it out of the park...'
'She's right,' Dean backs her up and runs a thumb across alpha's hand. 'But you know your plants, alpha, so maybe you can tell me what I'd like?'
'But I'm telling you, you can,' alpha tells him patiently. 'This is our house, and these are our rules. I want you to be comfortable during your... private moments.'
'Nah, it's not that,' Dean shifts in place, uncomfortable. 'This was a stupid idea. Let's go, let's start the tour someplace else.'
'I do,' Dean nods. 'Thanks. I promise I'll be better in a moment. I'd just like to lay down for a while.'
'Parties?' Castiel furrows his brow. 'No, I don't think so. You'll find I'm not very social,' he chuckles, and it comes out a little sad. Good. No friends. Dean's happy. This is so much better than he expected.
'Of course,' he says. 'Here, I bought quite a lot of groceries, I wasn't sure what you like,' he opens the fridge and shows Dean the contents. There really
Castiel turns around and looks at him for a moment. Dean puts a lot of effort into looking subdued and pleading. Castiel sighs.
'Sorry, I didn't hear you,' he says, but he doesn't like the way Dean's calm scent wavers, it's like it's stretched thin like an elastic band. The omega blows out a breath.
Dean hopes he's not an inconvenience. Whenever they knotted before, Castiel was mindful of him and kept his weight off of him, but they've spent it in silence. Sometimes he'd kiss Dean's back, but that was it, not that it wasn't much by itself.
'Then I must've just started, now, I don't know,' Dean continues weakly. 'I'm fine, I swear. Can we please go?'
'Surely, there are,' Dean replies easily. 'All alphas in the staff room are watching, I assure you.'
'You do?' he asks, both baffled and painfully hopeful, because if someone tells him what to fix, he can do it.
For the first time in days, Dean's outside and he immediately welcomes the rain and the cold wind. It feels like he can breathe more deeply, feels so fresh.
'If you're asking if we'll never make sweet slow love like we used to, the answer's no,' he says firmly.
'You went to the shop?' Dean asks, only realizing that now. 'I'm sorry. I should've - I meant to go, I just-'
with him. As if confirming, Castiel's hand stops grasping his and instead travels to the small of his back, caressing his hip on the way. Dean shudders from just that, but doesn't move away.
'Mmm I - uh, Dean, God, yes, Dean, I-' he closes his eyes and tips his head back, his hands tightening their hold on his mate.
Something punches the air from his lungs, like he's just ran into a speeding train, and he flies across the room to land in a painful heap on the floor.
Dean nods in agreement. He wouldn't want to talk about his family, either. Too many painful memories.
'That's not it,' Sam says, pleadingly, though it kinda is, effectively. 'I just don't want to see you hurt. You're my brother, Dean, and this is all I can do!'
They rummage through the cabinets and desks in search for clues, and Dean likes that Cas is really getting into it. There's an artificial bat jumping out of the drawer on a spring, like a jack in the box, and it makes Cas stumble backwards in surprise. He lands on his ass and he
'That we go everywhere together,' Dean explains. 'That way I can keep an eye on you. Make sure you don't get into any trouble.'
But it turns out to be a pleasant surprise. Dean's writing style is different this time; he seems to have dropped the forced academic writing that he so clumsily attempted. He writes from the first person which is a mistake a lot of students make, but somehow, it doesn't bother Castiel, because for the first time, he feels something reading it. Dean skips the whole bit about the characters and the plot, doesn't even mention that it's a roman a clef, and from the looks of it, he's not even aware of it. He found something he likes in the book and wrote about it, plain and simple, and that something is "the freedom of open roads", as he puts it. The part about how it made him feel like he was really travelling with the characters - sleeping on the roof of the car being bitten by mosquitos - sounds very straightforward but endearing, because an enormous longing, true and aching, shines right through it and it really moves Castiel. It's only the first page that's good, that's authentic; the second one and onwards are just many attempts to write about literary themes and style and Dean's clearly bad at it. But he tries. Castiel wanted improvement and he got it. Perhaps Dean will never be a novel writer, but it's more than enough to pass.
Charlie's instantly sympathetic, and she comes over and puts a hand on his shoulder. He's grateful for the contact. He still remembers the frantic way Dean tried to take off his collar, just cause he wanted to get out of the house so badly. He wanted to get some fresh air so much that he was willing to risk getting assaulted. Only because he thought Castiel wanted this, and he would've done that for him. How long had Alastair had to beat him to make him change into someone like that? Someone so terrified of angering an alpha that they would get rid of the only thing protecting them?
but not telling him anything. About Alastair dressing up for the court hearing- for the court hearings, plural. Dean knows he must've ironed his suit that day. Alastair must've loved it, knowing that he was going to see Sam, knowing that Dean lost all hope even though someone out there was fighting for him.
'We didn't,' Castiel decides to tell them the truth. 'Dean's been paired up with me through the system. It wasn't  easy at first, but I think we get on very well nowadays.'
This doesn't make any sense, not with the panic still tightening Dean's throat and his lungs and his stomach.
'Not mad at all,' Castiel replies, tired. 'Just worried. The card you took was free, there'd be no trouble with that. But I was so scared you stole something of value and the alphas from the center would take you away.'
That's not happened ever since he was twenty. His heart swells with how much he loves his new alpha.
The lube clicks open and Castiel softly inches his legs further apart. Dean goes pliant with a quiet sigh of relief. He's already slicking a little but it looks like alpha doesn't intend to forget his favourite part.
'I haven't listened to a,' Castiel squints looking at the letters. 'ZZ Top before, but if you want to, let's purchase it. I have a radio at home, we can bring it to the kitchen and you can listen to it whenever you like.'
And there's also a whole day in cowboy town ahead of them. Castiel thinks he's grown fond of Boulderplains. Just a little.
'Oh,' he says, as soon as he sees Dean. 'Please feel free to use the bathroom, I - I'll be downstairs.'
Castiel wants to ask more, about Alastair, who he was, where Dean lived before that, but all of this sounds like it's going to bring back some traumatizing memories. So Castiel opts to keep talking about something safer, instead.
'Sorry, can you please repeat it? I'll write it down, I-' Dean frantically looks for a piece of paper and finds a discarded notepad on the coffee table in the living room, leaving Castiel behind, occupied with stirring and serving. Dean's able to write Garth and branch, but he doesn't understand anything else, and it's making him feel terrified. What if he gets it wrong and alpha's entire work project's fucked up because of him?
'I- I'm sorry I fell asleep,' Dean murmurs, his voice rough and gravelly again, and he looks vaguely alarmed, even if still sleepy. 'I- I didn't think- didn't think I'd do that. I wasn't tired- ' he frowns a little as he realizes that. His eyes flick to the pills by the table and he licks his dry lips, slowly, as if remembering the bitter taste.
'Bless you,' Castiel grabs a pack of tissues from the drawer and holds one to Dean's nose. Dean glances up at him, confused. 'Blow your nose.'
So, he takes the decision out of Dean's hands. He moves on the couch and presses an arm across Dean's stomach, keeping him in place. He hears Dean exhale and stare down at him, out of his mind with arousal.
Dean definitely does not nuzzle alpha's neck, and definitely does not tighten his hold, because he's scared and overwhelmed and kinda wants to call the whole thing off and go home.
'He did seem friendly,' Castiel speaks for the first time in a long while. 'It's disappointing to know it was an act.'
'Good job, sweetheart,' he says fondly, and Dean puts down the coke and turns around, but stops with his hands raised and trembling in the air. Normally, it's okay to hug alpha. This alpha likes it, he knows. So he doesn't know why suddenly, going for a hug fills him with embarrassment and dread.
'Think I'm stayin' for good, Sammy,' he tells him, cause he thinks his brother deserves the truth. 'You can let go, now. Stop worrying about me.'
'Okay. Cool,' is what he replies, though - no chick flick moments - and alpha helps him into the shower and goes to take off his coat. Dean gets just a glimpse, but if he's still wondering if he's affecting alpha - well, the evidence is right there. And alpha just... ignores it.  He doesn't want Dean to do anything in return.
'We can come back tomorrow morning,' Cas replies, unbothered. 'And the ghost tours will definitely work out.'
'I knew you would've liked it,' Castiel replies and sounds damn satisfied with himself. Good, Dean thinks, he deserves it.
'Alright,' Castiel thinks for a moment. 'What if I told you that I don't want you to pass your driving exam, anymore?'
'I agree with you,' Castiel tells him fervently, and Dean blinks and stops mid-sentence, surprised. 'I also detest the entitlement of people in positions of power.'
He expects more rage, but Dean, it appears, is infinitely full of surprises. He blinks wordlessly at the apology, and then says:
'I think it's what you call going alpha on someone,' he tells her slowly, dragging each word out painfully.
It doesn't feel satisfying. It feels like Alastair wins, no matter what. Like he's amused seeing how much he broke Dean, how much of him he's taken away. Or maybe he's furious - maybe he thinks Dean's soft and needs another lesson. A lot of new lessons. Wilson would've loved to experience that, Dean's sure, and suddenly, it makes him want to cry, the onslaught of violence and hatred and unfairness, his lack of choice, the terrifying repercussions of making a choice, it's all too much.
'Well, if that's what you want,' he starts, slowly. 'Surely we could arrange it. But - I thought you wanted to be a mechanic. I thought that was the whole point.'
Dean tries to breathe, but it's harder now, because he hasn't seen the bad box in years. He's not sure where alpha kept it, but they must've known it was meant for him, somehow, cause they sent it.
'Dean!' he whips around, startled and stumbling from the force of it. It's Castiel. 'You weren't there! Why did you leave?! I was so worried-'
He tries to untie the string that keeps his sweatpants from sliding down his thin hips, his hands suddenly shaking so much, it's hard to do it. So he just pulls them down forcefully, and takes off his boxers, his soft tiny cock trying to shrink back into his body, his entire frame trembling now.
Dean startles him by swiftly taking off his jacket and shirt. He smells so good, and though still bruised, he's beautiful. Castiel wants to run his hands down his chest, but for now, they have to rush it. He doesn't want any students - or teachers - interrupting this moment.
'A whole spoon!' he complains, and then quieter, more timid: 'Why do you even keep that if you don't cook, alpha?'
He shouldn't get ahead of himself; maybe it was an accident. Hell of an accident, for Sam to stumble upon his mate out of all people.
Dean's not sure why's he supposed to follow, but he smiles at Charlie and does. When he and alpha reach the bedroom, alpha shuts the door and Dean looks at him, confused.
If Castiel senses the shift in the air, he doesn't react. He finds them a table and sits down, handing Dean the menu. Dean sits opposite from him in the cushioned booth. This place is nice.
The guard comes in and gives the place a once-over. Dean knows it's fine; he folded the clothes, and the sheet, and even wiped the sink so that there were no drops of water in it. The guard doesn't say anything and just leads him outside, holding his arm in a tight grip, and Dean winces cause his elbow still hurts, even though it's been days since Alastair pushed him.
'What is that?' he asks, and Dean flinches and drops his eyes. Fuck. He knew he shouldn't have looked up.
'If I break a rule, I get punished. And it was a rule at Alastair's, so it was fair. You just got different rules, alpha.'
'You being happy,' he says, and Dean shivers and, 'fuck,' he exhales, not knowing how to express whatever he's feeling right now.
'That sentence didn't make logical sense,' Cas grumps beside him, as they enter the first room. 'We can't see something that's invisible.'
'I'm a little hungry too, we've been walking for a while,' he says, and Dean feels like it's meant to calm him down. 'How about we sit down at some cafe and order something to gain our strength back?'
'Allowing this behavior leads to allowing worse behavior, Dean,' Castiel tells him, wearily. 'Just because this isn't as bad as the other things you've had to go through, it doesn't mean it's right.'
But on the other hand... he also needs it, he thinks. A couple of times, it scratched an itch somewhere deep inside him, when he did it with the alpha he was bonded to. From time to time he's allowed to come. Coming feels good sometimes, even having his mate inside feels good sometimes, like the fact that they're biological mates is enough to cover up the lack of positive feelings they have for each other. Act as some kind of catalyst.
Dean was terrified, but not as much as usual; Alastair probably wouldn't hurt him there, not where his new boss could see him, and he
'Never, never about this,' Castiel kisses him again, and this time, Dean follows his mouth when they separate, and he timidly tugs him back down. He can feel that Castiel's still smiling when their mouths meet.
'I kinda panicked,' he murmurs. That's it, that's just what happened. He couldn't even think clearly. He didn't even remember he could ask.
It's a great burger. And when he's done, he waits for his alpha to finish, patiently, watching some comedy show on TV. The two old men argue about their neighbor and when there's a joke, he laughs quietly, and Alastair laughs too. It's a good day, Dean decides, alpha's foot resting against his under the table. Almost relaxing, and on the road. Away from the house.
'I meant in general, Dean,' Castiel rolls his eyes. 'You just keep... surprising me. You never give up.'
'It's true,' Dean lowers his gaze. That's literally what he was. A prize. An obedient, docile omega that Alastair carved from a fierce, independent, wannabe beta. 'So you kept trying? Wait-'
He hates it and he lets himself cry for five minutes like a pathetic child before he wipes his eyes and goes downstairs. He's a joke of an alpha. Too sensitive, his family always knew that.
'Geez, Cas,' Dean murmurs into his mug, covering his blushing face with it. 'Yeah, I like it when you look like you wanna fuck me. I told you that.'
'And the driving licence - I haven't forgotten about it. There's been so much going on, but I'll register you for it now,' Castiel brings his laptop to the couch and shows Dean the website. 'Here, I'll sign you up.'
He leads Dean outside and to their bedroom, and as soon as they pass the threshold, starts kissing him. First the mouth, then the jaw and the neck, and down down down to his clavicle. Dean's shuddering and backing away with him, until they reach the bed and tumble onto it. Dean moves to get a pillow while Castiel's still kissing his chest and giggles as the alpha makes a noise of protest and slides him back by his hips.
'Yes, I'm so sorry,' Dean rushes out, his mouth dry. 'I slept until twelve-oh-nine. I've read your note but I took a shower first, and I didn't see the calls, so it's been-' he calculates quickly, alphas like concrete data, they like him to know how he's managed the time,
'It's a stupid cartoon,' alpha growls through gritted teeth. 'I should be over it, it's been years. But that - that sound-'
'I know this is an extremely emotional situation, but I'd rather you didn't address Dean's abuse that way,' he says. 'Please do try to be more considerate.'
,' he tells Dean. 'But except for that, I have another way to cheer you up. I have a surprise for you.'
Alpha opens the door and they're greeted by the sight of a dark hallway. The only window is covered up, but there are candles with flickering flames all over the place. They're not the only guests - five people are already sat there waiting. Well, four people are sitting - there's an omega there, kneeling on the floor, and Dean knows because they're fucking
'Home?' Dean grimaces and looks back at the door. 'There's a lock on your door, and we could do all kinds of... business transactions... in here.'
'I don't know-' he trails off. If alpha doesn't know about the rule, he shouldn't suggest it, right? Alpha's been so clueless about omegas so far. But he's been also kind. Dean knows he won't eat breakfast if he's not sure that he's allowed. His stomach growls again, and he presses his fist to it. He got spoiled, he used to go days with almost no food at all, but now he actually wonders what he's going to eat, he's gotten so picky.
'I don't have anyone else to confide in, to ask about this,' Castiel admits, his shoulders slumping. He knows he has been lonely for years, but ironically, Dean's insistent, overwhelming presence makes him really realize it. He was good at pretending he didn't need anyone else.
'But it's so much better than I hoped! You're amazing for him,' Charlie says and Dean blinks, stunned. She's staring at him, now, earnestly. 'We all see it, at work. The guy actually smiles! He comes to work smiling, he looks... lighter, I know him for years but I've never seen him this happy.'
There’s a surge of doubt and worry in Castiel, all of a sudden. Because as great and unbelievable this news is, could that mean that Dean might want to leave now? Live independently? But that would mean he only ever agreed to be Castiel’s mate out of necessity, nothing more, and it never felt like it was just a formality, it felt like…
'I wanted to thank you,' Dean says, folding his hands in his lap. 'Seriously. This - it's awesome. And thanks for letting us stay another day. And sorry about yesterday. I really, uh, let myself go-'
. Dean's breath stutters; alpha's never been this... passionate, before. His kiss deepens and Dean goes pliant, docile; alpha's nice and it gets Dean all hot and bothered when he's so confident, and he just wants to let him take whatever he wants. But then, alpha's second hand joins the first, kneading his buttocks through the jeans and pulling them apart a little and Dean breaks the kiss and steps back, his hip colliding with the kitchen table painfully.
'It's fine, Dean, I'm sure if I were to get sick, I would be already. And I took some vitamins, so do not worry about me.'
'Ah, yes. So it goes,' Castiel quotes easily, though he's not too fond of that book. But Dean surprises him again - he cracks a smile, and it's beautiful.
'I'm happy it did,' Castiel replies, breathing in Dean's scent. 'Are you alright? I know it was - a lot. That's an understatement.'
Before he can reply, Dean can smell alpha get furious, shocked, sad - all of it, and it's so intense, it's pure instinct when Dean turns around to him and grabs his arm, as if he can hold him back.
'What did you say?' alpha asks, rubbing his back. 'I didn't hear you. Some people can be rude. We're parked in the appropriate place.'
'No, some are funfetti, some vanilla. I think. Or maybe lemon, I wasn't really paying attention to labels. Here, try, alpha,' he picks one up and hands it to alpha. 'And I prepared an outfit and you
It's a bold move for him, but it's easier to ask for food that than to admit what's really the problem. Castiel takes a moment to come back to himself, and he looks confused for a split second before nodding hastily.
'I can read,' Dean says, barreling on, because now there's no going back. He has to read it, and understand it, and talk to alpha about it. Still. Things were much worse at Alastair's work, no nice leather couch to sit on, no book to read, no kind, hot husband in vicinity.
'What items?' Dean can't keep fear out of his voice this time. So he's apprehensive, sue him; 'items' can mean so much when it comes to omegas, and it's never anything pleasant. A cock cage, maybe? If Castiel doesn't dig sex with him much?
'No, drink it all, Dean,' Castiel tells him, and then, like an afterthought (as if he was hesitating to touch him, Dean notes), he leans in and rubs Dean's arm affectionately. He smiles softly. 'I need you really awake for this.'
'Alpha?' Dean asks in the darkness, cause the alpha is laying on one side and already starting to fall asleep. 'W-where should I sleep?'
He slides back on the couch and pushes Dean's sweater up, out of the way, and kisses a line down his stomach, slowly, giving Dean time to adjust. His omega is watching him with wide eyes, pupils blown, his breathing speeding up, like he's waiting for some impact instead of pleasure, as Castiel gets lower and lower, until he reaches his cock. He glances up at Dean one more time before opening his mouth.
His mouth is dry and his hands are shaking as the laptop processes his request. The first link is a Facebook link, and Dean clicks on it, and almost has a stroke.
'It's about you learning to make your own choices. To be yourself,' Castiel explains, resigned. 'Perhaps it's selfish to say, but this - it's not easy. I never know which step will be the wrong one, with you. Sometimes I comment on something and you don't tell me anything but stew in it for days, and then you do something reckless that scares me and - that's why I want you to tell me things. I just hoped there was progress. I really tried, Dean, and I'm sorry to hear you still don't feel safe here.'
Some questions are elementary, but Dean listens, the irritating attitude gone. He drinks his enormous coffee - doesn't take notes - but he listens and nods and asks more questions. It's like he's a brand new student, and Castiel's... perplexed, fascinated? He can't understand the dramatic changes in Dean's mood, the switch between the rude, aggressive and the attentive, tired omega in front of him.
'I think I found yet another endearing term to call you,' he says, kissing Dean's shoulder and arm like he can't stop touching him. 'My dearest mate, my little spoon-'
'I hope the rest of the team doesn't know it too,' Castiel says dryly, and regrets it as soon as Charlie's face hardens and she backs away a little. 'No, look, I apologize. I trust you, Charlie, I know you wouldn't...'
He blinks at the question, forces himself to look at Castiel again. Right, he's asking if Dean likes having that constant place like other omegas do. Dean's never admitted it to anyone but himself, and even that was tentative, because he knew it was a weakness he couldn't really afford.
'Yes,' Castiel looks for a pen on the small shelf under the coffee table. 'I thought that would have been obvious. I said you will never see my omega. You won't see me either.'
, but during the good days, Alastair would go on about something - his day at work, how his useless buddies pissed him off, how he was planning to go on a trip outside the city soon. He never wanted Dean to talk, so Dean didn't, but sometimes, he just enjoyed the company, anything that broke the sad routine of clean-cook-service. Then - if it was still a good day, and after Dean'd done the dishes - he would've hesitated next to the couch, waited for a 'sit down pet' and then they'd watch TV together. Dean hated when they started watching something cool only to have Alastair change the channel when he got bored. But it was as close to relaxing together as it got.
Sam looks at him, the hope in his eyes dying slowly. He forces a smile, but Dean can see - and smell - that he's disappointed.
he says because his hands are full, full of his perfect mate, and Dean does. He tugs at himself and then speeds up and his breath comes out in whimpering pants, and Castiel wishes he'd moan, wishes he'd scream, but all he gets is a whine when Dean comes, long and hard, all over his stomach. It's Castiel who moans, then, and says
'It's a date!' Dean grins and Castiel doesn't have time to process it before the omega's gone. Such a tease. There's no point in expecting this to go any further than a teacher/student relationship, Castiel's no fool, but it doesn't stop him from dreaming.
'You have your own office, alpha?' he asks instead. Castiel places the ready toast on the plates and sits down opposite to Dean. The meal is a far cry from yesterday's chicken breast, but Dean still digs in with gusto.
He doesn't know if Dean believes him. Maybe at that moment, he just pretends to believe it, not wanting to continue the topic.
'Yeah, dad would always give him shit about it, and so would I,' Dean remembers. 'Guess that didn't change. I - I have to ask you something.'
Maybe Dean would freak out. Maybe he couldn't trust alpha (just for a while). Maybe he'd be scared and let Sam take him away. Probably what Sam hoped for. Sort of ruthless, but he doesn't know, Dean thinks, he doesn't
As he locks the house and goes to the bus station, the cut throbs like a painful reminder of his fuckup. Dean still feels ashamed of it, and that's why it's important to fix it. Once he fixes it, it'll be like the old times. As in, yesterday.
'Yes!' Dean cheers. They're handed a pair of gloves each before they step inside, not to smudge the mirrors with their fingerprints. When they enter it, it's glowing eerily, thanks to the blue and red lights installed on the ceiling. They move cautiously, their hands stretched out, and they manage to make it to a round room in the middle. The mirrors distort their image, and Castiel appears to have a very small head and a large torso in one, and it looks so silly, he snorts a laugh. Dean laughs as soon as he sees it, too, and he sees his arms become disproportionally big in another mirror, and he flexes and raises his eyebrows at Castiel.
'I know,' Dean replies, and, driven by something he can't understand, he leans close and leaves a sloppy, nervous peck on alpha's cheek. It's the right thing to do; Castiel smiles back, reassured in some way, and gets up and leaves.
'What was your childhood like?' Castiel asks, making a face at the sour citrus candy he unconsciously picked.
'Well, I know Castiel freaking exiled you without explaining a thing,' she shoots alpha an accusatory glance. 'And I heard from Benny how freaked out you were and dude, I would've been losing it if I were you. So I just worried that you felt bad, later on.'
'You're really into it, alpha,' Dean jokes weakly. He feels so open for him, nothing to hide, his legs so far apart even in the confined space.
'Okay,' Dean says, slowly, not feeling so well. 'So, dad's fine but served twenty years, mom's killer is dead and you found him, and also, you were looking for me all that time.'
scary. No wonder the omegas at the gun place talked about it being haunted. 'I just don't like seeing you hurt.'
It only gets better from there. They see polar bears and hippos, and rhinos and elephants and penguins, and they hold hands the entire time. Then, they stop in front of the Reptile House.
Castiel accepts his explanation and then spends his evening in the study. Dean hears some voices, he must be talking to his teammates, again. He stays on the couch, watching a sci-fi movie idly and without interest. Nothing sounds appealing and he doesn't know why. It's probably just a day like that. He keeps glancing at the door to the study; he can barely see them from where he is, in the corridor behind the stairs.
on the tip of his tongue. Then, his brain catches up and he swallows the word. Alastair used alpha voice, hell, Castiel used it too, but never like this. Dean's never seen anyone go
'The cops took them when they found me,' he explains. 'I thought they just threw them away. Why would he keep them in that - in that box?' Dean looks up at alpha and hopes he'll tell him, hopes he'll make it make sense.
'Yes,' alpha nods with a smile. 'I was only twenty, though, not very experienced. I got stung a few times. I always worried for the bees, I don't think they made it,' he admits with a forlorn look. 'After that, I did my best not to irritate them whenever I came close. Sometimes they sat on my hands, like so.'
Castiel finishes early - his last lecture is called off because of a snow storm. It's still bright outside, though, and he packs his briefcase and decides to visit Dean. He should be having a gap between classes, and he usually spends it in the library. Castiel's not visited him before, in the one month they've been together; first, the hassle with changing Dean's majors, then Castiel's own work, it took up a lot of his time. But now he's free, and excited to check in on his omega. He hopes Dean will be happy about it too.
'What?' Castiel furrows his brow, staring at her. 'I have been pretty good at ignoring him for the past three weeks, actually. What do you need help with?'
'Yes,' he replies. 'But if you don't want me and Benny hangin' out... that's cool, cause really I just wanna hang out with you, promise.'
The alpha leans in and bites him, hard, and Dean chokes on his tongue trying to stifle the scream but a pained sound still makes it past his lips. The pain fades almost instantly, though, and the bite burns pleasantly, instead, and it feels like his entire body is pulsing with it. It aches but it's a good ache, and Dean relaxes. This is his alpha, now. His scent becomes much more insistent, all of a sudden, as well. The smell of comfort and mate are dominating, and that's new, with Alastair it was more... stale, and cold, but this - this is warm, it makes him feel warm.
'I am not your old alpha,' Castiel admonishes him sternly. Dean ducks his head in response and bares his neck, showing off the scar of a mating bite, hoping to get across that he's sorry. He's shaking like a leaf, but he's glad he doesn't whine out loud. 'Dean, the rules here are different. Yes, I expect obedience and respect. But I can also promise you you will never go to the punishment center, not ever. If there is any punishment, it will be administered by me, but frankly, I doubt it will be ever needed. You have your duties and you perform them without fail,' he closes the gap between them and puts a hand on Dean's arm. 'Look at me,' he orders again, and Dean does. 'I also have mine. I am to protect you, as your alpha, and I have not been doing that. You have been sick for days and I did not notice.'
‘Then you’re new to all this,’ Adler continues. ‘Castiel, you’re a smart man, we all know that, but - let's be frank, you don’t have experience with omegas. Let me tell you something about them-’
, Dean realizes. He wonders if he also thought about the questions beforehand. But Dean doesn't feel good talking about himself, his hobbies, who cares about that?
'Mechanics are respectable too,' Castiel tells him, a smile dancing on his lips. 'All jobs are, Dean.'
It sounds a little lost and a little shocked, laced with need and want, and Castiel tugs him back up and pushes him against the wall and hugs him so close, he hopes they become one, and covers him in hungry kisses. Dean responds, a little slowly, at first, but then Castiel touches him between the legs and he makes a sound like he's just become alive.
‘Would you like to call Sam?’ he attempts, quietly and cautiously. Bringing up Dean's brother seemed like a good idea, with their special bond that apparently endured the trial of time and distance. But instead of welcoming the suggestion, Dean startles.
When Dean's hand is bandaged, he lets it drop down and he stands there, staring at the floor. Alpha stares at him in return, and Dean's afraid of what he'd see if he'd look.
'I changed my mind. And I'm not even your student after the finals. It's practically over,' Dean complains, and Castiel balks, how can he not address the
'Can you please tell me what this is about, alpha?' Dean asks in despair. His shoulders slump as he hunches in on himself. 'I just don't get it. You wanna have sex sometimes, and then you don't. Are you asking cause you don't wanna have it anymore? If you don't wanna, I'll stop trying to offer. Just please please don't put me in a cage-'
Castiel sits on a large rock, and Dean leans against one of the more sturdy crosses. He's done with his food in seconds, and Castiel feels a compulsive need to wipe the sauce off his face. Instead, he hands him his napkin and Dean begrudgingly cleans his mouth.
'She'd have my head if she saw you kneel, Dean,' Castiel rubs his arm and takes his hand, and goes to open the door. Dean follows reluctantly and alpha turns the doorknob.
Dean's mind almost yearns to find something sinister in it, because meeting with another alpha or beta to discuss movies is way too suspicious. But he keeps coming up short.
'I just mean...' Dean continues, seeming to realize that he's spoken so freely and trying to backtrack. 'No food's worth this much money. I thought I'd just eat a cheeseburger, I don't even know what half of this stuff means. Hors d'oeuvres, that's usually cheesy nachos in my world, not-' he trails off, trying to pronounce the word in the menu. 'Poolet foy pateh. I mean, I took cooking class and this is still beyond my training.'
Bert grunts, already busy eating, and alpha takes Dean into an elevator. Dean steps very close to him and holds his hand like an anchor.
'You like it though, don't you?' Castiel puts steak in the cart with a heavy thump. 'Do you want sausages?'
The image of Dean on his knees, with his cock in his mouth, staring up at him through his eyelashes, is going to stay with him forever.
They both look at the coffee table. The package in which Dean's things arrived is still there. With items Dean'd rather never see again.
'We have to make sure our next time is not in the car,' Castiel looks critical as he regards the interior. 'I really wanted to have this special time in a proper bed, with lots of space, but... you proved to be irresistible.'
Castiel never wondered how hard it is for an omega to get a successful job, but come to think of it, he has never met any omega doctors or lawyers or architects. 'So your alpha pays for your education and you feel compelled to get a degree you don't want? That must be wearisome.'
Finally, a car arrives. It's a black Dodge Charger, a massive modern car that Dean instantly hates. Fit for a lawyer, he guesses, but hadn't he taught Sam what
But as soon as he spots Dean, his shoulders hunch and his face changes, and he seems to turn into the scrawny kid brother - the one Dean would cook meals for, walk to school, wrestle with and watch cartoons all night fighting over cereal. He's the brother Dean sneaked into the cinema so they could watch scary movies when dad was gone, the brother who would get scared of the monster in the freezer and who'd bitch and moan about dad leaving again, and about target practice. The brother who fought three alphas at school when they made a comment about Dean being an omega, and he won. He's the one who left Dean in that camper with dad, left and went to look for a brighter future.
Castiel turns around to him and frowns a little. Dean knows he's looking at his collar. He's afraid to let him go alone.
'Alpha!' he exclaims from the stairs. Castiel turns around to him, startled, in the middle of making dinner. 'You're home. I'm so sorry, I fell asleep.'
'Yeah what are you afraid of,' the omega says in one breath, skeptical. It's obvious he's annoyed with himself, with his constant fear, and it makes Castiel mad at the unfairness of it. So,
He looks over at Cas, who seems tired even in his sleep, lines on his face, both from the pillow and because of Dean and his bullshit. Dean wants what's best for this guy, but whenever he tries, it's just never the right thing.
'I'm sorry, Dean,' Castiel shakes his head. 'I was wrong about Adler. I'm sorry you had to see that.'
'Stop,' Castiel orders, and Dean does, he stops dead in some half-bowed position and tries to breathe. Why the fuck did he say no? He knows better than that, and it's alpha Castiel, the one that will listen, so Dean could just say he felt scared or some other emo shit like that and he'd listen, he knows he would, so why-
'I mean, I wanted to, I guess,' he soldiers on. 'So I showed it to alpha. Wanted to ask him for advice. But it turned out he already knew you, and, well. The rest is history.'
Alpha pulls back with visible effort, his chest heaving with deep breaths. He uncaps the lube and Dean can see that his hands are shaking, too. His cock looks almost painfully hard.
'But he got the office,' Dean remembers, though he's pissed on alpha's behalf. That's probably why none of the other guys working at their computers greeted them. But that's fine, cause alpha has solid friends, and now he has him, too, and Dean will make sure he's happy.
tell me,' says Castiel, and the hand on his knee is back. For the first time ever, Dean feels like he draws some kind of strength from it. Castiel is so sincere, and he really listens, and at that moment, Dean thinks he doesn't mean anything bad at all and he really just wants to understand. Maybe even desperately so.
'No, of course not,' he says, his resolve breaking. He can't stay mad at Dean, not like this. It's so hard to believe he's capable of faking all those feelings, it's like the thought seems impossible, now, that he's facing Dean. 'I was just - it's alright. I've just gotten a call from the landlord, and it stressed me out.'
'That's unfortunate,' Castiel says, and his voice turns commanding. 'Because if you don't talk to me, you won't get my knot tonight.'
But he does, he thinks of Castiel, his strong handsome alpha, being thin and pale and naked, kneeling on the floor waiting for Alastair to come home. He thinks of Castiel rolling around at night and snuggling up to Alastair in bed, the only source of
'I won't ever kick you out, I thought I made that clear,' alpha stares at him seriously. 'If you can't trust that, trust the fact that we are legally bound to live together until the trial period ends. Which is six months, and we're not even past two.'
'Nice to meet you,' Dean offers quietly, not sure if he should speak at all, but the man surprises him again; he gets up, erratically, and comes over, around the table, only to shake his hand eagerly.
'I'm sorry, alpha, I didn't mean to-' he assures, quivering. Alpha approaches him slowly, past the couch and the coffee table, and there's fury in his eyes. But his face is schooled and he looks... calculated, and that's when Dean knows he's in really deep shit.
'-Dean, let me finish,' Castiel asks, not unkindly. 'I was thinking about an actual trip. To another city, or to the country.'
'I don't know,' Dean says. 'I stood there, like, in front of the door. He was inside, and I was gonna knock, but I thought - I thought how you said-'
'No one called me,' Dean replies. 'I was rottin' away in that motel room for days before I figured dad wasn't gonna come back. There were almost no beta pills left, so I took the Impala and drove to, uh, to you. But someone reported me. The guy at the gas station, I think, where I went to take a leak. He looked at me weird, probably smelled me, saw me drivin' on my own...'
He watches Dean take the ride loop after loop, and his omega spots him and then, a little timidly, raises his hand and waves, smiling. Castiel waves back, feeling warm and less lonely than ever, and... happy. He feels happy.
'How long has it been since your last trip to the cinema?' Castiel asks when they're waiting in the queue to get tickets. There aren't many people, but the alpha still keeps Dean close.
'We will. But first. I'm not mad at you, Dean, alright? I'm mad because I can't get through to you.'
Dean looks anxious at the mention of the rug - the thing that started it all, but doesn't talk about that when he opens his mouth to say:
'Yes, it's great news that my father's dead, Charlie,' Castiel replies bitterly and clenches his jaw with barely contained rage. Dean's surprised. The anger appeared out of nowhere and rose so quickly. He's scared to move in alpha's grip and even Charlie looks taken aback.
'It should be your decision,' Castiel says, upset. 'When it starts growing back, let's try to keep it and see if you like it.'
'Okay, since I already booked the sexiest plant out there, what are you gonna get, Dean?' Charlie asks kindly, still smiling.
'So?' she asks excitedly. She looks fresh and happy, as per usual, in a colorful T-shirt with a logo of some game or movie on it. Dean would probably recognize it, Castiel thinks.
He honors Dean's decision, of course, and his heart grows when they enter the building together. His omega's going with him. In the elevator, Dean’s shaking, but he wears a determined face. The spark of
'He's so sweet,' Castiel smiles widely. 'And strong, too. He likes movies, and music, and is amazing at cooking. He's funny, too, and smart, and hardworking and so caring. I could - I could talk to him for days. He knows so many things! I'm not very good with pop culture, but he explains everything to me. You should see him watching one of his western movies. He knows all the lines! I've never met anyone who could quote a whole movie like that. And -'
Seriously, it is okay. It startled him at first, but damn. With how... prepared he was since yesterday, waking up to
'Anything, dad?' Dean would ask then, hopeful and kind of excited, because dad was like a superhero, like an undercover detective who was going to find the bad guys and make them pay. Or better, like an outlaw - rolling into another town, tracking down evil, a man with no name and his two sons. It felt amazing to Dean, it felt like an adventure.
'We are mates, now,' the alpha says, like he's truly realizing that, as well. Dean nods. He's tired. Alpha must notice it, because he turns off the light.
He generously gives Dean a C+, but it bothers him hours later as he drives through the piles of snow with his wipers swinging furiously back and forth across his windshield. It's dark, but he thinks he sees a figure bundled in a coat trudging along the sidewalk with determination, almost fighting the wind and the snow. He slows down a little, and it's Dean; he doesn't know how, but some instinctual part of him knew that all along.
'Alright,' alpha relents, though it's clear he doesn't like it. 'Please wait right here, next to the fence. Do you still have your phone?'
'I know,' Dean nods, staring at the ground. 'And I'm kinda, you know, but maybe with you, I'd wanna see how it is? But I - I mean-' he trails off, shrugging, looking lost.
He comes out to see Dean dressed. He looks around the room; he'll have to make a draught to air out Dean's scent, hide his blankets, lock the upstairs door... There can be no evidence that he has an omega. And cover up his mating bite...
'Gotta - gotta untie'em,' he says, gently pushing Castiel away, and that small gesture is both powerful and sweet, because Castiel knows Dean never would've done that around Alastair. His brain only insists on one thing, though,
