Tony nudged him in the ribs, and his mouth switched with a suppressed smile. "Luck's not a stat in D&D, sunshine." He sounded immensely pleased with himself.
"And I'm so glad you love me," Steve murmured. "He didn't ruin this, okay? He doesn't get to ruin this. You love me and I love you back and that's got nothing to do with him. He's never, ever going to hurt you again." He met Tony's eyes, and he let himself smile. "It actually makes me awfully happy that you loved me first. Don't know if I ought to admit to that. But it's true."
"It's always been easy to be your friend," Steve returned. "I know you think it isn't. But it is. I can't say I've always agreed with you on the exact right way to do things," he admitted, "but being your friend has never, ever been the hard part, okay?"
"Interesting," Steve says, to Ghost, in his best Captain America voice. "That's quite a fervent opinion. Have you considered writing to your elected officials and expressing your views, rather than committing theft? Government is by and for the people, after all. I'm sure your senators would be happy to tell you their position on corporate taxation and anti-trust legislation."
But there's one more reason this should be impossible. All the Lifetime movies about grieving widows and widowers expiring with a cinematic and delicate exhalation of chrysanthemum petals -- they're not only trite, they're a lie. You can't fixate on a dead man. Not when you know they're dead. No one ever has.
Even Steve's superhuman endurance seems to have limits, and Tony's a little surprised when Steve sprawls forward, just barely catching himself with his hands so he doesn't crush Tony. He's lying atop Tony now, their bodies pressed together, chest to groin. The edges of the armoring of Steve's uniform dig into Tony's ribs, metal against sticky skin, but Tony wraps a lazy arm around him and pulls him closer anyway. He's definitely making a mess of Steve, but Steve burrows in close to him and doesn't seem to mind.
He'd managed to keep that fact hidden the whole time, as he and Thor had teleported Tony back to -- thankfully still nighttime -- New York, as they'd hustled him to the closest hospital. Steve can't quite shake the memory of holding Tony in his arms, the weight of him, even now that his arms are strapped down to the hospital bed. He carried him all the way here. Got him admitted.
Steve pocketed his keys, flipped the light switch on, and shut the door behind Tony. Tony was shivering, and Steve was positive it wasn't entirely the cold. But they were inside, so it was all right now, surely. Tony could let himself feel whatever he needed to feel.
"Mostly not," Steve said, which was true enough. "Mostly just upset at the thought of you being in mortal peril and not telling anyone. Do you think you could maybe let me know about that next time?" He knew the answer to that was probably no. "Can you at least tell me you're not still having heart attacks?"
The terrible, perverse thought enters his head: he knows how to remove Iron Man's helmet. He's pretty sure he knows where the releases are. He could do it, right now. Iron Man's asleep. He might not even wake up. And Steve could see his face. And he'd
Iron Man laughs again. "Yeah. Nothing to be done about that, I'm afraid. The armor has to stay on. You can't touch most of my body. Even if you're willing to keep your eyes shut. That's not the problem. You can't--
," Tony said, pained. "Here, here, I've got you. It's okay. It's great, actually." He crawled up the bed, pulled Steve into his arms, and stroked his hair, even though right now he was probably dying to come. "I just didn't expect it."
As Jan launched into her explanation, all he could think of was Tony, on the other side of the room. But Tony was going to come back soon. It couldn't take that long for him to tell Tiberius his idea. Then he'd be at Steve's side again, and all would be right with the world.
Steve could feel his mouth curve into a sad, sad smile. "Do you really need me to say it all again? I think I've hurt you enough."
"Oh, I know you've had gay friends," Tony said, barreling onward. He hardly sounded angry anymore. It had all drained away and there was, of course, self-loathing underneath. He just sounded... bitter and sad and lonely. "But you've never had a gay teammate, and I guess that--"
," Steve said, in a tone of voice he thought he usually reserved for telling Clint to cut out whatever he was doing.
Steve's jaw was tight, and Tony knew Steve was thinking the same thing he was. "Whole lot of holiday shoppers there this time of year," Steve said.
A groan escapes Steve's mouth. Tony's not wrong; Steve likes it a whole lot. Sometimes he feels a little guilty about just how much he likes Tony sucking him off, but mostly he likes it too much to care about anything else once Tony's on his knees. He spent the entirety of the dessert course tonight watching Tony lick creme brul√©e off a spoon, Tony silently teasing him from across the table. All he can think about now is coming in Tony's sweet, hot, pliant mouth.
Stunned into silence, into inaction, Steve's hands freeze. He didn't know. He never suspected. He'd never wanted to pry. He just assumed it was another one of those things Iron Man was private about, a way to disguise his identity, but the armor is keeping him
Tony reached up and covered Steve's hand on his shoulder with his own. For some reason, Tony's hands felt a lot warmer than usual. Maybe Steve was cold. His thoughts weren't fitting together right.
"Yes?" Steve asked, faux-innocently, as he kicked his underwear off the rest of the way and showily fondled his cock on the way back up, the leather of his cuffs sliding against his slick, flushed erection. He would have made a beautiful picture.
Steve sprawled back on the bed, breathing hard, content to just lie there. Maybe Tony could come up and hold him. Except first he probably ought to get the condom--
Steve's face fell. "Oh," he said, in a considerably more morose tone. "I was-- I was just hoping you had some news about Hank or Jan." He sighed and stepped back, waving Tony in. "Well, come on in anyway, Shellhead. I'm not going to leave you standing in the hallway."
And then Tony was finally standing again and -- three, two, one, oh yeah, he had full power. Things were looking up now. Repulsors were online, and he keyed into Steve's private comms.
"He was the only man who ever loved me," Tony whispered, and it took everything in Steve not to react, to let none of his foolish, ill-fated heart show on his face.
He didn't exactly have a convenient way to rig Steve -- even if his bedframe had any anchor points, which it didn't, Tony was sure Steve was capable of breaking the bed. He'd have to figure something out.
"Is this about the structural integrity? Because we've been given the all-clear on that, and besides, everyone else in the building right now can fly." He thumped his own chest, lightly, for emphasis. "We're actually safer than a construction crew. If you fall, I promise I'll catch you."
Tony gently tugged one of Steve's fingers away and peered at him. "What?" he asked. His voice was kind. He'd always been kind. "What is it? It can't be that bad."
The elevator doors shut behind Steve, and he fished his Stark Tower access card out of his pocket and swiped it through the reader. The elevator promptly glided into motion, starting the long ascent to the penthouse suite. Steve smoothed his palms self-consciously over the front of his shirt one last time, then adjusted his shirt collar again. He was being silly. Tony wasn't going to care what he was wearing. Tony was just going to be happy to see him.
Her eyes were unfocused as she sailed backwards and up and up, at least four or five feet, letting the momentum carry her away. At about ten feet she stabilized into what was clearly controlled flight, grinning as she flipped around in midair, swinging back in his direction like he was an anchor and she was at the other end of the chain.
"Seriously, though," Steve says, because he doesn't want Tony to dodge this. "Please tell me if it hurts in the bad way. No toughing this one out. I just want you to feel good tonight, okay?"
"No-- I-- I'm sorry-- I didn't mean-- I'm sorry." Steve stammered his way through the apology. God, he was saying it all wrong. "I was trying to say that we've made up. We've talked it all out. All of that is over. It's forgiven. Everyone makes mistakes. I don't hold any of them against you." He held out his hands, imploring. Tony was still trembling where he stood. "And you know I've made mistakes too," he continued. "Hell, there was that time we were going up against Korvac and I took a swing at you." He'd felt terrible then. He felt worse now. "I'm not perfect. I know that. And I hope you wouldn't hold my mistakes against me, either."
"Anyway," Steve said. "It wasn't about that. I just-- I just figured you didn't want me looking at the scars on your chest. That was all."
He hated to let Tony out of his sight, but it would only be for a minute, he told himself, as he turned to head to the other room.
Therefore, he was going to have to ask either Dane or Monica if the box belonged to them. And, since Dane actually did have a legitimate, non-kinky reason to have a crop around, asking him was, Tony realized, definitely going to be the easier option. All he had to do was show up at the hospital for visiting hours tomorrow. That'd be a nice thing to do anyway. He could see Jarvis first, maybe, then go see Dane. Bring them both some flowers. He could sit at Dane's bedside and say, ever so casually:
Steve didn't know what Tony thought he had to be sorry for now, but whatever it was, he was certain it wasn't actually Tony's fault.
It feels like he's been waiting forever, and Tony must know that, because Tony doesn't tease him anymore. Tony doesn't make him beg for it. Tony just strokes him, just the way he likes it, his grip sure and confident, and it's not long before Steve can feel his release gathering and building in him. He thrusts up into Tony's fist, wanting more, and Tony gives him more, exactly the rhythm he wants.
It's probably a good thing he can't talk. He'd ruin it. He ruins a lot of things these days. He pictures Sharon walking away for the last time. He pictures dark rooms in Hong Kong and Madripoor. He pictures himself loading a gun.
"I do need to eat sooner rather than later," Steve admitted, a little guiltily, "but I'm definitely not opposed to staying here a little longer." He didn't quite want to rejoin the outside world yet. He slid an arm over Tony's side. "I like the thought of dating you, though. A lot."
Steve inhaled hard and took an unsteady step backwards; the words were a punch he hadn't braced for. Tony didn't know, he reminded himself. Tony didn't know he liked him and he certainly wasn't going to tell him and that meant he had to stand here and take it.
"I've got a shot," Tony said, and Steve obligingly edged just a little to the right to make room, because after a decade, Steve knew where he was without even having to look. Tony raised his hands. "I'm taking it."
had. And maybe Tony would have wanted it like that anyway. Steve didn't know. But Tiberius had never, ever given Tony the choice. So Steve knew exactly what Tony had done and what he hadn't. Tony was the one who had gotten done to, because that was what was gay, wasn't it?
Steve blocked, one two three, and then grunted as the fourth blow slammed into his chest, rattling his teeth. He couldn't keep this up for very long, but he was, he hoped, making a respectable showing of himself.
-- distressed. He'd be wanting to know why those people were dressed like that in public, or not dressed in anything at all, or why they were hitting each other.
Steve couldn't resist reaching out and tracing the curve of Tony's smile with his thumb; Tony kissed the pad of his thumb as it slid across his lips.
"You're not alone," Steve says, softly, even though he knows perfectly well that what Tony means is that Steve isn't touching him, and there's nothing Steve can do about that. "I'm right here. I'm going to stay right at your side. All you have to do is follow my orders." He mouths the last words, silent, his back still blocking the camera, so that only Tony will see him. "I know you're good at that."
." He slides his hand up Iron Man's arm appreciatively. His fingertips bump the edge of the chestplate, when he gets to Iron Man's shoulder.
"I'm not dying," Tony said, quietly. His voice seemed caught in his chest; there was a low, hoarse note in the bottom of it. "You don't have to worry about that, all right? And I'm good to go. I can still be an Avenger." Tony offered up this fact as if it were his sole accomplishment. And then there was anguish in his eyes. "But
There's a low hum, an almost-pleasant warmth spreading out from the back of his neck, and then Steve can move again. Thank God. He takes a deep breath, stretches a little, and shakes out his hands. All better.
That news crew probably hadn't. Not at that distance. Steve shut his eyes in misery. Tiberius had killed his own people for-- for
He shouldn't. He didn't need one. For God's sake, he wasn't the one who'd just suffered massive cardiac problems. It would be selfish. And he was supposed to not be touching Tony. He wasn't going to think of it as something other than friendship -- he wasn't that far gone -- but even if it wasn't inappropriate, surely it would be easier to stop pining after Tony if he cut down even a little bit on touching him.
He already has the setting planned out: in the kitchen, in the morning, over coffee. Iron Man can't drink hot coffee, of course, but he likes to have iced coffee through a straw. Even though Iron Man doesn't live at the mansion like Steve does -- none of the rest of the team lives here full-time -- somehow he's always the first one there after Steve gets up. By the time Steve comes back from his morning run, Iron Man is usually there in the kitchen, slurping away; if there's no Avengers business for the day and he's not needed immediately to guard Mr. Stark over at SI, then he usually has some time to spare for Steve. It'll be perfect.
"Steve?" Carol asked, a little bit more urgently. She sounded... distraught? "Steve, I think you broke your hand. Maybe your wrist too."
Tony kisses him again, lightly. "Happy anniversary," he says again, his voice soft. "I'm hoping for a lot more of 'em with you."
His fingertips travel past the edge of the gauntlet, onto the golden metal that covers Iron Man's arm. Steve wasn't expecting it to feel any different, but it does; the metal curves, molded to Iron Man's skin, and all Steve can think is that he's almost touching Iron Man.
, and it wasn't fair. It should have stopped you." He was yelling now. "But nothing stopped you, Tony!"
With his left boot halfway off, Steve stopped and stared at Tony. That had been-- God, the last time he'd seriously been painting, he'd been a working commercial artist. The last time Tony had watched him paint had to have been at least six or seven years ago. Tony had loved him for that long? He supposed it wasn't all that surprising, since he'd definitely loved Tony for that long. But it was different hearing it.
Then he realizes Tony is shivering. Tony wasn't wearing much under the armor. He's down to his boxers, and, well, the armor was what was keeping him warm. And they don't have spare clothing.
But pleasure, Tony knew, was better mixed with pain, so he stepped back and hit Steve again, again, again, until he couldn't count the blows, until Steve couldn't do more than sob, until his sides were heaving. Tony was sweating. His arms were sore, aching. Steve's ass and thighs were a solid mess of black and blue welts; he looked like he'd been in an accident. It would be gone by morning, but it looked like it hurt enough now. Tony could see why it would have terrified most other tops. But as far as he was concerned Steve was goddamn beautiful like this.
Steve wants to hold him, to cradle him close and tell him he'll keep him safe, tell him he'll do everything he can. He thinks now is probably not the time for that.
This isn't good. Of course this isn't good. But they've all had worse, and they got through that, and they'll get through this, too. It's going to be all right. It has to be.
"Don't know," Tony says, on another shaky exhale. There's a flash of an unsteady smile, one Steve's never seen in the magazines. His eyes are wide and dark. "Which answer will get you to keep doing that?"
The drive skitters and slides across the floor, and the pressure on Steve's back moves higher. Steve bets that's Ghost shifting his weight to try to grab the drive.
"I want a drink," Tony said, his voice shot through with the deepest misery. He hung his head. "God, Steve, you have no idea how much I want a drink right now. I'm-- I'm so scared I'll do it. I should be better. I should be better than my addictions. I shouldn't want this. But I do. I want it so much. I know it's wrong. I know
"Put the Quincarrier on autopilot," Tony said, and he watched as Steve did it, unhesitatingly, "and we're going to have a talk about what you can and can't have."
He's ice-cold. He's still shivering. Steve tells himself that's actually a good sign; it's when you're cold enough that you stop shivering that you
"There's that harness in your box," Tony said, hopefully. God, he was getting hard again at just the thought. "I think he'd really like to see you in that. And nothing else."
"You're so beautiful," Tony said. "I'm so happy you wanted this. You have no idea." And then he stopped, awkward, because he hadn't meant to say that. It felt too real, too intimate. Even if Steve wanted to do this again, he shouldn't let himself think that it meant that Steve was someone he could keep. It didn't work like that.
He wants to rephrase himself as soon as he's said it; perhaps it's only due to the direction his thoughts have been tending lately, but to him the words sound laden with innuendo.
"You should have seen the crash, though," Tony continued, tying the bandage off and moving to Steve's elbow, and that was when Steve realized that Tony was trying to distract him. "It was a spectacular landing, if I do say so myself." He half-smiled. "I like to wake up every morning and ask myself what I can do to make the Aviation Safety Reporting System cry today. I think we make up half their crashes every year, between the suits and the jets."
He typed a command on the keyboard and the television behind him lit up. On the screen was the same woman who was currently seated in the recliner, now dressed in a sequined costume, standing in... an ice-skating rink?
"Like, uh, footie pajamas," Iron Man continues. "As you can see. So I thought, well... it might be nice to be able to... wear a little less metal around you." He sounds hopeful.
So he got his keys out, unlocked the door himself, slowly eased the door open, stepped in, and just as slowly closed the door behind himself, as close to silent as he could be. He didn't want to make noise. He didn't want to draw anyone's attention.
"Yeah," Steve said again, even more hoarsely. "Yeah, it's-- it's because of Tony." He licked his lips and tried to swallow. "We had, um. We had a disagreement about the appropriate level of involvement for me in, um. In Tony's current... difficulties."
The eggs finished cooking, and Tony slid them out onto the plate, added salt and pepper, added the toast, and then, with a flourish, placed the plate on the table in front of Steve.
"I think so," Steve says. "Maybe. And, uh, I think it likes your color scheme. I like your color scheme."
Tony tried to reach for his faceplate again. He didn't make it this time either. He grabbed Steve's hand and tugged feebly upwards.
"I'm glad to hear that," Steve said, because he was, of course he was. "Still doesn't mean she should ever have touched you, though."
"I wish I could touch you," Steve says. The need is a physical ache, throbbing beneath his breastbone. It's not quite desire, it's not quite lust, not right now, but it's
"Yeah, honey," Tony said. "That's kind of the point. Can't get any painkillers worth a damn in you with your metabolism the way it is, so this is how you're going to get your nice happy endorphins."
He imagined giving his own cock a few good strokes, coming on Steve's ass, marking up Steve's bruises even more with his own come, rubbing it in and making Steve cry more with the pain of just a touch. God, that was a nice thought. Maybe next time.
That wasn't exactly how the saying went, he knew. He didn't exactly have the spare brain cells for witty repartee right now.
If Steve hadn't already known Tony was nowhere near his usual state of mind, that statement would have told him. Tony doesn't like talking about those days. Of course he doesn't want to dwell on it. But sometimes when he's tired, or when he's already had a lousy day, or in the aftermath of a terrible fight, he'll let all the walls fall. And Steve supposes that tonight has been all three of those things.
," Tony said, hoarsely, and his voice broke on the word, and he was a coward twice over, he was begging, he'd done nothing to merit this, but he could see the precise moment, the anguish reflected in Steve's eyes, when Steve finally gave in.
But, Steve realizes in a sudden flash of inspiration, it doesn't have to be one or the other. Tony likes to be touched, and hugs are too little but sex is too much. But those aren't the only two options. There's a whole spectrum of possibilities. There are a lot of ways to touch someone.
Steve glanced down at the pile of wrappings and tape on the closest bench and then glanced away again. He didn't want to use any of it, and he couldn't quite say why.
In the photograph, Tiberius could walk again; Steve could tell this because he was being marched out the front door of ViaStone in the direction of a waiting police cruiser.
"It's not your fault." Tony sighed, heavily. "I'll admit that this is definitely not the model I would have picked for myself, but I didn't exactly have a choice. So."
He hadn't expected Tony to take his hand. Tony cradled his hand with one palm; his other hand slid over Steve's inner arm. Tony's fingers were warm and callused, softly stroking Steve's two bared fingers, tracing a path over his palm, his wrist, down to the end of the splint and back again. He held Steve's hand carefully, at the same angle Steve had held it forth, obviously trying not to rotate any part of his arm.
Tony smiled, but then he sighed heavily and rolled over, making way for Steve to get up. "I know, I know," he said, with obvious regret. "Time to get back to work."
He pictured Steve working the plug into himself, red metal against slick skin. Did Steve-- Jesus, did Steve
That's not a good sentence, is it? The team had been watching TV a few months ago, and when the woman on-screen had said that very phrase to someone who was presumably her boyfriend, Jan had rolled her eyes and called it
Geez, Steve was weird today. It was understandable -- but even so, there was something really off. Maybe Tony could talk to him later; maybe they could get dinner together or something, like they used to. He just wanted Steve to be okay. But maybe Steve needed time to deal with the loss of the mansion, and maybe dwelling on the past was the wrong thing.
"Oh." Tony echoes the sound. "Oh, that's gorgeous." He's still slurring his words. "That for me? Gonna give that to me?" He licks his lips once more, opens his mouth wide.
The weird thing is, it's actually not something he's ever offered Tony, in all the years he's known him. The first few years, Tony didn't want anyone to touch him at all, not that Steve knew why at the time. And then after that, Steve would have felt guilty asking, even though he would have liked to and there have certainly been times when Tony clearly needed help with his aching muscles; it's not that it's a sex thing, or that it always has to be a sex thing -- though sometimes it definitely has been, in Steve's experience -- but he felt that coming up with excuses to touch a man who he was almost positive didn't want him would have been a massive impropriety on his part. So he'd let someone else help Tony, or he'd let Tony take care of it himself. That was better all-round. So he didn't offer it, and Tony never asked him for it, and Steve figured that that was just where they stood, on the matter. An unspoken compromise.
Tony's hands go to his waist, and he undoes his belt and then the fly of his pants before pulling out his soft cock. With one hand he grabs Steve by the hair and gently tugs him closer; with his other hand he presses his fingers past Steve's lips, opens his mouth for him, and eases his dick in like he's feeding it to him.
like you," Steve repeated. It wasn't really repeating himself, though. Maybe it was more important, this way. "And that's the truth."
Now it was Tony's turn to pout. "I mean, you don't have to," Tony said. He stared down at his plate, poked the side of his bagel with his butter knife, and didn't even pick the bagel up. "Of course you don't have to. I just-- Ty was my best friend, growing up. And it'd mean a lot to me to get to introduce you to him. Because you're-- you're my best friend now, you know?" Tony's complexion was a little too dark to blush, but the smile he directed at his plate was small and embarrassed. "I think you'd like him. I hope you'd like him." His words came slower now, halting. "Maybe it's silly of me, hoping all my friends will get along--"
Anyone who's picked up a newspaper in the past year knows Captain America and Tony Stark are a couple. But very few people know what that means about Captain America and Iron Man. And Ghost isn't one of them.
Steve bottoms out, his balls slapping Tony's ass. They both groan at the same time, and for an instant there's a glimmer of light in Steve's eyes that's all fire, that isn't
Because Steve hadn't managed to say anything, Tony glared up at him. "I can't believe I have to say this," he said, spitting out the words, and he was tired, of course he was tired, that was probably why he was so angry, "but I'm definitely not going to try anything. Your virtue is safe from me, okay?"
Tony clearly hadn't let Tiberius know about his secret identity, then. Steve was relieved to hear it. He couldn't say why, but he just didn't
After a few minutes of animated conversation with a sergeant at the barrier, Steve hefted his shield and jogged back to rejoin the rest of the team. Somewhere, in the crowd behind the barrier, a photographer's flashbulb went off. Tony tried not to cringe. Oh, Jameson was going to
And sure, there had been times when Steve and Tony hadn't been speaking to each other, at odds over this thing or that, but Tony had always still been alive. They'd always had a chance to come back to each other.
Before Tony could really process what was happening, Steve was crouching down again, leaning in. Steve's mouth was warm on his, a brief kiss that promised more. Tony wasn't entirely sure that he hadn't imagined it.
Steve turned around and tried to see what Tony was seeing in the crowd. No one was standing out. Not to him.
Iron Man's laugh now is a startled one, like he hadn't expected Steve to make him laugh at all. "You boo the Yankees, Winghead, and we don't make it out of the stadium alive."
Steve looked unfazed. Steve was, in fact, smiling at him. Steve had kissed him. Steve had really kissed him.
"Anyway," Steve said. "He's up there, and he's been messing with the electricity somehow. The escalators are all down, as well as the elevators, so it'll be a long walk up, and we're probably only getting emergency lights. But the power drain is fluctuating, so he's definitely doing
But Tony deviated from the plan, sitting up, pulling Steve in close, and then kissing him. His hands settled, very politely, at Steve's waist, but his mouth told a different story. He sure wasn't kissing Steve politely. His mouth was hot and knowing -- not rough, not demanding, but full of a desperate desire, a desire that had been building for years, a thirst that couldn't be slaked with just one kiss. It was raw and real, messy and hot and wet. It was a kiss that promised more -- not in the way where the kiss was an obvious and perfunctory prelude to sex, a step on the checklist of turning someone on, but a kiss that promised still more feeling yet to come, more and more of everything.
Iron Man angles his body toward him, leaning in a little closer, and then he reaches out and takes one of Steve's hands in both of his own. Steve's not surprised that Iron Man has good hands. The fabric of his gloves is soft against the calluses of Steve's fingers, roughened by catching his shield every day, and Iron Man hums softly as he smooths out the muscles of Steve'a palm. Then he slides one of his hands down, his thumb dancing over the sensitive skin of Steve's wrist, and Steve just barely chokes back a moan, because he's pretty sure Iron Man didn't intend to elicit this reaction from just a touch.
The faintest smile twitched at the corners of Steve's mouth. Tony would sell everything he owned to make Steve smile again.
"Good," Steve says, as soothingly as possible. "Good job, T-- Shellhead." He catches himself just in time, before he slips up in public. That doesn't usually happen. He's not at his best either, obviously. But he's better off than Tony is. "I'm going to be right here the whole time. You just have to do what I say. I know you can do that. I'm not going to let anything happen to you. All right?"
Abuse didn't always look like the stories. Steve knew that. Abusers weren't always terrible one hundred percent of the time. If they were, no one would ever let them get close to them. They could be charming. They could be sweet. They could be kind. Just like anyone else. It was just that... they weren't really like that, where it counted.
Tony coughed, and when he looked back, he could see Tony's face flushed, ever so slightly. "Um," Tony said, hesitantly. "Actually, if you'd let me, I was wondering if I could ride pillion."
"I'm just--" he mumbled. "I'm... sensitive. It doesn't take much to get me there. Not since the serum, anyway. And you're just so--" he gestured, out of words to describe what Tony was doing to him. "The first one's always pretty fast. Not usually this fast, but I'm, um. Very excited."
Tony was clapping along with the rest of them, and when Steve turned, Tony looked oddly like he was about to cry. It seemed like a little much for a product that sounded like a fancier VCR. Not that it wasn't an impressive feat of modern technology, but Steve didn't understand being moved to tears by it.
He shook the box again, hopeful for more answers. It sounded like there was only that one metal object left, banging against the sides. Given everything else here, he was more than a little surprised that there wasn't a collar -- but, well, sometimes people had very specific beliefs about those.
The world is lonely and cold and closing in on him. He'll never be warm again. He can't feel his fingers. His face is going numb.
"If it's sleep you want," Steve offered, "I can think of something nice we can do that might even get you to fall asleep after. If you're interested."
He did, in fact, box up the photographs of him and Tony, but before he could put the box in the closet he had to stop, because he was getting far too misty-eyed. And, unfortunately, the process of boxing them all up had necessitated looking at them.
But he has to say something. What kind of excuse can he give for Tony's absence? Maybe he can say Tony's injured. No, he'd need medical records to back that up. Tony's asleep? Not good enough. He can't think. He can't think of anything.
"I'm not gay," Steve said, helpfully but also extremely confusingly, and Tony turned around. "I looked it up, and I think they call it
Their disused comm line crackles to life in Steve's ear. "Cap, there's a kid here." Iron Man's voice is tense. "He's scared, but I've got him. This place is falling apart. Hang on, we're coming out."
The endearment made something go fuzzy and bright inside Steve. He wanted Tony to call him that again. He wanted Tony to call him
It would have been easier if Tiberius had been hitting Tony. It wouldn't have been better, by any means, but it would have been simpler. Steve would have had something to point to -- a scrape, a scratch, the shadows of healing bruises. He would have been able to show Tony a sign that something wasn't right. Tangible proof.
And then, all at once, he can see his assailant; Ghost has gone visible. Ghost is holding him, almost bending him backwards. One of Ghost's feet is braced in front of his. His white-clad arm is pressed into Steve's throat. Steve can't see much more than that. It's getting harder to see.
"The way Beast explained it to me once," Steve said, knowing everything was riding on this, "was that you might think you can read, but the parts of your brain that are actually responsible for reading aren't awake enough while you're asleep for you to actually read anything. Anything you think you can read is either a vague impression of ideas or something you've memorized. Or it's total nonsense if you try reading it."
Steve lowered the phone. He couldn't bring himself to close it. This was real, he told himself. This was really happening.
Steve was beginning to see where Ultron might fit into this. If Ultron had been Hank's AI experiment, then Jocasta was Hank's AI experiment's AI experiment. Ultron's intended bride. Except Jocasta, thank God, had always had a mind of her own.
"Yeah, but that's passive," Tony retorted. "To pick it up, you'd have to actively be monitoring for it and looking for my position, and you'd never--"
As it is, he's pretty damn surprised when he turns the corner into an alcove of computer terminals and comes face-to-face with Ghost.
Steve kind of can't believe that Tony's making jokes about this, but then again, it's Tony, because he can. And he knows Tony well enough to know that even when Tony sounds cavalier about his own mortality, he's actually anything but.
Steve doesn't know Mr. Stark well at all, but it seems like Mr. Stark is trying hard. Like he wants to be friends, even after the last conversation they had. Steve can at least hear him out. Steve can at least be in the same room as him. It won't kill him.
Getting himself on one of Tiberius Stone's channels turned out to be surprisingly easy. All Steve had to do was call. One of the producers of a show called 20 Vision assured him that they'd be happy to have Captain America make an appearance, and was Monday too soon?
He can't. Tony's going to be a mess if Steve leaves him in this state. He can't leave Tony. But Jan doesn't know that. Jan thinks she's interrupting an ordinary, vanilla, romantic evening. She thinks that, at worst, she interrupted them having sex -- which she did. But the thing is, it's not exactly the kind of sex they can stop and walk away from, at this point.
Steve stroked the line of Tony's spine, down and up again, as far up as his neck, not daring to move past the collar of his shirt and touch him skin to skin. He couldn't in good conscience tell himself that that would be only for Tony and not for him. So he didn't. Besides, Tony had said he'd hit his head earlier, and Steve definitely didn't want to poke any tender spots again.
Subspace is one of those things they don't usually get a chance to play with. With their lives the way they are, it's too risky to put Tony in an altered state of consciousness very often; the team could need him, armed and ready, at any minute. Steve's a little jealous of all those kinksters who can go to a dungeon and do this every Saturday night. Some part of him wishes that could be him. But he's only a little jealous. He loves Tony too much to actually be jealous. He doesn't want anyone else.
Steve nodded. "Yeah. You can decide if you want me, Tony, but you can't actually decide if I want you. I've made up my mind. I'm not changing it. And, if you want me, I'm right here."
Iron Man's head is now tilted in the other direction. He's curious now, that's for certain. They've been friends ever since Steve joined the team, but Steve's never asked him any kind of intimate question. Not like this. Iron Man's secret identity is paramount. But he doesn't need to know who Iron Man is to have a good time, and he hopes Iron Man feels the same way about him.
She shakes her head. "He's made no demands. He came in through the window -- right through the closed window, dozens of floors in the air -- and after that, the security cameras in the section cut out. We're fairly certain he's still on the floor, though."
Steve's hands were shaking. There was a voicemail. Tony had probably just left it. Steve put the box down, dialed into his voicemail, and pressed the phone to his ear.
Steve winced. Duane Freeman hadn't made any calls to them yet -- at least, none that Steve knew about -- but the prospect didn't exactly fill Steve with happiness. While Freeman had no direct control over the team roster, he was definitely capable of tangling up the Avengers' lives with far more red tape than necessary if he had a point to make. Steve's jaw tightened. He glanced over at Jan. She looked equally unenthused. After several more seconds, Tony turned the paper right side up.
"Right," Steve said, and he wrapped an arm around Tony's lower back as he escorted him off the escalator landing. It was a move Steve probably would not have dared to make yesterday but which Tony was most definitely in favor of, even if he couldn't feel it. "This is our stop. Thor, you're one floor up. Keep your comms on."
Steve smiled at him. "Can do, Shellhead." He paused as a thought occurred to him. "Hey, I'm going to get to call you Shellhead
"Thank you," Steve says, a little awkwardly. He's never really known how to handle being complimented for the serum; it's not like he made it, after all. He's just the lucky recipient. But it's part of him, isn't it? It doesn't really matter how he got it. If he'd been born running hot, he wouldn't have minded Tony liking it. So he shouldn't mind this.
"I want you," Tony told him, and Steve beamed back. "You and no one else ever again in my entire life. Just you." He considered his words, now that he'd said them. "I'm incredibly high right now, aren't I?"
And then Iron Man kneels down, putting himself on a level with the kid. "Hey, there," he says. His voice is low, soft, gentle. "You're not in trouble, I promise. I'm Iron Man, and this is my friend Captain America--" he gestures at Steve-- "and we're going to stay here with you until your parents show up. What's your name?"
"Sounds good," Steve said, and gave him a courteous three seconds to get all his lights and repulsors back on before he sprang forward, turned, and charged the open warehouse doorway.
The noise Iron Man makes now sounds almost sad, and Steve has no idea why. Does Iron Man have something against baseball? He's never seemed particularly negative about it before.
"No one ever does," Steve said, too blissed-out to be more than only a little bitter. "I know I don't look like the type. Captain America's supposed to be strong, manly, and silent. I know."
Tony's throat worked. "It bothers me, though." He sighed. "I just... don't think I'm worth the wait, is all."
And, of course, it was Tony. That gave it even more meaning. That made it perfect. He'd wanted to be here for so long. Right here. With Tony. And here he was. For good. Tony still hadn't said it. But he still knew.
Tony's hand closes very lightly about the base of Steve's cock and holds still. Tony's grinning. "Do you need me
"Ride along with Starsky and Hutch!" Tiberius said. Oh, that was a TV show. Steve had heard of that one. "Any world you want to be in, DreamVision can take you there."
," Steve said, under his breath. Tony tipped his head back in Steve's direction. His eyes were very wide. "Don't look, okay? Don't look, Shellhead."
If she had been someone Jim had met, Steve should definitely have known the name; Steve knew Tony had met Jim when he'd become Iron Man, but he'd gotten the impression that they hadn't really had a chance to be friends until after the Avengers had started. Surely the time after that was accounted for. He thought he knew everyone Tony had dated since they'd met. "No," Steve said, confused. "Should he have?"
"I'll do what I can, Cap," Tony offered, because now was definitely not the time to explain his credentials.
"Absolutely not," Tony said, but he did stroke the back of Steve's hand. "You're wearing a seatbelt all the way home."
Feeling like he ought to stop cowering, like he ought to apologize properly, Steve rises unsteadily to his feet. "I really am sorry, though."
"Don't you think I know what it's like to be hurt?" Tony whispered, and his voice shook with the echoes of remembered pain.
Apparently Tiberius didn't even need to come up with his own excuses anymore. Tony could make them for him just fine. So when Tiberius kept hurting him, Tony was going to keep making excuses. Maybe then he'd start hitting him. Tony would probably find a way to justify that too.
It didn't matter, Steve told himself again. Tony would get the message when he got the message. There was no point worrying about it. And, at any rate, Tony had definitely promised him brunch tomorrow. And, with judicious use of Tony's name, Steve could probably still get them reservations even if he called the restaurant tomorrow morning.
Mr. Stark, on the other hand, stops breathing entirely. This is fair. It's probably a surprise; Steve hasn't actually told him -- or anyone else in this century -- that he's queer too, even if the internet was all too happy to inform him about Mr. Stark's proclivities. After a few seconds Mr. Stark swallows hard, mustering what has to be a remarkable amount of courage, and he says, "It doesn't have to be a date. But if you wanted it to be one -- I'd be really happy to hear that."
Steve reached back and grabbed his shield. He didn't think Tiberius was going to try anything, but he sure wasn't about to give him the opportunity. "Ready."
"You weren't wrong," Tony rasps, and Steve is distracted by the knowledge that Tony's voice is hoarse because he's been enthusiastically deepthroating Steve, and, God, he hopes the vocal filters will mask that, and-- wait, that wasn't what Tony should have said at all.
The other tidbits of information are smaller, but no less personal: Iron Man likes dogs. Iron Man is left-handed. Iron Man is afraid of the dark. Steve savors every scrap of information.
The worst parts of Steve's job -- well, other than the supervillains, that was a given -- were the parts where he didn't get to be with Tony. Oh, Tony had a lot of responsibilities at Stark Solutions and Steve didn't begrudge him any of them; he knew what it was like to work two jobs, even if he'd never been a CEO. But somehow the worst parts, the very worst indignities, were when Steve had to see Tony and he didn't even get to get close to him.
Tony had a talent for getting under his skin, but not always the way that sounded. Sure, sometimes it was in irritation, in anger. But sometimes, like now, it felt like Tony had reached inside him when he wasn't looking, had found his soul, had pressed himself up against it in a way no one should have been able to. But Tony knew him. Tony had always known him. This was how they'd worked. He felt exposed, exposed in a way he hadn't known it was possible to be exposed. It was honestly more than a little frightening, finding out he'd already let Tony in like this.
But Tony's already ahead of him. "Towels are with the rest of the linens, if you don't mind getting them," he says, and, oh,
"You see that, outside?" Steve rasped. "It's over. You're going to pay for everything you've done. They're here for you."
. You were always desperate for even the slightest hint of affection. So I gave you more. I always gave you more. You're an addict, Tony. I figured that out twenty whole years before you ever did. So I got you hooked. And you let me do whatever I wanted."
, Tony thinks, and he bites the inside of his cheek hard so he doesn't laugh at his own stupid joke.
Steve's still got his arm around Tony's waist as they step out of the elevator together. Tony's still fully armored, so he definitely can't feel it, but Steve knows he appreciates the gesture anyway. Tony's not leaning into him like he otherwise might have, like he sometimes does, but Steve knows now that means he's not doing better. Far from it. Tony's not leaning into him solely because he's still letting the armor hold him upright, and that means he still can't even walk unaided.
"Mmm," Steve said, thoughtfully. "You ever considered the idea that you might be wrong about that particular fact?"
The serum had healed him enough, by that point, that sunlight wasn't deadly to him. Oh, he hadn't been all the way better; it had stung a little and he wouldn't have wanted to spend a lot of time in the sun, but it had been tolerable.
Steve exhaled hard and told himself not to fantasize about tucking Tony into bed. That was probably a weird fantasy, right? Yeah, that was a weird fantasy. That wasn't even a
Now that's even more surprising. Steve could tell Iron Man really liked kids in about thirty seconds flat. Maybe no one else he'd been with had seen him interact with them -- but still, it's a heck of an assumption for everyone to make about him.
Steve slaps the sticker on the middle of his chest, right in the center of the star. The little Iron Man figure glitters in the sunlight.
Steve takes a steadying breath and hopes he doesn't sound too obviously like he's been doing... well, what he's been doing. He probably does. He opens an audio channel anyway. Video would not be a wise choice. His cock's still hanging out of his pants. There are still bruises on his neck from Tony's kisses, from earlier in the evening.
The sound Iron Man makes this time is a falling tone, half-mechanical. "I wish you could too," he says, and he sounds like it's killing him to admit this, like he thinks the need for human contact is a weakness. "No one does, really. No one has in a long time."
"Sure," Iron Man says, amiably. "Of course I do. Don't most people?" He sticks the straw back in his mouth-slit and keeps drinking.
doesn't make me weak. And I learned to get up. I learned to fight back." His gaze flickered over to Steve, ever so briefly, a small smile on his face, as if he wanted Steve to know exactly who he'd learned that from. How could it have been him? He hadn't even known Tony, then. "And I learned to keep fighting," Tony continued, head held high. "With words, with fists, with ideas, with every ounce of determination in my body. I'm stronger than you, Ty. I always have been. And I always will be."
Steve stops; he's hit his mark now, an actor waiting for the spotlight -- or, when he thinks about it, the exact opposite. "No, thank you."
"I think if you walk into the knife," Tony said, quietly, "they call it suicide." His eyes were deep and dark. Night-sky indigo. The vast emptiness of space. And then he seemed to realize what he was saying, and he shook himself. He ran his fingers through his hair. "Sorry, I-- I'm not that badly off. You don't need to worry about that." His mouth twisted. "This is actually me trying not to get hurt. And failing at it."
This is getting worse and worse. Also, Tony does not have FDR's dates memorized. "So that means that today is...?"
So Ghost's tech is all still working, and he's probably in the middle of taking whatever he wants to take. But if he's disabled the cameras, it probably means that he's not expecting company right now, and he's either still visible himself or whatever he's doing would leave obvious traces on camera. And that means that, if Steve can see him, he still has a chance of catching him.
"Picture this in the news, though." Tony sounded wretched, and also like he definitely hadn't actually heard anything Steve had said. "
When the two of them are the last Avengers remaining in the room, Steve clears his throat and stands up. He debates pulling the cowl off and then decides against it. Iron Man doesn't need to see him with his hair sticking up. He needs to make a good impression.
Tony's head is propped up by pillows, so he doesn't even have to try to turn to look at Steve. He's smiling. It's a smile no one but Steve ever sees, soft and wondrous and delighted. His eyes are dark, heavy, half-lidded. Oh, yeah, he's
After a few more seconds of labored breathing, Mr. Stark reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a bottle of water. He starts sipping it. Steve supposes he must be done with his aspirin.
Tony paused in between bites. "I couldn't have done this in the old days. Pizza wouldn't have fit in that old armor's mouth-slit. Good riddance." He glanced down at himself, resplendent in red and silver. He was getting used to the colors now.
But Tony's dropping so hard that he can't make that decision. He's not thinking clearly. And obviously when he's like this, he's not going to sacrifice Steve. He's not capable of it. And Steve doesn't know if he can change Tony's mind, but he has to try.
He'd waited, glumly, for Tony to say Strength, because of course he was going to say Strength, because that was all anyone ever saw in Steve now. The muscle. That was all he was good for.
Steve dropped a kiss just under Tony's jaw. "Let's see if I can get you feeling even better. Fewer clothes, you said?"
Steve was leaning against the doorframe, wearing camo pants, combat boots, and one of those incredibly stupid t-shirts of his own uniform. He was still goddamn gorgeous. He offered Tony a small smile.
"All right." Steve is grinning, heady with excitement, and he slides his hands over the familiar planes of Iron Man's armor, already letting himself start to dream about the man under them. "Anything else you want to do before then?"
Tony's laugh was a snort of damp breath against Steve's throat. "Steve, it's not that easy. We run in the same circles. We're invited to all the same events. I'll absolutely have to see him again. Repeatedly. Unless he gets life in prison." His voice was cracking. "And he's not going to prison. At all. You know he's not. Nothing's going to stick. He was right about that too."
Tony coughs flowers every couple of months. Only a few. A petal here and there. No one else notices.
in if I were a murderer. It'd be the right thing to do." Why was Tony trying to deny this? He knew who Steve was. He knew what Steve would do.
It was just like Tony, Steve thought, fondly, as he watched him slip through the crowd. It was just like Tony to see some new technology and immediately think of how it could be used to do good in the world. That was who Tony was. That was one of the many reasons Steve loved him.
He pulled his hand out, opened his fist, and saw gleaming red. Huh. He revised his materials guess: plated stainless steel, obviously. Well, red was an interesting color choice and certainly one of his personal favorites, but-- oh.
When Tony talked like that about him, it was hard not to be in love with him. But Steve knew he was really going to have to stop soon.
"Except," Tony interrupted, "there's another explanation. An even simpler one." He held his hands out; he gestured around himself, and Steve didn't understand. "Rich men make enemies. Trust me, Steve, I know this. You don't get to where Ty is -- or, for that matter, where I am -- without having incurred a certain amount of, let's just say, personal enmity. And, yeah, I'm my own bodyguard, and, yeah, I've also been lucky enough to have hired, for the most part, people who don't want me dead, who aren't secretly supervillains, and who are very, very hard to bribe." He grimaced. "I mean, there was that time Whitney Frost got herself hired as my secretary. And then I dated her. I try not to think about that one."
And if Steve's goal here is also to make Tony feel good -- well, they don't have to go about it the same way, do they? That's what Tony was saying. Steve gets it now.
"You're a kind man." Tony's smile was wavering. "You're clearly doing this to make me feel better, and I-- I appreciate it, but I know I'm not someone you really want. And I'd really rather not have anything at all when it's only pity. I know you're straight."
Tony was staring at him, incredulous, like Steve was going out of his way to offer him something extremely generous, when Steve was pretty sure that not doing something in bed that your partner had explicitly said they didn't want was the actual bare minimum. But they'd established that Tony hadn't gotten even the bare minimum, hadn't they?
He wants Stephen gone. This had nothing to do with him. Stephen may have been the gun, but Tony pulled the trigger. And Tony knows -- oh, how he knows -- how weapons work. He knows who Steve will go for.
Steve turned his head and gave him a brilliant, blissed-out smile. "Always been here. Just another secret identity. Fella like you should know all about that kind of thing, right?"
Walders just kept looking at him. She was unflappable. "That's as may be, Captain. But Tony Stark isn't an Avenger."
Tapping his earpiece off, Steve stepped up next to him and peered at the device Tony was extricating. "Is that--?"
After Hank had left, Jan looked up at Steve; there was a worried expression in her eyes. "You don't actually mind talking about the team, do you?"
That was okay. There was no shame in crying. Steve would be there for him. Tony would let him be there for him.
If Iron Man can't take the armor off, then anyone who sees him so much as shirtless in his civilian identity will instantly know his secret one. Steve supposes Iron Man must wear some awfully baggy clothing. But, knowing how concerned Iron Man is about his secret identity, Steve can imagine that Iron Man doesn't want to risk exposure -- even if, for the sake of Iron Man's health, Steve wishes he would.
"I am," Tony insists, and then he relents. "Okay, yeah, that spot's still not great, and the nerves there are still a little weird. But that's the worst spot. You can go at least that hard everywhere else and I'll like it. I promise."
Steve just kept his hands on Tony's back, tracing aimless designs over the cotton of his dress shirt. "And I know you know all this," he said, "but right now it sounds like it might help to hear it. You're tired, you've had a terrible day, you've had a terrible week, and I'm sure you've barely eaten and you've barely slept. And I'm not here to make you do anything you don't want to do, but I think you know you'd feel better if you could take care of some of those needs. And I'm happy to help."
Then Tony sighed once more. "You ever have it happen, where the bullies know things about you that you don't even know?"
Stone held out his hand. Steve shook it. Even with his gloves on, Steve could tell Stone's hands were soft. Smooth. He'd never done a day of hard work in his life.
There was another pause, and then, somehow, the strangest transformation happened. The scowl disappeared from Tony's face, and he looked... apologetic? What was going on?
Tony was nodding even more, animated. "Yeah, I know. I didn't think he was physically capable of sleeping past six in the morning, either." His gaze was fond, and he squeezed Steve's hand. He leaned forward, body language tuned to a conversation he wasn't even having in person. "I know we're already late, but honestly I just woke up. Haven't even had breakfast yet, so if it's not anything urgent--" He paused. Jan was clearly talking. "Yeah, yeah, that was exactly what I meant." He nodded again. "Really? That'd be great. Thanks. See you soon."
Steve's feelings about that don't matter right now. They can't. Tony's the one at the edge of the cliff right now.
Some horrible part of Steve wanted to laugh, even though nothing was funny, because this was the same damn problem Tony had always had, once again. It wasn't as if Tony had never dated people who'd tried to kill him, after all. It was just that all the other people had known it was Tony they were trying to kill. And of course Tiberius hadn't been trying to kill
Tony was still squinting, suspicious. "Radioactive Man killed five people, including himself. I know Ty's got money, but money doesn't usually buy suicide bombers. You know that."
The internet assured him that there were clubs where men could dance together now, wearing whatever they liked, and no one gave a damn. There were no blue ticket discharges, no police raids, no MPs guarding the doors. Not anymore. The internet in fact assured him that it was all legal, all of it, everything he could think of, right up to two men or two women being able to walk down the aisle together. Steve has filed that last fact away as
, but that's different." He shuts his eyes. He can't look at Tony and say this part. He's not that brave. "And I couldn't have said this before, obviously, but if-- if Iron Man hadn't existed, I would have said yes to you. Without hesitation. I-- I wanted you then. I still do."
"So what do you think?" Tony asked. A curious smile edged the corners of his mouth. "Alive or not?" He paused and lifted his head, baring his throat. His smile was a little broader. "You need to try the carotid instead? I trust you not to be a vampire."
The next thing in the box was a thick leather cuff, unbuckled, but with one of the D-rings still attached to a chain. Tony felt like some kind of perverted magician, pulling it out of the box until he got to the other cuff. Then, for the sake of completeness, he reached in, found the other two cuffs and their chain, and set them all on the bed next to the crop and the floggers. The leather was once again black, but something about the metal of the findings, as well as the long chains between the cuffs, was... odd. Usually chains like that were as shiny as hell, nickel-plated stainless steel, but these were more of a muted, dull color. Less reflective. Sort of like--
Does Tony think he can trust anything Ghost says? Hell, maybe he does. It's not like Tony's thinking straight.
He knew some people were into that, but he was pretty sure the answer for Tony was no. He'd tried to pet Tony's hair and Tony had flinched like-- like he'd thought Steve was going to try to hold him down, instead. That was what that had been. God. That was what Tony had been afraid of. And Steve could have, if he'd been that kind of man. He was definitely stronger than Tony. But he would never have done it. Not unless Tony had wanted it. It wasn't something you just assumed your partner liked. Didn't Tony know that?
true is that he hurt you. He broke the story that hurt you. Don't think about his explanation right now. Just think about that fact.
Steve still didn't think Tony had made the right call back then, but he'd known that neither of them could take what it had done to their friendship. Tony had apologized. They'd made up. They were better. And surely Steve's opinion was the one that counted. Steve was the one who'd been hurt. And he'd forgiven Tony. It was over. Except it wasn't, because now news sites in search of pageviews were dragging it all up again, as if they thought they understood it all. They didn't understand a damn thing. They didn't even know Tony was Iron Man. And they sure as hell didn't know what it had cost Tony to do any of what he'd done. They talked about him like he didn't have feelings, like none of this had hurt him, and it wasn't right.
, Tony. He figured it out when I walked in on you. I imagine the look on my face had something to do with it."
It's one of the many questions he knows Tony will say yes to. There are a few others he's holding in reserve. Sometimes he daydreams about getting down on one knee, because he's a traditionalist like that. And just because neither of them are quite ready for that yet doesn't mean that Steve isn't absolutely certain of Tony's answer.
"Well, yeah," Steve says, confused. "Of course I'm glad. If he hadn't told me, I would have tried to take his armor off, and, well--"
"And somehow we're past the point of no return," Iron Man rasps. "It's too late. It's too late for this to be easy. It's far, far too late for anything good to come of this. I should have told you before it got this far. And I'm so, so sorry. I never wanted to hurt you. But it's too late for that. And you need to know. You need to know the truth about me. And I know -- I know
Like him, like so many other superheroes, Carol was ex-military. And she'd spent an awful lot of her life handling classified information. That meant, Steve realized belatedly, that she wasn't going to get upset if there was something he wasn't telling her. He'd said he couldn't tell her. Therefore, she wasn't cleared for this. So she was just... accepting it.
Mr. Stark is alone in the kitchen, standing next to the coffeemaker, empty mug dangling from his left hand. He's once again in a trim, tailored three-piece suit, the sort of outfit that looks like it costs more than Steve makes in a year.
He'd left Tony a few messages, none of which Tony had returned. Then he pinged Tony's identicard again, hoping that Tony was somewhere getting medical treatment. Tony had been in the ViaStone building all evening and it didn't take a lot of imagination to figure out what he was up to now. Comfort. Consolation. He was sleeping with the man who'd tried to kill him.
Oh, God. "You can ignore what I was saying," Tony said. He was acutely conscious that he was still lying here on the ground, in a broken suit. Vulnerable. "I mean, you don't feel the same way about me and that's-- that's fine."
Some of the color is starting to come back to Tony's face, but he still looks like hell. He looks away from Steve, staring at nothing, and for a split second he looks so
Steve nodded like this made sense to him, and then he stepped back, hit something on the back of his glove, and let the hard-light shield materialize into being. It was a well-choreographed move; he didn't wait for the shield to finish forming up before he was already bringing it down onto the bonds that were anchoring Tony to the table. A half-second later and it would have passed through them, but Steve's timing was perfect. Wrist, wrist, ankle, ankle, and then Tony was free.
Iron Man sounds honestly curious, like he can't imagine how Steve arrived at this conclusion, when it seems so obvious to Steve.
Tony tipped his head up and leaned in; Steve obligingly ran a hand over the nape of Tony's neck, pulling him in a little closer, and then he kissed him. Tony tasted... well, an awful lot like Steve, actually, which made sense given where his mouth had just been. Steve wondered if he should find that thought as arousing as he did. He was getting hard again.
He can't believe he ever doubted Tony. He pushes all the shame back. That'll do him no good. He needs to focus.
"I mean," Steve says, haltingly. "I was there-- they said the cancer came back-- but nobody told me how bad it was before they put me in here, and I haven't seen anyone since then, and I just-- I just--"
good enough for me. I would have liked it if you'd actually been happy for us. I'm sorry you can't see him the way I see him."
"I love you," Steve whispers against Iron Man's mouth, and he knows Iron Man can't say it back, not like this, but he feels Iron Man smile. He can feel the traces of tears on Iron Man's cheek, trickling into his mustache, and he raises his head and kisses them away.
But it wasn't like Steve really knew what drove men to kill themselves, did he? And he didn't know the business details, not like Tony and Donahue probably did. Maybe Stone Incorporated had been wounded so grievously by Stark Industries that there'd been no way for the company to recover even after Howard Stark's death. That could have been the case.
Steve smiled. "Well," he allowed, "I'll just get my boots off first. Pretty sure there's no way to make that at all sexy."
"Yes," Tony says, wrong-footed. He feels like the boot jets have cut out and he's falling through the sky. "Yes, but it's not-- you're not-- I really do have to go call the doctor. Excuse me."
After that, Tony was silent for a long while, still smiling, eyes still bright even with his obvious exhaustion. Tony wiped off his stomach with his shirt. Steve's shirt. Well, it was Steve's mess; he'd earned that.
"You don't need to thank me," Steve said. "I already told you. I'm your friend." He tried not to think about the book again, and failed. "I'm happy to help."
"It's all right," Steve says. "That doesn't matter." He holds out his hands. "Just be with me. That's all I want."
Lifting his head, Tony turned toward him. The skylight above him cast strange shadows across the planes of his face. His gaze was haunted. "Yep." He sounded like he'd intended to be funny, but hadn't quite made it there. "You know how they say you're the common denominator in your failed relationships? I figured that one out a while ago. You'd think knowing that would have helped, but somehow I keep making the exact same mistakes." Air shuddered out of his lips, a sound that might have been a laugh. "As far as I can tell, I'm just a stupendously easy mark. And yet I'm still surprised every damn time."
Iron Man cuts him off, but then for several long seconds he says nothing, and Steve can hear his trembling, shuddering breaths. Steve feels like he's standing on the edge of a cliff, looking down at the rocks below.
"For reporting the news?" Tiberius snorted. "I believe I heard you talking about first-amendment rights earlier, Captain. Or are you telling me that Captain America doesn't support freedom of the press?"
"Oh," Ghost says, surprised. "You're new here." He sits back in his chair. His head tilts up; on Tony, Steve would call that gesture
Tony didn't single any of them out, but he held Steve's gaze for just a little longer when he smiled, and Steve smiled back.
"We are definitely X-Raying you first thing when we get home," Tony said. "No one wants to break and re-set anything."
It was easier to breathe now, with Tony smiling at him, with Tony touching him. "So he goes to public school, and then he goes to Cambridge. And when he's at Cambridge, he and one of his classmates, Clive, they... fall in love with each other. He realizes he's gay. He's happy."
There's a horrible scratching noise over the comms, a noise that stutters between mechanical static and harsh, human breaths, and Steve realizes the vocal filters in the armor are failing. And then Iron Man flips end-over-end, through the air, one hand splayed across his neck, repulsors flickering, and that's when Steve figures out that a whole lot of the armor's systems are failing.
Steve's heart was beating double-time. It wasn't unexpected that abuse would escalate, he told himself, trying to remain distant and professional, because he needed to keep it together and find Tony and get him out of here. This was a mission. He needed to think of it as a mission.
There's rustling behind him, and when Steve is finally down to his underwear and his undershirt, he turns around to see that Tony, still shivering, has made his way under the covers, which are pulled up practically to his neck. Tony regards him in silence, wide-eyed; his mouth is a taut, thin line.
Steve hasn't actually touched Tony's neck or shoulders. From the side, he doesn't have a great angle for it, and Tony's neck can't take as much as his back can, so he needs to be careful, and the far side of him will be hard to reach. Usually he's done people's neck and shoulders for them while they were sitting up, but Tony seems to have melted into the bed. Steve sure doesn't want to ask Tony to move right now.
At this angle, Steve is looming over him, still fully dressed, still armored. Tony's never felt more naked than he does right now. Tony knows, rationally, that Steve is barely taller than he is, but somehow he's
"Oh, probably," Tony says, airily. He lifts his head. His eyes are bright. "It's just that your birthday is so damn convenient for him, isn't it?"
be confirmed, because I'm the person who needs to confirm it, and there's nothing independent to confirm it with. It's a real Catch-22."
Guiltily, Steve spends the next few days thinking about just how much his life is like a fairytale. He furtively glances at all the men he passes on the street, wondering if any of them are Iron Man, if he would know him if he saw him. He can't very well walk up to anyone with one of Iron Man's boots, after all.
This was working. Tony was sounding a little better. Unfortunately, Steve could tell from the tension in his stance that he still wasn't all that far from falling apart. He was fidgeting with the shield strap with one hand and his other hand was picking nervously at his jacket. His shoulders were a little slumped, his head tilted a bit too far down. Most people probably would have had to see Tony's face to read him, but Steve had spent a decade needing to be able to tell what Tony was thinking while he was standing six foot six in full body armor. With only a helmet, this was actually the easy version.
Well. It looked like Tony was the brand-new illicit owner of a big box of what was probably kinky sex toys. Possession, as they said, was nine-tenths of the law. Or maybe
"Mmm," Tony breathed. "I'd be very happy to see anything you wanted to show me." From someone else, the words might have been a coarse suggestion; from Tony, they were achingly sincere.
"Stickers!" Iron Man crows, jubilantly, and sure enough, Steve sees a little glittery Avengers A on the paper. Next to it, farther down the strip, there's a little cartoon figure of Iron Man, also glittery, and then Steve's shield. He proffers the paper. It's perforated into sections. "Here, you'll have to take one yourself." He wiggles the fingers of his free hand. "My armor is too strong to peel off stickers, you see. I wouldn't want to rip them by accident."
Hank must not have actually minded shop talk as much as he was pretending to, because within ten minutes, he'd come back with drinks for all of them, and then he'd started enthusiastically adding his own suggestions to the discussion, which had moved from meeting agendas to roster ideas to next week's training plans. And Jan herself had some great ideas. Steve was really enjoying co-leading the team with Jan, all in all; they ought to have thought of it before.
They weren't exactly dissimilar, physically, Steve and Tiberius, and Tony sure wouldn't have been the first person in the world to have a preference for buff blond men. On the one hand, it was oddly comforting to know that, if Tony had a type, he was part of it; he was somebody Tony was attracted to. Tony liked the way he looked. On the other hand, given the company, he wasn't exactly sure this was a type he wanted to be part of.
Behind the mask, Tony's face was hot. "Of course," he said, possibly a little too weakly. "I'll let him know. No problem."
And Steve doesn't even know what Iron Man's talking about. Steve ate a lot of Spam during the war. He wasn't a big fan of it. Iron Man can't be talking about the same thing. This makes no sense.
And then Steve stops short and starts laughing with him, because he's right back where he started: he
The first couple times, he'd taken care of himself before Steve had come over at all, but they'd quickly figured out that this way was much more fun.
Tony tucks his head under Steve's chin. He's silent for long minutes. Steve can hear his heart beating. Tony's stopped shivering, he realizes. He's warmer. Good.
Right now, Tony was alive, and Tony was going to be safe, and Tony still wanted to be his friend, and that was enough. It had to be enough, because it was all he was ever going to get.
Experimentally, Steve waved a hand in Tony's field of vision. Tony didn't even so much as blink. No good.
Tony hadn't been wrong when he'd said he was inexperienced. He knew enough to keep his teeth out of it, but he was definitely more than a little clumsy. But somehow that made it hotter. He didn't want the perfect, pornographic blowjob. He wanted
And Tony still wanted to be his friend. Steve hadn't ruined everything. Steve hadn't ruined anything at all.
Tony stops breathing for a good five seconds. The smallest spark of hope kindles in his eyes. "Steve?"
"You're wonderful," Tony says, in the same soft tone. "I mean that." He smiles, a tiny little ember of happiness. "I love you too."
Steve laughed -- or tried to -- and felt his body recoil in protest, as his ribs hurt. "Ow. That's not how you like to wake up, and I know that for a fact."
The box was metal, probably aluminum or steel, painted in that most favorite of kinky colors: black. It was maybe two and a half feet long -- just long enough for the crop -- and about a foot deep. Whatever blow had staved it in enough to split one corner had also broken the lock, and that meant Tony could lift the lid, which gave way with a screech of metal and the scraping of scratched paint. It didn't quite lift up all the way anymore -- the hinges were definitely busted -- but there was enough room for Tony to fish out the contents, one item at a time.
"Okay." Steve lowered his hands. "Okay. And from a practical standpoint, you should probably also know that, logistically, it'd be very difficult for you to get a drink."
Come to think of it, that was true of pretty much all of the fliers, even the ones who weren't as tough as Carol: most of them were more dangerous the farther away they were. He wouldn't have liked to have been on the other end of one of Tony's repulsor rays, but in hand-to-hand, with both of them armored and armed, that was a different story. Steve was almost positive that whatever Tony was building his suit out of now was still no match for vibranium and--
A terrible possibility occurred to Steve. "I don't," he began hesitantly, "I don't remind you of him, do I?"
Steve gestured down at himself, at his uniform; there was a flicker of a smug smile on his face. "I think he sees me in leather a lot, actually."
Tony smiled. "It's the twenty-first century, Ty. Grow up. If you out me, so what? I'll be fine. One fewer secret." It was a dare. He was daring him. "Go ahead. Do it. Or maybe I'll do it before you have the chance to."
He would have liked to have said that he'd have wanted anyone to do the same for him, but that wasn't exactly true. Part of being Tony Stark meant that most people were just going to assume he was kinky, whether or not he was, but in the dilettante pop-culture way that meant that maybe he tied his girlfriends up with silk scarves every so often, when he wanted to try something new. That was the impression he liked to give. That wasn't him, namely because (a) he was kinky in a rather more serious way, (b) when he did things he wanted to do them properly, and (c) silk scarves were a terrible fucking bondage material. So, sure, he was into kink, and he was willing to take the heat for whoever it was on the team who didn't want to be so open about their preferences. That was just what you did for your fellow kinksters, right?
"Yeah," Tony tells him. "Yeah, go, go, go, fuck me, give it to me hard. I know you want to." He pauses, takes a breath, realizes he has one last thing to clarify. "On my back, though."
"Um," Tony says, and he winces again. "I don't mean to lead you on, but I also wasn't kidding when I said I couldn't get it up." He grimaces. His face is still faintly flushed. "Unfortunately."
Sadly, the scene hadn't been perfect. Steve hadn't gotten to watch Tiberius walk out of there in handcuffs, and it hadn't been just because Tiberius couldn't walk yet. Tony hadn't wanted to press charges for assault; he hadn't been sure if
"It's okay," Steve says, keeping his tone gentle. "You're safe, okay? You don't even need to try to stand right now. You can let go. I'm here. I've got you."
"I know so," Tony said. He was still smiling, smiling wide, his lips flushed red and shining. God, he was beautiful. He was beautiful and he was happy and he was going to let Steve try to make him even happier. It was more than Steve could ever have dreamed.
"I promised him -- you remember, in the Necropolis? -- I promised him I would make this right," Tony says, quietly. "I have to make this right."
When he'd selected this book, Steve had forgotten exactly how many of the lines in it had cut him to the bone. He almost couldn't breathe with the swell of longing in him. He felt naked, exposed; here was his own heart laid bare upon the page. The book had known just what it was like; the man who'd written it had been where he was. This was how he felt.
The shield sails over Ghost's head, cracks the drywall on the adjacent interior wall, before picking up speed as it smashes into the ceiling, then one of the concrete support pillars.
"It's okay," Steve said, preoccupied with trying to figure out when Tony and Tiberius had been together before. Everything Tony was saying sounded... well, awfully
He hates to rush Tony. Especially about this. There's not really a choice, though. "I can feel the serum fighting it," he admits. "Half an hour, tops, is my guess. It's, uh. It's now or never, I think."
"I'm glad," Steve murmured. "Me too." He could feel himself slipping closer to sleep. "Hey, am I allowed to sleep like this? With a concussion?"
"Thank you," Steve breathes, softly. He leans in and kisses Tony's cheek, tenderly. His eyes lower, and there's even more color in his face. "I-- I really needed that."
are people framing the question as a hypothetical, talking about books or movies where it happens, asking each other if they would ever do it. That's all well and good for them, Steve supposes, but it doesn't answer the more pressing question of what Steve should do if he has a Saturday night free and a fella in a metal suit he'd like to get to know better. It's nowhere near hypothetical for him.
"It was all lies," Tony whispered. Steve could feel hot tears sliding down his bare arm. "It was only ever lies. I thought that even if he hated me now, he must have loved me once, but he never did. Every last word was a lie, and I-- I can't believe I-- oh, God."
He was an Avenger, sure, but -- other than Tony and Jan -- most of the Avengers weren't born to this lifestyle, and he could tell that, under all the stage makeup, Tony was tired. Tony probably wanted to get home, wipe his face off, and... well, okay, Tony probably wanted to spend six more hours in the basement working on his armor but Steve was hoping he could at least talk him into some cuddling first.
"They said it's not unusual that the tumor would recur after three years." Tony's looking into the distance. He sounds like he's reciting a mission report. "The good news is, they do think they can operate. They think they can probably get it all. I hope they can get it all. Otherwise, well." He grimaces. "You know."
"If you really loved him," Steve breathed, pitching the words so only Tiberius could hear him, "you'd never, ever do this to him. You're guilty as sin. And we both know it."
He took another breath and tried to push the fury away. Then, when he was sure his voice was under control, he lifted his head and spoke. "It's not a crime to have friends. And the position of Avengers chairperson is an elected one. The team takes a vote. If my fellow Avengers didn't have confidence in my judgment, they wouldn't have asked me to lead them time and time again."
Jan's stare only grew more incredulous. Thankfully, neither Steve nor Thor seemed to be paying attention. It was fine if Jan didn't believe him, if she thought the toys were his. That was the point. It was a plausible misdirection, another mask. Why shouldn't Tony Stark, the famed Casanova of the superhero world, have all the sex toys he wanted? He was just covering for the true owner, that was all. He was saving them some embarrassment. Nobody was going to want Thor to stand here in public and show off their vibrator collection for the rest of the team.
Tiberius' lips rounded. "Oh," he murmured, in a tone of dawning realization, though Steve had no idea what it was that he'd realized. "Oh, now that's
He briefly regrets that he's the only one on the team who can't fly. Everyone else is in the air, nimbly avoiding the attacks of Baron Zemo and his new Masters of Evil -- who, so far, still seem to be just the Enchantress and the Executioner. They're Asgardians, Steve has gathered, but from the battle cries that Thor has been shouting, they're certainly no friends of his.
"Thanks, Carol." Steve's voice cracked. To his horror, he heard himself sniffle wetly. "But I think-- I'm pretty sure this one's permanent. It was bad. It was really bad. Worse than all the other times we've fought."
Tony looked him up and down in a way that somehow made him feel even more naked. It was wonderful. Tony's smile was sharp. "They're all incredibly impure," Tony drawled, a little too casually, like he was testing whether this was okay by saying it.
Steve can't tell Mr. Stark he would have said yes to him if he'd never met Iron Man. That won't help anything.
Music starts with an orchestral flourish, and the screen displays an epigram, huge white words in a black void: THE MEDIATOR BETWEEN BRAIN AND HANDS MUST BE THE HEART!
, either. The noises Tony makes when he's having a good time, Steve supposes, are similar in every context. And it's really doing a lot for Steve, honestly. Steve's whole body practically hums back in response, like an echo, a matched frequency, warmth spreading through him.
Tony trusts him enough to let him do this, Steve reminds himself, as a memory of the fight with Ghost floats to the surface of Steve's mind, and he shoves it back. Tony's not thinking anything bad. Steve shouldn't be either.
"Sounds nice," Steve said, politely, trying not to let the ache of rejection show on his face. "Say, what's he like, your friend?"
It was going to be okay, Steve told himself. It was a setup. No one was going to be seriously hurt. Tiberius Stone was an asshole and an abuser and Steve had no idea what he was getting out of tormenting Tony, but his tastes in abuse didn't run to physical injury, surely. Steve would have-- he would have noticed. He would have seen something. Wouldn't he?
The good news was that the police had both managed to clear the building of civilians and set up a perimeter by the time the Avengers showed up on the scene.
Shoving a few of the seats back, Steve clears a space on the floor. He's got one of the blankets spread out beneath him, insulation from the metal decking, and he's down to his undershirt -- the mail on his uniform is going to be a hindrance -- before Tony takes notice of what he's doing.
Steve screamed now, with all of his voice, and he hadn't been kidding when he said he made a lot of noise. But it was the good kind of scream: Steve's whole body arched into the blow, he trembled with the pain, and God, he was still hard. He was gripping the sheets, clearly determined to stay upright, and Tony decided that kind of stubbornness deserved a reward, so he drew back and hit Steve with every ounce of strength in him, right across the lines of the previous blows.
"Do I really have to spell it out?" Tony's mouth twists. "Fine. I guess I do. I asked you out. You turned me down, in favor of... a person you thought wasn't me. And now the person you thought you were in love with is, in reality, someone you've already rejected. I already know what you think of me. And I know you've been upset with me. I'm not blind. I know when I'm not wanted. Why do you think you've barely seen me around, out of the armor?" He's biting his lip again. "But I knew I had to confess when I found out about your... intentions. I wasn't about to let you make that mistake. I'm not
Tony groans with pleasure, a low, drawn-out sound from deep in his chest, lower than speech, all instinct. It's not exactly sexual, but it's not exactly
potential. She didn't have super-strength, but she could be dating someone who did, or keeping the chains around in case the situation arose. He didn't know Monica that well, and so all she would know of him was by reputation. That seemed to him like a decent situation for a long-distance crush; it wasn't like Tony was unaware that a lot of people liked his public persona. He was good at being charming. It was possible.
Tony stretches and smiles again, a wordless answer, and Steve obligingly works his fingers a little higher up Tony's calf, still holding his leg. This position isn't going to work for Steve to massage Tony's back, though; the bed is too low for Steve to reach him properly while standing up. He'll figure something out.
"Back in the day, Stone Incorporated -- Ty's father's company -- was a major competitor to Stark Industries. Donahue was a smaller competitor, but Donahue and Ty's father were close friends. And you've probably figured this out, but my father liked to win. And my father was good at business. So he set about driving Ty's father out of business. Stone Incorporated declared bankruptcy at one point. They were just barely hanging on."
would have involved getting the shield, and that was upstairs. But she was stronger than him, faster than him, tougher than him. Superhuman to his peak-human. If he'd actually wanted to hurt her, he could maybe have managed it eventually. Maybe not.
They're almost to Stark Tower, and Steve's positive that Tony will be even worse by the time they get there.
"Believe me, I wish I were wrong." The words scraped Steve's throat. "I wanted so badly to be wrong. But I know I'm not. I wouldn't lie to you, Tony. I wouldn't. I've never lied to you, not in my life. You
and, oh, yeah, he had him now. He raised his eyebrows. "I think I might know where you can find a guy like that. A guy who is intimately aware of your physical capabilities, but can take direction as needed. And he'd, uh. He'd like to see you in leather, if you're up for that."
He stroked Tony's cock, fast and tight, and then got his mouth back on him. Tony was breathing heavily now, and his fingers closed hard on strands of Steve's hair, and somehow it all felt amazing. He was doing this right, he thought, delighted; he was making it good for Tony after all.
, and then there was Tony. Steve knew -- had always known, really -- that he couldn't keep up. Of course Tony was going to want friends who were on his level. It made sense. He couldn't offer Tony that.
"Lower," he groaned. He could still talk, but he was out of more specific words, and he hoped that Tony would understand.
This was probably too intense for a first scene. Neither of them had ever been normal, though, and Tony certainly wasn't planning to start now.
"--Cap?" Jan asked, and Steve belatedly realized she'd been talking. He had absolutely no idea what she'd been saying.
Also, come to think of it, Fury wasn't even in charge of the Ultimates. Not anymore. He really couldn't make Tony do anything.
Of course, Steve was more than limber enough to reach down and unclip his ankles at any time, but this wasn't about that.
He'd probably have dropped anyway, the way the scene had ended, but he's definitely dropping now. Steve knows Tony. And he knows it got worse when Tony finished suiting up. When he flipped the faceplate down. When Steve had to stop touching him.
Tony had said he'd learned to stand up and fight. Captain America had taught him that, he'd said. He probably-- God, he probably thought Steve expected him to have fought back. Steve had learned to take on the bullies, all right. But there were some fights he'd never picked. A flood of memories cascaded through Steve's head. His stomach lurched.
Steve looked at him with an amount of earnestness that was threatening to break Tony's heart. "I trust you."
He takes another careful, measured breath. "I would. I absolutely would, and frankly I don't understand why you're trying to dissuade me."
He can feel his face heat up. He doesn't think he's ever asked Steve for anything like this before, though it isn't like he hasn't wanted to; Steve can't possibly have missed how much Tony likes the look of him in uniform. He just felt too ashamed to ever ask for it, like it would have been objectifying Steve, like Steve would have thought he only liked him for the way he filled out his outfit.
Box tucked under his arm, he headed across the room, unplugged his phone, and then nearly dropped it when he saw what it said.
Tony's answering smile was nervous, but then he plucked at the side of Steve's shirt, his fingers fluttering. It took Steve a few seconds to figure out that this was, in fact, the question.
"You can open your eyes now," Iron Man says. The filtering is back on, but even with his voice masked, Steve can tell how overwhelmed he sounds.
"Right." Steve smiled. He was trying to put Tony at ease. God, he hoped it was working. "Tea it is. Is chamomile okay?" Chamomile was supposed to be calming, wasn't it? Tony could use that.
"We'll be absolutely fine," Tony reassured her. He wasn't thrilled about magic, of course, but Mordo was only one man. It was hard to imagine much of anything going wrong. "But I think the more important question, for our purposes, is
He should let Steve know exactly how much he was into the thought of this. A disclosure in kind. Steve wasn't going to use it against him, he reminded himself. Steve wasn't going to think he was a freak. God knew he'd been with people who couldn't handle this side of him, people who couldn't deal with the fact that he wanted to hurt people he loved, recreationally. But Steve was asking to know, he told himself. Steve
had told him, and it galled Steve that a man who'd spent years plotting Tony's downfall had been better at comforting him than Steve had been.
Also if Steve wanted to destroy an entire planet right now, Tony wouldn't be able to stop him. The current power play has a slightly higher power rating than usual.
Steve returned the handshake. "Happy to be here," he said, as he sat down. It wasn't exactly the truth. "Defending both Mr. Stark and Iron Man from these baseless accusations is a commitment that I consider very close to my heart." That was... a hell of a lot truer. "As one of the two current Avengers chairs, one of my primary responsibilities is to set the record straight, as it were, about any allegations of team misconduct. But, additionally, I'm proud to call both of these men my friends. They're two of the best men I've ever known, and I trust and respect both of them, personally and professionally. And I'm here today because they're both innocent."
"You know," Jan said, thoughtfully, from the library's doorway, "based on previous experience, I was pretty sure Tony was going to be the sappiest one in your relationship, but I think I'm wrong. You two are adorable, by the way."
"Anything," Tony says, instantly, breathlessly, practically tripping over the the words in his haste. "Anything you want, I swear. Just don't hurt him."
"Not really," Steve admitted. "In my experience both they and I were pretty clear about why they were hitting me. Mostly it was that I was scrawny enough that I couldn't hurt them back."
It's nice that Tony can make jokes that presume he's attractive, but that's not really all Steve wants.
All thoughts of romantic proposals slide out of Steve's mind as he leaps out of his seat, runs to the door, unlocks the deadbolt, and clumsily wrenches it open hard enough to rattle the hinges.
And then Thor stood up, the way he always did, clearing his throat like he was preparing to give a soliloquy. There was a box at his feet, heavy but battered, still closed, but one corner had cracked just enough to let something slip out.
He was usually so much smoother than this. Hell, he had a reputation. But Steve clearly didn't want the reputation, or else he'd probably have asked Tony Stark.
Jan gave him a sidelong glance of disbelief, and, yeah, she absolutely knew what else was likely to be in that box, all right.
That was why Tony had had the IV, Steve realized. The drugs had been meant to keep him in DreamVision. Tiberius had never intended to let him wake up.
Tony's hand stilled, which was what Steve had asked for, but Steve hissed through his teeth anyway. He was tingling all over, limbs gone tight, body coiled in readiness for a release denied.
Steve's mouth was half-open. Tony always enjoyed being able to surprise him. It happened so rarely. "I-- you-- how did you--"
But right now, Tony didn't even seem to notice him at all. He was focused on Tiberius. He hadn't even glanced at Steve.
He ought to step back. He ought not to be this close to Tony -- physically or emotionally. But Tony needed him. And this was what Tony needed right now, so Steve and his unrequited love would just have to deal with it.
He takes a breath. He composes himself, stills his expression. He hopes he looks-- gentle. Kind. Whatever Tony needs him to be. He can be that.
Steve lets his gaze rise higher. Tony is staring back at him, eyes wide and dark, lips parted. Vulnerable. The wrong word could break him.
And now it was two in the morning, and he and Tony were standing outside ViaStone HQ. Steve was a little amazed that both his bike and Tony's car were still there, intact. Streetlights spilled over the sidewalk, glinted dully off gratings, shadowed Tony's face when Steve looked up at him. Tony was holding himself together by what looked like sheer force of will, but the cracks in his composure were starting to show, quivering around his eyes, making his mouth tremble. Steve knew Tony was only keeping it together because he was in public, and he was probably going to lose it entirely as soon as he got somewhere private. Tiberius had been right about that much.
Tony's standing next to him, still and silent. Steve wishes he could crack Tony's helmet and touch him one more time -- but there are definitely cameras in here, and they're definitely being monitored right now, and Iron Man's secret identity is one of the things that Tony's employees definitely don't know about him.
That was brazen, all right. Steve almost had to admire him for trying. He was good at this. He was very good at this. But he wasn't good enough anymore.
"Mmm," Steve said. It was, indeed, really good. Tony had the luxury of never needing to do his own cooking, but at some point he'd put in the effort to learn anyway. And, sure, fried eggs weren't fancy, but Tony also swore he made an amazing trout amandine, and Steve wholeheartedly believed him. "That's delicious. Thank you."
"My toys are all in California," Tony said, apologetically. "So if you don't mind me using yours..."
"I think I need to talk about it," Tony said, slowly, like he was trying to work it out as he was speaking. "I know it's selfish of me to want to share my pain but I think it'll hurt less." His smile was pained. "Because it really fucking hurts now."
The interview aired at seven o'clock. He didn't bother to watch it. He already knew what it was going to be, after all He folded up pants, shirts, every spare uniform. Toothbrush. He was definitely going to need to bring that. He'd filled two suitcases already.
. Sure, he hadn't believed him first -- Steve was a little sore about that, but only a little -- but Tony finally, finally believed him. He believed him, and he was cutting Tiberius out of his life for good, and he was going to be all right. He was going to be safe.
"It's nice," Tony said, after several seconds, his voice a little huskier than it had been. He wasn't looking up. Steve wondered if he was similarly affected. He couldn't ask that.
He wouldn't know anything important, he reminds himself. It's not like Iron Man can be someone he knows, under the armor; Steve hasn't met any of Mr. Stark's employees, other than Mr. Hogan, and Mr. Hogan was the one who drove the two of them to the theater, so he can't possibly be Iron Man.
"Right," Tony said. "This is the part where you should put back in the box anything you don't want me using on you tonight. No judgment. I just want to know what I get to pick from." And then he had another thought. "Also a couple of activities are off the table for tonight, because I have neither lube nor condoms. Wasn't planning on bringing anyone home. Haven't, since before I stopped--" Before he stopped drinking. He laughed and felt the harshness of the sound bite into him. "Not what you'd expect from the famous playboy Tony Stark, right?"
Steve'a breath hitches, caught in his chest. "All for you." His voice is low, rough, hoarse with desire. He needs this. God, he needs this. "Always for you."
Mouth trembling, Tony stares up at him. Steve puts the scissors to one side and reaches out with his other hand, drawing Tony close.
Tiberius chuckled. "No one is more sorry than I am, Captain." It was impressive how the lie slid so easily from his mouth. "But surely you, a military man, must understand that if you are attacking my station's programming decisions directly, it's only fair that I have the opportunity to defend them."
Steve's hands must have slipped in all the blood, because he shifted position, bringing a fresh wave of terrible sensation. Everything hurt. Everything hurt so damn much. He was so very, very tired.
He still has one hand in Tony's hair; with his other hand he unfastens his belt, undoes his pants, and pulls his cock out, giving himself an encouraging stroke. He doesn't need a lot of encouragement. He's already aching for it. He hears himself groan again.
So Tony hit him again, still lightly, on the other cheek this time; Steve whined with impatience and clenched down even harder.
Steve sags forward, gulping air. Out of the corner of his eye, he can see Ghost moving, holding something metallic in his hand, and he tries to twist around, to roll out of the way.
He wouldn't have said it if he didn't think he could do it, Steve reminds himself. And Steve trusts Tony's judgment. Even here, even now, even when he's like this. Tony knows his own limits well enough to be able to say no when he doesn't want something, or Steve wouldn't have done any of what he's done with Tony tonight. And, sure, this isn't sex anymore, but Tony's saying yes to it. That has to mean something.
were worth fighting for. That you were worth standing up for. Because that's how you should feel. That's how you should always feel. I know you were... ashamed... of what you did with Tiberius. What he did to you. You told yourself he'd been the only man. Maybe you even told yourself he was going to be the only man. But he wasn't the only one. Because you'd loved me first. I know I didn't know you then. But the way you felt then, the way loving Captain America made you feel -- that's how I want you to feel. It counts. It was real. It was real like this is real." He cupped the side of Tony's face. "You always had me. Even when I'd never met you. The only difference is that now I love you back. And that's a big difference, sure, but you'd already laid the foundation. Because you're amazing."
Stephen's gaze is unreadable. "You don't remember this, but historically, you haven't always been able to."
Ghost hauls him upright like the proverbial sack of flour, and there's something cool and solid pressed against Steve's temple.
Steve's hand is in his pocket and he's pulling out... oh. His phone. The date and time are on the lockscreen, of course, but the background--
There's no more putting it off when he reaches the mansion. Captain America will want to see the Avengers' benefactor in the flesh, after all. Tony bites his lip, straightens his tie in the mirror, and takes three different antitussives, one of which is a high-dose synthetic opioid, and none of which he suspects are meant to be taken together.
Tony couldn't imagine why Steve would want to. He was still too thin, too scarred -- Steve would look at him, and he'd see Tony had spent months living on the streets. No one needed that.
Steve wondered what the hell he'd done wrong. He'd been so sure Tony had wanted him. And Tony has definitely seemed like he'd liked the kiss. But this couldn't be good.
," he read, and he pronounced the name wrong, which was a sign both that he was actually reading it and that he'd probably never heard of it. "E. M. Forster." He looked pensive. "Never heard of it. Heard of Forster, though. We had to read
Something in Tony unfroze then, like all the joints in his armor had come unlocked at once, and before he could tell himself not to do it he took three swift steps forward, into Steve's personal space.
"Well, you're not a prisoner," Tony says, hoping he sounds like he means it. "But I'd recommend staying in the building until the doctor gets here, at least. There's a kitchen one floor down if you're hungry. Fully-stocked. Eat anything you want. It's on me."
