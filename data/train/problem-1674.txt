Sherlock woke up in a place full of darkness. He couldn't see a single thing. For the first time in his life... Sherlock... the consulting detective... the man who could remarkably think... felt completely blank. He didn't know where he was.. for how many days he has been unconscious.. how much drugs were injected in his body.. how many weapons were used upon him... he didn't know where to go now, or what to do... he was absolutely blank.
Mycroft says, “Are we only living to follow their orders??!!...” Mrs. H. says, “no time to talk girls.. start working, our boys are getting married. I am in charge of the food, Lestrade you are in charge of the place and the decoration, Mycroft you are in charge of managing everything and taking care of any problem that comes and most Important Molly you are in charge of Sherlock… Take care of everything he needs, this must be the best thing that could ever happen in his life… Lestrade you are John’s best man, Mycroft you are Sherlock’s… and Molly you are gonna give Sherlock away to John. I am gonna take care of Rosie and other guests. Take fast decisions. Work fast and make it happen guys…” ----

He is in immense pain, bleeding from everywhere, can't even open his eyes, but by gathering all the inner powers left in him John cried out  “why Sherlock why” .... “why are you doing this to me...”  “Why are you doing this to us...”.. Instead of answering Sherlock hits John with the riding crop in his hand on the face, so hard that his face started to bleed through a cut from his cheekbones till his lips.  John cried out again “Why are you hurting me Sherlock....” suddenly Sherlock shout out  “Because that's what I do” ... “because I want to BURN the heart out of you ...... And I will burn you ... Completely”  his face contorts into a devious grin... His evil grin enriched his ears... But his eyes were not smiling... those looked so intensely horrifying and evil and burning.... that terrified John to the core of his heart. He couldn't even look at Sherlock's eyes. He was so scared and confused, couldn't think of any reason that could have possibly turned his best friend to this monster,.. he couldn't think of any reason that could possibly turn the Best man into the worst, that he was seeing, and was still working on believing. He was still trying to find his best friend inside the evil standing in front of him, laughing wickedly, but no ... He failed... There was no sign of the man that he had always admired... No sign of the man that was always with him... No sign of the man that he met 10 years ago. That changed his life... There was no sign of his best friend... No sign of his Sherlock... This was a new man, such a monster that he never thought would exist. He felt like he lost everything. Like there was not even a single ray of hope....
This is the last chapter of my first fanfiction ... hope you all will enjoy it... hope I will be able to present you my 2nd fanfiction very soon... waiting for your kudos and comments ... Love you all... stay Sherlocked...
We reach home, we got down from the cab, Sherlock put his hand inside through the front window to pay the cabby. Instead of taking his money, The cabby kissed his hand and said, “Goodbye Mr. Holmes.” And left.
Sherlock started looking on the body with his looking glass, He saw a little white stain on the lips of the victim, took smell he murmured "pudding", he looked at the hair of the victim, saw that his hair was ruffled, and there was a sign of struggling on the bed. In his mind-palace Sherlock saw the man, eating the pudding in his supper,  and then going to sleep but after 5 minutes he was out of breath, gasping, he was hustling on the bed, Trying to breadth, trying to survive but couldn't even get up, and died on there.
Sherlock couldn't hold his tears anymore, he starts crying ... John says... " Now shut up you drama queen and get us out of here" ...
Suddenly it hits Sherlock Moriarty said the code... The Code is..."I WIN”  ... “I" becomes 1 ... The “W" rotates anticlockwise and it becomes 3... The next “I” becomes 1 again... And the “N” rotates clockwise and it becomes 2 ... The “I WIN” becomes  1312  in Sherlock's mind palace... He shouts out... “that's it John that's the password... it’s 1312... “   He presses those 4 digits with his shaking hands... And the timer stops on 57 seconds...
Sherlock: Yes John I am here now...
They left everything, they forgot to change their clothes, to ware their coats, everything, they lost their minds, they just came out in their sleeping robes. Outside of their house, there were lots of reporters gathered in, just to have one shot of their devastated detective. John was right all along, the moment any little disbalance happens, everyone would turn their back at him. They just pushed all of them aside, get themselves out of the chaos, there was a cab waiting for them, they got inside, and left for Tenby in Wales. At the shore, there was a ship waiting for them, they get on it, and reached the Island, Sharinford.
Sherlock says, “what are you saying John I can never do that, you are my best friend, and you want Rossy to be fatherless, Rossy can't live without you, I can't shoot you, never.”
Sherlock screams while crying, he says, “Please John please stop this, you really are burning my heart, please stop saying these I can't shoot you. You are everything I have, you are all I have ever wanted, I love you, John, I could never let anything happen to you, I love you...”
But that was for a few seconds. Sherlock told himself..... " This is not the time to be thoughtless.. this is not the time to be Emotional. This is the time where I have to organize my thoughts and think of a way out... Think you Dumbass THINK...". He starts to observe. Though he couldn't see anything still he could feel that he was in a small room. The temperature was around 28°F. He could feel small sand particles and salty water particles in the air around him. He could hear the sound of waves. He could smell sea-foods, He realized he was in a small cabin, inside a small house, in a small island in the middle of the ocean, and somehow it felt familiar like he has been there before... He starts to think of a way out in his brain, But in his heart, he could feel that He was far away from His very own London ... far away from 221B Baker Street... Home... He was far away from John, Rosie, Mrs. Hudson....far away from his family,.. for a few seconds he couldn't control his emotions ... He felt a lump in his throat.. his eyes were welling up with tears.. but he was fighting back his tears..
(See the end of the chapter for
---------------------------
Sherlock said, “Did you see John, It was her, She was the cabby I knew she wouldn’t go without meeting with me.” His phone buzzes, that old tone, that was assigned only for her, he received a long text from her,
As soon as Sherlock finished reading her text, Lestrade called, to inform that the man died inside the police car. Sherlock said "a small pin dipped in poison in his shoes killed him. Her mission is complete. We couldn’t stop her this time, She won."
In the meantime Molly called, she said the man died because his Esophagus and Small Intestine have been sliced up into pieces with fine particles of glass. Sherlock said the chef who made the omelet for breakfast for this man cracked a glass, squished it, made very fine unnoticeable pieces and mixed those with the egg yolk, and made the omelet with that so the man would eat it and the glass particle would go inside him and start cutting his food pipes and intestines internally, and the man would die eventually. Find the chef Lestrade, and by the way, your phone is vibrating, answer that now it's annoying."
Sherlock secretly and quickly turned off the switch and reach out towards a big blunt instrument and then Hit the other Sherlock with all his forces. He kept on hitting the machine form of himself until it was totally broken down into pieces of small parts of machines. He hides all the broken parts underneath the big machines inside the room and got out of the room. Then he starts searching inside every room for the Newly-made machine version of John, he had to stop it from doing whatever evil it was programmed to do. But instead of finding that, he found a room guarded by 4 well-armed guards.
As Sherlock said Mycroft Doesn't work with the Govt. He is the Government... So he helped us clean the mess...  He helped with clearing my name... By changing the CCTV footage... And Lestrade said that the police are not gonna remember what happened... They will say no bombing happened at all... All were a false alarm...
You crack the code... I WIN
In the other room... Sherlock saw a lot of electronic equipment spread across the room... And there was some High tech programming on the computer screen...  He didn't understand that much ... But suddenly he heard a sound of some steps approaching the room... He hides quickly behind a big machine... Connected with many wires...
Moriarty: And get yourself charged up...
Sherlock replies from the living room, "I am in the middle of an important experiment. Don't disturb me now." John rushed into the living room; he puts his laptop in front of him and said, "It's him, Sherlock. It's him, he is coming to destroy us, Sherlock." Sherlock looked at the Laptop screen, and for the first time he was stunned, he was completely speechless. John broke the silence, he said, "Where is Mrs. Hudson?" "I have sent her in an important place for a secret job," Sherlock replied. John said, "Call Mycroft then maybe he can help." John dialed his number immediately, but his phone was switched off. He tried calling Lestrade, but his phone was also switched off, Sherlock said, "Molly, We need her help, as both Mycroft's and Lestrade's phone is off, we need all the help we can get, call her." John dialed Molly's number immediately, but Oh god Everything seemed hopeless, her phone was switched off too. Sherlock said, "All of their phones can't be switched off at the same time, it's him. Something has happened to them, Moriarty is taking all our closest persons away from us." Suddenly they both stopped talking, after a few seconds, they both screamed together, "ROSSY" They rushed in her room, and their scariest nightmare has become true, Rossy was missing, Her crib was empty, her whole room was empty. John started crying; he said in his trembling voice, "I myself had put her on her crib last night after she had drifted off to sleep on your lap, and now she is not here, what happened to her Sherlock, Where is she, Sherlock."
Sherlock gets up and picks john upon his shoulder and gets out of the room... saying the guards ... "Boss's orders.." They both were out of the room then they enter inside a room which Sherlock found earlier while searching every room, that was filled with vaults filled with cash. Sherlock breaks into the vaults and took enough amount of cash and within 5 minutes they were out of the place that they were kept in... But near the main gate of the place, they found a note and a British Army Browning L9A1... The note was__...
" You think you have got out by making a fool of me... you think you are playing the game on your way... But you forgot that I am the King... and you are just the players of my game... and I am the one that sets the rules of this game... And it's time that you see me... Because now I wanna play with you, face to face, Sherlock...
John says... “ But we don't have time only 2 minutes 43 seconds... and the timer is on... Use your mind palace... Crack the code... Stop the timer and defuse the bomb now...           Its 2 minutes 29 seconds... Do it now..”
5 months have passed... A lot of things happened in the last 5 months... Things got complicated... they got resolved... some Mystery got solved... others appeared in new forms...
An anxious wave of nervousness and guilt washed over Sherlock has he inched his hand out towards John. There was a brief moment of hesitation as his slender fingertips touched the hem of the jumper, barely gripping it. With a deep breath Sherlock pulled the jumper up. There was some resistance, it seemed pasted to John’s skin, it had to be pulled away from John before it could be pushed out of the way. In the silent room Sherlock could hear the dry separating sound of the fabric unsticking from John as if the blood had fastened it to him like glue. A patch of ivory skin was bared just above the waistline of John’s trousers, Sherlock slipped his other hand to John’s other hip, pulling the thick material up from there as well. As more of the cashmere was pushed away, more cuts and scars were revealed. Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath, rucking up John’s jumper up past his ribcage until it was bunched up under John’s armpits, as high as it could go.
“Why?” Sherlock pleaded. The whisper of his words ghosted over the shell of John’s ear. There was a long pause between the two men. For a long moment they just stood intertwined in an intimate embrace on Blackfriars bridge under the midnight sky just listening to each other’s breathing.
John leaned over the edge once more. Pushing himself up until somehow he was balancing perfectly on the stone side, towering over the beautiful blackness.
“Again?” The voice that responded was bitter and angry. “You planning on leaving again so soon? I would have thought you would wait at least a day before abandoning me again.” His sarcasm was coated with poison, a venomous concoction of hurt, betrayal and angry desperation lacing each syllable. Although Sherlock knew it was a tactic to avert suspicion from himself and redirect the conversation, it was still said earnestly and hurt Sherlock to hear it.
John’s mug of tea had long gone cold though he still held it cradled loosely in his hands since Mrs. Hudson had handed it to him a few hours ago. Holding his hands out to take the tea was probably the only movement he had made all day. For hours he had just sat in his chair in a trance-like state, just staring at Sherlock’s violin resting on his stand. It lay there so innocently, it hadn’t been packed away properly, just left there for the next time Sherlock would pick it up. Images of Sherlock’s long, slender fingers dragging the bow across he strings to draw out beautifully melancholic music. Ghosts of the notes echoed through the silent apartment and just for a second John imagined he was back, just standing there facing the window, his eyes closed serenely as he drew the bow back and forth.
Sherlock tried to hike him up so he was standing but to no avail. Each time John would just slump back into his leaned over form. Eventually Sherlock began to lower him down. It was difficult and John’s faced pressed more firmly into Sherlock’s chest the closer he got to the ground, briefly Sherlock wondered if he could still breathe. After a minute, John was lying face down on the floor, Sherlock grabbed his shoulder and the back of his head to slowly turn him over.
When the sobs had finally subsided to small, pathetic whimpering noises and then to nothing, John went about his usual shower routine. After reluctantly turning off the shower, John moved back over to the bathroom mirror. Wiping off the condensation, he grabbed a razor and a fresh razor head from the bathroom cabinet. As John brought the razor head up to attach it to the handle he hesitated as his eye caught the shining metal blades. He dismissed the idea almost as quickly as it appeared, the voice in the back of his head oddly deciding to remain quiet at the seemingly innocent gesture. Although he tried to push the thought back into the furthest reaches of his mind that didn’t stop him from being more acutely aware of the blades as he dragged them over his skin. Just as he was finishing the last stroke the razor nicked his jaw. He was aware that he reacted much slower than usual. Foregoing his usual curse, he just stood, staring transfixed in the mirror as a tiny rivulet of blood made its way down his throat. The innocent crimson droplet brought back flashes of images of masses of blood matted into curly black hair and running over ivory skin. John physically flinched at the image and looked away, wiping the blood quickly with his thumb. Ambling out of the bathroom and to his room, John picked out some fresh clothes from his wardrobe and dressed quickly. Already he was beginning to look like a functioning human being again.
John wrenched off the jumper he wore and threw it carelessly in the bathtub. The wall-mounted mirror was just about long enough to show down to John’s pelvis. His ribs were starkly obvious through his drawn skin and his stomach was shrunken and caved-in. Haphazard lines of red and brown and pink criss-crossed around his hips, the highest one, a long, curved crimson streak reaching just below his ribs.
“Fine, I suppose,” his voice was fragile but John could tell he was trying to push more strength into it. John gave him a sympathetic look, eyes urging him to say more.
-Mary
Although there was still traffic clogging the roads and weary-faced people trudging down the streets, avoiding all unnecessary human contact that they could, London was fairly quiet in the early morning. The sun didn’t appear even close to rising but the usual wall of grey clouds gave London enough light but made everything seem oddly muted. John didn’t feel like he was himself. He felt distanced from everything. All thoughts left his head. He left his head. All there was were images cut from random memories. Some of Sherlock bent over some crime scene or other, some of Harry piss drunk and crashed on John’s sofa, some of his and Mycroft’s conversation the other day and then one that would keep recurring, coming back after almost each picture. It was a view over some of London. It was quite high up, he could see the tops of buildings and the easily distinguishable red buses slotted into the traffic on the grey roads that separated the blocks of concrete buildings. It looked like the view from a rooftop.
“I’m sorry Sherlock, I’m so sorry, so, so, sorry. Sherlock. Sherlock, please, why? I’m sorry.” John’s words punctuated each rushed-out, shaking breath as he cried. Curled into ball on the floor John was assaulted by everything at once. He needed to get it out. Had to get it out. Everything was tearing through his insides and overtaking him, destroying him.
Chris hesitated. “You’re not as stupid as most people,” he offered.
John could admit prostate exams weren’t a subject he was especially knowledgeable about, but he was admittedly skeptical. Still, he didn’t care to press the issue. He was much more interested in watching the proceedings.
“I’m not a religious man John, but in this case, my answer has to be ‘oh god, yes.’”
“Er, what was that?”
Sherlock. He reached forwards and pinched his bum. “Is that how you speak to your doctor?”
John slid into the seat opposite him, wracking his brain for something that wasn’t completely inane to say. “So, er, has Mike set you up on many dates, then?”
“Unless you intend to examine me here?” Sherlock didn’t sound impressed.
struggle with wasn’t related to warfare or military threats. His greatest difficulty, as he’d come to discover these past few weeks, was resigning himself to a life of monotony.
Envy burned low in his gut as he watched the easy strides and confident gaits of other passersby. He was never more aware of his cane than when he was surrounded by physically hale people.
John considered teasing him for fishing for compliments, but it occurred to him that Chris might genuinely be insecure. “Of course,” he said emphatically. “I have no idea how you managed all that.”
John threw his head back and laughed. He may have been just a teensy bit besotted with the man across from him. “Of course you did.” Realizing he was laughing too loudly and in a public setting, John forced his giggling to subside. “Your brain—the way you think—it’s extraordinary.”
He averted his gaze from the tactile couple and limped doggedly on.
“I bet you are,” John muttered. There was no way Sherlock was actually concerned about his prostate. He’d either concocted this scheme as an easy way of getting sex without having to ask for it, or he was curious on a more scientific level. Either way, John wasn’t going to protest any further. Getting to act out one of his fantasies was reward enough. Sherlock's personal reasons were irrelevant in the end.
“Is that legal?”
“Oh, the police, when they’re out of their depth.” He paused. “Which is always.”
After several false starts Chris simply said, “I don’t mind.”
“Don’t be ridiculous. It’s almost time for the smugglers to meet.”
“Ah, right.” John shifted. “In that case, I’ll use the loo quick. It’d probably look a bit suspect if we both left the table at the same time.”  He slid out of the booth, belatedly remembering his cane.
John snickered. “That’s brilliant.”
“Do most people not sleep together on the first date?”
“I’m aware what the prostate is.”
His eyes narrowed unexpectedly. “If you’re flattering me with the expectation of sexual intercourse as a reward, I must warn you in advance that I am not interested in so-called ‘one-night stands.’”
John had never been close friends with Mike during their time at St. Bart’s—they’d mostly run in different crowds, in fact—but Mike had an easy air and was well-liked by everyone. John in comparison wasn’t as extroverted. He was polite and cordial and British to the core, but valued his alone time and was often happier spending the night in than partying with friends. His popularity in secondary school had been more due to association than his own merits. As a member of the rugby team, his popularity had been firmly cemented, and his social standing had been maintained up until he enrolled in the military.
Chris shifted. “I didn’t. I happened to say ‘Afghanistan’ first and from your facial cues was able to conclude you’d been there.”
“I’ll have the, er, risotto.”
His flatmate's face brightened. “Excellent! I knew you'd see reason.”
“You really think so?”
“It’s standard,” Sherlock replied, calmly folding his dress shirt and laying it aside.
“What are you on about? I’m sitting across from Chris right now.”
They shared a small smile. John still felt residual annoyance, but it was quickly subsumed by endearment and affection. Sherlock Holmes was a ridiculous, impossible man. In other words: he was perfect, and John had no intention of letting him get away.
John smiled. “You’re a medical man, too.”
Russell Square Park was nice this time of year. “Nice” was about the most praiseworthy adjective John was capable of mustering nowadays.
“Seriously?” He’d be lying if he said he wasn’t lonely. And bored.
“What?”
“You seem to appreciate me.”
Chris hesitated, and John wondered if he was embarrassed. “I’m a consulting detective.” He met John’s gaze with the glint of a challenge in his eyes, as if daring him to laugh or belittle him.
“But you had to have known some of it!”
“The average time for prostate exams is five minutes.” Sherlock sounded annoyed, as if he thought John should already know this.
Mike nodded. “He’s a brunette, though. I seem to recall you having a preference for blondes.”
“No, it’s brilliant, actually.”
“That’s a fair point. Glad it worked out for the best, though. I always said, love is finding someone who complements your weirdness.”
“Approximately—“
“I don’t think—”
John wasn’t placated. “Here.” He shoved a forkful of risotto at Chris.
The crease between Chris’ eyebrows deepened. When he lifted his head from his phone, his expression veered closer to annoyance than surprise. He opened his mouth to speak, but upon making eye-contact with John, promptly closed it in favour of giving him a thorough once-over.
“I’ve learned that as a general rule if an attractive man sits with you, you should go along with whatever he says.”
The crease between John’s brows deepened. He’d have to force Chris to eat some of his, then. He wondered why Chris would have chosen a restaurant to meet at if he had no intention of eating. Did he have an eating disorder? Refusing to eat in anyone else’s presence was a common sign. He glanced at Chris’s hands. Calluses on the knuckles from frequent induced vomiting was a dead giveaway of bulimia, but Chris’s hands were unblemished.
“Really? Such as…?”
He scrubbed his cheek with his hand, as if he could will away the flush there. “I get bad nightmares too. Sometimes I wake up shouting. It complicates things.”
“Eating is boring. I never eat while I’m on a case.”
“Probably,” Chris agreed, “but most people are boring, and their problems are tedious.”
A flush seeped across Chris’ pale cheeks. “Most people would be inclined to disagree. Or they get tired of it eventually. It’s a magic trick to them, and it gets old fast.”
“When have you ever been ‘manly’?” Mike teased.
“And what do you do as a consulting detective? Who consults you?”
an obnoxious voice in his head that sounded suspiciously like his therapist berated.
John grinned, feeling the last of the tension in his shoulders drain away. He suspected Chris had some interesting stories to share about his line of work. Before he could broach the subject, the waiter came by to introduce himself and take their orders.
He swallowed heavily. “It Is? Why?” Did Sherlock have other experiments planned? That’s really all this was to him. Just another experiment.
“How did you narrow it down to Afghanistan?” John asked, breathless and hanging onto every word.
“Yes, but a different type.”
The torrent of rain provided an unremitting backdrop of white noise as John pored over his microbiology textbook. Across from him, Sherlock sat with a pensive expression, his quicksilver eyes narrowed as he stared intensely at some fixture existing only within his mind’s eye. If it weren’t for the shallow rise and fall of his chest, he could easily be mistaken for a marble-hewn statue. The subject of Sherlock’s concentration was known only to him, but John wouldn’t be surprised if he was cataloguing the types of tobacco ash used in the nineteenth century, or something equally peculiar and superfluous.
John could have put the Afghan sun to shame with how hot his face burned. God, he was such an idiot. Of course no one who looked like
“You sure about that? I can't imagine it’s pleasant being woken up nearly every night to the sound of screaming.”
“Well, good on you.”
“No preference,” John assured. Not when it came to hair colour. He was rather selective when it came to personality. He tended to seek out fellow thrill-seekers, or someone loud and boisterous and even eccentric. Anyone who could hold his attention, really. Of course those weren’t easily observable qualities.
“You enjoy pleasuring your partners greatly, and you prefer to top,” Chris continued.
John laid his palms on each of Sherlock’s cheeks, admiring the contrast of his tanned skin against Sherlock’s pale flesh, before spreading his cheeks apart. He slowly circled Sherlock’s hole with a lubed finger, and repeated the motion until his external sphincter muscle relaxed.
To Mike’s credit, his eyes only widened slightly at the revelation. “Didn’t know you swung that way.”
John sipped unthinkingly at his coffee and successfully burned his tongue in the process. “Ah, no.”
John felt a small rush of pleasure at the compliment, but it was chased by suspicion. “How do I know you’re not just having a lark? Or that this is all part of an experiment?”
John approached the table, wishing for the umpteenth time that he didn’t need his cane. “Hello,” he blurted. It wasn’t the smooth one-liner he was hoping for, but it would have to do.
“Not that good. Haven’t gotten laid once since I was dispatched.” John had never had difficulty pulling—he hadn’t earned the moniker “Three Continents” for nothing, after all—but it was different now. He was older and damaged and who could possibly want a partner who screamed at random points in the night? He received enough ire over that from his landlord. “Er, I hope I’m not making you uncomfortable,” John hastened to add.
“How do you mean?”
Not-Chris winced. “Yes. There’s that too.”
“But… you knew I was a doctor. And about my time in the military. How is that possible?”
“One of the patrons of this restaurant, along with the sous chef, are involved in an underground smuggling ring. I’m afraid once the gentleman requests to speak with the chef in order to give his compliments, I’ll have to leave you. It should take no more than seven minutes to apprehend them. The police are waiting nearby for my text.”
“I don’t think I’ve ever heard of that before.”
Sherlock reached around to inspect John’s hands. “Your nails are trimmed. Don’t bother.”
Chris had no shortage of questions. The depth and breadth of his inquiries almost made John wonder if he were assembling a profile on him, for whatever reason. He was in the middle of regaling Chris with a story of the time Harry trapped him in a treehouse for seven hours by destroying the ladder, which led to him jumping out of the tree and breaking his leg, when the waiter came by with John’s food and a bottle of wine.
“It was a rhetorical question,” John snapped.
“Jesus, what are the chances?”
John blew on his drink. “Neither did I. Commander Sholto was… he was something.”
His lips twitched. “Would you like to know some more?”
“Watson! John Watson!”
“You’re saying you could deduce I was invalided from Afghanistan?”
John Watson had no difficulty navigating war-zones. When it came to minefields, there were two possible outcomes—either he’d successfully avoid any landmines and return safely to his unit, or he would set one off and charred bits of his flesh would rain down like confetti over Kandahar’s deserts. He’d long ago reconciled the idea of a premature death at the hands of rebel forces, if it meant serving his Queen and Country.
“I'm due for a prostate exam.”
“I’d hoped you wouldn’t discover the truth until later.”
John blew out a frustrated breath.  “It’s fine,” John assured, a bit regretful he’d voiced a complaint. Chris was acerbic and a bit pompous, but he was a delightful change of pace from most people who hid their actual opinions behind polite mannerisms and societal conventions. Not only was it refreshing, but John had a sneaking suspicion Chris was a bit awkward in social situations and didn’t always know how best to conduct himself.
“Oh. That was fast, then.”
“I wouldn’t know, but I’d hardly classify us as ‘most people.’”
John’s jaw clenched so hard he felt it was going to snap. “Something you’d like to say?”
John fumbled for his glass of wine, suddenly desperate for alcohol. “It’s not that I don’t think you’re fit, but this is a first date.”
“A-add another one,” Sherlock gasped out.
“It’s not something normal people do.”
“Of course not. That would be ridiculous, moving in with someone so soon after meeting them.” He sipped his coffee. “I don’t move in until tomorrow afternoon.”
“Five minutes, huh?”
“John Watson,” Mike said slowly. “You are an absolute madman.”
“I know that,” John snapped. Yes, Sherlock was the genius of the two of them, but he was no idiot either.
Mike was a verifiable Cupid. John hadn’t met anyone as fascinating and enthralling as Chris in ages. Maybe ever. “That was amazing,” he breathed.
John squeezed passed one of the waiters.
John laid his hand atop Chris’ unthinkingly. “Chris, this is the most entertaining night I’ve had in a while.”
“That’s not—I meant if he’d told you about...” John couldn’t bring himself to say it.
John cleared his throat. “Yes, well, if there’s ever a vacancy, let me know.”
“Less chance of me breaking your nose,” John agreed.
, as our appointment is short.”
“I’m not boring you, am I?” John asked, uncharacteristically self conscious. He didn’t lead the most exciting life anymore, and his past as an army doctor paled in comparison to the career Chris was leading now.
“I’ve been shot, haven’t I? What’s more macho than bullets and guns and nearly dying?”
“While we’re laying everything on the table, I’m not sure how much Mike told you about me.” He gulped another mouthful of wine. “In, um, regards to my dating and sex life.”
Oh, this wasn’t reason. It was pure insanity, and John was a madman for agreeing to it.
“I don’t have an eating disorder, but thank you for your concern, Doctor.”
“How attractive you’d be.”
“Knowing Sherlock, I doubt he would’ve actually agreed to a blind date,” John pointed out.
Chris reached for a glass. John immediately arched a disapproving eyebrow.
Sherlock made a loud keening noise. He squirmed and writhed against the mattress, and John held his hip in place with his free hand to still him.
“Huh?”
“I was going to say most people are ‘dull’ but that works too.” He tilted his head. “Do you think I’m an idiot as well?”
“Guess I’m not most people.”
John bristled at Chris’ pragmatic tone. He felt his hackles rise. It was one thing for others to view him as a useless cripple, but to have his limp trivialized as something imaginary was another matter. “That’s a little rude, you know.”
“What case are you on?”
“It's a competitive field.”
“You have other redeeming qualities, though.”
Sherlock was silent for so long John was almost sure that was the end of it. “I can help you get ahead of the curve.”
“I know most things,” Sherlock pointed out.
Instead of smiling back, Chris stiffened, his countenance suddenly inscrutable.
“Seriously?”
It was a Tuesday afternoon. The sky was overcast, with bloated storm clouds gathering on the horizon. John’s mood was impervious to the bleak weather. He strode through the park with confident movements and a slight spring to his step.
“Deduction is what I’m best at.”
If Mike Stamford noticed his lack of a cane, he didn’t comment on it. The pair sat on what was becoming their usual bench.
Mike’s face softened. “Not too worry. He’s a decent sort.”
“If you're not going to examine it for me,” he continued, “I'll have to do it myself.”
John felt remarkably like a specimen under a microscope as Chris assessed him.
They all seemed so at ease, able to strike up conversation on a whim. Their waking thoughts probably revolved around their children or jobs or hobbies. When John closed his eyes or allowed himself time to ponder, all he saw was gunfire.
“I heard you were abroad somewhere getting shot at,” Mike continued. “What happened?”
“I said a
Sherlock stripped out his clothes expediently, before sprawling out before him like a Greco-Roman god.
“I reckon it’ll help me when I’m on the pull. Women like that sort of thing, don’t they? A manly protector?”
John blanched. Nothing could have prepared him for that response. He wondered if he’d misheard. Sherlock had never been known for ribaldry, and even consistently eschewed John’s inquiries about his dating and sex life. “What?”
“How is it?”
Chris puffed out his chest, clearly rankled by John’s disbelief. “Your haircut and your bearing both say military. You have a cane and a limp when you walk, but you stood perfectly fine in front of the booth to introduce yourself, as if you’d forgotten about it. Your injury is healed, but it was traumatic. Your face is tanned, but with no tan above the wrists. You’ve been abroad but not sunbathing. The only viable explanation is you were wounded in action, and, given your tan, leaves either Afghanistan or Iraq.”
“I didn’t agree, Sherlock.” He sighed, sensing it was going to be a fairly lengthy argument after all.
would have actually wanted to spend all night talking to a washed-up army doctor with  trust issues and a psychosomatic limp. Had 'Chris' played along solely to embarrass him? What else did he get out of it?
“O-of course.” Far be it from him to get in the way of a police investigation. “I take it this is why you chose this restaurant for our date.”
While he had considered Mike to be more of an acquaintance than a friend, it was refreshing seeing a familiar face again. Especially considering the only people he spoke to on a regular basis anymore were the cashiers at tesco’s, and his therapist.
John hit ‘accept.’ Before he could even get out a “Hello”, Mike’s tinny voice filled his ear.
He could almost see the gears turning in the complex machine of Chris’ brain. “You mean it? You really don’t mind me?”
“Watson, please.” Mike held up his hand. “I’ve never been that type. One of my best mates is very appreciative of the male sex. He’s a looker too, if you’re interested.”
“I suspect you’re in no dearth of positive traits.” Chris stroked his thumb over John’s hand. Only then did he realize neither of them had retracted their hands, or moved away. “Tell me more about yourself.”
“Yes. Sorry, yes, Mike, hello!”
“You mean it?”
“Please.”
“I’ve been calling you Chris this entire time!” he burst out.
“I’m fine,” Chris dismissed.
“Fine,” John said, to shut up him if nothing else. John's voice sounded somewhat strangled to his own ears, and he wondered what Sherlock would be able to deduce from it.
John shook his head. “A pity.”
He reached for his cane and lolloped out of his sorry excuse for a flat.
Sherlock glanced over his shoulder, the look on his face bordering on coy. “Alright, John?”
John’s heart quickened. Before he could reply, his phone let out an angry ring, cleaving through the tension between them. He checked the caller ID. “It’s Stamford. Probably calling to know how the date’s going. Should I tell him it’s going well?”
Some of the tension drained from John's muscles. This was Sherlock he was dealing with. Snarky, infuriating,
A sane person would surely take offense to that, but John could only snort. “Cheers.”
“Preferably much later.”
“Also true.”
“Nice of you to notice,” John said wryly. “It's not like we've been flatmates for the past three terms.”
It was embarrassing how relieved he was to hear Chris’ smooth baritone.
“I’m hardly going to die of alcohol poisoning from one glass,” he huffed.
Chris shrugged. “Lestrade wanted to take my statement now but I snuck away while his back was turned.”
“Most people are idiots,” Chris agreed.
people?” He uttered the word as if it were a blaspheme. “This isn't something many other students will be able to boast of. You would impress your simple-minded professors.”
“I don’t understand. You knew I was here meeting someone on a blind date and you let me believe it was you. That is so fucked up.” John’s hands curled into fists. “Hang on! You knew about Mike. I mentioned his first name to you, but you said his last name, which means you do know Mike Stamford.”
After purchasing their coffee, the pair settled on a park bench, deciding through some unspoken agreement to enjoy the pleasant break from London’s usual gray, rain-washed horizon while it lasted.
“Realize what?” he demanded, his patience wearing thin.
That definitely wasn’t proper protocol. Taking a deep breath, John coated his fingers with a generous amount of lube, before hesitating. Was he seriously about to do this to his best friend and flatmate? It definitely meant crossing several boundaries, and he wasn’t sure this was the sort of thing they should do without properly discussing first. Of course, he was probably overthinking it. Sherlock abhorred sentiment, and he’d probably delete this entire encounter from his Mind Palace in a few days. John was a different matter. He’d been in awe of Sherlock since the moment they met, and he’d fancied him romantically for almost as long. Forget being fair to Sherlock—was any of this fair to himself?
Chris snorted. John wasn’t entirely certain what to make of his response, so he followed his intuition.
Sherlock prattled on, seemingly unaware of the painful tightening John’s trousers were experiencing. “Of course you know how impatient I can occasionally get—” John snorted. “—and it's quite likely I'll injure myself if I self-perform the exam. Then I would need your help anyway to examine for tears or injury so you may as well put your doctorly expertise to work. If you don’t, any harm I endure will be on your conscience.”
John leaned forward. “Don’t leave me in suspense.”
John shook his head, disbelieving. “Mike mentioned you’re a medical man, but he didn’t specify which branch. Bet you’d make one hell of a psychologist with your observational skills.”
They continued to banter in between sipping at their glasses and passing the fork between them. Chris deduced Harry’s drinking problem and the sports John had been involved in growing up. He told John about the blog he ran, in which he enumerated an absurd number of tobacco types, and then went on a tangent about the uselessness of the solar system, and mentioned he had a sibling of his own. Chris had no positive adjectives for his older brother. John found every mundane tidbit about Chris’ life fascinating, and although he assumed it was mutual, as time went on Chris checked his watch with increasing frequency.
A significant portion of his days were devoted to staring blankly at the ceiling. He could recreate the water stain and the patterns on the ceiling from memory alone. When that became wearisome, he shifted to staring blankly at the wall instead.
Chris’ protests faded. He stared uncertain at the fork for a moment, before accepting it.
John frowned, assessing him. Chris was thin and slender, and easily below the healthy weight range for his height and age. “Did you already eat?”
“Yep. Reckon Mike told you all about it.”
Not much of a talker, it seemed, but John could work with that.
Sherlock’s garbled mumble was undetectable to human ears.
He’d never heard it worded quite that way.
“If you’re amenable,” Not-Chris began tentatively, “Perhaps we could start again?”
John made an involuntary noise at that. “Not to me. It’s been so long since I’ve met someone genuinely interesting.”
“Not hungry.”
Mike blanched. Before he could stammer out an apology that would no doubt be awkward for them both, John pressed on.
“What the hell, Watson? If you weren’t going to show couldn’t you have at least given a heads up? Poor Chris waited more than forty minutes. I kept assuring him you were on your way, because the Watson I know would have been decent enough to cancel in advance.”
“I hope that’s alright with you,” the consulting detective added.
It was sunny, but a light breeze stirred the sultry air. Sounds of laughter rang out, and men and women on their lunch breaks nursed coffee cups as they ambled passed.
“Drinking on an empty stomach?”
John’s smile was only somewhat forced. “I could go for coffee.”
Chris smiled. “Touché.”
John hesitated. “There were some fine blokes, though,” he offered, with forced casualness.
Mike shook his head with a full-bellied laugh. “If I’d known you and Sherlock would hit off, I would have simply introduced the two of you.”
He wasn’t suited for civilian life. He’d been cut from a different, harsher cloth, and the simple comforts and luxuries of day-to-day life held little appeal to him. Sure, he appreciated a warm bed, but it wasn’t all that nice when he couldn’t sleep in it for more than a couple hours before being awoken by nightmares. He also enjoyed commodities like tea and biscuits, and meals that didn’t come out of a can, but they lost their appeal when he was too nauseous and listless to bring himself to eat.
“Oh. Sorry.”
“Physical attractiveness is subjective, but I can assure you, you most definitely are.”
“Do you have any gloves? Gloves as in the kind for your hands, not, you know.” John mimed tearing open a condom packet.
John was so surprised at being addressed that he almost wondered if he was delirious. He turned, meeting a round, jubilant face. He couldn’t place a name, but something about the man’s guileless grin sparked familiarity. He grabbed John’s hand and pumped it eagerly before John could consider making a hasty retreat. “Stamford—Mike Stamford. We were at Bart’s together.”
“Potential partners should know about the worst in each other.”
He scanned for single occupant booths, before locating a man who matched the description. Mike’s friend, Chris, was a medical man as well, so they’d have some common ground, at least.
Sherlock grinned. “I assumed as much.”
Despite it apparently being only adequate, Chris stole several more bites.
“Excellent choice,” the waiter commended. “And for you, sir?”
“I would be amenable to having a partner.”
“I get it. Really it’s fine.”
“Diffi—oh.”
Chris said it all so matter-of-factly that John had to wonder if his leg was being pulled.
“Why didn’t you correct me?”
“Yes,” he confirmed. “I am acquainted with Mike Stamford.”
. And believe me when I say that is the highest compliment I’m capable of giving.”
“I’m not that weird, am I?”
“Yes. I do.”
He shook his hand, admiring Sherlock’s perfectly manicured nails and long fingers. “John Watson. But you already knew that.”
“I can’t always help it,” Chris continued earnestly. “The observing, I can’t turn it off.”
“Why not?”
It was the 'please' that did it. John could count on one hand the number of times Sherlock had actually used the word.
John counted the vertebrae in Sherlock’s spine. Twenty-six. He fantasized kissing each one. His gaze dragged down, lingering on the divots above Sherlock’s arse, before focusing entirely on his pert bum.
, John’s mind helpfully supplied. His eyes were an indiscernible shade of blue-grey and framed by long, sweeping lashes. His full lips were the kind usually only found on models or Hollywood actors who had relied on copious amounts of collagen or hyaluronic acid.
Chris stared at where their hands touched. He made no move to pull his hand away. “You miss it,” he murmured.
“I'm prepared for every eventuality.”
“Alright, I’ve read it helps if you take a deep breath.”
John waited until Sherlock had turned his back before discreetly adjusting his trousers. His gait was awkward as he trailed after Sherlock. He’d been in Sherlock’s bedroom before, but not often. Sherlock himself rarely seemed to venture inside it, and when he did it was seldom for the purpose of sleeping.
imagined it, but always as an indulgent fantasy. He’d never for one moment considered it was an actual possibility.
He shifted again. “I was at St. Bart’s carrying out an experiment when I overheard Stamford conversing with one of the doctors there. He was trying to cajole his friend into going on a blind date with you. I haven’t been privy to many blind dates and I thought it would be interesting to observe, so I suggested they go to this restaurant since I had prior cause to be here. The smugglers,” he clarified.
John admitted he was intrigued and he sat down to chat with them as they waited for Irene.
Sherlock grinned.  “Is this The Talk?  The ‘don’t hurt him or we’ll beat you up’ talk?  How delightful.”
The Knight’s lads were a lot more amiable.  Despite their initial misunderstanding, he and Greg Lestrade got on very well.  Lestrade was one of the older players and he seemed to be the father figure of the group.  John also ended up spending a lot of time with Mike Stamford, who was studying medicine as well.  Bill Murray could always be counted on to take the mick out of him if his head was swelling too much in his role as Captain, but also had a go at anyone who mouthed off at John.
Irene snorted.  “Since when have you had to like someone to fuck them?  You’re never picky, Sherlock, especially when you haven’t had any in forever.  And I know it’s been awhile.”
So much for Sherlock’s lofty lectures about transport.  Not that John was that surprised to find out Sherlock was a sensualist.  He might have eschewed eating and sleeping, but he did like the finer things.  All those posh bath products.  The sheets with high thread count.  Those bloody suits of his.  Even his sex toys were top of the line.  John wasn’t embarrassed to admit he recognized the brand of the stimulator.
John shook his head to stop the woolgathering and rang the buzzer.  Less than a minute later, Molly flung open the door and launched herself into John’s arms.  “John!!  I’m so happy you’re here!!  Oh, I’ve missed you so much.  Come in, come in!”
John stepped closer.  “I thought it showed class that you didn’t even try to get anywhere with me.”
Sherlock’s expression turned stormy.  “What the hell are you playing at?  You’re not that much of an idiot, John!  You’ve known from the beginning that I was attracted to you.  I only kept my distance because I understood you couldn’t return it.  When we became friends, I tried to set aside that attraction out of respect for you.”
But did he belong at Baker street.  The prospect of returning there made his heart quicken.  But once again he thought about the consequences if Sherlock rejected him.  Would he really be able to live there?  The relief he felt moments ago now evaporated.  Fuck!  He’d just torpedoed one relationship with his messy feelings, and now he had the potential of blowing up the one that mattered the most.
Sherlock murmured in his ear.  “We should get out of here before someone finds us.  Irene put up a sign before the shoot, but she might have taken it down.”
Sherlock chuckled darkly and shifted down, kissing up John’s thigh as he teased at John’s opening with his lubed up finger.  He nosed at John’s balls as he began massaging, and then licked a stripe up his cock to the tip.  John’s head fell back as he groaned, and that was when he felt the initial sting of Sherlock’s finger breeching him.  John felt a different kind of sting at the back of his eyes as he felt overcome that this was
John was more surprised by Sherlock’s reaction to the whole thing.  He agreed to do the video, but seemed very reluctant about the whole thing.  He couldn’t be
Staring at the pair he’d just found, John wondered what he would find if he were to go upstairs right now and look for them.  If they were gone, that would mean this was the same pair.  It would mean Sherlock had been snooping (no surprise there), had found them, and taken them for his own use.  John shivered as several possibilities flitted through his mind.  Clearly they had been used often, as the red was a bit faded.
Sherlock gave her an affronted look.  “How could you possibly know that?”
When the fly was all the way down and John was next to the bed, he turned and slowly peeled the jeans down over his arse.  He was quite relieved to be freed from the tight confines.  He bent and removed them entirely, glancing over his shoulder at Sherlock, who was watching him in reverence.  John climbed up onto the bed, crawling slowly up to his pillow and then reclined, stretching himself out onto his stomach.  He looked over his shoulder again and raised an eyebrow.
John nodded and gave him a tight smile.  “It’s the least I could do for a friend.  Sherlock…”  John didn’t know what came over him at that moment, but he felt all twisted up inside and wanted answers.  “You didn’t seem thrilled by Irene’s plan when she first told us about it.  You made it seem like you were concerned I’d be uncomfortable.  Except…today it’s been
Sherlock huffed, his cheeks getting even redder.  “Well, isn’t that your job as my boyfriend?  To feed me up?”
Irene made a frustrated sound, but chose instead to get even more personal.  “Do you get yourself off?”  John nodded, chuckling.  “How do you get in the mood for it?  Does porn do anything for you?”
Bill stared at him.  “How are you not interested?  He’s a fucking Adonis.  And you’ve heard the stories of what he’s like in bed.”
Sherlock started giggling as well and pretty soon they were having a hard time keeping it under control.  Sherlock hissed, “We can’t giggle at a video shoot!” but that set them off even more.
When they got back to the sitting room, Sherlock was immediately snagged by Irene, who wanted to set up a time they could work on editing her video.  She was nervous about getting it just right and knew Sherlock had a good eye for this sort of thing.  John looked around and found Molly, heading her way to offer cleaning duties in the morning.
dancing to it.  It’s not subtle at all!”  Christ, the way that Sherlock had danced to that song.  The cover she used had so been full of longing, and juxtaposed with how Sherlock conveyed the yearning through dance had cut John to the
The other players laughed uproariously, and more than a few looked envious.  John shook his head and laughed.  “Did you just make a scoring joke?  We’re not bloody sixteen anymore, come up with something original.  And whilst you’re at it, you all worry about your own cocks.
Sherlock came up to John and put his arm around his shoulder.  “I don’t know what you all are talking about over here, but John doesn’t look happy and that concerns me.”
Molly started to protest, but John held up his hand.  “It’s alright, Molly, I’ll spill.”  He sat down.  “His name was James Sholto.  He was a lecturer at Loudain, a teaching fellow.  I barely made it halfway through the semester before I’d fallen for him.  He never seemed to mind that I always had questions.  It seemed to fuel his enthusiasm.  He…he kept looking at me during lecture.  As if I was the only one in the room.  But I knew it would be stupid to approach him, then.  So, I kept it to myself until term ended.”
are what matters. That’s what deserves the attention, and that was what Sholto couldn’t give John.  Sherlock can’t give him that, either.”
enjoy seeing his face when you turn him down.”
put out on John’s behalf could he?  It seemed like he was masking the real reason, and John couldn’t help but feel hurt by what that reason might be.
Irene beamed.  “Very practical, John.”
John blinked.  “Wow…that’s pretty arrogant to assume they all want him.”
have casual sex, they just don’t generally want to.  But in my case, you are correct.  I haven’t had sex yet.”
Sherlock’s cheeks tinged pink and he looked down.  “You really do…
John reached for the box, and hesitated.  He allowed himself one last glimpse inside of it, and frowned when he saw something unusual at the bottom.  Red cotton and scraps of metal.  John reached into the box and pushed aside various objects that he was absolutely not going to think about had been
song, attributed to
John read Bill’s instagram reply, and sent out a ribald response.  Then he recalled that he was curious about Sherlock Holmes’ profile. He tapped on Irene’s account and went down to the most recent video, then tapped on the link to Sherlock’s account.  He wasn’t sure what he was expecting to see in Sherlock’s gallery, but it certainly hadn’t been the odd assortment of ballet, chemistry, classical music, and forensic stuff.
As Sherlock drove the short distance back to their little cottage, John stared in contented silence out the window.  Though Sherlock was also silent, John could almost hear the thoughts churning inside his head as he tried to decide whether to fess up.  John could have placed a bet and won on how long it would take before Sherlock blurted out, “Alright,
John gently set his hand on Sherlock’s shoulder.  “Here’s the thing, love.  You can do all the right things and still hurt people.”
John put his dog tags in his pocket and returned the pants to the box, folding the flaps down.  Taking the box downstairs to the bins, he squashed down the tiny voice in his head that wondered whether Sherlock would have committed suicide if they’d been romantically involved.
After one frustrating take when Sherlock missed the camera by a mile, instead of jerking away, Sherlock rested his forehead against John’s, growling in frustration.  John gasped in surprise and Sherlock quickly took a step back.  “Sorry,” he murmured, wincing.
John stood in front of his wardrobe for far too long before he caved and went to get Molly.  Even knowing it would invite more chatter, he needed her opinion on what to wear.  After much hemming and hawing, she decided that Sherlock wouldn’t appreciate anything fancy and would prefer John to look like John.
girlfriend.”
John felt his shoulders wilt.  He cleared his throat.  “So, does that mean he’s still having loads of sex?”
the ones concerned that you’re about to break John’s heart.”
When Irene finally came in (Molly had long since given her a key to the flat), she was practically vibrating from excitement.  “I’m sure Molly suspects what I have to tell you.  The Instagram videos I’ve been doing have caught the attention of Bohemia Studios.  They are a
demisexual.  You’re only attracted to someone you’ve fallen in love with.  I could tell by the way you looked at me.  Like you were admiring a work of art, but not one that you wanted to fuck.”
Irene looked up from the mobile.  “Don’t mind us, I was showing Molly some of the comments on my latest video.”
to fall for him because my heart’s been bruised enough.  But I hope that
Molly’s face brightened and she clapped her hands together.  “You talked?  That’s fantastic!”
On the other hand, Molly’s warnings continued to ring in his head, especially with how difficult it was to sort out all the reactions he was having to Sherlock.  Like that day John almost caused a fire with the wrong ingredient.  When Sherlock touched him, he’d felt a little thrill.  But he dismissed it as being keyed up from all the dirty talk after rugby training followed by the frank discussion about sex he had with Sherlock.
Irene gave him a catlike smile.  “It’s the way he hooks all his conquests.  When he meets someone he’s interested in taking to bed, he deduces their sexuality.”
The morning of Valentine’s Day, Sherlock woke up to see a vase next to the bed with a wide array of flowers.  They were all pink and red, but none of them were roses.  Instead, they represented some of the flowers that Sherlock was intending to plant in their garden for the bees.  Allium, foxgloves, hollyhock, bee balm, geraniums.  Not exactly an arrangement that a florist might have picked, but Sherlock was delighted by the symbolism.
John put his head in his hands, listening to Molly’s exasperated tones as she jumped to explain.  “John, I’m so sorry, she really thinks all boys want is sex.  And I don’t think she truly understood what you told her about demis.”  She turned to her girlfriend.  “If this was just about sex, Sholto would have had John six ways to Sunday.  But he knew that John needed more from him.  That was why he turned him down.  John doesn’t feel attraction until he feels love.  It’s not like he’s unlocking some level of gameplay.  The desire for sex is just a byproduct.  His
John took a deep breath and poured everything out, then set up the flask and Bunsen again.  He followed Sherlock’s direction, and sure enough, the solution set up perfectly.  He laughed in delight.  “So tell me, does this make you the half-blood prince?”
Sherlock mumbled, “We haven’t had sex yet, John.  Ask me after.”
“What just happened?  Goddamnit, don’t tell me I missed the whole thing!”  John turned to see Irene regarding him eagerly as Molly stared at the door wide-eyed.  Irene grabbed his arm and shook it.  “Well?  Did he deduce you?”
Sherlock stared down at him.  “And when I came back, you’d long since buried the memory of that discovery.  Did your best to delete it, but not entirely successful.”
Sherlock huffed in mock outrage, which quickly melted into contentment as John snuggled even closer.  “Goodnight, John.”
John felt his neck flush hot and he knew it wasn’t remembered embarrassment of that moment.  “Jesus fucking Christ, Sherlock.  If I wasn’t ready to gnaw my arm off from hunger, I’d want to do something about that right now.  How about we go get dinner and then you can show me what you had in mind?”
“Christ, Sherlock, I’m sorry!  I forgot Molly told me you all were getting in extra rehearsal time for the recital.  I shouldn’t have asked for help, you’re far too busy.”
John gave him a sceptical look and Sherlock huffed even louder.  “Fine.  Can I at least…kiss you?”
John wasn’t sure what Sherlock meant by meal, until suddenly he
There was a long silence, and then Irene spoke up again.  “But, I don’t understand what this has to do with Sherlock.  There are no moral or ethical dilemmas here.  You can fuck to your heart’s content.”
One of the more recent images was a screenshot of an article about a murder case.  He said in the caption that it was obvious the brother was the killer, noting the mention of a shed and a missing ladder, and that NSY should have figured it out if they weren’t filled with idiots. There was a response from @greglestrade telling him to piss off, and he was sure NSY was doing a brilliant job.  Sherlock responded, “Unlikely, Gerald. I hope when you join the Met, they become slightly less idiotic.” @greglestrade responded, “ffs my name is Greg it’s right there in the profile!” John started giggling hysterically as @sallybobally replied to him that he shouldn’t take the bait, and @greglestrade replied “you’re one to talk, you let him wind you up all the time.”  Sherlock then told them to go have their domestic somewhere else and quit cluttering up his Instagram.  John was doubled over in laughter when he finished reading.
John looked at him in surprise, and then folded his arms.  “Yeah, Irene mentioned that, so you think you can back off the caveman routine?  Is there something about ballet dancers that makes people territorial? Irene was the same way about Molly.”  His insides roiled at the possibility he’s already blown it with a teammate, but he wasn’t going to put up with bullshit.
John huffed out a shaky laugh as Sherlock began spritzing water all over his chest.  He was right, it was warm.  But that didn’t last long - the wetness lowered the temperature of his skin, and he felt his nipples tighten.   Sherlock glanced over his shoulder at Irene and Molly, then turned back to John.  “Look, if you’re uncomfortable with me pulling your towel off, we can just have Molly hand me an identical one off screen.”
?  All we can promise is that we try not to.”
Molly gave her a quelling look.  “Yes, and if you’re going to ogle John like he’s in a zoo, the least you can do is help him move in.”  Irene looked away in a huff and Molly giggled.  “Come on, let’s get that over with now, so John can find a more permanent spot for his car.  Last thing he needs his first day here is to get a ticket.”
John cleared his throat and tried to be rational.  “I uh…think it works better with Sally.  The song is about a volatile relationship, and that describes theirs pretty well.”  He forced a chuckle.
John scowled.  “Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft said not to dispose of anything, that he would take care of it.”
John frowns.  “What do you mean, ‘deduce?’”  He recalled the username, @thescienceofdeduction, and wondered if that was what she meant.
Sherlock chuckled.  “Well, I’ve deduced that you are bisexual.
Bill was the one who told John about scholarship opportunities if he transferred to Knight’s College and it had felt like Bill was saving his life.  John had already decided to switch his major to medicine, and really wanted to switch universities as well, but he wasn’t sure if he was overreacting.  He hadn’t been happy at Loudain. He never really made friends, and didn’t click well with his rugby mates.
John shrugged one shoulder in an attempt to look nonchalant.  “Dunno what you mean.”
One Saturday night, John was plotting his escape so he wouldn’t have to watch the latest member of the swim team, Jim Moriarty, practically devour Sherlock with his eyes.  He was very good-looking, and wearing a white t-shirt that hugged every sculpted muscle.  He was so obviously receptive to a hook-up that John was surprised they hadn’t left the party yet.
Irene eyed the car eagerly.  “Don’t you dare!  This will come in quite handy.  Imagine not having to lug our equipment on the tube.”  Molly elbowed her and she arranged her features to appear less grasping.  “And of course you wouldn’t want to get rid of something that was a gift from your mother.  Think of all the memories soaked into the very upholstery.”
John rolled his eyes.  “You know I couldn’t possibly do as good a job.  I’ll take a stab at it, though.  Your little joke just now…  I can imagine that most of the blokes you sleep with probably don’t appreciate your intellect, especially when you’re so sharp with it.  And I also think you don’t really care, you’re only interested in sex with them.  But…perhaps at some point there was someone whose opinion did matter?  Perhaps early on in your experience?”  Sherlock looked away.  John folded his arms and gave him a patient look.  “Come on, Holmes.  It’s only fair.  One bared soul for another.”
John chuckled at Irene’s overt possessiveness.  “I did sort of start to think I was demi after what happened with Molly, but I couldn’t be sure. It might have been an isolated incident, like maybe I was greysexual.  As you can see, I did a lot of research.  I knew for sure I was demi after…after James.  And as I said, we’re not talking about
Sherlock licked into his mouth, devouring him with his tongue.  John gave it back, dragging his teeth against Sherlock’s lower lip that he’s been obsessing about for weeks.  There had been so many times when he couldn’t focus on what Sherlock said to him because of that goddamn mouth of his, and now he was finally able to suck and bite and worship it.
John smiled and kissed Sherlock’s curls.  “Don’t pretend that this change in career isn’t as much for me as it was for you.  It was no coincidence that you started talking about it a few months after my operation.”  Sherlock huffed.  “All I’m saying is that this is for both of us. And all I care about is being by your side forever.”  He lifted Sherlock’s chin and gave him a long, soft kiss.
John laughed.  He realised he was feeling a bit giddy knowing that Sherlock rejected Moriarty.  “It’s a superstition, Irene.  I say it as a joke, and it’s up to them whether they’ll obey.  I know for sure Greg doesn’t, Sally wouldn’t stand for it.”
When he came back from the loo to tell them he was leaving, he was surprised to see Sherlock had taken his spot.  Moriarty was nowhere to be seen.  Sally was gone too, so John sat down in her former spot, feeling bemused.  As he got settled, Molly chose that moment to vacate Irene’s lap, mumbling that she needed the loo herself.
Irene smiled secretively.  “Mmm, we’ll talk about it when you’re sober.  I have a feeling we’ve been
“Yeah, I’ll be there.  I mean, may as well.  No point in making two trips to drop off and then pick up your gear.”
Bill stood up.  “
For dinner, John recreated the dishes they ate when they had their first proper date at Angelo’s.  For dessert John presented him with a box of chocolate honey truffles.  They sat by the fire with glasses of red wine, feeding each other the chocolates.
Sherlock scoffed.  “Are you joking? Of course we’d agree!”
John tried to think back on the past months, whether Sherlock gave any clue as to whether he still had any attraction for him.  He paced back and forth, feeling more and more agitated, until finally something came to mind.  “I prefer my doctors clean-shaven.”  John remembered the thrill it had given him, and how he’d quickly squashed it.  It wasn’t much, but John was quickly realizing that it was enough.

John barked out a laugh, but no one else seemed to think it was funny.  Mike was shaking his head.  “Greg has a point.  Sherlock’s never been friends with any of the blokes he’s slept with.  Doesn’t want to lead them on into thinking they’re gonna be in a relationship.  It’s only a matter of time before he’ll be holding you at arm’s length.” He tipped his head towards Dimmock as if to prove his point.
Irene’s playful expression melted and she sighed.  “I’m sorry I upset you, Molly.  But you know Sherlock, he says he’s married to his work.  And I’ll hardly need to orchestrate their meeting.  Sooner or later Sherlock will come looking for John.  I can’t help it if I want to have a front row seat to it happening.”
sex.  But none of it has ever come close to hearing those words from you.  I’d have been shocked to hear them from anyone.  But the fact that they came from you, John.  You’re the only one that matters.”
He was feeling very gratified by how things are going with this team compared to the one at Loudain.  He felt much more of a connection with these blokes.  A part of it was the fact that they all decided to make him captain and then showed him the respect the title deserved.  At Loudain, he was treated with great disdain for both his stature and his novice status, and it never sat well with him.  He worked hard, and that never seemed to count for anything with them.
matter.  I’m barely an adult, I don’t need to be worrying about love.  I should just…have sex.  Get it over with and stop overthinking it.  For the first time, I’m in a situation where I want to have sex with someone that wants to have sex with me.  I just need to…to do
John held up his hands and made gentle shushing noises.  “Sherlock, no no no, don’t overthink it, love.  I enjoyed it, honestly.  I know it’s not really a game.  I know how you feel.  And I know this is difficult for you.”  He stepped up to Sherlock, pressing his hand to his chest.  “I fully believe what you’ve told me, that you know how to make me feel good.  So just concentrate on that.”
John felt rather boneless when Sherlock scooped his arms around him and pulled him back into an upright position, embracing him.  John wrapped his own arms around Sherlock’s neck, burying his face into the crook.  He trembled as Sherlock stroked his hand up and down his back, a myriad of emotions coursing through him.  Everything had happened so fast.  One minute they were wrapping up the most sexually frustrating shoot of this entire project, the next minute they were practically devouring each other.
.  He could possibly explain it away: Sherlock was a compelling person that drew anyone’s eyes, it didn’t have to be sexual.
But the two things together could only mean one thing: Sherlock thought of John when he was getting himself off.   And Christ, if that wasn’t the absolute worst thing he could find out.  Because what if this meant he could have been with Sherlock in a more intimate way, but now it was too late?
Molly’s lip wobbled.  “Oh, John.”  She came up behind him and wrapped her arms around his shoulders.
Molly stood as well. “Irene, I can’t believe you’re this thick!  This isn’t about sex!  At least, it isn’t
(See the end of the chapter for
John slid his hand up from Sherlock’s shoulder to his cheek.  “What if I hurt
John looked up at Greg and shrugged.  “Again, why is this a big deal?”
He realised at once that it had not been on purpose.  At least not consciously.  And now he’d gone and practically confessed to them.
One evening after rugby training, John headed over to the lab to meet Sherlock, annoyed that his head was filled with images supplied by the crude banter as they were changing into their street clothes.  Dimmock was complaining that he hadn’t been laid in forever, and wishing that Sherlock would give him another go.  Another guy, Pete, said he’d only want to hook up with Sherlock again if he bottomed.  “An arse like that was made for pounding, dunno why he won’t budge about switching.”  The conversation got even more explicit after that, it was bloody irritating.
John gave him a quizzical look.  “What do they usually say?”
On one particularly frustrating evening, John was at the lab much later than usual trying to figure out one particularly stubborn solution that wouldn’t mix like it was supposed to.  He felt a bit like Neville in Snape’s class.
John huffed out a sigh of relief.  “Sherlock..”  He circled his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and buried his face in his neck.  Sherlock’s arms went around his back, drawing him even closer.  “I love you so much, Sherlock.”
John tilted his head back to look up at Sherlock, and was met with a kiss.  “Will you stay here with me, tonight?”
know about that? Did Molly tell you?”
to come and see the infamous John Watson in person.”
Irene gave Molly an incredulous look.  “I did not!  I said that I simply
Irene tipped her head back and laughed.  “Oh John, John, John.  I’m afraid that Sherlock has made me swear to stop spouting off about his sex life.  But if I were you, I’d start being a little more observant.”
Sherlock moved off him, and John whimpered at the loss of contact.  Sherlock gently turned John over so that he was on his back, and then his body was pressing into him again.  “John,” he groaned as he lowered his head for a kiss.  John wound his arms around Sherlock’s neck as they kissed and kissed.  Sherlock’s hands roamed up and down John’s torso, detouring occasionally to reach down to massage his arse.
John huffed out an embarrassed laugh as every one of his mates whipped their heads around to stare.  “Oh come on, why is this a big deal?”  Bill raised his eyebrows, waiting for an answer.  “Ugh, fine. Yes, okay.”  He wrinkled his nose and felt his face grow hot as everyone clapped and whooped.  Other party guests looked over in bemusement.  John didn’t see Sherlock.
Greg’s head whipped back around, and Dimmock blurted, “Don’t be absurd!”
.  John sucked in a breath.  He’d done such a good job burying that painful memory, that when Sherlock came back from the dead he hadn’t thought about it at all.  Of course, part of that was due to the fact that he’d been so angry at Sherlock for what he did, and the fact that he just got engaged.
John gave him a soft smile and leaned in to kiss Sherlock over and over.  Sliding his fingers through his silky curls, tugging and scraping lightly with his nails.  Sherlock melted into him and John felt a little thrilled that Sherlock wasn’t behaving like the Casanova his teammates hinted at.  After a time John reluctantly pulled back, and then he took ahold of Sherlock’s hand.  “We’re gonna use yours because it’s bigger.”  He licked a stripe up Sherlock’s palm, repeating it a couple more times, and then lowered it to where their two cocks were resting against each other.
John bit his lip.  “D’you mind my asking?  I feel like I’m missing something obvious.  From what I’ve been told, bottoming is supposed to feel really good.”  He didn’t add that the idea of it appealed to him a lot.
John squeezed his eyes shut, actively willing the stinging sensation of tears to cease.  “Please, Molly.  I can’t…don’t you think I
John nodded.  “Right, that’s primary attraction.  It’s based on whatever physical characteristics appeal to you.  Now, after you got to know Molly, started falling for her, would you say that your attraction to her increased?”
John had just poured himself a scotch and water when he felt an arm wrap around his shoulders.  It was Greg, and he was steering John towards a small gathering of the rugby lads in one corner of the sitting room.  When they arrived, Greg unceremoniously pushed him down into a chair between Bill and Dimmock.  “I just heard from Sally that you and Sherlock finally stopped dancing around each other and did the deed.”
John stared at him in amazement.  All the pieces fell together.  Sherlock had been going through the same torture that he has this whole time.  And judging by the anguished look on his face, Sherlock clearly thought he’d just ruined things between them by voicing it aloud.  John didn’t care anymore if his heart ended up broken, he couldn’t deny either of them a moment longer.
When it was tea time, John revealed what it was he’d been working on: lavender and honey tea cakes.  Sherlock could tell he’d been trying to recreate the ones from the tea room that they discovered a decade ago while working a triple murder in Bexley.  It was quite far to go for tea cakes, but they made the trip every so often because Sherlock loved them.  “I called the shop and begged them for the recipe.”
John took a deep breath to try and compose himself.  “So uh…that was the errand you had to run earlier?”  Sherlock nodded.  “Thank Christ you didn’t take me. I dunno if I could have handled going into that shop.”
John wrinkled his nose.  “Yeah, I suppose.  Something I read once that really resonated with me, it was a theory about primary and secondary attraction.  When you met Molly, you were attracted to her right away, yeah?”
“Ah Christ, John, why’d you have to go and do that?”  John looked up at Greg in surprise.  Unlike the others, he looked disappointed.  John would have thought if anyone was going to look like that it would be Dimmock.  John glanced over, and he seemed envious but not really bothered.
He started to sit up, but Sherlock pushed him back down.  “Don’t be absurd, John.  I’m the top, it’s my responsibility.”
happening.
Irene’s smile was catlike.  “Especially since he’s the only one we know who
Sherlock chuckled, his expression rueful.  “I was, actually.  I was intending to pull
John forced himself to crawl out of bed to go brush his teeth and piss.  He rummaged and found a spare toothbrush and set it out for Sherlock.  When he came back into the room, Sherlock was climbing out of bed.  John gave him a quick kiss on the forehead before taking his place in bed as Sherlock took his turn in the bathroom.
.  And it was something that Sherlock wanted, to John’s amazement.  Enough to get some mysterious and kinky object for future use.  John imagined the idea of them fucking so often that he would be ready for whatever
John chuckled.  “I appreciate it.  But I mean, I’m naked in front of my teammates all the time.”
Sherlock jerked his head to look at John.  “What if I hurt you?”
The second part of the scene was the one John dreaded the most.  In it, Sherlock will slowly rise from the bench until he’s towering over John, his chest ‘heaving with desire’ as directed by Irene.  John’s response will be to grab a fistful of Sherlock’s shirt and tug, indicating he wants Sherlock to kiss him.  His expression triumphant, Sherlock will lower his head slowly.  Meanwhile, he’ll reach down to grab the towel and fling it to cover the camera.
John wheezed with laughter as Molly clenched her teeth.  “Stop.  Talking.”
feel good.  They just want me to fuck them.”  He winced, as if realising for the first time how messed up that was.  Because it absolutely was.  John had the terrible feeling that the same arsehole who told Sherlock he was only good for fucking also taught him that sex was only about reciprocation.
Sherlock stared at him, and his eyes were shining.  John realised he was on the verge of tears.  “That’s exactly it, John.”  He leaned down and captured John’s lips in a kiss that was both tender and passionate.  John felt Sherlock’s cock shift and then it was right there at the entrance to his body.  And then it was
Eventually Sherlock abandoned his worship of John’s arse.  He brought his hand around to the front and reached in to grasp John’s cock, pulling it out and stroking it. John felt the air punch out of his lungs.  Sherlock chuckled darkly in his ear.  “Yes, it’s very different from touching yourself, isn’t it?  It’s that novel feeling of having no idea what I’m going to do next, of being literally in the palm of my hand.”  He gave a twist of his fingers and John clutched at his shoulders.  “Oh John, the way you respond to me.”
Molly came bounding over at that moment.  “John!”  He pulled her into a bear hug and congratulated her on her performance.  She smiled and pressed her daisies into her face to inhale the scent.  “We’ve decided to all go out to Angelo’s to celebrate.  Are you two coming?”
“Not gay.” Sherlock ground the words out.  “You’re not gay, as you’ve made so clear to all and sundry for years now. So why are you tormenting me with this?  I thought we were past your desire to punish me for faking my death.”
“Mmm.  Night, love.”
Sherlock nodded jerkily.  “I had the pants laid out next to me, so that when I came it would go all over the pants.  It made the orgasm more intense.”
was the one who led me to think that.  We’ve had the relationship talk and everything.”
John didn’t know much about dancing, but he could tell what she meant.  The one woman and three other men – none of whom he recognised – all seemed a bit too stiff in their dancing, a bit too adherent to technical form.  From what John had seen on Instagram, Sherlock was very technically proficient, but he also had something they lacked – a fluidity of movement, grace, and passion.
John felt like he was on fire. Sherlock shifted down slightly so he could press kisses down John’s jaw, then neck, then across his clavicle.  Sherlock’s lips felt like flames licking at his skin.  When he reached John’s nipple, his tongue was a hot brand.  The scraping of his teeth was as a match being struck.  Soon John was feeling so sensitised that the fabric of their pants became an irritant on his skin.
.  So not drugs?
He refrained from pointing out that they were in a section of the shop that catered to gay couples.  He was trying very hard not to look at any of the items on the shelves, as he was already having a hard enough time avoiding pervy thoughts about his madman flatmate without the items on display giving him ideas to work with.  To shut her up and get out of the shop, John had agreed to a pair of red pants.  Once he got home, he shoved them in the far corner of his underwear drawer and completely forgot about them.
John eased his hand away from Sherlock’s cock for fear of making it oversensitised.  He switched over to his own cock and absently stroked it as he watched Sherlock come down from his orgasm, marvelling at how beautiful he was.  Sherlock’s brow furrowed and he looked down, his eyes widening as he saw John was still erect and straining.  He shook his head as if he was personally offended, but before John could wonder why, he found himself being gingerly pushed until he was lying back on the bench.  Sherlock then scooted down until his face was level with John’s cock.  He looked up at John and smiled slyly, then without warning he took it into his mouth, all the way down to the hilt.
…that’s not what I mean at all.  I just meant that Irene planted the seed.  I liked the idea of doing this for you.  You’re extremely talented, you deserve your own bouquet.  I even customised it for you.”
want the friendship as well as sex.  But I want even more than that.  I want…”  John felt a flush of heat travel up his neck.  “I want to take you out for a romantic dinner and then make you a fry up the next morning. I want to cuddle as we watch Bond movies.  Get a victory kiss from you after my matches. And speaking of rugby, I want to be able to tell the other blokes on the team that whatever they did with you in the past is
John took a long, deep breath.  “No.  Of course not.  I’m saying that my feelings don’t matter. Or at least, they
himself, was what he’d imagined he would do if that miracle were to happen.  A second chance to tell Sherlock how he felt.  Find out once and for all whether Sherlock was just scratching an itch or if he had wanted more from John.
It was John’s turn to flush red.  “Molly!!”
John chuckled.  “It’s expected, Sherlock. I think Molly would kick me out of the flat if I didn’t give her cute Instagram stories to gush over.”
They both laughed, but something about it didn’t sit right with John.  Sherlock’s flippancy seemed forced.  John gave him an assessing look.  “As brilliant as that was, you have to admit it’s a bit not good for you to expose other people’s secrets without reciprocating.”
John groaned.  “I did not need to know that about those two.”
John put his hand over Sherlock’s to still it.  “Please, I don’t want this to be over yet.  I need you inside me,” he gasped, and Sherlock shuddered as if feeling the words ripple through his whole body.
But now John was in London, too, and hoping that he could rely on Molly’s friendship to ease the way as he started all over again at a new university.  If they’ve both changed more significantly than their social media banter indicated, it might not go that smoothly.  Especially since they were about to share a flat.  Molly had been looking for someone since her flatmate left to move in with her boyfriend, so the timing was perfect.
Sherlock gathered the equipment and John went to get ingredients.  As they were setting up, Sherlock gave him a calculating look.  “What’s with you, today?”
Sherlock raised one eyebrow and then leaned in to brush his lips against John’s ear as he murmured, “Lead the way.
“Because in your mind I was on top of you.”  John’s own breathing was becoming ragged.
It was an embarrassing memory.  Back when he was dating the one with the spots (and bloody hell he couldn’t even remember her name at the moment) she had dragged him into a sex shop with the idea of spicing things up in the bedroom.  She’d fallen immediately in love with display of brightly colored men’s underwear that lined one wall.  She said that it was a nice change of pace from walls full of lingerie, and it was about time that men started wearing sexy knickers for their women.
Sherlock snorted and came over.  “He’s a brilliant chemist and a shite teacher.”  He pointed to the ingredient list.  “That should go before that, and you have to stir it at this point.”
Sparing Molly only the briefest of glances, John stalked over to grab his jacket and then headed out the door before anyone could say another word.  What a nightmare.  He would have honestly preferred fending off the usual advances, because most of the time everyone else at the party was oblivious.  In this case, he wasn’t even propositioned, but now the whole fucking team was going to know what went down and have questions about it.
Sherlock made a noise somewhere between a groan and a growl, and the next thing John knew, their positions were reversed and John was now the one up against the lockers.  John gasped and Sherlock bent his head to claim his open mouth.  John felt dizzy from relief and triumph, and soon felt like he was losing his mind as Sherlock’s tongue stroked against his own again and again.  He never knew kissing could be like this, so filthy and all-consuming.
John slowly came awake, yawning so hard it felt like his face was cracking open.  He felt exhausted.  He didn’t get a very restful night’s sleep.  He kept waking up startled that someone was in the bed with him.  Whenever his foggy brain figured out it was Sherlock, it would give him an adrenaline kick recalling the night before and it was a while before he could get back to sleep.
John smiled softly.  “She did stir the pot.  She made us do that bloody video together.”
Bill slung his arm around John.  “I don’t get it.  Usually with new guys he’s like a fox in a hen house.  D’you think maybe he thought you were straight?  He’s never got it wrong before.  Not even with Dimmock, who kept insisting to everyone at the party that he was straight.  But Sherlock had him arse up by the end of the night, begging for it.  At least, that’s what Dimmock said the next day.  Confessed he’d been in the closet for years.”
He turned to his teammates.  “Alright you lot, let’s get this sewn up.  First match of the season, and first match for me at Knight’s. Don’t embarrass me, yeah?”
