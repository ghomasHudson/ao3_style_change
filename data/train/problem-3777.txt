"Fine, we'll spend Christmas
"What angel? Becky you know that angels are not to be trusted..."
"I'm on the 90, just past Chamberlain, Cas." Sam said and hung up the phone just as the angel appeared in the passenger seat. At times, Sam wondered if it wouldn't be better just to ask Cas to erase the enochian sigils from his ribs so Cas could find him easily, but  somehow, it never seemed a good moment to ask.
“Glad to see you all too,” Dean greeted them, shaking his head. But Sam noticed that he was still holding Castiel’s hand. Apparently, they had finally gotten their head out of their butts. Hopefully, it would mean less awkwardness at hunts, not more. He was tired of being the third wheel when his brother wasn’t aware that he was dating his equally oblivious boyfriend. “Sam? Where are the angels and reapers?”
Except it got worse. One figure, this one all dressed in the same manner, but in complete white with gold accents, started walking forward. Power shone from this figure, and the Empty knew it wasn’t human. It was a New Angel, one that wasn’t in the list that annoying light called Chuck had given them.
*             *             *
His voice sounded hoarse, and he spat a bit of blood. Yeah, that was a huge sign that he should be dead. Dean took a deep breath despite the pain, and cringed. He had been dead enough times to know this was not a wound you walked away from. And still, he was still alive.
And yet, no one could find Dean.
Sam could've kicked himself as soon as the words left his mouth. He used to be much better at interrogating people, before Dean died the first time. But after that, he had just stopped caring.  Oh, he still could do it, but not when he was worried about something else. And this time? He cared far more about what the hell was wrong with Dean that about three guys who had died from obvious witchcraft.
“Hey, that’s not true,” Dean spoke as if he knew what Castiel was thinking, which was possible considering that Dean seemed to be an angel now. But before Castiel could ask what was going on a different voice cut through the cheers.
had to have seen something.
"Any  connection between the three victims?" he asked the Forensic officer on duty. Behind him Sam and Castiel were examining Gray's body. While the stupid angel still hadn't perfected the art of pretending to be an FBI officer,  Bobby couldn't deny that he could see things a human couldn't.
So you know what happened to the three officers you are accusing? Someone killed them," Sam pressed, as soon as Bobby translated what Dean had said. "That's what we're here to investigate and we'd appreciate if you..."
For one second, Sam was tempted to tell her everything. She already knew what he and Dean did, she had faced a changeling using the face of her son trying to kill her. But then he saw her house. Her perfect house, where no demon, vampire, werewolf or ghost had ever stepped in and he couldn't bring himself to tell her. He told himself that Dean would never forgive him if he brought the horrors of their lives to Lisa's doorstep.
“We will,” Dean Winchester said, smirking at them as the humans kept singing behind the portal. Trumpets had been added now, and the song grow louder even without Dean’s voice leading it. “When you give me what I want.”
At the very least, Dean  had the right to be the first one to yell at him  for being an idiot.
“Morning, Sunshine,” Dean said, and since he had always been better at actions than at words, at least when Cas was concerned, he closed the distance between them in a kiss, at the same time that he crossed the Portal out of the empty, and the mariachi finished the song.
“Rowena and Crowley were reviewing the contracts… they claim that since you also were a Knight of Hell, they…”
"Wait, before he disappeared, Dean said that you were the new sheriff in Heaven," Bobby pressed. Behind them Sam had gone silent. The boy was hiding something, of that Bobby was sure. Unfortunately, with all that was happening, he wasn't sure when he would have the time to confront him about it. "Why aren't you putting a stop to it?"
!” The leader of the main band, a fat man with a great talent for the trumpet yelled back. “
For the first time in Eternity, the Shadow knew hope.
On those weeks, Dean  Winchester, now Derringer, made her know anger, and , the first time she had seen him have a seizure  caused by unknown reasons, worry.
“It was the only way to get you out of the Empty,” Dean shrugged, the Mariachi were now starting to disperse, but a couple of them still gave Dean a thumbs up, and one muttered something about “el
(Which was not the case when Anubis also came knocking, since Anubis wasn’t known for having a sense of humor. By then Sam was 70, and both he and Castiel wondered if Dean had just pissed off the whole Egyptian Pantheon because he liked being functionally immortal. Dean swore up and down that it was not the case, it had been the only way to save a young woman from being eaten by a giant crocodile)
“ I have been tasked with making sure Dean isn’t mortally wounded again,” Cas smiled weakly. Dean couldn’t help but chuckle at that. At the least something good was coming out of all this. “So no. I will not be leaving for the foreseeable future.”
"Angels aren't like demons," Samandiriel explained, as if he was talking to very small children. "Not only we need consent, we also need very specific vessels. And no angel would dare to take Michael's vessel as his own, not even temporarily."
"Can that happen?" Now Sam looked... worried. And that confused Dean, because Sam looked as if he was worried about
"As far as I know, they're still on the cage. But about Dean, that's the thing. We don't know," Sam answered quickly. "He wasn't with Bobby, he wasn't with Lisa, and I'm running out of ideas. Can you find him?"
The Shadow closed their eyes, and metaphorically lay down to sleep. There was quiet, there was peace, and now they could sleep.
The problem was that Sam didn't remember how he had remembered he was Sam Winchester. One moment he had destroyed the computers in the tech support floor, handing his resignation and thinking that Smith was a coward for not doing the same, and the next, he was Sam Winchester again.
Three hours and about all the alcohol in the bunker later, Dean was starting to rethink his strategy. He had been hoping Sam would leave them alone to talk, but the Sasquatch was far more interested in knowing exactly why Dean couldn’t just choose Heaven and be done with it –and while Dean did appreciate that at least someone was considering his own wishes on the matter, he still thought it was weird seeing Sam arguing against temporary immortality. Maybe his brother was just jealous that so many afterlives wanted Dean- so beers had come into the equation.
Prayers were often ignored, but once in a while, there was one who called the attention of all the host, by virtue of being interesting enough among the millions of 'please, God, help me/my loved ones'. In that sense, Heaven hadn't changed much, not even after the apocalypse had decimated most of the Garrisons and where there had been once four archangels, now there was only one.
"Not a crossroad demon, feathers." The demon smirked at him. "And it wasn't MY side the one that fucked the plan up. We did everything  we were supposed to do, it was your guys who couldn't make sure that Winchester One followed the plan."
"Becky, what are you doing here?" Sam interrupted her before she could go into a tangent.  He needed to get her out of there, as soon as possible.
Castiel blinked, confused, as Dean broke their kiss and a huge cheer erupted from the hundreds of Mexicans around them as the portal to the Empty closed. He knew he was awake: in the Empty, he was only allowed to dream of things that had happened and he was pretty sure that Dean had never kissed him while dressed as a mariachi and shining with grace more powerful than an Archangel.
"Yes?"
“We can try to find another way! We’ve found many spells in the Men of Letters’ Bunkers, maybe there’s one to allow humans into…” Sam insisted, but Dean was too tired to let him go on. He was itching to get to Cas, and he knew that even if everyone agreed with his plan, even if Jack turned him into an angel right there and then? They still would need to wait, to make sure everything else in his plan was ready.
However, before Sam could assess the threat and if the angel was going to be openly hostile like the last one they had encountered, Castiel appeared in front of them.  Sam barely had time to register that Dean was not surprised anymore to see the angel appear before Cas pulled out his angel sword and tried to ram Dean's 'brother' to a wall.
"We found Dean," Sam interrupted. While a weapon of Heaven on Earth sounded like bad news, he was far more interested in his brother. After they figured out what was wrong with Dean, then they could worry about the dick angels and whatever they were doing.
"The agreement between Heaven and Hell is not finished, demon. The Apocalypse didn't happen, so the contract is still valid."
” knowing how to sing.
Hell.
Which meant that now he had to resort to the same tactics as Zachariah.
Trying to keep his hands to himself, he focused on the older agent, the only one who seemed to understand ASL, while also keeping a vigilant eye on the other one, the one who had hugged him, just in case. He tried not to be paranoid, but he still had a scar on his arm from the last time that he had  not trusted his gut.
"Are we sure of that?" Sam shook his head. "I mean,
Even more damned, since he still hadn't had the time to get his soul back from Crowley, since no one wanted the demon near the information that Dean was missing.
Once Sam and Castiel had explained about the blind spot, he had agreed to go with them as backup.  While he also thought that whatever that was powerful enough to  block an angel's memory was perhaps a bit above their abilities, there was no way in hell that he was going to let Sam go there alone. At first, he had been sending Sam on easy hunts in order to distract him a bit from the fact that none of them seemed to be able to find his brother, but he'd be damned if they managed to lose Sam in the process.
"That was an angel speaking," Castiel said, just before he disappeared from the back seat, making Sam curse.  Obviously, they were not going to be able to escape Raphael that easily.
For the way they talked about plagues, heaven and Moses, he would peg them as religous fanatics, even if they didn't look the part.  But one thing was sure for him: Whoever they were, they cared more about the dead cops than about the lives said cops had destroyed. And they might know what was really going on.
“And while you do that, Cas is suffering,” Dean shook his head. “I’m doing this, and if you don’t agree, you can wait until we come back or make your bags and go to Eileen. But you’re not stopping me.”
And Dean, amnesic or not, had noticed.
“And you’re an angel now?” Castiel squinted, confused.
“Nice duds, brother. Did they come with the upgrade Sam said you got?” Benny LaFitte grinned, as he took a swig of a beer. The vampire hadn’t been too keen on returning to Earth at first, but Sam had apologized for his actions before, and swore they could make him human again so he had finally agreed. Sam wasn’t sure they could do what he promised, but he guessed that between the Men of Letter’s library, Rowena’s sources and Jack’s powers, something could be done.
“Oberon?” Sam asked, as Dean shook his head. It had been a long time ago, when Sam had lost his soul, and he really didn’t want to revisit those memories. Sure, Sam’s soul was now firmly stuck to his body and there were no signs of damage after Cas had healed him, but Dean really didn’t want to chance anything. Not again.
"Why not?" Sam asked, at the same time as Castiel did. And, unless Castiel was mistaken, Samandiriel looked even more guilty.
As they approached Lisa's house, Sam started to feel nervous.
Not that Sam couldn't guess that Dean was completely against the possibility of torturing a kid to get an answer. Sam agreed in principle, not only because it was an innocent kid who had made a shitty choice, but because he didn't want to think about the fact that it opened an option to figure out if Dean had also made a deal to get him out of hell.
“Only Demons, Angels and horsemen,” Jack said sadly. “And I don’t think anyone will volunteer to help since…”
“Yeah, but I love…” Sam stopped himself at the middle of the sentence, as if he was finally figuring things out. He looked at Dean, who simply shrugged and looked away. He knew what Sam was thinking, but Dean wasn’t ready to confirm his brother’s suspicions. Not because he didn’t love Cas, but because he wanted his angel to be the first one to hear him say the words.
After another bout of tossing and turning, and wishing themselves a glass of warm milk, and counting even more sheep to the point that parts of the inky Empty were starting to look like actual sheep, the Shadow remembered the box the Angel had given them.
“Ok. I get it,” Sam finally said, shaking his head. It didn’t seem as if he was very convinced, but at least he was no longer yelling at Dean. “So… what do I do in this plan of yours while you go and fly into the Empty?”
“Dean, no, that’s the worst plan possible!” Sam protested, as Jack looked at Dean, tilting his head in confusion.
"He said that you and Dean were changing fate. That put him in a bad mood for days, you know? Because he would get two or three visions of the same thing, just a bit different. Like that thing with the cannibals and Famine? I think he wrote four versions of that one. You were very brave in all of them, trying to fight your addiction to the demon blood. I was very proud of you Sam. Except that when you didn't drink the demon's blood, then you couldn't fight Famine and then Castiel would've eaten..." Suddenly, Becky looked at him, biting her lip. Sam knew he didn't want to know the rest of that sentence. He had lived through the nightmare that was a town possessed by Famine, he didn't want to know what would've happened if they failed to stop the Horseman. "Where's Dean?"
*          *          *
"We have a car, we can follow you," Bobby answered to the question that Sam didn't understood. It was starting to get in his nerves, not to hear half of the conversation. Not to mention that he still was reeling from the fact that this was Dean, his brother DEAN, treating him like a hostile stranger. Things weren't adding up and he needed to talk to Bobby and Cas as soon as he was sure Dean couldn't hear them.
But he couldn’t be awake. The Shadow had been very clear on their deal: No take backs. No return. And Castiel knew very well that Dean could never love him so…
“Don’t I get a say on this?” Dean finally asked, reeling over the implications of what Cas was saying. He was grateful he was alive, but at the same time, he was not worth a cosmic war.
“We sure did, Cas,” Dean smiled at him. “But we couldn’t have done it without you so…”
“And then you will leave me to sleep?”
Oh, yes. Dean thought. That was worth getting almost killed by a stupid rebar.
Sam grimaced. Remembering the months without Dean was a sure way to make himself question why the hell they were trusting the Archangel. But it made sense that there was something magic keeping them from finding his brother. With all the resources they had
"It doesn't feel like that," both Samandiriel and Castiel answered at the same time. Castiel glared at Samandiriel who just stared back, not intimidated. How the kid had managed to pretend he was human long enough to fool Dean, even an amnesic Dean, Bobby didn't know.
(See the end of the chapter for
Eileen had died a few months earlier, and she was the first one to meet him in the new heaven, before Jack begged him to become Heaven’s representative in the ongoing talks about Dean’s final rest.
"How can we find him?" Sam asked, at the same time Dean signed something.
*             *             *
"What do you have for me, Ellen?" He asked as he answered his phone. He was thinking about not going back to Bobby's but just driving, finding himself a crossroads and then finding any demon who was willing to talk to a Winchester just to find his brother. So far, that plan had been nixed by everyone as no one really knew what was going on in Hell, and no one wanted to alert some of the bigger threats that Dean was missing. But Sam was starting to lose hope, starting to feel like he had in those months that hadn't happened, after Dean had died for the 101st  time.
"So, who else had any motive to kill those officers?" Sam asked, subdued. Apparently, he hadn't liked that Dean was afraid of him. "You know?"
"But you have to! He said you would!" Becky insisted, pulling him into the house. Now that was more like the Becky he remembered. Inside, the house was both better and worse than the last time Sam had been there, when Dean had been frantic to find Cas just to hear that Cas had been blown apart by an archangel. It looked as if someone had actually cleaned and organized the place... and then gone insane and turned everything upside down again.  "Right before he disappeared, he  told me that if anything happened to him, I was to come here and wait for YOU."
“That’s what they want, uh?” Dean chuckled. “Then I have a plan. How good is your Spanish, kid?”
Dean touched it gingerly, and could’ve sworn he felt a small tingle from it on his fingers.
"I had a weekend off," Singer answered, looking at Dean as if he had been expecting that question.  But before Dean could really think about that, the older man turned to the angel and thus, couldn't see Dean's hands anymore. "What did you mean when you said that Dean had angelic energy around him?"
(The fact that later Uriel had been revealed as the assassin had made the pain even worse. It was the first moment when Castiel thought about going against his orders, because he couldn't understand how following their Father's will could bring so much destruction to his brothers)
In the time that it had took them to reach Easter,  two  more deaths had occurred. Besides Hatch, the man who liquefied, there was Officer Tobias Gray. This man had ended up covered in boils, from head to toe, outside and
The brothers kept hunting, but after another close call, Sam decided to call it quits. He wanted to marry Eileen and have a family, and since he wasn’t wanted by every afterlife and their cousin, he was not going to risk it. Dean, who had also been a bit more careful, quite aware that Cas couldn’t let him know WHO was winning the arguments in the negotiation, was his Best Man at the wedding, and later, the first client when Sam and Eileen opened a new Roadhouse bar, for all the hunters to have a good network, so that no one would be left out of the loop ever again.
Dean shook his head, that was not good enough for him. In fact, it sounded once again as if Cas was giving up just because he thought it'd make Dean happy. And that was not a good way for this Christmas. Or for their relationship. Dean hated that Cas gave up so easily when it was something that was obviously important to him.
*             *             *
"We're not discussing that right now," Bobby interrupted them, stopping the car behind Dean's Riviera. "Not a word about angels, or the apocalypse. We need to figure out what killed those cops, and then what exactly happened to Dean. But we're not going to have the chance to do that if he is convinced we're a bunch of psychos."
"Raphael plans to free our brothers," Castiel said for the benefit of the mortals. That was why heaven was divided now. Samandiriel had thought once that it was all Castiel's fault. Castiel, and Anna, the two angels that had insisted that Father didn't want Paradise on Earth just yet. Now, he wasn't all that sure. "He must assume that with a fake set of memories, Dean would've more agreeable to accept Michael."
"Colfax was Gray's partner until Jerry got promoted, two months ago," the forensic officer told him, shrugging. "Since then, the only place they saw each other was at the Wiener Hut  in Hepburn St."
"We sort of found Dean," Bobby corrected. Which was, Sam guessed, sort of true. They had found Dean's body, he wasn't so sure about Dean's mind. "He didn't recognize us."
"Hello, Charoun," Castiel greeted, as soon as he saw his brother's vessel materialize. Charon's vessel was shorter but bulkier than Jimmy, and was dressed in the same fashion as all  Castiel's brother preferred, what Dean had once called the 'Angels in Black' look. He didn't look threatening, but as Castiel still didn't know how many of his brothers and sisters had decided to side with Raphael and how many had realized that their Father wanted them to learn to love humanity, rather than follow orders just because.
*             *             *
He signed to "agent" Cash, just to do something. He had sent Aaron to his house,  convinced that the kid wouldn't be making deals with his soul ever again, and now there was nothing to do but wait.
"Dean is hidden  from all angels," Castiel explained. "But I hoped that perhaps you knew another way to find him."
Finding the specific angel who was poaching in Crowley's territory had been a bit harder.  Aaron insisted that he didn't know who the Angel was. Offered to describe him, but given the way in which Angels changed vessels, that meant nothing to them.
“The Empty won’t let Castiel go without a fight,” Jack shook his head. “And humans can’t go into it. Nor can I, or I would break the balance. Aunt Amara says…”
(See the end of the chapter for
that he was also checking with his pagan friends.
"He's a prophet who thought his dreams about Dean and me were just his imagination and decided to write our lives into very shitty novels,"  Sam explained, trying to find consolation in the knowledge that at the very least, he had stopped writing before they freed Lucifer, and that the existent books were out of print and forgotten in one dollar bins. After all, he had put an end to Becky and Chuck's plans to publish the following books himself.
"This is getting us nowhere," Bobby interrupted. "If you and Sam are sure that Dean is not dead, then he's not dead. I'm sure we would've heard something in the news if he had died during a hunt because no matter what the FBI believes, yet another 'Dean Winchester' body showing up would've made it to the papers after last time. So the question is, how the hell are we going to find him?"
"Sam? You still there?" Ellen sounded pissed, so Sam guessed he had missed something important she had said.
And he was curious.
Grant was not going to let an investigation put all his pension on hold just because an idiot mute mechanic with nothing but a GDA to his name had a chip on his shoulder. He was going to get rid of Derringer, and then wait for whatever God had decided as his punishment.
"So what did your idjit brother do and where is he?" Bobby asked, as he handed Sam a towel to dry himself after the impromptu bath of holy water.
"There are angels in this town," Cas announced,  as he appeared on the back of Bobby's car, surprising Sam. "I'm afraid there might be a Weapon of Heaven here. Probably the Staff of Moses, although that wouldn't account for the small scope of the effects."
"What the hell did you do to him?!" Sam and Bobby yelled, bringing up their useless guns. Castiel couldn't blame them for being angry, but until he figured out what was Samandiriel's angle, they were running the risk of hurting Dean, so he moved slightly, just enough so he could block any bullet fired. "Why did you put him to sleep?"
Kutiel raised his sword, and was surprised when the human, instead of remain frozen with fear, actually tried to defend himself, hitting him.  What was even more surprising was that Kutiel actually feel the punch. It wasn't painful, it was barely noticeable, but the fact that this mud monkey had been able to make him
"I'm confused, if you found Dean, why is he not with you?" Sam knew that Cas was not judging them for not having Dean with them, but it sounded close to it to Sam. And that made him angry at the angel. Because HE couldn't have protected Dean since was in hell, and Dean would never let Bobby protect him. But Cas? He was the one who promised Sam he would protect Dean. He was the incredibly powerful angel. He shouldn't have left Dean alone.
One of the old angels was reacting to the voice. Not just “one” but “THE” one. The one that had taught the Shadow what it meant to be annoyed, to feel like control was slipping out of their hands and made history by being the first being the Shadow had wanted OUT, away from their realm and to never come back.
"Well, I didn't brought you back, boy, even if I'm happy to see you again. And the only other person I can think off who would know what happen to you is Dean."
“I can find him,” Dean said, with absolute confidence. “If you don’t mind me singing a bit more.”
"Look, Cassie, don't. Even before I decided to run away and give myself a holiday, I could tell that you didn't approve of Zachariah's plan for the Righteous Man. So if you weren't here, and
"Then what is this?" Bobby waved around, starting to lose his patience. It was a common thing when he had to deal with Angels and their mysterious ways. At least monsters tended to be very straight forward with their plans: They usually just wanted to eat or kill you.
To Sam’s surprise, Dean smiled.
He could have what he had always wanted, if only he had asked before making his own dumb deal to save Jack.
Aaron Birch had made a deal with an angel to avenge his brother. Sam could completely understand the kid, because at the moment he was ready to make a deal with whoever gave him Dean back as he was before his trip to hell.
Sam closed his eyes and let the blackness wash over his face. His heartbeat rapidly in his chest. As a butterfly ready to take flight.
"Cas, are we good?" He moved his hand in his direction. Dean stopped once he realized Castiel had flinched in displeasure.
Sam and Dean exchanged a short glance, Castiel felt a whole conversation passed through them but he wasn't able to understand it. "Cas, why don't you help with the baggage? Dean will fix up the room for us," Sam said, a small apologizing smile on his lips. He nodded and went out with Dean's little brother. Lucky for them, Camilla had been the only person packing enough for two people. He used great effort to move the baggage to the entrance of the hotel.
"I—I need to think about it," Sam stuttered. He needed time. Sure, the position came with powers but that was the least he worried about. He knew from research he risked to lose himself, maybe forever. Sam's soul would die and be replaced by a dead one. There will also be no chance to get back, as who he was.
"We keeping meeting here, the fate must really like you," Dean continued as he nodded towards the bartender and took his beer glass.
"Getting sentimental, aren't we?" Michelle scoffed. "You are aware you won't talk to your brother ever again? The Mark of Cain is going to force you to live forever. And who saved your ass back at the battle?"
Sam rolled his eyes. "Yeah, Bobby lives here. He will help you restart your memory lane."
"It's written all over your face," Balthazar circled his finger around his features. He sat back into the chair. Balthazar's poker face made it unreadable for Sam to understand what got through the bodyguard's head. Balthazar smiled.
As always the same colored trenchcoat, black suit, and dark brown ruffled hair. The dimples of his smile brought happiness to his life like no other. Cas's eyes were in a darker shade of sea blue eyes, Dean had grown fond of it. Each step moved both of them closer to one another. Dean's arms were driven to touch Cas's shoulder blades when Dean's eyes grew wide in surprise when Cas handheld into his neck. The proximity grew closer. A flash of light. Suddenly he felt rough lips against his own. Dean froze in utter shock.
Castiel's jaw tightened. His experiences in love were few and far between, he preferred to think about nature instead. His heart had been broken too many times already."Thank you for your help," Castiel said politely.
"Right, what about the time you went dressed as Batman during the prom and fell straight into a plate full of food? Or the time you kissed the-"
"No shit Sherlock," Dean found pieces of apple to put on it before he took on the rest.
Dean leaned into his ear as he whispered "
"Don't you remember being a rockstar?" Sam stopped for a moment before he continued. His lips pressed into a thin line. "Or what happened to our parents?"
"I can't tell you everything," Cas's penetrating voice shattered his rumbled thoughts. "We barely know each other, I-I...is personal." He turned to walk away, Dean's hand gripped Cas's shoulder on his own record and forced Cas's body towards him again.
. "I met Dean by pure accident, we talked, did things—"
"I will figure something out," Sam said in a lowered voice. "Crowley and Lucifer play on our side so don't kill them off. I am not sure which archangels we need off the board. There are too many of them right now," Sam said. His fist clenched and Castiel withdrew from his position and nodded.
Castiel knew he had a little time of life left. He was ready to move on into peace even ready to wait for Dean if he needed to do so. Outside his room, there was some men and woman that patrolled the corridors, he could see them from where he laid.
He fidgets on his pants, Castiel caught the glance to Dean's girlfriend and his stomach churned in discomfort. The way Dean had been on stage earlier still managed to make him breathless every time he thought back. And
Castiel frowned. He rubbed his backhead and found attention towards the couple kissing a few feet away from them. Castiel sighed. Him? Of all people, Dean didn't know who he was anymore. Not even his brother he cared dearly about. It hurt more than he was willing to say. Common sense helped him no less.
When he got close enough he almost had to cover his ear from the squealing. "Hey, waiting for someone?" Dean smiled wide. The reaction was that the girls started pointing at him and asking for autographs. He got a pen from one of the girls and began to sign off autographs. Suddenly he heard the car horn.
The situation changed just as he predicted. Sam straightened up and didn't meet his eyes. Bobby rolled his eyes and turned to answer him. "Three pieces are left in the fridge."
When the blood started to drip into his hands, Dean lowered himself to the ground. "You got me," Dean said. His eyes twinkled with amusement. Raphael's anger made the light turn off by his sheer force alone. Using one hand, he made two signs, one to banish the angels and another that kept only him there.
*             *             *
He didn't want to imagine his little brother going against something like the angel he had faced at the police station.
Yes, the Empty was just a black void, with no distinguishing features, not even a way to know where was the floor and where was the sky. The only direction Dean had at the moment was the portal that Jack kept open. But it didn’t matter. He knew his heart would guide him to where Castiel slept, and his voice would wake his angel up. And so, he started to sing.
His cellphone vibrated, signaling an incoming message and Dean  sighed before checking it. It seemed that his brother had finally remembered that he was supposed to tell Dean that he had left his job early.
And, armed with courage as Castiel was not flying away, Dean finally closed the distance between them and locked their lips into a passionate kiss.
*          *          *
"So... why don't we all go to Cas's family home?"
"I thought you were going to teach us how to be hunters," Alfie asked, and Dean would've groaned if he had been able too. It was very obvious that his little brother wanted to change the subject. "How can we learn here?"
, not about what could happen to them if there were other side effects. That made no sense. Besides, Dean felt fine. Of course, the voice thing had been a surprise, but  Dean could avoid that. After all, he hadn't been able to talk since he was 4 years old.
When Castiel had said goodbye to Dean Winchester, he had let Dean believe he was now 'heaven's sheriff'.  It had been a lie, and not a very good one at that, but it had served its purpose. Dean had been satisfied that Heaven wouldn't meddle in humanity's business again. It was all Castiel could do to repay all of Dean's sacrifice.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean rasped, touching Cas’s arm before the angel could get out of reach. “You saved me again.”
To Dean, it sounded like a good job. Far more meaningful than his 9 to 7 at the garage. Because he could imagine something like the officer's deaths happening to innocent people. People who didn't deserve to die because a vampire got hungry, or a ghost was still mad about something that happened thousands of years ago.
“That’s the plan, if you’re not working your realm as the Afterlife for angels and demons, we have no reason to bother you,” the new angel frowned, confused. “How does it work, by the way? How can this be the Empty if it’s full of dead angels and demons?”
"Dean? Dean Derringer? You have got  to be kidding. That guy is up for sainthood in this neighborhood!" The girl, Marion according to her name tag, grinned. "That's the thing, see? Dean is a volunteer at the local youth center, and Chris was one of his kids so he was devastated when it happened."
“You should let her out of you,” Dean interrupted again. “She was tricked by Chuck… and given how angry she got after all the time she was locked up, you don’t want to deal with her a millennia down the line.”
! And Ellen and Jo almost died and they were going to die according to Chuck's first version and I don't..."
The Shadow finally…
Kutiel kept himself away from heaven politics. His mission was always clear. He, like Uriel, was to walk the earth when the wrath of God was invoked. Like Raphael, he answered only to a prophet, most specifically, to Moses. Even if the Prophet had been raised to Heaven centuries ago, the staff still had the power to summon him with the sole purpose of killing those who were the first ones in their bloodlines.
Dean Derringer always knew that life wasn't fair.
"Is he? Then why someone has at least ten angels permanently stationed to keep an eye on this human? Without Michael, the vessel is worthless to heaven. And yet... you can feel it around him. He's covered from head to toe in angel grace. Aren't you dying to know why?"
“Dean? You’re still alive?”
“We don’t need to talk about that if it makes you uncomfortable, Dean…” Cas said at the same time as Dean gathered his courage. “I told you, saying it was enough.”
Castiel was finishing a last sweep of the city when he felt a familiar presence near him. Getting his sword ready, he followed the trail to a small park, not that far away from where he had left Sam and Bobby.
"I know," Dean interrupted his thoughts, as if he had read them. "Dad... wants to patch up things with Sam. Mom says that, after his accident, Dad has been rethinking a lot of things."
"But... wait... Dean isn't with you either?"
he signed.
"My brother Charoun threatened me. He made it clear that he was siding with Raphael. And they were keeping something important here in Easter. Something that he is protecting."
He and Cas had a profound bond. Cas was his missing half. And Dean was not going to let him go ever again.
“Shut up!” The Shadow yelled at the new Angel, who was now smiling as he sang. As if he knew who his voice was reaching. And behind him, the humans who were beyond their reach, kept playing and singing along, making the noise louder, stronger.
"His name is Balthazar," Becky hurriedly said. "He's on Chuck's notes, and Chuck says he's one of the good guys. That he's friends with Castiel. Oh! Is Castiel with you? Did he really rebelled against Heaven for Dean? Well, of course he did, because that's what Chuck wrote but.."
"Cas... what do you mean, we're spending Christmas with your parents?" Dean asked again, rough and angry. Even the nickname that Cas had once found annoying sounded like a threat.
*          *          *
No, Sam reconsidered. Not alone. That was probably what Dean was trying to get across, even if his methods were questionable. They all were family, and Jack could be hands off as God… but that didn’t mean he stopped being Jack.
"That was being dealt with, demon," Raphael answered, ignoring the insolence. "The original plan is still  viable, but given the circumstances, it will be necessary for Heaven and Hell to collaborate further."
Hunting things. Protecting People.
Dean signed, foregoing the
“That was ages ago! And I did go to Hell, you got me out, remember? How does that still count?” Dean asked, indignant. If it still counted, he wouldn’t have made it to heaven when he was killed, a year after, would he? Or had Zachariah also done something about that?
Four weeks later,  Sam was starting to lose hope that they would find Dean. It was as if his brother had just disappeared from the face of the earth.
"Maybe it's in the garage?" Sam offered, but even as he said so he knew it was highly unlikely. Dean had a lot of rules regarding the Impala, and rule #1 was that no one backed baby in a garage. She was made for the road."I'll go check."
After that, Dean realized that there were a lot of people praying to him, that he was hearing the prayers, and it took a while for both him and Cas to get used to the idea.
“I promise. In fact,” Dean threw a small box to them. “Here. This helps me when I can’t have my four hours a night.”
“It’s not enough for me,” Dean said, getting up and way too close to Cas. Close enough to kiss if he wanted. And oh, now that he knew he could have Cas, that Cas felt the same way? He wanted. But he needed to clear the air first. “Especially because you never let ME say it. What was it you said after Purgatory? That you knew so I didn’t have to speak up?”
He had dreamed with Dean dressed as a mariachi, yes, but it had been when he had been human and as far as Castiel knew, only Metatron knew about that.
Either that, or he was still in hell because he was certainly being tortured. If this was Lucifer's plan, he couldn't have done better.
“I wouldn’t want you to trip and break your neck,” Cas explained, looking away. “I’ve also cleaned your arteries… again. Please, don’t undo all my hard work.”
Castiel beamed at being called Dean’s husband so brightly, that all supernatural creatures thought Earth had suddenly grown a new sun.
*          *          *
“I dunno, the fact that we’ve gone to Purgatory and escaped before?” Sam pointed out. “You’re that eager to see Zachariah, or worse, Alastair back upstairs?”
question in his head. What did this guys hunt?
The Shadow could feel the Sleeping Angel’s consciousness fighting to wake up as the new Angel stepped into the Portal. Into THEIR realm, smiling and shining as if he wasn’t afraid of the Shadow’s power.
But he hadn't stopped to think, and now his brother was furious at him again and they were out of his apartment, where they could pick any number of clues of what the hell had been wrong with him.
“I know, Sam,” Cas said, squinting a bit. He was angry, Dean could tell, and who could blame the angel. After all, he had sacrificed himself for wasDean, and as a dumbass, Dean had gone and gotten himself killed in just a week or so. If their roles were reversed, Dean would be killing Cas himself. “This is… very inconvenient.”
*             *             *
“You’re right, Dean. I was being foolish. Let’s go home.”
"Because he thinks Sam is a crazy FBI agent who confused him with his long lost brother," Bobby explained, saving Sam the trouble of trying to make the angel understand that probably everything was his fault. "And we still don't know what's going on. You said that there were angels in town?"
"That's why I want to go with them, Dean," Alfie tried to explain. "Sam and Mr. Singer are two of the best hunters in the country. They can teach me how to survive."
Part of their consciousness wanted to blame the angel. To think they had lied, made something to cheat. But they knew it was not the case. The angel had been truthful and took away all the noise. All the annoyances, so that the Shadow could rest.
"The angel said I was in danger at Chuck's house and that I had to find you," Becky explained, sounding  very nervous. As if she was expecting to get yelled at. Not that Sam wasn't thinking about it.
He didn't have to wait for long.
"Guys, calm down," Dean orders the press, they sat back at their places. Some mumbled underneath their breaths while others put their cameras back to their laps. Dean sighed and smiled at him, his dimples apparent on his features. An invisible nod to him that solely he would understand. He took it as his cue to get back on track.
Dean sighed. Castiel tried his best not to become angry about this.
"If you say so..." Crowley said slowly, taking his time to say the words. "The Mark has certain...effects on you. Not that you already aren't different, moose," Crowley said.
Michelle gave him an impressed stare. "You truly are a legend, Sam," she said.
happen," Cas said, his voice turned cold. He showed a sense of strength Sam admired from where he stood. They were getting straight into their trap.
Dean nodded, he sat upon the table as he stretched his arms before he settled down. "Yes, sir," his voice different. Dean turned towards his brother and nodded in acknowledgment. "Is there anything else I should know about?"
He nodded, he sighed frustrated.
," he close to growled close to his ear in the same tone Dean would have used exploded a rage in Sam. "I created you."
"It's worth it when you reach a decent level, the music will move more and inspire people you never knew. Give it a shot," Dean took his fingers away and the sounds abruptly stopped.
Dean shook his head. "No, calm down, will you?" Dean seized the knight of hell. Crimson liquid covered most of his clothes. "Why did you kill them?" He pointed at the dead bodies on the ground. Sam walked over to him but put his Blade in the back of his pants.
?" Dean snapped irritated as he wiped the specks of dust away from his jeans.
"Bobby," Dean said in a pleading voice. "You are the only father I grew up with that took care of me and Sam. You helped dad out with his shop and showed me how to work an instrument," Dean frowned.
No answer. Okay, someone had to show this asshole how to answer. "Castiel, isn't a bad guy, right?" Dean said each word deliberately. He raised his eyebrow. It was becoming hard to breathe, memories crashed inside his head making it hard to focus. Dean blinked to clear his thoughts.
"Who inspired you to be an artist?"
Castiel didn't understand what his friend referred to.
Blood dripped down from his temple onto his shirt. Grogginess hit and Dean flinched as he pressed his eyelids together. His left hand touched the frozen surface behind his back. Dean's green eyes blinked a few times before the scene came into focus. Sam's unseeing eyes clear without no sign of life, made Dean's memories was forced to the forefront of his mind. How Sammy had tried to warn him. Attempted to save his little brother from what looked like air. Thrown at the wall and then he recalled no further...
Castiel caught himself in thinking. A pat on the shoulder crashed him back to earth.
The crowd whispered among themselves, fear in some of them. Castiel smiled slightly, his eyes glint dangerously. "You see, why believe in a man that never shows himself? I do. Therefore I am God."
"Yep," Dean stared confused at the woman.
He played around with a sharp knife in his hand. The lighting echoed strongly in the hallways outside. Surrounded by a metallic device that made the soul scream in agony in his feet, arms, and head. Sam heard the screams clear as a bell. Instead of putting the poor soul for a few hours out of his misery, he sliced the body up. Bit by bit. Until blood-splattered as a fountain, Sam appeared some meters when it happened.
"Whatever, I have a bad feeling about this," Dean answered. They continued to walk through the corridors, yelling Sam's name to the other residences' annoyance. In the end, they stopped to rest by the exit of the hotel. Dean held his head in his hands. Castiel sat beside him with his legs stretched out.
"Okay," Haziel said as he wrapped the paper neatly as he packed it into his jacket pocket. He probably memorized it already.
"Angels don't exist we both know this," Sam didn't look up from the project he worked on consisting of new cover art he had saved to his computer.
"Dean, I don't think you mean that," he studied Dean's face again. his jaw clenched. Yet something in Dean's gaze kept him to his place. Anger, frustration, confusion boiled underneath the surface. Castiel held on tighter, strong enough to leave bruises. A small puff of air escaped Dean's lips.
Castiel felt a bang of disappointment in his chest. He liked Dean's company, the way he was himself with everyone. Castiel craved that. "I look forward to that," he finally managed to say.
. Castiel twitched once he recognized the shape and pressure from Dean's hand on his shoulder.
Micheal nodded, "yes but we had...obstacles to get hold of Castiel. We lost many good soldiers and friends. However, their loss was worth it. I obtained the information he is in hiding but not where he is. I don't know."
After that, they called for a short break. Castiel sat on a chair, he rested his hands against his cheeks. His fear was shown through his constant try to wipe his wet hands on his trenchcoat, his flickering gaze, and biting his under lip. Dean's knee touched his, they shared a short imitate minute by looking into green and blue. "Have you seen Sam?" Dean asked, his voice filled with concern.
"Sorry, Dean."
Cas stared at him for a few moments before a smile appeared on his face. "Stop doing that every time you come here. You will give me a major heart attack." He rubbed his neck before he drank again.
"Dean is just a regular guy that had a normal apple pie life—" the other answered before the rude guy two abrupted the alright dude.
"Help him by being there when he needs you, let him talk out when he feels ready to do it. He might've problems touching people or trusting them since he had a traumatic experience. He has to use the time he needs to get back on his feet," Sam calmly informed Dean. Dean bit his under lip and a flash of guilt passed his eyes. His eyes began to roam the whole room ignoring Sam's presence in front of him.
Cas frowned. "That is not a wise choice in what
"Hey," Dean smiled sheepishly. He moved his hand behind her back and dragged her into a short kiss.
"I know," Dean's voice dropped a few octaves lower. He unclenched and clenched his hands on his lap. "I was curious—" Dean stopped midsentence. He frowned as he stood up although he never lifted a finger in his direction. "I got good news."
Dean turned back to Camilla again. "You are going to have that and much more just not with me. I should have told you before but I didn't know how to tell you. Whatever you chose to do, I will respect that." Dean lifted his hand and touched his bruised cheek.
"All right, I will help you on one condition."
Outside the blackness echoed the feelings battling for domination inside. Dean drove the car for hours, for himself nothing less than a few seconds. Sammy had been gone for eight months.
Dean nodded, "Yes, I thought you were out there blowing demons to hell? Or leading a war?" He moved closer to the other archangel. A slow frown became to take form on his features. Dean glanced at his angel blade before he hid it into his suit again. He lifted his gaze to the archangel.
Haziel had been gone for six hours before he returned to them. Anna's lips were pressed into a thin line by what he told her. Now, Haziel would be the second to hear. Anna crossed her arms over her chest. "You are leaving all of this? Angels everywhere stand by your side and you want to go?" She asked.
. "He needs you just...remember to take of yourself, okay?" he pressed his lips to a tight line, he needed to know this or he could never really bet at peace with himself.
. "Well, ...I think, uh, happy and producing music?" he closed his eyes and prayed nobody saw how embarrassing this was making him. "To make other people rediscover themselves and change people's lives, that's what I would like to be in ten years," Dean opened his eyes and stared directly at the camera.
Castiel's eyes narrowed in surprise before he nodded. "I always found it odd how alike Dean and Raphael fought. Can it have something to do with his incarnation?" Castiel walked closer to him. First, now he noticed Castiel's ruffled hair, his cheeks a tad redder than usual. The guy definitely had sex before. Sam already knew with who and chuckled to himself. About time.
"Don't take a
Sam rolled his eyes, the itch to kill was there under his fingertips but he refused to do so. Instead, he wanted to know why Crowley had called him in the first place. "You know, I fixed the problem. I got Castiel on the end of your deal. And you lay off my brother or else..." Sam let the unsaid threat hang in the air for a few seconds before he continued. "Anyway, you clearly need me more than I need you. Here is the deal," Sam took a deep breath.
," he got out of her grip around his hand. Castiel took a deep breath to calm himself. He thought back to when he ran away a few days before. Either shame or losing the one acquaintance I have.
"Not bad," Dean commented however he showed off by playing the perfect first riff of the song. "When you feel comfortable, I can teach you the lyrics. Who is the lucky chick?" He wiggled his eyebrows towards him. He leaned backward on his chair. Dean's shoe placed upon his leg. The air wasn't able to reach his lungs so Castiel quickly glanced away.
"Dean, do you have any plan to solve this mess?" Gabriel's hand landed on his shoulder and he almost jumped out of his skin. He tapped him quickly before the hand left his shoulder. "I mean, this is bad even for your rock standards."
Castiel suddenly got an interest in the bookshelves and rubbed his backhead. "He is asleep, I got him chained to the bed in the panic room. He tried to kill me, Sam," Castiel's last words were laced in distress, shock, and sadness. He sighed as he met Sam's gaze.
"Sammy," Dean moved to him, Sam was quick to catch his brother wasn't really there. "It's going to be okay." Dean's strong arms grabbed him by the shoulders. Sam rested his head on his shoulder. The smell of mint hit his nose, Sam wrinkled his nose. His brother had before he died smelled of leather, metal, and musk. Must be the angel-mojo he concluded.
"Vampires, werewolves, sirens, shapeshifters and—" Haziel stopped when Castiel raised his hand. Haziel bowed his head. "That's only a small amount of all, Castiel. But we do have them on our side if you agree to their deals."
A genuine sloppy kiss exchanged between them again. He should know better by now, but it was addicting. He never wanted to let go of this moment. Everything else around them dimmed down until only Dean was in his vision. He cherished it in the back of his memory. Every piece of happiness for Dean was worth it.
," Dean mumbled.
Sam stood up from his chair and put on his leather jacket. He found the keys in the drawer and found the rest of the devices he had needed over the past months. Dean didn't know that he had searched about supernatural beings, including crossroad demons. He went out of the empty house and began to walk toward the bus stop a few meters ahead.
Castiel had moved closer and closer to Dean without noticing so when Dean gulped he took a step back. Before Dean opened his mouth he already answered. "I am sorry."
A few sat in the corner talked about their latest hunt while others joked about adventures where they close to died in their hunts. Sam felt out of place.
"Stop staring at me," Dean turned towards him. His hand clenched around the console. Castiel froze in his movement. He moved his head that way he stared at the gray wall that held just a painting of a dog. He decided to sit on the bed opposite the bed Dean. Blue eyes pierced into green. Castiel rubbed the back of his head.
Dean stood perplexed for a few seconds. He didn't expect this at all. Dean let his hands to his sides. Uncertain his eyes flickered to the left. For once the angels around to know better than to interfere. He snapped his head back to the archangel. "Is Sam Winchester my little brother?"
"That's not important," Gabriel started, he wiggled his eyebrows before he scanned him up and down. "Where is your brother?"
"You want to try it?" Dean gestured at his guitar.
Dean let his gaze wander from the place they arrived at. Kids that wore colorful clothes played in a sandpit, their faces full of smiles. Their parents sat some meters aside on a bench discussing fees and other human needs Dean put his hands in his pockets. And waited.
Dean showed Cas two of his fingers in the upper strings before he took one to the thinnest one. "This is a 'g', one of the most basic to know when playing," Dean let his other hand softly over all the strings. Cas couldn't stop staring at him for some reason, he tried to look away. "It's harder. Train on it a few times and I can correct you."
"Find a way to kill Castiel Novak," Michael answered, then he flew away from him.
"Sam."
"Give it time, you are trying," Sam patted Dean's shoulder. Dean's green eyes met his. Whatever was happening, it didn't make complete sense to him. He planned how to get away from the deal yet nowhere existed a loophole. He tried, for Dean. "Many other people wouldn't put much effort as you do. Be grateful for that."
Castiel tapped his fingers on the wheel in tact with the bass. Dean's song held a mutual understanding, he had the chance to tell him.
Sam curled his fists together underneath the table and bit back his sarcastic remark at the tip of his tongue. "It's a case," Sam muttered through grit teeth. He stared at his hurting hands that were on the brink to draw blood.
"I have to," Castiel said, he smiled tiredly. He didn't expect her to understand, she worked his whole life to accept this position and bring the new world order to the motion. But what if Father wasn't the enemy? What then? Castiel let his gaze wander to Anna. She wore her usual black suit as always with a white shirt underneath. Her red hair in layers to beyond her shoulders. "For Dean," he continued.
Sam thought. Before Sam managed to put the pieces to make sense in his head, Lucifer grabbed his arm and took him outside the prison cell. Sam used the little time he got to study the possible escape routes.
? Castiel thought. "Hello Anna, no I didn't," he answered truthfully. With ease, he turned the car to the left, the stars shone brightly onto the road. The heat made him feel sleepy and Castiel shrugged it off. Anna scoffed on the other end of the line.
"Everything is going to be fine," he said onto the silence. With his fingertip, he held above Sammy's pulse point, no beating. The reality hit him like a hurricane, a scream ripped through his lungs. His brother's name on his lips. On Sam's neck, he noticed the amulet—now partly red from the blood from Sammy's neck. Dean took it around his neck and hid the amulet under his shirt. There was something about it, he couldn't keep his finger on.
"Your father is worried about you. And you go on those dates that get you nowhere, it's for your own good. You need a friend," Anna puts down the empty glass on the table.
"You know, where you torture souls and have fun?" Lucifer shrugged. "I mean, this is a good life. You will see Earth when you are ready."
Sam gestured with his hands, the monsters erupted into screams that exploded his eardrums. The angels reacted, having no questions asked. A bunch died immediately by angel blades others were cut piece by piece. Others strangled the angel vessels alive so the angel was forced to leave. Heavy breathing blocked out the rest for him. Dean emerged from his shadows as the trained assassin he became.
The wounds used last than ten seconds to heal themselves, Lucifer popped into his line of sight. "Stay out of it," Sam laid his hand on Lucifer's shoulders. "It would be sad to destroy your wings, even more, wouldn't it?"
He did the only thing he knew when Dean was out of control in a situation, he stretched out his hand and used his angelic powers to throw Castiel to the other side. Cracks appeared on the once clean surface. "Shut up!"
Anna moved to walk outside. Castiel watched her walk out warily. She had somehow gotten his phone and stolen one of his mobile numbers. Again. He held himself from swearing in God's house with a struggle. Slowly he turned to Dean.
Sam took a deep breath, it was still hard to believe that demons actually existed.
"This?" Dean showed the amulet to Gabriel and stared confused back to the guard. "From a shop downtown in California," he shrugged. Gabriel slowly nodded. Balthazar gestured for them to get back to the living room.
Castiel sighed."My parents are very religious Christians." He moved his feet and tried to avoid Dean's eyes.
Gabriel checked his watch again. "What did he do this time? Got laid before you?"
"No, Dean is part of your life. I am a fan that was too lucky," Cas snapped. "You deserve better," Cas finished before he rubbed his neck as he looked away. "But I am just a fan," Cas mumbled underneath his breath.
"Don't be," Cas said. A small smile on the tip of his mouth. Dean licked his lips, having a vague memory of how it tasted against his own. Then he recalled how Cas had listened to him about his worries and he got a lump in his throat.
Two other persons moved towards Castiel. Dean zapped himself closer so he could listen to what they said. He used glamor (a handy trick a lesser angel taught him) to hide from human eyes. The wall on his side was white like the bedsheets, Dean shook his head.
"I want you to be happy," Cas said. Dean froze. Cas tilted his head and Dean wanted to groan. Goddamn, why did he have to kill this man? He rather would... Dean didn't let himself finish that sentence instead he focused on Cas's hair that he wanted to get his hands through.
