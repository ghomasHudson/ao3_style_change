Long chapter is long. But I suppose we won't be seeing many complaints.
Right now he needs a pot of black coffee and an adequate escape route.
John's cock was heavy in the palm of Sherlock's hand, and he gave a tentative pull and release. The slickness of the heated hardness was magical, like velvety succulence made to be brought to full climax. Sherlock watched from above, observing every facial twitch and muscle spasm. He wanted to memorise what it was to bring pleasure to someone like John Watson.
His memories drifted from the tweet to Chet, then onto the long list of girlfriends or dates he’d had over the years. He’d been a ladies man back on base and had spent more nights curled up next to a warm body than alone during his deployment. Before he knew it, and without intending for it to happen, his cock was hard in his hand. He glanced over at the clock and grinned, seeing he had more than enough time for a wank, even if he did intend on getting ten hours of sleep.
Sherlock moaned at the next slide up and down of John and his erections and wrapped his legs around John’s waist. The chill of the metal table was wonderful, along with the heat they were creating in between them. The slight creak of the table legs as their movements started a healthy rhythm added to the sounds coming out of both of their mouths.
“As...
The confession is too tender and soft for Sherlock to know how to handle it with the care that it requires.
Sherlock considered going upstairs, finding John and starting his collection right away, but he remembered the hurt in John’s eyes and his resolve shrunk. Tomorrow.
“Please,” The bed felt surprisingly empty as John crawled out, fishing Sherlock’s housecoat off the chair in the corner. Their clothes had been long abandoned in the kitchen, both desperate to touch skin-to-skin, unable to wait until they had crossed the threshold to the bedroom. They had almost gotten off against the doorway, but John had had the sense to pull them inside and onto the bed before their knees had buckled beneath them.
“Oh I don’t know why specifically. He’s just so testy lately, and I’m not sure I’ve been helping, especially because I…” John sighs, unsure as to whether to admit what had transpired between them. “I let it slip that I love him.”
“Lestrade. Since you’re dating, and I’m assuming you’re exclusive, there must be times that he has to cancel a date or...just forgets to take you out. Is that accurate?”
John,” Sherlock continues, and there is a frantic look in Sherlock’s eyes that John has never seen before. “Data...variables...statistics are what helps me function through this.”
“No, no...I didn’t say that I wouldn’t. It’s just…” John retorts, his hands waving a little too wildly for Sherlock to not laugh at again. “...I’m grabbing another drink beforehand to...erm...get my throat ready.”
Sherlock was so close already. He had marvelled at John in the throes of his climax, but the sweetness of his plea for Sherlock to finish inside him was what unravelled what was left of his ability to be stoic through his orgasm.
When John had first moved in, he hadn’t smelled of anything in particular. There was the underlying scent of cheap shampoo and damp plaster from that abysmal bedsit, as well as a faint air of mothballs that he typically associated with his grandparents. The doctor’s clothes had been in storage for a long time, presumably whilst he’d been deployed, and they’d gathered dust the way that old garments do. Sherlock had noticed the scent, then quickly buried it in his mind palace. It was unimportant.
“I’m perfectly capable of being the supportive friend John needs, Mrs Hudson.”
so I will climb mountains if that’s what I need to do to make you happy.”
He knocks on the door.
“They aren’t meant for me to hear.”
Yet, when he steps out the hallway, instead of the dozens of doors that lined each side, there are now only four. The lobby is gone and in its place is a large portrait of the front clerk, smiling down at him.
"I don't have condoms on me," was the last sensible thing John managed to say before he had two fistfuls of dark curls and was guiding Sherlock's head down to his mouth. No one had said anything about sex, but the air was crackling like a fire on Christmas day consuming the last shreds of paper. It was so thick with tension that John found it impossible to breathe in anything other than short gasps. His head swam with the want and desire to do
Sherlock quirks his head, the bewilderment clear in his eyes.
For a second, John thinks it’s finished, that Sherlock is about to come back to him and they will get a second chance. He takes a tentative step forwards, ready to pull the detective into his arms, but freezes as Sherlock recoils. It’s subtle, most people would miss it, but John notices. Sherlock draws into himself, pulling their hands apart, away from the prospect of further touch, and something rips inside of John. He barely hears the next whispered words, and each one bores into his skin like needles.
“I’m sorry, you’ll do what?” Sherlock’s brow crumples, lips twitching in clear confusion.  “Since when have you ever taken on board what I suggest?”
With a purr that turned quickly into a growl, Sherlock hoisted John up so that his feet left the ground and slammed him tightly against the wall. His cock slid back into place just as if it never left, and then Sherlock pounded John
John placed his palm on the back of Sherlock’s neck. His body heat felt hot compared to the chill the table had left on his skin. He pulled Sherlock forward, nuzzling his lips and nose along the side of Sherlock’s face while breathing heavily directly into Sherlock’s ear.
“John?” A hand on his shoulder brings him back to the present. “You okay? I lost you there.”
No matter what Sherlock did to silence the voice, it would renew at the most inconvenient times.
Sherlock beamed at the surprised expression on John’s face, then chuckled as John stammered out his gratitude, waving a gently dismissive hand at John asking how the hell he had gotten tickets. Mycroft owed him a favour or two himself.
Some days John really loved his job. Today was one of those days. He was currently standing with his legs firmly planted over a man who lay cowering on the ground. He had the barrel of his gun pointed directly at the man's head. A thick metallic click resounded through the otherwise still night air as he pulled back the hammer and adjusted his aim. The man below him began to whimper and he thrust out a hand as if his fingers could stop the bullet from reaching his skull.
“Maybe he found his trousers.” I finally murmur into my cup.
However, it’s the state of the room that creates a sense of something tense. Something that has been buried under the surface for far too long. Broken pieces of furniture litter the floor, accompanied by shattered bits of what was more than likely a floor-length mirror, and torn fabric from curtains. Feathers that once belonged in the mattress hover in the air, forever suspended in time, caught in the lens of a mobile’s camera.
John quirks an eyebrow before glancing down at his drink and chuckling. “Oh, he didn’t change it. I did. Thought I might as well be as accurate as possible.”
"Tell me what you like, what you don't like. I don't do water sports, scat, blood, or kidnapping fantasies. I'm open to trying anything else."
"It's for John," Sherlock said with a broad smile.
When Philip Anderson finally left this world, he knew the two regrets that would follow him to his grave. The first was that he fought too hard for Sally Donovan, and the second that he didn't fight enough for Sherlock Holmes. Centuries might as well passed through the floor to ceiling windows of his luxury flat. His wife left him in a fury of screams and tears, while his forensics job hung on by a thread occasionally tugged by Lestrade until even that finally broke under the strain.
“Right, but that’s it?”
The bed began to shake, rocking him so violently that he couldn't keep his balance. He reached for Sherlock, trying to clasp his hand before he fell over the edge of the bed.
John giggles and pulls out the wedding band for Sherlock. Its red coloured ring case is opened and inside is a shiny band of gold. It twinkles in the sunlight but is nothing in comparison to the shimmering in Sherlock’s eyes when he first sees it.
“I’ve been here, in your ‘mind palace’, on a few occasions. It’s just that this time, you see me. Usually not a good sign of things to come.”
Thank you as always for your patience with my chapter updates, and to my amazing beta reader SherlockWatson_Holmes!
It should have been a good day. It started lovely enough. Then again, they always did start off grand.  The whispered good mornings full of featherlight kisses that still smelled faintly of the previous evening. John's attention on the various ways of making her laugh and moan and sigh all collected into a bundle of courage that helped Mary know that it was time to move forward after a year and a half.
“Oh.” Sherlock’s eyes roam over John, and John has to suppress a frustrated sigh. Whenever he’s busy or would much rather be doing anything else, Sherlock has a habit of deducing what John wants to talk about rather than waiting to be told. “You saw Mycroft? What did he want this time?”
John rolled his tongue around the base as his hands gripped Sherlock’s arse and caressed in a circular motion. The rush of arousal broke over Sherlock’s body over and over again as he placed his hands into the short golden hair and gave a tiny thrust.
She looks at me with a sweetly sympathetic expression, and I eat another biscuit. I’ll gain five pounds before this discussion is over.
"We're here, buddy. Are you getting out or what?"
“Clearly,” she replied, mouth in the faintest of smiles. “Thirty months away from him has done wonders for your sexuality…”
John appears to be struggling as to whether to comfort him or continue to shout. Sherlock has seen that same look before in the few people he’d permitted to get too close.
“Here you go,” Victor said. Sherlock put it under the microscope and focused the lens. He sat quietly, studying the sample. Well, he tried to. Victor kept trying to talk and bumping into things. “Whatcha looking at?” Sherlock rolled his eyes before looking up at him.
“I’ve got Sherlock, he’s good enough.”
"Do the makeovers," she answered.
“Okay.” Mycroft walked to the cordless phone hanging on the wall and dialed Bill’s number. The boys spent the rest of the afternoon playing superheroes and drawing and making their own comics. Mycroft taught Bill all about how superheroes could theoretically fly, and the boys decided their comics would use real science so nobody could argue that it was unrealistic. Bill was a good artist, and Mycroft knew about science, so they made an excellent team. The Ink Man and the Professor battled many foes, and became famous among the children in Ms. Thomas’ third year class.
“About?” asked Sherlock innocently.
“What’s the rest of it?” Mummy sighed.
“Oh, no, that’s okay, you have it,” said John.
“John! Not cool! It’s not easy being this good looking, and you’re not helping.”
“Sherlock,” he said. “Have an excellent first day at school, alright? Don’t let anything ruin it.” Sherlock smiled and nodded and, turning, ran to catch up with the other kids trickling into the building.
Sherlock finally regained his composure. He splashed his face with cold water and grabbed his pack of cigarettes. He needed to go for a walk. A walk to a specific place.
“He’s a baby, he doesn’t really understand it. He will when he’s older, though,” she added upon seeing Mycroft look a tad dejected. He smiled a little.
“Oh, no, I could never forget you. I just tuned you out.” Mycroft made an unpleasant face. Lestrade chuckled at the exchange. “Brother dear, have you gone to the water yet? I think you’d enjoy it. Nice and cold, just like your heart.” Mycroft glared at him.
“When John comes back let’s all go together.”
One of Mycroft’s resolutions for the new year was to learn to play the violin gifted to him by Uncle Rudy. He took the instrument and bow out of the case and opened the lesson book to the first page. He tuned the violin and adjusted and rosined the bow. The first exercise in the book didn’t use the bow, though, so he put it back in the case. The exercise involved plucking the strings and learning their names, as well as how to play notes that required fretting. He had no trouble learning the theory, however, he had difficulty in actually playing the notes. He figured he would just need practice, and so he practiced every day. By Thursday, however, he still struggled with fretting, and the bow just made everything more difficult. He was getting very frustrated.
Sherlock couldn’t imagine what life would be like without Victor. Well, he could, but he didn’t want to. Whenever Victor walked into the room, Sherlock felt an inexplicable sense of happiness and calm, as if nothing bad could ever happen. He thought about him a lot when he didn’t have anything to do. This shook Sherlock a little. He had never felt about anyone in this way before. Luckily, he was able to keep busy with classes, fencing, and boxing, in addition to all the activities he did on his own. Victor came to every fencing tournament, every boxing match, and he never missed one. Before they’d start, Sherlock would scan the crowd to find Victor, and he’d always feel a little sense of pride that someone was up there rooting for him.
“He lived nearby,” John gasped. “Then that leads us to only a few dozen people who lived in the nearby area.”
By the time John had gotten to the front door of his flat, his arms were trembling and incredibly sore. The Omega was slender, but still much taller than he was and the dead weight from the bridal hold was almost too much to bear. With a few well-placed huffs he had gotten them up the flight of steps and into the entryway. John peered around quickly to make sure that absolutely no one had followed them and then unlocked the front door all while shifting the omega in his arms enough to get the door open and clamber inside. With a swift kick of his foot, the door shut behind them. John's two-bedroom flat wasn't overly spacious, and at this precise moment, he hated his past self for being so minimalistic. It made manoeuvring his patient more involved, but John was eventually able to get the man laid out onto the living room couch.
“It means new life,” the boy continued. “If your friend was unhappy with his old life, he may have come here to start over?”
Was that what had upset Sherlock? Ever since it had been let slip to Anderson that Sherlock and John were together, the man had not been able to let it go. Hardly a case went by without him commenting on their relationship status, as if he couldn’t quite believe it. It hasn’t bothered John before, he’s become fairly adept at shutting these things out, but it must have been the last straw for Sherlock. Instinctively, John wants to ask Sherlock directly to see if his theory holds any water, but is that even really his place now to do? Maybe. They are still trying to be friends, after all. Weren’t they?
“I’ll buy some cereal tomorrow. Can’t mess that up.”
John balled up his fingers into fists and for a fleeting second Sally thought that he was about to explode. She took one step back just in case.
“Sherlock? Are you okay?”
“That was…” John glanced around quickly before bending over to make sure that only Sherlock could hear him. “That was different. Things have changed now...and you know that.”
Sally frowned, then began to push the door closed. John’s face peered back a mirror of the same desperation that Sherlock had given her a year ago.
John was so stupid. Sherlock was the kid that pulled things apart just to figure out how they went together again. He’d never been a natural with social skills, that much he admitted, and he worked by analysing behaviour patterns and matching them with meanings. Of course, when faced with someone like John, someone that he cared about, he’d want to discover everything about them.
he'd had a few months to get used to these types of misadventures. The types of misadventures that had John leaving yet another voicemail.
John waves away the apology with his free hand. “It gets us out of the flat and stops him from finding more human body parts to put in the fridge. Win-win all around.”
“Nothing, forget it.” John’s fists clench at his sides and his breaths quicken. He wasn’t supposed to tell Sherlock that particular information. Not now; not ever. He is supposed to be the sensible one who thinks before he speaks, and yet he blurts out a love confession when they aren’t even dating anymore. Stupid. Stupid.
"I've spent the last two years accepting that he was dead. Making my mind push it in no matter how much I needed it not to be true, and I was
“Oh, bloody hell. Is that what this is? You’re trying to placate me so you can get on with the case?”
“Mornin’” John murmured into Sherlock’s shoulder blades, making him jump slightly.
“Sounds like the full kitty cat army has arrived to show you how much you’re adored, my darling,” Irene says serenely. “And I’ll be there tomorrow to add some additional reinforcements?”
“I can’t say that it’s okay because it’s not,” Sherlock eventually admits. “I wanted to be okay with it, but all my life, no one has wanted me. Not the
The detective’s quiet gaze seems to be absorbing any small amount of data to sort out John’s weaknesses. The barely controlled intermittent tremor in his left hand. The licking of his lips. The flare of his nostrils.
A few more spoonfed swallows and the throbbing of Sherlock’s head becomes much more tolerable. A soft ache as opposed to his skull being ripped apart at the seams.
Sherlock moans grow louder, and John knows that he’s nearly there. Just another few thrusts in the exact spot he has learned like a roadmap and Sherlock spills warm and wet in between their bellies. Sherlock tenses around John’s cock with the aftershock, and it pulls John over the edge to join him. They breathe between kisses, and Sherlock’s bedroom smells of sex and sweat and what the two of them become when they only belong to each other.
"You're ruining the moment, Seb. Now get out of here for the night. I'll call you back around in the morning."
“Yes,” John answers finally. “During cases, I guess? Though nothing as disturbingly detailed as what I stumbled across.”
John was facing away from the door by the time Sherlock finally arrived. He was in a shared ward, but only half of the beds were full; an elderly lady in the far corner opposite John and a middle-aged gentleman near the door. They both glared as Sherlock burst through the door, but John didn’t so much as turn around.
John found out that he’s bisexual because he fantasises about me, and why are the walls suddenly getting closer?
“Have you ever considered that other people live in this house? That other people have ears and eyes, and deal with whatever you get up to?” John has a bizarre expression on his face, a comical mix between anger and confusion. I stand up and fill the kettle again. We’re going to need more coffee for this. “John, I am incredibly happy you have discovered that you’re Bi. I really am. I’m also happy that you’re obviously having a lot of fun with your new sexual escapades, but do they really have to be every night?”
In the reflection is the mirror image of himself still inside of John. He looks very much the same if perhaps a tad paler, except for flushness in his chest and cheeks for obvious reasons. However, there is a large thing added. Two large, deep navy blue leather-like things if technicality ends up being a factor.
“Shh, just — can we enjoy this, for a moment?”
aware of this. He was told as much a few weeks after their first time together. Sherlock had mentioned that John's ability to cause his mind palace to quiet was one of the most remarkable skills that Sherlock had ever encountered. The admission was the closest thing to a love confession that Sherlock had ever given him, and he held it tight and would never let go.
,” Sherlock says. “The large wings, incessant hunger for sex…the emotions that you stir up when you touch me. Hold me. And I concede that incubi haven’t been seen for close to two centuries…”
“Doubt is just another word for questioning, Mr Holmes.”
“And you were the person who packed your bag, Dr. Watson?”
“Yes and no. It definitely helped me keep a lot of variables in one area, so I could create better overall conditions for your enjoyment and pleasure...and mine as well, with the discovery of praise and what it does to my overall arousal. Interestingly enough, you have been the first partner I’ve had that has awakened that side of my stimulation.”
Pierce had been very little help in regards to the new rash of copycat murders. When questioned, he maintained a stubborn silence after requesting to speak to his lawyer. Lestrade had realised Pierce would be no help to them and quickly demanded him to be taken back to his cell. Sherlock hadn’t even had the chance to interrogate the man himself, much to his annoyance.
dead. This has been apparent long before Anderson had created The Empty Hearse club whose members would swap theories and rumors about how the world's only consulting detective found a way to baffle them all.
had sex before,” Sherlock snaps, not sure where this uncomfortable conversation is headed. “And even if I hadn’t, I’m an adult who gave you consent...and what does it have to do with you making me an incubus?”
John pressed the button on the side of his watch, illuminating the screen.
"I don't know…" John said honestly, admitting it to himself and to Greg thanks to the alcohol. "You're going to laugh, but we just met officially today. I needed to prove a point to him… See, he and I have been chatting on Twitter for a while now, silly things mostly. But I noticed a pattern with other forensic officers turning up dead under mysterious or less than natural causes. Told him about the pattern, warned him about the danger he could possibly be in, and he shut me down."
Most evenings went like that now. John chattering to himself, Sherlock retreating into his mind palace to rearrange data or analyse John’s every move.
“Okay then.”
“You kept them,” John whispers.
To give himself something to do, Sherlock adjusts his Belstaff and surges forward up the next street with John right behind. He needs to get a grip on the night and keep the script in the centre of his brain. Record John’s emotions, deduce his motivations, and get his own feelings out of the equation, no matter what.
“It’s for the case.”
Evidently, Sherlock is sleeping with an insane person, and John snorts out a laugh.
“People who are ace can have sex for many reasons, Sherlock. They have sex because they enjoy helping their partner feel good for example, or they find pleasure in orgasms and afterglow, but not necessarily the build up to it.”
How? It was quite obvious Pierce must have had an accomplice; the man couldn’t be in two places at once, and it was true that the details hadn’t yet been released to the public. Not fully. Yet, there was another victim. Freshly rotting.
Sherlock grinned as he began to try and take off his coat. The streets of London still clung onto the fibres, and he never wanted this night to end. John smiled back in the way that Sherlock’s mind palace had stored in the deepest section. The same look that Sherlock had first seen when they sat across from each other at Angelo’s, and that meant more than anything now.
Sherlock opened his eyes to see John standing next to the bed, holding two plates in his hands. They were piled up with scrambled eggs, crispy bacon and what looked like a well-intentioned attempt at pancakes.
After a dinner that Sherlock barely eats, wrapped up in what John is fairly certain is one of his own bedsheets, John's practically on the verge of a meltdown.
“I said, take a break.”
Usually, Sherlock would whisper John’s name in these situations. It helped John wake up to the sound of a lulling voice, but tonight Sherlock instinctively touched his hand to John’s right shoulder. The gentle caress was enough for John to open his eyes, and the tenseness in his face left at once.
Leah gives him a warm smile and pushes the conversation forwards, chatting about the patients she’d had that week and how she’s convinced her new boss already hates her. John nods and laughs at all the correct points, but his mind is still stuck on his mistake.
Sherlock gave a small sniff. "If it was the round red table in the hallway, it was from Mycroft, so splendid if you did throw it out."
“Why are you wearing my clothes?” Sherlock asks when his mind has settled slightly. He opens his eyes and sees Irene's smile broaden as she lifts up her arm to refasten the sleeve of the purple button-down.
Harry's blowfish expression makes a second appearance as she gawks at the screen.
The soft knock on the door pulled Sally out of her musings.
It had been John’s idea to come here. One night, when they’d been curled up in bed together, he’d suggested they attend London Pride that year. He’d wanted to push himself, to prove that he was confident enough to stand in a crowd of fellow LGBTQ+ people and proclaim that he was proud of his identity, but in hindsight, perhaps this was too much. It has been a year and a half since he and Sherlock had come back to each other, and whilst he’s much better now than he’s ever been, there are still times when his confidence fails him.
No. No. Wrong thing to say.
“I know about Sherlock being alive.”
Greg narrows his eyes, and John watches him check to assure that Sherlock is still out of easy hearing range.
“John?” Sherlock asked tentatively as he approached the bed. John finally looked up, disinterest plastered all over his face.
“I’m taking John on a date tonight.”
Sherlock swivels on the spot and shoots death glares directly at John and Greg. “Would you both be better served by doing other things than chattering behind me whilst I’m working?”
John stays still, stunned into silence. He’s not sure he agrees with all of what she’s saying, but it’s the first time someone has laid it out this way.
isn’t
Harry frowns as she takes back her mobile and zooms in on John and his mystery man. Then she makes a small noise in the back of her throat that John has never heard before. It sounds like something between a gasp of shock and the squeal of a sister who’s just learned a
John kept her tone as soft and frilly as the doilies for her teapots. All while the second man she embraced as a son, grew thinner and more fragile. His soldier stance and steady gaze all dissolving into the half-eaten sandwiches and partially sipped cups of Earl Grey.
He snorts a laugh but quickly swallows it down. The lights of the morgue flicker before returning to their previous state of brightness. He ignores it.
John stands up and tugs Sherlock up to his feet. “We can’t have you stomping across London with those wings all out for humans to see, and flying isn’t something you’re ready for yet.”
"Sherlock," John said cautiously, "did you have your brother buy me clothes?"
“You look, but you do not see. The man came out to the middle of the woods in his best suit, yet his shoes are old and worn. He recently bought the suit but wanted to make sure that his footwear was comfortable for the trip up. The gunshots are close range but from the angle of the wounds and the way that he fell, he was shot from above. The closest trees in the area are silver birch. Sturdy, but not easily able to carry a large amount of weight. The victim has some leaves of silver birch trapped in the underside of his trousers. He didn’t think to brush those away after he climbed.”
. This is right and rich and exactly what they both need. Sherlock whimpers and melts into John’s arms, yielding beneath the weight of his body. Sherlock’s captivating mouth is softer than John remembers it, and the taste of his lips has John wanting to carve his initials in the line of Sherlock’s spine with his nails. He gives those same nails a tentative drag and Sherlock practically melts into his arms at the sensation. The shudders begin and end both of them as they try to make it to a bed. John pulls Sherlock along the hallway, stopping every so often to push him against the wall and kiss him again. Sherlock is pliant and soft in every place John’s body connects with his.
Sherlock tried not to roll his eyes. If anything, he should feel flattered. The man was young and attractive, and clearly interested. Once, he was the type that Sherlock would have easily taken somewhere quick and secluded, but that felt like centuries ago.
John starts pushing again the moment they enter the flat, throwing his jacket over his chair and angrily flicking the kettle on. Coffee. He needs coffee.
“Is it later yet?” John murmured, reaching one hand out to run his thumb along the ridge of Sherlock’s cheekbones.
“And what do I owe this…” John begins, before frowning deeply. “Definitely not pleasure. Quite the opposite. Misery? Yeah, that works.” John internally smirks at the affronted look on Mycroft’s face. Good to get his kicks in whilst he can.
“Pity how bisexual man didn’t even make the top three. What does that say about you, Dr Watson?”
“Is it for a case?”
This is death incarnate.
“Sherlock…” Lestrade said, irritation clear in his tone. “Ignoring me does nothing but make me talk louder.”
He pocketed his mobile as the man on the corner gave him yet another once over. If anything, Sherlock should be the one concerned. It had been a few years since he had been in this exact situation, and back then he’d already been high as a kite during the transaction.
“You barely asked any questions before we got here, which is unusual for you, you purposefully initiated physical contact in the cab and now you’re acting as if you’ve never been to a crime scene before. What’s wrong?”
“I’ll put your things upstairs.” The sentence stops John short. He wanted this, hell, he’d been the one to initiate it, but something about the visual of Sherlock packing the remnants of their relationship into a box is like a kick in the teeth. Sherlock is still in the same dressing gown that John had pushed off his shoulders only a few days ago. Just 72 hours removed from what was so wondrous when everything lined into place.
Wanting to draw this out, so it wasn't over before it had even begun, John regretfully dragged his hand away from Sherlock's groin. He focused his attention on Sherlock's arse, on the back of his thighs and lowered back. Trailing his fingernails softly across the quivering flesh. He sucked one more purple claim to the space between Sherlock's shoulder blades before gently tapping him on the shoulder to get his attention.
Another night, another motel, another job done. Tomorrow, he’d move to a new location and assume a new false identity and fake job. Checking into a motel as just a generic businessman helped him blend in with the other guests, which helped make him more forgettable. As for tonight? Well, he’d have a well-earned drink, allow himself some time reading the obituaries, then sleep like the dead until housekeeping reminded him it was time to check out.
“Did you want to get that?” the female officer suggested. “We have no problem with waiting to hear your answer, Dr. Watson.”
Not only had he dispatched of a problem without it resulting in violence, but now he was on his way to an exclusive party where he intended to stuff himself silly on expensive finger food. Yes, today was one of those days where he
“I do recall...yes,” Sherlock whispered.
Sherlock snatched his hand out of John’s reach as he tried to touch him. This wasn’t about ruining anything. This was about John’s inability to be truthful.
"They sell food here? Chips or crisps? I need something."
Whispers of Irene and Sally’s words crash against the base of his skull like fireflies trapped in a bell jar, but he still journeyed forward. Passport cracked around the edges due to being clutched far too tight in a hand that had felt walls tremble under already bruised knuckles.
“Sounds like a plan.” Sherlock’s stomach lurched slightly as the lift descended too quickly. The doors opened with a ping as they reached the ground floor, and they passed a solitary woman on the way out, too busy on her phone to move out of the way.
“I suppose that...yes, I can make a few adjustments to the— “
“Yes, I — I was just wondering why I didn’t know.”
This right here is why they didn’t work. Sherlock running off on his own, cutting John out of his life the moment a case came up. This coldness, the complete separation of The Work and their life together, this was the reason he’d had to walk away. John mentally kicks himself. Nothing was different. Nothing had changed. There was a reason why they didn’t do this anymore; why they had fallen apart.
John was out of the room before Sherlock could say anything else. Usually able to think so fast, his brain had stalled, unable to come up with an explanation that wouldn’t make John hate him. The room was cold, both with the evening breeze and John’s absence. Sherlock shivered, the quickly drying lube becoming uncomfortable, but he found himself paralysed with uncertainty. How had he let himself become so consumed by his insecurity, that he’d ignored what was right in front of him? He couldn’t,
“Fine.” He says sharply, more to the bolognese than to John.
“What the hell is my mind palace doing?” Sherlock mutters. He runs a hand through his hair before taking a look at his options. Irene’s room, number 44, is just behind him, but that is absolutely out of the question. Instead, he opens the room across the hall labelled number 71.
If John was here right now, he would be grumbling about them needing better footwear. Sherlock, in his usual dress shoes, slides around a corner, hot on the trail of their latest criminal. Racing around the streets of London dictates proper footwear, but John fails to realise that fashion can never be out of any equation.
It took him less than an hour to finish the job, and he found himself back in his motel room before midnight. Knowing his Frustrated Forensic friend was usually up at this hour (judging by the timestamps on his tweets), John first checked Twitter before indulging in the day’s Obituaries.
“I believe you were about to ask me the question as well,” Sherlock whispers.
They pull up outside the bar, and John pays the driver before following Leah inside. She picks a table in the corner, secluded from the rest of the room.
Pale skin glistening with sweat that clings onto the sheets, and John is kissing Sherlock again because he needs to be close enough to see the usually ever-present eyes glaze over. Heady with lust that is and should always be John’s doing.
John was intoxicating beyond any Scotch that Sherlock would ever taste. John's mouth moved with his as if he knew all of Sherlock's private fantasies locked up in a room where even Sherlock had no key. With a whimper, he pulled John to his feet and draped his arms around him. The scissors did quick work, and the rest of John's suit tumbled to the floor in navy blue tatters.
“You like that?”
More scribbling. Much more scribbling than necessary for the small amount of information that John had given out so far.
The bar was crowded, warm bodies pushing against each other in the dim light, but he found a secluded seat in the corner and ordered a whisky. He swirled it around the glass, trying to order his thoughts into neat files. He didn’t care about the restaurant, the casual undermining of their relationship by John, not anymore. He was scared of the person he’d become — the one that fought for validation from strangers, that wanted people to look at John and know that he was his. He had never been that person, the one that saw injustices in every fold of the world and fought to make them right. Oh, he admired those people, but he preferred to blend into the background, unobserved. But today, today had been different, and he couldn’t understand why.
Ted cleared his throat again before taking a larger gulp of wine. With any luck, Sherlock would be alone in the next half hour.
He chided himself when Sherlock didn't recoil from him at the mention of condoms. Perhaps he hadn't read the mood wrong after all. However, whatever was about to happen between himself and this graceful creature. He owed it to Sherlock to be smart about it.
He keeps his tone as conversational as he can, but John’s wary expression lets Sherlock know that he isn’t fooling anyone.
“Inspector Donovan?”
John would never grow tired of this sight. Of the vision of Sherlock Holmes completely undone with John’s name on his lips. This moment was better than the act of sex itself, and John got to witness it nearly every day. No longer holding Sherlock up, John slid his hand over Sherlock’s hip and thigh, then grabbed tight as he coaxed the last needed ounce of pleasure from himself.
“And good afternoon to you as well, Dr. Watson. I assume that your visit with Philip Anderson was beneficial?”
“Your deductions are, without a doubt, what turns me one more than anything else,” John continued, and Sherlock appreciated that John kept his voice low so that only he could make out the words clearly. “The first time...after we met...after that
Harry gives a small laugh. “In rehab, forgiveness and making amends were crammed down our throats for a reason. I just wish I had this mindset when Clara was still trying to stop me  shoving my head up my own arse. ”
price point is 30,000 pounds, John. Get my parents on the phone. My brother has gone insane and needs to be committed. He has access to nuclear codes, dear bloody fuck." Sherlock flapped his hand near his face to try to give himself some additional air. The walls were closing upon him. "That diabolical prick. He devised this all in a masterpiece of villainy to kill me off from the shock of it. I'll come back as a ghost and spook him the rest of his life over this."
With incredible difficulty, Sherlock pulled away from John's lap and walked with deliberate purpose to the small side table next to the leather couch in the sitting room. Sherlock felt John's eyes on each part of his body, and that was fine. More than fine. It had been years since Sherlock ever felt this desperately wanted.
Sherlock's thighs began to shake, which at any other time wouldn't have been an issue. But there were stitches John did not want tearing during this adventure. He rested the elbow of his left arm on Sherlock's right thigh while placing his free hand flat on the other. With the faintest amount of pressure, he managed to get the shaking under control and was free to pour his full attention back over the erection throbbing in his mouth.
“Thank god you finally answered,” Greg sighed, tone full of relief. “I’ve been texting you for the past hour. It’s urgent. There was a body found this afternoon, about ten miles out of London. It’s the same MO as Pierce, but...I need you and John to get here as soon as you can.”
“No, that’s not—”
who had ruined their night, and not John. John had every right to be upset about the entire situation. Sherlock furrowed his brow and shook away the confusion. The spreadsheet would fix all of this in the end.
“Did you need me for something?”
Sherlock takes a sip of water as they begin to walk down the street. The liquid is soft against his throat, and he slurps it down, not realising how thirsty he was. He feels hot in ways that can’t be healthy, and John being so close isn’t helping at all. Even their shadows seem to be intimately connected. A topic is needed to help muscle through all the weighted silence. Sherlock searches for anything to say that’s safe and decidedly not about what keeps coming to the forefront of his mind.
This was Hell, and his reactions to it were being documented on a clipboard. The rhythmic scribbling of ballpoint pen onto the permanent record of Aviation Policing Command that Dr John Hamish Watson was not to be trusted to leave England without a proper pat-down.
“What?” John slurred, rubbing at his eyes and stifling a yawn.
“Hey,” Molly said as he pushed open the laboratory door. She was wearing lipstick again, and cradling the same coffee mug from the previous time he had been here.
“Are you sure?” He whispers, “If we do this, everything changes. No wedding, no Mary. I need you so badly, but I have to know — is this what you want?”
Not me.
"Shall we? I do believe you still have a party to attend."
“Just wait, you git. This is important. No talking about this with anyone else. Not Lestrade, not Molly.“
“Don’t you even bloody
His eyes roll back as he moans out my name, and it’s better than even my fondest dreams. It’s almost reverent, despite the dirtiness of his words. How he will have me in every part of the flat that has room for the two of us, and I say challenge accepted to it.
“Jesus Christ ever-loving
It isn’t until after two am, when John is seriously considering phoning Lestrade, that Sherlock returns. John is curled on the sofa with a cup of coffee, trying to watch reruns of The Great British Bake Off. He isn’t really paying attention, his mind has begun to spiral, and he can’t focus on the screen in front of him.
John makes his way to the till as Sherlock doubles back for a rainbow flag. A deep calm has settled over him, and he can appreciate the chaotic energy of the shop far more than he could before. It’s almost comforting, knowing that no one here is eyeing up their physical contact, judging them for their affection. He doesn’t have to worry about what anyone else thinks.
Sherlock woke with a start. It took a moment for his brain to re-engage and realise what had woken him—a hand had wrapped its way around his waist. He stared at it for a moment, synaptic nerves firing at a hundred miles an hour, before he remembered the events of the night before. John, in his bed, squirming over the sheets as Sherlock ran his tongue along the rim of his arse, one hand grasped on the hard line of his cock. More memories for the John inhabited shelves of his mind palace.
“Eating something will help,” John advises as he spoons out a few of a bowl's contents propped on the bedside table and presses it close to Sherlock’s lips. “Tomato basil blended in with O positive.”
a doctor. “You need me to help you to the couch? That’s the closest place for you to stretch out while I get you some water.”
"I would suggest calling Dr Watson or Mr Moran?" Mycroft said. "Perhaps they would be able to calm my little brother - "
“We can take this slow for now, if you want? Start simple, work our way up. Do you want that?” He asks, and it takes all my control to let him finish the sentence.
John reads the task, silently mouthing the words as he does so. When he finishes, his gaze shifts up, his eyes slightly narrowed.
By the time they get to the end of the first chorus more people have joined in, all drunkenly belting out the words. There are at least six people singing, but Sherlock only has eyes for John. He has a wide grin plastered to his face, and he’s tapping his foot in line with the beat. Sherlock expects them to tail off somewhere in the middle of the song, but John diligently leads the bar through the whole thing, even going so far as to sway on the ‘la-di-das’. Sherlock’s hand darts out a few times to steady him, but John never loses his balance on the chair.
“I did the work. At least, I
Sherlock’s crash to the floor stops whatever John was about to say next. His body is already recovering from the fall as his hands scramble and claw towards the last location he saw his mobile. Lestrade must think he's been kidnapped or worse for not texting in the past two days.
Sherlock could hear Lestrade holding his breath, and the familiar background noise of the yard began to bleed through. The muffled beeping of the photocopier; shuffled feet along the carpeted floor. He must have been in the staffroom. We he grabbing another coffee?
“Perhaps a change of scenery is in order,” Irene suggests. “Someplace that’s more relaxing?”
Sherlock shakes his head and goes back to studying his books, and John begins reading once more. However, barely a few minutes later, the prickly feeling returns, and John subtly glances up to catch Sherlock staring at him again. He doesn’t say anything, but gives a light cough as he turns the next page. It’s not the first time Sherlock has acted unusually, and normally, if John ignores him, he eventually goes back to whatever he was doing before. No harm, no foul. Yet, this time, the prickly feeling doesn’t go away, and the next time John glances up he sees that Sherlock has a sketch pad in his hand, and is frantically scribbling away as he watches John.
Greg turns on the spot and zips out of there quickly, leaving John to witness what Sherlock looks like when completely cornered.
That was enough to stop Seb dead in his tracks. Sherlock might as well have slapped him in the face with a fresh piece of roadkill.
“Explain yourself,” Sherlock says, derailing John’s conflicted train of thought.
She did shoot him a significant look as they left, but he merely rolled his eyes and followed John out of the room.
Aaaaaand here we have the second chapter! YAY! I can't tell you how excited we are to be getting this out to you all! :D After a wonderful time speaking and interacting with everyone at HolmesCon 2020, we hit the ground running and cranked this out as quickly as we could :) Thanks so much for your amazing support! Hope you enjoy!
“How very polite of you.”
With the smallest of smiles, Sherlock sank his naked body onto John's lap again. The scissors glistened in the artificial kitchen light as he turned the tip of the scissors down once more, very aware that even though John was as inebriated as himself, that he was very capable of turning the tables and killing in an instant if he sensed any threat from what Sherlock was about to do.
“He’s how I ended up in Kensington.”
“We don’t need to do this here,” John whispered loudly, leaning forward across the table.
When he turned five his parents decided to plan a birthday party without telling him. A total of thirteen boys had jumped out from numerous and —
“Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck!” John groans through gritted teeth, punching the seat cushion next to him. They were getting somewhere, almost. This is the most they have properly communicated in months, and he just blew it. Who knows if things will ever be the same. Hell, who knows if Sherlock will even want him in the flat anymore. ‘
“Research usually ends up being a double edged sword for me, but it is what it is.”
“But you can’t…” Sherlock pleads, and any semblance of aloofness has now been completely stripped bare. “you said that you loved me…”
John took the glass and returned a moment later with it full of water. He ignored Sherlock's scowl then pointed to the pain tablets that sat on the coffee table.
An old uni friend then. Neither had stayed in contact enough to know what stage the other was at in their life, but they had been close enough to recognise each other from voice alone. Close, but not enough to stay in touch, so a casual friend. An old fling? No, Sherlock wouldn’t allow himself to deduce that much. He wasn’t the jealous type, or, at least he didn’t think he was, but he’d rather not know.
“Lestrade?”
“Okay, then. We can work something out.”
vampire. You’re a Belstaff.”
The magnitude of John’s scribbled proclamation was so painfully raw and real that it almost tore through Sherlock’s resolve not to fall apart completely. Not here. He needed to be strong for John. Prove that he was better than the person John thought just didn’t want to answer his phone calls.
“Hey, shhh.” Sherlock pulls John into him, winding his arms around his back and giving a gentle squeeze. John’s head settles in the soft spot between Sherlock’s chest and arm, and he pushes his nose in farther, inhaling the familiar scent. “You’re allowed to change John. These identities -- they serve you, not the other way round. If bisexual is the word that works for now, then that’s what we’ll use. But it’s not fixed, you can change your label at any time as you learn more about yourself. There’s no rush. I love you regardless.”
The coffee hadn't even been poured into mugs before he erupted. The brimstone of John's words scorching Mary's skin and whatever else had the audacity to argue why anything should be taken out of
“You’ll be fine,” John says, still chuckling. “I’ll be showing you what to do beforehand. Now, take a few deep breaths and bring out your wings.”
“The drama queen gene is a hereditary trait, then?” John chides, ignoring the twist in his stomach as Sherlock brushes his worries off without care. He should have known that Sherlock wouldn’t put much weight behind his brother’s antics. He’d rather pour over old case files. “Why are you looking through all these again? I thought they’d be in your mind palace by now.”
As the hours pass and the sun begins to set, the two women find themselves curled together on the sofa, stealing kisses and feeding each other bites of sandwiches and slivers of cheese. The cats float in and out of the room, seeming to find that their two favourite humans on the planet being so close and snuggled up together is just what they all thought would happen eventually.
That same laugh that caused the odd flutterings of lightness in Sherlock’s chest. John placed his hand on top of Sherlock’s, the weight of it secure and steadfast. John kept it there for the next three minutes and nineteen seconds.
But did that mean it was all or nothing?
to give it to him.
"But in all seriousness, John...maybe the clue is more concrete than you think. Part of a bigger puzzle."
John watched Sherlock's eyes crinkle into a smile at that, and a little bit of him relaxed. So far, Sherlock hadn't said anything about his tattoos, and John hadn't been certain if that meant he wasn't a fan. Granted, over the last three days, there hadn't exactly been the right opportunity for him to bring up the topic.
“For every awful person out in the universe there are at least two more who will be kind and respectful. It’s just a matter of getting past those arseholes first, and you are strong enough to do it, darling. Even if you need to take some time to recover, once in a while.”
“I’m aware that it’s you, Sherlock…” John hissed. “Why the hell did you not tell me about it, and even worse, sneak it in my duffel bag when I was going to be going through airport security?”
John’s now steady hands slid cautiously down the long legs bruised with clear signs of assault. Purple finger marks and angry red scratches peppered the otherwise gorgeous canvas of pale skin. Tenderly as he dared, John shuffled to the lower part of Sherlock’s narrow hips and, after delicate removal of what was left of his trousers and undergarments, John spread the omega’s legs open. At the first cursory glance, there thankfully appeared to be no outward signs of trauma and John felt himself release a nervous breath for the first time in minutes.
by the nametag -- reminded John of a few blokes he knew back in his army days. Tall and muscular with sharp eyes that had seen more in a lifetime than men twice their age, and a smirk that could curdle cream.
“Don’t apologise for anything,” I reply. “If anything, I should be the one saying I’m sorry for chasing away Kristopher with a K.”
“Where are you going?” Sherlock exclaims the moment John takes a step forward.
He’s pacing now, moving back and forth as he shuts his eyes as tight as he can. Darkness and proper focus are what he needs. Comb through the solid evidence. The sounds are driving him mad, but he needs to ignore them for as long as he can.
“Of course I’ve missed something—” Sherlock yelled, taking a deep breath as the DI straightened his spine and crossed his arms over his chest. “We’ve missed something, but I don’t think it’s here. I’m going back to Baker Street. Call me if you find anything.”
, John.”
“Okay.” John nodded, and Sherlock let his hand fall from where it had still been clutching John’s arm. He was about to turn when John continued: “Even the praise?” The gentle smirk perched on John's lips told a thousand stories. So he had noticed, and Sherlock wasn’t as subtle as he’d thought.
So he sits in his armchair and opens the sketchbook, a feeling of expectation invading him.
“Sherlock, are you listening?” he feels disillusioned now, maybe it was not that big of a thing? Maybe Sherlock has already deduced it and it's such a mundane thing, so boring, that Sherlock has decided to completely ignore him? For some reason this one hurts a little more than the other times his flatmate has been inconsiderate with him.
He puts a hand against Sherlock’s cheek never braking eye contact, he couldn’t even if he wanted to.
And then.
It's been some time after Reichenbach. John doesn't even know how much time has passed.
He turns the page once more.
“Why?” John sounds confused “Well, it sort of- sort of happened, I saw you there, and saw you again, and again, and again. And I tried, I swear I tried, but I couldn’t stop myself from drawing you. You are…” John trails off.
Will I ever be able to take my eyes off of his?
I hope you'll enjoy this new chapter and I promise not to let so much time between each chapter.
Curiously, the more John sank into darkness the most clear he could see her. Instead of finding this unseattleing, he find it somehow reassuring.
And now Sherlock is left with his mouth hanging open.
“J-John” Sherlock seems to say something, but nothing comes out. He wants to, he wants to tell John everything he feels. But it’s okay, because John knows, John sees it in Sherlock eyes and asks a silent question.
John manages to convince himself that he's only drawing Sherlock because he needs reference and his flatmate is the most available.
Again, every detail is carefully placed with as much precision as the other ones. But there's something different about this one. It's Sherlock, that is obvious, and it reflects perfectly the severity of his features. The arrogance that Sherlock shows everyday it's present, but the eyes are just out of place. They look with just a hint of endearment, as if in the portrait Sherlock is hiding it for everybody but the viewer.
“We remain invisible for all of our human existence. So as not to upset them with things they won’t understand” The girl became serious. “The closer our human is to death the more they are able to interact with us.”
, instead who he sees is a little girl who he doesn’t recognize.
He saw her right then and there, when he could barely stay conscious. She was smiling. And he could see her so clearly, in contrast of all the blurness that was becoming his reality... He remembers thinking about her smile, about how it maybe wouldn’t be so bad to die if she accompanied him. It was reassuring.
“Shut up, you cheeky git” chuckles Sherlock, and leans again for another kiss.
“Why did you do it?” Sherlock whispers back. And although he doesn’t let himself believe entirely what he desperately wants, the fact that John is obviously nervous and blaming himself for something Sherlock doesn’t get entirely, lets a little bit of hope flame up in the detective chest.
John, takes a moment, the words of his father repeating in his head, and he smiles to himself.
And then it strike him, like a lighting in the darkness.
When he grew up, well, let's just say that his father was not exactly fond of the hobby of John. He said, not exactly in a calm tone, that drawing was a waste of time and his son stupid for dedicating to such ridiculous pastimes.
He starts drawing.
“And that’s fine, of course it’s fine, I- that’s – what I did was a bit not good” John lets out a sad chuckle for the chose of words. By now, Sherlock is standing in front of him, but John is looking everywhere but him. John wouldn’t stand seeing the rejection from Sherlock eyes.
A thousand emotions explode inside of them. Making things right. Both man know it then, it will be alright, not matter what, everything will be alright.
Would he still be alive if he had begged? Would he still have jumped if John hadn't shouted at him? Did he die thinking that John hated him?
Again, I'm sorry.
But there’s none.
It was the guilt that was slowly killing him.
“I’m what, John?” Sherlock urges him to keep talking, he and his heart need answers.
He turns the page, now there's a single flock of dark curls standing in the centre of the page. Here, it's clear that John was practising hair.
It takes a little bit to John to process what is happening, “Umm… Sherlock?”, he’s never seen Sherlock like that, like he’s nervous for his actions, like he fears John’s reaction. That’s laughable, it sure is a mess in the kitchen caused by some failed experiment or something like that. He doesn’t want me to shout at him, for doing it AGAIN, that’s why that look. God I’m so tired for shouting, whatever it is it can wait till tomorrow or whenever. “Sherlock” John repeats, but the man doesn’t move one centimetre, still observing him with that nearly absurd look. I could draw him like that, that’s a funny pose. Honestly, I could draw every expression, every pose he takes, everything and still I wouldn’t be able to…
John closes his eyes for a moment and takes a deep breath, he decides to look Sherlock in the eyes for this part, a thought that’s been in his mind whenever he was drawing Sherlock. “You are- you are my muse.” He finally declares, and he embraces himself for the reaction to come.
Every single of John's drawings is him.
) the sketchbook.
When he was a kid he used to bring some pieces of paper and a few coloured pencils to everywhere he went. He would sit wherever he could, even laying down on the concrete, to start his dedicated commitment with the noble art. Little John, could spend hours and hours with his tongue sticking out in the corner of his mouth, just drawing whatever his powerful infantile imagination would tell him to.
, says his own mind, but now he sees it. Every single drawing is of him: the joined hands are his when he is on his mindpalace, the flock of dark curls are his, the eye staring back is his fierce look when he is in Deduction Mode, and all the human figures are him: looking at a corpse in a crime scene, bending over his microscope, holding his violin ready to play...
“So if I’m having a full conversation with you…”
And it's stunning.
Of course Sherlock has noticed John has picked up drawing. And, sincerely, he's very happy for him. He knew about that old hobby and now that he's drawing again, John's even more charming...
And, on the contrary that many would think, the situation that John was in wasn't because he could not carry on without Sherlock. Yes, Sherlock was the most important part of his life. And the time that he was able to spend by his side was the best that John had ever experienced. He wasn't always happy with the mad detective. Of course not. He had cried of joy, and shout out of anger, he had laughed, he had felt. He had been
It can't mean what he desires to mean, what he desperately wants it to mean. Surely, there's a reason why John draw him that didn’t not involve any kind of sentiment. It is not possible.
And then, then he sees it. Sherlock’s eyes are looking at him like he draw them in the portrait.
What is the point in providing help to a man who doesn't want to keep on living?
“Oh God” it was true. John knew the little girl. He had seen her. He had met her many years ago. In one particular day in Afghanistan. While he could barely move looking at the sky, begging to a God to let him live, although now he was doubting of his existence.
He talks then, cutting Sherlock’s rambling: “Sherlock, I-I’m sorry.” His voice just above a whisper. “I perfectly understand that you’re mad and you want me to stop…”
What he finds in the following pages leaves him confused. It's a series of human figures, just constructive lines, in different positions: crouching looking something at the floor, bending over something unidentified, holding something against his shoulder... The thing is every human figure seems like a male figure. Sherlock frowns. It doesn't make sense. If John is drawing his new girlfriend in all the other pages, why now he's drawing male figures?
“Sherlock, look what I've got.” John says closing the door. For some reason he wants to share this thing with his flatmate. This small victory to his past.
I am so sorry for the delay, I'm a procastinating piece timeloser. But better late than never, right?
But it only lasted an instant, before darkness came to claim him. When he woke up in the hospital bed, he couldn’t remember any of it.
John is standing out of the new art shop placed in the corner of the same street as the clinic where John works.
As Sherlock reads in John’s expression the horror that the man is feeling he reacts at last. “Look, John, I- I…” But John isn’t listening, he can’t stop his racing mind. God, he found out. You are a creep, John Watson, and now Sherlock knows it. This is bad, this is very bad. Fuck, what must he be thinking? Who draws his flatmate without even them knowing? If there was a infinitesimal opportunity to have something with Sherlock, you just crushed it into nothingness. And now, of all times, his father’s words came clear as water to him. They resonate inside him, bringing him back to the little scared boy he once was.
John would be lying if he said that that came as a surprise. Somehow he knew, somewhere deep down, he already knew that the end was near. It was not that he sensed that he was going to die, it was just that he didn't see the point in living. In fact, he would very much prefer ending all of this, his life, rather than continuing living this pointless existence. That's why he was keeping everybody far from him, because he knew that these kinds of thoughts would be scary for any sane person that would listen to them, the thing is that John didn't find them scary, they were simple and plain facts. And, possibly, that would have scared the visitor more than the thoughts by themselves.
She’s got the brightest red hair John has ever seen and the prettiest eyes well, the second most beautifull, she always dresses in baggy white clothes. She’s always looking at him, and smiling at him. The image of the girl wasn’t as clear at the start. In the beggining, he only could catch glimpses of her: her red hair, her shy smile.
One day, when John finishes one of his last pieces, a close up portrait of Sherlock, he sighs. I'm so screwed he thinks as he closes the sketchbook.
Sherlock puts his arms around John’s waist and holds him in place, and something says that it’s not just for the time, Sherlock means it forever. The kiss deepens.
But his fingers start itching and when he realises it, he has already opened the sketchbook. He sighs.
John knew he was depressed. John knew he was suicidal. John knew he
(See the end of the chapter for
By the third drawing, an eye staring back, Sherlock feels a spank of jealousy. It's an extremely detailed drawing and it's clear John is copying someone's eye. It's done with so much care. Every line in its perfect place, so much precision. There was just only one explanation and it makes Sherlock's heart ache. John has a new girlfriend. Maybe it was her who gave John the idea to start drawing again. Sherlock is about to close the sketchbook and forget about everything, specially about one doctor in particular who, apparently, can't stop thinking about.
And the penny drops. The train of thought of John halts as his eyes land in the sketchbook between Sherlock hands. John stays stock still, trying to process the situation.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It means that you’re very close to death, John Watson.”
John leans completely in, and reaches for Sherlock’s lips and seals them with his own. He lets out a little sigh of relief and is able to hear a soft humming that’s definitely not coming from him.
Sherlock's heart starts beating faster, and he traces the lines of his portrait with his fingertips, just a light touch, just to make sure it is really there and he's damned heart it's not imagining it.
seek help.
John doesn’t seem able to move on, neither does he want to. He starts to allucinate. Against what everyone would expect, he thinks one day, he doesn’t see Sherlock,
It's his portrait.
John’s now able to hear Sherlock talking, but he just registers the man’s voice, no what he’s saying, why would he do that? Instead he hears his father talking inside his head. He’s probably rambling and looking for a nice way to ask you to stop. He wants you to leave him alone. I told you, Johnny, I told to man up, but you didn’t listen to me and now look what happened. He saw right trough you, all your ridiculous and absurd feelings for him, and he’s uncomfortable with your presence, with you.
He finds Sherlock sitting in his armchair. Eyes closed and finger tips touching lightly his lips. “Mindpalace” crosses John's mind, that's enough to make John's heart to stop aching.
He sits in his own chair in front of the consulting detective. He observes him for a little while, fondness invades his heart and a silly smile plays in his lips. He has a sudden urge to draw. He doubts, he shouldn't do it. He definitely shouldn't draw Sherlock, even less without him knowing it. This is a terrible idea and he won't do it.
The thing is that John hasn't shown Sherlock not even one of his drawings, and Sherlock is curious. Very curious. The detective thinks it's because John believe the drawings are not good, just sketches, but how could anything made by the doctor not be good?
One day, when it had been months since John had put a feet outside of 221b or had let anyone put a feet inside of 221b. She appeared in front of him. Always with that little smile. Now, John knew, he was so far down that he might even be able to speak to her. So he gave it a shot.  “Who are you?” voice just above a whisper. “You already know me, John” she smiled again.
But now. Now he remembers. He remembers how she only appered when he was about to die.
“Are you… Are you God?” he mumbles.
“Oh no! You silly. I’m your protector” the girl laughs. “We protect humans during their life and show them their way through death.”
“Hey, Sherlock” John’s voice come from the door, “please tell me there’s no case on tonight” now he’s climbing up the stairs, but Sherlock doesn’t even notice, “I’m exhausted, how does some takeaway sound?” and, at last, John enters the living room. Sherlock snaps his head up and stares at John with impossible wide eyes. Like a kid caught doing something bad.
So here is the grand finale. Hope you like it!!
Then all clicks in place.
The first drawing it's a pair of hands, joined by the tips. It's just a rough sketch, and the line seems a little irregular, as if John was not completely sure about what he was doing.
He’s so immersed in the drawings that he doesn’t even hear the sound of keys and John returning home from work.
But, just like a fool, his heart does not believe that part entirely. There’s a part of him that still hopes for it to be real. For the reason to be that John wanted to draw him, not just because for reference. He returns once more to his portrait. That look staring back at him. Sherlock places a hand at his chest, just over his racing heart.
Sherlock, despite what he may say about responsible usage, soon became dependent on his seven-percent solution. Reality and imagination became blurred, and every time he tried to cut back, withdrawal would hit him like a high-speed train and he’d cave in. He also tried morphine on several occasions, but nothing felt like cocaine.
“Just don’t let things get to you. Pretend there’s a wall, and you can’t hear what the others are saying. Words only have power if you let them have power, so simply don’t let them.”
“Jim, would you like to be my partner? I am a Holmes.” Moriarty considered this for a few seconds.
Sherlock became more and more withdrawn. He turned in even less homework and papers, his grade kept afloat only by his exam scores. Outside of classes, he only left his room when investigating something. He barely graduated in the spring, and though his whole family attended the ceremony and made a big deal of how proud they were of him, he didn’t feel like celebrating.
“So, are you a fresher, too?” asked Victor. Sherlock nodded. “What’s your major?”
“No, Sherlock, you did great,” said John. “I was just worried for you. But you’re fine, so there’s no reason to still be angry.” Sherlock gave a small smile that grew as John pulled him into a hug. “And you’re wearing the costume!” John drew his sword and poked him with it. Sherlock hissed jokingly in response.

It didn’t take John very long to figure out what the paper was saying. Back right. He showed this to Greg, and they made their way to the back right corner of the lot.
“Sure, we can be friends. Who’s your favorite superhero?” Mycroft grinned, proud of himself and excited to tell his parents.
“Bury three barrels of gunpowder? Red lion?” Lestrade scrunched his face in confusion.
“You’re not comfortable with who I am,” said Sherlock, tone changing from worried to icy in a snap.
“I was asking how militarism was aided by the Industrial Revolution, Sherlock,” said the teacher in an irritated voice.
“Business. Um, do you need to see someone about that?” he asked, pointing to the mangled ankle.
BURY COURT (1)
“Sherlock.”
It was the first day of the new school year. Sherlock arrived and took his usual seat in the back. He was watching all the students come in and take their seats as well when a new kid walked in. He was stocky and athletically-built. He had short hair and clearly played football. He took the seat directly in front of Sherlock, who immediately straightened up and smiled automatically. The boy smiled back and sat down. Sherlock’s stomach flopped. A few seconds later, his smile faded and then he realized he didn’t mean to smile. Why would he do that? He never smiled at school. He suddenly became aware of his increased heart rate and clammy hands. He felt like he was perspiring more than usual. This was not normal. He’d have to consult his books, or possibly the library computer.
When school got out, Mycroft was the first to be picked up by Mummy, and then the two drove to fetch Sherlock. When they pulled up to the building, they were early, and had to wait a few minutes before kids started leaving. They couldn’t spot Sherlock anywhere. The kids were almost all gone, and yet Sherlock was nowhere to be found. Mycroft, suspecting the worse, entered the building. He walked as fast as he could (no running) down the halls, looking for his little brother. He was on the verge of losing it when suddenly, from the restrooms, he heard a really quiet sob.
“Just someone in my class. I told him his dad was having an affair with someone and he got mad.”
“Alright, you can stay.” A blanket came seemingly out of nowhere and hit his side. Sherlock picked up the filthy thing and examined it. It seemed warm enough, though it smelled ghastly. He accepted the gift and found a spot on the floor to sleep on, though he didn’t actually get much sleep. Sherlock stayed in the den for a week before the other visitors grew suspicious. He wasn’t doing any hard stuff, only the cigarettes, which was strange.
“Yes, quite sufficient.” He leaned over and put his arms around John.
"Do what?" John asked, looking away from the screen.
“Provincetown - or P-Town - is a very openly gay-friendly town. I was thinking two of us pose as a couple and chat up some residents while the other one looks for clues.”
“Yes, during the summers it was almost every day.”
“You don’t care?”
“What is this? I thought you were in danger!” John said, a bit upset that he had been deceived into thinking something was wrong.
“If you ever do anything like this again - you better not, but if you do - , make me a list. A list of everything you take and how much.”
“Mummy would wonder where you were, and get angry with me for losing you.”
“I’m going out,” he called over his shoulder as he left the house.
“No, I didn’t mean that, I-”
“Why’d you kick me?”
“And there it is.” Sherlock scrunched up his face, confused.
