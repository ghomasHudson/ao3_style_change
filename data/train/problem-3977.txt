He was lying flat on his back underneath a tiny sink in the kitchen of the church. The water pressure was weak and the culprit could be any number of things. Charlie was running late, which she warned him she might, so he ended up groping the pile by his thigh without looking.
What, World War 1? he did not ask as he followed her. She pointed a gnarled hand at a narrow door. “There.”
Charlie brought three of the tiny bowls and set them out. “Remember, set your used spoons aside and take advantage of the snacks in between.”
The kid’s cheeks turned very pink and his voice cracked. “Excuse me, those are the rules. Don’t make me call security!” He seemed to puff out his chest when a few guys with cameras the size of a small house turned his way.
Roseview was an understatement, there was every shade of red, pink, white and yellow blossoms surrounding the place like there was a sleeping princess inside. He followed her with some dread as they walked up the worn cement steps and she pulled out a key to unlock the sturdy wood door.
“Says Single. Look, she has a lot of pictures up of unusual cloud patterns. Oh, she posted one up of the library about an hour ago. It’s grainy, but it’s definitely the library.” He would know. “You know, if you need closure...”
“It’s ten in the morning.” Sam frowned at him, but he steered them toward a big building. “They have a vending machine here.” He hits the button for water both times, despite Dean’s protest a Pepsi would cool him off much better.
“No, no,” he reassured, “I was simply inhaling the smell of coffee. Go ahead and ask, I’m an open book.” He smiled as he sipped the hot liquid. Which, in retrospect, was a dumb idea.
“Hmm. Are you thinking about getting out there now?” Jo asked delicately, staring at the straw she moved about in her soda.
He looked at Cas and there was a curve to that mouth touched with pink and fullness, especially the bottom lip.
It was the only Cas name. While yes, Cassie could have dropped out last year, that really didn’t make sense, did it? None of it made sense because she couldn’t cook, didn’t know how to lift a hood let alone understand what was under it, and she sure as shit wasn’t able to build any machine that didn't come with instructions.
“I...I want..I mean, I’m asking...” Oh god his back was drenched in sweat and it was a breezy night. “Cas,” he started again firmly, the back of his neck heating up at all the faces turning toward them.
Dean peeked over his shoulder at the blonde girl helping serve. Pretty enough, but to his twenty-three year old gaze she looked like a baby. And he wasn’t going to put business over pleasure, not with such venue in such a central location. “What daughter?”
She smiled, then seemed to realize they had an audience of one curious, blue eyed priest. “Father Castiel!” She wrung her hands and looked around. “The offer is for you too. If you attend dinners. Or want to, at my dinner.”
A part of Dean was fighting this, but it wasn’t the most insistent or strong-willed part. He was too busy making noises comparable to Cas eating a burger, deep moans as a thigh slid between his and pressed just right.
He washed his hands and splashed water on his face, letting the cool drops run down his neck as he came back into the small room. Cas was still there, surprisingly enough, standing closer by the sofa.
While they wait he heaved a big sigh as he pulls out his phone. “Damn Mark, can’t manage shit,” he muttered.
Dean hadn’t quite finagled himself a personal whole pie, but he did joke with her that there might be only two pie plates offered to the general public.
“Even priests have extracurricular hobbies.” Cas said rather primly, how he managed in that gravelly voice was a mystery. He passed the bottle back.
“We all forget ourselves in pain. Are you all right?” He was really close, eyes trained on the likely bruising skin. He ran a thumb along Dean’s eyelid. “Can you look upward for me?”
He nodded as if he lived in houses his whole life, or even just more than one for a handful of years before he could really remember it. “Sounds great.”
Dean sighed happily, but he stopped and looked over his shoulder. “I want you here for this. You should experience this part of your son’s life, if nothing else.” Maybe that was too bold or blunt, but he was a man on a mission.
“Then perhaps you should call her yourself,” Dean said shortly as he grabbed several cans of soup and chili, heading to the back and checking out the frozen food section. Bradford was behind the counter when Dean dumped an armful of microwaveable foods on it.
But the voice, the hoarse and masculine voice, that made him think of the unimpressed male with the strong jaw and air of restless energy.
Then he eyed the last part of the recent email and pulled out his phone as he packed up and threw away the messy wax paper lining the bottom of the plastic tray.
The woman practically wrenched the paper out of Jesse’s hand and threw it on the porch. “No, thank you,” she said icily before slamming the door. Okay. Most likely not Ben, but he felt for the poor kid anyway. People who weren’t tolerant of one thing tended to be rigid in lots of other progressive issues.
I really want to respond to everyone but don't want to artificially bump up my Comments numbers! But I read every single one and am determined to push this to the end for you guys!!
“Stop,” Dean hissed, snatching up his blade and slashing it in the air around him. “He’s mine.” He growled at the particularly bold ones, his eyes as hot and heavy in his sockets as the coal black they became.
Castiel sat on the padded seat in the confessional, studying at the engravings on the wood door. His fingers ran over the rosary over his other hand, hours of staring at the same point numbing him.
It took a few moments to differentiate between the crowd and the groups, which all had matching jackets. A gathering of white caught his eye.
Sam smiled and started to move, but Dean waved a hand. “Sit by me. Sam has a guest coming.” He waggled his eyebrows at Benny to let him know what kinda guest.
“Hey Pastor,” the man took the few steps two at a time and stopped with a calloused hand held out. “My name’s Benny Lafitte.”
He wouldn’t have fit in with the binge-drinking, panty-raiding type of jocks anyway. Hell, Dean didn’t fit in with them. One would push things too far, he’d deck them and be kicked out the frat.
Dean stopped and did a double-take, rather offended. He kept Benny’s beat and didn’t hit one wrong note. He’d have pointed that out, but instead just trudged to the back. He didn’t want to hear any truth’s right now. Truth was not working for him at all.
Cold sweat trickled down Dean’s back, though he didn’t know why he was nervous. He’d faced off with big guys, guys with knives or guns in the course of his lifetime. It didn’t make sense that another man, who resonated calm, should make him stop cold.
“Then drink some friggin’ milk princess, I’m getting a free burger.” Dean said as he pushed open the glass door to the place.
Jo turned pink as she watched the slow death of their nice time. “Bella is the new HR person. She’s implemented a lot of good changes.” The last part came out awkwardly, like it was a big fat lie. But the reason Jo hadn't said no to an extra person at lunch became clear.
Okay, so maybe Cas thinks Dean is hitting on him and not giving him advice about Sam. Cas is completely oblivious to Sam liking him. That made sense, Cas didn’t not grasp things right away, that was easy enough to tell.
Dean looked everywhere else, but that seemed to be exacerbating the problem. Without staring at his very masculine features, his body surged at the proximity. It was a damn good thing his jeans hid most of the evidence that some parts of him really liked this. So Dean made himself look right at Cas, willing the difference in gender to become clear to his traitorous body.
Dean didn’t know about all that. He couldn’t think of one time he equated ‘pleasures’, with a partner or alone, as being Godly. But then he was an atheist wolf in a holy sheep’s clothing, wasn’t he? And there was the small matter that he wasn’t actually gay. “It was a church matter, anyway. He broke Edith’s bulbs and I replaced them, so he offered to pay back the money.”
Normally Dean would go into descriptions of exactly what he pictured her doing on her knees, but he pulled back the reins a little. She was being playful and doe-eyed, figuratively, he had to do tit for tat.
Once he set down the empty bottle everyone was really staring at him. Not just him but Cas, back and forth in suspended anticipation. Feeling as if he just started blaring porn, Dean risked a look at Cas.
Sam swore he was sure this was the right place, tracking credit cards and video footage all pointed to this being his last and final stop. It was tiny and isolated, no surveillance to hack into, and one sheriff and two deputies. Dean had to admit if he were hiding out he’d pick here too.
Cas slanted a look at Dean, that familiar twitch lifting the corner of his mouth. “I have had ceremonial wine before.”
“I’m...afraid I don’t know much about tools.” He watched the trail of Dean’s fingers along the metal handle.
Until the door opened. “Hey, I saw the others leave.” Sam smiled, because Sam didn’t suspect that Dean was a...a boyfriend stealer. Or at least kisser. Besmircher, in Sam words. His brother saw the bottles in both of his hands. “Is this a bad time?”
He steeled himself to reiterate all the arguments he had prepared in his head that nobody else had brought up yet.
“That’s what you do when a guy falls behind! You’re playing with the big boys tonight.” He grinned, moving his head to the beat. The music was still hard, just the way he liked it.
The other girl, with short brown curls, subtly nudged her sister as she stood beside her. “Excuse my sister. My name is Bela.”
“I am able to attend the cinema if I wish.” His voice was a bit stiff now, not quite offended but perhaps awkward.
He imagined in an isolated place like this people already had their gardens long since finished and already did bake sales for the schools. Not many people made candy though, he was sure of that.
Frank interest showed more on Ruby’s face, though Abbie was clearly in this competition. Abbie spoke first, “Speaking of drinks, our grandfather has a microdistillery that he’s been running since before the Kansas Prohibition. It would go great with the...chili.”
“Hey, I could remove those bits instead.” He poked at the angel’s side with the blade. “You should show me some respect.”
“Why?” Dean took a deep drink, the burn treating him much better than anything he ate today that wasn’t a cracker.
Benny did linger after he handed over the paper. “Hey um, I don’t suppose she mentioned my history, did she?”
Indeed there was a tiny salt and pepper shaker set on the otherwise empty counter. After that was finished he recited the directions to the grocery store that he looked up and locked his door on the way out.
Nowhere near the full curves Dean’s lips had, he’d certainly been complimented enough on his mouth to feel a bit of pride when he gave an outrageous smile and flirty wink. His favorite bit of praise was ‘biteable’. Didn’t understand it till he looked at Cas’s mouth.
“Abbie,” her sister coughed then held out a hand with a big smile. “My name is Ruby. It’s so good to make your acquaintance.” She wrapped her fingers around his once he moved to shake her hand. She did not pull away. “You must come in for coffee.” “Or tea.”
“Yep,” Dean plucked two beers out of Gabe’s hands and took a seat on the couch and dared, dared Sam to say anything. He’d ride this shit-train to the ground.
Gus grunted in the affirmative as he pulled out a key ring the size of a small child’s head and squinted at the numerous keys. Finally inserting the right one into the lock, he opened the door and didn’t say anything as Dean followed him through the door in the back.
“I don’t care, it’s all water under the bridge now. Some people just aren’t ever going to come around.”
Of course Sam complained the whole time to JJ Burgers about how they didn’t have healthy options on the menu.
In fact, Sam was so busy being diligent that his poor neglected boyfriend was currently sitting on a stool and staring at his phone. He didn’t even type much, he just...stared. Embarrassed too, probably because he was being ignored.
Charlie brought him food during her lunch break, amused at his obvious enjoyment of the burger from Conner’s. “I told him no hot stuff.”
Cas’s hand tightened around both of them as his movement stuttered as well, liquid heat splattered and soaking into both their skin and jeans. But it didn’t matter, because that was the...the most amazing, toe-curling orgasm he ever had and this could technically be only considered third base. Imagine if he got him in a bed with all the time in the world.
She stopped laughing. Immediately, she began to pick at a nonexistent loose thread on her sleeve. “I think he has his own recipes.”
The door opened in the middle of his sentence, but it was just Castiel with two beers. He ducked his head a bit, but Dean accepted the offered bottle without taking note really.
As Benny held the mic to announce the second song, Trapped For a Year, a spot of white caught the corner of his eye. Dean moved to get a better look, surprised to see that guy Sam had been talking to by the library. He was still wearing the hoodie, the front black and pure so no chance of seeing the back. His hair was just as messy as before and the dim lighting barely hid the flash of blue eyes raised toward the stage.
“I was just checking to see if it was non-alcoholic. It is right in front of the store, after all.” Dean felt very conscious of his jeans and leather jacket over a grey button down and black undershirt. He was pretty sure that ministers didn’t dress up all the time though.
Castiel looked between them with a beer held loosely between his fingers, uncertainty written all over his face.
On the way out he grabbed a cookie from the delicate china. He munched on it as he climbed into the Impala. It was really good. He was definitely going to suggest she bring pie on Saturday.
Both looked thoroughly confused as they looked around. The oldest finally cottoned on and saw his mom, still standing there looking as if she had on a poofy skirt made out of plastic lumps.
There was a reason why he hit up almost every Food Challenge restaurant nearby while on the road. A young man just had a big appetite for all things. That brought his thoughts back around to certain careers where a man wasn’t allowed to have an appetite for anything good in the world.
Next chapter up soon! Hope you're all enjoying! And to the review that pointed out my comment count doesn't matter, touche. I'll be responding to reviews posthaste! :D
“Excellent. Mr. Hoyt will be dropping off his whiskey samples this afternoon and I promised to run down to Edith’s to price out how much replacing her wiring is going to cost. Just stick around till he gets here.” It seemed prudent to prevent any more cases of exploding bulbs and glass that he had shamefully ran off without helping with. He could claim being distracted, but he would have to further examine what distracted him.
Crowley sat back in his chair with an amused look, fingers entwining over his abdomen. “Looks like someone tipped off the clergy. The other clergy, of course.”
Dean grinned at Cas. “I’m so glad your parents got to see this.” He waved at them and smiled at Cas.
“Not quite my speed, but thank you.” Dean wasn’t sure if he should be acting more competitive since he was here to nab away some of the numbers.
Dean smirked, he knew she couldn’t stay away. He was disappointed she missed his pounding performance out there, he knew he looked good out there. He was a good looking guy all the time, but girls professed all the time he became downright sexy up on stage.
The silence stretched on and on between one disapproving face and the other utterly intense. One was making him angry, and the other was making him hot. And that was frustrating on so many levels.
But now that she’s about to graduate, she takes his money and time all summer then drops him like a rock. ‘
“Eight.” He stared at her and sighed. Well, at least he wouldn’t get stage fright. “All right, I’m going to look around and make a list of items I’ll need. You hit up the flock, then the store. I’m going to bed, wherever that is.”
“Sure.” Or not time on the stakeout. Nobody went to church at 7 am on a Tuesday anyway. He scribbled down the address, glad he kept a small stack of plain cards with his phone number on it. ‘Lady with tools’ he added underneath it and slid it in his back pocket. “Call you after.”
He took pity on her because he was just that kind of upstanding guy. “She asked how you were and said that you looked tired at the cook-off.”
It made Dean wonder how long Sam had been seeing him and why did he hide it? Did he think Dean would be mad at him? While he was straight as an arrow himself, nothing wrong with preferring strudel to pie. As long as the baker was good to his little brother, he had no problem with it.
Dean brushed his hands away from the controls lest they end up listening to new-school Creed or something. “Hey, Cas is a nice guy.”
“Here’s my number.” He held out a plain white card to her with hastily scribbled information. “So we don’t have to talk through email anymore.”
It was a decent sized place, lots of modern art for a place that threw a cow leg on the grill for consumption, but whatever.
Sometimes he didn’t call till eleven and Dean kept him up till at least one, sharing thoughts and...feelings too.
Sam turned and pointed at him. Guy turned to look, and Dean found himself startled by the electric blue of his eyes, even at this distance. He raised a hand in a wave.
“Oh. I didn’t know…” She trailed off and tried to salvage her gross lack of knowledge about her own son’s life. “That’s nice to hear. It seems like yew two are very serious.” She had a slight accent.
Dean pushed between two cute honeys to lean against the bar, throwing a wink at the blonde one of the pair. She smiled and rolled her eyes as she picked up her drink and tugged her friend away. Probably dating each other, he thought as he watched them go. “Hey Sammy, I made room!” Because of course Sam was making his way through.
It took a minute but the potato was placed in his fingers. Dean shoved it around the broken glass and twisted until the socket came out. “Take this.” He lowered it and waited till his hand was empty before taking off the fixture.
Dean fidgeted, knee bouncing as he thought. So candy was out. “I was thinking of having another community event to introduce myself to a larger number of people. Have you tried a...bake sale?”
Sammy was a sophomore in college and acing it, something Dean was especially proud of. That was great. Heck, their grandfather Samuel had even paid for his tuition. Sam took after the man, after all, always had his nose stuck in a book.
His phone finally buzzed and while the picture was small on his tiny screen, it looked marvelous and homemade.
“He’s a bit geeky, but he’s all right. Your lifestyle is your choice is my point.” If only he had known before this, he could have thought about what he would say beforehand instead of spewing things that could have featured on Lifetime.
Instead of continuing to stroke at the bared cock, he popped his jeans open with a thumb to free his own.
This was it. This is how a man became a man, and possibly got arrested too. Dean pushed past the kid, who squawked, and walked in a straight path. The people in white parted for him, some less than willingly, until Dean was in front of Cas and Cas was in front of him.
The houses were as different as could be, some looked like tiny cottages from a magazine and others had maybe two patches of grass and broken vehicles sitting in the cracked driveways.
The other was not nearly as earnest as the boy, but at least he listened, smiling in some places and wondering attention at others. The attitude of this penitent fit the longer haired man more.
Dean carefully ran the cheap safety razor along his jaw, removing three days worth of of stubble. Underneath was tan skin and a dusting of freckles, both caused from constantly being outdoors.
No, they hadn’t met each other after years and years of friendship, you crocodile. “Oh, uhh, they’ve met a few times. I think they think of each other like brother and sister though.”
As she seats them, Sam tugs on his sleeve like a damn five year old. But it makes sense in a second, Cas is entering the restaurant.
An engineer who could build killer robots? His eyebrows rose high and nodded with an impressed air to himself as he slid his phone face up again.
They got a damn big cheer and calls for an ovation after the last song, Letting Go of You. Dean traded a look with Benny and he announced one of their more popular hits, God is Bisexual. It was dirty and loud and Donny got to bring the house down with an extended solo.
. After plying them with wet strokes until spit was leaking down his palm, Dean drew Castiel’s hand down his shirt. “We were talking about forgiving me?”
“Whatever.” Dean wandered off to the shade and dumped the last half of the bottle over his head. From the cement bench he could see Sam waving to someone coming down the steps. For a moment that same wrench twisted his stomach, but then the other person came into view.
Oh man. He wished he had Sammy type up something for that. Why did this case have to involve a kid? He couldn’t just say ‘fuck it’ and walk away because he was uncomfortable sometimes. “Uh, you know, that’s a good question. One I’ve answered before, because people wonder that sometimes. It may not make sense at first, but it’s true to me.” He babbled on like an idiot because words wouldn’t stop and he was still thinking.
Dean shook his hand, thinking the man would look more suitable in a mafia ring or a drug deal. Maybe it was the suit. “Dean Paxton.”
“I also gave him, uh, a flyer for Saturday. If you could, spread the word.” He almost winced at his use of the phrase. Focus back on track, Dean, focus. “I should get back to measuring these. I think I’m going to replace all of the with PVC pipes, at least whatever we can afford.”
“Sure, then Cas can definitely show up too.” Dean grinned at him, not really sure why he reiterated the invitation. He was gratified to see Cas quirk an eyebrow back at him.
“Pastor Paxton!” She stopped at the curb, waiting for him to come around before shaking his hand with a firm grip. “Or should I call you that? I know you said you’re informal and we’ll be working together a lot, so.”
“I look forward to talking to you every night. I love hearing a text sound because I hope it’s from you. I know that we haven’t had much time together, but we will. I’m moving down here when you go start school again, and I hope you’ll move in with me.”
He changed into a clean white shirt and a flannel, soft, red, not see-through. Of course his plan was immediately ruined when on the way back out Benny splashed some water on him and laughed uproariously.
“Oh, sure.” They walked to his car so Dean could give him a scrap of paper. It was a good thing he kept a pad in his car, plus he often had to take numbers on a moment’s notice. Something was throwing him off lately though, like his head wasn’t in the right place.
Castiel choked on his beer, drawing Dean’s attention away from his phone. Oh man, was he being a bad host? Sam was clearly content with judging Dean silently while Castiel was patiently waiting for him. Maybe he could shake them at the bar.
I am not sure how to respond to reviews without bumping up my review count. :/ But I do read them and if anyone knows how to do so, I shall be more than happy to drop a note toeveryone, cause you all ROCK!!!!!
The building was clearly a church once upon a time, maybe when the settlers were still taking shits in the woods while wearing coonskin hats. Someone had painted it recently and hacked a rough path through the maze of rosebushes, so there was that.
Well, now Dean saw where Cas got his oblivious nature. She didn’t seem to understand his pointed comments.
Dean grated a sigh and rolled his eyes to the ceiling. “The chili was licking at my brain like the hounds of hell. I thought I was gonna die.”
The other man slowly placed his hands on each side of the burger, still watching him as if this was some trick.
“Uhh, Mark, he’s the new guy in the garage. Part time, needs a lot of help. Place can’t even run without me.” He fake laughed and quickly stepped around him to catch up with the others.
And Cas was back to looking surprised, but it was marked with a tender furrow of his brow. “Are you sure? You don’t have to make any promises.”
“Uh, I guess.” Dean jiggled his heel, knee bouncing repetitively. “Are you looking forward to graduating?”
“Whatever, bitch.” Dean threw himself on one of their plush sofas and stuck out his long legs. “So which one of these frats can I party at between gigs that isn’t completely lame-o?”
Dean rolled his eyes good-naturedly, he bet Sam covertly invited him while he was complaining sooo much. Couldn’t blame him, Dean was trying to get a peek at his ‘object of interest’ deep-throating food too.
“Please,” Novak started, “send any expenses accrued to St. Michael’s. This was my mistake. I would go along, but I must begin Daily Mass soon.”
Bella thought about this, tapping one long nail against her cheek. “No, I only saw him alone. It was the,” her voice dropped in a whisper, “the day.” Then she cleared her throat. “I hope he’s doing well. I saw my own mother waste away in the hospital, but at least we knew it was coming. A wonderful woman, my mother.”
The other man had wandered toward the fridge and peered in aimlessly. “Hmm, yeah. I’d say she gave me a couple extra,” he said dryly before disappearing out the door. He returned with a stack about half the size of a ream of paper. “I can only spare a few though.”
All this nervous energy could be poured into the show, he’d done it before, he would do it now. Loading the gear into the back was familiar and didn’t require any thought, it didn’t help. Pulling on his favorite pale green shirt that brought out his eyes didn’t make him feel better either. Cassie would probably think he was wearing it for her and laugh with all her stupid nerd friends.
Dean washed his face and dried it, picking up the phone for the four steps it took to get to the bed. He was in a motel at the tail end of their last case, a hunt for college girl who ran away with a cult. To him this wasn’t much different, except it involved a kid.
Dean was getting changed into some sleep pants when he heard Sam typing away again. “What’re you doing?” he asked narrowly, paranoid now.
He shook his head. “There will be no tearing apart of anything here. Besides, I’m pretty sure tempting a priest is a first class ticket to hell and a painful one at that.”
“I located two people of their description in Lebanon, Kansas. Seems fitting, she said he’s very religious now.”
In staring at the new couple, he noticed the guys in white had writing along their back, TEAM ANGEL. He searched and searched for Cassie, trying not to look back at his brother still talking in close to Cas, practically in his damn ear.
“I would like that. A home-cooked meal sounds great. Just nothing spicy, please.” Even if he couldn’t do anything about it, he could be flattered by her shyness.
“Oh! You’re Miss Stella's daughter.” Suddenly Bella reached over and patted her hand, the nails clacking on the table. “I’m so sorry about your mother. I remember seeing you in the picture frames around her bed.”
“Oh, Abbie is definitely the cook of the family. I guess she got the brains and I got the looks.” Ruby giggled as she trailed her fingers down her neck.
Crowley nodded and looked around the large park and all the activity going on. “For future reference, it takes about two weeks to authorize a permit for the park.” He looked back at Dean with a strange smile.
“Slow? Jesus wasn’t dead when this place was built.” Oops. He waited for the shock and horror, but she just giggled.
The other guys all clearly liked Cas, talking to him eagerly and one handed him a huge remote control. When the coordinator came around to call groups away, Cas tagged along with
“Oh?” Dean snorted, idly digging his fingers into the shredded meat over the angel’s heart. “Going to ‘grip me tight and pull me out of perdition’, are you? Bullshit, tell me another one.”
Dean missed his mouth with the end of the burger. It smeared along the side of his cheek and he quickly wiped it off, searching for another napkin.
Hope you're all enjoying this! I'm taking a moment announcing the a new fic will be starting shortly after this one.
Castiel tore his eyes away from Dean and his green eyes and smile, brighter than a hundred candle flames casting their smoke up to an endless sky. He tried to focus. The topic was important, perhaps the most important discussion he’d ever had.
Dean slouched in the booth, tapping away with one hand. She had a brother? Okay, maybe Sam had a point with all his questions, he really didn’t know anything about her.
He looked dubiously at the steeple high above all the buildings. “Maybe we should just drive, I don’t need to stretch my legs that much.”
“Oh, I hear that so much.” Charlie smiled brightly. “I remember he told me he came in a few times with Lisa, my sister with dark hair?”
Dean graciously let the lie pass unchallenged, he was magnanimous like that. “I'll stick with the band tonight. See you tomorrow morning.”
Pink-cheeked, the rough hewn man waved a man. “No, not that.” He chuckled, the brevity seeming to help. “I mean, why did you become a Minister then? The two aren’t a widely accepted combination.”
“No, I don’t mind sharing a bottle with you,” he said a bit stiffly, looking all around before peering at Dean out the corner of his eye. That was new. “You mentioned, um, being straightforward?”
He followed her, relieved that he wasn’t posing as a priest. He’d stepped in one a few times and they were long and complicated and he never knew what was going on. And what was with the incense?
He came with a choked gasp less than a minute after he began, spurting hotly against his fist and the underside of the steering wheel because he didn’t think he’d need a tissue yet. Hand still moving to wring every last drop out, he groaned and tilted his head back to bounce against the head of the seat.
Bradford didn’t say another word as Dean walked out, but he could feel the stare on the back of his neck as he went left instead of right.
He could never know Dean tasted his soon-to-be boyfriend. Cause Sam deserved someone like that, he deserved to be the first to lick the inside of that hot mouth and teach him how to moan like he did in the restaurant.
“Speaking of which.” In for a penny, he supposed. “I hung a flyer up in Taylor’s Market.” Not that it was any of his business, but if she cared about some dumb babysitter, which she clearly did, then she probably cared about her father too.
Some exhibits showcased off-road wheelchairs, Professor X looking, and another had a vest that let one feel music. He got to try on an adult sized one, but what really made it was the glow on the face of a kid happily signing away to his parents.
And there was a third guy with spiked dirty blonde hair and bright eyes. “Hey Magic Fingers!” He gave Dean an appraising look, but damned if the little guy didn’t go back to staring up at Sam in a way that was not just-friendly.
Crowley looked him up and down with a sneer, straightened out his collar, and walked solidly past Dean to let himself out. Out the tiny window Dean saw him turn sharply once past the fence and disappear out of sight.
Castiel took a total of three bites of the hamburger before steeling himself. He must speak candidly with Dean, but he also had to choose his words carefully.
The fuck? Dean started forward as Gabe backed up - never losing his smirk - and would have kept going, but a hand caught his arm.
She was definitely all over his junk. Hell, maybe he'd give her a preview of the show. He went to unbuckle his belt before his phone buzzed again.
“Grab me some beer!” He called to Scott after he got changed in the back, specifically pulling on a dark green shirt that wouldn’t show his chest no matter how much water got poured on it.
“Wear white and get it all wet when you’ve spotted a hole you want to fill. We get it, you have nipples.”
In the weird silence that followed Dean snuck his phone out. It would get even more awkward if she showed up with Sam here, but he was willing to deal with that. No message.
He munched on the crackers and grapes beside him, which apparently was to ‘cleanse the palate’ between tasting. They took their competitions seriously.
Dean held up the bottles to indicate he couldn’t shake hands and proceeded to finish off one after another. With the three of them watching. He didn’t care.
Fuck. The package Sam was sending wouldn’t be here for at least another day, depending if he splurged for Express. “What, no faith in a man of faith?”
When the two boys scampered to the car the door opened again, and the mother in question looked surprised as they grabbed bags and jostled each other as they went through the door she held open.
,” Dean crooned as he went down the hundredth hill with nothing but flat fields around him. The next high point of the road he saw it in the distance like a mirage brought on by suicidal boredom; buildings, real goddamn buildings. “
Dean stood up, trying to see around the crowd. Unable to see anything he ventured closer, stepping between the many bodies until he reached the inner circle. He wasn’t sure how Crowley knew, but the man was right.
He went to meet Benny, Donnie and Scott as they pulled into town. Dean was the lead guitarist of course, Benny on rhythm guitar and vocals, Scott did the electric bass, and Donnie was a beast on the drums.
That earned him a dirty look. Dean shrugged. “What can I say? It’s hard to understand a girl when her mouth is wrapped around--”
“Yes.” A trickle of unease ran down his spine. The old-fashioned booth was updated to block sound from both sides, logically he knew they weren’t alone. But the silence was thick and the isolation uncomfortable at the moment. “You start with the worst sins.”
“Look, the Wagon Bar serves wagon sized pizza and cold beer. We could be home early enough for you to get all your beauty sleep.”
She stopped and looked at him, lips parting in surprise. “For what?” It was the first stupid thing he ever heard her say.
Crowley had already tucked in and was writing on the first scorecard in wide block letters.  ‘A dull color with not much variation 4. A hearty aroma that whets the appetite, if lacking in spice 7. On the thick side, high meat ratio 5. As suspected, the ground beef overpowers the peppers 3. No lingering heat 3. Total 22.’
“You two have been very unobservant. I want you two to grab the rest of the groceries and help her put them away. Ask lots of questions if you don’t know where stuff goes.”
The last thing Castiel wanted to do right now was be in an open space with him right now. “I’m going to pass you several pamphlets on confession and other processes. Is that fine?”
Dean couldn’t say why or how or anything about what happened next. He couldn’t even be sure who moved, though he’d never really believe it was him. Or that it was Cas for sure.
He stepped back as if a shock sparked where they touched. It was the first time Cas used his name, and it made him feel...strange. “Stop that,” he growled, roughly grabbing Cas’s lower lip and raking his nails down.
“Hey, can’t he just travel forward in time and see the winner?” Dean joked as he tapped the last name. “Save us a lot of burnt tongues.”
“Why don’t you take a seat, man?” Dean used his foot to hook a chair leg and bring it around to the table.
He could have kissed her round cheek, finally, a solid lead. He wanted to run off and call Sam immediately just to celebrate, but had to hold off. Instead he stayed for another solid fifty minutes to chat and finish a soda and a slice of pizza that one team shared with him.
invited him out for burgers and kept asking for alone time. But Cas said he was attractive and agreed with being a tease so long it was a good thing.
While Dean was enjoying the attention and the fun everyone was having, Sam was not budging an inch. He even followed Dean in the bathroom like they were going to share lipstick or gossip or something. If he wasn’t so damn sure that once Sam graduated he’d basically never come back home he would have read him the riot act.
“I hate you,” he whispered as he withdrew his fingers and positioned the head with his hand. “You shouldn’t have waited. I’m broken now.” He pushed, and pushed until he was firmly gripped inside Cas.
He didn’t say anything. He had actually held the hand of people as they struggled through the unburdening, but this wasn’t one of those cases.
Was this guy for real? Dean moodily pulled from one beer, gaze drifting accidentally to Cas. Who was watching him. There was nothing hesitant or shy about it, he didn’t even flinch when he was caught. Maybe he meant to.
It took nearly a minute to get a response, but he clicked through his morning alarms so Sam wouldn’t cotton on when he kept peeking at the little screen.
“I’m gay.” Dean said flatly into his phone once he was safely ensconced upstairs. Heddy was a widowed thirty-something who was apparently part of his parish and most definitely did not flirt with him. She was pretty bangin’ for a middle-aged woman too.
Sam seemed to loosen up after that, not complaining once when his friends bought the next several rounds. They must have been familiar with Castiel already, as they greeted him with an impressed air.
The interior was open and spotless. The kitchen boasted handsome countertops and the couch had the soft sheen of leather that was well cared for. Not one item was extraneous.
It was a seven hour drive to Kansas so he filled up at a Gas n’ Sip and treated his Baby to a quick wipe down to remove grease stains and various litter. Baby was an oft rebuilt Impala ‘67, opened by his father and passed down to him. Some of his best times with his father were staring under its black hood, getting grease in the creases of his hands and small cuts cauterized with oil.
Sam was still too far from him. Of course when Dean turned his head there was Cas, head inclined toward him. “It’s not worth it, Dean.”
Dean watched Cas go to town as he distractedly took a bite of the edge of his own burger. Cas really took that advice to heart; the sides of his mouth were shiny where his tongue couldn’t reach it. He kept tracing his bottom lip and dipping in the corners of his mouth to catch all the flavor and why wasn’t Sam watching?! You could make the beginning of a porno out of this.
Percy nodded and shook his hand next, three firm pumps. “I’ll see you two later. Feel free to ask if you need anything.” He inclined his head toward Dean respectfully.
That was Dean’s mantra as he pulled his guitar out of its case. The location of their second gig was a more mellow place than the Roadhouse. The place was trying to drum up business for their new Music Madness Monday night and Benny shrugged and said it paid okay and had an open tab.
And that bothered Dean. He got up and took a seat right behind them, still smiling. “I’m actually his boyfriend.”
Dean nodded, heartbeat speeding up again. He looked over his shoulder at Cas’s parents, noting their confusion. It spurred on his determination.
Charlie blinked, follow his gaze and seemed to...blush as she tucked the same strand behind her ear. “Oh, that’s St. Michael the Archangel Catholic Church. Our church is this way.”
Cas was staring at him. Through all the noise and people and movement, his blue eyes never flickered or lowered.
He blew out a sigh, his thoughts were crowding all around his head in a confusing jumble right now. He had forgotten all about his former girlfriend or whatever she was.
It was a tense departure for Dean, but he didn’t hear a gun cocking behind his back so that was good. Once walking down the street again he hid the beer inside the bag. A place this size would take the news of his beer and turn it into him being a raging alcoholic who liked opium and orgies.
Dean stood up and gestured to his seat, brushing some crumbs off his lap and taking his one and a half beers left. Two may be acceptable to Cas, but it was gonna take at least two to avoid hospitalization.
“Um, sure.” Dean started clicking through Cassie’s Community pages as he waved Sam off. He felt like a stalker, kinda, but quickly forgot that when he snuck a beer out of his bag, cracked it in the bathroom with running water covering the sound. He drank as he found threads she posted on.
“The beer cans.” Dean explained, as if it should make perfect sense. “You’re in a frat house. Where’s the panties, the empty keggers, the groggy drunk chicks doin’ their walk of shame?” It was seven in the morning, maybe everyone was still passed out on a Friday morning.
Cas worked a hand between them, fingers pressed at the top of Dean’s jeans and suddenly half the constriction was gone. Oh, that took some skill. Any thought of protest froze as fingers wrapped around his aching cock. It took everything for Dean to keep his knees from buckling.
Maybe he should get some sleep, the beer was going right to his head. He texted her good night and thought of all the dirty things he'd send her tomorrow since she seemed so into it.
Castiel looked all around at the wooden walls and the door, then slowly at the lattice again. He placed his palm on the small divider just under the panel.
Dean dumped an entire water bottle over his head once they were in the back room with a comfy sofa and an adjoining bathroom. He shook his head briskly, splattering everyone with mingled sweat and water.
“Dean Paxton, Minister.” Dean held man’s hand for a brief pump and dropped his hand. The man had a grip like calloused brick.
Dean groaned as he palmed through his jeans. He was not imagining the words spoken in a deep voice. Maybe with a dark eyebrow raised and pink lips parted. Just like earlier.
He ignored that as he buttoned up his pants and pushed the door open. The noise and heat assaulted him from every direction, and at one point he was sure he saw Sam’s concerned face and his lips moving.
Sam had been wrong before. Okay, to be fair, not everyone knew who he was. Most of the churchgoers knew and he did have a prominent job, it was good, exciting gossip. Small towns thrived on gossip.
He heard the rustling but didn’t look as Cas straightened himself out. It came as no surprise that the clothes reformed themselves around the angelic body.
Nonetheless, he went down to the next house on the street and knocked. So it began, the endless rotation of knock, wait, possible open door and quick chat.
Broken out of his reverie of hazy images and hot prickles under his skin, he looked away from Cas. “I’m workin’ on it.” Dean muttered, taking a big mouthful and showing it to Sam on his tongue.
Dean had no choice but to say thank you and take a step back as the door closed. The problem with crazed stalker liars is they were very good at hiding who and what they were. So he had no idea if this was his guy or a guy who
Huge, state of the art, the type of place that people visited from out of state just to get the best care possible.
It wasn’t the first time one of them hit a rough patch and started drinking like they were 21 again. It just required careful maneuvering of the drunk person and possibly some standing outside bathroom stalls while vomit filled the toilet.
He wouldn’t say it slow and hesitant like that if the person wasn’t present. Score one for operation Get Sam a Date. “You know...” Dean angled his beer up and eyed the other bottles.
She got rather flustered. “Right. Thank you. I just, um, came over to, really I came over to invite you for dinner. To say sorry. And thank you, for talking to the boys. They really do need a man in their...not that I’m saying, I mean..” She floundered off, utterly thrown off.
“Oh yeah? Then why are you so eager to get out?” he said it even though he knew that wasn’t entirely fair. Sam was accepted at Wichita State University and actually attended, despite being everything that any college could hope for. The only reason he stayed in state, Dean was sure, was to stay close to home. That’s not what Dean wanted for his genius freak of a brother.
Dean picked up the six and ten-inch ones from under the sink and placed them in a row according to size. “The standard set has six to ten inches. This one,” he tapped the small one, “is for small jobs. If you have a big job, you can’t go wrong with ten inches. You know what I mean?”
“Sober up a little and I’ll drive you home, okay?” And he was going, obviously amused and not taking the words seriously at all.
Dean shoved the phone awkwardly in his tightened pants, making wide eyes and an innocent shake of his head. “Uh, yeah. Need any cash?”
Castiel slanted a glance at the lattice, even knowing he could be seen and could not see past it. “The sign of the cross. Have you ever attended Mass before?”
He let himself into the cozy digs and shoved everything in the fridge, cans and all. It wasn’t until he was sitting on the floral printed couch with a bowl of chili cheese fries and a beer that he realized there was no television against the wall.
He did continue to canvass the neighborhood, but each young guy didn’t quite fit the picture each time. Needless to say, it was a productive morning, but not for
“All right, all right, I’m sorry. But it was our way in and you were already freaking out. Just find the guy, call it in, and you can be out of there before the Sunday morning service.”
It was a short drive up to the tall church, which was even more grand once he was standing on its steps. Reminding himself that one, he was not intimidated, and second, there was no danger of lightning hitting him, he walked up to the huge double doors and opened it.
Sweat made it hard to crack open a bottle but he managed, lifting the heavenly brew and drinking it like it held the secret of life at the bottom. He knew people were staring. Maybe shielding their children’s eyes. Dean didn’t care, he was possibly about to die in some tiny bump in the road with its entire population goggling at him.
If Dean had ever thought he’d feel weird about this, it never happened. Not as he cupped another man’s erection, not while pushing the flaps aside and tugging the jeans down just enough so he could cup the heavy weight between Cas’s legs.
Charlie smiled and rolled her eyes. “He’s heard jokes like that a million times. He owns the diner we went to, Conner’s Diner?”
Dean still his tongue moving in a swallow. He quirked an eyebrow in confusion and snorted. “What are you even talking about?”
While Dean was stewing in the juices of his own too-big smile to show he didn’t care, Sam ordered a chicken sandwich without bread or mayo, and a side of celery and carrots they used for the wings.
“Ah.” This was as dry as the Sahara Desert at noon. His eyelids drooped lower as his gaze flicked down to the paper. “The church is very important to Ms. Middleton. Her great-grandfather helped build it, you see.”
, but fuck if it didn’t know. “I know what I look like. Don’t you dare think,” he grabbed Cas’s jaw and made him look at him while the hot agony filled his sockets, “that I won’t hurt you. It gets me off.”
A shudder worked through Castiel, starting at the back of his neck and working down his spine. The jagged intimacy of the voice left him hot and, shamefully, starting to get aroused. It wasn’t right.
She bit into her sandwich, enjoying the crisp lettuce, flavorful tomatoes, and thinly sliced meat. It had great food. The cafeteria did too, but this place also had the whole ‘not work’ aspect to recommend it. It was always jam-packed with hospital staff looking to escape for a bit.
“I’d throw water on it and hope for the best.” Cas sighed and opened his eyes, his mouth twisted in a rueful curve.
Charlie was handing each a small stack of scorecards and looking so happy chatting that he was loathe to disturb her. Her artist friend was setting up face painting under a green canopy, and another person was setting out small bottles, jars or sand, and brightly colored fuzz on corks.
“Hey Sam, if you want to invite Cas over while I’m here, that’s cool with me.” Openly, he silently said, instead of pretending they just ran into him. Dean was not born yesterday, he was far more perceptive than people realized.
Dean smirked. “Toodle-loo,” he murmured as he walked light-heartedly down the steps to the spotless cement path. See? He was just as pretty as the priest. Well, almost as.
Sam's face drops like when he was seven and his ice cream dropped in the dirt. “You’re right. I've been so--err, I just lost track of time.”
“Oh no, no we can't. Edith rules the town with her baked goods. The other ladies have long since given up on trying, if I’m going to be honest. The school tried it last year, innocent as you can be... There I had the worst cherry tarts I ever, even though I know May is a perfectly fine cook. So petty.”
“So, Sasquatch, you were saying that you work out on Thursdays? Cause I’m thinking I could use a squat partner.”
“It’s a movie. Ever see one?” He didn’t mean the question to come off rude, he just thought of them as kneeling and praying all the time. This was one of the strangest conversations he had ever had, and he met a lot of people in his lifetime. Usually in surreal situations. Like this.
“I’ve got four rules. Don’t get too drunk. Don’t break anything. No fights. And my daughter, Jo, is off-limits.”
He took out the two receipts out, smoothing them over a flyer and walking down the middle aisle. He didn’t see anyone, though he did try and glance under the two conjoining booths to the left to check for shoes. Confessional he figured, he knew that much from movies. Venturing closer, he saw the bottom of black robes descending down the stairs.
Lebanon was about thirty minutes from the North border, and not two minutes into the state his radio crackled. Grumbling, he hit the scan button to see what he could find.
He had skimmed through his history so that didn’t completely catch him off guard. “Yep, but uhh, God, he got me through it.”
He left the crumpled paper in case the kid could get out and take another look. Not cause he thought he’d see Jesse there, but it had his and Charlie’s phone number at the bottom.
Served her right. Dean held onto this thought as he stalked off in the other direction, looking for familiar street names. When his phone buzzed, he wasn’t sure what to expect at this point.
Dean teased him a bit longer about not being able to seal the deal, then they played video games and trash-talked for a while. It was fun, relaxing, and good god he missed Cas like crazy. They were in the same town and Dean couldn’t bring himself to walk over.
The oldest had dark brown hair with light blue eyes, well-fed but wiry looking. The youngest sported tender brown eyes and wild curls. Nostalgia tried to creep up, but it was squashed immediately.
“I’ve ordered it before,” Cas said simply, taking the paper napkin in his fingers, unfolding it, and placing on his lap neatly.
, as a funny side note, had a grumpy looking leader with a black suit jacket and red lettering. Grumpy guy came over to shake Cas’s hand with a very narrow look.
Had he came along with a car and rented a new place, hardly anyone would know enough to spread. But...one group in particular would be interested though.
The nerves made him jumpy, drumming an endless rotation on his knees and tapping his feet on the floorboards with small thumps until all three bandmembers threatened to make him walk the rest of the way.
The place didn’t have a television, so he pulled his ancient laptop on his lap and aimlessly perused the internet for a while. Cat video, cat video, religious ads. At some point he did get up and make a bowl of canned stew and treated himself to several of Edith’s cookies.
“Has this happened before?” Was that his voice? He cleared his throat and coughed once. “The...exploding?”
Castiel couldn’t remember the last time he had to explain the process. The priest of the church he grew up was very strict about how many times. He always said, count your sins
“But I had you watch---never mind. Um, it’s fine. Thanks for grabbing lunch. I’ll get it next time.”
“Sure, I’ll pick you up!” She began to clean up his mess as he head out the door. “Any type of food you want?”
he directed a look at his jeans. He didn’t need input about soft, firm lips and blues eyes so deep a person could drown in them. He just didn’t. Instead he focused on the loud patter of heavy raindrops thudding on the roof and walls of the place.
The in-law suite had furniture and nice, but old, dinnerware in the kitchen cupboards. She showed him around, dropped the key in his palm, and thanked warmly him for being there.
She dabbed her eyes and blew loudly into the handkerchief, then held it back out to...Crowley, that was his name.
He grinned at her, giving her a squeeze before moving away. “Relax, we’ll encourage moderation and safety. Why don’t you find a reliable sober driver to assist anyone needing it?”
“Yep. Sounds great.” He grabbed a list he wrote on a scrap of paper since he was heading up to the hardware store anyway. “I’ll grab a shower after I get this all finished with. Six okay?”
“There seems to be a problem down here.” The man said gravely in a voice that was as deep and gravelly as a lifelong lounge singer smoker.
Dean immediately opened another and downed at least half before he could talk without puffing out small fireballs. “I think you’re going to have one less judge.” He felt sorry for Charlie who was both resigned and also disappointed.
Dean shrugged. Actually, they were doing great. He never stopped thinking about the guy. Sometimes it was dirty. Okay, it was dirty a lot. Dean listened to that throaty damn voice every day for months.
Uhhh. Awkward silence of the person who didn't call back after a few wonderful dates. So maybe I was optimistic on my update schedule by a lot *cough* but I had a lot of things come up. So here's some Thanksgiving cheer, hope you all are seeing family or friends or someone important! That's not in the cards for me this year :( but eat some yummy yummy turkey for me!
“I’m sorry, I’m Charlie Bradbury. I’m your coordinator and,” she pointed behind her, “this is where I work when I’m not helping you. I bet it was such a long drive from Las Vegas.”
That caused an immediate launch on the good ship Sam Cares. “You shouldn’t let her do that to you. You’re better than that. I mean, it’s not like there’s anything wrong with Lebanon.”
Cas’s parents were a mixed bag. Charles looked dubious. Rebecca grabbed a handkerchief from the breast pocket of a guy standing near her, that grumpy guy who was the leader of Team
But when he woke up the next morning, dragging with a hangover, he was pleased to see that he had a text.
Charlie blushed while the young man beat a hasty retreat. “Well, uh, we’re glad to have you. I should go grab the entries now.” She left at a more sedate pace but no less uncomfortable.
Castiel didn’t usually get first-timers. He had only been at Archangel St. Raphael’s church for the past two years and, on average, spent three sessions a week in the confession booth.
He had a reason for thinking that, a very good reason. Didn’t Cas say he was? He was so damn lost. He shook his head again and pushed past Cas.
Despite the other man’s amusement, Castiel closed his eyes very tightly, and focused. “I would suggest avoiding the circumstances that led to the deaths. Also, if the...deaths are a matter of unresolved legality, that should be taken care of. If not, then perhaps their family has lingering issues and could use assistance.”
Cas looked at them, unsurprised of course because Sam thought he was sneaky, inclined his head and sat down. “Hello, Dean. Hello, Sam.”
Grasping for thoughts, he heard the crinkle of paper as he lifted a knee to get more comfortable. “Oh right, I brought those receipts. If you’ve changed your mind, that’s fine.” He dug in his pocket and pulled out the miserable wrinkled bits of paper and offered them up.
“Just so you know, there is a good chance their security cameras are two handycams duct-taped in the corner, leading to a VCR.”
Dean judged the distance from the door from where he was. Not that he was worried about violence, it was partially habit. He wondered if he was about to be subjected to prejudice or, alternatively, the man saying he didn’t act stereotypical enough.
Dean’s earlier words came back to him, ‘last time someone looked at me like that, I got laid.’ He didn’t mean to, but he checked out his mouth again.
“Tomorrow night. That means I have…” Dean checked his watch. “Thirty six hours to drink and sleep and shit.”
Dean nodded and rubbed the back of his neck. “Eh, so…” What did exactly one do in this situation? Cassie had always elaborately vowed to miss him and soooo looking forward to seeing him over the summer.
Castiel’s hair was plastered flat and he had to blink rapidly because of the rain. “I’m having a crisis,” he said flatly.
Should he stay and give Sam a helping hand with the guy lest they end up friends for three years and Sam doesn’t make a move until graduation day again? He kinda deserved that slap.
The crowd began to disperse, but then their trajectory changed abruptly. Most began to veer to the right where the end of the testing tables were. Dean thought they were getting in line at first, but they were making a semi-circle.
By the time the day came around of the Monster Apocalypse, he was tired of Benny asking if he was up for the show. Of course he was up for the show, they were playing their hardest head-bangin’ rock while machines wrecked other machines. It was almost as cool as playing a Monster Truck rally, that was still on his bucket list.
Dean licked his lips. “I know what I want. I want you, and...I’ll support you, and when we graduate--I mean, when you graduate, I want to get married. If you want.”
Dean stood against the driver’s side, the sunlight and overhanging branches making wavy shadows on his car. It was a peaceful neighborhood, he could walk nearly anywhere simply if he just took out the time. It was like a hundred he’d passed through before.
They walked around for a bit longer, grabbing a burger for him while Sam had his soy tofu sprouts sandwich or something. Okay, it was a little disappointing that he wasn’t going to experience a Friday college night of heavy alcohol use and skimpily dressed sorority chicks, but Sam was so damn glad to have him around. He introduced him to more of the fraternity brothers, almost all as nerdy as Sam, Dean could sense it.
It took at least two shots to not punch his friend in the arm every time. Cas drank the shots as they were ordered with a funny air of determination, but Sam was obviously reluctant even though he had four pieces of pizza.
A familiar laugh broke into his thoughts. A laugh he had heard many times in the dark and in smoky tiny bars.
A louder cheer went up and Edith, who had her own table with cookies, tarts, pies and other items, clapped both hands to her cheeks in pleasure.
“You wanted me to give you Absolution?” He deliberately nudged aside the most obvious meaning there. Sometimes confessions contained subtle propositions, usually starting with speaking of unnatural desire or lust.
After the door shut and they were alone, Dean pushed around the tiny triangle of heaven on his plate. He was nervous.
“That’s my job.” He grinned, finally having his hands wrapped around a nice hot mug of precious caffeine. The aroma was everything that he needed in life right now. So caught up in his enamoration, he missed what was being said. “Wait, what?”
Cas was in the middle of the eager crowd, speaking quietly to those close enough to him. When his intent blue eyes turned to him, the chatter around seemed to die as if someone hit the mute button.
Maybe he was just a pessimistic type of guy, but life was pretty fucked up sometimes. Their mother passed away before he could remember more than just a few precious scraps, and Sam none at all. He looked at his brother, to see if he was hearing the words the way Dean meant them.
at me.” Dean roughly shoved Cas’s face away, keeping his hand there to make a sort of shield as he sliced away the pants. They had to be peeled off his thighs, having partially dried in tacky splotches.
This, this was worth rolling out of bed for. If he went to college here, he’d be here every day with tongue hanging out.
Cas looked dazed for a moment as their mouths softly parted. “I’m glad to see you too,” his voice was a touch more hoarse than normal.
Dean carefully stepped aside to peer closely at the socket. “Old wiring plus wrong wattage can equal...sparks.” He looked over the black clad figure still in the doorway. “Turn off the switch and slice a potato in half and hand it to me.” He dragged a stool toward the middle of the kitchen and held out his hand as he checked out the fixture of one of the broken light bulbs.
“Thanks, brother. Talk to you soon.” Benny grinned brightly as he left down the street, a lighter step to his walk.
He held out his hand and waited until cool metal touched his palm. Adjusting for the weight, he pulled it back and checked the tightness high up. “Thanks. So the problem is that you don’t attach copper to galvanized pipes. And who knows how many got replaced? Most people just switch out busted ones instead of doing the whole system because it takes forever. Can you turn down the radio?”
Dean wants to talk to Charlie. Gus wants to talk with Dean. Dean does NOT want to talk with Crowley. And at the end of the day, he finds someone who is going to talk with him.
Her eyes lit up as she cracked her gum, giving him a good look over. “Is this your first time, darlin’?”
And he kept right on trying to not think into the next morning. His first stop of the morning was the hardware store, so early that Gus was just stumbling out of his Lancia Prisma with wild hair and puffy eyes.
There, now Sam's tone was light and they were flirting away. Dean shifted his hip and palmed his phone, glad he was sitting alone on the other side of the table.
Of course he was literally lost within a block, turning around and unsure which direction he came. The van was always unlocked, he could just crash in there until the other guys were ready to drive it to the hotel.
Dean finally hit on something interesting when he jokingly asked a member of the Men-o-Strikes if they saw many people move in at all. At the end of a five-year update on her own life she finally got to the latest move-ins. “My best friend's niece saw a young man at the furniture shop buying a mattress. I remember she commented on it because he had this little car filled with boxes. Benny probably lent him rope, he works there part time. Not many other people would hire him, though I did hear he got a nice job doing street maintenance.”
No, it wasn’t just Dean. The crowd had actually quieted around them as the priest and the new Pastor looked at each other.
“I’ve done you one better; I got you a job at the main church there. So brush up on that fucked up book, you’ll need it.”
“Yes. Use your right hand.” Castiel did have to wonder how long this confession would take. If the man had no idea what was going on, it could be a while.
Castiel had come to categorize sinners by two types; sinkers and swimmers. The sinkers were the whisperers, the mumblers with the same harm each time. The swimmers seemed to move on to new mundane things, coveting a pretty person outside their marriage, lying about being sick to their boss.
Dean savagely hit the End Call button with his thumb and wished he still had a clunker with a handle so he could slam down the phone proper. It was so much more satisfying to hear the crack and the muffled clang inside like a bell.
The voice returned to its normal low level. “Because you’re real, Cas. I crave another actual person to look at me, so that I know I’m real.”
“Oh, you’re gonna be a lot of fun.” He stabbed the same spot again, and again, making a mess of the skin until blood flecked his own arms and chest. He could taste the coppery drops when licking his own lips.
He typed with one hand as he snapped the button open on his jeans, breathing a sigh in relief as soon as the constriction was gone. He shut his eyes tightly, trying to picture all the times he’d had one hand on Cassie’s back while moving inside her. But a less waspish waist kept popping up in his head, toned shoulders with skin just shy of pale all stretched out in front of him.
“Oh, an in-law suite. You know, separate living quarters in the same house, but you’ll have your own entrance and kitchen, that sort of thing.”
Dean made sure to say goodbye to Edith and resumed his line of thought. “Benny has a truck. So, are they any ladies groups in this town? Sewing, book clubs, tea time, or something?”
Dean returned to the Judge’s table to meet John and say hello to the curious people stopping for a chat and introduction. Some he recognized from their house, but most were new faces. He closely checked out each young man around his age to see if they matched Lisa’s description until Crowley coughed.
“I’m only five years older than you, shit for brains.” Benny laughed as he shoved a guitar case in Dean’s arms. “We got three rooms. You know the rules.”
Sam had no choice but to follow him out into the sweltering push of bodies and yells and dancing and off-kilter singing to the music from the speakers.
“Oh my goodness, look at the time!” Bella checked her watch and stood up, making an apologetic moue with her mouth. “But I had the loveliest lunch with you two, we should do it more often.”
“You guys did a great job.” He wasn’t lying when he said it. For the most part everything else was done well, the patched up spots were barely noticeable and the walls was painted and furniture was polished. He figured they couldn’t afford to hire someone with more technical skills at the time, no shame in that.
“Oh, definitely. My five-alarm chili is a misnomer, it has at least seven.” Gus winked and read him the total.
Oh! Dean slid out of the seat, brushing his shoulder against Cas’s chest accidentally. Cas closed both doors before Dean could yank his side shut.
Okay. Okay think. Why did anyone live the way they lived? “I don’t always know, man.” He shrugged. “I was raised to this. I had a choice, sure, but I just fell into it because that’s the path I was on. It’s not a bad life or anything, but sometimes I’m jealous of what other people have. A home. A family. They don’t always have to fight. I mean, I’ve seen more danger than most people ever have short of a shitty neighborhood or other life-saving careers. But that’s the thick of it, I guess, is if I can help even just one person, it’s all worth it.”
Dean seriously considered heading all the way back to Minnesota and dragging his tall ass brother to Kansas by his long hair. “It's not just any bullshit, Sam. They got codes and books and special handshakes.”
“What are you talking about? I’ve been here for a week and a half and all of it fits in a grocery bag. Either that counts as excessive in an one streetlight town like this or you’re grasping at straws for some reason.”
Dean nodded. A bit geeky, but he could dig it. “Sounds bitchin’. You guys coming to the Roadhouse tonight?”
It wasn’t until house five-billion that a young man with dark hair answered the door. Brown eyes, just a few inches shorter than Dean. He matched the description. Of course, he wasn’t the first guy to match the quite average description...no way to check if he had a tattoo on his upper back without somehow getting his shirt off, and even Dean wasn’t that good.
At first he was blinded with pale afterimages as his eyes adjusted to the dim lighting. He let the door close behind him and lingered for a moment. He could see into the main area from where he stood, with its polished pews and matching dark brown rafters up above.
Scowling, Dean sat on the other side of where the disturbing man did and stared at the ceiling. This job had given him more trouble than any before. He did call Sam, even though he was much less enthused about relating the news than before. He didn’t know the furniture store, but Sam was good at finding out those types of things.
Dean crushed the can and grinned to himself. Certain parts of him were insistent no matter which way she went, this was going to be all hers tomorrow night. As he adjusted himself with the heel of his hand, an image of vibrant blue eyes popped into his head.
A snort came from the mobile phone sitting beside the faucet, his brother apparently not appreciating the sentiment. “You’re going to have to curb that sort of talk during the case. This is bible country and religion is our only lead.”
